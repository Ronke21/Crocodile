<text>Anna Christie is a play in four acts by Eugene O&#x27;Neill. It made its Broadway debut at the Vanderbilt Theatre on November 2, 1921. O&#x27;Neill received the 1922 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for this work. According to historian Paul Avrich, the character of Anna Christie was based on Christine Ell, an anarchist cook in Greenwich Village, who was the lover of Edward Mylius, a Belgian-born radical living in England who libeled the British king George V.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Anna Christie&quot; is the story of a former prostitute who falls in love, but runs into difficulty in turning her life around.

; Characters
* Johnny the Priest
* Two longshoremen
* A postman
* Larry — bartender
* Chris C. Christopherson — captain of the barge &quot;Simeon Winthrop&quot;
* Marthy Owen
* Anna Christopherson — Chris&#x27;s daughter
* Mat Burke — a stoker
* Johnson — deckhand on barge

=== Act I ===
The first act takes place in a bar owned by Johnny the Priest and tended by Larry. Coal-barge captain Old Chris receives a letter from his daughter, a young woman he has not seen since he lived in Sweden with his family and she was five years old. They meet at the bar and she agrees to go to the coal barge with him.

=== Act II ===
The barge crew rescues Mat Burke and four other men who survived a shipwreck in an open boat. Anna and Mat don&#x27;t get along at first, but quickly fall in love.

=== Act III ===
A confrontation on the barge among Anna, Chris and Mat. Mat wants to marry Anna, Chris does not want her to marry a sailor, and Anna doesn&#x27;t want either of them to think they can control her. She tells them the truth about her past: She was raped while living with her mother&#x27;s relatives on a Minnesota farm, worked briefly as a nurse&#x27;s aide, then became a prostitute. Mat reacts angrily, and he and Chris leave.

=== Act IV ===
Mat and Chris return. Anna forgives Chris for not being part of her childhood. After a dramatic confrontation, Anna promises to abandon prostitution and Mat forgives her. Chris agrees to their marriage. Chris and Mat have both signed to work aboard a ship that is leaving for South Africa the next day. They promise to return to Anna after the voyage.

== Productions ==
O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s first version of this play, begun in January 1919, was titled &quot;Chris Christopherson&quot; and performed as &quot;Chris&quot; in out-of-town tryouts. O&#x27;Neill revised it radically, changing the barge captain&#x27;s daughter Anna from a pure woman needing to be protected into a prostitute who finds reformation and love from life on the sea. The new version, now titled &quot;Anna Christie&quot;, premiered on Broadway at the Vanderbilt Theatre on November 2, 1921, and ran for 177 performances before closing in April 1923. The production was staged by Arthur Hopkins and starred Pauline Lord.

Alexander Woollcott in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a singularly engrossing play&quot;, and advised &quot;all grown-up playgoers&quot; to see it.

The London West End premiere was staged at the Strand Theatre (now the Novello) in 1923. This was the first time an O&#x27;Neill play was seen in the West End. The play starred Pauline Lord, who had been the original Anna Christie on Broadway. The play had a great reception. &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;In London, the first night of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Anna Christie&quot;, with Pauline Lord in the title role, received a tremendous ovation. After the first act the curtain was rung up a dozen times during the applause.&quot;

===Revivals===
* 1952: The play was revived at the Lyceum Theatre on January 23, 1952, staged by Michael Gordon and designed by Emeline C. Roche with Celeste Holm as Anna, Kevin McCarthy, and Arthur O&#x27;Connell. It ran for 8 performances.

* 1955: The play was revived at the Teatro 5 de diciembre of Mexico City, directed by Tulio Demicheli. It starred Silvia Pinal as Anna and Wolf Ruvinskis.
* 1966: The play was successfully revived in Los Angeles at the Huntington Hartford Theatre on May 2 and ran through May 21. Directed by Jack Garfein, it starred his wife Carroll Baker as Anna, with James Whitmore as Chris and Hermione Baddeley as Marthy. The show then transferred to the Tappen Zee Playhouse in Nyack, New York where it ran from June 23 to July 2 with Isabel Jewel replacing Baddeley as Marthy. 
* 1977: The play was revived at the Imperial Theatre on April 14, 1977, directed by José Quintero and designed by Ben Edwards. It starred Liv Ullmann as Anna, Robert Donley, John Lithgow and Mary McCarty. It received Tony Award nominations for Liv Ullmann as Best Actress and for Mary McCarty as Best Featured Actress. It ran for 124 performances.
* 1990: The play was staged at the Young Vic theatre in London and starred Natasha Richardson.
* 1993: The play was revived on Broadway on January 14, 1993 by The Roundabout Theatre Company at the Criterion Center Stage Right. It was directed by David Leveaux and designed by John Lee Beatty. It starred Natasha Richardson, Liam Neeson, Anne Meara, and Rip Torn. It received Tony Award nominations for Best Actress (Natasha Richardson), Best Actor (Liam Neeson), Best Featured Actress (Anne Meara), Best Direction (David Leveaux), and won the award for Best Revival. Neeson and Richardson both received the Theatre World Award. The production won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play for Richardson. It ran for 54 performances.
* 2002: The play was directed by Gar Campbell at the Pacific Resident Theatre, rerunning from January 5, 2002 to May 5, 2002, starring Lesley Fera.
* 2011: The play was produced at the Donmar Warehouse, London, running from August 4, 2011 to October 8, 2011, with Ruth Wilson as Anna, Jude Law as Mat, and David Hayman as Chris. It was positively received by critics, with mostly 4 and 5 star reviews, and it won the 2012 Olivier Award for &quot;best revival&quot;.

==Adaptations==

The play was adapted by Bradley King for a 1923 film of the same name directed by John Griffith Wray and Thomas H. Ince, with stars Blanche Sweet, William Russell, George F. Marion, and Eugenie Besserer.

The play inspired &quot;Kiri no Minato&quot;, directed by Kenji Mizoguchi in 1923, though the plot is quite different from the original. This film is actually lost.

A 1930 film adaptation by Frances Marion was directed by Clarence Brown and starred Greta Garbo, Charles Bickford, George F. Marion and Marie Dressler. This pre-Code film used the marketing slogan &quot;Garbo Talks!&quot;, as it was her first talkie. Her first spoken line has become her most famous: &quot;Give me a whiskey with ginger ale on the side, and don&#x27;t be stingy, baby.&quot; George F. Marion, who had performed the role of Anna&#x27;s father in the original Broadway production, reprised the role in both the 1923 and 1930 film adaptations.

A German-language adaptation, also starring Garbo, was filmed in 1930 and released the same year, using the same production as the English language film that had concluded filming in 1929. This version was adapted by Frances Marion, translated by Walter Hasenclever and directed by Jacques Feyder. In addition to Garbo, the cast included Theo Shall, Hans Junkermann, and Salka Viertel.

In 1957, a thoroughly reworked adaptation by George Abbott with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill, called &quot;New Girl in Town&quot;, opened on Broadway. It ran for 431 performances.

In 2018, Encompass New Opera Theatre presented an opera adaptation composed by Edward Thomas with a libretto by Joe Masteroff at the Baruch College Performing Arts Center in New York City. Directed by Nancy Rhodes and conducted by Julian Wachner, it featured Melanie Long in the title role, Frank Basile as Chris, Jonathan Estabrooks as Mat, Joe Hermlayn as Marthy and Mike Pirozzi as Larry. It ran for 12 performances. A recording with the original cast, produced by Thomas Z. Shepard and conducted by Julian Wachner, with the orchestra NOVUS New York, will be released by Broadway Records on August 16, 2019. It is a collaboration of Trinity Church and Encompass New Opera Theatre.

==Trivia==
According to actress Ellen Burstyn in the 2012 film &quot;Marilyn in Manhattan,&quot; Marilyn Monroe performed a scene from &quot;Anna Christie&quot; at the Actors Studio with Maureen Stapleton. Calling the story &quot;legendary,&quot; Burstyn said, &quot;Everybody who saw that says that it was not only the best work Marilyn ever did, it was some of the best work ever seen at Studio, and certainly the best interpretation of Anna Christie anybody ever saw. She...achieved real greatness in that scene.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==

<doc id="175039" wikidata="Q594666" url="?curid=175039" title="Czochralski method">
<text>The Czochralski method, also Czochralski technique or Czochralski process, is a method of crystal growth used to obtain single crystals of semiconductors (e.g. silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide), metals (e.g. palladium, platinum, silver, gold), salts and synthetic gemstones. The method is named after Polish scientist Jan Czochralski, who invented the method in 1915 while investigating the crystallization rates of metals. He made this discovery by accident: instead of dipping his pen into his inkwell, he dipped it in molten tin, and drew a tin filament, which later proved to be a single crystal. The method is still used in over 90 percent of all electronics in the world that use semiconductors.

The most important application may be the growth of large cylindrical ingots, or boules, of single crystal silicon used in the electronics industry to make semiconductor devices like integrated circuits. Other semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, can also be grown by this method, although lower defect densities in this case can be obtained using variants of the Bridgman–Stockbarger method.

The method is not limited to production of metal or metalloid crystals. For example, it is used to manufacture very high-purity crystals of salts, including material with controlled isotopic composition, for use in particle physics experiments, with tight controls (part per billion measurements) on confounding metal ions and water absorbed during manufacture. 
== Application ==

Monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) grown by the &quot;Czochralski method&quot; is often referred to as &quot;monocrystalline Czochralski silicon&quot; (Cz-Si). It is the basic material in the production of integrated circuits used in computers, TVs, mobile phones and all types of electronic equipment and semiconductor devices. Monocrystalline silicon is also used in large quantities by the photovoltaic industry for the production of conventional mono-Si solar cells. The almost perfect crystal structure yields the highest light-to-electricity conversion efficiency for silicon.

== Production of Czochralski silicon ==
High-purity, semiconductor-grade silicon (only a few parts per million of impurities) is melted in a crucible at , usually made of quartz. Dopant impurity atoms such as boron or phosphorus can be added to the molten silicon in precise amounts to dope the silicon, thus changing it into p-type or n-type silicon, with different electronic properties. A precisely oriented rod-mounted seed crystal is dipped into the molten silicon. The seed crystal&#x27;s rod is slowly pulled upwards and rotated simultaneously. By precisely controlling the temperature gradients, rate of pulling and speed of rotation, it is possible to extract a large, single-crystal, cylindrical ingot from the melt. Occurrence of unwanted instabilities in the melt can be avoided by investigating and visualizing the temperature and velocity fields during the crystal growth process. This process is normally performed in an inert atmosphere, such as argon, in an inert chamber, such as quartz.

== Crystal sizes==

Due to efficiencies of scale, the semiconductor industry often uses wafers with standardized dimensions, or common wafer specifications. Early on, boules were small, a few centimeters wide. With advanced technology, high-end device manufacturers use 200 mm and 300 mm diameter wafers. Width is controlled by precise control of temperature, speeds of rotation, and the speed at which the seed holder is withdrawn. The crystal ingots from which wafers are sliced can be up to 2 metres in length, weighing several hundred kilograms. Larger wafers allow improvements in manufacturing efficiency, as more chips can be fabricated on each wafer, with lower relative loss, so there has been a steady drive to increase silicon wafer sizes. The next step up, 450 mm, was scheduled for introduction in 2018. Silicon wafers are typically about 0.2–0.75 mm thick, and can be polished to great flatness for making integrated circuits or textured for making solar cells.

==Incorporating impurities==


When silicon is grown by the Czochralski method, the melt is contained in a silica (quartz) crucible. During growth, the walls of the crucible dissolve into the melt and Czochralski silicon therefore contains oxygen at a typical concentration of 10 cm. Oxygen impurities can have beneficial or detrimental effects. Carefully chosen annealing conditions can give rise to the formation of oxygen precipitates. These have the effect of trapping unwanted transition metal impurities in a process known as gettering, improving the purity of surrounding silicon. However, formation of oxygen precipitates at unintended locations can also destroy electrical structures. Additionally, oxygen impurities can improve the mechanical strength of silicon wafers by immobilising any dislocations which may be introduced during device processing. It was experimentally shown in the 1990s that the high oxygen concentration is also beneficial for the radiation hardness of silicon particle detectors used in harsh radiation environment (such as CERN&#x27;s LHC/HL-LHC projects). Therefore, radiation detectors made of Czochralski- and magnetic Czochralski-silicon are considered to be promising candidates for many future high-energy physics experiments. It has also been shown that the presence of oxygen in silicon increases impurity trapping during post-implantation annealing processes.

However, oxygen impurities can react with boron in an illuminated environment, such as that experienced by solar cells. This results in the formation of an electrically active boron–oxygen complex that detracts from cell performance. Module output drops by approximately 3% during the first few hours of light exposure.

===Mathematical form===
Impurity concentration in the final solid is given by formula_1 where and are (respectively) the initial and final concentration, and the initial and final volume, and the segregation coefficient associated with impurities at the melting phase transition. This follows from the fact that formula_2 impurities are removed from the melt when an infinitesimal volume freezes.

<text>Abu Nasr Muhammad al-Farabi (; – 14 December 950–12 January 951), known in the Latin West as Alpharabius, was an early Islamic philosopher and music theorist. He has been designated as &quot;Father of Islamic Neoplatonism&quot;, and the &quot;Founder of Islamic Political Philosophy&quot;.

Al-Farabi&#x27;s fields of philosophical interest included—but not limited to, philosophy of society and religion; philosophy of Language and Logic; psychology and epistemology; metaphysics, political philosophy, and ethics. He was an expert in both, practical musicianship and music theory, and although he was not intrinsically a scientist, his works incorporate astronomy, mathematics, cosmology, and physics.

Al-Farabi is credited as the first Muslim who presented philosophy as a coherent system in the Islamic world, and created a philosophical system of his own, which developed a philosophical system that went far beyond the scholastic interests of his Greco-Roman Neoplatonism and Syriac Aristotelian precursors. That he was more than a pioneer in Islamic philosophy, can be deduced from the habit of later writers calling him the &quot;Second Master&quot;, with Aristotle as the first.

Al-Farabi&#x27;s impact on philosophy is undeniable, to name a few, Yahya ibn Adi, Abu Sulayman Sijistani, Abu al-Hassan al-Amiri, and Abu Hayyan al-Tawhidi; Avicenna, Suhrawardi, and Mulla Sadra; Avempace, Ibn Tufail, and Averroes; Maimonides, Albertus Magnus, and Leo Strauss. He was known in the Latin West, as well as the Islamic world.

== Biography ==
The existing variations in the basic accounts of al-Farabi&#x27;s origins and pedigree indicate that they were not recorded during his lifetime or soon thereafter by anyone with concrete information, but were based on hearsay or guesses (as is the case with other contemporaries of al-Farabi). Little is known about his life. Early sources include an autobiographical passage where al-Farabi traces the history of logic and philosophy up to his time, and brief mentions by al-Masudi, Ibn al-Nadim and Ibn Hawqal. Said al-Andalusi wrote a biography of al-Farabi. Arabic biographers of the 12th–13th centuries thus had few facts to hand, and used invented stories about his life.

From incidental accounts it is known that he spent significant time (most of his scholarly life) in Baghdad with Syriac Christian scholars, including the cleric Yuhanna ibn Haylan, Yahya ibn Adi, and Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Baghdadi. He later spent time in Damascus and in Egypt before returning to Damascus where he died in 950–951.

His name was Abu Nasr Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Farabi, sometimes with the family surname al-Tarkhani, i.e., the element Tarkhan appears in a nisba. His grandfather was not known among his contemporaries, but a name Awzalagh, in Arabic, suddenly appears later in the writings of Ibn Abi Usaybi&#x27;a, and of his great-grandfather in those of Ibn Khallikan.

His birthplace could have been any one of the many places in Central Asia—then known by the name of Khurasan. The word is a Persian term for a locale that is irrigated by effluent springs or flows from a nearby river. Thus, there are many places that carry the name (or various evolutions of that toponym) in that general area, such as Farab (Otrar) on the Jaxartes (Syr Darya) in modern Kazakhstan; Farab, an still-extant village in suburbs of the city of Chaharjuy/Amul (modern Türkmenabat) on the Oxus Amu Darya in Turkmenistan, on the Silk Road, connecting Merv to Bukhara, or Faryab in Greater Khorasan (modern day Afghanistan). The older Persian Parab (in Hudud ul-&#x27;alam) or Faryab (also Paryab), is a common Persian toponym meaning &quot;lands irrigated by diversion of river water&quot;.

=== Background ===
While scholars largely agree that his ethnic background is not knowable, Al-Farabi has also been described as being of either Persian or Turkic origin. Medieval Arab historian Ibn Abi Usaibia (died in 1270)—one of al-Farabi&#x27;s oldest biographer—mentions in his Uyun that al-Farabi&#x27;s father was of Persian descent. Al-Shahrazuri, who lived around 1288 and has written an early biography, also states that al-Farabi hailed from a Persian family. According to Majid Fakhry, an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Georgetown University, al-Farabi&#x27;s father &quot;was an army captain of Persian extraction.&quot; A Persian origin has been stated by many other sources as well. Dimitri Gutas notes that Farabi&#x27;s works contain references and glosses in Persian, Sogdian, and even Greek, but not Turkish. Sogdian has also been suggested as his native language and the language of the inhabitants of Farab. Muhammad Javad Mashkoor argues for an Iranian-speaking Central Asian origin. According to Christoph Baumer, he was probably a Sogdian. According to Thérèse-Anne Druart, writing in 2020, &quot;Scholars have disputed his ethnic origin. Some claimed he was Turkish but more recent research points to him being a Persian.&quot;

The oldest known reference to a Turkic origin is given by the medieval historian Ibn Khallikan (died in 1282), who in his work &quot;Wafayat&quot; (completed in 669/1271) states that al-Farabi was born in the small village of Wasij near Farab (in what is today Otrar, Kazakhstan) of Turkic parents. Based on this account, some scholars say he is of Turkic origin. Dimitri Gutas, an American Arabist, criticizes this, saying that Ibn Khallikan&#x27;s account is aimed at the earlier historical accounts by Ibn Abi Usaybi&#x27;a, and serves the purpose to &quot;prove&quot; a Turkic origin for al-Farabi, for instance by mentioning the additional nisba (surname) &quot;al-Turk&quot; (arab. &quot;the Turk&quot;)—a nisba al-Farabi never had. However, Abu al-Feda, who copied Ibn Khallekan, changed &quot;al-Torkī&quot; to the phrase &quot;wa-kana rajolan torkiyan&quot;, meaning &quot;he was a Turkish man.&quot; In this regard, since works of such supposed Turks lack traces of Turkic nomadic culture, Oxford professor C.E. Bosworth notes that &quot;great figures [such] as Farabi, Biruni, and Avicenna have been attached by over enthusiastic Turkish scholars to their race&quot;.

=== Life and education ===
Al-Farabi spent most of his scholarly life in Baghdad. In the autobiographical passage preserved by Ibn Abi Usaybi&#x27;a, al-Farabi stated that he had studied logic, medicine and sociology with Yuhanna ibn Haylan up to and including Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;, i.e., according to the order of the books studied in the curriculum, al-Farabi was claiming that he had studied Porphyry&#x27;s &quot;Eisagoge&quot; and Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Categories&quot;, &quot;De Interpretatione&quot;, &quot;Prior and Posterior Analytics&quot;. His teacher, Yuhanna bin Haylan, was a Nestorian cleric. This period of study was probably in Baghdad, where al-Mas&#x27;udi records that Yuhanna died during the reign of al-Muqtadir (295-320/908-32). In his &quot;Appearance of Philosophy&quot; (), al-Farabi tells us: Philosophy as an academic subject became widespread in the days of the Ptolemaic kings of the Greeks after the death of Aristotle in Alexandria until the end of the woman’s reign [i.e., Cleopatra’s]. The teaching of it continued unchanged in Alexandria after the death of Aristotle through the reign of thirteen kings ... Thus it went until the coming of Christianity. Then the teaching came to an end in Rome while it continued in Alexandria until the king of the Christians looked into the matter. The bishops assembled and took counsel together on which parts of [philosophy] teaching were to be left in place and which were to be discontinued. They formed the opinion that the books on logic were to be taught up to the end of the assertoric figures [&quot;Prior Analytics&quot;, I.7] but not what comes after it, since they thought that would harm Christianity. Teaching the rest [of the logical works] remained private until the coming of Islam when the teaching was transferred from Alexandria to Antioch. There it remained for a long time until only one teacher was left. Two men learned from him, and they left, taking the books with them. One of them was from Harran, the other from Marw. As for the man from Marw, two men learned from him..., Ibrahim al-Marwazi and Yuhanna ibn Haylan. [Al-Farabi then says he studied with Yuhanna ibn Haylan up to the end of the &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;].He was in Baghdad at least until the end of September 942, as recorded in notes in his &quot;Mabādeʾ ārāʾ ahl al-madīna al-fāżela&quot;. He finished the book in Damascus the following year (331), i.e., by September 943). He also lived and taught for some time in Aleppo. Al-Farabi later visited Egypt, finishing six sections summarizing the book &quot;Mabādeʾ&quot;, in Egypt in 337/July 948 – June 949 when he returned to Syria, where he was supported by Sayf al-Dawla, the Hamdanid ruler. Al-Mas&#x27;udi, writing barely five years after the fact (955-6, the date of the composition of the Tanbīh), says that al-Farabi died in Damascus in Rajab 339 (between 14 December 950 and 12 January 951).

== Religious beliefs ==
Al-Farabi&#x27;s religious affiliation within Islam is disputed. While some historians identify him as Sunni, some others assert he was Shia or influenced by Shia. Fauzi Najjar argues that al-Farabi&#x27;s political philosophy was influenced by Shiite sects. Giving a positive account, Nadia Maftouni describes Shi&#x27;ite aspects of al-Farabi&#x27;s writings. As she put it, al-Farabi in his al-Millah, al-Siyasah al-Madaniyah, and Tahsil al-Sa’adah believes in a utopia governed by Prophet and his successors: the Imams.

== Works and contributions ==

Al-Farabi made contributions to the fields of logic, mathematics, music, philosophy, psychology, and education.

=== Alchemy ===

Al-Farabi wrote: &quot;The Necessity of the Art of the Elixir&quot;.

=== Logic ===

Though he was mainly an Aristotelian logician, he included a number of non-Aristotelian elements in his works. He discussed the topics of future contingents, the number and relation of the categories, the relation between logic and grammar, and non-Aristotelian forms of inference. He is also credited with categorizing logic into two separate groups, the first being &quot;idea&quot; and the second being &quot;proof&quot;.

Al-Farabi also considered the theories of conditional syllogisms and analogical inference, which were part of the Stoic tradition of logic rather than the Aristotelian. Another addition al-Farabi made to the Aristotelian tradition was his introduction of the concept of &quot;poetic syllogism&quot; in a commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;.

=== Music ===

Al-Farabi wrote a book on music titled &quot;Kitab al-Musiqi al-Kabir&quot; (Grand Book of Music). In it, he presents philosophical principles about music, its cosmic qualities, and its influences, and discusses the therapeutic effects of music on the soul. He moreover talks about its impact on speech, clarifying how actually to fit music to speech, i.e., poetry, in arrange to upgrade the meaning of a text.

=== Philosophy ===
As a philosopher, al-Farabi was a founder of his own school of early Islamic philosophy known as &quot;Farabism&quot; or &quot;Alfarabism&quot;, though it was later overshadowed by Avicennism. Al-Farabi&#x27;s school of philosophy &quot;breaks with the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle [... and ...] moves from metaphysics to methodology, a move that anticipates modernity&quot;, and &quot;at the level of philosophy, Farabi unites theory and practice [... and] in the sphere of the political he liberates practice from theory&quot;. His Neoplatonic theology is also more than just metaphysics as rhetoric. In his attempt to think through the nature of a First Cause, Farabi discovers the limits of human knowledge&quot;.

Al-Farabi had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries, and was widely considered second only to Aristotle in knowledge (alluded to by his title of the &quot;Second Teacher&quot;), in his time. His work, aimed at synthesis of philosophy and Sufism, paved the way for the work of Avicenna.

Al-Farabi also wrote a commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s work, and one of his most notable works is &quot;Ara Ahl al-Madina al-Fadila&quot;, where he theorized an ideal state, supposedly modelled on Plato&#x27;s &quot;The Republic&quot;. Al-Farabi argued that religion rendered truth through symbols and persuasion, and, like Plato, saw it as the duty of the philosopher to provide guidance to the state. Al-Farabi incorporated the Platonic view, drawing a parallel from within the Islamic context, in that he regarded the ideal state to be ruled by the Prophet-Imam, instead of the philosopher-king envisaged by Plato. Al-Farabi argued that the ideal state was the city-state of Medina when it was governed by Muhammad as its head of state, as he was in direct communion with Allah whose law was revealed to him. In the absence of the Prophet-Imam, al-Farabi considered democracy as the closest to the ideal state, regarding the order of the Sunni Rashidun Caliphate as an example of such a republican order within early Muslim history. However, he also maintained that it was from democracy that imperfect states emerged, noting how the order of the early Islamic Caliphate of the Rashidun caliphs, which he viewed as republican, was later replaced by a form of government resembling a monarchy under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties.

=== Physics ===

Al-Farabi wrote a short treatise &quot;On Vacuum&quot;, where he thought about the nature of the existence of void. His final conclusion was that air&#x27;s volume can expand to fill available space, and he suggested that the concept of perfect vacuum was incoherent.

=== Psychology ===

In his &quot;Opinions of the People of the Ideal City&quot;, al-Farabi expressed that a separated person may not accomplish all the idealizations by himself, without the help of other people. It is the intrinsic mien of each man to connect to another human being or to other men within the labor he has to perform. Consequently, to realize what he can of that flawlessness, each man must remain within the neighborhood of others and relate with them.
In chapter 24 of aforementioned text—&quot;On the Cause of Dreams&quot;— he distinguished between dream interpretation and the nature and causes of dreams.

== Influences and transmission ==

The main influence on al-Farabi&#x27;s philosophy was the Aristotelian tradition of Alexandria. A prolific writer, he is credited with over one hundred works. Amongst these are a number of prolegomena to philosophy, commentaries on important Aristotelian works (such as the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;) as well as his own works. His ideas are marked by their coherency, despite drawing together of many different philosophical disciplines and traditions. Some other significant influences on his work were the planetary model of Ptolemy and elements of Neo-Platonism, particularly metaphysics and practical (or political) philosophy—which bears more resemblance to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; than Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot;.

Al-Farabi played an essential part in the handing down of Aristotle&#x27;s thought to the Christian West during the Middle Ages, as appears in the translation of al-Farabi&#x27;s &quot;Commentary and Short Treatise on Aristotle&#x27;s de Interpretatione&quot; that F. W. Zimmermann published in 1981. Al-Farabi had a great influence on Maimonides, the most important Jewish thinker of the Middle Ages. Maimonides wrote the celebrated &quot;Treatise on Logic&quot; in Arabic. The work treats of the essentials of Aristotelian logic in the light of comments made by Avicenna and al-Farabi; Rémi Brague emphasises the fact that al-Farabi is the only philosopher mentioned by name within the text.

Al-Farabi, as well as Avicenna and Averroes, have been recognized as Peripatetics (&quot;al-Mashsha’iyun&quot;) or rationalists (&quot;Estedlaliun&quot;) among Muslims. However, he tried to gather together the ideas of Plato and Aristotle in his book &quot;Harmonization of the Opinion of the Two Sage&quot;.

According to Reisman, his work was singularly directed towards the goal of simultaneously reviving and reinventing the Alexandrian philosophical tradition, to which his Christian teacher, Yuhanna ibn Haylan belonged. His success should be measured by the honorific title of the &quot;Second Master&quot; of philosophy, Aristotle being the first, by which he was known. Reisman also says that he does not make any reference to the ideas of either al-Kindi or his contemporary, Rhazes, which clearly indicates that he did not consider their approach to philosophy as a correct or viable one.

== Thought ==

=== Metaphysics and cosmology ===

In contrast to al-Kindi, who considered the subject of metaphysics to be God, al-Farabi believed that it was concerned primarily with being &quot;qua&quot; being (that is, being in and of itself), and this is related to God only to the extent that God is a principle of absolute being. Al-Kindi&#x27;s view was, however, a common misconception regarding Greek philosophy amongst Muslim intellectuals at the time, and it was for this reason that Avicenna remarked that he did not understand Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot; properly until he had read a prolegomenon written by al-Farabi.

Al-Farabi&#x27;s cosmology is essentially based upon three pillars: Aristotelian metaphysics of causation, highly developed Plotinian emanational cosmology and the Ptolemaic astronomy. In his model, the universe is viewed as a number of concentric circles; the outermost sphere or &quot;first heaven&quot;, the sphere of fixed stars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and finally, the Moon. At the centre of these concentric circles is the sub-lunar realm which contains the material world. Each of these circles represent the domain of the secondary intelligences (symbolized by the celestial bodies themselves), which act as causal intermediaries between the First Cause (in this case, God) and the material world. Furthermore these are said to have emanated from God, who is both their formal and efficient cause.

The process of emanation begins (metaphysically, not temporally) with the First Cause, whose principal activity is self-contemplation. And it is this intellectual activity that underlies its role in the creation of the universe. The First Cause, by thinking of itself, &quot;overflows&quot; and the incorporeal entity of the second intellect &quot;emanates&quot; from it. Like its predecessor, the second intellect also thinks about itself, and thereby brings its celestial sphere (in this case, the sphere of fixed stars) into being, but in addition to this it must also contemplate upon the First Cause, and this causes the &quot;emanation&quot; of the next intellect. The cascade of emanation continues until it reaches the tenth intellect, beneath which is the material world. And as each intellect must contemplate both itself and an increasing number of predecessors, each succeeding level of existence becomes more and more complex. This process is based upon necessity as opposed to will. In other words, God does not have a choice whether or not to create the universe, but by virtue of His own existence, He causes it to be. This view also suggests that the universe is eternal, and both of these points were criticized by al-Ghazzali in his attack on the philosophers.

In his discussion of the First Cause (or God), al-Farabi relies heavily on negative theology. He says that it cannot be known by intellectual means, such as dialectical division or definition, because the terms used in these processes to define a thing constitute its substance. Therefore if one was to define the First Cause, each of the terms used would actually constitute a &quot;part&quot; of its substance and therefore behave as a &quot;cause&quot; for its existence, which is impossible as the First Cause is uncaused; it exists without being caused. Equally, he says it cannot be known according to genus and differentia, as its substance and existence are different from all others, and therefore it has no category to which it belongs. If this were the case, then it would not be the First Cause, because something would be prior in existence to it, which is also impossible. This would suggest that the more philosophically simple a thing is, the more perfect it is. And based on this observation, Reisman says it is possible to see the entire hierarchy of al-Farabi&#x27;s cosmology according to classification into genus and species. Each succeeding level in this structure has as its principal qualities multiplicity and deficiency, and it is this ever-increasing complexity that typifies the material world.

=== Epistemology and eschatology ===
Human beings are unique in al-Farabi&#x27;s vision of the universe because they stand between two worlds: the &quot;higher&quot;, immaterial world of the celestial intellects and universal intelligibles, and the &quot;lower&quot;, material world of generation and decay; they inhabit a physical body, and so belong to the &quot;lower&quot; world, but they also have a rational capacity, which connects them to the &quot;higher&quot; realm. Each level of existence in al-Farabi&#x27;s cosmology is characterized by its movement towards perfection, which is to become like the First Cause, i.e. a perfect intellect. Human perfection (or &quot;happiness&quot;), then, is equated with constant intellection and contemplation.

Al-Farabi divides intellect into four categories: potential, actual, acquired and the Agent. The first three are the different states of the human intellect and the fourth is the Tenth Intellect (the moon) in his emanational cosmology. The potential intellect represents the capacity to think, which is shared by all human beings, and the actual intellect is an intellect engaged in the act of thinking. By thinking, al-Farabi means abstracting universal intelligibles from the sensory forms of objects which have been apprehended and retained in the individual&#x27;s imagination.

This motion from potentiality to actuality requires the Agent Intellect to act upon the retained sensory forms; just as the Sun illuminates the physical world to allow us to see, the Agent Intellect illuminates the world of intelligibles to allow us to think. This illumination removes all accident (such as time, place, quality) and physicality from them, converting them into primary intelligibles, which are logical principles such as &quot;the whole is greater than the part&quot;. The human intellect, by its act of intellection, passes from potentiality to actuality, and as it gradually comprehends these intelligibles, it is identified with them (as according to Aristotle, by knowing something, the intellect becomes like it). Because the Agent Intellect knows all of the intelligibles, this means that when the human intellect knows all of them, it becomes associated with the Agent Intellect&#x27;s perfection and is known as the acquired Intellect.

While this process seems mechanical, leaving little room for human choice or volition, Reisman says that al-Farabi is committed to human voluntarism. This takes place when man, based on the knowledge he has acquired, decides whether to direct himself towards virtuous or unvirtuous activities, and thereby decides whether or not to seek true happiness. And it is by choosing what is ethical and contemplating about what constitutes the nature of ethics, that the actual intellect can become &quot;like&quot; the active intellect, thereby attaining perfection. It is only by this process that a human soul may survive death, and live on in the afterlife.

According to al-Farabi, the afterlife is not the personal experience commonly conceived of by religious traditions such as Islam and Christianity. Any individual or distinguishing features of the soul are annihilated after the death of the body; only the rational faculty survives (and then, only if it has attained perfection), which becomes one with all other rational souls within the agent intellect and enters a realm of pure intelligence. Henry Corbin compares this eschatology with that of the Ismaili Neo-Platonists, for whom this process initiated the next grand cycle of the universe. However, Deborah Black mentions we have cause to be skeptical as to whether this was the mature and developed view of al-Farabi, as later thinkers such as Ibn Tufayl, Averroes and Avempace would assert that he repudiated this view in his commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics, which has been lost to modern experts.

=== Psychology, the soul and prophetic knowledge ===
In his treatment of the human soul, al-Farabi draws on a basic Aristotelian outline, which is informed by the commentaries of later Greek thinkers. He says it is composed of four faculties: The &quot;appetitive&quot; (the desire for, or aversion to an object of sense), the &quot;sensitive&quot; (the perception by the senses of corporeal substances), the &quot;imaginative&quot; (the faculty which retains images of sensible objects after they have been perceived, and then separates and combines them for a number of ends), and the &quot;rational&quot;, which is the faculty of intellection. It is the last of these which is unique to human beings and distinguishes them from plants and animals. It is also the only part of the soul to survive the death of the body. Noticeably absent from these scheme are internal senses, such as common sense, which would be discussed by later philosophers such as Avicenna and Averroes.

Special attention must be given to al-Farabi&#x27;s treatment of the soul&#x27;s &quot;imaginative&quot; faculty, which is essential to his interpretation of prophethood and prophetic knowledge. In addition to its ability to retain and manipulate sensible images of objects, he gives the imagination the function of imitation. By this he means the capacity to represent an object with an image other than its own. In other words, to imitate &quot;x&quot; is to imagine &quot;x&quot; by associating it with sensible qualities that do not describe its own appearance. This extends the representative ability of the imagination beyond sensible forms and to include temperaments, emotions, desires and even immaterial intelligibles or abstract universals, as happens when, for example, one associates &quot;evil&quot; with &quot;darkness&quot;. The Prophet, in addition to his own intellectual capacity, has a very strong imaginative faculty, which allows him to receive an overflow of intelligibles from the agent intellect (the tenth intellect in the emanational cosmology). These intelligibles are then associated with symbols and images, which allow him to communicate abstract truths in a way that can be understood by ordinary people. Therefore what makes prophetic knowledge unique is not its content, which is also accessible to philosophers through demonstration and intellection, but rather the form that it is given by the prophet&#x27;s imagination.

=== Practical philosophy (ethics and politics) ===

The practical application of philosophy was a major concern expressed by al-Farabi in many of his works, and while the majority of his philosophical output has been influenced by Aristotelian thought, his practical philosophy was unmistakably based on that of Plato. In a similar manner to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, al-Farabi emphasized that philosophy was both a theoretical and practical discipline; labeling those philosophers who do not apply their erudition to practical pursuits as &quot;futile philosophers&quot;. The ideal society, he wrote, is one directed towards the realization of &quot;true happiness&quot; (which can be taken to mean philosophical enlightenment) and as such, the ideal philosopher must hone all the necessary arts of rhetoric and poetics to communicate abstract truths to the ordinary people, as well as having achieved enlightenment himself. Al-Farabi compared the philosopher&#x27;s role in relation to society with a physician in relation to the body; the body&#x27;s health is affected by the &quot;balance of its humours&quot; just as the city is determined by the moral habits of its people. The philosopher&#x27;s duty, he wrote, was to establish a &quot;virtuous&quot; society by healing the souls of the people, establishing justice and guiding them towards &quot;true happiness&quot;.

Of course, al-Farabi realized that such a society was rare and required a very specific set of historical circumstances to be realized, which means very few societies could ever attain this goal. He divided those &quot;vicious&quot; societies, which have fallen short of the ideal &quot;virtuous&quot; society, into three categories: ignorant, wicked and errant. &quot;Ignorant&quot; societies have, for whatever reason, failed to comprehend the purpose of human existence, and have supplanted the pursuit of happiness for another (inferior) goal, whether this be wealth, sensual gratification or power. Al-Farabi mentions &quot;weeds&quot; in the virtuous society: those people who try to undermine its progress towards the true human end. The best known Arabic source for al-Farabi&#x27;s political philosophy is his work titled, &quot;Ara Ahl al-Madina al-fadila&quot;.

Although some consider al-Farabi to be a political idealism, Whether or not al-Farabi actually intended to outline a political programme in his writings remains a matter of dispute amongst academics. Henry Corbin, who considers al-Farabi to be a crypto-Shi&#x27;ite, says that his ideas should be understood as a &quot;prophetic philosophy&quot; instead of being interpreted politically. On the other hand, Charles Butterworth contends that nowhere in his work does al-Farabi speak of a prophet-legislator or revelation (even the word philosophy is scarcely mentioned), and the main discussion that takes place concerns the positions of &quot;king&quot; and &quot;statesmen&quot;. Occupying a middle position is David Reisman, who, like Corbin, believes that al-Farabi did not want to expound a political doctrine (although he does not go so far to attribute it to Islamic Gnosticism either). He argues that al-Farabi was using different types of society as examples, in the context of an ethical discussion, to show what effect correct or incorrect thinking could have. Lastly, Joshua Parens argues that al-Farabi was slyly asserting that a pan-Islamic society could not be made, by using reason to show how many conditions (such as moral and deliberative virtue) would have to be met, thus leading the reader to conclude that humans are not fit for such a society. Some other authors such as Mykhaylo Yakubovych argue that for al-Farabi, religion (&quot;milla&quot;) and philosophy (&quot;falsafa&quot;) constituted the same praxeological value (i.e. basis for &quot;amal al-fadhil&quot;—&quot;virtuous deed&quot;), while its epistemological level (&quot;ilm&quot;—&quot;knowledge&quot;) was different.

<text>Bessie Love (born Juanita Horton; September 10, 1898April 26, 1986) was an American-British actress who achieved prominence playing innocent, young girls and wholesome leading ladies in silent and early sound films. Her acting career spanned nearly seven decades—from silent film to sound film, including theatre, radio, and television—and her performance in &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; (1929) earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

== Early life ==

Love was born Juanita Horton in Midland, Texas, to John Cross Horton and Emma Jane Horton (&quot;&quot; Savage). Her father was a cowboy and bartender, while her mother worked in and managed restaurants. She attended school in Midland until she was in the eighth grade, when her family moved to Arizona, New Mexico, and then to California, where they settled in Hollywood. When in Hollywood, her father became a chiropractor, and her mother worked at the Jantzen&#x27;s Knitwear and Bathing Suits factory.

== Career ==

=== The silent era ===

==== 1915–20: Young ingenue ====

In June 1915, while a student at Los Angeles High School, Horton went to the set of a film to meet with actor Tom Mix, who had recommended that she visit him if she wanted to &quot;get into pictures&quot;. However, when Mix was unavailable, she was advised to meet with pioneering film director D.W. Griffith, who placed her under personal contract. When it was decided that her given name was too long for theater marquees and too difficult to pronounce, Griffith&#x27;s associate Frank Woods gave Horton the stage name Bessie Love: &quot;Bessie, because any child can pronounce it. And Love, because we want everyone to love her!&quot; Love dropped out of high school to pursue her film career, but she completed her diploma in 1919.

Griffith gave her a small role in his &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916). Although &quot;Intolerance&quot; was her first performance to be filmed, it was her ninth film to be released. The first films Love made were with Griffith&#x27;s Fine Arts company, yet &quot;Intolerance&quot; was the only film that he formally directed.

Her &quot;first role of importance&quot;—in the second of her films to be released—was in &quot;The Flying Torpedo&quot; (1916). She later appeared opposite William S. Hart in &quot;The Aryan&quot; and with Douglas Fairbanks in &quot;The Good Bad-Man&quot;, &quot;Reggie Mixes In&quot;, and &quot;The Mystery of the Leaping Fish&quot; (all 1916). This string of appearances and supporting roles led to her first starring role, in &quot;A Sister of Six&quot; (1916). In her early career, she was likened to Mary Pickford, and was called &quot;Our Mary&quot; by Griffith.

In early 1918, Love left Fine Arts for a better contract with Pathé. After the Pathé films were unsuccessful, she signed a nine-film contract with Vitagraph later that year, all of which were directed by David Smith. Her performances often received positive reviews, but her films often were shown at smaller movie theaters, which impacted the growth of her career.

==== 1921–28: Dramatic actress ====
Upon the completion of her Vitagraph contract, Love became a free agent. She took an active role in the management of her career, and was represented by Gerald C. Duffy, the former editor of &quot;Picture-Play Magazine&quot;.
Love sought roles that were different from the little girls she had portrayed earlier in her career when under contract to studios. She played Asian women in &quot;The Vermilion Pencil&quot; (1922) and &quot;The Purple Dawn&quot; (1923); a drug-addicted mother in &quot;Human Wreckage&quot; (1923); a woman accused of murder in &quot;The Woman on the Jury&quot; (1924); an underworld flapper in &quot;Those Who Dance&quot; (1924); and versions of her real-life self in &quot;Night Life in Hollywood&quot; (1922), &quot;Souls for Sale&quot; (1923), and &quot;Mary of the Movies&quot; (1923).

As a film star, she was expected to entertain studio executives at parties, so she learned to sing, dance, and play the ukulele. She gradually honed these skills and later performed them onscreen and on the stage. Because of her performance in &quot;The King on Main Street&quot; (1925), Love is credited with being the first person to dance the Charleston on film, popularizing it in the United States. Her technique was documented in instructional guides, including a series of photographs by Edward Steichen. She subsequently performed the dance the following year in &quot;The Song and Dance Man&quot;.

In 1925, she starred in &quot;The Lost World&quot;, a science fiction adventure based on the novel of the same title by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In 1927, she appeared in the successful &quot;Dress Parade&quot;, and was so impressed by her experiences on location that she wrote the unpublished novel &quot;Military Mary&quot;. A year later, she starred in &quot;The Matinee Idol&quot;, a romantic comedy directed by a young Frank Capra. Despite these successes, Love&#x27;s career was on the decline. She lived frugally so she could afford lessons in singing and dancing.

=== The sound era and stage work ===

==== 1929–30: Musical comedy star ====

Love toured with a musical revue for sixteen weeks, which was so physically demanding that she broke a rib. The experience she gained on the vaudeville stage singing and dancing in three performances a day prepared her for the introduction of sound films. She appeared in the successful sound musical short film &quot;The Swell Head&quot; in early 1928, and was signed to MGM later that year.

In 1929, she appeared in her first feature-length sound film, the musical &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot;. Her performance earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and the success of the film resulted in a five-year contract with MGM and an increase in her weekly salary from to $3,000 ()—$1,000 more than her male co-star Charles King.

She appeared in several other early musicals, including 1929&#x27;s &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot; and 1930&#x27;s &quot;Chasing Rainbows&quot;, &quot;Good News&quot;, and &quot;They Learned About Women&quot;. Her success in these musicals earned her the title &quot;the screen&#x27;s first musical comedy star.&quot;

==== 1931–43: Semi-retirement ====
However, the success of musical films waned, again putting her career in decline. Love is quoted as saying of her career: &quot;I guess I&#x27;m through. They don&#x27;t seem to want me any more.&quot; She shifted focus to her personal life, marrying in December 1929.

She semi-retired from films, and traveled with a musical revue that included clips from her films &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Revue&quot;, and &quot;Chasing Rainbows&quot;. While on tour, she learned she was pregnant with her daughter, who was born in 1932. Love stopped her stage work to raise her daughter. In 1935, Love moved to England, briefly returning to the United States in 1936 to obtain a divorce.

During World War II in Britain, when it was difficult to find employment as an actress, Love worked as the script supervisor on the film drama &quot;San Demetrio London&quot; (1943). She also worked for the American Red Cross.

==== 1944–83: Working actress ====
Towards the end of the war, Love began acting again, this time primarily in the theater and on BBC radio as a member of their Drama Repertory Company; she also played small roles in British films, often as an American tourist. Stage work included such productions as &quot;Love in Idleness&quot; (1944) and &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (1947). She wrote and performed in &quot;The Homecoming&quot;, a semiautobiographical play, which opened in Perth, Scotland in 1958. Film work included &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; (1954) with Humphrey Bogart, and Ealing Studios&#x27; &quot;Nowhere to Go&quot; (1958), and &quot;Next to No Time&quot;, 1958. She had supporting roles in &quot;The Greengage Summer&quot; (1961) starring Kenneth More, the James Bond thriller &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969), and John Schlesinger&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (1971). In addition to playing the mother of Vanessa Redgrave&#x27;s titular character in &quot;Isadora&quot; (1968), Love also served as dialect coach to the actress.

On television, Love appeared in dozens of episodes of British television shows in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. In October 1963, she became the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; when host Eamonn Andrews surprised her at the stage door of &quot;Never Too Late&quot; after its London opening. Guests included &quot;London Scrapbook&quot; director Derrick De Marney, her &quot;Forget Me Not&quot; (1922) co-star Gareth Hughes, actor Percy Marmont, her friend and &quot;Those Who Dance&quot; (1924) co-star Blanche Sweet, and her daughter Patricia.

Love appeared in John Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;West of Suez&quot; (1971), and as &quot;Aunt Pittypat&quot; in a large-scale musical version of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1972) and as an &quot;American Lady&quot; in &quot;Vampyres&quot; (1974). She also played Maud Cunard in the TV miniseries &quot;Edward &amp; Mrs. Simpson&quot; in 1978. Her film work continued through the seventies with movies like &quot;The Ritz&quot; (1976), &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (1971), and &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1981), and into the 1980s with roles in &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1981), &quot;Reds&quot; (1981), &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; (1981), and her final film &quot;The Hunger&quot; (1983).

== Personal life ==

Love married then-stockbroker William Hawks at St. James&#x27; Episcopal Church in South Pasadena, California on December 27, 1929. Blanche Sweet was her matron of honor; Bebe Daniels, Carmel Myers, Norma Shearer, and Hawks&#x27;s sister-in-law Mary Astor were among her bridesmaids; and Irving Thalberg and Hawks&#x27;s brother Howard served as ushers. Adrian had designed a wedding dress for Love, but she instead wore a silk charmeuse gown by Howard Greer. The ceremony was attended by such celebrities as Cecil Beaton, Ronald Colman, Cecil B. DeMille, Hedda Hopper, Laura La Plante, Harold Lloyd, Anita Loos, Ramon Novarro, and William Powell, and it was mobbed by a crowd of 25,000. The wedding and reception were documented by the press and by Beaton in his &quot;Diaries&quot;, where he wrote that Love &quot;looked like a terrified bird&quot; but &quot;radiated love&quot;.

Following their wedding, the couple lived at the Havenhurst Apartments in Hollywood, and their only child, Patricia, was born in 1932. Four years later, the couple divorced.

Love moved to England with her daughter in 1935, a year before her divorce was final. Her life in England kept her out of the eye of her American fans, which resulted in the American press erroneously reporting her as dead multiple times. Love became a British subject in the late 1960s. Love was a Christian Scientist.

=== Later years and death ===
After several years of declining health, Love died at the Mount Vernon Hospital in Northwood, London, from natural causes on April 26, 1986.

== Legacy ==
===Honors===

For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Love was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 at 6777 Hollywood Boulevard.

===Cinema===
In Damien Chazelle&#x27;s 2022 film &quot;Babylon&quot;, fellow Academy Award nominee Margot Robbie wears overalls with nothing underneath, which pays homage to a famous photo of Love.

===Portraiture===
Portraits of Love are preserved in public and private collections, including those of the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., and the National Portrait Gallery in London.

Cartoonist Alex Gard created a caricature of Love for Sardi&#x27;s, the famed restaurant in Manhattan&#x27;s Theater District. It is now part of the Billy Rose Theatre Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. A Vargas illustration of Love as a young woman appeared in &quot;Playboy&quot; – published in December 1978 when Love was 80 years old.

Despite her demure public image, Love was photographed in the nude by James Abbe and Clarence Sinclair Bull, and in sheer fabric by Edwin Bower Hesser, who had also photographed Jean Harlow in a similar fashion. These images have been shown in exhibitions of these artists&#x27; work.

===Interviews and archives===
Love periodically was interviewed by film historians, and was featured in the television documentary series &quot;The Hollywood Greats&quot; (1978) and &quot;Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film&quot; (1980), both about early filmmaking in Hollywood. She also loaned materials from her personal collection to museums. In 1962, she began contributing articles about her experiences to &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;. In 1977, she published an autobiography entitled &quot;From Hollywood with Love&quot;.

<text>Abai Qūnanbaiūly ( ; ; ) was a Kazakh poet, composer and Hanafi Maturidi theologian philosopher. He was also a cultural reformer toward European and Russian cultures on the basis of enlightened Islam. Among Kazakhs he is known simply as Abai.

== Early life and education ==
Abai was born in Karauyl village in Chingiz volost of Semipalatinsk uyezd of the Russian Empire (this is now in Abay District of East Kazakhstan). He was the son of Qunanbai and Uljan, his father&#x27;s second wife. They named him Ibrahim, as the family was Muslim, and he stuck with the name for the first few years of his life.
Ibrahim first studied at a local madrasah under Mullah Ahmed Ryza. During his early childhood years in Ryza&#x27;s tutelage, he received the nickname &quot;Abai&quot; (which means &quot;careful&quot;), a nickname that stayed with him for the rest of his life. His father was wealthy enough to send Abai to a Russian secondary school in Semipalatinsk. There he read the writings of Mikhail Lermontov and Alexander Pushkin, which were influential to his own development as a writer. Moreover, he was fond of reading eastern poetry, including the Shahnameh and One Thousand and One Nights. 
== Contributions ==
Abai&#x27;s main contribution to Kazakh culture and folklore lies in his poetry, which expresses great nationalism and grew out of Kazakh folk culture. Before him, most Kazakh poetry was oral, echoing the nomadic habits of the people of the Kazakh steppes. During Abai&#x27;s lifetime, however, a number of important socio-political and socio-economic changes occurred. influence continued to grow in Kazakhstan, resulting in greater educational possibilities as well as exposure to a number of different philosophies, whether Russian, Western or Asian. Abai Qunanbaiuly steeped himself in the cultural and philosophical history of these newly opened geographies. In this sense, Abai&#x27;s creative poetry affected the philosophical theological thinking of educated Kazakhs.
==Legacy==

On 9 May 2012, after two days of protests in Moscow following Vladimir Putin&#x27;s inauguration as President of the Russian Federation for the third term, protesters set up camp near the monument to Abai Qunanbaiuly on the Chistoprudny Boulevard in central Moscow, close to the embassy of Kazakhstan. The statue quickly became a reference point for the protest&#x27;s participants. OccupyAbai was among the top ranking hashtags on Twitter for several days thanks to Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny who set up a meeting with his followers next to Abai Qunanbaiuly&#x27;s monument in Moscow that he called &quot;a monument to some unknown Kazakh&quot;. This spurred a wave of indignation among ethnic Kazakhs, who highly esteem Abai. This also brought Abai&#x27;s poetry into the top 10 AppStore downloads.

<doc id="175056" wikidata="Q312903" url="?curid=175056" title="Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma">
<text>Alexander Farnese (, ; 27 August 1545 – 3 December 1592) was an Italian noble and , who was Duke of Parma, Piacenza and Castro from 1586 to 1592, as well as Governor of the Spanish Netherlands from 1578 to 1592. Nephew to King Philip II of Spain, he served in the Battle of Lepanto and the subsequent campaigns of the Holy League against the Ottoman Empire, being latter appointed general of the Spanish army during the Dutch revolt until his death in 1592. During the French Wars of Religion, he decisively relieved Paris for the Catholic League.

His talents as a commander, strategist and organizator earned him the regard of contemporaries and historians as the greatest general of his age, as well as one of the best in history. He stood out for his equal proficiency at war and diplomacy. Under his leadership, Philip II&#x27;s army achieved the most comprehensive successes in the history of the Eighty Years&#x27; War, capturing more than thirty towns between 1581 and 1587 before being diverted from the Netherlands to the French theater. His campaigns gave Spain back permanent control of the southern provinces, establishing the cultural and religious separation which would eventually become the nation of Belgium.

== Early life: 1545–1577 ==

Alessandro, born 27 August 1545, was the son of Duke Ottavio Farnese of Parma (a grandson of Pope Paul III) and Margaret of Austria (an illegitimate daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor and king of Spain Charles V). He had a twin brother, Carlo, who died in Rome on 7 October 1549. He and his mother, the half-sister of Philip II of Spain and Don Juan, left Rome for Parma in 1550. When Margaret was appointed Governor of the Netherlands, Alessandro accompanied her to Brussels in 1556 and was delivered to Philip II to ensure the loyalty of the Farnese. While in the King&#x27;s custody, he visited the English royal court and then went to Spain to be raised and educated with his cousin, the ill-fated Don Carlos and his half-uncle, Don Juan, both of whom were about the same age as himself.

In 1565 his marriage with Maria of Portugal, which ended his stint as Philip II&#x27;s hostage, was celebrated in Brussels with great splendour. He commanded three galleys during the Battle of Lepanto (1571) and the subsequent campaigns against the Turks. It was seven years before he again had the opportunity to display his great military talents. During that time the provinces of the Netherlands had revolted against Spanish rule. Don Juan, who had been sent as governor-general to restore order, found difficulties in dealing with William the Silent, who had succeeded in uniting all the provinces in common resistance to King Philip II.

== Governor-General of the Netherlands ==

In the autumn of 1577 shortly after his wife&#x27;s death, Farnese led Spanish reinforcements from Italy along the Spanish Road to join Don Juan, and it was his able strategy and prompt decision at a critical moment that decisively won the Battle of Gembloux in early 1578. Shortly thereafter was the Siege of Zichem (Dutch) where the garrison was put to the sword and the town was sacked. This incident is considered to be the biggest stain on Farnese&#x27;s otherwise chivalrous career. Next was the five-day Siege of Nivelles (Dutch) (French) in March 1578. The example of Zichem encouraged the citizens to capitulate so quickly. That summer, Farnese managed to prevent the defeat at the Battle of Rijmenam from being decisive.

In October 1578, Don Juan, whose health had broken down, died. Phillip II appointed Farnese to take his place as Captain-General of the Army of Flanders and appointed his mother Margaret as Governor-General. This was unacceptable to Alexander; he demanded to be both Captain-General and Governor-General or he would resign thus leaving military matters entirely in Margaret&#x27;s hands. Philip eventually capitulated and after four years, Margaret returned to Parma.

Upon Don Juan&#x27;s death, Farnese was confronted with a difficult situation. Perceiving that his opponents were divided between Catholic and Protestant, Fleming and Walloon, he skillfully worked to exploit these divisions. By this means, he regained the allegiance of the Walloon provinces for the king. Through the treaty of Arras, January 1579, he secured the support of the &quot;Malcontents&quot; (the Catholic nobles of the south) for the royal cause. The rebels in the seven northern provinces then formed the Union of Utrecht, formally abjuring Phillip&#x27;s rule and pledging to fight to the end.

As soon as he had secured a base of operations in Hainaut and Artois, Farnese set himself in earnest to the task of reconquering Brabant and Flanders by force of arms, beginning with Maastricht. Farnese commenced the Siege of Maastricht on 12 March 1579. He ordered his troops to sap the walls. The inhabitants of Maastricht were also digging to reach the Spanish tunnels. Deep underground the fighting continued, hundreds of Spanish soldiers died as boiling oil was poured into their tunnels. Others died because of a lack of oxygen when the Dutch defenders ignited fires within them. Another 500 Spanish soldiers died when a mine, which they planned to use to blow up the wall, exploded prematurely.

On the night of 29 June, Farnese&#x27;s men managed to get into the city while the exhausted defenders were asleep. Since the city had not surrendered after the walls had been breached, laws of warfare in the 16th century gave the victors the right to loot the conquered city. The Spanish looted the city for three days during which time many civilians lost their lives. The looting was particularly violent, perhaps because Farnese was in bed with a fever during those three days.

In adherence to the treaty of Arras, the Spanish troops were expelled from the country so Alexander only had the Walloon troops available for the Siege of Tournai (Dutch). The difficulties encountered with the ragtag troops during that siege helped convince the Walloon lords to allow for the return of foreign, more importantly, Spanish troops.

In a war composed mostly of sieges rather than battles, Parma proved his mettle. His strategy was to offer generous terms for surrender: there would be no massacres or looting; historic urban privileges were retained; there was a full pardon and amnesty; return to the Catholic Church would be gradual.
The apex of Alexander Farnese&#x27;s career was when he laid siege to the great seaport of Antwerp. The town was open to the sea, strongly fortified, and defended with resolute determination and courage by its citizens. The latter were led by the famous Marnix van St. Aldegonde and assisted by an ingenious Italian engineer named Federigo Giambelli. The siege began in 1584 and called forth all of Farnese&#x27;s military genius. He cut off all access to Antwerp from the sea by constructing a bridge of boats across the Scheldt from Kallo (then spelt &quot;Calloo&quot;) to Oordam, in spite of the desperate efforts of the besieged townspeople. The terms offered included the clause that all Protestants had to leave the city within four years. This disciplined capture and occupation of the town should not be confused with the bloody events of the Spanish Fury on 4 November 1576. Farnese avoided the mistakes of his predecessors including Don Luis de Requesens. With the Fall of Antwerp, and with Mechelen and Brussels already in the hands of Farnese, the whole of the southern Netherlands was once more placed under the authority of Philip II. Both Holland and Zeeland, whose geographical position made them unassailable except by water, were hard-pressed to retain the territory.
Alexander pressed operations in the regions of the Meuse and the Rhine so as to maintain trade with Germany and prepare a gateway for winning Holland and Zeeland. Unfortunately for the prince, Phillip II&#x27;s parsimonious disbursement of money started having its effect in the campaigns following Antwerp&#x27;s conquest. The first notable Spanish defeat under Farnese&#x27;s command came at his first attempt to take control of Grave. In December 1585, with the growing food shortage, Farnese marched his troops towards the Rhine and Meuse regions so as to spare Flanders, Brabant and the Walloon provinces the burden of feeding them and, while there, undertake operations to secure trade along those rivers. That winter was nearly disastrous for Farnese&#x27;s army were it not for the &quot;Miracle of Empel&quot;. Nevertheless, by 7 June the Siege of Grave (1586) was a fait accompli. On the other hand, fortunately for Alexander, who became Duke upon his father&#x27;s death in 1586, the poorly supplied English forces, sent by Elizabeth I, were duly defeated by the Duke&#x27;s forces. The Siege of Sluis (1587) was necessary, so as to secure a safe harbour for the Armada ships, and was successful.

== Spanish Armada ==

When Alexander Farnese became Duke of Parma through the death of his father; he never ruled, instead naming his son Ranuccio as regent. He applied for leave to visit his paternal territory but Philip II would not grant it as there were no suitable candidates in the Netherlands to replace him. However, while retaining him in his command at the head of a formidable army, the king would not give his sanction to his great general&#x27;s desire to use it for the conquest of England, at the time a supporter of the rebels.

Although Farnese was not enthusiastic about the project, in November 1583, he initially believed it possible to successfully invade England from the Netherlands with a force of 30,000 troops relying mainly on the hope of a native Catholic insurrection, but emphasized to Philip II that it was imperative for three conditions to be met: the main condition was the maintenance of absolute secrecy; second, secure the possession and defence of the Dutch provinces; third, keep the French from interfering either by way of a peace agreement or by sowing division amongst the Huguenots and Catholics. Philip overruled him and solicited the Marquis of Santa Cruz to draft and present an invasion plan which evolved to become the &quot;Enterprise of England&quot;, more commonly known as the Spanish Armada. As part of the general campaign preparations, Farnese moved against Ostend and Sluis, the latter of which would be taken on August 1587.

The plan was that Parma&#x27;s troops would cross the channel in barges, protected by the Armada. Santa Cruz was appointed commander of the armada but died in early 1588 and command of the armada was given to the incompetent Duke of Medina Sidonia. The Armada entered the English Channel in the summer of that year but poor communication between Parma and the Armada&#x27;s commander made effective coordination difficult. Alexander informed Philip II that his barges were nothing more than flat-bottomed transport vessels, not warships, and he was being blockaded by English ships thus preventing him from leaving Nieuwpoort and Dunkirk. Farnese expected the Armada to clear a passage for his barges. Parma&#x27;s troops were also threatened by the presence of Dutch forces in flyboats, who hoped to destroy the barges and drown Parma&#x27;s army at sea. In contrast, Medina Sedonia expected Parma to fight his way out from the ports and meet him in the channel. The English attack on the Armada in the Battle of Gravelines (1588), followed by an unfavourable change in wind direction, made link-up impossible.

After the failure of the Armada, fortune seems to have abandoned the Duke of Parma. Farnese broke up his camp in Dunkirk in September and sent the Marquis de Renty to the island of Tholen in preparation to besiege the predominately English garrison at Bergen Op Zoom. Renty did not succeed in capturing Tholen, blaming bad weather, whereupon Farnese expressed that he should have led the expedition personally. Nevertheless, on 19 September 1588, Alexander set out from Bruges with his army to besiege Bergen Op Zoom. After a six-week siege, with winter approaching, Parma abandoned the enterprise and withdrew to Brussels, sending his troops into winter quarters.

Alexander&#x27;s final major victory in the Netherlands was Geertruidenberg, a strategic gateway to Holland. The English garrison there was in full revolt for lack of pay. An English representative offered the city to Parma and it was ultimately delivered to him on 9 April 1589.

== French Wars of Religion ==
The Duke of Parma started feeling the first effects of oedema after the failed siege of Bergen op Zoom. He had to go to the town of Spa to treat his illness for nearly six months. During this time, the Old Tercio of Lombardy had mutinied and Farnese ordered that it be dissolved. Following this incident, Alexander&#x27;s lieutenants suffered defeats in Friesland and Rheinberg.

===First expedition into France===
Farnese intended to turn his attention back to the northern Netherlands, where the Dutch rebels had regrouped, but on the night of 1–2 August 1589, Henry III of France was assassinated, and Farnese was ordered into France, in support of the Duke of Mayenne and the Catholic opposition to Protestant Henri de Navarre known also as the &quot;Béarnaise&quot;. This enabled the Dutch rebels to regain momentum in their revolt, which had been in ever deeper trouble since 1576. Parma had warned Philip II that the French incursion would endanger the gains made in the Netherlands and stated he would not accept responsibility for the losses or failures resulting from not heeding his advice.

Parma left Brussels on 6 August 1590 and ultimately arrived at Guise on 15 August. In late August, he moved to relieve Paris from the lengthy siege it had been placed under by Huguenots and Royalists loyal to Henry IV. Farnese&#x27;s main goal was simply to resupply Paris by raising the blockade, not obliterating Henry&#x27;s army. When Henry learned of the approach of Mayenne and Farnese, he broke camp to actively engage in battle. Parma had no intention of engaging in combat. He determined that capturing the fort at Lagny-sur-Marne would ensure traffic was maintained along the river Marne which was still in the hands of the Catholic League. At dawn on 5 September, Lagny was bombarded then stormed by Spanish troops who put its 800-man garrison to the sword, all within sight of Henri&#x27;s camp, a mere 12 km away. The latter abandoned the siege of Paris two days later but made one last &quot;Hail Mary&quot; attempt on 8–9 September which failed. With the course of the Marne completely open to traffic, supplies flowed into Paris for the next several days.

Keeping Paris supplied required the influx of victuals from multiple sources but most of Henri&#x27;s forces occupied the areas along the Seine and Yonne rivers so Parma decided to clear Corbeil in order to restore traffic on the Seine. The siege began on 22 September and by 16 October, the town was taken. Its garrison was put to the sword and the town was thoroughly sacked. With the siege of Paris lifted and its supply routes secured, Farnese took the road on 3 November back to the Netherlands, where Maurice of Nassau had gone on the offensive. Alexander&#x27;s withdraw was not an easy one. He had thousands of men, wagons and horses to move during foul weather with the Béarnaise harassing him the entire way. Anticipating these difficulties, the Duke arranged his columns in such a way that Henri could not rout him. Twenty days into the march, on 25 November near Amiens, Henri with his cavalry boldly charged Farnese&#x27;s column only to himself be routed beyond the river Aisne and getting wounded during the retreat. One final unsuccessful skirmish took place on 29 November where Henri was within a few hundred paces of Farnese.

Parma and Mayenne parted ways at Guise and Alexander arrived in Brussels on 4 December 1590.

===Maurice of Nassau&#x27;s offensive===
Alexander Farnese had appointed Peter Ernst von Mansfeld as acting Governor-General while he was in France. Days after Farnese&#x27;s departure for France, Mansfeld and Colonel Francisco Verdugo, operating in Friesland, began lamenting to Philip II about the lack of money, supplies, and troop mutinies, all the things Farnese had been complaining about for the past several years. By the time Farnese had returned, Maurice had regained Steenbergen, Roosendaal, Oosterhout, Turnhout, and Westerlo. Farnese&#x27;s absence brought with it a reduction in military activity on the part of the Spanish thus allowing the Dutch some time to reflect on what policies they needed to adopt that would be most effective against their enemy. This was the beginning of the Dutch Military Reforms which finally allowed them to have an even footing against the Spanish; Alexander had finally met his match in Maurice.

===Second expedition into France===
On the night of 24 July 1591, just days after engaging in the siege of Knodsenburg, Alexander Farnese received orders from Philip II to drop everything and go back to France to aid the Catholic League. Realizing the difficulties of capturing this fort, he was actually relieved to be able to honourably abandon this enterprise engaged under bad auspices. Before he could even consider another expedition to aid the League, he needed to resume his treatments at Spa whence he arrived on 1 August with his son Ranuccio. In mid-November, Alexander drafted instructions for the interim Governor-General, Mansfeld again, in addition to putting measures in place for the defence of the Netherlands while he was away. By the end of November, the Duke was in Valenciennes where he mustered his troops. Towards the middle of January 1592, Parma had rendezvoused with Mayenne and made preparations to rescue Rouen from Henri.

Before heading to Rouen, Farnese made the strategic decision to capture Neufchâtel-en-Bray. This would keep supply lines open. Finally, on 20 April, Parma arrived a few miles from Rouen where he was met by 50 cavalry sent by Villars. They informed him that Henri had lifted the siege and withdrew in the direction of Pont-de-l&#x27;Arche to entrench there.; Rouen was saved. Rather than follow Farnese&#x27;s advice and attack Henri&#x27;s camp and destroy his forces, the League&#x27;s leaders chose to capture Caudebec-en-Caux where he was subsequently wounded by a musket shot in the right forearm during the siege whilst reconnoitring the town. The wound undermined his already precarious health even more and he was forced to call his son Ranuccio to take command of the troops. Henri saw therein an opportunity to avenge the loss of Rouen. Rather than risk a full attack against the League&#x27;s forces, he took a page from Farnese&#x27;s book and decided to cut off all supply routes and starve them. The League&#x27;s army abandoned Caudebec for Yvetot. The situation was worse than at Caudebec, all the while, Farnese was seriously ill and mostly bed-ridden yet still sharp in mind. The Duke of Parma finally devised a plan to clandestinely cross the Seine in boats leaving just enough men to make Henri believe the entire army was encamped. The Catholic army was across the river and long gone by the time Henri learned of it, literally right under his nose. After returning to the Netherlands, Alexander received a letter from Pope Clement VIII on 28 June congratulating him “for rescuing the Catholic Army.” Farnese quickly made his way back to Spa for yet more treatments.

== Death ==
===Alexander Farnese&#x27;s removal from office===
Ever since the failed armada campaign against England, Spanish agents and courtiers in Philip II&#x27;s court who were jealous of Farnese&#x27;s success had been engaged in a malicious campaign to discredit the Duke of Parma in the eyes of the king. After Farnese&#x27;s return from his second French campaign, the king, who had always favoured his nephew Alexander, allowed these complaints and accusations to influence his opinion. This change in sentiment caused the king to order the duke removed from his post in the Netherlands. The sovereign drafted a recall letter on 20 February 1592, while Farnese was marching on Rouen, and tasked Juan Pacheco de Toledo, II marqués de Cerralbo, to personally deliver it to the duke upon his return to Flanders. Cerrablo died along the way. The king then assigned Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes to carry out this mission. The date of the recall letter was changed to 28 June 1592. Given Philip II&#x27;s nature toward duplicitous intrigue, the king reassured Farnese that everything was fine, all the while arranging for his recall from Flanders. The duke knew nothing about these machinations and by October was feeling well enough to return to Brussels only to learn that he was ordered to aid the League yet again.

===Final expedition into France===
Fully aware of his state of health, the Duke of Parma, nevertheless, prepared for this campaign by arranging for loans and sumptuous quarters in Paris so as to give the appearance of a powerful representative of the King of Spain. He had written his last will and testament, repeatedly went to confession and took holy communion, and sent his son back to Parma so that, upon his death, the Farnesian States would not be deprived of a ruler.

The duke left Brussels on 11 November, arriving in Arras where, on 2 December 1592, he died at the age of 47.

His mortal remains were dressed in a Capuchin habit, moved to Parma and buried in the Capuchin church, next to his wife&#x27;s tomb. Later, their mortal remains were moved to the crypt of the Basilica of the Madonna della Steccata, where they are still found today. His death spared him from seeing the provision by which he was relieved of the post of Governor-General.

In January 2020, the Duke&#x27;s remains were exhumed in a bid to clarify the circumstances of his death which were ultimately determined to be pneumonia.

== Issue ==

From his marriage with Infanta Maria of Portugal, also known as Maria of Guimarães, he had three children:

=== Illegitimate issue ===
Alessandro Farnese had an affair with Françoise de Renty (a.k.a., &quot;La Belle Franchine&quot;), a young Flemish noblewoman, confirmed by an unpublished letter of instruction from Parma, contained in the manuscript at the Bibliotecca Nazionale di Napoli, Brancacciani F1, ff. 68–91v, to Pietro Caetani, on his way to serve Alessandro Farnese in the Netherlands, on how he should behave with her:
 Although there is nothing to say with certainty about children from this relationship, according to Bertini, Farnese arranged for, and gave incentives to, Count Jean-Charles de Gavre, a nobleman in Alessandro&#x27;s household, to marry Françoise in 1586. Considering that the couple&#x27;s first child, Marie-Alexandrine-Françoise de Gavre, was born soon afterwards in 1587, that her name (Alexandrine) is not found amongst either parent&#x27;s ancestors, and the influence Françoise had over Farnese, it is quite possible that he was the child&#x27;s biological father.

<text>Bonampak (known anciently as &quot;Ak&#x27;e&quot; or, in its immediate area as &quot;Usiij Witz&quot;, &#x27;Vulture Hill&#x27;) is an ancient Maya archaeological site in the Mexican state of Chiapas. The site is approximately south of the larger site of the people Yaxchilan, under which Bonampak was a dependency, and the border with Guatemala. While the site is not overly spatial or abundant in architectural size, it is well known for the murals located within the three roomed Structure 1 (&quot;The Temple of the Murals)&quot;. The construction of the site&#x27;s structures dates to the Late Classic period (c. AD 580 to 800). The Bonampak murals are noteworthy for being among the best-preserved Maya murals.

The site, lying close to a tributary of the Usumacinta River, was seen by non-Mayans in 1946. Precisely who was first of the non-Mayans to see it is a matter of speculation, but it was either two American travelers, Herman Charles (Carlos) Frey and John Bourne, or photographer/explorer Giles Healey. The Americans were led to the ruins by the local Lacandon Maya who still visited the site to pray in the ancient temples. Giles Healey was the first to be shown the huge paintings covering the walls of one of the structure&#x27;s three rooms. The paintings show the story of a single battle and its victorious outcome.

==History of the polity==
Bird Jaguar in the early 5th century fought against K&#x27;inich Tatb&#x27;u Skull I in Yaxchilan, and lost his freedom. Other nobles were captured in a later war against Knot-eye Jaguar I. In 514, Knot-eye Jaguar I was himself taken captive (by Ruler C of Piedras Negras), giving Bonampak some respite; but after 526, his successor K&#x27;inich Tatb&#x27;u Skull II attacked Bonampak again and captured more lords.

Bonampak by 600 CE had become a satellite of Yaxchilan. In that time, the &quot;ajaw&quot; of Yaxchilan installed Yajaw Chan Muwaan I as lord in Bonampak. Subsequent &quot;ajawob&quot; reconstructed the site to orient toward the metropolis. C. 790 CE, Yaxchilan&#x27;s king Shield Jaguar III oversaw the installation of Chan Muwaan II, and hired Yaxchilano artisans to commemorate it in &quot;Structure I&quot;&#x27;s murals. Bonampak collapsed with Yaxchilan in the 9th century.

==Temple of the Murals==
Structure 1:

Structure 1 at Bonampak, built at the end of the eighth century A.D. measures 16 meters long, four meters deep, and seven meters tall, and is constructed atop a T-shaped platform. Although there is no evidence to support the claim, some speculate that it may have also had a roofcomb, such as can be seen on Structure 33 at nearby Yaxchilan. Structurally symmetrical, balanced and stable, it is composed of three separate rooms, which contain murals that narrate the events surrounding the accession to the throne by Chooj, son of Bonampak ruler Yajaw Chaan Muwan, and grandson of Aj Sak Teles. Although there has been some disagreement as to the temporal sequence of events, it is generally agreed that the narrative should be viewed in chronological order, beginning in Room 1 (scene of tribute, dressing, dance, mummery and musical performance); then on to Room 2 (scene of violent conflict, and a display in which a human cull is presented, tortured and killed in the company of the highest members of court and upper echelons of the victorious force); and, finally, to Room 3 (scene of a dance, with observers, and ritual bloodletting). In total, there are some 281 human figures represented within the three rooms, many with captions (approximately 1/3 of the figures are named, while another 10 percent of the figures have blank captions, and slightly more than half have no caption at all). A few theories as to why some captions were left blank include deaths or political realignment, an interruption of the murals related to the ostensible Lowland Maya collapse during the period of Structure 1&#x27;s creation, and the possibility that it became politically impolite to name certain figures. The planning and execution of the Bonampak murals points to a large team of specialists, and
not to one solitary genius. This team would have included plasterers, pigment preparers, and possibly calligraphers, in addition to the painters and planners whose artistic conception is most visible on the walls.

The exterior of Structure 1, although poorly preserved, was once richly painted in bright hues of Maya blue, blue-green, red, and yellow. Indeed, almost everything would have been covered in paint, as even the floors in each room were painted black. Only the top surfaces of the interior benches appear to have been left unpainted. In addition to the various colors applied, there were further artistic elements on the facade of Structure 1. Just below the binder molding, there are remnants of a single band of some eighty glyphs that wrapped around the building, and broad vertical bands of red, interchanged with areas of unpainted white stucco. Essentially, the artists at Bonampak framed the lower course of the exterior of Structure 1 as if it were a Maya vase; more specifically, this was done in the codex-style vases of the Petén, and not mirroring those of the Usumacinta region where Bonampak is located. Above each room there is a small niche housing a seated figure—likely representations of a ruling lord. Between these niches there were two larger stucco scenes, only one of which has survived the ravages of time. Hinting at what is depicted within on the murals, the image depicts a figure in a forward stride toward a captive on his knees before him, his hair being gripped firmly by his vanquisher. On the east and west sides of the building, the upper course featured additional seated figures within niches set atop long-snouted god heads—these still have some remnants of red paint visible. Finally, the doorway to each room features a carved lintel of a warrior subduing a captive. Lintel 1 (Room 1) depicts Yajaw Chaan Muwan, ruler of Bonampak, capturing an enemy on January 12, A.D. 787 (Longcount date: 9.17.16.3.12, 8 Eb 10 K’umk’u); Lintel 2 (Room 2) likely shows the overlord from Yaxchilan, Shield Jaguar IV, on January 4, A.D. 787 (Longcount date: 9.17.16.3.8, 4 Lamat 6 K’umk’u); and Lintel 3 (Room 3) displays Aj Sak Teles, probably on July 25, A.D. 780 (Longcount date: 9.17.9.11.14, 3 Ix 2 Yax). It is worth noting that the height of each doorway is only roughly 5’ 7” (1.75 meters), and around 3 feet wide. Thus, it is clear that no Maya noble in full regalia would have ever entered these rooms without a bow of deferential respect.

In 1996, a team from Yale University led by professor Mary Miller began &quot;The Bonampak Documentation Project&quot;, which included making an even more detailed study, photographic record, and reproductions of the murals. These reproductions, completed by artists Heather Hurst and Leonard Ashby, bring to life many details, thanks to infrared photographs, that can no longer be seen with the naked eye. Most saliently, the images captured many glyphs that were previously unknown, lost either to natural erosion, or due to the many failed attempts at preservation, some of which did far more damage than conservation. For a more detailed description about &quot;The Bonampak Documentation Project&quot;, and a thorough discussion on the murals, see Mary Miller and Claudia Brittenham&#x27;s 2013 seminal work on the subject titled, &quot;The Spectacle of the Late Maya &quot;Court: Reflections on the Murals of Bonampak. &quot;

*Note: The numbered human figures (HF) mentioned below can be found in the aforementioned publication on page 73, in addition to excellent large foldouts in the back of the book.

Room 1:

This is the scene of a regal event: the acknowledgement, in front of the court and visiting dignitaries, by the Bonampak ruler, Yajaw Chaan Muwan, of his son&#x27;s right to rule. There are 77 human figures in this first room fulfilling various functions within the narrative. Some of the actors that capture immediate attention are the elegantly costumed figures on the lower register of the south wall (HF&#x27;s 62, 63, and 64). The large, feathered back racks, in addition to the various jaguar, quetzal and serpent elements in their costumes, underscore the importance of these figures. These are the three &quot;ch’oks&quot; (young heirs). It was at first thought that the central figure (HF 63) was the ruler of Bonampak, Yajaw Chaan Muwan. However, further readings of the accompanying glyphs show this figure to be the future ruler, Chooj, who is in between his two brothers: Bird Balam and Aj Balam. With heels raised, all three brothers are in the middle of a ritual dance. To the viewer&#x27;s left of HF 62, beginning on the south wall and leading to the east wall, there are several figures playing instruments (rattles, drums, and turtle shells) and singing, which fill this room with celebratory music. To the viewer&#x27;s right of the three &quot;ch’oks&quot;, leading to the west wall, there are eight (regional governors). Of particular note is HF 71, standing in a familiar pose to smokers of today, as he, too, embraces a long, thin cigarette, expressing some combination of calm, lack of interest and boredom. Behind him, HF&#x27;s 73 and 74, as well as HF&#x27;s 52 and 54 on the east wall work together, holding parasols that frame the Initial Series Text right above them on the middle register. These are the only quotation marks in all of the Pre-Columbian New World. On the lower register of the north wall, still more musicians (HF&#x27;s 43 and 44) blast their trumpets, while other performers (HF&#x27;s 45–50) wear various costumes, including that of a crocodile (HF 48).

Of all the images of visiting messengers, nobles and dancers held within the upper register, a few individuals, and one recently discovered detail in particular, stand out. Conspicuously placed upon a raised platform on the upper register of the south wall, just above two holes where wooden beams had once ran through to help support the structure, stands a lone figure (HF 16) presenting a child (HF 15) to the lords. At first, many thought that this child was the young heir; however, as noted previously, the central dancing figure below (HF 63) was the heir to the throne at Bonampak. Yet, even without having decoded the glyphs next to the three festive brothers, one notices a couple of peculiarities. Firstly, the young figure is actually wearing face paint and garments that are suggestive of a girl, perhaps a wife for the future ruler. Secondly, no one is looking at the child, not even the individual holding her. In fact, he is glancing over his left shoulder into the upper register of the west wall at the figure (HF 19) sitting upon an elevated throne. This seated figure is likely Yajaw Chaan Muwan, ruler of Bonampak. It is important to mention here that the caption above this individual, like so many captions in Structure 1, was left blank. Therefore, the identification of HF 19 as Yajaw Chaan Muwan is deduced rather than known unequivocally based on a name glyph. Beneath the throne, one can view five bundles, albeit with some difficulty. It was not until Professor Mary Miller&#x27;s aforementioned &quot;Bonampak Documentation Project&quot; that scholars finally knew what these bundles contained. After analyzing infrared images of this scene, glyphs for “&quot;5 pi kakaw&quot;” were revealed. “&quot;Kakaw&quot;” was the classic Maya term for the cacao bean, and Harvard University professor David Stuart has suggested that the “&quot;pi&quot;” glyph represents units of 8,000 beans. Therefore, if this is so, it appears that there has been a tribute payment to Yajaw Chaan Muwan of 40,000 cacao beans, which is a considerable sum of wealth. Finally, in the vault across the whole scene in Room 1, the faces of the Sun God are shown as it moves across the sky. On the east wall, a large crocodilian, representing the vault of the sky, carries the myriad avatars of the Sun God upon its back.

Room 2:

This is the scene of what has been referred to as the greatest battle scene in all of Maya art. Room 2 is the largest of the three, which alludes to its greater importance. It also contains more human figures than either Room 1 or Room 2, with 139 of them. The south wall, which is the first that is viewed upon entering, along with the east and the west walls, depict warriors in the heat of battle. Bodies are intertwined on both the lower and the upper registers. Trumpets blast as the battle rages on (HF 7). As one begins to focus more and more on the individuals, a couple of
artistic elements and their symbolic meanings become clear. The ancient Maya believed that to be left-handed was a sign of femininity and weakness, thus the warriors who are shown as defeated—including already being stripped nude, with the victors gripping them by the hair—or those in the process of being defeated, are depicted as being left-handed (e.g., HF&#x27;s 61 and 67). Some are even illustrated with two left hands. To contrast this sharply, several victors are given two right hands, doubling their strength and masculinity. In addition to left-handedness, the losers are also all wearing some element of a bird—or, at least those that are still in their battle costumes, and have not yet been stripped of them. This is also indicative of defeat. The victors, on the other hand, all wear costumes with feline elements—specifically, the jaguar. Therefore, it is of no surprise to see the main character on the upper register of the south wall, Yajaw Chan Muwaan (HF 55), firmly gripping a jaguar skin-covered spear in his right hand while donning a large, extravagant jaguar headdress—which may contain a water-lily scroll—and wearing a jaguar jerkin and jaguar boots. Although it is clear that the events surrounding the ascension to the thrown of Chooj depicted in Structure 1 are narrating actual events, it is equally clear that Bonampak&#x27;s version of the actual events is more propagandistic in nature. The aforementioned outfits of the losers underscore this fact. That is, no one intending to win would enter battle wearing costumes related to defeat, nor would all of the warriors of the losing side be left-handed. Professor Mary Miller describes the battle scene of Room 2 as an “...official historical portraiture, not by any means a photographic glimpse of Maya warfare.” Above the chaotic battle, the south vault depicts three individuals within ancestor centipede cartouches. Between them are two bound captives. As one turns to view the north wall, the viewer is greeted by the sequel to the battle: torture and sacrifice of the captives taken in battle.

To view the north wall, a visitor would have sat on the
south bench above bound captives, as though becoming a part of the scene. The
north wall is one of pain and suffering. Nude and almost nude captives (only
wearing a loin cloth) are depicted in deep agony, as some of them are in the
process of getting their fingernails ripped off, or have already undergone this
torture and bleed from their wounds (HF&#x27;s 101–109). HF 101 may have even had
his teeth removed, while HF 106 has already expired, and HF 120 is only a
severed head. Yajaw Chan Muwaan is the main figure here, too, wearing only a
slightly different variant of his battle costume from the south wall. He stands
stately over his captives, while several warriors and nobles observe the
ritual, including his wife (HF 97). In the vault, directly above this scene,
are four cartouches representing various celestial imagery.

Note: During a radar survey of Structure 1 in 2010, archaeologists discovered a tomb beneath Room 2. It is small and relatively simple. It contained the body of one man between the ages of 35 and 42. It was a complete skeleton, minus the cranium, which scientists believe is simply due to natural erosion, and not evidence of beheading. The skeleton was accompanied by jade earrings, a jade necklace and bracelets, a spondylus shell pendant, two polychrome plates, an alabaster vase with a hole in the base, and a stone knife. The last two items—perforated vase and a stone knife—lead some to believe that this individual was one of the sacrifice victims depicted in Room 2. Other theories include him being a wounded warrior, or a possible relative of Yajaw Chan Muwaan, as his jewelry matched that of the nobles depicted in Room 1. It is clear that this tomb was part of the original construction of Structure 1 and was not, therefore, created at a later date.

Room 3:

This is the scene of ritual celebration for victory in battle, including bloodletting by nobles, and contains 65 human figures. As with Rooms 1 and 2, the south wall is the first to be viewed. What captures one&#x27;s attention immediately are the three elaborately dressed individuals in the upper register (HF&#x27;s 16, 21, and 24) wearing tall, green, quetzal-feathered headdress and dancers wings. These are the same brothers from Room 1, with the young heir, Chooj, in the center (HF 21). Each brother holds a bloody femur bone that has been modified into a ritual ax. Right below Chooj is another figure (HF 22) on his knees; he is also holding an ax in his right hand and another object in his left. Here is another instance where the &quot;Bonampak Documentation Project&quot; was able to decipher that which is not able to be seen by the naked eye—in this instance, the paint had been completely eroded in this area. However, the infrared images revealed that what HF 22 had in his left hand was none other than the still beating heart of the sacrificial victim below (HF 19), who is being dragged down the pyramid steps by two attendants (HF&#x27;s 18 and 20).

Covering almost the entire bottom register of the south and west walls are seven more elaborately costumed characters (HF&#x27;s 13, 15, 17, 26, 26, 27 and 28) with similar headdresses to those of the brothers above them. They are depicted with one heel raised and arms stretched out, as if captured right before a spinning dance, perhaps to imitate the flight of the quetzal. Above the entire south wall scene, set among a background of yellow —the first appearance of a color not representing reality— is a supernatural entity with square eyes, and a single frontal, pointed tooth. It lacks pupils and a real nose; behind it emerge two serpent-like supernatural entities that expel additional entities. The upper register of the west wall contains a musical procession with masked performers, carrying a dwarf (HF 42) who is lifted into the yellow background of the vault, demonstrating his connection to the supernatural world. The upper register of the east wall shows the noble women of Bonampak (HF&#x27;s 2, 5 and 6) holding stingray spines to their tongues in a bloodletting ritual. Meanwhile, a large man (HF 7) offers bloodletting supplies to the women on the throne. Of note is the fact that these individuals also seem to appear previously—HF 7 in Room 2 on the middle of the east wall; the others in Room 1 on the west wall throne scene. Above them, surrounded by yellow, another supernatural entity appears to spew blood. Turning to the north wall, one can see an almost identical supernatural in the vault as that of the south wall vault. Below, 10 &quot;ebeets&quot; (lords) dressed in white mantles engage in conversation, while nine more seated individuals below also gesticulate as they talk to one another, perhaps commenting on the performance taking place on the south wall in front of them. Finally, on the bottom register, more musicians raise their instruments skyward as part of the procession on the west wall. Room 3 engulfs the viewer in the celebration.

Professor Mary Miller wrote, &quot;Perhaps no single artifact from the ancient New World offers as complex a view of Prehispanic society as do the Bonampak paintings. No other work features so many Maya engaged in the life of the court and rendered in such great detail, making the Bonampak murals an unparalleled resource for understanding ancient society.&quot;

== Monuments ==
=== Stele 1 ===
It is located in the central part of the Great Plaza, it represents the moment of the height of Chan Muwan II, the importance of the character is reflected in the way it is represented and in the difficulty to elaborate the monument, that is, in a huge slab of stone of little thickness without suffering any fracture. With its almost 6 meters high it is one of the highest in the Mayan world. Chan Muwan II is standing and carrying a ceremonial cane, the styling of the pupil gives him a greater strength to his look; in the lower part of the stele is observed the monster of the earth from which the faces of the young god of corn emerge. A band of glyphs under the feet of the ruler refers to his genealogy, while in another vertical band the emblem glyph of the city can be observed.

=== Stele 2 ===
It is located on a low terrace right in the center of the Acropolis and next to Stela 3, it shows Chan Muwan II richly dressed in the company of two women, in front of him her mother Lady Shield Skull and behind him his wife the Lady Green Rabbit of Yaxchilán who wear a huipil. The scene revolves around the ritual of self-sacrifice, performed by the ruler who carries in his right hand a bag with copal from which the face of the bat god is seen and assisted by his mother, who carries the stingray spines to perform the piercing while his wife holds the basket with the strips of paper ready to receive the blood drops of the ruler, which will later be incinerated in honor of their deities.

=== Stele 3 ===
It represents a scene in which Chan Muwan II is standing in front of a second person squatting and in a position of submission wearing paper ear-rings, symbol of the captives.

<doc id="175065" wikidata="Q442497" url="?curid=175065" title="Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma">
<text>Ottavio Farnese (9 October 1524 – 18 September 1586) reigned as Duke of Parma and Piacenza from 1547 until his death and Duke of Castro from 1545 to 1547 and from 1553 until his death.

==Biography==

Born in Valentano, Ottavio was the second son of Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza (eldest son of Pope Paul III) by his wife Gerolama Orsini. Ottavio&#x27;s brother was Cardinal Ranuccio Farnese.

On 4 November 1538 Ottavio married Margaret of Austria, the illegitimate daughter of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Ottavio was 14 years old, while Margaret, recently widowed by the death of Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, was 15. At first she disliked her youthful bridegroom, but when he returned wounded from an expedition to Algiers in 1541 her aversion was turned to affection.

Ottavio had become lord of Camerino in 1540, but he gave up that fief when his father became duke of Parma in 1545. After the Parmesan nobility assassinated Pierluigi Farnese in 1547, troops of the Emperor occupied Piacenza. Pope Paul III attempted to regain Piacenza; he set aside Ottavio&#x27;s claims to the succession of Parma, where he appointed a papal legate, giving him back Camerino in exchange, and then claimed Piacenza from the emperor — not for the Farnese, but for the Church.

Ottavio attempted to seize Parma by force, and having failed, entered into negotiations with Ferrante Gonzaga. This rebellion on the part of his grandson is believed to have hastened the Pope&#x27;s death on 10 November 1549. During the interregnum that followed, Ottavio again tried to induce the governor of Parma to give up the city to him, but met with no better success; however, on the election of Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte to the papacy as Julius III, the duchy was conferred on him in 1551.

This did not end Ottavio&#x27;s quarrel with the Emperor Charles V, for Gonzaga refused to give up Piacenza and even threatened to occupy Parma, so that Ottavio was driven into the arms of France. Julius III, who was anxious to be on good terms with Charles V on account of the Council of Trent which was then sitting, ordered Farnese to hand Parma over to the papal authorities once more, and on his refusal hurled censures and admonitions at his head, and deprived him of his Roman fiefs, while Charles did the same with regard to those in Lombardy. A French army came to protect Parma, the War of Parma broke out, and Gonzaga at once laid siege to the city. But the duke came to an arrangement with his father-in-law, by which he regained Piacenza and his other fiefs. The rest of his life was spent quietly at home, where the moderation and wisdom of his rule won for him the affection of his people.

At his death in 1586 his only legitimate son Alessandro succeeded him.

== Issue ==
Ottavio and his wife Margherita had:
* Charles Farnese (, , ; 27 August 1545September 1545), heir to the Duchy of Parma.
* Alexander Farnese (27 August 15453 December 1592), 3rd Duke of Parma; married Infanta Maria of Portugal

Ottavio also had two other daughters: 
* Violante, married to Torquato Conti (not to be confused with his grandson, Torquato Conti) (c. 1520 – c. 1575) and had issue,
* Ersilia (1565–1596), married to Renato Borromeo, Conte di Arona (1555–1608), first cousin of St. Charles Borromeo, and had issue.

<text>Thomas Francis Dorsey Jr. (November 19, 1905 – November 26, 1956) was an American jazz trombonist, composer, conductor and bandleader of the big band era. He was known as the &quot;Sentimental Gentleman of Swing&quot; because of his smooth-toned trombone playing. His theme song was &quot;I&#x27;m Getting Sentimental Over You&quot;. His technical skill on the trombone gave him renown among other musicians. He was the younger brother of bandleader Jimmy Dorsey. After Dorsey broke with his brother in the mid-1930s, he led an extremely successful band from the late 1930s into the 1950s. He is best remembered for standards such as &quot;Opus One&quot;, &quot;This Love of Mine&quot; (no. 3 in 1941) featuring Frank Sinatra on vocals, &quot;Song of India&quot;, &quot;Marie&quot;, &quot;On Treasure Island&quot;, and his biggest hit single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot; (no. 1 for 12 weeks in 1940).

==Early life==
Born in Mahanoy Plane, Pennsylvania, Thomas Francis Dorsey Jr. was the second of four children born to Thomas Francis Dorsey Sr., a bandleader, and Theresa (née Langton) Dorsey. He and Jimmy, his older brother by slightly less than two years, became known as the Dorsey Brothers. The two younger siblings were Mary and Edward, who died young. Tommy Dorsey studied the trumpet with his father but later switched to trombone.

At age 15, Jimmy recommended Tommy to replace Russ Morgan in the Scranton Sirens, a territory band in the 1920s. Tommy and Jimmy worked in bands led by Tal Henry, Rudy Vallee, Vincent Lopez, and Nathaniel Shilkret. In 1923, Dorsey followed Jimmy to Detroit to play in Jean Goldkette&#x27;s band and returned to New York in 1925 to play with the California Ramblers. In 1927, he joined Paul Whiteman. In 1929, the Dorsey Brothers had their first hit with &quot;Coquette&quot; for OKeh Records.

In 1934, the Dorsey Brothers band signed with Decca, having a hit with &quot;I Believe in Miracles&quot;. Glenn Miller was a member of the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra in 1934 and 1935, composing &quot;Annie&#x27;s Cousin Fanny&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Another Day&quot;, &quot;Harlem Chapel Chimes&quot;, and &quot;Dese Dem Dose&quot;, all recorded for Decca, for the band. Acrimony between the brothers led to Tommy Dorsey walking out to form his own band in 1935 as the orchestra was having a hit with &quot;Every Little Moment&quot;. Dorsey&#x27;s orchestra was known primarily for its renderings of ballads at dance tempos, frequently with singers such as Jack Leonard and Frank Sinatra.

On August 21, 1949, Tommy, along with trumpeter Charlie Shavers and singer Red Wooten, survived a plane crash uninjured. The aircraft, departing from Windsor, Ontario, Canada, crash-landed in a cornfield after the engine failed shortly after takeoff, according to the pilot.

==Band==

In 2009, Buddy De Franco recalled recording &quot;Opus One&quot; with Dorsey in the 1940s, commenting on Dorsey&#x27;s desire to be precise and exact. Expanding on De Franco&#x27;s opinions about Dorsey, writer Peter Levinson said, &quot;He wanted things to be done his way.&quot;

The band was popular almost from the moment it signed with RCA Victor for &quot;On Treasure Island&quot;, the first of four hits in 1935. After his 1935 recording, however, Dorsey&#x27;s manager dropped the &quot;hot jazz&quot; that Dorsey had mixed with his own lyrical style, and instead had Dorsey play pop and vocal tunes. Dorsey kept his Clambake Seven as a Dixieland group that played during performances. Dorsey became the co-host of &quot;The Raleigh-Kool Program&quot; on the radio with comedian Jack Pearl, then became the host.

By 1939, Dorsey was aware of criticism that his band lacked a jazz feeling. He hired arranger Sy Oliver away from the Jimmie Lunceford band. Sy Oliver&#x27;s arrangements include &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot; and &quot;T.D.&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot;; Oliver also composed two of the new band&#x27;s signature instrumentals, &quot;Well, Git It&quot; and &quot;Opus One&quot;. In 1940, Dorsey hired singer Frank Sinatra from bandleader Harry James. Sinatra made eighty recordings from 1940 to 1942 with the Dorsey band. Two of those eighty songs are &quot;In the Blue of Evening&quot; and &quot;This Love of Mine&quot;. Sinatra achieved his first great success as a vocalist in the Dorsey band and claimed he learned breath control from watching Dorsey play trombone. Sy Oliver and Sinatra did a posthumous tribute album to Dorsey on Sinatra&#x27;s Reprise records. &quot;I Remember Tommy&quot; appeared in 1961. Dorsey said his trombone style was heavily influenced by Jack Teagarden.

Among Dorsey&#x27;s staff of arrangers was Axel Stordahl who arranged for Sinatra in his Columbia and Capitol years. Another member of the Dorsey band was trombonist Nelson Riddle, who later had a partnership as one of Sinatra&#x27;s arrangers and conductors in the 1950s and afterwards. Another noted Dorsey arranger, who, in the 1950s, married and was professionally associated with Dorsey veteran Jo Stafford, was Paul Weston. Bill Finegan, an arranger who left Glenn Miller&#x27;s civilian band, arranged for the Tommy Dorsey band from 1942 to 1950.

The band featured a number of instrumentalists, singers, and arrangers in the 1930s and &#x27;40s, including trumpeters Zeke Zarchy, Bunny Berigan, Ziggy Elman, Doc Severinsen, and Charlie Shavers, pianists Milt Raskin, Jess Stacy, clarinetists Buddy DeFranco, Johnny Mince, and Peanuts Hucko. Others who played with Dorsey were drummers Buddy Rich, Louie Bellson, Dave Tough saxophonist Tommy Reed, and singers Sinatra, Ken Curtis, Jack Leonard, Edythe Wright, Jo Stafford with the Pied Pipers, Dick Haymes, and Connie Haines.

In 1944, Dorsey hired the Sentimentalists, name with which he renamed the already known vocal band The Clark Sisters asking them not to reveal their identity. They replaced the Pied Pipers. Dorsey also performed with singer Connee Boswell He hired ex-bandleader and drummer Gene Krupa after Krupa&#x27;s arrest for marijuana possession in 1943. In 1942, Artie Shaw broke up his band, and Dorsey hired the Shaw string section. As George T. Simon in &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine observed at the time: &quot;They&#x27;re used in the foreground and background (note some of the lovely obbligatos) for vocal effects and for Tommy&#x27;s trombone.&quot;

Dorsey made further business decisions in the music industry. He loaned money to Glenn Miller enabling him to launch his band of 1938, but Dorsey saw the loan as an investment, entitling him to a percentage of Miller&#x27;s income. When Miller balked at this, the angry Dorsey got even by sponsoring a new band led by Bob Chester, and hiring arrangers who deliberately copied Miller&#x27;s style and sound. Dorsey branched out in the mid-1940s and owned two music publishing companies, Sun and Embassy. After opening at the Los Angeles ballroom, the Hollywood Palladium on the Palladium&#x27;s first night, Dorsey&#x27;s relations with the ballroom soured and he opened a competing ballroom, the Casino Gardens circa 1944. Dorsey also owned for a short time a trade magazine called &quot;The Bandstand&quot;.

Tommy Dorsey disbanded his own orchestra at the end of 1946. Dorsey might have broken up his own band permanently following World War II, as many big bands did due to the shift in music economics following the war, but Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s album for RCA Victor, &quot;All Time Hits&quot; placed in the top ten records in February 1947. In addition, &quot;How Are Things in Glocca Morra?&quot;, a single recorded by Dorsey, became a top-ten hit in March 1947. As a result, Dorsey was able to re-organize a big band in early 1947. The Dorsey brothers were also reconciling. The biographical film &quot;The Fabulous Dorseys&quot; (1947) describes sketchy details of how the brothers got their start from-the-bottom-up into the jazz era of one-nighters, the early days of radio in its infancy stages, and the onward march when both brothers ended up with Paul Whiteman before 1935 when The Dorsey Brothers&#x27; Orchestra split into two.

In the early 1950s, Tommy Dorsey moved from RCA Victor back to Decca. He was promised $2,000 if he switched to their label. However, he was reported to have collected $2,500 instead.

Jimmy Dorsey broke up his big band in 1953. Tommy invited him to join as a feature attraction. In 1953, the Dorseys focused their attention on television. On December 26, 1953, the brothers appeared with their orchestra on Jackie Gleason&#x27;s CBS television show, which was preserved on kinescope and later released on home video by Gleason. The brothers took the unit on tour and onto their own television show, &quot;Stage Show&quot;, from 1954 to 1956. In January 1956, The Dorseys made rock music history introducing Elvis Presley on his national television debut. Presley, then a regional country singer, made six guest appearances on &quot;Stage Show&quot; promoting his first releases for RCA Victor several months before his more familiar visits to the Milton Berle, Steve Allen, and Ed Sullivan variety programs.

==Personal life==
Dorsey was married three times. His first wife was 16-year-old Mildred &quot;Toots&quot; Kraft, with whom he eloped in 1922, when he was 17. The couple had two children, Patricia and Thomas F. Dorsey III (nicknamed &quot;Skipper&quot;). In 1935, they moved to &quot;Tall Oaks&quot;, a estate in Bernardsville, New Jersey. They divorced in 1943 after Dorsey&#x27;s affair with his former singer Edythe Wright.

Dorsey&#x27;s second wife was film actress Patricia Dane in 1943, and they were divorced in 1947, but not before he gained headlines for striking actor Jon Hall when Hall embraced her. Finally, Dorsey married Jane Carl New on March 27, 1948, in Atlanta, Georgia. She had been a dancer at the Copacabana nightclub in New York City. Tommy and Jane Dorsey had two children, Catherine Susan and Steve.

===Death and aftermath===
Dorsey died on November 26, 1956, at his home in Greenwich, Connecticut, a week after his 51st birthday. He had begun taking sleeping pills regularly at this time, causing him to become heavily sedated; he choked to death in his sleep after eating a large meal. Jimmy Dorsey led his brother&#x27;s band until his own death from throat cancer the following year. At that point, trombonist Warren Covington became leader of the band with Jane Dorsey&#x27;s blessing as she owned the rights to her late husband&#x27;s band and name. Billed as the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra Starring Warren Covington, they reached #7 on the Billboard charts and earned a gold record in the fall of 1958 with the hit single &quot;Tea for Two Cha-Cha&quot;. The band was also fronted by Urbie Green after Dorsey&#x27;s death in 1956.

After Covington left the band, tenor saxophonist Sam Donahue led it from 1961, continuing until 1966. Frank Sinatra Jr. made his professional singing debut with the band at Dallas Memorial Theater in Texas in 1963. Later, trombonist and bandleader Buddy Morrow led the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra from 1977 until his death on September 27, 2010. Jane Dorsey died of natural causes at the age of 79, in Miami, Florida, in 2003. Tommy and Jane Dorsey are interred together in Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.

==Number-one hits==
Tommy Dorsey had a run of 286 &quot;Billboard&quot; chart hits. The Dorsey band had seventeen number-one hits with his orchestra in the 1930s and 1940s including: &quot;On Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;The Music Goes &#x27;Round and Around&quot;, &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Marie&quot; (written by Irving Berlin), &quot;Satan Takes a Holiday&quot;, &quot;The Big Apple&quot;, &quot;Once in a While&quot;, &quot;The Dipsy Doodle&quot;, &quot;Our Love&quot;, &quot;All the Things You Are&quot;, &quot;Indian Summer&quot;, and &quot;Dolores&quot;. He had two more number one hits in 1935 when he was a member of the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra: &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot; (written by Harry Warren), number one for two weeks, and &quot;Chasing Shadows&quot;, number one for three weeks. His biggest hit was &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot;, featuring Frank Sinatra on vocals, which was number one for twelve weeks on the Billboard pop singles chart in 1940. &quot;RCA Victor ... scored with &#x27;There Are Such Things&#x27;, which had a Sinatra vocal; it hit number one in January 1943, as did &#x27;In the Blue of the Evening&#x27;, another Dorsey record featuring Sinatra, in August, while a third Dorsey/Sinatra release, &#x27;It&#x27;s Always You,&#x27; hit the Top Five later in the year, and a fourth, &#x27;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&#x27;, reached the Top Ten in 1944.&quot; It should be added that these 1943 and 1944 Sinatra hits were older recordings reissued because the 1942–44 musicians&#x27; strike prevented Sinatra, now a popular singer, from recording new material. The website &quot;Tommy Dorsey A Songwriter&#x27;s Friend&quot; says, &quot;the orchestra had over 200 top twenty recordings including the No. 1 hits &#x27;The Music Goes Round and Round&#x27; (1935), &#x27;Alone&#x27; (1936) &#x27;You&#x27; (1936), &#x27;Marie&#x27; (1937), &#x27;Satan Takes a Holiday&#x27; (1937), &#x27;The Big Apple&#x27; (1937), &#x27;Once in a While&#x27; (1937), &#x27;The Dipsy Doodle&#x27; (1937), &#x27;Music, Maestro, Please&#x27; (1938), &#x27;Our Love&#x27; (1939), &#x27;Indian Summer&#x27; (1939), &#x27;All the Things You Are&#x27; (1939), &#x27;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&#x27; (1940), &#x27;Dolores&#x27; (1941), &#x27;There are Such Things&#x27; (1942), and &#x27;In the Blue of the Evening&#x27; (1943).&quot;

<text>Hiram Warren Johnson (September 2, 1866August 6, 1945) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 23rd governor of California from 1911 to 1917 and represented California in the U.S. Senate for five terms from 1917 to 1945. Johnson achieved national prominence in the early 20th century as a leading progressive and ran for vice president on Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Progressive ticket in the 1912 presidential election. As a U.S. senator, Johnson was a leading critic of the foreign policy of both Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Johnson was born in 1866 and worked as a stenographer and reporter before embarking on a legal career in his hometown of Sacramento. After he moved to San Francisco, he worked as an assistant district attorney and gained statewide renown for his prosecutions of public corruption. On the back of this popularity, Johnson won the 1910 California gubernatorial election with the backing of the progressive Lincoln–Roosevelt League. He instituted several progressive reforms, establishing a railroad commission and introducing aspects of direct democracy, such as the power to recall state officials. Having joined with Theodore Roosevelt and other progressives to form the Progressive Party, Johnson won the party&#x27;s 1912 vice-presidential nomination. In one of the best third-party performances in U.S. history, the ticket finished second nationally in the popular and electoral votes.

Johnson was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1916, becoming a leader of the chamber&#x27;s Progressive Republicans. He made his biggest mark in the Senate as an early voice for isolationism but voted for U.S. entry into World War I. He opposed U.S. participation in the League of Nations. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1920 and 1924. Although he supported Democratic nominee Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election and many of the New Deal programs, by November 1936 he had become hostile to Roosevelt, whom he viewed as a potential dictator. He remained in the Senate until his death in 1945.

==Early years==
Hiram Johnson was born in Sacramento on September 2, 1866. His father, Grove Lawrence Johnson, was an attorney and Republican U.S. Representative and a member of the California State Legislature whose career was marred by accusations of election fraud and graft. His mother, Mabel Ann &quot;Annie&quot; Williamson De Montfredy, was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution based on her descent from Pierre Van Cortlandt and Philip Van Cortlandt. Johnson had one brother and three sisters.

Johnson attended the public schools of Sacramento and was 16 when he graduated from Sacramento High School in 1882 as the class valedictorian. Too young to begin attending college, Johnson worked as a shorthand reporter and stenographer in his father&#x27;s law office and attended Heald&#x27;s Business College. He studied law at the University of California, Berkeley from 1884 to 1886, where he was a member of Chi Phi fraternity. After his admission to the bar in 1888, Johnson practiced in Sacramento with his brother Albert as the firm of Johnson &amp; Johnson. When the State Bar of California was organized in 1927, William H. Waste, the Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court, was given license number one and Johnson received number two. Both his son, Hiram Jr. and grandson, Hiram III, were later members of the California State Bar.

In addition to practicing law, Johnson was active in politics as a Republican, including supporting his father&#x27;s campaigns. In 1899, Johnson backed the mayoral campaign of George H. Clark. Clark won, and when he took office in 1900, he named Johnson as city attorney.

In 1902, Johnson moved to San Francisco, where he quickly developed a reputation as a fearless litigator, primarily as a criminal defense lawyer, while becoming active in reform politics. He attracted statewide attention in 1908 when he assisted District Attorney Francis J. Heney in the prosecution of Abe Ruef and Mayor Eugene Schmitz for graft. After Heney was shot in the courtroom during an attempted assassination, Johnson took the lead for the prosecution and won the case.

==Governor of California (1911–1917)==
In 1910, Johnson won the gubernatorial election as a member of the Lincoln–Roosevelt League, a Progressive Republican movement, running on a platform opposed to the Southern Pacific Railroad. During his campaign, he toured the state in an open automobile, covering thousands of miles and visiting small communities throughout California that were inaccessible by rail. Johnson helped establish rules that made voting and the political process easier. For example, he established rules to facilitate recalls. This measure was used to remove Governor Gray Davis from office in 2003 and to enable an unsuccessful effort to remove Governor Gavin Newsom in 2021.

In office, Johnson was a populist who promoted a number of democratic reforms: the election of U.S. Senators by direct popular vote rather than the state legislature (which was later ratified nationwide by a constitutional amendment), cross-filing, initiative, referendum, and recall elections. Johnson&#x27;s reforms gave California a degree of direct democracy unmatched by any other U.S. state at the time. When he took office, amid rampant corruption, the Southern Pacific Railroad held so much power it was known as the fourth branch of government. &quot;While I do not by any means believe the initiative, the referendum and the recall are the panacea for all our political ills,&quot; Johnson extolled in his 1911 inaugural address, &quot;they do give to the electorate the power of action when desired, and they do place in the hands of the people the means by which they may protect themselves.&quot;

Johnson was also instrumental in reining in the power of the Southern Pacific Railroad through the establishment of a state railroad commission. On taking office, Johnson paroled Chris Evans, convicted as the Southern Pacific train bandit, but required that he leave California.
Although initially opposed to the bill, Johnson gave in to political pressure and supported the California Alien Land Law of 1913, which prevented Asian immigrants from owning land in the state (they were already excluded from naturalized citizenship because of their race).

===1912 vice presidential campaign===

In 1912, Johnson was a founder of the national Progressive Party and ran as the party&#x27;s vice presidential candidate, sharing a ticket with former President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Johnson narrowly carried California but finished second nationally behind the Democratic ticket of Woodrow Wilson and Thomas R. Marshall. Their second-place finish, ahead of incumbent Republican President William Howard Taft, remains among the strongest for any third party in American history.

Johnson was re-elected governor of California in 1914 as the Progressive Party candidate, gaining nearly twice the votes of his Republican opponent John D. Fredericks. In 1917, as one of his final acts as governor before ascending to the U.S. Senate, Johnson signed Senate Constitutional Amendment 26, providing health insurance for all in the Golden State. Then it was put on the ballot for ratification. A coalition of insurance companies took out an ad in The Chronicle, warning it &quot;would spell social ruin to the United States.&quot; Every voter in the state, as recounted in a recent issue of the New Yorker, &quot;received in the mail a pamphlet with a picture of the Kaiser and the words &#x27;Born in Germany. Do you want it in California?&#x27;&quot; The ballot measure failed, 27%-73%.

==U.S. Senator (1917–1945)==

In 1916, Johnson ran successfully for the U.S. Senate, defeating conservative Democrat George S. Patton Sr. and took office on March 16, 1917. Johnson was elected as a staunch opponent of American entry into World War I, but voted in favor of war after his election.

He allegedly said, &quot;The first casualty when war comes is truth.&quot; However, this quote may be apocryphal.

He voted against the League of Nations during his first term.

During his Senate career, Johnson served as chairman of the Committees on Cuban Relations (Sixty-sixth Congress), Patents (Sixty-seventh Congress), Immigration (Sixty-eighth through Seventy-first Congresses), Territories and Insular Possessions (Sixty-eighth Congress), and Commerce (Seventy-first and Seventy-second Congresses).

In the Senate, Johnson helped push through the Immigration Act of 1924, having worked with Valentine S. McClatchy and other anti-Japanese lobbyists to prohibit Japanese and other East Asian immigrants from entering the United States.

In the early 1920s, the motion picture industry sought to establish a self-regulatory process to fend off official censorship. Senator Johnson was among three candidates identified to head a new group, alongside Herbert Hoover and Will H. Hays. Hays, who had managed President Harding&#x27;s 1920 campaign, was ultimately named to head the new Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America in early 1922.

As Senator, Johnson proved extremely popular. In 1934, he was re-elected with 94.5 percent of the popular vote; he was nominated by both the Republican and Democratic parties and his only opponent was Socialist George Ross Kirkpatrick.

Johnson was a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee continuously for 25 years, from the 66th Congress (1919–21) through the 78th Congress (1943–44) and one of its longest serving members. In 1943, a confidential analysis of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made by British scholar Isaiah Berlin for his Foreign Office, stated that Johnson:
:is the Isolationists&#x27; elder statesman and the only surviving member of the [William E.] Borah-[Henry Cabot] Lodge-Johnson combination which led the fight against the League in 1919 and 1920. He is an implacable and uncompromising Isolationist with immense prestige in California, of which he has twice been Governor. His election to the Senate has not been opposed for many years by either party. He is acutely Pacific-conscious and is a champion of a more adequate defence of the West Coast. He is a member of the Farm &quot;Bloc&quot; and is &quot;au fond&quot;, against foreign affairs as such; his view of Europe as a sink of iniquity has not changed in any particular since 1912, when he founded a short-lived progressive party. His prestige in Congress is still great and his parliamentary skill should not be underestimated.

In 1945, Johnson was absent when the vote took place for ratification of the United Nations Charter, but made it known that he would have voted against this outcome. Senators Henrik Shipstead and William Langer were the only ones to cast votes opposing ratification.

===Presidential politics===
Following Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s death in January 1919, Johnson was the most prominent leader in the surviving progressive movement; the Progressive Party of 1912 was dead. In 1920, he ran for the Republican nomination for president but was defeated by conservative Senator Warren Harding. Johnson did not get the support of Roosevelt&#x27;s family, who instead supported Roosevelt&#x27;s long-time friend Leonard Wood. At the convention, Johnson was asked to serve as Harding&#x27;s running mate but he declined. Johnson sought the 1924 Republican nomination against President Calvin Coolidge; his campaign was derailed after he lost the California primary. Johnson declined to challenge Herbert Hoover for the 1928 presidential nomination, instead choosing to seek re-election to the Senate.

In the 1932 United States presidential election, Johnson broke with President Hoover. He was one of the most prominent Republicans to support Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt. During Roosevelt&#x27;s first term, Johnson supported the president&#x27;s New Deal economic recovery package and frequently &quot;crossed the floor&quot; to aid the Democrats. By late 1936, he was convinced that Roosevelt was a dangerous would-be dictator. Although in poor health, Johnson attacked Roosevelt and the New Deal following the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, the president&#x27;s &quot;court-packing&quot; attempt.

==Personal life==

In January 1886, Johnson married Minne L. McNeal (1869–1947). The couple had two sons: Hiram W. &quot;Jack&quot; Johnson Jr. (1886–1959), and Archibald &quot;Archie&quot; McNeal Johnson (1890–1933). Both sons practiced law in California and served in the army. Hiram Jr. was a veteran of World War I, and attained the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Army Air Corps while stationed at Fort Mason in San Francisco during World War II. Archie Johnson was a major of field artillery corps and was wounded in action during the First World War.

==Death==
Having served in the Senate for almost thirty years, Johnson died of a cerebral thrombosis at the Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, on August 6, 1945, the same day as the US-conducted atomic bombing of Hiroshima. He had been in failing health for several months. He was interred in a mausoleum at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California and his remains are interred with those of his wife, Minne, and two sons.

==Legacy==
During his first term gubernatorial inaugural address on January 3, 1911, Johnson declared that his first duty was &quot;to eliminate every private interest from the government and to make the public service of the State responsive solely to the people.&quot; Committed to &quot;arm the people to protect themselves&quot; against such abuses, Johnson proposed amending the state Constitution with &quot;the initiative, the referendum and the recall.&quot; All three of these progressive reforms were enacted during his governorship, forever guaranteeing Johnson&#x27;s stature as the preeminent progressive reformer of California politics. His contribution as the driving force behind the direct democratic process for removal of elected officials was revisited in the media and by the general public during the successful 2003 California recall election of Democratic governor Gray Davis. Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger, the eventual winner, referred to Johnson&#x27;s progressive legacy in his campaign speeches. Johnson&#x27;s stature in fostering the California recall and ballot initiative direct democratic processes again surfaced in the media during the unsuccessful 2021 California recall election of Democratic governor Gavin Newsom.

On August 25, 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife, Maria Shriver, announced that Johnson would be one of 13 inducted into the California Hall of Fame that year.

Johnson held the record as California&#x27;s longest-serving United States Senator for over 75 years, until it was broken by Democrat Dianne Feinstein on March 28, 2021. He remains the longest serving Republican senator and the longest serving male senator from California.

The Hiram Johnson papers, consisting primarily of hundreds of letters that Johnson wrote to his two sons over the course of decades, and that his son, Hiram Jr. donated in 1955, reside at the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley.

Hiram Johnson High School in Sacramento, California is named in his honor.

<text>Munch Museum (), marketed as Munch (stylised in all caps) since 2020, is an art museum in Bjørvika, Oslo, Norway dedicated to the life and works of the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch.

The museum was originally located at Tøyen, which was opened in 1963. The museum moved to the new museum building at Bjørvika, which was opened in 22 October 2021.

==Selected collection highlights==
== Buildings ==
=== Original ===

The original Munch Museum was situated at Tøyen in the Oslo borough of Gamle Oslo. Construction of the museum was financed from the profits generated by the Oslo municipal cinemas and opened its doors in 1963 to commemorate what would have been Munch&#x27;s 100th birthday. Its collection consists of works and articles by Munch, which he donated to the municipality of Oslo upon his death, and additional works donated by his sister Inger Munch, as well as various other works obtained through trades, including duplicate prints.

The museum had in its permanent collection well over half of the artist&#x27;s entire production of paintings and at least one copy of all his prints. This amounted to over 1,200 paintings, 18,000 prints, six sculptures, as well as 500 plates, 2,240 books, and various other items. The museum also contained educational and conservation sections, and has facilities for the performing arts.
The museum structure was designed by architects Einar Myklebust and Gunnar Fougner. Myklebust also played an important role in the expansion and renovation of the museum in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of Munch&#x27;s death. This site was also the location of filming for an &quot;Olsenbanden&quot;-movie from 1984.

The last exhibition of the museum while at Tøyen, Oslo was opened in May 2021, which lasted until 1 October.

=== Current ===

Previously, in 2008, the City of Oslo promoted an architectural competition for a new Munch Museum in the area of Bjørvika, a new urban development where the Oslo Opera House is also located. The competition was won in 2009 by Spanish architect Juan Herreros and his studio Herreros Arquitectos (now estudio Herreros).

Before the local election in Oslo in 2011, the Oslo Progress Party decided that they would no longer support the project due to economic concerns. After the election, in December 2011, the Oslo City Council voted to end the project. Instead the council wanted to consider improving the current museum or moving the collection to Nasjonalgalleriet.

In May 2013, the Oslo City Council finally took the decision to revive the project, and move the museum to its new site on the waterfront, next to the Oslo Opera House. Construction started in September 2015. The new museum has been widely criticised for its design, where it has been branded the unofficial world&#x27;s largest collection of guard rails.

In summer 2021, 28000 pieces of art were moved from the previous museum at Tøyen, to the new museum at Bjørvika, Oslo.

The museum was opened by King Harald V on 22 October 2021.

== 2004 armed robbery of two paintings ==
On Sunday, 22 August 2004, two paintings by Munch, &quot;The Scream&quot; and &quot;Madonna&quot;, were stolen from the Munch Museum by armed robbers who forced the museum guards to lie on the floor while they snapped the cable securing the paintings to the wall. The paintings were recovered by Oslo Police on 31 August 2006.

<doc id="175071" wikidata="Q212893" url="?curid=175071" title="Aran Islands">
<text>The Aran Islands ( ; , ) or The Arans ( ) are a group of three islands at the mouth of Galway Bay, off the west coast of Ireland, with a total area around . They constitute the historic barony of Aran in County Galway.

From west to east, the islands are: Inishmore ( / ), which is the largest; Inishmaan (), the second-largest; and Inisheer (), the smallest. There are also several islets.

The population of 1,347 (as of 2022) primarily speak Irish, making the islands a part of the Gaeltacht. Most islanders are also fluent or proficient in English. The population has steadily declined from around 3,500 in 1841.

==Location and access==
The approaches to the bay between the Aran Islands and the mainland are:

* North Sound&quot;An Súnda ó Thuaidh&quot; (more accurately &quot;Bealach Locha Lurgan&quot;) lies between Inishmore and Lettermullen, County Galway.
* Gregory&#x27;s Sound&quot;Súnda Ghríoghóra&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Bealach na h-Áite&quot;) lies between Inishmore and Inishmaan.
* Foul Sound&quot;An Súnda Salach&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Bealach na Fearbhaighe&quot;) lies between Inishmaan and Inisheer.
* South Sound&quot;An Súnda ó Dheas&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Bealach na Fínnise&quot;) lies between Inisheer and County Clare.

Ferries operate to all three islands from Rossaveal in County Galway (year round) and Doolin in County Clare (seasonal). Flights operated by Aer Arann Islands also operate from Inverin.

==History==

Little is known about the first inhabitants to cross over to the islands, but they likely came across in search of a safe haven from attack. The islands are made up of Carboniferous limestone and do not have naturally occurring topsoil. Early settlers augmented the soil with seaweed and sand from the shore. Drystone walls were built to protect the soil. Seven prehistoric stone forts are on the islands. Dún Aonghasa, on Inishmore, dates back to 1100 BC.

Enda of Aran founded the Killeany monastery in Inishmore, AD 490. It became a centre of learning, piety, and asceticism. Also on Inishmore is &quot;Tempull Breccain&quot;, the fifth-century Church of Saint Brecan. A ringfort on Inisheer, called Dún Formna, became the site of a castle built by the O&#x27;Briens around the 14th century. Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers destroyed the castle and all but two of the seven churches established by Brecan.

The islands were briefly captured and held by Jacobite privateer Thomas Vaughan in 1693, whose crew plundered Protestant settlements there.

The typical settlement was a &quot;clachan&quot;, a scattered cluster of small, single-storey cottages with thatched roofs. Typical clothing for an Aran man was homespun trousers and waistcoats made of grey or light-brown tweed; for women, a calf-length woven skirt along with a knitted sweater. Aran knitters were highly skilled. In the 1820s, harvesting kelp was an important sideline to raise money for the land rents. Salvaging flotsam often produced wood for building and fuel.

In 1898, John Millington Synge started spending his summers in the Aran Islands. His 1904 play, &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot;, is set on Inishmaan. He published &quot;The Aran Islands&quot; in 1907, based on his journals. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.

== Geology ==
The islands&#x27; geology is mainly karst limestone, related to the Burren in County Clare (to the east), not the granites of Connemara to the north. This is most obvious in the construction of the walls around the fields.

The limestones date from the Viséan age of the Lower Carboniferous, formed as sediments in a tropical sea approximately 350 million years ago, and compressed into horizontal strata with fossil corals, crinoids, sea urchins, and ammonites. Glaciation following the Namurian facilitated greater denudation. The result is that the Aran Islands are one of the finest examples of a Glacio-Karst landscape in the world. The effects of the last glacial period (the Midlandian) are most in evidence, with the islands overrun by ice during this glaciation. The impact of earlier karstification (solutional erosion) has been eliminated by the last glacial period. Any karstification now seen dates from around 11,000 years ago, so the island karst is recent.

Solutional processes have widened and deepened the grykes of the limestone pavement. Pre-existing lines of weakness in the rock (vertical joints) contribute to the formation of extensive fissures separated by clints (flat, pavement-like slabs). The rock karstification facilitates the formation of subterranean drainage.

==Coastal geomorphology==

Huge boulders up to above the sea at parts of the west-facing cliffs are an extreme form of storm beach, cast there by waves. Previously considered as possible tsunami deposits, these coastal boulder deposits have recently been shown (by Rónadh Cox and collaborators) to be definitively the work of storms.

==Climate and agriculture==
The islands have an unusually temperate climate. Average air temperatures range from in July to in January. The soil temperature does not usually drop below (the winter of 2010 recorded a prolonged period of snow, the first in living memory). Since grass will grow once the temperature rises above , this means that the island (like the neighbouring Burren) has one of the longest growing seasons in Ireland or Britain, and supports diverse and rich plant growth. Late May is the sunniest time and also likely the best time to view flowers, with the gentians and avens peaking (but orchid species blooming later).

==Demographics==
==Flora and fauna==
The islands support arctic, Mediterranean and alpine plants side-by-side, due to the unusual environment. Like the Burren, the Aran islands are renowned for their remarkable assemblage of plants and animals.

The grikes (crevices) provide moist shelter, thus supporting a wide range of plants including dwarf shrubs. Where the surface of the pavement is shattered into gravel, many of the hardier Arctic or alpine plants can be found, but when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil, patches of grass are seen, interspersed with plants such as gentian and orchids.

Notable insects present include butterflies—pearl-bordered fritillary &quot;Boloria euphrosyne&quot;, brown hairstreak &quot;Thecla betulae&quot;, marsh fritillary &quot;Euphydryas aurinia&quot;, and wood white &quot;Leptidea sinapis&quot;; moths—the burren green &quot;Calamia tridens&quot;, Irish annulet &quot;Odontognophos dumetata&quot;, and transparent burnet &quot;Zygaena purpuralis&quot;; and the hoverfly &quot;Doros profuges&quot;.

== Traditional life and Irish language ==
On the cliff tops, ancient forts such as Dún Aonghasa (Dún Aengus) on Inishmore and Dún Chonchúir (Fort of Conchobar) on Inishmaan are some of the oldest archaeological remains in Ireland. A lacework of ancient stone walls across all three islands ( in all) encloses networks of small fields to contain local livestock. Also found are early &quot;clocháns&quot; (dry-stone beehive huts from the early-Christian period). Enda of Aran founded the first true Irish monastery near Killeany (Cill Éinne or Church of Enda). In time, a dozen monasteries were on Inishmore alone. Many Irish saints had some connection with Aran: St. Brendan was blessed for his voyage there; Jarlath of Tuam, Finnian of Clonard, and St. Columba called it the &quot;Sun of the West&quot;. In total, 38 national monuments are on the Aran Islands.

The islands were first populated in larger numbers probably at the time of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the mid-17th century, when the Catholic population of Ireland had the choice of going &quot;to hell or to Connacht&quot;. Many fled to the numerous islands off the west coast of Ireland, where they adapted themselves to the raw climatic conditions, developing a survival system of total self-sufficiency. Their methods included mixing layers of sand and seaweed on top of rocks to create fertile soil, a technique used to grow potatoes and other vegetables. The same seaweed method also provided grazing grass within stone-wall enclosures for cattle and sheep, which in turn provided leather, wool, and yarn to make hide shoes, handwoven trousers, skirts and jackets, hand-knitted sweaters, shawls, and caps. The islanders also constructed unique boats for fishing, building their thatched cottages from the materials available, or trading with the mainland.

The Aran Islands are an official Gaeltacht, which gives full official status to Irish as the medium of all official services, including education. An unusually high rate of Irish-language monolingualism was found among senior natives until the end of the 20th century, in large part because of the isolating nature of the traditional trades practised and the natural isolation of the islands in general from mainland Ireland over the course of the islands&#x27; history. Young islanders can take their leaving examination at 18 on the islands, and then most leave for third-level education. Many blame the decline of Irish-speaking among young members of the island community on English-language television, available since the 1960s; furthermore, many younger islanders leave for the mainland when they come of age.

==Transport==
Year-round ferry passenger services exist. Aran Island Ferries operate a year-round service from Rossaveal in County Galway, connected by a bus service from Galway city. A heavy-cargo service operates several times a week from Galway Harbour, and is operated by Lasta Mara.

Aer Arann Islands operates an air service from Inverin to Inishmore Airport, which has a connecting bus from Galway city. The airline announced that it would cease all flights in December 2018, but an agreement was reached to continue the service until 30 September 2019.

Ferries are also available to the Aran Islands from Doolin in County Clare (seasonal 1 April – 31 October).

A road network exists on each of the islands, and a speed limit of applies. Cars on the islands are exempt from road-worthiness testing. Most visitors to the island hire bikes and an increasing number hire ebikes, as they are the most convenient way to see the islands.

== Tourism ==

===Visitors and attractions===

Visitors come in large numbers, particularly in the summer. Several Bronze Age and Iron Age forts and attractions are on the islands:

* Dun Aengus (&quot;Dún Aonghasa&quot;, Aran Islands Dialect: &quot;dūn aŋgəs&quot;) is a Bronze Age and Iron Age fort on the edge of a cliff overlooking the Atlantic Ocean on Inishmore. It consists of a series of concentric circular walls. The innermost—the citadel—encloses an area approximately in diameter with thick walls of stone.
* Black Fort (Dún Dúchathair)
* O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Castle on Inisheer was built in the 14th century. The castle was taken from the O&#x27;Briens by the O&#x27;Flaherty clan of Connemara in 1582.
* Teampull Bheanáin is considered the smallest church in the world, and is notable for its orientation: north–south instead of east–west.
* Teampall an Cheathrair Álainn has a holy well, which inspired J. M. Synge&#x27;s play &quot;The Well of the Saints&quot;.

== Arts ==
===Local artists===

One of the major figures of the Irish Renaissance, Liam O&#x27;Flaherty, was born in Gort na gCapall, Inishmore, on 28 August 1896. Máirtín Ó Díreáin, one of the most eminent poets in the Irish language, was also from Inishmore. Since 2000, Áras Éanna Arts Centre, Inisheer, has been welcoming artists in residence, both local and international, to stay and work on the inspirational Aran Islands for periods of one month. Clíodhna Lyons, born on the islands, is an Irish cartoonist, animator, and printmaker, who has created several comics and &#x27;zines and is now a director for Brown Bag Films.

===Visiting artists===

The islands have historically attracted a number of artists. For example, starting in 1908, Harry Clarke spent a number of weeks each summer for six years on Inisheer, accompanied by friends and his future wife, Margaret Clarke (artist). Sketches by and of Clarke exist from these trips, regarded as formative in his upbringing, as they marked the first occasions in which convalescing off the mainland of Ireland was necessary for the artist.

The cultural and physical history of the islands has made them the object of visits by a variety of writers. For example, Lady Gregory came to Aran in the late 19th century to learn Irish. At the start of the 20th century and throughout his life, Seán Keating spent time painting on the islands every year. Elizabeth Rivers also moved from London and lived in Aran, where she created two books of art and was herself visited by artists such as Basil Rakoczi.

A further, related, kind of visitor was those who attempted to collect and catalogue the stories and folklore of the island, treating it as a kind of societal &quot;time capsule&quot; of an earlier stage of Irish culture. Visits of this kind include that captured in Robert J. Flaherty&#x27;s 1934 classic documentary &quot;Man of Aran&quot;. The film&#x27;s depiction of man&#x27;s courage and repudiation of the intellect appealed to Germany&#x27;s Nazi party, who noticed it during the Berlin Festival in 1935.

John Millington Synge&#x27;s &quot;&quot; is a work that straddles these first two modes, being both a personal account and also an attempt at preserving information about the pre- (or il-) literate Aran culture in literary form. The motivations of these visitors are exemplified by W. B. Yeats&#x27; advice to Synge: &quot;Go to the Aran Islands, and find a life that has never been expressed in literature.&quot;

In the second half of the 20th century, until perhaps the early 1970s, a third kind of visitor came to the islands. They came not necessarily because of the uniquely &quot;Irish&quot; nature of the island community, but simply because the accidents of geography and history conspired to produce a society that some found intriguing or even beguiling, and they wished to participate in it directly. At no time was there a single &quot;Aran&quot; culture; any description is necessarily incomplete and can be said to apply completely only to &quot;parts&quot; of the island at certain points in time. Visitors who came and stayed, though, were mainly attracted to aspects of Aran culture such as its reliance on local oral tradition for entertainment and news, isolation, reliance on subsistence or near-subsistence, farming and fishing.

For these reasons, the Aran Islands were &quot;decoupled&quot; from cultural developments that were at the same time radically changing other parts of Ireland and Western Europe. Though visitors of this third kind understood that the culture they encountered was intimately connected to that of Ireland, they were not particularly inclined to interpret their experiences as those of &quot;Irishness&quot;. Instead, they looked directly towards ways in which their time on the islands put them in touch with more general truths about life and human relations, and they often took pains to live &quot;as an islander&quot;, eschewing help from friends and family at home. Indeed, because of the difficult conditions they found—dangerous weather, scarce food—they sometimes had little time to investigate the culture in the more detached manner of earlier visitors. Their writings are often of a more personal nature, being concerned with understanding the author&#x27;s self as much as the culture around him.

This third mode of being in Aran died out in the late 1970s due in part to the increased tourist traffic and in part to technological improvements made to the island, that relegated the above aspects to history. A literary product of this third kind of visitor is &quot;An Aran Keening&quot;, by Andrew McNeillie, who spent a year on Aran in 1968. Another, Pádraig Ó Síocháin, a Dublin author and lawyer, learning to speak Gaelic to the fluency of an islander, became inextricably linked to the Aran handknitters and their Aran sweaters, extensively promoting their popularity and sale around the world for nearly forty years.

A fourth kind of visitor to the islands, still evident today, comes for spiritual reasons often connected to an appreciation for Celtic Christianity or more modern New Age beliefs, the former of which finds sites and landscapes of importance on the islands.

Finally, many thousands of visitors come for broadly touristic reasons, to see the ruins, hear Irish spoken (and Irish music played) in the few pubs on the island, and to experience the geology of cliffs. Some of these visitors create &quot;travelogues&quot; of note. Examples include Tim Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Stones of Aran: Pilgrimage&quot; (1986) and &quot;Stones of Aran: Labyrinth&quot; (1995), and his accompanying detailed map of the islands.

==Island crafts==
===Aran Island sweater===
The islands are the home of the Aran sweater, which gained worldwide appeal during the 20th century. Many of the sweaters sold in the islands are made elsewhere in Ireland.

===Aran currach===

The (modern) Aran version of the lightweight boat called the &quot;currach&quot; (Aran Islands Dialect: &quot;kørəx, korəx&quot;) is made from canvas stretched over a sparse skeleton of thin laths, then covered in tar. It is designed to withstand the very rough seas that are typical of islands that face the open Atlantic. Indeed, the Aran fishermen are said to not learn to swim, since they would certainly not survive any sea that swamped a &quot;currach&quot;, so it would be better to drown quickly. Despite the undoubted strength of these boats, they are very vulnerable to puncture.

The islanders were always totally self-sufficient. In calmer weather, the &quot;currachs&quot; would go out and spend the night fishing under the Cliffs of Moher, returning after dawn full with fish. Nowadays, they are only used inshore, tending lobster pots. More modern versions are still built for racing at the many local regattas, or &quot;cruinnithe&quot; up and down the west coast of Ireland during the summer.

Conventional shoes cannot be worn, so the fishermen wear soft calf-skin moccasins called &quot;pampooties&quot;, made of goatskin, calfskin, or cowhide.

==Sport==

Some of the limestone sea cliffs have attracted interest from rock-climbers.

GAA sports such as Gaelic football, hurling, and Irish handball are the islands&#x27; main sports.

The annual Red Bull cliff-diving world championships are held on Inishmore every year.

== In popular culture ==
* John Millington Synge wrote a book-length journal, &quot;&quot;, completed in 1901 and published in 1907.
* The Aran Islands are mentioned in James Joyce&#x27;s short story &quot;The Dead&quot; (1914) as a place where native Irish is spoken.
* The 1934 ethnofiction documentary film &quot;Man of Aran&quot;
* Gilbert Bécaud&#x27;s two-act &quot;L&#x27;Opéra d&#x27;Aran&quot; (1962) features a plot taking place on the Aran Islands.
* Seamus Heaney&#x27;s first book of poems, &quot;Death of a Naturalist&quot; (1966), contains a poem entitled &quot;Lovers on Aran&quot;.
* The Aran Islands featured in the comedy television series &quot;Father Ted&quot; from 1995 to 1998, set on the fictional Craggy Island, with real local sights such as the shipwreck of the steam trawler MV &quot;Plassy&quot; in the opening sequence. The island of Inishmore hosted a Friends of Ted festival in 2007.
* The 1996 play &quot;The Cripple of Inishmaan&quot; by Martin McDonagh is set on the Aran Islands. The play is the first in the Aran Islands Trilogy, followed in 2001 by &quot;The Lieutenant of Inishmore&quot;, and the unpublished &quot;The Banshees of Inisheer&quot;.

<doc id="175073" wikidata="Q211969" url="?curid=175073" title="Viking ship">
<text>Viking ships were marine vessels of unique structure, used in Scandinavia throughout the Middle Ages.
The boat-types were quite varied, depending on what the ship was intended for, but they were generally characterized as being slender and flexible boats, with symmetrical ends with true keel. They were clinker built, which is the overlapping of planks riveted together. Some might have had a dragon&#x27;s head or other circular object protruding from the bow and stern for design, although this is only inferred from historical sources. Viking ships were used both for military purposes and for long-distance trade, exploration and colonization.
In the literature, Viking ships are usually seen divided into two broad categories: merchant ships and warships, the latter resembling narrow &quot;war canoes&quot; with less load capacity, but higher speed. However, these categories are overlapping; some transport ships would also form part of war fleets. As a rule, ship lanes in Scandinavia followed coastal waters, hence a majority of vessels were of a lighter design, while a few types, such as the &quot;knarr&quot;, could navigate the open ocean. The Viking ships ranged from the Baltic Sea to far from the Scandinavian homelands, to Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Newfoundland, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and Africa.

The ship&#x27;s shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one meter deep and permitted beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages.

== Development ==
The ship has been functioning as the centerpiece of Scandinavian culture for centuries, serving both pragmatic and religious purposes, and its importance was already deeply rooted in the Scandinavian culture when the Viking Age began. Scandinavia is a region with relatively high inland mountain ranges and dense forests, making inland travel hazardous and cumbersome. In contrast most communities had easy access to natural ports and the coastal sea lanes; consequently, trade was primarily conducted as coastal shipping. Many stone engravings from the Nordic Stone Age and in particular the Nordic Bronze Age, depict ships in various situations, and valuable ships were sacrificed as part of ceremonial votive offerings since at least the Nordic Iron Age, as evidenced by the Hjortspring and Nydam boats.

The Viking Age saw the first local developments of trading ports into forts and coastal towns, all of which were deeply dependent on the North Sea and the Baltic Sea for survival and growth. Control of the waterways was of great economical and political importance, and consequently, ships were in high demand. The Hedeby coins, among the earliest known Danish currency, have impressions of ships as emblems, showing the importance of naval vessels in the area.

== Knarr ==
Knarr is the Norse term for ships that were built for cargo transport. A length of about and a beam of are not untypical, and the hull could be capable of carrying up to 24 tons. Overall displacement: 50 tons. This is shorter than the Gokstad type of longships, but knarrs are sturdier by design and they depended mostly on sail-power, only putting oars to use as auxiliaries if there was no wind on the open water. Because of this, the knarr was used for longer voyages, ocean-going transports and more hazardous trips than the Gokstad type. It was capable of sailing in one day, and held a crew of about 20–30. Knarrs routinely crossed the North Atlantic in the Viking Age, carrying livestock and goods to and from Greenland and the North Atlantic islands. The design of the knarr later influenced the design of the cog, used in the Baltic Sea by the Hanseatic League. Examples of Viking Age knarr are Skuldelev 1, which was excavated in Denmark in 1962 and is believed to be from about 1030 AD, and the , which was found in Sweden in 1933 and is believed to be from about 930 AD.

== Longship ==
Longships were naval vessels made and used by the Vikings from Scandinavia and Iceland for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during the Viking Age. The longship&#x27;s design evolved over many years, as seen in the Nydam and Kvalsund ships. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boatbuilding traditions until today. The average speed of Viking ships varied from ship to ship but lay in the range of , and the maximum speed of a longship under favorable conditions was from to .

The long-ship is as a long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow draft hull designed for speed. The ship&#x27;s shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one meter deep and permitted beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages. Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around. Longships were fitted with oars along almost the entire length of the boat itself. Later versions sported a rectangular sail on a single mast which was used to replace or augment the effort of the rowers, particularly during long journeys.

Longships can be classified into a number of different types, depending on size, construction details, and prestige. The most common way to classify longships is by the number of rowing positions on board. Types ranged from the Karvi, with 13 rowing benches, to the Busse, one of which has been found with an estimated 34 rowing positions.

Longships were the epitome of Scandinavian naval power at the time and were highly valued possessions. They were owned by coastal farmers and assembled by the king to form the leidang in times of conflict, in order to have a powerful naval force at his disposal. While longships were deployed by the Norse in warfare, there are no descriptions of naval tactics such as ramming, etc. Instead, the ships would sometimes be lashed together in battle to form a steady platform for infantry warfare. Longships were called dragonships (&quot;drakuskippan&quot;) by the Franks because they had a dragon-shaped prow.
=== Karve ===
The Karve was a small type of Viking longship, with a broad hull somewhat similar to the knarr. They were used for both war and ordinary transport, carrying people, cargo or livestock. Because they were able to navigate in very shallow water, they were also used for coasting. Karves typically had broad beams of approximately .

== Ship construction ==

Viking ships varied from other contemporary ships, being generally more seaworthy and lighter. This was achieved through use of clinker (lapstrake) construction of the hull. The planks on Viking vessels were riven (split) from large, old-growth trees - especially oak - as a riven plank is stronger than the sawn plank found in later craft. A single strake (plank) could be as thin as one inch (2.5 cm), resulting in a strong yet supple hull. Working up from a stout oaken keel and ribs, shipwrights fastened strakes to the keel and stem, and joined them with iron nails whose ends were hammered over a roves, or washers, to hold them in place. Each tier of planking overlapped the one below, and a caulking of tarred rope was used between planks to create a waterproof hull. The ships were strengthened structurally with crossbeams riding on top of each of the long floor timbers. The mast was supported by a keelson, a heavy timber block placed on top of the keel.

Remarkably large vessels could be constructed using traditional clinker construction. Dragon ships carrying 100 warriors were not uncommon. During the early Viking Age, oar ports replaced rowlocks, allowing oars to be stored while the ship was under sail to provide better angles for rowing. The largest ships of the era could travel five to six knots using oar power and up to ten knots under sail. Warships such as the &quot;skeid&quot; and the &quot;snekka&quot; were built with shallow drafts and equipped with sails. This combination endowed them with exceptional maneuvering capabilities and enabled them to land on beaches and sail up rivers.

== Navigation ==

With such technological improvements, the Vikings began to make more and more ocean voyages, as their ships were more seaworthy. However, in order to sail in ocean waters, the Vikings needed to develop methods of relatively precise navigation. Most commonly, a ship&#x27;s pilot drew on traditional knowledge to set the ship&#x27;s course. Essentially, the Vikings simply used prior familiarity with tides, sailing times, and landmarks in order to route courses. For example, scholars contend that the sighting of a whale allowed the Vikings to determine the direction of a ship. Because whales feed in highly nutritious waters, commonly found in regions where landmasses have pushed deep-water currents towards shallower areas, the sighting of a whale functioned as a signal that land was near.

Viking sagas routinely tell of voyages where Vikings suffered from being &quot;hafvilla&quot; (bewildered)—voyages beset by fog or bad weather, where they completely lost their sense of direction. This description suggests they did not use a sunstone when the sun was obscured. Moreover, the fact that this same bewilderment could arise when the winds died suggests that the Vikings relied on prevailing winds to navigate, as expected if their skills depended principally on traditional knowledge.

On the other hand, some academics have proposed that the Vikings also developed more advanced aids to navigation, such as the use of a sun compass. A wooden half-disc found on the shores of Narsarsuaq, Greenland initially seemed to support this hypothesis. However, further investigation of the object revealed that the slits inscribed in the disc are disproportionately spaced, and so the object could not in fact function as an accurate compass. Rather it has been suggested that the instrument is instead a &quot;confession disc&quot; used by priests to count the number of confessions in their parish. Similarly, researchers and historians continually debate the use of the sunstone in Viking navigation. Because a sunstone is able to polarize light, it is a plausible method for determining direction. By showing which direction light waves are oscillating, the sunstone has the potential to show the sun&#x27;s position even when the sun is obscured by clouds. The stone changes to a certain color, based on the direction of the waves, but only when the object is held in an area with direct sunlight. Thus, most scholars debate the reliability and the plausibility of using a navigational tool that can only determine direction in such limited conditions.

== Ship design ==
Viking ships were not only tools for navigation but also cultural symbols with high artistic design value. The carvings on Viking ships are known for their intricate geometric patterns, mythological creatures, and symbolic designs, primarily found on the bow, stern, and other wooden elements. These carvings were not only decorative but also embodied the Vikings&#x27; cultural and religious beliefs. Common Viking ship carving patterns and themes include animal motifs, geometric designs, mythological scenes, and inscriptions.

=== Animal motifs ===

Many Viking ships had intricately carved dragon heads or other mythical creatures on the bow and stern. These carvings served as a means to intimidate enemies and protect the sailors during their journeys. The quality and intricate design of the ship indicated the resources invested by its owner. Viking lords and nobles used large, elaborately carved ships to showcase their social status. Thus, ships were not only tools for war and exploration but also symbols of family identity. Possessing a well-carved ship symbolized a family&#x27;s wealth and influence, highlighting their place in Viking society. 

In some archaeological discoveries, experts found that the hulls of ships were adorned with rich patterns, such as intertwining vines, geometric shapes, or animal totems. These patterns are filled with symbolic meanings, many of which can be traced back to Viking mythology and belief systems. The famous Oseberg Ship, for example, has an interlocking animal motif on its bow: a ribbon-animal, gripping-beasts rendered with humanoid heads, and more ambiguous forms that echo the bodies of creatures seen at the prow. This is called the Oseberg Style, which is the first phase of the development of the Viking aesthetic, lasting from the year 775 to the year 850. It is known for its intertwining zoomorphic patterns of gripping beasts and ribbon-animals. Gripping beasts are strong, lively animals depicted with gripping feet and a frontal view of their heads.

The French historian, the monk at the St. Omér monastery in Flanders, in about 1040 wrote a detailed description of Viking ships, focusing on their elaborate decoration and the fleet&#x27;s formation. His account mentions that the Viking chieftains&#x27; ships were distinguished by the design of the bow, including gold figures of lions, wind-vanes of birds at the top of the mast, drakes spewing fire, bulls and dolphins in bronze, and human beings in silver and gold. The ships&#x27; sides were painted in vibrant colors and adorned with wood carvings, particularly the king&#x27;s vessel, which was the most intricately decorated. This passage serves as valuable evidence of the Vikings&#x27; investment in ship artistry as a reflection of power, wealth, and rank. The choice of metal animal motifs and the intricate designs on prominent vessels reveal how these ships were not only functional but also designed to display status and intimidate.

== Ship burial ==

Prominent men or women in Norse society sometimes received a ship burial. The body of the deceased would be prepared and dressed in fine clothes and then be transported to the burial-place in a wagon drawn by horses. The deceased would be placed on the ship, along with many prized possessions. Horses, dogs and occasionally thralls and households might also be sacrificially killed and buried with the deceased. The origin and meaning of these customs remain unknown. Several examples of Viking ship burials have been excavated, e.g. the Oseberg ship in Norway, containing the remains of two women, the Gokstad ship in Norway, and the Ladby ship in Denmark.

There are literary sources such as the Norse &quot;Skjoldunga Saga&quot; and the &quot;Ynglinga Saga&quot; which describe more literal &quot;ship burials&quot; in which the deceased and goods are placed on a boat in the water and the vessel is launched into the sea, sometimes being shot with burning arrows and vanishing into the night, ablaze. Nothcotte Toller, however, states:
Burial of ships is an ancient tradition in Scandinavia, stretching back to at least the Nordic Iron Age, as evidenced by the Hjortspring boat (400–300 BC) or the Nydam boats (200–450 AD), for example. Ships and bodies of water have held major spiritual importance in the Norse cultures since at least the Nordic Bronze Age.

== Preserved ships ==

Several original Viking ships have been found through the ages, but only a few have been relatively intact. The most notable of these few ships include:
* Gokstad ship: overall length – approximately 
* Oseberg ship: overall length – approximately 
* Skuldelev ships: five ships found at the same location, from about long
* Tune ship: may have been up to long

Examples of other Viking ships, including some that are relatively well-preserved and some, where only very small parts remain:
* Gjellestad ship burial: about long (excavation ongoing as of June 2020)
* Hedeby 1: estimated about long
* Kvalsund ship
* Ladby ship
* Myklebust Ship
* : found during the expansion of the Viking Ship Museum and the longest known Viking ship at about 

Have been regarded as Viking ships, but from before or after the Viking Age:
* Salme ships: from 700 to 750 AD, before the Viking Age
* : from 1250 to 1300 AD, after the Viking Age

== Replicas ==

Viking ship replicas are one of the more common types of ship replica. &quot;Viking&quot;, the first Viking ship replica, was built by the Rødsverven shipyard in Sandefjord, Norway. In 1893 it sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to Chicago for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. There are a considerable number of modern reconstructions of Viking Age ships in service around Northern Europe and North America. The Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark, has been particularly prolific in building accurate reconstructions of archaeological finds in its collection.

<doc id="175074" wikidata="Q228409" url="?curid=175074" title="Kali Yuga">
<text>Kali Yuga &quot;(कलियुग )&quot;, in Hinduism, is the fourth, shortest, and worst of the four &quot;yugas&quot; (world ages) in a &quot;Yuga cycle&quot;, preceded by &quot;Dvapara Yuga&quot; and followed by the next cycle&#x27;s &quot;Krita (Satya) Yuga&quot;. It is believed to be the present age, which is full of conflict and sin.

According to Puranic sources, Krishna&#x27;s death marked the end of &quot;Dvapara Yuga&quot; and the start of &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, which is dated to 17/18 February 3102 BCE. Lasting for 432,000 years (1,200 divine years), &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; began years ago and has years left as of 2025 CE. &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; will end in the year 428,899 CE.

Near the end of &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, when virtues are at their worst, a cataclysm and a re-establishment of &quot;dharma&quot; occur to usher in the next cycle&#x27;s &quot;Krita (Satya) Yuga&quot;, prophesied to occur by Kalki.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Yuga&quot; (), in this context, means &quot;an age of the world&quot;, where its archaic spelling is &quot;yug&quot;, with other forms of &quot;yugam&quot;, , and &quot;yuge&quot;, derived from &quot;yuj&quot; (), believed derived from &quot;&quot; (Proto-Indo-European: &#x27;to join or unite&#x27;).

&quot;Kali Yuga&quot; () means &quot;the age of Kali&quot;, &quot;the age of darkness&quot;, &quot;the age of vice and misery&quot;, or &quot;the age of quarrel and hypocrisy&quot;.

A complete description of &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; is found in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Manusmriti&quot;, &quot;Vishnu Smriti&quot;, and various Puranas.

== Epigraphy ==
According to P. V. Kane, one of the earliest inscriptions with one of the four &quot;yugas&quot; named is the Pikira grant of Pallava Simhavarman (mid-5th centuryCE):

Other epigraphs exist with named &quot;yugas&quot; in the Old Mysore region of India, published in &quot;Epigraphia Carnatica&quot;.

== Start date ==

The start date and time of &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; was at midnight (00:00) on 17/18 February 3102 BCE.

Astronomer and mathematician Aryabhata, who was born in 476 CE, finished his book &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; in 499 CE, in which he wrote &quot;When the three yugas (satyug, tretayug and dwaparyug) have elapsed and 60 x 60 (3,600) years of kaliyug have already passed, I am now 23 years old.&quot; Based on this information, &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; began in 3102 BCE, which is calculated from 3600 - (476 + 23) + 1 (no year zero from 1 BCE to 1 CE).

According to K. D. Abhyankar, the starting point of Kali Yuga is an extremely rare planetary alignment, which is depicted in the Mohenjo-daro seals.

== Duration and structure ==
Hindu texts describe four &quot;yugas&quot; (world ages)⁠ in a &quot;Yuga Cycle&quot;, where, starting in order from the first age of &quot;Krita (Satya) Yuga&quot;, each &quot;yuga&#x27;s&quot; length decreases by one-fourth (25%), giving proportions of 4:3:2:1. Each &quot;yuga&quot; is described as having a main period ( &quot;yuga&quot; proper) preceded by its (dawn) and followed by its (dusk)⁠, where each twilight (dawn/dusk) lasts for one-tenth (10%) of its main period. Lengths are given in divine years (years of the gods), each lasting for 360 solar (human) years.

&quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, the fourth age in a cycle, lasts for 432,000 years (1,200 divine years), where its main period lasts for 360,000 years (1,000 divine years) and its two twilights each last for 36,000 years (100 divine years). The current cycle&#x27;s &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, the present age, has the following dates based on it starting in 3102BCE:

&quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Book 12 (Shanti Parva), Ch. 231:

&quot;Manusmriti&quot;, Ch. 1:

&quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot;, Ch. 1:

== 10,000-year sub-period ==
A dialogue between Krishna and Ganga found in the &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot; describes that for the first 10,000 years of &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, the ill effects of &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; will be reduced due to the presence of bhakti yogis and the ability to nullify sinful reactions, after which Earth will be devoid of devout religious people and be shackled by &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;. Gaudiya Vaishnavism believes this sub-period started later in &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; with the birth of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486 CE).

== Characteristics ==
Hinduism often symbolically represents morality (&quot;dharma&quot;) as an Indian bull. In the Satya Yuga, the first stage of development, the bull has four legs, which is reduced by one in each age that follows. The four legs of Dharma are &#x27; , &#x27; , &#x27; and &#x27; . By the age of Kali, morality is reduced to only a quarter of that of the golden age, so that the bull of Dharma has only one leg, the one representing .

===References in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;===
The Kurukshetra War and the decimation of Kauravas thus happened at the &quot;Yuga-Sandhi&quot;, the point of transition from one yuga to another.

=== Prophesied events ===
A discourse by Markandeya in the Mahabharata identifies some of the attributes of people, animals, nature, and weather during the Kali Yuga.

== Other usage ==
The Kali Yuga is an important concept in both Theosophy and Anthroposophy, and in the writings of Helena Blavatsky, W.Q. Judge, Rudolf Steiner, Savitri Devi, and Traditionalist philosophers such as René Guénon and Julius Evola, among others. Rudolf Steiner believed that the Kali Yuga ended in 1900.

<text>A yuga, in Hinduism, is generally used to indicate an age of time.

In the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, a &quot;yuga&quot; refers to generations, a period of time (whether long or short), or a yoke (joining of two things). In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the words &quot;yuga&quot; and &quot;kalpa&quot; (a day of Brahma) are used interchangeably to describe the cycle of creation and destruction.

In post-Vedic texts, the words &quot;yuga&quot; and &quot;age&quot; commonly denote a  (pronounced &quot;chatur yuga&quot;), a cycle of four world ages—for example, in the &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; and &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; (part of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;)—unless expressly limited by the name of one of its minor ages: &quot;Krita (Satya) Yuga&quot;, &quot;Treta Yuga&quot;, &quot;Dvapara Yuga&quot;, or &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;.

The term &quot;yuga&quot; can represent the number 4. In early Indian astronomy, it referred to a five-year cycle starting with the conjunction of the sun and moon in the autumnal equinox.

==Etymology==
&quot;Yuga&quot; () means &quot;a yoke&quot; (joining of two things), &quot;generations&quot;, or &quot;a period of time&quot; such as an age, where its archaic spelling is &quot;yug&quot;, with other forms of &quot;yugam&quot;, , and &quot;yuge&quot;, derived from &quot;yuj&quot; (), believed derived from &quot;&quot; (Proto-Indo-European: &#x27;to join or unite&#x27;).

<text>Telemark () is a county and a current electoral district in Norway. Telemark borders the counties of Vestfold, Buskerud, Vestland, Rogaland and Agder. In 2020, Telemark merged with the county of Vestfold to form the county of Vestfold og Telemark. On 1 January 2024, the county of Telemark was re-established after Vestfold og Telemark was divided again.

The name &quot;Telemark&quot; means the &quot;mark of the Thelir&quot;, the ancient North Germanic tribe that inhabited what is now known as Upper Telemark in the Migration Period and the Viking Age.

In the Middle Ages, the agricultural society of Upper Telemark was considered the most violent region of Norway. Today, half of the buildings from medieval times in Norway are located here. The dialects spoken in Upper Telemark also retain more elements of Old Norse than those spoken elsewhere in the country. Upper Telemark is also known as the birthplace of skiing.

The southern part of Telemark, Grenland, is more urban and influenced by trade with the Low Countries, northern Germany, Denmark and the British Isles.

Telemark has been one of Norway&#x27;s most important industrial regions for centuries, marked in particular by the Norske Skog Union paper mills in Grenland and the Norsk Hydro heavy water and fertilizer production in Upper Telemark.

Telemark county was re-established on 1 January 2024, following a vote of the county council of Vestfold og Telemark on 15 February 2022 to split the newly established county into its respective counties that existed before the merger took place; Telemark and Vestfold.

== History ==

Telemark county was established as the fief Bratsberg in the late Middle Ages, during Norway&#x27;s union with Denmark. With the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1662 it became a county, and it was renamed Telemark in 1919 and was a county until 2020. The county administration was in the port town Skien, which was in the early modern period Norway&#x27;s most important city, ahead of Christiania.

Telemark consists of several distinct historical regions. It takes its name from the largest of them, which is now called Upper Telemark, but which was historically simply called Telemark. Telemark is named for the Thelir (Þilir in Old Norse), the ancient North Germanic tribe that inhabited what is now known as Upper Telemark since the Migration Period and during the Viking Age. The Norse form of the name was &quot;Þelamǫrk&quot;. The first element is the genitive plural case of &quot;Þilir&quot; while the last element is &quot;mǫrk&quot; &quot;woodland, borderland, march&quot;.

Traditional Telemark, i.e. Upper Telemark, is located in the inland and comprises more than two thirds of it according to its traditional definition. Both in medieval times and later (Upper) Telemark was the region of Norway with the most self-owning farmers. It retained Norse culture to a larger degree than any other region in Norway, with respect to its more egalitarian organisation of society, religion, traditional values and language. Thus the people of Telemark were often described during the Middle Ages and early modern era as the most violent in Norway. The dialects of Upper Telemark are also the dialects of Norwegian that are closest to Old Norse. The farmers of Telemark were marked by a strong-willed conservatism and belief in their traditional values that often defied the central authorities of Denmark-Norway; for example they held on to aspects of both Old Norse religion and later of Catholicism longer than other regions in Norway. (Upper) Telemark traditionally lacks cities entirely.

Grenland and the Skien fjord are flatter regions located closer to or at the coast. Historically Grenland referred to what is now called Midt-Telemark, but over time the name Grenland has come to refer to the Skien fjord area. The latter is traditionally characterized by its cities and its involvement in seafaring and trade. It also includes several larger agricultural properties and estates, as well as industry. The culture and social structure are more urban, far less traditional, more influenced by contact with continental Europe and far less egalitarian. The most important city of the region, Skien, was historically one of Norway&#x27;s most important cities, although its importance declined after the Napoleonic Wars. The playwright Henrik Ibsen was a native of Skien, and many of his plays are set in places reminiscent of the city and area.

During the Dano-Norwegian union the traditional regions of Telemark and Grenland/the Skien fjord became the fief (&quot;len&quot;) and later county (&quot;amt&quot;) of Bratsberg (Bradsberg). The fief and county was named after the farm Bratsberg, since this was the seat of the governor. In 1919 Bratsberg county was renamed Telemark. Despite this, Grenland retains a separate identity that is distinct from Telemark proper; the minority in the Storting voted for the name Grenland–Telemark in 1918.

Upper Telemark, particularly Kviteseid, is known as the birthplace of skiing as a modern sport. Telemark lent its name to Telemark skiing, a style invented by Sondre Norheim, and the characteristic Telemark landing of ski jumping. Telemark is also known as the centre of the &quot;Bunad&quot; movement. Telemark has more buildings from medieval times than any other Norwegian region.

==Geography==
Telemark is located in southeastern Norway, extending from the Hardangervidda mountain plateau in the North to the Skagerrak coast in the South. Telemark has a varied and scenic landscape, including a rugged coastline, valleys, lakes, hills mountains, and mountain plateaus.

Southern Telemark is the location of the Gea Norvegica UNESCO Global Geopark (UGG), established in 2006. The UGG carries significance to Norway with an abundance of larvikite along the Oslo Rift, Paleozoic fossils, geological artifacts of glacial retreat from the last glacial maximum, and rocks from the Sveconorwegian Orogeny. It is the first UGG in Scandinavia.

== Infrastructure ==
The international road E18 goes through the southern parts of Telemark, namely Grenland and the municipality of Kragerø. E134, another important motorway and the fastest route between Oslo and Bergen, goes through the municipalities of Vinje, Tokke, Kviteseid, Seljord, Hjartdal and Notodden. RV36, stretching from Porsgrunn to Seljord, links the E18 and E134 motorways.

Telemark is well served by railways. The Sørlandet Line runs through the traditional districts of Vestmar and Midt-Telemark, serving the municipalities of Drangedal, Nome, Bø and Sauherad. Grenland is primarily served by the Vestfold Line, but also has connections through the Bratsberg Line which runs between Skien and Notodden.

From Langesund, Fjordline operates ferry services to Sweden and Denmark.

The main bus lines in the region are operated by Telemark Bilruter, serving western and middle parts of the region, and Nettbuss which serves the middle, eastern and southern parts of the region. Drangedal Bilruter serves the Vestmar region.

==Population==
The largest population centres are Skien, Porsgrunn, Notodden, Rjukan and Kragerø. Other important places are Bø, Seljord, Fyresdal and Vinje.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of Telemark is from modern times (1970). It shows an old type of battle axe, significant for the county.

The county coat of arms valid from 1 January 2024 is a redesigned version of the county coat of arms for Telemark county from 1970 until the county merger in 2020.

==Districts==

The county is conventionally divided into traditional districts. Traditionally the county is mainly divided into Upper Telemark (historically called simply Telemark or more recently Telemark proper) and Grenland. Upper Telemark is sometimes subdivided into Vest-Telemark and Aust-Telemark. The name Lower Telemark traditionally refers to Grenland and Midt-Telemark, but was more of an administrative region than a cultural one. Regardless of definition, Upper Telemark constitutes the largest part by far. For example, the modern provostship of Upper Telemark comprises 12 municipalities and more than 80% of Telemark, also including Midt-Telemark.

An additional district, Vestmar is disputed. The district borders of this county are highly overlapping and to a certain extent undefined and/or disputed.

<doc id="175079" wikidata="Q1214986" url="?curid=175079" title="Man of Aran">
<text>Man of Aran is a 1934 Irish fictional documentary (ethnofiction) film shot, written and directed by Robert J. Flaherty about life on the Aran Islands off the western coast of Ireland. It portrays characters living in premodern conditions, documenting their daily routines such as fishing off high cliffs, farming potatoes where there is little soil, and hunting for huge basking sharks to get liver oil for lamps. Some situations are fabricated, such as one scene in which the shark fishermen are almost lost at sea in a sudden gale. Additionally, the family members shown are not actually related, having been chosen from among the islanders for their photogenic qualities.

George C. Stoney&#x27;s 1978 documentary &quot;How the Myth was Made&quot;, which is included in the special features of the DVD, relates that the Aran Islanders had not hunted sharks in this way for over fifty years at the time the film was made. &quot;Man of Aran&quot; is Flaherty&#x27;s recreation of culture on the edges of modern society, even though much of the primitive life depicted had been left behind by the 1930s. It is impressive, however, for its drama, for its spectacular cinematography of landscape and seascape, and for its concise editing.

==Synopsis==
Man has to fight for his existence in the Aran Islands. Three men, among them &quot;A Man of Aran&quot;, land a flimsy currach in the midst of high winds and huge waves with help from &quot;His Wife&quot; and &quot;Their Son&quot;. The Man and his Wife work to make a field on the barren rocks using seaweed and soil scraped out of rock crevices. The Man fixes a hole in his boat with a mixture of cloth and tar. His Son sits on the edge of a cliff and uses a crab he caught earlier as bait to catch a fish in the water below.

The Man, working with four other fishermen in a slightly larger boat than before, harpoons a giant basking shark. They lose that one after a fight and later spend two days wearing another one down before they can bring it back to shore. The whole village comes down to the beach to either watch or to help drag the carcass out of the water. The Wife renders the shark&#x27;s liver to get oil for the lamps on the island.

More sharks are still passing by on their migration, so the local fishermen head back out to sea, even though the weather looks like it might turn. No one will take the Son with them. There is a storm, and the Wife and Son can only watch from shore while the Man and his two shipmates struggle to get their boat to land safely against the elements. Everyone is reunited, but the Man&#x27;s boat is crushed by the waves and rocks. The family turns and makes their way back to their cottage.

==Production==
Stung by criticism that British films were flaccid imitations of those being produced in Hollywood, Michael Balcon of Gaumont British hired the acclaimed writer/director Robert Flaherty and his wife Frances (&quot;Nanook of the North&quot; (1922), &quot;Moana&quot; (1926), &quot;Elephant Boy&quot; (1937), &quot;The Land&quot; (1942), &quot;Louisiana Story&quot; (1948)) to prove the British film industry&#x27;s cultural excellence as well as commercial success. In 1931, Robert Flaherty set up a studio and laboratory facilities on Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands. Flaherty had promised Balcon he could shoot the entire film for £10,000. Over the next two years, he shot over 200,000 feet of film for a 74-minute documentary, oftentimes filming the same event time after time. As Flaherty says, &quot;our films are made with film and time, I need lots of both.&quot; Balcon eventually called a halt to filming as the costs approached £40,000.

Like most 1930s documentaries, &quot;Man of Aran&quot; was shot as a silent film. The intermittent voices, the sound effects, and music are only accompaniments to the visuals and not considered integral to the production. Paul Rotha in &quot;Documentary Film&quot; says, &quot;&quot;Man of Aran&quot; avoided all important issues raised by sound&quot;.

Flaherty continued to experiment with cinematography especially the long focal lens that he first used in &quot;Nanook&quot;. He used a variety of lens sizes, even a seventeen-inch long lens, which was twice the size of the camera. He used a spring driven camera that &quot;was simpler in operation than any I have seen and not much heavier to carry than a portable typewriter&quot;.

==Release and initial reception==
On 25 April 1934, &quot;Man of Aran&quot; premiered at the New Gallery in London. The screening had been preceded by a major publicity drive. A stuffed basking shark was put on display in the window of Gaumont British in Wardour Street, and Irish Guards played Irish folk music in the theater foyer on the first night. The islanders were brought over from Aran and paraded before the press and public in their simple homespun island garb. &quot;Man of Aran&quot; won top prize for the best foreign film at the 2nd Venice International Film Festival, the Mussolini Cup. During the first six months of its release the film grossed about £50,000; many films had grossed more, but according to Michael Balcon it brought Gaumont British the prestige he wanted.

When it opened in Dublin on 6 May 1934, &quot;Man of Aran&quot; was a major political and cultural event to the nascent Irish Free State and was attended by the President of the Executive Council, Éamon de Valera. The Irish government saw it as confirmation of their social and economic policies and so enthusiastically received the film. &quot;Man of Aran&quot; suited Fianna Fáil, as it encouraged an image of Ireland that was fiercely traditional, definitively rural, and resilient in the face of hardship.

The film&#x27;s depiction of man&#x27;s courage and repudiation of the intellect also appealed to the Nazis, who raved over it during the Berlin Festival in 1935. As Luke Gibbons has written, this portrayal of the harsh life on the west coast of Ireland was often taken to heart by those who viewed it.

Some critics believed &quot;Man of Aran&quot; socially irrelevant. Instead of returning with a film about Island poverty and an indictment of the absentee landlord, they claim Flaherty brought back a film about dewy-eyed urchins. Grierson argues that Flaherty&#x27;s &#x27;NeoRousseauism&#x27;, the glorification of a simpler and more primitive way of life, meant he could not develop a form adequate to the more immediate material in the modern world. Paul Rotha faulted &quot;Man of Aran&quot; for its alleged avoidance of economic and social reality. At the time of &quot;Man of Aran&quot;&#x27;s release, socialist critic Ralph Bond commented “…we are more concerned with what Flaherty has left out than with what he has put in…Flaherty would have us believe that there is no class struggle on Aran despite ample evidence to the contrary&quot;. It is claimed that Flaherty ignored the effects of such worldwide events as the depression of the 1930s, suggesting to the audience that the Aran Islands were isolated economically as they were geographically.

==Subsequent analysis and criticism==
The current reputation of &quot;Man of Aran&quot; rests as much on controversies over truth and accuracy as on its aesthetic achievement. Some contend that &quot;Man of Aran&quot; is more valuable as a documentary of Robert Flaherty&#x27;s vision of life than it is of life itself. Others see it as a betrayal of documentary&#x27;s mission, &quot;to tell it like it is&quot;. And yet, according to Richard Barsam, Flaherty is one of the great innovators of the documentary form...creating a nonfiction genre all of his own.

According to anthropologist John Messenger, there are over 100 factual errors in the film. Among the more notable is the shark-hunting sequence, which dominates the latter half of the story. Kimball says this practice had disappeared so long ago that the islanders did not know how to make or use the harpoons and had to be taught the skills of the hunt. Messenger, who visited Islands between 1958 and 1968, goes further, claiming that the islanders never had engaged in shark hunting then, or at any time in the past. Flaherty brought fishermen from Scotland to teach the locals how it is done. &quot;Flaherty...created new customs, such as shark fishing, and seriously distorted numerous indigenous ones in order to make the &quot;Man of Aran&quot; fit his preconceptions and titillate the camera&quot;. Flaherty himself admits the shark fishing sequence was needed for the box-office.

However, the claim is not correct as whale and shark fishing were both known to occur and commercially viable operations up until a few years prior to the filming.
Arranmore Whaling Co., 1908–1913; Blacksod Whaling Co., 1910–1914; and Akties Nordhavet Co.(Northern Seas)/Blacksod Whaling Co 1920–1922, may be adduced as evidence that it was a few years and not the hundreds claimed by some critiques. Only 11 years prior to filming, whaling was occurring on a commercial scale.

Other claims and controversies include the artificial creating of the Aran family out of unrelated cast members. They were handpicked by Flaherty to play the roles of mother, father, and son. In another sequence, Flaherty shows the mother buffeted by a storm as she carries seaweed along the Inishmore cliffs. What appears to be a traditional activity carried out by Aran women is a fabrication.The seaweed is collected for fertilization and is gathered from the low-lying shores twice per month, and only when the tides are absolutely calm. And Kimball points out that religion, which is rooted in the islanders lives, even among the locally recruited actors, is entirely absent. Flaherty also exposed the islanders to great risk, asking them to perform the most astonishing feats in stormy seas despite the fact none of the islanders could swim. As Flaherty says, &quot;looking back I should have been shot for what I asked these superb people to do for the film...for the enormous risks...and all for the sake of a keg of porter and five pound a piece&quot;.

The full extent of &quot;Man of Aran&quot;&#x27;s artifices was revealed at the 1978 Ethnographic Film Conference in Canberra, Australia. The conference had gathered, in part, to praise direct cinema which, in contrast to the classic tradition, promised a new level of realistic interpretation. This new form swept away staging and reconstruction to present a more accurate picture of the world. The debate was touched off by a screening of Flaherty’s &quot;Man of Aran&quot; followed by George Stoney’s just completed documentary exploration of Robert Flaherty’s &quot;Man of Aran, How the Myth Was Made&quot;, and the resulting exchange was &quot;tumultuous&quot;. As James Roy MacBean says: &quot;While appreciative of Flaherty’s poetic imagery [George Stoney] had popped the lid off all the distortions and omissions in Flaherty’s highly romanticized depiction of life on the Aran Islands&quot;. At the time, Stoney’s revelatory documentary had left many at the conference incensed at what they now saw as Flaherty’s blatant falsification of the life he had been purported to be documenting.

According to Barsam, &quot;Flaherty’s subjective view of reality – his making it all up – has a romantic basis, idealizing the simple, natural even non-existent life&quot;. He argues that even though Flaherty habitually transforms reality, his essential achievement is that of the realist filmmaker. The idea of Flaherty as Romantic is shared by Aufderheide: &quot;Flaherty had a powerful romantic belief in the purity of native cultures and he believed that his own culture was spiritually impoverished by comparison&quot;. Taken to the extreme, this approach makes no attempt to capture reality but create a romanticized picture of it: &quot;The tragedy is that, being a poet, with a poet&#x27;s eye, Flaherty’s lie is greater, for he can make romance seem real&quot;.

Aufderheide says, &quot;documentary movies are about real life: they are not real life they are not even windows onto real life. They are portraits of real life, using real life as their raw material...You might then say: [a documentary] is a movie that does its best to represent real life and that doesn’t manipulate it...and yet, there is no way to make a film without manipulating the information. As Flaherty acknowledges, &quot;one often has to distort a thing to catch its true spirit&quot;. 
How much a documentarian can manipulate and still credibly claim their film to be a truthful portrayal of real life &quot;is a never-ending discussion with many answers&quot;.

Despite these controversies, Flaherty remains a pioneer of the documentary whose films are situated in a class of their own within the documentary genre. Kimball argues that &quot;Man of Aran&quot; never was intended to be an ethnographic documentary film. As he explains, &quot;in a cosmic anthropological sense it could be counted as an artistic rendition of the struggle of man against nature&quot;. Flaherty had immersed himself in the culture to tell the essence of the truth about the Islanders, &quot;[and] for this reason ethnographic accuracy is an unimportant consideration when the larger goal is some fundamental aspect of mankind&quot;. In Stoney’s film &quot;How the Myth Was Made&quot;, John Goldman, the editor on &quot;Man of Aran&quot;, is emphatic, &quot;it was not a documentary, it was not intended to be a documentary...it was a piece of poetry&quot;. McNab calls it &quot;not so much a conventional documentary as a poetic meditation&quot;. Arthur Calder-Marshall explains, &quot;Flaherty wasn’t interested in actuality, he was interested in his own idea of life&quot;. If the film was intended to be a poetic statement instead of a factual documentary, one has no right to treat it as an ethnographic film now. Barsam asks, is it unreasonable for the artist to distill life over a period of time and deliver only the essence of it? Seen as the story of mankind over a thousand years, the story of Aran is this story of man against the sea...It is a simple story, but it is an essential story, for nothing emerges from time except bravery. Calder-Marshall suggests the controversies over &quot;Man of Aran&quot; could have been avoided if [Flaherty] had had a publicity adviser, someone as verbally agile as Grierson, who had made it publicly plain that &quot;Man of Aran&quot; was not a &#x27;document&#x27; but an ‘eclogue’ – a pastoral and marine poem.

Brian Winston cautions against unconditionally praising Flaherty&#x27;s poetic talent. He argues we have to acknowledge his manipulations and distortions because that is at the heart of understanding both his genius and his contribution to the documentary form. What Flaherty grasped was not only our desire for drama, but that it should arise from the life being observed and not imposed from without. By using drama and reconstruction, Flaherty created a unique form of documentary, which thrives between &quot;a life as lived and life as narrativised&quot;.

==Artistic legacy==
Richard Leacock, who went to school with Flaherty&#x27;s daughters and later worked as the cinematographer on &quot;Louisiana Story&quot;, says that Flaherty taught him to concentrate on finding images: &quot;You look, you search. You think of the image not merely as a way of showing something but also as a way of withholding information, of creating tension in the viewer. Of not revealing too much. Of seeing things with different perspectives by using different focal-length lenses&quot;. Flaherty says he owes almost everything to these long lenses and with them captured some of the most memorable sea footage ever recorded. Corliss says &quot;Man of Aran&quot; was very different from his earlier work, “…the chiaroscuro compositions, charcoal rock, black-clad figures against a gray sky, are light-years removed from the natural grandeur of &quot;Nanook of the North&quot; or the easy elegance of &quot;Moana&quot;. Corliss suggests there are enough similarities between Flaherty and John Ford, Chaplin, Borzage, even Disney that place him firmly in a tradition of the romantic visionary American. Winston sees the influence of Flaherty in Leni Riefenstahl films, arguing that her aesthetics of manipulation owed much to his pioneering work. McLoon goes further, suggesting &quot;the cult of beauty, and fetishism of courage&quot; in &quot;Man of Aran&quot; are the tropes of Fascism. He goes on to exonerate Flaherty of any Nazi connection saying &quot;it is a measure of the apolitical nature of Flaherty’s vision that he was unaware of this problem inherent in his nineteenth-century primitive sensibility&quot;.

&quot;The Cripple of Inishmaan&quot; (1996) by Martin McDonagh is a play set on the Aran Islands at the time of the filming of &quot;Man of Aran&quot;.

The UK rock band Sea Power were asked to record a new soundtrack for the film&#x27;s 2009 DVD release, performing the score at a series of live events in the UK including one accompanying the film itself at the British Film Institute.

Flaherty&#x27;s legacy is the subject of the 2010 British Universities Film &amp; Video Council award-winning and FOCAL International award-nominated documentary &quot;A Boatload of Wild Irishmen&quot; (so named because, after the staged climactic sequence of &quot;Man of Aran&quot;, Flaherty said he&#x27;d been accused of &quot;trying to drown a boatload of wild Irishmen&quot;), written by Professor Brian Winston of University of Lincoln, UK, and directed by Mac Dara Ó Curraidhín.

<doc id="175080" wikidata="Q1482645" url="?curid=175080" title="Tribalism">
<text>Tribalism is the state of being organized by, or advocating for, tribes or tribal lifestyles. Human evolution primarily occurred in small hunter-gatherer groups, as opposed to in larger and more recently settled agricultural societies or civilizations. With a negative connotation and in a political context, tribalism can also mean discriminatory behavior or attitudes towards out-groups, based on in-group loyalty.

== Definition ==
The word &quot;tribe&quot; can be defined to mean an extended kin group or clan with a common ancestor, or can also be described as a group who share the common interest of mutual survival and preservation of a common culture. The proverb &quot;&quot; describes homophily, the human tendency to form friendship networks with people of similar occupations, interests, and habits. Some tribes can be located in geographically proximate areas, like villages or bands, and although telecommunications in theory could enable groups of people to form tribe-like communities, digital tribes and social networking websites are not quite tribes in that they do not inherently provide the mutual survival of both the individual members of the tribe and for the tribe itself, as tribes do.

In terms of conformity, the word &quot;tribalism&quot; has been defined as a &quot;subjectivity&quot; or &quot;way of being&quot; social frame in which communities are bound socially beyond immediate birth ties by the dominance of various modalities of face-to-face and object integration. Ontologically, tribalism is oriented around the valences of analogy, genealogy and mythology. That means that customary tribes have their social foundations in some variation of these tribal orientations, while often taking on traditional practices (e.g. Abrahamic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam), and modern practices, including monetary exchange, mobile communications, and modern education.

Tribalism in a political sense refers to the strong political solidarity typical of post-truth politics.

== Social structure ==
The social structure of a tribe can vary greatly from case to case. The relatively small size of customary tribes results in a social life which usually involve a relatively few significant political or economic distinctions between individuals. As a result, social hierarchy is uncommon, and deep bonds are made between individual members.

A tribe often refers to itself using its own language&#x27;s word for &quot;people&quot;, and refers to other, neighboring tribes with various words to distinguish them as other. For example, the term &quot;Inuit&quot; translates to &quot;people&quot;.

== Types ==
Tribalism implies the possession of a strong cultural or ethnic identity that separates one member of a group from the members of another group. Based on strong relations of proximity and kinship, as well as relations based on the mutual survival of both the individual members of the tribe and for the tribe itself, members of a tribe tend to possess a strong feeling of identity. Objectively, for a customary tribal society to form there needs to be ongoing customary organization, inquiry, and exchange. However, intense feelings of common identity can lead people to feel tribally connected.

The distinction between these two definitions of &quot;tribalism&quot;, objective and subjective, is an important one because while &quot;tribal societies&quot; have been pushed to the edges of the Western world, &quot;tribalism&quot;, by the second definition, is arguably undiminished. A few writers have postulated that the human brain is hard-wired towards tribalism, but that claim is usually linked to equating original questions of sociality with tribalism.

== Concept evolution ==
Tribalism has a very adaptive effect in human evolution. Humans are social animals and ill-equipped to live on their own. Tribalism and social bonding help to keep individuals committed to the group, even when personal relations may fray. That keeps individuals from wandering off or joining other groups. It also leads to bullying when a tribal member is unwilling to conform to the politics of the collective.

Some scholars argue that inclusive fitness in humans involves kin selection and kin altruism, in which groups of an extended family with shared genes help others with similar genes, based on their coefficient of relationship (the amount of genes they have in common). Other scholars argue that fictive kinship is common in human organizations, allowing non-kin members to collaborate in groups like fraternities.

Socially, divisions between groups fosters specialized interactions with others, based on association: altruism (positive interactions with unrelated members), kin-selectivity (positive interactions with related members) and violence (negative interactions). Thus, groups with a strong sense of unity and identity can benefit from kin selection behaviour such as common property and shared resources. The tendencies of members to unite against an outside tribe and the ability to act violently and prejudicially against that outside tribe likely boosted the chances of survival in genocidal conflicts.

Modern examples of tribal genocide rarely reflect the defining characteristics of tribes existing prior to the Neolithic Revolution; for example, small population and close-relatedness.

According to a study by Robin Dunbar at the University of Liverpool, social group size is determined by primate brain size. Dunbar&#x27;s conclusion was that most human brains can really understand only an average of 150 individuals as fully developed, complex people. That is known as Dunbar&#x27;s number. In contrast, anthropologist H. Russell Bernard and Peter Killworth have done a variety of field studies in the United States that came up with an estimated mean number of ties, 290, roughly double Dunbar&#x27;s estimate. The Bernard–Killworth median of 231 is lower because of upward straggle in the distribution, but it is still appreciably larger than Dunbar&#x27;s estimate.

Malcolm Gladwell expanded on this conclusion sociologically in his book, &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, where members of one of his types, &quot;Connectors&quot;, were successful by their larger-than-average number of close friendships and capacity for maintaining them, which tie together otherwise-unconnected social groups. According to such studies, then, &quot;tribalism&quot; is a hard-to-escape fact of human neurology simply because many human brains are not adapted to working with large populations. Once a person&#x27;s limit for connection is reached, the human brain resorts to some combination of hierarchical schemes, stereotypes and other simplified models to understand so many people.

== Negative outcomes ==
Anthropologists engage in ongoing debate on the phenomenon of warfare among tribes. While fighting typically and certainly occurs among horticultural tribes, an open question remains whether such warfare is a typical feature of hunter-gatherer life or is an anomaly found only in certain circumstances, such as scarce resources (as with the Inuit or Arabs) or only among food-producing societies.

Certain tribes use forms of subsistence such as horticulture and foraging that cannot yield the same number of absolute calories as agriculture. Those subsistance methods thus limit those tribal populations significantly, especially when compared to agricultural populations. Jesse Mathis writes in &quot;War Before Civilization&quot; that examples exist with low percentage rates of casualties in tribal battle, and some tribal battles were much more lethal as a percentage of population than, for example, the Battle of Gettysburg. He concludes that no evidence consistently indicates that primitive battles are proportionately less lethal than civilized ones.

The realistic conflict theory is a model of intergroup conflict, arguing that in a real or perceived zero-sum system, conflicts arise over shared interests for finite resources. The 1954 Robbers Cave experiment involved researchers putting 12-year-old boys into groups, where they formed their own ingroups, before then developing hostility and negativity towards the other group during simulated conflict over finite resources in a zero-sum game.

==Criticism==
Various authors, such as Aidan Southall, have attacked the notion of tribe as a tool of colonial ideology, and identified modern tribalism as a product of colonial governance in Africa. The Africa Policy Information Center describes the term, and &quot;tribalism&quot; in particular as a byword for ethnic strife, as invoking negative stereotypes of Africa as a land of primitive and territorial peoples.

An April, 2021 article published in The Journal of Hospital Medicine titled &quot;Tribalism: The Good, The Bad, and The Future&quot; by Zahir Kanjee and Leslie Bilello of Harvard Medical School was retracted due to protest from readers over the use of the terms &quot;tribe&quot; and &quot;tribalism&quot;. The article was then republished with the title &quot;Leadership and Professional Development: Specialty Silos in Medicine&quot; along with an apology from the editor-in-chief. The revised version of the article substituted the terms &quot;groups&quot; and &quot;medical specialties&quot; for &quot;tribes&quot;, and &quot;siloed&quot; and &quot;factional&quot; for &quot;tribalism&quot;.

<text>Humanitarianism is an ideology centered on the value of human life, whereby humans practice benevolent treatment and provide assistance to other humans to reduce suffering and improve the conditions of humanity for moral, altruistic, and emotional reasons. 

One aspect involves voluntary emergency aid overlapping with human rights advocacy, actions taken by governments, development assistance, and domestic philanthropy. Other critical issues include correlation with religious beliefs, motivation of aid between altruism, market affinity, social control
imperialism and neo-colonialism, gender and class relations, and humanitarian agencies. A practitioner is known as a humanitarian.

While humanitarianism on a local and national level can be traced far back in history, scholars of international politics tend to identify the advent of global humanitarian impulses to the 19th century. The creation of the International Red Cross in 1863 is considered a key juncture in global humanitarianism. The scope of humanitarianism has expanded over time alongside shifting perceptions of who counts as &quot;human&quot; and whose lives are worth saving.

==A universal doctrine==

Scholars have generally observed that humanitarianism has increased in scope over time, as individuals and groups have expanded their definition of human life to groups beyond their immediate environment. Humanitarian governance has become increasingly complex and institutionalized over time. 

Jean Pictet, in his commentary on The Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross, argues for the universal characteristics of humanitarianism: 
:The wellspring of the principle of humanity is in the essence of social morality which can be summed up in a single sentence, Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. This fundamental precept can be found, in almost identical form, in all the great religions, Brahminism, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Islam, Judaism and Taoism. It is also the golden rule of the positivists, who do not commit themselves to any religion but only to the data of experience, in the name of reason alone. It is indeed not at all necessary to resort to affective or transcendental concepts to recognize the advantage for men to work together to improve their lot.

==Historical examples and periodization==
Humanitarianism was publicly seen in the social reforms of the late 1800s and early 1900s, following the economic turmoil of the Industrial Revolution in England. Many of the women in Great Britain who were involved with feminism during the 1900s also pushed humanitarianism. The atrocious hours and working conditions of children and unskilled laborers were made illegal by pressure on Parliament by humanitarians. The Factory Act 1833 and the Factory Act 1844 were some of the most significant humanitarian bills passed in Parliament following the Industrial Revolution.

In the middle of the 19th century, humanitarianism was central to the work of Florence Nightingale and Henry Dunant in emergency response and in the latter case led to the founding of the Red Cross.

The Humanitarian League (1891–1919) was an English advocacy group, formed by Henry S. Salt, which sought to advance the humanitarian cause.

Various suggestions of distinct periods of humanitarianism exist, drawing either on geopolitical or socioeconomic factors that determine humanitarian action. The first approach is exemplified by Michael Barnett&#x27;s proposition to distinguish ages of &quot;imperial humanitarianism&quot; (late 19th century to 1945), &quot;neo-humanitarianism&quot; (1945–1989), and &quot;liberal humanitarianism&quot; (post-1990). Norbert Götz, Georgina Brewis, and Steffen Werther are advocates of the socioeconomic and cultural approach, arguing that there have been ages of &quot;ad hoc humanitarianism&quot; (up to ), &quot;organized humanitarianism&quot; (–1970), and &quot;expressive humanitarianism&quot; (since 1970). They suggest we might currently be entering &quot;a novel kind of defensive humanitarianism with roots in the expressive age, with automated interfaces, and with thick &#x27;firewalls&#x27; between donors and recipients.&quot; However, a neat separation between donor and recipient is conventionally difficult to draw. The employment of &#x27;local staff&#x27;, the active call for help from people in need and the surge in local humanitarian organizations all suggest the intimate relation between donor and recipient.

==Emergency response==
Today, humanitarianism is particularly used to describe the thinking and doctrines behind the emergency response to humanitarian crises. In such cases it argues for a humanitarian response based on humanitarian principles, particularly the principle of humanity. Nicholas de Torrente, former Executive Director of Médecins Sans Frontières USA writes:
&quot;The most important principles of humanitarian action are humanity, neutrality, independence and impartiality, which posits the conviction that all people have equal dignity by virtue of their being human based solely on need, without discrimination among recipients. Humanitarian organizations must refrain from taking part in hostilities or taking actions that advantage one side of the conflict over another, the action serves the interests of political, religious, or other agendas.These fundamental principles serve two essential purposes. They embody humanitarian action’s single-minded purpose of alleviating suffering, unconditionally and without any ulterior motive. They also serve as background document to develop operational tools that help in obtaining both the consent of communities for the presence and activities of humanitarian organizations, particularly in highly volatile contexts.&quot;
==Digital humanitarianism==
In 2005, a question was raised as to whether Wikipedia can be seen as digital humanitarianism.

Patrick Meier used the term &#x27;digital humanitarianism&#x27; to describe crowdmapping for the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In 2011, Paul Conneally gave a TED talk on digital humanitarianism in which he states that humanitarianism&#x27;s &quot;origins are firmly rooted in the analogue age&quot; with &quot;a major shift coming&quot;. In 2015 he authored the book &quot;Digital Humanitarians: How Big Data Is Changing the Face of Humanitarian Response&quot;.

Vincent Fevrier notes that &quot;social media can benefit the humanitarian sector... by providing information to give better situational awareness to organisations for broad strategic planning and logistics&quot; and that &quot;crisis mapping really emerged in 2010 during the Haiti earthquake&quot; with &quot;software and digital humanitarian platforms such as Standby Task Force, OpenStreetMap, and many others&quot; being active during many disasters since then.

In fact, the role of social media in digital humanitarian efforts is a considerable one. Ten days after the 2010 earthquake, the &quot;Hope for Haiti Now&quot; telethon event was launched in the United States, effectively taking over the mediasphere and reaching hundreds of millions of households and viewers. It focused on appealing to the viewing public&#x27;s empathy for the survivors of the disaster, allowing ordinary citizens to help in a collective relief effort by contributing money donations to NGOs providing Humanitarian aid to earthquake survivors. The telethon attracted support through a variety of celebrity musical performances and staged calls for empathy, using digital social networks to disseminate its appeal to the moral responsibility of the viewer-consumers who are able to reinforce identification with a national identity of the American &#x27;savior&#x27; through participation in this Humanitarian project.

During the summer of 2010, when open fires raged across Russia, causing many to die from smog inhalation, the use of social media allowed digital humanitarians to map the areas in need of support. This is because Russians who were hoping to be evacuated were posting online about the conditions they were in which prompted thousands of Russian bloggers to coordinate relief efforts online. The digital humanitarian efforts in Russia were crucial to responding to the fires in 2010 considering the Russian government was vastly unprepared to deal with such a large-scale disaster.

Within digital humanitarianism, big data has featured strongly in efforts to improve digital humanitarian work and produces a limited understanding of how a crisis is unfolding. It has been argued that Big Data is constitutive of a social relation in which digital humanitarians claim both the formal humanitarian sector and victims of crises need the services and labor that can be provided by digital humanitarians.

<text>Sondre Norheim, born Sondre Auverson, (10 June 1825 – 9 March 1897) was a Norwegian skier and pioneer of modern skiing. Sondre Norheim is known as the father of Telemark skiing.


==Background==
Sondre Auverson was born at Øverbø, a little cotter&#x27;s farm and raised in Morgedal in the municipality of Kviteseid in Telemark, Norway. Skiing was a popular activity in Morgedal. Sondre took to downhill skiing as a recreational activity, rising to local fame for his skills. He made important innovations in skiing technology by designing new equipment, such as different bindings and shorter skis with curved sides to facilitate turns. He also designed the Telemark ski, which is the prototype of all those now produced. Sondre Norheim was regarded by his contemporaries as a master of the art of skiing. He combined ordinary skiing with jumping and slalom. In 1868 he won the first national skiing competition in Christiania, beating his younger competitors by a large margin. His reputation grew, and eventually made Norwegian words like ski and slalåm (slalom) known worldwide.

==Personal life==
On 15 January 1854 Sondre Norheim married Rannei Åmundsdotter from a cotter&#x27;s farm at Øyfjell, a neighbouring village. In March 1854 their first daughter, Ingerid, was born. The next year little Hæge came, but she died at 15 weeks old. The next year Olav was born, and then another daughter they called Hæge, then Anne, Auver, Åmund and Talleiv. Sondre and Rannei lost a second child when Auver died at age 12. The family moved around to different places in Morgedal. Their last place was called &quot;Norheim&quot;, which Sondre took as a new family name.
==Emigration==
On 30 May 1884 Sondre and Rannei left Norway together with three of their children– Anne (21), Åmund (14) and Talleiv (12). Their son Olav and daughter Hæge had left home previously, and their eldest daughter Ingerid decided to stay back home. Norheim followed in the footsteps of many of his neighbors in Morgedal and emigrated from Norway to the United States. After having first settled in Minnesota, they moved to North Dakota, near Villard in McHenry County. He continued to ski when he could, though the climate and flat topography of the Dakota prairie offered few opportunities for downhill skiing. It was said he always had a pair of skis placed outside his door. Norheim grew more religious with age and helped build a Lutheran church in Villard. He died in 1897 and was buried in Denbigh, McHenry County, North Dakota.

==Legacy==
Sondre Norheim was honored during opening ceremonies at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California and at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. 
His grave was originally unmarked, but a memorial stone now marks its spot. During the week of Norsk Høstfest, held in Minot, N.D., groups visit the grave site and hold a commemorative service in memory of Sondre Norheim. 
The movie, &quot;Frikaren på ski – The history of Sondre Norheim, the Father of Modern Ski Sport&quot; was produced by NRK in 1970.

In 1984, Norheim was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame as the first class of inductees. A statue of Sondre Norheim by Norwegian sculptor Knut Skinnarland (1909-1993) was unveiled in 1987 in the Scandinavian Heritage Park, in Minot, North Dakota. During 1988, an identical statue was unveiled in Morgedal, Norway by King Olav V. During 1993, the Sondre Norheim Eternal Flame Monument was added to the Scandinavian Heritage Park. Lars Berge Haugan, a skier representing Morgedal, lit the flame.

<doc id="175092" wikidata="Q50620" url="?curid=175092" title="Telemark skiing">
<text>Telemark skiing is a skiing technique that combines elements of Alpine and Nordic skiing, using the rear foot to keep balance while pushing on the front foot to create a carving turn on downhill skis with toe-only bindings. Telemark skiing is named after the Telemark region of Norway, where the discipline originated. Sondre Norheim is often credited for first demonstrating the turn in ski races, which included cross country, slalom, and jumping, in Norway around 1868. Sondre Norheim also experimented with ski and binding design, introducing side cuts to skis and heel bindings (like a cable).

== History of Telemark skiing ==
=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
In the 1800s, skiers in Telemark challenged each other on &quot;wild slopes&quot; (ville låmir); more gentle slopes were described by the adjective &quot;sla.&quot; Some races were on &quot;bumpy courses&quot; (kneikelåm) and sometimes included &quot;steep jumps&quot; (sprøytehopp) for difficulty. These 19th-century races in Telemark ran along particularly difficult trails usually from a steep mountain, along timber-slides and ended with a sharp turn (&quot;Telemark turn&quot;) on a field or icy lake.

Telemark skiing (colloquially referred to as &quot;tele skiing&quot; or &quot;tele-ing&quot;) was reborn in 1971 in the United States. Doug Buzzell, Craig Hall, Greg Dalbey, Jack Marcial, and Rick Borcovec are credited with reintroducing the style after reading the book &quot;Come Ski With Me&quot; by Stein Eriksen. Telemark skiing gained popularity during the 1970s and 1980s.

=== Telemark skiing today ===
The appeal of Telemark skiing lies in access: long pieces of synthetic fabric, known as skins, can be attached to the bottom of the skis to allow travel uphill in the backcountry. With the invention of light-weight alpine touring (A.T.) skis, however, telemark skiing has decreased in popularity in the backcountry.

Telemark skiing uses a specialized type of equipment. Generally, Telemark skiers use flexible Alpine skis with specially designed bindings that fix only the toe of the ski boot to the ski, thereby creating the &quot;free heel&quot;. Oftentimes the heel is attached to the front of the binding by a hinged cable, which holds the ski boot firmly in the binding. These bindings are often non-releasable.

=== Releasable Telemark bindings ===
Rottefella created releasable telemark bindings and called them NTN. NTN is an acronym for &quot;New Telemark Norm&quot;. The NTN binding is considered by many as a revolution in telemark bindings providing:

1. Superior edge control for the skier. 
2. Improved safety with a sideways release system and optional associated ski brake. 
3. Ease of manual binding release when inverted (e.g. in a tree-well) compared to conventional, heel-release systems, enhancing self-rescue in potentially life-threatening situations.

==Telemark racing==
Originally made popular as a mode of backcountry transportation, Telemark skiing is now a World Cup sport focused on carving. At its core, the Telemark discipline combines elements of Alpine racing, Nordic skate skiing, and ski jumping. World Cup Telemark is offered in a number of race formats, including Classic, Sprint Classic, and Parallel Sprint. A typical Classic Telemark race involves a jump that must be landed in a lunged position, a series of gates, a skate section, and a 360 degree banking turn known as the reipeløkke.

Telemark Racing was governed by the &quot;International Telemark Federation&quot; (ITF) until 1995, when Telemark skiing was officially recognized by the &quot;Federation International de Ski Telemark committee&quot; (FIS). The first FIS Telemark World Championships were held at Hafjell, in Lillehammer, Norway.

Today, Telemark Racing is organized by FIS and by national sport committees such as the United States Telemark Ski Association, and the British Telemark Ski Team.

==Olympic bid==
The FIS Telemark Committee have announced that their proposal for Telemark Parallel Sprint and Team Parallel Sprint is to be included in a FIS proposal to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The proposal was approved by the International Ski Federation (FIS) at the Congress held in Costa Navarino (Greece) May 2018. 
However, in a July ruling, the IOC voted not to include the Telemark Parallel Sprint in the 2022 Beijing Games.

<text>Morgedal is a village in Kviteseid Municipality in Telemark county, Norway. The village is located in the mountains along the European route E134 highway, about to the northwest of the village of Brunkeberg and about to the northwest of the village of Kviteseid.

==Skiing==
The village is notable because it is considered to be the birthplace of the sport of downhill skiing. Morgedal was home to Sondre Norheim who is often called the father of modern skiing. It was also home to Torjus Hemmestveit and Mikkjel Hemmestveit, two brothers who created the world&#x27;s first skiing school in Christiania, Norway in 1881 before emigrating to the United States in the late 19th century.

Olav Bjaaland, another skier from Morgedal, journeyed to the South Pole as a member of Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition. Bjaaland skied at the front of the expedition party so that the sled dogs had something to run after.

The Olympic Flames for the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo and the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, and the flame used in the national torch relay for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer (which was later used as the flame for the 1994 Winter Paralympics), were all lit at the Øvrebø farm in Morgedal, the birthplace of Sondre Norheim.

<doc id="175110" wikidata="Q748663" url="?curid=175110" title="1964 Summer Paralympics">
<text>The , originally known as the 13th International Stoke Mandeville Games, were the second Paralympic Games to be held. They were held in Tokyo, Japan, and were the last Summer Paralympics to take place in the same city as the Summer Olympics until the 1988 Summer Paralympics.

The 1964 Games, although still formally an edition of the International Stoke Mandeville Games, were the first to use the term &quot;Paralympic&quot; in association with the event; the term &quot;Paralympic Games&quot; was approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) first in 1984, while the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) was formed in 1989.

In contrast with the 1960 Games, many events had more than three participants, meaning that athletes were no longer guaranteed a medal upon completing their event.

Tokyo hosted the Summer Paralympic Games again in 2020.

== Sports ==
Nine sports were competed at the 1964 games. In athletics, a wheelchair racing event in the form of a 60 m dash was added; previously the athletics program had included only field events. Wheelchair racing has since become one of the most prominent Paralympic events.

* Archery
* Athletics
* Dartchery
* Snooker
* Swimming
* Table tennis
* Weightlifting
* Wheelchair basketball
* Wheelchair fencing

== Medal table ==

Athletes from 17 of the 19 National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) won at least one medal. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IPC country code.

With a few exceptions, each event contributed one medal of each type to the table (although for team events, multiple physical medals were actually awarded). Two bronze medals were awarded in the dartchery, snooker and table tennis events. Some swimming events did not award silver or bronze medals.

: Inaccurate reports

At the start of the Paralympic Games there was no precision in reporting the results of the competitions. The Israeli athlete Michal Escapa was reported to be of Italian nationality and without a first name, as she is mentioned in the International Paralympic Committee of the Italian Paralympic Committee web sites) for the reports of the Swimming at the 1964 Summer Paralympics where she won two bronze medals, simply reported as Escapa and not as Michal Escapa. However, as can be seen from a 1968 Israeli newspaper reporting an interview with the athlete, she was the same athlete who had won medals in swimming and table tennis in Tokyo 1964.

*&quot;To sort this table by nation, total medal count, or any other column, click on the icon next to the column title.&quot;

Athletes with outstanding performances included Margaret Harriman of Rhodesia who won two gold medals in archery, and Serge Bec of France who won two individuals gold medals, one team gold medal and one team silver medal. Dick Thompson of the United Kingdom won two individual golds, one silver and one bronze in athletics. The United States&#x27; Ron Stein won six golds and South Africa&#x27;s Daniel Erasmus won two golds and two silvers in athletics.

== Participating delegations ==
Nineteen delegations participated in the Tokyo Paralympics.

The 1964 Games marked Austria, Fiji, Japan and South Africa&#x27;s Paralympic Games début. South Africa had just been banned from taking part in the 1964 Summer Olympic Games, due to its policy of apartheid. It was not, however, banned from the Paralympics until 1980 Summer Paralympics,as Japan (in a host country position) did not oppose its participation. A letter from archery medalist Irene Preslipski published in the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader on December 1, 1964, also mentions delegations from Ceylon, Mexico and the Philippines marching in the opening ceremony. However, these countries only sent in officials.

==Ceremonies==

The Opening ceremony was organized in the Yoyogi Park, and the Closing Ceremony at Yoyogi National Gymnasium. About 5000 spectators were present at both of the ceremonies. Then Crown Prince Akihito and Crown Princess Michiko were present in both of them.

==Media coverage==
Earlier it was thought that the Games might not get much media coverage, due to the focus on the Olympic Games, but both radio and television media gave high coverage to the Games.

== Organizing Committee ==
Yoshisuke Kasai was the chairman of the board of directors. The board had 3 vice-chairmen, namely T. Azuma, H. Dazai and I. Miki. The auditor of the organizing committee was M. Tozawa, and the secretary general was K. Ujiie.

<doc id="175114" wikidata="Q1415139" url="?curid=175114" title="Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race">
<text>The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, more commonly known as The Iditarod (), is an annual long-distance sled dog race held in Alaska in early March. It travels from Anchorage to Nome. Mushers and a team of between 12 and 16 dogs, of which at least 5 must be on the towline at the finish line, cover the distance in 8–15 days or more. The Iditarod began in 1973 as an event to test the best sled dog mushers and teams but evolved into today&#x27;s highly competitive race.

Teams often race through blizzards causing whiteout conditions, sub-zero temperatures and gale-force winds which can cause the wind chill to reach . A ceremonial start occurs in the city of Anchorage and is followed by the official restart in Willow, a city north of Anchorage. The restart was originally in Wasilla until 2002, but due to too little snow, the restart has been at Willow since 2003. The trail runs from Willow up the Rainy Pass of the Alaska Range into the sparsely populated interior, and then along the shore of the Bering Sea, finally reaching Nome in western Alaska. The trail is through a rugged landscape of tundra and spruce forests, over hills and mountain passes, across rivers and even over sea ice. While the start in Anchorage is in the middle of a large urban center, most of the route passes through widely separated towns and villages, and small Athabaskan and Iñupiat settlements. The Iditarod is regarded as a symbolic link to the early history of the state and is connected to many traditions commemorating the legacy of dog mushing.

The race is an important and popular sporting event in Alaska, and the top mushers and their teams of dogs are local celebrities; this popularity is credited with the resurgence of recreational mushing in the state since the 1970s. While the yearly field of more than fifty mushers and about a thousand dogs is still largely Alaskan, competitors from fourteen countries have completed the event including Martin Buser from Switzerland, who became the first foreign winner in 1992. Fans follow the race online from all over the world, and many overseas volunteers also come to Alaska to help man checkpoints and carry out other volunteer chores.

The Iditarod received more attention outside of the state after the 1985 victory of Libby Riddles, a long-shot who became the first woman to win the race. The next year, Susan Butcher became the second woman to win the race and went on to win in three subsequent years. Print and television journalists and crowds of spectators attend the ceremonial start at the intersection of Fourth Avenue and D Street in Anchorage and in smaller numbers at the checkpoints along the trail.

Mitch Seavey set the record fastest time for the Iditarod in 2017, crossing the line in Nome in 8 days, 3 hours, 40 minutes and 13 seconds, while also becoming the oldest winner. This record was subsequently broken by his son Dallas Seavey in 2021, with a time of 7 days, 14 hours, 8 minutes and 57 seconds.

==Name==
The race&#x27;s namesake is the Iditarod Trail, which was designated as one of the first four US National Historic Trails in 1978. The trail, in turn, is named for the town of Iditarod, which was an Athabaskan village before becoming the center of the Inland Empire&#x27;s Iditarod Mining District in 1910, and then becoming a ghost town at the end of the local gold rush. The town was named after the Iditarod River. The river&#x27;s name ultimately comes from the Athabascan word Haidilatna.

==History==

Portions of the Iditarod Trail were used by the Native Alaskan Inupiaq and Athabaskan peoples hundreds of years before the arrival of Russian fur traders in the 1800s, but the trail reached its peak between the late 1880s and the mid-1920s as miners arrived to dig coal and later gold, especially after the Alaska gold rushes at Nome in 1898, and at the &quot;Inland Empire&quot; along the Kuskokwim Mountains between the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers, in 1908. The primary communication and transportation link to the rest of the world during the summer was the steamship, but between October and June the northern ports like Nome became icebound, and dog sleds delivered mail, firewood, mining equipment, gold ore, food, furs, and other needed supplies between the trading posts and settlements across the Interior and along the western coast. Roadhouses where travellers could spend the night sprang up every until the end of the 1920s, when the mail carriers were replaced by bush pilots flying small aircraft, and the roadhouses vanished. Dog sledding persisted in the rural parts of Alaska, but was almost driven into extinction by the increased use of snowmobiles in the 1960s.

During its heyday, mushing was also a popular sport during the winter, when mining towns shut down. The first major competition was the tremendously popular 1908 All-Alaska Sweepstakes (AAS), which was started by Allan &quot;Scotty&quot; Alexander Allan, and ran from Nome to Candle and back. In 1910, this event introduced the first Siberian Huskies to Alaska, where they quickly became the favored racing dog, replacing the Alaskan Malamute and mongrels bred from imported huskies.

The original Iditarod start had nothing to do with the serum run or the famous dog, Balto.

Joe Redington Sr. had the original idea to race a portion of the Iditarod trail. Joe Redington Sr. (named the &quot;Father of the Iditarod&quot; by one of the local newspapers) asked his friends, Gleo Huyck and Tom Johnson (school teachers and dog mushers) to join him in creating this new endeavor. The three co-founders of the race started in October 1972 to plan the now famous race. The original plan was to race from Knik to Iditarod and back. Their friend, Bill Weimar, had the idea to start the race in Anchorage because it had a larger population at both ends of the race. They cleared a portion of the trail. A major fundraising campaign which raised a purse of $51,000 was also started at the same time. This race was the first true Iditarod Race and was held in 1973, attracting a field of 34 mushers, 22 of whom completed the race. 

The event was a success; even though the purse dropped in the 1974 race, the popularity caused the field of mushers to rise to 44, and corporate sponsorship in 1975 put the race on secure financial footing. Despite the loss of sponsors during a dog-abuse scandal in 1976, the Iditarod caused a resurgence of recreational mushing in the 1970s, and has continued to grow until it is now the largest sporting event in the state. The race was originally patterned after the All Alaska Sweepstakes races held early in the 20th century.

The main route of the Iditarod trail extends from Seward in the south to Nome in the northwest, and was first surveyed by Walter Goodwin in 1908, and then cleared and marked by the Alaska Road Commission in 1911 and 1912. The entire network of branching paths covers a total of . Except for the start in Anchorage, the modern race follows parts of the historic Iditarod trail.

== Route ==

The trail is composed of two routes: a northern route, which is run on even-numbered years, and a southern route, which is run on odd-numbered years. Both follow the same trail , from Anchorage to Ophir, where they diverge and then rejoin at Kaltag, from Nome. The race used the northern route until 1977, when the southern route was added to distribute the impact of the event on the small villages in the area, none of which have more than a few hundred inhabitants. Passing through the historic town of Iditarod was a secondary benefit.

Aside from the addition of the southern route, the route has remained relatively constant. The largest changes were the addition of the restart location in 1995 and the shift from Ptarmigan to Rainy Pass in 1996. Checkpoints along the route are also occasionally added or dropped, and the ceremonial start of the route and the restart point are commonly adjusted depending on weather.

As a result, the exact measured distance of the race varies from year to year, but officially the northern route is long, and the southern route is long. The description of the length of the race is frequently rounded to .

In 2015 and 2017, due to lack of snow, the race had to be re-routed. The race started in Fairbanks, Alaska, and continued to Nenana (), Manley Hot Springs (), Tanana (), Ruby (), Galena (), Huslia (), Koyukuk () before joining up with the normal trail at Nulato for the rest of the race. The Fairbanks restart changed the official distance to , longer than the northern route, 19 less than the southern route.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 Iditarod followed a modified 832-mile out-and-back route, the Gold Trail Loop. This route began and ended at Deshka Landing in Willow, with the turnaround point at the Iditarod checkpoint.

=== Checkpoints ===
There are currently 26 checkpoints on the northern route and 27 on the southern route where mushers must sign in. Some mushers prefer to camp on the trail and immediately press on, but others stay and rest. Mushers prepare &quot;drop bags&quot; of supplies which are flown ahead to each checkpoint by the Iditarod Air Force. The gear includes food for the musher and the dogs, extra booties for the dogs, headlamps for night travel, batteries (for the lamps, music, or radios), tools and sled parts for repairs, and even lightweight sleds for the final dash to Nome. There are three mandatory rests that each team must take during the Iditarod: one 24-hour layover, to be taken at any checkpoint; one eight-hour layover, taken at any checkpoint on the Yukon River; and an eight-hour stop at White Mountain.

In 1985, the race was suspended for the first time for safety reasons when weather prevented the Iditarod Air Force from delivering supplies to Rohn and Nikolai, the first two checkpoints in the Alaska Interior. Fifty-eight mushers and 508 dogs congregated at the small lodge in Rainy Pass for three days, while emergency shipments of food were flown in from Anchorage. Weather also halted the race later at McGrath, and the two stops added almost a week to the winning time.
=== Ceremonial start ===
The race starts on the first Saturday in March, at the first checkpoint on Fourth Avenue in downtown Anchorage. A five-block section of the street is barricaded off as a staging area, and snow is stockpiled and shipped in by truck the night before to cover the route to the first checkpoint. Prior to 1983, the race started at Mulcahy Park.

Shortly before the race, a ribbon-cutting ceremony is held under the flags representing the home countries and states of all competitors in the race. The first musher to depart at 10:00 a.m. AST is an honorary musher, selected for their contributions to dog sledding. The first competitor leaves at 10:02 and the rest follow, separated by two-minute intervals. The start order is determined during a banquet held two days prior by the mushers drawing their numbers for starting position. Selections are made in the order of musher registrations.

This is an exciting portion of the race for dogs and musher, as it is one of the few portions of the race where there are spectators, and the only spot where the trail winds through an urban environment. However, in &quot;Iditarod Dreams&quot;, DeeDee Jonrowe wrote, &quot;A lot of mushers hate the Anchorage start. They don&#x27;t like crowds. They worry that their dogs get too excited and jumpy.&quot; The time for covering this portion of the race does not count toward the official race time, so the dogs, musher, and Idita-Rider are free to take this all in at a relaxed pace. The mushers then continue through several miles of city streets and city trails before reaching the foothills to the east of Anchorage, in Chugach State Park in the Chugach Mountains. The teams then follow Glenn Highway for two to three hours until they reach Eagle River, away. Once they arrive at the Veterans of Foreign Wars building, the mushers check in, unharness their teams, return them to their boxes, and drive of highway to the restart point.

During the first two races in 1973 and 1974, the teams crossed the mudflats of Cook Inlet to Knik (the original restart location), but this was discontinued because the weather frequently hovers around freezing, turning it into a muddy hazard. The second checkpoint also occasionally changes because of weather; in 2005, the checkpoint was changed from Eagle River to Campbell Airstrip, away. In the 2016 race, due to lack of snow, the ceremonial start was 3 miles in Anchorage.

=== Restart ===
After the dogs are shuttled to the third checkpoint, the race restarts the next day (Sunday) at 2:00 p.m. AST. Prior to 2004, the race was restarted at 10:00 a.m., but the time has been moved back to 2:00 P.M. so the dogs will be starting in colder weather, and the first mushers arrive at Skwentna well after dark, which reduces the crowds of fans who fly into the checkpoint.
The traditional restart location was the headquarters of the Iditarod Trail Committee, in Wasilla, but in 2008 the official restart was pushed further north to Willow Lake. In 2003, dwindling snow and poor trail conditions due to a warming climate forced organizers to move the start north to Fairbanks. The mushers depart separated by the same intervals as their arrival at the second checkpoint. In 2015, the official restart had to again be moved north to Fairbanks due to unusually warm temperatures and lack of snow coverage on critical parts of the trail.

The first from Willow through the checkpoints at Yentna Station Station to Skwentna is known as &quot;moose alley&quot;. The many moose in the area find it difficult to move and forage for food when the ground is thick with snow. As a result, the moose sometimes prefer to use pre-existing trails, causing hazards for the dog teams. In 1985, Susan Butcher lost her chance at becoming the first woman to win the Iditarod when her team made a sharp turn and encountered a pregnant moose. The moose killed two dogs and seriously injured six more in the twenty minutes before Duane &quot;Dewey&quot; Halverson arrived and shot the moose. In 1982, Dick Mackey, Warner Vent, Jerry Austin, and their teams were driven into the forest by a charging moose.

Otherwise, the route to Skwentna is easy, over flat lowlands, and well marked by stakes or tripods with reflectors or flags. Most mushers push through the night, and the first teams usually arrive at Skwentna before dawn. Skwentna is a 40-minute hop from Anchorage by air, and dozens of planes land on the airstrip or on the Skwentna River, bringing journalists, photographers, and spectators.

From Skwentna, the route follows the Skwentna River into the southern part of the Alaska Range to Finger Lake. The stretch from Finger Lake to Rainy Pass on Puntilla Lake becomes more difficult, as teams follow the narrow Happy River Gorge, where the trail balances on the side of a heavily forested incline. Rainy Pass is the most dangerous check point in the Iditarod. In 1985, Jerry Austin broke a hand and two of his dogs were injured when the sled went out of control and hit a stand of trees. Many others have suffered from this dangerous checkpoint. Rainy Pass is part of the Historic Iditarod Trail, but until 1976 the pass was inaccessible and route detoured through Ptarmigan Pass, also known as Hellsgate, because of the 1964 Good Friday earthquake.

=== Into the Interior ===

From Rainy Pass, the route continues up the mountain, past the tree line to the divide of the Alaska Range, and then passes down into the Alaska Interior. The elevation of the pass is , and some nearby peaks exceed . The valley up the mountains is exposed to blizzards. In 1974, there were several cases of frostbite when the temperature dropped to , and the winds caused the wind chill to drop to . The wind also erases the trail and markers, making the path hard to follow. In 1976, retired colonel Norman Vaughan, who drove a dog team in Richard E. Byrd&#x27;s 1928 expedition to the South Pole and competed in the only Olympic sled dog race, became lost for five days after leaving Rainy Pass and nearly died.

The trail down Dalzell Gorge from the divide is regarded as the worst stretch of the trail. Steep and straight, it drops in elevation in just , and there is little traction so the teams are hard to control. Mushers have to ride the brake most of the way down and use a snow hook for traction. In 1988, rookie Peryll Kyzer fell through an ice bridge into a creek and spent the night wet. The route then follows Tatina River, which is also hazardous: in 1986 Butcher&#x27;s lead dogs fell through the ice but landed on a second layer of ice instead of falling into the river. In 1997, Ramey Smyth lost the end of his little finger when it hit an overhanging branch while negotiating the gorge.

Rohn is the next checkpoint and is located in a spruce forest with no wind and a poor airstrip. The isolation, its location immediately after the rigors of Rainy Pass and before the haul to the next checkpoint, makes it a popular place for mushers to take a 4-8 hour break. From Rohn, the trail follows the south fork of the Kuskokwim River, where freezing water running over a layer of ice (overflow) is a hazard. In 1975, Vaughan was hospitalized for frostbite after running through an overflow. In 1973, Terry Miller and his team were almost drawn into a hole in the river by the powerful current in an overflow but were rescued by Tom Mercer who came back to save them.

About from Rohn, the path leaves the river and passes into the Farewell Burn. In 1976, a wildfire burned of spruce. The hazards resulting from wildfire force teams to move very slowly and can cause paw injuries. Clumps of sedge or grass which balloon out into a canopy above the ground can support a deceptively thin crust of snow. Fallen timber is also a concern.

Nikolai, an Athabaskan settlement on the banks of the Kuskokwim River, is the first Native American village used as a checkpoint, and the arrival of the sled teams is one of the largest social events of the year. The route then follows the south fork of the Kuskokwim to the former mining town of McGrath. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 401, making it the largest checkpoint in the Interior. McGrath is also notable for being the first site in Alaska to receive mail by aircraft (in 1924), heralding the end of the sled dog era. It still has a good airfield, so journalists are common.

Following McGrath is Takotna, formerly a commercial hub during the gold rush. The ghost town of Ophir, named for the reputed source of King Solomon&#x27;s gold by religious prospectors, is the next checkpoint. By this stage in the race, the front-runners may be several days ahead of those in the back of the pack.
=== Northern or southern route ===
After Ophir, the trail diverges into a northern and a southern route, which rejoin at Kaltag. In &quot;even&quot;-numbered years (&quot;e.g.&quot; 2022, 2024) the &quot;northern&quot; route is used; in &quot;odd&quot;-numbered years (&quot;e.g.&quot; 2023) the &quot;southern&quot; route is used. During the first few Iditarods only the northern trail was used. In the late 1970s, the southern leg of the route was added. It gave the southern villages a chance to host the Iditarod race and also allowed the route to pass through the trail&#x27;s namesake, the historical town of Iditarod. The two routes differ by less than .

The northern route first passes through Cripple, which is from Anchorage, and from Nome (ITC, &quot;Northern&quot;), making it the middlemost checkpoint. From Cripple, the route passes through Sulatna Crossing to Ruby, on the Yukon River. Ruby is another former gold-rush town which became an Athabaskan village.

The southern route first passes through the ghost town of Iditarod, which is the alternate halfway mark, at from Anchorage, and from Nome (ITC, &quot;Southern&quot;). From Iditarod the route goes through the three neighboring Athabaskan villages of Shageluk, Anvik, Grayling, and then on to Eagle Island, Alaska.

Ruby and Anvik are on the longest river in Alaska, the Yukon, which is swept by strong winds which can wipe out the trail and drop the windchill below . A greater hazard is the uniformity of this long stretch: suffering from sleep deprivation, many mushers report hallucinations.

Both trails meet again in Kaltag, which for hundreds of years has been a gateway between the Athabaskan villages in the Interior and the Iñupiat settlements on the coast of the Bering Sea. The &quot;Kaltag Portage&quot; runs through a pass down to the Iñupiat town of Unalakleet, on the shore of the Bering Sea.

=== Last dash ===

In the early years of the Iditarod, the last stretch along the shores of the Norton Sound of the Bering Sea to Nome was a slow, easy trip. Now that the race is more competitive, the last stretch has become one last dash to the finish.

According to the 2010 census, the village of Unalakleet has a population of 712, making it the largest Alaska Native town along the Iditarod Trail. The majority of the residents are Iñupiat. The town&#x27;s name means the &quot;place where the east wind blows&quot;. Racers are met by church bells, sirens, and crowds.

From Unalakleet, the route passes through the hills to the Iñupiat village of Shaktoolik. The route then passes across the frozen Norton Bay to Koyuk; the markers on the bay are young spruce trees frozen into holes in the ice. The route then swings west along the south shore of Seward Peninsula though the tiny villages of Elim, Golovin and White Mountain.

All teams must rest their dogs for at least eight hours at White Mountain, before the final sprint. From White Mountain to Safety is , and from Safety to Nome it is . The last leg is crucial because the lead teams are often within a few hours of each other at this point. The closest race in Iditarod history was in 1978 when the winner and the runner-up were only one second apart. In 1991, the race had been decided by less than an hour seven times, and less than five minutes three times. Numerous races since then have been decided by less than an hour: for example, 2012, 2013, 2014 (in which the finishing times were less than three minutes apart), 2016, and 2019.

The official finish line is the Red &quot;Fox&quot; Olson Trail Monument, more commonly known as the &quot;burled arch&quot;, in Nome. The original burled arch lasted from 1975 until 2001, when it was destroyed by dry rot and years of inclement weather. The new arch is a spruce log with two distinct burls similar but not identical to the old arch. While the old arch spelled out &quot;End of Iditarod Dog Race&quot;, the new arch has an additional word: &quot;End of Iditarod Sled Dog Race&quot;.

A &quot;Widow&#x27;s Lamp&quot; is lit and remains hanging on the arch until the last competitor crosses the finish line. The tradition is based on the kerosene lamp lit and hung outside a roadhouse, when a musher carrying goods or mail was en route. The last musher to complete the Iditarod is referred to as the &quot;Red Lantern&quot;.

On the way to the arch, each musher passes down Front Street and down the fenced-off end stretch. The city&#x27;s fire siren is sounded as each musher hits the 2-mile mark before the finish line. While the winner of the first race in 1973 completed the competition in just over 20 days, preparation of the trail in advance of the dog sled teams and improvements in dog training have dropped the winning time to under 10 days in every race since 1996.

An awards banquet is held the Sunday after the winner&#x27;s arrival. Brass belt buckles and special patches are given to everyone who completes the race.

== Participants ==
More than 50 mushers enter each year. Most are from rural South Central Alaska, the Interior, and the &quot;Bush&quot;; few are urban, and only a small percentage are from the Contiguous United States, Canada, or overseas. Some are professionals who make their living by selling dogs, running sled dog tours, giving mushing instruction, and speaking about their Iditarod experiences. Others make money from Iditarod-related advertising contracts or book deals. Some are amateurs who make their living hunting, fishing, trapping, gardening, or with seasonal jobs, though lawyers, surgeons, airline pilots, veterinarians, biologists, and CEOs have competed. American young adult author Gary Paulsen competed in the race a number of times, and wrote about his experiences in non-fiction memoirs. Per rules #1 and #2, only experienced mushers are allowed to compete in the Iditarod.

Mushers are required to participate in three smaller races to qualify for the Iditarod. However, they are allowed to lease dogs to participate in the Iditarod and are not required to take written exams to determine their knowledge of mushing, the dogs they race, or canine first aid. Mushers who have been convicted of a charge of animal neglect, or determined unfit by the Iditarod Trail Committee, are not allowed to compete. The Iditarod Trail Committee once disqualified musher Jerry Riley for alleged dog abuse and Rick Swenson after one of his dogs expired after running through overflow. The Iditarod later reinstated both men and allowed them to race. Rick Swenson is now on the Iditarod&#x27;s board of directors. Rookie mushers must pre-qualify by finishing an assortment of qualifying races first.

, the combined cost of the entry fee, dog maintenance, and transportation was estimated by one musher to be US$20,000 to $30,000. But that figure varies depending upon how many dogs a musher has, what the musher feeds the dogs and how much is spent on housing and handlers. Expenses faced by modern teams include lightweight gear including thousands of booties and quick-change runners, special high-energy dog foods, veterinary care, and breeding costs. According to Athabaskan musher Ken Chase, &quot;the big expenses [for rural Alaskans] are the freight and having to buy dog food&quot;. Most modern teams cost $10,000 to $40,000, and the top 10 spend between $80,000 and $100,000 per year. The top finisher won at least $69,000, but that amount has slowly decreased since then, with the 2010 winner receiving only $50,000. Some believe overall interest in the race may be declining, hence the lighter purses and sponsorships. The remaining top thirty finishers won an average of $26,500 each. Mushers make money from their sponsorships, speaking fees, advertising contracts and book deals.

=== Dogs ===

The original sled dogs were bred by the Native American Mahlemuit (also known as Kuuvangmiut or Kobuk) people and are one of the earliest domesticated breeds known. They were soon crossbred with Alaskan huskies, hounds, setters, spaniels, German Shepherds, and wolves. As demand for dogs skyrocketed, a black market formed at the end of the 19th century which funneled large dogs of any breed to the gold rush. Siberian Huskies were introduced in the early 20th century and became the most popular racing breed. The original dogs were chosen for strength and stamina, but modern racing dogs are all mixed-breed huskies bred for speed, tough feet, endurance, good attitude, and most importantly the desire to run. Dogs bred for long races weigh from , and those bred for sprinting weigh less, , but the best competitors of both types are interchangeable.

Starting in 1984, all dogs are examined by veterinarians/nurses before the start of the race, who check teeth, eyes, tonsils, heart, lungs, joints, and genitals; they look for signs of illegal drugs, improperly healed wounds, and pregnancy. All dogs are identified and tracked by microchip implants and collar tags. On the trails, volunteer veterinarians examine each dog&#x27;s heart, hydration, appetite, attitude, weight, lungs, and joints at all of the checkpoints, and look for signs of foot and shoulder injuries, respiration problems, dehydration, diarrhea, and exhaustion. When mushers race through checkpoints, the dogs do not get physical exams. Mushers are not allowed to administer drugs that mask the signs of injury, including stimulants, muscle relaxants, sedatives, anti-inflammatories, and anabolic steroids. , the Iditarod claims that no musher has been banned for giving drugs to dogs.
However the Iditarod never reveals the results of tests on the dogs.

Each team is composed of twelve to fourteen dogs, and no more may be added during the race. At least five dogs must be on the towline when crossing the finish line in Nome. Mushers keep a veterinary diary on the trail and are required to have it signed by a veterinarian at each checkpoint. Dogs that become exhausted or injured may be carried in the sled&#x27;s &quot;basket&quot; to the next &quot;dog-drop&quot; site, where they are transported by the volunteer Iditarod Air Force to the Hiland Mountain Correctional Center at Eagle River where they are taken care of by prison inmates until picked up by handlers or family members, or they are flown to Nome for transport home. According to Iditarod veterinarian Dr. Stuart Nelson, Jr., &quot;Reasons for dropping dogs are numerous. Attitude problems, fatigue, illness, immaturity, injury, being “in heat,” lack of speed and musher strategy, are the more common ones.&quot;

The dogs are well-conditioned athletes. Training starts in late summer or early fall and intensifies between November and March; competitive teams run before the race. When there is no snow, dog drivers train using wheeled carts or all-terrain vehicles set in neutral. An Alaskan husky in the Iditarod will burn about 9,666 calories each day; on a body-weight basis this rate of caloric burn is approximately twice that of a human Tour de France cyclist. Similarly the VO2 max (aerobic capacity) of a typical Iditarod dog is about 240 milligrams of oxygen per kilogram of body weight, which is about three times that of a human Olympic marathon runner.

==Criticism==
Since its inception in 1973, the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race has faced criticism regarding the welfare of participating dogs. Estimates suggest that over 150 dogs have died during the race as of 2024. In the 2024 race, three dogs—Henry, George, and Bog—died during the event, marking the first fatalities since 2019. The leading cause of death for dogs on the trail is aspiration pneumonia, caused by inhaling their own vomit. It&#x27;s important to note that these figures may not encompass all incidents, as not all deaths are officially reported.

Animal protection activists say that the Iditarod is not a commemoration of the 1925 serum delivery, and that race was originally called the Iditarod Trail Seppala Memorial Race in honor of Leonhard Seppala. Animal protection activists also say that the Iditarod is dog abuse. For example, dogs have died and been injured during the race. The practice of tethering dogs on chains, which is commonly used by mushers in their kennels, at checkpoints and dog drops, is also criticized. PETA spokesperson Jennifer O&#x27;Connor says, &quot;We&#x27;re totally opposed to the race for the cruelty issues associated with it&quot;. The ASPCA said, &quot;General concerns arise whenever intense competition results in dogs being pushed beyond their endurance or capabilities&quot;, according to Vice President Stephen Zawistowski.

Iditarod Trail Committee monitors the dogs&#x27; health. On May 18, 2007, the Iditarod Trail Committee Board of Directors announced that they had suspended Ramy Brooks for abusing his sled dogs. The suspension was for the 2008 and 2009 races, to be followed by three years probation. Brooks has now retired from dog racing.

In 2017 Wells Fargo announced that it would no longer sponsor the race. While it declined to give specific reasons for the withdrawal of funds, Iditarod CEO Stan Hooley told the Associated Press that he believed the decision was connected to the activists&#x27; implications of cruelty to dogs.

In 2020 several major companies withdrew their sponsorship for the race after pressure from PETA. Exxon announced it would pull its financial support after the 2021 event. Millenium Hotels and Resorts dropped their national sponsorship following the 2022 race.

== Records and awards ==

Dick Wilmarth won the first race in the year 1973, in 20 days, 0 hours, 49 minutes, and 41 seconds. Mitch Seavey set a fastest winning time in 2017 with a time of 8 days, 3 hours, 40 minutes, and 13 seconds in 2017, which was broken by his son Dallas Seavey with a time of 7 days, 14 hours, 8 minutes and 57 seconds in 2021. The closest finish between two mushers was in 1978 between Dick Mackey and Rick Swenson. Mackey&#x27;s win was controversial because while the nose of his lead dog crossed the finish line one second ahead of Swenson&#x27;s lead dog, Swenson&#x27;s body crossed the finish line first.

The first musher to win four races was Rick Swenson, in 1982. In 1991 he became the first person to win five times and the only musher to win the race in three different decades. Susan Butcher, Doug Swingley, Martin Buser, Jeff King, Lance Mackey, and Dallas Seavey are the only other four-time winners. In 2021 Dallas Seavey became the second person to win five times, and took the record outright with his sixth win in the 2024 version.

Mary Shields was the first woman to complete the race, in 1974 (finishing 23rd). In 1985 Libby Riddles was the only musher to brave a blizzard, becoming the first woman to win the race. She was featured in &quot;Vogue&quot;, and named the Professional Sportswoman of the Year by the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation. Susan Butcher withdrew from the same race after two of her dogs were killed by a moose, but she became the second woman to win the race the next year and subsequently won three of the next four races. Butcher was the second musher to win four races and the only musher to finish in either first or second place for five straight years.

Doug Swingley of Montana was the first non-Alaskan to win the race, in 1995. Mushers from 14 countries have competed in the Iditarod races, and in 1992 Martin Buser—a Swiss resident of Alaska since 1979—was the first foreigner to win the race. Buser became a naturalized U.S. citizen in a ceremony under the Burled Arch in Nome following the 2002 race. In 2003, Norwegian Robert Sørlie became the first non-resident of the United States to win the race.

In 2007 Lance Mackey became the first musher to win both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod in the same year; a feat he repeated in 2008. Mackey also joined his father and brother, Dick and Rick Mackey as an Iditarod champion. All three Mackeys raced with the bib number 13, and all won their respective titles on their sixth try.

The &quot;Golden Harness&quot; is most frequently given to the lead dog or dogs of the winning team in addition to a celebratory cupcake in the shape of an Alaskan Malamute named William. However, it is decided by a vote of the mushers, and in 2008 was given to Babe, the lead dog of Ramey Smyth, the 3rd-place finisher. Babe was almost 11 years old when she finished the race, and it was her ninth Iditarod. The &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; award is given to the musher who places the best among those finishing their first Iditarod. A red lantern signifying perseverance is awarded to the last musher to cross the finish line. The size of the purse determines how many mushers receive cash prizes. For the 2013 edition of the race, the total purse was US$600,000, to be divided by the top 30 finishers, with every finisher below 30th place receiving $1,049. The champion receives a new pickup truck and $69,000 as of 2015.

<text>William Frederick Friedman (September 24, 1891 – November 12, 1969) was a US Army cryptographer who ran the research division of the Army&#x27;s Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) in the 1930s, and parts of its follow-on services into the 1950s. In 1940, subordinates of his led by Frank Rowlett broke Japan&#x27;s PURPLE cipher, thus disclosing Japanese diplomatic secrets before America&#x27;s entrance into World War II.

== Early life ==
Friedman was born Wolf Friedman (, ), in Kishinev, Bessarabia, the son of Frederick Friedman, a Jew from Bucharest who worked as a translator and linguist for the Russian Postal Service, and the daughter of a well-to-do wine merchant. Friedman&#x27;s family left Kishinev in 1892 on account of anti-Semitic persecution, ending up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Three years later, his first name was changed to William.

As a child, Friedman was introduced to cryptography in the short story &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe. He studied at the Michigan Agricultural College (known today as Michigan State University) in East Lansing and received a scholarship to work on genetics at Cornell University. Meanwhile, George Fabyan, who ran a private research laboratory to study any personally interesting project, decided to set up his own genetics project and was referred to Friedman. Friedman joined Fabyan&#x27;s Riverbank Laboratories outside Chicago in September 1915. As head of the Department of Genetics, one of the projects he ran studied the effects of moonlight on crop growth, and so he experimented with the planting of wheat during various phases of the moon.

== Initial work in cryptology ==
Another of Fabyan&#x27;s pet projects was research into secret messages which Sir Francis Bacon had allegedly hidden in various texts during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. The research was carried out by Elizabeth Wells Gallup. She believed that she had discovered many such messages in the works of William Shakespeare, and convinced herself that Bacon had written many, if not all, of Shakespeare&#x27;s works. Friedman had become something of an expert photographer while working on his other projects, and was asked to travel to England on several occasions to help Gallup photograph historical manuscripts during her research. He became fascinated with the work as he courted Elizebeth Smith, Gallup&#x27;s assistant and an accomplished cryptographer. They married, and he soon became director of Riverbank&#x27;s Department of Codes and Ciphers as well as its Department of Genetics. During this time, Friedman wrote a series of eight papers on cryptography, collectively known as the &quot;Riverbank Publications&quot;, including the first description of the index of coincidence, an important mathematical tool in cryptanalysis.
With the entry of the United States into World War I, Fabyan offered the services of his Department of Codes and Ciphers to the government. No Federal department existed for this kind of work (although both the Army and Navy had had embryonic departments at various times), and soon Riverbank became the unofficial cryptographic center for the US Government. During this period, the Friedmans broke a code used by German-funded Indian radicals in the US who planned to ship arms to India to gain independence from Britain. Analyzing the format of the messages, Riverbank realized that the code was based on a dictionary of some sort, a cryptographic technique common at the time. The Friedmans soon managed to decrypt most of the messages, but only long after the case had come to trial did the book itself come to light: a German-English dictionary published in 1880.
== Signals Intelligence Service ==
The United States government decided to set up its own cryptological service, and sent Army officers to Riverbank to train under Friedman. To support the program, Friedman wrote a series of technical monographs, completing seven by early 1918. He then enlisted in the Army and went to France to serve as the personal cryptographer for General John J. Pershing. He returned to the US in 1920 and published an eighth monograph, &quot;The Index of Coincidence and its Applications in Cryptography&quot;, considered by some to be the most important publication in modern cryptography to that time. His texts for Army cryptographic training were well thought of and remained classified for several decades.

In 1921 he became chief cryptanalyst for the War Department and later led the Signals Intelligence Service (SIS)—a position he kept for a quarter century. In 1929, after the American Black Chamber in New York City was disbanded, its files were entrusted to SIS, and the cryptographic and intelligence services was reorganized to suit its new position at the War Department.

Friedman coined several terms, including &quot;cryptanalysis&quot;, and wrote many monographs on cryptography. One of these (written mostly in his spare time) was the first draft of his &quot;Elements of cryptanalysis&quot;, which later was expanded to four volumes and became the U.S. Army&#x27;s cryptographic main textbook and reference. Realizing that mathematical and language skills were essential to SIS&#x27;s work, Friedman managed to get authority to hire three men with both mathematical training and language knowledge. They were Solomon Kullback, Frank Rowlett and Abraham Sinkov, each of whom went on to distinguished service for decades. In addition he also was finally able to hire a man fluent in Japanese, John Hurt.

During this period Elizebeth Friedman continued her own work in cryptology, and became famous in a number of trials involving rum-runners and the Coast Guard and FBI during Prohibition.
== Solution of cipher machines ==
During the 1920s, several new cipher machines were developed generally based on using typewriter mechanics and basic electrical circuitry. An early example was the Hebern Rotor Machine, designed in the US in 1915 by Edward Hebern. This system offered such security and simplicity of use that Hebern heavily promoted it to investors.

Friedman realized that the new rotor machines would be important, and devoted some time to analyzing Hebern&#x27;s design. Over a period of years, he developed principles of analysis and discovered several problems common to most rotor-machine designs. Examples of some dangerous features which allowed cracking of the generated code included having rotors step one position with each keypress, and putting the fastest rotor (the one that turns with every keypress) at either end of the rotor series. In this case, by collecting enough ciphertext and applying a standard statistical method known as the kappa test, he showed that he could, albeit with great difficulty, crack any cipher generated by such a machine.
Friedman used his understanding of rotor machines to develop several that were immune to his own attacks. The best of the lot was the SIGABA—which was destined to become the US&#x27;s highest-security cipher machine in World War II after improvements by Frank Rowlett and Laurance Safford. Just over 10,000 were built. A patent on SIGABA was filed at the end of 1944, but kept secret until 2001, long after Friedman had died, when it was finally issued as .

In 1939, the Japanese introduced a new cipher machine for their most sensitive diplomatic traffic, replacing an earlier system that SIS referred to as &quot;RED.&quot; The new cipher, which SIS called &quot;PURPLE&quot;, was different and much more difficult. The Navy&#x27;s cryptological unit (OP-20-G) and the SIS thought it might be related to earlier Japanese cipher machines, and agreed that SIS would handle the attack on the system. After several months trying to discover underlying patterns in PURPLE ciphertexts, an SIS team led by Friedman and Rowlett, in an extraordinary achievement, figured it out. PURPLE, unlike the German Enigma or the Hebern design, did not use rotors but stepper switches like those in automated telephone exchanges. Leo Rosen of SIS built a machine using—as was later discovered—the identical model of switch that the Japanese designer had chosen.

Thus, by the end of 1940, SIS had constructed an exact analog of the PURPLE machine without ever having seen one. With the duplicate machines and an understanding of PURPLE, SIS could decrypt increasing amounts of Japanese traffic. One such intercept was the message to the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., ordering an end (on December 7, 1941) to negotiations with the US. The message gave a clear indication of impending war, and was to have been delivered to the US State Department only hours prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The controversy over whether the US had foreknowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack has roiled well into the 21st century.

In 1941, Friedman was hospitalized with a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;, widely attributed to the mental strain of his work on PURPLE. While he remained in hospital, a four-man team—Abraham Sinkov and Leo Rosen from SIS, and Lt. Prescott Currier and Lt. Robert Weeks from the U.S. Navy&#x27;s OP-20-G—visited the British establishment at the &quot;Government Code and Cypher School&quot; at Bletchley Park. They gave the British a PURPLE machine, in exchange for details on the design of the Enigma machine and on how the British decrypted the Enigma cipher. However Friedman visited Bletchley Park in April 1943 and played a key role in drawing up the 1943 BRUSA Agreement.

== National Security Agency ==
Following World War II, Friedman remained in government signals intelligence. In 1949 he became head of the cryptographic division of the newly formed Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA) and in 1952 became chief cryptologist for the National Security Agency (NSA) when it was formed to take over from AFSA. Friedman produced a classic series of textbooks, &quot;Military Cryptanalysis&quot;, which was used to train NSA students. (These were revised and extended, under the title &quot;Military Cryptanalytics&quot;, by Friedman&#x27;s assistant and successor Lambros D. Callimahos, and used to train many additional cryptanalysts.) During his early years at NSA, he encouraged it to develop what were probably the first super-computers, although he was never convinced a machine could have the &quot;insight&quot; of a human mind.

Friedman spent much of his free time trying to decipher the famous Voynich Manuscript, said to be written sometime between 1403–1437. However, after four decades of study he finally had to admit defeat, contributing no more than an educated guess as to its origins and meaning.

In 1955, Friedman initiated, on behalf of the NSA, a secret agreement with Crypto AG, a Swiss manufacturer of encryption machines. The agreement resulted in many of the company&#x27;s machines being compromised, so that the messages produced by them became crackable by the NSA.

Friedman retired in 1956 and, with his wife, turned his attention to the problem that had originally brought them together: examining Bacon&#x27;s supposed codes. Together they wrote a book entitled &quot;The Cryptologist Looks at Shakespeare&quot;, which won a prize from the Folger Library and was published under the title &quot;The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined.&quot; The book demonstrated flaws in Gallup&#x27;s work and in that of others who sought hidden ciphers in Shakespeare&#x27;s work.

At NSA&#x27;s request Friedman prepared &quot;Six Lectures Concerning Cryptography and Cryptanalysis&quot;, which he delivered at NSA. But later the Agency, concerned about security, confiscated the reference materials from Friedman&#x27;s home.

== Death and legacy ==
Friedman&#x27;s health began to fail in the late 1960s, and he died in 1969. Friedman and his wife Elizebeth are buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Friedman and his wife donated their archives to the library of the George C. Marshall Foundation, which also has had material reclassified and removed by the NSA.

Friedman has been inducted into the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame and there is a building named after William and Elizebeth at the NSA complex at Fort Meade in Maryland. He was also presented the Medal for Merit by President Harry Truman, and the National Security Medal by Dwight Eisenhower.

Friedman has the distinction of having one of the longest known suppressed patent applications, for , a patent for a &quot;cryptographic system&quot;. It was filed on July 25, 1933, issued on August 1, 2000.

Friedman Hall, located on Fort Huachuca, Arizona, is named in his honor.

== Children ==
Friedman had two children with his wife, Elizebeth: Barbara Friedman (later Atchison), and John Ramsay Friedman.

== In popular culture ==
Commander Schoen, a character appearing in Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, is to a large extent inspired by Friedman. Schoen shares a significant background and personality traits with Friedman, including being one of the top cryptanalysts of the U.S. Army, breaking Japanese codes prior to Japan&#x27;s involvement in World War II, and the psychological problems that he suffered from as a result. In his acknowledgements, Stephenson writes &quot;Among all these great wartime hackers, some kind of special recognition must go to William Friedman, who sacrificed his health to break the Japanese machine cipher called Purple before the war even began.&quot;

<text>Jan Garrigue Masaryk (14 September 1886 – 10 March 1948) was a Czech diplomat and politician who served as the Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia from 1940 to 1948. American journalist John Gunther described Masaryk as &quot;a brave, honest, turbulent, and impulsive man&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in Prague, he was the son of professor and politician Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk (who became the first president of Czechoslovakia in 1918) and Charlotte Garrigue, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk&#x27;s American wife. Masaryk was educated in Prague and also in the United States, where he lived for a time as a drifter and for a time as a steelworker. Because of his youth in the United States, Masaryk always spoke both Czech and English with a strong American accent. He returned home in 1913 and served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War. Masaryk served in Galicia and learned Polish during his wartime career. The fact that his father was in exile, working for Czech independence from the Austrian empire, made him the subject of bullying and hazing during his military service as the son of a &quot;traitor&quot;. His unhappy military service made him unwilling to speak very much of his time as a soldier after the war as it held too many painful memories. 

He then joined the diplomatic service and became chargé d&#x27;affaires to the US in 1919 and then as counselor to the legation in London. In 1922, he became secretary to the Czechoslovak foreign minister Edvard Beneš. In 1925, he was made minister-plenipotentiary to Britain. The British scholar Robert Powell described Masaryk as &quot;the most unconventional of diplomats. None was less tied to protocol. Witty, shrewd, with an abundance of common sense, he often triumphed over circumstances, which baffled others more intellectually cleverer, but lacking his psychological insight... He could be disconcertingly direct in his conversation and he considerably embarrassed certain types of English people. His manner was American rather than English, his racy language often shocking to people who had not the wit or patience to look beyond the actual expressions used.&quot; By contrast, the Czech historian Zbyněk Zeman and the German historian Rainer Karlsch described Masaryk as a weak man who drifted during his time in the United States, was psychologically unstable, and needed someone to guide him through life. His father resigned as president in 1935 and died two years later. He was succeeded by Edvard Beneš. Masaryk had been dominated by his father, and afterward by Beneš, who played the role of a surrogate father.

==Minister-plenipotentiary in London==
Right from his arrival in London, Masaryk in his reports to Prague warned that many officials in Great Britain&#x27;s Foreign Office were in the grip of nostalgia for the Austrian empire, haunted by what he called the &quot;ghost of the Habsburg empire&quot;. Masaryk expressed concern that many in the Foreign Office were openly hostile towards Czechoslovakia and considered the nation a mistake that should never have been allowed to happen.

On 21 June 1927, under the influence of his Hungarian mistress, Princess Stephanie von Hohenlohe, the British press baron Lord Rothermere published a leader (editorial) in &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; newspaper calling for Hungary to regain lands lost under the Treaty of Trianon. Rothermere deemed it unjust that Hungary—a nation dominated by what he admiringly called a &quot;chivalrous and warlike aristocracy&quot;—should have its borders truncated and that Magyars should be placed under the rule of the peoples of Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, whom Rothermere described as &quot;cruder and more barbaric races&quot;. Through primarily concerned about what he called &quot;justice for Hungary&quot;, Rothermere also argued that the Sudetenland should go to Germany. Rothermere&#x27;s leader caused much worry in Prague and Beneš rushed to London to inquire if Rothermere was acting on behalf of the British government.

To counter the pro-Hungarian articles in &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, the hostility of the Foreign Office, and the indifference of the British people to Czechoslovakia, Masaryk had money given to British journalists who wrote pro-Czechoslovak articles to make these articles widely available in a bid to influence British public opinion. The two most important British intellectuals whom Masaryk supported were the journalist Wickham Steed and the historian Robert Seton-Watson, both of whom were staunch supporters of Czechoslovakia and longtime friends of his father, President Masaryk. Masaryk provided the funds to make the writings of Steed and Seton-Watson available to the widest possible audience. The faculty and students at the School of East European and Slavonic Studies at King&#x27;s College London tended to be very sympathetic towards Czechoslovakia, which was seen as a model democracy, and Masaryk often provided the funds to publicise their work. In 1930, when Steed&#x27;s journal &quot;The Review of Reviews&quot; went bankrupt, Masaryk granted him enough money to keep his journal afloat. As part of his cultural diplomacy, Masaryk sometimes worked with Yugoslav diplomats to provide the money for journalists willing to challenge the pro-Hungarian slant of &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, which was just as alarming to Belgrade as it was to Prague.

When Joachim von Ribbentrop arrived in London in October 1936 as the new German ambassador to the Court of St. James, he sent out invitations to the other ambassadors to attend a ball to introduce himself as was the normal practice at the time. Instead of using French (the language of diplomacy) in his invitations, which was the standard protocol, Ribbentrop insisted on using German as way to show the superiority of Germany. Masaryk responded to this gross violation of diplomatic protocol by giving his reply to Ribbentrop&#x27;s letter in Czech, instead of German as Ribbentrop had expected. The other ambassadors did likewise with the Japanese ambassador responding in Japanese and the Turkish ambassador responding in Turkish, which caused chaos at the German embassy as nobody was certain who was attending the ball, as the German embassy lacked people able to translate the various replies. During the Abdication crisis, Masaryk was hostile to the new king Edward VIII, whom he described as a Nazi sympathizer, writing in a dispatch to Prague that the king &quot;felt closer to fascism and Nazism than democracy, which he found slow and boring.&quot; Masaryk was equally hostile towards the king&#x27;s mistress, Mrs. Wallis Simpson, whom he reported has stated she felt at home in Vienna and Budapest while loathing Prague. When Edward abdicated to marry Mrs. Simpson, Masaryk was relieved, writing that Ribbentrop had &quot;lost in Mrs. Simpson a dangerous ally&quot;.

Unlike Beneš, Masaryk understood that the pro-Hungarian slant of &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; was caused by influence on Lord Rothermere of Princess von Hohenlohe, whom Masaryk also knew was the mistress of Fritz Wiedemann, the adjunct to Adolf Hitler. Masaryk described Rothermere as dominated by Hohenlohe, writing that he would do anything to please her. In a dispatch to Prague, Masaryk wrote: &quot;Is there any decency left in the world? A great scandal will erupt one day when the role upon which Steffi von Hohenlohe, née Richter, played during the visit of Wiedemann is revealed. This world-famous secret agent, spy, and swindler, who is a full Jewess, constitutes today the centre of Hitler&#x27;s propaganda in London. Wiedemann stayed at her place. She keeps Hitler&#x27;s photograph on her desk, inscribed &quot;To my dear Princess Hohenlohe-Adolf Hitler&quot;, and next to it a photograph of Horthy, dedicated to the &#x27;great stateswoman&#x27;.&quot; 

Starting in 1935, the Sudeten German leader Konrad Henlein had visited London four times between 1935-1938 to give speeches criticising Czechoslovakia. Masaryk realized belatedly that Czechoslovakia was losing the propaganda war as the British media became enamoured of Henlein. In late December 1936 Masaryk gave an address to a group of British MPs to make the case for Czechoslovakia. Much of the address concerned defending the decision on part of Beneš to sign an alliance with the Soviet Union in 1935, which was unpopular in Britain. Masaryk argued that the alliance was necessary as it brought the Soviet Union around to defending the international order created by the Treaty of Versailles instead of trying to undermine it as had previously been the case. Masaryk concluded: &quot;If we treat Russia as a pariah, it cannot be excluded that Russia and Germany could again get together.&quot; After his speech, Masaryk had an informal question and answer session with the assembled MPs. The two MPs that Masaryk spoke to the most were Sir Austen Chamberlain and Winston Churchill. Churchill warned Masaryk that British public opinion was turning against Czechoslovakia because of the Sudetenland issue, which the German government &quot;would be able to use against us&quot;.

In May 1937, the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, introduced Masaryk to the newly crowned king, George VI. Eden told the king that &quot;the political and economic situation in Czechoslovakia, Sir, is good and firm.&quot; At the same audience, Ribbentrop greeted the king by giving him the Nazi salute, to which the king responded to with a bemused smile. The interaction between Ribbentrop and George left Masaryk uncertain to regard this as either silly or sinister. Masaryk reported to Prague that it would be unwise to place too much trust in Britain, which regarded Czechoslovakia as a problem in Europe. By 1938, Masaryk was reporting: &quot;The English dislike us intensely. We are a deadweight for them and they curse the day on which we were founded.&quot;

During the Sudetenland crisis in the summer and fall of 1938, Masaryk traveled between London and Prague to meet with Beneš. To resolve the Sudetenland crisis, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain visited Germany to meet Adolf Hitler in his vacation home near Berchtesgaden on 15 September 1938. At the Berchtesgaden summit, it was agreed that the Sudetenland would &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; as Hitler had been demanding ever since the Nazi Party Congress at Nuremberg (Reichsparteitag) on 12 September 1938. In an attempt to sway British public opinion against the policy of the Chamberlain government, Masaryk, together with the Soviet ambassador Ivan Maisky, was in contact with Clement Attlee, the leader of the Labour Party, which was the Official Opposition to the Conservative-dominated National Government. Maisky and Masaryk encouraged Attlee to challenge the government&#x27;s policy in the House of Commons. Masaryk was also in contact with Charles Corbin, the French ambassador in London. As a further step, Beneš had a large sum of money transferred to the Czechoslovak legation for Masaryk to spend on winning over British public opinion. Masaryk donated much of the money to Churchill&#x27;s group &quot;The Focus&quot;. Unknown to Masaryk, the &quot;Forschungsamt&quot; (&quot;Research Office&quot;) had broken the Czechoslovak diplomatic codes. Hermann Göring who was a close friend of Sir Nevile Henderson, the British ambassador to Germany, informed him that Masaryk was donating money to Churchill, information which Henderson in turn passed on to Chamberlain. The British historian Victor Rothwell noted that the revelation that Masaryk was subsidising Chamberlain&#x27;s domestic critics such as Churchill made an extremely bad impression upon Chamberlain, and that much of the hostility that Chamberlain displayed towards Masaryk was due to this revelation. 

Under very strong Anglo-French pressure, President Beneš agreed to the terms of the &quot;Berchtesgaden summit&quot; on 19 September 1938. However, at the Bad Godesberg summit on 24 September 1938, Hitler rejected the Anglo-French plan for ceding the Sudetenland to Germany, telling Chamberlain that the Sudetenland needed to be annexed to Germany before 1 October 1938 rather than after October 1 as the Anglo-French plan called for. The Bad Godesberg summit pushed Europe to the brink of war. On 25 September 1938, Masaryk arrived at 10 Downing Street to tell Chamberlain that through Beneš had accepted the results of the Berchtesgaden summit, he rejected the German timetable for handing over the Sudetenland put forward at the Bad Godesberg summit. Much to Masaryk&#x27;s annoyance, both Chamberlain and the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, seemed more angry at Beneš for not withdrawing Czechoslovak troops from the border forts in the Sudetenland rather than at Hitler, leading Masaryk in a dispatch to Beneš recounting the meeting to call both Chamberlain and Halifax &quot;stupid&quot;. To resolve the crisis on 28 September 1938, it was announced that an emergency summit would be held in Munich the next day to be attended by Hitler, Chamberlain, Benito Mussolini, and Édouard Daladier. To Masaryk&#x27;s fury, the Munich conference was a return to the congress diplomacy of the 19th century where the leaders of the great powers would meet to decide the fate of Europe with no involvement from the small powers. Halifax told Masaryk that Vojtěch Mastný, the Czechoslovak minister-plenipotentiary in Berlin, would be allowed to attend the Munich conference only as an &quot;observer&quot; for &quot;information only&quot; with no power to be actually involved in the conference.

The resulting Munich Agreement of 30 September 1938 put an end to the crisis. Though the Munich Agreement was actually a compromise as Hitler dropped the demand to have the Sudetenland before 1 October 1938, it was agreed that the Sudetenland would go to Germany in stages over the course of October 1938. Without the natural defensive barrier posed by the mountains of the Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia was defenseless against Germany, and as such the new Czechoslovak president Emil Hácha promptly performed a &quot;volte-face&quot; in foreign policy. A sign of the new foreign policy came with the order that the staff of the legation in London should remove all the portraits of President Beneš and President Masaryk from the walls. After the Munich conference, Masaryk met with Chamberlain and Halifax at 10 Downing Street where he stated: &quot;If you have sacrificed my nation for the sake of peace, I will be the first to applaud you. But if not gentlemen, then God help your souls.&quot; On 1 October 1938, Churchill telephoned Masaryk to tell him that Beneš should delay handing over the border forts in the Sudetenland for the next 48 hours, as he was convinced that &quot;a great reaction against the betrayal committed on us&quot; would occur within the 48 hours that would topple the Chamberlain government and presumably install Churchill as prime minister. Masaryk did not believe this, and advised Beneš to disregard Churchill&#x27;s advice, warning that Churchill was reckless and that however he much he hoped that Chamberlain&#x27;s government might fall because of the Munich Agreement, he did not believe that this was very likely. Unknown to both Churchill and Masaryk, their phones had been tapped by MI5, and the conversation recording Churchill&#x27;s attempt to sabotage the Munich Agreement was passed on to Chamberlain, who was not impressed.

In October 1938, the Sudetenland was occupied by Germany and Masaryk resigned as ambassador in protest, although he remained in London. Other government members including Beneš also resigned. In his last dispatch to Prague on 5 December 1938, Masaryk reported that the British now regarded Czecho-Slovakia (as the country had been renamed) as a German satellite state. In the letter announcing his resignation as minister on 30 December 1938, Masaryk wrote of the &quot;prophylactic measures towards establishing permanent peace in Europe&quot; where &quot;my country was subjected to surgical appeasement with unprecedented vigor and not the slightest trace of anesthetic.&quot; Masaryk then left Britain to visit the United States, where he gave speeches criticizing appeasement. In a speech in January 1939, he argued that the Munich Agreement would have been justified if it brought about &quot;permanent peace&quot; in Europe, but he argued that it was very unlikely to do so.

On 15 March 1939, Germany occupied the remaining parts of the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, and a puppet Slovak state was established in Slovakia. The next day, 16 March 1939, Masaryk went on a radio station in New York, where in a radio address to the American people given in English, he stated: &quot;Can I hope that this last blow to my homeland should dispel all doubts as to the future policy of the masters of central Europe? The rape of Bohemia in all its vulgarity is more than I can describe. Forgive me-&quot;. At that point, Masaryk broke down in tears. Upon regaining his composure, Masaryk stated: &quot;I do not envy those who are perpetuating this horrible drama, either by vandal force or by turning their faces to the wall. They have committed sins against God.&quot; In July 1939, Masaryk returned to London, where he rented a flat in Westminster.

== Wartime ==
During the war he regularly made broadcasts over the BBC to occupied Czechoslovakia starting in September 1939 and ending in April 1945. Masaryk&#x27;s speeches on the BBC&#x27;s Czech language station made him into a national hero. It was illegal to listen to the BBC in the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia, but that did not stop people from tuning in to the BBC every Wednesday night to hear him speak on a radio program entitled &quot;Volá Londýn&quot; (&quot;London Calling&quot;). On 8 September 1939, Masaryk gave his first radio broadcast on the &quot;Volá Londýn&quot; show, where he called for &quot;a free Czechoslovakia in a free Europe&quot;. During the war, the &quot;Volá Londýn&quot; radio show was the most popular radio program in Czechoslovakia and Masaryk was the most popular speaker on the show.

In an article published in &quot;Central European Observer&quot; on 1 February 1940, Masaryk declared his war aims as: &quot;My conviction is that our little country is not going to be saved by any of these grand &#x27;isms&#x27;-neither Fascism nor Bolshevism, Pan-Germanism or Pan-Slavism...I am definitely a Slav, but I hope an European first. I am convinced that the fate of our people cannot be separated from that of other Central European and Danubian peoples, whether they are Slavs or not...Narrow nationalism should disappear...An equal partnership in the cause of an European &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, a breakaway from isms of every kind. A Free Germany in a Free Europe; and besides her the Czechoslovakia of St. Wenceslas, Hus, Comenius, Palacký, Smetana, Masaryk and Čapek...A Free Czechoslovakia in a Free Europe&quot;.

When a Czechoslovak government-in-exile was established in Britain in July 1940, Masaryk was appointed Foreign Minister. He had a flat at Westminster Gardens, Marsham Street in London but often stayed at the Czechoslovak Chancellery residence at Wingrave or with President Beneš at Aston Abbotts, both near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. With the launch of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, Beneš had an unlimited faith in the potential of the Soviet Union, believing that Germany would be defeated by the spring of 1942 at the latest. Masaryk told the other cabinet members: &quot;he [Beneš] now only has Russia on his mind. We must hold him, so that he won’t fly off to the sky&quot;. In 1942 Masaryk received an LL.D. from Bates College. Beneš had lived in France for much of his life, and was described as someone who &quot;knew France&quot; well, but in contrast, he found the British to be something of a &quot;mystery&quot;. Masaryk who lived in London for so long often made suggestions to appeal to a British audience. Powell wrote: &quot;An understanding of human psychology was not one of the President&#x27;s outstanding achievements, nor was his knowledge of languages. Masaryk made up for these deficiencies&quot;.

Beneš&#x27;s main interest as president of a government-in-exile to have the British agree to abrogate the Munich Agreement and accept that after the war the Sudetenland was to become part of Czechoslovakia again, a war aim that the British were initially opposed to as the British position until August 1942 was that the Munich Agreement was still in effect. In a letter to Eden, who was again serving as Foreign Secretary, on 25 August 1941, Masaryk expressed much concern that the Atlantic Charter would mean that the Sudetenland would remain a part of Germany. Masaryk argued to Eden that Czechoslovakia and the other neighbors of Germany needed a situation after the war that &quot;would enable them to defend peace for themselves and for the world against any future attempts by aggression by Germany&quot;, which in turn required a defensible frontier (i.e. returning the Sudetenland to Czechoslovakia). Masaryk as foreign minister was regarded by the Foreign Office as the more reasonable than Beneš who was viewed as obstinate on the Sudetenland issue.

In a 1943 speech on the &quot;Volá Londýn&quot; radio show to celebrate the Jewish new year, Masaryk urged people in the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia to assist the Jewish community, saying it was incumbent to extend a helping hand to the &quot;most wretched of the wretched&quot; as he called the Jews of the protectorate, saying that he wanted ordinary Czechs to be able say after the war that &quot;we remained decent people&quot;. A supporter of Zionism, Masaryk was a friend of Dr. Chaim Weizmann. 

In June 1943, Masaryk spoke with Philip Nichols of the Foreign Office and expressed much doubt about a proposed treaty to create a military alliance between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union that was being energetically championed by Zdeněk Fierlinger, the Czechoslovak ambassador in Moscow. Through Masaryk did not oppose the proposed treaty outright, he hinted to Nichols that he preferred that after the war that Czechoslovakia move closer to Poland rather than the Soviet Union. Between 17 October 1943 – 10 February 1944, Masaryk went on a lengthy speaking tour of the United States, which removed him from the meetings of the Czechoslovak cabinet. In December 1943, Beneš went to Moscow to sign a treaty creating a 25-year military alliance between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. Upon his return to London, Masaryk was forced to accept the &quot;fait accompli&quot;. In a radio speech on 16 February 1944, Masaryk stated that the Soviet-Czechoslovak alliance &quot;was approved of in America&quot;, though &quot;there were a few reactionaries who hide their own selfish interests behind the pretense of the fear of Bolshevism&quot;. Masaryk added that &quot;we should get used to calling it the Soviet empire. Because it will be the Soviet empire which will play the most important role on the continent&quot;.

In an unauthorised act, Fierlinger in July 1944 sent out a public telegram to Edward Osóbka-Morawski, celebrating the entry of the Polish People&#x27;s Army onto Polish soil, which led Beneš to rebuke Fierlinger for an act that implied support for the Soviet puppet Lublin government. Masaryk wanted to fire Fierlinger for that letter, complaining he was no longer representing Czechoslovakia in Moscow in any meaningful sense of the term. On 28 July 1944, the entire Czechoslovak cabinet recommended to Beneš that he sack Fierlinger as ambassador in Moscow and appoint a new ambassador who would represent the interests of the government-in-exile instead of the Soviet Union, advice that Beneš refused to accept.

In April 1945, Beneš and Masaryk travelled to Moscow to meet Stalin, where it was agreed that the foreign policy of Czechoslovakia would be aligned with the Soviet Union, but that Czechoslovakia would retain its independence and democracy.

== After the war ==
Masaryk remained Foreign Minister following the liberation of Czechoslovakia as part of the multi-party, communist-dominated National Front government. The Communists under Klement Gottwald saw their position strengthened after the 1946 elections but Masaryk stayed on as Foreign Minister. He was concerned with retaining the friendship of the Soviet Union, but was dismayed by the veto they put on Czechoslovak participation in the Marshall Plan.

Czechoslovakia sold arms to Israel during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The deliveries from Czechoslovakia proved important for the establishment of Israel. Masaryk personally signed the first contract on 14 January 1948. Because Masaryk was viewed as the most sympathetic to the Jews of members of the postwar government, he was given the task of &quot;appeasing Jewish organisations in the west&quot; in terms of the government&#x27;s plans to expel the country&#x27;s German population, including German-speaking Jews.

In February 1948 the majority of the non-communist cabinet members resigned, hoping to force new elections, but instead a communist government under Gottwald was formed in what became known as the Czech coup (&quot;Victorious February&quot; in the Eastern Bloc). Masaryk met the visiting Soviet deputy foreign minister, Zorin, who told him that he hoped that he would become a member of the &quot;new government&quot;, which confused Masaryk as the current government had not fallen. Zorin told him that &quot;Gottwald is our only guarantee. The government must be cleaned up. We are determined to build a new one, which is more friendly to us and we shall support Gottwald&quot;. Masaryk remained Foreign Minister, and was the only prominent minister in the new government who was neither a Communist nor a fellow traveller. 

Masaryk served as the President of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. A memorial to his memory and his presidency of the Organisation is located in Geneva, Switzerland.

== Death ==

On 10 March 1948 Masaryk was found dead, dressed only in his pajamas, in the courtyard of the Foreign Ministry (the Černín Palace in Prague) below his bathroom window. 

Jan Masaryk&#x27;s remains were buried next to his parents in a plot at Lány cemetery, where in 1994 also the ashes of his sister Alice Masaryková were laid to rest.

The Ministry of the Interior claimed that he had committed suicide by jumping out of the window, but at the time, it was widely assumed that he was murdered at the behest of the nascent Communist government. On the other hand, many of his close associates (e.g. his secretary Antonín Sum, his press assistant Josef Josten, his sister Olga or Viktor Fischl) have always defended the suicide story.

In a second investigation taken in 1968 during the Prague Spring, Masaryk&#x27;s death was ruled an accident, not excluding a murder and a third investigation in the early 1990s after the Velvet Revolution concluded that it had been a murder.

In his 1980 autobiography &quot;History and Memory&quot;, US Ambassador Charles W. Yost, a friend of Masaryk who worked with him in Prague in 1947, and also a friend of Masaryk&#x27;s fiancée Marcia Davenport, wrote, &quot;The Communists used him and, when his usefulness was past, flung him out of a window to his death.&quot;

Discussions about the mysterious circumstances of his death continued for some time. Those who believe that Masaryk was murdered called it the Third (or Fourth) Defenestration of Prague, and point to the presence of nail marks on the window sill from which Masaryk fell, as well as smearings of feces and Masaryk&#x27;s stated intention to leave Prague the next day for London. Members of Masaryk&#x27;s family—including his former wife, Frances Crane Leatherbee, a former in-law named Sylvia E. Crane, and his sister Alice Masaryková — stated their belief that he had indeed killed himself, according to a letter written by Sylvia E. Crane to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and considered the possibility of murder a &quot;cold war cliché&quot;. However, a Prague police report in 2004 concluded after forensic research that Masaryk had indeed been thrown out of the window to his death. This report was seemingly corroborated in 2006 when a Russian journalist claimed that his mother knew the Russian intelligence officer who threw Masaryk out of the window of the west bathroom of Masaryk&#x27;s flat.

The highest-ranking Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa, claimed he had a conversation with Nicolae Ceauşescu, who told him about &quot;ten international leaders the Kremlin killed or tried to kill&quot;. Jan Masaryk was one of them.

Czech historian Václava Jandečková has tentatively suggested in her 2015 monograph &quot;Kauza Jan Masaryk: Nový pohled&quot; (The Jan Masaryk Case: A New Perspective) that Masaryk might have been murdered by Jan Bydžovský and František Fryč, who believed they were working for the British intelligence service SIS, but most probably fell victim to NKVD agents. Bydžovský confessed to murdering Masaryk when interrogated in prison by the Czech secret police StB in the 1950s (in an unrelated case); but later denied it. Jandečková argues that this confession cannot be so easily dismissed as has been believed, especially since Bydžovský certainly was not hallucinating or drugged, and the interrogators seem to have been surprised by his confession (at his trial, the Masaryk murder was not &quot;used&quot; or even mentioned, although a separate re-investigation by the StB continued for more than a year).

A new investigation that opened in 2019 included a new expert opinion regarding the mechanics of the fall, and an old tape by the policeman who was among the first at the crime scene, testifying the body had been already moved when he arrived. The investigation closed in 2021, with murder, accident or suicide all possible.

== Private life ==

From 1924 until their divorce in 1931, Masaryk was married to Frances Crane Leatherbee (1887-1954). An heiress to the Crane piping, valves and elevator fortune, and the former wife of Robert Leatherbee, she was a daughter of Charles R. Crane, a U.S. minister to China; and a sister of Richard Teller Crane II, a U.S. ambassador to Czechoslovakia. By that marriage, Masaryk had three stepchildren: Charles Leatherbee, Robert Leatherbee Jr., and Richard Crane Leatherbee. Stepson Charles Leatherbee (Harvard 1929) co-founded the University Players, a summer stock company in Falmouth, Massachusetts, in 1928 with Bretaigne Windust. He married Mary Lee Logan (1910-1972), younger sister of Joshua Logan, who became one of the co-directors of the University Players in 1931.

In 1945 the exile Masaryk became close to the American writer Marcia Davenport, whom he felt had a strong affinity to Czechs and to the city of Prague, depicted in several of her books. Davenport had in 1944 divorced her husband Russell Davenport and is known to have followed Masaryk to post-war Prague and lived with him there from 1945 to 1948. Following the Communist coup she returned to London, where she and Masaryk planned to be married as soon as he could join her, but only a few days later he was found dead.

Masaryk was a skilled amateur pianist. In that capacity, he accompanied Jarmila Novotná in a recital of Czech folk songs issued on 78 RPM records to commemorate the victims of the Nazi eradication of Lidice.

He is reputed to have had an exquisite sense of humour. It is reported that when he was a young Czechoslovak Ambassador to the US, he attended many parties and once the hostess invited him to play the violin. Accepting graciously, he played a Czech nursery song to enthusiastic applause from the audience. Leaving the party with a friend, he was asked why had he been asked to play the violin, to which he replied: &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s all very simple-- don&#x27;t you see? They have mixed me up with my father; they mixed him up with Paderewski. And they mixed the piano up with the violin.&quot; Jan Masaryk was active in many societies, among those he was active freemason.

==Jan Masaryk Medal==

The Honorary Silver Medal of Jan Masaryk (Czech: &quot;Stříbrná medaile Jana Masaryka&quot;) is awarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic and is one of the highest awards that can be received by foreign nationals.

<text>A tire iron (also tire lever or tire spoon) is a specialized metal or plastic tool used in working with tires. Tire irons have not been in common use for automobile tires since the shift to the use of tubeless tires in the late 1950s.

Bicycle tire irons are still in use for those tires which have a separate inner tube, and can have a hooked C-shape cut into one end of the iron so that it may be hooked on a bicycle spoke to hold it in place.

== Description and use ==

Tire irons, which usually come in pairs or threes, are used to pry the edge of a tire away from the rim of the wheel it has been mounted on. After one iron has pried a portion of the tire from its wheel, it is held in position while a second iron is applied further along the tire to pry more of the tire away from the wheel. This allows enough of the tire to be separated so that the first iron can be removed, and used again on the far side of the other iron. Alternating in this way, a person can work all the way around the tire to fully remove it from the wheel, in order to reach the tube that sits inside.

In the first half of the 20th century, they became a colloquial term of strength, as in &quot;I couldn&#x27;t get rid of him with a pair of tire irons,&quot; and frequently appeared in cartoons in similar situations. The usage is now considered passé.

== Bicycle tire irons ==
Tire irons for bicycles are usually referred to as &quot;tire levers&quot;, as they are often made of plastic, not metal.

Tire levers for bicycle tires have one end that is tapered and slightly curved. The other end is usually hooked so that it can be hooked around a spoke to keep the tire bead free of the rim at one point, allowing a second lever to be manipulated forward, progressively loosening a larger segment of the tire bead from the rim.

A common feature of tire levers is the lack of sharp edges. The slightest pinch of an inner tube by a lever can weaken or puncture the tube. It is good practice to examine a set of tire levers for any sharp edges and to file them smooth and round. Another problem, though less critical, is that a steel lever would scratch aluminum rims.

Classically, tire levers were made of metal. However plastic ones are now manufactured which are even less sharp and less likely to puncture the tube. There are also some single-lever varieties, which can be inserted under the bead at one point then quickly pushed around the rim to pop the bead off.

Tire levers are not necessary or desirable in all cases. In some cases, the tire can be reinserted on the rim, and sometimes removed from the rim, without the use of tire levers. This reduces the chance of puncture caused by pinching the tube between the rim and the tire bead. Sometimes they are used to fit the tire back on, but this can be done without the levers.

<text>As () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Limburg. On January 1, 2006, As had a total population of 7,497. The total area is 22.07 km2 which gives a population density of 340 inhabitants per km2.

==History==

In 1971 the municipality was formed by the merger of two villages - As and Niel-bij-As, which both lie on the Bosbeek brook on the Campine plateau between the rivers Demer and Meuse.

The location of the settlements close to a water course in this dry region gave rise to the villages&#x27; names: &quot;As&quot; is a prehistoric name for water (&quot;Aska&quot;) which first referred to the Bosbeek brook and later the village itself.

Archaeological finds indicate an early prehistoric settlement, including objects made of flint dating from the earliest Stone Age. The area was inhabited from 500 BC as shown by a cemetery in the field between Genk and As. The Romans built the road from Tongeren to Venlo via Munsterbilzen and As. The current road next to the brook and the roads to Niel and Dorne follow the course of the Roman road. However, the Romans did not establish any settlements in the area as the sandy soil was not fertile enough. After the fall of Rome, the Francs invaded the area and established 
themselves in As. The Merovingian cemetery indicates that As was an important village from 500 - 700. The region started to be Christianised from the eighth century, and the first church was built on the site of the current Saint Aldegonde&#x27;s Church. The church is first mentioned in a letter dated 1108 in which Otbert, Prince-Bishop of Luik reported to the abbey of Rolduc about &quot;income from the churches of Riemst, Genk, As and Gellik&quot;.

Niel was first mentioned in a charter of 1253 in which Arnold, Earl of Borgloon, was granted the Villa of Dilsen with Niel and the castle of Stokkem. In 1299 the Earl of Borgloon was recorded appointing Arnold van Gellik as pastor of As. In 1303 the Abbey was granted a perpetual lease on the village of As. The people of Niel, however, still relied on Dilsen for religious obligations, until 1721 when Pastor Bex from Dilsen created Niel as an independent parish. Bex&#x27;s cousin Adam Dellecomminne became the first pastor of Niel.

Since the early Middle Ages, the original oak and birch forests were cleared more and more for agriculture and heathland fields. The present hamlets, of which Oeleinde is the oldest, developed into a farming village. In 1901 the first coal was discovered in As, which led to the industrialisation of the region. Now, As is mainly a residential municipality set along large heathland fields and woodland areas.

<text>Beringen (; , ; ) is a city and municipality located in the Belgian province of Limburg. The Beringen municipality includes the town of Beringen proper and the old communes of Beverlo, Koersel, and Paal.

==History==

===Origins===

Beringen was already inhabited in Celtic times, as proven by the 1995 archeological finds of gold coins and artifacts on its territory. These date from around 90 BC and are the most northerly late-Iron-Age gold objects found in Europe. Other finds, including of Roman coins, indicate a very early establishment. The first mention of Beringen dates to 1120 when it was known as &#x27;Beringe&#x27;, a word derived from the Germanic Beringum, which meant &#x27;with the people of Bero&#x27;. During Carolingian times, the land of Beringen had been donated to the abbey of Corbie in France.

For most of the medieval period, it was part of the County of Loon, from which it received its city charter in 1239. The city was then protected by impressive moats and gated walls. The county of Loon as a whole was annexed to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège in 1366. Beringen became one of the bishopric&#x27;s 23 &quot;bonnes villes&quot; (principal cities) and shared its history until its dissolution in 1795.

===Mining past===
Under André Dumont’s guidance, the first coal-bearing drill cores were obtained in Campine in 1901, leading to several coalmines being established in the region. The first production in Koersel dates from 1919. The golden age of coal production started right after World War II and lasted until the late 1950s, when cheaper energy sources were made available elsewhere. The last coal mine in Beringen closed its doors on October 28, 1989. The remaining slag heaps and mining buildings are still very obvious around the city.

==Sights==

*The Beringen Mine Museum and spoil tip is one of Beringen’s main attractions and retraces the industrial history of the region. It is a former Anchor Point of ERIH, the European Route of Industrial Heritage.
*The St. Peter in Chains Church, with its elegant spire and rich Baroque interior.
*With its good network of biking trails, Beringen is also one of the best places in Campine for bikers.

==Events==
*Yearly Kermesses take place both in Beringen Paal and in Koersel.
*At the beginning of August, Paal also organizes a whole-day musical event: &quot;Paal op Stelten&quot;
*The two-day-long &quot;Koersel Terrast&quot; takes place in late spring: music, dance, and fireworks are enjoyed by adults and children alike.
*A round of the Ethias Cross cyclocross race series has been held on a course on part of the site of the former coal mine since the 2019—2020 season
* The 1st round of the 2024 Exact Cross, Cyclocross Trophy was held here on 8 Oct. First place was taken by Fem Van Empel.

==Famous past and present residents==

<text>Genk () is a municipality and city located in the Belgian province of Limburg near Hasselt. The municipality only comprises the town of Genk itself. It is one of the most important industrial towns in Flanders, located on the Albert Canal, between Antwerp and Liège.

==History==
===Celtic and medieval origins===
Genk probably originated as a Celtic village, and was converted to Christianity in the 10th century. The remains of a little wooden church dating from that period were found in the area. The first mention of Genk as &quot;Geneche&quot; can be found in a document dating from 1108, ceding the territory to the Abbey of Rolduc. Politically, Genk belonged to the County of Loon until it was annexed by the Prince-Bishopric of Liège in 1365.

=== 19th century ===
During a century of on-going industrialisation further south in Belgium, Limburg modernised only slowly: Genk remained unimportant and small, growing slowly to a population of 2,000 around 1900. The village was the home of landscape painters and writers such as Neel Doff and became an artist colony where over 400 landscape painters painted en plein air.

===20th-century development===
In 1901, André Dumont found a large quantity of coal in the nearby village of As. Soon after, the &quot;Black Gold&quot; was also found in Genk. After World War I, the village started to attract a large quantity of both Belgian and foreign immigrants, and quickly became the biggest town in Limburg after Hasselt, peaking to a population of 70,000. However, in 1966 the coal mine of Zwartberg closed down, and Genk had to develop new industries, mainly along the Albert Canal and highways. By the end of the 1980s, the two remaining coal mines at Winterslag and Waterschei were also closed.

In 2000, Genk officially became a city.

==Economy==

Genk is the industrial centre of the province of Limburg and offers over 45,000 jobs, making it economically the third most significant city in Flanders.

In 1900, Genk was a quiet village with around 2,000 residents. At that time, Genk was known for its natural environment, popular among artists and painters who used Genk as a setting for their pieces. In 1901, coal was discovered in Genk and three mining sites were developed: Zwartberg, Waterschei and Winterslag (C-mine today). As a result, the population grew exponentially: today Genk has about 65,000 inhabitants with 107 different ethnic backgrounds. The mines had some good years, but in 1966 the Zwartberg mine closed, followed by Winterslag (C-mine today) in 1986 and Waterschei in 1987.

The Genk Body &amp; Assembly factory of Ford Motor Company was the largest and most important employer in Genk until recently, employing some 5,000 people and building the Mondeo sedan and hatchback, the Galaxy (second generation, from 2006 and onwards) MPV/minivan, and the S-MAX sub-MPV. The factory closed in 2014.

===C-Mine===
The city went looking for new opportunities for the enormous mine sites on its territory, including the Winterslag site. In 2000, the idea began to grow to accommodate a creative hub in the buildings of the old coal mine of Winterslag. In 2001, the city of Genk bought the site from LRM (Limburgse Reconversie Maatschappij) and the name &quot;C-mine&quot; was born in 2005. As regards content, the creative hub works on four cornerstones: education, creative economy, creative recreation and artistic creation and presentation. With a university college specialised in various artistic graduation subjects, an incubator for young entrepreneurs, a cultural centre, a design centre, a cinema, C-mine expedition, etc. the C-mine mission has succeeded. It has created 330 jobs in 42 companies and organisations, including around 200 jobs in the creative sector in 33 creative companies.

Each day, C-mine produces: games, apps, websites, sets for television, drones, light shows, design items, stage productions, etc. C-mine is a site of creative makers in each of the four segments.

* Companies in C-Mine:
* E-nventors Lab / C-mine crib: E-nventors Lab is the research &amp; development department of E-nvention that examines the latest technologies.

==Sights==

* The biggest tourist attraction of Genk is Bokrijk, an open-air museum consisting of authentic relocated buildings (mainly dating from 17th till 19th century) from all over Flanders. In the summer season, historical Flanders comes alive in Bokrijk through numerous actors and re-enactment events. 
* Genk was established as one of the entrance &quot;gateways&quot; of the Hoge Kempen National Park, the first National Park in Flanders, at its opening in 2006.
* Also noteworthy are the old coalmines of Zwartberg, Waterschei and Winterslag, surrounded by slag heaps, huge black mountains of dug up soil and coal remnants. Some of the mine buildings and housing can be visited.
* Despite its industrial past and present, Genk is nicknamed &#x27;De Groene Stad&#x27; (&quot;The Green City&quot;). It sports a nature reserve called &quot;De Maten&quot;, the large recreational area Kattevennen (with the Europlaneterium), Bokrijk, and several other green areas. In sunny weather, you may also want to pay a visit to the &quot;Sundial Park&quot; (). The history of the landscape painters who visited Genk between 1840 and 1940 can be discovered in the Museum Emile Van Doren.
* The Europlanetarium Genk has a planetarium and observatory.

==Events==
* Genk was home of &quot;Motives Festival&quot;, an annual event taking place in November and celebrating &quot;new sounds of jazz.&quot; Recent performers have included the fiery piano jazz of Esbjörn Svensson Trio, funky saxman Joshua Redman, and futuristic electronics wizard Leafcutter John. Another musical event, &quot;Genk on Stage&quot;, takes place during three days in the summer. This festival is celebrated no more.
* Genk is also rich in tradition, with a colourful carnival taking place around Ash Wednesday, the May celebrations featuring the May Queen, a flowers parade and a huge fireworks finale, and finally the Saint Martin procession, in honour of Saint Martin of Tours, one of the most popular saints in Flanders.
* In 2012 Genk was host to Manifesta, The roving European Biennial of Contemporary Art, together with events such as the biennial of Venice and the Documenta in Kassel, Manifesta is one of the foremost art events of Europe.

==Transportation==

Besides the Albert Canal, Genk has rail service to Hasselt and a small airport (EBZW) northeast of the town center. De Lijn is the sole bus transport service provider within Genk.

==Sports==

Genk&#x27;s major football club, KRC Genk, promoted from the second division in 1996 and quickly became one of Belgium&#x27;s top clubs. They finished first in the highest football league in 1999, 2002, 2011 and 2019 and won the Belgian Cup in 1998, 2000, 2009, 2013 and 2021. Because of this success, the &quot;Luminus Arena&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Fenix Stadium&quot; and &quot;Cristal Arena&quot;) of KRC Genk (place for 25 500 supporters) has become an important centre of both sport and non-sport activities in recent years. In the 2016–2017 season Genk reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Europa League by defeating fellow Belgian side K.A.A. Gent over two legs, one of which was a 5–2 win.

Karting Genk is a kart racing CIK FIA track. In 2011 it hosted the Karting World Championship.

<doc id="175130" wikidata="Q319792" url="?curid=175130" title="Heusden-Zolder">
<text>Heusden-Zolder (; ) is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Limburg near Hasselt. On 1 January 2006 Heusden-Zolder had a total population of 30,769. The total area is 53.23 km² which gives a population density of 578 inhabitants per km².

Heusden-Zolder was the result of the merger on 1 January 1977 of the two former municipalities of Heusden and Zolder, and currently consists of the former Heusden parishes of Heusden centre, Berkenbos and Eversel, and the former Zolder parishes of Zolder centre, Boekt, Viversel, Bolderberg and Lindeman.

Heusden-Zolder is home to almost 2,000 immigrants from all over the world. This is due to the (now closed) coal mine of Zolder. During the 1960s Belgian coal mines faced an enormous shortage of employees. To address this problem, foreigner labourers were encouraged to immigrate and work near the mines. After their closure (the mine in Zolder was the last one in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg to close in 1992) most of the immigrants chose to stay, which makes Heusden-Zolder a relatively multicultural place.

==Local infrastructure==

The town hall, a large glass construction, is located in Zolder centre since the merger. As a compromise, the former town hall of Heusden is now used instead by the local social security department (OCMW).

Heusden-Zolder has one hospital, the Sint-Franciscusziekenhuis. Also, it has one secondary school, the Sint-Franciscuscollege, which is spread over two campusses: one in Heusden centre and one in Berkenbos. Heusden-Zolder also has a railway station, called &quot;Zolder station&quot;. The town is easily accessible via the Albert Canal and the highway E314 and has therefore several industrial zones, such as &#x27;Zolder-Lummen&#x27;.

==Places of interest==
*Meylandt Castle, a castle donated to Heusden-Zolder by the De Theux de Meylandt family. It is currently used as an art school.

==Famous activities==
* De Revue, comical theatre play in the Heusden dialect.
* The Grand Prix Erik De Vlaeminck Heusden-Zolder is a UCI Cyclo-cross World Cup competition traditionally held on Boxing Day.

== Sport ==
* De Veen, an athletics stadium that yearly hosts the KBC Night of Athletics, the second most important athletics meeting in Belgium after the world famous Memorial Van Damme in Brussels.

*The Circuit Terlaemen, was the former Formula One home to the Belgian Grand Prix and host of the 2007 Belgian Champ Car Grand Prix.

*The 1969 and 2002 UCI Road World Championships, the 2002 and 2016 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships and the 2003 Motocross des Nations were held at the Circuit Terlaemen.

*The Speedway Club Helzold hold motorcycle speedway events at the Helzold Stadium, located at the intersection of Stadionlaan and Helzoldlaan. The stadium has hosted important events, including Netherlands and Belgian qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Championship (starting in 1987).

==Climate==
Heusden-Zolder has an oceanic climate due to Gulf Stream influence, in spite of its inland position. The municipality is in the region with the warmest summers in the Benelux region with July average highs.

==Famous inhabitants==
* Evil Superstars, indie rock band
* Luc Nilis, football player
* Regi Penxten, Milk Inc. and DJ
* Dries Vanthoor, racing driver.
* Hans Vanwijn (born 1995), basketball player in the Israeli Basketball Premier League

<text>Lummen (; or &quot;Lumme&quot; ) is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Limburg near Hasselt. On January 1, 2006, Lummen had a total population of 13,691. The total area is 53.38 km2 which gives a population density of 256 inhabitants per km2.

The municipality consists of the following sub-municipalities: Lummen proper, Meldert en Linkhout. In addition, it includes the following hamlets: Geneiken, Genenbos, Gestel, Goeslaar, Groenlaren, Laren, Mellaer, Molem, Oostereinde, Rekhoven, Schalbroek, and Thiewinkel.

Kasteel Lagendal is situated in this municipality.

The historic coat of arms features the crests of the Houses of Arenberg, La Marck and Arrazola de Oñate. In 2008 however, the municipality chose to use a new logo on its official documents instead.

Originally this was an estate (&quot;villa&quot;) of the Prince Bishop of Liège. The core of this (Lummen-Koersel) was one parish until 1180. From the 10th to the 12th centuries, the County of Loon expanded in a northerly direction and seized the villa and the Counts founded an allodium, but in 1203 this area was again transferred to the Prince Bishop and taken on loan. It was given to Lodewijk van Walcourt afterwards. In 1350 Lummen came into possession of the Huis van der Mark-Arenberg. This family remained in possession of the glory until the French period (1794). However, the Dukes of Brabant also claimed to be entitled to a part of Lummen, while the (Loon) lords of Lummen sometimes attempted to found a free state in the area, whereby the Dukes of Brabant tried to sell their rights to these Loon lords several times. . The Heren van Lummen also owned the patronage rights of the parishes in their area, which also included Linkhout and Koersel, and from 1260 also Schulen.

On August 17, 1943, a German fighter plane downed an American B17 bomber of the 94th bomber group over Lummen. The debris of the aircraft ended up in the area of the current Kanadastraat. Six crew members died, two were taken to Germany as prisoners of war and two escaped. A memorial was unveiled on 17 August 2013 in the parking lot of the Oosterhof, near the crash. On February 21, 1945, an Avro Lancaster bomber of the Royal Australian Air Force crashed in the Goeren in Linkhout after being shot by a German night fighter. There was only 1 survivor of the 7 crew members, namely Alex Jenkins, the pilot. There is now a memorial at the site of the crash.

==Etymology==
The first mention of Lummen dates back to 1200, as Lumm. This originates from the Germanic word lom, which means moist.

==Geography==
Lummen is situated at the intersection of various regions: geographically, Lummen exhibits characteristics of the Hageland, Haspengouw, and primarily the Kempen. Throughout the municipality of Lummen, flow the rivers Demer, Mangelbeek, and Zwarte Beek.

<text>Sint-Truiden (; ; ) is a city and municipality located in the province of Limburg, Flemish Region, Belgium. With more than 41,500 inhabitants, it is one of the largest cities in Limburg. 

The municipality includes the former communes (now &quot;deelgemeenten&quot;) of Aalst, Brustem, Duras, Engelmanshoven, Gelinden, Gorsem, Groot-Gelmen, Halmaal, Kerkom-bij-Sint-Truiden, Melveren, Metsteren, Ordingen, Runkelen, Velm, Wilderen, and Zepperen.

The city is in the centre of Belgium&#x27;s fruit-producing region, &quot;Haspengouw&quot; (Hesbaye), which is renowned for its pears, apples (Jonagold), and sweet cherries.

==History==

===Origins and Golden Age===
The municipality developed around an abbey founded in the 7th century by St. Trudo, a Frankish nobleman. Legend has it that as a boy, Trudo was playing, building a small church with some rocks. When a woman scornfully kicked over the rocks, she was struck by sudden blindness. Trudo cured her from this blindness after she asked for his forgiveness. He also allegedly was able to find spring water and cure other illnesses. 

After Trudo&#x27;s death, the abbey (the later Sint-Truiden Abbey) became the centre of a pilgrimage. This brought pilgrims and wealth to the neighbouring town. The 11th century was a particularly prosperous period for the town, where the population grew markedly. 

This was the time when abbot Adelardus, reporting to the prince-bishop of Metz, built the abbey&#x27;s main church and two additional churches in town: Our Lady (&quot;&quot;) and &quot;Sint-Gangulfus&quot;. Under the abbot&#x27;s direction, Sint-Truiden also received an earth wall surmounted by a wooden fence and fortified gates. A proper defensive stone wall, gates and towers, were built in 1129. The economy of this new oppidum city was based on the linen industry. In addition, it traded successfully with such foreign lands as England, Champagne, and Germany.

In the 13th century, the fortified town became one of the 23 &quot;bonnes villes&quot; (main cities) belonging to the Bishopric of Liège. A market hall was built at the site where the current city hall stands, the social life of the city was organized by the various guilds, and a &quot;perron&quot; was erected on the central square, symbolizing the local government&#x27;s authority in political affairs.

===15th century until now===
Charles the Bold captured the town in 1467, marking the beginning of a slow decline that lasted until the 19th century. The city&#x27;s fortifications were dismantled in 1675, and many of the religious congregations were disbanded under the French regime at the end of the 18th century. After 1830, these empty buildings were turned into educational and medical facilities. The city was also the centre of a prosperous agricultural region, which from the end of the 19th century became well known for its fruit production.

It occupied an important strategical position with regard to the N.E. frontier of Belgium, and General Henri Alexis Brialmont recommended its fortification. On 9 August 1914, at the outset of Germany&#x27;s invasion of Belgium, 20 civilians were executed and a number of houses destroyed. The reconstruction and building of brand new neighbourhoods accelerated well into the 20th century.

During World War II, its airfield was the base of one of the most famous Luftwaffe Night Fighter squadron, NJG1, with units II/NJG1 and IV/NJG1 operating Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 219 aircraft from here in 1944. The highest scoring German night fighter pilot, Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer (121 air victories, most of them at night) was referred to as &quot;The spook of St. Trond&quot; by British Bomber crews that flew over Germany on night raids.
The airport EBST is still in use.

==Transport==

===Air===
The airport of Sint-Truiden, Limburg Regional Airport – EBST is PPR. It is a former Belgian Air Force Air Base and retains the long hard 06 – 24 runway, though only 1199 metres (3933 ft) is used.

Fuel (Jet A-1 and Avgas) are available. All is located in hangar 41 (turn right at the end of the runway when taxiing heading 06). Opening hours from 09:00 LT until sunset 7/7. There is also a flight school (airplane and helicopter) Fly One.

There are no scheduled flights.

<text>Tessenderlo (; ) is a municipality in the Belgian province of Limburg. It is where the three Belgian provinces of Limburg, Flemish Brabant and Antwerp meet at the front gate of the Averbode Abbey. The municipality Tessenderlo encompasses the villages of Tessenderlo proper, Schoot, Engsbergen, Hulst and Berg. On January 1, 2006, Tessenderlo had a total population of 16,811. The total area is 51.35 km2 which gives a population density of 327 inhabitants per km2. The name &quot;Tessenderlo&quot; means &quot;(the open place in) the forest of the Taxandrians&quot;.

It is along the Albert Canal and the European route E313, the highway between Antwerp and Liège, one of the reasons it was the place for the first Belgian &quot;Industrial Zone of National Importance&quot; in the 1960s.

Tessenderlo was the scene of an infamous industrial disaster during World War II, when a stock of 150 tonnes of ammonium nitrate at the chemical plant of &quot;Produits Chimiques de Tessenderloo&quot; (now Tessenderlo Group) - located near the centre of town - exploded on April 29, 1942, killing 189 people at the plant and in the town.

Tessenderlo is part of a small western zone of Limburg where the local dialect is not the Limburgian dialect, but Brabantic.

<doc id="175137" wikidata="Q133769" url="?curid=175137" title="Zonhoven">
<text>Zonhoven (; ) is a municipality located in the middle of the Belgian province of Limburg located north of Hasselt and also borders Houthalen-Helechteren, Genk and Heusden-Zolder. It’s an urbanized municipality, in the edge area of Hasselt. The municipality belongs to the On January 1, 2019, Zonhoven had a total population of 21,237. The total area is 39.34 km2 which gives a population density of 506 inhabitants per km2.

Archaeological findings from the period 11,000 BCE to 5,000 BCE, including the only fixed prehistoric polishing stone in Flanders, indicate early inhabitation of the territory. From the Middle Ages to the early modern period, Zonhoven and its neighboring villages belonged to the Land of Vogelsanck. Since the arrival of industry in the 19th and 20th centuries, the municipality has experienced a significant population increase: between 1930 and 1980, the population tripled. Iron ore mining, in particular, played a prominent role in the economy of Zonhoven.

The municipality includes the hamlets Halveweg, Termolen, and Terdonk.

==Toponymy==
The place name &#x27;Zonhoven&#x27; means &#x27;water-rich, low-lying (marsh) land close to or along the watercourse the Son&#x27;
The current name came about partly through folk etymology. At a certain point in history, language users were no longer aware of the original meaning of the old name Sonuwe. They then freely interpreted the name based on its word form (son- sounds like zon- and -uwe sounds somewhat like -hoven), resulting in Zonhoven. To understand the place name, one must listen to the local pronunciation /sōnəvə/ rather than looking at the written form Zonhoven.

The word element &#x27;zon-&#x27; refers to the Son. This is an old name for the Zonderikbeek, a stream that flows through Zonhoven and partially shapes the landscape of the municipality, but which is known to Zonhoven residents as the Roosterbeek. Contrary to common belief, the first part of the place name Zonhoven does not refer to the sun as a star. As a result of this misunderstanding, several businesses, schools, and sports clubs have incorporated the prefixes &#x27;zon-&#x27; or &#x27;sun-&#x27; into their names and depicted the sun or a sundial in their logos. Examples include the primary school De Zonnewijzer, the beer Zonderik, café &#x27;t Zonnehof, and the baseball club Sunville Tigers. The sun is also incorporated into the coat of arms and flag of Zonhoven.
The element &#x27;-hoven&#x27; traces back to &#x27;-ouwe&#x27;, which means &#x27;alluvial land&#x27;. It refers to the valley of the Zonderikbeek. In the past, it was suspected that &#x27;-hoven&#x27; referred to &#x27;hof&#x27;, meaning &#x27;estate&#x27; or &#x27;farm&#x27;. Consequently, &#x27;the farm of the Zon family&#x27; was a possible explanation for the name Zonhoven, but this explanation has since been rejected

== History ==
Zonhoven is a municipality located in the province of Limburg, Belgium. Its history can be traced back to ancient times, with evidence of human activity in the area dating back to the Roman period. The region was likely inhabited by the Tungri, a Germanic tribe that settled in the area during Roman rule.
During the Middle Ages, Zonhoven was part of the County of Loon, a feudal state within the Holy Roman Empire. The village gradually developed around a central church and became a predominantly agricultural community. In the 14th century, Zonhoven fell under the control of the Duchy of Brabant.
The region experienced its share of historical events, including the turbulence of the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648), which had a significant impact on the Low Countries. Like many other Belgian towns, Zonhoven witnessed conflicts and changes in rulership during this period.
On November 18, 1833, the Treaty of Zonhoven was signed in the house named &quot;De Franse Kroon&quot; between representatives of the Netherlands and Belgium to establish special regulations over the use of the river Meuse by the signatories.
The 19th century brought industrialization to Zonhoven, transforming its predominantly agrarian economy. The village expanded, and its population grew as industries such as coal mining and textile production took root in the area. The advent of the railway in the late 19th century further facilitated economic development and connectivity.In the 20th century, Zonhoven, like many European towns, faced the challenges posed by both World Wars. The aftermath of these conflicts saw periods of reconstruction and economic recovery.
Today, Zonhoven stands as a modern municipality with a mix of historical charm and contemporary amenities. Its rich history is evident in its architecture, with some buildings dating back centuries, coexisting with more recent developments. The town continues to evolve, embracing its heritage while adapting to the demands of the present day.

==Demography==
As of January 1, 2019, Zonhoven had a population of 21,237 residents. This makes Zonhoven the thirteenth municipality in the province of Limburg and the 140th municipality in Belgium. The municipality has fewer inhabitants than its neighboring municipalities. Among the four hamlets comprising Zonhoven, the center has the highest population, followed by Termolen.

==Sport== 
The municipality has four amateur football clubs, all playing in provincial divisions: Flandria Termolen, FC Melosport Zonhoven, KFC Halveweg Zonhoven, and Zonhoven VV. The latter played three seasons in the Third Division in the 1970s. In addition to these four clubs affiliated with the KBVB, other amateur teams also play in Zonhoven, including Tuinwijk VV, Weerstand Zonhoven, and FC Wanhoop. Zonhoven is particularly known in the football world for its women&#x27;s football teams. DV Zonhoven played at the national level for a long time in the Second Division until they merged with DV Lanaken in 2012 to form DVL Zonhoven.

In Zonhoven, various sports facilities can be found. The largest is the open-air sports center Basvelden, which houses football club Zonhoven VV, equestrian club Zonnehoef, Zonhoven Athletics Club, tennis club TC Basveld, and baseball and softball club Sunville Tigers. The latter club is active at the highest level in Belgium. Basvelden comprises seven football fields, eight tennis courts with a tennis hall, several beach volleyball courts, two baseball fields, a stable with a covered riding arena, a skate and BMX park, two basketball courts, an athletics track, a petanque court, and a 2,700-meter-long Finnish track. In Halveweg, there is also an open-air sports center with football and tennis fields available for sports clubs. The largest indoor sports facility in Zonhoven is the events hall Den Dijk in the village center. Volleyball clubs Topsport Davozon (women) and VC Helios (men) play their home games there. The latter team played in Liga B for a long time. In addition to this events hall, there are also a sports hall in Terdonk and a sports hall at Windekind primary school in the center. Gymnastics club Olympia is active in all sports halls in the municipality.

==Education==
The municipality has six primary schools. Each of the four parishes is equipped with kindergarten and primary education: &#x27;De Horizon&#x27; in Terdonk, &#x27;De Lettermolen&#x27; in Termolen, &#x27;De St@rtbaan&#x27; in Halveweg, and &#x27;De Zonnewijzer&#x27; in the center. In addition, primary school &#x27;Kosmos&#x27; and Freinet school &#x27;De Toverfluit&#x27; represent community education with each having a kindergarten and primary school. They are also located in the center. Also located in the center of Zonhoven is the kindergarten &#x27;De Kleurdoos.&#x27;
In Zonhoven, secondary education is available at two schools: the Vrije Middenschool (first grade) and the Sint-Jan Berchmansinstituut (second and third grade). The schools work closely together as sister schools. They are located in the center within walking distance of each other and belong to the Scholengemeenschap Sint-Quintinus. Approximately 1,000 students are educated there.

<text>Zutendaal (; ; in English sometimes also referred to as &quot;Sweet Valley&quot;) is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Limburg. On 1 January 2017 Zutendaal had a total population of 7,269. The total area is 32.07 km2, giving a population density of 227 inhabitants per km2.

In addition to Zutendaal itself, the municipality includes the following population centres: Gewaai, Papendaal, Besmer, Broek, Stalken, Roelen, Daal, and Wiemesmeer.

== Etymology ==
The first written mention of Zutendaal was in 1292 under the name of &quot;Suerbroeck&quot;, indicating that the land around the village was acidic and swampy. From 1345 the name changed to &quot;Zuetendael&quot; which literally translates to &quot;Sweet Valley&quot;. Indicating there were a lot of freshwater sources around the village.

== History ==
While the oldest settlements such as Papendaal, Zutendaal, Broek, Stalken and Roelen arose at the respective creek springs, Wiemesmeer, Gewaai and Besmer were founded much later, on the Kempen plateau. The Borough of Besmer was transferred from Lanaken to Zutendaal in the 19th century.

The first church is said to have been founded as early as the 7th century from the Abbey of Munsterbilzen. In 1304, the patronage right was transferred by Count Arnold V of Loon to the Abbey of Averbode. South of the church, around the town square the &quot;Vijverplein&quot;, some remnants of the former village center remain.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, there were many problems with itinerant army bands. In 1598, the church of Zutendaal was set on fire and also later the population had to resort to entrenchments to get to safety from these army bands. In 1790, a battle took place on the hill the Hesselsberg between the Liège revolutionaries and the troops of the Elector of Pfaltz, who supported the Prince-Bishop of Liège.

At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, the heath was afforested for the production of mining wood. In 1938, on the local road Heiwijkerweg, the FN explosives factory was established. In 1944 the Americans built the Zutendaal Air Base. On January 1, 1945 Operation Bodenplatte raged here, which was lost by the Germans. From 1953 a NATO reserve base established itself at the air base.

== Economy and tourism ==
Today Zutendaal is one of the most densely forested municipalities of Flanders, with tourism being a source of income. The community is famous for its barefoot path at the Lieteberg, one of the gateways to the Hoge Kempen National Park which nearly completely surrounds the municipality. Further economic activity can be found in some sand and gravel quarries.

Zutendaal is part of the Albert Canal Economic Network together with 24 other municipalities through which the canal runs.

<doc id="175142" wikidata="Q207315" url="?curid=175142" title="Cremation">
<text>Cremation is a method of final disposition of a dead body through burning.

Cremation may serve as a funeral or post-funeral rite and as an alternative to burial. In some countries, including India, Nepal, and Syria, cremation on an open-air pyre is an ancient tradition. Starting in the 19th century, cremation was introduced or reintroduced into other parts of the world. In modern times, cremation is commonly carried out with a closed furnace (cremator), at a crematorium.

Cremation leaves behind an average of of remains known as &quot;ashes&quot; or &quot;cremains&quot;. This is not all ash but includes unburnt fragments of bone mineral, which are commonly ground into powder. They are inorganic and inert, and thus do not constitute a health risk and may be buried, interred in a memorial site, retained by relatives or scattered in various ways.

==History==
===Ancient===

Cremation dates from at least 17,000 years ago in the archaeological record, with the Mungo Lady, the remains of a partly cremated body found at Lake Mungo, Australia.

Alternative death rituals which emphasize one method of disposal – burial, cremation, or exposure – have gone through periods of preference throughout history.

In the Middle East and Europe, both burial and cremation are evident in the archaeological record in the Neolithic era. Cultural groups had their own preferences and prohibitions. The ancient Egyptians developed an intricate transmigration-of-soul theology, which prohibited cremation. This was also widely adopted by Semitic peoples. The Babylonians, according to Herodotus, embalmed their dead. Phoenicians practiced both cremation and burial. From the Cycladic civilization in 3000 BCE until the Sub-Mycenaean era in 1200–1100 BCE, Greeks practiced burial. Cremation appeared around the 12th century BCE, probably influenced by Anatolia. Until the Christian era, when inhumation again became the only burial practice, both combustion and inhumation had been practiced, depending on the era and location. In Rome&#x27;s earliest history, both inhumation and cremation were in common use among all classes. Around the mid-Republic, inhumation was almost exclusively replaced by cremation, with some notable exceptions, and remained the most common funerary practice until the middle of the Empire, when it was almost entirely replaced by inhumation.

In Europe, there are traces of cremation dating to the Early Bronze Age (c. 2000 BCE) in the Pannonian Plain and along the middle Danube. The custom became dominant throughout Bronze Age Europe with the Urnfield culture (from c. 1300 BCE). In the Iron Age, inhumation again becomes more common, but cremation persisted in the Villanovan culture and elsewhere. Homer&#x27;s account of Patroclus&#x27; burial describes cremation with subsequent burial in a tumulus, similar to Urnfield burials, and qualifying as the earliest description of cremation rites. This may be an anachronism, as during Mycenaean times burial was generally preferred, and Homer may have been reflecting the more common use of cremation at the time the Iliad was written, centuries later.
Criticism of burial rites is a common aspersion by competing religions and cultures, including the association of cremation with fire sacrifice or human sacrifice.
Hinduism and Jainism are notable for not only allowing but prescribing cremation. Cremation in India is first attested in the Cemetery H culture (from c. 1900 BCE), considered the last phase of Indus Valley Civilisation and beginning of the Vedic civilization. The Rigveda contains a reference to the emerging practice, in RV 10.15.14, where the forefathers &quot;both cremated (&quot;agnidagdhá-&quot;) and uncremated (&quot;ánagnidagdha-&quot;)&quot; are invoked.

Cremation remained common but not universal, in both ancient Greece and ancient Rome. According to Cicero, burial was considered the more archaic rite in Rome.

The rise of Christianity saw an end to cremation in Europe, though it may have already been in decline.

In early Roman Britain, cremation was usual but diminished by the 4th century. It then reappeared in the 5th and 6th centuries during the migration era, when sacrificed animals were sometimes included on the pyre, and the dead were dressed in costume and with ornaments for the burning. That custom was also very widespread among the Germanic peoples of the northern continental lands from which the Anglo-Saxon migrants are supposed to have been derived, during the same period. These ashes were usually thereafter deposited in a vessel of clay or bronze in an &quot;urn cemetery&quot;. The custom again died out with the Christian conversion of the Anglo-Saxons or Early English during the 7th century, when Christian burial became general.

===Middle Ages===
In parts of Europe, cremation was forbidden by law, and even punishable by death if combined with Heathen rites. Cremation was sometimes used by Catholic authorities as part of punishment for accused heretics, which included burning at the stake. For example, the body of John Wycliff was exhumed years after his death and burned to ashes, with the ashes thrown in a river, explicitly as a posthumous punishment for his denial of the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation.

The first to advocate for the use of cremation was the physician Sir Thomas Browne in Urne Buriall (1658) which interpreted cremation as means of oblivion and reveals plainly that &quot;&#x27;there is no antidote against the Opium of time...&quot;. Honoretta Brooks Pratt became the first recorded cremated European individual in modern times when she died on 26 September 1769 and was illegally cremated at the burial ground on Hanover Square in London.

===Reintroduction===

In Europe, a movement to reintroduce cremation as a viable method for body disposal began in the 1870s. This was made possible by the invention of new furnace technology and contact with eastern cultures that practiced it. At the time, many proponents believed in the miasma theory, and that cremation would reduce the &quot;bad air&quot; that caused diseases. These movements were associated with secularism and gained a following in cultural and intellectual circles. In Italy, the movement was associated with anti-clericalism and Freemasonry, whereas these were not major themes of the movement in Britain.

In 1869, the idea was presented to the Medical International Congress of Florence by Professors Coletti and Castiglioni &quot;in the name of public health and civilization&quot;. In 1873, Professor Paolo Gorini of Lodi and Professor Ludovico Brunetti of Padua published reports of practical work they had conducted. A model of Brunetti&#x27;s cremating apparatus, together with the resulting ashes, was exhibited at the Vienna Exposition in 1873 and attracted great attention Meanwhile, Sir Charles William Siemens had developed his regenerative furnace in the 1850s. His furnace operated at a high temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, and this process made cremation an efficient and practical proposal. Charles&#x27;s nephew, Carl Friedrich von Siemens perfected the use of this furnace for the incineration of organic material at his factory in Dresden. The radical politician, Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, took the corpse of his dead wife there to be cremated in 1874. The efficient and cheap process brought about the quick and complete incineration of the body and was a fundamental technical breakthrough that finally made industrial cremation a practical possibility.

The first crematorium in the Western World opened in Milan in 1876. Milan&#x27;s &quot;Crematorium Temple&quot; was built in the Monumental Cemetery. The building still stands but ceased to be operational in 1992.
Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet, a surgeon and Physician to the Queen Victoria, had seen Gorini&#x27;s cremator at the Vienna Exhibition and had returned home to become the first and chief promoter of cremation in England. His main reason for supporting cremation was that &quot;it was becoming a necessary sanitary precaution against the propagation of disease among a population daily growing larger in relation to the area it occupied&quot;. In addition, he believed, cremation would prevent premature burial, reduce the expense of funerals, spare mourners the necessity of standing exposed to the weather during interment, and urns would be safe from vandalism. He joined with other proponents to form the &quot;Cremation Society of Great Britain&quot; in 1874.&quot; They founded the United Kingdom&#x27;s first crematorium in Woking, with Gorini travelling to England to assist the installation of a cremator. They first tested it on 17 March 1879 with the body of a horse. After protests and an intervention by the Home Secretary, Sir Richard Cross, their plans were put on hold. In 1884, the Welsh Neo-Druidic priest William Price was arrested and put on trial for attempting to cremate his son&#x27;s body. Price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal. The case set a precedent that allowed the Cremation Society to proceed.

In 1885, the first official cremation in the United Kingdom took place in Woking. The deceased was Jeanette Pickersgill, a well-known figure in literary and scientific circles. By the end of the year, the Cremation Society of Great Britain had overseen 2 more cremations, a total of 3 out of 597,357 deaths in the UK that year. In 1888, 28 cremations took place at the venue. In 1891, Woking Crematorium added a chapel, pioneering the concept of a crematorium being a venue for funerals as well as cremation.
Other early crematoria in Europe were built in 1878 in the town of Gotha in Germany and later in Heidelberg in 1891. The first modern crematory in the U.S. was built in 1876 by Francis Julius LeMoyne after hearing about its use in Europe. Like many early proponents, he was motivated by a belief it would be beneficial for public health. Before LeMoyne&#x27;s crematory closed in 1901, it had performed 42 cremations. Other countries that opened their first crematorium included Sweden (1887 in Stockholm), Switzerland (1889 in Zurich) and France (1889 in Père Lachaise, Paris).

===Western spread===
Some of the various Protestant churches came to accept cremation. In Anglican and Nordic Protestant countries, cremation gained acceptance (though it did not yet become the norm) first by the upper classes and cultural circles, and then by the rest of the population. In 1905, Westminster Abbey interred ashes for the first time; by 1911 the Abbey was expressing a preference for interring ashes. The 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia was critical of the development, referring to them as a &quot;sinister movement&quot; and associating them with Freemasonry, although it said that &quot;there is nothing directly opposed to any dogma of the Church in the practice of cremation.&quot;

In the U.S. only about one crematory per year was built in the late 19th century. As embalming became more widely accepted and used, crematories lost their sanitary edge. Not to be left behind, crematories had an idea of making cremation beautiful. They started building crematories with stained-glass windows and marble floors with frescoed walls.

Australia also started to establish modern cremation movements and societies. Australians had their first purpose-built modern crematorium and chapel in the West Terrace Cemetery in the South Australian capital of Adelaide in 1901. This small building, resembling the buildings at Woking, remained largely unchanged from its 19th-century style and was in full operation until the late 1950s. The oldest operating crematorium in Australia is at Rookwood Cemetery, in Sydney. It opened in 1925.

In the Netherlands, the foundation of the Association for Optional Cremation in 1874 ushered in a long debate about the merits and demerits of cremation. Laws against cremation were challenged and invalidated in 1915 (two years after the construction of the first crematorium in the Netherlands), though cremation did not become legally recognised until 1955.

=== World War II ===

During World War II (1939–45), Nazi Germany used specially built furnaces in at least six extermination camps throughout occupied Poland including at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Chełmno, Belzec, Majdanek, Sobibor and Treblinka, where the bodies of those murdered by gassing were disposed of using incineration. The efficiency of industrialised killing of &quot;Operation Reinhard&quot; during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust produced too many corpses, therefore the crematoria manufactured to SS specifications were put into use in all of them to handle the disposals around the clock, day and night. The Vrba–Wetzler report offers the following description. 
The Holocaust furnaces were supplied by a number of manufacturers, with the best known and most common being Topf and Sons as well as Kori Company of Berlin, whose ovens were elongated to accommodate two bodies, slid inside from the back side. The ashes were taken out from the front side.

=== Modern era ===

In the 20th century, cremation gained varying degrees of acceptance in most Christian denominations. William Temple, the most senior bishop in the Church of England, was cremated after his death in office in 1944. The Roman Catholic Church accepted the practice more slowly. In 1963, at the Second Vatican Council Pope Paul VI lifted the ban on cremation, and in 1966 allowed Catholic priests to officiate at cremation ceremonies. This is done on the condition that the ashes must be buried or interred, not scattered. Many countries where burial is traditional saw cremation rise to become a significant, if not the most common way of disposing of a dead body. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was an unprecedented phase of crematorium construction in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

Starting in the 1960s, cremation has become more common than burial in several countries where the latter is traditional. This has included the United Kingdom (1968), Czechoslovakia (1980), Canada (early 2000s), the United States (2016) and Finland (2017). Factors cited include cheaper costs (especially a factor after the 2008 recession), growth in secular attitudes and declining opposition in some Christian denominations.

== Modern process ==

The cremation occurs in a cremator, which is located at a &quot;crematorium&quot; or &quot;crematory&quot;. In many countries, the crematorium is a venue for funerals as well as cremation.

A cremator is an industrial furnace that is able to generate temperatures of to ensure the disintegration of the corpse. Modern cremator fuels include oil, natural gas, propane, and, in Hong Kong, coal gas. Modern cremators automatically monitor their interior to tell when the cremation process is complete and have a spyhole so that an operator can see inside. The time required for cremation varies from body to body, with the average being 90 minutes for an adult body.

The chamber where the body is placed is called a &quot;cremation chamber&quot; or &quot;retort&quot; and is lined with heat-resistant refractory bricks. Refractory bricks are designed in several layers. The outermost layer is usually simply an insulation material, &quot;e.g.&quot;, mineral wool. Inside is typically a layer of insulation brick, mostly calcium silicate in nature. Heavy duty cremators are usually designed with two layers of fire bricks inside the insulation layer. The layer of fire bricks in contact with the combustion process protects the outer layer and must be replaced from time to time.

The body is generally required to be inside a coffin or a combustible container. This allows the body to be quickly and safely slid into the cremator. It also reduces health risks to the operators. The coffin or container is inserted (charged) into the cremator as quickly as possible to avoid heat loss. Some crematoria allow relatives to view the charging. This is sometimes done for religious reasons, such as in traditional Hindu and Jain funerals, and is also customary in Japan.

=== Body container ===
In the United States federal law does not dictate any container requirements for cremation. Certain states require an opaque or non-transparent container for all cremations. This can be a simple corrugated cardboard box or a wooden casket (coffin). Another option is a cardboard box that fits inside a wooden shell, which is designed to look like a traditional casket. After the funeral service, the box is removed from the shell before cremation, permitting the shell to be re-used.

In the United Kingdom, the body is not removed from the coffin and is not placed into a container as described above. The body is cremated with the coffin which is why all British coffins that are to be used for cremation must be combustible. The Code of Cremation Practice forbids the opening of the coffin once it has arrived at the crematorium, and rules stipulate that it must be cremated within 72 hours of the funeral service. Therefore, in the United Kingdom, bodies are cremated in the same coffin that they are placed in at the undertaker&#x27;s, although the regulations allow the use of an approved &quot;cover&quot; during the funeral service. It is recommended that jewellery be removed before the coffin is sealed, for this reason. When cremation is finished, the remains are passed through a magnetic field to remove any metal, which will be interred elsewhere in the crematorium grounds or, increasingly, recycled. The ashes are entered into a cremulator to further grind the remains down into a finer texture before being given to relatives or loved ones or scattered in the crematorium grounds where facilities exist.

In Germany, the process is mostly similar to that of the United Kingdom. The body is cremated in the coffin. A piece of fire clay with a number on it is used for identifying the remains of the dead body after burning. The remains are then placed in a container called an &quot;ash capsule&quot;, which generally is put into a cinerary urn.

In Australia, reusable or cardboard coffins are rare, with only a few manufacturers now supplying them. For low cost, a plain, particle-board coffin (known in the trade as a &quot;chippie&quot;, &quot;shipper&quot; or &quot;pyro&quot;) can be used. Handles (if fitted) are plastic and approved for use in a cremator.

Cremations can be &quot;delivery only&quot;, with no preceding chapel service at the crematorium (although a church service may have been held) or preceded by a service in one of the crematorium chapels. Delivery-only allows crematoria to schedule cremations to make best use of the cremators, perhaps by holding the body overnight in a refrigerator, allowing a lower fee to be charged.

=== Burning and ash collection ===

The box containing the body is placed in the retort and incinerated at a temperature of . During the cremation process, the greater portion of the body (especially the organs and other soft tissues) is vaporized and oxidized by the intense heat; gases released are discharged through the exhaust system.

Jewelry, such as necklaces, wrist-watches and rings, are ordinarily removed before cremation, and returned to the family. Several implanted devices are required to be removed. Pacemakers and other medical devices can cause large, dangerous explosions.

Contrary to popular belief, the cremated remains are not ashes in the usual sense. After the incineration is completed, the dry bone fragments are swept out of the retort and pulverised by a machine called a &quot;Cremulator&quot;—essentially a high-capacity, high-speed Pulverizer —to process them into &quot;ashes&quot; or &quot;cremated remains&quot;, although pulverisation may also be performed by hand. This leaves the bone with a fine sand like texture and color, able to be scattered without need for mixing with any foreign matter, though the size of the grain varies depending on the Cremulator used. The mean weight of an adult&#x27;s remains is ; the mean weight for adult males is about higher than that for adult females. There are various types of Cremulators, including rotating devices, grinders, and older models using heavy metal balls.
The grinding process typically takes about 20 seconds.
In most Asian countries, the bones are not pulverised, unless requested beforehand. When not pulverised, the bones are collected by the family and stored as one might do with ashes.

The appearance of cremated remains after grinding is one of the reasons they are called &quot;ashes&quot;, although a non-technical term sometimes used is &quot;cremains&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;cremated&quot; and &quot;remains&quot;. (The Cremation Association of North America prefers that the word &quot;cremains&quot; not be used for referring to &quot;human cremated remains&quot;. The reason given is that &quot;cremains&quot; is thought to have less connection with the deceased, whereas a loved one&#x27;s &quot;cremated remains&quot; has a more identifiable human connection.)

After final grinding, the ashes are placed in a container, which can be anything from a simple cardboard box to a decorative urn. The default container used by most crematoria, when nothing more expensive has been selected, is usually a hinged, snap-locking plastic box.

=== Ash weight and composition ===

Cremated remains are mostly dry calcium phosphates with some minor minerals, such as salts of sodium and potassium. Sulfur and most carbon are driven off as oxidized gases during the process, although about 1–4% of carbon remains as carbonate.

The ash remaining represents very roughly 3.5% of the body&#x27;s original mass (2.5% in children). Because the weight of dry bone fragments is so closely connected to skeletal mass, their weight varies greatly from person to person. Because many changes in body composition (such as fat and muscle loss or gain) do not affect the weight of cremated remains, the weight of the remains can be more closely predicted from the person&#x27;s height and sex (which predicts skeletal weight), than it can be predicted from the person&#x27;s simple weight.

Ashes of adults can be said to weigh from , with women&#x27;s ashes generally weighing below and men&#x27;s ashes generally weighing above .

Bones are not all that remain after cremation. There may be melted metal lumps from missed jewellery; casket furniture; dental fillings; and surgical implants, such as hip replacements. Breast implants do not have to be removed before cremation. Some medical devices such as pacemakers may need to be removed before cremation to avoid the risk of explosion. Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground.) Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous scrap metal. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as &quot;gleanings&quot;) are sieved out and may be later interred in common, consecrated ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious metal scrap.

== Retention or disposal of remains ==

Cremated remains are returned to the next of kin in different manners according to custom and country. In the United States, the cremated remains are almost always contained in a thick watertight polyethylene plastic bag contained within a hard snap-top rectangular plastic container, which is labeled with a printed paper label. The basic sealed plastic container bag may be contained within a further cardboard box or velvet sack, or they may be contained within an urn if the family had already purchased one. An official certificate of cremation prepared under the authority of the crematorium accompanies the remains, and if required by law, the permit for disposition of human remains, which must remain with the cremated remains.

Cremated remains can be kept in an urn, stored in a special memorial building (columbarium), buried in the ground at many locations or sprinkled on a special field, mountain, or in the sea. In addition, there are several services in which the cremated remains will be scattered in a variety of ways and locations. Some examples are via a helium balloon, through fireworks, shot from shotgun shells, by boat or scattered from an aeroplane or drone. One service sends a lipstick-tube sized sample of the cremated remains into low earth orbit, where they remain for years (but not permanently) before reentering the atmosphere. Some companies offer a service to turn part of the cremated remains into synthetic diamonds which can then be made into jewelry. This &quot;cremation jewelry&quot; is also known as funeral jewelry, remembrance jewelry or memorial jewelry. A portion of the cremated remains may be retained in a specially designed locket known as cremation jewelry, or even blown into special glass keepsakes and glass orbs

Cremated remains may also be incorporated, with urn and cement, into part of an artificial reef, or they can also be mixed into paint and made into a portrait of the deceased. Some individuals use a very small amount of the remains in tattoo ink, for remembrance portraits. Cremated remains can be scattered in national parks in the United States with a special permit. They can also be scattered on private property with the permission of the owner. The cremated remains may also be entombed. Most cemeteries will grant permission for burial of cremated remains in occupied cemetery plots that have already been purchased or are in use by the families disposing of the cremated remains without any additional charge or oversight.

Ashes are alkaline. In some areas such as Snowdon, Wales, environmental authorities have warned that the frequent scattering of ashes can change the nature of the soil, and may affect the ecology.

The final disposition depends on the personal preferences of the deceased as well as their cultural and religious beliefs. Some religions will permit the cremated remains to be sprinkled or retained at home. Some religions, such as Roman Catholicism, prefer to either bury or entomb the remains. Hinduism obliges the closest male relative (son, grandson, etc.) of the deceased to immerse the cremated remains in the holy river Ganges, preferably at one of the holy cities Triveni Sangam, Allahabad, Varanasi, or Haridwar in India. The Sikhs immerse the remains in the Sutlej, usually at Kiratpur Sahib. In southern India, the ashes are immersed in the river Kaveri at Paschima vahini in Srirangapattana at a stretch where the river flows from east to west, depicting the life of a human being from sunrise to sunset. In Japan and Taiwan, the remaining bone fragments are given to the family and are used in a burial ritual before final interment.

==Reasons==

Aside from religious reasons (discussed below), some people find they prefer cremation over traditional burial for personal reasons. The thought of a long and slow decomposition process is unappealing to some; many people find that they prefer cremation because it disposes of the body relatively quickly.

Other people view cremation as a way of simplifying their funeral process. These people view a traditional ground burial as an unneeded complication of their funeral process, and thus choose cremation to make their services as simple as possible. Cremation is a more simple disposition method to plan than a burial funeral. This is because with a burial funeral one would have to plan for more transportation services for the body as well as embalming and other body preservation methods. With a burial funeral one will also have to purchase a casket, headstone, grave plot, opening and closing of the grave fee, and mortician fees. Cremation funerals only require planning the transportation of the body to a crematorium, cremation of the body, and a cremation urn.

The cost factor tends to make cremation attractive. Generally speaking, cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service, especially if direct cremation (also known as bare cremation) is chosen, in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services. For some, even cremation is still relatively expensive, especially as a lot of fuel is required to perform it. Methods to reduce fuel consumption/fuel cost include the use of different fuels (i.e. natural gas or propane, compared to wood) and by using an incinerator (retort) (closed cabin) rather than an open fire.

For surviving kin, cremation is preferred because of simple portability. Survivors relocating to another city or country have the option of transporting the remains of their loved ones with the ultimate goal of being interred or scattered together.

== Environmental impact ==
Despite being an obvious source of carbon emissions, cremation does have environmental advantages over burial, depending on local practice. Studies by Elisabeth Keijzer for the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Research found that cremation has less of an environmental impact than a traditional burial (the study did not address natural burials), while the newer method of alkaline hydrolysis (sometimes called &quot;green cremation&quot; or &quot;resomation&quot;) had less impact than both. The study was based on Dutch practice; American crematoria are more likely to emit mercury, but are less likely to burn hardwood coffins. Keijzer&#x27;s studies also found that a cremation or burial accounts for only about a quarter of a funeral&#x27;s environmental impact; the carbon emissions of people travelling to the funeral are far greater.

Each cremation requires about of fuel and releases about of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus, the roughly 1 million bodies that are cremated annually in the United States produce about of carbon dioxide, which is more CO2 pollution than 22,000 average American homes generate in a year. The environmental impact may be reduced by using cremators for longer periods, and relaxing the requirement for a cremation to take place on the same day that the coffin is received, which reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence carbon emissions. Cremation is therefore becoming more friendly toward the environment. Some funeral and crematorium owners offer a carbon neutral funeral service incorporating efficient-burning coffins made from lightweight recycled composite board.

Burial is a known source of certain environmental contaminants, with the major ones being formaldehyde and the coffin itself. Cremation can also release contaminants, such as mercury from dental fillings. In some countries such as the United Kingdom, the law now requires that cremators be fitted with abatement equipment (filters) that remove serious pollutants such as mercury.

Another environmental concern is that traditional burial takes up a great deal of space. In a traditional burial, the body is buried in a casket made from a variety of materials. In the United States, the casket is often placed inside a concrete vault or liner before burial in the ground. While individually this may not take much room, combined with other burials, it can over time cause serious space concerns. Many cemeteries, particularly in Japan and Europe as well as those in larger cities, have run out of permanent space. In Tokyo, for example, traditional burial plots are extremely scarce and expensive, and in London, a space crisis led Harriet Harman to propose reopening old graves for &quot;double-decker&quot; burials. Some cities in Germany do not have plots for sale, only for lease. When the lease expires, the remains are disinterred and a specialist bundles the bones, inscribes the forehead of the skull with the information that was on the headstone, and places the remains in a special crypt. In Singapore, cremation is preferred by most Singaporeans because burial there is limited to 15 years.

== Religious views ==
=== Christianity ===
In Christian countries and cultures, cremation has historically been discouraged and viewed as a desecration of God&#x27;s image, and as interference with the resurrection of the dead taught in Scripture. It is now acceptable to some denominations, since a literal interpretation of Scripture is less common in modern reformist traditions.

==== Catholicism ====
Christians preferred to bury the dead rather than to cremate the remains, as was common in Roman culture. The early church carried on Judaism&#x27;s respect for the human body as being created in God&#x27;s image, and followed their practices of speedy interment, in hopes of the future resurrection of all dead. The Roman catacombs and Medieval veneration of relics of Roman Catholic saints witness to this preference. For them, the body was not a mere receptacle for a spirit that was the real person, but an integral part of the human person. They looked on the body as sanctified by the sacraments and itself the temple of the Holy Spirit, and thus requiring to be disposed of in a way that honours and reveres it, and they saw many early practices involved with disposal of dead bodies as pagan in origin or an insult to the body.

The idea that cremation might interfere with God&#x27;s ability to resurrect the body was refuted by the 2nd-century &quot;Octavius&quot; of Minucius Felix, in which he said: &quot;Every body, whether it is dried up into dust, or is dissolved into moisture, or is compressed into ashes, or is attenuated into smoke, is withdrawn from us, but it is reserved for God in the custody of the elements. Nor, as you believe, do we fear any loss from sepulture, but we adopt the ancient and better custom of burying in the earth.&quot; A similar practice of boiling to remove flesh from bones was also punished with excommunication in a 1300 decree of Pope Boniface VIII. And while there was a clear and prevailing preference for burial, there was no general Church law forbidding cremation until 1866. In Medieval Europe, cremation was practiced mainly in situations where there were multitudes of corpses simultaneously present, such as after a battle, after a pestilence or famine, and where there was an imminent fear of diseases spreading from the corpses, since individual burials with digging graves would take too long and body decomposition would begin before all the corpses had been interred.

Beginning in the Middle Ages, and even more so in the 18th century and later, non-Christian rationalists and classicists began to advocate cremation again as a statement denying the resurrection and/or the afterlife, although the pro-cremation movement often took care to address these concerns. Sentiment within the Catholic Church against cremation became hardened in the face of the association of cremation with &quot;professed enemies of God.&quot; When Masonic groups advocated cremation as a means of rejecting Christian belief in the resurrection, the Holy See forbade Catholics to practise cremation in 1886. The 1917 Code of Canon Law incorporated this ban. In 1963, recognizing that, in general, cremation was being sought for practical purposes and not as a denial of bodily resurrection, the choice of cremation was permitted in some circumstances. The current 1983 Code of Canon Law, states: &quot;The Church earnestly recommends the pious custom of Christian burial be retained; but it does not entirely forbid cremation, except if this is chosen for reasons which are contrary to Christian teaching.&quot;

There are no universal rules governing Catholic funeral rites in connection with cremation, but episcopal conferences have laid down rules for various countries. Of these, perhaps the most elaborate are those established, with the necessary confirmation of the Holy See, by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and published as Appendix II of the United States edition of the &quot;Order of Christian Funerals&quot;.

Although the Holy See has in some cases authorized bishops to grant permission for funeral rites to be carried out in the presence of cremated remains, it is preferred that the rites be carried out in the presence of a still intact body. Practices that show insufficient respect for the ashes of the dead such as turning them into jewelry or scattering them are forbidden for Catholics, but burial on land or sea or enclosing in a niche or columbarium is now acceptable.

====Anglicanism and Lutheranism====
In 1917, &quot;Volume 6 of the American Lutheran Survey&quot; stated that &quot;The Lutheran clergy as a rule refuse&quot; and that &quot;Episcopal pastors often take a stand against it.&quot; Indeed, in the 1870s, the Anglican Bishop of London stated that the practice of cremation would &quot;undermine the faith of mankind in the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, hasten rejection of a Scriptural worldview and so bring about a most disastrous social revolution.&quot; In &quot;The Lutheran Pastor&quot;, George Henry Gerberding stated:

Some Protestant churches welcomed the use of cremation at a much earlier date than the Catholic Church; pro-cremation sentiment was not unanimous among Protestants, as some have retained a literal interpretation of Scripture. The first crematoria in the Protestant countries were built in the 1870s, and in 1908, the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey—one of the most famous Anglican churches—required that remains be cremated for burial in the abbey&#x27;s precincts. Today, &quot;scattering&quot;, or &quot;strewing,&quot; is an acceptable practice in some Protestant denominations, and some churches have their own &quot;garden of remembrance&quot; on their grounds in which remains can be scattered. Some denominations, like Lutheran churches in Scandinavia, favour the urns being buried in family graves. A family grave can thus contain urns of many generations and also the urns of spouses and loved ones.

==== Methodism ====
An 1898 Methodist tract titled &quot;Immortality and Resurrection&quot; noted that &quot;burial is the result of a belief in the resurrection of the body, while cremation anticipates its annihilation.&quot; &quot;The Methodist Review&quot; noted in 1874 that &quot;Three thoughts alone would lead us to suppose that the early Christians would have special care for their dead, namely, the essential Jewish origin of the Church; the mode of burial of their founder; and the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, so powerfully urged by the apostles, and so mighty in its influence on the primitive Christians. From these considerations, the Roman custom of cremation would be most repulsive to the Christian mind.&quot;

Since at least 1992, the United Methodist Church does not have a specific official statement that either endorses or condemns cremation, leaving the choice to individuals and families. Resources within the official ritual refer to the possible use of an urn and the interment of ashes.

==== Eastern Orthodox and other opposition ====
Some branches of Christianity entirely oppose cremation, including non-mainstream Protestant groups and the Orthodox churches. The Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches forbid cremation. Exceptions are made for circumstances where it cannot be avoided (when civil authority demands it, in aftermath of war or during epidemics) or if it may be sought for good cause, such as the discovery of body already in the state of decomposition. But when a cremation is specifically and willfully chosen for no good cause by the one who is deceased, he or she is not permitted a funeral in the church and may also be permanently excluded from burial in a Christian cemetery and liturgical prayers for the departed. In Orthodoxy, cremation is perceived as a rejection of the temple of God and of the dogma of the general resurrection.

Most independent Bible churches, free churches, Holiness churches and those of Anabaptist faiths will not practice cremation. As one example, the Church of God (Restoration) forbids the practice of cremation, believing as the Early Church did, that it continues to be a pagan practice.

====Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has, in past decades, discouraged cremation without expressly forbidding it. In the 1950s, for example, Apostle Bruce R. McConkie wrote that &quot;only under the most extraordinary and unusual circumstances&quot; would cremation be consistent with LDS teachings.

More recent LDS publications have provided instructions for how to dress the deceased when they have received their temple endowments (and thus wear temple garments) prior to cremation for those wishing to do so, or in countries where the law requires cremation. Except where required by law, the family of the deceased may decide whether the body should be cremated, though the Church &quot;does not normally encourage cremation.&quot;

=== Hinduism ===
Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism practice cremation. The founder of Buddhism, the Buddha, was cremated.

A dead adult Hindu is mourned with a cremation, while a dead child is typically buried. The rite of passage is performed in harmony with the Hindu religious view that the microcosm of all living beings is a reflection of a macrocosm of the universe. The soul (Atman, Brahman) is the essence and immortal that is released at the &quot;Antyesti&quot; ritual, but both the body and the universe are vehicles and transitory in various schools of Hinduism. They consist of five elements – air, water, fire, earth, and space. The last rite of passage returns the body to the five elements and origins. The roots of this belief are found in the Vedas, for example in the hymns of Rigveda in section 10.16, as follows:

The final rite in the case of untimely death of a child is usually not cremation but a burial. This is rooted in Rigveda&#x27;s section 10.18, where the hymns mourn the death of the child, praying to deity Mrityu to &quot;neither harm our girls nor our boys&quot;, and pleads the earth to cover, protect the deceased child as a soft wool.

Ashes of the cremated bodies are usually spread in rivers, which are considered holy in the Hindu practice. The Ganges is considered to be the holiest river, and Varanasi, situated on the banks of the river, is regarded as the most sacred site for cremation.

==== Balinese ====

Balinese Hindu dead are generally buried inside the container for a period of time, which may exceed one month or more, so that the cremation ceremony (Ngaben) can occur on an auspicious day in the Balinese-Javanese Calendar system (&quot;Saka&quot;). Additionally, if the departed was a court servant, member of the court or minor noble, the cremation can be postponed up to several years to coincide with the cremation of their Prince. Balinese funerals are very expensive and the body may be interred until the family can afford it or until there is a group funeral planned by the village or family when costs will be less. The purpose of burying the corpse is for the decay process to consume the fluids of the corpse, which allows for an easier, more rapid and more complete cremation.

=== Islam ===

Most Muslims believe Islam strictly forbids cremation. Its teaching is that cremation is not in line with the respect and dignity due to the deceased. They believe Islam has specific rites for the treatment of the body after death.

=== Judaism ===

The first reference to cremation in the Hebrew Bible is found in 1 Samuel 31. In this passage, the dead bodies of Saul and his sons are burned, and their bones are buried.

Judaism has traditionally disapproved of cremation in the past, as a rejection of the respect due to humans who are created in the image of God. Judaism has also disapproved of preservation of the dead by means of embalming and mummifying, as this involves mutilation and abuse of the corpse. Mummification was a practice of the ancient Egyptians, among whom the Israelites are said in the Torah to have lived as slaves.

Through history and up to the philosophical movements of the current era Modern Orthodox, Orthodox, Haredi, and Hasidic movements in Judaism have maintained the historical practice and strict Biblical line against cremation and disapprove of it, as Halakha (Jewish law) forbids it. This halakhic concern is grounded in the literal interpretation of Scripture, viewing the body as created in the image of God and upholding a bodily resurrection as core beliefs of traditional Judaism. This interpretation was occasionally opposed by some Jewish groups such as the Sadducees, who denied resurrection. The Tanakh emphasizes burial as the normal practice, for instance Devarim (Deuteronomy) 21:23 (specifically commanding the burial of executed criminals), with both a positive command derived from this verse to command one to bury a dead body and a negative command forbidding neglecting to bury a dead body. Some from the generally liberal Conservative Jewish also oppose cremation, some very strongly, seeing it as a rejection of God&#x27;s design.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, as the Jewish cemeteries in many European towns had become crowded and were running out of space, in a few cases cremation for the first time became an approved means of corpse disposal among emerging liberal and Reform Jewish movements in line with their general rejection of literal scripture interpretation and traditional Torah ritual laws. Current liberal movements like Reform Judaism still permit cremation, although burial remains the preferred option. The Central Conference of American Rabbis has issued a responsa stating that families are permitted to choose cremation, but Reform rabbis are allowed to discourage the practice. However, Reform rabbis are instructed not to refuse to officiate at cremations.

In Israel religious ritual events including free burial and funeral services for all who die in Israel and all citizens including the majority Jewish population including for the secular or non-observant are almost universally facilitated through the Rabbinate of Israel. This is an Orthodox organization following historical and traditional Jewish law. In Israel there were no formal crematories until 2004 when B&amp;L Cremation Systems Inc. became the first crematory manufacturer to sell a retort to Israel. In August 2007, an orthodox youth group in Israel was accused of burning down the country&#x27;s sole crematorium, which they see as an affront to God. The crematorium was rebuilt by its owner and the retort replaced.

===Baháʼí Faith===
The Baháʼí Faith forbids cremation. A letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National Spiritual Assembly states, &quot;He feels that, in view of what &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá has said against cremation, the believers should be strongly urged, as an act of faith, to make provisions against their remains being cremated. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh has laid down as a law, in the Aqdas, the manner of Baháʼí burial, and it is so beautiful, befitting and dignified, that no believer should deprive himself of it.&quot;

===Wicca===
Both burial and cremation are practiced by Wiccans and there is no set directive on how the body should be disposed of after death. Wiccans believe that the body is merely a shell for the spirit so cremation is not viewed as irreverent or disrespectful. One tradition practiced by Wiccans is to mix the ashes from cremation with soil which is then used to plant a tree.

===Zoroastrianism===
Traditionally, Zoroastrianism disavows cremation or burial to preclude pollution of fire or earth. The traditional method of corpse disposal is through ritual exposure in a &quot;Tower of Silence&quot;, but both burial and cremation are increasingly popular alternatives. Some contemporary adherents of the faith have opted for cremation. Parsi-Zoroastrian singer Freddie Mercury of the group Queen was cremated after his death.

===Chinese===
Neo-Confucianism under Zhu Xi strongly discourages cremation of one&#x27;s parents&#x27; corpses as unfilial. Han Chinese traditionally practiced burial and viewed cremation as taboo and as a barbarian practice.

Traditionally, only Buddhist monks in China practiced cremation because ordinary Han Chinese detested cremation, refusing to do it. But now, the atheist Communist party enforces a strict cremation policy. Exceptions are made for Hui who do not cremate their dead due to Islamic beliefs.

The minority Jurchen and their Manchu descendants originally practiced cremation as part of their culture. They adopted the practice of burial from the Han, but many Manchus continued to cremate their dead.

==Pets==
In Japan, more than 465 companion animal temples are in operation. These venues hold funerals and rituals for dead pets. In Australia, pet owners can purchase services to have their companion animal cremated and placed in a pet cemetery or taken home.

The cost of pet cremation depends on location, where the cremation is done, and time of cremation. The American Humane Society&#x27;s cost for the cremation of a pet weighing under 22.5 kg (50 lb) costs $110, while a pet weighing over 23 kg (51 lb) is $145. The cremated remains are available for the owner to pick up in seven to ten business days. Urns for the companion animal range from $50 to $150.

Though pet cremation has accelerated in recent years, Americans are still burying their pets by a 2:1 ratio.

==Recent controversies==
===Tri-State Crematory incident===
In early 2002, 334 corpses that were supposed to have been cremated in the previous few years at the Tri-State Crematory were found intact and decaying on the crematorium&#x27;s grounds in the U.S. state of Georgia, having been dumped there by the crematorium&#x27;s proprietor. Many of the corpses were decayed beyond identification. Some families received &quot;ashes&quot; that were made of wood and concrete dust.

Operator Ray Brent Marsh had 787 criminal charges filed against him. On 19 November 2004, Marsh pleaded guilty to all charges. Marsh was sentenced to two 12-year prison sentences, one each from Georgia and Tennessee, to be served concurrently; he was also sentenced to probation for 75 years following his incarceration.

Civil suits were filed against the Marsh family and a number of funeral homes who shipped bodies to Tri-State; these suits were ultimately settled. The property of the Marsh family has been sold, but collection of the full $80-million judgment remains doubtful.

==Rates==
The cremation rate varies considerably across countries with Japan reporting a 99.97% cremation rate while Romania reported a rate of 0.5% in 2018. The cremation rate in the United Kingdom has been increasing steadily with the national average rate rising from 34.70% in 1960 to 78.10% in 2019. According to the National Funeral Directors Association, the cremation rate in the United States in 2016 was 50.2% and this was in 2017 expected to increase to 63.8% by 2025 and 78.8% in 2035.

<doc id="175143" wikidata="Q44258" url="?curid=175143" title="Basil of Caesarea">
<text>Basil of Caesarea, also called Saint Basil the Great (, &quot;Hágios Basíleios ho Mégas&quot;; , &quot;Piagios Basílios&quot;; 330 – 1 or 2 January 379), was an early Roman Christian prelate who served as Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia from 370 until his death in 379. He was an influential theologian who supported the Nicene Creed and opposed the heresies of the early Christian church, fighting against both Arianism and the followers of Apollinaris of Laodicea.

In addition to his work as a theologian, Basil was known for his care of the poor and underprivileged. Basil established guidelines for monastic life which focus on community life, liturgical prayer, and manual labor. Together with Pachomius, he is remembered as a father of communal monasticism in Eastern Christianity. He is considered a saint by the traditions of both Eastern and Western Christianity.

Basil, together with his brother Gregory of Nyssa and his friend Gregory of Nazianzus, are collectively referred to as the Cappadocian Fathers. The Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches have given him, together with Gregory of Nazianzus and John Chrysostom, the title of Great Hierarch. He is recognized as a Doctor of the Church in the Roman Catholic Church. He is sometimes referred to by the epithet &quot;Ouranophantor&quot; (Greek: ), &quot;revealer of heavenly mysteries&quot;.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Basil was born into the wealthy Cappadocian Greek family of Basil the Elder, and Emmelia of Caesarea, in Cappadocia, around 330. He was one of ten children, and his parents were known for their piety. His maternal grandfather was a Christian martyr, executed in the years prior to Constantine I&#x27;s conversion. His pious paternal grandmother, Macrina, a follower of Gregory Thaumaturgus (who had founded the nearby church of Neocaesarea), raised Basil and four of his siblings who also are now venerated as saints: Macrina the Younger, Naucratius, Peter of Sebaste, and Gregory of Nyssa.

Basil received more formal education in Caesarea Mazaca in Cappadocia (modern Kayseri) around 350–51. There he met Gregory of Nazianzus. Gregory went to Alexandria, while Basil went to Constantinople for further studies, including the lectures of Libanius. The two later met again in Athens and became fast friends. There they met a fellow student who would become the emperor Julian the Apostate. Basil left Athens in 356, and after travels in Egypt and Syria, he returned to Caesarea. For around a year he practiced law and taught rhetoric.

Basil&#x27;s life changed radically after he encountered Eustathius of Sebaste, a charismatic bishop and ascetic. Abandoning his legal and teaching career, Basil devoted his life to God. In a letter, he described his spiritual awakening:
===Annesi===
After his baptism, Basil travelled in 357 to Palestine, Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia to study ascetics and monasticism. Eustathius of Sebaste, a prominent anchorite near Pontus, mentored Basil. Basil distributed his fortunes among the poor and went briefly into solitude near Neocaesarea of Pontus (modern Niksar), on the Iris River. He eventually realized that, while he respected the ascetics&#x27; piety and prayerfulness, the solitary life did not call him. He and Eustathius also eventually differed over dogma.

Basil instead felt drawn toward communal religious life, and by 358 he was gathering around him a group of like-minded disciples, including his brother Peter. Together they founded a monastic settlement on his family&#x27;s estate near Annesi (modern Sonusa or Uluköy, near the confluence of the Iris and Lycos rivers). His widowed mother Emmelia, sister Macrina, and several other women, joined Basil and devoted themselves to pious lives of prayer and charitable works (some claim Macrina founded this community).

Here Basil wrote about monastic communal life. His writings became pivotal in developing monastic traditions of the Eastern Church. In 358, Basil invited his friend Gregory of Nazianzus to join him in Annesi. When Gregory eventually arrived, they collaborated on &quot;Origen&#x27;s Philocalia&quot;, a collection of Origen&#x27;s works. Gregory decided to return to his family in Nazianzus.

Basil attended the Council of Constantinople (360). He at first sided with Eustathius and the Homoiousians, a semi-Arian faction who taught that the Son was of &quot;like&quot; substance with the Father, neither the same (&quot;one&quot; substance) nor different from him. The Homoiousians opposed the Arianism of Eunomius but refused to join with the supporters of the Nicene Creed, who professed that the members of the Trinity were of one substance (&quot;homoousios&quot;). However, Basil&#x27;s bishop, Dianius of Caesarea, had subscribed only to the earlier Nicene form of agreement. Basil eventually abandoned the Homoiousians, and emerged instead as a strong supporter of the Nicene Creed. His ability to balance his theological convictions with his political connections made Basil a powerful advocate for the Nicene position.

===Caesarea===
In 362, Bishop Meletius of Antioch ordained Basil as a deacon. Eusebius then summoned Basil to Caesarea and ordained him as presbyter of the Church there in 365. Eusebius needed him as an assistant because of his intellectual gifts. Ecclesiastical entreaties rather than Basil&#x27;s desires thus altered his career path.

Basil and Gregory Nazianzus spent the next few years combatting the Arian heresy, which threatened to divide Cappadocia&#x27;s Christians. In close fraternal cooperation, they agreed to a great rhetorical contest with accomplished Arian theologians and rhetors. In the subsequent public debates, presided over by agents of Valens, Gregory and Basil emerged triumphant. This success confirmed for both Gregory and Basil that their futures lay in the administration of the Church. Basil next took on functional administration of the city of Caesarea. Eusebius is reported to have been jealous of Basil&#x27;s quickly developed reputation and influence. He allowed Basil to return to his earlier solitude. Later, however, Gregory persuaded him to return, and Basil became the administrator for the Diocese of Caesarea.

In 370, Eusebius died. Basil was chosen to succeed him and was consecrated as a bishop on 14 June 370. His new post as Bishop of Caesarea also gave him the powers of exarch of Pontus and metropolitan of five suffragan bishops, many of whom had opposed him in the election for Eusebius&#x27;s successor. It was then that his great powers were called into action. Hot-blooded and somewhat imperious, Basil was also generous and sympathetic. He personally organized a soup kitchen and distributed food to the poor during a famine following a drought.

His letters show that he actively worked to reform thieves and prostitutes. They also show him encouraging his clergy not to be tempted by wealth or the comparatively easy life of a priest and taking care in selecting worthy candidates for holy orders. He also had the courage to criticize public officials who failed in their duty of administering justice. At the same time, he preached every morning and evening in his own church to large congregations. In addition to all the above, he built a large complex just outside Caesarea, called the Basiliad, which included a poorhouse, hospice, and hospital. It was compared by Gregory of Nazianzus to the wonders of the world.

His zeal for orthodoxy did not blind him to what was good in an opponent; and for the sake of peace and charity, he was content to waive the use of orthodox terminology when it could be surrendered without a sacrifice of truth. The Emperor Valens, who was an adherent of the Arian philosophy, sent his prefect Modestus to at least agree to a compromise with the Arian faction. Basil&#x27;s adamant negative response prompted Modestus to say that no one had ever spoken to him in that way before. Basil replied, &quot;Perhaps you have never yet had to deal with a bishop.&quot; Modestus reported back to Valens that he believed nothing short of violence would avail against Basil. Valens was apparently unwilling to engage in violence. He did however issue orders banishing Basil repeatedly, none of which succeeded. Valens came himself to attend when Basil celebrated the Divine Liturgy on the Feast of the Theophany (Epiphany), and at that time was so impressed by Basil that he donated to him some land for the building of the Basiliad. This interaction helped to define the limits of governmental power over the church.

Basil then had to face the growing spread of Arianism. This belief system, which denied that Christ was consubstantial with the Father, was quickly gaining adherents and was seen by many, particularly those in Alexandria most familiar with it, as posing a threat to the unity of the church. Basil entered into connections with the West, and with the help of Athanasius, he tried to overcome its distrustful attitude toward the Homoiousians. The difficulties had been enhanced by bringing in the question as to the essence of the Holy Spirit. Although Basil advocated objectively the consubstantiality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son, he belonged to those, who, faithful to Eastern tradition, would not allow the predicate &quot;homoousios&quot; to the former; for this he was reproached as early as 371 by the Orthodox zealots among the monks, and Athanasius defended him.

Basil corresponded with Pope Damasus in the hope of having his aid and encouragement against triumphant Arianism; the pope, however, cherished some degree of suspicion against the Cappadocian Doctor.

==Death and legacy==

Basil died before the factional disturbances ended. He suffered from liver disease; excessive ascetic practices also contributed to his early demise. Historians disagree about the exact date Basil died. The great institute before the gates of Caesarea, the Ptochoptopheion, or &quot;Basileiad&quot;, which was used as poorhouse, hospital, and hospice became a lasting monument of Basil&#x27;s episcopal care for the poor. Many of St. Basil&#x27;s writings and sermons, specifically on the topics of money and possessions, continue to influence modern Christianity.

==Writings==
The principal theological writings of Basil are his &quot;On the Holy Spirit&quot;, an appeal to Scripture and early Christian tradition to prove the divinity of the Holy Spirit, and his &quot;Refutation of the Apology of the Impious Eunomius&quot;, which was written about in 364 and comprised three books against Eunomius of Cyzicus, the chief exponent of Anomoian Arianism. The first three books of the &quot;Refutation&quot; are his work; his authorship of the fourth and fifth books is generally considered doubtful.
He was a famous preacher, and many of his homilies, including a series of Lenten lectures on the &quot;Hexaemeron&quot; (also &quot;Hexaëmeros&quot;, &quot;Six Days of Creation&quot;; ), and an exposition of the psalter, have been preserved. Some, like that against usury and that on the famine in 368, are valuable for the history of morals; others illustrate the honour paid to martyrs and relics; the address to young men on the study of classical literature shows that Basil was influenced by his own education, which taught him to appreciate the propaedeutic importance of the classics. In one of his Homilies, he describes, in one of the earliest descriptions of desalination, how sailors in his time obtain fresh water by hanging sponges over a vessel with boiling seawater and collecting and condensing the water vapour.

In his exegesis Basil was an admirer of Origen and the need for the spiritual interpretation of Scripture. In his work on the Holy Spirit, he asserts that &quot;to take the literal sense and stop there, is to have the heart covered by the veil of Jewish literalism. Lamps are useless when the sun is shining.&quot; He frequently stresses the need for Reserve in doctrinal and sacramental matters. At the same time, he was against the wild allegories of some contemporaries. Concerning this, he wrote:

&quot;I know the laws of allegory, though less by myself than from the works of others. There are those, truly, who do not admit the common sense of the Scriptures, for whom water is not water, but some other nature, who see in a plant, in a fish, what their fancy wishes, who change the nature of reptiles and of wild beasts to suit their allegories, like the interpreters of dreams who explain visions in sleep to make them serve their own end.&quot;

His ascetic tendencies are exhibited in the &quot;Moralia&quot; and &quot;Asketika&quot; (sometimes mistranslated as ), ethical manuals for use in the world and the cloister, respectively. There has been a good deal of discussion concerning the authenticity of the two works known as the &quot;Greater Asketikon&quot; and the &quot;Lesser Asketikon&quot;.

According to Orosius, Basil taught apocatastasis entailing the restoration of all sinners to Christ after purification. This doctrine is most evident in his &quot;Commentary on Isaiah&quot;, although there is some scholarly dispute whether this commentary should truly be attributed to him. On the other hand, Basil vehemently opposed the view that hell has an end in his short &quot;Regulae&quot;, even claiming that the many people who hold it are deceived by the devil. However, the notion of a finite hell was also espoused by his siblings Macrina and Gregory of Nyssa and potentially by his dear friend Gregory of Nazianzus, which is one of the reasons to think that the relevant passage in &quot;Regulae&quot; was interpolated. The passage also seems to include ideas that could be considered in opposition to ideas in Basil&#x27;s undisputed writings, for example the notion of physical punishments in hell and of hell itself as a physical place with different locations. It is potentially in contradiction to most of Basil&#x27;s linguistic use as well.

In his book &quot;De Spiritu Sancto&quot;, Basil lists some who for him are illustrious men of the church and quotes them; these are Irenaeus of Lyon, Clement of Rome, Dionysius of Rome, Dionysius of Alexandria, Eusebius, Julius Africanus, Gregory Thaumaturgus, Firmilian and Origen.

Basil also stresses the complete equality of both genders, deriving from the same human &#x27;lump&#x27; (φύραμα), both in the image of God, endowed with the same honour and dignity (ὁμοτίμως), in perfect equality (ἐξ ἴσου). Men even risk being inferior in piety (Homily on Julitta 241B). Likewise, in Homilies on Psalms 1, PG 29.216–17, he insists on the Socratic and Stoic tenet, here Christianized, that man and woman have &#x27;one and the same virtue&#x27; and &#x27;one and the same nature&#x27; (φύσις). Their common creation was of equal honour and dignity (ὁμότιμος); they have the same capacity and activity (ἐνέργεια), and will be given the same reward. Similarly, in Letter to Amphilochius 188, Basil again uses ἐξ ἴσου in reference to the equality of women and men.

Basil faced the slavery issue in &quot;De Spiritu Sancto 20&quot; in the context of a Trinitarian debate. Basil recognizes that no human is &quot;a slave by nature&quot;. This principle countered Aristotle&#x27;s conviction and was consistent with Gregory of Nyssa&#x27;s view and with that of many other patristic thinkers; even Augustine and Theodoret conceded this. Basil, indeed, viewed slavery as a result of the Fall, a principle that was shared by Augustine, Theodoret, and many other Fathers. Sometimes slavery is a boon to the enslaved person, Basil maintained (in &quot;Moral Rules 75&quot; he recommended, that Christian slaves work harder than non-Christian slaves). This view is opposed to Gregory of Nyssa, and is reminiscent of Aristotle&#x27;s argument and of Theodoret&#x27;s.

It is in the ethical manuals and moral sermons that the practical aspects of his theoretical theology are illustrated. So, for example, it is in his &quot;Sermon to the Lazicans&quot; that we find Basil explaining how it is our common nature that obliges us to treat our neighbour&#x27;s natural needs (e.g., hunger, thirst) as our own, even though he is a separate individual.

Basil&#x27;s three hundred letters reveal his character. They show his observant nature, which, despite the troubles of ill-health and ecclesiastical unrest, remained optimistic, tender and even playful. Basil is honoured as the chief architect of monastic life in the Greek Church.

Most of his extant works, and a few spuriously attributed to him, are available in the &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot;, which includes Latin translations of varying quality. Several of Basil&#x27;s works appeared in the late twentieth century in the &quot;Sources Chrétiennes&quot; collection.

A famous quote of Basil is the below:
The bread you store belongs to the hungry. The clothes you accumulate belong to the naked. The shoes that you have in your closet are for the barefoot. The money you bury deep into the ground to keep it safe, belongs to the poor. You were unfair to as many people as you could have helped and you did not.

==Liturgical contributions==
Basil of Caesarea holds a very important place in the history of Christian liturgy. That St. Basil composed a liturgy, or rather reformed an existing liturgy, is beyond doubt, since besides the constant tradition of the Byzantine Church there are many testimonies in ancient writings to establish the fact. Basil&#x27;s liturgical influence is well-attested in early sources.

Most of the liturgies bearing the name of Basil are not entirely his work in their present form, but they nevertheless preserve a recollection of Basil&#x27;s activity in this field in formularizing liturgical prayers and promoting church songs. Patristic scholars conclude that the Liturgy of Saint Basil &quot;bears, unmistakably, the personal hand, pen, mind and heart of St. Basil the Great&quot;.

One liturgy that can be attributed to him is &quot;The Divine Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great&quot;, a liturgy that is somewhat longer than the more commonly used &quot;Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom&quot;. The difference between the two is primarily in the silent prayers said by the priest, and in the use of the hymn to the Theotokos, &quot;All of Creation&quot;, instead of the &quot;Axion Estin&quot; of John Chrysostom&#x27;s Liturgy.

The Eastern Churches preserve numerous other prayers attributed to Basil, including three prayers of exorcism, several morning and evening prayers, and the &quot;Prayer of the Hours&quot; which is read at each service of the Daily Office.

==Influence on monasticism==

Through his examples and teachings, Basil effected a noteworthy moderation in the austere practices which were previously characteristic of monastic life. He is also credited with coordinating the duties of work and prayer to ensure a proper balance between the two.

Basil is remembered as one of the most influential figures in the development of Christian monasticism. Not only is Basil recognized as the father of Eastern monasticism; historians recognize that his legacy extends also to the Western church, largely due to his influence on Saint Benedict. Patristic scholars such as Meredith assert that Benedict himself recognized this when he wrote in the epilogue to his &quot;Rule&quot; that his monks, in addition to the Bible, should read &quot;the confessions of the Fathers and their institutes and their lives and the &quot;Rule of our Holy Father, Basil.&quot; Basil&#x27;s teachings on monasticism, as encoded in works such as his &quot;Small Asketikon&quot;, were transmitted to the West via Rufinus during the late 4th century.

As a result of Basil&#x27;s influence, numerous religious orders in Eastern Christianity bear his name. In the Roman Catholic Church, the Basilian Fathers, also known as the Congregation of St. Basil, an international order of priests and students studying for the priesthood, is named after him.

==Commemorations==
Basil was given the title Doctor of the Church in the Western Church for his contributions to the debate initiated by the Arian controversy regarding the nature of the Trinity, and especially the question of the divinity of the Holy Spirit. Basil was responsible for defining the terms &quot;ousia&quot; (essence/substance) and &quot;hypostasis&quot; (person/reality), and for defining the classic formulation of three Persons in one Nature. His single greatest contribution was his insistence on the divinity and consubstantiality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son.

In Greek tradition, Basil brings gifts to children every 1 January (St Basil&#x27;s Day). It is traditional on St Basil&#x27;s Day to serve &quot;vasilopita&quot;, a rich bread baked with a coin inside. The tradition is attributed to St. Basil, who when a bishop, wanted to distribute money to the poor and commissioned some women to bake sweetened bread, in which he arranged to place gold coins. Thus the families in cutting the bread were pleasantly surprised to find the coins.

It is customary on his feast day to visit the homes of friends and relatives, to sing New Year&#x27;s carols, and to set an extra place at the table for Saint Basil. Basil, being born into a wealthy family, gave away all his possessions to the poor, the underprivileged, those in need, and children.

According to some sources, Basil died on 1 January, and the Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates his feast day together with that of the Feast of the Circumcision on that day. This was also the day on which the General Roman Calendar celebrated it at first; but in the 13th-century it was moved to 14 June, a date believed to be that of his ordination as bishop, and it remained on that date until the 1969 revision of the calendar, which moved it to 2 January, rather than 1 January, because the latter date is occupied by the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God. On 2 January Saint Basil is celebrated together with Saint Gregory Nazianzen. Novus Ordo services use the revised calendar while traditionalist Catholic communities continue to observe pre-1970 calendars.

The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod commemorates Basil, along with Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa on 10 January.

The Church of England celebrates Saint Basil&#x27;s feast (Lesser Festival) on 2 January, but the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada celebrate it on 14 June.

In the Byzantine Rite, 30 January is the Synaxis of the Three Holy Hierarchs, in honor of Saint Basil, Saint Gregory the Theologian and Saint John Chrysostom. There is also a commemoration on 19 January for the miracle performed by Saint Basil in the city of Nicaea.

The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria celebrates the feast day of Saint Basil on the 6th of Tobi (6th of Terr on the Ethiopian calendar of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church). At present, this corresponds to 14 January (15 January during leap year.)

There are numerous relics of Basil throughout the world. One of the most important is his head, which is preserved to this day at the monastery of the Great Lavra on Mount Athos in Greece. The mythical sword Durandal is said to contain some of Basil&#x27;s blood.

<doc id="175146" wikidata="Q30693" url="?curid=175146" title="Rudolf Clausius">
<text>Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius (; 2 January 1822 – 24 August 1888) was a German physicist and mathematician and is considered one of the central founding fathers of the science of thermodynamics. By his restatement of Sadi Carnot&#x27;s principle known as the Carnot cycle, he gave the theory of heat a truer and sounder basis. His most important paper, &quot;On the Moving Force of Heat&quot;, published in 1850, first stated the basic ideas of the second law of thermodynamics. In 1865 he introduced the concept of entropy. In 1870 he introduced the virial theorem, which applied to heat.

==Life==
Clausius was born in Köslin (now Koszalin, Poland) in the Province of Pomerania in Prussia. His father was a Protestant pastor and school inspector, and Rudolf studied in the school of his father. In 1838, he went to the Gymnasium in Stettin. Clausius graduated from the University of Berlin in 1844 where he had studied mathematics and physics since 1840 with, among others, Gustav Magnus, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, and Jakob Steiner. He also studied history with Leopold von Ranke. During 1848, he got his doctorate from the University of Halle on optical effects in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. In 1850 he became professor of physics at the Royal Artillery and Engineering School in Berlin and Privatdozent at the Berlin University. In 1855 he became professor at the ETH Zürich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, where he stayed until 1867. During that year, he moved to Würzburg and two years later, in 1869 to Bonn.

In 1870 Clausius organized an ambulance corps in the Franco-Prussian War. He was wounded in battle, leaving him with a lasting disability. He was awarded the Iron Cross for his services.

His wife, Adelheid Rimpau died in 1875, leaving him to raise their six children. In 1886, he married Sophie Sack, and then had another child. Two years later, on 24 August 1888, he died in Bonn, Germany.

==Work==
Clausius&#x27;s PhD thesis concerning the refraction of light proposed that we see a blue sky during the day, and various shades of red at sunrise and sunset (among other phenomena) due to reflection and refraction of light. Later, Lord Rayleigh would show that it was in fact due to the scattering of light.

His most famous paper, &quot;Ueber die bewegende Kraft der Wärme&quot; (&quot;On the Moving Force of Heat and the Laws of Heat which may be Deduced Therefrom&quot;)
was published in 1850, and dealt with the mechanical theory of heat. In this paper, he showed there was a contradiction between Carnot&#x27;s principle and the concept of conservation of energy. Clausius restated the two laws of thermodynamics to overcome this contradiction. This paper made him famous among scientists. (The third law was developed by Walther Nernst, during the years 1906–1912).

Clausius&#x27;s most famous statement of the second law of thermodynamics was published in German in 1854, and in English in 1856. 
During 1857, Clausius contributed to the field of kinetic theory after refining August Krönig&#x27;s very simple gas-kinetic model to include translational, rotational and vibrational molecular motions. In this same work he introduced the concept of &#x27;Mean free path&#x27; of a particle.

Clausius deduced the Clausius–Clapeyron relation from thermodynamics. This relation, which is a way of characterizing the phase transition between two states of matter such as solid and liquid, had originally been developed in 1834 by Émile Clapeyron.

===Entropy===

In 1865, Clausius gave the first mathematical version of the concept of entropy, and also gave it its name. Clausius chose the word because the meaning (from Greek ἐν &quot;en&quot; &quot;in&quot; and τροπή &quot;tropē&quot; &quot;transformation&quot;) is &quot;&quot;content transformative&quot; or &quot;transformation content&quot; (&quot;Verwandlungsinhalt&quot;&quot;).He used the now abandoned unit &#x27;Clausius&#x27; (symbol: Cl) for entropy.
:1 Clausius (Cl) = 1 calorie/degree Celsius (cal/°C) = 4.1868 joules per kelvin (J/K)

The landmark 1865 paper in which he introduced the concept of entropy ends with the following summary of the first and second laws of thermodynamics:
Leon Cooper added that in this way he succeeded in coining a word that meant the same thing to everybody: nothing.

<doc id="175147" wikidata="Q108314" url="?curid=175147" title="Anton Denikin">
<text>Anton Ivanovich Denikin (, ; – 7 August 1947) was a Russian military leader who served as the acting supreme ruler of the Russian State and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of South Russia during the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923. Previously, he was a general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I.

== Childhood ==

Denikin was born on 16 December 1872, in the village of Szpetal Dolny, part of the city Włocławek in Warsaw Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Poland). His father, Ivan Efimovich Denikin, had been born a serf in the province of Saratov. Sent as a recruit to do 25 years of military service, the elder Denikin became an officer in the 22nd year of his army service in 1856. He retired from the army in 1869 with the rank of major.

In 1869, Ivan Denikin married Polish seamstress Elżbieta Wrzesińska as his second wife. Anton Denikin, the couple&#x27;s only child, spoke both Russian and Polish growing up. His father&#x27;s Russian patriotism and devotion to the Russian Orthodox religion led Anton Denikin to the Russian army.

The Denikins lived very close to poverty, with the retired major&#x27;s small pension as their only source of income, and their finances worsened after Ivan&#x27;s death in 1885. Anton Denikin at this time began tutoring younger schoolmates to support the family. In 1890, Denikin enrolled at the Kiev Junker School, a military college from which he graduated in 1892. The twenty-year-old Denikin joined an artillery brigade, in which he served for three years.

In 1895, he was first accepted into the General Staff Academy, where he did not meet the academic requirements in the first of his two years. After this disappointment, Denikin attempted to attain acceptance again. On his next attempt he did better and finished fourteenth in his class. However, to his misfortune, the academy decided to introduce a new system of calculating grades and as a result Denikin was not offered a staff appointment after the final exams. He protested the decision to the highest authority (the Grand Duke).

After being offered a settlement according to which he would rescind his complaint in order to attain acceptance into the General Staff school again, Denikin declined, insulted.

Denikin first saw active service during the 1905 Russo-Japanese War. In 1905, he won promotion to the rank of colonel. In 1910, he became commander of the 17th infantry regiment. A few weeks before the outbreak of the First World War, Denikin reached the rank of major-general.

== World War I ==
By the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 Denikin was chief of staff of the Kiev Military District. He was initially appointed quartermaster of General Brusilov&#x27;s 8th Army. Not one for staff service, Denikin petitioned for an appointment to a fighting front. He was transferred to the 4th Rifle Brigade, which was transformed into the 4th Rifle Division in 1915. This was one of the formations cited by Brusilov in his Order No. 643 of 5 (18) April 1916, which sought to end fraternization between Russian and Austrian troops.

In October 1916, he was appointed to command the Russian 8th Army Corps and lead troops in Romania. Following the February Revolution and the overthrow of Tsar Nicholas II, he became Chief of Staff to Mikhail Alekseev, then Aleksei Brusilov, and finally Lavr Kornilov. Denikin was concurrently commander of the Southwestern Front from 20 July (2 August) to 16 (29) August 1917. He supported the attempted coup of his superior, Kornilov, in September 1917 and was arrested and imprisoned with him. After this Alekseev would be reappointed commander-in-Chief.

== Civil War ==

Following the October Revolution both Denikin and Kornilov escaped to Novocherkassk in the Northern Caucasus and, with other Tsarist officers, formed the anti-Bolshevik Volunteer Army, initially commanded by Alekseev. Kornilov was killed in April 1918 near Ekaterinodar and the Volunteer Army came under Denikin&#x27;s command thanks in part to the support of fellow general Sergey Markov. Kornilov&#x27;s disastrous attempt to take the city was finally cancelled and the army retreated towards the north-east, evading destruction and ending the campaign which would become known as the Ice March. There was some sentiment to place Grand Duke Nicholas in overall command but Denikin was not interested in sharing power. In June–November 1918, Denikin launched the highly successful Second Kuban Campaign which gave him control of the entire area between the Black and Caspian Sea.
In the summer of 1919, Denikin led the assault of the southern White forces in their final push to capture Moscow. For a time, it appeared that the White Army would succeed in its drive; Leon Trotsky, as the supreme commander of the Red Army, hastily concluded an agreement with Nestor Makhno&#x27;s anarchist Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine for mutual support. Makhno duly turned his Insurgent Army east and led it against Denikin&#x27;s extended lines of supply, forcing the Whites to retreat. Denikin&#x27;s army would be decisively defeated at Orel in October 1919, some 360 km south of Moscow.The White forces in southern Russia would be in constant retreat thereafter, eventually reaching the Crimea in March 1920.
On 4 January 1920, with defeat and capture by the Bolsheviks in Siberia imminent, Admiral Alexander Kolchak named Denikin as his successor as Supreme Ruler (&quot;Verkhovnyy Pravitel&quot;), but Denikin accepted neither the functions nor the style of Supreme Leader.

Meanwhile, the Soviet government immediately tore up its agreement with Makhno and attacked his anarchist forces. After a seesaw series of battles in which both sides gained ground, Trotsky&#x27;s more numerous and better equipped Red Army troops decisively defeated and dispersed Makhno&#x27;s Insurgent Army.

Although Denikin refused to recognise the independence of Azerbaijan and Georgia, in maintaining friendly relations with Armenia he recognised their independence and supplied them with ammunition during the Muslim uprisings in Kars and Sharur–Nakhichevan.

=== Antisemitism and anti-Masonry ===
During the Russian Civil War, an estimated 150,000 Jews were killed in pogroms. Ukrainian forces, nominally under the control of Symon Petliura, perpetrated approximately 40 percent of the recorded pogroms, although Petliura never ordered his forces to engage in such activity and eventually exhorted his troops to refrain from the violence. The White Army is associated with 17 percent of the attacks, and was generally responsible for the most active propaganda campaign against Jews, whom they openly associated with communism. The Red Army is blamed for 9 percent of the pogroms.

In the territories it occupied, Denikin&#x27;s army carried out mass executions and plunder, in what was later known as the White Terror. In the town of Maykop in Circassia during September 1918, more than 4,000 people were massacred by General Pokrovsky&#x27;s forces. In the small town of Fastov alone, Denikin&#x27;s Volunteer Army murdered over 1,500 Jews, mostly elderly, women, and children.

The press of the Denikin regime regularly incited violence against communist Jews and Jews seen as communists in the context of treason committed by Red agents. For example, a proclamation by one of Denikin&#x27;s generals incited people to &quot;arm themselves&quot; in order to extirpate &quot;the evil force which lives in the hearts of Jew-communists.&quot;

Religious and faithful to the Russian Orthodox Church, Denikin did not criticise the pogroms against the Jewish population until the end of 1919. Denikin believed that most people had reasons to hate Jews and wished to avoid an issue that divided his officers. Many of them, intensely anti-Semitic, allowed pogroms under their watch, which turned into a method of terror against the Jewish population and served to earn the favour of the Ukrainian people for much of 1919.

Western sponsors were dismayed at the widespread antisemitism in the Whites&#x27; officer ranks, especially as the Bolsheviks sought to officially prohibit acts of anti-Semitism. Winston Churchill personally warned General Denikin that:

John Ernest Hodgson, a British war correspondent with Denikin&#x27;s forces, said the following of Denikin&#x27;s and his officers&#x27; antisemitism:

== Exile ==

Facing increasingly sharp criticism and emotionally exhausted, Denikin resigned in April 1920 in favor of General Baron Pyotr Wrangel, who later established the Russian All-Military Union. Denikin left the Crimea by ship to Istanbul and then to London. He spent a few months in England, then moved to Belgium, and later to Hungary.

From 1926, Denikin lived in France. Although he remained bitterly opposed to Russia&#x27;s Communist government, he chose to exist discreetly on the periphery of politics, spending most of his time writing and lecturing. This did not prevent the Soviets from unsuccessfully targeting him for abduction in the same effort that snared exiled General Alexander Kutepov in 1930 and General Yevgeny Miller in 1937 (both members of the Russian All-Military Union). &quot;White Against Red – The Life of General Anton Denikin&quot; gives possibly the definitive account of the intrigues during these early Soviet &quot;wet-ops&quot;.
Denikin was a writer, and prior to World War I had written several pieces in which he criticised the shortcomings of his beloved Russian Army. His voluminous writings after the Russian Civil War (written while living in exile) are notable for their analytical tone and candour. Since he enjoyed writing and most of his income was derived from it, Denikin began to consider himself a full-time writer and developed close friendships with several Russian émigré authors—among them Ivan Bunin (a Nobel laureate), Ivan Shmelev, and Aleksandr Kuprin.

Although respected by some of the community of Russian exiles, Denikin was disliked by émigrés of both political extremes, right and left. With the fall of France in 1940, Denikin left Paris in order to avoid imprisonment by the Germans. Although he was eventually captured, he declined all attempts to co-opt him for use in Nazi anti-Soviet propaganda. The Germans did not press the matter and Denikin was allowed to remain in rural exile. Denikin denounced White Russian collaborators in 1939.At the conclusion of World War II, correctly anticipating their likely fate at the hands of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union, Denikin attempted to persuade the Western Allies not to forcibly repatriate Soviet POWs (see also Operation Keelhaul). He was largely unsuccessful in his effort.
From 1945 until his death in 1947, Denikin lived in the United States, in New York City. On 7 August 1947, at the age of 74, he died of a heart attack while on vacation near Ann Arbor, Michigan. Denikin was buried with military honours in Detroit. His remains were later transferred to St. Vladimir&#x27;s Cemetery in Jackson, New Jersey. His wife, Xenia Vasilievna Chizh (1892–1973), was buried at Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois cemetery near Paris.

On 3 October 2005, in accordance with the wishes of his daughter Marina Denikina and by authority of the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, General Denikin&#x27;s remains were transferred from the United States and buried together with Ivan Ilyin&#x27;s at the Donskoy Monastery in Moscow.

The importance of Denikin&#x27;s diary for explaining the relationship between &quot;Great and little Russia, Ukraine&quot; was cited by Putin during his 24 May 2009 visit to the Donskoy Monastery. &quot;He says nobody should be allowed to interfere between us. This is only Russia&#x27;s right.&quot; Putin emphasized that Denikin&#x27;s diary was worth reading, especially the passages in which he described Ukraine as an indivisible part of Russia.

<doc id="175149" wikidata="Q7845" url="?curid=175149" title="'Pataphysics">
<text>&#x27;Pataphysics () is a sardonic &quot;philosophy of science&quot; invented by French writer Alfred Jarry (1873–1907) intended to be a parody of science. Difficult to be simply defined or pinned down, it has been described as the &quot;science of imaginary solutions&quot;.

== Introduction ==
&#x27;Pataphysics was a concept expressed by Jarry in a mock-scientific manner, with undertones of spoofing and quackery, as expounded in his novel &quot;Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician&quot;. Here, Jarry toyed with conventional concepts and interpretations of reality. Another attempt at a definition interprets &#x27;pataphysics as an idea that &quot;the virtual or imaginary nature of things as glimpsed by the heightened vision of poetry or science or love can be seized and lived as real&quot;. Jarry defines &#x27;pataphysics in a number of statements and examples, including that it is &quot;the science of imaginary solutions, which symbolically attributes the properties of objects, described by their virtuality, to their lineaments&quot;. A practitioner of &#x27;pataphysics is a pataphysician or a pataphysicist.

== Definitions ==
One definition of &#x27;pataphysics is that it is &quot;a branch of philosophy or science that examines imaginary phenomena that exist in a world beyond metaphysics; it is the science of imaginary solutions.&quot; Jean Baudrillard defines &#x27;pataphysics as &quot;the imaginary science of our world, the imaginary science of excess, of excessive, parodic, paroxystic effects - particularly the excess of emptiness and insignificance&quot;.

There are over one hundred definitions of &#x27;pataphysics. Some examples are shown below.



== Etymology ==
The word ″&quot;pataphysics&quot; is a contracted formation that derives from the Greek (&quot;tà epì tà metaphusiká&quot;). It is a phrase/expression that mean &quot;that which is above metaphysics&quot;. It is itself a sly variation on the title of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, which in Greek is &quot;&quot; (&quot;tà metà tà phusiká&quot;).
Jarry mandated the inclusion of the apostrophe in both the words &#x27;pataphysique and &#x27;pataphysics &quot;... to avoid a simple pun&quot;. The words &quot;pataphysician&quot; or &quot;pataphysicist&quot; and the adjective &quot;pataphysical&quot; should not include the apostrophe. Only when consciously referring to Jarry&#x27;s science itself should the word &quot;&#x27;pataphysics&quot; carry the apostrophe. 

The term &quot;pataphysics&quot; is a paronym (considered a kind of pun in French) of &quot;metaphysics&quot;. Since the apostrophe in no way affects the meaning or pronunciation of &quot;pataphysics&quot;, this spelling of the term is a sly notation, to the reader, suggesting a variety of puns that listeners may hear, or be aware of. These puns include &quot;patte à physique&quot; (&quot;physics paw&quot;), as interpreted by Jarry scholars Keith Beaumont and Roger Shattuck, &quot;pas ta physique&quot; (&quot;not your physics&quot;), and &quot;pâte à physique&quot; (&quot;physics paste&quot;).

== History ==
The term first appeared in print in the text of Alfred Jarry&#x27;s play &quot;Guignol&quot; in the 28 April 1893 issue of &quot;L&#x27;Écho de Paris littéraire illustré&quot;, but it has been suggested that the word has its origins in the same school pranks at the &quot;lycée&quot; in Rennes that led Jarry to write &quot;Ubu Roi&quot;. Jarry considered Ibicrates and Sophrotatos the Armenian as the fathers of this &quot;science&quot;.

=== The Collège de &#x27;Pataphysique ===
The &quot;Collège de &#x27;Pataphysique&quot;, founded in 1948 in Paris, France, is &quot;a society committed to learned and inutilious research&quot;. (The word &#x27;inutilious&#x27; is synonymous with &#x27;useless&#x27;.) The motto of the college is (&quot;I arise again the same though changed&quot;).

The permanent head of the college is the Inamovable Curator, Dr. Faustroll, assisted by Bosse-de-Nage (&quot;Starosta&quot;): both are fictional.

The Vice-Curator is the &quot;first and most senior living entity&quot; in the college&#x27;s hierarchy. The Vice-Curatrice is Tanya Peixoto of the London Institute of &#x27;Pataphysics and Bookartbookshop. She was elected in 2014 to succeed Her Magnificence Lutembi – a crocodile – who succeeded Opach, the Baron Mollet, and Doctor Sandomir.

Jean-Christophe Averty was appointed Satrap in 1990.

Publications of the college, generally called (&quot;green candle&quot;), include the &quot;Cahiers&quot;, &quot;Dossiers&quot;, the &quot;Subsidia Pataphysica&quot; and since september 2021, the &quot;Spéculations&quot;.

Notable members have included Marcel Duchamp, Joan Miró, Eugène Ionesco, Noël Arnaud, Jean Baudrillard, Jean-Christophe Averty, René Daumal, Luc Étienne, François Le Lionnais, Jean Lescure, Raymond Queneau, Boris Vian, Jacques Carelman, Man Ray, Max Ernst, Julien Torma, Roger Shattuck, Groucho, Chico and Harpo Marx, Philippe de Chérisey, Rolando Villazón, Fernando Arrabal and Gavin Bryars. The Oulipo began as a subcommittee of the college.

=== Offshoots of the Collège de &#x27;Pataphysique ===
Although France had been always the centre of the pataphysical globe, there are followers in different cities around the world. In 1966 Juan Esteban Fassio was commissioned to draw the map of the &quot;Collège de &#x27;Pataphysique&quot; and its institutes abroad.

The college stopped its public activities between 1975 and 2000, referred to as its &quot;occultation&quot;. However through that time, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, The Netherlands, and many other countries showed that the internationalization of &#x27;pataphysics was irreversible.

In the 1950s, Buenos Aires in the Western Hemisphere and Milan in Europe were the first cities to have &#x27;pataphysical institutes. London, Edinburgh, Budapest, and Liège, as well as many other European cities, caught up in the sixties.

==== Czechoslovakia ====
During the communist era, a small group of &#x27;pataphysicists in Czechoslovakia started a journal called &quot;PAKO&quot;, or &quot;Pataphysical Collegium&quot;. Jarry&#x27;s plays had a lasting impression on the country&#x27;s underground philosophical scene.

==== London Institute of &#x27;Pataphysics ====
The London Institute of &#x27;Pataphysics was established in September 2000 to promote &#x27;pataphysics in the English-speaking world. The institute has various publications, including a journal, and has six departments: Bureau for the Investigation of Subliminal Images, Committee for Hirsutism and Pogonotrophy, Department of Dogma and Theory, Department of Potassons, Department of Reconstructive Archaeology, and The Office of Patentry.

The institute also contains a pataphysical museum and archive and organised the &quot;Anthony Hancock Paintings and Sculptures&quot; exhibition in 2002.

The official orchestra of the London Institute of &#x27;Pataphysics is the London Snorkelling Team.

Peter Blegvad has been the president of the London Institute of &#x27;Pataphysics since 2011.

==== Musée Patamécanique ====
Musée Patamécanique is a private museum located in Bristol, Rhode Island. Founded in 2006, it is open by appointment only to friends, colleagues, and occasionally to outside observers. The museum is presented as a hybrid between an automaton theatre and a cabinet of curiosities and contains works representing the field of Patamechanics, an artistic practice and area of study chiefly inspired by &#x27;pataphysics.

Examples of exhibits include a troupe of singing animatronic chipmunks, a time machine the museum says is the world&#x27;s largest automated phenakistoscope, an olfactory clock, a chandelier of singing animatronic nightingales, an Undigestulator (a device that purportedly reconstitutes digested foods), a peanuts enlarger, a syzygistic oracle, the earolin (a 24-inch tall holographic ear that plays the violin), and a machine for capturing the dreams of bumble bees.

==== &#x27;Pataphysics Institute in Vilnius ====
A &#x27;Pataphysics Institute opened in Vilnius, Lithuania in May 2013.

; Clinamen : A clinamen is the unpredictable swerve of atoms that poet Christian Bök calls &quot;... the smallest possible aberration that can make the greatest possible difference&quot;. An example is Jarry&#x27;s &quot;merdre&quot;, a swerve of (&quot;shit&quot;). 

; Antinomy : An antinomy is the mutually incompatible. It represents the duality of things, the echo or symmetry, the good and the evil at the same time. Hugill mentions various examples including the plus-minus, the faust-troll, the haldern-ablou, the yes-but, the ha-ha and the paradox.
; Syzygy : The syzygy originally comes from astronomy and denotes the alignment of three celestial bodies in a straight line. In a pataphysical context it is the pun. It usually describes a conjunction of things, something unexpected and surprising. Serendipity is a simple chance encounter but the syzygy has a more scientific purpose. Bök mentions Jarry suggesting that the fall of a body towards a centre might not be preferable to the ascension of a vacuum towards a periphery.

; Absolute : The absolute is the idea of a transcended reality.

; Anomaly : An anomaly represents the exception. Jarry said that, &quot;Pataphysics will examine the laws governing exceptions, and will explain the universe supplementary to this one.&quot; Bök calls it &quot;... the repressed part of a rule which ensures that the rule does not work&quot;.

; Pataphor : A pataphor is an unusually extended metaphor based on &#x27;pataphysics. As Jarry claimed that &#x27;pataphysics exists &quot;... as far from metaphysics as metaphysics extends from regular reality&quot;, a pataphor attempts to create a figure of speech that exists as far from metaphor as metaphor exists from non-figurative language.

== Pataphysical calendar ==
The pataphysical calendar is a variation of the Gregorian calendar. The &quot;Collège de &#x27;Pataphysique&quot; created the calendar in 1949. The pataphysical era (E.P.) started on Jarry&#x27;s birthday, 8 September 1873 vulg. When converting pataphysical dates to Gregorian dates, the appendage (vulg.) for &quot;vulgate&quot; (&quot;common&quot;) is added.

The week starts on a Sunday. Every 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd is a Sunday and every 13th day of a month falls on a Friday (see Friday the 13th). Each day is assigned a specific name or saint. For example, the 27 Haha (1 November vulg.) is called or the 14 Sable (14 December vulg.) is the day of .

The year has a total of 13 months each with 29 days. The 29th day of each month is imaginary with two exceptions:
* the 29 Gidouille (13 July vulg.) is always non-imaginary
* the 29 Gueules (23 February vulg.) is non-imaginary during leap years

The table below shows the names and order of months in a pataphysical year with their corresponding Gregorian dates and approximate translations or meanings by Hugill.

For example:
* 8 September 1873 (vulg.) = 1 Absolu 1
* 1 January 2000 (vulg.) = 4 Décervelage 127
* 10 November 2012 (vulg.)(Saturday) = 8 As 140 (Sunday)

== Works influenced by &#x27;Pataphysics ==
In the 1960s &#x27;pataphysics was used as a conceptual principle within various fine art forms, especially pop art and popular culture. Works within the pataphysical tradition tend to focus on the processes of their creation, and elements of chance or arbitrary choices are frequently key in those processes. Select pieces from the artist Marcel Duchamp and the composer John Cage characterize this. At around this time, Asger Jorn, a pataphysician and member of the Situationist International, referred to &#x27;pataphysics as a new religion.

=== In literature ===
In 1948 Raymond Queneau, Jean Genet, and Eugène Ionesco founded Collège de pataphysique and published OULIPO,
which influenced the following writers:
* Boris Vian became involved with the Collège de &#x27;Pataphysique.
* René Daumal has references to pataphysics in his writings.
* Handspring Puppet Company produces theatrical works with elements of pataphysics.
* Pat Murphy features pataphysics in several works of science fiction.
* Jean Baudrillard is often described as a pataphysician and identified as such for some part of his life.
* Pablo Lopez has developed an extension of &#x27;pataphysics called the pataphor.

=== In music ===
* In the song &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot; on the Beatles album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, &quot;pataphysical science&quot; is mentioned as a course of study for Joan, the first victim of Maxwell Edison.
* The debut album by Ron &#x27;Pate&#x27;s Debonairs, featuring Reverend Fred Lane (his first appearance on vinyl), is titled &quot;Raudelunas &#x27;Pataphysical Revue&quot; (1977), a live theatrical performance. A review in &quot;The Wire&quot; magazine said, &quot;No other record has ever come as close to realising Alfred Jarry&#x27;s desire &#x27;to make the soul monstrous&#x27; – or even had the vision or invention to try.&quot; &#x27;Pate (note the pataphysical apostrophe) and Lane were central members in the Raudelunas art collective in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
* Professor Andrew Hugill, of de Montfort University, is a practitioner of pataphysical music. He curated &quot;Pataphysics&quot;, for the Sonic Arts Network&#x27;s CD series, and in 2007 some of his own music was issued by UHRecordings under the title &quot;Pataphysical Piano; The sounds and silences of Andrew Hugill&quot;.
* British progressive rock band Soft Machine were self-described as &quot;the Official Orchestra of the College of Pataphysics&quot; and featured the two songs &quot;Pataphysical Introduction&quot; parts I and II on their 1969 album &quot;Volume Two&quot;.
* Japanese psychedelic rock band Acid Mothers Temple refer to the topic on their 1999 release &quot;Pataphisical Freak Out MU!!&quot;.
* Autolux, a Los Angeles–based noise pop band, have a song &quot;Science of Imaginary Solutions&quot; on their second album &quot;Transit Transit&quot;.
* The composer Gavin Bryars has been a member of the Collège de &#x27;Pataphysique since 1974; he was appointed Regent in 2001 and a Transcendent Satrap in 2015 at the pataphysical New Year&#x27;s Eve Vigil E.P. 143 (7 September 2015 vulg.)
* The Pataphysical Broadcasting Foundation Inc. (established 1972, dissolved 2015) founded radio station KUSP in Santa Cruz, California, for (then) non-conventional radio programming.

=== In visual art ===
* In 1962 American artist James E. Brewton developed a style of abstract expressionism he called Graffiti Pataphysic. A survey of Brewton&#x27;s &#x27;pataphysics-related work was shown in 2014 in Philadelphia.
* American artist Thomas Chimes developed an interest in Jarry&#x27;s &#x27;pataphysics, which became a lifelong passion, inspiring much of the painter&#x27;s creative work.
* In 2000, &quot;The Laboratory of Feminist Pataphysics&quot; was founded by Canadian visual artist, writer and scholar, Mireille Perron. &quot;The Laboratory of Feminist Pataphysics&quot; has been shown at the Nickle Arts Museum, The New Gallery and Stride Gallery in Calgary, Alberta.
* In 2010 American artist Kevin Ferreira began a visual exploration into the imaginary solutions for the constructs of reality (pataphysics=pata art). The exhibit SpektrumMEK that resulted from this endeavor has been put into his book &quot;SpektrumMEK: A pataphysical gestation to the birth of Lil&#x27; t&quot;.
* The League of Imaginary Scientists, a Los Angeles-based art collective specializing in &#x27;pataphysics-based interactive experiments. In 2011 they exhibited a series of projects at Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.
* Brian Reffin Smith, a Berlin-based British artist and Regent of Catachemistry and Speculative Metallurgy in the Collège de &#x27;Pataphysique, Paris, often shows art based upon or influenced by &#x27;Pataphysics and conducts performances at Pataphysical events. He was part of a group of German and Czech artists who exhibited at Patadata, in Zlín, Czech Republic, 2017.

=== In online fiction ===
* The SCP Foundation has multiple articles referencing pataphysical concepts, such as SCP-2747 (&quot;As below, so above&quot;), where the pataphysical reality is described as &quot;layers of metafictional narrative&quot; and the anomaly in question ascends the narratives to destroy them. &quot;Pataphysics&quot; articles often deal with the fictional nature of the Foundation. For example, SCP-3309 (&quot;Where We Go When We Fade, Fade Away&quot;) features Foundation scientists attempting to manipulate the real-life website&#x27;s article deletion feature to destroy problematic SCP objects and SCP-5999, which is an attempt at killing the authors of the site itself.

=== In architecture ===
* Le Corbusier developed an interest in Jarry&#x27;s work.

== Pataphor ==
The &quot;pataphor&quot; (, ), is a term coined by writer and musician Pablo Lopez, for an unusually extended metaphor based on Alfred Jarry&#x27;s &quot;science&quot; of &#x27;pataphysics&#x27;.

As Jarry claimed that &#x27;pataphysics existed &quot;as far from metaphysics as metaphysics extends from regular reality&quot;, a pataphor attempts to create a figure of speech that exists as far from metaphor as metaphor exists from non-figurative language. Whereas a metaphor compares a real object or event to a seemingly unrelated subject to emphasize their similarities, the pataphor uses the newly created metaphorical similarity as a reality on which to base itself. In going beyond mere ornamentation of the original idea, the pataphor seeks to describe a new and separate world, in which an idea or aspect has taken on a life of its own.

Like &#x27;pataphysics itself, pataphors essentially describe two degrees of separation from reality (rather than merely one degree of separation, which is the world of metaphors and metaphysics). The pataphor may also be said to function as a critical tool, describing the world of &quot;assumptions based on assumptions&quot; – such as belief systems or rhetoric run amok. The following is an example:
Thus, the pataphor has created a world where the chessboard exists, including the characters who live in that world, entirely abandoning the original context.

The pataphor has been subject to commercial interpretations, usage in speculative computer applications, applied to highly imaginative problem solving methods and even politics on the international level. The Firesign Theatre is a comedy troupe whose jokes often rely on pataphors. There is a band called Pataphor and an interactive fiction in the Interactive Fiction Database called &quot;PataNoir&quot;, based on pataphors. Pataphor is used by the Writer&#x27;s Program at the University of North Florida, and has appeared in works affiliated with the Maria Curie-Skłodowska University.

Pataphors have been the subject of art exhibits, as in Tara Strickstein&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Pataphor&quot; exhibit at Next Art Fair / Art Chicago, other artworks, and architectural works. Pataphors have also been used in literary criticism, and mentioned in &quot;Art in America&quot;.

There is also a book of pataphorical art called &quot;Pataphor&quot; by Dutch artist Hidde van Schie.

==Events==
Hechtel was home to the &quot;KBC Night of Athletics&quot;, a yearly international athletics meeting and the annual International Airshow at Sanicole Airport, taking place in September.
==Battle of Hechtel==
For seven days during World War II, from 6 to 12 September 1944, the town of Hechtel became the front line between German and British troops in what is known as the battle of Hechtel. German troops consisted of the 2nd Hermann Göring Tank Regiment. The 1st battalion was in Hechtel, with the 2nd placed 2km to the east in Wijchmaal. British forces were from the 1st and 2nd Battalion Welsh Guards, Irish Guards, Scots Guards &#x27;X&#x27;-Company, Grenadier Guards and other supporting units.

During the battle, 62 British and 127 German soldiers were killed with another 250 captured. Thirty-five civilians also lost their lives with most being executed by German troops. The town centre was heavily damaged.

The battle ended on 12 September when the Irish Guards flanked the Germans, took a strategic bridge isolating the German forces.

A German Jagdpanther tank destroyer knocked out during this battle in on display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford - although its exact provenance is uncertain, it is claimed to be one knocked out by Hugh Griffiths and was previously at the Imperial War Museum London. The battle is commemorated every year on the 2nd Sunday of September.

Hechtel was the site of the death of the famous Anglican priest Hugh Lister, who served as a combatant officer in the Welsh Guards.

Houthalen-Helchteren is located near the watershed between the Meuse and the Scheldt. In the immediate vicinity the Dommel (which flows to the Meuse near Den Bosch), the Grote Nete (which flows to the Scheldt) and the Neer (that joins the Meuse just south of Roermond) all originate.

== History of Helchteren ==
Helchteren could have become famous in 1702 when, during the War of the Spanish Succession, a French Army under Boufflers faced an alliance army under Marlborough. A battle could have ensued, but instead it came to the not so famous cannonade of Helchteren. The cannonade itself is however a seldom occurring event in military history.

<text>Kinrooi (; ) is a municipality in the Belgian province of Limburg, between Maaseik and Bree. On January 1, 2006, Kinrooi had a total population of 11,978. The total area is 54.76 km2, which gives a population density of 219 inhabitants per km2.

Kinrooi was formed on September 18, 1971, when the four municipalities Kinrooi, Kessenich, Geistingen-Ophoven and Molenbeersel were fused. There have been three mayors. The current mayor is Jo Brouns.

==History==
Before, Kinrooi was a hamlet of the village of Kessenich. The flag reminds to that; the clarions stood on the shield of Kessenich. After the independence of Belgium in 1839 it became a little municipality, together with some nearby hamlets. In 2005 there are prehistoric remains found in the center, when it was being renovated.

==Economy==
Kinrooi&#x27;s main economic activities are agriculture, tourism and the reclamation of gravel, sand and loam.
The downside of this reclamation is that a lot of land surface gets lost. Tourism is also an important resource. Kinrooi attracts a lot of tourists because it has seven nature reserves that harbor rare animal and plant species, it has a marina and because it has several old windmills. Besides, there is a lot of watersporting, in the old gravel pools. One of them, lying in Ophoven, is now the greatest inner harbour of Europe.

<doc id="175164" wikidata="Q110989" url="?curid=175164" title="Maaseik">
<text>Maaseik (; ) is a city and municipality in the Belgian province of Limburg. Both in size (close to 77 km2) and in population (approx. 25,000 inhabitants, of whom some 3,000 non-Belgian), it is the 8th largest municipality in Limburg. The town is the seat of the administrative arrondissement of Maaseik (&quot;kieskanton&quot;). Internationally, Maaseik is known as the assumed birthplace of the famous Flemish painters Jan and Hubert van Eyck.

==Geography==
The town of Maaseik is located on the left bank of the Meuse (), bordering the Netherlands. For this reason the river is called &quot;Grensmaas&quot; (for &quot;border Meuse&quot;) here. Two smaller rivers, the Bosbeek (or Oeterbeek) and the Zanderbeek (or Diepbeek), flow into the Meuse near Maaseik. Because of its location in the Meuse valley, Maaseik has mostly fertile soils. The northwestern part of the municipality is situated on the plain of Bocholt and has less fertile soils.

The Meuse valley at Maaseik is about 4 kilometres wide. Maaseik has mostly been protected from floods by its slightly elevated position on a fluvial terrace. The riverbed has moved eastwards considerably over the centuries and has left several anabranches, meanders and oxbow lakes. An old anabranch of the Meuse (&quot;Oude Maasarm&quot;) can be seen in Heppeneert, a hamlet south of Maaseik. Deposition of sediments (mainly gravel, loam and clay) occurred on the inner edges of the meanders. For many decades gravel has been extracted from the area, resulting in a multitude of disused gravel pits, which have been mostly redesignated as nature reserves or watersports areas.

The Maaseik municipality includes the town of Maaseik and the sub-municipalities of Neeroeteren and Opoeteren. Smaller villages and hamlets include Aldeneik, Heppeneert, Wurfeld, &#x27;t Ven, Gremelslo, Berg, Schootsheide, Voorshoven, Waterloos, De Riet and Dorne.

== History ==

===Etymology and origins===
As its name would suggest, Aldeneik (possibly to be translated as &#x27;old oak&#x27;) is older than Maaseik (&#x27;Meuse oak&#x27;). Although most toponyms with the affix &quot;-eik&quot; refer to a landscape with oaks, it is also possible that it is derived from the German word &quot;Ecke&quot;, which means &#x27;corner&#x27;. &#x27;Old corner&#x27; or &#x27;bend&#x27; may in that case be linked to the fact that historically, the Meuse formed a bend around Aldeneik. An oaktree, however, is present in the town&#x27;s coat of arms, which includes three crosses (perhaps representing the three oldest parishes) and a fish (representing the river Meuse).
According to tradition, Aldeneik Abbey was established by Adelard, a local Frankish lord, around 700 AD, as a Benedictine nunnery. His two daughters, Herlindis and Relindis, both became abbesses of the monastery and eventually became saints. The abbey at Aldeneik soon became the center of a small village community.

The abbey probably suffered destruction by the Vikings in the 9th century. Around 950, emperor Otto I gave the restored monastery to the bishop of Liège, who turned it into a religious chapter for (male) canons. The reason for this reform may have been that there were already several religious institutions for noble women in the area: Susteren Abbey, Thorn Abbey and Munsterbilzen Abbey. Aldeneik Abbey was abandoned at the beginning of the Eighty Years&#x27; War but the chapter continued in &quot;Nieuw-Eycke&quot; (&#x27;new oak&#x27;), now Maaseik.

===Middle Ages===
The town of Maaseik was probably founded around 1000, perhaps by the canons of nearby Aldeneik. It lay near the old Roman road that connected Maastricht and Nijmegen and was relatively safely situated in the valley of the Meuse. The settlement was originally part of the County of Loon. The village grew and became an important trading place in the Meuse region. Maaseik received its city charter in 1244. In the 14th century Loon was incorporated into the Bishopric of Liège and Maaseik became one of the 23 Liège &quot;Bonnes Villes&quot;.

As a typically planned town, the four main streets start at the marketplace and led to the four city gates, none of which has been preserved. The rectangular shape of the city walls is also typical. Against the western wall, a castle was built. The walls were dismantled however in 1467, when during the Liège Wars the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, attacked the Prince-Bishopric of Liège and destroyed many towns in the region.

===16th-18th century===
Up till the 16th century Maaseik&#x27;s economy was flourishing, thanks to commerce and the production of broadcloth. However, a large section of the population in these days were priests, canons, monks, nuns, beguines or beghards. Until the French Revolution, no fewer than six monasteries were present in the small town.

During the religious troubles of the 16th century, Maaseik was a stronghold for Anabaptism and almost broke away from Liège, but prince-bishop Gerard van Groesbeek was able to calm the people and retain the town.

Maaseik was besieged again in 1672 by Louis XIV. The walls, which had been rebuilt in the 16th century, were strengthened by Vauban during this period. The town suffered two disastrous fires in 1650 and 1684; the 1684 fire destroyed one third of the entire town which up till then largely consisted of wooden houses. After that the building of wooden houses was no longer permitted.

===Modern period===
After the French retreat in 1814, Maaseik became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–39). Effectively, the town, having sympathized with the Belgian Revolution, became a Belgian town in 1831.

The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century seems to have bypassed Maaseik. The town had lost its importance and did not experience much growth, which perhaps accounts for the survival of many houses from the 17th and 18th century. Until well into the 20th century, several farms were active within the city walls. The walls were gradually taken down in the course of the 19th and 20th century. Only a portion of the south section at Walstraat remains. Some street names recall the names of the old city gates (Bospoort, Maaspoort). In 2007, remains of a fortified tower were found during excavations for an underground parking garage.

A railroad built in the 19th century connected Maaseik to the provincial capital Hasselt, but fell into disuse and was removed around 1950; it now serves as part of a bicycle network in Belgian Limburg. In the early 20th century, a bridge was built over the Meuse, connecting Maaseik directly with the Netherlands. The bridge was destroyed several times during World Wars I and II. The present bridge was built in 1951 and replaced a temporary bridge built by American troops in 1944.

Today, Maaseik is mostly a regional centre for the surrounding communities with some small factories and businesses, shops, restaurants, a theater, schools, a court house and a hospital.

==Places of interest==
In Maaseik many buildings are protected as &quot;Beschermd erfgoed&quot; (National Heritage Sites). Notable are several churches and monasteries, mostly in Baroque and Neoclassical style, and a large number of houses in the local Mosan style. Twelve watermills around Maaseik have been restored, some of which are still functioning and can be visited.

The main church of Maaseik is the Neoclassical &quot;Sint-Catharinakerk&quot; (Church of Saint Catherine), built in 1840–45. The predecessor of this church was for over 300 years the seat of a powerful religious institution, the chapter of Aldeneik, which was originally based at nearby Aldeneik Abbey, but in 1571 moved to Maaseik in order to escape the religious troubles of the period. The canons of Aldeneik took their treasures with them, which can now be seen in the sacristy of Saint Catherine&#x27;s. In Aldeneik, all that remains of the once mighty abbey is the heavily restored &quot;Sint-Annakerk&quot; (Church of Saint Anne).

Several monasteries from the Baroque era have been preserved in Maaseik. The most notable once are the monasteries of the Franciscans, the Capuchins and the Holy Cross Canons. The latter church (&quot;Kruisherenkerk&quot;) has a Rococo interior.

Maaseik, although a small town, boasts of many listed houses, predominantly in Mosan Renaissance style. Most of the houses are built in brick in combination with soft, yellowish Limburg chalk and a much harder, blueish limestone from the Ardennes region, locally called &quot;Naamse steen&quot; (Namur stone). Along Markt, Bosstraat, Hepperstraat and Grote Kerkstraat several beautifully adorned Mosan gables can be seen, many with original gable stones.
===Market square===
The main square and the true centre of Maaseik is the &quot;Markt&quot; (Market Square) with the 19th-century statue of the town&#x27;s famous sons, Jan and Hubert van Eyck. On the North side of the square is the 18th-century town hall and a copy of the old perron, the symbol of judicial freedom of the prince-bishopric of Liège, placed in front of the town hall. The market place is surrounded by old houses, some of which are medieval in core but with 17th or 18th-century gables. Several buildings have been converted into pubs and restaurants and although the tree-lined square is still partly used as a car park, in Summer a number of street terraces give it a lively atmosphere.
===Museums===
*The church of Saint Catharine houses an important church treasure, which was originally in Aldeneik, but was moved to Maaseik in 1571 when the canons of Aldeneik fled to the safety of the walled town. The church treasury holds the oldest Gospel Book of the Benelux, the &quot;Codex Eyckensis&quot;, which dates from the early 8th century. The church treasure also includes ancient textiles, some of which are described as garments belonging to the local saints Herlindis and Relindis, and the oldest known embroidered Anglo-Saxon textiles from the 7th, 8th and 9th century. Other treasures in the museum collection are reliquaries, some dating back to the 9th and 10th century, liturgical vessels made of gold and silver, paraments, and ancient manuscripts.
*The &quot;Regionaal Archeologisch Museum&quot; (RAM) on Markt includes a museum of regional archeology and local history, and a pharmacy museum. The latter is considered the oldest pharmacy in Belgium and has retained most of its original display of Delftware pots and tin jars. Behind the museum is a small herbal garden.
*In the nearby Franciscan monastery the privately owned John Selbach Museum displays collections of art and antique dolls. The building also houses a permanent exhibition about the Van Eyck brothers and a scale model of the town as it was in 1672. The building is also used for large-scale exhibitions (in 2008 the Terracotta Army of Xi&#x27;an and in 2012 treasures from the Tang dynasty).
==Politics==
===City council===
The current city council was elected in the 2018 Belgian local elections. These elections have resulted in a takeover from former opposition party Open VLD who formed a coalition with PRO3680 and N-VA, ousting CD&amp;V from the majority for the first time this century. The new coalition is led by mayor Johan Tollenaere

<doc id="175174" wikidata="Q499604" url="?curid=175174" title="Alken, Belgium">
<text>Alken (; ) is a municipality located in Belgian province of Limburg. The community lies just south of the provincial capital of Hasselt, in the Hesbaye region. Alken has about 11,300 residents, which gives the village a larger population than the nearby small cities of Borgloon and Herk-de-Stad.

== History ==
Alken appeared for the first time in history in 1066 under the name Alleche. Since 1180, the official name of the municipality is Alken but &#x27;Alleke&#x27; is still often used by locals.

Alken was an enclave of the Bishopric of Liège surrounded by the county of Loon. Many Prince Bishops had a summer residence here.

== Village centers ==
The municipality has no districts. But has 3 village centers or major neighborhoods. Alken-Centre, Sint-Joris (St. George) and Terkoest.

Alken-Centre is located in the east of the municipality, neighboring Hasselt and Wellen. The parish is dedicated to St. Aldegondis and it is the oldest parish in Alken. The city hall, the CPAS, most shops and institutions are located here.

Sint-Joris (St. George) is located south of Alken, neighboring Sint-Truiden and Nieuwerkerken. The parish is dedicated to St. George Patron Saint, known from the story of Saint George and the dragon.

Terkoest located in the northwest of the town, neighboring Hasselt and Nieuwerkerken. The name Terkoest comes from an old Dutch word for marshy areas.

A fourth neighborhood in Alken grew around the station, though this station area is not developed into a real village. The station was closed for a while and the local school closed.

==Sights==
Alken is best known for its brewery and the beer brewed there, but also for its many castles, churches, chapels and water mills. In recreational terms, one can indulge in the leisure park &quot;De Alk&quot; between large and the small Herk (river), one can walk in the Mombeek-valley and explore the well-equipped bicycle network.

Alken is located in the most productive fruit cultivation area of Belgium and the area is famous for its blossoming fruit trees filling the landscape.

<text>Herstappe (; ) is a Flemish municipality located in the Belgian province of Limburg. On January 1, 2016, Herstappe had a total population of 89. The total area is 1.35 km2 which gives a population density of 66 inhabitants per km2. It is the least populous municipality in Belgium, and the third smallest in area.

Herstappe has a bilingual (Limburgish and Walloon) population. Formally it is a municipality with linguistic facilities for French speakers, which has so far prevented a merger with neighbouring Tongeren from taking place.

==Public buildings==
The village holds a cafe, a municipal office, a Roman Catholic church and a post office. All have bilingual signposts.

==Elections==
For the Belgian local elections, 2012, Herstappe was the only Belgian municipality where elections were not held as there was only one candidate list. Previously, this had already happened between 1958 and 1994.

==Mayors==
The former mayor from 1994 to 2014, Serge Louwet, was the lowest paid Belgian mayor in 2012 with €675 for his monthly wages. Actually, his official salary is €1,400 but he considered it too high and kept only 675, the rest being given back to the municipal treasurer.

In 2014, Mayor Louwet resigned in favour of Claudy Prosmans. The first action of the new mayor was to guide Herstappe into the digital era. He wanted to buy a computer for the town hall, complete with an internet connection, and they were also looking into the creation of an official website.

Situated close to the &quot;Roman&quot; Tongeren, many traces from the Roman empire were found in the fertile soil of Hoeselt. 
In 1066, this village came under the surveillance of Hoei; it was in that time still named Housle (from &quot;hus&quot; and &quot;lo&quot;, meaning house by the forest). These forests of Hoeselt were cultivated in the 12th and 13th century.

Later, Hoeselt was part of the Frankish Kingdom; and then its territory fell under the Bishop of Liège.

The old centre of Hoeselt, with its triangular shape, and the &quot;motheuvel&quot; (motte hill), both show the influence of its Frankish past.

<doc id="175180" wikidata="Q6516992" url="?curid=175180" title="The Last Messiah">
<text>&quot;The Last Messiah&quot; () is a 1933 essay by the Norwegian philosopher Peter Wessel Zapffe. One of his most significant works, this approximately 10 page long essay would later be expanded upon in Zapffe’s book, &quot;On the Tragic&quot;, and, as a theory describes a reinterpretation of Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s Übermensch. Zapffe believed that existential crisis or angst in humanity was the result of an overly evolved intellect, and that people overcome this by &quot;artificially limiting the content of consciousness.&quot;

==The human condition==
Zapffe views the human condition as tragically overdeveloped, calling it &quot;a biological paradox, an abomination, an absurdity, an exaggeration of disastrous nature.&quot; Zapffe viewed the world as beyond humanity&#x27;s need for meaning, unable to provide any of the answers to the fundamental existential questions.

Throughout the essay, Zapffe alludes to Nietzsche, &quot;the poster case, as it were, of seeing too much for sanity.&quot;

After placing the source of anguish in human intellect, Zapffe then sought as to why humanity simply didn&#x27;t just perish. He concluded humanity &quot;performs, to extend a settled phrase, a more or less self-conscious repression of its damaging surplus of consciousness&quot; and that this was &quot;a requirement of social adaptability and of everything commonly referred to as healthy and normal living.&quot; He provided four defined mechanisms of defense that allowed an individual to overcome their burden of intellect.

==Remedies against panic==

*Isolation is the first method Zapffe noted. It is defined as &quot;a fully arbitrary dismissal from consciousness of all disturbing and destructive thought and feeling&quot;. He cites &quot;One should not think, it is just confusing&quot; as an example.
*Anchoring, according to Zapffe, is the &quot;fixation of points within, or construction of walls around, the liquid fray of consciousness&quot;. The anchoring mechanism provides individuals a value or an ideal that allows them to focus their attentions in a consistent manner. Zapffe compared this mechanism to Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s concept of the life-lie from the play &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;, where the family has achieved a tolerable modus vivendi by ignoring the skeletons and by permitting each member to live in a dreamworld of his own. Zapffe also applied the anchoring principle to society, and stated &quot;God, the Church, the State, morality, fate, the laws of life, the people, the future&quot; are all examples of collective primary anchoring firmaments. He noted flaws in the principle&#x27;s ability to properly address the human condition, and warned against the despair provoked resulting from discovering one&#x27;s anchoring mechanism was false. Another shortcoming of anchoring is conflict between contradicting anchoring mechanisms, which Zapffe posits will bring one to destructive nihilism.
*Distraction is when &quot;one limits attention to the critical bounds by constantly enthralling it with impressions.&quot; Distraction focuses all of one&#x27;s energy on a task or idea to prevent the mind from turning in on itself.
*Sublimation is the refocusing of energy away from negative outlets, toward positive ones.
==The last messiah==
Zapffe concluded that &quot;As long as humankind recklessly proceeds in the fateful delusion of being biologically fated for triumph, nothing essential will change.&quot; Humankind will get increasingly desperate until &#x27;the last messiah&#x27; arrives, &quot;the man who, as the first of all, has dared strip his soul naked and submit it alive to the outmost thought of the lineage, the very idea of doom. A man who has fathomed life and its cosmic ground, and whose pain is the Earth&#x27;s collective pain.&quot; Zapffe compares his messiah to Moses, but ultimately rejects the precept to &quot;be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth,&quot; by saying &quot;Know yourselves – be infertile, and let the earth be silent after ye.&quot;

==Influence==
In his book &quot;The Conspiracy Against the Human Race&quot;, horror writer and philosopher Thomas Ligotti refers frequently to &quot;The Last Messiah&quot; and quotes sections of the essay, using Zapffe&#x27;s work as an example of philosophical pessimism.

<text>Lanaken (; ) is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Limburg. On January 1, 2007, the municipality of Lanaken had a total population of 24,724. Its area is 59.00 km2 which gives a population density of 415 inhabitants per km2.

Lanaken is located on the Belgian-Dutch border, bordering Maastricht directly. In the 2006 census, some 20 percent of the inhabitants turned out to have the Dutch nationality. A number of neighbourhoods in Lanaken is characterized by these immigrants&#x27; numerous villas and exclusive landhouses.

Lanaken consists of the following villages: Lanaken proper, Rekem, Neerharen, Gellik, Veldwezelt, Smeermaas and Kesselt. Also located in Lanaken are the hamlets Briegden and Herbricht and the old village centre Oud-Rekem.

The Veldwezelt-Hezerwater Palaeolithic archaeological site is located in the municipality.

== History ==
Archaeological finds on the territory of Lanaken are known from the Neolithic, Roman and Merovingian periods. There were several Gallo-Roman cemeteries and in Smeermaas was the Gallo-Roman villa of Smeermaas was located.

In the Middle Ages, the domain of Lanaken probably belonged to the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. From the 12th century Lanaken was part of the seigniory of Pietersheim of Loon, whose lords founded the Abbey of Hocht around 1186. In 1106 the patronage right of the parish church was given to the Maastricht chapter of St. Servaas.

In 1808 the present borough was formed, merging Lanaken with Smeermaas, Hocht, Pietersem, Ca(u)berg, Bessemer and Briegden. In 1839, as a result of the Belgian revolution and subsequent Treaty of London, the municipality was split into a Belgian and a Dutch part (Caberg). Caberg then became an independent parish. Smeermaas received its own church in 1870. The borough of Bessemer was later incorporated into the municipality of Zutendaal.

From 1824-1829 the South Willemsvaart was built, and from 1930-1934 the Briegden-Neerharen canal. These canals cut through the territory of Lanaken. In 1856 followed the Hasselt-Maastricht railroad line, which was closed to passenger traffic in 1954.

On October 4, 1914, during World War I, the center of Lanaken was set on fire by the Germans, partly in retaliation for the resistance of a Belgian volunteer group led by Mayor Edgard de Caritat de Peruzzis. The castles of de Caritat de Peruzzis and Alicebourg were then blown up.

On May 10, 1940, during World War II, German planes bombed the barracks of de Caritat de Peruzzis killing Captain-Commander Henri Giddelo and five other soldiers.

In 1957, the Saint Barbara Hospital in Lanaken was established by the Limburg mines to enable research and combat occupational diseases, especially dust lung, which mostly affected the miners of the Kempen coal basin.

On January 1, 1977, Lanaken merged with the surrounding municipalities of Gellik, Neerharen, Rekem and Veldwezelt to form the present municipality of Lanaken.

== Etymology ==
Lanaken was mentioned in 810 as &quot;Ludinaca&quot; and in 1106 as &quot;Lodenaken&quot;. This contains the personal name &quot;Hlodo&quot; or &quot;Ludo&quot; followed by the word &quot;haka&quot;, meaning sand plate.

== Nature and landscape ==
Lanaken is characterized by being located on the southern edge of the Kempen Plateau, separated from the more southern region of Haspengouw by the Albert Canal. To the southeast, Lanaken is cut off from Smeermaas and the Maas basin by the Briegden-Neerharen Canal. Lanaken itself lies at an altitude of about 60 meters, to the northwest one finds steep edges to the plateau, which reaches heights of up to 100 meters, and the deeply cut valleys of the brooks Asbeek and Ziepbeek. This part, which is part of the Hoge Kempen National Park, has marshy lowlands, heaths, and forests, consisting of coniferous forest, once planted for the production of mining wood, and mixed forest. The most famous areas are Pietersembos and Asbroek.

Marked walks through this area start both at Pietersheim Castle and at the parking lot near the Saint-Barbara Hospital.

== Economy ==
Lanaken grew as a result of the presence of railroad and canals, there was commuter traffic to Maastricht, and jobs were created at the Eisden coal mine. Also established were a paper factory (today: Sappi), a rubber factory (today: Hercorub) and a factory for synthetic fibers (Celanese), among others.

In 2006, four 100 meter high wind turbines were built to provide electricity to the Celanese factory. Later on 8 more have been built. 

The South African pulp and paper company Sappi operates a large mill on the outskirts of the town and is an important source of employment for the town&#x27;s residents. In October 2023, Sappi announced the closure of their facility in Lanaken.

Lanaken is part of the Albert Canal Economic Network together with 24 other municipalities through which the canal runs.

== Transportation ==
The reactivation of the former railway Maastricht-Lanaken-Hasselt as a light rail known as the Hasselt – Maastricht tramway as part of the Belgian Spartacus plan was scheduled for 2014. It was later postponed to 2025, to be later canceled in June 2022 and in favour of an electric &quot;trambus&quot; which will start operations in 2024.
