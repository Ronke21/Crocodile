<text>Smilodon is an extinct genus of felids. It is one of the best known saber-toothed predators and prehistoric mammals. Although commonly known as the saber-toothed tiger, it was not closely related to the tiger or other modern cats, belonging to the extinct subfamily Machairodontinae, with an estimated date of divergence from the ancestor of living cats around 20 million years ago. &quot;Smilodon&quot; was one of the last surviving machairodonts alongside &quot;Homotherium&quot;. &quot;Smilodon&quot; lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene to early Holocene epoch (2.5 mya – 8,200 years ago). The genus was named in 1842 based on fossils from Brazil; the generic name means &quot;scalpel&quot; or &quot;two-edged knife&quot; combined with &quot;tooth&quot;. Three species are recognized today: S. gracilis, S. fatalis, and S. populator. The two latter species were probably descended from &quot;S. gracilis&quot;, which itself probably evolved from &quot;Megantereon&quot;. The hundreds of specimens obtained from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles constitute the largest collection of &quot;Smilodon&quot; fossils.

Overall, &quot;Smilodon&quot; was more robustly built than any extant cat, with particularly well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper canine teeth. Its jaw had a bigger gape than that of modern cats, and its upper canines were slender and fragile, being adapted for precision killing. &quot;S. gracilis&quot; was the smallest species at in weight. &quot;S. fatalis&quot; had a weight of and height of . Both of these species are mainly known from North America, but remains from South America have also been attributed to them (primarily from the northwest of the continent). &quot;S. populator&quot; from South America was the largest species, at in weight and in height, and was among the largest known felids. The coat pattern of &quot;Smilodon&quot; is unknown, but it has been artistically restored with plain or spotted patterns.

In North America, &quot;Smilodon&quot; hunted large herbivores such as bison and camels, and it remained successful even when encountering new prey taxa in South America such as &quot;Macrauchenia&quot; and ground sloths. &quot;Smilodon&quot; is thought to have killed its prey by holding it still with its forelimbs and biting it, but it is unclear in what manner the bite itself was delivered. Scientists debate whether &quot;Smilodon&quot; had a social or a solitary lifestyle; analysis of modern predator behavior as well as of &quot;Smilodon&quot;″s fossil remains could be construed to lend support to either view. &quot;Smilodon&quot; probably lived in closed habitats such as forests and bush, which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. &quot;Smilodon&quot; died out shortly after the end-Pleistocene extinction event which occurred around 13-10,000 years ago, along with most other large animals across the Americas. Its reliance on large animals has been proposed as the cause of its extinction. &quot;Smilodon&quot; may have been impacted by habitat turnover and loss of prey it specialized on due to possible climatic impacts, the effects of recently arrived humans on prey populations, and other factors.

== Taxonomy ==

During the 1830s, Danish naturalist Peter Wilhelm Lund and his assistants collected fossils in the calcareous caves near the small town of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Among the thousands of fossils found, he recognized a few isolated cheek teeth as belonging to a hyena, which he named &quot;Hyaena neogaea&quot; in 1839. After more material was found (including incisor teeth and foot bones), Lund concluded the fossils instead belonged to a distinct genus of felids, though transitional to the hyenas. He stated it would have matched the largest modern predators in size, and was more robust than any modern cat. Lund originally wanted to call the new genus &quot;Hyaenodon&quot;, but realizing this name had recently been applied to another prehistoric predator, he instead named it &quot;Smilodon populator&quot; in 1842. He explained the Ancient Greek meaning of &quot;Smilodon&quot; as (&quot;smilē&quot;), &quot;scalpel&quot; or &quot;two-edged knife&quot;, and &quot;οδόντος&quot; (&quot;odóntos&quot;), &quot;tooth&quot;. This has also been translated as &quot;tooth shaped like double-edged knife&quot;. He explained the species name &quot;populator&quot; as &quot;the destroyer&quot;, which has also been translated as &quot;he who brings devastation&quot;. Lund based the name on the shape of the incisors, and the large canine teeth were not known until 1846. By 1846, Lund had acquired nearly every part of the skeleton (from different individuals), and more specimens were found in neighboring countries by other collectors in the following years. Though some later authors used Lund&#x27;s original species name &quot;neogaea&quot; instead of &quot;populator,&quot; it is now considered an invalid &quot;nomen nudum&quot;, as it was not accompanied with a proper description and no type specimens were designated. Some South American specimens have been referred to other genera, subgenera, species, and subspecies, such as &quot;Smilodontidion riggii&quot;, &quot;Smilodon&quot; (&quot;Prosmilodon&quot;) &quot;ensenadensis&quot;, and &quot;S. bonaeriensis&quot;, but these are now thought to be junior synonyms of &quot;S. populator&quot;.

Fossils of &quot;Smilodon&quot; were discovered in North America from the second half of the 19th century onwards. In 1869, American paleontologist Joseph Leidy described a maxilla fragment with a molar, which had been discovered in a petroleum bed in Hardin County, Texas. He referred the specimen to the genus &quot;Felis&quot; (which was then used for most cats, extant as well as extinct) but found it distinct enough to be part of its own subgenus, as &quot;F.&quot; (&quot;Trucifelis&quot;) &quot;fatalis&quot;. The species name means &quot;deadly&quot;. In an 1880 article about extinct American cats, American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope pointed out that the &quot;F. fatalis&quot; molar was identical to that of &quot;Smilodon&quot;, and he proposed the new combination &quot;S. fatalis&quot;. Most North American finds were scanty until excavations began in the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, where hundreds of individuals of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; have been found since 1875. &quot;S. fatalis&quot; has junior synonyms such as &quot;S. mercerii&quot;, &quot;S. floridanus&quot;, and &quot;S. californicus&quot;. American paleontologist Annalisa Berta considered the holotype of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; too incomplete to be an adequate type specimen, and the species has at times been proposed to be a junior synonym of &quot;S. populator&quot;. Nordic paleontologists Björn Kurtén and Lars Werdelin supported the distinctness of the two species in an article published in 1990. A 2018 article by the American paleontologist John P. Babiarz and colleagues concluded that &quot;S. californicus&quot;, represented by the specimens from the La Brea Tar Pits, was a distinct species from &quot;S. fatalis&quot; after all and that more research is needed to clarify the taxonomy of the lineage.

In his 1880 article about extinct cats, Cope also named a third species of &quot;Smilodon&quot;, &quot;S. gracilis&quot;. The species was based on a partial canine, which had been obtained in the Port Kennedy Cave near the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania. Cope found the canine to be distinct from that of the other &quot;Smilodon&quot; species due to its smaller size and more compressed base. Its specific name refers to the species&#x27; lighter build. This species is known from fewer and less complete remains than the other members of the genus. &quot;S. gracilis&quot; has at times been considered part of genera such as &quot;Megantereon&quot; and &quot;Ischyrosmilus&quot;. &quot;S. populator&quot;, &quot;S. fatalis&quot; and &quot;S. gracilis&quot; are currently considered the only valid species of &quot;Smilodon&quot;, and features used to define most of their junior synonyms have been dismissed as variation between individuals of the same species (intraspecific variation). One of the most famous of prehistoric mammals, &quot;Smilodon&quot; has often been featured in popular media and is the state fossil of California.

=== Evolution ===

Long the most completely known saber-toothed cat, &quot;Smilodon&quot; is still one of the best-known members of the group, to the point where the two concepts have been confused. The term &quot;saber-tooth&quot; itself refers to an ecomorph consisting of various groups of extinct predatory synapsids (mammals and close relatives), which convergently evolved extremely long maxillary canines, as well as adaptations to the skull and skeleton related to their use. This includes members of Gorgonopsia, Thylacosmilidae, Machaeroidinae, Nimravidae, Barbourofelidae, and Machairodontinae. Within the family Felidae (true cats), members of the subfamily Machairodontinae are referred to as saber-toothed cats, and this group is itself divided into three tribes: Metailurini (false saber-tooths); Homotherini (scimitar-toothed cats); and Smilodontini (dirk-toothed cats), to which &quot;Smilodon&quot; belongs.

Members of Smilodontini are defined by their long slender canines with fine to no serrations, whereas Homotherini are typified by shorter, broad, and more flattened canines, with coarser serrations. Members of Metailurini were less specialized and had shorter, less flattened canines, and are not recognized as members of Machairodontinae by some researchers.

Despite the colloquial name &quot;saber-toothed tiger&quot;, &quot;Smilodon&quot; is not closely related to the modern tiger (which belongs in the subfamily Pantherinae), or any other extant felid. A 1992 ancient DNA analysis suggested that &quot;Smilodon&quot; should be grouped with modern cats (subfamilies Felinae and Pantherinae). A 2005 study found that &quot;Smilodon&quot; belonged to a separate lineage. A study published in 2006 confirmed this, showing that the Machairodontinae diverged early from the ancestors of living cats and were not closely related to any living species. The ancestors of living cats and Machairodontinae estimated to have diverged around 20 million years ago. The following cladogram based on fossils and DNA analysis shows the placement of &quot;Smilodon&quot; among extinct and extant felids, after Rincón and colleagues, 2011:

The earliest felids are known from the Oligocene of Europe, such as &quot;Proailurus&quot;, and the earliest one with saber-tooth features is the Miocene genus &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot;. The skull and mandible morphology of the earliest saber-toothed cats was similar to that of the modern clouded leopards (&quot;Neofelis&quot;). The lineage further adapted to the precision killing of large animals by developing elongated canine teeth and wider gapes, in the process sacrificing high bite force. As their canines became longer, the bodies of the cats became more robust for immobilizing prey. In derived smilodontins and homotherins, the lumbar region of the spine and the tail became shortened, as did the hind limbs. Machairodonts once represented a dominant group of felids distributed across Africa, Eurasia and the North America during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, but progressively declined over the course of the Pleistocene, by the Late Pleistocene, only two genera of machairodonts remained, &quot;Smilodon&quot;, and the distantly related &quot;Homotherium&quot;, both largely confined to the Americas. Based on mitochondrial DNA sequences extracted from ancient bones, the lineages of &quot;Homotherium&quot; and &quot;Smilodon&quot; are estimated to have diverged about 18 million years ago.

The earliest species of &quot;Smilodon&quot; is &quot;S. gracilis&quot;, which existed from 2.5 million to 500,000 years ago (early Blancan to Irvingtonian ages) and was the successor in North America of &quot;Megantereon&quot;, from which it probably evolved. &quot;Megantereon&quot; itself had entered North America from Eurasia during the Pliocene, along with &quot;Homotherium&quot;. &quot;S. gracilis&quot; reached the northern regions of South America in the Early Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange. &quot;S. fatalis&quot; existed 1.6 million–10,000 years ago (late Irvingtonian to Rancholabrean ages), and replaced &quot;S. gracilis&quot; in North America. &quot;S. populator&quot; existed 1 million–10,000 years ago (Ensenadan to Lujanian ages); it occurred in the eastern parts of South America.

== Description ==
=== Skeleton ===
&quot;Smilodon&quot; was around the size of modern big cats, but was more robustly built. It had a reduced lumbar region, high scapula, short tail, and broad limbs with relatively short feet. &quot;Smilodon&quot; is most famous for its relatively long canine teeth, which are the longest found in the saber-toothed cats, at about long in the largest species, &quot;S. populator&quot;. The canines were slender and had fine serrations on the front and back side. The skull was robustly proportioned and the muzzle was short and broad. The cheek bones (zygomata) were deep and widely arched, the sagittal crest was prominent, and the frontal region was slightly convex. The mandible had a flange on each side of the front. The upper incisors were large, sharp, and slanted forwards. There was a diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars of the mandible. The lower incisors were broad, recurved, and placed in a straight line across. The p3 premolar tooth of the mandible was present in most early specimens, but lost in later specimens; it was only present in 6% of the La Brea sample. There is some dispute over whether &quot;Smilodon&quot; was sexually dimorphic. Some studies of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; fossils have found little difference between the sexes. Conversely, a 2012 study found that, while fossils of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; show less variation in size among individuals than modern &quot;Panthera&quot;, they do appear to show the same difference between the sexes in some traits.

&quot;S. gracilis&quot; was the smallest species, estimated at in weight, about the size of a jaguar. It was similar to its predecessor &quot;Megantereon&quot; of the same size, but its dentition and skull were more advanced, approaching &quot;S. fatalis&quot;. &quot;S. fatalis&quot; was intermediate in size between &quot;S. gracilis&quot; and &quot;S. populator&quot;. It ranged from . and reached a shoulder height of and body length of . It was similar to a lion in dimensions, but was more robust and muscular, and therefore had a larger body mass. Its skull was also similar to that of &quot;Megantereon&quot;, though more massive and with larger canines. &quot;S. populator&quot; was among the largest known felids, with a body mass range from to over , and one estimate suggesting up to . A particularly large &quot;S. populator&quot; skull from Uruguay measuring in length indicates this individual may have weighed as much as . It stood at a shoulder height of . Compared to &quot;S. fatalis&quot;, &quot;S. populator&quot; was more robust and had a more elongated and narrow skull with a straighter upper profile, higher positioned nasal bones, a more vertical occiput, more massive metapodials and slightly longer forelimbs relative to hindlimbs. Large fossil tracks from Argentina (for which the ichnotaxon name &quot;Smilodonichium&quot; has been proposed) have been attributed to &quot;S. populator&quot;, and measure by . This is larger than tracks of the Bengal tiger, to which the footprints have been compared.

===External features===

&quot;Smilodon&quot; and other saber-toothed cats have been reconstructed with both plain-colored coats and with spotted patterns (which appears to be the ancestral condition for feliforms), both of which are considered possible. Studies of modern cat species have found that species that live in the open tend to have uniform coats while those that live in more vegetated habitats have more markings, with some exceptions. Some coat features, such as the manes of male lions or the stripes of the tiger, are too unusual to predict from fossils.

Traditionally, saber-toothed cats have been artistically restored with external features similar to those of extant felids, by artists such as Charles R. Knight in collaboration with various paleontologists in the early 20th century. In 1969, paleontologist G. J. Miller instead proposed that &quot;Smilodon&quot; would have looked very different from a typical cat and similar to a bulldog, with a lower lip line (to allow its mouth to open wide without tearing the facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower-placed ears. Paleoartist Mauricio Antón and coauthors disputed this in 1998 and maintained that the facial features of &quot;Smilodon&quot; were overall not very different from those of other cats. Antón noted that modern animals like the hippopotamus are able to open their mouths extremely wide without tearing tissue due to a folded orbicularis oris muscle, and such a muscle arrangement exists in modern large felids. Antón stated that extant phylogenetic bracketing (where the features of the closest extant relatives of a fossil taxon are used as reference) is the most reliable way of restoring the life-appearance of prehistoric animals, and the cat-like &quot;Smilodon&quot; restorations by Knight are therefore still accurate. A 2022 study by Antón and colleagues concluded that the upper canines of &quot;Smilodon&quot; would have been visible when the mouth was closed, while those of &quot;Homotherium&quot; would have not, after examining fossils and extant big cats.

== Paleobiology ==

=== Diet ===

An apex predator, &quot;Smilodon&quot; primarily hunted large mammals. Isotopes preserved in the bones of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; in the La Brea Tar Pits reveal that ruminants like bison (&quot;Bison antiquus&quot;, which was much larger than the modern American bison) and camels (&quot;Camelops&quot;) were most commonly taken by the cats there. 
&quot;Smilodon fatalis&quot; may have also occasionally preyed upon &quot;Glyptotherium&quot;, based on a skull from a juvenile &quot;Glyptotherium texanum&quot; recovered from Pleistocene deposits in Arizona that bear the distinctive elliptical puncture marks best matching those of &quot;Smilodon&quot;, indicating that the predator successfully bit into the skull through the glyptodont&#x27;s armored cephalic shield. In addition, isotopes preserved in the tooth enamel of &quot;S. gracilis&quot; specimens from Florida show that this species fed on the peccary &quot;Platygonus&quot; and the llama-like &quot;Hemiauchenia&quot;. Stable carbon isotope measurements of &quot;S. gracilis&quot; remains in Florida varied significantly between different sites and show that the species was flexible in its feeding habits. Isotopic studies of dire wolf (&quot;Aenocyon dirus&quot;) and American lion (&quot;Panthera atrox&quot;) bones show an overlap with &quot;S. fatalis&quot; in prey, which suggests that they were competitors. More detailed isotope analysis however, indicates that &quot;Smilodon fatalis&quot; preferred forest-dwelling prey such as tapirs, deer and forest-dwelling bison as opposed to the dire wolves&#x27; preferences for prey inhabiting open areas such as grassland. The availability of prey in the Rancho La Brea area was likely comparable to modern East Africa.
As &quot;Smilodon&quot; migrated to South America, its diet changed; bison were absent, the horses and proboscideans were different, and native ungulates such as toxodonts and litopterns were completely unfamiliar, yet &quot;S. populator&quot; thrived as well there as its relatives in North America. Isotopic analysis for &quot;S. populator&quot; suggests that its main prey species included the camel like litoptern ungulate &quot;Macrauchenia&quot;, the rhinoceros-like ungulate &quot;Toxodon platensis&quot;, the large armadillo relatives &quot;Pachyarmatherium&quot;, &quot;Holmesina&quot;, species of the glyptodont genus &quot;Panochthus&quot;, the llama &quot;Palaeolama&quot;, the ground sloth &quot;Catonyx&quot;, and the equine &quot;Equus neogeus&quot;, and the crocodilian &quot;Caiman latirostris&quot;. This analysis of its diet also indicates that &quot;S. populator&quot; hunted both in open and forested habitats. Regressions suggests that a &quot;S. populator&quot; is capable of taking on prey up to .

The differences between the North and South American species may be due to the difference in prey between the two continents. &quot;Smilodon&quot; may have avoided eating bone and would have left enough food for scavengers. Coprolites assigned to &quot;S. populator&quot; recovered from Argentina preserve osteoderms from the ground sloth &quot;Mylodon&quot; and a &quot;Lama&quot; scaphoid bone. In addition to this unambiguous evidence of bone consumption, the coprolites suggest that &quot;Smilodon&quot; had a more generalist diet than previously thought. Examinations of dental microwear from La Brea further suggests that &quot;Smilodon&quot; consumed both flesh and bone. &quot;Smilodon&quot; itself may have scavenged dire wolf kills. It has been suggested that &quot;Smilodon&quot; was a pure scavenger that used its canines for display to assert dominance over carcasses, but this theory is not supported today as no modern terrestrial mammals are pure scavengers.

=== Predatory behavior ===
The brain of &quot;Smilodon&quot; had sulcal patterns similar to modern cats, which suggests an increased complexity of the regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. Felid saber-tooths in general had relatively small eyes that were not as forward-facing as those of modern cats, which have good binocular vision to help them move in trees. &quot;Smilodon&quot; was likely an ambush predator that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar to modern forest-dwelling cats, and its short tail would not have helped it balance while running. Unlike its ancestor &quot;Megantereon&quot;, which was at least partially scansorial and therefore able to climb trees, &quot;Smilodon&quot; was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack of climbing adaptations. Tracks from Argentina named &quot;Felipeda miramarensis&quot; in 2019 may have been produced by &quot;Smilodon&quot;. If correctly identified, the tracks indicate that the animal had fully retractible claws, plantigrade feet, lacked strong supination capabilities in its paws, notably robust forelimbs compared to the hindlimbs, and was probably an ambush predator.

The heel bone of &quot;Smilodon&quot; was fairly long, which suggests it was a good jumper. Its well-developed flexor and extensor muscles in its forearms probably enabled it to pull down, and securely hold down, large prey. Analysis of the cross-sections of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; humeri indicated that they were strengthened by cortical thickening to such an extent that they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. The humerus cortical wall in &quot;S. fatalis&quot; was a 15 % thicker than excpected in modern big cats of similar size. The thickening of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; femurs was within the range of extant felids. Its canines were fragile by the sides due to their flattened shape and could not have bitten into bone; due to the risk of breaking, these cats had to subdue and restrain their prey with their powerful forelimbs before they could use their canine teeth, and likely used quick slashing or stabbing bites rather than the slow, suffocating bites typically used by modern cats. On rare occasions, as evidenced by fossils, &quot;Smilodon&quot; was willing to risk biting into bone with its canines. This may have been focused more towards competition such as other &quot;Smilodon&quot; or potential threats such as other carnivores than on prey. The bending force applied from the back to front of a &quot;S. fatalis&quot; upper canine required to break it, has been estimated to be of 7000 Newtons, in comparison, in lions and tigers, two predators of similar size, a bending force of 8243 and 7440 Newtons, respectively, would be required.

Debate continues as to how &quot;Smilodon&quot; killed its prey. Traditionally, the most popular theory is that the cat delivered a deep stabbing bite or open-jawed stabbing thrust to the throat, killing the prey very quickly. Another hypothesis suggests that &quot;Smilodon&quot; targeted the belly of its prey. This is disputed, as the curvature of their prey&#x27;s belly would likely have prevented the cat from getting a good bite or stab. In regard to how &quot;Smilodon&quot; delivered its bite, the &quot;canine shear-bite&quot; hypothesis has been favored, where flexion of the neck and rotation of the skull assisted in biting the prey, but this may be mechanically impossible. However, evidence from comparisons with &quot;Homotherium&quot; suggest that &quot;Smilodon&quot; was fully capable of and utilized the canine shear-bite as its primary means of killing prey, based on the fact that it had a thick skull and relatively little trabecular bone, while &quot;Homotherium&quot; had both more trabecular bone and a more lion-like clamping bite as its primary means of attacking prey. The discovery, made by Figueirido and Lautenschlager &quot;et al.,&quot; published in 2018 suggests extremely different ecological adaptations in both machairodonts. The mandibular flanges may have helped resist bending forces when the mandible was pulled against the hide of a prey animal. It has been experimentally proven by means of a machine that recreates the teeth, and simulates the movements of jaws and neck of &quot;Smilodon fatalis&quot; (The &quot;Robocat&quot;) on bison and elk carcasses, that the stabbing bite to the throat is a much more plausible and practical killing technique than the stabbing bite to the belly.
The protruding incisors were arranged in an arch, and were used to hold the prey still and stabilize it while the canine bite was delivered. The contact surface between the canine crown and the gum was enlarged, which helped stabilize the tooth and helped the cat sense when the tooth had penetrated to its maximum extent. Since saber-toothed cats generally had a relatively large infraorbital foramen (opening) in the skull, which housed nerves associated with the whiskers, it has been suggested the improved senses would have helped the cats&#x27; precision when biting outside their field of vision, and thereby prevent breakage of the canines. The blade-like carnassial teeth were used to cut skin to access the meat, and the reduced molars suggest that they were less adapted for crushing bones than modern cats. As the food of modern cats enters the mouth through the side while cutting with the carnassials, not the front incisors between the canines, the animals do not need to gape widely, so the canines of &quot;Smilodon&quot; would likewise not have been a hindrance when feeding. A study published in 2022 of how machairodonts fed revealed that wear patterns on the teeth of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; also suggest that it was capable of eating bone to a similar extent as lions. This and comparisons with bite marks left by the contemporary machairodont &quot;Xenosmilus&quot; suggest that &quot;Smilodon&quot; and its relatives could efficiently de-flesh a carcass of meat when feeding without being hindered by their long canines.

Despite being more powerfully built than other large cats, &quot;Smilodon&quot; had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more pronounced zygomatic arches, while these were smaller in &quot;Smilodon&quot;, which restricted the thickness and therefore power of the temporalis muscles and thus reduced &quot;Smilodon&quot;″s bite force. Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates that it could produce a bite only a third as strong as that of a lion (the bite force quotient measured for the lion is 112). There seems to be a general rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine bending strength (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats&#x27; teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern big cats. In addition, &quot;Smilodon&quot; gape could have reached over 110 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This made the gape wide enough to allow &quot;Smilodon&quot; to grasp large prey despite the long canines. A 2018 study compared the killing behavior of &quot;Smilodon fatalis&quot; and &quot;Homotherium serum&quot;, and found that the former had a strong skull with little trabecular bone for a stabbing canine-shear bite, whereas the latter had more trabecular bone and used a clamp and hold style more similar to lions. The two would therefore have held distinct ecological niches. The supplementary materials of a 2020 study suggested &quot;S. gracilis&quot; and &quot;S. populator&quot; had a jaw gape of 89.13 and 82.05 degrees respectively.

By finding of correlation between relative cribriform plate size and repertoire of functional olfactory receptor genes, it was found that &quot;S. fatalis&quot; had a slightly smaller repertoire than modern felids with 600 olfatory receptor genes, compared to 677 of a domestic cat. This indicates that &quot;S. fatalis&quot; used less olfaction for its daily activities than modern felids.

=== Natural traps ===
Many &quot;Smilodon&quot; specimens have been excavated from asphalt seeps that acted as natural carnivore traps. Animals were accidentally trapped in the seeps and became bait for predators that came to scavenge, but these were then trapped themselves. The best-known of such traps are at La Brea in Los Angeles, which have produced over 166,000 &quot;Smilodon fatalis&quot; specimens that form the largest collection in the world. The sediments of the pits there were accumulated 40,000 to 10,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene. Though the trapped animals were buried quickly, predators often managed to remove limb bones from them, but they were themselves often trapped and then scavenged by other predators; 90% of the excavated bones belonged to predators.

The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru represent a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of &quot;Smilodon&quot;. Unlike in La Brea, many of the bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of &quot;Smilodon&quot; and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these are probably the result of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones to the floor of the cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.

=== Social life ===
Scientists debate whether &quot;Smilodon&quot; was social. One study of African predators found that social predators like lions and spotted hyenas respond more to the distress calls of prey than solitary species. Since &quot;S. fatalis&quot; fossils are common at the La Brea Tar Pits, and were likely attracted by the distress calls of stuck prey, this could mean that this species was social as well. One critical study claims that the study neglects other factors, such as body mass (heavier animals are more likely to get stuck than lighter ones), intelligence (some social animals, like the American lion, may have avoided the tar because they were better able to recognize the hazard), lack of visual and olfactory lures, the type of audio lure, and the length of the distress calls (the actual distress calls of the trapped prey animals would have lasted longer than the calls used in the study). The author of that study ponders what predators would have responded if the recordings were played in India, where the otherwise solitary tigers are known to aggregate around a single carcass. The authors of the original study responded that though effects of the calls in the tar pits and the playback experiments would not be identical, this would not be enough to overturn their conclusions. In addition, they stated that weight and intelligence would not likely affect the results as lighter carnivores are far more numerous than heavy herbivores and the social (and seemingly intelligent) dire wolf is also found in the pits. However, they do not rule out the possibility that &quot;Smilodon&quot; may have been solitary in part of its distribution.
Another argument for sociality is based on the healed injuries in several &quot;Smilodon&quot; fossils, which would suggest that the animals needed others to provide them food. This argument has been questioned, as cats can recover quickly from even severe bone damage and an injured &quot;Smilodon&quot; could survive if it had access to water. However, a &quot;Smilodon&quot; suffering hip dysplasia at a young age that survived to adulthood suggests that it could not have survived to adulthood without aid from a social group, as this individual was unable to hunt or defend its territory due to the severity of its congenital issue. The brain of &quot;Smilodon&quot; was relatively small compared to other cat species. Some researchers have argued that &quot;Smilodon&quot; brain would have been too small for it to have been a social animal. An analysis of brain size in living big cats found no correlation between brain size and sociality. Another argument against &quot;Smilodon&quot; being social is that being an ambush hunter in closed habitat would likely have made group-living unnecessary, as in most modern cats. Yet it has also been proposed that being the largest predator in an environment comparable to the savanna of Africa, &quot;Smilodon&quot; may have had a social structure similar to modern lions, which possibly live in groups primarily to defend optimal territory from other lions (lions are the only social big cats today).
Whether &quot;Smilodon&quot; was sexually dimorphic has implications for its reproductive behavior. Based on their conclusions that &quot;Smilodon fatalis&quot; had no sexual dimorphism, Van Valkenburgh and Sacco suggested in 2002 that, if the cats were social, they would likely have lived in monogamous pairs (along with offspring) with no intense competition among males for females. Likewise, Meachen-Samuels and Binder concluded in 2010 that aggression between males was less pronounced in &quot;S. fatalis&quot; than in the American lion. Christiansen and Harris found in 2012 that, as &quot;S. fatalis&quot; did exhibit some sexual dimorphism, there would have been evolutionary selection for competition between males. Some bones show evidence of having been bitten by other &quot;Smilodon&quot;, possibly the result of territorial battles, competition for breeding rights or over prey. Two &quot;S. populator&quot; skulls from Argentina show seemingly fatal, unhealed wounds which appear to have been caused by the canines of another &quot;Smilodon&quot; (though it cannot be ruled out they were caused by kicking prey). If caused by intraspecific fighting, it may also indicate that they had social behavior which could lead to death, as seen in some modern felines (as well as indicating that the canines could penetrate bone). It has been suggested that the exaggerated canines of saber-toothed cats evolved for sexual display and competition, but a statistical study of the correlation between canine and body size in &quot;S. populator&quot; found no difference in scaling between body and canine size concluded it was more likely they evolved solely for a predatory function.

A set of three associated skeletons of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; found in Ecuador and described in 2021 by Reynolds, Seymour, and Evans suggests that there was prolonged parental care in &quot;Smilodon&quot;. The two subadult individuals uncovered share a unique inherited trait in their dentaries, suggesting they were siblings; a rare instance of familial relationships being found in the fossil record. The subadult specimens are also hypothesized to have been male and female, respectively, while the adult skeletal remains found at the site are believed to have belonged to their mother. The subadults were estimated to have been around two years of age at the time of their deaths, but were still growing. 

Different results in isotopic analysis studies may suggest &quot;S. populator&quot; social behavior varied depending on the locality. In the Pampean region of Argentina, &quot;Smilodon&quot; may have lived a gregarious lifestyle due tight clustering of isotopic values, which may suggest collective behavior. While in the Brazilian intertropical region, this species lived a more solitary lifestyle due to the lower percentage of prey in the optimum body mass interval, as gregarious predators have at least 65% of their prey within optimum body mass interval. 

&quot;S. fatalis&quot; had proportionally larger hyoid bones than modern felid species and thus likely produced deeper vocalizations. While &quot;Smilodon&quot; had the same number of hyoid bones as the &quot;roaring&quot; cats, their shape was closer to that of &quot;purring&quot; species.

=== Development ===
&quot;Smilodon&quot; started developing its adult saber-teeth when the animal reached between 12 and 19 months of age, shortly after the completion of the eruption of the cat&#x27;s baby teeth. Both baby and adult canines would be present side by side in the mouth for an approximately 11-month period, and the muscles used in making the powerful bite were developed at about one-and-a-half years old as well, eight months earlier than in a modern lion. After &quot;Smilodon&quot; reached 23 to 30 months of age, the infant teeth were shed while the adult canines grew at an average growth rate of per month during a 12-month period. They reached their full size at around 3 years of age, later than modern species of big cats. Juvenile and adolescent &quot;Smilodon&quot; specimens are extremely rare at Rancho La Brea, where the study was performed, indicating that they remained hidden or at denning sites during hunts, and depended on parental care while their canines were developing. 

A 2024 study found evidence that adolescent &quot;Smilodon&quot; kept their milk sabers for extended periods (estimated at 30 months) to help reinforce their adult canines as they grew in. As a result, the milk sabers acted as a structural support, allowing them to begin hunting with minimized risk to their mature set of sabers. As a result, the retention of the cat&#x27;s milk sabers lessened the bending strain on the cat&#x27;s emerging adult teeth as it bit down, as it was discovered the erupting sabers were much more vulnerable to breakage as they grew in than when matured. This would have also resulted in &quot;Smilodon&quot; being &quot;double-fanged&quot; during this growth stage, as corroborated by the discovery of individuals at this ontogenic stage at Rancho La Brea.

A 2017 study indicates that juveniles were born with a robust build similar to the adults. Comparison of the bones of juvenile &quot;S. fatalis&quot; specimens from La Brea with those of the contemporaneous American lion revealed that the two cats shared a similar growth curve. Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids. Examinations by Reynolds, Seymour, and Evans (2021) suggest that &quot;Smilodon&quot; had a unique and fast growth rate similar to a tiger, but that there was a prolonged period of growth in the genus similar to what is seen in lions, and that the cubs were reliant on their parents until this growth period ended.

=== Paleopathology ===
Several &quot;Smilodon&quot; fossils show signs of ankylosing spondylitis, hyperostosis and trauma. One study of 1,000 &quot;Smilodon&quot; skulls found that 36% of them had eroded parietal bones, which is where the largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when &quot;Smilodon&quot; attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey.

The frequency of trauma in &quot;S. fatalis&quot; specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. &quot;Smilodon&quot; remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries. A 2023 study documented a high degree of subchondral defects in limb-joint surfaces of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; and dire wolf specimens from the La Brea Tar pits that resembled osteochondrosis dissecans. As modern dogs with this disease are inbred, the researchers suggested this would have been the case for the prehistoric species as well as they approached extinction, but cautioned that more research was needed to determine if this was also the case in specimens from other parts of the Americas.

Osteomyelitis in the left fourth metacarpal bone has been reported in a &quot;S. populator&quot; specimen dating back to Marine Isotope Stage 5. This pathology resulted in the machairodont individual becoming incapable of flexing its toe and would have severely diminished its ability to hunt prey.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Smilodon&quot; lived during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya–10,000 years ago), and was perhaps the most recent of the saber-toothed cats. &quot;S. fatalis&quot; lived in a variety of habitats, being able to inhabit open grassland and parkland, marginal woodland-grassland settings, and closed forests. Fossils of the genus have been found throughout the Americas. The northernmost remains of the genus are &quot;S. fatalis&quot; fossils from Alberta, Canada, with the southernmost remains of &quot;S. populator&quot; being known from the far south of Patagonia, near the Strait of Magellan. The habitat of North America varied from subtropical forests and savannah in the south, to treeless mammoth steppes in the north. The mosaic vegetation of woods, shrubs, and grasses in southwestern North America supported large herbivores such as horses, bison, antelope, deer, camels, mammoths, mastodons, and ground sloths. North America also supported other saber-toothed cats, such as &quot;Homotherium&quot; and &quot;Xenosmilus&quot;, as well as other large carnivores including dire wolves, short-faced bear (&quot;Arctodus simus&quot;) and the American lion. Competition from such carnivores may have prevented North American &quot;S. fatalis&quot; from attaining the size of South America&#x27;s &quot;S. populator&quot;. The similarity in size of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; and the American lion suggests niche overlap and direct competition between these species, and they appear to have fed on similarly sized prey.
&quot;S. gracilis&quot; entered South America during the early to middle Pleistocene, where it probably gave rise to &quot;S. populator&quot;, which lived in the eastern part of the continent. &quot;S. fatalis&quot; also entered western South America in the late Pleistocene, and the two species were thought to be divided by the Andes mountains. However, in 2018, a skull of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; found in Uruguay east of the Andes was reported, which puts the idea that the two species were allopatric (geographically separated) into question. The American interchange resulted in a mix of native and invasive species sharing the prairies and woodlands in South America; North American herbivores included proboscideans, horses, camelids and deer, South American herbivores included toxodonts, litopterns, ground sloths, and glyptodonts. The native metatherian predators, the Sparassodonta, had gone extinct by the Pliocene, and were replaced by North American carnivores such as canids, bears, and large cats.

&quot;S. populator&quot; may have been able to reach larger size than &quot;S. fatalis&quot; due to a lack of competition in Pleistocene South America; &quot;S. populator&quot; arrived after the extinction of &quot;Arctotherium angustidens&quot;, one of the largest carnivores ever, and could therefore assume the niche of mega-carnivore. &quot;S. populator&quot; preferred large prey from open habitats such as grassland and plains, based on evidence gathered from isotope ratios that determined the animal&#x27;s diet. In this way, the South American &quot;Smilodon&quot; species was probably similar to the modern lion. &quot;S. populator&quot; probably competed with the canid &quot;Protocyon&quot; there, but not with the jaguar, which fed primarily on smaller prey. On the other hand, morphometry points to &quot;S. populator&quot; being best adapted for more closed environments.

== Extinction ==
Along with most of the New World Pleistocene megafauna, &quot;Smilodon&quot; became extinct by 10,000 years ago in the late Pleistocene extinction phases of North and South America. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores. Hence, &quot;Smilodon&quot; could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. Indeed, by the Bølling–Allerød warming event and before the Younger Dryas cooling event, &quot;S. fatalis&quot; showed changes in cranial morphology that hint towards increased specialization in larger prey and/or evolution in response to competition with other carnivores. However, a 2012 study of &quot;Smilodon&quot; tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (who entered the Americas around the time &quot;Smilodon&quot; disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Late Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats. One factor often cited here is the cooling in the Younger Dryas, which may have drastically reduced the habitable space for many species. In terms of human influence, there is evidence of a fire-induced regime change in Rancho la Brea that preceded the extirpation of megafauna in the area, with humans most likely responsible for the increase in fire intensity.

Writers of the first half of the twentieth century theorized that the last saber-toothed cats, &quot;Smilodon&quot; and &quot;Homotherium&quot;, became extinct through competition with the faster and more generalized felids that replaced them. It was even proposed that the saber-toothed predators were inferior to modern cats, as the ever-growing canines were thought to inhibit their owners from feeding properly. Since then, however, it has been shown that the diet of machairodontines such as &quot;Smilodon&quot; and &quot;Homotherium&quot; was diverse. They do not seem to have been limited to giant animals as prey, as suggested before, but fed on whatever was available, including bovines, equines and camelids. Additionally, non-machairodontine felids such as the American lion and &quot;Miracinonyx&quot; also became extinct during the Late Pleistocene, and saber-toothed and conical toothed felids had formerly coexisted for more than a million years. The fact that saber-teeth evolved many times in unrelated lineages also attests to the success of this feature.

The youngest direct radiocarbon date for &quot;S. fatalis&quot; differs from that of &quot;S. populator&quot; by thousands of years, the former just before the Younger Dryas cooling event and the latter by the early Holocene. The latest &quot;S. populator&quot; specimen from the Jirau Paleontological Site has been dated to 8,189–9,079 years cal. Before Present (BP), while the latest &quot;S. fatalis&quot; specimen recovered from the Rancho La Brea tar pits has been dated to 13,025 years ago. A specimen of &quot;S. fatalis&quot; from Iowa dates to 13,605–13,455 years Before Present (BP). &quot;Smilodon populator&quot; remains found in the cave of Cueva del Medio, near the town of Soria, northeast Última Esperanza Province, Magallanes Region in southernmost Chile have been dated to 10,935–11,209 years ago. The most recent credible carbon-14 date for &quot;S. fatalis&quot; has been given as 11,130 BP. However, such radiocarbon dates are likely uncalibrated, meaning that they were not adjusted from calendar years to regular years. As a result, the dates appear younger than they actually are. Therefore, the &quot;S. fatalis&quot; specimen from Rancho La Brea is the youngest-recorded of the species, suggesting extinction before the Younger Dryas based on its last appearance in California as opposed to other regions where megafauna declined by the Younger Dryas.

<text>Homotherium is an extinct genus of scimitar-toothed cat belonging to the extinct subfamily Machairodontinae that inhabited North America, Eurasia, and Africa, as well as possibly South America during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs from around 4 million to 12,000 years ago. It was one of the last surviving members of the subfamily alongside the more famous sabertooth &quot;Smilodon&quot;, to which it was not particularly closely related. It was a large cat, comparable in size to a lion, functioning as an apex predator in the ecosystems it inhabited. In comparison to &quot;Smilodon&quot;, the canines of &quot;Homotherium&quot; were shorter (though still longer than those of living cats), and it is suggested to have had a different ecology from &quot;Smilodon&quot; as a pursuit predator adapted to running down large prey in open habitats, with &quot;Homotherium&quot; also proposed to have likely engaged in cooperative hunting.

==Research history and taxonomy==
=== Eurasia ===
The first fossils of this genus were scientifically described in 1846 by Richard Owen as the species &quot;Machairodus latidens,&quot; based on Pleistocene aged canine teeth found in Kent’s Cavern in Devon, England by the Reverend John MacEnery in 1826. The name &quot;Homotherium&quot; (Greek: (, &#x27;same&#x27;) and (, &#x27;beast&#x27;)) was proposed by Emilio Fabrini in 1890, without further explanation, for a new subgenus of &quot;Machairodus&quot;, whose main distinguishing feature was the presence of a large diastema between the two inferior premolars. He further described two species in this new subgenus: &quot;Machairodus (Meganthereon) crenatidens&quot; and &quot;Machairodus (Meganthereon) nestianus&quot; for remains found in Italy. The genus name itself was rarely used in the scientific literature until the late 1940s. In 1918, the species &quot;Homotherium moravicum&quot; was described by Josef Woldřich based on remains found in what is now the Czech Republic. In 1936, Teilhard de Chardin described the new species &quot;Homotherium ultimus&quot; based on fossils from the Middle Pleistocene-aged Zhoukoudian cave complex near Beijing in northern China. In 1972, a species &quot;Homotherium davitashvili&quot; was described based on fragmentary material found at Kvabebi in Georgia. Other material from Odessa in Ukraine was tentatively assigned to this species in 2004. In 1986, the species &quot;Homotherium darvasicum&quot; was described by Scharif Scharapov based on material from Kuruksay, Tajikistan. In 1989, another species &quot;Homotherium tielhardipiveteaui&quot; was named by Scharapov based on fossils also found in Tajikistan. In 1996, &quot;Homotherium hengduanshanense&quot; was described based on fossils from the Hengduan Mountains of southwestern China.

A 2014 review recognised only one species of &quot;Homotherium&quot; in Eurasia during the Late Pliocene-Pleistocene, &quot;Homotherium latidens.&quot; Other named &quot;Homotherium&quot; species from this time period were found not to be distinct. Across time and space, the remains of &quot;H. latidens&quot; display considerable morphological variability, though there does not appear to be any clear pattern in this variation temporally or geographically (with the exception of the presence of &quot;pocketing&quot; of the margin of the masseteric fossa of the mandible appearing in Middle and Late Pleistocene &quot;H. latidens&quot;, but not earlier ones), with the morphological variation of the entire span of &quot;Homotherium&quot; in Eurasia from the Late Pliocene to the Late Pleistocene being similar to the variation found at the large sample for individuals from the Incarcal locality from the Early Pleistocene of Spain, supporting a single valid species. Some authors have continued to recognise &quot;Homotherium crenatidens&quot; as a valid, pan-Eurasian species chronologically earlier than &quot;H. latidens&quot;.

=== Africa ===
In 1947, Camille Arambourg described remains of &quot;Homotherium&quot; from Ethiopia. This publication helped popularise the genus &quot;Homotherium&quot;, which was little used prior.

In 1972 the species &quot;Homotherium problematicum&quot; (originally &quot;Megantereon problematicus&quot;) was named based on fragmentary material from the Makapansgat locality in South Africa, of late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene age. A second African species discovered in the Pliocene aged Hadar Formation of the Afar region of Ethiopia, &quot;Homotherium hadarensis&quot;, was described in 1988. In 2015, further material from the Hadar Formation was tentatively referred to &quot;H. hadarensis&quot;. A third species, &quot;Homotherium africanum&quot; (originally &quot;Machairodus africanus&quot;), has also been included based on remains found in Aïn Brimba, in Tunisia, North Africa, dating to the early-middle Pliocene. In 1990, Alan Turner challenged the validity of &quot;H. problematicum&quot; and &quot;H. hadarensis&quot;, and later authors have generally refrained from referring African &quot;Homotherium&quot; fossils to any specific species due to their largely fragmentary nature. In 2021, indeterminate remains of &quot;Homotherium&quot; were reported from the Tobène locality of Senegal in West Africa, dating to the Early Pliocene. Indeterminate remains of &quot;Homotherium&quot; have also been reported from the Ahl al Oughlam locality in Morocco, dating to the Late Pliocene.

=== Americas ===
In 1905, Merriam described a new species &quot;Machaerodus ischyrus&quot;. Subsequently, in 1918, Merriam reassigned it to a new genus &quot;Ischyrosmilus&quot; along with the new species &quot;Ischyrosmilus idahoensis&quot;. The genus &quot;Dinobastis&quot; was originally named by Cope in 1893, with the type species &quot;Dinobastis serus&quot;. In 1965, the species &quot;Ischyrosmilus johnstoni&quot; was described. In the same paper, it was noted that a comparative study of both &quot;Ischyrosmilus&quot; and &quot;Homotherium&quot; might conclude them as synonyms.

In 1966, Churcher named &quot;Dinobastis&quot; a junior synonym of &quot;Homotherium&quot;, and recombined &quot;D. serus&quot; as &quot;Homotherium serum.&quot; In 1970, a new species &quot;Ischyrosmilus crusafonti&quot; was described from the early Pleistocene of Nebraska. In 1988, after some debate, the genus &quot;Ischyrosmilus&quot; was declared a junior synonym of &quot;Homotherium&quot; and all four species were reassigned to that genus as &quot;H. ischyrus&quot;, &quot;H. idahoensis&quot;, and &quot;H. johnstoni&quot;. The same paper also proposed keeping &quot;Dinobastis serus&quot; separate from &quot;Homotherium&quot;. Up to five species have been recognised from North America: &quot;H. idahoensis&quot;, &quot;H. crusafonti&quot;, &quot;H. ischyrus&quot;, &quot;H. johnstoni&quot;, and &quot;H. serum,&quot; while other authors suggest that there are only two species, with older Blancan (Pliocene-Early Pleistocene) specimens assigned to the species &quot;H. ischyrus&quot;, while the younger ones (mostly Late Pleistocene in age) are assigned to the species &quot;H. serum&quot;. &quot;H. serum&quot; is morphologically similar to the Eurasian &quot;H. latidens&quot;, which may suggest that they share a close common origin, with &quot;H. serum&quot; possibly originating from a migration of &quot;H. latidens&quot; into North America rather than from earlier North American &quot;Homotherium&quot;. Some authors have considered &quot;H. serum&quot; to be a junior synonym of &quot;H. latidens&quot;.In 2005, a new species &quot;Homotherium venezuelensis&quot; was described based on fossils from the Pleistocene of Venezuela. In 2022, it was proposed that &quot;Homotherium venezuelensis&quot; be reassigned to the genus &quot;Xenosmilus&quot; (a genus originally described for Early-Middle Pleistocene aged fossils found in Florida) which was endorsed by another group of authors in 2024. The 2022 study found that &quot;Xenosmilus&quot; was nested within &quot;Homotherium&quot; as traditionally defined, making &quot;Homotherium&quot; without including the species in &quot;Xenosmilus&quot; paraphyletic.

== Evolution ==
The lineage of &quot;Homotherium&quot; is estimated (based on mitochondrial DNA sequences) to have diverged from that of &quot;Smilodon&quot; about 18 million years ago. &quot;Homotherium&quot; has been suggested to have originated from African species of the genus &quot;Amphimachairodus.&quot; &quot;Homotherium&quot; first appeared during the Early Pliocene, about 4 million years ago, with its oldest remains being from the Odesa catacombs in Ukraine, and Koobi Fora in Kenya, which are close in age, making the origin location of the genus uncertain. The genus arrived in North America during the late Pliocene (~3.6-2.6 million years ago). Remains either attributed to &quot;Homotherium&quot; or &quot;Xenosmilus&quot; are known from Venezuela in northern South America, of an uncertain Early-Middle Pleistocene age. On the African continent, the genus disappeared about 1.5 million years ago, during the Early Pleistocene. The latest records of &quot;Homotherium&quot; in Europe date to the late Middle Pleistocene, around 300-200,000 years ago, with the exception of a single lower jaw bone from the North Sea which dates to around 28-30,000 years ago. It has been suggested that this may represent a Late Pleistocene dispersal from North America, rather than a continuous undocumented occupation of the region. In 2024, a mummy of a &quot;Homotherium latidens&quot; cub was reported from the Upper Pleistocene from the Badyarikha River, Yakutia in northeastern Siberia, dating to 35,471–37,019 years Before Present, marking the first recorded presence of the species in the Late Pleistocene of Asia. The youngest well dated remains of &quot;Homotherium serum&quot; date to around 12,715–12,655 years Before Present, found in southern Alberta, Canada, at the very end of the Late Pleistocene. &quot;Homotherium serum&quot; became extinct as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event of most large mammals across the Americas.

==Description==

&quot;Homotherium&quot; reached at the shoulder and weighed an estimated and was therefore about the size of a male lion. Compared to &quot;Smilodon&quot;, the legs were proportionally longer, and the forelimbs were less powerfully built, being narrow and intermediate in form between those of cheetahs and lions. The neck was relatively long and thick with a high degree of flexibility, while the back was relatively short. The tail was very short. The claws were small and semi-retractable, the dewclaw being large, with the second phalanges being less asymmetrical than those of lions, giving the feet a dog-like posture. The part of the humerus closest to the foot was narrow, with the olecranon fossa being strongly vertical. The hindfeet were held in a raised digitigrade posture. &quot;Homotherium&quot; likely walked with a posture intermediate between that of living big cats and hyenas, similar to that of canids.
In comparison to its likely ancestor &quot;Amphimachairodus&quot;, the upper incisors display stronger serration, are larger and more arched, the upper second premolar (P2) is always absent, and the upper and lower third premolars (P3 and p3) are smaller, and the morphology of the upper fourth premolar (P4) displays differences. Compared to living pantherine big cats such as tigers and lions, &quot;Homotherium&quot; has a more elongate and narrower skull with a more elevated snout region, with the top of the skull (dorsal region) having a more straight outline with a high sagittal crest. &quot;Homotherium&quot; had shorter upper canine teeth than members of the machairodont tribe Smilodontini such as &quot;Smilodon&quot; or &quot;Megantereon&quot;, but these were still longer than those of extant cats. Its large upper canine saber teeth are broad, distinctly flattened and coarsely serrated. The large upper canines of &quot;Homotherium&quot; were likely hidden by the lips and gum tissues of the upper and lower jaws when the mouth was closed, similar to extant cats and unlike the larger upper canines of &quot;Smilodon&quot;. This hypothesis is further supported by comparable space between the canines and mandible at full closure of the jaws to modern cats; while &quot;Smilodon&quot; has significantly more space in this respect, likely for soft tissue to fit between the canine and mandible. The incisors are enlarged relative to those of modern big cats, and arranged in an arc at the front of the jaws, similar to hyenas and canines. The joining region between the two halves of the lower jaw (mandibular symphysis) is angular and high, with the coronoid process of the mandible being relatively short.

Preserved soft tissue of a three-week old cub of a &quot;H. latidens&quot; found in Siberia in 2020 and described in 2024 indicates that the coat color for juveniles of this species was a black or dark brown color with pale paws and chin. The fur on the corner of the mouth region and back of the neck were longer than on the forelimbs of the mummy. Additionally, the cub had wide, rounded paws, which lacked a carpal pad, and its fur was dense: adaptations to traversing snowy terrain effectively, showcasing these features developed at a young age.

==Paleoecology ==

&quot;Homotherium&quot; is suggested to have been adapted to the hunting of large prey. The reduced claws, relatively slender and long limbs, and sloping back all appear to be adaptations for moderate speed endurance running in open habitats. The running-adapted morphology of its forelimbs suggests that they were less useful than those of &quot;Smilodon&quot; or many living big cats in grasping and restraining prey, and that instead the enlarged incisor teeth at the front of the jaws served this function, like in hyenas and canids. It has been suggested that &quot;Homotherium&quot; killed prey by slashing bites to the throat inflicted by its canines, though its style of prey restraint was probably different to that of &quot;Smilodon&quot; (which had more powerful forelimbs which helped to better restrain prey) with a killing technique more similar in some aspects to the clamp-and-hold technique used by living big cats like lions, with the saber teeth of &quot;Homotherium&quot; better able to resist sideways directed forces induced by struggling prey without fracturing than those of &quot;Smilodon&quot;. Like other sabertooth cats, it likely used a &quot;canine shear bite&quot; technique, where, once the prey was immobilized and the jaws opened around the throat of the prey, the neck muscles of &quot;Homotherium&quot; were used to force the skull and the saber canine teeth downwards to puncture the throat of prey. These throat bites would likely have caused massive blood loss resulting in rapid death. The elongate neck likely allowed fine control enabling the head to be precisely located and orientated for the bite. It has been speculated based on its adaptation to open habitats and high levels of competition from other carnivores, that &quot;Homotherium&quot; probably relied on group hunting. Dental microwear analysis of specimens of &quot;H. serum&quot; from North America suggests that &quot;Homotherium&quot; regularly consumed tough-fleshed prey, but only engaged in defleshing and did not engage in bone crunching/crushing, similar to cheetahs but unlike living lions and hyenas.Homotherium biting sequence.jpg

Analysis of the genome of a &quot;Homotherium&quot; specimen found in permafrost in Yukon suggests that &quot;Homotherium&quot; experienced positive selection for genes related to respiration and the circulatory system, which may have been adaptations for endurance running. Positive selection for genes related to vision indicates that sight probably played an important role in hunting, suggesting that &quot;Homotherium&quot; was a diurnal (day active) hunter. Selection for genes related to cognition were tentatively suggested by researchers to possibly support the social hunting hypothesis. 

Isotopic analysis of &quot;H. latidens&quot; from the Venta Micena locality in southeast Spain dating to the Early Pleistocene, around 1.6 million years ago, suggests that at this locality &quot;H. latidens&quot; was the apex predator and hunted large prey in open habitats, likely including the equine &quot;Equus altidens&quot;, bison, as well as possibly juveniles of the mammoth &quot;Mammuthus meridionalis,&quot; and niche partitioned with the sabertooth &quot;Megantereon&quot; (a close relative of &quot;Smilodon&quot;) and the &quot;European jaguar&quot; &quot;Panthera gombaszoegensis,&quot; which hunted somewhat smaller prey in forested habitats. 

Analysis of specimens from Punta Lucero in northern Spain, dating to the early Middle Pleistocene (600-400,000 years ago), suggests that &quot;H. latidens&quot; at this locality exclusively consumed large (from to over ) prey, likely including aurochs, bison, red deer, and/or the giant deer &quot;Praemegaceros,&quot; and heavily overlapped in diet with the coexisting &quot;European jaguar&quot; &quot;Panthera gombaszoegensis&quot;.

At the Friesenhahn Cave site in Texas, which dates to the Late Pleistocene (likely around 20-17,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum), the remains of almost 400 juvenile Columbian mammoths were discovered along with numerous &quot;Homotherium serum&quot; skeletons of all ages, from elderly specimens to cubs. The sloped back and powerful lumbar section of &quot;Homotherium&quot;″s vertebrae suggest that these animals could have been capable of pulling formidable loads; further, broken upper canines - a common injury in fossils of other machairodonts such as &quot;Machairodus&quot; and &quot;Smilodon&quot; that would have resulted from struggling with their prey - is not seen in &quot;Homotherium&quot;, perhaps because their social groups would completely restrain prey items before any of the cats attempted to kill the target with their saber teeth, or because the canines were less frail due to being covered. Moreover, the bones of the young mammoths found in Friesenhahn Cave show distinctive marks matching the incisors of &quot;Homotherium&quot;, indicating that they could efficiently process most of the meat on a carcass and that the mammoths had been deposited in the caves by the cats themselves and not by scavengers. Examination of the bones also indicates that the carcasses of these juvenile mammoths were dismembered after being killed by the cats before being dragged away, suggesting that &quot;Homotherium&quot; would disarticulate their kill to transport it to a safe area such as a hidden lair or den and prevent competitors such as dire wolves and American lions from usurping the carcass. Isotopic analysis of &quot;H. serum&quot; dental remains at Friesenhahn Cave have confirmed that at this locality it predominantly fed on mammoths along with other C4 grazers, like bison and horses in open habitats, as well as possibly C4 browsers like the camel &quot;Camelops&quot;.

Isotopic analysis of &quot;H. serum&quot; specimens from Eastern Beringia (now Alaska and Yukon) suggests that in this region the species was not a specialised mammoth predator, and consumed a variety of large prey, likely including bison, muskox, horse and reindeer, as well as also probably woolly mammoths.

== Relationship with humans ==
&quot;Homotherium&quot; has a long history of co-occurrence with archaic humans across Afro-Eurasia, ranging from &quot;Australopithecus&quot; in the Pliocene of Africa, to &quot;Homo erectus&quot; in Zhoukoudian cave in the Early-Middle Pleistocene of China and &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; in the Middle Pleistocene of Europe. The seeming extinction of &quot;Homotherium latidens&quot; in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene may have been the result of competition with &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; (in combination with the lion &quot;Panthera fossilis&quot;).

Isotopic analysis of the canine teeth of &quot;H. latidens&quot; found in Kent&#x27;s Cavern indicated that they were isotopically distinct from other animal remains found in the cave. This, along with the absence of any other &quot;Homotherium&quot; remains in the cave, has led authors to suggest that the teeth were deliberately transported into the cave by humans during the Palaeolithic from further afield (possibly from mainland Europe), perhaps as a kind of trade good. The teeth are suggested to have experienced considerable weathering prior to being taken into Kent&#x27;s Cavern, and it is unclear whether these teeth were taken from the remains of relatively recently dead &quot;Homotherium&quot; or subfossil remains of long-dead &quot;Homotherium&quot; individuals. A now lost Upper Palaeolithic figurine found in Isturitz cave in southwest France has been suggested by some authors to represent &quot;Homotherium,&quot; but other authors have argued that it more likely represents a cave lion based on its anatomical proportions and the much greater abundance of cave lion remains compared to those of &quot;Homotherium&quot; in Late Pleistocene Europe. 

At the end of the Late Pleistocene in North America, &quot;Homotherium serum&quot; co-existed with Palaeoindians, the first humans to inhabit the Americas. The effect of human hunting of large herbivores which &quot;H. serum&quot; relied upon may have been a contributory factor in its extinction along with other large carnivores in North America.

<text>Francis Asbury (August 20 or 21, 1745 – March 31, 1816) was a British-American Methodist minister who became one of the first two bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States. During his 45 years in the colonies and the newly independent United States, he devoted his life to ministry, traveling on horseback and by carriage thousands of miles to those living on the frontier.

Asbury spread Methodism in British colonial America and the United States as part of the Second Great Awakening. He also founded several schools during his lifetime, although his own formal education was limited. His journal is valuable to scholars for its account of frontier society, with references to many towns and villages in Colonial America. Along with John and Charles Wesley, Asbury is often celebrated as one of the founders of the Methodist Church.

==Biography==

===Childhood and adolescence===

Francis Asbury was born at Hamstead Bridge, Staffordshire, England on August 20 or 21, 1745, to Elizabeth and Joseph Asbury. The family moved to a cottage at Great Barr the next year. His boyhood home still stands and is open as Bishop Asbury Cottage museum.

Soon after the family moved to Great Barr, in May 1748, Asbury&#x27;s older sister, Sarah, died; he was less than three years old. Asbury wrote later that his mother Eliza was &quot;very much a woman of the world&quot;; with his sister&#x27;s death, she &quot;sank into deep distress...from which she was not relieved for many years,&quot; and was living &quot;in a very, dark, dark, dark, day and place&quot;. A few years later she found a renewed Christian faith as itinerant preachers, either Baptist or Methodists, visited Barr on a revival circuit. From then on she began to read the Bible every day and encouraged her son to do so as well. 

Eliza&#x27;s deep faith may not have been shared by her husband, who seemed to have problems, possibly drink or gambling. Francis Asbury described his father as &quot;industrious.&quot; The husband supported his wife in her faith and witness: he allowed Methodist meetings to be held each Sunday in the cottage.

During Asbury&#x27;s childhood the West Midlands was undergoing massive changes as the industrial revolution swept through the area. Waves of workers migrated into the area, attracted by jobs in the growing factories and workshops in Birmingham and the Black Country of the mines. The Asburys lived in a cottage tied to a public house, on a main route between the mines and the factories. They would have been aware of the drinking, gambling, poverty and poor behaviour prevalent in the area.

Francis Asbury attended a local endowed school in Snail&#x27;s Green, a nearby hamlet. He did not get on well with his fellow pupils who ridiculed him because of his mother&#x27;s religious beliefs. During the 1740s there had been widespread anti-Methodist rioting in Wednesbury and the surrounding area, and into the 1750s a great deal of persecution. Nor did he like his teacher and left school at the first opportunity. 

Asbury took a keen interest in religion, having &quot;felt something of God as early as the age of seven&quot;. He lived not far from All Saints&#x27; Church, West Bromwich, which under the patronage of the Methodist Earl of Dartmouth, provided a living for Evangelical minister Edward Stillinghurst. Well connected, Stillinghurst invited as visiting preachers some of the foremost preachers and theologians of the day. These included John Fletcher, John Ryland, Henry Venn, John Cennick and Benjamin Ingham. His mother encouraged Francis to meet with the Methodists in Wednesbury, eventually joining a &quot;band&quot; with four other young men who would meet and pray together. For them a typical Sunday would be a preaching meeting at 5.00 am, communion at the parish church mid morning, and attending a preaching meeting again at 5.00 pm. 

Asbury had his first formal job at age thirteen; he went &quot;into service&quot; for local gentry, whom he later described as &quot;one of the most unGodly families in the parish&quot;. But he soon left them and is believed to have eventually worked for Thomas Foxall, at the Old Forge Farm, where he made metal goods. He became great friends with Foxall&#x27;s son, Henry. They developed a friendship, which continued after Henry Foxall&#x27;s emigration to Colonial America. There he continued working with metal and established the Foundry Church in Georgetown, now part of Washington, D.C. 

Asbury began to preach locally, and eventually became an itinerant preacher on behalf of the Methodist cause.

Asbury&#x27;s preaching ministry in England is detailed in the section below: &quot;Asbury&#x27;s circuits in England&quot;.

===Asbury&#x27;s work in America===
At the age of 22, Asbury&#x27;s selection by John Wesley as a traveling lay preacher became official. Typically such positions were held by young, unmarried men, known as exhorters. In 1771 Asbury volunteered to travel to British North America. His first sermon in the Colonies took place with the Methodist congregation in Woodrow, Staten Island. Within the first 17 days of being in the colonies, Asbury preached in both Philadelphia and New York. During the first year, he served as Wesley&#x27;s assistant and preached in 25 different settlements. When the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, he and James Dempster were the only British Methodist lay ministers to remain in America.

&quot;During his early years in North America, Asbury devoted his attention mainly to followers living on the eastern shore between the Delaware River and the Chesapeake Bay. Bishop Asbury was a good friend of the Melsons and was their guest many times on his rounds. When the American revolution severed the traditional ties between the American Thirteen Colonies and Great Britain, Bishop Asbury, in the interest of his religious tenets and principles and in an attempt to remain aloof from the political and military fervor that swept the country, announced he would, to keep the embryonic Methodist congregations neutral, refrain from endorsing either Great Britain or the newly formed United States of America government and urged all his followers to do the same. This request placed almost all of his followers, especially those living in Maryland, in an untenable position. The State of Maryland had enacted a law requiring all citizens to take an Oath of Allegiance to the newly formed American Congress. In addition to this, it stipulated all non-residents within its boundaries also had to take and sign an Oath of Allegiance. Those refusing were summarily incarcerated for treason. Asbury, after proclaiming his neutrality, fled to Delaware, where taking an oath of allegiance was not a requirement. His adherents in Maryland suffered the rancor of the proponents of the Oath.&quot;Asbury remained hidden during the war and ventured occasionally back into Maryland. Sometimes this had the effect of compromising his parishioners.

Note: Asbury did not become ordained or a bishop until December 1784.

Asbury taught that “slavery was a crime against the laws of God, man, and nature”. In 1780, Asbury met the freedman Henry &quot;Black Harry&quot; Hosier, a meeting the minister believed &quot;providentially arranged&quot;. Hosier served as his driver and guide and, though illiterate, memorized long passages of the Bible as Asbury read them aloud during their travels. Hosier eventually became a famous preacher in his own right, the first African American to preach directly to a white congregation in the United States.

===A camp meeting===
In the fall of 1800, Asbury attended one of the events of the Revival of 1800 as he travelled from Kentucky into Tennessee. The combined Presbyterian and Methodist communion observance made a deep impression on Asbury; it was as an early experience for him of multi-day meetings, which included attendees camping on the grounds or sleeping in their wagons around the meeting house. He recorded the events in his journal: it showed the relation between religious revivalism and camp meetings, later a staple of nineteenth-century frontier Methodism.

===Ordained and consecrated a bishop===

In 1784, John Wesley named Asbury and Thomas Coke as co-superintendents of the work in the United States. The Christmas Conference that year marked the beginning of the Methodist Episcopal Church of the United States. It was during this Conference that Asbury was ordained by Coke. 

For the next 32 years, Asbury led all the Methodists in America. However, his leadership did not go unchallenged. His idea for a ruling council was opposed by such notables as William McKendree, Jesse Lee, and James O&#x27;Kelly. Eventually, based on advice by Coke, he established in 1792 a General Conference, to which delegates could be sent, as a way of building broader support.

===His journeys===
Like Wesley, Asbury preached in myriad of places: courthouses, public houses, tobacco houses, fields, public squares, wherever a crowd assembled to hear him. For the remainder of his life, he rode an average of 6,000 miles each year, preaching virtually every day and conducting meetings and conferences. Under his direction, the church grew from 1,200 to 214,000 members and 700 ordained preachers. Among the men he ordained was Richard Allen in Philadelphia, the first black Methodist minister in the United States who later founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent black denomination in the country. Another African American was Daniel Coker, who emigrated to Sierra Leone in 1820 and became the first Methodist minister there from the West. Bishop Asbury also ordained Peter Cartwright in the fall of 1806.

===Failing health and death===
In 1813, Asbury wrote his will. This was a time when &quot;the greatest membership gain in the history of the church&quot; was achieved. In 1814 his health started to fail and he became ill. In 1816 he started to regain strength and continued his preaching journey. He &quot;preached his last Sermon in Richmond, Virginia&quot; on March 24, &quot;and died at the home of George Arnold near Fredericksburg&quot; on March 31.

Bishop Asbury died in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. He was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery, in Baltimore, near the graves of Bishops John Emory and Beverly Waugh.

===Ability as a preacher===
In an exciting time in American history, Asbury was reported to be an extraordinary preacher. Biographer Ezra Squier Tipple wrote: &quot;If to speak with authority as the accredited messenger of God; to have credentials which bear the seal of heaven ... if when he lifted the trumpet to his lips the Almighty blew the blast; if to be conscious of an ever-present sense of God, God the Summoner, God the Anointing One, God the Judge, and to project it into speech which would make his hearers tremble, melt them with terror, and cause them to fall as dead men; if to be and do all this would entitle a man to be called a great preacher, then Asbury was a great preacher.&quot;

==Personal habits==
&quot;Francis Asbury had a great distrust of personal popularity, and equally marked distaste of personal publicity&quot;. Not being a vain person, he did not care to have his image preserved. He had been in America for 23 years, and a bishop for 10 years before he had let a portrait be made of him. His friend James McCannon persuaded him to have it done. Asbury had had a portrait painted of him for his mother in 1797. His last portrait was made in 1813 by an unknown artist in Strasburgh, Pennsylvania.

Asbury had times when he tended to have gloomy thoughts and opinions. He believed himself to be &quot;a true prophet of evil tidings, as it suits my cast of mind&quot;. Although he was pessimistic, those who knew him considered him an extremely sensitive person. In his journal he recorded more failures and misgivings than success in his ministry. He loved simplicity and had &quot;frequent spells of morbid depression&quot;. He tended to use cynical sarcasm in his preachings. One of the typical prayers he would say, even on his way to America, was &quot;Lord, we are in thy hands and in thy work. Thou knowest what is best of us and for thy work; whether plenty or poverty. The hearts of all men are in thy hands. If it is best for us and for thy church that we should be cramped and straitened, let the people&#x27;s hands and hearts be closed: If it is better for us; for the church,—and more to thy glory that we should abound in the comforts of life; do thou dispose the hearts of those we serve to give accordingly: and may we learn to be content whether we abound, or suffer need&quot;.

He rose at 5 every morning to read the Bible. He was impatient with those who did not do the tasks assigned to them as soon as the task was assigned. He was &quot;one of the wisest and most farseeing men of his day&quot;.

==His journal==
On September 4, 1771, at the age of 26, Francis Asbury began his journey to Philadelphia from Pill near Bristol, England. &quot;It cost him much to leave home and kindred, as is witnessed by his affectionate letters and sacrificial remittances home: but the call of God was not to be denied&quot;. Before he left, he wrote a letter to his family. &quot;I wonder sometimes how anyone will sit to hear me, but the Lord covers my weakness with his power…. I trust you will be easy and more quiet. As for me, I know what I am called to. It is to give up all, and to have my hands and heart in the work, yea, the nearest and dearest friends…. Let others condemn me as being without natural affection, disobedient to parents, or say what they please…. I love my parents and friends, but I love my God better and his service…. And tho&#x27; I have given up all, I do not repent, for I have found all&quot;. On this voyage he began a journal. &quot;In his journal he pours out the feelings and impulses of the moment, but often without giving a clue to either the offender or the offense&quot;. He became seasick for the first week but had recovered. He was &quot;poor in material things, but rich in the spiritual atmosphere created and maintained by his mother&quot;. He also spent a lot of time studying and reading the Bible and books written by Wesley. On September 22, September 29, and October 6, he preached to the ship&#x27;s company. Finally, on October 27, he landed at his destination in Philadelphia. His journal also contains some references to opinions of ministers who disagreed with the Methodist leadership, such as Rev. Charles Hopkins of Powhatan County, Virginia who had rejected the Methodist ideals several years before.

His journal also frequently mentioned Thomas S. Hinde who was the son of Dr. Thomas Hinde and founder of the city of Mount Carmel, Illinois.

==Asbury&#x27;s circuits in England==

Asbury&#x27;s travels in America are amply noted in his three-volume journal, &quot;The Journal and Letters of Francis Asbury.&quot; However, his travels in England are much harder to piece together as very little information exists. John Wigger provide some details in &quot;American Saint&quot;, his biography on Asbury.

Around 1763, Asbury began leading the class of about two dozen faithful at the West Bromwich Wesleyan society. In March 1765, his mentor, Wesleyan Alexander Mather asked Asbury to assist him. For the next 11 months, the twenty-year-old Asbury taught and preached around the Staffordshire circuit. The circuit consisted of small Wesleyan societies in West Bromwich, Wednesbury, Walsall, Wolverhampton, and Billbrook. These areas were the foundation of Methodism in the Black Country. During this initial phase of his circuits around England, two Wesleyan preachers offered the majority of the young preachers mentoring. The first was the already mentioned Scottish itinerant, Mather. The second was an English preacher from Bedfordshire, James Glasbrook. These two taught Asbury, John Wesley&#x27;s basic requirements for a Wesleyan itinerant preacher.

In January 1766, Mather offered him the opportunity to quit the forge and join the Wesleyan movement as a full-time itinerant on a trial basis. The twenty-one-year-old Asbury accepted. Part of his training as a full-time traveling preacher required that he read extensively from books suggested by Wesley, who made them available in London, Bristol and Newcastle. The list included several Divinity Books: the Bible, Wesley&#x27;s tracts, the works of Boehm and Francke. There were also books on Natural Philosophy, Astronomy, History, Poetry and Latin Prose. There were also books on Latin Verse, Greek Prose, including the Greek New Testament, Greek Verse - including Homer&#x27;s Iliad, and the Hebrew Bible.

For the next five months, during his circuits in England Asbury teamed with William Orpe, a young preacher who was the Hebrew teacher at Wesley&#x27;s Kingswood School in Bristol. They covered the large Staffordshire circuit that encompassed not only Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Willenhall, Walsall, Wednesbury, Darlaston and Billbrook, but also an extended portion to the south in Worcestershire, Tewkesbury and Gloucestershire. Despite his happiness with his new career, Asbury struggled with a sense that his efforts were somewhat limited. He was still living with his parents, he was preaching in places that had heard him preach for the last five years. He looked for more travel and more responsibility.

Asbury pressed Mather to assign Asbury to the low round of the Staffordshire circuit, and found it more grueling than he had anticipated. After twelve months Mather sent him home for a short break. Asbury then received instructions to head for London. The London conference of 1767 assigned Asbury to the Bedfordshire circuit.

In London, it is likely that Asbury met George Whitefield when he attended worship at Whitefield&#x27;s Tabernacle. At the time of Asbury&#x27;s arrival in London, Benjamin Franklin was staying in London and a guest of his friend Whitefield, whom he had met years earlier during one of Whitefield&#x27;s trips to America. Along with Franklin at Whitefield&#x27;s home were Connecticut colonial leaders including a Mohegan Indian named Samson Occum and his traveling companion, Princeton College Presbyterian minister, Nathaniel Whitaker, Lord Dartmouth, and the merchant Dennis De Bert. Occum and Whitaker were in England to raise money for their Indian Charity School in Lebanon, Connecticut. Spending a couple months in London before the August conference, it is likely that Asbury not only heard Samson Occum speak at The Tabernacle, but also had opportunity to meet this unique group.

August 18, 1767 the conference in London began at John and Charles Wesley&#x27;s Foundry Church. At this conference, Wesley assigned Asbury to the sprawling Bedfordshire circuit. In addition to Bedfordshire, Asbury was officially admitted on trial and teamed with Bedfordshire native, James Glasbrook. The main locations were Hertford, Luton, Sundon, Millbrook, Bedford, Clifton and Northampton. It was a rural circuit made up of small societies whose total membership was just 208 people. 

In lieu of attending the 1768 conference in Bristol, Asbury is given instructions to wait in London to await his next assignment. Asbury&#x27;s short stopover in London occurs at the same time that Benjamin Rush is staying with George Whitefield, having completed his medical studies in Edinburgh. After the Bristol conference in August 1768, Wesley assigns Asbury to the only circuit more difficult than the Staffordshire low Round, Colchester. Asbury will preach along the southern coastline of the River Stour, from Manningtree to Harwich. As beautiful as the scenery is, the area sours with rampant smuggling. Asbury is to preach against smuggling.

Perhaps out of worry for the young itinerant and the dangerous territory he travels, after two months on the Colchester circuit, Asbury receives word to relocate to the Wiltshire circuit. The three main cities of the Wiltshire circuit are Salisbury, Winchester and Portsmouth. In Portsmouth, it is likely that Asbury began his study of Hebrew through the large Jewish settlement that coexisted with the Portsmouth Methodists. In Portsmouth, the majority of the Jewish settlers reside in Portsea, also known as Portsmouth Common, the same area as the Methodists. For the next ten months, he remains on the Wiltshire circuit.

August 10, 1769, word from the Leeds Conference arrives for Asbury in Salisbury. Word from Wesley is that the next circuit is Oxfordshire. There he teams up with his friend from Staffordshire, Richard Whatcoat. In Oxford, Asbury and Whatcoat occasionally preach from St Giles Church. Asbury and Whatcoat remain in Oxford until Christmas. They are both assigned to preach the Bedfordshire circuit in the new year.
In addition to returning to Northampton, Asbury will travel to the smaller Wesleyan societies in Towcester and Whittlebury. He also spends time in Weedon. For the next eight months, Asbury will preach on the western portion of the Bedfordshire circuit. 

In March 1770, Wesley preached at West Bromwich. The news of Wesley draws Asbury to return home after nearly three years away. After his visit home, Asbury returns to the western portion of the Bedfordshire circuit. After the 1770 conference Wesley once again assigns Asbury to Wiltshire. It is during this assignment Asbury is abandoned by his assigned helper, John Catermole, who leaves the Wiltshire circuit after his dealing with a disorderly lay leader who threatens violence to Catermole and Asbury. A visit by Wesley to the struggling Wiltshire circuit results in Wesley asking Asbury to visit the Isle of Wight. It is at the August 1771 conference in Bristol where Asbury volunteers for the circuit simply called, America.

<text>Prenatal care, also known as antenatal care, is a type of preventive healthcare. It is provided in the form of medical checkups, consisting of recommendations on managing a healthy lifestyle and the provision of medical information such as maternal physiological changes in pregnancy, biological changes, and prenatal nutrition including prenatal vitamins, which prevents potential health problems throughout the course of the pregnancy and promotes the mother and child&#x27;s health alike. The availability of routine prenatal care, including prenatal screening and diagnosis, has played a part in reducing the frequency of maternal death, miscarriages, birth defects, low birth weight, neonatal infections and other preventable health problems.

Traditional prenatal care in high-income countries generally consists of:
* monthly visits during the first two trimesters (from the 1st week to the 28th week)
* fortnightly visits from the 28th week to the 36th week of pregnancy
* weekly visits after 36th week to the delivery, from the 38th week to the 42nd week
* Assessment of parental needs and family dynamics

The traditional form of antenatal care has developed from the early 1900s and there is very little research to suggest that it is the best way of giving antenatal care. Antenatal care can be costly and uses many staff. The following paragraphs describe research on other forms of antenatal care, which may reduce the burden on maternity services in all countries.

==Visits numbers==

The WHO recommends that pregnant women should all receive at least eight antenatal visits to spot and treat problems and give immunizations. Although antenatal care is important to improve the health of both mother and baby, many women do not receive eight visits.
There is little evidence behind the number of antenatal visits, pregnant women receive and what care and information is given at each visit. It has been suggested that women who have low-risk pregnancies should have fewer antenatal visits. However, when this was tested, women with fewer visits had babies who were much more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care and stay there for longer (though this could down to chance results). A 2015 Cochrane Review findings buttresses this notion, with evidence that in settings with limited resources, where the number of visits is already low, programmes of ANC with reduced visits are associated with an increase in perinatal mortality. Therefore, it is doubtful that the reduced visits model is ideal, even in low income countries (LICs), where pregnant women are already attending fewer appointments. Not only is visiting prenatal care early is highly recommended, but also a more flexible pathway allowing more visits, from the time a pregnant woman books for prenatal care, as it potentially enables more attention to those women who come late. Also, women who had fewer antenatal visits were not as satisfied with the care they received compared with women who had the standard number of visits. A new alternative for some of the routine prenatal care visits is Telemedicine.

There are many ways of changing health systems to help women access antenatal care, such as new health policies, educating health workers and health service re-organisation. Community interventions to help people change their behavior can also play a part. Examples of interventions are media campaigns reaching many people, enabling communities to take control of their own health, informative-education-communication interventions and financial incentives. A review looking at these interventions found that one intervention helps improve the number of women receiving antenatal care. However interventions used together may reduce baby deaths in pregnancy and early life, lower numbers of low birth weight babies born and improve numbers of women receiving antenatal care.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in 2015 around 830 women died every day from problems in pregnancy and childbirth. Only 5 lived in high-income countries. The rest lived in low-income countries.

A study examined the differences in early and low-weight birth deliveries between local and immigrant women and saw the difference caused by prenatal care received. The study, between 1997 and 2008, looked at 21,708 women giving birth in a region of Spain. The results indicated that very preterm birth (VPTB) and very low birth weight (VLBW) were much more common for immigrants than locals (Castelló et al., 2012). The study showed the importance of prenatal care and how universal prenatal care would help people of all origins get proper care before pregnancy/birth (Castelló et al., 2012).

==Group versus individual care==

Group antenatal care has a couple of obvious benefits: it costs less than one-to-one visits and the women have more hours of care as a group than on their own. Only small studies have been conducted looking at group care but they have found that mothers knew more about pregnancy, birth and parenting in the group setting. The mothers reported liking the group care and the review found no difference between how the pregnancies developed between the group and individual settings.

==Midwife-led care==

Midwife-led care for low-risk women is where a midwife team (and GP if needed) leads the care a woman receives and she does not usually see a specialist doctor in her pregnancy. Women with midwife-led pregnancies are more likely to give birth without being induced but have natural labours. However they are less likely to have their waters broken, an instrumental delivery, episiotomy or preterm birth. Around the same number of women in each group had a caesarean section.

==Prenatal examinations==

At the initial antenatal care visit and with the aid of a special booking checklist the pregnant women become classified into either normal risk or high risk.

In many countries, women are given a summary of their case notes including important background information about their pregnancy, such as their medical history, growth charts and any scan reports. If the mother goes to a different hospital for care or to give birth the summary of her case notes can be used by the midwives and doctors until her hospital notes arrive.

A review looking into women keeping their own case notes shows they have more risk of having a caesarean section. However the women reported feeling more in control having their notes and would like to have them again in future pregnancies. 25% of women reported their hospital notes were lost in hospital though none of the women forgot to take their own notes to any appointments.

Prenatal diagnosis or prenatal screening (note that &quot;Prenatal Diagnosis&quot; and &quot;Prenatal Screening&quot; refer to two different types of tests) is testing for diseases or conditions in a fetus or embryo before it is born. Obstetricians and midwives have the ability to monitor mother&#x27;s health and prenatal development during pregnancy through series of regular check-ups.

Physical examinations generally consist of:
* Collection of (mother&#x27;s) medical history
* Checking (mother&#x27;s) blood pressure
* (Mother&#x27;s) height and weight
* Pelvic exam
* Doppler fetal heart rate monitoring
* (Mother&#x27;s) blood and urine tests
* Discussion with caregiver

In some countries, such as the UK, the symphysial fundal height (SFH) is measured as part of antenatal appointments from 25 weeks gestation. (The SFH is measured from the woman&#x27;s pubic bone to the top of the uterus.) A review into this practice found only one piece of research so there is not enough evidence to say whether measuring the SFH helps to detect small or large babies. As measuring the SFH is not costly and is used in many places, the review recommends carrying on this practice.

Growth charts are a way of detecting small babies by the measuring the SFH. There are two types of growth chart:
# Population based chart, which shows a standard growth and size for each baby
# Customized growth chart, which is worked out by looking at the mother&#x27;s height and weight, and the weights of their previous babies.
A review looking into which of these charts detected small babies found that there is no good quality research to show which is best. More research is needed before the customized growth charts are recommended because they cost more money and take more time for the health care workers to make.

Obstetric ultrasounds are most commonly performed during the second trimester at approximately week 20. Ultrasounds are considered relatively safe and have been used for over 35 years for monitoring pregnancy.
Among other things, ultrasounds are used to:
* Diagnose pregnancy (uncommon)
* Check for multiple fetuses
* Assess possible risks to the mother (e.g., miscarriage, blighted ovum, ectopic pregnancy, or a molar pregnancy condition)
* Check for fetal malformation (e.g., club foot, spina bifida, cleft palate, clenched fists)
* Determine if an intrauterine growth retardation condition exists
* Note the development of fetal body parts (e.g., heart, brain, liver, stomach, skull, other bones)
* Check the amniotic fluid and umbilical cord for possible problems
* Determine due date (based on measurements and relative developmental progress)

Generally an ultrasound is ordered whenever an abnormality is suspected or along a schedule similar to the following:
* 7 weeks — confirm pregnancy, ensure that it&#x27;s neither molar or ectopic, determine due date
* 13–14 weeks (some areas) — evaluate the possibility of Down syndrome
* 18–20 weeks — see the expanded list above
* 34 weeks (some areas) — evaluate size, verify placental position

A review looking at routine ultrasounds past 24 weeks found that there is no evidence to show any benefits to the mother or the baby.

Early scans mean that multiple pregnancies can be detected at an early stage of pregnancy and also gives more accurate due dates so that less women are induced who do not need to be.

Levels of feedback from the ultrasound can differ. High feedback is when the parents can see the screen and are given a detailed description of what they can see. Low feedback is when the findings are discussed at the end and the parents are given a picture of the ultrasound. The different ways of giving feedback affect how much the parents worry and the mother&#x27;s health behaviour although there is not enough evidence to make clear conclusions. In a small study, mothers receiving high feedback were more likely to stop smoking and drinking alcohol however the quality of the study is low and more research is needed to say for certain which type of feedback is better.

Women experiencing a complicated pregnancy may have a test called a Doppler ultrasound to look at the blood flow to their unborn baby. This is performed to detect signs that the baby is not getting a normal blood flow and therefore is &#x27;at risk&#x27;. A review looked at performing Doppler ultrasounds on all women even if they were at &#x27;low risk&#x27; of having complications. The review found that routine Doppler ultrasounds may have reduced the number of preventable baby deaths but the evidence was not strong enough to recommend that they should be made routine for all pregnant women.

== Exercise intensity and delivery outcomes ==
Research suggests that physical activity levels during pregnancy can impact delivery outcomes. A study examining the effects of exercise intensity on delivery type and risk of preterm birth found that varying levels of physical activity were linked to different pregnancy outcomes and associated risks.

Very low levels of physical activity are associated with an increased risk of both preterm and instrumental deliveries. Pregnant individuals with minimal activity may experience lower overall fitness and muscle tone, which can impact the body&#x27;s ability to manage the physical demands of labor. Another study showed that individuals with higher handgrip strength are more likely to have a vaginal delivery, as greater muscle strength and endurance can support the labor process. In contrast, those who gained more weight during pregnancy or had larger arm and calf circumferences were more likely to undergo cesarean delivery, particularly in cases of nonprogressive labor.

Low levels of physical activity during pregnancy have been linked to a slightly elevated risk of cesarean delivery. Regular moderate exercise may help enhance pelvic muscle tone and cardiovascular fitness, potentially reducing the likelihood of cesarean intervention by supporting the body&#x27;s endurance during labor.

For individuals seeking to engage in levels of vigorous or high intensity physical activity, one study did observe a slight increase in instrumental delivery, which involves the use of medical tools like forceps or vacuum devices. More intense physical activity may add extra demands on the body, potentially affecting labor progression and increasing the need for instrumental assistance.

It is important for pregnant individuals to consult with their healthcare provider before beginning or adjusting exercise routines, particularly if they are new to regular physical activity or have any health conditions that may affect pregnancy.

==United States==
Proper prenatal care affects all women of various social backgrounds. While availability of such services have considerable personal health and social benefits, socioeconomic problems prevent its universal adoption in both developing and developed nations, such as the US. Although women can benefit by utilizing prenatal care services, there exists various levels of health care accessibility between different demographics throughout the United States.

<text>Publius (or Flavius) Vegetius Renatus, known as Vegetius (), was a writer of the Later Roman Empire (late 4th century). Nothing is known of his life or station beyond what is contained in his two surviving works: &quot;Epitoma rei militaris&quot; (also referred to as &quot;De re militari&quot;), and the lesser-known &quot;Digesta Artis Mulomedicinae&quot;, a guide to veterinary medicine. He identifies himself in the opening of his work &quot;Epitoma rei militaris&quot; as a Christian.

==Dating of work==
The latest event alluded to in his &quot;Epitoma rei militaris&quot; is the death of the Emperor Gratian (383); the earliest attestation of the work is a &quot;subscriptio&quot; by Flavius Eutropius, writing in Constantinople in 450, which appears in one of two families of manuscripts, suggesting that a division of the manuscript tradition had already occurred. Despite Eutropius&#x27; location in Constantinople, the scholarly consensus is that Vegetius wrote in the Western Roman Empire. Vegetius dedicates his work to the reigning emperor, who is identified as Theodosius, &quot;ad Theodosium imperatorem&quot;, in the manuscript family that was not edited in 450; the identity is disputed: some scholars identify him with Theodosius I (, while others follow Otto Seeck and identify him with the later Valentinian III, dating the work to 430–35. Goffart agrees that the later date is likely, suggesting that the work may have been intended to support a military revival in the time of Aetius&#x27;s supremacy. Rosenbaum also argues that he wrote in the early 430s; Theodosius II might then have been the dedicatee. Rosenbaum uses allusions from Vegetius&#x27;s works and relationships to the work of Merobaudes to suggest that Vegetius was a senior court official, &quot;primiscrinius&quot; to the praetorian prefect, who had been an agens in rebus.

== &quot;Epitoma rei militaris&quot; ==
Vegetius&#x27; epitome mainly focuses on military organization and how to react to certain occasions in war. Vegetius explains how one should fortify and organize a camp, how to train troops, how to handle undisciplined troops, how to handle a battle engagement, how to march, formation gauge and many other useful methods of promoting organization and valour in the legion.

As G. R. Watson observes, Vegetius&#x27; &quot;Epitoma&quot; &quot;is the only ancient manual of Roman military institutions to have survived intact&quot;. Despite this, Watson doubts its value, for Vegetius &quot;was neither a historian nor a soldier: his work is a compilation carelessly constructed from material of all ages, a congeries of inconsistencies&quot;. These antiquarian sources, according to his own statement, were Cato the Elder, Cornelius Celsus, Frontinus, Paternus and the imperial constitutions of Augustus, Trajan, and Hadrian (1.8).

The first book is a plea for army reform; it vividly portrays the military decadence of the Late Roman Empire. Vegetius also describes in detail the organisation, training and equipment of the army of the early Empire. The third book contains a series of military maxims, which were (appropriately enough, considering the similarity in the military conditions of the two ages) the foundation of military learning for every European commander from William the Silent to Frederick the Great.

His book on siegecraft contains the best description of Late Empire and Medieval siege machines. Among other things, it shows details of the siege engine called the &quot;onager&quot;, which afterwards played a great part in sieges until the development of modern cannonry. The fifth book gives an account of the materiel and personnel of the Roman navy.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;In manuscript, Vegetius&#x27; work had a great vogue from its first advent. Its rules of siegecraft were much studied in the Middle Ages.&quot; N.P. Milner observes that it was &quot;one of the most popular Latin technical works from Antiquity, rivalling the elder Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; in the number of surviving copies dating from before AD 1300.&quot; It was translated into English, French (by Jean de Meun and others), Italian (by the Florentine judge Bono Giamboni and others), Catalan, Spanish, Czech, and Yiddish before the invention of printing. The first printed editions are ascribed to Utrecht (1473), Cologne (1476), Paris (1478), Rome (in &quot;Veteres de re mil. scriptores&quot;, 1487), and Pisa (1488). A German translation by Ludwig Hohenwang appeared at Ulm in 1475.

However, from that point Vegetius&#x27; position as the premier military authority began to decline, as ancient historians such as Polybius became available. Niccolò Machiavelli attempted to address Vegetius&#x27; defects in his &quot;L&#x27;arte della Guerra&quot; (Florence, 1521), with heavy use of Polybius, Frontinus, and Livy, but Justus Lipsius&#x27; accusation that he confused the institutions of diverse periods of the Roman Empire and G. Stewechius&#x27; opinion that the survival of Vegetius&#x27; work led to the loss of his named sources were more typical of the late Renaissance. While as late as the 18th century a soldier such as Marshal Puysegur based his own works on this acknowledged model, in Milner&#x27;s words, Vegetius&#x27; work suffered &quot;a long period of deepening neglect&quot;.

<text>Dessau is a district of the independent city of Dessau-Roßlau in Saxony-Anhalt at the confluence of the rivers Mulde and Elbe, in the &quot;Bundesland&quot; (Federal State) of Saxony-Anhalt. Until 1 July 2007, it was an independent city. The population of Dessau is 67,747 (Dec. 2020).

==Geography==
Dessau is situated on a floodplain where the Mulde flows into the Elbe. This causes yearly floods. The worst flood took place in the year 2002, when the Waldersee district was nearly completely flooded. The south of Dessau touches a well-wooded area called Mosigkauer Heide. The highest elevation is a 110 m high former rubbish dump called Scherbelberg in the southwest of Dessau. Dessau is surrounded by numerous parks and palaces that make it one of the greenest towns in Germany.

==History==

Dessau was first mentioned in 1213. It became an important centre in 1570, when the Principality of Anhalt was founded. Dessau became the capital of this state within the Holy Roman Empire. In 1603, the state was split into four – later five – Anhalts, Dessau becoming the capital of the mini-state of Anhalt-Dessau. In 1863 two of the noble lines died out, and the Duchy of Anhalt became reunited. From 1918 to 1945, Dessau was the capital of the Free State of Anhalt.
Dessau is famous as the second site of the Bauhaus school. It moved here in 1925 after it had been forced to close in Weimar. Many famous artists were lecturers in Dessau in the following years, among them Walter Gropius, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky. The Nazis’ control of Dessau city council forced the closure of the Dessau Bauhaus in 1932. The school moved to Bernau bei Berlin and closed its doors for the last time in 1933.

The town was almost completely destroyed by Allied air raids in World War II on 7 March 1945, six weeks before American troops occupied the town. Afterwards, it was rebuilt with typical GDR concrete slab architecture (&quot;Plattenbau&quot;) and became a major industrial centre of East Germany. Since German reunification in 1990, many historic buildings have been restored.

The composer Kurt Weill was born in Dessau. Since 1993, the city has hosted an annual Kurt Weill Festival. Dessau was also the birthplace of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn (in 1729), and Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau (&quot;der alte Dessauer&quot;) (on 3 July 1676), a lauded field marshal for the Kingdom of Prussia.

In January 2005, Dessau gained notoriety for the mysterious death of a Sierra Leonean drug trafficker and asylum seeker, Oury Jalloh. Jalloh died in police custody, however, the official version of events released by the police was found to have many inconsistencies.

===Railway stations===

Dessau Hauptbahnhof (main station) has connections to Magdeburg, Berlin, Leipzig, Halle, Bitterfeld and Lutherstadt Wittenberg. The line from Berlin was opened on 1 September 1840. The Dessau-Bitterfeld line (opened on 17 August 1857) was electrified in 1911, the first fully electrified long-distance railway in Germany. Dessau was part of the InterCity long-distance network until the year 2002. Regional trains also stop at the stations Dessau-Süd, Dessau-Alten, Dessau-Mosigkau and Rodleben. The &quot;Dessau-Wörlitzer-Eisenbahn&quot; (railway) connects Dessau to Wörlitz, a town situated 15 km to the east, and the Wörlitzer Park. The starting point of this railway is the main station. This train also stops at the stations Dessau-Waldersee and Dessau-Adria.

===Roads===

In 1938 the autobahn A9 (Munich-Berlin) was built southeast of the town area. The two exits to Dessau on the A9 are called Dessau-Ost and Dessau-Süd. Dessau is also crossed by the Bundesstrassen (federal roads) B 184 and B 185.

===Airfield===
The airfield of Dessau (ICAO: EDAD) is situated northwest of the town between the districts Kleinkühnau, Alten, and Siedlung. A destination with a charter airplane is possible. The runway has a length of 1000 m. The Hugo Junkers Technical Museum is situated in the neighbourhood directly east of the airfield, with the eastern end of the modern runway almost directly abutting the historical World War II Junkers factory airstrip&#x27;s western end.

===Water===
Today the Leopoldshafen (harbour) is used for annual international motorboat racing events. The &quot;Wallwitzhafen&quot; is used as a private pleasure boat harbour and the Elbehafen near the Grain House is used for cruisers. The next harbour for goods is situated in Rosslau.

===Bikes===
Dessau is located in the flat landscape of the Saxon Lowland. The local bike paths have a length of about 146 km and connect all major parks and sights.

==Governance==
The borough of Dessau was first mentioned in 1372. The head of the town of Schultheiss was appointed by the count. Together with a few assessors, the Schultheiss formed the town council. As of 1372, the town council was divided into two agencies, as of 1600 into three agencies, and as of 1785 again into two agencies. The Schultheiss of Dessau changed nearly every year until the town council constitution was cancelled in 1832. Afterwards Dessau became a Town Council and a Town Delegation Constitution. Since 1852 the town leader has the title of mayor. During the National Socialist period the mayor was appointed by the party (NSDAP). After World War II, the Soviets formed an executive council with a mayor. The town council constitution was elected by the people. Since German reunification this committee has been freely elected. Since 1994 it has been called the Stadtrat. Since 1994, the mayor is directly elected by the people.

<text>Whitby is a seaside town, port and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. It is on the Yorkshire Coast at the mouth of the River Esk and has a maritime, mineral and tourist economy.

From the Middle Ages, Whitby had significant herring and whaling fleets, and was where Captain Cook learned seamanship. He first explored the southern ocean in HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot;, built there.

Alum was mined locally, and Whitby jet jewellery was fashionable during the 19th century.

Tourism started in Whitby during the Georgian period and developed with the arrival of the railway in 1839. The abbey ruin at the top of the East Cliff is the town&#x27;s oldest and most prominent landmark. Other significant features include the swing bridge, which crosses the River Esk and the harbour sheltered by grade II listed east and west piers. There are statues of Captain Cook and William Scoresby, and a whalebone arch on the West Cliff. Whitby featured in literary works including Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot;.

Whitby is from York and from Middlesbrough.

==History==
===Priests and harrying===
Whitby was called &quot;Streanæshalc&quot;, &quot;Streneshalc&quot;, &quot;Streoneshalch&quot;, &quot;Streoneshalh&quot;, and &quot;Streunes-Alae in Lindissi&quot; in records of the 7th and 8th centuries. &quot;Prestebi&quot;, from Old Norse (&quot;village&quot;) and (&quot;of the priests&quot;), is an 11th-century name. Its name was recorded as &quot;Hwitebi&quot; and &quot;Witebi&quot;, from the Old Norse from (&quot;white&quot;) and (&quot;village&quot;), in the 12th century, &quot;Whitebi&quot; in the 13th century and &quot;Qwiteby&quot; in the 14th century.

A monastery was founded at Streanæshealh in 657 AD by King Oswiu or Oswy of Northumbria, as an act of thanksgiving, after defeating Penda, the pagan king of Mercia. At its foundation, the abbey was an Anglo-Saxon &#x27;double monastery&#x27; for men and women. Its first abbess, the royal princess Hild, was later venerated as a saint. The abbey became a centre of learning, and here Cædmon the cowherd was &quot;miraculously&quot; transformed into an inspired poet whose poetry is an example of Anglo-Saxon literature. The abbey became the leading royal nunnery of the kingdom of Deira, and the burial-place of its royal family. The Synod of Whitby, in 664, established the Roman date of Easter in Northumbria at the expense of the Celtic one.

The monastery was destroyed between 867 and 870 in a series of raids by Vikings from Denmark under their leaders Ingwar and Ubba. Its site remained desolate for more than 200 years until after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. After the Conquest, the area was granted to William de Percy who, in 1078 donated land to found a Benedictine monastery dedicated to St Peter and St Hilda. William de Percy&#x27;s gift included land for the monastery, the town and port of Whitby and St Mary&#x27;s Church and dependent chapels at Fyling, Hawsker, Sneaton, Ugglebarnby, Dunsley, and Aislaby, five mills including Ruswarp, Hackness with two mills and two churches.

When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, Whitby was recorded being partially waste and a small settlement lying within the Langbaurgh Wapentake of Yorkshire. Further details reveal the state of Whitby&#x27;s economic and agricultural decline (when compared with its pre-Conquest state under Earl Siward) which were due to the depredations of William the Conqueror&#x27;s army during the Harrying of the North in 1069–70.

In about 1128 Henry I granted the abbey burgage in Whitby and permission to hold a fair at the feast of St Hilda on 25 August. A second fair was held close to St Hilda&#x27;s winter feast at Martinmas. Market rights were granted to the abbey and descended with the liberty.

===Blubber, Cook and dissolution===
Whitby Abbey surrendered in December 1539 when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries. By 1540 the town had between 20 and 30 houses and a population of about 200.
The burgesses, who had little independence under the abbey, tried to obtain self-government after the dissolution of the monasteries. The king ordered Letters Patent to be drawn up granting their requests, but it was not implemented. In 1550 the Liberty of Whitby Strand, except for Hackness, was granted to the Earl of Warwick who in 1551 conveyed it to Sir John York and his wife Anne who sold the lease to the Cholmleys. In the reign of Elizabeth I, Whitby was a small fishing port. In 1635 the owners of the liberty governed the port and town where 24 burgesses had the privilege of buying and selling goods brought in by sea. Burgage tenure continued until the (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. x), entrusted government of the towto a board of improvement commissioners, elected by the ratepayers.

At the end of the 16th century Thomas Chaloner visited alum works in the Papal States where he observed that the rock being processed was similar to that under his Guisborough estate. At that time alum was important for medicinal uses, in curing leather and for fixing dyed cloths and the Papal States and Spain maintained monopolies on its production and sale. Chaloner secretly brought workmen to develop the industry in Yorkshire, and alum was produced near Sandsend Ness from Whitby in the reign of James I. Once the industry was established, imports were banned and although the methods in its production were laborious, England became self-sufficient.
Whitby grew significantly as a port as a result of the alum trade and by importing coal from the Durham coalfield to process it.

Whitby grew in size and wealth, extending its activities to include shipbuilding using local oak timber. In 1790–91 Whitby built 11,754 tons of shipping, making it the third largest shipbuilder in England, after London and Newcastle. Taxes on imports entering the port raised money to improve and extend the town&#x27;s twin piers, improving the harbour and permitting further increases in trade. In 1753 the first whaling ship set sail to Greenland and by 1795 Whitby had become a major whaling port. The most successful year was 1814 when eight ships caught 172 whales, and the whaler, the &quot;Resolution&quot;&#x27;s catch produced 230 tons of oil. The carcases yielded 42 tons of whale bone used for &#x27;stays&#x27; which were used in the corsetry trade until changes in fashion made them redundant. Blubber was boiled to produce oil for use in lamps in four oil houses on the harbourside. Oil was used for street lighting until the spread of gas lighting reduced demand and the Whitby Whale Oil and Gas Company changed into the Whitby Coal and Gas Company. As the market for whale products fell, catches became too small to be economic and by 1831 only one whaling ship, the &quot;Phoenix,&quot; remained.

Whitby benefited from trade between the Newcastle coalfield and London, both by shipbuilding and supplying transport. In his youth the explorer James Cook learned his trade on colliers, shipping coal from the port. HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot;, the ship commanded by Cook on his voyage to Australia and New Zealand, was built in Whitby in 1764 by Tomas Fishburn as a coal carrier named &quot;Earl of Pembroke&quot;. She was bought by the Royal Navy 1768, refitted and renamed.

Whitby developed as a spa town in Georgian times when three chalybeate springs were in demand for their medicinal and tonic qualities. Visitors were attracted to the town leading to the building of &quot;lodging-houses&quot; and hotels, particularly on the West Cliff.

===Rail and jet===
In 1839, the Whitby and Pickering Railway connecting Whitby to Pickering and eventually to York was built, and played a part in the town&#x27;s development as a tourism destination. George Hudson, who promoted the link to York, was responsible for the development of the Royal Crescent which was partly completed. For 12 years from 1847, Robert Stephenson, son of George Stephenson, engineer to the Whitby and Pickering Railway, was the Conservative MP for the town promoted by Hudson as a fellow protectionist.

The black mineraloid jet, the compressed remains of ancestors of the monkey-puzzle tree, is found in the cliffs and on the moors and has been used since the Bronze Age to make beads. The Romans are known to have mined it in the area. In Victorian times jet was brought to Whitby by pack pony to be made into decorative items. It was at the peak of its popularity in the mid-19th century when it was favoured for mourning jewellery by Queen Victoria after the death of Prince Albert.

The advent of iron ships in the late 19th century and the development of port facilities on the River Tees led to the decline of smaller Yorkshire harbours. The &quot;Monks-haven&quot; launched in 1871 was the last wooden ship built in Whitby, and a year later the harbour was silted up.

===20th century===

On 30 October 1914, the hospital ship &quot;Rohilla&quot; was sunk, hitting the rocks within sight of shore just off Whitby at Saltwick Bay. Of the 220 people on board, 74 died in the disaster.

In a raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914, the town was shelled by the German battlecruisers &quot;Von der Tann&quot; and &quot;Derfflinger&quot;. In the final assault on the Yorkshire coast, the ships aimed their guns at the signal post on the end of the headland. Whitby Abbey sustained considerable damage in the attack, which lasted ten minutes. The German squadron responsible for the strike escaped despite attempts made by the Royal Navy.

During the early 20th century the fishing fleet kept the harbour busy, and few cargo boats used the port. It was revitalised as a result of a strike at Hull docks in 1955, when six ships were diverted and unloaded their cargoes on the fish quay. Endeavour Wharf, near the railway station, was opened in 1964 by the local council. The number of vessels using the port in 1972 was 291, increased from 64 in 1964. Timber, paper and chemicals are imported, while exports include steel, furnace-bricks and doors. The port is owned and managed by Scarborough Borough Council since the Harbour Commissioners relinquished responsibility in 1905.

A marina was started in 1979 by dredging the upper harbour and laying pontoons. Light industry and car parks occupy the adjacent land. More pontoons were completed in 1991 and 1995. The Whitby Marina Facilities Centre was opened in June 2010.

==Governance==

By an Act of 1837 government of the town was entrusted to a board of Improvement Commissioners, elected by the ratepayers. A Local Board was formed in 1872, and lasted until Whitby Urban District Council was formed under the Local Government Act 1894. The townships of Whitby, Ruswarp and Hawsker-cum-Stainsacre were formed into a Parliamentary borough under the Reform Act 1832 returning one member until the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.

From 1974 to 2023 Whitby was administered as part of a two tier council system by Scarborough Borough Council, one of the seven district councils in North Yorkshire. For borough council purposes the town comprised three wards: Mayfield, Streonshalh and Whitby West Cliff. The borough council was a non-metropolitan district, responsible for housing, planning, leisure and recreation, waste collection, environmental health and revenue collection. Above the Borough council was North Yorkshire County Council, which was a non-metropolitan county providing education, transport, highways, fire, waste disposal, social and library services.

In April 2023 both councils were replaced by North Yorkshire Council along with all district councils in North Yorkshire. The unitary authority now provides all the services previously provided separately by the two councils.

At the lowest level of governance Whitby has a town council which, for election and administrative purposes, is divided into six electoral wards represented by 19 councillors responsible for burial grounds, allotments, play areas and street lighting. Elections to the town council are held every four years.

In the UK Parliament, the town is represented by Alison Hume of the Labour Party, who was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Scarborough and Whitby constituency in 2024.

==Religion==

In the three wards that make up the Whitby district of North Yorkshire, out of a population of 13,596 there are 10,286 who stated that their religion was Christian in the 2001 UK census. There were 19 Muslims, 17 Buddhists, 12 Jews, 3 Sikhs and 499 people had no religious affiliations.

St Mary&#x27;s Church is an ancient foundation, St Ninian&#x27;s opened in Baxtergate in 1778 and St John&#x27;s, also on Baxtergate, was consecrated in 1850. St Michael&#x27;s was opened in 1856 and St Hilda&#x27;s on the West Cliff was built in 1885. The Roman Catholic church dedicated to St Hilda was built in 1867 on Baxtergate. There are places of worship for nonconformists including a United Reformed Church; two Methodist chapels are no longer used. The Mission to Seafarers maintains a Christian ministry and has a chapel, reading room and recreational facilities.

The Bishop of Whitby is a suffragan bishop of the Church of England Diocese of York, in the Province of York. The town lies within the Central Vicariate of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Middlesbrough.

==Geography==
Whitby is situated on the east coast of Yorkshire facing the North Sea in a deep valley at the mouth of the River Esk. It has been a bridging point since at least medieval times and several bridges have spanned the river. The current bridge, built in 1908, is a swing bridge with a span that separates the upper and lower harbours which have a total area of around . The houses are built of brick or stone, often with red pantiled roofs, in narrow, steep streets, on both sides of the river.

The town is surrounded on its landward sides by the moorland of the North York Moors National Park and the North Sea abuts it on the seaward side. The coastal areas are designated part of the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Heritage Coast. 
The harbour and the mouth of the River Esk are on a geological fault. On the east side the cliff is tall, , and consists of alternating layers of shale, sandstone and clay. On the west side the cliff is much lower and has a deep capping of boulder clay over a sandstone base making it less stable and liable to slippage. Both cliffs are being eroded quite rapidly.

===Fossils and snakestones===

The town is a coastal stretch known as the Dinosaur Coast or the Fossil Coast, the area is around long and stretches from Staithes in the north and south to Flamborough. At Whitby dinosaur footprints are visible on the beach. The rock strata contain fossils and organic remains including jet. Fossils include the petrified bones of an almost complete crocodile and a specimen of plesiosaurus measuring in length, and in breadth was discovered in 1841. The Rotunda Museum in Scarborough has a comprehensive collection of fossils from the area.

Smaller fossils include numerous species of ammonites, or &quot;snake stones&quot;, from the Whitby Mudstone Formation (Alum Shale Member) and at Whitby Scar nautiloids in the lower beds of the lias strata. The town&#x27;s folklore (similar to Keynsham&#x27;s in Somerset) has it that fossils were once living serpents that were common in the area. This was until the 7th century AD when Anglo-Saxon Abbess St Hilda of Whitby (614–680), first had to rid the region of snakes. She did so by casting a spell that turned them to stone and then threw them from the cliff tops.

Local collectors and dealers in fossils often carved heads on ammonites to increase curiosity value and improve sales. Since 1935, the Whitby Coat of Arms incorporates three snakestones due to this folklore. The Hildoceras genus of ammonite is named in St Hilda&#x27;s honour.

==Economy==

Tourism supported by fishing is the mainstay of Whitby&#x27;s economy in an isolated community with poor transport infrastructure and restricted by building constraints in the surrounding North York Moors National Park. The economy is governed by the changing fortunes of fishing, tourism and to some extent, manufacturing. Structural changes have led to concentrations of deprivation, unemployment and benefit dependence. A narrowing employment base and dependence on low wage and low skill sectors has resulted in younger age groups leaving the area. There are few business start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises. Older people who make increasing demands on the area&#x27;s health and social care capacity have moved into the area. Demographic changes, Whitby&#x27;s relative isolation from the region&#x27;s main growth areas and decline in traditional employment sectors pose an economic challenge.

The town has a variety of self-catering accommodation, holiday cottages, caravans and campsites, and guest houses, inns, bed &amp; breakfast establishments and hotels. The jet industry declined at the end of the 19th century, but eight shops sell jet jewellery, mainly as souvenirs to tourists. In 1996, Whitby West Cliff qualified for a &#x27;Tidy Britain Group Seaside Award&#x27;. The town was awarded &quot;Best Seaside Resort 2006&quot;, by &quot;Which? Holiday&quot; magazine.

The harbour has a total area of about and is used by commercial, fishing and pleasure craft. Inshore fishing, particularly for crustaceans and line fish, takes place along the coast. Lobsters, brown and velvet crabs are important to the local fishery. From May to August, salmon is found in the Esk, and small open boats are licensed to net these off the harbour entrance. There are around 40 licensed angling party boats. The commercial catch is no longer herring but has been replaced by cod, haddock, and other fish caught within of the coast. A fish market on the quayside operates as need arises. The ready supply of fresh fish has resulted in an abundance of &quot;chippies&quot; in the town, including the Magpie Cafe which Rick Stein has described as the best fish and chip shop in Britain.

The Whitby Marina project, jointly funded by Scarborough Borough Council, Yorkshire Forward and the European Regional Development Fund, was developed to diversify the local economy. The remaining shipbuilding firm, Parkol Marine, is a family-run business on the east side of the river. Founded in 1988, the boatyard has two berths for new build and a dry dock for repairs. St Hilda&#x27;s Business Centre provides office space for a range of businesses. Whitby Business Park is a site located by the A171 road, from the harbour on the southern outskirts of the town. Companies on the park include Supreme Plastics, Whitby Seafoods Ltd and Botham&#x27;s of Whitby alongside major retailers, Homebase and Sainsbury&#x27;s.

The east coast has limited conventional energy generation capacity, but Whitby is the closest port to a proposed development on Dogger Bank, ideally placed to provide the offshore wind power industry with support vessel operations and logistics. The Dogger Bank wind farm could include up to 2,600 giant turbines covering more than .

==Transport==
===Port===

Whitby&#x27;s port is used for shipping to Europe, especially Scandinavia, and mainly handles grain, steel products, timber and potash. Vessels limited to 3,000 tonnes deadweight tonnage can dock at the wharf, which is able to load or unload two ships simultaneously. , of dock space is used to store all-weather cargo, with a warehouse.

===Rail===

Whitby railway station is a terminus of the Esk Valley Line from Middlesbrough, operated by Northern.

It was formerly the northern terminus of the Whitby, Pickering and York Line. In 2007, the North Yorkshire Moors Railway began a summer service on that line between Pickering and Whitby operated by steam locomotives, as an extension of their long-standing Pickering-Grosmont service.

The Scarborough and Whitby Railway followed a coastal route and was built in 1885. It required construction of the red brick Larpool Viaduct across the Esk Valley into Whitby. The line closed as a result of the Beeching cuts in 1965; the trackbed is now used as a footpath, bridleway and by cyclists.

The Whitby, Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway had a station at Whitby West Cliff and ran close to the cliffs to the north of the town. It opened in 1883 and closed in 1958.

===Road===

Whitby is situated on the A171 road from Scarborough to Guisborough, which originally passed over the swing bridge. A high level bridge over the Esk Valley was built in 1980 to avoid the bridge and ease congestion in the town centre. The A174 accesses coastal towns to the north and the A169 crosses the North Yorkshire Moors to Pickering.

Whitby is on the Yorkshire Coastliner bus route to Leeds, Tadcaster, York, Scarborough, Bridlington, Pickering and Malton.

Arriva North East runs bus services connecting Whitby to Scarborough and Middlesbrough.

===Walking===

The coastal section of the Cleveland Way National Trail passes through Whitby.

==Public services==
Whitby Community Hospital was formerly run by the Scarborough and North East Yorkshire Health Care NHS Trust, and more recently by the Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust. In February 2018 it was decided to redevelop the hospital site at a cost of £12 million into a &quot;health and wellbeing hub&quot; with an urgent care centre and 19 inpatient beds.

Five general practitioners and five dentists serve the Whitby area.

Yorkshire Ambulance Service provides transport throughout Yorkshire.

Whitby fire station is manned by North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service between 8 am and 6 pm.

The town&#x27;s two police stations are provided by North Yorkshire Police Authority.

lifeboat station built in 2007, on the east bank, is operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Crew members are unpaid volunteers and the station has two lifeboats, an inshore D class lifeboat the &quot;Warter Priory&quot; which was donated to the station in 2017, and an all-weather Shannon-class lifeboat, the &quot;Lois Ivan&quot;, launched in 2023.

North Yorkshire County Council waste management services operate a household waste recycling centre at Whitby Industrial Estate, and a weekly collection alternating between recyclables and landfill waste.

Mains water supply, predominantly from the River Esk, is treated at Ruswarp Water Treatment Works by Yorkshire Water who also deal with the town&#x27;s sewerage.

CE Electric UK is responsible for delivering electricity and Northern Gas Networks supply piped gas.

==Education==
Whitby has a three-tier school system, primary, middle (11–14) and Caedmon College (11–19), the latter formed in 2014 from the merger of Caedmon School (11–14) and Whitby Community College (14–19). Eskdale School continues to operate as a middle school, but is currently consulting on raising its age range to 16. In February 2018 Caedmon College and Eskdale School agreed to federate and plan to provide a joint sixth form in the town.

The primary schools are St Hilda&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School, Stakesby Community Primary School, West Cliff Primary School, Airy Hill Community Primary School and East Whitby Community Primary School. North Yorkshire County Council provides education services.

The Whitby and District Fishing Industry Training School offers training for new entrants to the fishing industry, and experienced fishermen.

==Landmarks==

The swing bridge spanning the Esk divides the upper and lower harbours and joins the east and west sides of the town. Whitby developed as an important bridging point of the River Esk and in 1351 permission was granted for tolls to be taken on the bridge for its maintenance. In 1609 a survey for a new bridge was commissioned while in 1628 it was described as a drawbridge where men raised planks to let vessels pass and tolls were collected. The bridge posts were rebuilt in stone at a cost of £3,000 in 1766. This structure was replaced by a four-arched bridge between 1833 and 1835, one arch made of cast iron swivelled to allow vessels to pass. This bridge was replaced between 1908 and 1909 by the current electric swing bridge.

The bridge allowed the town to spread onto the west bank, whilst the east bank, the Haggerlythe, is dominated by St Mary&#x27;s Church and the ruins of Whitby Abbey which is owned by English Heritage. St Mary&#x27;s Church is a grade I listed building on the site of a Saxon church. The church&#x27;s ancient foundation dates from the 12th century. Over time it has been extensively altered and enlarged but retains several features including box pews. The East Cliff is quite a distance by road from the church, the alternative is to climb the 199 steps of the &quot;Church Stairs&quot; or use the footpath called &quot;Caedmon&#x27;s Trod&quot;. The stone stairs, which replaced the original wooden steps, were built about 200 years ago and renovated between 2005 and 2006. There are landings originally assisting coffin bearers on their journey to the graveyard on the cliff top.
The harbour is sheltered by the grade II listed east and west piers each with a lighthouse and beacon. The west lighthouse, of 1831, is the taller at and the east lighthouse, built in 1855, is high. On the west pier extension is a foghorn that sounds a blast every 30 seconds during fog. New lights were fitted to both the lighthouse towers and the beacons in 2011. Whitby Lighthouse, operated by Trinity House, is south-east of the town on Ling Hill.

On the West Cliff is a statue of Captain James Cook who served his apprenticeship in the town, and a whalebone arch, commemorates the whaling industry. It is the second such arch, the original is preserved in Whitby Archives Heritage Centre. By the inner harbour is a statue commemorating William Scoresby Sr. (father of William Scoresby Jr.), designer of the crow&#x27;s nest.

On the outskirts of town to the west is the 19th-century Sneaton Castle built by James Wilson who sold his sugar plantation where he had over 200 slaves and moved to Whitby. Alongside it is St Hilda&#x27;s Priory, the mother house of the Order of the Holy Paraclete. The castle was used as a school and is now a conference centre and hotel in association with the priory.

==Culture and media==
Frank Meadow Sutcliffe left a photographic record of the town, harbour, fishing and residents in late-Victorian times. His most famous photograph entitled &quot;Water Rats&quot; was taken in 1886. He became famous internationally as a great exponent of pictorial photography. He exhibited his work in Tokyo, Vienna, France, the US and Great Britain winning over 60 gold, silver and bronze medals. He retired in 1922 and became curator of Whitby Museum. The Royal Photographic Society made him an honorary member in 1935. A gallery of his work is located on Flowergate.

Pannett Park was built on land purchased by a local philanthropist and politician Alderman Robert Pannett in 1902. After his death in 1928, the trust he set up created a public park and art gallery. In 1931 Whitby Museum was built behind the gallery by the Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society. It holds a collection of the archaeological and social history of jet and has on display a &quot;Hand of Glory&quot;. The Friends of Pannett Park, formed in 2005, successfully bid for a Heritage Lottery Fund grant to refurbish the park.

There has been a lifeboat in Whitby since 1802 and the old boathouse, built in 1895 and used until 1957, is a museum displaying the &quot;Robert and Ellen Robson&quot; lifeboat, built in 1919.

The ancient Penny Hedge ceremony is performed on the eve of Ascension Day commemorating a penance imposed by the abbot on miscreant hunters in the Middle Ages. The hunters using a knife costing a penny had to cut wood in Eskdaleside and take it to Whitby harbour where it was made into a hedge that would survive three tides. This tradition is carried out annually on the east side of the upper harbour.

The &quot;Whitby Gazette&quot; was founded in 1854 by Ralph Horne, a local printer. The first issues were records of visitors and lodgings rather than a newspaper. The publication became a weekly newspaper in 1858, with a short spell of being published twice weekly between 2000 and 2012. The local radio stations are BBC Radio Tees, This is The Coast and Coast &amp; County Radio

The Pavilion Theatre built in the 1870s in West Cliff hosts a range of events during the summer months. For over four decades the town has hosted the Whitby Folk Week, and since 1993 the bi-annual Whitby Goth Weekend for members of the Goth subculture. &quot;Whitby Now&quot; is an annual live music event featuring local bands in the Pavilion which has taken place since 1991. Since 2008, the Bram Stoker Film Festival has taken place in October.

===Literature===
The town has a strong literary tradition; it can even be said that the earliest English literature comes from Whitby as Cædmon, the first known Anglo Saxon poet was a monk at the order that used Whitby Abbey during the abbacy of St Hilda (657–680). Part of Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot; was set in Whitby, incorporating pieces of local folklore, including the beaching of the Russian ship &quot;Dmitry&quot;. Stoker discovered the name &quot;Dracula&quot; at the old public library. One scholar has suggested that Stoker chose Whitby as the site of Dracula&#x27;s first appearance in England because of the Synod of Whitby, given the novel&#x27;s preoccupation with timekeeping and calendar disputes. Elizabeth Gaskell set her novel &quot;Sylvia&#x27;s Lovers&quot; partly in the town which she visited in 1859 and Lewis Carroll stayed at 5, East Terrace between July and September 1854: his first publications may have been published in the &quot;Whitby Gazette&quot;.

Charles Dickens is known to have visited Whitby, and in a letter of 1861 to his friend Wilkie Collins, who was at the time in Whitby, Dickens says:

In my time that curious railroad by the Whitby Moor was so much the more curious, that you were balanced against a counter-weight of water, and that you did it like Blondin. But in these remote days the one inn of Whitby was up a back-yard, and oyster-shell grottoes were the only view from the best private room.
Wilkie Collins stayed in Whitby to work on his novel, &quot;No Name&quot;. He was accompanied by Caroline Graves, the inspiration for &quot;The Woman in White&quot;.
Mary Linskill was born in a small house at Blackburn&#x27;s Yard in 1840. She reached a wide readership when her second novel, &quot;Between the Heather and the Northern Sea&quot;, was published in 1884. Her last novel &quot;For Pity&#x27;s Sake&quot;, was published posthumously in 1891. James Russell Lowell, the American writer, visited Whitby while ambassador in London 1880–85, staying at 3 Wellington Terrace, West Cliff. On his last visit in 1889, he wrote:

This is my ninth year at Whitby and the place loses none of its charm for me.

G. P. Taylor, a former Church of England curate in Whitby, is now a celebrated author. His best-selling book &quot;Shadowmancer&quot; was set in Whitby. Theresa Tomlinson, a writer of historical and other fiction for children and young adults, lives in the town.

The novel &quot;Possession: A Romance&quot; by A. S. Byatt, set in the town, was adapted into a 2002 feature film called &quot;Possession&quot; starring Gwyneth Paltrow.

In the British Television drama series &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (1992–2010), set in the 1960s Yorkshire, the plot frequently takes place in Whitby over the seasons.

A crime novel series by James Whitworth is set in Whitby. The first two novels are &quot;Death&#x27;s Disciple&quot; and &quot;The Eve of Murder&quot;. These were followed by &quot;Bidding to Die&quot;, &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot; and &quot;Murder on the Record&quot;.

A trilogy of young adult novels, &quot;The Whitby Witches&quot;, makes much of the town&#x27;s setting and history, embellishing local traditions whilst incorporating them into the narrative. The author, Robin Jarvis, recalls &quot;The first time I visited Whitby, I stepped off the train and knew I was somewhere very special. It was a grey, drizzling day but that only added to the haunting beauty and lonely atmosphere of the place. Listening to Carmina Burana on my headphones, I explored the ruined abbey on the clifftop. The place was a fantastic inspiration. In &quot;The Whitby Witches&quot; I have interwoven many of the existing local legends, such as the frightening Barguest, whilst inventing a few of my own, most notably the aufwaders.&quot; Jarvis returned to Whitby for his 2016 novel, &quot;The Power of Dark&quot;, the first in The Witching Legacy series.

==Climate==
The area generally has warm summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary from day to day as well as from season to season. Its latitude means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing unsettled and windy weather particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fine weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. The two dominant influences on the climate of the Whitby area are shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the North York Moors and the proximity of the North Sea. Late, chilly springs and warm summers are a feature of the area but there are often spells of fine autumn weather. Onshore winds in spring and early summer bring mists or low stratus clouds (known locally as sea frets) to the coast and moors.


On 5 January 2016 the town was seriously affected by flash floods. North Yorkshire Police cautioned motorists to drive with &quot;extreme caution&quot; and advised that the area be avoided &quot;unless absolutely necessary&quot;.

<text>Charles-Joseph Lamoral, 7th Prince de Ligne in French; in German Karl-Joseph Lamoral 7. Fürst von Ligne (also known as Karl Fürst von Ligne or &quot;Fürst de Ligne&quot;): (23 May 1735 – 13 December 1814) was a field marshal, inhaber of an infantry regiment, prolific writer, intellectual, member of the princely family of Ligne. He fought as a field officer during several famous battles during the Seven Years&#x27; War and briefly returned to military duty in the War of the Bavarian Succession. He performed an important diplomatic mission to Catherine the Great in 1787 and led troops against the Turks at Belgrade in 1789. Beginning in the 1770s, he authored an impressive volume of work. After his estates in the Austrian Netherlands were lost to France during the War of the First Coalition, he lived in Vienna. All three of his sons died before him, but his wife and four daughters all outlived him. His grandson, the 8th Prince, became a Belgian statesman.

==Military service==
Prince Charles-Joseph de Ligne was born in Brussels, Austrian Netherlands, the son of Field Marshal Claude Lamoral, 6th Prince of Ligne and Princess Elisabeth Alexandrina zu Salm, daughter of Ludwig Otto, 5th Prince zu Salm and his wife Princess Albertine of Nassau-Hadamar.

As an Austrian subject he entered the imperial army at an early age. He distinguished himself by his valor in the Seven Years&#x27; War, notably at Breslau, Leuthen, Hochkirch and Maxen. A young captain at Leuthen, he found himself suddenly in command of 200 men, the battalion colonels and majors having been killed, and led them to shelter from Prussian cannon fire beside a windmill; subsequently, he participated in the retreat to Königsburg.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War, de Ligne was promoted major in 1757, &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; in 1758, and &quot;Oberst&quot; (colonel) in 1759. He was named general-major on 23 April 1764 and &quot;Feldmarschall-Leutnant&quot; on 1 May 1773. He was awarded the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1772. He was appointed Inhaber (proprietor) of Infantry Regiment Nr. 30 in 1771, the successor to Prince William Carl Christian of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.

He became the intimate friend and counselor of Emperor Joseph II, and, inheriting his father&#x27;s vast estates, lived in the greatest splendor and luxury until the War of the Bavarian Succession brought him again into active service.

In 1778, de Ligne was impressed by a captured Prussian officer Flemming von Hagen, who was asked about his girl friends by his captors and replied, &quot;I love nothing more dearly than my sword&quot;. He wished that more Austrian officers were as serious about their military profession. King Frederick the Great of Prussia built a number of palaces and other buildings in Potsdam, but upon closer inspection, the place had a seedy appearance. de Ligne wrote that Frederick had a chance to do something new in Potsdam, but &quot;he believed that he could bend Nature to his will by the force of his intellect, in the same way as he attained his victories, and managed war, politics, population, finances and industries. But Nature has a way of laughing at heroes. She prefers a Somerset farmer&quot;.

This war was short and uneventful, and the prince then traveled in England, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and France, devoting himself impartially to the courts, the camps, the salons and the learned assemblies of philosophers and scientists in each country. He developed a great admiration for Frederick the Great, even to the point of justifying his seizure of Silesia.

De Ligne was promoted to &quot;Feldzeugmeister&quot; (full general) on 8 September 1787. He earned the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa on 12 October 1789.

In 1787 he was with Catherine II in Russia and accompanied her in her journey to the Crimea. In 1789 he was present at the Siege of Belgrade.

Shortly after the siege of Belgrade, he was invited to place himself at the head of the Belgian revolutionary movement, in which one of his sons and many of his relatives were prominent, but declined with great courtesy, saying that &quot;he never revolted in the winter.&quot; Though suspected by Joseph of collusion with the rebels, the two friends were not long estranged, and after the death of the emperor the prince remained in Vienna.

He was appointed Grand Bailiff of Hainaut in 1791. After entering diplomacy, his sympathy for the Belgian rebels closed the door to him. During the annexation by France in 1792, his property was confiscated. He never saw his Château de Beloeil again, which was sequestered, and settled permanently in Vienne in 1792.

His Brabant estates were overrun by the French in 1792–93, and his eldest son killed in action at La Croix-du Bois in the Argonne (14 September 1792). He was given an honorary command at court.

==Later life==
De Ligne served as captain of the Trabanten Life Guard (Gentlemen at Arms) and the Hofburgwache (Palace Bodyguard) from 13 June 1807 until his death. He received promotion to &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; on 6 September 1808.

Despite the loss of his estates, Charles-Joseph lived in comparative luxury in his later life, and devoted himself to his literary work. He lived long enough to characterize the proceedings of the Congress of Vienna with the famous mot: &quot;&quot;Le Congrès ne marche pas, il danse&quot;.&quot; (The Congress does not march, it dances.) He has been described as one of the most charming men who ever lived. He died, aged 79, in Vienna in December 1814 and was buried at the &quot;Kahlenberg&quot; cemetery. In 1815, the proprietorship of Infantry Regiment Nr. 30 passed to Laval Nugent von Westmeath.

==Collected works==
His collected works appeared in thirty-four volumes at Vienna during the last years of his life (&quot;Mélanges militaires, littéraires, sentimentaires&quot;), and he bequeathed his manuscripts to the emperor&#x27;s Trabant Guard, of which he was captain (&quot;Œuvres posthumes&quot;, Dresden and Vienna, 1817). Selections were published in French, German and English:
* &quot;Œuvres choisies de M. le prince de Ligne&quot; (Paris, 1809)
* &quot;Lettres et pensées du Maréchal Prince de Ligne&quot;, ed. by Madame de Staël-Holstein (1809)
* &quot;&quot; (Brussels, 1859)
* &quot;Des Prinzen Karl von Ligne militärische Werke&quot;, ed. Count Pappenheim (Sulzbach, 1814)
* &quot;Memoir of Charles-Joseph, Prince de Ligne,&quot; ed. Katharine Prescott Wormeley (Boston, 1902)
The most important of his numerous works on all military subjects is the &quot;Fantaisies et préjuge&#x27;s militaires&quot;, which originally appeared in 1780. A modern edition is that published by J Dumaine (Paris, 1879). A German version (&quot;Miltarische Vorurtheile und Phantasien, etc.&quot;) appeared as early as 1783. This work, though it deals lightly and cavalierly with the most important subjects (the prince even proposes to found an international academy of the art of war, wherein the reputation of generals could be impartially weighed), is a military classic, and indispensable to the students of the post-Frederician period. On the whole, it may be said that the prince adhered to the school of Guibert, and a full discussion will be found in Max Jahns&#x27; &quot;Gesch. d. Kriegswissenschaften&quot;. Another very celebrated work by the prince is the mock autobiography of Prince Eugène of Savoy (1809).

Other works of his include:
* &quot;Lettres à Eugénie sur les spectacles&quot; (1774)
* &quot;Céphalide, ou les Autres mariages samnites&quot;, comédie en musique (1777)
* &quot;Préjugés&quot; et &quot;Fantaisies militaires&quot; (1780)
* &quot;Colette et Lucas&quot;, comédie en musique (1781)
* &quot;Coup d&#x27;œil sur Belœil&quot; (1781)
* &quot;Fantaisies militaires&quot; (1783)
* &quot;L&#x27;Amant ridicule&quot;, proverbe en prose (1787)
* &quot;Mélanges militaires, littéraires et sentimentaires&quot; (1795–1811)
* &quot;Mémoires sur les Juifs&quot; (1795–1811)
* &quot;Les Embarras&quot;, pièce en un acte (manuscrit)
* &quot;Contes immoraux&quot;

==Marriage and issue==
On 6 August 1755, in Valtice or Feldsberg, Charles-Joseph married Princess &quot;Franziska&quot; Xaveria Maria of Liechtenstein (Vienna, 27 November 1739 – Vienna, 17 May 1821), sister of Franz Joseph I, Prince of Liechtenstein. The couple had seven children.

* Princess Marie Christine Leopoldine (25 May 1757 Brussels – 13 September 1830 Teplice)
* Prince Charles Antoine Joseph Emanuel (25 September 1759 Brussels – 14 September 1792)
* Prince Francois Leopold (3 November 1764 – 6 January 1771)
* Prince Louis Eugene Marie Lamoral (7 May 1766 Brussels – 10 May 1813 Brussels)
* Prince Adalbert Xavier (26 August 1767 – 23 May 1771)
* Princess Euphemie Christine Philippine (18 July 1773 Brussels – 30 March 1834 Vienna)
* Princess Flore Adelaide Caroline (8 November 1775 Brussels – 9 December 1851 Vienna)

He also had two illegitimate daughters: &quot;Adèle&quot; (1809–1810) by Adelaide Fleury; and another one (?) (1770–1770) by Angélique d&#x27;Hannetaire (1749–1822).
Charles-Joseph legitimated in 1810 the illegitimate beloved daughter of his son Charles, called &quot;Fanny-Christine&quot; (4 January 1788 – 19 May 1867). She is called &quot;Titine&quot; in the diaries and letters of the family; she married Maurice O&#x27;Donnell von Tyrconnell (1780–1843).

His grandson, Eugène, 8th Prince de Ligne (1804–1880), was a distinguished Belgian statesman, and another grandson, Count Maximilian O&#x27;Donnell von Tyrconnell (1812–1895), helped save the life of Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria in Vienna in 1853.

<text>Jacques-Antoine-Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert (12 November 1743 – 6 May 1790) was a French general and military writer. Born at Montauban, he accompanied his father in wars before he became a general himself. In 1770, he published an essay on tactics which was very influential in his time.

==Biography==
He was born at Montauban, and at the age of thirteen accompanied his father, Charles-Benoît, comte de Guibert (1715–1786), chief of staff to Maréchal de Broglie, throughout the Seven Years&#x27; War in Germany, and was awarded the cross of St Louis and then promoted to the rank of colonel in the expedition to Corsica (1767).

In 1773 he visited Germany and was present at the Prussian regimental drills and army manœuvres; Frederick the Great, recognizing Guibert&#x27;s ability, showed great favour to the young comte and freely discussed military questions with him. Guibert&#x27;s &quot;Journal d&#x27;un voyage en Allemagne&quot; was published, with a memoir, by Toulongeon (Paris, 1803). His &quot;Défense du système de guerre moderne&quot;, a reply to his many critics (Neuchâtel, 1779) is a reasoned and scientific defence of the Prussian method of tactics, which formed the basis of his work when in 1775 he began to co-operate with the count de Saint-Germain in a series of much-needed and successful reforms in the French army. During those years, he also won the love of Julie de Lespinasse, whose love letters to him, later published, are still read today.

In 1777, however, Saint-Germain fell into disgrace, and his fall involved that of Guibert who was promoted to the rank of maréchal de camp and relegated to a provincial staff appointment. 
In his semi-retirement he vigorously defended his old chief Saint-Germain against his detractors. 
On the eve of the Revolution he was recalled to the War Office, but in his turn he became the object of attack and he died, practically of disappointment, on 6 May 1790.

==Writings==
In 1770 he published his &quot;Essai général de tactique&quot; in London, and this celebrated work appeared in numerous subsequent editions and in English, German and even Persian translations (extracts also in Liskenne and Sauvan, &quot;Bibl. historique et militaire&quot;, Paris, 1845). Of this work (for a detailed critique of which see Max Jahns, &quot;Gesch. d. Kriegswissenschaften&quot;, vol. iii. pp. 2058–2070 and references therein) it may be said that it was the best essay on war produced by a soldier during a period in which tactics were discussed even in the salon and military literature was more abundant than at any time up to 1871.

Apart from technical questions, in which Guibert&#x27;s enlightened conservatism stands in marked contrast to the doctrinaire progressiveness of Mesnil-Durand, Folard and others, the book is chiefly valued for its broad outlook on the state of Europe, especially of military Europe in the period 1763–1792. One quotation may be given as being a most remarkable prophecy of the impending revolution in the art of war, a revolution which the &quot;advanced&quot; tacticians themselves scarcely foresaw. &quot;The standing armies, while a burden on the people, are inadequate for the achievement of great and decisive results in war, and meanwhile the mass of the people, untrained in arms, degenerates. ... The hegemony over Europe will fall to that nation which ... becomes possessed of manly virtues and creates a national army&quot;—a prediction fulfilled almost to the letter within twenty years of Guibert&#x27;s death.

Other works of Guibert, besides those mentioned, are: &quot;Observations sur la constitution politique et militaire des armées de S. M. Prussienne&quot; (Amsterdam, 1778), &quot;Eloges&quot; of Marshal Catinat (1775), of Michel de l&#x27;Hôpital (1778), and of Frederick the Great (1787). Guibert was a member of the Académie française from 1786, and he also wrote a tragedy, &quot;Le Connétable de Bourbon&quot; (1775) and a journal of travels in France and Switzerland. His final work was &quot;De la force publique considérée par tous ses rapports&quot; (Paris: Didot l&#x27;aîné, 1790) in which he contradicted several of the postulates on militias and professional armies. Guibert&#x27;s writing on the subject - pondering the advantages and disadvantages of militias/conscript armies and mercenaries/professional forces until this day cover most fundamental arguments on the subject.

Guibert distinguished between &quot;tactics&quot; and &quot;grand tactics&quot; (which scholars today would refer to as grand strategy) in &quot;General Essay on Tactics.&quot;

<text>Victor François de Broglie, 2nd Duke of Broglie (19 October 171830 March 1804) was a French army officer. He served with his father, François Marie de Broglie, 1st Duke of Broglie, at Parma and Guastalla, and in 1734 obtained a colonelcy.

In the War of the Austrian Succession, he took part in the storming of Prague in 1742, and was made a brigadier. In 1744 and 1745 he saw further service on the Rhine, and he succeeded his father as 2nd duc de Broglie on the old duke&#x27;s death in 1745. He was made a &quot;Maréchal de Camp,&quot; and he subsequently served with Marshal de Saxe in the Low Countries, and was present at Roucoux, Val and Maastricht. At the end of the war, he was made a lieutenant-general.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War, he served successively under Louis Charles César Le Tellier, duc d&#x27;Estrées, Charles de Rohan, prince de Soubise, and Contades, being present at all the battles from Hastenbeck onwards. His victory over Prince Ferdinand at Bergen (1759) won him the rank of marshal of France from the King Louis XV and the title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire &quot;Reichsfürst&quot; from Emperor Francis I.

In 1759, he won the Battle of Bergen and followed that with the capture the city of Minden, later fighting at the Battle of Minden under the command of Contades, whom he would succeed in command. In 1760, he won an action at the Korbach, but was defeated at Villinghausen in 1761. After the war, he fell into disgrace and was not recalled to active employment until 1778, when he was given command of the troops designed to operate against Great Britain, when France intervened on the Thirteen Colonies&#x27; side during the American war of independence. He played a prominent part in the French Revolution, which he opposed with determination; he commanded troops at Versailles in July 1789 and briefly served as Louis XVI&#x27;s minister of war before fleeing France. After his emigration, the duc de Broglie commanded the Army of the Princes for a short time (1792).

Since the duke&#x27;s eldest son, Charles-Louis-Victor, prince de Broglie, died in the Terror, the succession fell to his grandson, who became the third duc de Broglie. He died at Münster in 1804.

<doc id="169115" wikidata="Q7242130" url="?curid=169115" title="Preternatural">
<text>The preternatural (or praeternatural) is that which appears outside, beside or beyond (Latin: &quot;præter&quot;) the natural. It is &quot;suspended between the mundane and the miraculous&quot;.

In theology, the term is often used to distinguish marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to witchcraft or demons, from purely divine power of genuinely supernatural origin that the . Preternatural is also used to describe gifts such as immortality, possessed by Adam and Eve before the fall of man into original sin, and the power of flight that angels are thought to have. In the early modern period, the term was used by scientists to refer to abnormalities and strange phenomena of various kinds that seemed to depart from the norms of nature.

==Theology==
Medieval theologians made a clear distinction between the natural, the preternatural and the supernatural. Thomas Aquinas argued that the supernatural consists in &quot;God’s unmediated actions&quot;; the natural is &quot;what happens always or most of the time&quot;; and the preternatural is &quot;what happens rarely, but nonetheless by the agency of created beings...Marvels belong, properly speaking, to the realm of the preternatural.&quot; Theologians, following Aquinas, argued that only God had the power to disregard the laws of nature that He has created, but that demons could manipulate the laws of nature by a form of trickery, to deceive the unwary into believing they had experienced real miracles. According to historian Lorraine Daston,

By the 16th century, the term &quot;preternatural&quot; was increasingly used to refer to demonic activity comparable to the use of magic by human adepts: The Devil, &quot;being a natural Magician ... may perform many acts in ways above our knowledge, though not transcending our natural power.&quot; According to the philosophy of the time, preternatural phenomena were not contrary to divine law, but used hidden, or occult powers that violated the &quot;normal&quot; pattern of natural phenomena.

Orestes Brownson, in his nineteenth-century autobiographical novel &quot;The Spirit-Rapper&quot;, has the Christian apologist Mr. Merton say &quot;Man has a double nature, is composed of body and soul ... A supernatural power assists him to rise; a preternatural power assists him, so to speak, to descend&quot;.

==Science==
With the emergence of early modern science, the concept of the preternatural increasingly came to be used to refer to strange or abnormal phenomena that seemed to violate the normal working of nature, but which were not associated with magic and witchcraft. This was a development of the idea that preternatural phenomena were fake miracles. As Daston puts it, &quot;To simplify the historical sequence somewhat: first, preternatural phenomena were demonized and thereby incidentally naturalized; then the demons were deleted, leaving only the natural causes.&quot; The use of the term was especially common in medicine, for example in John Brown&#x27;s &quot;A Compleat Treatise of Preternatural Tumours&quot; (1678), or William Smellie&#x27;s &quot;A Collection of Preternatural Cases and Observations in Midwifery&quot; (1754).

In the 19th century the term was appropriated in anthropology to refer to folk beliefs about fairies, trolls and other such creatures which were not thought of as demonic, but which were perceived to affect the natural world in unpredictable ways. According to Thorstein Veblen, such preternatural agents were often thought of as forces somewhere between supernatural beings and material processes. &quot;The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived to be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which partakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat arbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially of any contest.&quot;

The linguistic association between individual agents and unexplained or unfortunate circumstances remains. Many people attribute occurrences that are known to be material processes, such as &quot;gremlins in the engine&quot;, a &quot;bug in the machine&quot;, or attributing motives to objects: &quot;the clouds are threatening&quot;. The anthropomorphism in our daily life is a combination of the above cultural stems, as well as the manifestation of our pattern-projecting minds.

==Scholarship==
In 2011, Penn State Press began publishing a learned journal titled &quot;Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural&quot;. Edited by Kirsten Uszkalo and Richard Raiswell, the journal is dedicated to publishing articles, reviews and short editions of original texts that deal with conceptions and perceptions of the preternatural in any culture and in any historical period. The journal covers &quot;magics, witchcraft, spiritualism, occultism, prophecy, monstrophy, demonology, and folklore.&quot;

<text>François Marie de Broglie, 1st Duke of Broglie (11 January 167122 May 1745) was a French Royal Army officer and diplomat.

==Biography==
===Early years===
François-Marie de Broglie was the third son of Victor-Maurice, comte de Broglie, named for his grandfather, François Marie. He entered the army at an early age, and had a varied career of active service before he was made, at the age of twenty-three, lieutenant-colonel of the king&#x27;s regiment of cavalry.

===Career===
He served continuously in the War of the Spanish Succession and was present at Malplaquet. He was made lieutenant-general in 1710, and served with Villars in the last campaign of the war and at the Battle of Denain. During the peace he continued in military employment, and in 1719 he was made director-general of cavalry and dragoons. He was also employed in diplomatic missions and was ambassador in England in 1724.

The war in Italy called him into the field again in 1733, and in the following year he was made marshal of France. In the campaign of 1734 he was one of the chief commanders on the French side, and he fought the Battles of Parma and Guastalla. A famous episode was his narrow personal escape when his quarters on the Secchia (battle of Quistello) were raided by the enemy on the night of 14 September 1734.

In 1735 he directed a war of positions with credit, but he was soon replaced by Marshal de Noailles. He was governor-general of Alsace when Frederick the Great paid a secret visit to Strasbourg in 1740.

In 1742, during the War of the Austrian Succession, Broglie was appointed to command the French army in Germany, but the only success obtained was in the action of Sahay (25 May 1742), for which he was created duc de Broglie and made a peer of France. He returned to France in 1743, and died two years later.

<doc id="169118" wikidata="Q190265" url="?curid=169118" title="Pepsin">
<text>Pepsin is an endopeptidase that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids. It is one of the main digestive enzymes in the digestive systems of humans and many other animals, where it helps digest the proteins in food. Pepsin is an aspartic protease, using a catalytic aspartate in its active site.

It is one of three principal endopeptidases (enzymes cutting proteins in the middle) in the human digestive system, the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin. There are also exopeptidases which remove individual amino acids at both ends of proteins (carboxypeptidases produced by the pancreas and aminopeptidases secreted by the small intestine). During the process of digestion, these enzymes, each of which is specialized in severing links between particular types of amino acids, collaborate to break down dietary proteins into their components, i.e., peptides and amino acids, which can be readily absorbed by the small intestine. The cleavage specificity of pepsin is broad, but some amino acids like tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan increase the probability of cleavage.

Pepsin&#x27;s zymogen (proenzyme), pepsinogen, is released by the gastric chief cells in the stomach wall, and upon mixing with the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, pepsinogen activates to become pepsin.

== History ==

Pepsin was one of the first enzymes to be discovered, by Theodor Schwann in 1836. Schwann coined its name from the Greek word &quot;pepsis&quot;, meaning &quot;digestion&quot; (from &quot;peptein&quot; &quot;to digest&quot;). An acidic substance that was able to convert nitrogen-based foods into water-soluble material was determined to be pepsin.

In 1928, it became one of the first enzymes to be crystallized when John H. Northrop crystallized it using dialysis, filtration, and cooling.

== Precursor ==
Pepsin is expressed as a zymogen called pepsinogen, whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids compared to the active enzyme.

In the stomach, gastric chief cells release pepsinogen. This zymogen is activated by hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is released from parietal cells in the stomach lining. The hormone gastrin and the vagus nerve trigger the release of both pepsinogen and HCl from the stomach lining when food is ingested. Hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment, which allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion, thereby generating pepsin (the active form). Pepsin cleaves the 44 amino acids from pepsinogen to create more pepsin.

Pepsinogens are mainly grouped in 5 different groups based on their primary structure: pepsinogen A (also called pepsinogen I), pepsinogen B, progastricsin (also called pepsinogen II and pepsinogen C), prochymosin (also called prorennin) and pepsinogen F (also called pregnancy-associated glycoprotein).

== Activity and stability ==

Pepsin is most active in acidic environments between pH 1.5 to 2.5. Accordingly, its primary site of synthesis and activity is in the stomach (pH 1.5 to 2). In humans the concentration of pepsin in the stomach reaches 0.5 – 1 mg/mL.

Pepsin is inactive at pH 6.5 and above, however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until pH 8.0. Therefore, pepsin in solutions of up to pH 8.0 can be reactivated upon re-acidification. The stability of pepsin at high pH has significant implications on disease attributed to laryngopharyngeal reflux. Pepsin remains in the larynx following a gastric reflux event. At the mean pH of the laryngopharynx (pH = 6.8) pepsin would be inactive but could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events resulting in damage to local tissues.

Pepsin exhibits a broad cleavage specificity. Pepsin will digest up to 20% of ingested amide bonds. Residues in the P1 and P1&#x27; positions are most important in determining cleavage probability. Generally, hydrophobic amino acids at P1 and P1&#x27; positions increase cleavage probability. Phenylalanine, leucine and methionine at the P1 position, and phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine at the P1&#x27; position result in the highest cleavage probability. Cleavage is disfavoured by positively charged amino acids histidine, lysine and arginine at the P1 position.

== In laryngopharyngeal reflux ==
Pepsin is one of the primary causes of mucosal damage during laryngopharyngeal reflux. Pepsin remains in the larynx (pH 6.8) following a gastric reflux event. While enzymatically inactive in this environment, pepsin would remain stable and could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events. Exposure of laryngeal mucosa to enzymatically active pepsin, but not irreversibly inactivated pepsin or acid, results in reduced expression of protective proteins and thereby increases laryngeal susceptibility to damage.

Pepsin may also cause mucosal damage during weakly acidic or non-acid gastric reflux. Weak or non-acid reflux is correlated with reflux symptoms and mucosal injury. Under non-acid conditions (neutral pH), pepsin is internalized by cells of the upper airways such as the larynx and hypopharynx by a process known as receptor-mediated endocytosis. The receptor by which pepsin is endocytosed is currently unknown. Upon cellular uptake, pepsin is stored in intracellular vesicles of low pH at which its enzymatic activity would be restored. Pepsin is retained within the cell for up to 24 hours. Such exposure to pepsin at neutral pH and endocyctosis of pepsin causes changes in gene expression associated with inflammation, which underlies signs and symptoms of reflux, and tumor progression. This and other research implicates pepsin in carcinogenesis attributed to gastric reflux.

Pepsin in airway specimens is considered to be a sensitive and specific marker for laryngopharyngeal reflux. Research to develop new pepsin-targeted therapeutic and diagnostic tools for gastric reflux is ongoing. A rapid non-invasive pepsin diagnostic called Peptest is now available which determines the presence of pepsin in saliva samples.

== Inhibitors ==

Pepsin may be inhibited by high pH (see Activity and stability) or by inhibitor compounds. Pepstatin is a low molecular weight compound and potently inhibitor specific for acid proteases with an inhibitory dissociation constant (Ki) of about 10−10 M for pepsin. The statyl residue of pepstatin is thought to be responsible for pepstatin inhibition of pepsin; statine is a potential analog of the transition state for catalysis by pepsin and other acid proteases. Pepstatin does not covalently bind pepsin and inhibition of pepsin by pepstatin is therefore reversible. 1-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane reversibly inactivates pepsin at pH 5, a reaction which is accelerated by the presence of Cu(II).

Porcine pepsin is inhibited by pepsin inhibitor-3 (PI-3) produced by the large roundworm of pig (&quot;Ascaris suum&quot;). PI-3 occupies the active site of pepsin using its N-terminal residues and thereby blocks substrate binding. Amino acid residues 1 - 3 (Gln-Phe-Leu) of mature PI-3 bind to P1&#x27; - P3&#x27; positions of pepsin. The N-terminus of PI-3 in the PI-3:pepsin complex is positioned by hydrogen bonds which form an eight-stranded β-sheet, where three strands are contributed by pepsin and five by PI-3.

A product of protein digestion by pepsin inhibits the reaction.

Sucralfate, a drug used to treat stomach ulcers and other pepsin-related conditions, also inhibits pepsin activity.

== Applications ==

Commercial pepsin is extracted from the glandular layer of hog stomachs. It is a component of rennet used to curdle milk during the manufacture of cheese. Pepsin is used for a variety of applications in food manufacturing: to modify and provide whipping qualities to soy protein and gelatin, to modify vegetable proteins for use in nondairy snack items, to make precooked cereals into instant hot cereals, and to prepare animal and vegetable protein hydrolysates for use in flavoring foods and beverages. It is used in the leather industry to remove hair and residual tissue from hides and in the recovery of silver from discarded photographic films by digesting the gelatin layer that holds the silver. Pepsin was historically an additive of Beeman&#x27;s gum brand chewing gum by Dr. Edwin E. Beeman.

Pepsin is commonly used in the preparation of F(ab&#x27;)2 fragments from antibodies. In some assays, it is preferable to use only the antigen-binding (Fab) portion of the antibody. For these applications, antibodies may be enzymatically digested to produce either an Fab or an F(ab&#x27;)2 fragment of the antibody. To produce an F(ab&#x27;)2 fragment, IgG is digested with pepsin, which cleaves the heavy chains near the hinge region. One or more of the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains in the hinge region are preserved, so the two Fab regions of the antibody remain joined together, yielding a divalent molecule (containing two antibody binding sites), hence the designation F(ab&#x27;)2. The light chains remain intact and attached to the heavy chain. The Fc fragment is digested into small peptides. Fab fragments are generated by cleavage of IgG with papain instead of pepsin. Papain cleaves IgG above the hinge region containing the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains, but below the site of the disulfide bond between the light chain and heavy chain. This generates two separate monovalent (containing a single antibody binding site) Fab fragments and an intact Fc fragment. The fragments can be purified by gel filtration, ion exchange, or affinity chromatography.

Fab and F(ab&#x27;)2 antibody fragments are used in assay systems where the presence of the Fc region may cause problems. In tissues such as lymph nodes or spleen, or in peripheral blood preparations, cells with Fc receptors (macrophages, monocytes, B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells) are present which can bind the Fc region of intact antibodies, causing background staining in areas that do not contain the target antigen. Use of F(ab&#x27;)2 or Fab fragments ensures that the antibodies are binding to the antigen and not Fc receptors. These fragments may also be desirable for staining cell preparations in the presence of plasma, because they are not able to bind complement, which could lyse the cells. F(ab&#x27;)2, and to a greater extent Fab, fragments allow more exact localization of the target antigen, i.e., in staining tissue for electron microscopy. The divalency of the F(ab&#x27;)2 fragment enables it to cross-link antigens, allowing use for precipitation assays, cellular aggregation via surface antigens, or rosetting assays.

<text>Ureases (), functionally, belong to the superfamily of amidohydrolases and phosphotriesterases. Ureases are found in numerous Bacteria, Archaea, fungi, algae, plants, and some invertebrates. Ureases are nickel-containing metalloenzymes of high molecular weight. Ureases are distinct from Urecases are important in degrading avian faecal matter, which is rich in uric acid, the breakdown product of which is urea, which is then degraded by urease as described here. 

These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia:
: (NH2)2CO + H2O CO2 + 2NH3

The hydrolysis of urea occurs in two stages. In the first stage, ammonia and carbamic acid are produced. The carbamate spontaneously and rapidly hydrolyzes to ammonia and carbonic acid. Urease activity increases the pH of its environment as ammonia is produced, which is basic.

== History ==
Urease activity was first identified in 1876 by Frédéric Alphonse Musculus as a soluble ferment. 
In 1926, James B. Sumner, showed that urease is a protein by examining its crystallized form. Sumner&#x27;s work was the first demonstration that a protein can function as an enzyme and led eventually to the recognition that most enzymes are in fact proteins. Urease was the first enzyme crystallized. For this work, Sumner was awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1946. The crystal structure of urease was first solved by P. A. Karplus in 1995.

== Importance ==
Urease is important because of its role in the Nitrogen cycle as a key catalyst in the reaction converting urea to ammonium and CO2. Urease occurs as a soil enzyme, likely because soil microorganisms benefit from the nitrogen made available by urea degradation in the form of ammonium. 

==Structure==

A 1984 study focusing on urease from jack bean found that the active site contains a pair of nickel centers. In vitro activation also has been achieved with manganese and cobalt in place of nickel. Lead salts are inhibiting.

The molecular weight is either 480 kDa or 545 kDa for jack-bean urease (calculated mass from the amino acid sequence). 840 amino acids per molecule, of which 90 are cysteine residues.

The optimum pH is 7.4 and optimum temperature is 60 °C. Substrates include urea and hydroxyurea.

Bacterial ureases are composed of three distinct subunits, one large catalytic (α 60–76kDa) and two small (β 8–21 kDa, γ 6–14 kDa) commonly forming (αβγ)3 trimers stoichiometry with a 2-fold symmetric structure (note that the image above gives the structure of the asymmetric unit, one-third of the true biological assembly), they are cysteine-rich enzymes, resulting in the enzyme molar masses between 190 and 300kDa.

An exceptional urease is obtained from &quot;Helicobacter&quot; sp.. These are composed of two subunits, α(26–31 kDa)-β(61–66 kDa). These subunits form a supramolecular (αβ)12 dodecameric complex. of repeating α-β subunits, each coupled pair of subunits has an active site, for a total of 12 active sites. It plays an essential function for survival, neutralizing gastric acid by allowing urea to enter into periplasm via a proton-gated urea channel. The presence of urease is used in the diagnosis of &quot;Helicobacter&quot; species.

All bacterial ureases are solely cytoplasmic, except for those in &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, which along with its cytoplasmic activity, has external activity with host cells. In contrast, all plant ureases are cytoplasmic.

Fungal and plant ureases are made up of identical subunits (~90 kDa each), most commonly assembled as trimers and hexamers. For example, jack bean urease has two structural and one catalytic subunit. The α subunit contains the active site, it is composed of 840 amino acids per molecule (90 cysteines), its molecular mass without Ni(II) ions amounting to 90.77 kDa. The mass of the hexamer with the 12 nickel ions is 545.34 kDa. Other examples of homohexameric structures of plant ureases are those of soybean, pigeon pea and cotton seeds enzymes.

It is important to note, that although composed of different types of subunits, ureases from different sources extending from bacteria to plants and fungi exhibit high homology of amino acid sequences. The single plant urease chain is equivalent to a fused γ-β-α organization. The &quot;Helicobacter&quot; &quot;α&quot; is equivalent to a fusion of the normal bacterial γ-β subunits, while its &quot;β&quot; subunit is equivalent to the normal bacterial α. The three-chain organization is likely ancestral.

==Activity==

The &quot;k&quot;cat/&quot;K&quot;m of urease in the processing of urea is 1014 times greater than the rate of the uncatalyzed elimination reaction of urea. There are many reasons for this observation in nature. The proximity of urea to active groups in the active site along with the correct orientation of urea allow hydrolysis to occur rapidly. Urea alone is very stable due to the resonance forms it can adopt. The stability of urea is understood to be due to its resonance energy, which has been estimated at 30–40 kcal/mol. This is because the zwitterionic resonance forms all donate electrons to the carbonyl carbon making it less of an electrophile making it less reactive to nucleophilic attack.

===Active site===

The active site of ureases is located in the α (alpha) subunits. It is a bis-μ-hydroxo dimeric nickel center, with an interatomic distance of ~3.5 Å. &gt; The Ni(II) pair are weakly antiferromagnetically coupled. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies of &quot;Canavalia ensiformis&quot; (jack bean), &quot;Klebsiella aerogenes&quot; and &quot;Sporosarcina pasteurii&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Bacillus pasteurii&quot;) confirm 5–6 coordinate nickel ions with exclusively O/N ligation, including two imidazole ligands per nickel. Urea substrate is proposed to displace aquo ligands.

Water molecules located towards the opening of the active site form a tetrahedral cluster that fills the cavity site through hydrogen bonds. Some amino acid residues are proposed to form mobile flap of the site, which gate for the substrate. Cysteine residues are common in the flap region of the enzymes, which have been determined not to be essential in catalysis, although involved in positioning other key residues in the active site appropriately. In &quot;Sporosarcina pasteurii&quot; urease, the flap was found in the open conformation, while its closed conformation is apparently needed for the reaction.

When compared, the α subunits of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; urease and other bacterial ureases align with the jack bean ureases.

The binding of urea to the active site of urease has not been observed.

===Proposed mechanisms===

====Blakeley/Zerner====

One mechanism for the catalysis of this reaction by urease was proposed by Blakely and Zerner. It begins with a nucleophilic attack by the carbonyl oxygen of the urea molecule onto the 5-coordinate Ni (Ni-1). A weakly coordinated water ligand is displaced in its place. A lone pair of electrons from one of the nitrogen atoms on the Urea molecule creates a double bond with the central carbon, and the resulting NH2− of the coordinated substrate interacts with a nearby positively charged group. Blakeley and Zerner proposed this nearby group to be a Carboxylate ion, although deprotonated carboxylates are negatively charged.

A hydroxide ligand on the six coordinate Ni is deprotonated by a base. The carbonyl carbon is subsequently attacked by the electronegative oxygen. A pair of electrons from the nitrogen-carbon double bond returns to the nitrogen and neutralizes the charge on it, while the now 4-coordinate carbon assumes an intermediate tetrahedral orientation.

The breakdown of this intermediate is then helped by a sulfhydryl group of a cysteine located near the active site. A hydrogen bonds to one of the nitrogen atoms, breaking its bond with carbon, and releasing an molecule. Simultaneously, the bond between the oxygen and the 6-coordinate nickel is broken. This leaves a carbamate ion coordinated to the 5-coordinate Ni, which is then displaced by a water molecule, regenerating the enzyme.

The carbamate produced then spontaneously degrades to produce another ammonia and carbonic acid.

====Hausinger/Karplus====

The mechanism proposed by Hausinger and Karplus attempts to revise some of the issues apparent in the Blakely and Zerner pathway, and focuses on the positions of the side chains making up the urea-binding pocket. From the crystal structures from &quot;K. aerogenes&quot; urease, it was argued that the general base used in the Blakely mechanism, His320, was too far away from the Ni2-bound water to deprotonate in order to form the attacking hydroxide moiety. In addition, the general acidic ligand required to protonate the urea nitrogen was not identified. Hausinger and Karplus suggests a reverse protonation scheme, where a protonated form of the His320 ligand plays the role of the general acid and the Ni2-bound water is already in the deprotonated state. The mechanism follows the same path, with the general base omitted (as there is no more need for it) and His320 donating its proton to form the ammonia molecule, which is then released from the enzyme. While the majority of the His320 ligands and bound water will not be in their active forms (protonated and deprotonated, respectively,) it was calculated that approximately 0.3% of total urease enzyme would be active at any one time. While logically, this would imply that the enzyme is not very efficient, contrary to established knowledge, usage of the reverse protonation scheme provides an advantage in increased reactivity for the active form, balancing out the disadvantage. Placing the His320 ligand as an essential component in the mechanism also takes into account the mobile flap region of the enzyme. As this histidine ligand is part of the mobile flap, binding of the urea substrate for catalysis closes this flap over the active site and with the addition of the hydrogen bonding pattern to urea from other ligands in the pocket, speaks to the selectivity of the urease enzyme for urea.

====Ciurli/Mangani====

The mechanism proposed by Ciurli and Mangani is one of the more recent and currently accepted views of the mechanism of urease and is based primarily on the different roles of the two nickel ions in the active site. One of which binds and activates urea, the other nickel ion binds and activates the nucleophilic water molecule. With regards to this proposal, urea enters the active site cavity when the mobile ‘flap’ (which allows for the entrance of urea into the active site) is open. Stability of the binding of urea to the active site is achieved via a hydrogen-bonding network, orienting the substrate into the catalytic cavity. Urea binds to the five-coordinated nickel (Ni1) with the carbonyl oxygen atom. It approaches the six-coordinated nickel (Ni2) with one of its amino groups and subsequently bridges the two nickel centers. The binding of the urea carbonyl oxygen atom to Ni1 is stabilized through the protonation state of Hisα222 Nԑ. Additionally, the conformational change from the open to closed state of the mobile flap generates a rearrangement of Alaα222 carbonyl group in such a way that its oxygen atom points to Ni2. The Alaα170 and Alaα366 are now oriented in a way that their carbonyl groups act as hydrogen-bond acceptors towards NH2 group of urea, thus aiding its binding to Ni2. Urea is a very poor chelating ligand due to low Lewis base character of its NH2 groups. However the carbonyl oxygens of Alaα170 and Alaα366 enhance the basicity of the NH2 groups and allow for binding to Ni2. Therefore, in this proposed mechanism, the positioning of urea in the active site is induced by the structural features of the active site residues which are positioned to act as hydrogen-bond donors in the vicinity of Ni1 and as acceptors in the vicinity of Ni2. The main structural difference between the Ciurli/Mangani mechanism and the other two is that it incorporates a nitrogen, oxygen bridging urea that is attacked by a bridging hydroxide.

===Action in pathogenesis===

Bacterial ureases are often the mode of pathogenesis for many medical conditions. They are associated with hepatic encephalopathy / Hepatic coma, infection stones, and peptic ulceration.

====Infection stones====

Infection induced urinary stones are a mixture of struvite (MgNH4PO4•6H2O) and carbonate apatite [Ca10(PO4)6•CO3]. These polyvalent ions are soluble but become insoluble when ammonia is produced from microbial urease during urea hydrolysis, as this increases the surrounding environments pH from roughly 6.5 to 9. The resultant alkalinization results in stone crystallization. In humans the microbial urease, &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot;, is the most common in infection induced urinary stones.

====Urease in hepatic encephalopathy / hepatic coma====

Studies have shown that &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; along with cirrhosis of the liver cause hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic coma. &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; release microbial ureases into the stomach. The urease hydrolyzes urea to produce ammonia and carbonic acid. As the bacteria are localized to the stomach ammonia produced is readily taken up by the circulatory system from the gastric lumen. This results in elevated ammonia levels in the blood, a condition known as hyperammonemia; eradication of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; show marked decreases in ammonia levels.

====Urease in peptic ulcers====

&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; is also the cause of peptic ulcers with its manifestation in 55–68% reported cases. This was confirmed by decreased ulcer bleeding and ulcer reoccurrence after eradication of the pathogen. In the stomach there is an increase in pH of the mucosal lining as a result of urea hydrolysis, which prevents movement of hydrogen ions between gastric glands and gastric lumen. In addition, the high ammonia concentrations have an effect on intercellular tight junctions increasing permeability and also disrupting the gastric mucous membrane of the stomach.

==Occurrence and applications in agriculture==
Urea is found naturally in the environment and is also artificially introduced, comprising more than half of all synthetic nitrogen fertilizers used globally. Heavy use of urea is thought to promote eutrophication, despite the observation that urea is rapidly transformed by microbial ureases, and thus usually does not persist. Environmental urease activity is often measured as an indicator of the health of microbial communities. In the absence of plants, urease activity in soil is generally attributed to heterotrophic microorganisms, although it has been demonstrated that some chemoautotrophic ammonium oxidizing bacteria are capable of growth on urea as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy.

=== Inhibition in fertilizers ===

The inhibition of urease is a significant goal in agriculture because the rapid breakdown of urea-based fertilizers is wasteful and environmentally damaging. Phenyl phosphorodiamidate and &quot;N&quot;-(&quot;n&quot;-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide are two such inhibitors.

===Biomineralization===
By promoting the formation of calcium carbonate, ureases are potentially useful for biomineralization-inspired processes. Notably, microbiologically induced formation of calcium carbonate can be used in making bioconcrete.

== Non-enzymatic action ==
In addition to acting as an enzyme, some ureases (especially plant ones) have additional effects that persist even when the catalytic function is disabled. These include entomotoxicity, inhibition of fungi, neurotoxicity in mammals, promotion of endocytosis and inflammatory eicosanoid production in mammals, and induction of chemotaxis in bacteria. These activities may be part of a defense mechanism.

Urease insect-toxicity was originally noted in canatoxin, an orthologous isoform of jack bean urease. Digestion of the peptide identified a 10-kDa portion most responsible for this effect, termed jaburetox. An analogous portion from the soybean urease is named soyuretox. Studies on insects show that the entire protein is toxic without needing any digestion, however. Nevertheless, the &quot;uretox&quot; peptides, being more concentrated in toxicity, show promise as biopesticides.

== As diagnostic test ==

Many gastrointestinal or urinary tract pathogens produce urease, enabling the detection of urease to be used as a diagnostic to detect presence of pathogens.

Urease-positive pathogens include:
*&quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot; and &quot;Proteus vulgaris&quot;
*&quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot;, a relative of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; spp.
*&quot;Nocardia&quot;
*&quot;Corynebacterium urealyticum&quot;
*&quot;Cryptococcus&quot; spp., an opportunistic fungus
*&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;
*Certain Enteric bacteria including &quot;Proteus&quot; spp., &quot;Klebsiella&quot; spp., &quot;Morganella&quot;, &quot;Providencia&quot;, and possibly &quot;Serratia&quot; spp.
*&quot;Brucella&quot;
* &quot;Staphylococcus saprophyticus&quot;
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;

== Ligands ==

=== Inhibitors ===
A wide range of urease inhibitors of different structural families are known. Inhibition of urease is not only of interest to agriculture, but also to medicine as pathogens like &quot;H. pylori&quot; produce urease as a survival mechanism. Known structural classes of inhibitors include:

* Analogues of urea, the strongest being thioureas like 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-palmitoylthiourea.
* Phosphoramidates, the most commonly used in agriculture (see above).
* Hydroquinone and quinones. In medicine, the most interesting are quinolones, already a class of widely used antibiotics.
* Some plant metabolites are also urease inhibitors, an example being allicin. These have potential both as environmentally-friendly fertilizer additives and natural drugs.

==Extraction==

First isolated as a crystal in 1926 by Sumner, using acetone solvation and centrifuging. Modern biochemistry has increased its demand for urease. Jack bean meal, watermelon seeds, and pea seeds have all proven useful sources of urease.

<text>Gauche is an R7RS Scheme implementation. It is designed for scripting in a production environment. It is intended to allow programmers and system administrators to write scripts in support of daily operations. Quick startup, built-in system interface, native multilingual support are some of its key design goals.

Gauche is free software under the BSD License. It is primarily developed by Shiro Kawai.

==Features==
*Quick startup - Gauche includes common features in its executable, while less common functions are in libraries which are loaded on demand.
*Module system - A simple module system, API compatible to STklos.
*Object system - CLOS-like object system with metaobject protocol. Almost API compatible to STklos. It is also similar to Guile&#x27;s object system.
*Native multilingual support - Strings are represented by multibyte string internally. You can use UTF-8, EUC-JP, Shift-JIS or no multibyte encoding. Conversion between native coding system and external coding system is supported by port objects.
*Multibyte regexp - Regular expression matcher is aware of multibyte string; you can use multibyte characters both in patterns and matched strings.
*Built-in system interface - Gauche has built-in support for most POSIX.1 system calls.
*Network interface - Has API for socket-based network interface, including IPv6 if the OS supports it.
*Multithreading - Multithreading is supported on top of pthreads. Scheme-level API conforms to SRFI-18.
*DBM interface - Interfaces to dbm, ndbm and/or gdbm.
*XML parsing - Oleg Kiselyov&#x27;s SXML tools are included.

<text>Primary elections or primaries are elections held to determine which candidates will run in an upcoming general election. In a partisan primary, a political party selects a candidate. Depending on the state and/or party, there may be an &quot;open primary&quot;, in which all voters are eligible to participate, or a &quot;closed primary&quot;, in which only members of a political party can vote. Less common are nonpartisan primaries in which all candidates run regardless of party.

The origins of primary elections can be traced to the progressive movement in the United States, which aimed to take the power of candidate nomination from party leaders to the people. However, political parties control the method of nomination of candidates for office in the name of the party. Other methods of selecting candidates include caucuses, internal selection by a party body such as a convention or party congress, direct nomination by the party leader, and nomination meetings.

A similar procedure for selecting individual candidates under party-list proportional representation can be found in open list systems; in such systems, the party primary is combined with the general election. Parties in countries using the parliamentary system may also hold leadership elections. A party&#x27;s leader will typically become the head of government should that party win a majority of seats in the legislature, meaning leadership elections often select a party&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; candidate for prime minister, much like a presidential primary.

Countries that use first-past-the-post for both the primary and general elections are often described as using a partisan two-round system to highlight the similarity to two-round (runoff) systems, particularly in two-party systems. These similarities have led to the first round of a two-round system sometimes being called a &quot;nonpartisan primary&quot; in the United States.

==Types of Party primaries==
Two types of party primaries can generally be distinguished:

* &quot;Closed primary&quot;. (synonyms: internal primaries, party primaries) In the case of closed primaries, internal primaries, or party primaries, only party members can vote.
* &quot;Open primary&quot;. All voters can take part in an open primary and may cast votes on a ballot of any party. The party may require them to express their support to the party&#x27;s values and pay a small contribution to the costs of the primary.

In the United States, further types can be differentiated:

=== Closed primary ===

* People may vote in a party&#x27;s primary only if they are registered members of that party prior to election day. Independents cannot participate. Because some political parties name themselves independent, the terms &quot;non-partisan&quot; or &quot;unaffiliated&quot; often replace &quot;independent&quot; when referring to those who are not affiliated with a political party. As of 2016, thirteen states and the District of Columbia used closed primaries.

=== Semi-closed or semi-open ===
* As in closed primaries, registered party members can vote only in their own party&#x27;s primary. Semi-closed systems, however, allow unaffiliated voters to choose a party to participate in as well. Depending on the state, independents either make their choice of party primary privately, inside the voting booth, or publicly, by registering with any party on Election Day. 
* Sixteen statesAlaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, and West Virginiahave semi-closed primaries that allow voters to register or change party preference on election day. Massachusetts allows unenrolled voters or members of minor parties to vote in the primary of either major party, but registration or party changes must be done no fewer than 20 days prior to the primary.

=== Open primary ===
* A registered voter may vote in any &quot;party primary&quot; regardless of his or her own party affiliation. Fourteen statesAlabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsinhave open primaries. 
* This system is sometimes criticized for increasing the ease with which voters can engage in party raiding. Raiding consists of voters of one party crossing over and voting in the primary of another party, effectively allowing a party to choose a weak opponent in the election. An example of this can be seen in the 1998 Vermont senatorial primary with the nomination of Fred Tuttle as the Republican candidate in the general election.

==Nonpartisan==
&quot;Nonpartisan blanket primary&quot;

All candidates appear on the same ballot and advance to the general election or second round regardless of party affiliation.
* In a top two primary, the top two candidates advance to the general election or runoff.
** Louisiana has famously operated under this system, which has been nicknamed the &quot;jungle primary&quot;, since the 1980s.
** California has used a top two primary since 2012 after passing Proposition 14 in 2010.
** Washington has used a top two primary since 2008.
Unified primary
* Unlike the kinds of primaries mentioned above, St. Louis uses a nonpartisan primary with approval voting, where voters may support any number of candidates instead of one.

==In the United States==
The United States is one of a handful of countries to select candidates through popular vote in a primary election system; most other countries rely on party leaders or party members to select candidates, as was previously the case in the U.S.

The selection of candidates for federal, state, and local general elections takes place in primary elections organized by the public administration for the general voting public to participate in for the purpose of nominating the respective parties&#x27; official candidates; state voters start the electoral process for governors and legislators through the primary process, as well as for many local officials from city councilors to county commissioners. The candidate who moves from the primary to be successful in the general election takes public office.

In modern politics, primary elections have been described as a vehicle for transferring decision-making from political insiders to voters, though political science research indicates that the formal party organizations retain significant influence over nomination outcomes.

=== History ===
The direct primary became important in the United States at the state level starting in the 1890s and at the local level in the 1900s. The first primary elections came in the Democratic Party in the South in the 1890s starting in Louisiana in 1892. By 1897 the Democratic party held primaries to select candidates in 11 Southern and border states. Unlike the final election run by government officials, primaries were run by party officials rather than being considered official elections, allowing them to exclude African American voters. The US Supreme Court would later declare such white primaries unconstitutional in &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; in 1944.

The direct primary was promoted primarily by regular party leaders as a way to promote party loyalty. Progressive reformers like Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin also campaigned for primaries, leading Wisconsin to approve them in a 1904 referendum.

Despite this, presidential nominations depended chiefly on party conventions until 1972. In 1968, Hubert Humphrey won the Democratic nomination without entering any of the 14 state primaries, causing substantial controversy at the national convention. To prevent a recurrence, Democrats set up the McGovern–Fraser Commission which required all states to hold primaries, and the Republican party soon followed suit.

===Non-partisan===
Primaries can be used in nonpartisan elections to reduce the set of candidates that go on to the general election (&quot;qualifying primary&quot;). (In the U.S., many city, county and school board elections are non-partisan, although often the political affiliations of candidates are commonly known.) In some states and localities, candidates receiving more than 50% of the vote in the primary are automatically elected, without having to run again in the general election. In other states, the primary can narrow the number of candidates advancing to the general election to the top two, while in other states and localities, twice as many candidates as can win in the general election may advance from the primary.

===Blanket===
When a qualifying primary is applied to a partisan election, it becomes what is generally known as a blanket or &quot;Louisiana primary&quot;: typically, if no candidate wins a majority in the primary, the two candidates receiving the highest pluralities, regardless of party affiliation, go on to a general election that is in effect a run-off. This often has the effect of eliminating minor parties from the general election, and frequently the general election becomes a single-party election. Unlike a plurality voting system, a run-off system meets the Condorcet loser criterion in that the candidate that ultimately wins would not have been beaten in a two-way race with every one of the other candidates.

Because many Washington residents were disappointed over the loss of their blanket primary, which the Washington State Grange helped institute in 1935, the Grange filed Initiative 872 in 2004 to establish a blanket primary for partisan races, thereby allowing voters to once again cross party lines in the primary election. The two candidates with the most votes then advance to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation. Supporters claimed it would bring back voter choice; opponents said it would exclude third parties and independents from general election ballots, could result in Democratic or Republican-only races in certain districts, and would in fact reduce voter choice. The initiative was put to a public vote in November 2004 and passed. On 15 July 2005, the initiative was found unconstitutional by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the Grange&#x27;s appeal of the case in October 2007. In March 2009, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Grange-sponsored Top 2 primary, citing a lack of compelling evidence to overturn the voter-approved initiative.

In elections using electoral systems where strategic nomination is a concern, primaries can be very important in preventing &quot;clone&quot; candidates that split their constituency&#x27;s vote because of their similarities. Primaries allow political parties to select and unite behind one candidate. However, tactical voting is sometimes a concern in non-partisan primaries as members of the opposite party can vote for the weaker candidate in order to face an easier general election.

In California, under Proposition 14 (Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act), a voter-approved referendum, in all races &quot;except&quot; for that for U.S. president and county central committee offices, all candidates running in a primary election regardless of party will appear on a single primary election ballot and voters may vote for any candidate, with the top two vote-getters overall moving on to the general election regardless of party. The effect of this is that it will be possible for two Republicans or two Democrats to compete against each other in a general election if those candidates receive the most primary-election support.

===Partisan===
As a result of a federal court decision in Idaho, the 2011 Idaho Legislature passed House Bill 351 implementing a closed primary system.

In May 2024, the Republican Party of Texas approved at its bi-annual convention an amendment to its party rules that changes its primary from an open primary to a closed primary, in which only voters registered with the Republican party may now vote in the Republican primary election. State law in Texas currently mandates open primaries, where voters select which primary to vote in when they go to vote rather than affiliating with a party prior to the primary. 

Oregon was the first American state in which a binding primary election was conducted entirely via the internet. The election was held by the Independent Party of Oregon in July, 2010.

===Presidential primaries===
In the United States, Iowa and New Hampshire have drawn attention every four years because they hold the first caucus and primary election, respectively, and often give a candidate the momentum to win their party&#x27;s nomination. Since 2000, the primary in South Carolina has also become increasingly important, as it is the first Southern state to hold a primary election in the calendar year.

A criticism of the current presidential primary election schedule is that it gives undue weight to the few states with early primaries, as those states often build momentum for leading candidates and rule out trailing candidates long before the rest of the country has even had a chance to weigh in, leaving the last states with virtually no actual input on the process. The counterargument to this criticism, however, is that, by subjecting candidates to the scrutiny of a few early states, the parties can weed out candidates who are unfit for office.

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) proposed a new schedule and a new rule set for the 2008 presidential primary elections. Among the changes: the primary election cycle would start nearly a year earlier than in previous cycles, states from the West and the South would be included in the earlier part of the schedule, and candidates who run in primary elections not held in accordance with the DNC&#x27;s proposed schedule (as the DNC does not have any direct control over each state&#x27;s official election schedules) would be penalized by being stripped of delegates won in offending states. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called the move, &quot;the biggest shift in the way Democrats have nominated their presidential candidates in 30 years.&quot;

Of note regarding the DNC&#x27;s proposed 2008 presidential primary election schedule is that it contrasted with the Republican National Committee&#x27;s (RNC) rules regarding presidential primary elections. &quot;No presidential primary, caucus, convention, or other meeting may be held for the purpose of voting for a presidential candidate and/or selecting delegates or alternate delegates to the national convention, prior to the first Tuesday of February in the year in which the national convention is held.&quot; In 2028, this date is February .

Candidates for U.S. President who seek their party&#x27;s nomination participate in primary elections run by state governments, or caucuses run by the political parties. Unlike an election where the only participation is casting a ballot, a caucus is a gathering or &quot;meeting of party members designed to select candidates and propose policies&quot;. Both primaries and caucuses are used in the presidential nomination process, beginning in January or February and culminating in the late summer political party conventions. Candidates may earn convention delegates from each state primary or caucus. Sitting presidents generally do not face serious competition from their party.

===Primary classifications===
While it is clear that the closed/semi-closed/semi-open/open classification commonly used by scholars studying primary systems does not fully explain the highly nuanced differences seen from state to state, still, it is very useful and has real-world implications for the electorate, election officials, and the candidates themselves.

As far as the electorate is concerned, the extent of participation allowed to weak partisans and independents depends almost solely on which of the aforementioned categories best describes their state&#x27;s primary system. Open and semi-open systems favor this type of voter, since they can choose which primary they vote in on a yearly basis under these models. In closed primary systems, true independents are, for all practical purposes, shut out of the process.

This classification further affects the relationship between primary elections and election commissioners and officials. The more open the system, the greater the chance of raiding, or voters voting in the other party&#x27;s primary in hopes of getting a weaker opponent chosen to run against a strong candidate in the general election. Raiding has proven stressful to the relationships between political parties, who feel cheated by the system, and election officials, who try to make the system run as smoothly as possible.

Perhaps the most dramatic effect this classification system has on the primary process is its influence on the candidates themselves. Whether a system is open or closed dictates the way candidates run their campaigns. In a closed system, from the time a candidate qualifies to the day of the primary, they tend to have to cater to partisans, who tend to lean to the more extreme ends of the ideological spectrum. In the general election, under the assumptions of the median voter theorem, the candidate must move more towards the center in hopes of capturing a plurality.

== In Europe ==

In Europe, primaries are not organized by the public administration but by parties themselves, and legislation is mostly silent on primaries. However, parties may need government cooperation, particularly for open primaries.

Whereas closed primaries are rather common within many European countries, a few political parties in Europe have opted for open primaries. Parties generally organize primaries to nominate the party leader (leadership election). The underlying reason for that is that most European countries are parliamentary democracies. National governments are derived from the majority in the Parliament, which means that the head of the government is generally the leader of the winning party. France is one exception to this rule.

Closed primaries happen in many European countries, while open primaries have so far only occurred in the socialist and social-democratic parties in Greece and Italy, whereas France&#x27;s Socialist Party organised the first open primary in France in October 2011.

One of the more recent developments is organizing primaries on the European level. European parties that organized primaries so far were the European Green Party (EGP) and the Party of European Socialists (PES)

===European Union===
With a view to the European elections, many European political parties consider organizing a presidential primary.

Indeed, the Lisbon treaty, which entered into force in December 2009, lays down that the outcome of elections to the European Parliament must be taken into account in selecting the President of the Commission; the Commission is in some respects the executive branch of the EU and so its president can be regarded as the EU prime minister. Parties are therefore encouraged to designate their candidates for President of the European Commission ahead of the next election in 2014, in order to allow voters to vote with a full knowledge of the facts. Various have suggested using primaries to elect these candidates.
* In April 2004, a former British conservative MEP, Tom Spencer, advocated for American-style primaries in the European People&#x27;s Party: &quot;A series of primary elections would be held at two-week intervals in February and March 2009. The primaries would start in the five smallest countries and continue every two weeks until the big five voted in late March. To avoid swamping by the parties from the big countries, one could divide the number of votes cast for each candidate in each country by that country&#x27;s voting weight in the Council of Ministers. Candidates for the post of president would have to declare by 1 January 2009.&quot;
* In July 2013 European Green Party (EGP) announced that it would run a first ever European-wide open primary as the preparation for the European elections in 2014. It was to be open to all citizens of the EU over the age of 16 who &quot;supported green values&quot; They elected two transnational candidates who were to be the face of the common campaign of the European green parties united in the EGP, and who also were their candidates for European Commission president.
* Following the defeat of the Party of European Socialists during the European elections of June 2009, the PES Congress that took place in Prague in December 2009 made the decision that PES would designate its own candidate before the 2014 European elections. A Campaign for a PES primary was then launched by PES supporters in June 2010, and it managed to convince the PES Council meeting in Warsaw in December 2010 to set up Working Group &quot;Candidate 2014&quot; in charge of proposing a procedure and timetable for a &quot;democratic&quot; and &quot;transparent&quot; designation process &quot;bringing on board all our parties and all levels within the parties&quot;.

The European think-tank Notre Europe also suggested European parties should designate candidates for High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs.

Finally, the European Parliament envisaged to introduce a requirement for internal democracy in the regulation on the statute of European political parties. European parties would therefore have to involve individual members in the major decisions such as designating the presidential candidate.

=== Armenia ===
On 24 and 25 November 2007, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation political party conducted a non-binding Armenia-wide primary election. The party asked the people of their recommendation of who they should nominate as their candidate for the upcoming presidential election.

===France===
The means by which the candidate of an established political party is selected has evolved. Until 2012, none of the six Presidents elected through direct election faced a competitive internal election.

* The right didn&#x27;t hold often primary elections to decide for their national candidates.
** In 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the UMP, organized an approval &quot;primary&quot; without any opponent. He won by 98% and made his candidacy speech thereafter.
** In 2016, The Republicans held, on 20 and 27 November, primaries to decide of their presidential candidate for 2017.
* On the left, however, the Socialist Party of François Mitterrand has been plagued by internal divisions since the latter departed from politics. Rather than forming a new party, which is the habit on the right-wing, the party started to elect its nominee internally.
** A first try in 1995: Lionel Jospin won the nomination three months before the election. He lost in the run-off to Jacques Chirac.
** The idea made progress as the 2007 race approached, once the referendum on a European constitution was over. The latter showed strong ideological divisions within the left-wing spectrum, and the Socialist Party itself. This prevented the possibility of a primary spanning the whole left-wing, that would give its support to a presidential candidate. Given that no majority supported either a leader or a split, a registration campaign, enabling membership for only 20 euros, and a closed primary was organized, which Ségolène Royal won. She qualified to the national run-off that she lost to Nicolas Sarkozy.
** In 2011, the Socialist Party decided to organise the first ever open primary in France to pick the Socialist party and the Radical Party of the Left nominee for the 2012 presidential election. Inspired by the 2008 U.S. primaries, it was seen as a way to reinvigorate the party. The idea was first proposed by Terra Nova, an independent left-leaning think tank, in a 2008 report. It was also criticized for going against the nature of the regime. The open primary was not state-organized : the party took charge of all the electoral procedures, planning to set up 10,000 voting polls. All citizens on the electoral rolls, members of the Socialist party and the Radical Party of the Left, and members of the parties&#x27; youth organisation (MJS and JRG), including minors of 15 to 18 years old, were entitled to vote in exchange for one euro to cover the costs. More than 3 million people participated in this first open primary, which was considered a success, and former party leader François Hollande was designated the Socialist and Radical candidate for the 2012 presidential election.
* Other parties organize membership primaries to choose their nominee, such as Europe Ecologie – Les Verts (EE-LV) (2006, 2011, 2016), and the French Communist Party in 2011.
* At the local level, membership primaries are the rule for Socialist Party&#x27;s candidates, but these are usually not competitive. In order to tame potential feud in his party, and prepare the ground for a long campaign, Sarkozy pushed for a closed primary in 2006 to designate the UMP candidate for the 2008 election of the Mayor of Paris. Françoise de Panafieu was elected in a four-way race. However, she did not clinch the mayorship two years later.

===Germany===
In Germany, top candidates for the federal election can be selected in primaries. For party leaders, however, the selection at delegate conferences is required by law. It is, nevertheless, possible to hold a non-binding primary. 

====Top candidates====
The Greens nominated their top candidates for the 2013 federal election (election of Jürgen Trittin and Katrin Göring-Eckardt) and for the 2017 federal election (election of Cem Özdemir and Katrin Göring-Eckardt) in a primary election by all party members (closed primary).

Primary elections are used much more frequently by parties at the regional than at the federal level.

====Party leaders====
The first party to use a (non-binding) closed primary to select its party leader at the federal level was the SPD in 1993. After the surprising resignation of Andrea Nahles, the SPD held another party primary to determine her successor in 2019. A dual leadership of Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans was elected. The CDU used the procedure for the first time in 2021. Friedrich Merz prevailed against two competitors Norbert Röttgen and Helge Braun in an online ballot of all CDU party members.

=== Netherlands ===
Open primary elections are not common in the Netherlands, candidates and list leaders are either selected internally by political parties through party leadership or member meetings and Congresses. In democratically organized parties, elections are used to choose leaders and candidates, but participation is limited to registered party members.

==== Examples of Party leader elections ====

* 2006 People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) Leadership Election: This election was notable as it marked a leadership transition within one of the largest liberal parties in the Netherlands, and set up the Mark Rutte for his 14-year tenure as Prime Minister of the Netherlands
* 2016 Labour Party (PvdA) Leadership Election: Held during a period of internal party challenges, this election sought to redefine the direction of the party amidst declining public support.
* 2020 Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) Leadership Election.

=== Hungary ===

A two-round primary election was held in Budapest, Hungary in 2019 between four opposition parties, to select a single candidate to the 2019 Budapest mayoral election. A smaller primary was also held in the district of Ferencváros.

For the 2022 parliamentary elections, the opposition parties organized a primary to select both their candidates for MPs and prime minister.

===Italy===
Primary election were introduced in Italy to establish the centre-left candidates for 2005 regional election. In that occasion the centre-left The Union coalition held open primaries in order to select candidates for President of Apulia and Calabria. A more politically significant primary was held on 16 October 2005, when The Union asked its voters to decide the candidate for Prime Minister in the 2006 general election: 4,300,000 voters showed up and Romano Prodi won hands down. Two years later, on 14 October 2007, voters of the Democratic Party were called to choose the party leader among a list of six, their representatives to the Constituent Assembly and the local leaders. The primary was a success, involving more than 3,500,000 people across Italy, and gave to the winner Walter Veltroni momentum in a difficult period for the government and the centre-left coalition. The centre-right (see House of Freedoms, The People of Freedom, centre-right coalition and Forza Italia) has never held a primary at the national level, but held some experiments at the very local level.

===Russia===

The first primaries in the history of Russia were held in May 2000 in St. Petersburg, the local branches of the parties Yabloko and the Union of Right Forces, who before the Gubernatorial election offered citizens to choose a single candidate from the democratic opposition.

In 2007, before the parliamentary elections, United Russia held primaries in several regions. However, its results were not sufficiently taken into account when nominating candidates from the party. For example, the congress of United Russia included in the regional party list in the Samara region not the winners of the primaries, but those who did not even participate in the primaries.

In the same year 2007, A Just Russia held the primaries to determine the candidate for the Gubernatorial election in Altai Krai. Anyone could vote for them, for which special items were opened. However, in the future, A Just Russia did not begin to pursue the primaries.

In 2011, United Russia, together with the All-Russian People&#x27;s Front, held primaries for the nomination of candidates for the Duma election. This vote was called the &quot;All-People&#x27;s Primaries&quot;, but in fact it was not. Candidates for the primaries were selected by special committees. Not even all party members had the right to vote, but only about 200,000 specially selected electors. In addition, the results of voting on the primaries were in most cases ignored. Of the 80 lists of regional groups of candidates for the State Duma, nominated by the congress of Unitpared Russia, only 8 lists coincided with the lists of winners of the primaries. All the same, the event played a role in the elimination of candidates: there were cases when the current deputies of the State Duma, having seen that they did not enjoy the support of electors, withdrew their candidacies.

In the future, United Russia has sometimes resorted to an &quot;open&quot; model of primaries, which allows voting to all interested voters. In 2014, in the primaries of the &quot;United Russia&quot; before the elections to the Moscow City Duma, any Muscovite could vote, and not only registered electors.

In 2016, the primaries for the selection of candidates for parliamentary elections were held by four parties: United Russia, People&#x27;s Freedom Party, the Party of Growth and the Green Alliance. The most massive were 22 May 2016 primaries of the United Russia, which could vote for every citizen who has an active electoral right. However, the primaries, as well as earlier, were not binding for the leadership of United Russia: a number of winners of the primaries were withdrawn by the leadership without any explanation of reasons, and in 18 single-seat constituencies the party did not nominate any candidates. A striking example was the Nizhny Tagil constituency, where the candidate from the United Russia was approved candidate, who took the 4th place in the primaries. Finally, a number of candidates were included in the party list on the proposal of the party leader Dmitry Medvedev from among those who did not even participate in the primaries.

In 2017, the Party of Growth holds the primaries for the nomination of candidates for the presidential election. These are the first presidential primaries in the history of Russia. However, voting for candidates will take place via the Internet within three months, and, according to the spokesman of the party, the results of the primaries will not be mandatory for the nomination of the candidate and the party convention may nominate another candidate who does not even participate in the primaries, or even not nominate candidates and support President Vladimir Putin, if he decides to be re-elected.

=== Poland ===
* 2019 Civic Platform presidential primary
* 2020 Confederation Liberty and Independence presidential primaries

=== Portugal ===

* 2014 Portuguese Socialist Party prime ministerial primary

===United Kingdom===

For the 2010 general election, the Conservative Party used open primaries to select two candidates for Member of Parliament. Further open primaries were used to select some Conservative candidates for the 2015 general election, and there are hopes other parties may nominate future candidates in this way.

==In Canada==

As in Europe, nomination meetings and leadership elections (somewhat similar to primary elections) in Canada are not organized by the public administration but by parties themselves. Political parties participate in federal elections to the House of Commons, in legislative elections in all ten provinces, and in Yukon. (The legislatures and elections in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are non-partisan.)

===Local candidates===
Typically, in the months before an anticipated general election, local riding associations of political parties in each electoral district will schedule and announce a Nomination Meeting (similar to a nominating caucus in the United States). Would-be candidates will then file nomination papers with the association, and usually will devote time to solicit existing party members, and to sign up new party members who will also support them at the nomination meeting. At the meeting, typically each candidate will speak, and then members in attendance will vote. The electoral system most often used is an exhaustive ballot system; if no candidate has over 50% of the votes, the candidate with the lowest number of votes will be dropped and another ballot will be held. Also, other candidates who recognize that they will probably not win may withdraw between ballots, and may &quot;throw their support&quot; to (encourage their own supporters to vote for) another candidate. After the nomination meeting, the candidate and the association will obtain approval from party headquarters, and file the candidate&#x27;s official nomination papers and necessary fees and deposits with Elections Canada or the provincial/territorial election commissions as appropriate.

At times, party headquarters may overturn an association&#x27;s chosen candidate; for example, if any scandalous information about the candidate comes to light after the nomination. A party headquarters may also &quot;parachute&quot; a prominent candidate into an easy-to-win riding, removing the need to have a nomination meeting. These situations tend to cause disillusionment among a party&#x27;s supporters.

===Party leaders===
Canadian political parties also organize their own elections of party leaders. Not only will the party leader run for a seat in their own chosen riding, they will also become Prime Minister (in a federal election) or Premier (in a province or territory) should their party secure the confidence of parliament (usually by winning the most seats). Thus, a leadership election is also considered to be one for the party&#x27;s de facto candidate for Prime Minister or Premier. If the party does not secure the confidence of parliament, but wins the next most amount of seats, the party leader will become Leader of the Official Opposition; if the party comes third or lower but maintains official party status, the leader will still be recognized as the leader of their party, and will be responsible for co-ordinating the activities and affairs of their party&#x27;s caucus in the legislature.

In the past, Canadian political parties chose party leaders through an American-style delegated leadership convention. Local riding associations would choose delegates, usually in a manner similar to how they would choose a candidate for election. These delegates typically said explicitly which leadership candidate they would support. Those delegates, as well as other delegates (&quot;e.g.&quot; sitting party members of Parliament or the legislature, or delegates from party-affiliated organizations such as labor unions in the case of the New Democratic Party), would then vote, again using the exhaustive ballot method, until a leader was chosen. Some provincial political parties retain the delegated convention format.

Lately, Canada&#x27;s major political parties have moved towards direct elections for federal leadership. A leadership convention is still scheduled, but all party members have a chance to vote for the new leader. Typically, members may vote either in person at the convention, online, or through a mail-in ballot.

Instant-runoff is used in whole or in part to elect the leaders of the three largest federal political parties in Canada: the Liberal Party of Canada, the Conservative Party of Canada, and the New Democratic Party, albeit the New Democratic Party uses a mixture of IRV and exhaustive voting, allowing each member to choose one format or the other for their vote (as was used in their 2017 leadership election). In 2013, members of the Liberal Party of Canada elected Justin Trudeau as party leader through IRV in a national leadership election. The Conservative Party used IRV (where each of the party&#x27;s 338 riding associations are weighted equally, regardless of how many members voted in each riding) to elect Erin O&#x27;Toole as party leader in 2020, Andrew Scheer in 2017, and Stephen Harper in 2004.

===Americas===

* Argentina
** In Argentina, the presidential primary election is structured as a blanket primary system. Within this framework, voters have the freedom to select a single candidate for each available position, irrespective of party affiliations. This approach holds historical significance, as it was previously employed in the United States as well.
* Chile
** 2017 Chilean presidential primaries
* Colombia: 
** In the 2006 presidential elections, the Liberal Party, and the socialist Alternative Democratic Pole held primary elections, electing Horacio Serpa as the Liberal candidate, and Carlos Gaviria as candidate of the Alternative Democratic Pole.
** In the 2010 presidential elections, four parties held primary elections: The Liberal Party elected former minister Rafael Pardo as candidate, the Democratic Pole elected senator Gustavo Petro, the Conservative Party chose ambassador Noemi Sanin, and the Green Party chose former mayor of Bogota Antanas Mockus.
*Costa Rica: the country&#x27;s three main political parties, the National Liberation Party, the Social Christian Unity Party, and the Citizens&#x27; Action Party, have all run primary elections on several different occasions.
* Uruguay 
** In Uruguay, a blanket primary election is held every five years to elect the national and department conventions of each party, which select their presidential and intendant candidates. All parties must participate, however voting is voluntary unlike the other instances in the electoral process.

* Hong Kong
** 2020 Hong Kong pro-democracy primaries

<text>Jacques Alexandre César Charles (12 November 1746 – 7 April 1823) was a French inventor, scientist, mathematician, and balloonist.
Charles wrote almost nothing about mathematics, and most of what has been credited to him was due to mistaking him with another Jacques Charles (sometimes called Charles the Geometer), also a member of the Paris Academy of Sciences, entering on 12 May 1785.

Charles and the Robert brothers launched the world&#x27;s first hydrogen-filled gas balloon August 27, 1783; then December 1, 1783, Charles and his co-pilot Nicolas-Louis Robert ascended to a height of about 1,800 feet (550 m) in a piloted gas balloon. Their pioneering use of hydrogen for lift led to this type of gas balloon being named a &quot;Charlière&quot; (as opposed to the hot-air Montgolfière).

Charles&#x27;s law, describing how gases tend to expand when heated, was formulated by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1802, but he credited it to unpublished work by Charles.

Charles was elected to the Académie des Sciences in 1795 and subsequently became professor of physics at the Académie de Sciences.

==Biography==
Charles was born in Beaugency-sur-Loire in 1746. He married Julie Françoise Bouchaud des Hérettes (1784–1817), a creole woman 37 years younger than himself. Reportedly the poet Alphonse de Lamartine also fell in love with her, and she was the inspiration for &quot;Elvire&quot; in his 1820 autobiographical &quot;Poetic Meditation&quot; &quot;Le Lac&quot; (&quot;The Lake&quot;), which describes in retrospect the fervent love shared by a couple from the point of view of the bereaved man. Charles outlived her and died in Paris on 7 April 1823.

==Hydrogen balloon flights==

===First hydrogen balloon===

Charles conceived the idea that hydrogen would be a suitable lifting agent for balloons having studied the work of Robert Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Boyle&#x27;s Law&quot; which was published 100 years earlier in 1662, and of his contemporaries Henry Cavendish, Joseph Black and Tiberius Cavallo. He designed the craft and then worked in conjunction with the Robert brothers, Anne-Jean and Nicolas-Louis, to build it in their workshop at the &quot;Place des Victoires&quot; in Paris. The brothers invented the methodology for the lightweight, airtight gas bag by dissolving rubber in a solution of turpentine and varnished the sheets of silk that were stitched together to make the main envelope. They used alternate strips of red and white silk, but the discolouration of the varnishing/rubberising process left a red and yellow result.

Charles and the Robert brothers launched the world&#x27;s first hydrogen filled balloon on 27 August 1783, from the Champ de Mars, (now the site of the Eiffel Tower) where Ben Franklin was among the crowd of onlookers. The balloon was comparatively small, a 35 cubic metre sphere of rubberised silk, and only capable of lifting about 9 kg (20 lb). It was filled with hydrogen that had been made by pouring nearly a quarter of a tonne of sulphuric acid onto a half a tonne of scrap iron. The hydrogen gas was fed into the balloon via lead pipes; but as it was not passed through cold water, great difficulty was experienced in filling the balloon completely (the gas was hot when produced, but as it cooled in the balloon, it contracted). Daily progress bulletins were issued on the inflation; and the crowd was so great that on the 26th the balloon was moved secretly by night to the Champ de Mars, a distance of four kilometres.

The balloon flew northwards for 45 minutes, pursued by chasers on horseback, and landed 21 kilometers away in the village of Gonesse where the reportedly terrified local peasants destroyed it with pitchforks or knives. The project was funded by a subscription organised by Barthelemy Faujas de Saint-Fond.

===First crewed hydrogen balloon flight===

At 13:45 (1:45 PM) on 1 December 1783, Charles and the Robert brothers launched a new crewed balloon from the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris. Charles was accompanied by Nicolas-Louis Robert as co-pilot of the 380-cubic-metre, hydrogen-filled balloon. The envelope was fitted with a hydrogen release valve and was covered with a net from which the basket was suspended. Sand ballast was used to control altitude. They ascended to a height of about 1,800 feet (550 m) and landed at sunset in Nesles-la-Vallée after a 2-hour, 5-minute flight covering 36 km. The chasers on horseback, who were led by the Duc de Chartres, held down the craft while both Charles and Nicolas-Louis alighted.

Charles then decided to ascend again, but alone this time because the balloon had lost some of its hydrogen. This time it ascended rapidly to an altitude of about 3,000 metres, where he saw the sun again. He began suffering from aching pain in his ears so he &quot;valved&quot; to release gas, and descended to land gently about 3 km away at . Unlike the Robert brothers, Charles never flew again, although a hydrogen balloon came to be called a &quot;Charlière&quot; in his honour.

It is reported that 400,000 spectators witnessed the launch, and that hundreds had paid one crown each to help finance the construction and receive access to a &quot;special enclosure&quot; for a &quot;close-up view&quot; of the take-off. Among the &quot;special enclosure&quot; crowd was Benjamin Franklin, the diplomatic representative of the United States of America. Also present was Joseph Montgolfier, whom Charles honoured by asking him to release the small, bright green, pilot balloon to assess the wind and weather conditions.

This event took place ten days after the world&#x27;s first crewed balloon flight by Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier using a Montgolfier brothers hot air balloon. Simon Schama wrote in &quot;&quot;:

===Further ballooning activities===
The next project of Charles and the Robert brothers was to build an elongated, steerable craft that followed Jean Baptiste Meusnier&#x27;s proposals (1783–85) for a dirigible balloon. The design incorporated Meusnier&#x27;s internal &quot;ballonnet&quot; (air cells), a rudder and a method of propulsion.

Charles chose never to fly in this craft, but on 15 July 1784, the brothers flew for 45 minutes from Saint-Cloud to Meudon with M. Collin-Hullin and Louis Philippe II, the Duke of Chartres in &quot;La Caroline&quot;. It was fitted with oars for propulsion and direction, but they proved useless. The absence of a &#x27;gas release valve&#x27; meant that the duke had to slash the &#x27;ballonnet&#x27; to prevent rupture when they reached an altitude of circa .

On 19 September 1784, the Robert brothers and M. Collin-Hullin flew for 6 hours 40 minutes, covering 186 km from Paris to Beuvry near Béthune. This was the first flight over 100 km.

==Inventions==
Charles developed several useful inventions, including a valve to let hydrogen out of the balloon and other devices, such as the hydrometer and reflecting goniometer, and improved the Gravesand heliostat and Fahrenheit&#x27;s aerometer. In addition he confirmed Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s electrical experiments.

==Charles&#x27;s law==
Charles&#x27;s law (also known as the law of volumes), describing how gases tend to expand when heated, was first published by natural philosopher Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1802, but he credited it to unpublished work by Charles, and named the law in his honour.

Around 1787 Charles did an experiment where he filled five balloons to the same volume with different gases. He then raised the temperature of the balloons to 80 °C (not at constant temperature) and noticed that they all increased in volume by the same amount. This experiment was referenced by Gay-Lussac in 1802 when he published a paper on the precise relationship between the volume and temperature of a gas. Charles&#x27;s law states that under constant pressure, an ideal gas&#x27; volume is proportional to its absolute temperature. The volume of a gas at constant pressure increases linearly with the absolute temperature of the gas. The formula he created was &quot;V&quot;1/&quot;T&quot;1 = &quot;V&quot;2/&quot;T&quot;2.

==Career==
Charles was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1786 and to the Académie des Sciences, in 1795. He subsequently became a professor of physics at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers.

==Commemoration==
A stele at Nesles-la-Vallée marks the Charles-Robert flight of the 1st of December, 1783. 

The &quot;Coupe Charles et Robert&quot; was an international ballooning event that was run in 1983 in parallel with the Gordon Bennett Cup.

<text>The University of Western Ontario (UWO; branded as Western University) is a public research university in London, Ontario, Canada. The main campus is located on of land, surrounded by residential neighbourhoods and the Thames River bisecting the campus&#x27;s eastern portion. The university operates twelve academic faculties and schools.

The university was founded on 7 March 1878 by Bishop Isaac Hellmuth of the Anglican Diocese of Huron as The Western University of London, Ontario. It incorporated Huron College, which had been founded in 1863. The first four faculties were Arts, Divinity, Law and Medicine. The university became non-denominational in 1908. Beginning in 1919, the university had affiliated with several denominational colleges. The university grew substantially in the post-World War II era, and a number of faculties and schools were added.

Western is a co-educational university, with more than 24,000 students, and over 306,000 living alumni worldwide. The university is a founding member of the U15, Canada&#x27;s group of most distinguished research-intensive universities. Western&#x27;s varsity teams, known as the Western Mustangs, compete in the Ontario University Athletics conference of U Sports.

==History==
The university was founded on 7 March 1878 by Bishop Isaac Hellmuth of the Anglican Diocese of Huron as The Western University of London, Ontario, and its first chancellor was Chief Justice Richard Martin Meredith. It incorporated Huron College, which had been founded in 1863. The first four faculties were Arts, Divinity, Law and Medicine (London Medical College). There were originally only 15 students when classes began in 1881.

Although the university was incorporated in 1878, it was not until 20 June 1881 that it received the right to confer degrees in arts, divinity and medicine. In 1882, the name of the university was revised to The Western University and College of London, Ontario. The first convocation of graduates was held on 27 April 1883. Initially affiliated with the Church of England, the university became non-denominational in 1908.

In 1916, the university&#x27;s current site was purchased from the Kingsmill family. There are two World War I memorial plaques in University College. The first lists the 19 students and graduates of the University of Western Ontario who died; the second honours the men from Middlesex County who died. A third plaque lists those who served with the No. 10 Canadian General hospital during WWII, the unit raised and equipped by UWO.

In 1923, the university was renamed as The University of Western Ontario. The first two buildings constructed by architect John Moore and Co. at the new site were the Arts Building (now University College) and the Natural Science Building (now the Physics and Astronomy Building). Classes on the university&#x27;s present site began in 1924. The University College tower, one of the university&#x27;s most distinctive features, was named the Middlesex Memorial Tower in honour of the men from Middlesex County who fought in World War I.

In the early 20th century, a number of institutions became affiliated colleges of Western. In 1919, Brescia College was established as a Roman Catholic affiliate of Western, while Assumption College entered an affiliation agreement with the university. Other institutions that became affiliated colleges of Western includes the Waterloo College of Arts in 1925, St. Peter&#x27;s College in 1939, and King&#x27;s College in 1945. Waterloo College of Arts remained affiliated with Western until 1960, when the institution was reorganized into Wilfrid Laurier University; while Assumption College remained affiliated with Western until 1964, when it was reorganized into the University of Windsor. Brescia College ceased operations and was integrated into Western&#x27;s main campus in 2024, while Huron and King&#x27;s remain independent affiliates.

Two World War II memorial honour rolls are hung on the Physics and Astronomy Building: the first lists the UWO students and graduates who served in the Second World War, and the second lists those who served with the No. 10 Canadian General hospital during WWII, the unit raised and equipped by UWO.

Although enrolment was relatively small for many years, the university began to grow after World War II. It added a number of faculties in the post-war period, such as the Faculty of Graduate Studies in 1947, the School of Business Administration (now the Ivey Business School) in 1949, the Faculty of Engineering Science (now the Faculty of Engineering) in 1957, the Faculty of Law in 1959, Althouse College (now the Faculty of Education) in 1965, and the Faculty of Music in 1968.

In 2012, the university rebranded itself as &quot;Western University&quot; to give the school less of a regional or even national identity. &quot;We want to be international,&quot; president Dr. Amit Chakma told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. The university&#x27;s legal name, however, remains &quot;The University of Western Ontario&quot; and, as such, remains in use on transcripts and diplomas.

==Campus==
The University of Western Ontario is in the city of London, Ontario, in the southwestern end of the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor. Most of the campus is surrounded by residential neighbourhoods, with the Thames River bisecting the campus&#x27; eastern portion. Western Road is the university&#x27;s major transportation artery, travelling north to south. The central campus, which includes most of the university&#x27;s student residences and teaching facilities is approximately .

Student residences make up the largest part of Western&#x27;s building area, with approximately 31 percent of all building space allocated for residential use. Teaching and research facilities take up the second largest portion of building space, with approximately 28 percent of all building space allocated for that use. Most of these facilities are used for research, with 48 percent of all teaching and research facilities allocated for that purpose. Approximately 27 percent of all teaching and research facilities is made up of classrooms, with the remaining 24 percent made up of instructional laboratories.

The development of Western&#x27;s present campus began in the 1920s. Many of the university&#x27;s earliest buildings used Collegiate Gothic designs, a characteristic confirmed in Western&#x27;s master building plan in 1934. As the campus expanded in the late 1960s, the university abandoned earlier commitments to Collegiate Gothic designs in favour of brutalist and modernist architectural designs. In 2000, planning for Western&#x27;s central campus was re-conceptualized, with the core devoted for only academic buildings. The plan saw University College Hill as the focal point, linking the lower portion of the campus with the South Valley The 2006 campus master plan called for the protection and renewed emphasis on Western&#x27;s Collegiate Gothic buildings. The university&#x27;s boiler room/power plant is the oldest building on the university&#x27;s central campus, opening in 1922. The oldest academic buildings within the central campus is University College and the Physics and Astronomy Building. Groundbreaking for both buildings began in 1922, and were both completed in 1924. The Amit Chakma Engineering Building is the newest academic building on campus, opening in September 2018. The Western Interdisciplinary Research Building, or WIRB, is the newest building on campus and houses state-of-the art research facilities for the study of cognitive neuroscience as well as the Brain and Mind Institute, BrainsCAN, and the Rotman Institute for Philosophy.

===Library and museums===

The university&#x27;s library system, Western Libraries, operates six libraries that house more than 2.45 million books , as well as electronic resources including e-books, serial titles, and databases. Libraries a part of the system include the Allyn and Betty Taylor Library, C. B. Johnston Library, the D. B. Weldon Library, the Education Library, the John &amp; Dotsa Bitove Family Law Library, and the Music Library. Allyn and Betty Taylor Library primarily services the faculties of Engineering, Health Sciences, Science, and the Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry, while the C. B. Johnston Library primarily serves the Ivey Business School. The D. B. Weldon Library primarily services the faculties of Arts &amp; Humanities, Information &amp; Media Studies, and Social Sciences. The D. B. Weldon Library also houses the university&#x27;s Archives and Research Collections Centre. Western Libraries also maintains the Shared Library Catalogue, which provides common access to the collections of Western Libraries, as well as the collections from the libraries of university colleges affiliated with the Western, including Huron University College, King&#x27;s University College, and St. Peter&#x27;s Seminary. Access to the Shared University Catalogue is provided to students and faculty of Western, and the affiliated university colleges.

Western also operates two art galleries, the Artlab Gallery, and the McIntosh Gallery. Located in the John Labatt Visual Arts Centre, the Artlab Gallery showcases approximately 14 projects per year, exploring conceptual and experimental production through a wide range of media. The Artlab Gallery also aims to assist in the research and practices of students and faculty members. The McIntosh Gallery is a university-based, public art gallery, opened since 1942. The gallery is a presentation and dissemination centre for the university, as well as the London community, showcasing advanced practices and research in art history and contemporary visual art. The gallery is the oldest university art gallery in the province of Ontario, initially opened as an exhibition of paintings by war artists from the National Gallery of Canada. 683 works of the Gallery&#x27;s collection were put on display throughout the university&#x27;s main campus through the Gallery&#x27;s ArtShare program in 2014.

Western also maintains academic and administrative links with the Museum of Ontario Archaeology. The Museum originally grew out of a collection of artifacts housed in various buildings throughout London, including Western&#x27;s University College, and Middlesex College. Formally opened on 28 February 1978, its creation was facilitated by the university president and Western&#x27;s Faculty of Social Science. Although the museum was incorporated as an independent charitable organization, without the ability to share capital, its directors continued to be appointed by the university&#x27;s Board of Governors.

===Housing and student facilities===

The main campus of The University of Western Ontario offers student housing, with nine student residences housing either first-year students or upper-year students. In September 2015, 23.49 percent of the undergraduate population lived on campus, including 78.69 percent of all first-year students. Each residence operates their own Residences&#x27; Council, governed by their own constitutions. Student residence building are split between traditional-styled residences, suite-styled residences, and hybrid-style residences that incorporate elements of traditional and suite-styled residences.

Traditional-styled residences include Delaware Hall, Medway-Sydenham Hall, and Saugeen-Maitland Hall. Suite-styled residences include Alumni House, Elgin Hall, Essex Hall, and London Hall. Hybrid-styled residences include Perth Hall and Ontario Hall. Alumni House and London Hall are reserved strictly for upper-year students. The largest residential building at the university is Saugeen–Maitland Hall, which houses 1,252 first-year students. The smallest residential building is Alumni House, which houses 224 upper-year students. The university also operates three apartments on campus strictly for upper-year and graduate students. The university&#x27;s apartments consist of Bayfield Hall, made up of 299 1-bedroom units, Beaver &amp; Ausable Halls, made up of 99 2-bedroom units, and Lambton Hall, made up of 150 2-bedroom units. Starting September 2021, Lambton Hall was converted into a first-year residence; while Bayfield Hall will become a partial first-year residence in the following year.

The support system in Residences at Western is made up of over 500 upper-year students who take on various roles and positions, with the goal being to assist first-year students and act as a resource for them. These positions include Residence Staff, Academic and Leadership Programmers, Community Leaders, Residence and Faculty Sophs, Residents&#x27; Council, Residence Tour Guides, and Connect-IT Staff Members. Residence Staff live alongside first-year students across Western&#x27;s various residences, and assist in building an atmosphere to allow first-year students to grow and adjust to university life.

The University Community Centre acts as Western&#x27;s student activity centre, and is the university&#x27;s centre of student governance and student directed social, cultural, entertainment and recreational activities. The University Community Centre contains the offices of a number of student organizations, including the undergraduate student union, the University Students&#x27; Council, as well as the graduate student union, the Society of Graduate Students. In addition, the University Community Centre also provides a number of retail and food services, as well as a variety of club space and study rooms.

===Off-campus facilities===
In addition to The University of Western Ontario&#x27;s central campus, the university owns several other properties throughout Southwestern Ontario. Excluding Western&#x27;s central campus,
as well as the campuses of Western&#x27;s affiliated university colleges, Western owns approximately of land. Included among these properties is a number of research facilities. Managed under Western Research Parks, the facilities are clustered into three research parks. The three parks serve as a research link between academics and corporations. 

The oldest research park operated by Western is Discovery Park, adjacent to the university&#x27;s main campus. The research park was established in 1989, with tenants ranging from national government laboratories, to large-multi-industrial research centres. Discovery Park also includes a 48-room hotel and conference centre, Windermere Manor. The Advanced Manufacturing Park is another research park established through a partnership between Western, Fanshawe College and the City of London. Advanced Manufacturing Park is a research park, built in an area zoned for full-scale manufacturing and large-scale research. The WindEEE Dome is among the facilities built in the Advanced Manufacturing Park. The WindEEE Dome is the world&#x27;s first hexagonal wind tunnel, allowing for scientists to address certain challenges related to wind. The structure is able to accommodate replicas of buildings, and bridges to test for structural integrity in a variety of wind conditions. The facility is able to physically simulate high intensity wind systems, including tornados, and downbursts hard to replicate in other wind tunnels. In 2003, Western opened another research park known as the Sarnia-Lambton Research park, in a joint initiative with Lambton County, and Sarnia. The research park is adjacent to Lambton College and is home to Canada&#x27;s largest clean technology business incubator.

The university also manages several residences outside the central campus. The official residence of the university president, Gibbons Lodge, is off-campus. Completed in 1932, the Tudor Revival-styled house is north of Western&#x27;s central campus. It was acquired by the university in 1960. In addition to Gibbons Lodge, the university also maintains Platt&#x27;s Lane Estates, a complex of townhouses and apartments south of the university&#x27;s campus. The complex was designed to accommodate upper-year, graduate, and students with families.

===Sustainability===
Campus sustainability at Western is managed by the President&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Environment &amp; Sustainability. The committee&#x27;s mandate includes incorporating sustainability into the academic programming, engaging in research across the disciplines into issues of environmental sustainability, using ecological landscaping methods and preserving green space and building and renovating facilities in accordance with energy efficiency and sustainability principles Along with the other members of the Council of Ontario Universities, Western had signed a pledge in 2009 known as &quot;Ontario Universities Committed to a Greener World&quot;, with the objective of transforming its campus into a model of environmental responsibility. Western is also a signatory of the Talloires Declaration, a sustainability declaration created for presidents of higher education. The university campus received a B− grade from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card for 2011.

==Administration==
The university&#x27;s governance is conducted through the Board of Governors and the Senate. The Senate was the university&#x27;s first governing body, created in the university&#x27;s founding document, An Act to Incorporate the Western University of London, Ontario, 1878. The Board of Governors was later established in An Act to amend the Act to incorporate the Western University of London, Ontario, 1892. The Board is responsible for the university&#x27;s management, including financial matters. Ex officio governors of the Board include the university&#x27;s chancellor, president, the mayor of London, the warden of Middlesex County and the secretary of the Board of Governors. The Board also consists of 26 other governors either appointed or elected by the members of the university&#x27;s community and the surrounding community, including elected representatives from the student body.

The Senate is responsible for the university&#x27;s academic policies. The Senate consists of 20 &quot;ex officio&quot; positions in the Senate granted to the chancellor, the president, the university&#x27;s vice-presidents, the senior dean of each faculty, the university librarian and the secretary of the senate. The secretary of the senate is a non-voting &quot;ex officio&quot; member. The Senate also consists of 46 elected members from the university&#x27;s faculty, 18 members from the student population, and 9 members from the Western&#x27;s affiliated colleges, including their principals. The Senate also consists of 9 other members from around the university community. In all, there are 103 members of the Senate, 102 of which may vote and 10–13 official observers of the Senate.

The president and vice-chancellor acts as the university&#x27;s chief executive officer, accountable to the Board of Governors and the Senate, by supervising and directing the university&#x27;s academic and administrative work and its teaching and non-teaching staff. Alan Shepard is the tenth president of the university, who began his tenure as president on 1 July 2019. In 2022, Shepard was the highest paid President of any Ontario university, receiving $520,000 in salary and benefits. The chancellor of the university acts as the honorary and symbolic head of the university. The position of chancellor is a four-year, non-renewable term. The university&#x27;s current chancellor is Kelly Meighen, who was appointed to the position on 1 July 2023.

===Affiliated institutions===
The University of Western Ontario is currently affiliated with two university colleges. 

Huron University College was founded in 1863, originally established as Huron College, and renamed Huron University College in 2000. Huron&#x27;s affiliation with Western was authorized in Western&#x27;s first provincial charter, in 1878. Both Huron and Western share the same progenitor in Bishop Issac Hellmuth. Huron moved to its present location, adjacent to Western&#x27;s central campus, in 1951. King&#x27;s University College was founded in 1954, as a Catholic-based liberal arts college. Founded as Christ the King&#x27;s College, it changed its name to King&#x27;s College in 1966, and King&#x27;s University College in 2004. Regardless of the university college&#x27;s religious affiliation, enrolment in those institutions is not restricted based on the student&#x27;s religious beliefs.

In addition to the two university colleges, Western also maintains an affiliation with St. Peter&#x27;s Seminary through its affiliation with King&#x27;s University College. Founded in 1912, St. Peters was opened as the seminary for the Roman Catholic Diocese of London. The campuses of King&#x27;s University College and St. Peter&#x27;s Seminary are east of Richmond Street and the university&#x27;s central campus.

From 1919 until 2024, Western was also affiliated with Brescia University College, an all-women&#x27;s Catholic-based university college and the last remaining women&#x27;s college in Canada until its dissolution. Founded by the Ursulines in 1919, an affiliation agreement with Western was arranged shortly after its founding, with Brescia campus moving adjacent to Western&#x27;s central campus in 1925. Brescia College began integration with Western&#x27;s main campus in Sepetember 2023, and ceased operations in May 2024.

==Academics==
Western is a publicly funded research university, and a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. The full-time undergraduate programs comprise the majority of the school&#x27;s enrolment, made up of 30,665 full-time, part-time undergraduate students and concurrent education students. The graduate student population is 5,297, including full-time students, part-time students and post-graduate medical residents. The university conferred 4,504 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 207 doctoral degrees, 1,427 master&#x27;s degrees, and 1,180 second entry professional degrees in 2008–2009. Students may apply for financial aid such as the Ontario Student Assistance Program and Canada Student Loans and Grants through the federal and provincial governments. The financial aid may come in loans, grants, bursaries, scholarships, fellowships, debt reduction, interest relief, and work programs.
The university is divided into 11 faculties and schools including the Don Wright Faculty of Music, the Faculty of Arts &amp; Humanities, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Health Sciences, Faculty of Information &amp; Media Studies, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Social Science, Ivey School of Business, and the Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry.

In the same year, the Faculty of Health Science held the highest enrolment among graduate students at Western, with 821 full-time and part-time graduate students enrolled in the faculty. The School Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies is the university&#x27;s central administrative unit of graduate education. However, it is not considered its own faculty or academic school.

Admission requirements at Western differ depending upon the education system where the applicant originates from, due to the lack of uniformity in marking schemes. In September 2012 secondary school average for full-time first-year students at Western was 89.3 percent. For admission in the fall of 2013, there were 45,000 applications for 4,900 spaces.

The university also offers students the opportunity to earn credits while studying abroad, through student exchange programs, and internship, faculty-led international excursions, and clinical placements.

The university is ranked among the top 1% of higher education institutions worldwide.

===Research===

Western has four primary fields of research: life sciences and the human condition, culture analysis and values, the human and physical environments, and social trends, public policy, and economic activity. In Research Infosource&#x27;s 2018 ranking of Canadian research universities, Western was ranked 10th; with a sponsored research income (external funding) of $249.669 million in 2017. In 2017, members of Western&#x27;s faculty averaged a sponsored research income of $166,100, while graduate students averaged a sponsored research income $41,600. The federal government is the largest source of funding providing 46% of Western&#x27;s research budget, primarily through grants. Private corporations contribute 10 per cent of Western&#x27;s research budget.

Western&#x27;s research performance has been noted in several bibliometric university rankings, which uses citation analysis to evaluate the impact a university has on academic publications. In 2019, the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked Western 197th in the world, and ninth in Canada, whereas the University Ranking by Academic Performance 2018–19 rankings placed the university 187th in the world, and ninth in Canada.

Research regarding the human brain has also become a major focus at the university. The Brain and Mind Institute focuses on research in cognitive neuroscience at Western. In 2011, the Institute discovered the blind may perform echolocation by using the visual cortex of the brain. Another 2011 study at Western suggested people who are deaf from birth may be able to reassign the area of their brain used for hearing to boost their sight. Western also is home to the Institute for Earth and Space Exploration, the first dedicated space institute providing a planetary science degree in Canada.

In 2014, the university unveiled plans for a 4,200-square-foot facility for research in medicine, science and technology, in the study of HIV and other complex human pathogens. Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry&#x27;s Department of Microbiology and Immunology is globally recognized, in large part due to the groundbreaking discoveries of Dr. Chil-Yong Kang, a Western researcher clinically testing a preventive HIV/AIDS vaccine. SAV001-H is the first and only preventive HIV vaccine based on a genetically modified killed whole HIV-1 virus. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Phase I clinical trial was completed in August 2013 and reported no serious adverse effects while boosting antibodies in the volunteers. The vaccine SAV001-H holds tremendous promise, having already proven to stimulate strong immune responses in preliminary toxicology tests. It is the only HIV vaccine under development in Canada, and one of only a few in the world.

==Student life==

The two main student unions on administrative and policy issues is the University Students&#x27; Council for all undergraduate students and the Society of Graduate Students for graduate students. The University Students&#x27; Council recognizes more than 180 student organizations and clubs, in which more than 19,500 people are a member. These clubs and organizations cover a wide range of interests such as academics, culture, religion, social issues, and recreation. The University Students&#x27; Council also provides additional services such as the campus movie theatre (Western Film), pub/restaurant (The Spoke &amp; Rim Tavern), clothing store (The Purple Store) and print shop. These facilities can all be found in the University Community Centre. The USC is a nonprofit organization incorporated under the Ontario Nonprofit Corporations Act.

There are a number of fraternities and sororities existing throughout the student community.

The university is known for its party culture, ranking 7th in Canada by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; top party school 2019 rankings.

On March 2, 2022, the University Students&#x27; Council unanimously passed a motion declaring a Sexual and Gender-Based Violence crisis on campus. This followed nationally discussed allegations of a mass drugging and widespread sexual-assault during the 2021/2022 orientation week, which culminated with the arrest and expulsion of some students.

===Athletics===

Athletics at Western is managed by Sports &amp; Recreation Services, a division of the Faculty of Health Sciences. The university&#x27;s varsity teams compete in the Ontario University Athletics conference of U Sports. The varsity teams are known as the Western Mustangs. As is mandatory for all members of U Sports, Western does not provide full-ride athletic scholarships.

The university has a number of athletic facilities open to their varsity teams and their students. The Western Student Recreation Centre, opened in January 2009, is home to Western&#x27;s group fitness, drop in recreation, registered massage therapy, sport psychology, drop in recreation, intramural sports and clubs. Better known as the WSRC or the Rec Centre, this facility has an 8-lane, 50-metre pool facility. Overlooking the pool is a 3-tiered concrete viewing area. A 1-metre diving board is also available. There is over 19,000 square feet of weight, cardio, and stretching space within the WSRC. There are three gyms on the first floor, and two more on the upper level. Outside the lower gyms is the 1st floor games and activity lounge for table tennis, while outside of the upper gym spaces is cardio space as well as the destination for spin bike programming. Also on the 4th floor are two large studio spaces where the drop in fitness, clubs and dance courses take place.

Western Alumni Stadium (Formerly TD Stadium) has been the university&#x27;s main stadium since it opened in 2000, with a seating capacity of over 8,000 spectators. The stadium is home to the university&#x27;s varsity football team, and has hosted a number of events including the World Lacrosse Championships and the Canada Games. The Thompson Recreation &amp; Athletic Centre which houses a number of athletic venues, including an ice rink, tennis facilities and a track, is home to the varsity ice hockey teams and the varsity track and field teams. Another athletic facility at the university is Alumni Hall, which is a multipurpose venue for sports such as basketball, volleyball and other indoor events.

Many Western students take part in intramural sport leagues and tournaments. Opportunities are offered at multiple skill levels and across a variety of sports. Sports offered include traditional sports like volleyball, basketball and soccer, as well as less traditional events like dodgeball and inner tube water polo. Western also hosts secondary school football games at TD Stadium. Western has several fight songs and school songs that may be heard at varsity games, including the official school song, &quot;Western&quot;. Written in 1930, it is most notably played at football games and other athletic events by the Western Mustang Band.

===Performances===
The Don Wright Faculty of Music offers almost 400 performances, masterclasses and recitals each year, most of which are open to the public. The Western University Symphony Orchestra and the Western University Chamber Orchestra perform regularly under conductor Alain Trudel. UWOpera performs a wide variety of repertoire ranging from operetta to full operatic works in the Paul Davenport Theatre (refurbished and renamed in 2009 from Talbot Theatre). There are other student-run drama groups that puts on shows every year.

===Media===
The university&#x27;s student population operates a number of media outlets throughout the campus environment. The University Students&#x27; Council owns and operates the campus radio station CHRW-FM (94.9 FM). The first campus radio to operate at Western was in 1971, although the present day station CHRW-FM, was not established until 1979, one year after the closure of the Western&#x27;s first campus radio station.

The University Students&#x27; Council previously operated a closed-circuit television station known as tvWestern.ca. The station began broadcasting in 1994, and was discontinued by the student union in 2010 after being cut from the University Students&#x27; Council&#x27;s operating budget.

====Newspaper====
&quot;The Gazette&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;Western Gazette&quot;, is a student newspaper which has been in publication since 1906. The &quot;Gazette&quot; publishes online daily and in print on Tuesdays during the academic year. &quot;The Gazette&quot; has its roots as a hand-written literature newspaper called &quot;In Cap And Gown&quot;, which began in 1902. The &quot;In Cap And Gown&quot; was first produced in newsprint in November 1906, but changed its name to &quot;The Gazette&quot; in 1908. The &quot;Gazette&quot; ceased publishing in the spring of 1916 due to World War 1 but was revived in its old form in 1919. In 1930, 7 years after Western University changed its name to the University of Western Ontario, the paper changed its name to the &quot;University of Western Ontario Gazette&quot;. &quot;The Gazette&quot; started as monthly but in its early years appeared weekly and twice weekly. The newspaper now focuses on online-only content on a daily basis. In 2017, the &quot;Gazette&quot; began printing only once a week. The Western Gazette absorbed the assets of Western TV in 2016. Western TV was formally the Big Purple Couch and TV Western.

&quot;The Gazette&quot; has spawned several other publications in its history. One was &quot;Occidentalia&quot;, which had its roots in special convocation issues of the &quot;Gazette&quot; which included pictures of the graduating class. &quot;Oxy&quot; as it was known became the university&#x27;s year book and it provided &quot;an interesting record of the year&#x27;s activities in all Faculties and Schools.&quot; The paper is owned and published by the University Students&#x27; Council (USC). The paper has editorial autonomy from the USC. The publications committee consists of mainly professional journalists who advise the full-time staff on editorial decisions and financial management of the paper, as well as offer an intermediary between the sometimes contentious relationship between the student politicians who are reported on by the &quot;Gazette&quot;. The paper is one of the founding members of the National University Wire. The Gazette has a long history of producing some of Canada&#x27;s most well-known journalists. Gazette alumni have worked at many successful media networks including The Globe and Mail, Toronto Star, National Post, MacLean&#x27;s, CBC, CTV, Al Jazeera, Sportsnet and The New York Times. Some notable alumni include: Stephen Brunt, Susan Delacourt, Kevin Donovan, Scott Feschuk, Elliotte Friedman, Kevin Newman, Carol Off, Alan Thicke, Paul Wells and Aaron Wherry.

===Student life programs===
====Leadership education====
The Leadership Education Program is designed to teach students how to become effective leaders, both individually and in teams. The program is split into three tiers: individual leadership, group leadership, and community leadership. To successfully complete a tier an individual must complete at least five of its seven modules.

====Student exchange====
The University of Western Ontario offers a student exchange program to study abroad with several other partner institutions. Almost four hundred students come to Western each year as exchange students from abroad, with more students coming to Western as international undergraduate or exchange students. The Western International Exchange Program offers its students the opportunity to study at more than 85 different institutions in 25 countries.

===Sexual violence===
In 2014, Stanley Dobrowolski, a former staff psychiatrist for Western students, was convicted of sexual crimes against his patients. He pleaded guilty to 18 charges (16 of sexual assault, one for voyeurism, and one for disobeying court orders) and was sentenced to four years in prison. Dobrowolski had been a psychiatrist at Western until 1995. The university issued an apology for Dobrowolski&#x27;s actions on 16 March 2016.

In September 2021, several students were alleged to have been sexually assaulted during Western&#x27;s orientation week. The incidents surfaced after numerous reports of sexual assault, many facilitated by drugs, surfaced on the internet. The resulting incidents has resulted in some criticism against the university for failing to protect female students from rape culture. These events took place during a period known as the &quot;Red Zone.&quot; This is the period encompassing the first eight weeks of the university school year in which 50% of sexual-assaults take place. In the same week, a first-year Western student was killed near the university; a suspect was later charged with manslaughter in connection with the incident.

<text>Zeelandic Flanders ( ; ; ) is the southernmost region of the province of Zeeland in the south-western Netherlands. It lies south of the Western Scheldt that separates the region from the remainder of Zeeland and the Netherlands to the north. Zeelandic Flanders is bordered to the south and to the east by Belgium.

==Geography==

Zeelandic Flanders is the north-eastern part of the large historical region of Flanders which today lies mostly in Belgium. It shares a land border with the Belgian provinces of East and West Flanders. It is a latitudinally oriented strip of land along the Western Scheldt, a North Sea estuary, and has no land access to the rest of the Netherlands. The area of Zeelandic Flanders is of which is land and is water.

The region is bordered by the Zwin nature reserve in the West and the Drowned Land of Saeftinghe in the East.




Since local government boundary reforms in 2003, Zeelandic Flanders has consisted of only three municipalities: Sluis in the west, Terneuzen in the centre and Hulst in the east.

==Transport==
Zeelandic Flanders is connected to Zuid-Beveland to the north by the Western Scheldt Tunnel under the Western Scheldt (estuary). The tunnel arrives 18 km east of Flushing on the Zuid-Beveland peninsula. Before the tunnel was built, there used to be two car ferries connecting Zeelandic Flanders to other parts of Zeeland, one ferry from Perkpolder to Kruiningen on Zuid-Beveland and the second one from Breskens to Flushing on Walcheren. This last ferry service still exists, but can only be used by pedestrians and cyclists nowadays.

The Ghent–Terneuzen Canal passes through Zeelandic Flanders.

A freight railway line connects Terneuzen to Gent-Dampoort railway station.

==History==
Except for some formerly insular areas, the region now called Zeelandic Flanders was not part of the historical County of Zeeland, but a part of the County of Flanders initially ruled by the House of Habsburg. The region was on the front line in the Eighty Years&#x27; War and was conquered by the Dutch Republic in 1604. As such, it was the only part of Flanders, which took part in the insurgency, to become part of the new republic.

Zeelandic Flanders was subsequently ruled directly by the Dutch States General (parliament) as one of the Generality Lands and called Flanders of the States (&quot;Staats-Vlaanderen&quot;). After occupation by the French in 1795, the area accrued to the &quot;département&quot; of Escaut. Before the formation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, Zeelandic Flanders was territory of the Dutch province of North Brabant for a few years, but when the present province Zeeland was formed Zeelandic Flanders became a part of it, even after the 1830 Belgian Revolution that separated the remainder of Dutch Flanders from the Netherlands.

, the population of Zeelandic Flanders was 106,522 with .

==Disputes with Belgium==
As Zeelandic Flanders was historically part of Flanders, demands and plans to annex it have been made by Belgian politicians on multiple occasions.

A famous example was when Leopold II made plans to invade the Netherlands before he became king. He also planned to annex Limburg, and had spies gain information on the Dutch military. He decided to abolish his plans after contacting France, who did not support it.

Another famous occasion was shortly after World War I. Belgium once again claimed both Zeelandic Flanders and Limburg, this time as a reconciliation. Even though the Netherlands was neutral in the war, Belgium felt the neutrality was a sign of support for Germany and suspected the Netherlands of collaborating with them.

==Language==
The native dialect of the western part of the region is Zeelandic Flemish, that can be considered a variety of both West Flemish and closely related Zeelandic. In the central regions, the &quot;Land-van-Axels&quot; and &quot;Land-van-Cadzands&quot; dialects of Zeelandic, itself a transition language between West Flemish and Hollandic, are spoken. In the eastern part, East Flemish with some Brabantian influence is spoken. Because some smaller areas were isolated by water, and thus being small islands, there are some dialects that differ slightly with the &#x27;normal&#x27; dialect.

<text>Dame Julia Mary Walters (born 22 February 1950), known professionally as Julie Walters, is an English actress. She is the recipient of four British Academy Television Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, two International Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Olivier Award.

Walters has been nominated for two Academy Awards across acting categories—once for Best Actress and once for Best Supporting Actress. She was honoured with the BAFTA Fellowship for lifetime achievement in 2014. She was made a Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2017 for services to drama.

Walters rose to prominence playing the title role in &quot;Educating Rita&quot; (1983), a part she originated in the West End production of the stage play upon which the film was based. She has appeared in many other films, including &quot;Personal Services&quot; (1987), &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot; (1987), &quot;Buster&quot; (1988), &quot;Stepping Out&quot; (1991), &quot;Sister My Sister&quot; (1994), &quot;Girls&#x27; Night&quot; (1998), &quot;Titanic Town&quot; (1998), &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; (2000), seven out of eight &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films (2001–2011), &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; (2003), &quot;Becoming Jane&quot; (2007), &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; (2008) and its 2018 sequel, &quot;Brave&quot; (2012), &quot;Paddington&quot; (2014) and its sequels in 2017 and 2024, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; (2015), &quot;Film Stars Don&#x27;t Die in Liverpool&quot; (2017), and &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; (2018). On stage, she won an Olivier Award for Best Actress for the 2001 revival of &quot;All My Sons&quot;.

On television, Walters collaborated regularly with Victoria Wood; their projects included &quot;Wood and Walters&quot; (1981), &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot; (1985–1987), &quot;Pat and Margaret&quot; (1994), and &quot;dinnerladies&quot; (1998–2000). She has won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress four times, more than any other performer, for her roles in &quot;My Beautiful Son&quot; (2001), &quot;Murder&quot; (2002), &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (2003), and &quot;Mo&quot; (2010). Walters and Helen Mirren are the only actresses to have won this award three consecutive times, and Walters is tied with Judi Dench for most nominations in the category with seven. She is the only actress to win the International Emmy Award for Best Actress twice, for her roles in &quot;A Short Stay in Switzerland&quot; (2009) and &quot;Mo&quot; (2010). In 2006, the British public voted Walters fourth in ITV&#x27;s poll of TV&#x27;s 50 Greatest Stars.

==Early life==
Julia Mary Walters was born on 22 February 1950 at St Chad&#x27;s Hospital in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England, the daughter of Mary Bridget (née O&#x27;Brien), an Irish Catholic postal clerk from County Mayo, and Thomas Walters, an English builder and decorator. According to the BBC genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, her maternal ancestors played an active part in the 19th-century Irish Land War. Her paternal grandfather Thomas Walters was a veteran of the Second Boer War, and was killed in action in World War I in June 1915 while serving with the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment; he is commemorated at the Le Touret Memorial in France. Walters and her family lived at 69 Bishopton Road in the Bearwood area of Smethwick. The youngest of five children and the third to survive birth, Walters had an early education at St Paul&#x27;s School for Girls in Edgbaston and later at Holly Lodge Grammar School for Girls in Smethwick. She said in 2014 that it was &quot;heaven when [she] went to an ordinary grammar school&quot;, although she was asked to leave at the end of her lower sixth because of her &quot;high jinks&quot;.

Walters later told interviewer Alison Oddey about her early schooling, &quot;I was never going to be academic, so [my mother] suggested that I try teaching or nursing. [...] I&#x27;d been asked to leave school, so I thought I&#x27;d better do it.&quot; Her first job was in insurance at the age of 15. At the age of 18, she trained as a student nurse at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham; she worked on the ophthalmic, casualty, and coronary care wards during the 18 months she spent there. She decided to leave nursing and went on to study acting at the newly established Manchester Polytechnic School of Theatre (now Manchester School of Theatre). She worked for the Everyman Theatre Company in Liverpool in the mid-1970s, alongside several other notable performers and writers such as Bill Nighy, Pete Postlethwaite, Jonathan Pryce, Willy Russell, and Alan Bleasdale.

==Career==
===1971–1979: Career beginnings===
Walters first received notice as the occasional partner of comedian Victoria Wood, whom she had originally met in 1971 when Wood auditioned at the School of Theatre in Manchester. The two first worked together in the 1978 theatre revue &quot;In at the Death&quot;, followed by the television adaptation of Wood&#x27;s play &quot;Talent&quot;.

They went on to appear in their own Granada Television series, &quot;Wood and Walters&quot;, in 1981. They continued to perform together frequently over the years. The BAFTA-winning BBC follow-up, &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot;, featured one of Walters&#x27;s best-known roles, Mrs Overall, in Wood&#x27;s parodic soap opera, &quot;Acorn Antiques&quot; (she later appeared in the musical version, and received an Olivier Award nomination for her efforts).

===1980–1989: &quot;Educating Rita&quot; and &quot;Buster&quot;===
Walters&#x27; first serious acting role on television was in Alan Bleasdale&#x27;s &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; in 1982. She came to national attention when she co-starred with Michael Caine in &quot;Educating Rita&quot; (1983), a role she had created on the West End stage in Willy Russell&#x27;s 1980 play. Playing Susan &quot;Rita&quot; White, a Liverpudlian working-class hairdresser who seeks to better herself by signing up for and attending an Open University course in English literature, she would receive the BAFTA Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical/Comedy, and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

She performed various comic monologues in &quot;The Green Tie on the Little Yellow Dog&quot;, which was recorded 1982, and broadcast by Channel 4 in 1983. In 1985, she played Adrian Mole&#x27;s mother, Pauline, in the television adaptation of &quot;The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole&quot;. Walters appeared in the lead role of Cynthia Payne in the 1987 film &quot;Personal Services&quot; – a dramatic comedy about a British brothel owner. Then she starred with Phil Collins, playing the lead character&#x27;s wife, June, in the film &quot;Buster&quot;, released in 1988. She also appeared as Mrs. Peachum in the 1989 film version of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, which was renamed &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; for the screen.

===1991–1999: Solo TV show and &quot;dinnerladies&quot;===
In 1991, Walters starred opposite Liza Minnelli in &quot;Stepping Out&quot;, and had a one-off television special, &quot;Julie Walters and Friends&quot;, which featured writing contributions from Victoria Wood, Alan Bennett, Willy Russell and Alan Bleasdale.

In 1993, Walters starred in the television film &quot;Wide-Eyed and Legless&quot; (known as &quot;The Wedding Gift&quot; outside the UK) alongside Jim Broadbent and Thora Hird. The film was based on the book by the author Deric Longden and tells the story of the final years of his marriage to his wife, Diana, who contracted a degenerative illness that medical officials were unable to understand at the time, though now believed to be a form of chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis.

In 1998, she starred as the Fairy Godmother in the ITV pantomime &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;. From 1998 until 2000, she played Petula Gordeno in Victoria Wood&#x27;s BBC sitcom &quot;dinnerladies&quot;. In the late 1990s, she featured in a series of adverts for Bisto gravy.

===2000–2009: &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; and authorship===

In 2001, Walters won a Laurence Olivier Award for her performance in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;All My Sons&quot;. She received her second Oscar nomination and won a BAFTA for her supporting role as the ballet teacher in &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; (2000). In 2002, she again won a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actress for her performance as Paul Reiser&#x27;s mother in &quot;My Beautiful Son&quot;.

Walters played Molly Weasley, the matriarch of the Weasley family, in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series (2001–2011). &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is the only film in the series not to have included Walters. In 2003, the BBC voted her portrayal of Molly as the &quot;second-best screen mother.&quot;

In 2003, Walters starred as a widow (Annie Clark) determined to make some good come out of her husband&#x27;s death from cancer in &quot;Calendar Girls&quot;, which starred Helen Mirren. In 2005, she again starred as an inspirational real-life figure, Marie Stubbs in the ITV1 drama &quot;Ahead of the Class&quot;. In 2006, she came fourth in ITV&#x27;s poll of the public&#x27;s 50 Greatest Stars, coming four places above frequent co-star Victoria Wood. In 2006, she starred in the film &quot;Driving Lessons&quot; alongside Rupert Grint (who played her son Ron in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;), and had a leading role in the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of Philip Pullman&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ruby in the Smoke&quot;.

In summer 2006, Walters published her first novel, &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Tree&quot;. The novel, concerning a group of English actors in Manhattan and published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, was described as &quot;a disturbing and thought-provoking novel about mental torment and the often blackly comic, mixed-up ways we view ourselves and misread each other.&quot;. Another reviewer, Susan Jeffreys, in &quot;The Independent&quot;, described the novel as &quot;the work of a writer who knows what she&#x27;s doing. There&#x27;s nothing tentative about the writing, and Walters brings her experiences as an actress to bear on the page. ... you do have the sensation of entering someone else&#x27;s mind and of looking through someone else&#x27;s eyes.&quot; Walters starred in Asda&#x27;s Christmas 2007 television advertising campaign. She also appeared alongside Patrick Stewart in UK Nintendo DS Brain Training television advertisements, and in a series of public information films about smoke alarms. In June 2008, Walters appeared in the film version of &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, playing Rosie Mulligan, marking her second high-profile musical, after &quot;Acorn Antiques: The Musical!&quot;. The same year, she released her autobiography, titled &quot;That&#x27;s Another Story&quot;.

In 2007, Walters starred as the mother of author Jane Austen (played by Anne Hathaway) in &quot;Becoming Jane&quot;. Walters played Mary Whitehouse in the BBC Drama &quot;&quot; (2008), an adaptation of the real-life story of Mrs. Whitehouse who campaigned for &quot;taste and decency on television&quot;. Walters commented, &quot;I am very excited to be playing Mary Whitehouse, and to be looking at the time when she attacked the BBC and started to make her name.&quot; &quot;Filth&quot; won Best Motion Picture Made for Television, and Walters was nominated for Best Actress in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made For Television, at the 2008 13th Annual Satellite Awards.

In 2009, she received a star in the Birmingham Walk of Stars on Birmingham&#x27;s Golden Mile, Broad Street. She said: &quot;I am very honoured and happy that the people of Birmingham and the West Midlands want to include me in their Walk of Stars and I look forward to receiving my star. Birmingham and the West Midlands is where I&#x27;m from; these are my roots and in essence it has played a big part in making me the person I am today&quot;. Her other awards include an International Emmy with for &quot;A Short Stay in Switzerland&quot;.

===2010–2019: Independent films and supporting roles===

Walters played the late MP and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam in the drama &quot;Mo&quot; for Channel 4 broadcast in early 2010. She had misgivings about taking on the role because of the differences in their physical appearance, but the result was highly praised by critics.

In July 2012, Walters appeared in the BBC Two production &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; as Mistress Quickly in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Parts I and II&quot;. In the summer of 2012, she voiced the Witch in Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Brave&quot; (2012). In 2012, she worked with LV= to promote one of their life insurance products targeted at people over 50. Walters was seen in television advertisements, at the lv.com website and in other marketing material helping to raise awareness for life insurance.

Walters appeared in &quot;The Last of the Haussmans&quot; at the Royal National Theatre in June 2012. The production was broadcast to cinemas around the world through the National Theatre Live programme. On 18 November 2012, Walters appeared on stage at St Martin&#x27;s Theatre in the West End for a 60th anniversary performance of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, the world&#x27;s longest-running play.
In 2014, Walters portrayed Mrs. Bird, the Browns&#x27; housekeeper, in the critically acclaimed &quot;Paddington&quot; (2014). Walters reprised her role for the sequel, &quot;Paddington 2&quot; (2017), which has also received universal acclaim. Upon the 2014 release of &quot;Paddington&quot;, Walters designed a &quot;Primrose&quot;-themed Paddington Bear statue, which was located in Primrose Hill (one of 50 placed around London), with the statues auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

Walters played the part of Cynthia Coffin in the ten-part British drama serial &quot;Indian Summers&quot; aired on Channel 4 in 2015. In 2015, she appeared in the romantic drama film &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, a film that was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Her performance in the film earned her a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

Walters voiced the Lexi Decoder (LEXI) for Channel 4 during the 2016 Paralympic Games. The graphical system aims to aid the viewing experience of the games by debunking the often confusing classifications that govern Paralympic sport. Set in London during the depression, Walters played Ellen, Michael&#x27;s and Jane&#x27;s long-time housekeeper, in &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; (2018).

===2020–present: recent work===
In 2020 Walters starred with Colin Firth in &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (2020). Also in 2020, Walters featured as the narrator for ITV documentary &quot;For the Love of Britain&quot;.

On 25 December 2021 Channel 4 aired &quot;The Abominable Snow Baby&quot;, in which Walters appeared as Granny, providing her voice for the animated television short film.

In May 2022 it was announced that Walters would star in &quot;Truelove&quot;, an upcoming drama series from Channel 4. That same month, Walters narrated the BBC documentary &quot;The Queen: 70 Glorious Years&quot;, which took a look at the Queen&#x27;s life in her seventieth year on the British throne. In March 2023, however, she pulled out of filming &quot;Truelove&quot; due to &quot;ill health&quot;, according to &quot;The Times&quot;, and her role was taken over by Lindsay Duncan.

==Personal life==
Walters&#x27; relationship with Grant Roffey, a patrol man for the AA, began in 1985 after a chance meeting in a Fulham pub, where Roffey told her that he voted Labour. He was invited to repair Walters&#x27; washing machine, a whirlwind romance ensued and the couple became parents to their only child, a daughter, whom they named Maisie Mae Roffey (born 26 April 1988). The couple delayed marriage until they visited New York City in 1997. The family live on an organic farm operated by Roffey near Plaistow, West Sussex.

Walters is a lifelong supporter of West Bromwich Albion Football Club, having been brought up in Smethwick. She is a patron of the domestic violence survivors&#x27; charity Women&#x27;s Aid.

===Illness===
Walters was diagnosed with stage III bowel cancer in 2018. Having had surgery and chemotherapy, she entered remission. This meant that she had to be cut from certain scenes in &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; and also had to miss the premiere of &quot;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&quot;. Walters did not announce her illness to the public until February 2020, when she said in an interview with Victoria Derbyshire that she would be taking a step back from acting, particularly from large and demanding film roles. Later that year, however, she stated that she would make an exception for roles that she was &#x27;really engaged&#x27; with, including &quot;Mamma Mia 3!&quot;, which was in development as of 2021.

In March 2023, Walters announced she had withdrawn from appearing in a new Channel 4 drama, &quot;Truelove&quot;, due to ill health. She was replaced in the show by Lindsay Duncan.

<text>LilyPond is a computer program and file format for music engraving. One of LilyPond&#x27;s major goals is to produce scores that are engraved with traditional layout rules, reflecting the era when scores were engraved by hand.

LilyPond is cross-platform, and is available for several common operating systems; released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, LilyPond is free software and part of the GNU Project.

==History==
The LilyPond project was started in 1996 by Han-Wen Nienhuys and Jan Nieuwenhuizen, after they decided to abandon work on MPP (MusiXTeX PreProcessor), a project they began collaborating on in 1995. Its name was inspired both by the Rosegarden project and an acquaintance of Nienhuys and Nieuwenhuizen named Suzanne, a name that means lily in Hebrew ().

=== Version 1.0 ===
LilyPond 1.0 was released on July 31, 1998, highlighting the development of a custom music font, Feta, and the complete separation of LilyPond from MusiXTeX.

=== Version 2.0 ===
LilyPond 2.0 was released on September 24, 2003, announcing a simplified syntax model and a much more complete set of facilities for notating various styles of music.

==Design==
LilyPond is mostly written in C++ and uses Scheme (interpreted by GNU Guile) as its extension language, allowing for user customization. It has a relatively large codebase; as of March 10, 2017, the source includes over 600,000 lines of C++, 140,000 lines of Scheme, and 120,000 lines of Python code.

It uses a simple text notation for music input, which LilyPond interprets and processes in a series of stages. In the final stage, music notation is output to PDF (via PostScript) or other graphical formats, such as SVG or PNG. LilyPond can also generate MIDI files that correspond to the music notation output.

LilyPond is a text-based application, so it does not contain its own graphical user interface to assist with score creation. (However, a text-editor based &quot;LilyPad&quot; GUI for Windows and MacOS is included by default on these systems.) It does, however, have a flexible input language that strives to be simple, easing the learning curve for new users. LilyPond adheres to the WYSIWYM paradigm; the workflow for typesetting music notation with LilyPond is similar to that of preparing documents with LaTeX.

LilyPond supports experimental musical notation. Its guitar facilities support alternative tunings, such as major-thirds tuning.

==Software features==

LilyPond&#x27;s primary goal is to produce output comparable to professionally engraved scores instead of output that looks mechanical and computer-generated. An essay from the LilyPond website, written by LilyPond developers, explains some typographical issues addressed by LilyPond:

* Optical font scaling: depending on the staff size, the design of the music font is slightly altered; this is a feature that Donald Knuth&#x27;s Computer Modern font is known for. As a result, note heads become more rounded, and staff lines become thicker.
* Optical spacing: stem directions are taken into account when spacing subsequent notes.
* Special ledger line handling: ledger lines are shortened when accidentals are nearby, thus enhancing readability.
* Proportional spacing: notes can be positioned in such a way that &quot;exactly&quot; reflects their duration. For example, with this setting, the space between consecutive quarter notes is four times greater than between consecutive sixteenth notes.

==Overview of input syntax==
The native input language for LilyPond is comprehensive, and consists of many commands needed for expressing any sort of articulation, dynamic, meter, etc. It is similar to that of TeX. The ability to embed Scheme code within a LilyPond source file permits arbitrary extensions to the input language and assists with algorithmic composition. Some general syntactic features are listed below.

* Single-line comments begin with a percent sign codice_1.
* Notes are represented in &quot;pitch-duration&quot; format: &quot;pitch&quot; is specified with Helmholtz pitch notation, and &quot;duration&quot; is specified with a numeral based system. The semantics of the &quot;pitch-duration&quot; format change depending on the active input mode; this is explained in depth in the LilyPond manual. For example, in absolute mode, codice_2 is an A, one octave up from the base A (A3 in scientific pitch notation), of quarter note length.
* Commands usually begin with a backslash (such as codice_3, or codice_4). The function of the command in question determines where the command is placed; for example, if the command is used to indicate a fixed dynamic on a specific note, it is placed &quot;after&quot; the note.
* Some common commands are represented symbolically to ease typing. One example is with slurs, where codice_5 and codice_6 indicate the beginning and ending of a slur, respectively. Another example is with manual beaming, where codice_7 and codice_8 indicate the extent of the beam.

LilyPond&#x27;s interface with Pango requires the input character encoding to be UTF-8. One benefit of this is that more than one language can be included in the same source file.

===Corresponding output===
===More complex output===
Lilypond can also create extensively customised output. An example is the short extract of a Karlheinz Stockhausen piano piece below.

==Collaboration with other projects==

Several graphical scorewriters—such as Rosegarden, NoteEdit, Canorus, Denemo, and TuxGuitar—can export files directly to LilyPond format. Other graphical applications serve as front ends to LilyPond, including Frescobaldi and the LilyPondTool plugin for jEdit. Denemo integrates the PDF output of LilyPond in its display, allowing some editing operations on the final typeset score.

The Mutopia Project, which distributes free content sheet music, uses LilyPond to typeset its music, as does Musipedia, a collaborative music encyclopedia.

Emacs&#x27; org-mode contains support for embedding LilyPond scores into documents.

OOoLilyPond, a LibreOffice extension provides support for calling LilyPond to embed scores into documents.

=== Integration into MediaWiki ===
Lilypond is available in MediaWiki via the code.
This, for example, transforms the notation

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\relative c&#x27; { 
\key d \major
fis4 fis g a a g fis e d d e fis fis4. e8 e2 }&lt;/score&gt;

into

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\relative c&#x27; { 
\key d \major
fis4 fis g a a g fis e d d e fis fis4. e8 e2 }&lt;/score&gt;

The above is an excerpt from Ludwig van Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, commonly known as &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;. More complex scores, including lyrics, are also possible within MediaWiki wikis. 

===Integration into text using lilypond-book===
Integration of LilyPond musical elements into various document formats (both TeX-based systems such as LaTeX and Texinfo, and also DocBook and HTML pages) is natively supported through the companion program lilypond-book, developed and maintained by the LilyPond community. This allows users to embed musical elements within texts, such as musicology, song booklets, work sheets for teaching, and school examinations.

===Integration into LaTeX===
For integration into the LaTeX document preparation system, lyLuaTeX has been developed as a LuaLaTeX package to embed musical elements within texts. It includes features for matching layout and appearance of the musical elements with the surrounding text document. Music elements may consist of music symbols, song lyrics, guitar chords diagrams, lead sheets, music excerpts, guitar tablatures, or multi-page scores.

==Comparison to other scorewriters==
Finale and Sibelius are two proprietary scorewriters often compared to LilyPond. Andrew Hawryluk, a LilyPond user, wrote a series of articles comparing output quality between Finale and LilyPond.

Another scorewriter with comparable features to LilyPond is SCORE, but SCORE relies on manual positioning more than Lilypond does.

<doc id="169146" wikidata="Q814902" url="?curid=169146" title="Cold cathode">
<text>A cold cathode is a cathode that is not electrically heated by a filament. A cathode may be considered &quot;cold&quot; if it emits more electrons than can be supplied by thermionic emission alone. It is used in gas-discharge lamps, such as neon lamps, discharge tubes, and some types of vacuum tube. The other type of cathode is a hot cathode, which is heated by electric current passing through a filament. A cold cathode does not necessarily operate at a low temperature: it is often heated to its operating temperature by other methods, such as the current passing from the cathode into the gas.

==Cold-cathode devices==
A cold-cathode vacuum tube does not rely on external heating of an electrode to provide thermionic emission of electrons. Early cold-cathode devices included the Geissler tube and Plucker tube, and early cathode-ray tubes. Study of the phenomena in these devices led to the discovery of the electron.

Neon lamps are used both to produce light as indicators and for special-purpose illumination, and also as circuit elements displaying negative resistance. Addition of a trigger electrode to a device allowed the glow discharge to be initiated by an external control circuit; Bell Laboratories developed a &quot;trigger tube&quot; cold-cathode device in 1936.

Many types of cold-cathode switching tube were developed, including various types of thyratron, the krytron, cold-cathode displays (Nixie tube) and others. Voltage regulator tubes rely on the relatively constant voltage of a glow discharge over a range of current and were used to stabilize power-supply voltages in tube-based instruments. A Dekatron is a cold-cathode tube with multiple electrodes that is used for counting. Each time a pulse is applied to a control electrode, a glow discharge moves to a step electrode; by providing ten electrodes in each tube and cascading the tubes, a counter system can be developed and the count observed by the position of the glow discharges. Counter tubes were used widely before development of integrated circuit counter devices.

The flash tube is a cold-cathode device filled with xenon gas, used to produce an intense short pulse of light for photography or to act as a stroboscope to examine the motion of moving parts.

===Lamps===
Cold-cathode lamps include cold-cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) and neon lamps. Neon lamps primarily rely on excitation of gas molecules to emit light; CCFLs use a discharge in mercury vapor to develop ultraviolet light, which in turn causes a fluorescent coating on the inside of the lamp to emit visible light.

Cold-cathode fluorescent lamps were used for backlighting of LCDs, for example computer monitors and television screens.

In the lighting industry, “cold cathode” historically refers to luminous tubing larger than 20 mm in diameter and operating on a current of 120 to 240 milliamperes. This larger-diameter tubing is often used for interior alcove and general lighting.
The term &quot;neon lamp&quot; refers to tubing that is smaller than 15 mm in diameter and typically operates at approximately 40 milliamperes. These lamps are commonly used for neon signs.

==Details==
The cathode is the negative electrode. Any gas-discharge lamp has a positive (anode) and a negative electrode. Both electrodes alternate between acting as an anode and a cathode when these devices run with alternating current.


A &quot;cold cathode&quot; is distinguished from a hot cathode that is heated to induce thermionic emission of electrons. Discharge tubes with hot cathodes have an envelope filled with low-pressure gas and containing two electrodes. Hot cathode devices include common vacuum tubes, fluorescent lamps, high-pressure discharge lamps and vacuum fluorescent displays.

The surface of cold cathodes can emit secondary electrons at a ratio greater than unity (breakdown). An electron that leaves the cathode will collide with neutral gas molecules. The collision may just excite the molecule, but sometimes it will knock an electron free to create a positive ion. The original electron and the freed electron continue toward the anode and may create more positive ions (see Townsend avalanche). The result is for each electron that leaves the cathode, several positive ions are generated that eventually crash onto the cathode. Some crashing positive ions may generate a secondary electron. The discharge is self-sustaining when for each electron that leaves the cathode, enough positive ions hit the cathode to free, on average, another electron. External circuitry limits the discharge current. Cold-cathode discharge lamps use higher voltages than hot-cathode ones. The resulting strong electric field near the cathode accelerates ions to a sufficient velocity to create free electrons from the cathode material.

Another mechanism to generate free electrons from a cold metallic surface is field electron emission. It is used in some x-ray tubes, the field-electron microscope (FEM), and field-emission displays (FEDs).

Cold cathodes sometimes have a rare-earth coating to enhance electron emission. Some types contain a source of beta radiation to start ionization of the gas that fills the tube. In some tubes, glow discharge around the cathode is usually minimized; instead there is a so-called positive column, filling the tube. Examples are the neon lamp and nixie tubes. Nixie tubes too are cold-cathode neon displays that are in-line, but not in-plane, display devices.

Cold-cathode devices typically use a complex high-voltage power supply with some mechanism for limiting current. Although creating the initial space charge and the first arc of current through the tube may require a very high voltage, once the tube begins to heat up, the electrical resistance drops, thus increasing the electric current through the lamp. To offset this effect and maintain normal operation, the supply voltage is gradually lowered. In the case of tubes with an ionizing gas, the gas can become a very hot plasma, and electrical resistance is greatly reduced. If operated from a simple power supply without current limiting, this reduction in resistance would lead to damage to the power supply and overheating of the tube electrodes.

==Applications==

Cold cathodes are used in cold-cathode rectifiers, such as the crossatron and mercury-arc valves, and cold-cathode amplifiers, such as in automatic message accounting and other pseudospark switching applications. Other examples include the thyratron, krytron, sprytron, and ignitron tubes.

A common cold-cathode application is in neon signs and other locations where the ambient temperature is likely to drop well below freezing, The Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster (Big Ben) uses cold-cathode lighting behind the clock faces where continual striking and failure to strike in cold weather would be undesirable. Large cold-cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) have been produced in the past and are still used today when shaped, long-life linear light sources are required. , miniature CCFLs were extensively used as backlights for computer and television liquid-crystal displays. CCFL lifespans vary in LCD televisions depending on transient voltage surges and temperature levels in usage environments.

Due to its efficiency, CCFL technology has expanded into room lighting. Costs are similar to those of traditional fluorescent lighting, but with several advantages: it has a long life, the light emitted is , bulbs turn on instantly to full output and are also dimmable.

===Effects of internal heating===
In systems using alternating current but without separate anode structures, the electrodes alternate as anodes and cathodes, and the impinging electrons can cause substantial localized heating, often to red heat. The electrode may take advantage of this heating to facilitate the thermionic emission of electrons when it is acting as a cathode. (&quot;Instant-start&quot; fluorescent lamps employ this aspect; they start as cold-cathode devices, but soon localized heating of the fine tungsten-wire cathodes causes them to operate in the same mode as hot-cathode lamps.)

This aspect is problematic in the case of backlights used for LCD TV displays. New energy-efficiency regulations being proposed in many countries will require variable backlighting; variable backlighting also improves the perceived contrast range, which is desirable for LCD TV sets. However, CCFLs are strictly limited in the degree to which they can be dimmed, both because a lower plasma current will lower the temperature of the cathode, causing erratic operation, and because running the cathode at too low a temperature drastically shortens the life of the lamps. Much research is being directed to this problem, but high-end manufacturers are now turning to high-efficiency white LEDs as a better solution.

<text>The Vickers Valiant was a British high-altitude jet bomber designed to carry nuclear weapons, and in the 1950s and 1960s was part of the Royal Air Force&#x27;s &quot;V bomber&quot; strategic deterrent force. It was developed by Vickers-Armstrongs in response to Specification B.35/46 issued by the Air Ministry for a nuclear-armed jet-powered bomber. The Valiant was the first of the V bombers to become operational, and was followed by the Handley Page Victor and the Avro Vulcan. The Valiant is the only V bomber to have dropped live nuclear weapons (for test purposes).

In 1956, Valiants operating from Malta flew conventional bombing missions over Egypt for Operation Musketeer during the Suez Crisis. From 1956 until early 1966 the main Valiant force was used in the nuclear deterrence role in the confrontation between NATO and the Warsaw Pact powers. Other squadrons undertook aerial refuelling, aerial reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare.

In 1962, in response to advances in Soviet Union surface-to-air missile (SAM) technology, the V-force fleet including the Valiant changed from high-level flying to flying at low-level to avoid high altitude SAM attacks. In 1964 it was found that Valiants showed fatigue and crystalline corrosion in wing rear spar attachment forgings. In late 1964 a repair programme was underway, but a change of Government led to the new Minister of Defence Denis Healey deciding that the Valiant should be retired from service, and this happened in early 1965. The Victor and Vulcan V-bombers remained in service until the 1980s.

==Development==
===Background and origins===
In November 1944, the Joint Technical Warfare Committee, along with a separate committee chaired by Sir Henry Tizard, examined the future potential of &quot;weapons of war&quot; and the accompanying Tizard Report published on 3 July 1945 made specific policy directions for the Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command. After the Second World War, the policy of using heavy four-engined bombers for massed raids continued into the immediate postwar period; the Avro Lincoln, an updated version of the Avro Lancaster, became the RAF&#x27;s standard bomber. In 1946, the Air Staff issued Operational Requirements OR229 and OR230 for the development of turbojet-powered heavy bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons at high altitude and speed, without defensive armament, to act as a deterrent to hostile powers and, if deterrence failed, to perform a nuclear strike. In conjunction with this ambition, Britain set about developing its own atomic weapons.

In January 1947, the British Air Ministry issued Specification B.35/46 for an advanced jet bomber intended to carry nuclear weapons and to fly near the speed of sound at altitudes of . Three firms: A.V. Roe, Handley-Page and Vickers-Armstrongs submitted advanced designs intended to meet the stringent requirements. While Short Brothers submitted a design, by Geoffrey T. R. Hill, that was judged too ambitious, the Air Staff accepted another submission from the company for a separate requirement, B.14/46, as &quot;insurance&quot; in case the advanced B.35/46 effort ran into trouble. Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist described Specification B.14/46 as &quot;calling for little more than a traditional aircraft fitted with jet engines&quot; Short submitted a conservative design to meet B.14/46, which became the S.A.4 Sperrin. Two prototypes were completed, the first conducting its maiden flight in 1951, but the Sperrin was ultimately relegated to research and development purposes only.

Vickers had emerged from World War II as one of the world&#x27;s pre-eminent companies in the field of aeronautical manufacturing and development. The company operated its own secretive Skunk Works-like development organisation based at Weybridge, Surrey, which had been involved in several secret wartime development projects. It was this secretive division where the early development of the Valiant took place, including the later assembly of the initial two prototypes. Vickers initially produced a six-engine jet bomber design proposal to meet Specification B.35/46. As progress in the development of more powerful jet engines was made, this was re-worked to a four-engine proposal in 1948. The proposed design submitted by Vickers was relatively straightforward, being less aerodynamically advanced in comparison to competing bids made by rival firms.

Both Handley-Page and Avro had produced advanced designs for the bomber competition. These were produced as the Victor and the Vulcan respectively. The Air Staff decided to award contracts to each company as a form of insurance in case one of the designs failed. The submissions became known as the V bombers, or V-class, with the aircraft given names that started with the letter &quot;V&quot;. Vickers&#x27; submission had initially been rejected as not being as advanced as the Victor and the Vulcan, but Vickers&#x27; chief designer George Edwards lobbied the Air Ministry on the basis that it would be available much sooner than the competition, going so far as to promise that a prototype would be flown by the end of 1951, that subsequent production aircraft would be flown prior to the end of 1953, and that serial deliveries would commence during early 1955. Gaining the bomber contract was considered of crucial importance to the future of aircraft manufacturing at Vickers. &quot;Edwards was supremely confident that Weybridge could deliver the aircraft as specified .. &quot; and &quot;..committed to the brochure performance figures and dates because he thought they knew how to do it&quot;. He resisted being pushed to try to more closely match the Victor and Vulcan height and speed requirements or to change equipment from that originally specified as these distractions would jeopardize his promised delivery dates.

Although developing three different aircraft types in response to a single Operational Requirement (OR) was costly, events such as the Berlin Blockade had led to a sense of urgency in providing a deterrent to the Soviet Union from possible acts of aggression in Western Europe.

In April 1948, the Air Staff issued a specification with the designation B.9/48 written around the Type 660 Vickers design; and an &#x27;Instruction to Proceed&#x27; was received by Vickers on 16 April 1948.

In February 1949, two prototypes of the Vickers 660 series were ordered. The first was to be fitted with four Rolls-Royce RA.3 Avon turbojet engines, while the second was to be fitted with four Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire engines and was designated the Type 667.

===Prototypes===

On 18 May 1951, the first prototype, serial number WB210 took to the air for its maiden flight, within the deadline that George Edwards had promised, only 27 months since the contract had been issued. This was several months before the competing Short Sperrin; the Sperrin had straight (not swept) wings and was not ordered. The Valiant pilot was Captain Joseph &quot;Mutt&quot; Summers, who had also been the original test pilot on the Supermarine Spitfire, and wanted to add another &quot;first&quot; to his record before he retired. His co-pilot on the first flight was Gabe &quot;Jock&quot; Bryce, who succeeded Summers as Vickers&#x27; chief test pilot upon his retirement shortly after. The next month, the Vickers Type 660 was given the official name of &quot;Valiant&quot;, reusing the name given to the Vickers Type 131 general-purpose biplane of 1931. The name Valiant had been selected by a survey of Vickers employees.

On 11 January 1952, the first Valiant prototype was lost while making internal noise measurements for the V.1000 programme. Testing included engine shutdowns and re-lights, one of which caused a fire in the starboard wing; most of the crew managed to escape the aircraft safely, except for the co-pilot, who struck the tail after ejecting.

On 11 April 1952, the second prototype WB215 made its maiden flight, after modifications to the fuel system. It was fitted with more powerful RA.7 Avon engines with thrust each, rather than the originally planned Sapphires. It also featured more rounded air inlets, replacing the narrow slot-type intakes of the first prototype, to feed sufficient air to the more powerful engines. The short delay until the second prototype became available meant that loss of the prototype did not compromise the development schedule.

===The Valiant B2===
One of the three prototypes was the B.2 version. The B.2 was intended to serve as a Pathfinder aircraft, flying at low level to mark targets for the main bomber force. To cope with increased air turbulence at low level, the B.2 had a strengthened airframe. In particular, the wing was strengthened with the removal of the cut-outs in the wing structure into which the main wheels retracted, allowing the wing torsion box structure to be uninterrupted and giving more room for internal fuel storage. Instead, the main landing gear, which had four wheels instead of the two wheels of the B.1, retracted backwards into large fairings set into the rear of the wings. The B.2 had a lengthened fuselage with a total length of , in contrast to a length of for the Valiant B.1, with the extra length giving room for more avionics.

The prototype B.2, serial number WJ954 first flew on 4 September 1953. Finished in a gloss black night operations paint scheme, it became known as the &quot;Black Bomber&quot;. Its performance at low level was superior to that of the B.1 (or any other V-bomber), particularly at sea level, with the aircraft being cleared for at low level (with speeds of up to being reached in testing). This was compared to the B.1 sea-level limit of . The Air Ministry ordered 17 production B.2 aircraft, which were to be powered by Rolls-Royce Conway turbofans. Although the Valiant B.2 low-level capabilities were significant, the programme was terminated because the World War 2 &quot;Pathfinder concept&quot; was considered obsolete in the nuclear era. The B.2 prototype was used for tests for a few years, including the clearance of rocket-assisted take-offs, for the Valiant B.1 at hot or high airfields, using two Super-Sprite rocket motors. It also did extensive taxiing tests to investigate the cause of brake judder which caused a fatigue failure of the landing gear. It was scrapped in 1958.

===Production===

In April 1951, an initial production order for 25 Valiant B.1 (Bomber Mark 1) aircraft was placed by the Ministry of Supply on behalf of the RAF. The timing of this order was key to establishing production quickly. Due to shortages of steel and other materials while setting up an assembly line at Brooklands, substantial portions of the production jigs for the Valiant were made from concrete. The first five Valiants produced were completed to a pre-production standard, the first being WP199. On 21 December 1953, the production aircraft conducted its first flight; this had again occurred within the schedule that Edwards had promised.

On 8 February 1955, this first production Valiant was delivered to the RAF. Britain&#x27;s &quot;V-bomber&quot; force, as it had been nicknamed in October 1952, formally entered operational service on that day. The Victor and Vulcan would soon follow the Valiant into service, for a total of three types of nuclear-armed strategic bombers in RAF service. In September 1957, the final Valiant was delivered. All production aircraft had been delivered on time and below budget.

A total of 108 Valiants were manufactured, including the sole B.2 prototype.

In addition to its principal role as part of Britain&#x27;s nuclear deterrent, the Valiant bomber also dropped high explosive bombs. The bombers were followed into service by a strategic reconnaissance version and a multi-purpose version capable conventional bombing, aerial reconnaissance and aerial refuelling.

18 squadron operated 6 Valiants with electronic countermeasures equipment.

Valiants of 90 and 214 squadrons were used for air refuelling through the addition of a Hose Drum Unit (HDU) in the bomb bay, mounted on the same suspension units that were also used for bombs. This meant that for refuelling, the bomb-bay doors had to be opened so that the refuelling hose could be streamed (unlike later tankers where the HDU was flush with the under fuselage rather than inside a bomb bay).

Several Valiants were also used for testing and development purposes, such as its use as a flying testbed during trials of the Blue Steel nuclear-armed standoff missile, which was later added to the arsenal of munitions the other V-bombers were equipped with.

Unlike the Vulcan and Victor, the Valiant did not see the production of a more capable mark 2 model.

In 1962 the Valiant bomber squadrons were switched to a low-level flight profile in order to avoid enemy Surface-to-Air (SAM) defence systems.

In 1964 fatigue was discovered due to the increased air turbulence in low level flying and led to the type&#x27;s premature retirement. Vic Flintham observed that: &quot;There is a fine irony to the situation, for Vickers had produced the Type 673 B Mk 2 version designed as a fast, low-level pathfinder... The Air Ministry was not interested...&quot; The Valiant was Vickers&#x27; last purpose-built military aircraft. It was followed by the Vanguard, a passenger turboprop designed in 1959, and the Vickers VC10, a jet passenger aircraft in 1962, also used as a military transport and tanker by the RAF.

==Design==

The Valiant was based on contemporary aeronautical knowledge with no advanced untried aerodynamics that required proving with scaled-down research aircraft or lengthy research and development. As a result George Edwards described the Valiant appropriately and simply but using his own, mostly original, idiom as an &quot;unfunny&quot; aircraft.
The Valiant had a shoulder-mounted wing and four Rolls-Royce Avon RA.3 turbojet engines, each providing up to of thrust, installed in pairs in fireproof bays in each wing root. The design of the Valiant gave an overall impression of a clean aircraft with swept-wing aerodynamics. The root chord thickness ratio of 12% allowed the Avon engines to be within the wing rather than on pods as in the contemporary Boeing B-47. This &quot;buried engine&quot; installation contributed to the aircraft&#x27;s aerodynamic cleanness, and was British practice at the time. It made engine access for maintenance and repair difficult and increased the risk that an uncontained failure of one engine would cause damage to the adjacent engine; it also increased the complexity of the design of the main spar which had to be routed around the engines.

The wing of the Valiant used a &quot;compound sweep&quot; configuration, devised by Vickers aerodynamicist Elfyn Richards. Richards found that it was necessary to increase the sweep on the inboard section of the wing, a discovery which he later patented as &quot;Improvements in Aeroplane Wing Formation&quot; with an explanation that &quot;the formation of the shockwaves be delayed to the same extent over the whole span of the wing&quot;; the Valiant wing had 37° sweepback for the inner third of the wing, and 21° for the remainder. This was because the thickness/chord ratio could be reduced closer to the tips. The choice to have mild sweepback around the aerodynamic control surfaces meant that in-service speeds were limited to Mach 0.84 and a typical cruise of Mach 0.75 at heights up to when lightly loaded. A drogue parachute was not necessary even operating from runways as short as .

The wing was mounted high on the fuselage and the location of the engines and main landing gear within the wing limited the volume available for fuel. The trailing edge of the wing had two-section ailerons with trim tabs, and inboard of the ailerons were double-slotted flaps. Direct electrical drives were used to move the flaps and landing gear. The only hydraulically-operated equipment, the steering and brakes, was also powered by electric motors but driving hydraulic pumps instead of mechanical gearing.
Production aircraft were powered by four Avon 201 turbojet engines, with thrust. The engines also provided bleed air for the pressurization, ice protection, and air conditioning systems. The aircraft&#x27;s DC electrical generators were also driven by the engines. Napier Spraymat electric heaters were installed in the engine inlets to prevent ice formation and subsequent shedding possibly causing engine damage. The shape of the engine inlets were long rectangular slots in the first prototype, whereas production Valiants had oval or &quot;spectacle&quot; shaped inlets designed to pass greater airflow for the more powerful engines that were installed. The jet exhausts emerged from fairings above the trailing edge of the wings.

For required takeoff performance from short tropical dispersal bases, a jettisonable rocket booster engines pack was developed for the Valiant. Trials were performed with two underwing de Havilland Sprite boosters; they were no longer needed when more powerful variants of the Avon engine became available. Also, there was an increased risk of accidents if one booster rocket failed on takeoff, resulting in asymmetric thrust. Some Valiant engines had water injection, which increased takeoff thrust by about per engine.

The crew were in a pressurized compartment in the forward fuselage and consisted of a pilot, co-pilot, two navigators, and air signaller (later called an air electronics officer (AEO)). Manufacture of this pressurized section was subcontracted to Saunders-Roe. The pilot and co-pilot were located side by side on an upper level, the remaining three crew members sat at stations lower in the cockpit, and faced to the rear. The crew was reduced to five with the deleted requirement for defensive gun turrets and air gunners, an operational philosophy proved by the De Havilland Mosquito bomber of World War II. The pilot and copilot were provided with Martin-Baker Mk.3 ejector seats, while the rear crew had to bail out of the oval main entrance door on the port side of the fuselage. Safe escape using this exit was not considered likely.
The fuselage area behind the pressurised crew section and forward of the wing was used to house much of the avionics, and air conditioning equipment, and was sometimes called the &quot;organ loft&quot;. The Valiant had twin-wheel nosegear and tandem-wheel main gear that retracted outwards into recesses in the underside of the wing. Each of the main gears were equipped with multipad anti-skid disc brakes, and were telescopically linked so that a single drive motor could pull them up into the wing recesses. Most of the aircraft systems were electric, including the flaps and undercarriage. The brakes and steering gear were electrically powered, driving hydraulic pumps for actuation. The lower half of the aircraft nose contained the scanner for the H2S radar in a glass fiber radome; in addition, a visual bomb sight was located beneath the lower floor of the pressurised cockpit. The avionics bay was not accessible from the cockpit but could be accessed using an entrance at the base of the rear fuselage leading to an internal catwalk above the aft part of the bomb bay.

The electrical systems used 112 volt direct current generators, one on each engine, for functions requiring large amounts of electrical power. A 28 V DC system was used for other uses including actuators that controlled the higher-voltage system functions. Backup power came from 24 V and 96 V batteries. 115 V alternating current was provided for the radar and the actuators for the flight surfaces, flaps, air brakes and undercarriage. It was decided during the design phase that as much of the aircraft would be electrically driven as was possible; the complete electrical system including high voltage generators and cabling, together with electric motors with mechanical drives, was lighter than the hydraulic equivalent consisting of pumps, tubing, actuators, fluid and storage tanks.

The flight controls of the Valiant (ailerons, elevator and rudder) consisted of two channels of power control with full manual backup; flying in manual was practised during training as it would be required if a complete electrical failure occurred during a flight. In &quot;manual&quot; the flight controls required considerable physical effort to operate. The pilot&#x27;s controls for elevators, ailerons and rudder had an artificial feel system, the pressure for which was provided from a ram-air inlet.

A Smith Aerospace autopilot and instrument landing system (ILS) was installed along with various navigational aids, such as the Marconi Company-built Green Satin doppler radar, Gee radio navigation, Automatic Direction Finder (ADF), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), and radar altimeters. Provisions for additional equipment and sensors, such as side looking airborne radar, were also made.
The centre fuselage of the Valiant had a main backbone beam to support the weight of the two widely-set wing spars and five fuel cells in the upper fuselage. The bomb bay was also in the lower half of the centre fuselage. The aft fuselage used a semi-monocoque structure, being lighter than the centre fuselage; the Boulton-Paul-produced electro-hydraulic power units for the ailerons, elevators, and rudder were contained within this space. The tail, which was attached to the rear fuselage was tapered rather than swept back, the horizontal tailplane was mounted well up the vertical fin to keep it clear of the engines&#x27; exhaust. The tailcone contained an ARI 5800 Orange Putter tail warning radar.

The main structural components, spars and beams of the Valiant had been constructed from a zinc/magnesium/copper aluminium alloy called DTD683 in the UK. The Valiant had been designed with a &#x27;Safe-Life&#x27; strategy; this combination of &#x27;Safe-Life&#x27; and DTD683 came to be viewed as a severe mistake. In 1956, a publication within the Journal of the Institute of Metals condemned the material DTD683 as being unstable and capable of catastrophic failure when stressing the airframe close to its design limits. The &quot;Safe-Life&quot; design strategy was dismissed by a Lockheed engineer in a talk given to the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1956, because it did not guarantee safety from catastrophic failure.

The Valiant B.1 could carry a nuclear weapon or up to 21 conventional bombs in its bomb bay. It was designed for the early fission-based nuclear weapons and also the newer and larger thermonuclear hydrogen bombs. A &quot;clean&quot; Valiant (one without underwing tanks) could climb straight to 50,000 ft after takeoff unless it had heavy stores in the large bomb bay.

In the aerial reconnaissance role, a camera crate would be installed in the bomb bay, along with a pair of cameras set into the fuselage and larger rear fuel tanks to extend the aircraft&#x27;s endurance. Large external fuel tanks under each wing with a capacity of , could be used to extend range; an auxiliary fuel tank could also be installed in the forward area of the bomb bay; the external wing tanks were fitted as standard on Valiants that were operated as aerial refuelling tankers. For receiving fuel, a fixed refuelling probe was fitted onto the aircraft&#x27;s nose, this was connected to the fuel tanks via a pipe running along the outside of the canopy to avoid penetrating the pressure cabin.

==Operational history==

===Nuclear deterrent===
The first squadron to be equipped with the Valiant was 138 Squadron, which formed at RAF Gaydon on 1 January 1955, with 232 Operational Conversion Unit forming at Gaydon on 21 February 1955 to convert crews to the new bomber. Since the Valiant was part of an entirely new class of bombers for the RAF, the crews for the new type were selected from experienced aircrew, with first pilots requiring 1,750 flying hours as an aircraft captain, with at least one tour flying the Canberra, with second pilots needing 700 hours in command and the remaining three crewmembers had to be recommended for posting to the Valiant by their commanding officers. Valiants were originally assigned to the strategic nuclear bombing role, as were the Vulcan and Victor B.1s when they became operational. At its peak, the Valiant equipped ten RAF squadrons.

According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Valiant had performed &quot;extremely well&quot; during the annual bombing competition hosted by American Strategic Air Command (SAC). American interest in the Valiant resulted in a visit to Vickers by USAF generals Vandenberg, Johnson and LeMay. Vickers test-pilot Brian Trubshaw believed that George Edwards was put under some pressure to build the Boeing B-47 under license. The only result from the visit was Le May&#x27;s insistence that the Valiant pilot side-by-side seating be incorporated in the B-52 instead of the tandem arrangement in the B-47 and prototype B-52.

On 11 October 1956, a Valiant B.1 (WZ366) of No. 49 Squadron piloted by Edwin Flavell was the first British aircraft to drop an atomic bomb when it performed a test drop of a down-rated Blue Danube weapon on Maralinga, South Australia. This occurred as part of the Operation Buffalo nuclear tests in that area. Windscreen blinds were fitted in advance of the test to protect the crew from the intense flash of light from the nuclear detonation. Following the landing of the aircraft after deploying the weapon, WZ366 was assessed for potential damage and for radioactive contamination.

On 15 May 1957, a Valiant B(K).1 (XD818) piloted by Kenneth Hubbard dropped the first British hydrogen bomb, the Short Granite, over the Pacific as part of Operation Grapple. No 49 Squadron was selected to perform the live weapon drop, and were equipped with specially-modified Valiants to conform with the scientific requirements of the tests and other precautionary measures to protect against heat and radiation. However, the measured yield was less than a third of the maximum expected although achieving a thermonuclear explosion.

On 8 November 1957 a British hydrogen bomb detonated with its planned yield in the Grapple X test. The Grapple series of tests continued into 1958, and in April 1958 the Grapple Y bomb exploded with ten times the yield of the original &quot;Short Granite&quot;. Testing was finally terminated in November 1958, when the British government decided it would perform no more air-delivered nuclear tests.

Originally the bombing role was to have been carried out at high altitude, but following the shooting down in 1960 of the Lockheed U-2 flown by Gary Powers by an early Soviet SA-2 Guideline missile, the SAM threat caused bomber squadrons to train for low-level attack as a means of avoiding radar detection when flying within hostile airspace. They were repainted in grey/green camouflage with normal markings, replacing their anti-flash white scheme. By 1963, four Valiant squadrons (49, 148, 207 and 214) had been assigned to SACEUR in the low-level tactical bombing role. By this point, there had been a noticeable decline in flying rates for the type.

===Conventional warfare===

Peacetime practice involved the dropping of small practice bombs on instrumented bombing ranges, and a system of predicted bombing using radio tones to mark the position of the bomb drop over non-range targets, the bomb error being calculated by a ground radar unit and passed either to the crew during flight or to a headquarters for analysis. Use of the Valiant&#x27;s Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and the high quality of assigned crews, who were typically veterans and often had been previously decorated for wartime service, meant a high level of bombing accuracy could be achieved, greater than that of aircraft during the Second World War. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, Valiant crews were able to place practice bombs from an altitude of within a few meters of their assigned target.

In October and November 1956 the Valiant was the first of the V-bombers to see combat, during the Anglo-French-Israeli Suez campaign. During Operation Musketeer, the British military operation in what became known as the Suez Crisis, Valiants operating from the airfield at Luqa on Malta dropped conventional bombs on targets inside Egypt. Egyptian military airfields were the principal target; other targets included communications such as radio stations and transport hubs. On the first night of the operation, six Valiants were dispatched to bomb Cairo West Air Base (which was aborted in flight due to potential risk to US personnel in the vicinity) while six more attacked Almaza Air Base and a further five bombed Kibrit Air Base and Huckstep Barracks.

Although the Egyptians did not oppose the attacks and there were no Valiant combat losses, the results of the raids were reported as disappointing. Although the Valiants dropped a total of of bombs, only three of the seven airfields attacked were seriously damaged. The Egyptian Air Force had been effectively destroyed in a wider series of multinational attacks of which the Valiant bombing missions had been a part. It was the last time RAF V-bombers flew a live combat mission until Avro Vulcans bombed Port Stanley airfield in the Falkland Islands during the Falklands War in 1982.

===Tanker operations===
Valiant tankers were flown by No. 214 Squadron at RAF Marham, operational in 1958, and No. 90 Squadron at Honington, operational in 1959. The two squadrons became dedicated tanker squadrons on 1 April 1962. Aircraft assigned to the tanker role were fitted with a Hose Drum Unit (HDU or &quot;HooDoo&quot;) in the bomb bay. The HDU was mounted on bomb-mounting points and could be removed if necessary; this arrangement meant that the bomb bay doors had to be opened in order to transfer fuel to a receiver aircraft. A control panel at the radar navigator station in the cockpit was used to operate the HDU. The HDU equipment was removable so that the aircraft could be reverted to the bomber role if required.

Long-range demonstration flights were made with in-flight refuelling by other Valiant tankers that had been positioned at airfields along the route. In 1960, a Valiant bomber flew non-stop from Marham in the UK to Singapore and in 1961 a Vulcan flew non-stop from the UK to Australia. The two tanker squadrons regularly made long range flights. These included non-stop flights from the UK to Nairobi, RAF Gan and Singapore. Other aircraft refuelled by Valiants at this time included Victor and Vulcan bombers, English Electric Lightning fighters, and de Havilland Sea Vixen and Supermarine Scimitar fighters of the Royal Navy.

===Countermeasures and reconnaissance roles===
Valiants of No. 18 Squadron RAF at RAF Finningley were modified to the &quot;radio countermeasures&quot; (RCM) role—now called &quot;electronic countermeasures&quot; (ECM). These aircraft were ultimately fitted with American APT-16A and ALT-7 jamming transmitters, Airborne Cigar and Carpet jammers, APR-4 and APR-9 &quot;sniffing&quot; receivers, and chaff dispensers. At least seven Valiants were configured to the RCM role.

Valiants of No. 543 Squadron at RAF Wyton were modified to serve in the photographic reconnaissance role. In one notable operation in 1965, Valiants of No. 543 Squadron photographed around of Rhodesia across an 11-week period.

===Fatigue failures and retirement===
In 1956, Vickers had performed a series of low level tests in WZ383 to assess the type for low level flight at high speed. Several modifications to the aircraft were made, including a metal radome, debris guards on the two inboard engines, and after six flights the aileron and elevator artificial feel was reduced by 50%. Pilots reported problems with cabin heating and condensation that would need remedying. The aircraft was fitted with data recording equipment and these data were used by Vickers to estimate the remaining safe life of the type under these flying conditions. Initially a safe life of 75 hours was recommended, which became &quot;the real figure might be less than 200 hours&quot;. The number of hours flown by each Valiant in a year was an operational issue for the RAF.
Later the RAE ran a similar series of tests that more closely resembled actual operational conditions including low level and taxiing; the corresponding report published in 1958 produced data that could be used to get a better grasp on which flight conditions produced the most damage, and enable a better projection of the future life span for the type.

In May 1957 &quot;Flight&quot; reported an &quot;incident at Boscombe Down, when the wing rear spar cracked after a rocket-assisted takeoff at overload weight (the reason for the rocket-assistance)&quot; This aircraft was the second prototype WB 215 and had not been modified with the production fix for the known weakness in the rear spar; the aircraft was subsequently broken up for wing fatigue testing after it had flown 489 hours.

After years of front-line service, in July 1964, a cracked spar was found in one of the three Valiants (either WZ394 – Wynne, or WZ389 – Morgan) on Operation Pontifex. This was followed on 6 August by a failure of the starboard wing rear spar at 30,000 ft, in WP217, an OCU aircraft from Gaydon captained by Flight Lieutenant &quot;Taffy&quot; Foreman. The aircraft landed back at Gaydon but without flap deployment because damage to the starboard rear spar caused the flap rollers to come out of their guides so that the flap would not lower on that side. Later inspection of the aircraft also showed the fuselage skin below the starboard inner plane had buckled, popping the rivets; the engine door had cracked and the rivets had been pulled and the skin buckled on the top surface of the mainplane between the two engines. Both of these aircraft were PR variants.

Inspections of the entire fleet showed that the wing spars were suffering from fatigue at between 35% and 75% of the assessed safe fatigue life, probably due to low level turbulence. After this inspection, the aircraft were divided into three categories, Cat A aircraft continuing to fly, Cat B to fly to a repair base, and Cat C requiring repair before flying again. The tanker squadrons had the highest proportion of Cat A aircraft because their role had been mainly at high level. This also caused the methods of assessing fatigue lives to be reviewed. By the time the type was scrapped, only about 50 aircraft were still in service; the rest had been slowly accumulating at various RAF Maintenance Units designated as &quot;Non effective Aircraft&quot;.

Initially there was no question of retiring the type, or even a majority of affected aircraft. Repairs were actively taking place at Valiant bases such as Marham using working parties from Vickers plus RAF technicians from the base. In January 1965, the Wilson government with Denis Healey as Secretary of State for Defence decided that the expense of the repairs could not be justified, given the short operational life left to the Valiant, and the fleet was permanently grounded as of 26 January 1965. The QRA alert that had been in place for SACEUR was maintained until the final grounding. When asked to make a statement regarding the Valiant&#x27;s scrapping in the House of Commons, Denis Healey stated that it &quot;was not in any way connected with low-level flying&quot; and that the &quot;last Government took the decision to continue operating the Valiant force for another four years after its planned fatigue life was complete&quot;.

Aviation author Barry Jones commented in his book that: &quot;A question has to be asked. For two years before the demise of the Valiant, Handley Page at Radlett had 100 Hastings go through their shops. They were completely dismantled and rebuilt, having DTD683 components removed and replaced by new alloy sections. What was so special about the Hastings and why was the Valiant not treated similarly? Perhaps we will know one day – but I doubt it.&quot; A &quot;Flight&quot; report about the scrapping states &quot;Fatigue affected all Valiants ... not only those that had been used for some low flying&quot;.

On 9 December 1964, the last Valiant tanker sortie in XD812 of 214 Squadron was refuelling Lightning aircraft over the North Sea and was recalled to land back at Marham before the scheduled exercise was completed. On the same day, the last Valiant bomber sortie was carried out by XD818.

==Variants==
Including the three prototypes, a total of 107 Valiants were built.
* Valiant B.1: 37 pure bomber variants, including five pre-production Type 600, Type 667 and Type 674s, which were powered by Avon RA.14 engines with the same thrust each as the earlier Avon 201 and 34 Type 706 full-production aircraft, powered by Avon RA.28, 204 or 205 engines with thrust each, longer tailpipes and water-methanol injection for takeoff boost power.
* Type 710 Valiant B(PR).1: eleven bomber/photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Edwards and his team had considered use of the Valiant for photo-reconnaissance from the start, and this particular type of aircraft could accommodate a removable &quot;crate&quot; in the bomb-bay, carrying up to eight narrow-view/high resolution cameras and four survey cameras.
* Type 733 Valiant B(PR)K.1: 14 bomber/photo-reconnaissance/tanker aircraft.
* Type 758 Valiant B(K).1: 44 bomber / tanker aircraft. Both tanker variants carried a removable tanker system in the bomb bay, featuring fuel tanks and a hose-and-drogue aerial refuelling system. A further 16 Valiant B(K).1s were ordered, but cancelled.
* Valiant B.2: 1 prototype.
* Vickers also considered an air transport version of the Valiant, with a low-mounted wing, wingspan increased from to , fuselage lengthened to , and uprated engines. Work on a prototype, designated the Type 1000, began in early 1953. The prototype was to lead to a military transport version, the Type 1002, and a civilian transport version, the Type 1004 or VC.7. The Type 1000 prototype was almost complete when it, too, was cancelled.
Valiant production ended in August 1957. An order for 17 B.2 models was cancelled.
