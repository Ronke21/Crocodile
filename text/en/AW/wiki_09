<text>In early December 1936, a constitutional crisis in the British Empire arose when King Edward VIII proposed to marry Wallis Simpson, an American socialite who was divorced from her first husband and was in the process of divorcing her second.

The marriage was opposed by the governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth. Religious, legal, political, and moral objections were raised. As the British monarch, Edward was the nominal head of the Church of England, which at this time did not allow divorced people to remarry in church if their ex-spouses were still alive. For this reason, it was widely believed that Edward could not marry Simpson and remain on the throne. As a twice-divorced woman, Simpson was perceived to be politically, morally and socially unsuitable as a prospective queen consort. It was widely assumed by the Establishment that she was driven by love of money or position rather than love for the King. Despite the opposition, Edward declared that he loved Simpson and intended to marry her as soon as her second divorce was finalised.

The widespread unwillingness to accept Simpson as the King&#x27;s consort and Edward&#x27;s refusal to give her up led to his abdication in December 1936. He was succeeded by his brother Albert, who became George VI. Edward was given the title of Duke of Windsor, and styled Royal Highness, following his abdication, and he married Simpson the following year. They remained married until his death 35 years later.

==Prelude==
Edward had been introduced to Wallis Simpson, an American citizen and wife of British shipping executive Ernest Aldrich Simpson, by Lady Furness on 10 January 1931, when Edward was Prince of Wales. Ernest Simpson was Wallis&#x27;s second husband; her first marriage, to U.S. Navy pilot Win Spencer, had ended in divorce in 1927. It is generally accepted that Wallis Simpson and Edward became lovers in 1934, while Lady Furness (who was also in a relationship with the prince) was visiting relatives in the United States. However, Edward adamantly insisted to his father, King George V, that he was not physically intimate with Simpson and that it was inappropriate to describe her as his mistress. Edward&#x27;s relationship with Simpson further weakened his poor relationship with his parents. Although King George V and Queen Mary met Simpson at Buckingham Palace in 1935, they later refused to receive her. Edward and Simpson were secretly followed by members of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch, who produced reports on the nature of their relationship and their investigations into Wallis Simpson&#x27;s private life that included the &quot;pursuit of vicious gossip&quot; and the identification of a &quot;secret lover&quot;. The prospect of having an American divorcée with a questionable past having such sway over the heir apparent led to anxiety among government and establishment figures.

Edward VIII succeeded his father on 20 January 1936, after which Simpson attended more official functions as the King&#x27;s guest. Despite her name appearing regularly in the Court Circular, the name of her husband was conspicuously absent. In the summer of that year, the King eschewed the traditional prolonged stay at Balmoral in favour of a holiday with Simpson in the eastern Mediterranean that was widely covered in the American and continental European press, but not by the British press, which maintained a self-imposed silence. Nevertheless, Canadians and expatriate Britons, who had access to the foreign reports, were largely scandalised by the coverage.

By October, it was rumoured in high society and abroad that Edward intended to marry Simpson as soon as she was free to do so. At the end of that month, the crisis came to a head when she filed for divorce and the American press announced that marriage between her and the King was imminent. The King&#x27;s private secretary, Alec Hardinge, wrote to him on 13 November, warning: &quot;The silence in the British Press on the subject of Your Majesty&#x27;s friendship with Mrs Simpson is not going to be maintained ... Judging by the letters from British subjects living in foreign countries where the Press has been outspoken, the effect will be calamitous.&quot; Senior British ministers knew that Hardinge had written to the King and may have helped him draft the letter.

The King invited Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace the following Monday (16 November) and informed him that he intended to marry Simpson. Baldwin replied that such a marriage would not be acceptable to the people, stating: &quot;... the Queen becomes the Queen of the country. Therefore in the choice of a Queen the voice of the people must be heard&quot;. Baldwin&#x27;s view was shared by the Australian High Commissioner in London, Stanley Bruce, who was also a former prime minister of Australia. On the same day that Hardinge wrote to the King, Bruce met Hardinge and then wrote to Baldwin, expressing horror at the idea of a marriage between the King and Simpson.

Nevertheless, the British press remained quiet on the subject until Alfred Blunt, Bishop of Bradford, gave a speech to his diocesan conference on 1 December, which alluded to the King&#x27;s need of divine grace: &quot;We hope that he is aware of his need. Some of us wish that he gave more positive signs of his awareness.&quot; The press took this for the first public comment by a notable person on the crisis and it became front-page news on 3 December. When asked about it later, however, the bishop claimed he had not heard of Simpson at the time he wrote the speech, and that it was an expression of disappointment at the King&#x27;s conspicuous failure to attend church services regularly. Acting on the advice of Edward&#x27;s staff, Simpson left Britain for the south of France two days later in an attempt to escape intense press attention. Both she and the King were devastated by the separation. At a tearful departure, the King told her, &quot;I shall never give you up.&quot;

==Opposition==
Opposition to the King and his marriage came from several directions. Edward&#x27;s desire to modernise the monarchy and make it more accessible, though appreciated by many of the public, was distrusted by the British Establishment. Edward upset the aristocracy by treating their traditions and ceremonies with disdain, and many were offended by his abandonment of accepted social norms and mores.

===Social and moral===
Government ministers and the royal family found Wallis Simpson&#x27;s background and behaviour unacceptable for a potential queen. Rumours and innuendo about her circulated in society. The King&#x27;s mother, Queen Mary, was even told that Simpson might have held some sort of sexual control over Edward, as she had released him from an undefined sexual dysfunction through practices learnt in a Chinese brothel. This view was partially shared by Alan Don, Chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who wrote that he suspected the King &quot;is sexually abnormal which may account for the hold Mrs S. has over him&quot;. Even Edward VIII&#x27;s official biographer, Philip Ziegler, noted that: &quot;There must have been some sort of sadomasochistic relationship ... [Edward] relished the contempt and bullying she bestowed on him.&quot;

Police detectives following Simpson reported back that, while involved with Edward, she was also involved with a married car mechanic and salesman named Guy Trundle. This may well have been passed on to senior figures in the establishment, including members of the royal family. Joseph Kennedy, the American ambassador, described her as a &quot;tart&quot;, and his wife, Rose, refused to dine with her.

Wallis was perceived to be pursuing Edward for his money; his equerry wrote that she would eventually leave him, &quot;having secured the cash&quot;. The future prime minister Neville Chamberlain (then Chancellor of the Exchequer) wrote in his diary that she was &quot;an entirely unscrupulous woman who is not in love with the King but is exploiting him for her own purposes. She has already ruined him in money and jewels ...&quot;

Relations between the United Kingdom and the United States were strained during the inter-war years and the majority of Britons were reluctant to accept an American as queen consort. At the time, some members of the British upper class looked down on Americans with disdain and considered them socially inferior. In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.

===Religious and legal===
In Edward&#x27;s lifetime, the Church of England forbade the remarriage of divorced people in church while a former spouse was still living. The monarch was required by law to be in communion with the Church of England, and was its nominal head or Supreme Governor. In 1935 the Church of England reaffirmed that, &quot;in no circumstances can Christian men or women re-marry during the lifetime of a wife or a husband&quot;. The archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang, held that the king, as the head of the Church of England, could not marry a divorcée. If Edward married Wallis Simpson, a divorcée who would soon have two living ex-husbands, in a civil ceremony, it would directly conflict with Church teaching and his role as the Church&#x27;s &quot;ex officio&quot; head.

Wallis&#x27;s first divorce (in the United States on the grounds of &quot;emotional incompatibility&quot;) was not recognised by the Church of England and, if challenged in the English courts, might not have been recognised under English law. At that time, the Church and English law considered adultery to be the only grounds for divorce. Consequently, under this argument, her second marriage, as well as her marriage to Edward, would be considered bigamous and invalid. The Matrimonial Causes Act 1937, which was passed shortly after Edward and Wallis&#x27;s marriage, would allow for numerous other grounds for divorce.

===Political===
When Edward visited depressed mining villages in Wales, his comment that &quot;something must be done&quot; led to concerns among elected politicians that he would interfere in political matters, traditionally avoided by constitutional monarchs. Ramsay MacDonald, Lord President of the Council, wrote of the King&#x27;s comments: &quot;These escapades should be limited. They are an invasion into the field of politics and should be watched constitutionally.&quot; Although Edward&#x27;s comments had made him popular in Wales, he became extremely unpopular with the public in Scotland following his refusal to open a new wing of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, saying he could not do so because he was in mourning for his father and delegated the task to his brother Albert despite the logical inconsistency in doing so since both men shared the same father, George V. The day after the opening, he was pictured in newspapers on holiday: he had turned down the public event in favour of meeting Simpson.

As Prince of Wales, Edward had publicly referred to Labour county councillors as &quot;cranks&quot; and made speeches counter to government policy. During his reign as king, his refusal to accept the advice of ministers continued: he opposed the imposition of sanctions on Italy after its invasion of Ethiopia, refused to receive the deposed Emperor of Ethiopia, and would not support a strengthening of the League of Nations.

Members of the British government became further dismayed by the proposed marriage after being told that Wallis Simpson was an agent of Nazi Germany. The Foreign Office obtained leaked dispatches from the German Reich&#x27;s Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Joachim von Ribbentrop, which revealed his strong view that opposition to the marriage was motivated by the wish &quot;to defeat those Germanophile forces which had been working through Mrs Simpson&quot;. It was rumoured that Simpson had access to confidential government papers sent to Edward, which he left unguarded at his Fort Belvedere residence. While Edward was abdicating, the personal protection officers guarding Simpson in exile in France sent reports to Downing Street suggesting that she might &quot;flit to Germany&quot;.

==Options considered==
As a result of these rumours and arguments, the belief strengthened among the British establishment that Simpson could not become a royal consort. The British prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, explicitly advised Edward that the majority of people would be opposed to his marrying Simpson, indicating that if he did, in direct contravention of his ministers&#x27; advice, the government would resign &quot;en masse&quot;. The King responded, according to his own later account, &quot;I intend to marry Mrs Simpson as soon as she is free to marry ... if the Government opposed the marriage, as the Prime Minister had given me reason to believe it would, &quot;then I was prepared to go&quot;.&quot; Under pressure from the King, and &quot;startled&quot; at the suggested abdication, Baldwin agreed to take further soundings on three options:

# Edward and Simpson marry and she become queen (a royal marriage);
# Edward and Simpson marry, but she not become queen, instead receiving some courtesy title (a morganatic marriage); or
# Abdication for Edward and any potential heirs he might father, allowing him to make any marital decisions without further constitutional implications.

The second option had European precedents, including Edward&#x27;s own great-grandfather, Duke Alexander of Württemberg, but it had no parallel in British constitutional history. The prime ministers of the five Dominions (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Irish Free State) were consulted, and the majority agreed that there was &quot;no alternative to course (3)&quot;. William Lyon Mackenzie King (Prime Minister of Canada), Joseph Lyons (Prime Minister of Australia), and J. B. M. Hertzog (Prime Minister of South Africa) opposed options 1 and 2. Mackenzie King told Edward to do &quot;what he believed in his own heart was right&quot; and the Canadian government appealed to the King to put his duty before his feelings for Simpson. Governor General of Canada Lord Tweedsmuir told Buckingham Palace and Baldwin that Canadians held deep affection for the King, but also that Canadian public opinion would be outraged if Edward married a divorcée. Michael Joseph Savage (Prime Minister of New Zealand) rejected option 1 and thought that option 2 &quot;might be possible ... if some solution along these lines were found to be practicable&quot;, but &quot;would be guided by the decision of the Home government&quot;. In communications with the British government, Éamon de Valera (President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State) remarked that as a Roman Catholic country, the Irish Free State did not recognise divorce. He supposed that if the British people would not accept Wallis Simpson then abdication was the only possible solution. On 24 November, Baldwin consulted the three leading opposition politicians in Britain: Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee, Liberal leader Sir Archibald Sinclair, and Winston Churchill. Sinclair and Attlee agreed that options 1 and 2 were unacceptable, and Churchill pledged to support the government.

Churchill did not support the government, however. In July, he had advised the King&#x27;s legal counsel, Walter Monckton, against the divorce, but his advice was ignored. As soon as the affair became public knowledge, Churchill started to pressure Baldwin and the King to delay any decisions until parliament and the people had been consulted. In a private letter to Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, Churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because, given time, the King might fall out of love with Simpson. Baldwin rejected the request for delay, presumably because he preferred to resolve the crisis quickly. Supporters of the King alleged a conspiracy between Baldwin, Geoffrey Dawson, and Cosmo Gordon Lang, the archbishop of Canterbury. The royal physician Bertrand Dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease, but he eventually accepted, on the evidence of an early electrocardiograph, that Baldwin&#x27;s heart was sound.

Political support for the King was scattered and comprised politicians alienated from the mainstream parties such as Churchill, Oswald Mosley (leader of the British Union of Fascists), and Harry Pollitt and Walton Newbold of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Former prime minister David Lloyd George also supported the King despite disliking Simpson. He was, however, unable to take any active role in the crisis because he was on holiday in Jamaica with his mistress Frances Stevenson. In early December, rumours circulated that the King&#x27;s supporters would join in a &quot;King&#x27;s Party&quot;, led by Churchill. However, there was no concerted effort to form an organised movement and Churchill had no intention of leading one. Nevertheless, the rumours damaged the King and Churchill severely, as members of parliament were horrified at the idea of the King interfering in politics.

The letters and diaries of working-class people and ex-servicemen generally demonstrate support for the King, while those from the middle and upper classes tend to express indignation and distaste. &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, and newspapers owned by Lord Kemsley, such as &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, opposed the marriage. On the other hand, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, owned by Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere, respectively, appeared to support a morganatic marriage. The King estimated that the newspapers in favour had a circulation of 12.5 million, and those against had 8.5 million.

On 3 December, Edward had a &quot;tense&quot; meeting with Baldwin. Backed by Churchill and Beaverbrook, Edward proposed to broadcast a speech via the BBC. The proposed text invoked the &quot;ancient custom&quot; for a King to &quot;address his public utterances to his people&quot;. Edward proposed to remind his listeners: &quot;I am still the same man whose motto was &#x27;Ich Dien&#x27;, I serve.&quot; In the proposed speech, Edward indicated his desire to remain on the throne or to be recalled to it if forced to abdicate, while marrying Simpson morganatically. In one section, Edward proposed to say:

Baldwin blocked the speech, saying that it would shock many people and would be a grave breach of constitutional principles. By modern convention, the sovereign could only act with the advice and counsel of ministers. In seeking the people&#x27;s support against the government, Edward was opting to oppose binding ministerial advice and instead act as a private individual. Edward&#x27;s British ministers felt that, in proposing the speech, Edward had revealed his disdainful attitude towards constitutional conventions and threatened the political neutrality of the Crown.

Cabinet Office files released in 2013 show that on or before 5 December 1936, the Home Secretary, Sir John Simon, had ordered the General Post Office (which controlled British telephone services) to intercept &quot;telephone communications between Fort Belvedere and Buckingham Palace on the one hand and the continent of Europe on the other&quot;.

On 5 December, having in effect been told that he could not keep the throne and marry Simpson, and having had his request to broadcast to the Empire to explain &quot;his side of the story&quot; blocked on constitutional grounds, Edward chose the third option.

==Legal manoeuvres==
Following Simpson&#x27;s divorce hearing on 27 October 1936, her solicitor, John Theodore Goddard, became concerned that there would be a &quot;patriotic&quot; citizen&#x27;s intervention (a legal device to block the divorce), and that such an intervention would be successful. The courts could not grant a collaborative divorce (a dissolution of marriage consented to by both parties), and so the case was being handled as if it were an undefended at-fault divorce brought against Ernest Simpson, with Wallis Simpson as the innocent, injured party. The divorce action would fail if the citizen&#x27;s intervention showed that the Simpsons had colluded by, for example, conniving in or staging the appearance of his adultery so that she could marry someone else. On Monday 7 December 1936, the King heard that Goddard planned to fly to the south of France to see Wallis Simpson. The King summoned him and expressly forbade him to make the journey, fearing that the visit might put doubts in Simpson&#x27;s mind. Goddard went straight to Downing Street to see Baldwin, as a result of which he was provided with an aeroplane to take him directly to Cannes.

Upon his arrival, Goddard warned his client that a citizen&#x27;s intervention, should it arise, was likely to succeed. It was, according to Goddard, his duty to advise her to withdraw her divorce petition. Simpson refused, but they both telephoned the King to inform him that she was willing to give him up so that he could remain king. It was, however, too late; the King had already made up his mind to go, even if he could not marry Simpson. Indeed, as the belief that the abdication was inevitable gathered strength, Goddard stated that: &quot;[his] client was ready to do anything to ease the situation but the other end of the wicket [Edward VIII] was determined&quot;.

Goddard had a weak heart and had never flown before, so he asked his doctor, William Kirkwood, to accompany him on the trip. As Kirkwood was a resident at a maternity hospital, his presence led to false speculation that Simpson was pregnant, and even that she was having an abortion. The press excitedly reported that the solicitor had flown to Simpson accompanied by a gynaecologist and an anaesthetist (who was actually the lawyer&#x27;s clerk).

==Abdication==

At Fort Belvedere, on 10 December, Edward signed his written abdication notices, witnessed by his three younger brothers: Prince Albert, Duke of York (who succeeded Edward as George VI); Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent. The following day, it was given effect by Act of Parliament: His Majesty&#x27;s Declaration of Abdication Act 1936.

Under changes introduced by the Statute of Westminster in 1931, a single Crown for the entire empire had been replaced by multiple crowns, one for each Dominion, worn by a single monarch in an organisation then-known as the British Commonwealth. Though the British government, hoping for expediency and to avoid embarrassment, wished the Dominions to accept the actions of the &quot;home&quot; government, the Dominions held that Edward&#x27;s abdication required the consent of each Commonwealth state. According to the Statute of Westminster, the act passed by the UK parliament could become law in other Dominions at their request. This was duly given by the Parliament of Australia, which was at the time in session, and by the governments of Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand, whose parliaments were in recess.

Before the crisis had become public, Sir Maurice Gwyer, the British parliamentary counsel and one of the principal framers of the Statute of Westminster, expressed to Attorney-General Donald Somervell on 23 November 1936 the concern that the Irish Free State might refuse to either give its request and consent to British legislation or to pass its own. Legal experts discussed whether an abdication would have force in the Irish Free State, regardless, or if Edward VIII might remain king of that country while George VI reigned elsewhere. In the end, it was the possibility of the latter, and, consequently, Simpson becoming Queen of the Irish Free State, that was used to push the Oireachtas to legislate. The government of the Irish Free State, taking the opportunity presented by the crisis and in a major step towards its eventual transition to a republic, passed an amendment to its constitution on 11 December to remove references to the Crown and abolish the office of Governor-General of the Irish Free State; the King&#x27;s abdication was recognised a day later in the External Relations Act, leading to a 24-hour period wherein Edward was king in the Irish Free State and his brother was king of the UK and other Dominions. In Canada, the Succession to the Throne Act 1937 symbolically confirmed the abdication. South Africa passed His Majesty King Edward the Eighth&#x27;s Abdication Act 1937, which declared that the abdication took effect there on 10 December, meaning abdications took place on three separate dates across the Commonwealth.

Edward&#x27;s supporters felt that he had &quot;been hounded from the throne by that arch humbug Baldwin&quot;, but many members of the establishment were relieved by Edward&#x27;s departure. Mackenzie King wrote in his diary on 8 December 1936 that Edward&#x27;s &quot;sense of right or wrong has been largely obliterated by the jazz of life he has led for years&quot; and, upon receiving news of Edward&#x27;s final decision to abdicate, &quot;if that is the kind of man he is it is better he should not be longer on the Throne.&quot; Edward&#x27;s own Assistant Private Secretary, Alan Lascelles, had told Baldwin as early as 1927: &quot;I can&#x27;t help thinking that the best thing that could happen to him, and to the country, would be for him to break his neck.&quot; Lascelles resigned in 1929 &quot;in despair&quot;.

On 11 December 1936, Edward made a BBC radio broadcast from Windsor Castle; having abdicated, he was introduced by Sir John Reith as &quot;His Royal Highness Prince Edward&quot;. The official address had been polished by Churchill and was moderate in tone, speaking about Edward&#x27;s inability to do his job &quot;as would have wished to do&quot; without the support of &quot;the woman I love&quot;. Edward&#x27;s reign had lasted 327 days, the shortest of any monarch in Britain since the disputed reign of Lady Jane Grey over 380 years earlier. The day following the broadcast he left Britain for Austria.

==Post-abdication==
George VI granted his elder brother the title of Duke of Windsor with the style His Royal Highness on 12 December 1936. On 3 May the following year, the Simpsons&#x27; divorce was made final. The case was handled quietly and it barely featured in some newspapers. &quot;The Times&quot; printed a single sentence below a separate, and seemingly unconnected, report announcing the Duke&#x27;s departure from Austria.

Edward married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937. She became the Duchess of Windsor, but, much to Edward&#x27;s disgust, George VI issued letters patent that denied her the style of Her Royal Highness. The couple settled in France, and the Duke received a tax-free allowance from his brother, which Edward supplemented by writing his memoirs and by illegal currency trading. He also profited from the sale of Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House to George VI, for a &quot;colossal sum&quot; according to Alan Lascelles. Both estates are private property and not part of the Royal Estate, and were therefore inherited and owned by Edward, regardless of the abdication.

In October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Germany, against the advice of the British government, and met Hitler at his Obersalzberg retreat. The visit was much publicised by the German media. During the visit the Duke gave full Nazi salutes. In an article for the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; of 13 December 1966 the Duke wrote that in 1937 Hitler persuaded him &quot;it was in Britain&#x27;s interest and in Europe&#x27;s too, that Germany be encouraged to strike east and smash Communism forever ... I thought the rest of us could be fence-sitters while the Nazis and the Reds slogged it out.&quot;

After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Edward was assigned to the British Military Mission in France. In February 1940, the German ambassador in The Hague, Count Julius von Zech-Burkersroda, claimed that Edward had leaked the Allied war plans for the defence of Belgium. When Germany invaded the north of France in May 1940, the Duke and Duchess fled to Lisbon.

Under the code name Operation Willi, Nazi agents, principally Walter Schellenberg, plotted unsuccessfully to persuade the Duke to leave Portugal, and contemplated kidnapping him. Lord Caldecote warned Churchill that the Duke &quot;is well-known to be pro-Nazi and he may become a centre of intrigue&quot;. Churchill threatened the Duke with a court-martial if he did not return to British soil.

In July 1940, Edward was appointed Governor of the Bahamas. Edward reportedly told an acquaintance, &quot;After the war is over and Hitler will crush the Americans ... we&#x27;ll take over ... They [the British] don&#x27;t want me as their king, but I&#x27;ll be back as their leader.&quot; He was reported as saying that &quot;it would be a tragic thing for the world if Hitler was overthrown&quot;. Comments like these reinforced the belief that the Duke and Duchess held Nazi sympathies and the effect of the abdication crisis of 1936 was to force off the throne a man with extreme political opinions. Claims that Edward would have been a threat or that he was removed by a political conspiracy to dethrone him remain speculative and &quot;persist largely because since 1936 the contemporary public considerations have lost most of their force and so seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation for the King&#x27;s departure&quot;.

<doc id="167337" wikidata="Q347916" url="?curid=167337" title="Demetrius I of Bactria">
<text>Demetrius I Anicetus (, &quot;Demetrius the unconquered&quot;), also called Damaytra was a Greco-Bactrian and later Indo-Greek king (Yona in Pali language, &quot;Yavana&quot; in Sanskrit) (reigned c. 200–167 BC), who ruled areas from Bactria to ancient northwestern India. He was the son of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom&#x27;s ruler Euthydemus I and succeeded him around 200 BC, after which he conquered extensive areas in what is now southern Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan and India.

He was never defeated in battle and was posthumously referred to as &quot;the Unconquered&quot; (&quot;Aniketos&quot;) on the pedigree coins of his successor Agathocles. Demetrius I may have been the initiator of the Yavana era, starting in 186–185 BC, which was used for several centuries thereafter.

&quot;Demetrius&quot; was the name of at least two and probably three Bactrian kings. The much debated Demetrius II was a possible relative, whereas Demetrius III (), is known only from numismatic evidence.

==Encounter with Antiochus III==

The father of Demetrius, Euthydemus, was attacked by the Seleucid ruler Antiochus III around 210 BC. Although he commanded 10,000 horsemen, Euthydemus initially lost a battle on the Arius and had to retreat. He then successfully resisted a three-year siege in the fortified city of Bactra, before Antiochus finally decided to recognize the new ruler.

The final negotiations were made between Antiochus III and Demetrius. Antiochus III was reportedly highly impressed by the demeanour of the young prince, and offered him one of his daughters in marriage, around 206 BC:

:&quot;And after several journeys of Teleas to and fro between the two, Euthydemus at last sent his son Demetrius to confirm the terms of the treaty. Antiochus received the young prince; and judging from his appearance, conversation, and the dignity of his manners that he was worthy of royal power, he first promised to give him one of his own daughters, and secondly conceded the royal title to his father.&quot; Polybius 11.34

The term used for &quot;young prince&quot; is &quot;neaniskos&quot; (νεανίσκος), suggesting an age around 16, which in turn gives a birth date for Demetrius around 222 BC.

===Kuliab inscription===
In an inscription found in the Kuliab area of Tajikistan, in western Greco-Bactria, and dated to 200-195 BC, a Greek by the name of Heliodotos, dedicating a fire altar to Hestia, mentions Euthydemus and Demetrius:
==Invasion of India==

Demetrius started the invasion of northwestern India in 186 BC, following the destruction of the Mauryan dynasty by the general Pushyamitra Shunga, who then founded the new Indian Shunga dynasty (180–78 BC). In the &quot;Paramparapustaka&quot; chronicle, Sri Lankan monks state that Brihadratha, the last Mauryan Emperor, married a daughter of Demetrius, Berenice. The Greco-Bactrians might have invaded the Indus Valley to protect Greek expatriates in the Indian Subcontinent. Also, the Mauryans had had diplomatic alliances with the Greeks, and they may have been considered as allies by the Greco-Bactrians. 

Demetrius may have first started to recover the province of Arachosia, an area south of the Hindu Kush already inhabited by many Greeks but ruled by the Mauryas since the annexation of the territory by Chandragupta from Seleucus. In his &quot;Parthian stations&quot;, Isidorus of Charax mentions a colony named Demetrias, supposedly founded by Demetrius himself:

:&quot;Beyond is Arachosia. And the Parthians call this White India; there are the city of Biyt and the city of Pharsana and the city of Chorochoad and the city of Demetrias; then Alexandropolis, the metropolis of Arachosia; it is Greek, and by it flows the river Arachotus. As far as this place the land is under the rule of the Parthians.&quot; &quot;Parthians stations&quot;, 1st century BC

The Greek campaigns may have gone as far as the capital Pataliputra in eastern India (today Patna):
:&quot;Those who came after Alexander went to the Ganges and Pataliputra&quot; (Strabo, XV.698)

:&quot;The Greeks who caused Bactria to revolt grew so powerful on account of the fertility of the country that they became masters, not only of Ariana, but also of India, as Apollodorus of Artemita says: and more tribes were subdued by them than by Alexander — by Menander in particular (at least if he actually crossed the Hypanis towards the east and advanced as far as the Imaüs), for some were subdued by him personally and others by Demetrius, the son of Euthydemus the king of the Bactrians.&quot; (Strabo 11.11.1)

It is generally considered that Demetrius ruled in Taxila (where many of his coins were found in the archaeological site of Sirkap).
The Indian records also describes Greek attacks on Saketa, Panchala, Mathura and Pataliputra (Gargi-Samhita, Yuga Purana chapter). However, the campaigns to Pataliputra are generally attested to the later king Menander I and Demetrius I probably only invaded areas in Pakistan. Other kings may have expanded the territory as well. By c. 175 BC, the Indo-Greeks ruled parts of northwestern India, while the Shungas remained in the Gangetic, Central, and Eastern India.

The Hathigumpha inscription of the Kalinga king Kharavela mentions that fearing him, a Yavana (Greek) king or general retreated to Mathura with his demoralized army. The name of the Yavana king is not clear, but it contains three letters, and the middle letter can be read as &quot;ma&quot; or &quot;mi&quot;. Some historians, such as R. D. Banerji and K.P. Jayaswal reconstructed the name of the Yavana king as &quot;Dimita&quot;, and identified him with Demetrius. However, several other historians, such as Ramaprasad Chanda, Sailendra Nath Sen and P.L. Gupta disagree with this interpretation.

==Aftermath==

Demetrius I died of unknown reasons, and the date 180 BC is merely a suggestion aimed to allow suitable regnal periods for subsequent kings, of which there were several. Even if some of them were co-regents, civil wars and temporary divisions of the empire are most likely.

The kings Pantaleon, Antimachus, Agathocles and possibly Euthydemus II ruled after Demetrius I, and theories about their origin include all of them being relatives of Demetrius I, or only Antimachus. Eventually, the kingdom of Bactria fell to the able newcomer Eucratides.

Demetrius II was a later king, possibly a son or nephew of his namesake, and he ruled in India only. Justin mentions him being defeated by the Bactrian king Eucratides, an event which took place at the end of the latter&#x27;s reign, possibly around 150 BC.
Demetrius II left behind his generals Apollodotus and Menander, who in turn became kings of India and rulers of the Indo-Greek Kingdom following his death.

According to Ptolemy, a Demetriapolis was founded in Arachosia.

Geoffrey Chaucer names Demetrius among the combatants at a tournament held in Athens by Theseus:
==Coinage==

The coins of Demetrius are of five types. One bilingual type with Greek and Kharoshthi legends exists; it is naturally associated with the Indian Demetrius II. A series with the king in diadem are likely to be early issues of Demetrius I.

There is also one series representing a Gorgon shield on the obverse and a trident on the reverse.
There are also three types depicting elephants. The first type shows Demetrius (I) with elephant-crown, a well-known symbol of India, which simply denotes his conquests in India, as Alexander the Great had also done on his coinage before. One type represents an elephant with Nike on the other side holding a wreath of victory. This sort of symbolism can be seen on the reverse of the coins of Antialcidas in which Nike (supported by Zeus) directly hands the victory wreath to the elephant on the same coin face.
===Indian coinage in Gandhara (after 185 BC)===

The year 186 BC, with the invasion of the Greco-Bactrians into India, marks an evolution in the design of single-die cast coins in the coinage of Gandhara, as deities and realistic animals were introduced. At the same time coinage technology also evolved, as double-die coins (engraved on both sides, obverse and reverse) started to appear. The archaeological excavations of coins have shown that these coins, as well as the new double die coins, were contemporary with those of the Indo-Greeks. According to Osmund Bopearachchi these coins, and particularly those depicting the goddess Lakshmi, were probably minted by Demetrius I following his invasion of Gandhara.
==Buddhism==
Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek kings, and it has been suggested by W. W. Tarn that their invasion of India was intended to show their support for the Mauryan empire in reaction to the persecution by the Sungas against Buddhism. However, that persecution in turn is debatable, with contemporary historians such as Romila Thapar suggesting that some of the accounts might be the product of exaggeration from Buddhist missionaries. Thapar attributes purely economic motivations to the Indo-Greek invasion of Southern Asia.

===Elephant with the caduceus coinage===

One of Demetrius&#x27; &quot;elephant&quot; types represents a rejoicing elephant, depicted on the front on the coin and surrounded by the royal bead-and-reel decoration, and therefore treated on the same level as a King. The elephant, one of the symbols of Buddhism and Gautama Buddha, possibly represents the victory of Buddhism brought about by Demetrius. Alternatively, though, the elephant has been described as a possible symbol of the Indian capital of Taxila (Tarn), or as a symbol of India as a whole.

The reverse of the coin depicts the caduceus, symbol of reconciliation between two fighting serpents, which is possibly a representation of peace between the Greeks and the Shungas, and likewise between Buddhism and Hinduism (the caduceus also appears as a symbol of the punch-marked coins of the Maurya Empire in India, in the 3rd-2nd century BC).

Unambiguous Buddhist symbols are found on later Greek coins of Menander I or Menander II, but the conquests of Demetrius I did influence the Buddhist religion in India.

<text>A head transplant or full body transplant is an experimental surgical operation involving the grafting of one organism&#x27;s head onto the body of another. In many experiments, the recipient&#x27;s head has not been removed, but in others it has been. Experimentation in animals began in the early 1900s. , no lasting successes have been achieved.

==Medical challenges==
There are three main technical challenges. As with any organ transplant, managing the immune response to avoid transplant rejection is necessary. Also, the brain is highly dependent on continuous flow of blood to provide oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products, with damage setting in quickly at normal temperatures when blood flow is cut off. Finally, managing the nervous systems in both the body and the head is essential, in several ways. The autonomic nervous system controls essential functions like breathing and the heart beating and is governed largely by the brain stem; if the recipient body&#x27;s head is removed this can no longer function. Additionally each nerve coming out of the head via the spinal cord needs to be connected to the putatively corresponding nerve in the recipient body&#x27;s spinal cord in order for the brain to control movement and receive sensory information. Finally, the risk of systematic neuropathic pain is high and had largely been unaddressed in research.

Of these challenges, dealing with blood supply and transplant rejection have been addressed in the field of transplant medicine generally, making transplantation of several types of organs fairly routine; however, in a field as common as liver transplantation around a quarter of organs are rejected within the first year and overall mortality is still much higher than the general population. The challenge of grafting the nervous system remained in early stages of research .

==History==
Alexis Carrel was a French surgeon who had developed improved surgical methods to connect blood vessels in the context of organ transplantation. In 1908, he collaborated with the American Charles Claude Guthrie to attempt to graft the head of one dog on an intact second dog; the grafted head showed some reflexes early on but deteriorated quickly and the animal was killed after a few hours. Carrel&#x27;s work on organ transplantation later earned a Nobel Prize; Guthrie was probably excluded because of this controversial work on head transplantation.

In 1954, Vladimir Demikhov, a Soviet surgeon who had done important work to improve coronary bypass surgery, performed an experiment in which he grafted a dog&#x27;s head and upper body including the front legs, onto another dog; the effort was focused on how to provide blood supply to the donor head and upper body and not on grafting the nervous systems. The dogs generally survived a few days; one survived 29 days. The grafted body parts were able to move and react to stimulus. The animals died due to transplant rejection.

In the 1950s and &#x27;60s, immunosuppressive drugs and organ transplantation techniques were developed that eventually made transplantation of kidneys, livers, and other organs standard medical procedures.

In 1965, Robert J. White did a series of experiments in which he attempted to graft only the vascular system of isolated dog brains onto existing dogs, to learn how to manage this challenge. He monitored brain activity with EEG and also monitored metabolism, and showed that he could maintain high levels of brain activity and metabolism by avoiding any break in the blood supply. The animals survived between 6 hours and 2 days. In 1970, he did four experiments in which he cut the head off of a monkey and connected the blood vessels of another monkey head to it; he did not attempt to connect the nervous systems. White used deep hypothermia to protect the brains during the times when they were cut off from blood during procedure. The recipient bodies had to be kept alive with mechanical ventilation and drugs to stimulate the heart. The grafted heads were able to function - the eyes tracked moving objects and it could chew and swallow. There were problems with the grafting of blood vessels that led to blood clots forming, and White used high doses of immunosuppressive drugs that had severe side effects; the animals died between 6 hours and 3 days after the heads were engrafted. These experiments were reported and criticized in the media and were considered barbaric by animal rights activists. There were few animal experiments on head transplantation for many years after this.

In 2012, Xiaoping Ren published work in which he grafted the head of a mouse onto another mouse&#x27;s body; again the focus was on how to avoid harm from the loss of blood supply; with his protocol the grafted heads survived up to six months.

In 2013, Sergio Canavero published a protocol that he said would make human head transplantation possible. In 2016, he announced his plans to do the procedure on Valeriy Spiridonov, a disabled Russian software engineer suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, who volunteered for the surgery. Canavero claimed that there is a 90% chance of success. However, Spiridonov later cancelled his participation after getting married and having his first child.

In 2015, Ren published work in which he cut off the heads of mice but left the brain stem in place, and then connected the vasculature of the donor head to the recipient body; this work was an effort to address whether it was possible to keep the body of the recipient animal alive without life support. All prior experimental work that involved removing the recipient body&#x27;s head had cut the head off lower down, just below the second bone in the spinal column. Ren also used moderate hypothermia to protect the brains during the procedure.

In 2016, Ren and Canavero published a review of attempted as well as possible neuroprotection strategies that they said should be researched for potential use in a head transplantation procedure; they discussed various protocols for connecting the vasculature, the use of various levels of hypothermia, the use of blood substitutes, and the possibility of using hydrogen sulfide as a neuroprotective agent.

==Ethics and popular opinion==
Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist, has written &quot;Head transplants are fake news. Those who promote such claims and who would subject any human being to unproven cruel surgery merit not headlines but only contempt and condemnation.&quot;

Robert J. White became a target for protestors because of his head transplantation experiments. One interrupted a banquet in his honor by offering him a bloody replica of a human head. Others called his house asking for &quot;Dr. Butcher&quot;. When White testified in a civil hearing about Sam Sheppard&#x27;s murder case, lawyer Terry Gilbert compared White to Dr. Frankenstein. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals described White&#x27;s experiments as &quot;epitomizing the crude, cruel vivisection industry&quot;.

In general, the field of transplantation medicine has been met with resistance and alarm from some quarters as advances have been made; Joseph Murray, who performed the first kidney transplant in 1954, was described as doing something unnatural or as playing God. These continued as other organs were transplanted, but perhaps became sharpest as hand transplants and face transplants emerged in 1998 and 2005 respectively, as each of these are visible, personal, and social in ways that internal organs are not. The medical ethics of each of these procedures was extensively discussed and worked out before clinical experimental and regular usage began.

With regard to head transplantation, there had been little formal ethical discussion published in the literature and little dialogue among stakeholders ; the plans of Canavero were well ahead of society&#x27;s and the medical establishment&#x27;s readiness or acceptance. There was no accepted protocol for conducting the procedure to justify the risk to the people involved, methods of obtaining informed consent were unclear, especially for the person whose body would be used; issues of desperation render the truly informed consent of a head donor questionable. With regard to societal costs, the body of a person willing to be an organ donor can save the lives of many people, and , the supply of tissues and organs from people willing to be organ donors did not meet the medical need of recipients; the notion of an entire donor body going to one other person was difficult to justify at that time. Basic legal issues were also unclear with regard to whether only one or both of the people involved in a head transplantation would have any legal rights in the post-procedure person.

The most appropriate initial form of the procedure was also unclear . Because grafting the head onto the spinal cord was not possible at that time, the only feasible procedure would be one where the head was only connected to the blood supply of the donor body, leaving the person completely paralyzed, with the accompanying limited quality of life and high societal cost to maintain.

The psychological results of the procedure were unclear as well. While concerns were raised about whether recipients of a face transplant and their social circle would have difficulty adjusting, studies had found that disruptions had been minimal. But no transplant had ever been performed where the entire body of an individual is unfamiliar at the conclusion of the procedure, and one of the few documents discussing the ethics in the biomedical literature, a letter to the editor of a journal published in 2015 foresaw a high risk of insanity as a result of the procedure.

Popular opinion about Canavero&#x27;s plans for head transplantation has been generally negative . Many of these criticisms focus on the state of technology and the timeframe in which Canavero says he will be able to successfully conduct the procedure.

<text>Alan Eugene Jackson (born October 17, 1958) is an American country music singer-songwriter. He is known for performing a style widely regarded as &quot;neotraditional country&quot;, as well as writing many of his own songs. Jackson has recorded 21 studio albums, including two Christmas albums, and two gospel albums, as well as three greatest-hits albums.

Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold over 75 million records worldwide, with 44 million sold in the United States alone. He has had 66 songs appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart; of the 66 titles, and six featured singles, 38 have reached the top five and 35 have claimed the number one spot. Out of 15 titles to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart, nine have been certified multi-platinum. He is the recipient of two Grammy Awards, 16 CMA Awards, 17 ACM Awards and nominee of multiple other awards. He is a member of the Grand Ole Opry, and was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2001. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2017 by Loretta Lynn and into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Early life==
Jackson was born to Joseph Eugene &quot;Daddy Gene&quot; Jackson (1927–2000) and Ruth Musick &quot;Mama Ruth&quot; Jackson (1930–2017) in Newnan, Georgia, and has four older sisters. He and his immediate family lived in a small home built around his grandfather&#x27;s old toolshed. The family is primarily of English descent. His mother lived in the home until her death on January 7, 2017. He began writing music in 1983.

Growing up, Jackson listened primarily to gospel music, until a friend introduced him to Gene Watson, John Anderson, and Hank Williams Jr. Jackson attended the local Elm Street Elementary and Newnan High School, and joined the band Dixie Steel after graduation. Jackson worked as a construction worker and forklift operator while playing in small clubs across Georgia. When he was 27, Jackson and his wife of six years, Denise, moved from Newnan to Nashville, Tennessee, where he hoped to pursue music full-time. In 1987, Jackson cut a pre-debut demo album titled &quot;New Traditional&quot; at Doc&#x27;s Place in Hendersonville, Tennessee, but it is extremely rare and was released only in Japan.

==Career==

In Tennessee, Jackson got his first job in The Nashville Network&#x27;s mailroom and would sit in the audience during tapings of TNN’s &quot;You Can Be a Star,&quot; a television singing competition featuring celebrity judges. On an episode in 1986, then 27-year-old Jackson was plucked from the audience and asked to sing a song as an outro to a commercial break. Jackson sang He Stopped Loving Her Today by George Jones, earning a round of applause from the audience, and the attention of guest judge and singer-songwriter Keith Stegall. Stegall would eventually produce 19 of Jackson’s studio albums. 

Around this time, Jackson’s wife Denise, a flight attendant, encountered Glen Campbell on a flight, and requested advice for her husband. Campbell handed her the business card of his manager and told her to call, which further helped jumpstart his career. Jackson eventually signed with Arista, and in 1989, he became the first artist signed to the newly formed Arista Nashville branch of Arista Records. Arista released Jackson&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Blue Blooded Woman&quot;, in late 1989. Although the song failed to reach top 40 on Hot Country Songs, he reached number three by early 1990 with &quot;Here in the Real World&quot;. This song served as the title track to his debut studio album, &quot;Here in the Real World&quot;, which also included two more top five hits (&quot;Wanted&quot; and &quot;Chasin&#x27; That Neon Rainbow&quot;) and his first number one, &quot;I&#x27;d Love You All Over Again&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Rock the Jukebox&quot; was the title of Jackson&#x27;s second album. Released in 1991, it included four number-one singles: the title track, &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Got a Hold on You&quot;, and the number three &quot;Midnight in Montgomery&quot;. Jackson also co-wrote several songs on Randy Travis&#x27; 1991 album &quot;High Lonesome&quot;.

&quot;A Lot About Livin&#x27; (And a Little &#x27;bout Love)&quot;, his third album, accounted for the number one hits &quot;She&#x27;s Got the Rhythm (And I Got the Blues)&quot; (which Randy Travis co-wrote) and &quot;Chattahoochee&quot;, plus the top five hits &quot;Tonight I Climbed the Wall&quot;, &quot;Mercury Blues&quot; and &quot;(Who Says) You Can&#x27;t Have It All&quot;. &quot;Chattahoochee&quot; also won him the 1994 Country Music Association (CMA) awards for Single and Song of the Year. In 1994, Jackson left his management company, Ten Ten Management, which had overseen his career up to that point, and switched to Gary Overton. His fourth album was titled &quot;Who I Am&quot;, and it contained four number one hits: a cover of the Eddie Cochran rockabilly standard &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;, followed by &quot;Livin&#x27; on Love&quot;, &quot;Gone Country&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Even Know Your Name&quot;. An additional track from the album, a cover of Rodney Crowell&#x27;s &quot;Song for the Life&quot;, made number six. In late 1994, Clay Walker reached number one with &quot;If I Could Make a Living&quot;, which Jackson co-wrote. Jackson also appeared in the 1996 &quot;When Harry Kept Delores&quot; episode of &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, performing &quot;Mercury Blues&quot;.

===Mid-to-late 1990s===
&quot;The Greatest Hits Collection&quot; was released on October 24, 1995. The disc contained 17 hits, two newly recorded songs (&quot;I&#x27;ll Try&quot; and &quot;Tall, Tall Trees&quot;), and the song &quot;Home&quot; from &quot;Here in the Real World&quot; that had never been released as a single. These first two songs both made number one. &quot;Everything I Love&quot; followed in 1996. Its first single, the Tom T. Hall-penned &quot;Little Bitty&quot;, took Jackson to the top of the charts in late 1996. The album also included the number one hit &quot;There Goes&quot; and a number two cover of Charly McClain&#x27;s 1980 single &quot;Who&#x27;s Cheatin&#x27; Who&quot;. The album&#x27;s fifth single was &quot;A House with No Curtains&quot;, which became his first release since 1989 to miss the top 10.

1998&#x27;s &quot;High Mileage&quot; was led off by the number four &quot;I&#x27;ll Go On Loving You&quot;. After it came the album&#x27;s only number one hit, &quot;Right on the Money&quot;, co-written by Phil Vassar and Charlie Black. With Jackson&#x27;s release of &quot;Under the Influence&quot; in 1999, he took the double risk on an album of covers of country classics while retaining a traditional sound when a rock- and pop-tinged sound dominated country radio. When the Country Music Association (CMA) asked George Jones to trim his act to 90 seconds for the 1999 CMA awards, Jones decided to boycott the event. In solidarity, Jackson interrupted his own song and launched into Jones&#x27;s song &quot;Choices&quot; and then walked offstage.

===2000s===
Due to a shift in the sound of country music towards a more pop sound in the 1990s and 2000s, he and George Strait criticized the state of country music in the song &quot;Murder on Music Row&quot;. The song sparked debate in the country music community about whether &quot;traditional&quot; country music was actually dead or not. Despite the fact that the song was not officially released as a single, it became the highest-charting nonseasonal album cut (not available in any retail single configuration or released as a promotional single to radio during a chart run) to appear on Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks in the Broadcast Data Systems era, beating the record previously held by Garth Brooks&#x27; &quot;Belleau Wood.&quot; The duo were invited to open the 2000 Academy of Country Music Awards (ACMAs) with a performance of the tune. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented on Jackson&#x27;s style remarking, &quot;If Garth and Shania have raised the bar for country concerts with Kiss-style production and endless costume changes, then Alan Jackson is doing his best to return the bar to a more human level.&quot; After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Jackson released &quot;Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)&quot; as a tribute to those killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The country/soft rock song became a hit single and briefly propelled him into the mainstream spotlight; Jackson had debuted the song at the 2001 CMA Awards and his performance was generally considered the highlight of the show. Jackson&#x27;s website crashed the next day from server requests. The song came to Jackson suddenly, and had not been scheduled for any official release, but the live performance began receiving radio airplay and was soon released as a single. It was included on his 2002 album &quot;Drive&quot;, both the live version from his CMA performance, and a radio version.

Jackson released his second Christmas album (after &quot;Honky Tonk Christmas&quot; in 1993), titled &quot;Let It Be Christmas&quot; on October 22, 2002. Jeannie Kendall contacted Jackson to do a duet, and he suggested the song &quot;Timeless and True Love&quot;; the song appeared on her first solo album, released in 2003. In early 2006, Jackson released his first gospel music album entitled &quot;Precious Memories&quot;. He put together the album at the request of his mother, who enjoyed religious music. Jackson considered this album a &quot;side project&quot; and nothing too official, but it was ultimately treated as such. More than 1.8 million units were eventually sold.

Just a few months later, Jackson released his next album, &quot;Like Red on a Rose&quot;. Originally intended to be a bluegrass album, &quot;Like Red on a Rose&quot; had a different producer and sound. Keith Stegall was notably absent from this album and, instead, Alison Krauss took over the producing reins. Unlike Jackson&#x27;s previous albums, the album abandoned Jackson&#x27;s typical neotraditional country style and instead, went for a soft rock/adult contemporary sound. This move proved controversial for his fans, who accused him of abandoning his signature style in order to go for a more commercial pop route. Although critically acclaimed, the album was considered a commercial disappointment for the singer. For his next album, he went back to his country roots. &quot;Good Time&quot; was released on March 4, 2008. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Small Town Southern Man&quot;, was released to radio on November 19, 2007. &quot;Country Boy&quot;, &quot;Good Time&quot;, &quot;Sissy&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;I Still Like Bologna&quot;, were also released as singles. &quot;Sissy&#x27;s Song&quot; is dedicated to a longtime friend of the Jackson family (Leslie &quot;Sissy&quot; Fitzgerald) who worked in their house every day. Fitzgerald was killed in a motorcycle accident in mid-2007.

===2010s and 2020s===
His sixteenth studio album, &quot;Freight Train&quot;, was released on March 30, 2010. The first single was &quot;It&#x27;s Just That Way&quot;, which debuted at No. 50 in January 2010. &quot;Hard Hat and a Hammer&quot; is the album&#x27;s second single, released in May 2010. On November 23, 2010, Jackson released another greatest-hits package, entitled &quot;34 Number Ones&quot;, which features a cover of the Johnny Cash hit &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, as well as the duet with Zac Brown Band, &quot;As She&#x27;s Walking Away&quot;. On January 20, 2011, Sony Music Nashville announced that Jackson and his Sony-owned record label, Arista Nashville, had parted. In March of that year, Jackson announced his new deal with Capitol&#x27;s EMI Records Nashville. It was a joint venture between ACR (Alan&#x27;s Country Records) and Capitol. All records were to be released and marketed through Capitol&#x27;s EMI Records Nashville label.

In 2012, Jackson released the album &quot;Thirty Miles West&quot;. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Long Way to Go&quot;, &quot;So You Don&#x27;t Have to Love Me Anymore&quot; and &quot;You Go Your Way&quot;. None of the singles reached the top 20. A tour in 2013 supported the album. Jackson released his second gospel album, &quot;Precious Memories Volume II&quot;, on March 26, 2013. Later that same year, Jackson released his first (and so far, only) bluegrass album, simply titled &quot;The Bluegrass Album&quot;. Two singles were released from the album: &quot;Blue Ridge Mountain Song&quot; and &quot;Blacktop&quot;. The album eventually peaked at no. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Bluegrass Albums chart and no. 3 on the country chart. In 2014, Jackson recorded the opening credits song, &quot;A Million Ways to Die&quot;, for the film &quot;A Million Ways to Die in the West&quot;, co-writing the song with Seth MacFarlane and Joel McNeely.

In August 2014, the Country Music Hall of Fame opened an exhibit celebrating Jackson&#x27;s 25 years in the music industry. It was also announced that he was an artist in residency as well, performing shows on October 8 and 22. The exhibit highlights the different milestones in his career with memorabilia collected over the years. His twenty-fifth anniversary &quot;Keeping It Country&quot; tour, began on January 8, 2015, in Estero, Florida. In January 2015, Jackson began his 25th anniversary &quot;Keepin&#x27; It Country&quot; tour, followed in April with the announcement of his twentieth studio album, &quot;Angels and Alcohol&quot;, which was released on July 17. In 2016, Jackson was selected as one of 30 artists to perform on &quot;Forever Country&quot;, a mash-up track of &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, &quot;On the Road Again&quot; and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; which celebrates 50 years of the CMA Awards. In 2016 and 2017, Jackson extended his &quot;Keepin&#x27; It Country&quot; tour with American Idol alumna Lauren Alaina. In August 2016, Legacy Recordings released the collection &quot;&quot; digitally and on three CDs with 59 tracks including eight previously unreleased tracks which was dedicated to Merle Haggard&#x27;s memory. The collection was initially released as a Walmart exclusive in November 2015, with a worldwide release in August 2016. In October 2017, Alan Jackson released a new song titled &quot;The Older I Get&quot; for a planned future studio album. The album &quot;Where Have You Gone&quot; would be released four years later; the record features an even harder, more traditional country sound than Jackson&#x27;s usual repertoire, with Jackson noting in interviews that he feared that &quot;country music is gone, and it&#x27;s not coming back.&quot;

==Awards, nominations, and Georgia Music Hall of Fame==
Jackson was nominated for six CMAs in 1989 and four more in 1994, including one for Entertainer of the Year. He became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1991 and was inducted by Roy Acuff and Randy Travis. Jackson was the most nominated artist at the 29th annual TNN/Music City News Country Awards (at the Grand Ole Opry House) that was broadcast June 5, 1995. His six nominations included best entertainer, male artist, vocal collaboration, album, single, and video (two nominations in this category).
At the 2002 CMAs, Jackson set a record for having the most nominations in a single year – ten – many rising from the song &quot;Where Were You&quot;. It also brought his career total up to the second number of most nominations ever, after George Strait. &quot;Where Were You&quot; also was nominated for a Grammy for Song of the Year. At the 2003 Academy of Country Music Awards, Jackson won Album of the Year for &quot;Drive&quot; and Video of the Year for the video to &quot;Drive (For Daddy Gene).&quot;

In 2004, a five-mile (8 km) stretch of Interstate 85 through Jackson&#x27;s hometown of Newnan was renamed the &quot;Alan Jackson Highway&quot; in the singer&#x27;s honor. After learning of the honor, he stated &quot;[Newnan] was a great place to grow up. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m quite qualified for the main highway. Maybe they should&#x27;ve picked a dirt road or something.&quot; Jackson was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame on October 22, 2001, in Atlanta. Alan Jackson was selected to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2010. In 2017, Alan Jackson was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Touring==
Jackson headlined the 1995 Fruit of the Loom Comfort Tour, a deal worth $40 million. It began January 20 in New Orleans and ran for a hundred dates. Alan Jackson&#x27;s 2004 concert tour launched January 23 in Fort Myers, Florida, and was sponsored by NAPA Auto Parts in a deal that included Jackson&#x27;s endorsement in TV spots. The tour included more than 50 U.S. dates. Martina McBride was the opening for some of the shows. In March 2011, he visited Australia to perform for the CMC Rocks The Hunter music festival where he was the headline act for Saturday night. In 2015, Jackson kicked off his 25th Anniversary Keepin&#x27; It Country tour. The tour began with a concert in Estero, Florida, on January 8 at the Germane Arena. Jon Pardi &amp; Brandy Clark are special guests for most concerts of the tour. The tour wrapped with a solo concert in Highland Park, Illinois, at the Ravinia Pavilion on August 31.

In March 2022, Jackson announced his farewell tour &quot;One More For The Road Tour.&quot;

==Band members==
Jackson records his studio albums, in most part, with the backing of some of the members of his live band, the Strayhorns. As of 2022, the band consists of:
* Mark McClurg – acoustic guitar, harmony vocals
* Scott Coney – acoustic and baritone guitars, banjo, occasional fiddle
* Rusty Danmyer – steel guitar

==Personal life==
Jackson married his high school sweetheart, Denise Jackson, on December 15, 1979. They have three daughters,: Mattie Denise Selecman (born June 19, 1990), Alexandra Jane &quot;Ali&quot; (born August 23, 1993), and Dani Grace (born August 28, 1997). The couple became grandparents in December 2022 when their daughter Ali and her husband Sam Bradshaw welcomed their first child, a son. Although the couple separated for several months in 1998 due to the strains of Jackson&#x27;s career, they have since reconciled.

Denise Jackson wrote a book that topped &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list about her life with Jackson, their relationship, their brief separation and recommitment to each other, and her commitment to Christianity. The book, &quot;It&#x27;s All About Him: Finding the Love of My Life,&quot; was published in 2007. In May 2008, she released a gift book titled &quot;The Road Home&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s nephew, Adam Wright, is also a country music singer-songwriter. Adam and his wife, Shannon, perform together as a duo called The Wrights. The Wrights co-wrote two songs and sang harmony vocals on Jackson&#x27;s &quot;What I Do&quot; album. Jackson is a cousin of former Major League Baseball player Brandon Moss. In June 2009, Jackson listed his estate just outside Franklin, Tennessee, for sale, asking $38 million. The property sold in late May 2010 for $28 million, one of the highest prices ever for a home sale in the Nashville area. In 2010, the singer then moved into a home in the same Nashville suburb. The singer and his wife paid $3.675 million for the estate in June 2010, but less than a year later they listed the home for $3.995 million.

Jackson maintained a close friendship with fellow country singer George Jones. Jones has been mentioned in songs such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Rock the Jukebox&quot; (Jones also appeared in the video which accompanied it) and &quot;Murder on Music Row.&quot; The song &quot;Just Playin&#x27; Possum&quot; is dedicated to Jones and talks of how Alan only wants to lie low and play possum (with &quot;possum&quot; referring to George Jones). Jones can also be seen in the video for &quot;Good Time.&quot; In 2008, Jones was a surprise guest at Jackson&#x27;s &quot;CMT Giants&quot; ceremony, where he thanked Jackson for his friendship. He&#x27;s also close friends with George Strait, who sang &quot;Murder on Music Row&quot; with him. Besides his associations with big stars, Jackson maintains his connections to his roots and old friends.

At George Jones&#x27; funeral service, on May 2, 2013, Jackson performed one of Jones&#x27; classics, &quot;He Stopped Loving Her Today&quot;, at the close of the service at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. An avid classic car collector, Jackson&#x27;s collection includes an Amphicar, a 1968 Shelby GT 500 KR Convertible and a 1970 Chevelle SS 396, among others.

In a 2021 appearance on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, Jackson announced he had Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT), stating &quot;...it&#x27;s been affecting me for years. And it&#x27;s getting more and more obvious. And I know I&#x27;m stumbling around on stage. And now I&#x27;m having a little trouble balancing, even in front of the microphone, and so I just feel very uncomfortable.&quot;

<text>Jean Genet (; ; – ) was a French novelist, playwright, poet, essayist, and political activist. In his early life he was a vagabond and petty criminal, but he later became a writer and playwright. His major works include the novels &quot;The Thief&#x27;s Journal&quot; and &quot;Our Lady of the Flowers&quot; and the plays &quot;The Balcony&quot;, &quot;The Maids&quot; and &quot;The Screens&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Genet&#x27;s mother was a prostitute who raised him for the first seven months of his life before placing him for adoption. Thereafter Genet was raised in the provincial town of Alligny-en-Morvan, in the Nièvre department of central France. His foster family was headed by a carpenter and, according to Edmund White&#x27;s biography, was loving and attentive. While he received excellent grades in school, his childhood involved a series of attempts at running away and incidents of petty theft.

===Detention and military service===
For this and other misdemeanors, including repeated acts of vagrancy, he was sent at the age of 15 to Mettray Penal Colony where he was detained between 2 September 1926 and 1 March 1929. In &quot;Miracle of the Rose&quot; (1946), he gives an account of this period of detention, which ended at the age of 18 when he joined the Foreign Legion. He was eventually given a dishonorable discharge on grounds of indecency (having been caught engaged in a homosexual act) and spent a period as a vagabond, petty thief and prostitute across Europe—experiences he recounts in &quot;The Thief&#x27;s Journal&quot; (1949).

===Criminal career, prison, and prison writings===
After returning to Paris in 1937, Genet was in and out of prison through a series of arrests for theft, use of false papers, vagabondage, lewd acts, and other offences. In prison Genet wrote his first poem, &quot;Le condamné à mort&quot;, which he had printed at his own cost, and the novel &quot;Our Lady of the Flowers&quot; (1944).

In Paris, Genet sought out and introduced himself to Jean Cocteau, who was impressed by his writing. Cocteau used his contacts to get Genet&#x27;s novel published, and in 1949, when Genet was threatened with a life sentence after ten convictions, Cocteau and other prominent figures, including Jean-Paul Sartre and Pablo Picasso, successfully petitioned the French President to have the sentence set aside. Genet would never return to prison.

===Writing and activism===
By 1949, Genet had completed five novels, three plays, and numerous poems, many controversial for their explicit and often deliberately provocative portrayal of homosexuality and criminality. Sartre wrote a long analysis of Genet&#x27;s existential development (from vagrant to writer), entitled &quot;Saint Genet&quot; (1952), which was anonymously published as the first volume of Genet&#x27;s complete works. Genet was strongly affected by Sartre&#x27;s analysis and did not write for the next five years.

Between 1955 and 1961, Genet wrote three more plays as well as an essay called &quot;What Remains of a Rembrandt Torn into Four Equal Pieces and Flushed Down the Toilet&quot;, on which hinged Jacques Derrida&#x27;s analysis of Genet in his seminal work &quot;Glas&quot;. During this time, Genet became emotionally attached to Abdallah Bentaga, a tightrope walker. However, following a number of accidents and Bentaga&#x27;s suicide in 1964, Genet entered a period of depression, and even attempted suicide himself.

From the late 1960s, starting with an homage to Daniel Cohn-Bendit after the events of May 1968, Genet became politically active. He participated in demonstrations drawing attention to the living conditions of immigrants in France. Genet was censored in the United States in 1968 and later expelled when they refused him a visa. In an interview with Edward de Grazia, professor of law and First Amendment lawyer, Genet discusses the time he went through Canada for the Chicago congress. He entered without a visa and left with no issues.

In 1970, the Black Panthers invited him to the United States, where he stayed for three months giving lectures, attended the trial of their leader, Huey Newton, and published articles in their journals. Later the same year he spent six months in Palestinian refugee camps, secretly meeting Yasser Arafat near Amman. Profoundly moved by his experiences in the United States and Jordan, Genet wrote a final lengthy memoir about his experiences, &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot;, which would be published posthumously.

Genet also supported Angela Davis and George Jackson, as well as Michel Foucault and Daniel Defert&#x27;s Prison Information Group. He worked with Foucault and Sartre to protest police brutality against Algerians in Paris, a problem persisting since the Algerian War of Independence, when beaten bodies were to be found floating in the Seine. Genet expresses his solidarity with the Red Army Faction (RAF) of Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, in the article &quot;Violence et brutalité&quot;, published in &quot;Le Monde&quot;, 1977.

In September 1982, Genet was in Beirut when the massacres took place in the Palestinian camps of Sabra and Shatila. In response, Genet published &quot;Quatre heures à Chatila&quot; (&quot;Four Hours in Shatila&quot;), an account of his visit to Shatila after the event. In one of his rare public appearances during the later period of his life, at the invitation of Austrian philosopher Hans Köchler, he read from his work during the inauguration of an exhibition on the massacre of Sabra and Shatila organized by the International Progress Organization in Vienna, Austria, on 19 December 1983.

===Death===
In the early summer of 1985, the year before his death, Genet was interviewed by the BBC. He told the interviewer controversial but not surprising details of his life such as the fact that he disliked France so much that he was rooting for the Germans when the Nazis invaded Paris. He compared the BBC interview to a police interrogation.

Genet developed throat cancer and was found dead at Jack&#x27;s Hotel in Paris on 15 April 1986 where his photograph and books remain. Genet may have fallen on the floor and fatally hit his head. He is buried in the Larache Christian Cemetery in Larache, Morocco.

==Genet&#x27;s works==

===Novels and autobiography===
Throughout his five early novels, Genet works to subvert the traditional set of moral values of his assumed readership. He celebrates a beauty in evil, emphasizes his singularity, raises violent criminals to icons, and enjoys the specificity of homosexual gesture and coding and the depiction of scenes of betrayal. &quot;Our Lady of the Flowers&quot; (&quot;Notre Dame des Fleurs&quot; 1943) is a journey through the prison underworld, featuring a fictionalized alter-ego named Divine, usually referred to in the feminine. Divine is surrounded by &quot;tantes&quot; (&quot;aunties&quot; or &quot;queens&quot;) with colorful sobriquets such as Mimosa I, Mimosa II, First Communion and the Queen of Rumania. The two auto-fictional novels &quot;Miracle of the Rose&quot; (&quot;Miracle de la rose&quot; 1946) and &quot;The Thief&#x27;s Journal&quot; (&quot;Journal du voleur&quot; 1949) describe Genet&#x27;s time in Mettray Penal Colony and his experiences as a vagabond and prostitute across Europe. &quot;Querelle de Brest&quot; (1947) is set in the port town of Brest, where sailors and the sea are associated with murder. &quot;Funeral Rites&quot; (1949) is a story of love and betrayal across political divides, written for the narrator&#x27;s lover, Jean Decarnin, killed by the Germans in WWII.

&quot;Prisoner of Love&quot;, published in 1986 after Genet&#x27;s death, is a memoir of his encounters with Palestinian fighters and Black Panthers. It has a more documentary tone than his fiction.

===Art criticism===
Genet wrote an essay on the work of the Swiss sculptor and artist Alberto Giacometti titled &quot;L&#x27;Atelier d&#x27;Alberto Giacometti&quot;. It was highly praised by major artists, including Giacometti and Picasso. Genet wrote in an informal style, incorporating excerpts of conversations between himself and Giacometti. Genet&#x27;s biographer Edmund White said that, rather than write in the style of an art historian, Genet &quot;invented a whole new language for discussing&quot; Giacometti, proposing &quot;that the statues of Giacometti should be offered to the dead, and that they should be buried.&quot;

===Plays===
Genet&#x27;s plays present highly stylized depictions of ritualistic struggles between outcasts of various kinds and their oppressors. Social identities are parodied and shown to involve complex layering through manipulation of the dramatic fiction and its inherent potential for theatricality and role-play. Maids imitate one another and their mistress in &quot;The Maids&quot; (1947); the clients of a brothel simulate roles of political power before, in a dramatic reversal, actually becoming those figures, all surrounded by mirrors that both reflect and conceal, in &quot;The Balcony&quot; (1957). Most strikingly, Genet offers a critical dramatisation of what Aimé Césaire called negritude in &quot;The Blacks&quot; (1958), presenting a violent assertion of black identity and anti-white virulence framed in terms of mask-wearing and roles adopted and discarded. His most overtly political play is &quot;The Screens&quot; (1964), an epic account of the Algerian War of Independence. He also wrote another full-length drama, &quot;Splendid&#x27;s&quot;, in 1948 and a one-act play, &quot;Her&quot; (&quot;Elle&quot;), in 1955, though neither was published or produced during Genet&#x27;s lifetime.

&quot;The Maids&quot; was the first of Genet&#x27;s plays to be staged in New York, produced by Julie Bovasso at Tempo Playhouse in New York City in 1955. &quot;The Blacks&quot; was, after &quot;The Balcony&quot;, the third of Genet&#x27;s plays to be staged in New York. The production was the longest running Off-Broadway non-musical of the decade. Originally premiered in Paris in 1959, this 1961 New York production ran for 1,408 performances. The original cast featured James Earl Jones, Roscoe Lee Browne, Louis Gossett Jr., Cicely Tyson, Godfrey Cambridge, Maya Angelou and Charles Gordone.

===Film===
In 1950, Genet directed &quot;Un Chant d&#x27;Amour&quot;, a 26-minute black-and-white film depicting the fantasies of a homosexual male prisoner and his prison warden. Genet is also credited as co-director of the West German television documentary &quot;Am Anfang war der Dieb&quot; (In the Beginning was the Thief) (1984), along with his co-stars Hans Neuenfels and François Bondy.

Genet&#x27;s work has been adapted for film and produced by other filmmakers. In 1982, Rainer Werner Fassbinder released &quot;Querelle&quot;, his final film, based on &quot;Querelle of Brest&quot;. It starred Brad Davis, Jeanne Moreau and Franco Nero. Tony Richardson directed &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, which was based on a short story by Genet. It starred Jeanne Moreau with the screenplay written by Marguerite Duras. Todd Haynes&#x27; &quot;Poison&quot; was based on the writings of Genet.

Several of Genet&#x27;s plays were adapted into films. &quot;The Balcony&quot; (1963), directed by Joseph Strick, starred Shelley Winters as Madame Irma, Peter Falk, Lee Grant and Leonard Nimoy. &quot;The Maids&quot; was filmed in 1974 and starred Glenda Jackson, Susannah York and Vivien Merchant. Italian director Salvatore Samperi in 1986 directed another adaptation for film of the same play, &quot;La Bonne&quot; (Eng. &quot;Corruption&quot;), starring Florence Guerin and Katrine Michelsen.

== In popular culture ==
Genet made an appearance by proxy in the pop charts when David Bowie released his 1972 hit single &quot;The Jean Genie&quot;. In his 2005 book &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;, Bowie confirmed that the title &quot;...was a clumsy pun upon Jean Genet&quot;. A later promo video combines a version of the song with a fast edit of Genet&#x27;s 1950 film &quot;Un Chant d&#x27;Amour&quot;.
Genet is referenced in the song &quot;Les Boys&quot; from the 1980 Dire Straits album &quot;Making Movies&quot;. The 2023 French film Little Girl Blue, starring Marion Cotillard, traces the repercussions of Genet&#x27;s sexual abuse of 11-year-old Carole Achache, the daughter of his friend Monique Achache. The 1991 film &quot;Poison&quot; directed by Todd Haynes was based on the writings on Jean Genet.

<text>The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT- Bombay or IIT-B) is a public research university and technical institute in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

IIT Bombay was founded in 1958. In 1961, the Parliament decreed IITs as Institutes of National Importance. A committee formed by the Government of India recommended the establishment of four higher institutes of technology to set the direction for the development of technical education in the country in 1946. Planning had begun in 1957 and the first cohort of 100 students was admitted in 1958. Since its establishment in Powai, the institute has expanded to include more than 584 major buildings, with a combined area of more than 2.2 square kilometers.

IIT Bombay is known for two- or three-year Master of Technology (M.Tech.), the four-year Bachelor of Science (B.S.), the two-year Master of Science (M.Sc.) and the five-year Inter-Disciplinary Dual-Degree Programme (IDDDP) among many others. It also has a comprehensive graduate program offering doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It currently has a total of 15 academic departments, 20 additional education centres, a school of excellence and four interdisciplinary programmes including a management programme and industrial design programmes.

==History==

IIT Bombay was the second Indian Institute of Technology to be established in 1958 with assistance from UNESCO and with funds endowed by the Soviet Union. UNESCO agreed to provide equipment whilst technical experts mainly came from the Soviet Union. The Government of India held the mantle for all other expenses including the cost of the buildings and any recurring expenses. The proposed site for the institute was Powai with an area of which the Bombay State Government rendered. While construction was being completed, the first academic session of the institute opened on 25 July 1958, in its temporary home at the Synthetic and Art Silk Mills Research Association (SASMIRA) building in Worli with 100 students. The following is the status quo of the assistance received from the UNESCO under the UN Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance:
* Equipment costing Rs.57,35,000 has so far been received (USSR—Rs.55,50,000; UK—Rs.1,50,000; USA—Rs.18,000 and Germany—Rs.19,000)
* 12 Professors (10 Russians, 1 American and 1 Yugoslavian) and 3 Russian Translators are working at the Institution.
* For advanced training in USSR, 4 Indian teachers were deputed in 1958 and 6 more teachers were selected.

These students were selected from over 3,400 applicants for admission to the first year undergraduate engineering programmes of Aerospace, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Engineering Physics, Energy, Mechanical, Metallurgical Engineering, and MSc Chemistry. One of the main objectives of establishing the institute was to develop facilities for studies in a variety of specialized engineering and technological sciences. The need for establishing adequate facilities for postgraduate studies and research was kept uppermost in mind in the founding years. While the institute was functioning provisionally at Worli, an effort was made to expedite the progress of the building project at its permanent location and Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone of the Institute at Powai on 10 March 1959.

On 9 July 2018, IIT Bombay was conferred the status of Institute of Eminence by the Ministry of Human Resources &amp; Development, along with 5 other institutes in India which would provide it additional autonomy and government funds.

== Campus ==

The IIT Bombay campus, having an area of about 545 acres, is located at Powai, in East Mumbai, between the Vihar and Powai lakes. The campus is divided into clusters of buildings. The academic area chiefly comprises the main building, various departmental annexes and auditoria. All department annexes are connected by a corridor named &quot;Infinite Corridor&quot;. Beyond the Convocation Hall lie most of the hostels. There are a total of 18 hostels, of which three hostels (Hostels 10, 11 and 15) and a wing of the newly constructed hostel (Hostel 16) are for female students.

Due to its proximity to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the campus has significant green cover and is mostly untouched by the pollution of the rest of the city. The proximity of the campus to the national park has also led to occasional sightings of leopards and mugger crocodiles along the banks of the Powai lake. Sometimes they stray into the campus in search of prey.

The campus has also recorded over 200 species of birds including Indian grey hornbill, Indian pitta, Vigors&#x27;s sunbird, Ashy prinia, Indian paradise flycatcher, Rufous woodpecker, and Oriental darter.

The institute has two swimming pools; football, hockey and cricket grounds; and tennis, basketball, squash and volleyball courts. It also has a Students&#x27; Activity Center (SAC) for various cultural and other extracurricular activities. In addition to these facilities, the campus also houses two high schools, one of which is a Kendriya Vidyalaya and the other is called IIT Campus School.

== Organization and administration ==

=== Governance ===
At the institutional level, IIT Bombay is governed by a Board of Governors with its chairman nominated by the Visitor (the President of India) guided by the IIT Council; the Director as a member; the Registrar as secretary. Besides this, there are four persons having specialized knowledge or practical experience in respect of education, engineering or science nominated by the council. Two professors are nominated by the Senate. Additionally, one technologist or industrialist of repute is nominated by the government of each of the States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.

For all academic matters, the Senate is the authority having control and responsibility for the maintenance of standards of instruction, education and examinations and all other allied academic matters. The Senate is constituted of all the professors of the institute, a few nominated members and the director, appointed by MHRD for five years, the executive head of the institute is the chairman.

The key people in the execution of the institute&#x27;s activities are the director and two deputy directors (Academic &amp; Infrastructural Affairs and Finance &amp; External Affairs) who are assisted by seven Deans (Infrastructure Planning &amp; Support, Research &amp; Development, Academic Programmes, Students Affairs, Alumni &amp; Corporate Relations, Faculty Affairs and International Relations) and the Heads of the Departments, Centres and Schools. The other administrative functions are managed by the Registrar, with senior administrative officers being assigned for specific areas such as Estate Management, Materials Management, Personnel Management, Finance and Accounts, and Academic Affairs.

The Institute Advisory Council is a non-statutory body comprising eminent personalities from business, industry and academia, which reviews and makes suggestions on long-term policies and short-term goals.

===Academic Office===
The Academic Office of the institute exists to facilitate, initiate and co-ordinate the academic work of the institute, particularly the teaching and assessment of students. It acts as the repository of grades and academic records of all students, both past and present. It provides administrative support to the Senate, which is the highest academic body of the institute.

The head of the Academic Office is the dean of academic programmes, who is a senior professor of the institute. The Dean is helped by a permanent administrative set-up headed by a deputy registrar (education). The Academic Office closely interacts with the dean of student affairs (DoSA), who looks after all non-academic problems of students. The DoSA, as the ex-officio president of the Student Gymkhana, coordinates various co-curricular activities of students.

<text>Jorge Gilberto Ramos Ávalos (; born March 16, 1958) is a Mexican-American journalist and author. Regarded as the best-known Spanish-language news anchor in the United States of America, he has been referred to as &quot;The Walter Cronkite of Latin America&quot;. Based in Miami, Florida, he anchors the Univision news television program &quot;Noticiero Univision&quot;, the Univision Sunday-morning political news program &quot;Al Punto&quot;, and the Fusion TV English-language program &quot;America with Jorge Ramos&quot;. He has covered five wars, and events ranging from the fall of the Berlin Wall to the War in Afghanistan.

Ramos has won ten Emmy Awards and the Maria Moors Cabot Prize for excellence in journalism. He has also been included on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Influential People&quot;.

==Early life==
Jorge Gilberto Ramos Ávalos was born on March 16, 1958, in Mexico City, Mexico, to a Roman Catholic family, and he was raised in the Bosques de Echegaray neighborhood of Naucalpan, a suburb of Mexico City. His father was an architect. He attended Catholic schools where he states he was abused by the priests. 

Ramos graduated from the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City where he majored in communications. Ramos has a Master&#x27;s degree in International Studies from the University of Miami. In 2007, the University of Richmond conferred an honorary Doctor of Letters on him.

==Career==

Ramos worked for Grupo Televisa&#x27;s flagship XEW-TV in Mexico City for the network&#x27;s local version of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. At the age of 24, he quit that job after a story he produced that was critical of Mexico&#x27;s government was censored. In 1983, he left Mexico on a student visa for Los Angeles, where he planned to enroll in the UCLA Extension&#x27;s journalism classes. In 1984, he was hired by KMEX-TV, an affiliate of what was then the Spanish International Network (SIN) in Los Angeles, which operated on a shoestring budget in a run-down facility on Melrose Avenue. At KMEX, Ramos felt he could express himself freely: &quot;To me it was a palace... the United States gave me opportunities that my country of origin could not: freedom of the press and complete freedom of expression.&quot; Three years later, he became the host for KMEX&#x27;s morning program, &quot;Mundo Latino&quot;. In 1987, Ramos then joined SIN&#x27;s national operation which was rebranded as the Univision network a year later after coming under new ownership; Univision has a broad entertainment and news-sharing agreement with Televisa.

Since 1987, Ramos has been the anchorman for &quot;Noticiero Univision&quot;, a nightly Spanish language newscast, alongside colleague María Elena Salinas. He also hosts &quot;Al Punto&quot;, a Spanish-language Sunday public affairs program aired weekly on Univision, and &quot;America with Jorge Ramos&quot;, an English language news magazine on Fusion TV.

In 1989, as he watched the fall of the Berlin Wall, Ramos has said he remembered thinking, &quot;This is why I am what I am!&quot; Other world events he covered include the Salvadoran Civil War, the Persian Gulf War, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. During the United States&#x27;s War in Afghanistan, Ramos traveled there on his own while on vacation because his network refused to send him. Throughout his career he has covered five wars.

As of 2014, KMEX-DT his Univision 34 news shows regularly beat their English language competition among young viewers. He has interviewed multiple world leaders including Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, Fidel Castro, Daniel Ortega and Hugo Chávez.

Ramos also writes a bilingual newspaper column that is published internationally, and appears regularly as a pundit on English-language cable networks, like CNN and MSNBC. Polls among American Latinos rank him as the most trusted and influential Hispanic in America, surpassing all other political leaders, and his Q Score among Latino audiences places him between soccer star Lionel Messi and pop singer Shakira.

In 2002, he founded &quot;Despierta Leyendo&quot; (&quot;Wake Up Reading&quot;), the first book club in the history of Spanish-language television.

On February 21, 2008, he represented Univision in a Democratic debate between Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on The University of Texas at Austin campus in Austin, Texas.

In 2012, Ramos, critical of the lack of Latino moderators in any of the U.S. presidential debates, complained that the debate commission was &quot;stuck in the 1950s&quot;. When Univision held its own forums with candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, Ramos challenged both of them on their immigration policies, specifically Romney&#x27;s &quot;self-deportation&quot; policy, which Ramos considered an insult to Latinos, and Obama&#x27;s deportation of more than 1.4 million people, and his reneging on his promise to address immigration during his first term. &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; named Ramos the broadcaster who would most determine the 2012 presidential election. Ramos&#x27; increased notability, however, led to criticism of his advocacy approach. To this Ramos has stated, &quot;Our position is clearly pro-Latino or pro-immigrant ... We are simply being the voice of those who don&#x27;t have a voice.&quot;

In 2015, after Donald Trump became a presidential candidate, Ramos pursued an interview with Trump for months. When he sent Trump a handwritten request in June, Trump, who had filed a lawsuit against Univision over its decision to drop the Miss Universe pageant following the candidate&#x27;s comments about Mexican immigrants, posted Ramos&#x27;s letter on Instagram, which exposed Ramos&#x27;s cell phone number. Trump later deleted the post.

On August 25, 2015, Ramos attended a news conference held in Dubuque, Iowa, by Trump. Prior to attending, Ramos studied previous Trump press conferences and discovered a pattern of Trump repetitively interjecting &quot;excuse me&quot; and calling on another reporter when asked a question opposing his beliefs. Due to this knowledge, Ramos refused to sit down and persistently continued questioning Trump about his immigration policies when rebuffed. Ramos insisted on his rights as a reporter and United States citizen to ask a question, prompting Trump&#x27;s Head of Security Keith Schiller to push him backwards out of the conference room. About 15 minutes later, Trump allowed Ramos to return to the conference, where he and Trump engaged in a heated exchange on the issue. Trump later explained that he had not called on Ramos for a question, as he had called on another reporter in the audience. Ramos accused Trump of &quot;spreading hate&quot; with his calls for mass deportations of undocumented families, and repealing birthright citizenship, and questioned the feasibility of Trump&#x27;s proposals. He also questioned Trump&#x27;s viability as a candidate among Latino voters, citing a poll indicating that 75% of those voters held unfavorable opinions of him, and projected that Trump would only get 16% of the Latino vote. Election exit polls showed Trump getting 29% of the Hispanic vote, a 13% increase over Ramos&#x27;s projection. Most Latinos did not vote though. Latino turnout was actually under 50%, even lower than the historically low election turnout overall. It was higher in the prior election since Obama was running. 

The press conference incident inspired Ramos to create his documentary &quot;Hate Rising&quot; focused on increasing incidents of racial bigotry and violence across the country, which aired October 23, 2016, on Univision and Fusion. In preparation for the documentary, Ramos met with members of various hate groups across the country including Ku Klux Klan members and neo-Nazis, along with Latino and Muslim victims. His journey lasted nine months, often placing him in danger as both an immigrant and a Mexican-American man. In order to gain face time with members of white supremacist groups, Ramos partnered with director Catherine Tambini, an American who the groups were under the impression they would be speaking to, and only right before the interview started did Ramos sit down to ask questions.

In 2016, Ramos began leveraging Facebook Live to stream raw footage taken on his phone to social media audiences, gaining 2.6 million views on his Iowa caucus videos and over four million on his reports during the New Hampshire primaries.

On February 25, 2019, he was held with his journalistic group in the Miraflores Palace after an interview with Nicolás Maduro. After seizing the equipment and interview recordings, he was released hours later and deported from the country. During the interview, Maduro denied there was a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, which led Ramos to show Maduro images of Venezuelans eating garbage to point out that there was indeed a crisis. After being released, Ramos stated that he and his group were held because this action bothered Maduro. The Information Minister of Maduro, Jorge Rodríguez, described the incident as a &quot;cheap show.&quot;

On April 12, 2019, his intervention in the morning conference of Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador was controversial over the confrontation he held with López Obrador, around homicide figures in Mexico in the period of the administration. The episode opened a debate on the use of figures of malicious homicides in Mexico and its different sources. He interviewed Fidel Castro, confronted Obama on deportations, confronted Trump and is reportedly an admirer of Oriana Fallaci.

On September 9, 2024, Ramos announced that he would depart from Univision following the 2024 presidential election, after a 39-year tenure with the network. His last newscast was December 13, 2024.

==Personal life==
Ramos earned a master&#x27;s degree in international studies at the University of Miami in Florida.

In 2008, Ramos became a United States citizen, after many years of feeling personally conflicted over the matter. He had considered himself just another &quot;Mexican with a green card.&quot; That year, however, his 50th birthday, he had lived in Mexico 25 years and 25 years in the United States, and came to a realization, explaining, &quot;You have to go through a mental and emotional process to recognize who you really are,&quot; Ramos said. &quot;I finally recognized that I cannot be defined by one country. I am from both countries. It took me many years to make peace with that thought, and that I was never going back to Mexico.&quot;

Ramos has been married twice. His first wife was Gina Montaner, daughter of exiled Cuban author Carlos Alberto Montaner; they had one daughter, Paola (born 1988). They divorced in 1990 and Paola was raised by her mother in Spain. In 1992, he married Lisa Bolivar in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista in San Juan, Puerto Rico. They had one son, Nicolas, and they divorced in 2005. He dated Mexican actress Ana de la Reguera, but since 2011, he has been in a relationship with Venezuelan TV host and actress Chiquinquirá Delgado, who has two daughters from previous relationships. He lives in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami.

Although raised Roman Catholic, Ramos does not believe in God, calling himself an agnostic. He has criticized Pope Francis for presiding over the canonization of Pope John Paul II, who he believes willingly covered up abuses committed by Catholic priests.

Ramos is registered as an independent voter.

Ramos disclosed in June 2015 that his daughter, Paola Ramos, was working for Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign.

==Awards and accolades==
Jorge Ramos has won eleven Emmy Awards and the Maria Moors Cabot Prize for excellence in journalism.

In 2015, Ramos was one of the people selected for the five different covers of &quot;Time&quot;″s issue listing &quot;The World&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People&quot;. That same year he was awarded the International Career in Journalism accolade by Ondas Awards.

<doc id="167360" wikidata="Q1162210" url="?curid=167360" title="Fantômas">
<text>Fantômas () is a fictional character created by French writers Marcel Allain (1885–1969) and Pierre Souvestre (1874–1914).

One of the most popular characters in the history of French crime fiction, Fantômas was created in 1911 and appeared in a total of 32 volumes written by the two collaborators, then a subsequent 11 volumes written by Allain alone after Souvestre&#x27;s death. The character was also the basis of various film, television, and comic book adaptations. In the history of crime fiction, he represents a transition from Gothic novel villains of the 19th century to modern-day serial killers and supervillains.

The books and films were released in rapid succession anticipated current production methods of Hollywood, in two respects: First, the authors distributed the writing among themselves; their &quot;working method was to draw up the general plot between them and then go off and write alternate chapters independently of each other, meeting up to tie the two halves of the story together in the final chapter&quot;. This approach allowed the authors to produce almost one novel per month. Second, the film rights to the books were immediately snapped up, ensuring that the film studio could produce sequels reliably.

The popular depiction of Fantômas as wearing a blue mask and black gloves and using technological devices did not originate in the novels, but is a result of the popularity of the trilogy of Fantômas films directed by André Hunebelle in the 1960s. The trilogy, which started in 1964 with &quot;Fantômas&quot;, departed considerably from the novels by giving the story a more comedic tone as preceded by the first two &quot;Pink Panther&quot; films, and by making Fantômas (played by Jean Marais) more of a James Bond enemy by likewise borrowing from the first two Bond films. Despite these discrepancies, the blue-masked Fantômas is arguably the one that is most easily remembered.

==Overview==
Fantômas is a criminal genius, ruthless and particularly elusive. As described by Schütt (2003) in her analysis of French crime fiction literature, Fantômas is the cause of almost any unsolved crime, a merciless criminal who can get away with his evil deeds by impersonating pretty much anyone. He is obsessively chased by Inspector Juve, who is generally the only one able to identify Fantômas&#x27;s tracks.

Fantômas was introduced a few years after Arsène Lupin, another well-known thief. But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder, Fantômas has no such qualms, and is shown as a sociopath who enjoys killing in a sadistic fashion.

He is totally ruthless, shows no mercy, and is loyal to none, not even his own children. He is a master of disguise, always appearing under an assumed identity, often that of a person whom he has murdered. Fantômas makes use of bizarre and improbable techniques in his crimes, such as plague-infested rats, giant snakes, and rooms that fill with sand.

Fantômas&#x27;s background remains vague. He might be of British and/or French ancestry. He appears to have been born in 1867.

In the books, it is established that c. 1892, the man who later became Fantômas called himself Archduke Juan North and operated in the German principality of Hesse-Weimar. There he fathered a child, Vladimir, with an unidentified noblewoman. In circumstances unrevealed, he was arrested and sent to prison.

In 1895, Fantômas was in India. There, an unidentified European woman gave birth to a baby girl, Hélène, whose father might be Fantômas or an Indian prince who was Fantômas&#x27; acolyte. The girl was raised in South Africa.

In 1897, Fantômas was in the United States of America and Mexico. There, he ruined his then business partner, Etienne Rambert.

In 1899, he fought in the Second Boer War in South Africa under the name of Gurn. He fought in the Transvaal as an artillery sergeant under the command of Lord Roberts. He became aide-de-camp to Lord Edward Beltham of Scottwell Hill and fell in love with his younger wife, Lady Maud Beltham.

Upon their return to Europe, soon before the first novel begins (c. 1900), Gurn and Lady Beltham were surprised in their Paris love nest, Rue Levert, by her husband. Lord Beltham was about to shoot Maud when Gurn hit him with a hammer then strangled him.

Fantômas then impersonated Etienne Rambert and framed his son, Charles, for a murder he had committed. As Etienne, he persuaded Charles to go into hiding, but the young man was soon found out by French police detective Juve, who had become truly obsessed with the capture of Fantômas. Juve knew that Charles was innocent and gave him a new identity: journalist Jerôme Fandor, who is employed at the newspaper &quot;La Capitale&quot;. Juve later arrested Gurn and, at his trial, brought forward a convincing argument that Gurn and Fantômas were one and the same, though the evidence was too circumstantial to make a real case. On the eve of his execution, Gurn/Fantômas escaped from custody by being replaced by an actor who had modelled the appearance of his latest character after him and was executed in his place.

Lady Beltham remained constantly torn between her passion for the villain and her horror at his criminal schemes. She eventually committed suicide in 1910.

Fandor fell in love with Hélène and, despite Fantômas&#x27;s repeated attempts to break them up, married her.

Fantômas&#x27;s evil son, Vladimir, reappeared in 1911. Vladimir&#x27;s girlfriend was murdered by Fantômas and Vladimir himself was eventually shot by Juve.

== Characters ==
* Fantômas: A criminal genius, known by many nicknames, such as the &quot;master of everything and everyone&quot;, the &quot;torturer&quot; or the &quot;elusive&quot;, and whose face and true identity remain unknown. A ruthless criminal who&#x27;ll torture and kill to achieve his goals.
* Juve: An inspector in the Sûreté of Paris and the sworn archenemy of Fantômas, whom he pursues obsessively. The intelligent and stubborn Juve is completely devoted to capturing or killing Fantômas.
* Jérôme Fandor: A former victim of Fantômas, he was originally named Charles Rambert until Fantômas killed his parents and framed him for the crime.

===Notes===
* The original covers by Gino Starace are often considered works of lurid genius in themselves and may be seen at the &quot;Fantômas Lives&quot; site. The first Fantômas book cover, showing a contemplative masked man dressed in evening dress and holding a dagger, boldly stepping over Paris, is so well known that it has become a visual cliché.
* The novel &quot;The Yellow Document, or Fantômas of Berlin&quot; by Marcel Allain (1919), despite its title, is not a Fantômas novel.
* The last novel written by Allain was published as a newspaper serial, but never appeared in book form.
* During the 1980s, the first two novels of the series were published in revised English translations: &quot;Fantômas&quot; appeared in 1986 with an introduction by American poet John Ashbery; and &quot;Juve contre Fantômas&quot; appeared in 1987 under the title &quot;The Silent Executioner&quot;, with an introduction by American artist Edward Gorey.

==Film and television==
===Silent film serials===
* 1. &quot;Fantômas&quot; (1913)
* 2. &quot;Juve Contre Fantômas&quot; (1913)
* 3. &quot;Le Mort Qui Tue&quot; (1913)
* 4. &quot;Fantômas Contre Fantômas&quot; (1914)
* 5. &quot;Le Faux Magistrat&quot; (1914)

The silent film pioneer Louis Feuillade directed five &quot;Fantômas&quot; serials starring René Navarre as Fantômas, Bréon as Juve, Georges Melchior as Fandor, and Renée Carl as Lady Beltham. They are regarded as masterpieces of silent film. His later serial &quot;Les Vampires&quot;, which concerns the eponymous crime syndicate (and not actual vampires) is also reminiscent of the &quot;Fantômas&quot; series.

There was a 1920 20-episode American &quot;Fantômas&quot; serial directed by Edward Sedgwick and starring Edward Roseman as Fantômas, which bore little resemblance to the French series. In it, Fantômas&#x27;s nemesis is detective Fred Dixon, played by John Willard. It was partially released in France (12 episodes only) under the title &quot;Les Exploits de Diabolos&quot; (&quot;The Exploits of Diabolos&quot;). A novelization of this serial was written by David Lee White for Black Coat Press under the title &quot;Fantômas in America&quot; in 2007.

===Other films===

* 6. &quot;Fantômas&quot; (1932), directed by Paul Féjos, with Jean Galland as Fantômas.
* 7. &quot;Monsieur Fantômas&quot; (1937), directed by Ernst Moerman is a surrealist silent comedy short subject.
* 8. &quot;Fantômas&quot; (1946), directed by Jean Sacha, with Marcel Herrand as Fantomas.
* 9. &quot;Fantomas Against Fantomas&quot; (1949), directed by Robert Vernay, with Maurice Teynac as Fantomas.
* 10. &quot;Fantômas&quot; (1964), the first of three films directed by André Hunebelle; with Jean Marais as both Fantômas and Fandor, Louis de Funès as Juve, and Mylène Demongeot as Fandor&#x27;s bride, the photographer Hélène. Their tone was generally much more light-hearted than the novels&#x27; and the characters were updated in a James Bond-like style including Bond-type gadgets like the flying Citroën DS of Fantômas with retractable wings that converts to an airplane.
* 11. &quot;Fantômas se déchaîne&quot; (1965)
* 12. &quot;Fantômas contre Scotland Yard&quot; (1967)
* 13. &quot;Macario Against Zagomar&quot; was a 1944 Italian film that used &quot;Zagomar&quot; when they were unable to obtain the rights of Fantomas.

===Television===
A &quot;Fantômas&quot; series of four 90-minute episodes was produced in 1980 starring Helmut Berger as Fantômas, Jacques Dufilho as Juve, and Gayle Hunnicutt as Lady Beltham. Episodes 1 and 4 were directed by Claude Chabrol; episodes 2 and 3 by Luis Buñuel&#x27;s son, Juan Luis Buñuel.

The French movie version of &quot;Fantômas&quot; appears in the Czechoslovakian 1979-1981 children fantasy series &quot;Arabela&quot; as well as its sequel series &quot;Arabela se vrací&quot;, performed respectively by actors František Peterka and Pavel Nový. In this version, he does not perform a villain&#x27;s role, but becomes an ally and friend of the protagonists. Fantômas also has a cameo appearance in the Czech children&#x27;s series &quot;Lucie, postrach ulice&quot; as a TV character, where he resembles his original 1911 book serial covers&#x27; depiction.

===Unproduced and upcoming screen adaptations===
In May 2010, Christophe Gans was revealed to be co-writing and directing a new film version of &quot;Fantômas&quot;, with Vincent Cassel and Jean Reno attached to star. Cassel later dropped out, and the film ultimately went unmade.

In August 2022, Wassim Béji and production company SND acquired the adaptation rights to &quot;Fantômas&quot;, and are planning both a new film and a series, which is said to return to the character&#x27;s darker roots.

==Comic books==
===French===
* &quot;Fantômas contre les Nains&quot;, a weekly color page written by Marcel Allain and drawn by Santini was published in &quot;Gavroche&quot; #24-30 (1941). This series was interrupted because of censorship; a sequel, &quot;Fantômas et l&#x27;Enfer Sous-Marin&quot; was written but not published.
* A daily &quot;Fantômas&quot; strip drawn by Pierre Tabary was syndicated by Opera Mundi from November 1957 to March 1958 (192 strips in total), adapting the first two novels.
* Seventeen &quot;Fantômas&quot; fumetti magazines adapting books 1, 2, 3, and 5 were published by Del Duca in 1962 and 1963.
* A new weekly &quot;Fantômas&quot; color page, written by Agnès Guilloteau and drawn by Jacques Taillefer, was again syndicated by Opera Mundi in 1969 and published in &quot;Jours de France&quot;.
* Finally, a series of &quot;Fantômas&quot; graphic novels written by L. Dellisse and drawn by Claude Laverdure were published by Belgian publisher Claude Lefrancq: &quot;L&#x27;Affaire Beltham&quot; (1990), &quot;Juve contre Fantômas&quot; (1991), and &quot;Le Mort qui Tue&quot; (1995).

===Mexican===
During the 1960s the Mexican comics publisher Editorial Novaro produced a &quot;Fantomas, La Amenaza Elegante&quot; (&quot;Fantomas, the Elegant Menace&quot;) comic book series that became popular throughout Latin America. This was apparently meant to be the same character, although rewritten as a hero, perhaps as a way to make the original French character more attuned to Latin American audiences who crave justice avengers in fiction and national politics. It is not known if this was done with or without legal permission.

This Fantômas was a thief who committed spectacular robberies just for the thrill of it, and wore a white skintight mask all the time or a variety of disguises so his true face was never shown to his nemeses. The character was also pursued by the authorities, in his case mainly by a French police inspector named Gerard. His mask in the Latin American version – which was clearly inspired by the black mask worn by the Italian comic book criminal &quot;Diabolik&quot; — and his use of it, seems to have been influenced by the popular images generated by Mexican wrestling.

Apparently the series was also influenced by the &quot;James Bond&quot; films, as Fantômas, equipped with advanced technology created by a scientist called Professor Semo, had all kind of adventures around the world, and even fought other, more cruel criminals. The Latin American Fantômas, created in Mexico, encompassed the aesthetic of both the British James Bond and American Hugh Hefner, who created &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, with a necessary dose of traditional Latin American machismo. This mixture immediately gained traction with vast Latino audiences, mostly prepubescent and adolescents males.

Latino Fantômas was also a millionaire, owning several corporations under assumed identities, had secret headquarters outside Paris, and was assisted by several secret agents, including the 12 &quot;Zodiac Girls&quot;, beautiful women who assisted him personally and dressed provocatively, known only by their codenames – the signs of the zodiac. The attractive female element was another concession to Latin American audiences familiar with beautiful women as part of male-dominated environments playing key roles without hiding their femininity, and preceding Charlie&#x27;s Angels by decades.

Although cancelled years ago (Novaro folded in 1985, and a character revival by rival Grupo Editorial Vid in Mexico in the 1990s did not last long), it is from this Mexican comic that the character is best known in both Central America and South America. Fantômas continues to be one of Latin America&#x27;s favorite comic characters.

===American===
A &quot;Fantômas&quot; short story by Paul Kupperberg and Roy Mann appeared in &quot;Captain Action Comics&quot; No. 1, published in 2009 by Moonstone Books.

===Polish===
The 1979 Polish edition of the novella &quot;Fantomas contra los vampiros multinacionales&quot; by Julio Cortázar, published as &quot;Fantomas przeciw wielonarodowym wampirom&quot; (&quot;Fantomas Against the Multinational Vampires&quot;) featured a series of illustrations by painter Jerzy Skarżyński, which formed a mini-comic book about Fantômas, largely independent from the plot of the novella. Fantômas&#x27;s depiction in the comic was based on the appearance of Jean Marais in the 1964 film.

==New fiction==
&quot;Yes Virginia, There is a Fantomas&quot; by William Patrick Maynard was published in &quot;Tales of the Shadowmen&quot; Volume 6, published in 2009 by Black Coat Press. Fantomas has appeared in several stories in the series.

The first third of the novella, &quot;Reign of Terror&quot; by R. Allen Leider was published in &quot;Awesome Tales&quot; No. 3, published in 2016 by Bold Venture Press. The second third of the novella was published in &quot;Awesome Tales&quot; No. 9, with the final third coming.

==Cultural influence==
The &quot;Fantômas&quot; novels and the subsequent films were highly regarded by the French avant-garde of the day, particularly by the surrealists. Blaise Cendrars called the series &quot;the modern Aeneid&quot;; Guillaume Apollinaire said that &quot;from the imaginative standpoint &quot;Fantômas&quot; is one of the richest works that exist&quot;. The painter René Magritte, the surrealist poet and novelist Robert Desnos and the cubist painter Juan Gris produced works alluding to Fantômas.

The films were also popular in the Soviet Union. After their success Fantômas had a short appearance in two popular Soviet comedies: &quot;Seven Old Men and One Girl&quot; (1968) and &quot;Grandads-Robbers&quot; (1972). In 2007, Russian author Andrey Shary published the book &quot;Sign F: Fantomas in Books and on the Screen&quot;, dealing in particular with this phenomenon.

In October 2021, Kanye West was seen wearing a Fantômas-style mask while at the Berlin Brandenburg Airport.

==Pastiches, homages, and related characters==
* &quot;Fantômas&quot; may well have been influenced by its less well remembered predecessor, &quot;Zigomar&quot;, the creation of Léon Sazie, which first appeared as a serial in &quot;Le Matin&quot; in 1909, then as a pulp magazine (28 issues) in 1913, and again in &quot;Zigomar contre Zigomar&quot; for eight more issues in 1924.
* In France alone, Fantômas spawned numerous imitators. Among those are Arnould Galopin&#x27;s &quot;Tenebras&quot;, Gaston René&#x27;s &quot;Masque Rouge&quot;, Arthur Bernède&#x27;s &quot;Belphégor&quot;, R. Collard&#x27;s &quot;Demonax&quot; and Marcel Allain&#x27;s own &quot;Tigris&quot;, &quot;Fatala&quot;, &quot;Miss Teria&quot; and &quot;Ferocias&quot;.
* The 1915 adventure film &quot;Filibus&quot; was probably inspired largely by the popularity of &quot;Fantômas&quot;, although the film&#x27;s title character, a female air pirate, strongly resembles Arsène Lupin.
* After the success of the first &quot;Fantômas&quot; film serial directed by Louis Feuillade, Gaumont produced another serial directed by Feuillade in the same style, &quot;Les Vampires&quot;, about a gang of criminals. As Feuillade had been criticized for glorifying outlaws, his next serial for Gaumont, &quot;Judex&quot;, starred this time a positive hero, a mysterious avenger conceived as an honest version of Fantômas. Judex was himself featured in various adaptations, sequels and remakes. The original &quot;Judex&quot; serial was released in the United States and appears to have been an inspiration for the American pulp character The Shadow, who was himself an inspiration for Batman.
* Fantômas has appeared in an unauthorized fashion in two French stage plays: &quot;Nick Carter vs. Fantômas&quot; (1910) by Alexandre Bisson and Guillaume Livet (translated, ) and &quot;Sherlock Holmes vs. Fantômas&quot; (&quot;La Mort d&#x27; Herlock Sholmes, ou Bandits en Habits Noirs&quot;, 1914) by Pierre de Wattyne and Yorril Walter (translated, ).
* A number of Italian dark villains of the 1960s were clearly influenced by Fantômas. Among the most famous are Diabolik, Kriminal, Killing, and Satanik.
* The British film critic and writer Kim Newman has argued that &quot;Fantômas&quot; inspired the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; film series starring Peter Sellers. In the initial 1963 &quot;Pink Panther&quot; film, Fantômas was transformed into Sir Charles Lytton (the Phantom), and Inspector Juve became Inspector Clouseau. The Phantom&#x27;s aversion to killing places him closer to Arsène Lupin.
* One of the antagonists on &quot;Lupin III Part 2&quot; is Fantomas the Third, who is depicted as a terrorist with a gremlin-like appearance inspired by Jean Marais&#x27; version, who threatens to flood the world unless Lupin hands over a precious ruby in his possession.
* &quot;Fantômas&quot; also has many plot points in common with the 1969 Hong Kong film &quot;Temptress of a Thousand Faces&quot;.
* Paperinik (Duck Avenger) alter-ego of Donald Duck created by Guido Martina and Giovan Battista Carpi in 1969, is partly based on Fantômas. His predecessor, Fantomius (Fantomallard) was obviously also named after Fantômas. In France, the character is known as Fantomiald; in Germany as Phantomias; in Greek as Phantom Duck and in Spain as Patomas.
* &quot;Fantômas&quot; inspired Julio Cortázar&#x27;s 1975 novella &quot;Fantomas Contra Los Vampiros Multinacionales&quot;.
* A character in the Doctor Who novel &quot;The Man in the Velvet Mask&quot; (1996) is named Fantômas.
* &quot;Fantomas&quot; was the inspiration for the character Mr. Ixnay, who appears in &quot;The Chuckling Whatsit&quot;, a 1997 graphic novel by writer/artist Richard Sala, creator of &quot;Invisible Hands&quot;, an animated homage to old-fashioned mystery thrillers which aired on MTV.
* In 1999, Faith No More singer Mike Patton named his metal group Fantômas after the fictional character.
* There is a Marvel Comics character named Fantomex, first appearing in August 2002. He was created by Grant Morrison and Igor Kordey for the title &quot;New X-Men&quot;.
* In one of the back-story sections of the graphic novel &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II&quot;, Fantômas is described as being a member of &quot;Les Hommes Mystérieux&quot;, the French counterpart of the League, alongside Arsène Lupin, the sky-pirate Robur, and the Nyctalope. In the follow-up, &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot;, the League&#x27;s encounter with Les Hommes is halted once Fantômas detonates a bomb which destroys the Opera Garnier, after saying in unaccented English, &quot;I win&quot;.
* The character of Spectrobert in Gahan Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Favorite Duck&quot; is a direct parody of Fantômas.
* Fantômas is a partial inspiration for the character of Phantom Limb on the Adult Swim cartoon &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; His last name, in fact, is Fantômas. A picture similar in appearance to the masked villain can be seen hanging on the wall of his office at State University in &quot;The Invisible Hand of Fate&quot;. It is revealed that Phantom Limb is actually the grandson of the famous criminal. Fantômas himself briefly appears in the series during a flashback in the season 3 episode &quot;ORB&quot; as one of the original members of &quot;The Guild,&quot; a precursor of the Guild of Calamitous Intent.
* Fantômas has a German cousin in the person of the (supposedly British) Lord Lister.
* In the story &quot;Fantômville&quot; by Nick Campbell, in the book &quot;Wildthyme in Purple&quot;, Fantomas meets the time traveller Iris Wildthyme.
* In the film adaptation of Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, the Fantom (a character resembling the title character from &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;) owes more than a little to Fantômas, although he is ultimately revealed to be M, who in turn is revealed to be Professor Moriarty.
* In the Egyptian film, &quot;Romantic Chase&quot;, produced in 1968, Fantômas is played by Egyptian actor Hasan Mustafa. The role of Fantômas is a butler that wants to steal all the money of his employer. The film itself is an adaptation of &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; which was produced in 1965.
* In the Czech Fantasy 1980 TV series &quot;Arabela&quot; and the 1993 sequel &quot;Arabela Returns (Arabela se vrací)&quot;, the French movie version of Fantomas is the leader of the World of Fairy Tales for Adults.

<text>Bunhill Fields is a former burial ground in central London, in the London Borough of Islington, just north of the City of London. What remains is about in extent and the bulk of the site is a public garden maintained by the City of London Corporation.

It was first in devoted use as a burial ground from 1665 until 1854, in which period approximately 123,000 interments were estimated to have taken place. Over 2,000 monuments remain, for the most part in concentrated blocks. It was a prototype of land-use protected, nondenominational grounds, and was particularly favoured by nonconformists who passed their final years in the region. It contains the graves of many notable people, including John Bunyan (died 1688), author of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;; Daniel Defoe (died 1731), author of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;; William Blake (died 1827), artist, poet, and mystic; Susanna Wesley (died 1742), known as the &quot;Mother of Methodism&quot; through her education of sons John and Charles; Thomas Bayes (died 1761), statistician and philosopher; Isaac Watts (died 1748), the &quot;Father of English Hymnody&quot;; and Thomas Newcomen (died 1729), steam engine pioneer.
Bunhill Fields Burial Ground is listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. It is now maintained by the Friends of the City Gardens.

Nearby, on the west side of Bunhill Row and behind the residential tower Braithwaite House, is a former Quaker burial ground, in use from 1661 to 1855, at times also known as Bunhill Fields. George Fox (died 1691), one of the founders of the movement, is among those buried there. Its remains are also a public garden, Quaker Gardens, managed by the London Borough of Islington.

==Historical background==
Bunhill Fields was part of the Manor of Finsbury (originally Fensbury), which has its origins as the prebend of Halliwell and Finsbury, belonging to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and established in 1104. In 1315 the prebendary manor was granted by Archdeacon Robert Baldock to the Mayor and commonalty of London. This enabled more general public access to the semi-fen or moor stretching from the City of London&#x27;s boundary (London Wall), to the village of Hoxton.

In 1498 part of the otherwise unenclosed landscape was set aside to form a large field for military exercises of archers and others. This part of the manor has sports and occasional military use: Artillery Ground.

Next to this lies Bunhill Fields. The name derives from &quot;Bone hill&quot;, likely linked to occasional burials from at least Saxon times, but more probably derives from the use for mass-deposit for human bones—amounting to over 1,000 cartloads—brought from St Paul&#x27;s charnel house in 1549 (when that building was demolished). The dried bones were deposited on the moor and capped with a thin layer of soil. This built up a hill across the otherwise damp, flat fens, such that three windmills could safely be erected in a spot that came to be one of the many windmill hills.

==Opening as a burial ground==
In keeping with this tradition, in 1665 the City of London Corporation decided to use some of the land as a common burial ground for the interment of bodies of inhabitants who had died of the plague and could not be accommodated in the churchyards. Outer walls were completed but Church of England officials never consecrated the ground nor used it for burials. A Mr. Tindal took over the lease.

He allowed extramural graveyard burials in what was unconsecrated soil, thus popular with nonconformists—those Protestant Christians who practised their faiths outside the Church of England; unlike Anglican churchyards it was open for interment to anyone who could afford the fees. It appears on Rocque&#x27;s Map of London of 1746, and elsewhere, as &quot;Tindal&#x27;s Burying Ground&quot;.

An inscription at the eastern entrance gate to the burial ground reads: &quot;This church-yard was inclosed with a brick wall at the sole charges of the City of London, in the mayoralty of Sir John Lawrence, , Anno Domini 1665; and afterwards the gates thereof were built and finished in the mayoralty of Sir Thomas Bloudworth, Knt., Anno Domini, 1666.&quot; The present gates and inscription date from 1868, but the wording follows that of an original 17th-century inscription at the western entrance, now lost.

The earliest recorded monumental inscription was that to &quot;Grace, daughter of T. Cloudesly, of Leeds. February 1666&quot;. The earliest surviving monument is believed to be the headstone to Theophilus Gale: the inscription reads &quot;Theophilus Gale MA / Born 1628 / Died 1678&quot;.

In 1769 an Act of Parliament gave the corporation the right to continue the lease for 99 years. The City authorities continued to let the ground to their tenant as a burial ground; in 1781 the Corporation decided to take over management of the burial ground.

So many historically important Protestant nonconformists chose this as their place of interment that the 19th-century poet and writer Robert Southey characterised Bunhill Fields in 1830 as the ground &quot;which the Dissenters regard as their Campo Santo&quot;. This term was applied to its &quot;daughter&quot;, Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington.

==Closure as a burial ground==

In 1852 the Burial Act was passed which enabled grounds to be closed once they became full. An Order for Closure for Bunhill Fields was made in December 1853, and the final burial (that of Elizabeth Howell Oliver) took place on 5 January 1854. Occasional interments continued to be permitted in existing vaults or graves: the final burial of this kind is believed to have been that of a Mrs. Gabriel of Brixton in February 1860. By this date approximately 123,000 interments had taken place in the burial ground.

Two decades before, a group of City nonconformists led by George Collison bought a site for a new landscaped alternative, at part of Abney Park in Stoke Newington. This was named Abney Park Cemetery and opened in 1840. All parts were available for the burial of any person, regardless of religious creed. It preceded Brookwood Cemetery as the prototype of many cemeteries to come nationally with &quot;no invidious dividing lines&quot;. It has a unique nondenominational chapel, designed by William Hosking.

==Community garden==

Upon closure of the Bunhill Fields Burial Ground, its future was uncertain as its lessee, the City of London Corporation, was close to expiry of its lease, scheduled for Christmas 1867. To prevent the land from being redeveloped by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners (who controlled the freehold) at this expiry, the Corporation formed the Special Bunhill Fields Burial Ground Committee in 1865. This became formally known as the Bunhill Fields Preservation Committee.

Appointed by the corporation, it consisted of twelve advisors under the chairmanship of Charles Reed, FSA (son of the Congregational philanthropist Andrew Reed). He later rose to prominence as the first Member of Parliament (MP) for Hackney and chairman of the first School Board for London before being knighted. Along with his interest in making it into a parkland landscape, he was similarly interested in the wider educational and public benefits of Abney Park Cemetery, of which he was a prominent director.

To corroborate the committee&#x27;s work, the Corporation obtained an Act of Parliament, the Bunhill Fields Burial Ground Act 1867, &quot;for the Preservation of Bunhill Fields Burial Ground ... as an open space&quot;. The legislation enabled them to continue to maintain the site when possession would have otherwise reverted to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, provided it was laid out as a public open space with seating, gardens, and some of its most worthy monuments were restored. The improvements, which included the laying out of walks and paths, cost an estimated £3,500. The new park was opened by the Lord Mayor, James Clarke Lawrence, on 14 October 1869.

The ground was severely damaged by German bombing during World War II; it is believed to have hosted an anti-aircraft gun during the Blitz. In the 1950s, after some debate, the City ordered: to clear the northern third (the projection) of the site of most of its monuments to open it as a public garden; and to preserve and protect the rest behind railings. Legislation in 1960 gave the freehold to the city (the corporation), which continues to maintain the grounds. Landscaping was designed and overseen by the architect and landscape architect Peter Shepheard in 1964–65.

==Bunyan, Defoe and Blake==
The best-known monuments are those to the three literary and artistic figures, John Bunyan, Daniel Defoe and William Blake. Their graves have long been sites of cultural pilgrimage: Isabella Holmes stated in 1896 that the &quot;most frequented paths&quot; in the burial ground were those leading to the monuments of Bunyan and Defoe. In their present form, all these monuments post-date the closure of the burial ground. Their settings were further radically modified by the landscaping of 1964–65, when a paved north–south &quot;broadwalk&quot; was created in the middle of the burial ground to display them—outside the railed-off areas, accessible to visitors, and cleared of other monuments. Bunyan&#x27;s monument lies at the broadwalk&#x27;s southern end, and that to Defoe at its northern end, while Blake&#x27;s headstone was moved from the site of his grave and repositioned next to Defoe, alongside the headstone to the lesser-known Joseph Swain (died 1796). This arrangement survives, but in 2018 a second monument to Blake was placed on the actual site of his grave.

===John Bunyan===
John Bunyan, author of &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, died in August 1688. He was initially buried in the &quot;Baptist Corner&quot; at the back of the burial ground, on the understanding that his remains would be moved into the family vault of his friend John Strudwick when that was next opened for a burial. There is no certain evidence as to when (or even if) this was done: the probability, however, is that it occurred when Strudwick himself died in 1695, and certainly Bunyan&#x27;s name was inscribed on the side of the monument. The Strudwick monument took the form of a large Baroque stone chest. By the 19th century, this had fallen into decay, but in the period following the closure of the burial ground a public appeal for its restoration was launched under the presidency of the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury. This work was completed in May 1862, and comprised a complete reconstruction of the monument, undertaken by the sculptor Edgar George Papworth Senior (1809–1866). Although Papworth retained the basic form of the tomb-chest, he added a recumbent effigy of Bunyan to the top of it, and two relief panels to its sides depicting scenes from &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. The monument was further restored in 1928 (the tercentenary of Bunyan&#x27;s birth), and again after World War II (following serious wartime damage to the effigy&#x27;s face).

===Daniel Defoe===

Daniel Defoe, author of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, died in April 1731 and was buried in Bunhill Fields: his wife, Mary, died in December 1732 and was laid to rest beside him. His daughter-in-law was also buried in the same grave. Defoe died in poverty, and the grave was marked with a simple headstone. In the winter of 1857/8 – at a time when the burial ground was closed and neglected—the grave was struck by lightning and the headstone broken. In 1869, James Clarke, editor of the &quot;Christian World&quot; children&#x27;s newspaper, launched an appeal for subscriptions to place a more suitable memorial on the grave. He encouraged his readers to make donations of sixpence each; and to stimulate enthusiasm opened two lists, one for boys and one for girls, to encourage a spirit of competition between them. Many adults also made donations. In the end, some 1,700 subscriptions raised a total of about £200. A design for a marble obelisk (or &quot;Cleopatric pillar&quot;) was commissioned from C. C. Creeke; and the sculptor Samuel Horner of Bournemouth was commissioned to execute it. In late 1869, when the foundations were being dug, skeletons were disinterred, and there was an unseemly rush for souvenirs by the crowd of onlookers: the police had to be called before calm was restored. The monument was unveiled at a ceremony attended by three of Defoe&#x27;s great-granddaughters on 16 September 1870.

===William Blake===
William Blake died in August 1827 and was buried in the northern part of the burial ground. His wife, Catherine Sophia, died in October 1831 and was buried in a separate grave on the south side of the ground. By the 20th century, Blake&#x27;s grave was in disrepair; and in 1927, for the centenary of his death and at a time when his reputation was on the rise, a new headstone was commissioned. As it had been decided to commemorate both William and Catherine, despite the fact that the headstone would stand at some distance from Catherine&#x27;s grave, the inscription was phrased as &quot;Near by lie the remains of ...&quot;. When Bunhill Fields was relandscaped in the 1960s, Blake&#x27;s grave lay in the area that was to be cleared of monuments. The headstone was therefore moved approximately 20 metres (yards) to its present location, next to the monument to Daniel Defoe. It was also rotated through 90°, so that it now faces south rather than west. Joseph Swain&#x27;s headstone was added to the grouping at the same time, although that faces west. Flowers, coins and other tokens are regularly left by visitors to Blake&#x27;s headstone.

In 2006–07, members of the group The Friends of William Blake established the original location of his grave, and proposed placing a new memorial there. In the form of a ledger stone, with lettering by Lida Cardozo Kindersley, this was finally unveiled on 12 August 2018 by Philip Pullman, President of the Blake Society.

==Records==
Burial ground registers, from 1713 to 1854, are held at The National Archives at Kew. Other records, including interment order books dating from 1789 to 1854, and a list of the legible monument/headstone inscriptions in 1869, are held at London Metropolitan Archives.

Baptist minister John Rippon—who was himself buried at the site in 1836—made transcripts of its monumental inscriptions in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, some copied while &quot;laying on his side&quot;. In 1803 he issued a prospectus for a six-volume publication on Bunhill Fields, but this never came to fruition. The British Library now holds 14 manuscript volumes of his transcripts; a further six volumes are held in the College of Arms.

<text>Millstones or mill stones are stones used in gristmills, used for triturating, crushing or, more specifically, grinding wheat or other grains. They are sometimes referred to as grindstones or grinding stones.

Millstones come in pairs: a stationary base with a rim known as the bedstone (or nether millstone) and a -rimmed runner stone that rotates. The movement of the runner on top of the bedstone creates a &quot;scissoring&quot; action that grinds grain trapped between the stones. Millstones are constructed so that their shape and configuration help to channel ground flour to the outer edges of the mechanism for collection.

The runner stone is supported by a cross-shaped metal piece (millrind or rynd) fixed to a &quot;mace head&quot; topping the main shaft or spindle leading to the driving mechanism of the mill (wind, water (including tide), or other means).

== History ==

=== The origins of an industry ===
Often referred to as the &quot;oldest industry&quot;, the use of the millstone is inextricably linked to human history. Integrated into food processes since the Upper Palaeolithic, its use remained constant until the end of the 19th century, when it was gradually replaced by a new type of metal tool. However, it can still be seen in rural domestic installations, such as in India, where 300 million women used hand mills daily to produce flour in 2002.
The earliest evidence for stones used to grind food is found in northern Australia, at the Madjedbebe rock shelter in Arnhem Land, dating back around 60,000 years. Grinding stones or grindstones, as they were called, were used by the Aboriginal peoples across the continent and islands, and they were traded in areas where suitable sandstone was not available in abundance. Different stones were adapted for grinding different things and varied according to location. One important use was for foods, in particular to grind seeds to make bread, but stones were also adapted for grinding specific types of starchy nuts, ochres for artwork, plant fibres for string, or plants for use in bush medicine, and are still used today. The Australian grindstones usually comprise a large flat sandstone rock (for its abrasive qualities), used with a top stone, known as a &quot;muller&quot;, &quot;pounder&quot;, or pestle. The Aboriginal peoples of the present state of Victoria used grinding stones to crush roots, bulbs, tubers, and berries, as well as insects, small mammals, and reptiles before cooking them.

=== In Ancient history ===

Careful examination of Paleolithic grinders (pebbles, wheels, mortar and pestle, etc.) enables us to determine the nature of the action exerted on the material and the gesture performed; the function of the tool can then be specified, as well as the activity in which it participated.

Neanderthal people were already using rudimentary tools to crush various substances, as attested by the presence of rudimentary grinders at the end of the Mousterian and millstones in the Châtelperronian. From the Aurignacian period onwards (around 38,000 years ago), Cro-Magnon man regularly used millstones, elongated grinders, and circular wheels. From the Gravettian period onwards (circa 29,000 years), this equipment became more diversified, with the appearance of new types of tools such as millstones and pestle grinders.

At the end of the Palaeolithic, millstones from Wadi Kubbaniya (Middle East, 19,000 B.C.) were involved in dietary processes and associated with residues of tuberous plants, which were known to require grinding before consumption, either to extract their toxins (&quot;Cyperus rotundus&quot;, nutsedge), or to remove the fibrous texture that would make them indigestible (&quot;Scirpus maritimus&quot;). The rhizomes of ferns and the peel of the fruit of the doum palm, also found on this site, benefit from being ground to improve their nutritional qualities; they thus complemented the meat diet of hunter-gatherers. Grinding barley or oat seeds was practiced at the end of the Upper Palaeolithic (Franchthi) or the Kebarian (Ohalo II, 19,000 BC).

As tools improved, the material was increasingly finely ground, but only when it became a real powder could we speak of grinding. Thus, the men of the European Upper Paleolithic were already dissociating &quot;grinding&quot; and &quot;milling&quot;, as attested by the appearance at this time of the first &quot;grinding slabs&quot; used with grinders or millstones. While there is no evidence of the milling of wild cereals in the early Upper Paleolithic, at least in Europe, there is no reason not to believe that other plant matter (acorns, nuts, hazelnuts, etc.) and animal matter (fat) were already being ground into paste before cooking. Similarly, it&#x27;s likely that millstones were being used at this time for technical purposes, to crush mineral substances (dyes) and certain plant or animal fibers for technical use.

In the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras, with the domestication of plants, much larger, fully formed grinding, pounding, and milling equipment appeared. From the Natufian onwards, several types of millstones can be found side by side, such as the deep &quot;trough-shaped&quot; millstone or the flat millstone, indicating a specialization of their function. In the Near East, the pestle-grinder began to be developed in the Kebarian and Natufian periods. It gradually evolved into the heavy, generally wooden, thrown pestle. This type of equipment is still used today in many regions, such as in Ethiopia for milling millet.

The appearance of flat, elongated millstones in the Natoufian period (Abu Hureïra on the Euphrates) dates back to the 9th millennium BC. They feature larger active surfaces and mark the emergence of a new gesture, that of grinding from front to back, with both hands, which implies a new posture for the body, kneeling in front of the millstone. The appearance of large, asymmetrical, shaped millstones (Mureybet, Sheikh Hassan, circa 10,000 BP) led to the &quot;saddle-shaped&quot; millstones still known today as the metate.

=== In the rest of the world ===

At the Tell Abu Hureyra archaeological site, as early as the 8th millennium BC, women&#x27;s skeletons show traces of osteoarthritis in the knees, spinal deformity and deformation of the first metatarsal, pathologies associated with long periods of bending while grinding, supporting the theory that early humans practiced a sexual division of labor.

In India, millstone (&quot;Chakki&quot;) were used to grind grains and spices. These consist of a stationary stone cylinder upon which a smaller stone cylinder rotates. Smaller ones, for household use, were operated by two people. Larger ones, for community or commercial use, used livestock to rotate the upper cylinder. Today a majority of the stone flour mills (Atta Chakki) are equipped with lower stone rotating and upper stone stationary millstones also called Shikhar Emery Stones which are made from abrasive emery grains and grits, with a binding agent similar to Sorel Cement. These stones are made from two types of emery abrasives - Natural Jaspar Red Emery or Synthetic Calcined Bauxite Black Emery.
In Korea, there were three different millstones, each made from different materials, serving other purposes, such as threshing, grinding, and producing starch. Generally, the handle of a millstone in Korea was made from an ash tree, the process for making a handle from the ash tree was known as &quot;Mulpure-namu&quot;. To ensure that everything is &quot;all right&quot; with the creation of a millstone, a mason within ancient Kora offered food and alcohol in a ritual. 

Millstones were introduced to Britain by the Romans during the 1st century AD and were widely used there from the 3rd century AD onwards.

In 1932-1933 in Ukraine, during the man-made famine known as Holodomor, the Soviet authorities prohibited the use of millstones, claiming that a millstone is a &quot;mechanism for enrichment&quot; (which was a negative term in Soviet communist ideology). This forced Ukrainian villagers to hide their manually-operated millstones and use them secretly during the famine. In response, Soviet authorities regularly searched villages for &quot;illegal&quot; millstones and destroyed them. In 2007, the people of Victorivka village in Cherkasy Oblast built a monument using the millstones they had managed to hide and save from the Soviet plunder during the Holodomor.

== Different techniques: grinding, crushing, milling ==
The preparation of vegetable products (roots, tubers, almonds, leaves, etc.), animal products (marrow, tendons, etc.), or mineral products (ochre) by grinding or milling, for consumption or technical use, has existed for several dozen millennia. Unlike crushing, in which a hard envelope such as a shell or bone is broken open to recover its contents, in this case, the aim is to reduce a much softer material to a powder or paste.

Depending on the place and time, millstones were used for &quot;dry&quot; grinding: in the manufacture of flour, sugar, or spices, but also for the preparation of kaolinite, cement, phosphate, lime, enamel, fertilizer, and other minerals. The milling operation can also be carried out &quot;wet&quot;, as in the case of durum wheat semolina, nixtamal, or the grinding of mustard seeds. During preparation, some raw materials produce a naturally fluid paste, as in olive crushing or cocoa grinding.

In his typology of percussion, André Leroi-Gourhan defines several families of gestures, three of which are essential for the preparation of raw materials:

# &quot;Crushing gestures&quot; involve vertical percussion using a heavy, elongated object in the manner of the African pestle. This gesture is also used by the trip hammer to make paper pulp, or in forging;
# &quot;Milling gestures&quot;, using percussion, which are performed in a circular, disordered, or back-and-forth motion on a millstone;
# &quot;Grinding gestures&quot;, in which the movements are roughly circular and occasionally vertical, thus combining a thrown percussion and a percussion posed, are qualified here as diffuse. This is the case with the contemporary mortar-pestle system.
== Milling systems ==
Until the invention of the watermill, mills operated using &quot;strength-powered&quot;, i.e. the force of animals or people.
=== The metate ===

The &quot;metate&quot; is a nether millstone for domestic use, for grinding corn. It has been used for several thousand years (around 3000 BC) in the cultural area of Mesoamerica, and its name comes from the Nahuatl &quot;metatl&quot;.

Today&#x27;s millstones are monolithic, usually made of basalt, apodous, or tripod, rectangular, and slightly concave on the grinding surface. These millstones are associated with a two-handed wheel, called a &quot;mano&quot;, whose size generally exceeds the width of the millstone and which is driven in an alternating rectilinear motion. On tripod wheels, one of the legs is slightly higher than the other two, giving the whole unit an inclination, with the user standing in front of the highest part.

The manufacture of millstones was essentially a male occupation. In pre-Hispanic times, millers used only stone tools, a practice that persisted in some villages until the mid-20th century. The use of metal tools, probably inherited from building stonemasons, made it possible to use the hardest basalts, resulting in millstones with a lifespan of over thirty years. While the manufacture of apod millstones from blocks of stone naturally polished in a riverbed was once within the reach of many farmers, the production of tripode metates requires specialized craftsmanship.

Grinding plays a key role in Mexican cuisine. Dry grinding is possible, but very few recipes are produced in this way: roasted coffee, roasted corn or beans, salt, sugar loaves, and cocoa are ground into powder. But most preparations require grinding with water. Fruits are ground into juices, beans or boiled vegetables, ingredients are added to various spicy sauces and, above all, corn is used to make the tortillas that form the basis of every meal. The latter are made from nixtamal, i.e. dry corn kernels cooked with lime, then rinsed with water, which softens the kernels and produces a paste. Maize or nixtamal can be ground for preparations other than patties: &quot;tamales, pozole, atole, pinole&quot;, and &quot;masa&quot;, with variations in the fineness of the grind depending on the use.

The metate was used exclusively by women, and in Mixtec lands, the place where the millstone is located was a space reserved for women. A couple often acquires, or is given, a millstone when they set up home. This acquisition represents a major expense in the life of a Mixtec peasant, as evidenced by the wills of nobles and wealthy peasants from the 16th to 18th centuries, which included metates.

Daily tortillas are made from sufficiently moistened &quot;corn dough&quot;, which, unlike flour, cannot be preserved. This technical characteristic no doubt explains why domestic metates were not replaced centuries ago by mills, as they were in Europe. During the wars of the 19th century and the Mexican Revolution of 1910, Mexican armies were accompanied by women and metates to ensure the stewardship of the country; the Spanish conquest did not replace tortillas with bread - quite the contrary. At the end of the 19th century, the owners of the large plantations introduced motorized corn mills, which freed up female labor for the fields. From 1920 onwards, electric mills appeared in the countryside, owned by municipalities, cooperatives or private individuals. However, still in use today, nether millstones are still part of Mexico&#x27;s rural heritage.

=== The Olynthus mill ===

The town of Olynthus was destroyed in 348 BC by Philip II of Macedonia, and the name &quot;Olynthus millstone, Olynthus grinder, Olynthus mill&quot; has come to be attached to this type of mill, which represents a genuine technical revolution. In 1917, the Greek Konstantinos Kourouniotis elucidated the workings of the hopper millstone, which played an important role in ancient Greece.

In the Olynthus mill, the nether millstone(4) is rectangular, resting on a table (5); it measures between 0.42 m and 0.65 m in length, 0.36 m to 0.54 m in width and 0.08 to 0.25 m in thickness. The grinder, which forms the upper millstone (common millstone (3)), is usually rectangular, sometimes oval, with a central hopper parallel to the long sides, designed to receive the grain to be ground. The mill is capped by a horizontal axle attached to a pivot (1) on one side of the table, the other end being operated by a worker who moves the lever (2) back and forth horizontally. The Olynthus mill thus shows the beginnings of mechanization, with millers now standing on their feet, making work easier.

This type of mill certainly appeared as early as the beginning of the 5th century BC. Its use was widespread throughout the Greek civilization in the 4th century B.C., from Macedonia to the Peloponnese, and was adopted as far afield as the islands of Anatolia, Egypt, and modern-day Syria. It continued into the 1st century B.C., and sometimes even later, as the excavations at the Agora in Athens suggest. The importance of this mill type for the Greek world was confirmed by the discovery, in 1967, of 22 hopper mills in the cargo of a ship wrecked off Kyrenia, dated to the end of the 4th century BC. Increasing demand undoubtedly led to standardization in manufacturing and specialization of production centers. For example, flat Argolidian millstones, made of andesite and rhyolite, were produced from local quarries (Isthmus of Corinth, Saronic Gulf), while grinders came from more distant quarries (islands of Nysiros, Milos).

The use of this type of mill was not limited to grinding cereals, as the finds from Thasos or Lavrio suggest: it was also used to grind ore, so as to calibrate it for subsequent selection by washing. It may even have appeared in the mines of Pangaion Hills. The text by Agatharchides on the gold mines of Egypt in the 1st century B.C., transmitted by Photios and Diodorus, mentions a mill with a lever:

&quot;Women and older men then receive this ore crushed to the size of peas, throw it into the millstones, in numerous lines, two or three people standing at each lever and grind it.&quot; Photius&#x27; version specifies &quot;on either side&quot; of the lever.

=== The rotating millstone ===

This rotating millstone was spin by many ladies. The millstones name changes in many different parts of India. This is because there are so many different languages. The parts though will still stay the same.

It&#x27;s also known as a &quot;hand millstone&quot;, &quot;arm millstone&quot; or &quot;moulinet&quot;, and in Latin as a &quot;&quot;molendinum bracchis&quot; or &quot;molendinum manuale&quot;&quot;.

According to de Barry, the oldest circular stone millstone was unearthed in the ruins of the town of Olynthus: it was the millstone of an oil mill, not a flour mill. Historians Marie-Claire Amouretti and Georges Comet point out that these millstones pre-date the earliest known examples of circular grain mills. So it was probably through oil production that the first rotary crushing machine was introduced. Cereals and other fruits and seeds followed.
The oldest rotating millstone are thought to have originated in Spain 2,500 years ago(600 BC - 400 BC). It seems that the rotating millstone spread at the end of the 5th century BC from Spain, and that it was directly derived from attempts to perfect the Olynthus mill. André Leroi-Gourhan states that &quot;&quot;the transformation of rectilinear reciprocating motion into circular-continuous motion leads to another form of milling&quot;. Some authors do not agree on its geographical origin, located for some &quot;towards Carthage and the Syrian-Egyptian region&quot;, &quot;simultaneously in Spain and England&quot;&quot; for others, and even though it was found in China in the 1st century BC. According to L.A. Moritz, the rotating grain mill only appeared in the first century BC. He bases his demonstration on Latin texts, in particular those of Plautus and Cato, and fixes the introduction of this type between the time of Plautus&#x27; death in 184BC and the composition of &quot;De agri cultura&quot;, around 160 BC.

Several types of mills can be identified in Europe, depending on the morphology of the millstones used in these manually operated rotary mills.

The &quot;Celtic mill&quot; is made up of massive millstones, with a conical external profile and virtually flat active stone surfaces.

In Dacia, between the 1st century B.C. and the 1st century A.D., the Celtic mill evolved into an intermediate type with two millstones superimposed and integrated, featuring a three-lobed feed opening. The more sharply tapered inner surfaces of the millstones ensured that the grains flowed more quickly under the effect of gravity, but the quality of the flour obtained remained mediocre. On the other hand, the effort required to operate the current millstone is considerable. The profile of the millstones makes them more difficult to cut, imposes a standardization of the millstones, and explains their diffusion and maintenance in a given region. Some examples feature flatter wheels, with a much reduced taper, which reduces the stone mass. The speed of rotation became higher, providing a greater gyroscopic effect, but also requiring the installation of a system of claws fixed with molten lead on the upper side of the movable wheel, to hold it in place around the pivot.

Romanization led to the widespread use of hand mills, which were perfected in terms of volume by increasing diameter and reducing height and weight. The profile of the millstones became flatter, and a number of improvements were introduced, such as an upper wedge to center the movable wheel on the pivot. A device for adjusting the distance between the millstones (the &quot;anille&quot;) also appeared, enabling grinding quality to be controlled (1st century B.C.), and radii cut into the millstone could accentuate the natural abrasiveness of the stone. Later developments, such as the installation of the double lever or the use of a crank fixed to the center of the millstone (14th - 15th centuries), meant that this type of hand mill was used in the countryside until the 20th century.

Because they wear more quickly, this type of millstone requires a stricter selection of stones, among which basalt has a privileged place. Most of the stone used in Roman times seems to have come from just a few quarries. In France, millstones from Cap d&#x27;Agde supplied Languedoc and Provence; further north, quarries from the Massif Central (Volvic) supplied a vast territory stretching from Aquitaine to the Helvetic valleys; finally, from the Saône valley to the German border, millstones came mainly from Eifel quarries (Mayen).

In Europe as a whole, the hand mill remained the main milling method until the end of Antiquity, and then throughout the Middle Ages; it only began to give way to the advances of water and then wind mills.

=== The Pompeian mill or &quot;blood&quot; mill ===
With a diameter limited to the reach of an arm&#x27;s movement, i.e. 40 to 70 cm, the hand mill could only produce a limited quantity of flour and was therefore essentially reserved for domestic use. By increasing the diameter and, above all, the height of the &quot;meta&quot; (nether millstone) and the &quot;catillus&quot; (runner millstone), the Romans were able to overcome this constraint with the animal-drawn &quot;Pompeian mill&quot;, also known as the &quot;&quot;blood&quot; mill&quot;.

In this mill, the nether millstone is conical at the top and the runner millstone looks like an hourglass, with its lower half covering the conical top of the nether millstone. The upper part of the runner millstone acts as a funnel, and a slight gap is maintained between the two millstones. The running wheel pivots around a wooden axle embedded in the standing wheel, and it is thanks to its suspension on this axle that the gap between the two wheels is ensured. This type of millstone could be powered either by two or four men, or by animal rides, hence its name &quot;mola asinaria&quot;, literally &quot;donkey mill&quot;.

An example of this type of millstone can be found as early as the Classical era, used to grind ore in the Laurion mines, although it did not overtake the less efficient reciprocating millstone. Despite its qualities, it didn&#x27;t really spread throughout the Roman world until later. They were found throughout the Mediterranean basin, but never in very large numbers, except in Italy. Their very high cost - 1,250 denarii in the Late Roman period, compared with 250 denarii for hand millstones - meant that they were only used by millers and bakers. In Gaul, millstones are known from Lyon, Saint-Raphaël, Paris, Amiens and Clermont-Ferrand, all fashioned from basalt from the Eifel, Volvic or Cap d&#x27;Agde.

During the Late Antiquity, the donkey mill retreated, probably disappearing after the 5th century as a result of the expansion of the watermill, then the windmill, except in Sardinia, where it remained until the 20th century.

=== The Roman trapetum ===
The Hellenistic period also saw the appearance of the olive crusher, which the Romans called the &quot;trapetum&quot;. Legend has it that it was invented by Aristaeus, and excavations at Olynthus have revealed examples dating back to the 5th century BC.

The &quot;trapetum&quot; was precisely described by Cato the Elder, who gave us the technical names of all its parts. Excavations at Stabies, Pompeii, the villa at Boscoreale and in Roman Africa show that the system was widely used in ancient Rome and disappeared with it.

The &quot;trapetum&quot; consists of two plano-convex millstones (3, &quot;orbes&quot;), standing vertically, supported by a horizontal axis rotating around a vertical pivot (1, &quot;columella&quot;). This pivot rests on a short stone column (&quot;milliarium&quot;) at the center of a large hemispherical mortar (4). The lying millstone is a stone vat (4, &quot;mortarium&quot;) whose walls follow the external profile of the two common millstones. The orbs can move in a circular motion inside the &quot;mortarium&quot;, and are set in motion by the action of two wooden handles (2, &quot;modioli&quot;). Wooden wedges (&quot;orbiculi&quot;) inserted between the &quot;milliarium&quot; and the &quot;columella&quot; are used to adjust the height of the orbs above the bottom of the vat. In this system, the olives are not crushed under the millstone, but between the millstone and the sides of the vat. As in the previous model, a gap was maintained between the two millstones. The resistance offered by the fruit forces the stone half-spheres to turn slightly on their axis; the two movements combine and the pressure is exerted only moderately, without breaking the stones, which would give bad taste. The resultant pulp could then be subjected to the action of a press to collect the oil.

=== Millstones of southern Morocco ===
A melting pot of African, Eastern and Mediterranean civilizations, Morocco has preserved tools and techniques from different eras.

The Volubilis site, located in Mauritania Tingitana (northeastern Morocco), features grain and olive mills from the Roman period (1st century-2nd century). These mills consist of a truncated cone-shaped standing millstone and a convex grinding ring to which the wooden machinery is connected, apparently operated without the aid of animal power. In this arrangement, the grinding ring is fitted onto the lying millstone. The &quot;Volubilitan olive millstone&quot; differs from the grain millstone by having oblique striations on the truncated surface of the lying millstone and on the inside of the grinding ring. Columella asserts that, to extract the oil, the millstones (&quot;molae&quot;) are more useful than the crusher (&quot;trapetum&quot;), as they can be lowered or raised according to the size of the fruit, so as to avoid crushing the stone.

A second type of olive mill can be found on the same site, and consists of a monolithic vat on which a fluted drum turns around a vertical mast like the section of a column. This type of mill is more common and can be found on many sites, even in recent times.The argan tree is a woodland species endemic to southwest Morocco. The technical environment of the &quot;argan mill&quot; covers its range. It&#x27;s a stone hand mill used to grind roasted kernels and almonds.

It stands out from the grain mill thanks to the truncated cone shape and greater height of its runner millstone (&quot;agurf wuflla&quot;), as well as the presence of a spout (&quot;abajjr&quot; or &quot;tilst&quot;) and a pouring spout (&quot;ils&quot;) on the nether millstone (&quot;agurf u wadday&quot;). At the center of the nether millstone is a short pivot (&quot;tamnrut&quot;) made of argan wood, around which the upper millstone rotates, pierced by an eyelet (&quot;tit n tzrgt&quot;) into which one or two handfuls of kernels are inserted. The circular movement is interrupted to remove the kernels after the millstone has been lifted. The whole unit can be raised on stones welded together in a &quot;bakehouse&quot;-style architecture, allowing embers or argan shells to warm the unit, thus facilitating grinding in winter.

=== Chronology of milling systems ===
Mortars and pestles have survived the centuries and are predominant for barley in Greece, starch in Italy, and millet in Africa. They slowly became marginal in some regions, but did not disappear. In classical times, they were still widely represented in Greece and were still used for hulling cereals, even if the advent of adjustable millstones meant that they could now be ground. The advance of naked wheat, particularly common wheat, in Italy and Egypt made them less useful, but they were still mentioned in the Late Roman Empire, in Roman Egypt, and in the monastic rule of Saint Isidore. With the arrival of maize, they were once again used in certain regions.

A first typology of milling systems can be drawn up according to the driving force used; a complementary approach will look at the social context in which the mechanism is implemented.

According to Diocletian&#x27;s edict, the &quot;blood&quot; mill costed six times more than the hand mill, and the watermill eight times more. The latter therefore competed mainly with the &quot;blood&quot; mill, and took almost three centuries to supplant it. This was also the time it took the &quot;blood&quot; mill to supplant the hopper mill, and the hopper mill to supplant the flat millstone.

It seems that the watermill originated in the Eastern Mediterranean. An inscription from the Phrygian town of Orcistus, which praised the advantages of its site in order to retain its privileges, states that it possesses &quot;thanks to the slope of the waters flowing through it, a large number of watermills&quot;. At the beginning of the Christian era, the watermill was still a novelty in the western Mediterranean, and Vitruvius classed it with irrigation machines. This type of mill proved ill-suited to the design of Pompeian millstones. In Caligula&#x27;s time, &quot;blood&quot; mills were still dominant, as Apuleius describes. Over the course of the 1st and 2nd centuries, the watermill slowly spread to a wide variety of provinces: Brittany, Gaul, and Africa, where the rotary millstone was often more widespread than the Pompeian mill. Over the course of the 4th century, the watermill slowly replaced the &quot;blood&quot; mill in Rome itself, becoming the predominant mill in the 2nd century. While there were some spectacular achievements in cities, such as the Barbegal mill in Arles, the watermill seems to have spread more slowly to rural villas, as Palladius indicates.

We don&#x27;t really know how the Greeks processed their cereals between the 1st and 4th centuries. The &quot;blood&quot; mill was undoubtedly widespread, as attested by the legend of Lucius&#x27; donkey, borrowed by Lucian of Samosata and Apuleius. The coexistence of several types of milling seems to be the rule in the Aegean world, and the codification of Diocletian&#x27;s edict in the 2nd century, which established three types of mills (hand, blood, and water), can still be found in the Byzantine rural code in the 6th century, and even in travellers&#x27; accounts in the 17th century.

In the Mediterranean, watermills, which depended on water supply, progressed especially when they had a complement to avoid the vagaries of the dry season. In this context, windmills undoubtedly contributed to the spread of watermills as early as the 11th century in regions such as Provence and the Greek islands.

=== Other milling systems ===

==== Assembled millstones ====

In a study of millstones in Flanders from the Middle Ages to the French Revolution, Jean Bruggeman points out that medieval millstones were always monolithic, that black basalt stones were still monolithic in later centuries, and that white stones remained so until the 18th century. However, &quot;gisantes&quot; were sometimes made up of several irregularly-shaped pieces. These were bound in plaster, encased in an iron or wooden casing, and sometimes placed on a bed of cemented bricks.

In fact, the invention of millstones made of pieces, i.e. an assembly of several stones or tiles, remains difficult to date precisely.

In the 15th century, the river trade passing through Paris was strictly controlled by the Hanseatic League of water merchants; &quot;French companies&quot; had to inform the clerks of the names of their partners, the city of destination, and the nature and value of the cargo. Thus, on May 3, 1452, a Rouen merchant named Robert Le Cornu declared that he was bringing to Normandy one or more boats loaded with 35 millstones, 5 blinkers, 100 &quot;carreaux&quot; and a tombstone.

Various texts provide clues to the manufacture of millstones in the 17th century. On March 10, 1647, Jacques Vinault &quot;&quot;sold 3 rounds of grinding stone&quot; to Pierre Bailly. On March 26, 1652, another text evokes the difficulties of a millstone assembly site, with a &quot;lack of wood to cook the plastre quy is not in sufficient quantity to plastrer and put in the places where it is necessary, joinct aussy that there is stone to suffice to make the millstones&quot;. On July 7, 1680, Sr Delugré &quot;made a deal with Claude Duvau and Jullien Boullmer, stone molders [...] to supply them with 2 molds of molding stone and plaster to make the millstones [...] made and perfect to make flour&quot;&quot;.

According to Dorothée Kleinmann, &quot;economic milling&quot; and its improvements really took off at the end of the 18th century. This led to the development of stone quarrying and millstone production in new regions such as Cinq-Mars-la-Pile and Domme, where &quot;millstones are always formed by joining several pieces together; there are no blocks large enough to make masses from a single piece&quot;. In these locations, it seems that at the beginning of the eighteenth century, millstone was not yet quarried, preferring to salvage scattered blocks from woods, fields and vineyards, which sometimes considerably increased their value.

Once the millstone blocks have been transported to the site and &quot;peeled&quot;, the manufacturer selects the stones required for the millstone. The different pieces are classified according to their quality, taking into account hardness, grain, porosity, and color. At this stage, it is also necessary to take into account the milling system used in the country of dispatch, and the type of wheat produced in the region. Once the choice has been made, production begins with the center or &quot;boitard&quot;, which is usually made in one piece. This must be very solid, especially for the current millstone, as it is at this level that the casing on which the millstone is suspended is fixed. Around the boitard, the tiles are arranged and fixed with plaster or cement, and chiseled to fit together sufficiently. A wheel of this type is generally made up of two to six quarters. &quot;When the job is done and the blocks match, the worker adjusts them by cementing them with Portland cement, sometimes with a paste of Spanish white and oil that hardens with age, and clamps the whole with iron hoops&quot;. On the other side of the working surface, the back of the millstone, or &quot;counter-molding&quot;, is surrounded by a strip of sheet metal serving as temporary formwork. To give the millstone the necessary weight and thickness, it is reloaded with small stones embedded in fine concrete, into which are inserted cast-iron balancing boxes, which may contain lead if necessary.

==== Edge mill ====

Horizontal use of the millstone is generally associated with milling. When the millstone is &quot;upright&quot;, i.e. on its edge, it is used for grinding, crushing, or milling operations. In this configuration, the nether millstone is fixed by its eyebolt to a vertical mast located centrally on the nether millstone which acts as a pivot. Depending on the size of the installation, and to maintain the verticality of the mast, its upper part may be attached to a beam overhanging the mill. The current millstone is rotated either &quot; by means of force&quot;, or more often, in a riding hall. In this way, the mill is driven by a double movement, turning on itself while pivoting around the mast, as in the Roman trapetum. In this type of device, the millstone is monolithic or made up of a paved or even masonry surface. Depending on the product to be processed, the millstone may be slightly concave, with a rim around the periphery to avoid dispersing the crushed material.

== Materials ==

In common language, &quot;millstone&quot; refers to any type of rock that may have been used in a mill, whereas in the geological sense, true &quot;millstone&quot; is defined as a siliceous accident in a sedimentary basin.

The type of stone most suitable for making millstones is a siliceous rock called (or buhrstone), an open-textured, porous but tough, fine-grained sandstone, or a silicified, fossiliferous limestone. In some sandstones, the cement is calcareous.

On a historical scale, it seems that most types of rock have been used in milling. Among the sedimentary rocks of potential use are limestone and sandstone. The latter soon emerged as the stones of choice, with porosities that make them easy to shape and extraction that can be facilitated by bedding between clay interbeds. It wasn&#x27;t until the 15th century that millstones &quot;stricto sensu&quot; began to be quarried, a practice that became widespread in the 18th century.

Deep-lying &quot;magmatic rocks&quot;, such as granite, are widespread, but were ultimately little used for millstone manufacture, probably due to their low porosity and the presence of black mica, which rapidly alters to form iron oxides. Basalt was widely used in Germany (Eifel), but is not widespread in France, with the exception of the Évenos volcano in Provence; other examples include the basalt millstones of the Agde volcano, and those of the Sainte Magdeleine volcano at La Môle, not far from Cogolin.

&quot;Limestones&quot; are generally porous, with medium to low compressive strengths, so &quot;classic&quot; limestones seem to have been quickly abandoned in favor of better stones. Although very fine-grained, limestone polishes very quickly and needs to be re-cut frequently to keep the stones rough. Some sandstone limestones (Saint-Julien-des-Molières limestone) can have very good compressive strength (over 100 MPa).

&quot;Sandstone rocks&quot; (sandstones and microconglomerates up to 1 cm) are the preferred material for millstones. Analysis of production sites shows that they can be limestone-cemented sandstones, silica-cemented sandstones, or even slightly metamorphosed sandstones.

&quot;Limestone-cemented sandstones&quot;, such as Alpine molasses, are widespread. They have medium porosities (6 to 12%), medium compressive strength (35 MPa), often coarse grain size, and variable silica content.

A very good millstone is generally rich in silica: the higher the percentage, the stronger the rock, silica being the hardest common mineral on the Earth&#x27;s surface. The same is true of sandstone with siliceous cement, where the percentage of silica is high because both the grains and the cement are siliceous in nature. However, they don&#x27;t necessarily make good millstones, like Vosges sandstone, which has a rather fine grain and traces of iron.

Slightly metamorphosed sandstones often have very low porosity (around 2%) due to tectonic compression, resulting in somewhat compact sandstones. Compressive strength can be very high (over 100 MPa), as in the case of Arros sandstone, despite an average silica percentage.

Finally, millstones in the geological sense are porous stones, which play a role not only for cutting, but also undoubtedly for grinding. These include stones such as those from La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, with high porosity (20%), compressive strength of 80 MPa, and medium grain. Corfélix stones have exceptional compressive strength on the order of solid basalt (190 MPa), 98% silica, fairly coarse grain, and medium to high porosity.

In a nutshell, for the rock mechanics, a good millstone has three fundamental characteristics:

* &quot;insensitivity to alteration&quot;, whether through dissolution (gypsum), the action of moisture (as in the case of limestone), or the chemical action of water, as in the case of granite mica or Vosges sandstone (presence of iron) ;
* &quot;heterogeneity on a millimeter and centimeter scale&quot; is a quality that provides crushing asperities and evacuating channels, like hard punches held together by a slightly less hard but tenacious cement, which is not generally a characteristic of limestone;
* &quot;high porosity&quot;, which facilitates quarrying, as it is easier to introduce cutting tools into porous rock than into solid rock, but also undoubtedly facilitates grinding.

The following table presents some examples of geological and petrophysical data obtained from sites used for the production of millstones:

Millstones used in Britain were of several types:

* Derbyshire Peak stones of grey Millstone Grit, cut from one piece, used for grinding barley; imitation Derbyshire Peak stones are used as decorative signposts at the boundaries of the Peak District National Park. Derbyshire Peak stones wear quickly and are typically used to grind animal feed since they leave stone powder in the flour, making it undesirable for human consumption.
* French buhrstones, used for finer grinding. French Burr comes from the Marne Valley in northern France. The millstones are not cut from one piece, but built up from sections of quartz cemented together, backed with plaster and bound with shrink-fit iron bands. Slots in the bands provide attachments for lifting. In southern England the material was imported as pieces of rock, only assembled into complete millstones in local workshops. It was necessary to balance the completed runner stone with lead weights applied to the lighter side.
*Composite stones, built up from pieces of emery, were introduced during the nineteenth century; they were found to be more suitable for grinding at the higher speeds available when auxiliary engines were adopted.

In Europe, a further type of millstone was used. These were uncommon in Britain, but not unknown:

* Cullen stones (stones from Cologne), a form of black lava quarried in the Rhine Valley at Mayen near Cologne, Germany.
* Lava stones from Orvieto (Italy), Mount Etna and Hyblaean Mounts (Sicily), and Pantelleria island, were used by the Romans.

==Patterning==

The surface of a millstone is divided by deep grooves called &quot;furrows&quot; into separate flat areas called &quot;lands&quot;. Spreading away from the furrows are smaller grooves called &quot;feathering&quot; or &quot;cracking&quot;. The grooves provide a cutting edge and help to channel the ground flour out from the stones.

The furrows and lands are arranged in repeating patterns called &quot;harps&quot;. A typical millstone will have six, eight or ten harps. The pattern of harps is repeated on the face of each stone, when they are laid face to face the patterns mesh in a kind of &quot;scissoring&quot; motion creating the cutting or grinding function of the stones. When in regular use stones need to be &quot;dressed&quot; periodically, that is, re-cut to keep the cutting surfaces sharp.

The major challenge is to limit the heat generated by the pressure of the millstones on the ground flour. In addition to denaturing the flour (browning), this overheating, and any sparks generated by the rubbing of the stones, could cause an explosion in the mill, whose atmosphere is charged with fine flour particles. A complex system of spokes had to be devised to ventilate the gap between the millstones and, at the same time, progressively push the material from the &quot;eyelet&quot; to the &quot;peripheral&quot; rabbet. Wheat millstones have long been used to grind cereals in a single pass. We had to find the best way of extracting the flour and cleaning the bran, ensuring that it was unbroken and free of flour.

Millstones need to be evenly balanced, and achieving the correct separation of the stones is crucial to producing good quality flour. The experienced miller will be able to adjust their separation very accurately.

For the manufacture of the millstone, the customer had to specify the diameter, the size of the eye and the direction of the furrows. Occasionally, a miller was mistaken about the direction of the furrows, as extracts from correspondence testify: &quot;&quot;You tell us that your top wheels must be rifled to turn counter-clockwise. We therefore understand that these millstones must be radiused to turn counter-clockwise, i.e. in the opposite direction to that in which the sun seems to revolve around the earth&quot;. Despite all the precautions taken at the time of ordering, it sometimes happened that, in the event of a dispute, we were obliged to travel to change the direction: &quot;we sent a workman a hundred leagues from here to unravel, straighten and re-radiate two pairs of millstone; the profit is eaten twice&quot;&quot;.

Between the furrows, the millstone is covered with fine grooves called &quot;feathering&quot; or &quot;cracking&quot;, also cut into the stone, to make it more aggressive and thus better able to grind the grains. They run along the edge of the millstone, over a width of around 15 cm, to form the &quot;rabbet&quot;. Regularly, the furrows need to be redone with a special hammer: the millstone is said to need to be rhabillaged or rebatted. This operation must be carried out after grinding around 50 tons of wheat. Special steel hardening techniques enabled certain companies, such as &quot;Kupka&quot; in Germany, to produce picks and hammers that were particularly appreciated by millstone reworkers. During the operation, the light blows emitted a cloud of siliceous dust that could cause lung ailments in specialized workers. In addition, the cutting of millstones led to professional tattoos, with steel particles from the tools embedded under the dermis. Eye diseases were also common.

== Grinding with millstones ==

Grain is fed by gravity from the hopper into the feed-shoe. The shoe is agitated by a shoe handle running against an agitator (&quot;damsel&quot;) on the stone &quot;spindle&quot;, the shaft powering the runner stone. This mechanism regulates the feed of grain to the millstones by making the feed dependent on the speed of the runner stone. From the feed shoe the grain falls through the &quot;eye&quot;, the central hole, of the runner stone and is taken between the runner and the bed stone to be ground. The flour exits from between the stones from the side. The stone casing prevents the flour from falling on the floor, instead it is taken to the &quot;meal spout&quot; from where it can be bagged or processed further. 
The runner stone is supported by the rind, a cross-
shaped metal piece, on the spindle. The spindle is carried by the &quot;tentering gear&quot;, a set of beams forming a lever system, or a screw jack, with which the runner stone can be lifted or lowered slightly and the gap between the stones adjusted. The weight of the runner stone is significant (up to ) and it is this weight combined with the cutting action from the porous stone and the patterning that causes the milling process.

Millstones for some water-powered mills (such as Peirce Mill) spin at about 125 rpm.

Especially in the case of wind-powered mills the turning speed can be irregular. Higher speed means more grain is fed to the stones by the feed-shoe, and grain exits the stones more quickly because of their faster turning speed. The miller has to reduce the gap between the stones so more weight of the runner presses down on the grain and the grinding action is increased to prevent the grain being ground too coarsely. It has the added benefit of increasing the load on the mill and so slowing it down. In the reverse case the miller may have to raise the runner stone if the grain is milled too thoroughly making it unsuitable for baking. In any case the stones should never touch during milling as this would cause them to wear down rapidly. The process of lowering and raising the runner stone is called tentering and lightering. In many windmills it is automated by adding a centrifugal governor to the tentering gear.
Depending on the type of grain to be milled and the power available the miller may adjust the feed of grain to stones beforehand by changing the amount of agitation of the feed-shoe or adjusting the size of the hopper outlet.
Milling by millstones is a one-step process in contrast with roller mills in modern mass production where milling takes place in many steps. It produces wholemeal flour which can be turned into white flour by sifting to remove the bran.

==Symbolism==

=== Symbolism in the Bible ===
Millstones were often essential objects within a community. For that reason, they gain multiple symbolic meanings and symbolism within mythology, folklore, and the Bible. The Hebrew Bible admonishes : &quot;No one shall take a lower millstone, nor an upper millstone, in pledge [for the payment of a debt], for that would be tantamount to taking away a life in pledge.&quot; The rabbis have explained that not only a millstone cannot be taken as security for a pledge, but anything in which the life of man depends cannot be taken as security for a pledge.

The Bible heavily utilized millstone symbolism within its various proverbs. A common one is the millstone&#x27;s proverbial designation of something as a great weight, as seen in Matthew 18:6 
Likewise, due to the exhausting physical labor associated with the earliest millstones, they were symbolic of hard work and accredited as a menial task given to the lowest form of a laborer. This is not the only symbolic meaning of millstones within the Bible; millstones were also used as a symbol of civilization, prosperity, and comfortable living.

=== Other symbolism ===
Out of the Bible, the millstone can be seen as a symbol of transformation, death, and rebirth. This is due to the strenuous amount of work and effort that goes into utilizing a millstone to grind grain into flour. Other symbolic meanings associated with millstones include fertility and abundance. In Korea, a practice existed in which the husband would use a millstone while his wife was in childbirth, hoping that he could share her pain. In both the Bible and folklore, the millstone can be associated with punishment. In some instances and stories, a millstone is used to harm an individual for their behavior. Examples of millstones being used to punish individuals can be seen in &quot;The Juniper Tree&quot; and Judges 9:53, where one is used to kill Abimelech by tossing it on his head. 

=== Heraldry ===
In heraldry, as a demonstration of military bravado, a millstone features as the heraldic crest of John de Lisle, 2nd Baron Lisle (c.1318-1355), one of the founder knights of the Order of the Garter, as shown on his garter-plate in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor: &quot;A mill-stone argent pecked sable the inner circle and the rim of the second the fer-de-moline or&quot;. Thus symbolising super-human strength necessary to support such a weight atop his helmet.

In its more basic heraldic form it is a charge symbolising industry. The &quot;fer-de-moline&quot; (&quot;mill-iron&quot;) or millrind, which attaches to the millstone and transfers to it the torque of the drive-shaft, is also a common heraldic charge, used as canting arms by families named Mills, Milles, Turner, etc.

<text>Patrick Charles Eugene Boone (born June 1, 1934) is an American singer, songwriter, actor, author, television personality, radio host and philanthropist. During his recording career, he sold nearly 50 million records and had 38 Top 40 hits; he also appeared in various Hollywood films.

According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, Boone was the only singer that could compete in popularity with Elvis Presley during the 1950s. &quot;Billboard&quot; has ranked Pat as one of the biggest charting artists in the period 1955–1995. Until the 2010s, Boone held the record for spending 220 consecutive weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts with one or more songs each week.

During the 1950s and the 1960s Boone was one of the most popular entertainers in the United States, becoming a teen idol as a valid alternative to the perceived hedonism of rock and roll, due to his activities as singer, writer, actor and religious motivational speaker. In 1957, at the age of 23, Boone began hosting a half-hour ABC variety television series, &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;, which aired for 115 episodes (1957–1960). Many musical performers including Cliff Richard, Nat King Cole, Edie Adams, Andy Williams, Pearl Bailey, and Johnny Mathis made appearances on the show. His cover versions of rhythm and blues hits had a noticeable effect on the development of the broad popularity of rock and roll. Elvis Presley was the opening act for a 1955 Pat Boone show in Brooklyn, Ohio. The two later became close friends.

As an author, Boone had a number-one bestseller in the 1950s (&quot;&#x27;Twixt Twelve and Twenty&quot;, Prentice-Hall). In the 1960s, he focused on gospel music. Later, he became a member of the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. Today, he continues to perform and speak as a motivational speaker, a television personality, and a conservative political commentator.

== Early life ==
Boone was born on June 1, 1934, in Jacksonville, Florida, to Margaret Virginia (née Pritchard) and Archie Altman Boone. He grew up in Nashville, where his family moved when he was two years old. He graduated in 1952 from David Lipscomb High School in Nashville. His younger brother Cecil (1935–2023), professionally known as Nick Todd, was born a year later to the day, and was also a pop singer in the 1950s and later a church music leader.

In a 2007 interview on &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, Boone claimed to be the great-great-great-great-grandson of the American pioneer Daniel Boone.

Pat primarily attended David Lipscomb College, and later Lipscomb University in Nashville. He graduated in 1958 from Columbia University School of General Studies &quot;magna cum laude&quot; having previously attended North Texas State University, now known as the University of North Texas, in Denton, Texas.

== Career ==
=== Music ===
Boone began his career by performing in Nashville&#x27;s Centennial Park. He began recording in April 1953 for Republic Records (not to be confused with the current label with that name), and by 1955, for Dot Records. His 1955 version of Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; was a hit. This set the stage for the early part of Boone&#x27;s career, which focused on covering R&amp;B songs by black artists for a white American market. Randy Wood, the owner of Dot, had issued an R&amp;B single by the Griffin Brothers in 1951 called &quot;Tra La La-a&quot;—a different song from the later LaVern Baker one—and he was keen to put out another version after the original had failed. This became the B-side of the first Boone single &quot;Two Hearts Two Kisses&quot;, originally by the Charms – whose &quot;Hearts Of Stone&quot; had been covered by the label&#x27;s Fontane Sisters.

A number-one single in 1956 by Boone was a second cover and a revival of a then seven-year-old song &quot;I Almost Lost My Mind&quot;, by Ivory Joe Hunter; song was originally covered by another Black star, Nat King Cole. According to an opinion poll of high-school students in 1957, the singer was nearly the &quot;two-to-one favorite over Elvis Presley among boys and preferred almost three-to-one by girls ...&quot; During the late 1950s, he made regular appearances on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;, hosted by his father-in-law. He cultivated a safe, wholesome, advertiser-friendly image that won him a long-term product endorsement contract from General Motors during the late 1950s, lasting through the 1960s. He succeeded Dinah Shore singing the praises of the GM product: &quot;See the USA in your Chevrolet ... drive your Chevrolet through the USA, America&#x27;s the greatest land of all!&quot; GM had also sponsored &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;.

Many of Boone&#x27;s hit singles were covers of hits from black rock and roll artists. These included: &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; by Fats Domino; &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; and &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; by Little Richard; &quot;At My Front Door (Crazy Little Mama)&quot; by The El Dorados; and the blues ballads &quot;I Almost Lost My Mind&quot; by Ivory Joe Hunter, &quot;I&#x27;ll be Home&quot; by the Flamingos and &quot;Don&#x27;t Forbid Me&quot; by Charles Singleton. Boone has been highlighted as an example of whitewashing by taking songs by black artists and sanitizing them to make them more palatable for a white audience, denying exposure to these black artists.

Boone also wrote the lyrics for the instrumental theme song for the movie &quot;Exodus&quot;, which he titled &quot;This Land Is Mine&quot;. (Ernest Gold had composed the music.)As a conservative Christian, Boone declined certain songs and movie roles that he felt might compromise his beliefs—including a role with sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In one of his first films, &quot;April Love&quot;, the director, Henry Levin, wanted him to give co-star Shirley Jones a kiss, which was not in the script. Since this would be his first onscreen kiss, Boone said that he wanted to talk to his wife first, to make sure it was all right with her. He had his own film production company, Cooga Mooga Productions.
He appeared as a regular performer on &quot;Arthur Godfrey and His Friends&quot; from 1955 through 1957, and later hosted his own &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;, on Thursday evenings. In 1959, Boone&#x27;s likeness was licensed to DC Comics, first appearing in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot; No. 9 (May 1959) before starring in his own series from the publisher, which lasted for five issues from September 1959 to May 1960. In the early 1960s, he began writing a series of self-help books for adolescents, including &quot;&#x27;Twixt Twelve and Twenty&quot;. The British Invasion ended Boone&#x27;s career as a hitmaker, though he continued recording throughout the 1960s. In 1966, he participated in the Sanremo Music Festival in Italy, performing the songs &quot;Mai mai mai Valentina&quot; alongside Giorgio Gaber and &quot;Se tu non-fossi qui&quot; with Peppino Gagliardi. During his trip to Italy, he visited the headquarters of Ferrari in Maranello, near Modena, with the intention of buying a Superamerica Sports Car, but Enzo Ferrari dissuaded him from purchasing that model by saying that there would not have been enough room for Boone&#x27;s four daughters, and sold him a four-door Ferrari 2+2 instead. In a 2021 interview, Boone admitted having later sold the &quot;Ferrari he didn&#x27;t like&quot; to Tom Smothers of the comedic duo Smothers Brothers.

In the 1970s, he switched to gospel and country; he also continued performing in other media. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Boone family toured as gospel singers. The family also made gospel albums, such as &quot;The Pat Boone Family&quot; and &quot;The Family Who Prays&quot;.

In 1973, he released S-A-V-E-D, a gospel-studio album. Two songs of the album were written by his friend Johnny Cash, who said about it:

In the early 1970s, Boone founded the record label Lamb &amp; Lion Records. It featured artists such as Pat, the Pat Boone Family, Debby Boone, Dan Peek, DeGarmo and Key, and Dogwood. In 1974, Boone was signed to the Motown country subsidiary Melodyland.In 1978, Boone became the first target in the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s crackdown on false-claim product endorsements by celebrities. He had appeared with his daughter Debby in a commercial to claim that all four of his daughters had found a preparation named Acne-Statin a &quot;real help&quot; in keeping their skin clear. The FTC filed a complaint against the manufacturer, contending that the product did not really keep skin free of blemishes. Boone eventually signed a consent order in which he promised not only to stop appearing in the ads, but also to pay about 2.5% of any money that the FTC or the courts might eventually order the manufacturer to refund to consumers. Boone said, through a lawyer, that his daughters actually did use Acne-Statin, and that he was &quot;dismayed to learn that the product&#x27;s efficacy had not been scientifically established as he believed.&quot;

Boone hosts a weekly radio show, the &quot;Pat Boone hour&quot;, on the &quot;50s Gold&quot; channel on SiriusXM.

=== Later work ===
In 1994, Pat Boone played the title role in &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot; in Branson, Missouri.

In 1997, Boone released &quot;In a Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot;, a collection of heavy metal covers. To promote the album, he appeared at the American Music Awards in black leather. He was then dismissed from &quot;Gospel America&quot;, a TV show on the Trinity Broadcasting Network.

After making a special appearance on TBN with the president of the network, Paul Crouch, and his pastor, Jack Hayford, many fans accepted his explanation of the leather outfit being a &quot;parody of himself&quot;. Trinity Broadcasting then reinstated him, and &quot;Gospel America&quot; was brought back.

In 2003, the Nashville Gospel Music Association recognized his gospel recording work by inducting him into its Gospel Music Hall of Fame. In September 2006, Boone released &quot;We Are Family: R&amp;B Classics&quot;, featuring cover versions of 11 R&amp;B hits, including the title track, plus &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got A Brand New Bag&quot;, &quot;Soul Man&quot;, &quot;Get Down Tonight&quot;, &quot;A Woman Needs Love&quot;, and six other classics.

In 2010, plans were announced for the Pat Boone Family Theater at Broadway at the Beach in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The attraction was never built.

In 2011, Boone acted as a spokesperson for Security One Lending, a reverse mortgage company. Since at least 2007 Boone has acted as a spokesperson for Swiss America Trading Corporation, a broker of gold and silver coins that warns of &quot;America&#x27;s Economic Collapse&quot;.

In 2023 Boone, at 89, is one of the guest vocalists on &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, an album by Ann-Margret. Together they perform the song &quot;Teach Me Tonight&quot; on the album.

In 2024, at age 90, he released a single, &quot;Where Did America Go?&quot;

== Personal life ==

In November 1953, 19-year-old Boone married Chicago-born Tennesseean Shirley Lee Foley (April 24, 1934 – January 11, 2019), also 19 years old, daughter of country-music great Red Foley and his wife, singer Judy Martin. They had four daughters: Cheryl &quot;Cherry&quot; Lynn, Linda &quot;Lindy&quot; Lee, Deborah &quot;Debby&quot; Ann, and Laura &quot;Laury&quot; Gene. Starting in the late 1950s, Boone and his family were residents of Teaneck, New Jersey. Shirley Boone was a lesser-known recording artist and television personality than her husband. She also founded a hunger-relief Christian ministry that evolved into Mercy Corps. She died at age 84 in 2019, at the couple&#x27;s Beverly Hills home, of complications from vasculitis, which she had contracted less than a year earlier.

=== Politics ===
Boone has been a close friend to many U.S. presidents (Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter and many others).

At a 1961 gathering at Pepperdine College, Pat Boone said, &quot;I would rather see my four girls shot and die as little girls who have faith in God than leave them to die some years later as godless, faithless, soulless communists.&quot;

Boone supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.In the 2007 Kentucky gubernatorial election, Boone campaigned unsuccessfully for incumbent Republican Ernie Fletcher with a recorded automated telephone message stating that the Democratic Party candidate Steve Beshear would support &quot;every homosexual cause.&quot; As part of the campaign, Boone asked, &quot;Now do you want a governor who&#x27;d like Kentucky to be another San Francisco?&quot; On August 29, 2009, Boone wrote an article comparing American political liberalism to cancer, likening it to &quot;black filthy cells&quot;.

In December 2009, Boone endorsed conservative Republican John Wayne Tucker&#x27;s campaign in Missouri&#x27;s 3rd congressional district against incumbent Russ Carnahan (D) in the 2010 midterm elections. In 2010, Boone endorsed Republican Clayton Trotter in the race for Texas&#x27;s 20th congressional district with an ad campaign referencing his song &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot;, about the Looney Tunes character, which critics have characterized as offensive stereotypes. Boone received a lifetime achievement award at the 38th annual Conservative Political Action Conference held in February 2011.

In June 2016, Boone, along with Mike Huckabee and executive producer Troy Duhon, all of whom were involved in the film &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead 2&quot;, sent a letter to California Governor Jerry Brown in opposition to Senate Bill 1146, which &quot;prohibits a person from being subjected to discrimination&quot; at California colleges. Other than schools that train pastors and theology teachers, schools &quot;might no longer be allowed to hire Christian-only staff, teach religious ideas in regular classes, require attendance at chapel services, or keep bathrooms and dormitories restricted to either males or females.&quot;

=== Basketball ===
Boone is a basketball fan and had ownership interests in two teams. He owned a team in the Hollywood Studio League called the Cooga Moogas. The Cooga Moogas included Bill Cosby, Rafer Johnson, Gardner McKay, Don Murray, and Denny &quot;Tarzan&quot; Miller.

When the American Basketball Association began, Boone became the majority owner of the league&#x27;s team in Oakland, California, on February 2, 1967. The team was first named the Oakland Americans, but was renamed the Oakland Oaks, the name under which it played from 1967 to 1969. The Oaks won the 1969 ABA championship.

Despite the Oaks&#x27; success on the court, the team had severe financial problems. By August 1969, the Bank of America was threatening to foreclose on a $1.2 million loan to the Oaks, and the team was sold to a group of businessmen in Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Caps.

Boone later played for the Virginia Creepers, an 80–84 age group Senior Olympics team that narrowly lost to the gold medal-winning team; Boone aged out (by turning 85) on June 1, 2019.

=== Boone as a philanthropist ===
Pat Boone and his wife Shirley have been very active in charitable endeavors. Together, they supported the founding of Mercy Corps in 1981, a global humanitarian organization focused on crisis response and development in over 40 countries. This initiative stemmed from an earlier project called &quot;Save the Refugees&quot;, which Shirley launched during the Cambodian crisis in 1979.

Among their many efforts, Pat and Shirley also contributed to the creation of the Shirley and Pat Boone Life Center in Tanzania. This center provides clean drinking water, medical care, and education to local communities. The couple also supported, through a multi-million dollar donation, the establishment of the &quot;Shirley and Pat Boone Center for the Family&quot; at Pepperdine University, which educates students on building moral and healthy relationships.

== Artistry and influence ==
During his career, he performed many musical genres such as pop, country music, rock and roll, R&amp;B, gospel and soul. His vocal style was similar to many crooners of his time like Frank Sinatra and Perry Como, despite that, he wasn&#x27;t a baritone like them, instead he had a tenor voice.

He was also popular for his wide vocal range.
Pat Boone is one of the most prolific artists of all time with nearly 2,600 recorded songs.

=== Popularity ===
It is estimated that over the course of his career, he recorded more than 2,600 official tracks, making him one of the most prolific artists in music history.

Throughout his incredibly long career, he reached the U.S. Top 40 charts 38 times, securing the number one spot six times. Until the 2010s, he held the record for the most consecutive weeks in the U.S. charts with at least one single in the Top 100, totaling 220 weeks.

According to the renowned magazine &quot;Billboard&quot;, Boone was the only artist who could rival Elvis Presley on the national charts in the late 1950s.

No. 1 singles in the United States (&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100):
* &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; (1955)
* &quot;I Almost Lost My Mind&quot; (1956)
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Forbid Me&quot; (1957)
* &quot;Love Letters in the Sand&quot; (1957)
* &quot;April Love&quot; (1957)
* &quot;Moody River&quot; (1961)

No. 1 singles in the United Kingdom (UK Singles Chart):
* &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home&quot; (1956)

== Religion ==
Boone grew up in the Church of Christ. In the 1960s, Boone&#x27;s marriage to Shirley Foley nearly came to an end because of his use of alcohol and his preference for attending parties. However, after coming into contact with the Charismatic Movement, Shirley began to focus more on her religion and eventually influenced Pat and their daughters to have a similar religious focus. At the time they attended the Inglewood Church of Christ in Inglewood, California.

In the spring of 1964, Boone spoke at a &quot;Project Prayer&quot; rally attended by 2,500 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. The gathering, which was hosted by Anthony Eisley, a star of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; series, sought to flood the United States Congress with letters in support of mandatory school prayer, following two decisions in 1962 and 1963 of the United States Supreme Court that struck down mandatory prayer as conflicting with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Joining Boone and Eisley at the Project Prayer rally were Walter Brennan, Lloyd Nolan, Rhonda Fleming, Gloria Swanson, and Dale Evans. Boone declared, &quot;what the communists want is to subvert and undermine our young people... I believe in the power of aroused Americans, I believe in the wisdom of our Constitution... the power of God.&quot; It was noted that Roy Rogers, John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, Mary Pickford, Jane Russell, Ginger Rogers, and Pat Buttram had endorsed the goals of the rally and would also have attended had their schedules not been in conflict.

In the early 1970s, the Boones hosted Bible studies for celebrities such as Doris Day, Glenn Ford, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Priscilla Presley at their Beverly Hills home. The family then began attending The Church on the Way in Van Nuys, a Foursquare Gospel megachurch pastored by Jack Hayford.

On an April 22, 2016, broadcast of Fox News Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Alan Colmes Show&quot;, Boone discussed an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that included a sketch entitled &quot;God Is a Boob Man&quot;; the sketch parodied the film &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead 2&quot;, in which Boone had a role. He described the sketch as &quot;blasphemy&quot;, stating that the Federal Communications Commission should forbid any such content, and that it should revoke the broadcast licenses of any &quot;network, or whoever is responsible for the shows&quot;.

== Film ==

In 1956, Boone was one of the biggest recording stars in the US. Several film studios pursued him for movies; he decided to go with 20th Century Fox, which had made Elvis Presley&#x27;s first movie. Fox reworked a play he had bought, &quot;Bernardine&quot;, into a vehicle for Boone. The resulting film was a solid hit, earning $3.75 million in the US.
Even more popular was &quot;April Love&quot; (1957), a remake of &quot;Home in Indiana&quot;. Boone regards it as one of his favourites, &quot;the kind of movie I wish I could have made 20 more of: a musical, appealing characters, some drama, a good storyline, a happy ending, it&#x27;s the kind of film which makes you feel good. I never wanted to make a depressing or immoral film.&quot;

Less popular was a musical comedy &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; (1958), which was the last movie of Edmund Goulding. However, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1959), a science fiction adventure tale, was a huge hit. Boone had been reluctant to do it, and needed to be persuaded by being offered the chance to sing several songs and given a percentage of the profits, but was glad he did.

He produced and starred in a documentary, &quot;Salute to the Teenagers&quot; (1960), but did not make a film for a while, studying acting with Sanford Meisner. He returned with a military comedy, &quot;All Hands on Deck&quot; (1961), a mild hit.

He was one of several names in another remake, &quot;State Fair&quot; (1962), a box office disappointment. Musicals were becoming less fashionable in Hollywood, so Boone decided to take on a dramatic role in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer-distributed movie &quot;The Main Attraction&quot; (1962) for Seven Arts Productions, his first movie outside Fox. It was an unhappy experience for Boone as he disliked the implication his character had sex with Nancy Kwan&#x27;s and he got into several public fights with the producers. He had a deal with Fox to make three films at $200,000 a film with his production company. This was meant to start with a thriller, &quot;The Yellow Canary&quot; (1963), in which Boone would play an unsympathetic character. New management came in at the studio, which was unenthusiastic about the picture but because Boone had a pay or play deal, they decided to make it anyway, only with a much shorter budget. Boone even paid some money out of his own pocket to help complete it.

Boone&#x27;s next movie for Fox was another low-budget effort, &quot;The Horror of It All&quot; (1963), shot in England. He made a comedy in Ireland, &quot;Never Put It in Writing&quot; (1964), for Allied Artists. Boone&#x27;s third film for Fox was an &quot;A&quot; production, &quot;Goodbye Charlie&quot; (1964), but Boone was in support of Debbie Reynolds and Tony Curtis. He was one of the many names in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965). He appeared in &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; (1967), a pilot for a TV series that did not eventuate, which was screened in some theatres. Boone&#x27;s last film of note was &quot;The Cross and the Switchblade&quot; (1970).

<text>The Ronettes were an American girl group from Washington Heights, Manhattan, New York City. The group consisted of the lead singer Veronica Bennett (later known as Ronnie Spector), her older sister Estelle Bennett, and their cousin Nedra Talley. They had sung together since they were teenagers, then known as &quot;The Darling Sisters&quot;. Signed first by Colpix Records in 1961, they moved to Phil Spector&#x27;s Philles Records in March 1963 and changed their name to &quot;The Ronettes&quot;.

The Ronettes placed nine songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, six of which became Top 40 hits. Among their hit songs are &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, which peaked at No. 2, their only contemporary top 10 hit, &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot;, &quot;(The Best Part of) Breakin&#x27; Up&quot; and &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot;. In 1964, the group released their only studio album, &quot;Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica&quot;. That year, the Rolling Stones were their opening act when they toured the UK. The Ronettes opened for the Beatles on their 1966 US tour, becoming the only girl group to tour with them, before splitting up in 1967. In the 1970s, the group was briefly revived as Ronnie Spector and the Ronettes. Veronica Bennett married Phil Spector in 1968.

Their song &quot;Be My Baby&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked their album &quot;Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica&quot; No. 422 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The Ronettes were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. The group also holds the record for the longest gap between top-ten hits in &quot;Billboard&quot; history, just over 58 years.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years ===
The Ronettes began as a family act where the girls grew up in Washington Heights, Manhattan. According to Nedra Talley, they started singing during childhood visits to their grandmother&#x27;s home. &quot;Estelle and Veronica are sisters,&quot; she said in a later interview. &quot;I&#x27;m their cousin. Our mothers are sisters. We came out of a family that, on Saturday nights, home for us was at our grandmother&#x27;s, entertaining each other.&quot; The Bennetts&#x27; mother was African-American and Cherokee; their father was Irish-American. Their cousin, Talley, is African-American, Cherokee and Puerto Rican. The trio also had a great-grandfather who was Chinese. &quot;By the time I was eight, I was already working up whole numbers for our family&#x27;s little weekend shows,&quot; Ronnie Spector later recalled. &quot;Then Estelle would get up onstage and do a song, or she&#x27;d join Nedra or my cousin Elaine and me in a number we&#x27;d worked out in three-part harmony.&quot;

Furthering their interest in show business, Estelle was enrolled at Startime, a popular dancing school in the 1950s, while Ronnie became fascinated with Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. In 1957, Ronnie formed the group later known as the Ronettes. Ronnie, her sister Estelle, and their cousins Nedra, Diane, and Elaine learned how to perfect their harmonies at their grandmother&#x27;s house, and became proficient at songs such as &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; and &quot;Red Red Robin&quot;. Emulating Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, the girls added their male cousin Ira to the group and signed up for a Wednesday night amateur show at the Apollo Theater run by a friend of Ronnie and Estelle&#x27;s mother. The show started out as a disaster; when the house band started playing Frankie Lymon&#x27;s &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;, Ira did not sing a word, so Ronnie took over. &quot;I strutted out across the stage, singing as loud as I could,&quot; Ronnie later recalled. &quot;When I finally heard a few hands of scattered applause, I sang even louder. That brought a little more applause, which was all I needed.&quot;

After their night at the Apollo, Ira, Elaine, and Diane left the group. After the curious renaming of the group to &quot;Ronnie and the Relatives&quot;, Ronnie, Estelle, and Nedra began taking singing lessons two afternoons per week. Appearing at local bar mitzvahs and sock hops, they met Phil Halikus, who introduced them to Colpix Records producer Stu Phillips. According to Ronnie, Phillips played the piano while the women auditioned for him, singing &quot;What&#x27;s So Sweet About Sweet Sixteen&quot;. The audition was successful, and the group was brought into the studio in June 1961 and recorded four tracks: &quot;I Want a Boy&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s So Sweet About Sweet Sixteen&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Quit While I&#x27;m Ahead&quot;, and &quot;My Guiding Angel&quot;. Colpix released &quot;I Want a Boy&quot; in August 1961 and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Quit While I&#x27;m Ahead&quot; in January 1962, the first singles credited to Ronnie and the Relatives.

While both singles failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100, fate intervened in advancing the group&#x27;s success. A fortuitous case of mistaken identity led to Ronnie and the Relatives making their debut – as dancers rather than a singing act – at New York City&#x27;s hip Peppermint Lounge in 1961. It was the height of the Twist craze, and under-aged Nedra and Ronnie disguised themselves to get in. The girls&#x27; mothers showed them how to put on make-up and fix their hair to make them look at least 23. When they arrived outside the club, its manager mistook Ronnie, Estelle, and Nedra for the trio supposed to dance behind house band Joey Dee and the Starliters for the evening. He led them in and put them onstage to perform in their place. During the show, Starliter David Brigati even handed the mike over to Ronnie when she started to sing Ray Charles&#x27; &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;. Soon afterward, Ronnie and the Relatives became a permanent act at The Peppermint Lounge, each earning $10 per night to dance The Twist and usually sing a song at some point in the show.

Ronnie and the Relatives soon became &quot;The Ronettes&quot;. Colpix issued the first two singles credited to the Ronettes, &quot;Silhouettes&quot; and a re-issue of &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Quit While I&#x27;m Ahead&quot;, on its May label in April and June 1962, respectively. Both singles disappointingly failed to chart. Later that year, they were flown to Miami to open a Florida branch of The Peppermint Lounge. After their performance at the Miami gala, radio host Murray the K came backstage and introduced himself to them. He asked the women to begin appearing at his shows at The Brooklyn Fox in New York. They agreed, taking the Fox stage in 1962 and completing a transition from Murray the K&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Girls&quot;, to back-up singing for other acts, to performing as the Ronettes before year&#x27;s end. It was during this time that the women evolved their iconic look, wearing ever more exaggerated eye make-up while teasing their hair to impossible proportions. &quot;We&#x27;d look pretty wild by the time we got out onstage,&quot; Ronnie later recalled, &quot;and the kids loved it.&quot; Colpix&#x27;s May label issued a final single by the Ronettes in March 1963. When &quot;Good Girls&quot; failed to chart, the women decided to look elsewhere for studio work.

=== Rise to prominence with Phil Spector ===

In early 1963, frustrated with Colpix Records and the group&#x27;s lack of success, sister Estelle called producer Phil Spector and told him the Ronettes would like to audition for him. Spector met the women soon after at Mira Sound Studios in New York City. Later, Spector told Ronnie that he had seen them at The Brooklyn Fox several times and was impressed with their performances. At the audition, when the group began singing &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;, Spector jumped from his seat and shouted, &quot;That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s the voice I&#x27;ve been looking for!&quot;

Spector decided to sign the group; originally, he wanted to sign Ronnie as a solo act, until her mother told him he would sign the Ronettes as a group or there would be no deal. Spector agreed, instructing Ronnie&#x27;s mother to inform Colpix Records that the women had &quot;given up&quot; on show business so the studio would release their contract. By March 1963, the group was officially signed to Spector&#x27;s Philles Records.

The first song the Ronettes rehearsed and recorded with Spector was written by Spector, Jeff Barry, and Ellie Greenwich, &quot;Why Don&#x27;t They Let Us Fall in Love&quot;. They brought the women out to California to make the record, but, once it was completed, Spector declined to release it. The Ronettes recorded more songs for Spector, including covers of &quot;The Twist&quot;, &quot;The Wah-Watusi&quot; (lead vocals by Nedra), &quot;Mashed Potato Time&quot;, and &quot;Hot Pastrami&quot;. These four songs were released, but were credited to The Crystals on their 1963 Philles LP &quot;The Crystals Sing Their Greatest Hits, Volume 1&quot;.

After having been denied a release of their song as well as having credit for their next four recordings go to another group, the Ronettes went to work on the Phil Spector/Jeff Barry/Ellie Greenwich song &quot;Be My Baby&quot;. The Ronettes recorded &quot;Be My Baby&quot; in July 1963, and it was released by August. &quot;Be My Baby&quot; was a smash record for the Ronettes. Radio stations played the song throughout fall 1963, and the Ronettes were invited to tour the country with Dick Clark on his &quot;Caravan of Stars&quot; tour. &quot;Be My Baby&quot; inspired a legion of Ronettes fans, including Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, who clearly intended &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot; as an homage to the group. The song became a Top 10 hit and peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100. &quot;Our lives were turned upside down,&quot; Ronnie later recalled. &quot;All the things I&#x27;d ever dreamed about were finally coming true.&quot;

&quot;Be My Baby&quot; was the first recording by Cher, who performed back-up vocals with Estelle, Nedra, and Sonny Bono. As the girlfriend of Bono, who was working for Phil Spector at the time, Cher was asked to join the back-up singers when one was a no-show. &quot;&#x27;Be My Baby&#x27; was the first record I ever sang on,&quot; Cher later wrote. &quot;I went out and stood in front of this big speaker and sang &#x27;be my, be my baby&#x27; with the Ronettes and all these other singers.&quot; After &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, Cher became a permanent back-up singer on recordings by the Ronettes, as well as other songs Phil Spector produced until &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot;.

After the overnight success of their first Phil Spector single, Spector was eager to do a follow-up with the Ronettes. He wrote &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot;, again with Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, and urged the Ronettes to leave New York for California to record the song at Gold Star Studios. A problem arose when the Ronettes were scheduled to leave for Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;Caravan of Stars&quot; tour across the United States. In lieu of having the Ronettes skip the Dick Clark tour, Spector decided Estelle and Nedra would do the tour with cousin Elaine, a former member of the group. Ronnie left for California to record &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot; with Darlene Love, Cher, and Sonny Bono subbing for Estelle and Nedra on back-up vocals. &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot; had an even denser arrangement, featuring Leon Russell on piano. The song was recorded in the early fall of 1963 and released in November that year. It was slightly less successful than &quot;Be My Baby&quot; on the charts, reaching number 24 Pop, number 6 R&amp;B in the United States and number 11 in the United Kingdom.

All three Ronettes, along with every other artist who was signed with Phil Spector in 1963, were featured on the Christmas LP &quot;A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector&quot;. For this album, the Ronettes recorded three songs: &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot;, &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;, and &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot;. All artists sang on the album&#x27;s finale, &quot;Silent Night&quot;, which opened with a spoken message from Phil Spector, wishing a Merry Christmas and thanking everyone for supporting the cooperative artists.

In his desire for absolute perfection on the album, Spector pushed his artists to belt out their lyrics as powerfully as they could. &quot;The Christmas album was the one where I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d lost it mentally.&quot; Nedra later said. &quot;I heard the parts. I swore I&#x27;d put them down, but they said it wasn&#x27;t on the tape.&quot;

The album was released on the day President Kennedy was assassinated. It was not a success upon its initial release but it was re-released by Apple Records in 1972 and reached No. 6 on &quot;Billboard&quot;′s list of Christmas Albums that year.

In January 1964, the Ronettes left for their first tour of the UK, where they made a strong impact from the very beginning. &quot;We must have been quite a sight in the Heathrow waiting room,&quot; Ronnie Spector later recalled, &quot;three black American girls sitting with their legs all crossed the same way, our three identical, enormous hairdos piled a foot or so over our heads. When our young chaperon finally showed up, he was all smiles.&quot;

On their first night in the UK, the women attended a party at Tony Hall&#x27;s house where they met the Beatles. After meeting, Ronnie and John Lennon quickly became friends and Estelle dated George Harrison. But for Ronnie, one of the biggest thrills was meeting Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, who were the opening act for the Ronettes on their UK tour. The feeling was mutually shared by Richards, who wrote of his relationship with Ronnie: &quot;The first time I ever went to heaven was when I awoke with Ronnie (later Spector!) Bennett asleep with a smile on her face. We were kids. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.&quot;

When the women returned home from their British tour, they went right back into the studio to record &quot;Keep on Dancing&quot; and &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot;, two songs written by Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich and Phil Spector. The group&#x27;s recording of &quot;Keep on Dancing&quot; is notable because it features Ronnie and Nedra singing in unison, but Spector refused to release the single. Around this time, The Crystals also recorded a version of &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot;, which also went unreleased.

&quot;(The Best Part of) Breakin&#x27; Up&quot; was subsequently recorded by the Ronettes. According to Ronnie, Spector was especially enthusiastic about the song. &quot;When Phil loved a song as much as he loved &#x27;(The Best Part of) Breakin&#x27; Up,&#x27;&quot; she later wrote, &quot;he could work on it for days without ever getting tired.&quot; Released in April 1964, the song did not fare as well as the group&#x27;s previous two singles, though it did manage to briefly break into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40. In June 1964, the group&#x27;s following single, &quot;Do I Love You?&quot;, was released, also breaking into the Top 40, beating their previous single by five positions.

As the British Invasion took full force on the American music scene in 1964, the Ronettes were one of the few groups that were able to maintain their relevance. When they toured the UK in January 1964, they had been asked by John Lennon to accompany the Beatles on their flight to America on February 7, 1964, but Spector denied them the opportunity to do so. Instead, throughout 1964, the group appeared on numerous television shows such as &quot;Shindig!&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, and British TV show &quot;Ready, Steady, Go!&quot; As the popularity of other groups such as The Crystals, The Marvelettes, and The Angels began to wane, that of the Ronettes continued to grow.

In the summer of 1964, Ronnie went into the studio to record her lead on the group&#x27;s next single, &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot;. She later recalled that the writers – Phil Spector, Barry Mann, and Cynthia Weil – were still adjusting the lyrics right up to the minute she recorded it. Ronnie recalled Phil placing headphones on her and telling her to listen closely. &quot;Everything was quiet,&quot; she later wrote, &quot;Then all of a sudden I heard a low rumble, like there was thunder coming from every corner of the room.&quot; The thunder was used for the introduction and was featured prominently throughout the remainder of the song, the only one of which Ronnie recorded in a single take. &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot; became the group&#x27;s most successful single since &quot;Be My Baby&quot; (released over a year earlier) and peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Following the successful release of &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot;, Philles Records released the group&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes featuring Veronica&quot;, in late 1964. The album proved only to be marginally successful, peaking at number 96 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, but for the first time Phil Spector publicly promoted lead singer Veronica &quot;Ronnie&quot; Bennett over Estelle Bennett and Nedra Talley. Every Ronettes single after this referred to the group as &quot;The Ronettes featuring Veronica&quot; on the record labels.

===Decline, final performances and breakup===
After the success of &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot;, the Ronettes&#x27; popularity had clearly begun to wane. In February 1965, Philles Records released the group&#x27;s next single, &quot;Born to Be Together&quot;, which only reached number 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100. Over the course of the next year, the Ronettes recorded a song catalog which, once completed, Phil Spector refused to release. Many attribute this to his insecurities and growing love for Ronnie. As the popularity of the group rose, their relationship grew deeper, and soon they were living together. Spector allegedly did not want the Ronettes to become too popular, fearing they would one day outshine him, perhaps explaining why he did not release recordings the Ronettes were contractually obligated to make. This allowed the Motown group the Supremes to eclipse them to become the most popular female group of the time.

Some recorded yet unreleased songs include: &quot;Paradise&quot;, &quot;Everything Under the Sun&quot;, and &quot;I Wish I Never Saw the Sun Shine&quot;. All three have since been covered by, among others, the Shangri-Las, the Supremes, and Ike &amp; Tina Turner. Spector&#x27;s choice was to not release the Spector/ Jeff Barry/ Ellie Greenwich song &quot;Chapel of Love&quot;, initially recorded by the Ronettes in early 1964. By the time their version finally was released, another recording by The Dixie Cups had gained attention. &quot;We thought it was such a great record that we practically begged [Phil Spector] to put it out,&quot; Ronnie Spector later wrote. &quot;Then the Dixie Cups&#x27; version came out, and it was a smash! It was so depressing.&quot;

In June 1965, the Ronettes&#x27; next single, &quot;Is This What I Get For Loving You?&quot;, was released, becoming a minor hit, reaching only number 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100. However, the song proved popular for TV appearances on &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, &quot;Hollywood A Go-Go&quot;, and &quot;Shivaree&quot;. The Ronettes failed to achieve another Top 10 hit, while the Supremes scored their fifth consecutive number-one song with &quot;Back in My Arms Again&quot;. Some have attributed the decline of their popularity partially to Phil Spector&#x27;s unenthusiastic promotions of the Ronettes, possibly from insecurities stemming from his intimate relationship with Ronnie.

There were internal problems within the group as well. &quot;You also have to remember that Nedra and Estelle stood in the background while I got to bask in the spotlight,&quot; Ronnie later wrote. &quot;I was the one who flew out to California and sang lead on all our records. I was the one deejays wanted to talk to. And I was the one our producer was in love with, which meant I get the preferential treatment in all kinds of other ways which [quite understandably] drove them crazy.&quot; &quot;I hated the &#x27;dog-eat-dog&#x27; side of show-business,&quot; Nedra Talley later commented. &quot;I hated pushing for the next record and the feeling of failure if we didn&#x27;t get it. There was a continual demand on us to produce that I thought was unfair. My personality didn&#x27;t like that.&quot; Nedra&#x27;s disdain for show business fueled her choice to marry Scott Ross.

After &quot;Is This What I Get for Loving You?&quot; was released in June 1965, over a year passed before the Ronettes&#x27; next single was released. &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot;, written by Phil Spector/Jeff Barry/Ellie Greenwich and produced by Barry, was issued in October 1966, barely making it into the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100 by peaking at number 100 for exactly one week before it fell off the charts. The song was covered by the Beach Boys in 1969 with much greater success.

After &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, the Ronettes became headliners at several Murray the K Holiday Shows in New York City and did package tours in the US and England. By late 1965, even without a recent hit, the group continued to make appearances at leading night clubs and on television shows, grace the covers of music magazines, and be featured on &quot;The Big TNT Show&quot;, a concert film produced by Phil Spector.

In August 1966, the Ronettes joined the bill with the Beatles for a 14-city tour across America. Phil Spector became so enraged when Ronnie expressed a desire to accompany Estelle and Nedra on the tour that Ronnie was forced to remain in California with him while the girls&#x27; cousin Elaine, who had previously been in the group, filled her slot on the tour, while Nedra or Estelle assumed the lead vocals on stage. A picture published in the November 1966 issue of &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine showed Nedra Talley singing lead, while Estelle and Elaine stood behind her singing harmony.

In early 1967, after their tour with the Beatles ended, and &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot; failed to make an impact, the Ronettes left for a tour in West Germany, after which they agreed to break up and go their separate ways. Soon afterward, Nedra Talley married her boyfriend Scott Ross, Ronnie Bennett married Phil Spector, and Estelle Bennett settled down with Joe Dong, a long-time boyfriend.

According to her accounts, Phil Spector kept Ronnie a virtual prisoner in their 23-room mansion in California. He brought her into the studio only once during their marriage. During this session, which took place in early 1969 at A&amp;M Records, she recorded &quot;You Came, You Saw, You Conquered!&quot; The song was released in March 1969, failing to make an impact on radio stations, which were now playing music in the style of Janis Joplin and Grace Slick. Later in 1969, Ronnie and Estelle were invited into the studio by Jimi Hendrix to record backing vocals on &quot;Earth Blues&quot;. Their work on the song earned the Ronettes a credit on the LP &quot;Rainbow Bridge.&quot;

=== Reunions and lawsuit against Spector ===
Ronnie left Phil on June 12, 1972, and their divorce was finalized in 1974. As she made an attempt to revive her career, she decided to reform the Ronettes. Nedra had no interest in returning to the group, and Estelle was unable to perform due to mental illness. Ronnie replaced them with Chip Fields (mother of actress Kim Fields) and Denise Edwards. They recorded some songs for Buddah Records in 1973, one of which was a cover of &quot;I Wish I Never Saw the Sun Shine&quot;, a song Ronnie had first done in 1965, though Phil Spector had refused to release it. The stint at Buddah was not successful, and by 1975, Ronnie had abandoned the idea of continuing the Ronettes and began her solo career.In 1988, the original Ronettes sued Phil Spector for $10 million over unpaid royalties and for unpaid income he made from licensing of Ronettes’ music. It took the case a decade to make its way to trial. In 2000, Phil was ordered to pay them more than $2.6 million. Phil appealed and in 2001 the state Supreme Court&#x27;s Appellate Division upheld a lower court finding that he had violated his 1963 contract. He appealed that ruling as well, taking the case to the New York State Supreme Court in 2002. In its ruling, the State Court of Appeals said it found the Ronettes&#x27; &quot;plight sympathetic, because they have earned less than $15,000 in royalties from songs that topped the charts and made them famous,&quot; but the judge found that their contract gave Spector unconditional rights to the recordings. The judge also reversed a lower court&#x27;s ruling that they were entitled to the music industry&#x27;s standard 50 percent royalty rate on sales of records, tapes and compact discs. However, it was ruled that Spector was entitled to her share of the royalties; she had argued that she was forced to sign away her rights to royalties in her 1974 divorce settlement. The royalties of the group&#x27;s other two members were not in dispute.

In 2017, Spector released a new single &quot;Love Power&quot;, under the name Ronnie Spector and The Ronettes, making it the first Ronettes single in decades.

===Deaths===
On February 11, 2009, Estelle died of colon cancer at the age of 67 in Englewood, New Jersey. Ronnie died on January 12, 2022, following a brief battle with cancer at the age of 78. Nedra Talley is the last surviving original member of the trio.

==Awards and recognition==
The Ronettes were nominated for a Grammy Award in 1965 for &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot;. They were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;Be My Baby&quot; in 1999. The Ronettes were also inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004 and the People&#x27;s Hall of Rock and Roll Legends in 2010. The Ronettes&#x27; influence on music was significant. In addition to Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen have both cited Ronnie Bennett as an influence. The Ronettes&#x27; fashion style was emulated by British musician Amy Winehouse.

It was reported that Phil Spector, in his capacity as a member of the Board of Governors, prevented the Ronettes from being nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, although they had been eligible for a considerable length of time. In a letter obtained by Ronnie&#x27;s lawyers, addressed to the Rock Hall&#x27;s nominating committee, Phil claimed that, apart from Ronnie, the group members did not appear on their records, and that they did not make the contribution required for induction. While he was awaiting trial on a murder charge, the Ronettes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 12, 2007, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. They were inducted by Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. Ronnie and Nedra performed &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot;, &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot;, and &quot;Be My Baby&quot;. Estelle was present to accept her award but was not well enough to perform, so Tricia Scotti (a regular backup singer with Ronnie) took her place behind the microphone.

<doc id="167378" wikidata="Q11578" url="?curid=167378" title="Venus Williams">
<text>Venus Ebony Starr Williams (born June 17, 1980) is an American inactive tennis player. She has been ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the WTA for 11 weeks, and as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s doubles for eight weeks. Williams has won 49 WTA Tour-level singles titles, including seven majors (five at Wimbledon and two at the US Open), as well as an Olympic gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. She has also won 22 doubles titles, including 16 majors and three Olympic gold medals. Williams is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.

Along with her younger sister, Serena, Venus Williams was coached by her parents Oracene Price and Richard Williams. Turning professional in 1994, she reached her first major final at the 1997 US Open. In 2000 and 2001, Williams claimed the Wimbledon and US Open titles, as well as Olympic singles gold at the Sydney Olympics. She first reached the singles world No. 1 ranking on 25 February 2002, becoming the first African American woman to do so in the Open era, and the second of all time after Althea Gibson. She reached four consecutive major finals between 2002 and 2003, but lost each time to Serena. She then suffered from injuries, winning just one major title between 2003 and 2006. Williams returned to form starting in 2007, when she won Wimbledon (a feat she repeated the following year). In 2010, she returned to the world No. 2 position in singles, but then suffered again from injuries. Starting in 2014, she gradually returned to form, culminating in two major final appearances at the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2017.

Along with her seven singles major titles, Williams has won 14 women&#x27;s doubles major titles, all partnering Serena; the pair are unbeaten in major doubles finals. She became the world No. 1 in doubles for the first time on June 7, 2010, alongside Serena, after the pair completed a non-calendar-year Grand Slam at the French Open. The pair also won three Olympic gold medals in women&#x27;s doubles, in 2000, 2008, and 2012, adding to Venus&#x27; singles gold in 2000 and her mixed doubles silver in 2016. Williams has also won two mixed doubles major titles, for a combined total of 23 major titles.

The Williams sisters are credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women&#x27;s professional tennis tour. Venus Williams was twice the season prize money leader (in 2001 and 2017), and ranks second behind Serena in all-time career prize money winnings, having earned over US$42 million as of March 2022.
==Early life==

Williams was born in Lynwood, California, to Richard Williams and Oracene Price.

The Williams family moved from Compton, California, to West Palm Beach, Florida, when she was eleven, so that she and her sister Serena could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci, who took notice of the sisters and who would provide additional coaching. He did not always agree with Williams&#x27; father but respected that &quot;he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls&quot;. Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was eleven, since he wanted them to take it slowly and focus on schoolwork. Another motivation was racial, as he had allegedly heard parents of other players disparage the Williams sisters during tournaments. At that time, Williams held a 63–0 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked No. 1 among the under-12 players in Southern California. In 1995, Richard pulled his daughters out of Macci&#x27;s academy and took over all coaching.

==Playing style==
Williams is an aggressive player, with an all-court game. Due to her assertive playing style, she typically accumulates large numbers of both winners and unforced errors. She possesses powerful groundstrokes on both sides, and is capable of hitting both her forehand and backhand flat, and with topspin. She is also adept at hitting her backhand with slice to slow down rallies and disrupt pace within rallies. Her serve is powerful, allowing her to serve numerous aces in any match. At the peak of her career, her first serve would average , and would frequently peak at ; her serve has slowed since then, averaging , and peaking at . She possesses effective kick and slice serves, which she deploys as second serves, preventing opponents from scoring free points. Up to 2014, she held the record for the fastest serve on the WTA Tour, recorded at the 2007 US Open, at . She likes to approach the net, and finish points quickly. Her height, at , provides her with a long arm span, allowing her to reach difficult returns while positioned at the net. She has a repertoire of shots to perform at the net, which leads to many won points.

Due to her all-court game, Williams can hit winners from any position. An exceptional tactical player with remarkable problem-solving skills, she also plays with sheer power and aggression. She relies on defense infrequently, rarely hitting drop shots and lobs, as her exceptional speed and court coverage allow her to hit with assertive power and strength from frequently defensive positions. Further strengths include her detailed and intricate footwork, and supreme athleticism.

==Career==

Venus Williams turned professional on October 31, 1994, at the age of 14. In the first round of her first professional tournament, the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland, Venus defeated former NCAA singles champion Shaun Stafford.

Richard Williams, her father, later claimed that this incident was racially motivated.

===1998: First WTA Tour singles title and top 5, first major doubles titles===
In her debut at the Australian Open, Williams defeated younger sister Serena Williams in the second round, which was the sisters&#x27; first professional meeting. Williams eventually lost in the quarterfinals to No. 3 Davenport.

===2001: Third &amp; fourth major titles===

Williams also reached the semifinals of the Tier I Tennis Masters Series tournament in Indian Wells, where she controversially defaulted her match with her sister just before the match started. Williams had been suffering from knee tendinitis throughout the tournament and eventually this prevented her from playing. The following day, Williams and her father Richard were booed as they made their way to their seats to watch the final. Serena Williams was subsequently booed during the final with Kim Clijsters and during the trophy presentation. Due to this, neither Williams sister entered the tournament for 14 years, with her sister Serena entering in 2015 after appeals for forgiveness from the event and the WTA Tour. Williams rebounded from the Indian Wells &#x27;boycott&#x27; controversy to win the next tournament on the tour calendar, the Tier I Key Biscayne Open. She defeated Hingis in the semifinals and No. 4 Jennifer Capriati in the final, after saving eight championship points. Because of this victory, her ranking rose to a career high of No. 2.

During the European clay-court season, Williams won the Tier II tournament in Hamburg but lost in the third round of the Tier I German Open to No. 18 Justine Henin and the first round of the French Open to Barbara Schett.

===2002: World No. 1 ranking===
Williams began 2002 by winning the Mondial Australian Women&#x27;s Hardcourts in Gold Coast, defeating Henin in the final. However, she then lost for the first time in her career to Seles in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. Williams then went on to win the Open Gaz de France in Paris when Jelena Dokić withdrew from the final, and the Proximus Diamond Games in Antwerp, defeating Henin in the final. As a result of her strong start to the season, Williams assumed the world No. 1 position for the first time on February 25, dislodging Capriati. Williams was the first African-American woman ever to hold the ranking. She held it for just three weeks before surrendering it back to Capriati.

Williams failed to defend her title in Miami, after losing in the semifinals to her sister Serena. However, she made a strong start to the clay-court season, winning the Amelia Island Championships, defeating Henin in the final. A week after winning that tournament, she once again replaced Capriati as the No. 1, before losing it again to Capriati after three weeks. During those three weeks, Williams had made the final in Hamburg, defeating Hingis in the semifinals, before losing to Clijsters in the final. Seeded second at the French Open, Williams defeated former champion Seles to reach the semifinals for the first time. There, she defeated Clarisa Fernández. In the final, Williams met her sister Serena for a second time in a Grand Slam final, with her sister winning. Williams once again replaced Capriati as the No. 1 as a result of reaching the final.

As the top seed at Wimbledon, Williams defeated Henin in the semifinals to make the final for the third consecutive year. However, there, she lost to her sister Serena. This result meant Serena Williams replaced Venus as the No. 1. The Williams sisters teamed up to win the women&#x27;s doubles title at the event, their fifth major women&#x27;s doubles title together.

Williams won the titles in San Diego and New Haven for the third consecutive year, defeating Davenport and Dokic to win the former and defeating Davenport in the final of the latter. At the 2002 US Open, Williams defeated Seles in the quarterfinals and Amélie Mauresmo in three sets to make the final. Playing her younger sister Serena for their third consecutive Grand Slam final, her sister won once again. After that, Williams played just four more matches during the season.

Williams finished the year ranked No. 2 having won seven titles, her best showing in both respects of her career.

===2003: Australian Open &amp; Wimbledon finals, injuries===
Williams started 2003 by defeating fifth seed Justine Henin to make the final of the Australian Open for the first time. In the final, however, she lost to her sister Serena. This marked the first time in the open era that the same two players had met in four consecutive Grand Slam finals (matched by Rafael Nadal &amp; Novak Djokovic who met in Wimbledon 2011 final through the French Open 2012 final). Venus and Serena Williams teamed to win the women&#x27;s doubles title at the event, their sixth Grand Slam title in women&#x27;s doubles.

In February, Williams won the Proximus Diamond Games in Antwerp for the second consecutive year, defeating Kim Clijsters in the final. However, shortly afterwards, she began to struggle with injury. She reached the final of the clay-court J&amp;S Cup in Warsaw, before being forced to retire against Amélie Mauresmo. She then suffered her earliest exit at a Grand Slam tournament in two years when she lost in the fourth round of the French Open to Vera Zvonareva.

At Wimbledon, Williams was seeded fourth. Williams defeated former champion Lindsay Davenport in the quarterfinals and Kim Clijsters in the semifinals to advance to her fourth consecutive Wimbledon final, where she lost again to sister Serena.

Wimbledon was Williams&#x27;s last event of the year as an abdominal injury that occurred during the Clijsters match prevented her from playing again. While she was recovering from the injury, her sister Yetunde Price was murdered. Williams finished the year ranked No. 11. It was the first time in nearly six years that she had dropped out of the top 10.

===2004: Tough losses and further injuries===
In 2004, Williams came back to the tour suffering inconsistent results. As the third seed because of a protected ranking, she reached the third round of the Australian Open, where she lost to Lisa Raymond. She then lost in the quarterfinals of her next three tournaments.

Williams began to find her form at the beginning of the clay-court season. At the Tier I Family Circle Cup in Charleston, Williams defeated Conchita Martínez in the final to win her first title in over a year and the second Tier I title on clay of her career. She then won in Warsaw, defeating Svetlana Kuznetsova in the final, before reaching the final of the Tier I German Open in Berlin. She then withdrew from that match against Mauresmo due to injury. Going into the French Open, Williams had the best clay-court record among the women and was among the favorites to win the title; however, after making the quarterfinals to extend her winning streak on the surface to 19 matches, she lost to eventual champion Anastasia Myskina. Despite her defeat, she re-entered the top 10.

In Wimbledon, Williams lost a controversial second-round match to Croatian Karolina Šprem. The umpire of the match, Ted Watts, awarded Šprem an unearned point in the second-set tiebreak. Upon the conclusion of the match, he was relieved of his duties. This defeat marked the first time since 1997 that Williams had exited Wimbledon prior to the quarterfinals. After Wimbledon, she reached her fourth final of the year at the Stanford Classic in California, where she was beaten by Lindsay Davenport for the first time since 2000.

As the defending champion at the Athens Olympics, Williams lost in the third round to Mary Pierce. She then won three very close matches against Petra Mandula, Shikha Uberoi and Chanda Rubin to make the fourth round of the 2004 US Open where she lost to Davenport, the first time she had ever lost at the US Open prior to the semifinals. Williams completed the year by losing in the quarterfinals of three indoor tournaments in the fall, a period that included defeat in her first meeting with 17-year-old Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova at the Zurich Open. Williams finished the year as No. 9 and did not qualify for the year-ending WTA Tour Championships.

===2005: Third Wimbledon title===
In 2005, Williams started the year by losing in the fourth round of the Australian Open to Alicia Molik. She then reached the final in Antwerp, defeating Clijsters and Myskina en route. In the final, Williams was a set and a service break up against Mauresmo before eventually losing.

In March, at the Miami Open, she defeated sister Serena in the quarterfinals, the first time she had defeated her since 2001. Venus Williams went on to lose in the semifinals to No. 3 Sharapova. In May, she won her first title in over a year at the clay-courts at the İstanbul Cup, defeating Nicole Vaidišová in the final. However, at the French Open, she lost in the third round to 15-year-old Sesil Karatantcheva, who subsequently tested positive for steroids and was suspended.

Williams was seeded 14th for the Wimbledon Championships. In the quarterfinals of the tournament, she defeated French Open runner-up Pierce in a second-set tiebreak, winning it 12–10 to make the semifinals of a Grand Slam for the first time in two years. There, she defeated defending champion and second-seeded Sharapova to make the Wimbledon final for the fifth time in six years. Playing top-seeded Davenport in the final, Williams saved a match point with a backhand winner en route to winning. This was her third Wimbledon singles title, her fifth Grand Slam singles title overall and her first since 2001. It was the first time in 70 years that a player had won after being down match point during the women&#x27;s final at Wimbledon.

Williams reached her fourth final of the year in Stanford, where she lost to Clijsters. At the 2005 US Open, Williams achieved her second consecutive win over sister Serena in the fourth round, but then lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champion Kim Clijsters. Williams did not qualify for the year-ending Tour Championships because of an injury sustained during the China Open. She finished the year ranked No. 10. It was the first year since 2001 that she had finished a year ranked higher than her sister Serena Williams.

===2006: Wrist injury and drop in the rankings===
In 2006, Williams was upset in the first round of the Australian Open by Tsvetana Pironkova, which was her earliest loss ever at that tournament. After that loss, she did not play again for three months due to a wrist injury. She returned in late April on clay in Warsaw, where she defeated former No. 1 Hingis in the second round, before losing to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the quarterfinals. Williams completed the clay-court season by reaching the quarterfinals of the French Open, where she lost to Nicole Vaidišová.

Williams was the defending champion and one of the favorites to win the singles title at Wimbledon. However, she lost in the third round to 26th-seeded Jelena Janković. After the loss, Williams said that she was having pain in her left wrist, although she admitted that the injury was not the cause of her loss. Williams did not play in the US Open Series or the US Open itself due to the wrist injury. In October, during her first tournament in almost three months, she reinjured her wrist at the Luxembourg Open and lost in the second round to qualifier Agnieszka Radwańska. Williams finished the season as No. 46, her lowest finish since she began to play on the WTA Tour full-time in 1997. It was the second consecutive year she finished higher than her sister Serena, who finished the year at No. 95.

===2007: Fourth Wimbledon title===
Williams withdrew from the 2007 Australian Open, the second consecutive Grand Slam that she had missed due to her recurring wrist injury. She returned in February at the Cellular South Cup in Memphis, defeating top-seeded Shahar Pe&#x27;er in the final, her first singles title since her victory at Wimbledon in 2005.

At the beginning of the clay-court season, Williams reached the semifinals of the Tier I Charleston Open, where she lost to Janković on a third set tiebreak. She also lost to fourth seed Janković in the third round of the French Open, her third consecutive loss to Janković. During her second round win over Ashley Harkleroad, Williams hit a serve, which was the second fastest woman&#x27;s serve ever recorded and the fastest ever recorded during a main draw match at the time.

Williams was ranked No. 31 going into Wimbledon and was seeded 23rd at the tournament due to her previous results at Wimbledon. Williams was a game away from defeat in her first round match against Alla Kudryavtseva and in her third round match against Akiko Morigami she was two points away from defeat, but she eventually won both 7–5 in the third set. She then advanced to reach her sixth Wimbledon final, after beating Maria Sharapova, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Ana Ivanovic in straight sets en route, where she defeated 18th seed Marion Bartoli also in straight sets. Williams thus became only the fourth woman in the open era to win Wimbledon at least four times, along with Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf. She also became the lowest-seeded Wimbledon champion in history, breaking the record she herself set in 2005. Williams returned to the top 20 as a result of the win.

At the 2007 US Open, after setting a Grand-Slam record serve in the opening round, Williams advanced to her first major semifinal outside of Wimbledon since 2003. However she then lost to eventual champion Justine Henin. The tournament resulted in Williams&#x27;s ranking moving up to No. 9. Williams then won her third title of the year at the Korea Open in Seoul, defeating Maria Kirilenko in the final, before then losing in the final of the Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo to Virginie Razzano.

She lost her first match against Dementieva, and her second match against her sister Serena- both in straight sets, after taking the first set.

Because of Dementieva&#x27;s loss to Kuznetsova in their round robin match, Williams advanced to the semifinal of the championships. In her semifinal match, she defeated Jelena Janković of Serbia to advance to her second consecutive final in the tournament which she lost to her sister Serena. In doubles, Williams teamed with her sister as the second seeds. However, they lost to Nuria Llagostera Vives and María José Martínez Sánchez in the semifinal.

Her next tournament was the Premier Mandatory Miami Open in Key Biscayne, where she was seeded third. She defeated No. 9, Agnieszka Radwańska, in the quarterfinals and No. 13, Marion Bartoli, in the semifinals to reach her third straight WTA Tour final and fourth Miami Open final. She was defeated by Kim Clijsters in the final in just 58 minutes, ending her 15-match winning streak. By reaching the final, her ranking improved to No. 4 and she crossed the $26 million mark in career prize money, the only player besides Serena Williams to do so.

The knee injury that hampered her during the final of the Miami Open forced her to skip the Fed Cup tie against Russia and the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. Williams returned to the tour at the Premier 5 Italian Open in Rome. She suffered the worst defeat of her career in the quarterfinals, losing to No. 4 Jelena Janković. Despite this loss, her ranking improved to No. 3 on May 10.

Her next tournament was the Madrid Open, a Premier Mandatory tournament. She lost to Aravane Rezaï in the final. In doubles, she teamed with her sister Serena to win the title.

They then defeated 12th seeded Květa Peschke and Katarina Srebotnik in the final to win their fourth consecutive Grand Slam women&#x27;s doubles title. By virtue of reaching the No. 1-ranking in doubles on June 7, 2010, Venus and Serena became just the sixth and seventh women to reach the No. 1 ranking in both singles and doubles following in the footsteps of Martina Navratilova, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport, and Kim Clijsters.

Her next tournament was the Wimbledon Championships, where she had reached the final the previous three years. Despite her knee injury, she made it to the quarterfinals, where she lost to Tsvetana Pironkova. Pironkova was ranked No. 82 and had never gone past the second round of a Grand Slam event. As a result, Williams dropped to No. 4. She was the defending champion in doubles with her sister Serena, having won the tournament in the previous two years. However, they lost this time in the quarterfinals to Elena Vesnina and Vera Zvonareva.

Williams then missed all tournaments in the US Open Series because of a left knee injury but still participated at the 2010 US Open as the third seed.

Williams then defeated Pe&#x27;er and French Open champion Schiavone en route to her eighth US Open semifinal, against defending champion Clijsters. Williams won the first set of their match and recovered from 5–2 down in the second set but ultimately double-faulted on a key point near the end of the match and lost in three sets. Because of Serena&#x27;s withdrawal from the US Open, Venus did not participate at the doubles event, where she was the defending champion.

The recovery of her left knee took longer than expected and it forced her to miss the rest of 2010, including the year-ending WTA Championships and Fed Cup final. Williams ended the year ranked fifth in singles, the first time she ended a year in the top five since 2002, while playing only nine tournaments. She finished the year ranked 11th in doubles.

At the Australian Open, Williams retired in the second game of her third round match against Andrea Petkovic after sustaining a hip muscle injury in her second round. This was Williams&#x27;s first retirement during a match in a Grand Slam tournament since 1994 and thus ended her record of most Grand Slam matches without ever retiring, with 250 consecutive matches. This was also her first retirement from a match since LA Women&#x27;s Championships in Los Angeles in 2004, ending her 294 consecutive matches without retiring. The injury forced Williams to pull out of the Fed Cup quarterfinal against Belgium, the Dubai Tennis Championships, and the Mexican Open, where she was the two-time defending champion in both tournaments. She subsequently withdrew from the Miami Open causing her ranking to drop to No. 15. She also missed the clay court season which caused her ranking to drop to No. 29.

In her first major semifinal since the 2010 US Open and her first Wimbledon semifinal since 2009, she lost to fourth seed Angelique Kerber in straight sets. In the doubles tournament, Venus and Serena Williams advanced to their first major final since 2012. They then won their 14th major title together and sixth at Wimbledon.

Williams began her US Open Series at the Stanford Classic, where she was the No. 1 seed. She defeated Magda Linette in the second round and compatriots Catherine Bellis and Alison Riske in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively, to reach her eighth final in Stanford. She lost to Johanna Konta, in three sets. By virtue of her result, Williams ascended to No. 6 in the rankings, her highest position since being diagnosed with Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome in 2011. Williams then entered the Rogers Cup. Having received a bye in the first round, Williams won her second-round match against Barbora Strýcová, in straight sets. She fell to Madison Keys in the third round in three sets.

Williams failed to medal in her singles and doubles events at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, falling in the first round in both events, marking her worst exits of her Olympic career. She entered the mixed doubles event with Rajeev Ram, defeating the Netherlands in the first round after saving match point. The pair then defeated Italy in the quarterfinals and India in the semifinals to set up a clash with the United States team of Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Jack Sock in the gold medal match. The duo lost to Mattek-Sands and Sock. By winning a silver medal, Williams became the only female player (besides Kathleen McKane Godfree) to win a medal in all three events (singles, doubles and mixed); her five medals mean she now shares the record for most Olympic medals won in tennis with Godfree.

At the 2016 US Open, Williams broke the record for the most major appearances, surpassing Amy Frazier&#x27;s record of 71. This is also the first time that she&#x27;s been seeded in the top ten at all four Grand Slam tournaments this year, having last achieved this in 2010. She won her first three-round matches respectively against Kateryna Kozlova, Julia Görges and the 26th seed Laura Siegemund. She lost in the fourth round to 10th seed Karolína Plíšková after failing to convert match point.

In September 2016, in response to WADA database leak, Williams confirmed the usage of banned substances classified by WADA as Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs), stating: &quot;The applications for TUEs under the Tennis Anti-Doping program require a strict process for approval which I have adhered to when serious medical conditions have occurred&quot;.

Williams failed to defend her title in Wuhan, falling in the third round to ninth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova. This pushed her outside of the top ten for a second time this year. The following week she was bundled out of the China Open in the first round by No. 223-ranked Peng Shuai. Williams qualified for the WTA Elite Trophy, where she was the defending champion, however she decided not to participate. She finished the year ranked No. 17.

===2017: Two major finals and return to the top 5===
Williams began her 2017 season at Auckland, winning her opening match against local wildcard Jade Lewis before withdrawing due to a right arm pain. Seeded 13th at the Australian Open, Williams defeated Kateryna Kozlova, qualifier Stefanie Vögele, Duan Yingying and qualifier Mona Barthel in the opening four rounds respectively in straight sets to advance to the quarterfinals. She defeated 24th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for her 50th win at the Australian Open, the first time Williams won a quarterfinal match in Melbourne since defeating Daniela Hantuchová in 2003. Coming back from a set down in her semifinal match, Williams defeated rising American star CoCo Vandeweghe to advance to her first Grand Slam final since Wimbledon 2009 and her first Australian Open final since 2003. In doing so, she set the Open era record for the longest span (20 years) between grand slam singles final appearances, having first reached a Grand Slam singles final at the 1997 US Open. In a closely fought final, she lost in two sets to her younger sister Serena, who made history by winning her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, surpassing the mark set by Steffi Graf. The following week, Williams competed in the St. Petersburg Ladies&#x27; Trophy, but lost in the second round to eventual champion Kristina Mladenovic. At the Indian Wells Open, Williams came back from a set down and saved three match points in the second round to defeat Jelena Janković, tying their head-to-head record at seven-all. This was her first win at Indian Wells since 2001. She defeated Lucie Šafářová and qualifier Peng Shuai in the third and fourth rounds respectively, avenging her previous losses to both players. She lost to the eventual champion, Elena Vesnina, in the quarterfinals. The following week, Williams scored her first top-ten win since 2015, against Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round of the Miami Open. She defeated No. 1 Angelique Kerber in the quarterfinals, becoming the oldest player to beat a current No. 1. She lost for a third consecutive time to eventual champion Johanna Konta in straight sets in her first semifinal in Miami since 2010. This marked her fourth consecutive loss to eventual champions.

The following week, after receiving a bye, Williams lost to eventual semifinalist Laura Siegemund in the Volvo Car Open. Having saved match point in the second set, Williams forced two match points in the third set, but Siegemund saved both. After the match, Williams said, &quot;This could be the best match she&#x27;ll ever play in her life. I basically won the match but still lost.&quot; Williams withdrew from the Madrid Open after an injury to her right arm. She made her European clay-court debut at the |Italian Open where she defeated Yaroslava Shvedova and Lesia Tsurenko in straight sets. She defeated No. 6 Johanna Konta in the third round, but lost in her first quarterfinal in Rome since 2012 to Garbiñe Muguruza in three sets. During this match, Williams hit a reactionary lob off an attacking forehand that was voted WTA shot of the month. Williams defeated Wang Qiang, Kurumi Nara and Elise Mertens in the first three rounds of the French Open before again losing to Bacsinszky in the fourth round, this time in three sets.

Williams entered Wimbledon as the number 10 seed. She defeated Elise Mertens, Wang Qiang, Naomi Osaka and Ana Konjuh to reach the quarterfinals for the 13th time in her career, where she defeated the 2017 French Open champion Jeļena Ostapenko in straight sets. This was also her 100th career match at Wimbledon. She advanced to her ninth Wimbledon final by defeating Johanna Konta, in straight sets in the semifinals. This marked her 87th win at Wimbledon, the third most on the all-time list. This also marked the first season since 2003 that Williams reached two slam finals. Williams lost the final in straight sets to Garbiñe Muguruza. She gained the No. 9 ranking by reaching the final, her second appearance in the top 10 in 2017; she had briefly returned to the top 10 in 2017 by virtue of beating Angelique Kerber in Miami.

Williams began her play in the US Open Series at the Canadian Open. She defeated qualifier Irina-Camelia Begu in three sets and Kateřina Siniaková in straight sets before losing to fifth seed and eventual champion Elina Svitolina in the third round. The next week, Williams competed in Cincinnati and defeated Alison Riske in the first round before losing to Ashleigh Barty in the second round. Barty was the first person to have defeated Williams and fail to reach at least the semifinals of the event in which they had defeated her in 2017. At the 2017 US Open, Williams defeated Viktória Kužmová, Océane Dodin, and Maria Sakkari to reach the fourth round. Williams reached the second week of all majors in a single season for the first time since 2010, and reached the second week of seven consecutive Grand Slam tournaments, the longest streak among WTA players at that time. In the fourth round, Williams beat Suárez Navarro in three sets to reach her 12th US Open quarterfinal, where she defeated Petra Kvitová in a third set tiebreak during the two-hour, 35 minute match. She also guaranteed her return to the top five in the WTA rankings at the conclusion of the tournament for the first time since January 2011. Williams then lost in three sets to fellow American and eventual champion Sloane Stephens in her first US Open semifinal since 2010.

On September 26, Williams qualified for the WTA Finals for the first time since 2010. In her first tournament after the US Open, Williams defeated Risa Ozaki in the first round of the Hong Kong Open, before falling to Naomi Osaka. At the WTA Finals, Williams was placed in the White Group with Karolína Plíšková, Garbiñe Muguruza and Jeļena Ostapenko. After losing her first match to Pliskova in straight sets, Williams defeated Ostapenko in a marathon match lasting almost hours. She defeated Muguruza in straight sets to progress to the semifinals, avenging her loss to the Spaniard in the Wimbledon final. Williams then defeated Caroline Garcia in three sets to advance to her first final at the year-end championships since 2009, where she finished runner-up to sister Serena Williams. She met Caroline Wozniacki in the final, where she found herself down a set and 0–5. Despite winning the next four games, she lost the match in two sets. She finished the year ranked No. 5 and topped the prize money list for this year.

===2018: 1000th match, struggle with form===
Williams began her 2018 season at the Sydney International, where she was the second seed and received a first-round bye. In the second round she lost to Angelique Kerber, who went on to win the tournament. As the fifth seed and defending finalist at the Australian Open, Williams lost in straight sets to Belinda Bencic in the first round, ending her streak of seven consecutive appearances in the second week of the Grand Slams, and as a result dropping considerably in the rankings as well.

Williams competed in the Fed Cup quarterfinals against the Dutch team. She won both her singles matches in straight sets against Arantxa Rus and Richèl Hogenkamp to send the United States into the semifinals. She also played her career 1000th match and earned her 20th Fed Cup singles win.

After receiving a first round bye at the Indian Wells Open, Williams defeated Sorana Cîrstea to set up a match with her sister Serena, in the third round. She defeated her for the 12th time in her career – her first straight sets victory against her since the 2008 Wimbledon Championships final almost a decade earlier. She then defeated Anastasija Sevastova in the fourth round and Suarez Navarro in the quarterfinals, both in straight sets. She then fell to Daria Kasatkina in a close three set match in the semifinals. The following week at the Miami Open, Williams saved three match points in her third round match against Dutch woman Kiki Bertens. She subsequently knocked out defending champion Johanna Konta in the fourth round, before falling rather unexpectedly to her compatriot and qualifier Danielle Collins in the quarterfinals.

Williams began her clay court season at the Madrid Open where she lost to Anett Kontaveit in the first round. Seeded eighth at the Italian Open, she received a first round bye, before defeating Elena Vesnina in three sets. She lost to Kontaveit again in the third round. Williams also played doubles with compatriot Madison Keys, but the team withdrew after winning their first round match with Keys sustaining an injury. Williams lost to Wang Qiang in the first round of the French Open, marking the first time she has lost in the first round of consecutive Grand Slam events. Williams also reached the third round in doubles with Serena, losing to third seeds Klepač and Martínez Sánchez.

The defending finalist at the Wimbledon, Williams defeated Johanna Larsson and Alexandra Dulgheru in the first and second rounds respectively, before losing to Kiki Bertens in the third round. As a result, she dropped out of the top ten rankings.

Williams began her US Open Series at the Silicon Valley Classic after accepting a wildcard, defeating Heather Watson in the second round, before losing in the quarterfinals to eventual finalist Maria Sakkari. She won her opening two rounds at the Rogers Cup before losing to the then-world No. 1, Simona Halep, hampered by a right knee injury. She withdrew from the Western &amp; Southern Open the following week with the same injury.

At the 2018 US Open, Williams defeated 2004 champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and Camila Giorgi en route to a third round encounter – and 30th career match overall, with Serena, where she was handed her most-lopsided loss against her in five years. Following the US Open, Venus withdrew from the Wuhan Open and China Open, citing &quot;she was not physically ready to compete&quot;. She was scheduled to finish her season at the Luxembourg Open, but pulled out due to a knee injury. She finished the season ranked No. 40, the first time since 2013 she failed to finish the season inside the top 20.

Williams parted ways with her long-time coach David Witt at the end of the 2018 season.

===2019: Continued struggles, out of top 50===
Williams began her 2019 season with an exhibition match against Serena at the Mubadala World Tennis Championship, which she won in the match tiebreak. Williams then played in the ASB Classic in Auckland, where she was seeded sixth. She defeated Victoria Azarenka and Lauren Davis, before losing in the quarterfinals to Bianca Andreescu in three sets. Unseeded at the Australian Open, Williams defeated Mihaela Buzărnescu and Alizé Cornet, both in three sets, to set up a meeting with the topseeded Simona Halep in the third round. Williams lost to Halep in two sets.

Ranked 36th and unseeded at Indian Wells, Williams started with a win over Andrea Petkovic, before coming back from a set and a double break down to beat the third seed Petra Kvitová in the second round. This was Williams&#x27;s first top five win since the 2017 WTA Finals. She then defeated Christina McHale and Mona Barthel to advance to her third straight Indian Wells quarterfinal, where she lost to the eighth seed and eventual runner-up, Angelique Kerber.

Ranked 43rd as she entered the Miami Open, Williams beat Dalila Jakupović, Suarez Navarro and Daria Kasatkina, all in straight sets, before falling again to third ranked Simona Halep in the fourth round.

Williams started her clay-court season as a wildcard at the Italian Open where she defeated Elise Mertens in a third set tiebreak (after three hours of play) to set up a second round match with her sister Serena. Due to a left knee injury, however, Serena was forced to withdraw from the match. Williams then fell to eventual runner-up Johanna Konta in the third round in straight sets. She subsequently fell to the ninth seed, Elina Svitolina, in the French Open first round, her second year in a row failing to win a match at the French Open.

For the first time since 2011 and fourth time in her career, Williams played a Wimbledon warmup event after accepting a wildcard into the Birmingham Classic. She defeated Aliaksandra Sasnovich in the first round to set up a meeting with Wang Qiang, which Williams also won to reach the quarterfinals, where she lost to eventual champion and new world No. 1, Ashleigh Barty. However, thanks to this run, Williams returned to the top 50 in the rankings. She also accepted a wildcard to play doubles with Harriet Dart, losing in the first round in a match tiebreak. At Wimbledon, Williams, whilst unseeded, faced compatriot Coco Gauff, a fifteen-year-old qualifier, the youngest qualifier in the history of the event. Gauff stunned Williams in a tight two-set match. The loss matched 2012 as her earliest Wimbledon exit.

===2020: Out of top 75===
Williams was scheduled to start her 2020 season at the Brisbane International but withdrew before the tournament began. She also had to withdraw from the Adelaide International.

At the Australian Open, Williams was beaten by Coco Gauff in the first round. At the Mexican Open, where she was the fifth seed, Williams was beaten by qualifier Kaja Juvan.

After a four-month break due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Williams returned to competition by playing World TeamTennis.

Her first official tournament back was the Top Seed Open, where she defeated Victoria Azarenka in the first round, then took on sister Serena for the 31st time in the second round, losing to her in a tight three-set match. Williams then fell to Dayana Yastremska in the first round of the Western &amp; Southern Open. Following the tournament, Williams dropped to No. 67 in the WTA 31 August 2020 rankings.

At the US Open, Williams lost to Karolína Muchová in the first round.

Williams travelled to Italian Open, the week after the US Open to join the rescheduled clay court swing. In the first round, she drew Azarenka for the second time in five weeks; on this occasion, Williams lost in straight sets, taking their career head-to-head record to 6–2 in Williams&#x27;s favor.
At the French Open, Williams crashed out in straight-sets to Anna Karolína Schmiedlová. She finished the year with one match win and a 1–8 tour record. Her ranking fell to 78 in the world by the end of the season.

===2021–2022: Out of the top 100, 90th major appearance===
Williams started the 2021 season at the Yarra Valley Classic, where she defeated Arantxa Rus, in straight sets, before losing in straight sets to fourth seed Petra Kvitová. She also reached the second round of the Australian Open. Since then, Williams was on a five-match losing streak and dropped out of the top 100 in May, before the French Open, to her lowest ranking since 2011. At the French Open, she lost in the first round to the 32nd seed, Ekaterina Alexandrova. She received a wildcard for the main draw of Wimbledon but she was later upgraded to the main draw as direct entry due to Naomi Osaka&#x27;s withdrawal. She won her first round match against Mihaela Buzărnescu. This was Venus Williams&#x27;s record breaking 90th Grand Slam appearance and also her 90th match win at Wimbledon.

She missed the next four Grand Slam tournaments in singles, before receiving a wildcard for the 2022 US Open. She lost in the first round in straight sets to Alison Van Uytvanck. She also played doubles with Serena at the US Open. Their first round match was the first doubles match in history to be given the nighttime slot on Center Court. The pair lost to Lucie Hradecká and Linda Nosková. With Serena&#x27;s retirement, this was the final Grand Slam tournament match for the 14-time major doubles champions. Venus later stated that when Serena retired, she too retired from playing doubles.

===2023: 30th year on the WTA Tour, ongoing struggle with injuries===
In January, she received a wildcard for the main draw of Auckland Open, and started her 30th year on the WTA Tour with a straight-sets victory over fellow American Katie Volynets in the first round. She opened the second round by winning the first set against Zhu Lin but then went on to lose the match when she dropped the next two sets. Williams received a main draw wildcard to the 2023 Australian Open but was forced to withdraw after sustaining an injury in her second round match against Lin in Auckland. The injury caused Williams to miss the rest of the hard court swing and the clay season.

Williams received a wildcard at the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships where she lost in the first round to Céline Naef. Venus then competed in the 2023 Birmingham Classic and won her first match as a 43-year-old, defeating Camilla Giorgi in over three hours in an epic three-set thriller. It was her first victory over a top 50 player in almost four years. The success was short-lived, and Williams fell in the second round to Jelena Ostapenko in another close three-set match. Williams continued to be hampered by injuries during the match and received an off-court medical timeout. Williams received a wildcard to the 2023 Wimbledon main draw but lost in straight sets to Elina Svitolina in the first round, suffering a serious knee injury. Williams expressed frustration at her improving form being affected by injuries, stating in her post-match press conference that the injuries were &quot;hard to process emotionally, mentally and physically on the court&quot;.

Williams lost in the first round of the Canadian Open in Montreal but secured her first Top 20 win in more than four years with a straight sets win over No. 16 seed Veronika Kudermetova in the Western &amp; Southern Open. She followed that win with a lopsided first set win over rising star Zheng Qinwen but eventually lost the next two sets and the match. The first set was described as &quot;vintage Venus&quot; and gave hope for Williams&#x27; return to the US Open.

At the US Open, in her first round match, which was also Williams&#x27; 100th career US Open match, she suffered one of her most lopsided Grand Slam losses, winning only two games against qualifier Greet Minnen.

Williams ended the 2023 season ranked No. 412 in the world.

===2024–2025: Multiple wildcards===
Despite her injury-plagued season in 2023, Williams announced her intention to return to action in March. While her injuries forced her to miss the Australian Summer hardcourt swing, she said her target was to participate in the US hardcourt tournaments in Indian Wells and in Miami. She lost in the first round of both tournaments to Nao Hibino and Diana Shnaider respectively.

In 2025, Williams again received a main-draw wildcard for Indian Wells, but turned it down.

==Fight for equal prize money==
Despite years of protesting by tennis pioneer Billie Jean King and others, in 2005 the French Open and Wimbledon still refused to pay women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s players equally through all rounds. In 2005, Williams met with officials from both tournaments, arguing that female tennis players should be paid as much as male tennis players.

The turning point was an essay published in &quot;The Times&quot; on the eve of Wimbledon in 2006. In it, Williams accused Wimbledon of being on the &quot;wrong side of history&quot;. In response, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of Parliament publicly endorsed Williams&#x27;s arguments. Later that year, the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association and UNESCO teamed for a campaign to promote gender equality in sports, asking Williams to lead the campaign. Under enormous pressure, Wimbledon announced in February 2007 that it would award equal prize money to all competitors in all rounds, and the French Open followed suit a day later. In the aftermath, the Chicago &quot;Sun-Times&quot; cited Williams as &quot;the single factor&quot; that &quot;changed the minds of the boys&quot; and a leader whose &quot;willingness to take a public stand separates her not only from most of her female peers, but also from our most celebrated male athletes&quot;. Williams herself commented, &quot;Somewhere in the world a little girl is dreaming of holding a giant trophy in her hands and being viewed as an equal to boys who have similar dreams.&quot;

Williams herself became the first woman to benefit from the equalization of prize money at Wimbledon, as she won the 2007 tournament and was awarded the same amount as the male winner Roger Federer. Williams&#x27;s fight for equality was documented in &quot;Nine for IX&quot;, &quot;Venus Vs.&quot; It premiered on July 2, 2013.

==Other on court activities==
===1998: Karsten Braasch vs. the Williams sisters===
Williams, along with her sister Serena, competed in a &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; against Karsten Braasch at the 1998 Australian Open. Braasch, the world&#x27;s 203rd-ranked player, was more than 13 years older than the sisters and was described by a journalist as &quot;a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple bottles of ice cold lager.&quot; However, he defeated both sisters in a single set against each, beating Serena 6–1 and Venus 6–2.

==Personal life==

In 2003, Yetunde Price, Venus and Serena Williams&#x27;s 31-year-old sister and their personal assistant, was shot dead in Compton, California near the courts on which the sisters once practiced.

It was modeled by athletes rather than models, as Williams chose to feature the type of people for whom the line was designed. She also wears outfits from her fashion line on the tennis court.

In June 2009, Williams was named 77th in the Top 100 Most Powerful Celebrities list compiled by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine.

<doc id="167381" wikidata="Q2166038" url="?curid=167381" title="Ronny &amp; the Daytonas">
<text>Ronny &amp; the Daytonas were an American surf rock group, whose members included John &quot;Bucky&quot; Wilkin (aka Ronny Dayton) (songwriting, guitar, vocals), Paul Jensen (vocals, guitar), Thomas Ramey (bass, guitar), Lynn Williams (drums), and Lee Kraft (guitar), with contributions from others such as Larry Butler (organ), Ronny Clark (studio guitarist), and Buzz Cason.

==History==
The group was formed in Nashville, Tennessee in 1964 when Bill Justis (best known for his hit &quot;Raunchy&quot;) became their manager and formed Buckhorn Music with the help of Wilkin&#x27;s mother, Marijohn Wilkin, a country music writer. Signed to Mala Records, a sublabel of Bell Records, their primary contribution to popular music was in injecting country-sounds into the burgeoning surfrock scene. Their 1964 debut single &quot;G.T.O.&quot; reached No. 4 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.
A subsequent single, &quot;Bucket T&quot; reached No. 54 on the Billboard chart that same year.

After an album and tour in 1964, Ronny &amp; The Daytonas had another hit in 1965 with a ballad, &quot;Sandy&quot;, and an album that reflected a similar country-inflected surfer sound. In 1966 Ronny and The Daytonas switched to RCA Records and released a romantic ballad called &quot;Diane, Diane&quot; and the upbeat &quot;All American Girl&quot;, both of which had some success on the charts. The band toured for a short time after this before disbanding.

In 1965, Buzz Cason and John &quot;Bucky&quot; Wilkin recorded the single &quot;Bay City&quot; / &quot;Tiger A-Go-Go&quot; as Buzz and Bucky. The single did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but peaked at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.

The mid-1980s saw some interest in re-uniting various band members for a few engagements. The last known appearances of The Daytonas were at a concert in upstate New York on July 4, 1995, at the Woodward Dream Cruise in Michigan in 2000 and 2002, and at The Baby Boomer Legends concert at &quot;The Factory&quot; in Franklin, Tennessee on April 24, 2015. 

, Buck Wilkin Music publishing was licensing Ronny &amp; The Daytonas songs for the U.S. and Canada, and occasionally published their music on 180 gram vinyl media in limited production runs.

<text>The Surfaris are an American surf music band formed in Glendora, California, in 1962. They are best known for two songs that hit the charts in the Los Angeles area, and nationally by May 1963: &quot;Surfer Joe&quot; and &quot;Wipe Out&quot;, which were the A-side and B-side of the same 45 rpm single.

The Surfaris were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2019 for their hit instrumental song, &quot;Wipe Out&quot;.

==Career==
The original band members were Ron Wilson (drums, vocals), Jim Fuller (lead guitar), Bob Berryhill (rhythm guitar), and Pat Connolly (bass).

In the fall of 1962, Southern California high school students Jim Fuller and Pat Connolly called friend and guitarist Berryhill for a practice session at Berryhill&#x27;s house. The trio practiced for about four hours and met drummer Wilson at a high school dance later that evening, whereupon the band was born. &quot;Wipe Out&quot; was written and recorded by the quartet later that winter, with the song reaching #2 nationally in 1963 before becoming an international hit.

Saxophone player Jim Pash joined after their &quot;Wipe Out&quot; / &quot;Surfer Joe&quot; recording sessions at Pal Studios engineer Paul Buff. Band manager John Reisman from the Fuller/Pash lineup of the band in the 80&#x27;s points out that Jim Pash is on the Wipe Out cover and was a member of the band in 1962. Pash told Reisman that his Pash&#x27;s mother said he had to stay home and do chores the day the band went to the studio to record Surfer Joe, and that &#x27;Wipe Out&#x27; was written on the spot when Paul C. Buff, the engineer, said what are you going to put on the B-side. Fuller wrote the main lick and Ron Wilson added a drum cadence he had been working on for the high school band. In a conversation with Paul Buff, Buff told Reisman that the song &#x27;Wipe Out&#x27; was recorded on Dec. 4, 1962.

Ken Forssi, later of Love, played bass with The Surfaris after Pat Connolly left.

==&quot;Wipe Out&quot;==
Wilson&#x27;s energetic drum solo made &quot;Wipe Out&quot; one of the best-remembered instrumental songs of the period. &quot;Wipe Out&quot; is also remembered particularly for its introduction. Before the music starts, Berryhill&#x27;s dad broke a board (imitating a breaking surf board) near the mic, followed by a maniacal laugh and the words &quot;Wipe Out&quot; spoken by band manager Dale Smallin. &quot;Wipe Out&quot; was written in the studio by the four original members (Berryhill, Connolly, Fuller, and Wilson). It was initially issued on the tiny DFS label (#11/12) in January 1963. It was reissued on the tiny Princess label (#50) in February 1963. It was picked up by Dot (45-16479) in April 1963, and later reissued as Dot 45-144 in April 1965. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc.

Following the death of television personality Morton Downey, Jr., news reports and obituaries incorrectly credited him as the composer of &quot;Wipe Out&quot; (as well as The Chantays&#x27; &quot;Pipeline&quot;). , Downey&#x27;s official website continued to make this claim but it has been changed to state he &quot;also played major roles in the production of the hit surf music era songs &#x27;Pipeline&#x27; and &#x27;Wipeout&#x27;.&quot;

==Disbanding and reformation==
The band released a series of records, with two other singles, &quot;Surfer Joe&quot; and &quot;Point Panic&quot; (another group-composed instrumental), having an impact on the charts. Point Panic is a renowned surfing venue in Hawaii after which the song was named.

The original 1963 membership remained intact until August 1965 when Connolly departed before their Japanese tour. Ken Forssi replaced him on bass for the tour. Fuller resigned after the tour and the band folded in early 1966. Forssi died from a brain tumor in 1998. Ken Forssi joined the group and was the bass player for their &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me, Babe&quot; LP recorded at Capitol Records in Studio A in late Spring and early Summer of 1965.

Pat Connolly left the music business in 1965.

Ron Wilson died of a brain aneurysm on May 12, 1989, one month short of his 45th birthday. Wilson had released an album of his songs, entitled &quot;Lost In The Surf&quot;, on Bennet House Records of Grass Valley, California, which was recorded in June 1987. A very small number of cassettes of this album were produced. &quot;Lost in the Surf&quot; included a cover of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, complete with Scottish bagpipes.

Jim Pash, who played saxophone in the earlier formation and was later a guitarist, died April 29, 2005, of heart failure at age 56.

Jim Fuller co-founded the Surfaris in 61&#x27; with Connolly. The band reformed in 81&#x27; with Pash and Berryhill but in 1983 Berryhill left the band because neither Pash nor Fuller wanted Berryhill&#x27;s wife to join the band as bassist. By the mid-&#x27;80s, Fuller&#x27;s The Surfaris added new players, such as Kelly Lammers, Robert Watson, Jay Truax, Paul Johnson (Mr. Moto), and Dave Raven, among others. These new band members remain in The Surfaris today.
However, in 1986 John P. Reisman took over management of the Fuller/Pash version of &#x27;The Surfaris&#x27;. In 1987, the manager engaged the band with Columbia Pictures &#x27;New Gidget Show&#x27; and in 1987 recorded the cut &#x27;Bred to Shred&#x27; for the episode (Jim Pash: Producer; John Reisman; Engineer). The full band with the latest lineup appeared in the production. Just prior to that Chris Pritchard was in the lineup on vocals and guitar. During that period the manager focused on fairs and festivals, playing for audiences of ten to one hundred thousand at times. However, the band did continue to play clubs to bring the music to as many venues as possible. Bill Silva Entertainment during this period of management known as Fahn &amp; Silva Entertainment handled the contracting. 

Jim Fuller later had another band concurrently with The Surfaris &quot;Jim Fuller and the Beatnik&quot;, until his passing on March 3, 2017, in Arcadia, California at age 69.

After leaving the band, Berryhill became a teacher until late 2000, when he created a new band with his family and named it The Surfaris. Now the last original member playing professionally, Berryhill performs worldwide as The Surfaris with his wife Gene Berryhill and sons, Deven and Joel Berryhill. In 2003, Berryhill&#x27;s band re-recorded &quot;Wipe Out&quot; and eight original songs, which is what he wanted to do for the first &quot;Wipe Out&quot; session in 1962. At the time, the boys just 15 and 17 years old were forced to play other writers&#x27; songs, not by The Surfaris, which were later replaced by the company&#x27;s players while The Surfaris were on tour. Lawsuits ensued in favor of The Surfaris. In 2015, Berryhill recorded and released the album entitled &quot;The Surfaris Hurley Sessions&quot;.

<text>The Calgary Outlaws were an independent minor league baseball team in the Canadian Baseball League. Based in Calgary, Alberta, they shared Foothills Stadium with the Calgary Dawgs.

<text>A memoir (; , ) is any nonfiction narrative writing based on the author&#x27;s personal memories. The assertions made in the work are thus understood to be factual. While memoir has historically been defined as a subcategory of biography or autobiography since the late 20th century, the genre is differentiated in form, presenting a narrowed focus, usually a particular time phase in someone&#x27;s life or career. A biography or autobiography tells the story &quot;of a life&quot;, while a memoir often tells the story of a particular career, event, or time, such as touchstone moments and turning points in the author&#x27;s life. The author of a memoir may be referred to as a memoirist or a memorialist.

==Early memoirs==
Memoirs have been written since the ancient times, as shown by Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, also known as &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic Wars&quot;. In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the Gallic Wars. His second memoir, &quot;Commentarii de Bello Civili&quot; (or &quot;Commentaries on the Civil War&quot;) is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in the civil war against Gnaeus Pompeius and the Senate. The noted Libanius, teacher of rhetoric who lived between an estimated 314 and 394 AD, framed his life memoir as one of his literary orations, which were written to be read aloud in the privacy of his study. This kind of memoir refers to the idea in ancient Greece and Rome, that memoirs were like &quot;memos&quot;, or pieces of unfinished and unpublished writing, which a writer might use as a memory aid to make a more finished document later on.

The &quot;Sarashina Nikki&quot; is an example of an early Japanese memoir, written in the Heian period. A genre of book writing, Nikki Bungaku, emerged during this time. Themes of court life, introspection, and emotional expressiveness were frequently explored in Japanese memoirs; Sarashina Nikki is among the most well-known examples. 
In the Middle Ages, Geoffrey of Villehardouin, Jean de Joinville, and Philippe de Commines wrote memoirs, while the genre was represented toward the end of the Renaissance, through the works of Blaise de Montluc and Margaret of Valois, that she was the first woman to write her &quot;Memoirs&quot; in modern-style. One of the first known examples of medieval memoir writing is Villehardouin&#x27;s De la Conquête de Constantinople, which provides a first-hand narrative of the Fourth Crusade.

Until the Age of Enlightenment encompassing the 17th and 18th centuries, works of memoir were written by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury; François de La Rochefoucauld, Prince de Marcillac of France; and Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon, who wrote &quot;Memoirs&quot; at his family&#x27;s home at the castle of La Ferté-Vidame. While Saint-Simon was considered a writer possessing a high level of skill for narrative and character development, it was not until well after his death that his work as a memoirist was recognized, resulting in literary fame.

==From the eighteenth century==

Over the latter half of the 18th through the mid-20th century, memoirists generally included those who were noted within their chosen profession. These authors wrote as a way to record and publish their own account of their public exploits. Authors included politicians or people in court society and were later joined by military leaders and businessmen. An exception to these models is Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s 1854 memoir &quot;Walden&quot;, which presents his experiences over the course of two years in a cabin he built near Walden Pond. Thoreau&#x27;s memoir, which emphasized the individual&#x27;s interaction with nature and independence, became a key work of American literature, especially within the transcendentalist movement.

Twentieth-century war memoirs became a genre of their own, including, from the First World War, Ernst Jünger (&quot;Storm of Steel&quot;) and Frederic Manning&#x27;s &quot;Her Privates We&quot;. Memoirs documenting incarceration by Nazi Germany during the war include Primo Levi&#x27;s &quot;If This Is a Man&quot;, which covers his arrest as a member of the Italian Resistance Movement, followed by his life as a prisoner in Auschwitz; and Elie Wiesel&#x27;s &quot;Night&quot;, which is based on his life prior to and during his time in the Auschwitz, Buna Werke, and Buchenwald concentration camps.

==Memoirs today==
In the early 1990s, memoirs written by ordinary people experienced a sudden upsurge, as an increasing number of people realized that their ancestors&#x27; and their own stories were about to disappear, in part as a result of the opportunities and distractions of technological advances. At the same time, psychology and other research began to show that familiarity with genealogy helps people find their place in the world and that life review helps people come to terms with their own past. The popularity of the memoir field was also helped by the emergence of social media platforms, as people started writing down and sharing their personal stories to large audiences.

With the advent of inexpensive digital book production in the first decade of the 21st century, the genre exploded. Memoirs written as a way to pass down a personal legacy, rather than as a literary work of art or historical document, are emerging as a personal and family responsibility.

The Association of Personal Historians was a trade association for professionals who assisted individuals, families, and organizations in documenting their life stories. It dissolved in 2017.

== Collections ==
With the expressed interest of preserving history through the eyes of those who lived it, some organizations work with potential memoirists to bring their work to fruition. The Veterans History Project, for example, compiles the memoirs of those who have served in a branch of the United States Armed Forces – especially those who have seen active combat.

== Terminology ==
Memoirs are usually understood to be factual accounts of people&#x27;s lives, typically from their early years, and are derived from the French term &quot;mémoire&quot;, meaning &quot;reminiscence&quot; or &quot;memory.&quot; However, some works, which may be called free memoirs, are less strictly bound to remembered facts: &quot;One type of life story is the &quot;free memoir&quot;, a form of nonfiction that, in presenting the past, deviates from factual and literal accuracy. This play of truth distinguishes the free memoir from the memoir per se, the word &#x27;free&#x27; meaning what it does in &quot;free translation&quot;, that is, &#x27;not literal or exact.&#x27;” 

== Academia ==
The term &#x27;memoir&#x27; is used in some academic contexts to describe an essay on a learned subject. Examples include explanatory texts accompanying geologic maps.

<doc id="167390" wikidata="Q244774" url="?curid=167390" title="Twin Earth thought experiment">
<text>Twin Earth is a thought experiment proposed by philosopher Hilary Putnam in his papers &quot;Meaning and Reference&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Meaning of &#x27;Meaning (1975). It is meant to serve as an illustration of his argument for semantic externalism, or the view that the meanings of words are not purely psychological. The &quot;Twin Earth&quot; thought experiment was one of three examples that Putnam offered in support of semantic externalism, the other two being what he called the &quot;Aluminum-Molybdenum&quot; case and the &quot;Beech-Elm&quot; case. Since the publication of these cases, numerous variations on the thought experiment have been proposed by philosophers.

== The thought experiment ==
Putnam&#x27;s original formulation of the experiment was this: We begin by supposing that elsewhere in the universe there is a planet exactly like Earth in virtually all aspects, which we refer to as &quot;Twin Earth&quot;. (We should also suppose that the relevant surroundings are exactly the same as for Earth; it revolves around a star that appears to be exactly like our sun, and so on). On Twin Earth, there is a Twin equivalent of every person and thing here on Earth. The one difference between the two planets is that there is no water on Twin Earth. In its place there is a liquid that is superficially identical, but is chemically different, being composed not of H2O, but rather of some more complicated formula which we abbreviate as &quot;XYZ&quot;. The Twin Earthlings who refer to their language as &quot;English&quot; call XYZ &quot;water&quot;. Finally, we set the date of our thought experiment to be several centuries ago, when the residents of Earth and Twin Earth would have no means of knowing that the liquids they called &quot;water&quot; were H2O and XYZ respectively. The experience of people on Earth with water and that of those on Twin Earth with XYZ would be identical.

Now the question arises: when an Earthling (or Oscar for simplicity&#x27;s sake) and his twin on Twin Earth say &#x27;water&#x27;, do they mean the same thing? (The twin is also called &#x27;Oscar&#x27; on his own planet, of course. Indeed, the inhabitants of that planet call their own planet &#x27;Earth&#x27;. For convenience, we refer to this putative planet as &#x27;Twin Earth&#x27;, and extend this naming convention to the objects and people that inhabit it, in this case referring to Oscar&#x27;s twin as Twin Oscar.) &quot;Ex hypothesi&quot;, they are in identical psychological states, with the same thoughts, feelings, etc. Yet, at least according to Putnam, when Oscar says &#x27;water&#x27;, the term refers to H2O, whereas when Twin Oscar says &#x27;water&#x27; it refers to XYZ. The result of this is that the contents of a person&#x27;s brain are not sufficient to determine the reference of terms they use, as one must also examine the causal history that led to this individual acquiring the term. (Oscar, for instance, learned the word &#x27;water&#x27; in a world filled with H2O, whereas Twin Oscar learned &#x27;water&#x27; in a world filled with XYZ.)

This is the essential thesis of semantic externalism. Putnam famously summarized this conclusion with the statement that meanings&#x27; just ain&#x27;t in the head.&quot;

==Criticism==
In his original article, Putnam had claimed that the reference of the twins&#x27; &quot;water&quot; varied even though their psychological states were the same. Tyler Burge subsequently argued in &quot;Other Bodies&quot; (1982) that the twins&#x27; mental states are different: Oscar has the concept &quot;H2O&quot;, while Twin Oscar has the concept &quot;XYZ&quot;. Putnam has since expressed agreement with Burge&#x27;s interpretation of the thought experiment. (See Putnam&#x27;s introduction in Pessin and Goldberg 1996, xxi.)

A number of philosophers have argued that &quot;water&quot; for both Oscar and Twin Oscar refers to anything that is sufficiently water-like (i.e. the term&#x27;s extension includes both H2O and XYZ). They reject, therefore, the contention that &quot;water&quot; is a rigid designator referring to H2O. John Searle, for example, argues (&quot;Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind&quot;) that, once we discover that our water is H2O, we have the choice of either redefining it as H2O (a classical reduction redefinition) or continuing to allow the term water to refer to anything with the basic properties of water (transparency, wetness, etc.). Searle suggests that in the Twin-Earth example, the second seems more plausible, since if Twin Earth doesn&#x27;t have water, then all its water-based products will also be different. Twin ice cream, for example, will be constitutionally different, yet we will still be tempted to call it ice cream. Searle, along with others, considers this sufficient argument to &quot;solve&quot; the thought experiment altogether; others, such as Donald Davidson, feel that variations on the experiment can be used to draw some of the same conclusions.

Paul Boghossian raised an objection to the class of Twin-Earth-style arguments for externalism in the form of an argument that aims to show that externalism is incompatible with privileged self-knowledge. Here, privileged self-knowledge is taken to be the idea that one can know the content of one&#x27;s thoughts without having to investigate the external world (for empirical evidence). Although this type of argument does not directly disprove externalism, it is pressing because of the intuitive plausibility of privileged self-knowledge&#x27;s existence.

Some philosophers believe that such science-fiction thought experiments (like the Twin-Earth) should be examined carefully. They argue that when a thought experiment describes a state of affairs that is radically different from the actual one (or what we think it to be), our intuitions can become unreliable, and hence the philosophical conclusions drawn from them may also be unreliable. Daniel Dennett calls Twin Earth and other experiments like it &quot;intuition pumps&quot;, as they are designed in such a way to allow the thinker to use their intuition to guide them through the problem. Some philosophers take the Twin-Earth thought experiment/intuition pump to engage faulty intuitions, and hence lead to faulty conclusions. Phil Hutchinson, for example, notes that a) if one looks at Putnam&#x27;s own later criticisms of others (for example his criticisms of Jaegwon Kim in his book &quot;The Threefold Cord&quot;) one finds that implicitly he criticises his own earlier self; and b) that the persuasive power of the Twin Earth thought experiment/intuition pump relies on our turning a blind eye to aspects of the experiment in order that it establish that which Putnam claims it to. In short, the thought experiment is set up in such a way that one&#x27;s intuitions will be pumped in the desired direction.

John McDowell, in his paper &quot;Putnam on Mind and Meaning&quot;, criticised Putnam for still having in play a latent commitment to a picture of the mind as modelled on the brain and located in the head. Putnam has since conceded the point and subscribes to McDowell&#x27;s neo-Wittgensteinian therapeutic invocation of the mind as a structured system of object involving abilities (what Putnam has since defended as a neo-Aristotelian picture of mind). Phil Hutchinson has since argued that this concession to McDowell means that the distinction which Putnam wishes to operationalize, between intension and extension, is now problematized.

John Dupré, in a number of papers and mainly in his paper &quot;Natural Kinds and Biological Taxa&quot;, has demonstrated that the theory of natural kinds, which many have taken to be established and/or supported by Putnam&#x27;s Twin Earth thought experiment does not find support in the practice of scientific classification. Avrum Stroll has produced probably the most comprehensive critique of the program of natural kind semantics (both Putnam&#x27;s and Kripke&#x27;s) in his book &quot;Sketches of Landscapes&quot;. Putnam, who is well known for changing his philosophical positions on a variety of issues, criticized the experiment later in life because it is anti-functionalist.

<text>Gospel music is a traditional genre of Christian music and a cornerstone of Christian media. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context. Gospel music is composed and performed for many purposes, including aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, and as an entertainment product for the marketplace. Gospel music is characterized by dominant vocals and strong use of harmony with Christian lyrics. Gospel music can be traced to the early 17th century.

Hymns and sacred songs were often performed in a call and response fashion, heavily influenced by ancestral African music. Most of the churches relied on hand–clapping and foot–stomping as rhythmic accompaniment. Most of the singing was done a cappella. The first published use of the term &quot;gospel song&quot; appeared in 1874.

The original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as George F. Root, Philip Bliss, Charles H. Gabriel, William Howard Doane, and Fanny Crosby. Gospel music publishing houses emerged. The advent of radio in the 1920s greatly increased the audience for gospel music. Following World War II, gospel music moved into major auditoriums, and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate.

Black and Southern gospel music are largely responsible for gospel&#x27;s continued presence in contemporary Christian music, with soul music by far the best–known popular music variant. The styles emerged from the African-American music and American folk music traditions and have evolved in various ways over the years, continuing to form the basis of Black church worship even today. It has also come to be used in churches of various other cultural traditions (especially within Pentecostalism) and, via the gospel choir phenomenon spearheaded by Thomas Dorsey, has become a form of musical devotion worldwide. Southern Afroamerican gospel groups used all–male, tenor–lead–baritone–bass quartets. Sensational Nightingales, the Soul Stirrers, Swan Silvertones and the Dixie Hummingbirds were famous gospel groups. Christian country music, sometimes referred to as country gospel music, is a subgenre of gospel music with a country flair. Famous Christian country music performers were Grandpa Jones, Webb Pierce, Porter Wagoner and the Oak Ridge Boys. British black gospel refers to Gospel music of the African diaspora produced in the United Kingdom.

== History ==
According to Yale University music professor Willie Ruff, the singing of psalms in Scottish Gaelic by Presbyterians of the Scottish Hebrides evolved from &quot;lining out&quot;—where one person sang a solo and others followed—into the call and response of gospel music of the American South. Another theory notes foundations in the works of Isaac Watts and others.

Moreover, the genre arose during a time when literacy was not a guarantee, utilizing a great deal of repetition (which, unlike more traditional hymns, allowed those who could not read the opportunity to participate).

=== 18th century ===
Perhaps the most famous gospel–based hymns were composed in the 1760s and 1770s by English writers John Newton (&quot;Amazing Grace&quot;) and Augustus Toplady (&quot;Rock of Ages&quot;), members of the Anglican Church. Starting out as lyrics only, it took decades for standardized tunes to be added to them. Although not directly connected with African–American gospel music, they were adopted by African–Americans as well as white Americans, and Newton&#x27;s connection with the abolition movement provided cross–fertilization.

=== Holiness-Pentecostal era (19th century) ===

The first published use of the term &quot;Gospel song&quot; probably appeared in 1874 when Philip Bliss released a songbook entitled &quot;Gospel Songs. A Choice Collection of Hymns and Tunes&quot;. It was used to describe a new style of church music, songs that were easy to grasp and more easily singable than the traditional church hymns, which came out of the mass revival movement starting with Dwight L. Moody, whose musician was Ira D. Sankey, as well as the Holiness–Pentecostal movement. Prior to the meeting of Moody and Sankey in 1870, there was an American rural/frontier history of revival and camp meeting songs, but the gospel hymn was of a different character, and it served the needs of mass revivals in the great cities.

The revival movement employed popular singers and song leaders, the most famous of them being Ira D. Sankey. The original &quot;gospel&quot; songs were written and composed by authors such as George F. Root, Philip Bliss, Charles H. Gabriel, William Howard Doane, and Fanny Crosby. As an extension to his initial publication &quot;Gospel Songs&quot;, Philip Bliss, in collaboration with Ira D. Sankey issued no&#x27;s. 1 to 6 of &quot;Gospel Hymns&quot; in 1875. Sankey and Bliss&#x27;s collection can be found in many libraries today.

The popularity of revival singers and the openness of rural churches to this type of music (in spite of its initial use in city revivals) led to the late 19th and early 20th century establishment of gospel music publishing houses such as those of Homer Rodeheaver, E. O. Excell, Charlie Tillman, and Charles Tindley. These publishers were in the market for large quantities of new music, providing an outlet for the creative work of many songwriters and composers.

The advent of radio in the 1920s greatly increased the audience for gospel music, and James D. Vaughan used radio as an integral part of his business model, which also included traveling quartets to publicize the gospel music books he published several times a year. Virgil O. Stamps and Jesse R. Baxter studied Vaughan&#x27;s business model and by the late 1920s were running heavy competition for Vaughan. The 1920s also saw the marketing of gospel records by groups such as the Carter Family.

=== Emergence of Black gospel (1920s–1970s) ===
The Pentecostal movement quickly made inroads with churches not attuned to the Europeanized Black church music that had become popular over the years since Emancipation. These congregations readily adopted and contributed to the gospel music publications of the early 20th century. Sister Rosetta Tharpe, pioneer of rock and roll, soon emerged from this tradition as the first great gospel recording artist. The first person to introduce ragtime to gospel (and the first to play piano on a gospel recording) was Arizona Dranes.

The 1930s saw the rise of Black gospel quartets such as the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi and the Five Blind Boys of Alabama. In addition to these high–profile quartets, there were many Black gospel musicians performing in the 1920s and 30s, usually playing the guitar and singing in the streets of Southern cities.

In the 1930s, in Chicago, Thomas A. Dorsey turned to gospel music, establishing a publishing house. It has been said that 1930 was the year traditional black gospel music began, as the National Baptist Convention first publicly endorsed the music at its 1930 meeting. Dorsey was responsible for developing the musical careers of many African–American artists, such as Mahalia Jackson (best known for her rendition of his &quot;Precious Lord, Take My Hand&quot;).

Meanwhile, radio continued to develop an audience for gospel music, a fact that was commemorated in Albert E. Brumley&#x27;s 1937 song, &quot;Turn Your Radio On&quot; (which is still being published in gospel song books). (In 1972, a recording of &quot;Turn Your Radio On&quot; by the Lewis Family was nominated for Gospel Song of the Year.) The Soul Stirrers introduced R.H. Harris, Sam Cooke, and Johnnie Taylor. Sensational Nightingales, Swan Silvertones, the Soul Stirrers, The Blind Boys of Alabama, Five Blind Boys of Mississippi and the Dixie Hummingbirds were popular in afroamerican gospel fans.

In 1964, the Gospel Music Association was established, which in turn began the Dove Awards (in 1969) and the Gospel Music Hall of Fame (in 1972). Both of the latter two groups began primarily for Southern gospel performers, but in the late 1970s, began including artists of other subgenres, which brought in many Black artists. Deep gospel Artists such as James Cleveland and Aretha Franklin performanced traditional gospel style. In 1969, James Cleveland established the Gospel Music Workshop of America, a Black gospel outlet.

Late 20th–century musicians such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and the Blackwood Brothers were also known for their gospel influences and recordings.

=== Contemporary Black gospel and gospel rap (1970s–present) ===

Urban contemporary gospel emerged in the late 1960s and early 70s with the Edwin Hawkins Singers highly popular gospel song &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot; (1969) which is still performed worldwide in the 2000s. Pop gospel musician Andraé Crouch and the Clark Sisters followed them. And this pattern would repeat itself in subsequent decades, with new artists like Yolanda Adams and Kirk Franklin making increasingly more bold forays into the secular world with their musical stylings. The current sphere of Black gospel recording artists is almost exclusively of the urban contemporary bent.

Also of note is the rise of Christian (or gospel) rap/hip–hop, which has gained increasing popularity since the days of the Gospel Gangstaz and The Cross Movement. Often considered a subgenre of urban contemporary gospel, Christian rap has become dominated in present times by artists from Reach Records, who have seen perhaps the most commercial success of any artists in the gospel genre; Lecrae (the label&#x27;s founder and preeminent artist) has charted in the top 10 of on the Billboard 200 three times, with his 2014 album &quot;Anomaly&quot; debuting at No. 1.

== Subgenres ==
=== Black gospel ===
==== Traditional ====

Traditional Black gospel music is the most well–known form, often seen in Black churches, non–Black Pentecostal and evangelical churches, and in entertainment spaces across the country and world. It originates from the Southeastern United States (&quot;the South&quot;), where most Black Americans lived prior to the Great Migration. This music was highly influenced by the hymnody of the spirituals and of Watts and, later, the musical style and vision of Dorsey. Whereas northern Black churches did not at first welcome Dorsey&#x27;s music (having become accustomed to their own more Eurocentric flavorings), after the Southern migrants&#x27; new churches became more popular, so did gospel music, gospel choirs, and the general trend toward exclusive use of this music in Black churches. Dorsey, Whitney Houston, Mahalia Jackson, the Mississippi Mass Choir, and the Georgia Mass Choir are but a few notable examples.

==== Urban contemporary ====

Developing out of the fusion of traditional Black gospel with the styles of secular Black music popular in the 70s and 80s, Urban Contemporary gospel is the most common form of recorded gospel music today. It relies heavily on rhythms and instrumentation common in the secular music of the contemporary era (often including the use of electronic beats), while still incorporating the themes and heritage of the traditional Black gospel genre. Kirk Franklin is the foremost (and by far the bestselling) individual in this genre, while Andrae Crouch, the Clark Sisters, Mary Mary, and Yolanda Adams are also very popular and noteworthy.

==== British ====
British black gospel refers to gospel music of the African diaspora in the UK. It is also often referred to as &quot;UK gospel&quot;. The distinctive sound is heavily influenced by UK street culture with many artists from the African and Caribbean majority black churches in the UK. The genre has gained recognition in various awards such as the GEM (Gospel Entertainment Music) Awards, MOBO Awards, Urban Music Awards and has its own Official Christian &amp; Gospel Albums Chart.

=== Southern gospel music ===

Southern gospel music comes from the Southeastern United States and is similar in sound to Christian country music, but it sometimes known as &quot;quartet music&quot; for its traditional &quot;four men and a piano&quot; set up. The genre, while remaining predominantly White, began to integrate Black gospel stylings in the 1960s. It has evolved over the years into a popular form of music across the United States and overseas, especially among baby boomers and those living in the South. Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of southern gospel varies according to culture and social context. 

=== Christian country music ===

Christian country music, sometimes referred to as country gospel music, is a subgenre of gospel music with a country flair, is also known as inspirational country. Webb Pierce, the Oak Ridge Boys and Granpa Jones recorded Christian country music records. Christian country over the years has progressed into a mainstream country sound with inspirational or positive country lyrics. In the mid–1990s, Christian country hit its highest popularity. This popularity was such that mainstream artists like Larry Gatlin, Charlie Daniels and Barbara Mandrell, just to name a few, began recording music that had this positive Christian country flair. These mainstream artists have now become award winners in this genre.

== Comparison to other hymnody ==
Some proponents of &quot;standard&quot; hymns generally dislike gospel music of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, believing that it emphasizes emotion over doctrine. For example, Patrick and Sydnor complain that commercial success led to a proliferation of such music, and &quot;deterioration, even in a standard which to begin with was not high, resulted.&quot; They went on to say, &quot;there is no doubt that a deterioration in taste follows the use of this type of hymn and tune; it fosters an attachment to the trivial and sensational which dulls and often destroys sense of the dignity and beauty which best befit the song that is used in the service of God.&quot;

Gold reviewed the issue in 1958, and collected a number of quotations similar to the complaints of Patrick and Sydnor. However, he also provided this quotation: &quot;Gospel hymnody has the distinction of being America&#x27;s most typical contribution to Christian song. As such, it is valid in its inspiration and in its employment.&quot;

Today, with historical distance, there is a greater acceptance of such gospel songs into official denominational hymnals. For example, the United Methodist Church made this acceptance explicit in &quot;The Faith We Sing&quot;, a 2000 supplement to the official denominational hymnal. In the preface, the editors say, &quot;Experience has shown that some older treasures were missed when the current hymnals were compiled.&quot;

<doc id="167394" wikidata="Q190529" url="?curid=167394" title="Nicolas Bourbaki">
<text>Nicolas Bourbaki () is the collective pseudonym of a group of mathematicians, predominantly French alumni of the École normale supérieure (ENS). Founded in 1934–1935, the Bourbaki group originally intended to prepare a new textbook in analysis. Over time the project became much more ambitious, growing into a large series of textbooks published under the Bourbaki name, meant to treat modern pure mathematics. The series is known collectively as the &quot;Éléments de mathématique&quot; (&quot;Elements of Mathematics&quot;), the group&#x27;s central work. Topics treated in the series include set theory, abstract algebra, topology, analysis, Lie groups and Lie algebras.

Bourbaki was founded in response to the effects of the First World War which caused the death of a generation of French mathematicians; as a result, young university instructors were forced to use dated texts. While teaching at the University of Strasbourg, Henri Cartan complained to his colleague André Weil of the inadequacy of available course material, which prompted Weil to propose a meeting with others in Paris to collectively write a modern analysis textbook. The group&#x27;s core founders were Cartan, Claude Chevalley, Jean Delsarte, Jean Dieudonné and Weil; others participated briefly during the group&#x27;s early years, and membership has changed gradually over time. Although former members openly discuss their past involvement with the group, Bourbaki has a custom of keeping its current membership secret.

The group&#x27;s name derives from the 19th century French general Charles-Denis Bourbaki, who had a career of successful military campaigns before suffering a dramatic loss in the Franco-Prussian War. The name was therefore familiar to early 20th-century French students. Weil remembered an ENS student prank in which an upperclassman posed as a professor and presented a &quot;theorem of Bourbaki&quot;; the name was later adopted.

The Bourbaki group holds regular private conferences for the purpose of drafting and expanding the &quot;Éléments&quot;. Topics are assigned to subcommittees, drafts are debated, and unanimous agreement is required before a text is deemed fit for publication. Although slow and labor-intensive, the process results in a work which meets the group&#x27;s standards for rigour and generality. The group is also associated with the Séminaire Bourbaki, a regular series of lectures presented by members and non-members of the group, also published and disseminated as written documents. Bourbaki maintains an office at the ENS.

Nicolas Bourbaki was influential in 20th-century mathematics, particularly during the middle of the century when volumes of the &quot;Éléments&quot; appeared frequently. The group is noted among mathematicians for its rigorous presentation and for introducing the notion of a mathematical structure, an idea related to the broader, interdisciplinary concept of structuralism. Bourbaki&#x27;s work informed the New Math, a trend in elementary math education during the 1960s. Although the group remains active, its influence is considered to have declined due to infrequent publication of new volumes of the &quot;Éléments&quot;. However, since 2012 the group has published four new (or significantly revised) volumes, the most recent in 2023 (treating spectral theory). Moreover, at least three further volumes are under preparation.

==Background==
Charles-Denis Sauter Bourbaki was a successful general during the era of Napoleon III, serving in the Crimean War and other conflicts. During the Franco-Prussian war however, Charles-Denis Bourbaki suffered a major defeat in which the Armée de l&#x27;Est, under his command, retreated across the Swiss border and was disarmed. The general unsuccessfully attempted suicide. The dramatic story of his defeat was known in the French popular consciousness following his death.

 In the early 20th century, the First World War affected Europeans of all professions and social classes, including mathematicians and male students who fought and died in the front. For example, the French mathematician Gaston Julia, a pioneer in the study of fractals, lost his nose during the war and wore a leather strap over the affected part of his face for the rest of his life. The deaths of ENS students resulted in a lost generation in the French mathematical community; the estimated proportion of ENS mathematics students (and French students generally) who died in the war ranges from one-quarter to one-half, depending on the intervals of time (c. 1900–1918, especially 1910–1916) and populations considered. Furthermore, Bourbaki founder André Weil remarked in his memoir &quot;Apprenticeship of a Mathematician&quot; that France and Germany took different approaches with their intelligentsia during the war: while Germany protected its young students and scientists, France instead committed them to the front, owing to the French culture of egalitarianism.

A succeeding generation of mathematics students attended the ENS during the 1920s, including Weil and others, the future founders of Bourbaki. During his time as a student, Weil recalled a prank in which an upperclassman, , posed as a professor and gave a math lecture, ending with a prompt: &quot;Theorem of Bourbaki: you are to prove the following...&quot;. Weil was also aware of a similar stunt around 1910 in which a student claimed to be from the fictional, impoverished nation of &quot;Poldevia&quot; and solicited the public for donations. Weil had strong interests in languages and Indian culture, having learned Sanskrit and read the Bhagavad Gita. After graduating from the ENS and obtaining his doctorate, Weil took a teaching stint at the Aligarh Muslim University in India. While there, Weil met the mathematician Damodar Kosambi, who was engaged in a power struggle with one of his colleagues. Weil suggested that Kosambi write an article with material attributed to one &quot;Bourbaki&quot;, in order to show off his knowledge to the colleague. Kosambi took the suggestion, attributing the material discussed in the article to &quot;the little-known Russian mathematician D. Bourbaki, who was poisoned during the Revolution.&quot; It was the first article in the mathematical literature with material attributed to the eponymous &quot;Bourbaki&quot;. Weil&#x27;s stay in India was short-lived; he attempted to revamp the mathematics department at Aligarh, without success. The university administration planned to fire Weil and promote his colleague Vijayaraghavan to the vacated position. However, Weil and Vijayaraghavan respected one another. Rather than play any role in the drama, Vijayaraghavan instead resigned, later informing Weil of the plan. Weil returned to Europe to seek another teaching position. He ended up at the University of Strasbourg, joining his friend and colleague Henri Cartan.

==The Bourbaki collective==

===Founding===
During their time together at Strasbourg, Weil and Cartan regularly complained to each other regarding the inadequacy of available course material for calculus instruction. In his memoir &quot;Apprenticeship&quot;, Weil described his solution in the following terms: &quot;One winter day toward the end of 1934, I came upon a great idea that would put an end to these ceaseless interrogations by my comrade. &#x27;We are five or six friends&#x27;, I told him some time later, &#x27;who are in charge of the same mathematics curriculum at various universities. Let us all come together and regulate these matters once and for all, and after this, I shall be delivered of these questions.&#x27; I was unaware of the fact that Bourbaki was born at that instant.&quot; Cartan confirmed the account.

The first, unofficial meeting of the Bourbaki collective took place at noon on Monday, 10 December 1934, at the Café Grill-Room A. Capoulade, Paris, in the Latin Quarter. Six mathematicians were present: Henri Cartan, Claude Chevalley, Jean Delsarte, Jean Dieudonné, René de Possel, and André Weil. Most of the group were based outside Paris and were in town to attend the Julia Seminar, a conference prepared with the help of Gaston Julia at which several future Bourbaki members and associates presented. The group resolved to collectively write a treatise on analysis, for the purpose of standardizing calculus instruction in French universities. The project was especially meant to supersede the text of Édouard Goursat, which the group found to be badly outdated, and to improve its treatment of Stokes&#x27; Theorem. The founders were also motivated by a desire to incorporate ideas from the Göttingen school, particularly from exponents Hilbert, Noether and B.L. van der Waerden. Further, in the aftermath of World War I, there was a certain nationalist impulse to save French mathematics from decline, especially in competition with Germany. As Dieudonné stated in an interview, &quot;Without meaning to boast, I can say that it was Bourbaki that saved French mathematics from extinction.&quot;

Jean Delsarte was particularly favorable to the collective aspect of the proposed project, observing that such a working style could insulate the group&#x27;s work against potential later individual claims of copyright. As various topics were discussed, Delsarte also suggested that the work begin in the most abstract, axiomatic terms possible, treating all of mathematics prerequisite to analysis from scratch. The group agreed to the idea, and this foundational area of the proposed work was referred to as the &quot;Abstract Packet&quot; (Paquet Abstrait). Working titles were adopted: the group styled itself as the Committee for the Treatise on Analysis, and their proposed work was called the &quot;Treatise on Analysis&quot; (&quot;Traité d&#x27;analyse&quot;). In all, the collective held ten preliminary biweekly meetings at A. Capoulade before its first official, founding conference in July 1935. During this early period, Paul Dubreil, Jean Leray and Szolem Mandelbrojt joined and participated. Dubreil and Leray left the meetings before the following summer, and were respectively replaced by new participants Jean Coulomb and Charles Ehresmann.

The group&#x27;s official founding conference was held in Besse-en-Chandesse, from 10 to 17 July 1935. At the time of the official founding, the membership consisted of the six attendees at the first lunch of 10 December 1934, together with Coulomb, Ehresmann and Mandelbrojt. On 16 July, the members took a walk to alleviate the boredom of unproductive proceedings. During the malaise, some decided to skinny-dip in the nearby Lac Pavin, repeatedly yelling &quot;Bourbaki!&quot; At the close of the first official conference, the group renamed itself &quot;Bourbaki&quot;, in reference to the general and prank as recalled by Weil and others. During 1935, the group also resolved to establish the mathematical personhood of their collective pseudonym by getting an article published under its name. A first name had to be decided; a full name was required for publication of any article. To this end, René de Possel&#x27;s wife Eveline &quot;baptized&quot; the pseudonym with the first name of Nicolas, becoming Bourbaki&#x27;s &quot;godmother&quot;. This allowed for the publication of a second article with material attributed to Bourbaki, this time under &quot;his&quot; own name. Henri Cartan&#x27;s father Élie Cartan, also a mathematician and supportive of the group, presented the article to the publishers, who accepted it.

At the time of Bourbaki&#x27;s founding, René de Possel and his wife Eveline were in the process of divorcing. Eveline remarried to André Weil in 1937, and de Possel left the Bourbaki collective some time later. This sequence of events has caused speculation that de Possel left the group because of the remarriage, however this suggestion has also been criticized as possibly historically inaccurate, since de Possel is supposed to have remained active in Bourbaki for years after André&#x27;s marriage to Eveline.

===World War II===

Bourbaki&#x27;s work slowed significantly during the Second World War, though the group survived and later flourished. Some members of Bourbaki were Jewish and therefore forced to flee from certain parts of Europe at certain times. Weil, who was Jewish, spent the summer of 1939 in Finland with his wife Eveline, as guests of Lars Ahlfors. Due to their travel near the border, the couple were suspected as Soviet spies by Finnish authorities near the onset of the Winter War, and André was later arrested. According to an anecdote, Weil was to have been executed but for the passing mention of his case to Rolf Nevanlinna, who asked that Weil&#x27;s sentence be commuted. However, the accuracy of this detail is dubious. Weil reached the United States in 1941, later taking another teaching stint in São Paulo from 1945 to 1947 before settling at the University of Chicago from 1947 to 1958 and finally the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he spent the remainder of his career. Although Weil remained in touch with the Bourbaki collective and visited Europe and the group periodically following the war, his level of involvement with Bourbaki never returned to that at the time of founding.

Second-generation Bourbaki member Laurent Schwartz was also Jewish and found pickup work as a math teacher in rural Vichy France. Moving from village to village, Schwartz planned his movements in order to evade capture by the Nazis. On one occasion Schwartz found himself trapped overnight in a certain village, as his expected transportation home was unavailable. There were two inns in town: a comfortable, well-appointed one, and a very poor one with no heating and bad beds. Schwartz&#x27;s instinct told him to stay at the poor inn; overnight, the Nazis raided the good inn, leaving the poor inn unchecked.

Meanwhile, Jean Delsarte, a Catholic, was mobilized in 1939 as the captain of an audio reconnaissance battery. He was forced to lead the unit&#x27;s retreat from the northeastern part of France toward the south. While passing near the Swiss border, Delsarte overheard a soldier say &quot;We are the army of Bourbaki&quot;; the 19th-century general&#x27;s retreat was known to the French. Delsarte had coincidentally led a retreat similar to that of the collective&#x27;s namesake.

===Postwar until the present===

Following the war, Bourbaki had solidified the plan of its work and settled into a productive routine. Bourbaki regularly published volumes of the &quot;Éléments&quot; during the 1950s and 1960s, and enjoyed its greatest influence during this period. Over time the founding members gradually left the group, slowly being replaced with younger newcomers including Jean-Pierre Serre and Alexander Grothendieck. Serre, Grothendieck and Laurent Schwartz were awarded the Fields Medal during the postwar period, in 1954, 1966 and 1950 respectively. Later members Alain Connes and Jean-Christophe Yoccoz also received the Fields Medal, in 1982 and 1994 respectively.

The later practice of accepting scientific awards contrasted with some of the founders&#x27; views. During the 1930s, Weil and Delsarte petitioned against a French national scientific &quot;medal system&quot; proposed by the Nobel physics laureate Jean Perrin. Weil and Delsarte felt that the institution of such a system would increase unconstructive pettiness and jealousy in the scientific community. Despite this, the Bourbaki group had previously successfully petitioned Perrin for a government grant to support its normal operations. Like the founders, Grothendieck was also averse to awards, albeit for pacifist reasons. Although Grothendieck was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966, he declined to attend the ceremony in Moscow, in protest of the Soviet government. In 1988, Grothendieck rejected the Crafoord Prize outright, citing no personal need to accept prize money, lack of recent relevant output, and general distrust of the scientific community.

Born to Jewish anarchist parentage, Grothendieck survived the Holocaust and advanced rapidly in the French mathematical community, despite poor education during the war. Grothendieck&#x27;s teachers included Bourbaki&#x27;s founders, and so he joined the group. During Grothendieck&#x27;s membership, Bourbaki reached an impasse concerning its foundational approach. Grothendieck advocated for a reformulation of the group&#x27;s work using category theory as its theoretical basis, as opposed to set theory. The proposal was ultimately rejected in part because the group had already committed itself to a rigid track of sequential presentation, with multiple already-published volumes. Following this, Grothendieck left Bourbaki &quot;in anger&quot;. Biographers of the collective have described Bourbaki&#x27;s unwillingness to start over in terms of category theory as a missed opportunity. However, Bourbaki has in 2023 announced that a book on category theory is currently under preparation (see below the last paragraph of this section).

During the founding period, the group chose the Parisian publisher Hermann to issue installments of the &quot;Éléments&quot;. Hermann was led by Enrique Freymann, a friend of the founders willing to publish the group&#x27;s project, despite financial risk. During the 1970s, Bourbaki entered a protracted legal battle with Hermann over matters of copyright and royalty payment. Although the Bourbaki group won the suit and retained collective copyright of the &quot;Éléments&quot;, the dispute slowed the group&#x27;s productivity. Former member Pierre Cartier described the lawsuit as a pyrrhic victory, saying: &quot;As usual in legal battles, both parties lost and the lawyer got rich.&quot; Later editions of the &quot;Éléments&quot; were published by Masson, and modern editions are published by Springer. From the 1980s through the 2000s, Bourbaki published very infrequently, with the result that in 1998 &quot;Le Monde&quot; pronounced the collective &quot;dead&quot;.

However, in 2012 Bourbaki resumed the publication of the &quot;Éléments&quot; with a revised chapter 8 of algebra, the first 4 chapters of a new book on algebraic topology, and two volumes on spectral theory (the first of which is an expanded and revised version of the edition of 1967 while the latter consist of three new chapters). Moreover, the text of the two latest volumes announces that books on category theory and modular forms are currently under preparation (in addition to the latter part of the book on algebraic topology).

==Working method==

Bourbaki holds periodic conferences for the purpose of expanding the &quot;Éléments&quot;; these conferences are the central activity of the group&#x27;s working life. Subcommittees are assigned to write drafts on specific material, and the drafts are later presented, vigorously debated, and re-drafted at the conferences. Unanimous agreement is required before any material is deemed acceptable for publication. A given piece of material may require six or more drafts over a period of several years, and some drafts are never developed into completed work. Bourbaki&#x27;s writing process has therefore been described as &quot;Sisyphean&quot;. Although the method is slow, it yields a final product which satisfies the group&#x27;s standards for mathematical rigour, one of Bourbaki&#x27;s main priorities in the treatise. Bourbaki&#x27;s emphasis on rigour was a reaction to the style of Henri Poincaré, who stressed the importance of free-flowing mathematical intuition at the cost of thorough presentation. During the project&#x27;s early years, Dieudonné served as the group&#x27;s scribe, authoring several final drafts which were ultimately published. For this purpose, Dieudonné adopted an impersonal writing style which was not his own, but which was used to craft material acceptable to the entire group. Dieudonné reserved his personal style for his own work; like all members of Bourbaki, Dieudonné also published material under his own name, including the nine-volume &quot;Éléments d&#x27;analyse&quot;, a work explicitly focused on analysis and of a piece with Bourbaki&#x27;s initial intentions.

Most of the final drafts of Bourbaki&#x27;s &quot;Éléments&quot; carefully avoided using illustrations, favoring a formal presentation based only in text and formulas. An exception to this was the treatment of Lie groups and Lie algebras (especially in chapters 4–6), which did make use of diagrams and illustrations. The inclusion of illustration in this part of the work was due to Armand Borel. Borel was minority-Swiss in a majority-French collective, and self-deprecated as &quot;the Swiss peasant&quot;, explaining that visual learning was important to the Swiss national character. When asked about the dearth of illustration in the work, former member Pierre Cartier replied:

The conferences have historically been held at quiet rural areas. These locations contrast with the lively, sometimes heated debates which have occurred. Laurent Schwartz reported an episode in which Weil slapped Cartan on the head with a draft. The hotel&#x27;s proprietor saw the incident and assumed that the group would split up, but according to Schwartz, &quot;peace was restored within ten minutes.&quot; The historical, confrontational style of debate within Bourbaki has been partly attributed to Weil, who believed that new ideas have a better chance of being born in confrontation than in an orderly discussion. Schwartz related another illustrative incident: Dieudonné was adamant that topological vector spaces must appear in the work before integration, and whenever anyone suggested that the order be reversed, he would loudly threaten his resignation. This became an in-joke among the group; Roger Godement&#x27;s wife Sonia attended a conference, aware of the idea, and asked for proof. As Sonia arrived at a meeting, a member suggested that integration must appear before topological vector spaces, which triggered Dieudonné&#x27;s usual reaction.

Despite the historical culture of heated argument, Bourbaki thrived during the middle of the twentieth century. Bourbaki&#x27;s ability to sustain such a collective, critical approach has been described as &quot;something unusual&quot;, surprising even its own members. In founder Henri Cartan&#x27;s words, &quot;That a final product can be obtained at all is a kind of miracle that none of us can explain.&quot; It has been suggested that the group survived because its members believed strongly in the importance of their collective project, despite personal differences. When the group overcame difficulties or developed an idea that they liked, they would sometimes say &quot;l&#x27;esprit a soufflé&quot; (&quot;the spirit breathes&quot;). Historian Liliane Beaulieu noted that the &quot;spirit&quot;—which might be an avatar, the group mentality in action, or Bourbaki &quot;himself&quot;—was part of an internal culture and mythology which the group used to form its identity and perform work.

===Humor===

Humor has been an important aspect of the group&#x27;s culture, beginning with Weil&#x27;s memories of the student pranks involving &quot;Bourbaki&quot; and &quot;Poldevia&quot;. For example, in 1939 the group released a wedding announcement for the marriage of &quot;Betti Bourbaki&quot; (daughter of Nicolas) to one &quot;H. Pétard&quot; (H. &quot;Firecrackers&quot; or &quot;Hector Pétard&quot;), a &quot;lion hunter&quot;. Hector Pétard was itself a pseudonym, but not one originally coined by the Bourbaki members. The Pétard moniker was originated by Ralph P. Boas, Frank Smithies and other Princeton mathematicians who were aware of the Bourbaki project; inspired by them, the Princeton mathematicians published an article on the &quot;mathematics of lion hunting&quot;. After meeting Boas and Smithies, Weil composed the wedding announcement, which contained several mathematical puns. Bourbaki&#x27;s internal newsletter &quot;La Tribu&quot; has sometimes been issued with humorous subtitles to describe a given conference, such as &quot;The Extraordinary Congress of Old Fogies&quot; (where anyone older than 30 was considered a fogy) or &quot;The Congress of the Motorization of the Trotting Ass&quot; (an expression used to describe the routine unfolding of a mathematical proof, or process).

During the 1940s–1950s, the American Mathematical Society received applications for individual membership from Bourbaki. They were rebuffed by J.R. Kline who understood the entity to be a collective, inviting them to re-apply for institutional membership. In response, Bourbaki floated a rumor that Ralph Boas was not a real person, but a collective pseudonym of the editors of &quot;Mathematical Reviews&quot; with which Boas had been affiliated. The reason for targeting Boas was because he had known the group in its earlier days when they were less strict with secrecy, and he&#x27;d described them as a collective in an article for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. In November 1968, a mock obituary of Nicolas Bourbaki was released during one of the seminars.

The group developed some variants of the word &quot;Bourbaki&quot; for internal use. The noun &quot;Bourbaki&quot; might refer to the group proper or to an individual member, e.g. &quot;André Weil was a Bourbaki.&quot; &quot;Bourbakist&quot; is sometimes used to refer to members but also denotes associates, supporters, and enthusiasts. To &quot;bourbakize&quot; meant to take a poor existing text and to improve it through an editing process.

Bourbaki&#x27;s culture of humor has been described as an important factor in the group&#x27;s social cohesion and capacity to survive, smoothing over tensions of heated debate. As of , a Twitter account registered to &quot;Betty_Bourbaki&quot; provides regular updates on the group&#x27;s activity.

==Works==

Bourbaki&#x27;s work includes a series of textbooks, a series of printed lecture notes, journal articles, and an internal newsletter. The textbook series &quot;Éléments de mathématique&quot; &quot;(Elements of mathematics)&quot; is the group&#x27;s central work. The Séminaire Bourbaki is a lecture series held regularly under the group&#x27;s auspices, and the talks given are also published as lecture notes. Journal articles have been published with authorship attributed to Bourbaki, and the group publishes an internal newsletter &quot;La Tribu&quot; (&quot;The Tribe&quot;) which is distributed to current and former members.

===&quot;Éléments de mathématique&quot;===

The content of the &quot;Éléments&quot; is divided into &quot;books&quot;—major topics of discussion, &quot;volumes&quot;—individual, physical books, and &quot;chapters&quot;, together with certain summaries of results, historical notes, and other details. The volumes of the &quot;Éléments&quot; have had a complex publication history. Material has been revised for new editions, published chronologically out of order of its intended logical sequence, grouped together and partitioned differently in later volumes, and translated into English. For example, the second book on &quot;Algebra&quot; was originally released in eight French volumes: the first in 1942 being chapter 1 alone, and the last in 1980 being chapter 10 alone. This presentation was later condensed into five volumes with chapters 1–3 in the first volume, chapters 4–7 in the second, and chapters 8–10 each remaining the third through fifth volumes of that portion of the work. The English edition of Bourbaki&#x27;s &quot;Algebra&quot; consists of translations of the three volumes consisting of chapters 1–3, 4–7 and 8, with chapters 9 and 10 unavailable in English as of .

When Bourbaki&#x27;s founders began working on the &quot;Éléments&quot;, they originally conceived of it as a &quot;treatise on analysis&quot;, the proposed work having a working title of the same name (&quot;Traité d&#x27;analyse&quot;). The opening part was to comprehensively deal with the foundations of mathematics prior to analysis, and was referred to as the &quot;Abstract Packet&quot;. Over time, the members developed this proposed &quot;opening section&quot; of the work to the point that it would instead run for several volumes and comprise a major part of the work, covering set theory, abstract algebra, and topology. Once the project&#x27;s scope expanded far beyond its original purpose, the working title &quot;Traité d&#x27;analyse&quot; was dropped in favor of &quot;Éléments de mathématique&quot;. The unusual, singular &quot;Mathematic&quot; was meant to connote Bourbaki&#x27;s belief in the unity of mathematics. The first six books of the &quot;Éléments&quot;, representing the first half of the work, are numbered sequentially and ordered logically, with a given statement being established only on the basis of earlier results. This first half of the work bore the subtitle &quot;Les structures fondamentales de l’analyse&quot; (&quot;Fundamental Structures of Analysis&quot;), covering established mathematics (algebra, analysis) in the group&#x27;s style. The second half of the work consists of unnumbered books treating modern areas of research (Lie groups, commutative algebra), each presupposing the first half as a shared foundation but without dependence on each other. This second half of the work, consisting of newer research topics, does not have a corresponding subtitle.

The volumes of the &quot;Éléments&quot; published by Hermann were indexed by chronology of publication and referred to as &quot;fascicules&quot;: installments in a large work. Some volumes did not consist of the normal definitions, proofs, and exercises in a math textbook, but contained only summaries of results for a given topic, stated without proof. These volumes were referred to as &quot;Fascicules de résultats&quot;, with the result that &quot;fascicule&quot; may refer to a volume of Hermann&#x27;s edition, or to one of the &quot;summary&quot; sections of the work (e.g. &quot;Fascicules de résultats&quot; is translated as &quot;Summary of Results&quot; rather than &quot;Installment of Results&quot;, referring to the content rather than a specific volume). The first volume of Bourbaki&#x27;s &quot;Éléments&quot; to be published was the Summary of Results in the &quot;Theory of Sets&quot;, in 1939. Similarly one of the work&#x27;s later books, &quot;Differential and Analytic Manifolds&quot;, consisted only of two volumes of summaries of results, with no chapters of content having been published.

Later installments of the &quot;Éléments&quot; appeared infrequently during the 1980s and 1990s. A volume of &quot;Commutative Algebra&quot; (chapters 8–9) was published in 1983, and no other volumes were issued until the appearance of the same book&#x27;s tenth chapter in 1998. During the 2010s, Bourbaki increased its productivity. A re-written and expanded version of the eighth chapter of &quot;Algebra&quot; appeared in 2012, the first four chapters of a new book treating Algebraic Topology was published in 2016, and the first two chapters of a revised and expanded edition of &quot;Spectral Theory&quot; was issued in 2019 while the remaining three (completely new) chapters appeared in 2023.

===Séminaire Bourbaki===
The Séminaire Bourbaki has been held regularly since 1948, and lectures are presented by non-members and members of the collective. As of the Séminaire Bourbaki has run to over a thousand recorded lectures in its written incarnation, denoted chronologically by simple numbers. At the time of a June 1999 lecture given by Jean-Pierre Serre on the topic of Lie groups, the total lectures given in the series numbered 864, corresponding to roughly 10,000 pages of printed material.

===Articles===

Several journal articles have appeared in the mathematical literature with material or authorship attributed to Bourbaki; unlike the &quot;Éléments&quot;, they were typically written by individual members and not crafted through the usual process of group consensus. Despite this, Jean Dieudonné&#x27;s essay &quot;The Architecture of Mathematics&quot; has become known as Bourbaki&#x27;s manifesto. Dieudonné addressed the issue of overspecialization in mathematics, to which he opposed the inherent unity of &quot;mathematic&quot; (as opposed to mathematics) and proposed mathematical structures as useful tools which can be applied to several subjects, showing their common features. To illustrate the idea, Dieudonné described three different systems in arithmetic and geometry and showed that all could be described as examples of a group, a specific kind of (algebraic) structure. Dieudonné described the axiomatic method as &quot;the &#x27;Taylor system&#x27; for mathematics&quot; in the sense that it could be used to solve problems efficiently. Such a procedure would entail identifying relevant structures and applying established knowledge about the given structure to the specific problem at hand.

===&quot;La Tribu&quot;===

&quot;La Tribu&quot; is Bourbaki&#x27;s internal newsletter, distributed to current and former members. The newsletter usually documents recent conferences and activity in a humorous, informal way, sometimes including poetry. Member Pierre Samuel wrote the newsletter&#x27;s narrative sections for several years. Early editions of &quot;La Tribu&quot; and related documents have been made publicly available by Bourbaki.

Historian Liliane Beaulieu examined &quot;La Tribu&quot; and Bourbaki&#x27;s other writings, describing the group&#x27;s humor and private language as an &quot;art of memory&quot; which is specific to the group and its chosen methods of operation. Because of the group&#x27;s secrecy and informal organization, individual memories are sometimes recorded in a fragmentary way, and may not have significance to other members. On the other hand, the predominantly French, ENS background of the members, together with stories of the group&#x27;s early period and successes, create a shared culture and mythology which is drawn upon for group identity. &quot;La Tribu&quot; usually lists the members present at a conference, together with any visitors, family members or other friends in attendance. Humorous descriptions of location or local &quot;props&quot; (cars, bicycles, binoculars, etc.) can also serve as mnemonic devices.

==Membership==

As of 2000, Bourbaki has had &quot;about forty&quot; members. Historically the group has numbered about ten to twelve members at any given point, although it was briefly (and officially) limited to nine members at the time of founding. Bourbaki&#x27;s membership has been described in terms of generations:

After the first three generations there were roughly twenty later members, not including current participants. Bourbaki has a custom of keeping its current membership secret, a practice meant to ensure that its output is presented as a collective, unified effort under the Bourbaki pseudonym, not attributable to any one author (e.g. for purposes of copyright or royalty payment). This secrecy is also intended to deter unwanted attention which could disrupt normal operations. However, former members freely discuss Bourbaki&#x27;s internal practices upon departure.

Prospective members are invited to conferences and styled as guinea pigs, a process meant to vet the newcomer&#x27;s mathematical ability. In the event of agreement between the group and the prospect, the prospect eventually becomes a full member. The group is supposed to have an age limit: active members are expected to retire at (or about) 50 years of age. At a 1956 conference, Cartan read a letter from Weil which proposed a &quot;gradual disappearance&quot; of the founding members, forcing younger members to assume full responsibility for Bourbaki&#x27;s operations. This rule is supposed to have resulted in a complete change of personnel by 1958. However, historian Liliane Beaulieu has been critical of the claim. She reported never having found written affirmation of the rule, and has indicated that there have been exceptions. The age limit is thought to express the founders&#x27; intent that the project should continue indefinitely, operated by people at their best mathematical ability—in the mathematical community, there is a widespread belief that mathematicians produce their best work while young. Among full members there is no official hierarchy; all operate as equals, having the ability to interrupt conference proceedings at any point, or to challenge any material presented. However, André Weil has been described as &quot;first among equals&quot; during the founding period, and was given some deference. On the other hand, the group has also poked fun at the idea that older members should be afforded greater respect.

Bourbaki conferences have also been attended by members&#x27; family, friends, visiting mathematicians, and other non-members of the group. Bourbaki is not known ever to have had any female members.





==Influence and criticism==

Bourbaki was influential in 20th century mathematics and had some interdisciplinary impact on the humanities and the arts, although the extent of the latter influence is a matter of dispute. The group has been praised and criticized for its method of presentation, its working style, and its choice of mathematical topics.

===Influence===

Bourbaki introduced several mathematical notations which have remained in use. Weil took the letter of the Norwegian alphabet and used it to denote the empty set, . This notation first appeared in the Summary of Results on the &quot;Theory of Sets&quot;, and remains in use. The words injective, surjective and bijective were introduced to refer to functions which satisfy certain properties. Bourbaki used simple language for certain geometric objects, naming them &quot;pavés&quot; (paving stones) and &quot;boules&quot; (balls) as opposed to &quot;parallelotopes&quot; or &quot;hyperspheroids&quot;. Similarly in its treatment of topological vector spaces, Bourbaki defined a barrel as a set which is convex, balanced, absorbing, and closed. The group were proud of this definition, believing that the shape of a wine barrel typified the mathematical object&#x27;s properties. Bourbaki also employed a &quot;dangerous bend&quot; symbol in the margins of its text to indicate an especially difficult piece of material. Bourbaki enjoyed its greatest influence during the 1950s and 1960s, when installments of the &quot;Éléments&quot; were published frequently.

Bourbaki had some interdisciplinary influence on other fields, including anthropology and psychology. This influence was in the context of structuralism, a school of thought in the humanities which stresses the relationships between objects over the objects themselves, pursued in various fields by other French intellectuals. In 1943, André Weil met the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss in New York, where the two undertook a brief collaboration. At Lévi-Strauss&#x27; request, Weil wrote a brief appendix describing marriage rules for four classes of people within Aboriginal Australian society, using a mathematical model based on group theory. The result was published as an appendix in Lévi-Strauss&#x27; &quot;Elementary Structures of Kinship&quot;, a work examining family structures and the incest taboo in human cultures. In 1952, Jean Dieudonné and Jean Piaget participated in an interdisciplinary conference on mathematical and mental structures. Dieudonné described mathematical &quot;mother structures&quot; in terms of Bourbaki&#x27;s project: composition, neighborhood, and order. Piaget then gave a talk on children&#x27;s mental processes, and considered that the psychological concepts he had just described were very similar to the mathematical ones just described by Dieudonné. According to Piaget, the two were &quot;impressed with each other&quot;. The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan liked Bourbaki&#x27;s collaborative working style and proposed a similar collective group in psychology, an idea which did not materialize.

Bourbaki was also cited by post-structuralist philosophers. In their joint work &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot;, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari presented a criticism of capitalism. The authors cited Bourbaki&#x27;s use of the axiomatic method (with the purpose of establishing truth) as a distinct counter-example to management processes which instead seek economic efficiency. The authors said of Bourbaki&#x27;s axiomatics that &quot;they do not form a Taylor system&quot;, inverting the phrase used by Dieudonné in &quot;The Architecture of Mathematics&quot;. In &quot;The Postmodern Condition&quot;, Jean-François Lyotard criticized the &quot;legitimation of knowledge&quot;, the process by which statements become accepted as valid. As an example, Lyotard cited Bourbaki as a group which produces knowledge within a given system of rules. Lyotard contrasted Bourbaki&#x27;s hierarchical, &quot;structuralist&quot; mathematics with the catastrophe theory of René Thom and the fractals of Benoit Mandelbrot, expressing preference for the latter &quot;postmodern science&quot; which problematized mathematics with &quot;fracta, catastrophes, and pragmatic paradoxes&quot;.

Although biographer Amir Aczel stressed Bourbaki&#x27;s influence on other disciplines during the mid-20th century, Maurice Mashaal moderated the claims of Bourbaki&#x27;s influence in the following terms:

The impact of &quot;structuralism&quot; on mathematics itself was also criticized. The mathematical historian Leo Corry argued that Bourbaki&#x27;s use of mathematical structures was unimportant within the &quot;Éléments&quot;, having been established in &quot;Theory of Sets&quot; and cited infrequently afterwards. Corry described the &quot;structural&quot; view of mathematics promoted by Bourbaki as an &quot;image of knowledge&quot;—a conception about a scientific discipline—as opposed to an item in the discipline&#x27;s &quot;body of knowledge&quot;, which refers to the actual scientific results in the discipline itself.

Bourbaki also had some influence in the arts. The literary collective Oulipo was founded on 24 November 1960 under circumstances similar to Bourbaki&#x27;s founding, with the members initially meeting in a restaurant. Although several members of Oulipo were mathematicians, the group&#x27;s purpose was to create experimental literature by playing with language. Oulipo frequently employed mathematically-based constrained writing techniques, such as the S+7 method. Oulipo member Raymond Queneau attended a Bourbaki conference in 1962.

In 2016, an anonymous group of economists collaboratively wrote a note alleging academic misconduct by the authors and editor of a paper published in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot;. The note was published under the name Nicolas Bearbaki in homage to Nicolas Bourbaki.

In 2018, the American musical duo Twenty One Pilots released a concept album named &quot;Trench&quot;. The album&#x27;s conceptual framework was the mythical city of &quot;Dema&quot; ruled by nine &quot;bishops&quot;; one of the bishops was named &quot;Nico&quot;, short for Nicolas Bourbaki. Another of the bishops was named Andre, which may refer to André Weil. Following the album&#x27;s release, there was a spike in internet searches for &quot;Nicolas Bourbaki&quot;.

===Praise===

Bourbaki&#x27;s work has been praised by some mathematicians. In a book review, Emil Artin described the &quot;Éléments&quot; in broad, positive terms:

Among the volumes of the &quot;Éléments&quot;, Bourbaki&#x27;s work on Lie Groups and Lie Algebras has been identified as &quot;excellent&quot;, having become a standard reference on the topic. In particular, former member Armand Borel described the volume with chapters 4–6 as &quot;one of the most successful books by Bourbaki&quot;. The success of this part of the work has been attributed to the fact that the books were composed while leading experts on the topic were Bourbaki members.

Jean-Pierre Bourguignon expressed appreciation for the Séminaire Bourbaki, saying that he&#x27;d learned a large amount of material at its lectures, and referred to its printed lecture notes regularly. He also praised the &quot;Éléments&quot; for containing &quot;some superb and very clever proofs&quot;.

===Criticism===

Bourbaki has also been criticized by several mathematicians—including its own former members—for a variety of reasons. Criticisms have included the choice of presentation of certain topics within the &quot;Éléments&quot; at the expense of others, dislike of the method of presentation for given topics, dislike of the group&#x27;s working style, and a perceived elitist mentality around Bourbaki&#x27;s project and its books, especially during the collective&#x27;s most productive years in the 1950s and 1960s.

Bourbaki&#x27;s deliberations on the &quot;Éléments&quot; resulted in the inclusion of some topics, while others were not treated. When asked in a 1997 interview about topics left out of the &quot;Éléments&quot;, former member Pierre Cartier replied:

Although Bourbaki had resolved to treat mathematics from its foundations, the group&#x27;s eventual solution in terms of set theory was attended by several problems. Bourbaki&#x27;s members were mathematicians as opposed to logicians, and therefore the collective had a limited interest in mathematical logic. As Bourbaki&#x27;s members themselves said of the book on set theory, it was written &quot;with pain and without pleasure, but we had to do it.&quot; Dieudonné personally remarked elsewhere that ninety-five percent of mathematicians &quot;don&#x27;t care a fig&quot; for mathematical logic. In response, logician Adrian Mathias harshly criticized Bourbaki&#x27;s foundational framework, noting that it did not take Gödel&#x27;s results into account.

Bourbaki also influenced the New Math, a failed reform in Western mathematics education at the elementary and secondary levels, which stressed abstraction over concrete examples. During the mid-20th century, reform in basic math education was spurred by a perceived need to create a mathematically literate workforce for the modern economy, and also to compete with the Soviet Union. In France, this led to the Lichnerowicz Commission of 1967, headed by André Lichnerowicz and including some (then-current and former) Bourbaki members. Although Bourbaki members had previously (and individually) reformed math instruction at the university level, they had less direct involvement with implementation of the New Math at the primary and secondary levels. New Math reforms resulted in instructional material which was incomprehensible to both students and teachers, failing to meet the cognitive needs of younger students. The attempted reform was harshly criticized by Dieudonné and also by brief founding Bourbaki participant Jean Leray. Apart from French mathematicians, the French reforms also met with harsh criticism from Soviet-born mathematician Vladimir Arnold, who argued that in his time as a student and teacher in Moscow, the teaching of mathematics was firmly rooted in analysis and geometry, and interweaved with problems from classical mechanics; hence, the French reforms cannot be a legitimate attempt to emulate Soviet scientific education. In 1997, while speaking to a conference on mathematical teaching in Paris, he commented on Bourbaki by stating: &quot;genuine mathematicians do not gang up, but the weak need gangs in order to survive.&quot; and suggested that Bourbaki&#x27;s bonding over &quot;super-abstractness&quot; was similar to groups of mathematicians in the 19th century who had bonded over anti-Semitism.

Dieudonné later regretted that Bourbaki&#x27;s success had contributed to a snobbery for pure mathematics in France, at the expense of applied mathematics. In an interview, he said: &quot;It is possible to say that there was no serious applied mathematics in France for forty years after Poincaré. There was even a snobbery for pure math. When one noticed a talented student, one would tell him &#x27;You should do pure math.&#x27; On the other hand, one would advise a mediocre student to do applied math while thinking, &quot;It&#x27;s all that he can do! ... The truth is actually the reverse. You can&#x27;t do good work in applied math until you can do good work in pure math.&quot; Claude Chevalley confirmed an elitist culture within Bourbaki, describing it as &quot;an absolute certainty of our superiority over other mathematicians.&quot; Alexander Grothendieck also confirmed an elitist mentality within Bourbaki. Some mathematicians, especially geometers and applied mathematicians, found Bourbaki&#x27;s influence to be stifling. Benoit Mandelbrot&#x27;s decision to emigrate to the United States in 1958 was motivated in part by a desire to escape Bourbaki&#x27;s influence in France.

Several related criticisms of the &quot;Éléments&quot; have concerned its target audience and the intent of its presentation. Volumes of the &quot;Éléments&quot; begin with a note to the reader which says that the series &quot;takes up mathematics at the beginning, and gives complete proofs&quot; and that &quot;the method of exposition we have chosen is axiomatic and abstract, and normally proceeds from the general to the particular.&quot; Despite the opening language, Bourbaki&#x27;s intended audience are not absolute beginners in mathematics, but rather undergraduates, graduate students, and professors who are familiar with mathematical concepts. Claude Chevalley said that the &quot;Éléments&quot; are &quot;useless for a beginner&quot;, and Pierre Cartier clarified that &quot;The misunderstanding was that it should be a textbook for everybody. That was the big disaster.&quot;

The work is divided into two halves. While the first half—the &quot;Structures fondamentales de l’analyse&quot;—treats established subjects, the second half deals with modern research areas like commutative algebra and spectral theory. This divide in the work is related to a historical change in the intent of the treatise. The &quot;Éléments&#x27;&quot; content consists of theorems, proofs, exercises and related commentary, common material in math textbooks. Despite this presentation, the first half was not written as original research but rather as a reorganized presentation of established knowledge. In this sense, the &quot;Éléments&quot;&#x27; first half was more akin to an encyclopedia than a textbook series. As Cartier remarked, &quot;The misunderstanding was that many people thought it should be &quot;taught&quot; the way it was written in the books. You can think of the first books of Bourbaki as an encyclopedia of mathematics... If you consider it as a textbook, it&#x27;s a disaster.&quot;

The strict, ordered presentation of material in the &quot;Éléments&quot;&#x27; first half was meant to form the basis for any further additions. However, developments in modern mathematical research have proven difficult to adapt in terms of Bourbaki&#x27;s organizational scheme. This difficulty has been attributed to the fluid, dynamic nature of ongoing research which, being new, is not settled or fully understood. Bourbaki&#x27;s style has been described as a particular scientific paradigm which has been superseded in a paradigm shift. For example, Ian Stewart cited Vaughan Jones&#x27; novel work in knot theory as an example of topology which was done without dependence on Bourbaki&#x27;s system. Bourbaki&#x27;s influence has declined over time; this decline has been partly attributed to the absence of certain modern topics—such as category theory—from the treatise.

Although multiple criticisms have pointed to shortcomings in the collective&#x27;s project, one has also pointed to its strength: Bourbaki was a &quot;victim of its own success&quot; in the sense that it accomplished what it set out to do, achieving its original goal of presenting a thorough treatise on modern mathematics. These factors prompted biographer Maurice Mashaal to conclude his treatment of Bourbaki in the following terms:

<doc id="167395" wikidata="Q1141711" url="?curid=167395" title="Wilhelm scream">
<text>The Wilhelm scream is an iconic stock sound effect that has been used in countless films, TV series, and other media, first originating from the 1951 film &quot;Distant Drums&quot;. The scream is usually used in many scenarios when someone is shot, falls from a great height, or is thrown from an explosion. The scream is named after Private Wilhelm, a character in &quot;The Charge at Feather River&quot;, a 1953 Western in which the character gets shot in the thigh with an arrow. This was its first use following its inclusion in the Warner Bros. stock sound library, although &quot;The Charge at Feather River&quot; was the third film to use the effect. The scream is thought to be voiced by actor Sheb Wooley. It was featured in all of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.

==History==

The Wilhelm scream originates from a series of sound effects recorded for the 1951 movie &quot;Distant Drums&quot;. In a scene from the film, soldiers fleeing a Seminole group are wading through a swamp in the Everglades, and one of them is bitten and dragged underwater by an alligator. The screams for that scene, and other scenes in the movie, were recorded later in a single take. The recording was titled &quot;Man getting bit by an alligator, and he screams.&quot; The fifth take of the scream was used for the soldier in the alligator scene. That take, which later became known as the &quot;Wilhelm scream&quot;, is thought to have been voiced by actor Sheb Wooley (who also played the uncredited role of Pvt. Jessup in &quot;Distant Drums&quot;).

Because the costs of creating sound effects were high at that time, the scream was reused in a number of other Warner Bros. films in that era. In addition to &quot;The Charge at Feather River&quot; (1953), other films using the scream include &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1954), &quot;Them!&quot; (1954), &quot;Land of the Pharaohs&quot; (1955), &quot;The Sea Chase&quot; (1955), &quot;Sergeant Rutledge&quot; (1960), &quot;PT 109&quot; (1963), &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Green Berets&quot; (1968). 

The Wilhelm scream became iconic in popular culture when motion picture sound designer Ben Burtt, who had come across the original recording on a studio archive sound reel, incorporated it into the scene in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) in which Luke Skywalker shoots a Stormtrooper off a ledge. The effect is heard as the Stormtrooper is falling. Burtt named the scream after Pvt. Wilhelm, a minor character from &quot;The Charge at Feather River&quot; who appears to emit the scream, and adopted it as his personal sound signature. Burtt also found use for the effect in &quot;More American Graffiti&quot; (1979); and over the next decades he incorporated it into other films that he worked on, such as &quot;Willow&quot; (1988), &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; and several George Lucas and Steven Spielberg films. Notably, the rest of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films made under Lucas and all the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movies included the effect.

Following its use in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, other sound designers have picked up and used the sound effect in works. Inclusion of the sound in films became a tradition among a certain community of sound designers. 

As of mid-2023, the scream had not been made available in any commercial sound effects library. The entire collection of original sources of the sound effects made by Sunset Editorial, which includes the Wilhelm scream, was donated to the USC School of Cinematic Arts in 1990. In 2023, Craig Smith released a copy of the complete recording from the original session on Freesound on behalf of the USC under the CC0 license, along with the rest of Sunset Editorial sound effects. On May 20, 2023, the entire collection of Sunset Editorial SFX was mirrored in the Internet Archive (also under the CC0 license) for the purpose of enabling a wider distribution, especially thanks to its BitTorrent support.

Also, the scream has been used in many YouTube videos as a joke among the internet. It has been used in many scenes where someone falls to their death, being struck by a weapon, being knocked out, being thrown by other person, or being hit.

===Voice of the scream===
Research by Burtt suggests that Wooley, best known for his 1958 novelty song &quot;The Purple People Eater&quot; and his character of American Indian scout Pete Nolan on the television series &quot;Rawhide&quot;, is likely to have been the voice actor who originally performed the scream. This has been supported by an interview in 2005 with Linda Dotson, Wooley&#x27;s widow. Burtt discovered records at Warner Bros. from the editor of &quot;Distant Drums&quot;, including a short list of names of actors scheduled to record lines of dialogue for miscellaneous roles in the movie. Wooley was one of a few actors assembled for the recording of additional &quot;pick-up&quot; vocal elements for the film. Dotson confirmed Wooley&#x27;s scream had been in many Westerns, adding that he &quot;always used to joke about how he was so great about screaming and dying in films.&quot;

==Uses==
Since the late 20th century, the Wilhelm scream had been used in numerous films. The National Science and Media Museum says the yelp has been featured in more than 400 films.

<text>&lt;noinclude&gt;

Motown is an American record label owned by the Universal Music Group. Founded by Berry Gordy Jr. as Tamla Records on January 12, 1959, it was incorporated as Motown Record Corporation on April 14, 1960. Its name, a portmanteau of &quot;motor&quot; and &quot;town&quot;, has become a nickname for Detroit, where the label was originally headquartered.

Motown played a vital role in the racial integration of popular music as an African American-owned label that achieved crossover success with white audiences. In the 1960s, Motown and its main subsidiary labels (including Gordy, Soul) were the most prominent exponents of what became known as the Motown sound, a style of soul music with a mainstream pop-influenced sound and appeal. Motown was the most successful soul music label, with a net worth of $61 million. Between 1960 and 1969, Motown had 79 songs reach the top-ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In March 1965, Berry Gordy and Dave Godin agreed to license the Tamla Motown label name for future UK releases through EMI Records Limited. Shortly after, as Berry Gordy owned the brand name, Tamla Motown also became the primary name used outside the US for non-EMI licensees.

Following the events of the Detroit Riots of 1967, and the loss of key songwriting/production team Holland–Dozier–Holland that year over royalty disputes, Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles, California and it expanded into film and television production. It was an independent company until MCA Records bought it in 1988. PolyGram purchased the label from MCA in 1993, followed by MCA successor Universal Music Group, which acquired PolyGram in 1999.

Motown spent much of the 2000s headquartered in New York City as a part of the UMG subsidiaries Universal Motown and Universal Motown Republic Group. From 2011 to 2014, it was a part of The Island Def Jam Music Group division of Universal Music. In 2014, however, UMG announced the dissolution of Island Def Jam, and Motown relocated back to Los Angeles to operate under the Capitol Music Group, now operating out of the Capitol Tower. In 2018, Motown was inducted into Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in a ceremony held at the Charles H. Wright Museum.

In 2021, Motown separated from the Capitol Music Group to become a standalone label once again. On November 29, 2022, Ethiopia Habtemariam announced that she would be stepping down as chairwoman/CEO of Motown. As of 2023, acts signed to Motown include City Girls, Migos, Lil Baby, Lil Yachty, Smino, Vince Staples, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, and several other artists in the hip hop and R&amp;B genres.

==History==
===Beginnings of Motown===
Berry Gordy&#x27;s interest in the record business began when he opened a record store called the 3D Record Mart, a shop where he hoped to &quot;educate customers about the beauty of jazz&quot;, in Detroit, Michigan. Although the shop did not last very long, Gordy&#x27;s interest in the music business did not fade. He frequented Detroit&#x27;s downtown nightclubs, and in the Flame Show Bar he met bar manager Al Green (not the soul singer of the same name), who owned a music publishing company called Pearl Music and represented Detroit-based musician Jackie Wilson. Gordy soon became part of a group of songwriters—with his sister Gwen Gordy and Billy Davis—who wrote songs for Wilson. In November 1957, &quot;Reet Petite&quot; was released and became their first major hit. During the next eighteen months, Gordy helped to write six more Wilson A-sides, including &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot;, a peak-popular hit of 1958. Between 1957 and 1958, Gordy wrote or produced over a hundred sides for various artists, with his siblings Anna, Gwen and Robert, and other collaborators in varying combinations.

In 1957, Gordy met Smokey Robinson, a local seventeen-year-old singer fronting a vocal harmony group called the Matadors. Gordy was interested in the doo-wop style that Robinson sang. In 1958, Gordy recorded the group&#x27;s song &quot;Got a Job&quot; (an answer song to &quot;Get a Job&quot; by the Silhouettes), and released it as a single by leasing the record to a larger company outside Detroit called End Records, based in New York. The practice was common at the time for a small-time producer. &quot;Got a Job&quot; was the first single by Robinson&#x27;s group, now called the Miracles. Gordy recorded a number of other records by forging a similar arrangement, most significantly with United Artists.

In 1958, Gordy wrote and produced &quot;Come to Me&quot; for Marv Johnson. Seeing that the song had great crossover potential, Gordy leased it to United Artists for national distribution but also released it locally on his own startup imprint. Needing $800 to cover his end of the deal, Gordy asked his family to borrow money from a cooperative family savings account. After some debate, his family agreed, and in January 1959 &quot;Come to Me&quot; was released regionally on Gordy&#x27;s new Tamla label. Gordy originally wanted to name the label Tammy Records, after the hit song popularized by Debbie Reynolds from the 1957 film &quot;Tammy and the Bachelor&quot;, in which Reynolds also starred. When he found the name was already in use, Berry decided on Tamla instead. In April 1959, Gordy and his sister Gwen founded Anna Records which released about two dozen singles between 1959 and 1960. The most popular was Barrett Strong&#x27;s &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot;, written by Gordy and a secretary named Janie Bradford, and produced by Gordy. Many of the songs distributed locally by Anna and Tamla Records were nationally distributed by Chess Records (sometimes with Anna and Tamla imprints). Gordy&#x27;s relationship with Chess fostered closer dealings with Harvey Fuqua, nephew of Charlie Fuqua of the Ink Spots. Harvey Fuqua later married Gwen Gordy in 1961.

Gordy looked toward creative self-sufficiency and established the publishing firm Jobete in June 1959 (incorporated in Michigan). He applied for copyrights on more than seventy songs before the end of 1959, including material used for the Miracles and Frances Burnett records, which were leased to Chess and Coral Records. The &quot;Michigan Chronicle&quot; of Detroit called Gordy an &quot;independent producer of records&quot;, as his contributions to the city were beginning to attract notice. By that time, he was the president of Jobete, Tamla, and the music writing company Rayber.

Gordy worked in various Detroit-based studios during this period to produce recordings and demos, but most prominently with United Sound Systems which was considered the best studio in town. However, producing at United Sound Systems was financially taxing and not appropriate for every job, so Gordy decided it would be more cost effective to maintain his own facility. In mid-1959, he purchased a photography studio at 2648 West Grand Boulevard and converted the main floor into a recording studio and office space. Now, rather than shopping his songs to other artists or leasing his recordings to outside companies, Gordy began using the Tamla and Motown imprints to release songs that he wrote and produced. He incorporated Motown Records in April 1960.

Smokey Robinson became the vice president of the company (and later named his daughter &quot;Tamla&quot; and his son &quot;Berry&quot;). Several of Gordy&#x27;s family members, including his father Berry Sr., brothers Robert and George, and sister Esther, were given key roles in the company. By the middle of the decade, Gwen and Anna Gordy had joined the label in administrative positions as well. Gordy&#x27;s partner at the time (and wife from 1960 to 1964), Raynoma Liles, also played a key role in the early days of Motown, leading the company&#x27;s first session group, The Rayber Voices, and overseeing Jobete.

===West Grand Boulevard===
The studio that Gordy purchased in 1959 would become Motown&#x27;s Hitsville U.S.A. studio. The photography studio located in the back of the property was modified into a small recording studio, and the Gordys moved into the second-floor living quarters. Within seven years, Motown would occupy seven additional neighboring houses:

*Hitsville U.S.A., 1959 – (ground floor) administrative office, tape library, control room, Studio A; (upper floor) Gordy living quarters (1959–62), artists and repertoire (1962–72)
*Jobete Publishing office, 1961 – sales, billing, collections, shipping, and public relations
*Berry Gordy Jr. Enterprise, 1962 – offices for Berry Gordy Jr. and Esther Gordy Edwards
*Finance department, 1965 – royalties and payroll
*Artist personal development, 1966 – Harvey Fuqua (head of artist development and producer of stage performances), Maxine Powell (instructor in grooming, poise, and social graces for Motown artists), Maurice King (vocal coach, musical director and arranger), Cholly Atkins (house choreography), and rehearsal studios
*Two houses for administrative offices, 1966 – sales and marketing, traveling and traffic, and mixing and mastering
*ITMI (International Talent Management Inc.) office, 1966 – management

Motown had hired over 450 employees and had a gross income of $20 million by the end of 1966.

===Detroit: 1959–1972===

Early Tamla/Motown artists included Mable John, Eddie Holland and Mary Wells. &quot;Shop Around&quot;, the Miracles&#x27; first number 1 R&amp;B hit, peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1960. It was Tamla&#x27;s first million-selling record. On April 14, 1960, Motown and Tamla Records merged into a new company called Motown Record Corporation. A year later, the Marvelettes scored Tamla&#x27;s first US number-one hit, &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot;. By the mid-1960s, the company, with the help of songwriters and producers such as Robinson, A&amp;R chief William &quot;Mickey&quot; Stevenson, Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Norman Whitfield, had become a major force in the music industry.

From 1961 to 1971, Motown had 110 top 10 hits. Top artists on the Motown label during that period included the Supremes (initially including Diana Ross), the Four Tops, and the Jackson 5, while Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, the Marvelettes, and the Miracles had hits on the Tamla label. The company operated several labels in addition to the Tamla and Motown imprints. A third label, which Gordy named after himself (though it was originally called &quot;Miracle&quot;) featured the Temptations, the Contours, Edwin Starr, and Martha and the Vandellas. A fourth, V.I.P., released recordings by the Velvelettes, the Spinners, the Monitors, and Chris Clark.

A fifth label, Soul, featured Jr. Walker &amp; the All Stars, Jimmy Ruffin, Shorty Long, the Originals, and Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips (who had found success before joining Motown, as &quot;The Pips&quot; on Vee-Jay). Many more Motown-owned labels released recordings in other genres, including Workshop Jazz (jazz) Earl Washington Reflections and Earl Washington&#x27;s All Stars, Mel-o-dy (country, although it was originally an R&amp;B label), and Rare Earth, whose acts, including the eponymous band, explored blues-oriented and progressive rock styles. Under the slogan &quot;The Sound of Young America&quot;, Motown&#x27;s acts were enjoying widespread popularity among black and white audiences alike.

Smokey Robinson said of Motown&#x27;s cultural impact:

Into the 1960s, I was still not of a frame of mind that we were not only making music, we were making history. But I did recognize the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South in the early days of Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.

In 1967, Berry Gordy purchased what is now known as &quot;Motown Mansion&quot; in Detroit&#x27;s Boston-Edison Historic District as his home, leaving his previous home to his sister Anna and her then-husband Marvin Gaye (where photos for the cover of his album &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; were taken). In 1968, Gordy purchased the Donovan building on the corner of Woodward Avenue and Interstate 75, and moved Motown&#x27;s Detroit offices there (the Donovan building was demolished in January 2006 to provide parking spaces for Super Bowl XL). In the same year, Gordy purchased Golden World Records, and its recording studio became &quot;Studio B&quot; to Hitsville&#x27;s &quot;Studio A&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, Motown&#x27;s records were released on various labels: at first London (only the Miracles&#x27; &quot;Shop Around&quot;/&quot;Who&#x27;s Lovin&#x27; You&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Baby&quot;), then Fontana (&quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot; by the Marvelettes was one of four) and then Oriole American (&quot;Fingertips&quot; by Little Stevie Wonder was one of many). In 1963, Motown signed with EMI&#x27;s Stateside label (&quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot; by the Supremes and &quot;My Guy&quot; by Mary Wells were Motown&#x27;s first British top-20 hits). Eventually, EMI created the Tamla Motown label (&quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; by the Supremes was the first Tamla Motown release in March 1965).

The label&#x27;s distinctive &#x27;M&#x27; logo was designed by Bernie Yeszin, who after being hired by Gordy as Motown&#x27;s art director in 1962, developed its visual style and created many of its &quot;sophisticated&quot; album covers. He left the company in 1968.

===Los Angeles: 1972–1998===
After the songwriting trio Holland–Dozier–Holland left the label in 1967 over royalty-payment disputes, Norman Whitfield became the company&#x27;s top producer, turning out hits for the Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips and Rare Earth. In the meantime Berry Gordy established Motown Productions, a television subsidiary which produced TV specials for the Motown artists, including &quot;TCB&quot;, with Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes and the Temptations, &quot;Diana!&quot; with Diana Ross, and &quot;Goin&#x27; Back to Indiana&quot; with the Jackson 5. The company loosened its production rules, allowing some of its longtime artists the opportunity to write and produce more of their own material. This resulted in the recordings of successful and critically acclaimed albums such as Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; (1971) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Get it On&quot; (1973), and Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Music of My Mind&quot; (1972), &quot;Talking Book&quot; (1972), and &quot;Innervisions&quot; (1973).

Motown had established branch offices in both New York City and Los Angeles during the mid-1960s, and by 1969 had begun gradually moving more of its operations to Los Angeles. The company moved all of its operations to Los Angeles in June 1972, with a number of artists, among them Martha Reeves, the Four Tops, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, and many of the Funk Brothers studio band, either staying behind in Detroit or leaving the company for other reasons. By re-locating, Motown aimed chiefly to branch out into the motion-picture industry, and Motown Productions got its start in film by turning out two hit-vehicles for Diana Ross: the Billie Holiday biographical film &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; (1972), and &quot;Mahogany&quot; (1975). Other Motown films would include &quot;Scott Joplin&quot; (1977), &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot; (1978), &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Last Dragon&quot; (1985). Ewart Abner, who had been associated with Motown since the 1960s, became its president in 1973.

John McClain, an A&amp;M Records executive, opined that Motown leaving its birth city marked a decline in the label&#x27;s quality. &quot;Something happened when [Motown] left Detroit and came to [Los Angeles],&quot; he said. &quot;They quit being innovators and started following trends. Before, Berry had a much more hands-on approach. And maybe you lose some of your desire after you get to a certain level financially.&quot;

By the 1970s, the Motown &quot;hit factory&quot; had become a target of a backlash from some fans of rock music. Record producer Pete Waterman recalls of this period: &quot;I was a DJ for years and I worked for Motown – the press at the time, papers like &quot;NME&quot;, used to call it Toytown. When I DJ&#x27;d on the Poly circuit, the students wanted me to play Spooky Tooth and Velvet Underground. Things don&#x27;t change. Nowadays, of course, Motown is hip.&quot;

Despite losing Holland–Dozier–Holland, Norman Whitfield, and some of its other hitmakers by 1975, Motown still had a number of successful artists during the 1970s and 1980s, including Lionel Richie and the Commodores, Rick James, Teena Marie, the Dazz Band, Jose Feliciano and DeBarge. By the mid-1980s, Motown had started losing money, and Berry Gordy sold his ownership in Motown to MCA Records (which began a North American distribution deal with the label in 1983) and Boston Ventures in June 1988 for $61 million. In 1989, Gordy sold the Motown Productions TV/film operations to Motown executive Suzanne de Passe, who renamed the company de Passe Entertainment and continues to run it . Gordy continued to retain the Jobete music publishing catalog, selling it separately to EMI Music Publishing in parts between 1997 and 2004. It is currently owned by Sony Music Publishing (Sony/ATV until 2021) through the acquisition of EMI Music Publishing in 2012 (as a leader of the consortium and eventually assigned full ownership in 2018).

During the 1990s, Motown was home to successful recording artists such as Boyz II Men and Johnny Gill, although the company itself remained in a state of turmoil. MCA appointed a series of executives to run the company, beginning with Berry Gordy&#x27;s immediate successor, Jheryl Busby. Busby quarreled with MCA, alleging that the company did not give Motown&#x27;s product adequate attention or promotion. In 1991, Motown sued MCA to have its distribution deal with the company terminated, and began releasing its product through PolyGram. PolyGram purchased Motown from Boston Ventures three years later.

In 1994, Busby was replaced by Andre Harrell, the entrepreneur behind Uptown Records. Harrell served as Motown&#x27;s CEO for just under two years, leaving the company after receiving bad publicity for being inefficient. Danny Goldberg, who ran PolyGram&#x27;s Mercury Records group, assumed control of Motown, and George Jackson served as president.

===Final years of the Motown label: 1999–2005===
By 1998, Motown had added stars such as 702, Brian McKnight, and Erykah Badu to its roster. In December 1998, PolyGram was acquired by Seagram, and Motown was absorbed into the Universal Music Group. Seagram had purchased Motown&#x27;s former parent MCA in 1995, and Motown was in effect reunited with many of its MCA corporate siblings (Seagram had hoped to build a media empire around Universal, and started by purchasing PolyGram). Universal briefly considered shuttering the label, but instead decided to restructure it. Kedar Massenburg, a producer for Erykah Badu, became the head of the label, and oversaw successful recordings from Badu, McKnight, Michael McDonald, and new Motown artist India.Arie.

Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, and the Temptations had remained with the label since its early days, although all except Wonder recorded for other labels for several years. Ross left Motown for RCA Records from 1981 to 1988, but returned in 1989 and stayed until 2002, while Robinson left Motown in 1991 (although he did return to release one more album for the label in 1999). The Temptations left for Atlantic Records in 1977, but returned in 1980 and eventually left again in 2004. Wonder finally left the label in 2020.

===Universal Motown: 2005–2011===

In 2005, Massenburg was replaced by Sylvia Rhone, former CEO of Elektra Records. Motown was merged with Universal Records to create the Universal Motown Records and placed under the newly created umbrella division of Universal Motown Republic Group. Notable artists on Universal Motown included Drake Bell, Ryan Leslie, Melanie Fiona, Kelly Rowland, Forever the Sickest Kids, The Veer Union and Four Year Strong. Motown celebrated its 50th anniversary on January 12, 2009, and celebrated it in Detroit on November 20, 2009, in a black-tie Gala titled &quot;Live It Again!&quot; The event was hosted by Sinbad and included Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, the Temptations, Aretha Franklin and Kid Rock.

===Relaunch: 2011–present===
In mid-2011, Universal Motown reverted to the Motown brand after having been separated from Universal Motown Republic Group, hired Ethiopia Habtemariam as its Senior Vice President, and operated under The Island Def Jam Music Group. Artists from Universal Motown were transferred to the newly revitalized Motown label. On January 25, 2012, it was announced that Ne-Yo would join the Motown label both as an artist as well as the new Senior Vice President of A&amp;R. On April 1, 2014, it was announced that Island Def Jam would no longer be running following the resignation of CEO Barry Weiss. A press release sent out by Universal Music Group announced that the label would now be reorganizing Def Jam Recordings, Island Records and Motown Records all as separate entities. Motown would then begin serving as a subsidiary of Capitol Records. In late 2018, Motown began celebrating its 60th anniversary by reissuing numerous albums from their catalog.

Motown UK launched in September 2020 under Universal UK&#x27;s EMI Records (formerly Virgin EMI Records) division.

Motown Records became part of UMG&#x27;s Republic Corps in 2024.

==Roster==
===Current===
==Motown sound==
Motown specialized in a type of soul music it referred to with the trademark &quot;The Motown sound&quot;. Crafted with an ear towards pop appeal, the Motown sound typically featured tambourines to accent the back beat, prominent and often melodic electric bass guitar lines, distinctive melodic and chord structures, and a call-and-response singing style that originated in gospel music. In 1971, Jon Landau wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the sound consisted of songs with simple structures but sophisticated melodies, along with a four-beat drum pattern, regular use of horns and strings, and &quot;a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio&quot;. Pop production techniques such as the use of orchestral string sections, charted horn sections, and carefully arranged background vocals were also used. Complex arrangements and elaborate, melismatic vocal riffs were avoided. Motown producers believed steadfastly in the &quot;KISS principle&quot; (keep it simple, stupid).

The Motown production process has been described as factory-like. The Hitsville studios remained open and active 22 hours a day, and artists would often go on tour for weeks, come back to Detroit to record as many songs as possible, and then promptly go on tour again. Berry Gordy held quality control meetings every Friday morning, and used veto power to ensure that only the very best material and performances would be released. The test was that every new release needed to fit into a sequence of the top five selling pop singles of the week. Several tracks that later became critical and commercial favorites were initially rejected by Gordy, the two most notable being the Marvin Gaye songs &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;. In several cases, producers would rework tracks in hopes of eventually getting them approved at a later Friday morning meeting, as producer Norman Whitfield did with &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; and the Temptations&#x27; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot;.

Many of Motown&#x27;s best-known songs, including all the early hits for the Supremes, were written by the songwriting trio of Holland–Dozier–Holland (Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland). Other important Motown producers and songwriters included Norman Whitfield, William &quot;Mickey&quot; Stevenson, Smokey Robinson, Barrett Strong, Nickolas Ashford &amp; Valerie Simpson, Frank Wilson, Pamela Sawyer &amp; Gloria Jones, James Dean &amp; William Weatherspoon, Johnny Bristol, Harvey Fuqua, Gil Askey, Stevie Wonder, and Gordy himself.

The style created by the Motown musicians was a major influence on several non-Motown artists of the mid-1960s, such as Dusty Springfield and the Foundations. In the United Kingdom, the Motown sound became the basis of the northern soul movement. Smokey Robinson said the Motown sound had little to do with Detroit:
===The Funk Brothers===

In addition to the songwriting process of the writers and producers, one of the major factors in the widespread appeal of Motown&#x27;s music was Gordy&#x27;s practice of using a highly-select and tight-knit group of studio musicians, collectively known as the Funk Brothers, to record the instrumental or &quot;band&quot; tracks of a majority of Motown recordings. Among the studio musicians responsible for the &quot;Motown sound&quot; were keyboardists Earl Van Dyke, Johnny Griffith, and Joe Hunter; guitarists Ray Monette, Joe Messina, Robert White, and Eddie Willis; percussionists Eddie &quot;Bongo&quot; Brown and Jack Ashford; drummers Benny Benjamin, Uriel Jones, and Richard &quot;Pistol&quot; Allen; and bassists James Jamerson and Bob Babbitt. The band&#x27;s career and work is chronicled in the 2002 documentary film &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot;, which publicised the fact that these musicians &quot;played on more number-one records than The Beatles, Elvis, The Rolling Stones, and The Beach Boys combined&quot;. Ashford later played on Raphael Saadiq&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;The Way I See It&quot;, whose recording and production were modelled after the Motown sound.

Much of the Motown sound came from the use of overdubbed and duplicated instrumentation. Motown songs regularly featured two drummers instead of one (either overdubbed or in unison), as well as three or four guitar lines.
Bassist James Jamerson often played his instrument with only the index finger of his right hand, and created many of the basslines apparent on Motown songs such as &quot;Up the Ladder to the Roof&quot; by the Supremes.

==Artist development==
Artist development was a major part of Motown&#x27;s operations instituted by Berry Gordy. The acts on the Motown label were fastidiously groomed, dressed and choreographed for live performances. Motown artists were advised that their breakthrough into the white popular music market made them ambassadors for other African-American artists seeking broad market acceptance, and that they should think, act, walk and talk like royalty, so as to alter the less-than-dignified image commonly held of black musicians by white Americans in that era. Given that many of the talented young artists had been raised in housing projects and lacked the necessary social and dress experience, this Motown department was not only necessary, it created an elegant style of presentation long associated with the label. The artist development department specialized primarily in working with younger, less-experienced acts; experienced performers such as Jr. Walker and Marvin Gaye were exempt from artist-development classes.

Many of the young artists participated in an annual package tour called the &quot;Motortown Revue&quot;, which was popular, first, on the &quot;Chitlin&#x27; Circuit&quot;, and, later, around the world. The tours gave the younger artists a chance to hone their performance and social skills and learn from the more experienced artists.

==Motown subsidiary labels==
In order to avoid accusations of payola should DJs play too many records from the original Tamla label, Gordy formed Motown Records as a second label in 1960. The two labels featured the same writers, producers and artists.

Many more subsidiary labels were established later under the umbrella of the Motown parent company, including Gordy Records, Soul Records and VIP Records; in reality the Motown Record Corporation controlled all of these labels. Most of the distinctions between Motown labels were largely arbitrary, with the same writers, producers and musicians working on all the major subsidiaries, and artists were often shuffled between labels for internal marketing reasons. All of these records are usually considered to be &quot;Motown&quot; records, regardless of whether they actually appeared on the Motown Records label itself.

===Major divisions===
* Tamla Records: Established 1959, Tamla was a primary subsidiary for mainstream R&amp;B/soul music. Tamla is the company&#x27;s original label: Gordy founded Tamla Records several months before establishing the Motown Record Corporation. The label&#x27;s numbering system was combined with those of Motown and Gordy in 1982, and the label was merged with Motown in 1988. Notable Tamla artists included Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, the Marvelettes, and Eddie Kendricks. Tamla was briefly re-activated in 1996 as a reggae label, but only released a 12&quot; single by Cocoa Tea called &quot;New Immigration Law&quot;. Tamla also had a sub-label called Penny Records in 1959; artists on that label included Bryan Brent And The Cut Outs, who recorded a single for the label entitled &quot;Vacation Time&quot; b/w &quot;For Eternity&quot; (2201). In 2023, it was announced that Tamla would be re-activated again for the first time in nearly 30 years. This time around, it will be relaunched under Capitol Christian Music Group as an imprint devoted solely to positive R&amp;B and hip hop. Tamla Records slogan: &quot;The Sound that Makes the World Go &#x27;Round&quot;.
* Motown Records: Established 1960, Motown was and remains the company&#x27;s main label for mainstream R&amp;B/soul music (and, today, hip-hop music as well). The label&#x27;s numbering system was combined with those of Tamla and Gordy in 1982, and the label (and company) was purchased by MCA in 1988. Notable Motown artists have included Mary Wells, the Supremes, Four Tops, the Jackson 5, Michael Jackson, Jermaine Jackson, Boyz II Men, Commodores, Lionel Richie, Dazz Band, Brian McKnight, 98 Degrees, and Erykah Badu. Motown Records slogan: &quot;The Sound of Young America&quot;.
* Gordy Records: Established 1962, Gordy was also a primary subsidiary for mainstream R&amp;B/soul music. Originally known as &quot;Miracle Records&quot; (slogan: &quot;If It&#x27;s a Hit, It&#x27;s a Miracle&quot;), the name was changed in 1962 to avoid confusion with the Miracles singing group. The label&#x27;s numbering system was combined with those of Motown and Tamla in 1982, and the label was merged with Motown in 1988. Notable Gordy artists included the Temptations, Martha and the Vandellas, the Contours, Edwin Starr, Rick James, The Mary Jane Girls, Teena Marie, Switch, and DeBarge. Gordy Records slogan: &quot;It&#x27;s What&#x27;s in the Grooves that Counts&quot;.

* Tamla Motown Records: Motown&#x27;s non-US label, established in March 1965 and folded into the regular Motown label in 1976. Distributed by EMI, Tamla Motown issued the releases on the American Motown labels, using its own numbering system. In some cases, Tamla Motown would issue singles and albums not released in the United States (for example, the singles &quot;I Second That Emotion&quot; and &quot;Why (Must We Fall in Love)&quot; by Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes with the Temptations, as well as the successful &quot;Motown Chartbusters&quot; series of albums).

===Secondary R&amp;B labels===
* Check-Mate Records: Short-lived (1961–1962) R&amp;B/soul subsidiary, purchased from Chess Records. Notable artists included David Ruffin and The Del-Phis (later Martha and the Vandellas).
* Miracle Records: Short-lived (1961) R&amp;B/soul subsidiary that lasted less than a year. Some pressings featured the infamous tagline, &quot;If it&#x27;s a hit, it&#x27;s a Miracle.&quot; Renamed Gordy Records in 1962. Notable releases included early recordings by Jimmy Ruffin and the Temptations.
* MoWest Records: MoWest was a short-lived (1971–1973; 1976 in UK) subsidiary for R&amp;B/soul artists based on the West Coast. Shut down when the main Motown office moved to Los Angeles. Notable artists included Lesley Gore, G. C. Cameron, the Sisters Love, Syreeta Wright, the Four Seasons, Commodores (their first two singles in 1972 and 1973), The Devastating Affair, and Los Angeles DJ Tom Clay. Unlike other Motown releases in the UK that were released by Tamla Motown, MoWest retained its US label design and logo for its UK releases as well. In fact, MoWest lasted longer in the UK up until 1976.
* Motown Yesteryear: a label created in late 1970s and used through the 1980s for the reissues of 7-inch singles from all eras of the company&#x27;s history, after printing in the initial label has ceased. One Motown Yesteryear single made &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top 40 – the Contours&#x27; &quot;Do You Love Me&quot;, in 1988, when its inclusion in the film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; revived interest.
* Soul Records: Established in 1964, Soul was a R&amp;B/soul subsidiary for releases with less of a jazz feel and/or more of a blues feel. Notable Soul artists included Jr. Walker &amp; the All-Stars, Shorty Long, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, the Originals, the Fantastic Four, and Jimmy Ruffin. The label was dissolved in 1978. This label has no affiliation with the short-lived S.O.U.L. Records, an early 1990s imprint that was founded by the production team the Bomb Squad.
* V.I.P. Records: Established in 1964, V.I.P. was an R&amp;B/soul subsidiary. Notable artists included the Velvelettes, the Spinners, the Monitors, the Elgins and Chris Clark. V.I.P. also was the outlet for pop records that were leased to Motown by EMI (the distributor of Tamla-Motown in Europe). The label was dissolved in 1974.
* Weed Records: A very short-lived subsidiary. Only one release, Chris Clark&#x27;s 1969 &quot;CC Rides Again&quot; album, was issued. This release featured the tongue-in-cheek tagline: &quot;Your Favorite Artists Are On Weed&quot;. The logo was a parody of the &quot;Snapping Fingers&quot; logo for Stax Records, but the hand in this case is holding up a peace sign. The name &quot;Weed Records&quot; is now owned by the Tokyo/New York-based &quot;Weed Records&quot;.

===Additional genre labels===

* Prodigal Records.: Purchased by Motown in 1976, Motown used Prodigal Records as a second rock music subsidiary; a successor label to Rare Earth Records. The Rare Earth band moved over to the label following the Rare Earth label&#x27;s demise.

<doc id="167397" wikidata="Q6821812" url="?curid=167397" title="Message to the Free Nations of the World">
<text>In 1919 the First Dáil of the Irish Republic issued a Message to the Free Nations of the World (, ). The message was approved by Dáil Éireann on 21 January 1919. It asked nations to recognise Ireland as a separate nation, free from British rule. It was adopted in three languages: Irish, English and French. 

Little attention was paid to it by the free nations as World War I was ending. An Armistice had been signed, but the war technically ended with the Treaty of Versailles which was signed in June 1919. Britain assured its fellow-victors that the situation in Ireland would be dealt with under the new principles of self-determination, and so significant Irish support in America was negated by President Wilson who would not recognise the sovereignty of the Irish Republic. The British solution was enacted in 1920 as the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The Irish Republic was not recognised by any other state.

==The text of the Message to the Free Nations of the World (English)==

&quot;To the Nations of the World—Greeting&quot;

&quot;The Nation of Ireland having proclaimed her national independence, calls, through her elected representatives in Parliament assembled in the Irish Capital on January 21, 1919, upon every free nation to support the Irish Republic by recognising Ireland&#x27;s national status and her right to its vindication at the Peace Congress.&quot;

&quot;Naturally, the race, the language, the customs and traditions of Ireland are radically distinct from the English. Ireland is one of the most ancient nations in Europe, and she has preserved her national integrity, vigorous and intact, through seven centuries of foreign oppression; she has never relinquished her national rights, and throughout the long era of English usurpation she has in every generation defiantly proclaimed her inalienable right of nationhood down to her last glorious resort to arms in 1916.&quot;

&quot;Internationally, Ireland is the gateway to the Atlantic; Ireland is the last outpost of Europe towards the West; Ireland is the point upon which great trade routes between East and West converge; her independence is demanded by the Freedom of the Seas; her great harbours must be open to all nations, instead of being the monopoly of England. To-day these harbours are empty and idle solely because English policy is determined to retain Ireland as a barren bulwark for English aggrandisement, and the unique geographical position of this island, far from being a benefit and safeguard to Europe and America, is subjected to the purposes of England&#x27;s policy of world domination.&quot;

&quot;Ireland to-day reasserts her historic nationhood the more confidently before the new world emerging from the war, because she believes in freedom and justice as the fundamental principles of international law; because she believes in a frank co-operation between the peoples for equal rights against the vested privileges of ancient tyrannies; because the permanent peace of Europe can never be secured by perpetuating military dominion for the profit of empire but only by establishing the control of government in every land upon the basis of the free will of a free people, and the existing state of war, between Ireland and England, can never be ended until Ireland is definitely evacuated by the armed forces of England.&quot;

&quot;For these among other reasons, Ireland—resolutely and irrevocably determined at the dawn of the promised era of self-determination and liberty that she will suffer foreign dominion no longer—calls upon every free nation to uphold her national claim to complete independence as an Irish Republic against the arrogant pretensions of England founded in fraud and sustained only by an overwhelming military occupation, and demands to be confronted publicly with England at the Congress of the Nations, that the civilised world having judged between English wrong and Irish right may guarantee to Ireland its permanent support for the maintenance of her national independence.&quot;

<doc id="167401" wikidata="Q2003736" url="?curid=167401" title="Pacific Crest Trail">
<text>The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), officially designated as the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, is a long-distance hiking and equestrian trail closely aligned with the highest portion of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, which lie east of the U.S. Pacific coast. The trail&#x27;s southern terminus is next to the Mexico–United States border, just south of Campo, California, and its northern terminus is on the Canada–US border, upon which it continues unofficially to the Windy Joe Trail within Manning Park in British Columbia; it passes through the states of California, Oregon, and Washington.

The Pacific Crest Trail is long and ranges in elevation from roughly above sea level near the Bridge of the Gods on the Oregon–Washington border to at Forester Pass in the Sierra Nevada. The route passes through 25 national forests and 7 national parks. Its midpoint is near Chester, California (near Mt. Lassen), where the Sierra and Cascade mountain ranges meet. The overall elevation gain for the Pacific Crest Trail is approximately .

It was designated a National Scenic Trail in 1968, although it was not officially completed until 1993. The PCT was conceived by Clinton Churchill Clarke in 1932. It received official status under the National Trails System Act of 1968.

The Pacific Crest Trail, the Appalachian Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail form what is known as the Triple Crown of Hiking in the United States. The Pacific Crest Trail is also part of the 6,875-mile Great Western Loop.

==Route==

The route is mostly through National Forest and protected wilderness. It also passes through seven national parks: Kings Canyon, Sequoia, Yosemite, Lassen Volcanic, Crater Lake, Mt. Rainier, and North Cascades. The trail avoids civilization and covers scenic and pristine mountainous terrain with few roads. It passes through the Laguna, Santa Rosa, San Jacinto, San Bernardino, San Gabriel, Liebre, Tehachapi, Sierra Nevada, and Klamath ranges in California, and the Cascade Range in California, Oregon, and Washington.

==History==

The Pacific Crest Trail was first proposed around 1932 by Clinton C. Clarke as a trail running from Mexico to Canada along the crest of the mountains in California, Oregon, and Washington. The original proposal was to link the John Muir Trail, the Tahoe–Yosemite Trail (both in California), the Skyline Trail (in Oregon) and the Cascade Crest Trail (in Washington).

The Pacific Crest Trail System Conference was formed by Clarke to both plan the trail and to lobby the federal government to protect the trail. The conference was founded by Clarke, the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, and Ansel Adams (amongst others). From 1935 through 1938, YMCA groups explored the 2,000 miles of potential trail and planned a route, which has been closely followed by the modern PCT route.

In recent years, Washington state clubwoman and educator Catherine T. Montgomery&#x27;s contributions to the initial concept of the Pacific Crest Trail have been explored and she is known as the &quot;Mother of the Pacific Crest Trail&quot;.

In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson defined the PCT and the Appalachian Trail with the National Trails System Act. The PCT was then constructed through cooperation between the federal government and volunteers organized by the Pacific Crest Trail Association. In 1993, the PCT was officially declared finished.

The Trust for Public Land has purchased and conserved more than along the Pacific Crest Trail in Washington. Consolidation of this land has allowed for better recreational access as well as greater ease to manage conservation lands.

A bicycle touring route has been developed to parallel the PCT on paved and unpaved roads.

==Thru-hiking==
Thru-hiking is a term used in referring to hikers who complete long-distance trails from end to end in a single trip. Thru-hiking is a long commitment, usually taking between four and six months, that requires thorough preparation and dedication. The Pacific Crest Trail Association estimates that it takes most hikers between six and eight months to plan, train, and get ready for their trips. It is estimated the average completion rate is around 14%.

While most hikers travel from the southern terminus at the Mexico–US border northward to Manning Park, British Columbia, some hikers prefer a southbound route. In a normal weather year, northbound hikes are most practical due to snow and temperature considerations. Additionally, some hiker services are seasonal and may be better timed for northbound hikers. If snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is high in early June and low in the Northern Cascades, some hikers may choose to &#x27;flip-flop.&#x27; Flip-flopping can take many forms but often describes a process whereby a hiker begins at one end (on the PCT, usually the southern end) of the trail and then, at some point, like reaching the Sierra, &#x27;flips&#x27; to the end of the trail at the Canada–US border and hikes southbound to complete the trail. However, it is not currently possible to legally enter the United States from Canada by using the Pacific Crest Trail.

Hikers also have to determine their resupply points. Resupply points are towns or post offices where hikers replenish food and other supplies such as cooking fuel. Hikers can ship packages to themselves at the U.S. Post Offices along the trail, resupply at general and grocery stores along the trail, or any combination of the two. The final major logistical step is to create an approximate schedule for completion. Thru hikers have to make sure they complete enough miles every day to reach the opposite end of the trail before weather conditions make sections impassable. For northbound thru-hikers, deep snow pack in the Sierra Nevada can prevent an early start. The timing is a balance between not getting to the Sierra too soon nor the Northern Cascades too late. Most hikers cover about 20 miles (32 km) per day.

In order to reduce their hiking time and thereby increase their chances of completing the trail, many hikers try to substantially reduce their pack weight. Since the creation of the Pacific Crest Trail there has been a large movement by hikers to get away from large heavy packs with a lot of gear. There are three general classifications for hikers: Traditional, Lightweight, and Ultralight.

==Notable hikers==
Before the PCT became an official trail, Martin Papendick was the first known person to hike across three states of the PCT in 1952. After being one of the first to finish the Appalachian Trail in 1951, Papendick hiked between July 4 and December 1, 1952, from British Columbia to the Mexico–US border over the crests of the mountains along the Pacific Coast, a feat he reported in a periodical under the title &quot;Pacific Crest Trails&quot;.

On October 16, 1970, Eric Ryback, an 18-year-old student, completed the first PCT thru-hike. His personal congratulations came by telegram from Edward P. Cliff, Chief of the U.S. Forest Service. Ryback is credited, recognized, and has been honored by the Pacific Crest Trail Association as the official first thru-hiker of the entire trail. Ryback completed the Appalachian Trail in 1969 (as a 16-year-old); the Pacific Crest Trail in 1970; and a route approximating today&#x27;s Continental Divide Trail in 1972. Ryback&#x27;s 1971 book &quot;The High Adventure of Eric Ryback: Canada to Mexico on Foot&quot; focused public attention on the PCT. Ryback carried an 80-pound pack on his 1970 thru-hike. He had only five resupply packages on the entire trip and was loaded with 40 pounds of food at the start of each leg. He often ran out of food and foraged or went hungry. Ryback also helped the Forest Service lay out future plans for the PCT.

However, Ryback&#x27;s claim is disputed. When the guidebook publisher Wilderness Press stated that Ryback had used motor transport in places along the PCT, Ryback sued for $3 million but withdrew the suit after Wilderness Press revealed statements from the people who claim to have picked up the young hiker along highways parallel to the 2,600-mile trail. Ryback is in Smithsonian&#x27;s top 9 list of people &quot;Cheating Their Way to Fame&quot; though it notes that &quot;the claims that Ryback &#x27;cheated&#x27; are still doubted by some&quot;.

Richard Watson, who completed the trail on September 1, 1972, was often credited as the first PCT thru-hiker because Papendick was generally unknown and Ryback may have accepted rides. The first woman to complete the PCT was Mary Carstens, who finished the journey later in 1972, accompanied by Jeff Smukler.

The first person to thru-hike the entire PCT both ways in a single continuous round-trip was Scott Williamson, who completed the &quot;yo-yo&quot; circuit on his fourth attempt in November 2004. Williamson traveled a total of in 197 days, covering an average of per day when not in snow – an overall average of per day – wearing an extremely ultra-lightweight pack, which &quot;without food, weighed about &quot;. Williamson then went on to complete a second round trip on November 28, 2006, cutting two weeks off his 2004 time.

In 2014, Olive McGloin (from Ireland) became the first woman to thru-hike the PCT both ways in a single continuous round-trip.

The youngest person to hike the trail is Christian Thomas Geiger, who at the age of 6 completed the trail with his parents Andrea Rego and Dion Pagonis. Christian, also known by his trail name Buddy Backpacker, was also the youngest person to hike the Appalachian Trail until 2020.

Other notable young hikers include Sierra Burror and Reed Gjonnes. Burror, who completed a continuous thru-hike of the trail in 2012 at the age of 9, is the youngest girl to thru-hike the trail. She completed her hike with her mother, Heather Burror. Gjonnes, who thru-hiked the trail in 2011 at age 11, went on to complete the Triple Crown of Hiking, becoming the youngest person ever to do so.

Teddi Boston hiked from Canada to Mexico on the PCT in 1976 at the age of 49. She was one of the first women to hike the trail alone.

An autobiographical account of a woman hiking a portion of the PCT alone in 1995 at age 26 was written by Cheryl Strayed. Her memoir &quot;&quot; was published in 2012 and reached #1 on the New York Times Best Sellers list. Her hike is the subject of the 2014 film &quot;Wild&quot;, starring Reese Witherspoon.

The first two reported deaths on the Pacific Crest Trail were in November 1995, when thru-hikers Jane and Flicka Rodman were killed during a detour down California State Route 138 in Southern California, when they were struck by a motorist who lost control of his vehicle. They were less than 400 miles from their goal of reaching the Mexico–US border.

The oldest person to thru-hike the trail is not fully established, with multiple competing claims.

===Fastest known times===

====Self-supported====
On August 7, 2013, Heather &quot;Anish&quot; Anderson of Bellingham, Washington, set the self-supported speed record. She completed the PCT in 60 days, 17 hours, 12 minutes, beating the previous record by almost 4 days. She documented this journey in her book &quot;Thirst&quot;. In 2018 she became the first woman to complete the Triple Crown of Hiking in a single calendar year.

Exactly nine years later, on August 7, 2022, Josh Perry improved upon the self-supported speed record, completing the PCT in 55 days, 16 hours and 54 minutes. 

In 2023, Nick Folwer set a new self-supported record of 52 days, 9 hours and 18 minutes. While he was in the Sierra Nevada, Hurricane Hilary hit California, and he needed to spend 41 hours sheltering in a cave from the weather. 

====Supported====
On August 10, 2014, Joseph McConaughy of Shoreline, Washington, set a new supported speed record and the overall fastest known time for the PCT. The distance was covered in 53 days, 6 hours, and 37 minutes. This surpassed the previous record of 59 days, 8 hours, 14 minutes, set by Josh Garret on August 8, 2013, by more than 6 days. Joe was supported by a team of three hikers, Jordan Hamm, Michael Dillon, and Jack Murphy.

McConaughy&#x27;s record was broken on August 14, 2016, by Karel Sabbe, a 27-year-old dentist from Ghent, Belgium. He covered the distance in 52 days, 8 hours, and 25 minutes, averaging over 50 miles a day and shaving almost a day (22 hours) off the previous record set by McConaughy. Sabbe was supported by his friend Joren Biebuyck.

On July 22, 2021, 37-year-old ultra-runner Timothy Olson broke Sabbe&#x27;s record with a time of 51 days, 16 hours and 55 minutes, fifteen and a half hours faster than Sabbe&#x27;s time. Olson was crewed by a small group of family and friends.

On August 26, 2023, Karel Sabbe took back his record with a time of 46 days, 12 hours and 56 minutes, more than five days faster than Olson&#x27;s time.

==Equestrian use==
Don and June Mulford made the first verifiable equestrian Thru-Ride of the PCT in 1959. In that year the Pacific Crest Trail stretched a poorly-marked 2,400 miles from Mexico to Canada. More concept than footpath, the trail was an oft-broken, high-ridge track disappearing regularly from map and terrain. On April 19, 1959, on an empty scrub sage plain seven miles east of Tijuana, with four horses, Don and June Mulford began their journey north to the Washington–Canada border. The Mulfords went to Hollywood for three months immediately after the ride and were featured on network television. June&#x27;s old press book yields a half-dozen TV-Guide pages, and she recalls, &quot;Art Linkletter was such a nice man. We appeared on his &#x27;House Party&#x27; show and he had coffee with us afterward&quot;. &quot;High Road to Danger&quot;, a syndicated TV show, made an episode on their ride. Even after they had returned home to the Northwest, there was continued TV coverage. A January 1961 TV Guide records their appearance on Portland&#x27;s KOIN Red Dunning Show. The Mulfords even made a 90-minute movie and showed it around 12 western states for 10 years.

The Murray family (Barry, Bernice, Barry Jr. and Bernadette) completed the trek on horseback on October 7, 1970.

==Future==
In 2008, an agreement for realignment through Tejon Ranch in Southern California was reached. This realignment would relocate 37 miles of the PCT from the Mojave Desert floor to the more scenic Tehachapi Mountains. While an agreement was reached, the realignment is a long-term project; many details remain to be determined, as well as an Optimal Location Review—a lengthy process through which the ideal path for the new section of the trail is specified.

Portland, Oregon&#x27;s 40-Mile Loop proposes to extend the Springwater Corridor hiking and bicycling spur trail to connect the Pacific Crest Trail with the proposed Cazadero Trail. Plans are currently in progress to add a dedicated pedestrian/equestrian lane to the Bridge of the Gods across the Columbia River. Currently, PCT hikers and equestrians must cross the bridge walking in vehicle traffic lanes—a potential danger which the new lane will eliminate. The completion date for this project is unknown.
