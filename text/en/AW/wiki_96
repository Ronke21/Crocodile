==History==

===Origins===

This area was already being used as a burial place in Gallo-Roman times, around the 2nd and 3rd century. The earliest name of the settlement, &quot;Thudinium Castellum&quot;, referring to a Roman fortification, is found on a 9th-century offering in Lobbes Abbey, which lists various neighbouring towns and related tithe duties. The village was a possession of the abbey of Lobbes and, together with the abbey, became part of the Bishopric of Liège in 888. The neighbouring Aulne Abbey, reputedly founded in the 7th century by Landelin, a repentant robber, was also made part of the Bishopric of Liège.

A century later, Prince-Bishop Notger had a defensive wall built in Thuin, which then became the westernmost of the 23 &quot;bonnes villes&quot; (or principal cities) of the bishopric.

===The frontiers of the Bishopric of Liège===

In the following centuries, several battles took place in this frontier area. In 1048, Adalbert, Duke of Lorraine was killed at the Battle of Thuin by Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine. Many more battles followed between the County of Hainaut and the Bishopric of Liège, with Thuin caught in between. Despite the stronger defensive walls that were built in the 12th century and in the 15th century, Thuin was besieged several times. The Aulne Abbey, which had been given to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux in 1147 fared better and was even expanded several times in the 16th and 18th century. In 1654, the Spanish army under the Prince of Condé tried in vain to take Thuin. The good fortunes of the city were attributed to the intercession of Saint Roch, who is still commemorated in the annual St-Roch procession. Several 17th-century buildings, including the belfry, can still be seen today in the upper city. In 1675, the troops of Louis XIV took and occupied Thuin until the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678. Like its neighbour Charleroi, Thuin went in turn to Spain and Austria.

===After the French Revolution===

On May 10, 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, General Marceau expelled the Austrians and Thuin became part of France. The Aulne Abbey was burned to the ground. In 1829, on the eve of the Belgian Revolution, William II of the Netherlands was welcomed in Thuin, to no avail. The last major heavy fighting around Thuin occurred on August 23, 1914, at the onset of World War I, when the French army found itself nearly surrounded by the German army.

==Sights==
*The Belfry of Thuin, dating from the 17th century, has been named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. A view of the Thuin area can be seen from the top.
*Thuin is the location of the ASVi museum, specialising in the history of the Belgian Vicinal tramway system. This includes a museum tramway that runs through the streets of the town.
*The “hanging gardens” on the southern flank of the Thuin hill can be visited on foot, following a path enhanced by several explanation signs.
*The ruins of the 7th-century Aulne Abbey.
*The neighbouring village of Ragnies, also mentioned in the Lobbes offering, is a member of the most beautiful villages of Wallonia association.
*The &quot;Château du Fosteau&quot; dates from the 14th and 15th century. Its French gardens and pond are a haven of calm, while the interior of the castle harbours a permanent exhibit of ancient furniture and a small pharmacy museum.

==Festivities==

*Every third Sunday of May, the town commemorates the help it received from Saint Roch during its fight against the Spanish army in 1654. The parade, as much a military march as a religious procession, was banned in the 18th century, but was reinstated in 1866 after Saint Roch delivered the city again, this time from an epidemic of cholera. The tradition has continued until today, interrupted only by the two world wars and the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="175352" wikidata="Q130217525" url="?curid=175352" title="Autograph collecting">
<text>Autograph collecting is the practice of collecting autographs of famous persons. Some of the most popular categories of autograph subjects are politicians, military soldiers, athletes, movie stars, artists, social and religious leaders, scientists, astronauts, and authors.

Some collectors may specialize in specific fields (such as Nobel Prize winners) or general topics (military leaders participating in World War I) or specific documents (e.g., signers of the Charter of the United Nations; signers of the U.S. Constitution; signers of the Israeli Declaration of Independence; signers of the Charter of the European Common Union; signers of the World War II German or Japanese surrender documents).

Collecting autographs may be in decline with fans preferring selfies instead.

==Commercialization==
Some celebrities still enjoy signing autographs for free for fans. Many people who stand outside premieres asking for autographs are actually professional autograph traders, who make their living or supplement their income by selling them for full profit, rather than keeping them as a personal souvenir. This is one of the main reasons for some celebrities only giving their signatures for a fee. Joe DiMaggio was able to earn more money through signing fees than he made in his playing career, though he also gave individual autographs. Bill Russell did not sign at all in public, and only sparingly at private sessions. Michael Jordan reportedly did not sign for most of his career because of safety concerns about frenzied attempts to get his signature, which is worth thousands of dollars. Jordan has frequently signed at more peaceful events, such as golf tournaments. Pete Rose was paid to sign 30 baseballs with the inscription &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I bet on baseball.&quot; In the 1980s, actor/comedian Steve Martin carried business cards which he handed out to fans requesting an autograph; the cards read &quot;This certifies that you have had a personal encounter with me and that you found me warm, polite, intelligent and funny.&quot;

Realizing the potential profit in the sale of pop culture autographs, many dealers also would wait for hours for a celebrity to emerge from a location, present several photos for the celebrity to sign and then sell most of them. Michael Jackson&#x27;s experience was typical; he often signed just a handful of autographs as he rushed from his hotel to his vehicle. Some collectors take note of which celebrities are the most gracious or the least forthcoming. Some dealers would locate a celebrity&#x27;s home address and write to them repeatedly asking for autographs. Some celebrities soon grew tired of the practice and limited their responses. Because of the many autographs a celebrity might sign over time, some check requests against a record of past requests. Boxer George Foreman, for instance, records the names and addresses of every person requesting an autograph to limit such abuses. Some famous people flatly refused to autograph anything for fans, such as the actors Paul Newman and Greta Garbo, and the aviator Charles A. Lindbergh.

==Duplication, forging and authentication==
Autograph collectors enjoy assembling signed historical documents, letters, or objects as a way of capturing a piece of history. However, forgers seek to profit by selling forged items. Sometimes just the signature has been forged, in other instances the entire document has been fabricated. Differentiating forged from authentic autographs is almost impossible for the amateur collector, but a professional may be consulted.

One method commonly seen on eBay is called &quot;preprinting&quot; by many sellers. The item is only a photocopy of an actual autographed photo, usually printed on glossy home photo paper. Since this is almost always disclosed to the buyer, some may not consider these actual forgeries. In October 2012, Chad Richard Baldwin of Gresham, Oregon, was sentenced to two years in prison for the sale of forged Babe Ruth and Beatles autographs. Baldwin is a highly skilled forger of sports memorabilia.

Forgers may go to great lengths to make their forgeries appear authentic. Some use blank end papers from old books upon which to write their fake signatures in an attempt to match the paper of the era in which the personality lived. They have researched ink formulations of the era that they want to replicate. A 1988 book that explores the production of impressive fake manuscripts pertaining to Mormons is &quot;A Gathering of Saints&quot; by Robert Lindsey.

Collectors should know the era in which American presidents signed their documents. American presidents signed land grants until President Andrew Jackson (c. 1836) became bored with the time-consuming task. Since then, secretaries of the president have mimicked their employer&#x27;s signatures on these documents (known as &quot;proxy&quot; signatures). Many movie stars have their secretaries sign their letters and photographs for them. When Ronald Reagan was an actor during the 1940s, he had his mother sign his name to much of his fan mail.

During the American Civil War, Jefferson Davis&#x27;s wife frequently signed his name to his dictated letters due to his extensive correspondence. As she duplicated his signature so well, she usually placed a period after the signature so that he could discern her signatures from his own.

All of the Union and Confederate generals from the American Civil War have had their signatures forged. Many were faked during the 1880s, a period that included the fad of aging soldiers in collecting Civil War autographs. Most deceptions were of mere signatures on a small piece of paper, but extensively written letters were forged as well. Collectors should be cautious of &quot;clipped signatures&quot;. The bogus autograph is glued onto an authentic steel-engraved portrait of the subject. Some steel engravings may have reprinted the autograph of the portrayed subject; this is known as a &quot;facsimile autograph&quot;, and it may appear to be real.

===Secretarial signatures===

Celebrities sometimes authorized secretaries to sign their correspondence. In the early months of World War II, U.S. Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall felt obligated to sign every condolence letter sent to the families of slain soldiers. But as the death rate increased, he was forced to assign an assistant to forge his signature to the letters. The surrogate signatures were hard to distinguish from the originals. General Douglas MacArthur rarely signed a WWII condolence letter personally and all of his letters to families were signed by one of two assistants who tried hard to duplicate his signature but the forged signatures were distinguished by an unusually high letter &quot;l&quot; and a skinny &quot;D&quot;. During the early stage of the Korean War, MacArthur personally signed condolence letters. As the fatalities increased, the General began to use letters with pre-printed signatures.

In the 1952 U.S. presidential election, General Dwight D. Eisenhower often had secretaries forge his name to campaign letters and &quot;personally inscribed&quot; autographed photographs.

Player signatures on baseballs and footballs that are actually signed by coaches and ballboys are called clubhouse signatures.

===Autopen autographing===
Since the early 1950s almost all American presidents have had an autopen or robot machine for the automatic signing of a signature as an autograph machine for their letters, photographs, books, official documents, and even memorabilia items such as baseballs and golf balls. Some former presidents even have continued to utilize the autopen after they have left office. The Signa-Signer can even write out in ink an authentically looking handwritten message that has been typed into the machine. One book detailing the use of this machine by President John F. Kennedy (1961–1963) is &quot;The Robot That Helped to Make a President&quot; by Charles Hamilton.

Since the 1960s, the practice of using an autopen has spread to U.S. Cabinet members, U.S. Senators, some state governors, and many other personalities who have a high volume of correspondence with the public.

Astronaut Alan Shepard acknowledged that NASA used the autopen machine to sign the astronauts&#x27; voluminous correspondence. Many large corporations also use these machines for signing business letters. Although autopen signatures should constantly match one another, they will eventually change as the signature drum becomes worn, and thereby alters the signature. Due to these professional imitations, buyers are often wary of buying presidential or astronaut signatures from unknown sellers.

===Deceptive devices===
Some personalities have used a rubber or steel hand-stamp to &quot;sign&quot; their documents. American President Andrew Johnson (c. 1866) did so during his tenure as a senator prior to assuming the presidency, since his right hand was injured in a train accident. This is why his autograph as president differs from previous autographs. President Warren Harding frequently used a rubber stamp while he was a senator. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt used them, along with President Woodrow Wilson (c. 1916). England&#x27;s King Henry VIII and Pennsylvania colony founder William Penn used a deceiving hand stamp.

Joseph Stalin had several rubber signature stamps which were used on awards and Communist Party cards. Nikita Khrushchev and Lavrenti Beria, the KGB chief, used similar stamps.

Quality forgeries have been made for many of Europe&#x27;s past rulers. The French nobles had their &quot;secrétaires&quot; sign their documents. 

Many famous astronauts, Arctic explorers, musicians, poets, and literary authors have had forgeries of their epistles and signatures produced. False signatures of Charles Lindbergh were clandestinely signed onto real 1930-era airmail envelopes bought at stamp shops and then re-sold to unwary buyers; the same has occurred with Amelia Earhart and the Wright brothers. Mickey Mouse creator Walt Disney had several of his cartoonists duplicate his artistic signature on replies to children seeking his autograph. Disney&#x27;s actual autograph was distinctly different from the way it appears in his cartoons.

Texan paper currency was signed in ink by Sam Houston, though not handwritten by Houston himself.

The October 1986 &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine explored &quot;The Persistence of Memory&quot;, a 1931 painting by the Spanish artist Salvador Dalí. It quoted one of his secretaries as claiming that she signed the artist&#x27;s signature to postcard depictions of his paintings. Another article in the April 2005 &quot;Smithsonian&quot; noted: &quot;In 1965 he began selling signed sheets of otherwise blank lithograph paper for $10 a sheet. He may have signed well over 50,000 in the remaining quarter century of his life, an action that resulted in a flood of Dalí lithograph forgeries.&quot;

Some deceivers cut pages from books that American President Richard Nixon signed on the blank flyleaf, typed his letter of resignation from the presidency on that signed page, and then sold the doctored item as if Nixon had personally signed a scarce copy of the historical document. This practice has expanded to include quotations from George W. Bush, Hillary Clinton, John F. Kennedy, and Franklin D. Roosevelt.

===Authentication===
With the recent enormous growth of autograph sellers on eBay, and the appearance of a multitude of new galleries and retailers offering expensive autographs, casual autograph collectors and one-time buyers have in many instances sought certificates of authenticity issued by the seller at the time of sale. As with any guarantee, these certificates are only as dependable as the seller issuing them, and if the seller is a fraud, then the certificate, and the possibility that the signed item could be considered worthless. Any certificate or similar issued by a seller should always include the seller&#x27;s full contact details and any details of Association memberships, and these should always be double checked on the Associations website.
In many instances, sellers will use a professional authenticator to determine the authenticity of the material they wish to bring to market. The autograph industry is currently contentiously split between two types of authenticators: those who rely upon their professional expertise and experience personally having collected or sold large inventories of autographs over a period of many years, such as the consultants at AutographCOA.com (ACOA), and &quot;forensic examiners&quot; who rely on academic credentials. Disputes have led to court actions, most notably gallery owner American Royal Arts vs. Beatles autograph dealer Frank Caiazzo, often used by autograph sources such as RR Auction.

Potential autograph buyers uncertain of the legitimacy of the seller or authenticator may research both parties, and may check any dealer who claims membership of any association. PADA, the UACC, RACC, and AFTAL include a list of dealers on their websites. This research should not be limited to a seller&#x27;s or an authenticator&#x27;s website which could be prejudiced. Some dealers have been known to invent their own association, e.g. &quot;The Universal Manuscript Society&quot;, to enhance their reputations.

Mastro Auctions, a major sports autograph auction house which used a professional authenticator, was sued by a dealer in 2006 (&quot;Bill Daniels v. Mastro Auctions&quot;, Boone County, Indiana, case #06D01-0502 -PL- 0060). Daniels said that he had bought more than 2,000 signed photographs of athletes from Mastro and claimed that the catalog incorrectly described them as all being in color and 8&quot; x 10&quot; in size. Daniels also claimed that some of the autographs on the photographs may have been fakes. He produced two dealers who he said were autograph experts, but Superior Court Judge Matthew C. Kincaid excluded their testimony saying that neither Steve Koschal nor Richard Simon &quot;possess sufficient skill, knowledge or experience in the fields in which they were asked to render opinions.&quot; The law for each state is different regarding qualifications to testify. Simon and Koschal have both testified in states where their testimony is accepted in court.

===Other authenticity issues===

Forgers buy real American Revolutionary War-era documents and surreptitiously pen a famous patriot&#x27;s name between other real signatures in a manuscript in hope of deceiving an unsuspecting buyer. Others will use tea or tobacco stains to brown or age their modern missives.

Many autographed items of famous American sports players being sold over the Internet are fakes. Baseball legend Babe Ruth, for instance, has had his signature forged on old baseballs, then rubbed in dirt to make them appear to be from the 1930s.

===British royal family===
The British royal family is strictly forbidden from signing autographs because of the risk of the autographs being forged by others for use for their commercial gain. British royal family autographs, however, do exist, both from past royals and current ones, such as two 2010 examples when both (the then Prince) Charles and Prince Harry signed autographs to one person each.

==Copyright status of signatures==
Under British law, the appearance of signatures (not the names themselves) may be protected under copyright law.

Under United States Copyright Law, &quot;titles, names [I c...]; mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring&quot; are not eligible for copyright; however, the appearance of signatures (not the names themselves) may be protected under copyright law.

==Autograph collecting during the COVID-19 pandemic==
The COVID-19 pandemic saw normal interactions between people change in many human interacting areas, including autograph collecting. Several Major League Baseball teams, for example, employed a new strategy in which their players would sign team assigned items before their games and then have a team employee handle them to fans present near the stadium, to prevent the virus from spreading further on the communities they play at.

American Football&#x27;s National Football League, on the other hand, banned all autograph signings during their games, as part of their new fans and players&#x27; safety protocol rules.

<doc id="175357" wikidata="Q935129" url="?curid=175357" title="Postpartum depression">
<text>Postpartum depression (PPD), also called perinatal depression, is a mood disorder which may be experienced by pregnant or postpartum individuals. Symptoms include extreme sadness, low energy, anxiety, crying episodes, irritability, and changes in sleeping or eating patterns. PPD can also negatively affect the newborn child.
The exact cause of PPD is unclear, however, it is believed to be due to a combination of physical, emotional, genetic, and social factors such as hormone imbalances and sleep deprivation. Risk factors include prior episodes of postpartum depression, bipolar disorder, a family history of depression, psychological stress, complications of childbirth, lack of support, or a drug use disorder. Diagnosis is based on a person&#x27;s symptoms. While most women experience a brief period of worry or unhappiness after delivery, postpartum depression should be suspected when symptoms are severe and last over two weeks.
Among those at risk, providing psychosocial support may be protective in preventing PPD. This may include community support such as food, household chores, mother care, and companionship. Treatment for PPD may include counseling or medications. Types of counseling that are effective include interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and psychodynamic therapy. Tentative evidence supports the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
Depression occurs in roughly 10 to 20% of postpartum women. Postpartum depression commonly affects mothers who have experienced stillbirth, live in urban areas and adolescent mothers. Moreover, this mood disorder is estimated to affect 1% to 26% of new fathers. A different kind of postpartum mood disorder is Postpartum psychosis, which is more severe and occurs in about 1 to 2 per 1,000 women following childbirth. Postpartum psychosis is one of the leading causes of the murder of children less than one year of age, which occurs in about 8 per 100,000 births in the United States.
== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of PPD can occur at any time in the first year postpartum. Typically, a diagnosis of postpartum depression is considered after signs and symptoms persist for at least two weeks.

=== Emotional ===
* Persistent sadness, anxiousness, or &quot;empty&quot; mood
* Severe mood swings
* Frustration, irritability, restlessness, anger
* Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness
* Guilt, shame, worthlessness
* Low self-esteem
* Numbness, emptiness
* Exhaustion
* Inability to be comforted
* Trouble bonding with the baby
* Feeling inadequate in taking care of the baby
* Thoughts of self-harm or suicide

=== Behavioral ===
* Lack of interest or pleasure in usual activities
* Low libido
* Changes in appetite
* Fatigue, decreased energy and motivation
* Poor self-care
* Social withdrawal
* Insomnia or excessive sleep
* Worry about harming self, baby, or partner

=== Neurobiology ===
fMRI studies indicate differences in brain activity between mothers with postpartum depression and those without. Mothers diagnosed with PPD tend to have less activity in the left frontal lobe and increased activity in the right frontal lobe when compared with healthy controls. They also exhibit decreased connectivity between vital brain structures, including the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. Brain activation differences between depressed and nondepressed mothers are more pronounced when stimulated by non-infant emotional cues. Depressed mothers show greater neural activity in the right amygdala toward non-infant emotional cues as well as reduced connectivity between the amygdala and right insular cortex. Recent findings have also identified blunted activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and insula in mothers with PPD when viewing images of their infants.

More robust studies on neural activation regarding PPD have been conducted with rodents than humans. These studies have allowed for greater isolation of specific brain regions, neurotransmitters, hormones, and steroids.

==Onset and duration ==
Postpartum depression onset usually begins between two weeks to a month after delivery. A study done at an inner-city mental health clinic has shown that 50% of postpartum depressive episodes began before delivery. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) PPD is not recognized as a distinct condition but rather a specific type of a major depressive episode. In the DSM-5, the specifier &quot;with peripartum onset&quot; can be applied to a major depressive episode if the onset occurred either during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery. The prevalence of postpartum depression differs across different months after childbirth. Studies done on postpartum depression amongst women in the Middle East show that the prevalence in the first three months of postpartum was 31%, while the prevalence from the fourth to twelfth months of postpartum was 19%. PPD may last several months or even a year. 

==Consequences on maternal and child health==
Postpartum depression can interfere with normal maternal-infant bonding and adversely affect acute and long-term child development. Infants of mothers with PPD have higher incidences of excess crying, temperamental issues, and sleeping difficulties. Issues with sleeping in infants may exacerbate or be exacerbated by concurrent PPD in mothers. Maternal outcomes of PPD include withdrawal, disengagement, and hostility. Additional patterns observed in mothers with PPD include lower rates of initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding. 

Children and infants of PPD-affected mothers experience negative long-term impacts on their cognitive functioning, inhibitory control, and emotional regulation. In cases of untreated PPD, violent behaviors and psychiatric and medical conditions in adolescence have been observed. 

Suicide rates of women with PPD are lower than those outside of the perinatal period. Fetal or infant death in the first year postpartum has been associated with a higher risk of suicide attempt and higher inpatient psychiatric admissions. 

==Postpartum depression in fathers ==
Paternal postpartum depression is a poorly understood concept with a limited evidence-base. However, postpartum depression affects 8 to 10% of fathers. There are no set criteria for men to have postpartum depression. The cause may be distinct in males. Causes of paternal postpartum depression include hormonal changes during pregnancy, which can be indicative of father-child relationships. For instance, male depressive symptoms have been associated with low testosterone levels in men. Low prolactin, estrogen, and vasopressin levels have been associated with struggles with father-infant attachment, which can lead to depression in first-time fathers. Symptoms of postpartum depression in men are extreme sadness, fatigue, anxiety, irritability, and suicidal thoughts. Postpartum depression in men is most likely to occur 3–6 months after delivery and is correlated with maternal depression, meaning that if the mother is experiencing postpartum depression, then the father is at a higher risk of developing the illness as well. Postpartum depression in men leads to an increased risk of suicide, while also limiting healthy infant-father attachment. Men who experience PPD can exhibit poor parenting behaviors, and distress, and reduce infant interaction.

Reduced paternal interaction can later lead to cognitive and behavioral problems in children. Children as young as 3.5 years old may experience problems with internalizing and externalizing behaviors, indicating that paternal postpartum depression can have long-term consequences. Furthermore, if children as young as two are not frequently read to, this negative parent-child interaction can harm their expressive vocabulary. A study focusing on low-income fathers found that increased involvement in their child&#x27;s first year was linked to lower rates of postpartum depression.

==Adoptive parents==
Postpartum depression may also be experienced by non-biological parents. While not much research has been done regarding post-adoption depression, difficulties associated with parenting post-partum are similar between biological and adoptive parents. Women who adopt children undergo significant stress and life changes during the postpartum period, similar to biological mothers. This may raise their chance of developing depressive symptoms and anxious tendencies. Postpartum depression presents in adoptive mothers via sleep deprivation similar to birth mothers, but adoptive parents may have added risk factors such as a history of infertility.

==Issues for LGBTQ people==
Additionally, preliminary research has shown that childbearing individuals who are part of the LGBTQ community may be more susceptible to prenatal depression and anxiety than cisgender and heterosexual people.

According to two other studies, LGBTQ people were discouraged from accessing postpartum mental health services due to societal stigma adding a social barrier that heteronormative mothers do not have. Lesbian participants expressed apprehension about receiving a mental health diagnosis because of worries about social stigma and employment opportunities. Concerns were also raised about possible child removal and a parent&#x27;s diagnosis including mental illness. From the studies conducted thus far, although limited, it is evident that there is a much larger population that experiences depression associated with childbirth than just biological mothers.

==Causes==
The cause of PPD is unknown. Hormonal and physical changes, personal and family history of depression, and the stress of caring for a new baby all may contribute to the development of postpartum depression.

Evidence suggests that hormonal changes may play a role. Understanding the neuroendocrinology characteristic of PPD has proven to be particularly challenging given the erratic changes to the brain and biological systems during pregnancy and postpartum. A review of exploratory studies in PPD has observed that women with PPD have more dramatic changes in HPA axis activity, however, the directionality of specific hormone increases or decreases remain mixed. Hormones that have been studied include estrogen, progesterone, thyroid hormone, testosterone, corticotropin releasing hormone, endorphins, and cortisol. Estrogen and progesterone levels drop back to pre-pregnancy levels within 24 hours of giving birth, and that sudden change may cause it. Aberrant steroid hormone-dependent regulation of neuronal calcium influx via extracellular matrix proteins and membrane receptors involved in responding to the cell&#x27;s microenvironment might be important in conferring biological risk. The use of synthetic oxytocin, a birth-inducing drug, has been linked to increased rates of postpartum depression and anxiety.

Estradiol, which helps the uterus thicken and grow, is thought to contribute to the development of PPD. This is due to its relationship with serotonin. Estradiol levels increase during pregnancy, then drastically decrease following childbirth. When estradiol levels drop postpartum, the levels of serotonin decline as well. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood. Low serotonin levels cause feelings of depression and anxiety. Thus, when estradiol levels are low, serotonin can be low, suggesting that estradiol plays a role in the development of PPD.

Profound lifestyle changes that are brought about by caring for the infant are also frequently hypothesized to cause PPD. However, little evidence supports this hypothesis. Mothers who have had several previous children without experiencing PPD can nonetheless experience it with their latest child. Despite the biological and psychosocial changes that may accompany pregnancy and the postpartum period, most women are not diagnosed with PPD. Many mothers are unable to get the rest they need to fully recover from giving birth. Sleep deprivation can lead to physical discomfort and exhaustion, which can contribute to the symptoms of postpartum depression.

=== Risk factors ===
While the causes of PPD are not understood, several factors have been suggested to increase the risk. These risks can be broken down into two categories, biological and psychosocial:

==== Biological ====

* Administration of labor-inducing medication synthetic oxytocin
* Chronic illnesses caused by neuroendocrine irregularities
* Genetic history of PPD
* Hormone irregularities
* Inflammatory illnesses (irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia)
* Cigarette smoking
* Gut microbiome

The risk factors for postpartum depression can be broken down into two categories as listed above, biological and psychosocial. Certain biological risk factors include the administration of oxytocin to induce labor. Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, or Addison&#x27;s disease, as well as issues with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation (which controls hormonal responses), inflammatory processes like asthma or celiac disease, and genetic vulnerabilities such as a family history of depression or PPD. Chronic illnesses caused by neuroendocrine irregularities including irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia typically put individuals at risk for further health complications. However, it has been found that these diseases do not increase the risk for postpartum depression, these factors are known to correlate with PPD. This correlation does not mean these factors are causal. Cigarette smoking has been known to have additive effects. Some studies have found a link between PPD and low levels of DHA (an omega-3 fatty acid) in the mother. A correlation between postpartum thyroiditis and postpartum depression has been proposed but remains controversial. There may also be a link between postpartum depression and anti-thyroid antibodies.

==== Psychosocial ====

* Prenatal depression or anxiety
* A personal or family history of depression
* Moderate to severe premenstrual symptoms
* Stressful life events experienced during pregnancy
* Postpartum blues
* Birth-related psychological trauma
* Birth-related physical trauma
* History of sexual abuse
* Childhood trauma
* Previous stillbirth or miscarriage
* Formula-feeding rather than breast-feeding
* Low self-esteem
* Childcare or life stress
* Low social support
* Poor marital relationship or single marital status
* Low socioeconomic status
* A lack of strong emotional support from spouse, partner, family, or friends
* Infant temperament problems/colic
* Unplanned/unwanted pregnancy
* Breastfeeding difficulties
* Maternal age, family food insecurity, and violence against women

The psychosocial risk factors for postpartum depression include severe life events, some forms of chronic strain, relationship quality, and support from partner and mother. There is a need for more research regarding the link between psychosocial risk factors and postpartum depression. Some psychosocial risk factors can be linked to the social determinants of health. Women with fewer resources indicate a higher level of postpartum depression and stress than those women with more resources, such as financial.

Rates of PPD have been shown to decrease as income increases. Women with fewer resources may be more likely to have an unintended or unwanted pregnancy, increasing the risk of PPD. Women with fewer resources may also include single mothers of low income. Single mothers of low income may have more limited access to resources while transitioning into motherhood. These women already have fewer spending options, and having a child may spread those options even further. Low-income women are frequently trapped in a cycle of poverty, unable to advance, affecting their ability to access and receive quality healthcare to diagnose and treat postpartum depression.

Studies in the US have also shown a correlation between a mother&#x27;s race and postpartum depression. African American mothers have been shown to have the highest risk of PPD at 25%, while Asian mothers had the lowest at 11.5%, after controlling for social factors such as age, income, education, marital status, and baby&#x27;s health. The PPD rates for First Nations, Caucasian, and Hispanic women fell in between.

Migration away from a cultural community of support can be a factor in PPD. Traditional cultures around the world prioritize organized support during postpartum care to ensure the mother&#x27;s mental and physical health, well-being, and recovery.

One of the strongest predictors of paternal PPD is having a partner who has PPD, with fathers developing PPD 50% of the time when their female partner has PPD.

Sexual orientation has also been studied as a risk factor for PPD. In a 2007 study conducted by Ross and colleagues, lesbian and bisexual mothers were tested for PPD and then compared with a heterosexual sample group. It was found that lesbian and bisexual biological mothers had significantly higher Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores than the heterosexual women in the sample. Postpartum depression is more common among lesbian women than heterosexual women, which can be attributed to lesbian women&#x27;s higher depression prevalence. Lesbian women have a higher risk of depression because they are more likely to have been treated for depression and to have attempted or contemplated suicide than heterosexual women. These higher rates of PPD in lesbian/bisexual mothers may reflect less social support, particularly from their families of origin, and additional stress due to homophobic discrimination in society.

Different risk variables linked to postpartum depression (PPD) among Arabic women emphasize regional influences.  Risk factors that have been identified include the gender of the infant and polygamy. According to three studies conducted in Egypt and one in Jordan, mothers of female babies had a two-to-four-fold increased risk of postpartum depression (PPD) compared to mothers of male babies. Four studies found that conflicts with the mother-in-law are associated with PPD, with risk ratios of 1.8 and 2.7.

Studies have also shown a correlation between postpartum depression in mothers living within areas of conflicts, crises, and wars in the Middle East. Studies in Qatar have found a correlation between lower education levels and higher PPD prevalence.

According to research done in Egypt and Lebanon, rural residential living is linked to an increased risk. It was found that rural Lebanese women who had Caesarean births had greater PPD rates. On the other hand, Lebanese women in urban areas showed an opposite pattern.

Research conducted in the Middle East has demonstrated a link between PPD risk and mothers who were not informed and who are not given due consideration when decisions are made during childbirth.

There is a call to integrate both a consideration of biological and psychosocial risk factors for PPD when treating and researching the illness.

===Violence===
A meta-analysis reviewing research on the association of violence and postpartum depression showed that violence against women increases the incidence of postpartum depression. About one-third of women throughout the world will experience physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives. Violence against women occurs in conflict, post-conflict, and non-conflict areas. The research reviewed only looked at violence experienced by women from male perpetrators. Studies from the Middle East suggest that individuals who have experienced family violence are 2.5 times more likely to develop PPD. Further, violence against women was defined as &quot;any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women&quot;. Psychological and cultural factors associated with increased incidence of postpartum depression include family history of depression, stressful life events during early puberty or pregnancy, anxiety or depression during pregnancy, and low social support. Violence against women is a chronic stressor, so depression may occur when someone is no longer able to respond to the violence.

==Diagnosis==

===Criteria===
Postpartum depression in the DSM-5 is known as &quot;depressive disorder with peripartum onset&quot;. Peripartum onset is defined as starting anytime during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery. There is no longer a distinction made between depressive episodes that occur during pregnancy or those that occur after delivery. Nevertheless, the majority of experts continue to diagnose postpartum depression as depression with onset anytime within the first year after delivery.

The criteria required for the diagnosis of postpartum depression are the same as those required to make a diagnosis of non-childbirth-related major depression or minor depression. The criteria include at least five of the following nine symptoms, within two weeks:
* Feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness, nearly every day, for most of the day, or the observation of a depressed mood made by others
* Loss of interest or pleasure in activities
* Weight loss or decreased appetite
* Changes in sleep patterns
* Feelings of restlessness
* Loss of energy
* Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
* Loss of concentration or increased indecisiveness
* Recurrent thoughts of death, with or without plans of suicide

===Differential diagnosis===

====Postpartum blues====

Postpartum blues, commonly known as &quot;baby blues,&quot; is a transient postpartum mood disorder characterized by milder depressive symptoms than postpartum depression. This type of depression can occur in up to 80% of all mothers following delivery. Symptoms typically resolve within two weeks. Symptoms lasting longer than two weeks are a sign of a more serious type of depression. Women who experience &quot;baby blues&quot; may have a higher risk of experiencing a more serious episode of depression later on.

====Psychosis====
Postpartum psychosis is not a formal diagnosis, but is widely used to describe a psychiatric emergency that appears to occur in about 1 in 1000 pregnancies, in which symptoms of high mood and racing thoughts (mania), depression, severe confusion, loss of inhibition, paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions begin suddenly in the first two weeks after delivery; the symptoms vary and can change quickly. It is different from postpartum depression and maternity blues. It may be a form of bipolar disorder. It is important not to confuse psychosis with other symptoms that may occur after delivery, such as delirium. Delirium typically includes a loss of awareness or inability to pay attention.

About half of women who experience postpartum psychosis have no risk factors; but a prior history of mental illness, especially bipolar disorder, a history of prior episodes of postpartum psychosis, or a family history put some at a higher risk.

Postpartum psychosis often requires hospitalization, where treatment is antipsychotic medications, mood stabilizers, and in cases of strong risk for suicide, electroconvulsive therapy.

The most severe symptoms last from 2 to 12 weeks, and recovery takes 6 months to a year. Women who have been hospitalized for a psychiatric condition immediately after delivery are at a much higher risk of suicide during the first year after delivery.

Childbirth-Related/Postpartum Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

Parents may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or suffer post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, following childbirth. While there has been debate in the medical community as to whether childbirth should be considered a traumatic event, the current consensus is childbirth can be a traumatic event. The DSM-IV and DSM-5 (standard classifications of mental disorders used by medical professionals) do not explicitly recognize childbirth-related PTSD, but both allow childbirth to be considered as a potential cause of PTSD. Childbirth-related PTSD is closely related to postpartum depression. Research indicates mothers who have childbirth-related PTSD also commonly have postpartum depression. Childbirth-related PTSD and postpartum depression have some common symptoms. Although both diagnoses overlap in their signs and symptoms, some symptoms specific to postpartum PTSD include being easily startled, recurring nightmares and flashbacks, avoiding the baby or anything that reminds one of birth, aggression, irritability, and panic attacks. Real or perceived trauma before, during, or after childbirth is a crucial element in diagnosing childbirth-related PTSD.

Currently, there are no widely recognized assessments that measure postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder in medical settings. Existing PTSD assessments (such as the DSM-IV) have been used to measure childbirth-related PTSD. Some surveys exist to measure childbirth-related PTSD specifically, however, these are not widely used outside of research settings.

Approximately 3-6% of mothers in the postpartum period have childbirth-related PTSD. The percentage of individuals with childbirth-related PTSD is approximately 15-18% in high-risk samples (women who experience severe birth complications, have a history of sexual/physical violence, or have other risk factors). Research has identified several factors that increase the chance of developing childbirth-related PTSD. These include a negative subjective experience of childbirth, maternal mental health (prenatal depression, perinatal anxiety, acute postpartum depression, and history of psychological problems), history of trauma, complications with delivery and baby (for example emergency cesarean section or NICU admittance), and a low level of social support.

Childbirth-related PTSD has several negative health effects. Research suggests that childbirth-related PTSD may negatively affect the emotional attachment between mother and child. However, maternal depression or other factors may also explain this negative effect. Childbirth-related PTSD in the postpartum period may also lead to issues with the child&#x27;s social-emotional development. Current research suggests childbirth-related PTSD results in lower breastfeeding rates and may prevent parents from breastfeeding for the desired amount of time.

==Screening==
Screening for postpartum depression is critical as up to 50% of cases go undiagnosed in the US, emphasizing the significance of comprehensive screening measures. In the US, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests healthcare providers consider depression screening for perinatal women. Additionally, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends pediatricians screen mothers for PPD at 1-month, 2-month, and 4-month visits. However, many providers do not consistently provide screening and appropriate follow-up. For example, in Canada, Alberta is the only province with universal PPD screening. This screening is carried out by Public Health nurses with the baby&#x27;s immunization schedule. In Sweden, Child Health Services offers a free program for new parents that includes screening mothers for PPD at 2 months postpartum. However, there are concerns about adherence to screening guidelines regarding maternal mental health.

The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, a standardized self-reported questionnaire, may be used to identify women who have postpartum depression. If the new mother scores 13 or more, she likely has PPD and further assessment should follow.

Healthcare providers may take a blood sample to test if another disorder is contributing to depression during the screening.

The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is used within the first week of the newborn being admitted. If mothers receive a score less than 12 they are told to be reassessed because of the depression testing protocol. It is also advised that mothers in the NICU get screened every four to six weeks as their infant remains in the neonatal intensive care unit. Mothers who score between twelve and nineteen on the EPDS are offered two types of support. The mothers are offered LV treatment provided by a nurse in the NICU and they can be referred to the mental health professional services. If a mother receives a three on item number ten of the EPDS they are immediately referred to the social work team as they may be suicidal.

It is critical to acknowledge the diversity of patient populations diagnosed with postpartum depression and how this may impact the reliability of the screening tools used. There are cultural differences in how patients express symptoms of postpartum depression; those in non-western countries exhibit more physical symptoms, whereas those in Western countries have more feelings of sadness. Depending on one&#x27;s cultural background, symptoms of postpartum depression may manifest differently, and non-Westerners being screened in Western countries may be misdiagnosed because their screening tools do not account for cultural diversity. Aside from culture, it is also important to consider one&#x27;s social context, as women with low socioeconomic status may have additional stressors that affect their postpartum depression screening scores.

==Prevention==
A 2013 Cochrane review found evidence that psychosocial or psychological intervention after childbirth helped reduce the risk of postnatal depression. These interventions included home visits, telephone-based peer support, and interpersonal psychotherapy. Support is an important aspect of prevention, as depressed mothers commonly state that their feelings of depression were brought on by &quot;lack of support&quot; and &quot;feeling isolated.&quot;

Across different cultures, traditional rituals for postpartum care may be preventative for PPD but are more effective when the support is welcomed by the mother.

In couples, emotional closeness and global support by the partner protect against both perinatal depression and anxiety. In 2014, Alasoom and Koura found that compared to 42.9 percent of women who did not get spousal support, only 14.7 percent of women who got spousal assistance had PPD. Further factors such as communication between the couple and relationship satisfaction have a protective effect against anxiety alone.

In those who are at risk counseling is recommended. The US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) conducted a review of evidence which supported the use of counseling interventions such as therapy for the prevention of PPD in high-risk groups. Women who are considered to be high-risk include those with a past or present history of depression, or with certain socioeconomic factors such as low income or young age.

Preventative treatment with antidepressants may be considered for those who have had PPD previously. However, as of 2017, the evidence supporting such use is weak.

Community perinatal mental health teams were launched in England in 2016 to improve access to mental healthcare for pregnant women. They aim to prevent and treat episodes of mental illness during pregnancy and after birth. Researchers found that in areas of the country where teams were available, women who had previous contact with psychiatric services (many of whom had a previous diagnosis of anxiety or depression) were more likely to access mental health support and had a lower risk of relapse requiring hospital admission in the year after giving birth.

==Treatments==
Treatment for mild to moderate PPD includes psychological interventions or antidepressants. Women with moderate to severe PPD would likely experience a greater benefit with a combination of psychological and medical interventions. Light aerobic exercise is useful for mild and moderate cases.

=== Therapy ===
Both individual social and psychological interventions appear equally effective in the treatment of PPD. Social interventions include individual counseling and peer support, while psychological interventions include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT). Support groups and group therapy options focused on psychoeducation around postpartum depression have been shown to enhance the understanding of postpartum symptoms and often assist in finding further treatment options. Other forms of therapy, such as group therapy, home visits, counseling, and ensuring greater sleep for the mother may also have a benefit. While specialists trained in providing counseling interventions often serve this population in need, results from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that nonspecialist providers, including lay counselors, nurses, midwives, and teachers without formal training in counseling interventions, often provide effective services related to perinatal depression and anxiety.

=== Psychotherapy ===
Psychotherapy is the use of psychological methods, particularly when based on regular personal interaction, to help a person change behavior, increase happiness, and overcome problems. Psychotherapy can be super beneficial for mothers or fathers that are dealing with PPD. It allows individuals to talk with someone, maybe even someone who specializes in working with people who are dealing with PPD, and share their emotions and feelings to get help to become more emotionally stable. Psychotherapy proves to show efficacy of psychodynamic interventions for postpartum depression, both in home and clinical settings and both in group and individual format.

=== Cognitive behavioral therapy ===
Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown promising results with lower negative parenting behavior scores and lower rates of anxiety, stress, and depression. CBT  may be beneficial for mothers who have limitations in accessing in-person CBT. However, the long-term benefits have not been determined. The implementation of cognitive behavioral therapy happens to be one of the most successful and well-known forms of therapy regarding PPD. In simple terms, cognitive behavioral therapy is a psycho-social intervention that aims to reduce symptoms of various mental health conditions, primarily depression and anxiety disorders. While being a wide branch of therapy, it remains very beneficial when tackling specific emotional distress, which is the foundation of PPD. Thus, CBT manages to further reduce or limit the frequency and intensity of emotional outbreaks in the mothers or fathers.

=== Interpersonal therapy ===
Interpersonal therapy (IPT) has shown to be effective in focusing specifically on the mother and infant bond. Psychosocial interventions are effective for the treatment of postpartum depression. Interpersonal therapy otherwise known as IPT is a wonderfully intuitive fit for many women with PPD as they typically experience a multitude of biopsychosocial stressors that are associated with their depression, including several disrupted interpersonal relationships.

===Medication===
A 2010 review found few studies of medications for treating PPD noting small sample sizes and generally weak evidence. Some evidence suggests that mothers with PPD will respond similarly to people with major depressive disorder. There is low-certainty evidence which suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are an effective treatment for PPD. The first-line anti-depressant medication of choice is sertraline, an SSRI, as very little of it passes into the breast milk and, as a result, to the child. However, a recent study has found that adding sertraline to psychotherapy does not appear to confer any additional benefit. Therefore, it is not completely clear which antidepressants, if any, are most effective for the treatment of PPD, and for whom antidepressants would be a better option than non-pharmacotherapy.

Some studies show that hormone therapy may be effective in women with PPD, supported by the idea that the drop in estrogen and progesterone levels post-delivery contributes to depressive symptoms. However, there is some controversy with this form of treatment because estrogen should not be given to people who are at higher risk of blood clots, which include women up to 12 weeks after delivery. Additionally, none of the existing studies included women who were breastfeeding. However, there is some evidence that the use of estradiol patches might help with PPD symptoms.

Oxytocin is an effective anxiolytic and in some cases antidepressant treatment in men and women. Exogenous oxytocin has only been explored as a PPD treatment with rodents, but results are encouraging for potential application in humans.

In 2019, the FDA approved brexanolone, a synthetic analog of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, for use intravenously in postpartum depression. Allopregnanolone levels drop after giving birth, which may lead to women becoming depressed and anxious. Some trials have demonstrated an effect on PPD within 48 hours from the start of infusion. Other new allopregnanolone analogs under evaluation for use in the treatment of PPD include zuranolone and ganaxolone.

Brexanolone has risks that can occur during administration, including excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness, and therefore has been approved under the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program. The mother is to be enrolled before receiving the medication. It is only available to those at certified healthcare facilities with a healthcare provider who can continually monitor the patient. The infusion itself is a 60-hour, or 2.5-day, process. People&#x27;s oxygen levels are to be monitored with a pulse oximeter. Side effects of the medication include dry mouth, sleepiness, somnolence, flushing, and loss of consciousness. It is also important to monitor for early signs of suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

In 2023, the FDA approved zuranolone, sold under the brand name Zurzuvae for treatment of postpartum depression. Zuranolone is administered through a pill, which is more convenient than brexanolone, which is administered through an intravenous injection.

=== Breastfeeding ===
The use of SSRIs for the treatment of PPD is not a contraindication for breastfeeding. While antidepressants are excreted in breastmilk, the concentrations recorded in breastmilk are very low. Extensive research has shown that the use of SSRI&#x27;s by women who are lactating is safe for the breastfeeding infant/child. Regarding allopregnanolone, very limited data did not indicate a risk for the infant.

===Other===
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has shown efficacy in women with severe PPD who have either failed multiple trials of medication-based treatment or cannot tolerate the available antidepressants. Tentative evidence supports the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).

As of 2013, it is unclear if acupuncture, massage, bright lights, or taking omega-3 fatty acids are useful.
== Resources ==

=== International ===
Postpartum Support International is the most recognized international resource for those with PPD as well as healthcare providers. It brings together those experiencing PPD, volunteers, and professionals to share information, referrals, and support networks. Services offered by PSI include the website (with support, education, and local resource info), coordinators for support and local resources, online weekly video support groups in English and Spanish, free weekly phone conferences with chats with experts, educational videos, closed Facebook groups for support, and professional training of healthcare workers.

=== United States ===

==== Educational interventions ====
Educational interventions can help women struggling with postpartum depression (PPD) to cultivate coping strategies and develop resiliency. The phenomenon of &quot;scientific motherhood&quot; represents the origin of women&#x27;s education on perinatal care with publications like &quot;Ms&quot;. circulating some of the first press articles on PPD that helped to normalize the symptoms that women experienced. Feminist writings on PPD from the early seventies shed light on the darker realities of motherhood and amplified the lived experiences of mothers with PPD.

Instructional videos have been popular among women who turn to the internet for PPD treatment, especially when the videos are interactive and get patients involved in their treatment plans. Since the early 2000s, video tutorials on PPD have been integrated into many web-based training programs for individuals with PPD and are often considered a type of evidence-based management strategy for individuals. This can take the form of objective-based learning, detailed exploration of case studies, resource guides for additional support and information, etc.

==== Government-funded programs ====
The National Child and Maternal Health Education Program functions as a larger education and outreach program supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the National Institute of Health. The NICHD has worked alongside organizations like the World Health Organization to conduct research on the psychosocial development of children with part of their efforts going towards the support of mothers&#x27; health and safety. Training and education services are offered through the NICHD to equip women and their healthcare providers with evidence-based knowledge of PPD.

Other initiatives include the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) whose disaster relief program provides medical assistance at both the national and local level. The disaster relief fund not only helps to raise awareness of the benefits of having healthcare professionals screen for PPD but also helps childhood professionals (home visitors and early care providers) develop the skills to diagnose and prevent PPD. The Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation (IECMH) center is a related technical assistance program that utilizes evidence-based treatment services to address issues of PPD. The IECMH facilitates parenting and home visit programs, early care site interventions with parents and children, and a variety of other consultation-based services. The IECMH&#x27;s initiatives seek to educate home visitors on screening protocols for PPD as well as ways to refer depressed mothers to professional help.

==== Psychotherapy ====
Therapeutic methods of intervention can begin as early as a few days post-birth when most mothers are discharged from hospitals. Research surveys have revealed a paucity of professional, and emotional support for women struggling in the weeks following delivery despite there being a heightened risk for PPD for new mothers during this transitional period.

==== Community-based support ====
A lack of social support has been identified as a barrier to seeking help for postpartum depression. Peer support programs have been identified as an effective intervention for women experiencing symptoms of postpartum depression. In-person, online, and telephone support groups are available to both women and men throughout the United States. Peer support models are appealing to many women because they are offered in a group and outside of the mental health setting. The website Postpartum Progress provides a comprehensive list of support groups separated by state and includes the contact information for each group. The National Alliance on Mental Illness lists a virtual support group titled &quot;The Shades of Blue Project,&quot; which is available to all women via the submission of a name and email address. Additionally, NAMI recommends the website &quot;National Association of Professional and Peer Lactation Supports of Color&quot; for mothers in need of a lactation supporter. Lactation assistance is available either online or in-person if there is support nearby.

==== Personal narratives &amp; memoirs ====
Postpartum Progress is a blog focused on being a community of mothers talking openly about postpartum depression and other mental health conditions associated. Story-telling and online communities reduce the stigma around PPD and promote peer-based care. Postpartum Progress is specifically relevant to people of color and queer folks due to an emphasis on cultural competency.

==== Hotlines &amp; telephone interviews ====
Hotlines, chat lines, and telephone interviews offer immediate, emergency support for those experiencing PPD. Telephone-based peer support can be effective in the prevention and treatment of postpartum depression among women at high risk. Established examples of telephone hotlines include the National Alliance on Mental Illness: 800-950-NAMI (6264), National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 800-273-TALK (8255), Postpartum Support International: 800-944-4PPD (4773), and SAMHSA&#x27;s National Hotline: 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Postpartum Health Alliance has an immediate, 24/7 support line in San Diego/San Diego Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724–7240, in which you can talk with mothers who have recovered from PPD and trained providers.

However, hotlines can lack cultural competency which is crucial in quality healthcare, specifically for people of color. Calling the police or 911, specifically for mental health crises, is dangerous for many people of color. Culturally and structurally competent emergency hotlines are a huge need in PPD care.

* National Alliance on Mental Illness: 800-950-NAMI (6264)

* Postpartum Support International: 800-944-4PPD (4773)
* SAMHSA&#x27;s National Hotline: 1-800-662-HELP (4357)

==== Self-care &amp; well-being activities ====
Women demonstrated an interest in self-care and well-being in an online PPD prevention program. Self-care activities, specifically music therapy, are accessible to most communities and valued among women as a way to connect with their children and manage symptoms of depression. Well-being activities associated with being outdoors, including walking and running, were noted amongst women as a way to help manage mood.

=== Accessibility to care ===
Those with PPD come across many help-seeking barriers, including lack of knowledge, stigma about symptoms, as well as health service barriers. There are also attitudinal barriers to seeking treatment, including stigma. Interpersonal relationships with friends and family, as well as institutional and financial obstacles, serve as help-seeking barriers. A history of mistrust within the United States healthcare system or negative health experiences can influence one&#x27;s willingness and adherence to seek postpartum depression treatment. Cultural responses must be adequate in PPD healthcare and resources. Representation and cultural competency are crucial to equitable healthcare for PPD. Different ethnic groups may believe that healthcare providers will not respect their cultural values or religious practices, which influences their willingness to use mental health services or be prescribed antidepressant medications. Additionally, resources for PPD are limited and often don&#x27;t incorporate what mothers would prefer. The use of technology can be a beneficial way to provide mothers with resources because it is accessible and convenient.

==Epidemiology==

=== North America ===
==== United States ====

Within the United States, the prevalence of postpartum depression was lower than the global approximation at 11.5% but varied between states from as low as 8% to as high as 20.1%. The highest prevalence in the US is found among women who are American Indian/Alaska Natives or Asian/Pacific Islanders, possess less than 12 years of education, are unmarried, smoke during pregnancy, experience over two stressful life events, or have full-term infant is low-birthweight or was admitted to a NICU. While US prevalence decreased from 2004 to 2012, it did not decrease among American Indian/Alaska Native women or those with full term, low-birthweight infants.

Even with the variety of studies, it is difficult to find the exact rate as approximately 60% of US women are not diagnosed and of those diagnosed, approximately 50% are not treated for PPD. Cesarean section rates did not affect the rates of PPD. While there is discussion of postpartum depression in fathers, there is no formal diagnosis for postpartum depression in fathers.

==== Canada ====
Canada has one of the largest refugee resettlement in the world with an equal percentage of women to men. This means that Canada has a disproportionate percentage of women who develop postpartum depression since there is an increased risk among the refugee population. In a blind study, where women had to reach out and participate, around 27% of the sample population had symptoms consistent with postpartum depression without even knowing. Also found that on average 8.46 women had minor and major PPDS was found to be 8.46 and 8.69% respectively. The main factors that were found to contribute to this study were the stress during pregnancy, the availability of support after, and a prior diagnosis of depression were all found to be factors. Canada has specific population demographics that also involve a large amount of immigrant and indigenous women which creates a specific cultural demographic localized to Canada. In this study, researchers found that these two populations were at significantly higher risk compared to &quot;Canadian-born non-indigenous mothers&quot;. This study found that risk factors such as low education, low-income cut-off, taking antidepressants, and low social support are all factors that contribute to the higher percentage of these populations developing PPDS. Specifically, indigenous mothers had the most risk factors than immigrant mothers with non-indigenous Canadian women being closer to the overall population.

=== South America ===
A main issue surrounding PPD is the lack of study and the lack of reported prevalence that is based on studies developed in Western economically developed countries. In countries such as Brazil, Guyana, Costa Rica, Italy, Chile, and South Africa reports are prevalent, around 60%. An itemized research analysis put a mean prevalence at 10-15% percent but explicitly stated that cultural factors such as perception of mental health and stigma could be preventing accurate reporting. The analysis for South America shows that PPD occurs at a high rate looking comparatively at Brazil (42%) Chile (4.6-48%) Guyana and Colombia (57%) and Venezuela (22%). In most of these countries, PPD is not considered a serious condition for women and therefore there is an absence of support programs for prevention and treatment in health systems. Specifically, in Brazil PPD is identified through the family environment whereas in Chile PPD manifests itself through suicidal ideation and emotional instability. In both cases, most women feel regret and refuse to take care of the child showing that this illness is serious for both the mother and child.

=== Asia ===
From a selected group of studies found from a literature search, researchers discovered many demographic factors of Asian populations that showed significant association with PPD. Some of these include the age of the mother at the time of childbirth as well as the older age at marriage. Being a migrant and giving birth to a child overseas has also been identified as a risk factor for PPD. Specifically for Japanese women who were born and raised in Japan but who gave birth to their child in Hawaii, USA, about 50% of them experienced emotional dysfunction during their pregnancy. All women who gave birth for the first time and were included in the study experienced PPD. In immigrant Asian Indian women, the researchers found a minor depressive symptomatology rate of 28% and an additional major depressive symptomatology rate of 24% likely due to different healthcare attitudes in different cultures and distance from family leading to homesickness.

In the context of Asian countries, premarital pregnancy is an important risk factor for PPD. This is because it is considered highly unacceptable in most Asian cultures as there is a highly conservative attitude toward sex among Asian people than people in the West. In addition, conflicts between mother and daughter-in-law are notoriously common in Asian societies as traditionally for them, marriage means the daughter-in-law joining and adjusting to the groom&#x27;s family completely. These conflicts may be responsible for the emergence of PPD. Regarding the gender of the child, many studies have suggested dissatisfaction with an infant&#x27;s gender (birth of a baby girl) is a risk factor for PPD. This is because, in some Asian cultures, married couples are expected by the family to have at least one son to maintain the continuity of the bloodline which might lead a woman to experience PPD if she cannot give birth to a baby boy.

==== The Middle East ====

With a prevalence of 27%, postpartum depression amongst mothers in the Middle East is higher than in the Western world and other regions of the world. Despite the high number of postpartum depression cases in the region in comparison to other areas, there is a large literature gap in correlation with the Arab region, and no studies have been conducted in the Middle East studying interventions and prevention to tackle postpartum depression in Arab mothers. Countries within the Arab region had a postpartum depression prevalence ranging from 10% to 40%, with a PPD prevalence in Qatar at 18.6%, UAE between 18% and 24%, Jordan between 21.2 and 22.1, Lebanon at 21%, Saudi Arabia between 10.1 and 10.3, and Tunisia between 13.2% and 19.2%, according to studies carried out in these countries.

There are also examples of nations with noticeably higher rates, such as Iran at 40.2%, Bahrain at 37.1%, and Turkey at 27%. The high prevalence of postpartum depression in the region may be attributed to socio-economic and cultural factors involving social and partner support, poverty, and prevailing societal views on pregnancy and motherhood. Another factor is related to the region&#x27;s women&#x27;s lack of access to care services because many societies within the region do not prioritize mental health and do not perceive it as a serious issue. The prevailing crises and wars within some countries of the region, lack of education, polygamy, and early childbearing are additional factors. Fertility rates in Palestine are noticeably high; higher fertility rates have been connected to a possible pattern where birth rates increase after violent episodes. Research conducted on Arab women indicates that more cases of postpartum depression are associated with increased parity. A study found that the most common pregnancy and birth variable reported to be associated with PPD in the Middle East was an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy while having a female baby instead of a male baby is also discussed as a factor with 2 to 4 times higher risk.

=== Europe ===
There is a general assumption that Western cultures are homogenous and that there are no significant differences in psychiatric disorders across Europe and the USA. However, in reality, factors associated with maternal depression, including work and environmental demands, access to universal maternity leave, healthcare, and financial security, are regulated and influenced by local policies that differ across countries. For example, European social policies differ from country to country contrary to the US, all countries provide some form of paid universal maternity leave and free healthcare. Studies also found differences in symptomatic manifestations of PPD between European and American women. Women from Europe reported higher scores of anhedonia, self-blaming, and anxiety, while women from the US disclosed more severe insomnia, depressive feelings, and thoughts of self-harming. Additionally, there are differences in prescribing patterns and attitudes towards certain medications between the US and Europe which are indicative of how different countries approach treatment, and their different stigmas.

=== Africa ===
Africa, like all other parts of the world, struggles with the burden of postpartum depression. Current studies estimate the prevalence to be 15-25% but this is likely higher due to a lack of data and recorded cases. The magnitude of postpartum depression in South Africa is between 31.7% and 39.6%, in Morocco between 6.9% and 14%, in Nigeria between 10.7% and 22.9%, in Uganda 43%, in Tanzania 12%, in Zimbabwe 33%, in Sudan 9.2%, in Kenya between 13% and 18.7% and, 19.9% for participants in Ethiopia according to studies carried out in these countries among postpartum mothers between the ages of 17–49. This demonstrates the gravity of this problem in Africa and the need for postpartum depression to be taken seriously as a public health concern in the continent. Additionally, each of these studies was conducted using Western-developed assessment tools. Cultural factors can affect diagnosis and can be a barrier to assessing the burden of disease. Some recommendations to combat postpartum depression in Africa include considering postpartum depression as a public health problem that is neglected among postpartum mothers. Investing in research to assess the actual prevalence of postpartum depression, and encourage early screening, diagnosis, and treatment of postpartum depression as an essential aspect of maternal care throughout Africa.

=== Issues in reporting prevalence ===

Most studies regarding PPD are done using self-report screenings which are less reliable than clinical interviews. This use of self-reporting may have results that underreport symptoms and thus postpartum depression rates.

Furthermore, the prevalence of postpartum depression in Arab countries exhibits significant variability, often due to diverse assessment methodologies. In a review of twenty-five studies examining PPD, differences in assessment methods, recruitment locations, and timing of evaluations complicate prevalence measurement. For instance, the studies varied in their approach, with some using a longitudinal panel method tracking PPD at multiple points during pregnancy and postpartum periods, while others employed cross-sectional approaches to estimate point or period prevalences. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was commonly used across these studies, yet variations in cutoff scores further determined the results of prevalence.

For example, a study in Kom Ombo, Egypt, reported a rate of 73.7% for PPD, but the small sample size of 57 mothers and the broad measurement timeframe spanning from two weeks to one year postpartum contributes to the challenge of making definitive prevalence conclusions (2). This wide array of assessment methods and timing significantly impacts the reported rates of postpartum depression.

== History ==

=== Prior to the 19th century ===
Western medical science&#x27;s understanding and construction of postpartum depression have evolved over the centuries. Ideas surrounding women&#x27;s moods and states have been around for a long time, typically recorded by men. In 460 B.C., Hippocrates wrote about puerperal fever, agitation, delirium, and mania experienced by women after childbirth. Hippocrates&#x27; ideas still linger in how postpartum depression is seen today.

A woman who lived in the 14th century, Margery Kempe, was a Christian mystic. She was a pilgrim known as &quot;Madwoman&quot; after having a tough labor and delivery. There was a long physical recovery period during which she started descending into &quot;madness&quot; and became suicidal. Based on her descriptions of visions of demons and conversations she wrote about that she had with religious figures like God and the Virgin Mary, historians have identified what Margery Kempe was experiencing as &quot;postnatal psychosis&quot; and not postpartum depression. This distinction became important to emphasize the difference between postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis. A 16th-century physician, Castello Branco, documented a case of postpartum depression without the formal title as a relatively healthy woman with melancholy after childbirth, remained insane for a month, and recovered with treatment. Although this treatment was not described, experimental treatments began to be implemented for postpartum depression for the centuries that followed. Connections between female reproductive function and mental illness would continue to center around reproductive organs from this time through to the modern age, with a slowly evolving discussion around &quot;female madness&quot;.

=== 19th century and after ===
With the 19th century came a new attitude about the relationship between female mental illness and pregnancy, childbirth, or menstruation. The famous short story, &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;, was published by Charlotte Perkins Gilman in this period. In the story, an unnamed woman journals her life when she is treated by her physician husband, John, for hysterical and depressive tendencies after the birth of their baby. Gilman wrote the story to protest the societal oppression of women as the result of her own experience as a patient.

Also during the 19th century, gynecologists embraced the idea that female reproductive organs, and the natural processes they were involved in, were at fault for &quot;female insanity.&quot; Approximately 10% of asylum admissions during this period are connected to &quot;puerperal insanity,&quot; the named intersection between pregnancy or childbirth and female mental illness. It wasn&#x27;t until the onset of the twentieth century that the attitude of the scientific community shifted once again: the consensus amongst gynecologists and other medical experts was to turn away from the idea of diseased reproductive organs and instead towards more &quot;scientific theories&quot; that encompassed a broadening medical perspective on mental illness.

==Society and culture==
=== Legal recognition ===
Recently, postpartum depression has become more widely recognized in society. In the US, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act included a section focusing on research into postpartum conditions including postpartum depression. Some argue that more resources in the form of policies, programs, and health objectives need to be directed to the care of those with PPD.

=== Role of stigma ===
When stigma occurs, a person is labeled by their illness and viewed as part of a stereotyped group. There are three main elements of stigmas, 1) problems of knowledge (ignorance or misinformation), 2) problems of attitudes (prejudice), and 3) problems of behavior (discrimination). Specifically regarding PPD, it is often left untreated as women frequently report feeling ashamed about seeking help and are concerned about being labeled as a &quot;bad mother&quot; if they acknowledge that they are experiencing depression. Although there has been previous research interest in depression-related stigma, few studies have addressed PPD stigma. One study studied PPD stigma by examining how an education intervention would impact it. They hypothesized that an education intervention would significantly influence PPD stigma scores. Although they found some consistency with previous mental health stigma studies, for example, that males had higher levels of personal PPD stigma than females, most of the PPD results were inconsistent with other mental health studies. For example, they hypothesized that education intervention would lower PPD stigma scores, but in reality, there was no significant impact, and also familiarity with PPD was not associated with one&#x27;s stigma towards people with PPD. This study was a strong starting point for further PPD research but indicates more needs to be done to learn what the most effective anti-stigma strategies are specifically for PPD.

Postpartum depression is still linked to significant stigma. This can also be difficult when trying to determine the true prevalence of postpartum depression. Participants in studies about PPD carry their beliefs, perceptions, cultural context, and stigma of mental health in their cultures with them which can affect data. The stigma of mental health - with or without support from family members and health professionals - often deters women from seeking help for their PPD. When medical help is achieved, some women find the diagnosis helpful and encourage a higher profile for PPD amongst the health professional community.

=== Cultural beliefs ===
Postpartum depression can be influenced by sociocultural factors. There are many examples of particular cultures and societies that hold specific beliefs about PPD. Malay culture holds a belief in Hantu Meroyan; a spirit that resides in the placenta and amniotic fluid.

When this spirit is unsatisfied and venting resentment, it causes the mother to experience frequent crying, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping, known collectively as &quot;sakit meroyan&quot;. The mother can be cured with the help of a shaman, who performs a séance to force the spirits to leave.

Some cultures believe that the symptoms of postpartum depression or similar illnesses can be avoided through protective rituals in the period after birth. These may include offering structures of organized support, hygiene care, diet, rest, infant care, and breastfeeding instruction. The rituals appear to be most effective when the support is welcomed by the mother.

Some Chinese women participate in a ritual that is known as &quot;doing the month&quot; (confinement) in which they spend the first 30 days after giving birth resting in bed, while the mother or mother-in-law takes care of domestic duties and childcare. In addition, the new mother is not allowed to bathe or shower, wash her hair, clean her teeth, leave the house, or be blown by the wind.

The relationship with the mother-in-law has been identified as a significant risk factor for postpartum depression in many Arab regions. Based on cultural beliefs that place importance on mothers, mothers-in-law have significant influences on daughters-in-law and grandchildren&#x27;s lives in such societies as the husbands frequently have close relationships with their family of origin, including living together.

Furthermore, cultural factors influence how Middle Eastern women are screened for PPD. The traditional Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, or EPDS, has come under criticism for emphasizing depression symptoms that may not be consistent with Muslim cultural standards. Thoughts of self-harm are strictly prohibited in Islam, yet it is a major symptom within the EPDS. Words like &quot;depression screen&quot; or &quot;mental health&quot; are considered disrespectful to some Arab cultures. Furthermore, women may under report symptoms to put the needs of the family before their own because these countries have collectivist cultures.

Additionally, research showed that mothers of female babies had a considerably higher risk of PPD, ranging from 2-4 times higher than those of mothers of male babies, due to the value certain cultures in the Middle East place on female babies compared to male babies.

=== Media ===
Certain cases of postpartum mental health concerns received attention in the media and brought about dialogue on ways to address and understand more about postpartum mental health. Andrea Yates, a former nurse, became pregnant for the first time in 1993. After giving birth to five children in the coming years, she had severe depression and many depressive episodes. This led to her believing that her children needed to be saved and that by killing them, she could rescue their eternal souls. She drowned her children one by one over the course of an hour, by holding their heads underwater in their family bathtub. When called into trial, she felt that she had saved her children rather than harming them and that this action would contribute to defeating Satan.

This was one of the first public and notable cases of postpartum psychosis, which helped create a dialogue on women&#x27;s mental health after childbirth. The court found that Yates was experiencing mental illness concerns, and the trial started the conversation of mental illness in cases of murder and whether or not it would lessen the sentence or not. It also started a dialogue on women going against &quot;maternal instinct&quot; after childbirth and what maternal instinct was truly defined by.

Yates&#x27; case brought wide media attention to the problem of filicide, or the murder of children by their parents. Throughout history, both men and women have perpetrated this act, but the study of maternal filicide is more extensive.

==History==
Tournai, known as &quot;Tornacum&quot;, was a place of minor importance in Roman times, a stopping place where the Roman road from Cologne on the Rhine to Boulogne on the coast crossed the river Scheldt. It was fortified under Emperor Maximian in the 3rd century AD, when the Roman &quot;limes&quot; was withdrawn to the string of outposts along the road. It came into the possession of the Salian Franks in 432. Under King Childeric I, whose tomb was discovered there in 1653, Tournai was the capital of the Frankish Empire. In 486, Clovis moved the center of power to Paris. In turn, a native son of Tournai, Eleutherius, became bishop of the newly created bishopric of Tournai, extending over most of the area west of the Scheldt. In 862, Charles the Bald, first king of Western Francia and still to become Holy Roman Emperor, would make Tournai the seat of the County of Flanders.

After the partition of the Frankish Empire by the Treaties of Verdun (843) and of Meerssen (870), Tournai remained in the western part of the empire, which in 987 became France. The city participated in 11th-century rise of towns in the Low Countries, with a woollen cloth industry based on English wool, which soon made it attractive to wealthy merchants. An ambitious rebuilding of the cathedral was initiated in 1030. Odo of Orléans was appointed at the cathedral school of Tournai in 1087. Under Odo&#x27;s leadership, Saint-Martin Abbey flourished and by 1105 had 70 monks. The commune&#x27;s drive for independence from the local counts succeeded in 1187, and the city was henceforth directly subordinated to the French Crown, as the &quot;seigneurie de Tournaisis&quot;, as the city&#x27;s environs are called. The stone over the Scheldt, with defensive towers at either end, was built in 1290, replacing an earlier wooden structure.

In 1340, as a part of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Edward III of England gathered a large army and besieged Tournai for a month. The operation was unsuccessful, bankrupting Edward and forcing him to sign the Truce of Espléchin.

During the 15th century, the city&#x27;s textile trade boomed and it became an important supplier of tapestry. The art of painting flourished too: Jacques Daret, Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden all came from Tournai. It was captured in 1513 by Henry VIII of England, making it the only Belgian city ever to have been ruled by England. It was also represented in the 1515 Parliament of England. The city was handed back to French rule in 1519, following the Treaty of London (1518).

In 1521, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V added the city to his possessions in the Low Countries, leading to a period of religious strife and economic decline. During the 16th century, Tournai was a bulwark of Calvinism, but eventually it was conquered by the Spanish governor of the Low Countries, the Duke of Parma, following a prolonged siege in 1581. After the fall of the city, its Protestant inhabitants were given one year to sell their possessions and emigrate, a policy that was at the time considered relatively humane, since very often religious opponents were simply massacred.

One century later, in 1668, the city briefly returned to France under King Louis XIV in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle following the siege of Tournai. The city was besieged by the Duke of Marlborough during the War of Spanish Succession in 1709. At the end of the war in 1713, under terms of the Treaty of Utrecht the former Spanish Netherlands, including Tournai, came into possession of the Austrian Habsburgs. The city was again successfully besieged by France in 1745. In 1794, France annexed the Austrian Netherlands during the French Revolutionary Wars and Tournai became part of the department of Jemmape. From 1815 on, following the Napoleonic Wars, Tournai formed part of the United Netherlands and after 1830 of newly independent Belgium. Badly damaged in 1940 during World War II, Tournai has since been carefully restored.

==Main sights==
Tournai is considered to be one of the most important cultural sites in Belgium. The mixed Romanesque- and Gothic-style Cathedral of Our Lady and the city&#x27;s Belfry, considered the oldest in Belgium, have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. Inside the cathedral, the &quot;Châsse de Notre-Dame flamande&quot;, a beautifully ornate 12th-century reliquary, gives witness to Tournai&#x27;s wealth in the Middle Ages.

Other places of interest are the 13th-century Scheldt bridge (Pont des Trous) and the main square (Grand-Place), as well as several old city gates, historic warehouses, and a variety of museums. As in many Belgian cities, there are a number of cafés and pubs on the Grand-Place. In the middle of the square, there are a series of water fountains, while a circular staircase to the top of the Belfry can be climbed.

On the Rue Barre-St-Brice are two of the oldest private houses in Europe, dating from between 1175 and 1200 and built in the Romanesque style, while the Rue des Jésuites includes a Gothic house from the 13th century. There are also several buildings in the Art Nouveau style across the city.

==Culture==

===A French-speaking Walloon town===
Tournai is a French-speaking town of Belgium. The local language is &quot;tournaisien&quot;, a Picard dialect similar to that of other municipalities of Hainaut and Northern France. Tournai also belongs to Romance Flanders, like Lille, Douai, Tourcoing, and Mouscron. The city was one of the greatest cultural and economic centres of the County of Flanders. Some traces can still be seen today:
* The Gothic choir of Our Lady&#x27;s Cathedral is a precursory element of the Scaldian (meaning from the Scheldt area), typically Flemish, Gothic art.
* The Bishopric of Tournai was the religious capital of Flanders during more than a millennium (from 496 to 1559).
* The tapestries and draperies of Tournai belong to the great Flemish school of tapestry and Tournai was part of the Flemish Hansa of London, which also included the draper towns of Flanders.
* The Church of St. Brice, dedicated to Saint Britius, is one of the first examples of the &quot;hallekerk&quot; style, so typical of the Flemish countryside.
* The Church of St. Quentin, a Catholic parish church in Romanesque style with Gothic elements, known to have existed since the 10th century. The current building was built around 1200, but has been altered several times throughout history. It contains important sculptures by the 15th-century sculptor Jean Delemer.
* Some of the great Flemish Primitives are from Tournai: Robert Campin, Rogier van der Weyden, and Jacques Daret.

Although Tournai is in the Flemish cultural area (of the Scheldt), it also possesses some treasures of the Mosan style. Indeed, the two most beautiful shrines of the cathedral, commissioned by the Bishop of Tournai, were made in the region of Liège by the artist Nicholas of Verdun: the shrines of &quot;Saint-Eleutherius&quot; and of &quot;Our Lady of Flanders&quot; (13th century). Those shrines testify to the opulence of Tournai and Liège during the Middle Ages. The shrine of &quot;Our Lady of Flanders&quot; has been called one of the seven wonders of Belgium.

===Festivities===
* The &quot;Great Procession&quot; (in French: &quot;Grande Procession&quot;) is a procession initiated by the bishop Radbot II during a plague epidemic. It has taken place every year since 1092, with the single exception of the year 1566, when the iconoclasts considerably damaged the religious symbols of the city. This historic procession unfolds in the streets every second Sunday of September.
* The first Monday after January 6 is known as &quot;Lost Monday&quot; (in French: &quot;Lundi perdu&quot;) or &quot;Perjury Monday&quot; (&quot;Lundi parjuré&quot;). This tradition dates from more than 700 years ago. The wealthier city inhabitants used to prepare fastidious family dinners and elect a king. Today, the family dinners have expanded to wider groups and a rabbit dish is often served.

The Faculty of Architecture, Architectural Engineering and Urban Planning of the French-speaking University of Louvain (UCLouvain) is located in Tournai.

<doc id="175363" wikidata="Q16932520" url="?curid=175363" title="Declaration of Indulgence (1672)">
<text>The Declaration of Indulgence was Charles II of England&#x27;s attempt to extend religious liberty to Protestant nonconformists and Roman Catholics in his realms, by suspending the execution of the Penal Laws that punished recusants from the Church of England. Charles issued the Declaration on 15 March 1672.

It was highly controversial and Sir Orlando Bridgeman, son of a bishop, resigned as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, because he refused to apply the Great Seal to it, regarding it as too generous to Catholics.

In 1673 the Cavalier Parliament compelled Charles to withdraw the declaration and implement, in its place, the first of the Test Acts (1673), which required anyone entering public service in England to deny the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and to take Anglican communion. When Charles II&#x27;s openly Catholic successor James II attempted to issue a similar Declaration of Indulgence, an order for general religious tolerance, it became one of the grievances that led to the Glorious Revolution which ousted him from the throne.

<doc id="175366" wikidata="Q881154" url="?curid=175366" title="Douglas Wilder">
<text>Lawrence Douglas Wilder (born January 17, 1931) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 66th governor of Virginia from 1990 to 1994. He was the first African American to serve as governor of a U.S. state since the Reconstruction era, and the first African American ever elected as governor. He is currently a professor at the namesake Wilder School at Virginia Commonwealth University.

Born in Richmond, Virginia, Wilder graduated from Virginia Union University and served in the United States Army during the Korean War. He established a legal practice in Richmond after graduating from the Howard University School of Law. A member of the Democratic Party, Wilder won election to the Virginia Senate in 1969. He remained in that chamber until 1986, when he took office as the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, becoming the first African American to hold statewide office in Virginia. In the 1989 Virginia gubernatorial election, Wilder narrowly defeated Republican Marshall Coleman.

Wilder left the gubernatorial office in 1994, as the Virginia constitution prohibits governors from immediately seeking re-election. He briefly sought the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination, but withdrew from the race before the first primaries. He also briefly ran as an independent in the 1994 Virginia Senate election before dropping out of the race. Wilder returned to elective office in 2005, when he became the first directly elected mayor of Richmond. After leaving office in 2009, he worked as an adjunct professor and was involved in planning the unrealized United States National Slavery Museum.

==Early life==
Wilder was born on January 17, 1931, in the segregated Church Hill neighborhood of Richmond. He is the son of Beulah Olive (Richards) and Robert Judson Wilder. He is the grandson of slaves, his paternal grandparents having been enslaved in Goochland County. The seventh of eight brothers and sisters, Wilder was named for the African-American writers Paul Laurence Dunbar and Frederick Douglass.

Wilder&#x27;s father sold insurance and his mother worked as a maid. While the family was never completely destitute, Wilder recalled his early years during the Great Depression as a childhood of &quot;gentle poverty&quot;.

Wilder worked his way through Virginia Union University, a historically black university, by waiting tables at hotels and shining shoes, graduating in 1951 with a degree in chemistry.

Drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War, he volunteered for combat duty. At the Battle of Pork Chop Hill, he and two other men found themselves cut off from their unit, but they bluffed nineteen North Korean soldiers into surrendering, for which Wilder was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. He was a sergeant when he was discharged in 1953.

Following the war, Wilder worked in the state medical examiner&#x27;s office and pursued a master&#x27;s degree in chemistry. In 1956 he changed his career plans and entered Howard University Law School. After graduating in 1959, he established a law practice in Richmond, the Virginia capital.

Wilder married Eunice Montgomery in 1958. The couple had three children before divorcing in 1978: Lynn Diana; Lawrence Douglas Jr.; and Loren Deane.

== Early political life ==

Douglas Wilder had joined the Democratic Party and began his career in public office by winning a 1969 special election for the Virginia State Senate from a Richmond-area district. He was the first African American elected to the Virginia Senate since Reconstruction. A 1970 redistricting gave Wilder a predominantly African-American district, and he became a liberal in a predominantly conservative, white-majority legislature.

Wilder briefly flirted with an independent bid for the United States Senate in 1982. He did so after the initial favorite for the Democratic nomination, State Delegate Owen Pickett of Virginia Beach, paid homage to the Byrd Organization in announcing his bid. Angered that Pickett would praise a political machine who obstinately resisted racial integration, Wilder threatened to make an independent bid for the seat if Pickett won the nomination. Pickett not only realized that Wilder was serious, but that he would siphon off enough black votes in a three-way race to hand the seat to the Republican nominee, Congressman Paul Trible. Pickett pulled out of the race, and Wilder abandoned plans to run for the Senate.

In 1985 Wilder was narrowly elected as the 35th Lieutenant Governor of Virginia on a Democratic ticket headed by Attorney General Gerald L. Baliles, the party&#x27;s candidate for governor. Wilder was the first African American to win a statewide election in Virginia. Aware that he needed to reach the swath of the state&#x27;s majority-white electorate, Wilder had undertaken a two-month &quot;back roads&quot; campaign tour of the state, visiting Virginia&#x27;s predominantly rural central and western regions and enhancing his name recognition across the state.

== Campaign for governor ==

In the 1989 campaign for governor of Virginia, Wilder had a comfortable lead in the last polls before the election. The unexpected closeness of the election may have been due to the Republicans&#x27; strong get out the vote efforts. Wilder had been candid about his pro-choice position in relation to abortion. Some observers believed the close election was caused by the Bradley effect, and suggested that white voters were reluctant to tell pollsters that they did not intend to vote for Wilder. Wilder was elected governor on November 8, 1989, defeating Republican Marshall Coleman by a spread of less than half a percent. The narrow victory margin prompted a recount, which reaffirmed Wilder&#x27;s election.

== Tenure as Governor of Virginia ==
Douglas Wilder was sworn in on January 13, 1990, by former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. In recognition of his landmark achievement as the first elected African-American governor, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People awarded Wilder the Spingarn Medal for 1990.

During his tenure as governor, Wilder worked on crime and gun control initiatives. He also worked to fund Virginia&#x27;s transportation initiatives, effectively lobbying Congress to reallocate highway money to the states with the greatest needs. Much residential and office development had taken place in Northern Virginia without its receiving sufficient federal money for infrastructure improvements to keep up. He also succeeded in passing state bond issues to support improving transportation. In May 1990 Wilder ordered state agencies and universities to divest themselves of any investments in South Africa because of its policy of apartheid.

Wilder made a failed attempt to enter into an agreement with the Washington Redskins to build a stadium at Potomac Yard in Alexandria. Wilder and Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke had made an agreement for the move which entailed a $130 million subsidy by the state of the Virginia. However, legislators revised the agreement to reduce the cost to taxpayers by $40 million (relative to the original plan by Cooke and Wilder), which led Cooke to pull out of the agreement.

=== Capital punishment ===
During his term, Wilder carried out Virginia&#x27;s law on capital punishment, although he had opposed the death penalty when he served in the Virginia Senate. There were 14 executions by the electric chair, including the controversial case of Roger Keith Coleman. In January 1994 Wilder commuted the sentence of Earl Washington Jr., an intellectually disabled man, to life in prison based on testing of DNA evidence that raised questions about his guilt. Virginia law has strict time limits on when such new evidence can be introduced post-conviction. But in 2000, under a new governor, an STR-based DNA test led to the exclusion of Washington as the perpetrator of the murder for which he had been sentenced. He was fully exonerated by Governor Jim Gilmore for the capital murder and he was released from prison.

As Virginia limits consecutive gubernatorial terms, Wilder was succeeded in 1994 by George Allen.

==Campaigns for president and senate==
Wilder declared himself a candidate for President in 1991, but withdrew before the primary season had ended. He briefly ran for the U.S. Senate as an independent in 1994.

Relations between Wilder and then Senator Chuck Robb became strained following Wilder&#x27;s aborted 1982 senate bid, with surreptitious recordings taken by Robb&#x27;s staff contributing to a long running feud between the two men.

==Mayor of Richmond==
On May 30, 2004, Wilder announced his intention to run for Mayor of Richmond. Until 2004, the Richmond City Council had chosen the mayor from among its 9 members. The move to change this policy succeeded in November 2003 when voters approved a mayor-at-large referendum, with roughly 80 percent voting in favor of the measure. Wilder was a leading proponent of the mayor-at-large proposal.

On November 2, 2004, Wilder received 79% of the vote (55,319 votes) to become the first directly elected mayor of the city in sixty years. Upon winning the election, Wilder communicated his intentions to take on corruption in the city government, issuing several ultimatums to the sitting city council before he took office. He was sworn in on January 2, 2005.

He was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bipartisan group with a stated goal of &quot;making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.&quot; The Coalition was co-chaired by former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

On May 16, 2008, Wilder announced that he would not seek reelection to another four-year term as mayor.

==Post-political career==
Wilder has continued as a distinguished professor in the L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University. He writes occasional editorials for Virginia newspapers.

Douglas Wilder is the founder of the United States National Slavery Museum, a non-profit organization based in Fredericksburg, Virginia. The museum has been fundraising and campaigning since 2001 to establish a national museum of slavery in America. In June 2008 Wilder requested that the museum be granted tax exempt status, which was denied. From that time, taxes on the land had not been paid and the property was at risk of being sold at auction by the city of Fredericksburg.

Beset by financial problems the museum has been assessed delinquent property taxes for the years 2009, 2010, and 2011 amounting to just over $215,000. The organization filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection on September 22, 2011. Early in 2011 Douglas Wilder was refusing to respond to or answer any questions from either news reporters or patrons who had donated artifacts.

Wilder made news in 2012 when he refused to support Barack Obama, the nation&#x27;s first black president, for another term. He noted that he supported Obama in 2008, but said the president&#x27;s tenure in the Oval Office thus far had been a disappointment. Wilder did not endorse Mitt Romney, the Republican challenger, and later said that he hoped for an Obama victory despite having gone to a Romney fundraiser.

In 2015, Wilder published an autobiography, &quot;Son of Virginia: A Life in America&#x27;s Political Arena&quot;.

In March 2018, Wilder filed suit against John Accordino, who was serving as the Dean of his namesake college, for harassing Wilder&#x27;s assistant. This led to Accordino stepping down from his position and Susan Gooden being named as the interim dean of the college and then Wilder dropping the suit 4 months after filing.

In March 2019, Sydney Black filed a complaint under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 against Wilder for sexual harassment after she claims he made sexual advances to her, which she rebuffed, and then told her later that there was no funding for her position at the Virginia Commonwealth University. In July 2019, the university&#x27;s independent investigator concluded that Wilder did kiss the student without her consent. In response, Wilder provided a detailed rebuttal, in which he denied &quot;non-consensual sexual contact” between Black and him. In addition, he denied retaliating against her by saying her position had been eliminated. Wilder also claimed the investigator ignored contradictory evidence, including his claim that Black called him eight times after the night during which he supposedly kissed her, something she presumably would not have done if she felt harassed or threatened. The university planned to consider the investigator&#x27;s findings and Wilder&#x27;s rebuttal before deciding what action to take, if any. On October 24, 2019, Wilder announced that the university&#x27;s internal review panel had cleared him of wrongdoing.

In 2020, Wilder raised concerns that the state archives at the Library of Virginia had failed to provide access to the records of his gubernatorial administration.

In 2021, following the gubernatorial election of Republican Glenn Youngkin, Wilder joined Governor Youngkin&#x27;s transition team, alongside former Republican governors Jim Gilmore, Bob McDonnell, and George Allen.

<doc id="175368" wikidata="Q497572" url="?curid=175368" title="Braine-l'Alleud">
<text>Braine-l&#x27;Alleud (; ; ) is a municipality of Wallonia, in the province of Walloon Brabant, Belgium, about south of Brussels. 

The municipality consists of the following districts: Braine-l&#x27;Alleud (including the hamlet of Sart-Moulin), Lillois-Witterzée, and Ophain-Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. Bordering Flanders, the town is home to a minority of Dutch speakers.

The famous Lion of Waterloo, where the eponymous battle took place, is in the territory of Braine-l&#x27;Alleud.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
Several archaeological finds point to prehistoric settlements in this area. The first historical mention of a parish on Braine-l&#x27;Alleud&#x27;s current territory, then called &quot;Dudinsart&quot;, dates from 1131, date at which Godfrey I, Duke of Brabant ceded it to the Abbey of Gembloux. The Duke, however, still owned exempt land (or ) on this territory, as specified in a legal document by Henry I dated 1197. The name of the municipality changed to the current one, derived from &quot;Braine&quot;, former name of the stream that crosses its territory (now called the &quot;Hain&quot;), and &quot;alleu(d)&quot;, a medieval French word designating exempt land (English &quot;allod&quot;). The latter name was added to the former to distinguish this community from two neighbouring ones also called Braine.

At the beginning, the franchise might not have been much more than a right to local administration. By 1489, however, the local lord enjoyed complete juridical power on its territory, which was still formally part of the fiefdom obtained from the Duke of Brabant.

===Battle of Waterloo===
In 1815, part of the fighting that took place at the Battle of Waterloo actually occurred on the territory of Braine-l&#x27;Alleud. The town&#x27;s church of Saint-Étienne became a field hospital.

==Sights==
* The Lion&#x27;s Mound, erected on the site of the Battle of Waterloo, attracts thousands of visitors every year. A nearby visitor centre, a wax museum and a painted Waterloo Panorama also help retrace the events that led to Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1815.
* Converted into a tourist information centre, the former house of Cardinal Mercier is a good starting point to explore the town.
* Braine-l&#x27;Alleud is also home to a (slightly) smaller version of the well-known &quot;Manneken Pis&quot;, named &quot;El Gamin qui piche&quot; (&quot;The Peeing Kid&quot; in Walloon).
* The hamlet of Sart-Moulin is the inverted name of which inspired Hergé&#x27;s Moulinsart castle. 

==Sport==
Braine l&#x27;Alleud is home to RCS Braine football club, founded in 1913 and one of the oldest continuously existing clubs in the country.

The city also has a successful women&#x27;s basketball club, BC Castors Braine.

The free-to-play, 18-hole Parc du Bourdon disc golf course is situated 1 kilometer from Braine L&#x27;Alleud train station.

== Folklore ==
*Both Ophain and Braine-l&#x27;Alleud host yearly carnivals featuring giant puppets like in most other Belgian towns.

==Famous inhabitants==
*Johannes Tinctoris, Franco-Flemish musicologist and composer (c. 1435–1511), was born in the municipality.
*Désiré-Joseph Mercier, cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church and national hero (1851–1926)
*Paul-Henri Spaak, politician and (1899–1972)
*Gaston Reiff, track-and-field athlete (1921–1992)
*Amaury Bonduel, racing driver (born 1999)

== Transportation ==

* Bus: Société Régionale Wallonne du Transport (SRWT) (Walloon Regional Transport Company) operates under the name of &quot;TEC Brabant Wallon&quot;.
It is served by the following 10 bus lines:

<text>Chastre (; , ) is a French-speaking municipality in Belgium that is located in Wallonia, in the province of Walloon Brabant.

Its name comes from the Gallo-Roman word &quot;castra&quot; &quot;fortress, fortified camp&quot;, from the Latin &quot;castra&quot; which is the plural form of &quot;castrum&quot; meaning &quot;entrenchment, fortified place&quot;.

Chastre is a rural and at the same time residential municipality, with 7,684 inhabitants. Chastre comprises seven former villages: Chastre, Villeroux, Blanmont, Cortil-Noirmont, Gentinnes and Saint-Géry. It is crossed by the old Chaussée Brunehaut, a Roman way that connected Bavay to Cologne.

Located between Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve and Gembloux, 40 km from Brussels, Chastre is well served by road and railway networks. A small river called the Orne passes right through Chastre. With its tributaries, the Orne creates enchanting landscapes, surrounding magnificent farmhouses, often still fully in use. Chastre&#x27;s highest point has an elevation of 165 metres. The municipality is twinned with Lespignan, Hérault department, France (since 1998) and Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu, Canada.

== History ==
In the early 10th century, half of Cortil (&quot;Curtils&quot;) was owned by Saint Guibert (&quot;Wichpertus&quot;). He donated it to Gembloux Abbey, which he had just founded, in 936. The donation was confirmed in a charter of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, in 946.

Chastre was a municipality of the Dyle department under the French regime.

===Postal history===

The Chastre-Villeroux post office opened on 10 May 1876, that of Gentinnes on 28 April 1905, that of Blanmont on 27 November 1908.

Chastre has had the postal code 1450 since at least October 1990.

In 1969 (before the merger of municipalities in 1977) the postal codes were: - 5860 Chastre-Villeroux-Blanmont - 5861 Cortil-Noirmont - 5862 Gentinnes - 5863 Saint-Géry.

==Heraldry==
Chastre received its coat of arms on 4 July 1978. It is the coat of arms of the former municipality of Chastre-Villeroux-Blanmont, which received it on 22 April 1969, of the Kessel family (lozenges), the last lords of Blanmont, and also of the Onyn family, last lords of Chastre.

==Geography==

=== Location ===
Along the N4 road, approximately halfway between Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve and Gembloux, Chastre is also reachable by train (SNCB line 161 stops at Blanmont and Chastre), and by the TEC buses (depot). Chastre is surrounded by the municipalities of Walhain-Saint-Paul, Gembloux, Mont-Saint-Guibert, Sombreffe and Villers-la-Ville.

=== Hydrography ===
Chastre is crossed by two charming small rivers: the Orne and the Houssière. The former rises in Bertinchamps (Gembloux, province of Namur), and waters the villages of Cortil, Noirmont, Chastre and Blanmont before flowing by Mont-Saint-Guibert and eventually emptying into the Dyle, via the Thyle, in Court-Saint-Étienne. The latter rises in Sombreffe, near Gentinnes, which it runs through, then crosses Villeroux and eventually empties into the Orne at Mont-Saint-Guibert. It cannot be said that these two small rivers have made much of a dent in this part of the Brabant high plateau, which has an elevation of between 145 and 155 metres.

=== Natural environment ===
Despite being very green, the natural environment of Chastre is quite poor. The essentially rural vocation has changed with the population&#x27;s growth and diversification. The number of agricultural enterprises is continuously decreasing. Due to its location between Brussels and Namur and to the high road and railroad connections, Chastre&#x27;s countryside has had to face a strong urbanisation for more than 30 years.

=== Demography ===
On 1 November 2019, Chastre had 7,684 inhabitants (3,805 men and 3,879 women), giving a population density of 245.73 inhabitants per square km for a surface of 31.27 square km.

<text>Chaumont-Gistoux (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant. On 1 January 2006 Chaumont-Gistoux had a total population of 10,926. The total area is 48.09 km2 which gives a population density of 227 inhabitants per km2.

It was formed from the fusion, in 1977, of Dion-Valmont (itself a fusion in 1971 of Dion-le-Val and Dion-le-Mont), Bonlez, Corroy-le-Grand, Longueville and Chaumont-Gistoux. The administrative offices are now in the village of Gistoux.

It is a semi-rural municipality with several working farms, large areas given over to fields and forests, although there is a major industry of sand extraction, now mostly in decline. Due to this history there are now several haulage and construction firms based in the municipality.

Chaumont-Gistoux is on the KW-line, a defensive line erected early in the Second World War, intended to prevent invasion from Nazi Germany. A small museum houses information about the line and many exhibits from the war.

Princess Claire of Belgium grew up in Chaumont-Gistoux. The Coombs family still resides there to this day, and the Princess, her husband Prince Laurent and their children are often seen in the municipality.

==Villages in the municipality==

<text>Ittre (; ; , ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant. Since the fusion of the Belgian municipalities in 1977, the municipality is composed of three districts: Haut-Ittre, Ittre and Virginal-Samme.

Ittre was the geographical center of Belgium until World War I. The geographical center was moved to Walhain due to the allocation of the East Cantons (Eupen-Malmédy) to Belgium (Treaty of Versailles).

==History==
Traditions mention the existence of the village of Ittre about the year 640, although the name is first documented in 877. But the site was already occupied in the Roman period and even in the Neolithic era.

Haut-Ittre (literally High-Ittre) is the name given to the village overlooking Ittre. Virginal would take its name from &quot;Versus Altum&quot;, name given by the Gallo-Romans because of its culminating situation.

Its territory, after having belonged to Nivelles Abbey, was divided into several seigniories, Ittre and Fauquez being the most significant, the lords of which were in constant conflict over their jurisdiction, sovereignty and precedence in the territory and in the church of Ittre. These disputes ended only at the beginning of the 18th century. Among the most significant families in the seigniory of Ittre were those of Ittre, Rifflart and Trazegnies d&#x27;Ittre, and in Fauquez, the families of Ittre, Enghien, Fauquez and Herzelles. Fauquez and Ittre both furnished titles to marquisates, in 1689 and 1703 respectively.

The commune was connected with a number of notable persons, including Ambroise-Joseph de Herzelles, third marquis de Fauquez, whom the Empress Maria-Theresa appointed Superintendent and General Manager of the Finances and Domains of the Netherlands.

==Religion==
The foundation of the church of Ittre occurred around 640, and is principally known as the centre of the veneration of Our Lady of Ittre, which began in 1336, when a terrible plague was raging in the Low Countries. The statue of the Virgin, from the monastery at Bois-Seigneur-Isaac, was carried in procession from village to village and on her arrival in Ittre, the plague stopped. The inhabitants refused to return it to Bois-Seigneur-Isaac, and the Virgin remained in Ittre, despite subsequent litigation, in which the ecclesiastical courts always supported the church of Ittre. An annual procession was established in 1384 and has been held every year without interruption since then on August 15. Our Lady of Ittre was especially invoked against hernias or ruptures.

Saint Lutgarde has also been venerated in Ittre since the nuns of Aywiers Abbey, forced out by the French Revolution, found refuge in the Château de Fauquez in either 1796 or 1804. They brought with them the relics of Saint Lutgarde, which they gave permanently to the church of Ittre in 1819.

==Buildings==
Ittre contains two châteaux, the Château d&#x27;Ittre and the Château de Baudémont. The much grander Château de Fauquez was destroyed in 1827 during the construction of the Brussels-Charleroi Canal.

Churches

St Remigius&#x27; Church (1896-1899: architect Clément Léonard), in Ittre. This church contains several treasures : the shrine of Saint Lutgardis of Aywières and the statue of Our Lady of Ittre.

St Lawrence&#x27;s Church is a Romanesque church in Haut-Ittre. It has preserved its sandstone tower, apse and central nave from this period.

St Peter&#x27;s Church in Virginal Church of St.Peter. Rebuilt in 1827 in neoclassical style, it has stained glass windows (1928) from the old glassworks of Fauquez.

<text>La Hulpe (; , ; ) is a municipality of Wallonia in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant, 20 km south-east of the centre of Brussels, but only about 3 km from the edge of the Brussels-Capital Region. On January 1, 2007, La Hulpe had a total population of 7,309. The total area is 15.60 km2, including 3 km2 of the Sonian Forest; this gives a population density of 463 inhabitants per km2.

La Hulpe still keeps two hamlets, Gaillemarde in the west and Malaise-Bakenbos in the east. The limits of the latter hamlet and of other parts of La Hulpe were modified when the linguistic border (between French and Dutch) was fixed in 1963.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication&#x27;s (SWIFT) headquarters are located in La Hulpe.

==History==
The name of La Hulpe comes from the Celtic word &quot;helpe&quot;, &quot;the silver river&quot;. The brooks that water La Hulpe form a string of ponds that is called today L&#x27;Argentine.

The site was already settled 10,000 years BC, as proved by an axe made of smooth flintstone found in Gaillemarde. The village was founded by the Duke of Brabant by clearing a hill separating the valleys of Argentine and Mazerine. La Hulpe was granted municipal rights by a charter signed by Henri I on 3 June 1320. It became a &quot;mairie&quot;, where lower and higher justice was exercised, and kept its status until 1792. The pillory standing near the church was demolished under the French rule; it was partially restored and can be seen in the town hall. From 1795 to 1814, La Hulpe was the seat of a court with jurisdiction over some ten neighbouring municipalities, in an area spreading from Overijse to Waterloo. After the independence of Belgium, La Hulpe lost its administrative and political functions and was incorporated into the canton of Wavre.

The church of La Hulpe was mentioned in a document dated 1226. It is shown on the oldest representation of La Hulpe, a Brussels tapestry from the &quot;Hunts of Maximilian&quot; suite kept in the Louvre Museum, showing a hunting scene emblematic of a month in Charles V&#x27;s time. The church, except the tower and the central nave, were dramatically transformed, for the last time in 1906. The King Baudouin&#x27;s Memorial was built behind the church, close to the oak commemorating the centenary of Belgium.

For three centuries, the economy of La Hulpe has been driven by paper-making industry, favoured by the closeness to Brussels and the availability of pure water. The first paper mill was set up on the Grand Etang (Big Pond). In 1664, King of Spain Philip II allowed the foundation of the &quot;Imperial and Royal Paper Manufacture&quot; in La Hulpe. Paper-making industry was suppressed in 1970.
The castle of La Hulpe, built in French style in 1842, was purchased by Count Ernest Solvay in 1893 and transferred to the Belgian state by his grandson, Ernest-John Solvay, in 1968. It is surrounded by a 227-ha domain with pastures, woods and ponds, known as Domaine Solvay. The castle and the domain are today managed by the Walloon Region and the Domaine Solvay association. The domain was protected for its aesthetic value by Royal Decree on 10 June 1963, then registered on the Walloon main heritage list in 1993, and eventually listed as a Natura 2000 site. In 1988, the movie Le Maître de musique (The Music Teacher) by Gérard Corbiau, starring José Van Dam, was made in the castle and park of La Hulpe.

The farm of the castle, built in 1833, is the seat of the Folon Foundation, inaugurated on 27 October 2000. Jean-Michel Folon (1934–2005) is mostly known as one of the most popular illustrators and poster designers of the second half of the 20th century. In the 1990s, Folon decided to create a foundation in the Solvay Domain, a place where he used to play when he was a young boy. He transferred to the foundation more than 300 of his works and organized their scenographic presentation in 15 rooms of the former farm. The foundation welcomed 80,000 visitors during its first year of existence.

<doc id="175382" wikidata="Q678158" url="?curid=175382" title="Lasne">
<text>Lasne (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Walloon Brabant, Belgium, south east of Brussels. 

In 2008, Lasne had a population of 14,043. The total area is 47.22 km² which gives a population density of 297 inhabitants per km². Lasne is the richest municipality in Wallonia, measured by the average taxable income of the inhabitants. It also has the lowest local taxes of any municipality in Belgium.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Couture-Saint-Germain, Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert, Maransart, Ohain, and Plancenoit (including the hamlet of Marache). 

While the municipality has taken the name of Lasne, the administrative offices are in the village of Ohain.

Ohain contains an example of a Brabant-Wallon village green: almost triangular in shape and sloping gently. The green contains many mature trees and is bordered on 2 sides by old houses and shops. The church in Ohain was built around the year 1200 and the strongly built square tower dates from this time.

The village of Couture-Saint-Germain contains the ruins of the Cistercian Abbey of Aywiers which has been the subject of pilgrimages since the late 19th century in honour of Saint Lutgarde who lived there for 30 years in the first half of the 13th century.

Part of the Battle of Waterloo was fought in the village of Plancenoit, notably around the church and the fortified farm of La Papelotte. The cemetery wall is said to still contain holes made by musket balls. It was in Plancenoit that Blücher&#x27;s troops engaged Napoleon&#x27;s army, having marched from Wavre. Blücher and Wellington met after the battle at the farm &#x27;La Belle Alliance&#x27; - now a bar. The current historic area commemorating the battle is jointly administered by the municipalities of Lasne, Waterloo and Braine-l&#x27;Alleud.

==Geography==

The municipality takes its name from the river Lasne which rises in the village of Plancenoit and flows through several of the villages which make up the municipality. The name Lasne comes from the Celtic word meaning flat or calm, presumably referring to the slow moving river.

Lasne is in a region of Belgium known as the Pays Romain or Roman Land. The Grand Chemin is a major road traversing the municipality, linking the large towns of Wavre and Nivelles, and formed a part of a network of Roman roads ultimately linking the ports of the Rhine and Seine with sea ports. The distance between small chapels on this path is equal to one or more leagues, or at a precise fraction of a Gaulish league, where a Gaulish league equals .

==Economy==
Lasne is a semi-rural municipality retaining several working farms. 66% of the land area is rural, of which 66% is agricultural land, and the remainder, forest and open areas. In the past, there were a silk factory and sand extraction, although there is no longer any industry within the municipality.

In 2007, Lasne was still considered as the richest municipality of Belgium, with an average taxable income of 40,949 euros per year according to the latest report of the INS (Institut National de Statistique).

==Twin towns==
The municipality is twinned with Azay-le-Rideau (France) and Abbeville, Louisiana (USA).

<text>Nivelles (; ; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant. The Nivelles municipality includes the former municipalities of Baulers, Bornival, Thines, and Monstreux.

The Nivelles arrondissement includes all the municipalities in Walloon Brabant.

The Collegiate Church of St. Gertrude has been classified as a heritage site of Wallonia.

==History==

===The rise of Nivelles===
Starting in 4,000 BC, the Nivelles region was gradually turned into agricultural land by the Danubian settlers. Most of their ancestral Rubanean civilization was destroyed by the Roman invaders during the first century AD. In turn, most of the Roman constructions, including villas, were destroyed during the Germanic invasions of the 3rd century.

In the 7th century, the territory was part of the Austrasian Frankish kingdom, and the Mayor of the Palace, Pippin of Landen, rebuilt a villa there that covered more than 78 km². After Pippin&#x27;s death in 640, the bishop of Maastricht, the future Saint Amand, urged Pippin&#x27;s widow, Itta, to found an abbey in their villa. Itta&#x27;s daughter, Gertrude, became the monastery&#x27;s first abbess and was venerated as a saint upon her death. The growing influx of pilgrims necessitated the construction of ever-bigger churches, which culminated in the huge Romanesque structure that still stands today. The dedication of the church took place in 1046 in the presence of Wazo, Prince-Bishop of Liège, and Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. This was the golden age of the Nivelles monastery, which now owned territories as far as Friesland, the Moselle and the Rhine.

===13th century to 1830===
In the 13th century, the city that grew around the church became part of the Duchy of Brabant. The population was mainly artisans and guild members, who did not hesitate to fight the abbesses and the dukes to obtain their rights. These rights were finally granted by Joanna, Duchess of Brabant in the 14th century. In 1647, an important uprising by the thread manufacturers resulted in many of the city&#x27;s entrepreneurs leaving for France, leading to the city&#x27;s economic decline. The wars of the 17th century between France and the Spanish Netherlands made the situation worse as Nivelles went through successive sieges and military occupations. The Austrian and French regimes of the 18th century brought religious and administrative reforms to the city.

===1830 to the present day===
In 1830, Nivelles was one of the first cities to send patriotic troops to Brussels to fight in the Belgian Revolution. The following years were marked by the growth of heavy industry, including metallurgy and railway construction. The bombing of the city during World War I brought some damage to buildings, but greater devastation occurred during World War II on 14 May 1940, when almost the entire city centre was destroyed, leaving only the walls of the collegiate church standing. The rebuilding of the church was completed in 1984, but remains can be seen of wall fragments on the south side of the collegiate.

==Main sights==
* The Collegiate Church of St. Gertrude, patron saint of the city, dates from the 11th to the 13th century and is one of the best examples of Romanesque style in Belgium. It has been classified as one of Europe&#x27;s major heritage sites. Tombs from the Merovingian (7th century) and Carolingian (9th century) periods have been found under the church. The Romanesque crypt is one of the largest of its kind in Europe. 
* The two-meter-tall statue that strikes the hours in one of the towers () is affectionately known as &quot;Jean de Nivelles&quot;. Jean dates from around 1400.
* The Recollets convent and its church date from the 16th century.
* Nivelles also has an archaeological museum, which complements the visit at Saint Gertrude.
* The &quot;Dodaine&quot; park provides a welcome green space on the southern side of the town.

==Folklore==
* Like Ath, Nivelles boasts a collection of processional giants, one of which, Goliath, dates from 1365. The Goliath family (husband, wife and son) is usually accompanied by an odd collection of giant animals, including a lion, a camel, a unicorn, and a dragon.
* Originating in the 13th century, the well-attended Saint-Gertrude religious procession is held annually.
* The Nivelles Carnival is more recent (19th century) and takes place on the first weekend of Lent. Like the Binche Carnival, that of Nivelles includes the famous Gilles.
* The city&#x27;s gastronomic specialty is the &quot;tarte al d&#x27;jote&quot;, a type of quiche including local cheese, onions, greens, eggs and butter.
* Nivelles is also known for its 49-bell carillon and its four named canons.

==Sports==
In and , the Belgian Grand Prix was hosted at the Nivelles-Baulers circuit. Emerson Fittipaldi won the race both times. The circuit ultimately proved unpopular and has since been demolished.

<text>Perwez (; ; , ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant.

== Geography and demographics ==

On 1 January 2006 the municipality had 7,487 inhabitants. The total area is 50.81 km2, giving a population density of 147 inhabitants per km2.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Malèves-Sainte-Marie-Wastines, Orbais, Thorembais-les-Béguines, and Thorembais-Saint-Trond.

== History ==
In Roman times, Perwez was on the Roman road from Bavay to Cologne. This resulted in three tumuli which are no longer visible today. In 1977 a tomb with several Roman artefacts was discovered near the farm of Long Pont.

In medieval times, Perwez often suffered from its position near the border between the Duchy of Brabant and the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. Perwez developed around its church and its castle, which was demolished somewhat before 1870. The main source of wealth for Perwez was its market, which relied on agricultural products.
In the modern era (1500-1800) Perwez got a cloth hall and a wheats exchange . In 1511 it got an annual October market. In 1577 troops paid by the rebellious States General camped near Perwez.

During the Franco-Dutch War many houses and harvests were destroyed. The subsequent Nine Years&#x27; War was utterly ruinous for Perwez.

During the 19th century Perwez saw quite some industrialization based on agriculture. In 1870 there were two watermills, two windmills, two tanneries, three breweries and a râperie, linked to a central sugar factory.

The râperie was a very significant enterprise, which had 175 employees. It extracted juice from sugar beet, which was then sent by pipeline to the Wanze Sugar Factory. It was located on the Avenue de Rosaraie and closed down in 1959. Some remaining buildings are now used by a high-end restaurant.

During World War II Perwez suffered from an accidental disaster. On 13 May 1940, a French ammunition storage or mine in the center of town was hit and exploded. There were 33 casualties. The French then ignited other mines, leading to much destruction. On 6 September 1944 Perwez was liberated by the American 2nd Armored Division.

<doc id="175393" wikidata="Q678612" url="?curid=175393" title="Villers-la-Ville">
<text>Villers-la-Ville (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant. On January 1, 2006, Villers-la-Ville had a total population of 9,572. The total area is 47.45 km2 which gives a population density of 202 inhabitants per km2. The municipality includes also the villages of Marbais, Mellery, Sart-Dames-Avelines and Tilly.

==History==

=== Early History and Founding ===
The most notable historical site in Villers-la-Ville is the Villers Abbey, a Cistercian abbey founded in 1146 by twelve monks and three lay brothers from Clairvaux. The land for the abbey was granted by Gauthier de Marbais. Initially, the monks established several preliminary sites before finally settling on the current location in the 13th century.

=== Architectural Development ===
The construction of the abbey was a monumental task that spanned several decades. The choir was completed by 1217, the crypt by 1240, and the refectory by 1267. The church itself took 70 years to build and was completed by the end of the 13th century. During this period, the abbey reached the height of its fame and importance, with contemporary accounts suggesting that roughly 100 monks and 300 lay brothers resided within its walls. The abbey’s lands expanded to approximately 100 km² of woods, fields, and pasturage.

=== Decline and Challenges ===
The abbey began to face challenges in the 16th century, tied to the larger troubles of the Low Countries. Spanish tercios caused considerable damage to the church and cloister during the campaign of 1544. Although partially restored in 1587, the abbey’s fortunes continued to diminish in the 17th and 18th centuries1. The number of monks and the abbey’s wealth dwindled, and it was finally abandoned in 1796 following the French Revolution.

=== Post-Abandonment and Restoration ===
After its abandonment, the abbey fell into disrepair. Further degradation occurred in 1855 when a railway line was constructed through the old abbatial grounds1. In 1893, the Belgian state purchased the site and launched a conservation effort1. The abbey was classified as an official historic site in 1973, and since then, it has undergone considerable restoration1. The remains of the abbey, including the cloister, refectory, kitchens, dormitories, and brewing house, can still be seen today.

=== Modern Significance ===
Today, Villers Abbey is a significant cultural and historical site. It hosts an annual choir festival, La Nuit des Chœurs, where various choirs perform different genres of music1. The site is maintained by the Association pour la Promotion Touristique et Culturelle de Villers (APTCV). The church, although in ruins, is an outstanding example of Cistercian architecture, with imposing vaulting, arches, and rose windows.

==Sites==

To the north of the village lie the ruins of the Villers Abbey, which was one of the most important Cistercian abbeys of Europe. It was founded in 1147 and destroyed by the French republicans in 1795. In the ruined church attached to the abbey the tombstones of several dukes of Brabant of the 13th and 14th centuries are still to be found.

The ruins also appear in the final episode of season 2 of sense8.

===Postal history===
The MARBAIS post office opened on 1 June 1838. It used postal distribution code 33 with bars (before 1864), and code 235 with points before 1874. 
The VILLERS-LA-VILLE post-office opened on 10 February 1865. SART-DAMES-AVELINES on 15 October 1877, TILLY on 8 November 1906.

Postal codes in 1969:
*6318 Marbais
*6320 Villers-la-Ville
*6321 Tilly
*6322 Mellery
*6328 Sart-Dames-Avelines

<doc id="175395" wikidata="Q179034" url="?curid=175395" title="Waterloo, Belgium">
<text>Waterloo (; ; ) is a municipality in Wallonia, located in the province of Walloon Brabant, Belgium, which in 2011 had a population of 29,706 and an area of . Waterloo lies a short distance south of Brussels, and immediately north-east of the larger town of Braine-l&#x27;Alleud. It is the site of the Battle of Waterloo, where the resurgent Napoleon was defeated for the final time in 1815. Waterloo lies immediately south of the official language border between Flanders and Wallonia.

==Etymology==
From Middle Dutch, composed of water (water, watery) + loo (forest, clearing in a forest, marsh, bog).

==History==

The name of Waterloo was mentioned for the first time in 1102 designating a small hamlet at the limit of what is today known as the Sonian Forest, along a major road linking Brussels, Genappe and a coal mine to the south. Waterloo was located at the intersection of the main road and a path leading to a small farming settlement in what is now Cense. The crossing can still be found today as the intersection of the Chaussée de Bruxelles with Boulevard de la Cense. Waterloo was a place where travellers and merchants, particularly those carrying coal from the mine to the south, could find rest and protection from bandits.

Waterloo was located in the Duchy of Brabant created in 1183 with Leuven as the capital city. The Duchy of Brabant extended from Luttre to &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in 1477. Brussels became the capital city of the Duchy of Brabant in 1267 and the capital city of the Burgundian Netherlands in 1430.

Waterloo started to develop during the 17th century. A royal chapel was built in 1687 in Petit-Waterloo, and was extended in 1826, becoming the Church of Saint Joseph of Waterloo.

During the late 18th century, whilst the region was under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire, a period of unrest marked the wake of the 1789 French Revolution. Reforms designed to quell those agitating to bring enlightenment ideas to the region were unsuccessful. In 1794, the French invaded, bringing an end to the region&#x27;s Ancien Régime, encompassing the monasteries, their official record-keeping, and the privileges of the nobility. 
Up until 1796, Waterloo was divided into two parts, Grand-Waterloo and Petit-Waterloo, depending, respectively, of the parishes of Braine-l&#x27;Alleud (Bishopric of Namur) and of Sint-Genesius-Rode (Bishopric of Mechelen). A new system based on municipalities was established under French rule. The municipality of Waterloo was created from Petit-Waterloo detached from Sint-Genesius-Rode and three former hamlets (Grand-Waterloo, Joli-Bois, Mont-Saint-Jean) detached from Braine-l’Alleud. 

In 1813, half of the hamlet of Chenois was detached from Braine-l’Alleud and became part of Waterloo. In 1824, Waterloo grew again as the areas Roussart and Sainte-Gertrude from the Sonian Forest became part of the municipality. Waterloo had 1,571 inhabitants in 1801 and 3,202 in 1846.

In 1795, the invaded territories were divided into nine departments. Some municipalities, including Waterloo, became part of the Dyle department, which became the province of Brabant Méridional in 1815 under Dutch rule, following the defeat of Napoleon. Upon Belgian independence in 1830, it became part of the province of Brabant.

On 4 September 1944, Waterloo was liberated from German occupation by Allied forces.

In 1977, the second half of the hamlet of Chenois was detached from Braine-l’Alleud and became part of Waterloo together with a part of the hamlet next to the Lion.

In 1995, the province of Brabant was divided to match the limits of the administrative regions of Wallonia, Brussels and Flanders created in 1980. The part in which Waterloo is situated became the province of Walloon Brabant.

===Battle of Waterloo===

The Battle of Waterloo took place near Waterloo on 18 June 1815 between the First French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte and the Seventh Coalition (troops from Prussia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau), under the main allied commanders, the Duke of Wellington and Field Marshal von Blücher.

==Districts in Waterloo==

Waterloo is divided into six districts: Faubourg Ouest (north-west of Chaussée de Bruxelles), Faubourg Est (north-east of Chaussée de Bruxelles), Chenois (west of the railway), Centre, Joli-Bois (south of centre) and Mont-St-Jean (north of the Waterloo battle field).

== Demographics ==

Nearly one-fifth of the current registered population (5,640 inhabitants) is non-Belgian; many such residents work for institutions or companies in Brussels, a political centre of the European Union. These numbers were released by the municipality of Waterloo. The most common non-Belgian nationalities are the following: French (1,237 people), Italian (537), British (503), American (445) and Swedish (425).

It is one of the wealthiest towns in Wallonia.

==Economy==
Waterloo is home to the European headquarters of Mastercard. There is a Carrefour hypermarket in Mont-Saint-Jean, a Delhaize store, an Ibis Hotel, several BNP Paribas Fortis branches, office parks to the east of the town.

A row of shops, called &#x27; is situated on the &#x27; (which becomes &quot;Chaussée de Waterloo&quot;, or &quot;&quot; when leaving Waterloo in the north and nearing Brussels).

==Education==
The Argenteuil estate is host to a number of international and local educational establishments, including; the Scandinavian School of Brussels, the European School of Bruxelles-Argenteuil, &quot;Den norske skolen i Brussel&quot;, and the Queen Elisabeth Music Chapel.

St. John&#x27;s International School is also located within the commune.

==Notable landmarks==
===Lion&#x27;s Mound===

The Lion&#x27;s Mound is a monument to the casualties of the 1815 Battle of Waterloo, located on the spot where a musket ball hit the shoulder of William II of the Netherlands (the Prince of Orange) and knocked him from his horse during the battle. A statue of a lion, looking towards France, standing upon a stone-block pedestal surmounts the hill. Visitors can climb the 226 steps to the top of the hill for a panoramic vista of the battlefield. 

Other attractions nearby related to the battle are the Battle Panorama Mural, Wellington Museum, and the Roman Catholic Church of St. Joseph, where Wellington is said to have prayed before going into battle and where British and Dutch plaques commemorating the fallen are now to be seen.

===Argenteuil estate===
In 1831, approximately 250 hectares of land in the Sonian Forest was acquired by Ferdinand De Meeus, a member of the Belgian nobility, who bestowed the name &quot;Argenteuil&quot; to the estate. The first &quot;Château d&#x27;Argenteuil&quot;, built in 1835 was destroyed by a fire in 1847, and rebuilt between 1856 and 1858 using a design by Belgian architect, Jean-Pierre Cluysenaar, and extensive landscaping of the surrounding lands by Édouard Keilig. In the 1920s the De Meeûs family incorporated the estate into the &quot;Domaine d&#x27;Argenteuil SA&quot;, and in 1929 sold 145 hectares of the land to American businessman, William Hallam Tuck. Tuck and his wife, Belgian heiress, Hilda Bunge, commissioned New York architect, William Delano, to design the second major residence on the Argenteuil estate, the &quot;Château Bellevue&quot;. Whilst the couple occupied the property, it became known commonly as the &quot;Château Tuck&quot;.

====Château d&#x27;Argenteuil====

In 1940, the Château d&#x27;Argenteuil, 20 hectares of its surrounding lands and a farm were sold to a community of Carmelite Sisters in exchange for their properties in Uccle, Brussels. However, the château was not suited to their needs, and they moved out in 1947. The Belgian government acquired the Château d&#x27;Argenteuil in 1949. In 1950, as part of preparations for the 1958 Brussels World’s Fair, the Belgian government used the chateau to relocate the French-speaking section of the &quot;&quot;, an all-female normal school, from Laeken, the site of the exhibition. The château&#x27;s bedrooms were refitted for boarders. The Belgian government later used the site for various Belgian state school establishments, building dedicated buildings for classrooms on the grounds of the château. In 1990, the Scandinavian School of Brussels, Queen Astrid School, purchased the Château d&#x27;Argenteuil and its grounds, and relocated there in 1992. From September 2016, the European School of Bruxelles-Argenteuil began operating on the same site.

====Château Bellevue====
In 1949, the Belgian government acquired the Château Bellevue, originally for use by the Belgian national rail company, the SNCB. In 1958 it was used as residence for distinguished visitors to the 1958 World&#x27;s Fair in Brussels. From 1961 it was the official residence of the Belgian royal family, King Leopold III and his wife Princess Lilian, up until her death in 2003. During discussions on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe there were proposals to turn the château into a residence for the mooted position of the President of the European Union. However, the Belgian government sold the Chateau Bellevue in September 2004.

====Dames de Berlaymont====
In 1960, Count Ludovic de Meeûs d&#x27;Argenteuil sold thirty hectares of the Argenteuil estate to the Dames de Berlaymont, who had to vacate their properties in Brussels following their acquisition by the Belgian state for the purpose of building a headquarters for the European Commission. The nuns established a new convent and boarding school on the site.

==Former landmarks==
===Château Cheval===

The Château Cheval stood at the crossing of the main routes between Charleroi and Brussels, and Nivelles and Leuven. It was originally built in 1895 as the home of a French industrialist who had made his fortune in Mont-Saint-Jean, Waterloo following the opening of a chemical fertiliser plant in 1875. The château, with its four towers and ninety-nine windows, was too extravagant for the tastes of its owner, who found himself only able to sleep there once per week. Cheval gave it to his only daughter who occupied it with her husband until his death in 1962. The exorbitant costs associated with running the property led to its demolition in 1966.

==Public transport==

Waterloo railway station was opened on 1 February 1874, with the simultaneous opening of the railway line between Waterloo and Brussels. An extension of the line southwards to Nivelles, and then Luttre was opened on 1 June 1874, permitting travel onwards to Charleroi, along an existing line opened in 1843. 

Today, Waterloo is served by local passenger trains on the Nivelles to Aalst line, with at least one train in each direction per hour. Non-stopping services between Waterloo and Brussels operate during peak times.

== Sport ==

Waterloo is home to ASUB Waterloo, one of Belgium&#x27;s most successful Rugby Union teams.

Waterloo is also home of Watducks Hockey Club, multiple Belgium champions of field hockey and European Champions in 2019 (EHL).

== Notable residents ==
In September 1959 the Missionary Dominican Sisters of Our Lady of Fichermont, headquartered in Waterloo, became the home of Jeannine Deckers, who took the name Sister Luc-Gabrielle, and who would later become famous as The Singing Nun.

On 2 February 2018, the Belgian commune of Waterloo confirmed that former Catalonia president Carles Puigdemont had rented a villa and planned to establish his official residence there.

<text>Wavre (; ; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia, and the capital of the province of Walloon Brabant, Belgium.

Wavre is in the Dyle valley. Most inhabitants speak French as their mother tongue and are called &quot;Wavriens&quot; and &quot;Wavriennes&quot;.

The municipality consist of the following sub-municipalities: Bierges, Limal, and Wavre proper.

Wavre is also called &quot;the City of the Maca&quot;, referring to the statue of the small boy trying to climb the wall of the city hall. Tradition holds that touching the Maca&#x27;s buttocks brings a year of luck.

==History==

===Antiquity and Middle Ages===
The foundations of a wealthy Roman villa were found very close to Wavre, complete with a portico and many rooms. This part of Gaul, however, was ravaged by the Germanic invasions in the 3rd and 4th century, and it is only in the year 1050 that Wavre was mentioned for the first time, as a dependency of the County of Leuven, part of the Brabant pagus. The chapel built by the counts near the former Gallo-Roman villa was ceded to the Affligem Abbey a few years later. By the 13th century a market already existed in the budding town built at the crossroads of the Brussels-Namur and Nivelles-Leuven roads. In 1222, Duke Henry I of Brabant granted the town its city charter. At around the same time, the Affligem Abbey expanded its Wavre possessions into a priory, which attracted pilgrims from a wide region around the city.

===16th- to 18th-century disasters===
The relative peace of the city came to an end on 8 March 1489, when Duke Albert of Saxony took it and pillaged it in retaliation for Wavre&#x27;s sympathy with Brabant’s revolt against Austria. From then on until the beginning of the 18th century, the city went through one disaster after another. Between the destruction by Duke Charles of Guelders in 1504 and that brought by Louis XIV’s wars around 1700, Wavre would know several debilitating crises, either at the hand of foreign armies (e.g., the Spanish in 1604) or because of epidemics (1624–1625, 1668) or major fires (28 April 1695 and 17 July 1714). The 18th century was relatively prosperous, but a troubled period started again around 1790, with Wavre&#x27;s participation in the Brabant Revolution against Austrian interests. After the Battle of Fleurus (1794), the city became French. Like many of its neighbours, the city suffered from mandatory conscription, curtailment of religious freedoms, and the dissolution of the old administrative offices.

===From Waterloo until now===
On 18 and 19 June 1815, the Battle of Wavre was fought here on the same day as the Battle of Waterloo. Napoleon had sent Marshal Grouchy to pursue part of the retreating Prussian army under the command of General Johann von Thielmann. Despite hearing the cannon sound from nearby Waterloo, Grouchy decided to obey his orders and engage the one Prussian Corps in Wavre. By the time Grouchy&#x27;s battle was over, Napoleon had already lost at Waterloo.

The century that followed saw the expansion of local industry, including foundries, a paper mill, and a sugar refinery. Wavre was severely affected by both world wars, with heavy fighting, bombing and several houses put on fire. In the 21st century, Wavre enjoyed renewed prosperity as the capital of the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant created in 1995.

==Attractions==

*The Gothic-style church of St John the Baptist was built in 1475. Its main tower houses a 50-bell carillon.
*The city hall dates from the 18th century. It is housed in the former church of the Carmelites and features a cloistered courtyard.
*In 1975, the first Walibi amusement park, named after Wavre, Limal, and Bierge, to the west of the city centre further up the Dyle. Since then, Walibi has become the largest amusement park in Belgium and spawned similar parks in France and the Netherlands. The park was once known as the best themepark in Europe and has over 1,000,000 visitors per year.
*The Basilica of Our Lady of Basse-Wavre, &quot;Basilique Notre-Dame de Basse-Wavre&quot; is a centre of pilgrimage for Roman Catholics.

==Folklore==
*The &quot;Jeu de Jean et Alice&quot; is a remake of a medieval play, more exactly a spoken, sung, and danced dialog between Jean and Alice, Lords of Wavre, and the city&#x27;s population. The play commemorates the granting of the charter to the city in 1222; it is now an elaborate production (with more than 500 participants) that takes place every five years.
*Since about 200 years ago, the &quot;Grand Tour&quot;, a religious procession takes place every year on the Sunday that follows June 24, feast of St John the Baptist, patron saint of the city.
*The city&#x27;s carnival includes a handful of traditional giants that take part in the festivities.

==Climate==

==Infrastructure==
Wavre is the location of the Wavre Transmitter, a broadcasting facility for shortwave, medium wave, FM and TV of the Belgian broadcasting society. As aerial for medium wave a guyed steel framework mast is used. It is the third tallest structure in Belgium. The aerials for FM and TV are on a free standing lattice tower. On 13 October 1983 a storm destroyed the main transmission mast for TV transmission.

Basse-Wavre railway station (&quot;Gare de Basse-Wavre&quot;) is located in Basse-Wavre (&quot;lower Wavre&quot;) a suburb to the east of the city centre and lower down the Dyle.

==Sports==

<text>Adam Ferguson, (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Adhamh MacFhearghais&quot;), also known as Ferguson of Raith (1 July N.S. /20 June O.S. 1723 – 22 February 1816), was a Scottish philosopher and historian of the Scottish Enlightenment.

Ferguson was sympathetic to traditional societies, such as the Highlands, for producing courage and loyalty. He criticized commercial society as making men weak, dishonourable and unconcerned for their community. Ferguson has been called &quot;the father of modern sociology&quot; for his contributions to the early development of the discipline. His best-known work is his &quot;Essay on the History of Civil Society&quot;.

==Biography==
Born at Logierait in Atholl, Perthshire, Scotland, the son of Rev Adam Ferguson, he received his education at Logierait Parish School, Perth Grammar School, and at the University of Edinburgh and the University of St Andrews (MA 1742). In 1745, owing to his knowledge of Gaelic, he gained appointment as deputy chaplain of the 43rd (afterwards the 42nd) regiment (the Black Watch), the licence to preach being granted him by special dispensation, although he had not completed the required six years of theological study.

It remains a matter of debate as to whether, at the Battle of Fontenoy (1745), Ferguson fought in the ranks throughout the day, and refused to leave the field, though ordered to do so by his colonel. Nevertheless, he certainly did well, becoming principal chaplain in 1746. He continued attached to the regiment till 1754, when, disappointed at not obtaining a living, he left the clergy and resolved to devote himself to literary pursuits.

After residing in Leipzig for a time, he returned to Edinburgh where in January 1757 he succeeded David Hume as librarian to the Faculty of Advocates (see Advocates&#x27; Library), but soon relinquished this office on becoming tutor in the family of the Earl of Bute. In 1759 Ferguson became professor of natural philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, and in 1764 transferred to the chair of &quot;pneumatics&quot; (mental philosophy) and moral philosophy.

In 1767, he published his &quot;Essay on the History of Civil Society&quot;, which was well received and translated into several European languages. In the mid-1770s he travelled again to the Continent and met Voltaire. His membership of The Poker Club is recorded in its minute book of 1776.

In 1776, appeared his anonymous pamphlet on the American Revolution in opposition to Dr Richard Price&#x27;s &quot;Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty&quot;, in which he sympathised with the views of the British legislature. In 1778 Ferguson was appointed secretary to the Carlisle Peace Commission which endeavoured, but without success, to negotiate an arrangement with the revolted colonies.

In 1780, he wrote the article &quot;History&quot; for the second edition of Encyclopædia Britannica. The article is 40 pages long and replaced the article in the first edition, which was only one paragraph.

In 1783, appeared his &quot;History of the Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic&quot;, it became very popular and went through several editions. Ferguson believed that the history of the Roman Republic during the period of their greatness formed a practical illustration of those ethical and political doctrines which he studied especially. The history reads well and impartially, and displays conscientious use of sources. The influence of the author&#x27;s military experience shows itself in certain portions of the narrative. Tired of teaching, he resigned his professorship in 1785, and devoted himself to the revision of his lectures, which he published (1792) under the title of &quot;Principles of Moral and Political Science&quot;.

In his seventieth year, Ferguson, intending to prepare a new edition of the history, visited Italy and some of the principal cities of Europe, where he was received with honour by learned societies. From 1795 he resided successively at Neidpath Castle near Peebles, at Hallyards on Manor Water, and at St Andrews, where he died on 22 February 1816. He is buried in the churchyard of St Andrews Cathedral, against the east wall. His large mural monument includes a carved profile portrait in marble.

==Ethics==
In his ethical system Ferguson treats man as a social being, illustrating his doctrines by political examples. As a believer in the progression of the human race, he placed the principle of moral approbation in the attainment of perfection. Victor Cousin criticised Ferguson&#x27;s speculations (see his &quot;Cours d&#x27;histoire de la philosophie morale an dix-huitième siècle&quot;, pt. II., 1839–1840):

We find in his method the wisdom and circumspection of the Scottish school, with something more masculine and decisive in the results. The principle of perfection is a new one, at once more rational and comprehensive than benevolence and sympathy, which in our view places Ferguson as a moralist above all his predecessors.

By this principle Ferguson attempted to reconcile all moral systems. With Thomas Hobbes and Hume he admits the power of self-interest or utility, and makes it enter into morals as the law of self-preservation. Francis Hutcheson&#x27;s theory of universal benevolence and Adam Smith&#x27;s idea of mutual sympathy (now empathy) he combines under the law of society. But, as these laws appear as the means rather than the end of human destiny, they remain subordinate to a supreme end, and the supreme end of perfection.

In the political part of his system Ferguson follows Montesquieu, and pleads the cause of well-regulated liberty and free government. His contemporaries, with the exception of Hume, regarded his writings as of great importance (see Sir Leslie Stephen, &quot;English Thought in the Eighteenth Century&quot;, Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 214). Ferguson shared his republican contemporaries&#x27; fear that imperial expansion would undermine the liberty of a state, but he saw representative institutions as a solution to the dangers posed by an expanding state. He defended the British Empire, but argued that political representation was key to prevent it from becoming tyrannical.

==Social thought==
Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on the History of Civil Society&quot; (1767) drew on classical authors and contemporary travel literature, to analyze modern commercial society with a critique of its abandonment of civic and communal virtues. Central themes in Ferguson&#x27;s theory of citizenship are conflict, play, political participation and military valor. He emphasized the ability to put oneself in another&#x27;s shoes, saying &quot;fellow-feeling&quot; was so much an &quot;appurtenance of human nature&quot; as to be a &quot;characteristic of the species.&quot; Like his friends Adam Smith and David Hume as well as other Scottish intellectuals, he stressed the importance of the spontaneous order; that is, that coherent and even effective outcomes might result from the uncoordinated actions of many individuals.

Ferguson saw history as a two-tiered synthesis of natural history and social history, to which all humans belong. Natural history is created by God; so are humans, who are progressive. Social history is, in accordance with this natural progress, made by humans, and because of that factor it experiences occasional setbacks. But in general, humans are empowered by God to pursue progress in social history. Humans live not for themselves but for God&#x27;s providential plan. He emphasized aspects of medieval chivalry as ideal masculine characteristics. British gentleman and young men were advised to dispense with aspects of politeness considered too feminine, such as the constant desire to please, and to adopt less superficial qualities that suggested inner virtue and courtesy toward the &#x27;fairer sex.&#x27;

Ferguson was a leading advocate of the Idea of Progress. He believed that the growth of a commercial society through the pursuit of individual self-interest could promote a self-sustaining progress. Yet paradoxically Ferguson also believed that such commercial growth could foster a decline in virtue and thus ultimately lead to a collapse similar to Rome&#x27;s. Ferguson, a devout Presbyterian, resolved the apparent paradox by placing both developments in the context of a divinely ordained plan that mandated both progress and human free will. For Ferguson, the knowledge that humanity gains through its actions, even those actions resulting in temporary retrogression, form an intrinsic part of its progressive, asymptotic movement toward an ultimately unobtainable perfectibility.

Ferguson was influenced by classical humanism and such writers as Tacitus, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Thomas Hobbes. The fellow members of Edinburgh&#x27;s Select Society, which included David Hume and Adam Smith, were also major influences. Ferguson believed that civilization is largely about laws that restrict our independence as individuals but provide liberty in the sense of security and justice. He warned that social chaos usually leads to despotism. The members of civil society give up their liberty-as-autonomy, which savages possess, in exchange for liberty-as-security, or civil liberty. Montesquieu used a similar argument.

Smith emphasized capital accumulation as the driver of growth, but Ferguson suggested innovation and technical advance were more important, and he is therefore in some ways more in line with modern thinking. According to Smith, commerce tends to make men &#x27;dastardly&#x27;. This foreshadows a theme Ferguson, borrowing freely from Smith, took up to criticize capitalism. Ferguson&#x27;s critique of commercial society went far beyond that of Smith, and influenced Hegel and Marx.

The &quot;Essay&quot; has been seen as an innovative attempt to reclaim the tradition of civic republican citizenship in modern Britain, and an influence on the ideas of republicanism held by the American Founding Fathers.

==Personal life==
He married Katherine Burnett in 1767. Ferguson was first cousin, close friend and colleague to Joseph Black M.D and Katie Burnett was Black&#x27;s niece. They produced seven children the eldest Adam Ferguson (British Army officer) close friend to Sir Walter Scott, followed by James, Joseph, John, Isabella, Mary and Margaret. John (John MacPherson Ferguson) was a Rear Admiral in the Royal Navy.

Ferguson suffered an attack of paralysis in 1780 but fully recovered and became a vegetarian for the rest of his life. Ferguson also abstained from alcoholic drink. He did not dine out unless with his first cousin and great friend Joseph Black.

<text>The State Hermitage Museum () is a museum of art and culture in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It was founded in 1764 when Empress Catherine the Great acquired a collection of paintings from the Berlin merchant Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky. The museum celebrates the anniversary of its founding each year on 7 December, Saint Catherine&#x27;s Day. It has been open to the public since 1852. &quot;The Art Newspaper&quot; ranked the museum 10th in their list of the most visited art museums, with 2,812,913 visitors in 2022. 

Its collections, of which only a small part is on permanent display, comprise over three million items (the numismatic collection accounts for about one-third of them). The collections occupy a large complex of six historic buildings along Palace Embankment, including the Winter Palace, a former residence of Russian emperors. Apart from them, the Menshikov Palace, Museum of Porcelain, Storage Facility at Staraya Derevnya, and the eastern wing of the General Staff Building are also part of the museum. The museum has several exhibition centers abroad. The Hermitage is a federal state property. Since July 1992, the director of the museum has been Mikhail Piotrovsky.

Of the six buildings in the main museum complex, five—namely the Winter Palace, Small Hermitage, Old Hermitage, New Hermitage, and Hermitage Theatre—are all open to the public. The entrance ticket for foreign tourists costs more than the fee paid by citizens of Russia and Belarus. However, entrance is free of charge the third Thursday of every month for all visitors, and free daily for students and children. The museum is closed on Mondays. The entrance for individual visitors is located in the Winter Palace, accessible from the Courtyard.

==Etymology==
A hermitage is the dwelling of a hermit or recluse. The word derives from Old French &quot;hermit&quot;, &quot;ermit&quot; &quot;hermit, recluse&quot;, from Late Latin &quot;eremita&quot;, from Greek &quot;eremites&quot;, that means &quot;people who live alone&quot;, which is in turn derived from ἐρημός (&quot;erēmos&quot;), &quot;desert&quot;.

==Buildings==
Originally, the only building housing the collection was the &quot;Small Hermitage&quot;. Today, the Hermitage Museum encompasses many buildings on the Palace Embankment and its neighbourhoods. Apart from the Small Hermitage, the museum now also includes the &quot;Old Hermitage&quot; (also called &quot;Large Hermitage&quot;), the &quot;New Hermitage&quot;, the &quot;Hermitage Theatre&quot;, and the &quot;Winter Palace&quot;, the former main residence of the Russian tsars. In recent years, the Hermitage has expanded to the General Staff Building on the Palace Square facing the Winter Palace, and the Menshikov Palace.
==Collections==

The Western European Art collection includes European paintings, sculpture, and applied art from the 13th to the 20th centuries. 

===Egyptian antiquities===
Since 1940, the Egyptian collection, dating back to 1852 and including the former Castiglione Collection, has occupied a large hall on the ground floor in the eastern part of the Winter Palace. 

===Classical antiquities===
The collection of classical antiquities occupies most of the ground floor of the Old and New Hermitage buildings. The interiors of the ground floor were designed by German architect Leo von Klenze in the Greek revival style in the early 1850s, using painted polished stucco and columns of natural marble and granite. 

The Room of the Great Vase in the western wing features the high Kolyvan Vase, weighing , made of jasper in 1843 and installed before the walls were erected. While the western wing was designed for exhibitions, the rooms on the ground floor in the eastern wing of the New Hermitage, now also hosting exhibitions, were originally intended for libraries. 

The collection of classical antiquities features Greek artifacts from the third millennium – fifth century BC, ancient Greek pottery, items from the Greek cities of the North Pontic Greek colonies, Hellenistic sculpture and jewellery, including engraved gems and cameos, such as the famous Gonzaga Cameo, Italic art from the 9th to second century BC, Roman marble and bronze sculpture and applied art from the first century BC to fourth century AD, including copies of Classical and Hellenistic Greek sculptures. One of the highlights of the collection is the Tauride Venus, which, according to latest research, is an original Hellenistic Greek sculpture rather than a Roman copy as it was thought before. There are, however, only a few pieces of authentic Classical Greek sculpture and sepulchral monuments.

===Prehistoric art===
On the ground floor in the western wing of the Winter Palace the collections of prehistoric artifacts and the culture and art of the Caucasus are located, as well as the second treasure gallery. The prehistoric artifacts date from the Paleolithic to the Iron Age and were excavated all over Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union and Russian Empire. Among them is a renowned collection of the art and culture of nomadic tribes of the Altai from Pazyryk and Bashadar sites, including the world&#x27;s oldest surviving knotted-pile carpet and a well-preserved wooden chariot, both from the 4th–3rd centuries BC. The Caucasian exhibition includes a collection of Urartu artifacts from Armenia and Western Armenia. Many of them were excavated at Teishebaini under the supervision of Boris Piotrovsky, former director of the Hermitage Museum.

===Jewelry and decorative art===
Four small rooms on the ground floor, enclosed in the middle of the New Hermitage between the room displaying Classical Antiquities, comprise the first treasure gallery, featuring western jewellery from the 4th millennium BC to the early 20th century AD. The second treasure gallery, located on the ground floor in the southwest corner of the Winter Palace, features jewellery from the Pontic steppes, Caucasus and Asia, in particular Scythian and Sarmatian gold. 
Pavilion Hall, designed by Andrei Stackenschneider in 1858, occupies the first floor of the Northern Pavilion in the Small Hermitage. It features the 18th-century golden Peacock Clock by James Cox and a collection of mosaics. Two galleries spanning the west side of the Small Hermitage from the Northern to Southern Pavilion house an exhibition of Western European decorative and applied art from the 12th to 15th century and the fine art of the Low Countries from the 15th and 16th centuries.

===Italian Renaissance===
The rooms on the first floor of the Old Hermitage were designed by Andrei Stakenschneider in revival styles in between 1851 and 1860, although the design survives only in some of them. They feature works of Italian Renaissance artists, including Giorgione, Titian, Veronese, as well as &quot;Benois Madonna&quot; and &quot;Madonna Litta&quot; attributed to Leonardo da Vinci or his school.
The Italian Renaissance galleries continues in the eastern wing of the New Hermitage with paintings, sculpture, majolica and tapestry from Italy of the 15th–16th centuries, including &quot;Conestabile Madonna&quot; and &quot;Madonna with Beardless St. Joseph&quot; by Raphael.

===Italian and Spanish fine art===
The first floor of New Hermitage contains three large interior spaces in the center of the museum complex with red walls and lit from above by skylights. These are adorned with 19th-century Russian lapidary works and feature Italian and Spanish canvases of the 16th–18th centuries, including Veronese, Giambattista Pittoni, Tintoretto, Velázquez and Murillo.

===Knights&#x27; Hall===
The Knights&#x27; Hall, a large room in the eastern part of the New Hermitage originally designed in the Greek revival style for the display of coins, now hosts a collection of Western European arms and armour from the 15th–17th centuries, part of the Hermitage Arsenal collection. 
The Gallery of the History of Ancient Painting adjoins the Knights&#x27; Hall and also flanks the skylight rooms. It was designed by Leo von Klenze in the Greek revival style as a prelude to the museum and features neoclassical marble sculptures by Antonio Canova and his followers. In the middle, the gallery opens to the main staircase of the New Hermitage, which served as the entrance to the museum before the October Revolution of 1917, but is now closed.

===Dutch Golden Age and Flemish Baroque===

The rooms and galleries along the southern facade and in the western wing of the New Hermitage are now entirely devoted to Dutch Golden Age and Flemish Baroque painting of the 17th century, including the large collections of Van Dyck, Rubens and Rembrandt.

===German, Swiss, British and French fine art===
The first floor rooms on the southern facade of the Winter Palace are occupied by the collections of German fine art of the 16th century and French fine art of the 15th–18th centuries, including paintings by Poussin, Lorrain, Watteau. The collections of French decorative and applied art from the 17th–18th centuries and British applied and fine art from the 16th–19th century, including Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds, are on display in nearby rooms facing the courtyard. 

===Russian art===
The richly decorated interiors of the first floor of the Winter Palace on its eastern, northern and western sides are part of the Russian culture collection and host the exhibitions of Russian art from the 11th-19th centuries. 

===French Neoclassical, Impressionist, and post-Impressionist art===

French Neoclassical, Impressionist and post-Impressionist art, including works by Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh and Gauguin, are displayed on the fourth floor of the Eastern Wing of the General Staff Building. Also displayed are paintings by Camille Pissarro (Boulevard Montmartre, Paris), Paul Cézanne (Mount Sainte-Victoire), Alfred Sisley, Henri Morel, and Degas.

===Modern, German Romantic and other 19th–20th century art===

Modern art is displayed in the General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg). It features Matisse, Derain and other fauvists, Picasso, Malevich, Petrocelli, Kandinsky, Giacomo Manzù, Giorgio Morandi and Rockwell Kent. A large room is devoted to the German Romantic art of the 19th century, including several paintings by Caspar David Friedrich. The second floor of the Western wing features collections of the Oriental art (from China, India, Mongolia, Tibet, Central Asia, Byzantium and Near East).

==History==

===Origins: Catherine&#x27;s collection===
Catherine the Great started her art collection in 1764 by purchasing paintings from Berlin merchant Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky. He assembled the collection for Frederick II of Prussia, who ultimately refused to purchase it. Thus, Gotzkowsky provided 225 or 317 paintings (conflicting accounts list both numbers), mainly Flemish and Dutch, as well as others, including 90 not precisely identified, to the Russian crown. The collection consisted of Rembrandt (13 paintings), Rubens (11 paintings), Jacob Jordaens (7 paintings), Anthony van Dyck (5 paintings), Paolo Veronese (5 paintings), Frans Hals (3 paintings, including &quot;Portrait of a Young Man with a Glove&quot;), Raphael (2 paintings), Holbein (2 paintings), Titian (1 painting), Jan Steen (&quot;The Idlers&quot;), Hendrik Goltzius, Dirck van Baburen, Hendrick van Balen and Gerrit van Honthorst. Perhaps some of the most famous and notable artworks that were a part of Catherine&#x27;s original purchase from Gotzkowsky were &quot;Danaë&quot;, painted by Rembrandt in 1636; &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot;, painted by Rembrandt in 1624; and &quot;Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Glove&quot;, painted by Frans Hals in 1650. These paintings remain in the Hermitage collection today.
In 1764, Catherine commissioned Yury Felten to build an extension on the east of the Winter Palace which he completed in 1766. Later it became the Southern Pavilion of the Small Hermitage. From 1767 to 1769, French architect Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe built the Northern Pavilion on the Neva embankment. Between 1767 and 1775, the extensions were connected by galleries, where Catherine put her collections. The entire neoclassical building is now known as the Small Hermitage. During the time of Catherine, the Hermitage was not a public museum and few people were allowed to view its holdings. Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe also rebuilt rooms in the second story of the south-east corner block that was originally built for Elizabeth and later occupied by Peter III. The largest room in this particular apartment was the Audience Chamber (also called the Throne Hall) which consisted of 227 square meters.

The Hermitage buildings served as a home and workplace for nearly a thousand people, including the Imperial family. In addition to this, they also served as an extravagant showplace for all kinds of Russian relics and displays of wealth prior to the art collections. Many events were held in these buildings including masquerades for the nobility, grand receptions and ceremonies for state and government officials. The &quot;Hermitage complex&quot; was a creation of Catherine&#x27;s that allowed all kinds of festivities to take place in the palace, the theatre and even the museum of the Hermitage. This helped solidify the Hermitage as not only a dwelling place for the Imperial family, but also as an important symbol and memorial to the imperial Russian state. Today, the palace and the museum are one and the same. In Catherine&#x27;s day, the Winter Palace served as a central part of what was called the Palace Square. The Palace Square served as St. Petersburg&#x27;s nerve center by linking it to all the city&#x27;s most important buildings. The presence of the Palace Square was extremely significant to the urban development of St. Petersburg, and while it became less of a nerve center later into the 20th century, its symbolic value was still very much preserved.

Catherine acquired the best collections offered for sale by the heirs of prominent collectors. In 1769, she purchased Brühl&#x27;s collection, consisting of over 600 paintings and a vast number of prints and drawings, in Saxony. Three years later, she bought Crozat&#x27;s collection of paintings in France with the assistance of Denis Diderot. Next, in 1779, she acquired the collection of 198 paintings that once belonged to Robert Walpole in London followed by a collection of 119 paintings in Paris from Count Baudouin in 1781. Catherine&#x27;s favorite items to collect were believed to be engraved gems and cameos. At the inaugural exhibit of the Hermitage, opened by Charles, Prince of Wales in November 2000, there was an entire gallery devoted to representing and displaying Catherine&#x27;s favorite items. In this gallery her cameos are displayed along with cabinet made by David Roentgen, which holds her engraved gems. As the symbol of Minerva was frequently used and favored by Catherine to represent her patronage of the arts, a cameo of Catherine as Minerva is also displayed here. This particular cameo was created for her by her daughter-in-law, the Grand Duchess Maria Fyodorovna. This is only a small representation of Catherine&#x27;s vast collection of many antique and contemporary engraved gems and cameos.
The collection soon overgrew the building. In her lifetime, Catherine acquired 4,000 paintings from the old masters, 38,000 books, 10,000 engraved gems, 10,000 drawings, 16,000 coins and medals, and a natural history collection filling two galleries, so in 1771 she commissioned Yury Felten to build another major extension. The neoclassical building was completed in 1787 and has come to be known as the Large Hermitage or Old Hermitage. Catherine also gave the name of the Hermitage to her private theatre, built nearby between 1783 and 1787 by the Italian architect Giacomo Quarenghi. In London in 1787, Catherine acquired the collection of sculpture that belonged to Lyde Browne, mostly Ancient Roman marbles. Catherine used them to adorn the Catherine Palace and park in Tsarskoye Selo, but later they became the core of the Classical Antiquities collection of the Hermitage. From 1787 to 1792, Quarenghi designed and built a wing along the Winter Canal with the Raphael Loggias to replicate the loggia in the Apostolic Palace in Rome designed by Donato Bramante and frescoed by Raphael. 

Catherine&#x27;s collection of at least 4,000 paintings came to rival the older and more prestigious museums of Western Europe. Catherine took great pride in her collection and actively participated in extensive competitive art gathering and collecting that was prevalent in European royal court culture. Through her art collection she gained European acknowledgment and acceptance and portrayed Russia as an enlightened society. Catherine went on to invest much of her identity in being a patron of the arts. She was particularly fond of the Roman deity Minerva, whose characteristics according to classical tradition are military prowess, wisdom, and patronage of the arts. Using the title Catherine the Minerva, she created new institutions of literature and culture and also participated in many projects of her own, mostly play writing. The representation of Catherine alongside Minerva would come to be a tradition of enlightened patronage in Russia.

===Expansion in the 19th century===

In 1815, Alexander I of Russia purchased 38 pictures from the heirs of Joséphine de Beauharnais, most of which had been looted by the French in Kassel during the war. The Hermitage collection of Rembrandts was then considered the largest in the world. Also among Alexander&#x27;s purchases from Josephine&#x27;s estate were the first four sculptures by the neoclassical Italian sculptor Antonio Canova to enter the Hermitage collection.
Between 1840 and 1843, Vasily Stasov redesigned the interiors of the Southern Pavilion of the Small Hermitage. In 1838, Nicholas I commissioned the neoclassical German architect Leo von Klenze to design a building for the public museum. Space for the museum was made next to the Small Hermitage by the demolition of the Shepelev Palace and royal stables. The construction was overseen by the Russian architects Vasily Stasov and Nikolai Yefimov from 1842 to 1851 and incorporated Quarenghi&#x27;s wing with the Raphael Loggias.

The New Hermitage was opened to the public on 5 February 1852. In the same year the Egyptian Collection of the Hermitage Museum emerged and was particularly enriched by items given by the Duke of Leuchtenberg, Nicholas I&#x27;s son-in-law. Meanwhile, from 1851 to 1860, the interiors of the Old Hermitage were redesigned by Andrei Stackensneider to accommodate the State Assembly, Cabinet of Ministers and state apartments. Stakenschneider created the Pavilion Hall in the Northern Pavilion of the Small Hermitage from 1851 to 1858.

In 1861, the Hermitage purchased from the Papal government part of the Giampietro Campana collection, which consisted mostly classical antiquities. These included over 500 vases, 200 bronzes and a number of marble statues. The Hermitage acquired &quot;Madonna Litta&quot;, which was then attributed to Leonardo, in 1865, and Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Connestabile Madonna&quot; in 1870. In 1884 in Paris, Alexander III of Russia acquired the collection of Alexander Basilewski, featuring European medieval and Renaissance artifacts. In 1885, the Arsenal collection of arms and armour, founded by Alexander I of Russia, was transferred from the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo to the Hermitage. In 1914, Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;Benois Madonna&quot; was added to the collection.

===After the October Revolution===
Immediately after the Revolution of 1917, the Imperial Hermitage and the Winter Palace, the former Imperial residence, were proclaimed state museums and eventually merged.
The range of the Hermitage&#x27;s exhibits was further expanded when private art collections from several palaces of the Russian Tsars and numerous private mansions were nationalized and redistributed among major Soviet state museums. Particularly notable was the influx of old masters from the Catherine Palace, the Alexander Palace, the Stroganov Palace, and the Yusupov Palace, as well as from other palaces of Saint Petersburg and suburbs.

In 1922, a collection of 19th-century European paintings was transferred to the Hermitage from the Academy of Arts. In turn, in 1927 about 500 important paintings were transferred to the Central Museum of old Western art in Moscow at the insistence of the Soviet authorities. 

In 1928, the Soviet government ordered the Hermitage to compile a list of valuable works of art for export. From 1930 to 1934, over two thousand works of art from the Hermitage collection were clandestinely sold at auctions abroad or directly to foreign officials and businesspeople. The sold items included Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Alba Madonna&quot;, Titian&#x27;s &quot;Venus with a Mirror&quot;, and Jan van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Annunciation&quot;, among other world known masterpieces by Botticelli, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, and others. In 1931 Andrew W. Mellon acquired 21 works of art from the Hermitage and later donated them to form a nucleus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. (see also Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings).
With the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, before the Siege of Leningrad started, two trains with a considerable part of the collections were evacuated to Sverdlovsk. Two bombs and a number of shells hit the museum buildings during the siege. The museum opened an exhibition in November 1944. In October 1945 the evacuated collections were brought back, and in November 1945 the museum reopened.

In 1948, 316 works of Impressionist, post-Impressionist, and modern art from the collection of the Museum of New Western Art in Moscow, originating mostly from the nationalized collections of Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov before the war, were transferred to the Hermitage, including works by Matisse and Picasso.

On 15 June 1985, a man later judged insane attacked Rembrandt&#x27;s painting &quot;Danaë&quot;, displayed in the museum. He threw sulfuric acid on the canvas and cut it twice with a knife. The restoration of the painting had been accomplished by Hermitage conservationists by 1997, and &quot;Danaë&quot; is now on display behind armoured glass.

===The Hermitage since 1991===
In 1991, it became known that some paintings looted by the Red Army in Germany in 1945 were held in the Hermitage. But only in October 1994 did the Hermitage officially announce that it had secretly been holding a major trove of French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings from German private collections. The exhibition &quot;Hidden Treasures Revealed&quot;, in which 74 of the paintings were displayed for the first time, was opened on 30 March 1995 in the Nicholas Hall of the Winter Palace and lasted a year. Of the paintings, all but one originated from private rather than state German collections, including 56 paintings from the Otto Krebs collection, as well as the collection of Bernhard Koehler and paintings previously belonging to Otto Gerstenberg and his daughter Margarete Scharf, including the world-famous &quot;Place de la Concorde&quot; by Degas, &quot;In the Garden&quot; by Renoir, and &quot;White House at Night&quot; by Van Gogh. Some of the paintings are now on permanent display in several small rooms in the northeastern corner of the Winter Palace on the first floor.

In 1993, the Russian government gave the eastern wing of the nearby General Staff Building across the Palace Square to the Hermitage and the new exhibition rooms in 1999. Since 2003, the Great Courtyard of the Winter Palace has been open to the public.

In 2003, the Hermitage loaned 142 pieces to the University of Michigan Museum of Art for an exhibition titled &quot;The Romanovs Collect: European Art from the Hermitage&quot;.

In December 2004, the museum discovered another looted work of art: &quot;Venus Disarming Mars&quot; by Rubens was once in the collection of the Rheinsberg Palace near Berlin, and was apparently looted by Soviet troops from the Königsberg Castle in East Prussia in 1945. At the time, Mikhail Piotrovsky said the painting would be cleaned and displayed.

The museum announced in July 2006 that 221 minor items, including jewelry, Orthodox icons, silverware and richly enameled objects, had been stolen. The value of the stolen items was estimated to be approximately $543,000. By the end of 2006 several of the stolen items had been recovered.

In March 2020, Apple released a continuous 5 hour and 19 minute one shot film recorded entirely on an iPhone 11 Pro detailing many rooms of the museum which highlighted not only the artwork, but also the architecture, and live movement pieces interspersed throughout.

==Dependencies==

In recent years, the Hermitage launched several dependencies abroad and domestically.

===Hermitage-Kazan Exhibition Center===
The Hermitage dependency in Kazan (Tatarstan, Russia), opened in 2005. It was created with support from President of the Republic of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaimiev and is a subdivision of the Kazan Kremlin State Historical and Architectural Museum-Park. The museum is situated in the Kazan Kremlin in an edifice previously occupied by the Junker School built in the beginning of the 19th century.

===Ermitage Italia, Ferrara===
Following the prior experiences in London, Las Vegas, Amsterdam and Kazan, the Hermitage foundation decided to create a further branch in Italy with the launch of a national bid. Several northern Italian cities expressed interest such as Verona, Mantua, Ferrara and Turin. In 2007, the honor was awarded to the city of Ferrara which proposed its Castle Estense as the base. Since then, the new institution called &quot;Ermitage Italia&quot; started a research and scientific collaboration with the Hermitage foundation.

===Hermitage-Vyborg Center===

Hermitage-Vyborg Center was opened in June 2010 in Vyborg, Leningrad Oblast.

===Hermitage Exhibition Center, Vladivostok===
A Hermitage branch is due to open in Vladivostok by 2016, and the regional government has allocated more than Rb17.7 million ($558,000) for preliminary reconstruction work on a mansion in Vladivostok&#x27;s historic downtown district to house the satellite.

===Hermitage-Siberia, Omsk===
The Hermitage-Siberia is due to open in Omsk in 2016.

===Guggenheim Hermitage Museum, Vilnius===
In recent years, there have been proposals to open a Vilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum in the capital city of Lithuania. Like the former Las Vegas dependency, the museum is to combine artworks from the Saint Petersburg Hermitage with works from the New York Guggenheim Museum.

===Former dependencies===
The Guggenheim Hermitage Museum in Las Vegas opened on 7 October 2001 and closed on 11 May 2008. The Hermitage Rooms in London&#x27;s Somerset House opened on 25 November 2000. In 2004, the rooms hosted &quot;Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands&quot;, a joint exhibition with the Khalili Collection of Islamic Art. The exhibition was closed permanently in November 2007 due to poor visitor numbers.

The dependency of the Hermitage Museum in Amsterdam was known as the Hermitage Amsterdam, and was located in the former Amstelhof building. It opened on 24 February 2004 in a small building on the Nieuwe Herengracht in Amsterdam, awaiting the closing of the retirement home which still occupied the Amstelhof building until 2007. Between 2007 and 2009, the Amstelhof was renovated and made suitable for the housing of the Amsterdam Hermitage. The Amsterdam Hermitage was opened on 19 June 2009 by President Dmitry Medvedev and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. Following Russia&#x27;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Amsterdam Hermitage severed ties with St. Petersburg, being renamed to &quot;H&#x27;ART Museum&quot; the following year.

===Television===
Russia-K, a Russian national television channel, has been presenting the various art collections of the Hermitage to the general public for years. There are a series of programs that have aired entitled &quot;My Hermitage&quot; that have been particularly successful. All of these programs are organized by the Director of the Hermitage, Professor Mikhail Piotrovsky, and are quite similar to the broadcasts created by Academician Boris Piotrovsky, who is Mikhail&#x27;s father. These programs were first broadcast through the Soviet Union&#x27;s &#x27;First&#x27; channel, airing at the height of the museum&#x27;s boom. During this time, this channel recorded more than three million visitors every year, mostly from the Soviet Union. Another program created by the Hermitage was called &quot;The Treasures of St. Petersburg&quot;, and was broadcast on the St. Petersburg regional television. This program gave insight into what exhibitions were being displayed at the Hermitage.

&quot;Treasures of St Petersburg &amp; The Hermitage&quot;, (2003) a three-part documentary series for Channel 5 in the UK, directed by Graham Addicott and produced by Pille Runk.

&quot;Hermitage Revealed&quot; (2014) is a BBC documentary from Margy Kinmonth. The film tells the story of its journey from imperial palace to state museum, investigating remarkable tales of dedication, devotion, ownership and ultimate sacrifice, showing how the collection came about, how it survived tumultuous revolutionary times and what makes the Hermitage unique today.

<text>Grantchester () is a village and civil parish on the River Cam or Granta in South Cambridgeshire, England. It lies about south of Cambridge.

==Name==
The village of Grantchester is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Grantesete&quot; and &quot;Grauntsethe&quot;. Before, it is also mentioned briefly in book IV, chapter 19 of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;. John de Grauntsete, a lawyer who had a successful career as a judge in Ireland, was born in Grantchester, , and took his surname from his birthplace. The present name derives from the common Old English suffix &quot;&quot; (variously developed as &quot;-cester&quot;, &quot;-caster&quot;, and -&quot;chester&quot;), used in names of forts or fortified cities throughout England.

Grantchester is sometimes identified as the (&quot;Fort Granta&quot;) listed in the &quot;History of the Britons&quot; among the 28 cities of Britain, but the Roman Duroliponte and subsequent major British and Saxon settlements in the area were at Castle Hill in Cambridge, whose Old English name was Grantabrycge. The confusion arises from the lower stretches of the Granta having been renamed the Cam after the city.

==Overview==
Grantchester is said to have the world&#x27;s highest concentration of Nobel Prize winners, most of these presumably being current or retired academics from the nearby University of Cambridge.
Students and tourists often travel from Cambridge by punt to picnic in the meadows or take tea at The Orchard. In 1897, a group of Cambridge students persuaded the owner of Orchard House to serve them tea in its apple orchard, and this became a regular practice. Lodgers at Orchard House included the Edwardian poet Rupert Brooke, who later moved next door to the Old Vicarage. In 1912, while in Berlin, he wrote a poem of homesickness entitled &quot;The Old Vicarage, Grantchester&quot;. The house is currently the home of the Cambridge scientist Mary Archer and her husband, Jeffrey Archer. Grantchester has been the home since 1969 of the sculptor Helaine Blumenfeld OBE.

The footpath to Cambridge that runs beside Grantchester Meadows is nicknamed the Grantchester Grind. &quot;Grantchester Grind&quot; is the title of a 1995 comic novel written by Tom Sharpe. Further upstream is Byron&#x27;s Pool, named after Lord Byron, who is said (by Brooke, at least) to have swum there. The pool is now below a modern weir where the Bourn Brook flows into the River Cam. Byron&#x27;s Pool is a Local Nature Reserve.

==In popular culture==
Grantchester is the subject of &quot;Grantchester Meadows&quot; (composed and performed by Roger Waters) a song by Pink Floyd, with the village being home to band member David Gilmour. A few years later, Gilmour also wrote a song about Grantchester Meadows, called &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot;. The village is also the setting for James Runcie&#x27;s sleuth novels &quot;The Grantchester Mysteries&quot;, adapted as an ITV drama titled &quot;Grantchester&quot; shown in the UK from autumn 2014 and filmed on location in Grantchester.

The village is the subject of Rupert Brooke&#x27;s poem The Old Vicarage, Grantchester.

==Grantchester Church==

The oldest parts of the Church of St Andrew and St Mary (Church of England) date from the twelfth century. The chancel is mid-fourteenth century and the tower is late-fourteenth or early fifteenth century. The porch is sixteenth century. The nave was extensively restored in 1876–1877. The church is a Grade II* listed building. Rachel Rosborough became vicar in 2017.

It also contains the Commonwealth war graves of three British Army soldiers of the First World War and an airman of the Second World War.

==Barrel race==

Every year on Boxing Day (26 December), Grantchester holds an inter-village barrel race which is around 40 minutes long and ends with a hog roast at the Rupert Brooke pub. This tradition dates back to the 1960s.

==Legends==
An underground passage is said to run from the Old Manor house to King&#x27;s College Chapel away. It was said that a fiddler who offered to follow the passage set off playing his fiddle; the music became fainter and fainter, until it was heard no more and the fiddler was never seen or heard of again. This story is told of many supposed tunnels. On a 17th-century map of Grantchester, one of the fields is called Fiddler&#x27;s Close.

<text>The highest-ranking bishops in Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Catholic Church (above major archbishop and primate), the Hussite Church, Church of the East, and some Independent Catholic Churches are termed patriarchs (and in certain cases also &quot;popes&quot; – such as the pope of Rome or pope of Alexandria, and &quot;catholicoi&quot; – such as Catholicos Karekin II, and Baselios Thomas I Catholicos of the East).

The word is derived from Greek πατριάρχης (&quot;patriarchēs&quot;), meaning &quot;chief or father of a family&quot;, a compound of πατριά (&quot;patria&quot;), meaning &quot;family&quot;, and ἄρχειν (&quot;archein&quot;), meaning &quot;to rule&quot;.

Originally, a &quot;patriarch&quot; was a man who exercised autocratic authority as a pater familias over an extended family. The system of such rule of families by senior males is termed patriarchy. Historically, a patriarch has often been the logical choice to act as ethnarch of the community identified with his religious confession within a state or empire of a different creed (such as Christians within the Ottoman Empire). The term developed an ecclesiastical meaning within Christianity. The office and the ecclesiastical circumscription of a Christian patriarch is termed a &quot;patriarchate&quot;.

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are referred to as the three patriarchs of the people of Israel, and the period during which they lived is termed the Patriarchal Age. The word &quot;patriarch&quot; originally acquired its religious meaning in the Septuagint version of the Bible.

==Catholic Church==
===Patriarchs===
In the Catholic Church, the bishop who is head of a particular autonomous church, known in canon law as a church &quot;sui iuris&quot;, is ordinarily a patriarch, though this responsibility can be entrusted to a major archbishop, metropolitan, or other prelate for a number of reasons.

Since the Council of Nicaea, the bishop of Rome has been recognized as the first among patriarchs. That council designated three bishops with this &#x27;supra-Metropolitan&#x27; title: Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch. In the Pentarchy formulated by Justinian I (527–565), the emperor assigned as a patriarchate to the bishop of Rome the whole of Christianized Europe (including almost all of modern Greece), except for the region of Thrace, the areas near Constantinople, and along the coast of the Black Sea. He included in this patriarchate also the western part of North Africa. The jurisdictions of the other patriarchates extended over Roman Asia, and the rest of Africa. Justinian&#x27;s system was given formal ecclesiastical recognition by the Quinisext Council of 692, which the see of Rome has, however, not recognized.

There were at the time bishops of other apostolic sees that operated with patriarchal authority beyond the borders of the Roman Empire, such as the catholicos of Selucia-Ctesephon.

Today, the patriarchal heads of Catholic autonomous churches are:
* The Patriarch of Rome (Pope), as head of the Latin Church
* The Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria (Pope) and head of the Coptic Catholic Church, recognised 1824
*The Maronite Catholic Patriarch of Antioch and All the East and head of the Maronite Church, recognised 685
* The Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, of Alexandria and of Jerusalem, head of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church; in his case, Antioch is the actual and sole patriarchate, Alexandria and Jerusalem are just titular (once residential) patriarchates vested in his see.
*The Syriac Catholic Patriarch of Antioch and All the East and head of the Syriac Catholic Church
*The Chaldean Catholic Patriarch of Baghdad and head of the Chaldean Catholic Church, recognised 1553
*The Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia and head of the Armenian Catholic Church, recognised 1742
Four more of the Eastern Catholic Churches are headed by a prelate known as a &quot;Major Archbishop,&quot; a title essentially equivalent to that of Patriarch and originally created by Pope Paul VI in 1963 for Josyf Slipyj.

===Minor Latin patriarchates===
Minor patriarchs do not have jurisdiction over other metropolitan bishops. The title is granted purely as an honour for various historical reasons. They take precedence after the heads of autonomous churches in full communion, whether pope, patriarch, or major archbishop. 
*The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, established 1099.
*The Patriarch of the East Indies, a titular patriarchal see, united to Goa and Daman, established 1886.
*The Patriarch of Lisbon, established 1716.
*The Patriarch of Venice, established 1451.

====Historical Latin patriarchates====
* The Patriarch of Aquileia – with rival line of succession moved to Grado – dissolved in 1752.
* The Patriarch of Grado – in 1451 merged with the Bishopric of Castello and Venice to form the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Venice (later a residential Patriarchate itself).
* The Patriarch of the West Indies – a titular patriarchal see, vacant since 1963.
* The Latin Patriarch of Antioch – title abolished in 1964.
* The titular Latin Patriarch of Alexandria – title abolished in 1964.
* The Latin Patriarch of Constantinople – title abolished in 1964.
* The Latin Patriarchate of Ethiopia – 1555 to 1663, never effective, only held by Iberian Jesuits

==== Patriarch as title &quot;ad personam&quot; ====
The pope can confer the rank of patriarch without any see, upon an individual archbishop, as happened on 24 February 1676 to Alessandro Crescenzi, of the Somascans, former Latin Titular Patriarch of Alexandria (19 January 1671 – retired 27 May 1675), who nevertheless resigned the title on 9 January 1682.

====&quot;Patriarch of the West&quot;====

In theological and other scholarly literature of the Early Modern period, the title &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot; (Latin: &quot;Patriarcha Occidentis&quot;; Greek: Πατριάρχης τῆς Δύσεως) was mainly used as designation for the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome over the Latin Church in the West.

The title was not included in the 2006 &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;. On 22 March 2006, the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity offered an explanation for the decision to remove the title. It stated that the title &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot; had become &quot;obsolete and practically unusable&quot; when the term &quot;the West&quot; comprises Australia, New Zealand and North America in addition to Western Europe, and that it was &quot;pointless to insist on maintaining it&quot; given that, since the Second Vatican Council, the Latin Church, for which &quot;the West&quot; is an equivalent, has been organized as a number of episcopal conferences and their international groupings. The title was reintroduced in the 2024 edition of &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;. No explanation was provided for its reintroduction.

As the &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot;, the pope issues the &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; for the Latin Church. During the Synod of Bishops on the Middle East in 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appeared, as patriarch of the Latin Church, with the other patriarchs, but without the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, though he was present at the same synod.

===Current and historical Catholic patriarchates===
== Eastern Christianity ==

===Eastern Orthodox===

*The five ancient Patriarchates, the Pentarchy, listed in order of preeminence ranked by the Quinisext Council in 692: 
*The five junior Patriarchates created after the consolidation of the Pentarchy, in chronological order of their recognition as Patriarchates by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople:

===Patriarchs outside the Eastern Orthodox Communion===
===Oriental Orthodox Churches===

===Church of the East===
Catholicose of the East is the title that held by the ecclesiastical heads of the Church of the East, which is now divided into:
*Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East.
*Catholicos-Patriarchs of the Ancient Church of the East (since 1964)

== Other Christian denominations ==
The title of &quot;Patriarch&quot; is assumed also by for leaders and church officers of certain Christian denominations, including some of the following:

;Hussite
*The Patriarch of the Czechoslovak Hussite Church mainly in the Czech Republic and also some parts of Slovakia.

;Independent Catholic
*The Patriarch of the Catholic Apostolic Church of Antioch.
*The Patriarch of the Apostolic Catholic Church in the Philippines.
*The Patriarch of the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church in Brazil (Not officially used, but described in a similarly holy level).
*The Patriarch of the Venezuelan Catholic Apostolic Church in Venezuela.

;Independent Eastern Catholic 
*The Patriarch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine.

;Independent Eastern Orthodox
*The Patriarch of the American Orthodox Catholic Church.

;Independent Oriental Orthodox
*The Patriarch of the British Orthodox Church.

;Protestant
*The Patriarch of the International Communion of the Charismatic Episcopal Church.

;Latter Day Saint movement

In the Latter Day Saint movement, a patriarch is one who has been ordained to the office of patriarch in the Melchizedek priesthood. The term is considered synonymous with the term evangelist, a term favored by the Community of Christ. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one of the patriarch&#x27;s primary responsibilities is to give patriarchal blessings, as Jacob did to his twelve sons according to the Old Testament. Patriarchs are typically assigned in each stake and possess the title for life.

==Manichaeism ==
The term patriarch has also been used for the leader of the extinct Manichaean religion, initially based at Ctesiphon (near modern-day Baghdad) and later at Samarkand.

<text>James Payn (; 28 February 1830 – 25 March 1898) was an English novelist and editor. Among the periodicals he edited were &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Journal&quot; in Edinburgh and the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot; in London.

==Family==
Payn&#x27;s father, William Payn (1774/1775–1840), was clerk to the Thames Commissioners, and at one time treasurer to the county of Berkshire. Payn was educated at Eton and then entered the Military Academy at Woolwich, but his health was unequal to a military career and he proceeded in 1847 to Trinity College, Cambridge. There he was among the most popular men and served as president of the Union. Before going to Cambridge he had published some verses in Leigh Hunt&#x27;s Journal, and while still an undergraduate put out a volume of &quot;Stories from Boccaccio&quot; in 1852 and one of &quot;Poems&quot; in 1853.

In the year Payn left Cambridge, he met and soon married Miss Louisa Adelaide Edlin (born 1830 or 1831), sister of Judge Sir Peter Edlin, later chairman of the London Quarter Sessions. They had nine children, the third of whom, Alicia Isabel (died 1898), married &quot;The Times&quot; editor George Earle Buckle.

==Editor and novelist==
Payn then settled down in the Lake District to a literary career and contributed regularly to &quot;Household Words&quot; and &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Journal&quot;. In 1858 he moved to Edinburgh to act as joint editor of the latter, and became its sole editor in 1860 with much success for 15 years. Meanwhile he moved to London in 1861. In the &quot;Journal&quot; he published in 1864 his most popular story, &quot;Lost Sir Massingberd&quot;. Thereafter he was engaged in writing novels, including &quot;Richard Arbour or the Family Scapegrace&quot; (1861), &quot;Married Beneath Him&quot; (1865), &quot;Carlyon&#x27;s Year&quot; (1868), &quot;A County Family&quot; (1869), &quot;By Proxy&quot; (1878), &quot;A Confidential Agent&quot; (1880), &quot;Thicker Than Water&quot; (1883), &quot;The Canon&#x27;s Ward&quot; (1883), &quot;A Grape from a Thorn&quot;, &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; (1885), and &quot;The Heir of the Ages&quot; (1886).

In 1883 Payn succeeded Leslie Stephen as editor of the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot; and continued there until his health broke down in 1896. He was also literary adviser to Messrs Smith, Elder &amp; Company. His publications included a &quot;Handbook to the English Lakes&quot; (1859), and various volumes of essays: &quot;Maxims by a Man of the World&quot; (1869), &quot;Some Private Views&quot; (1881), &quot;Some Literary Recollections&quot; (1884). His posthumous work &quot;The Backwater of Life&quot; (1899) revealed much of his personality through kindly, sensible reflections on familiar topics. He died in London on 25 March 1898. A biographical introduction to &quot;The Backwater of Life&quot; was provided by Sir Leslie Stephen.

<doc id="175416" wikidata="Q1757630" url="?curid=175416" title="Piers Plowman">
<text>Piers Plowman (written 1370–86; possibly ) or &quot;Visio Willelmi de Petro Ploughman&quot; (&quot;William&#x27;s Vision of Piers Plowman&quot;) is a Middle English allegorical narrative poem by William Langland. It is written in un-rhymed, alliterative verse divided into sections called (Latin for &quot;step&quot;).

Like the Pearl Poet&#x27;s &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; is considered by many critics to be one of the greatest works of English literature of the Middle Ages, preceding and even influencing Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; contains the first known reference to a literary tradition of Robin Hood tales.

There exist three distinct versions of the poem, which scholars refer to as the A-, B-, and C-texts. The B-text is the most widely edited and translated version; it revises and extends the A-text by over four thousand lines.

==Summary==
The poem, a mix of theological allegory and social satire, concerns the narrator/dreamer&#x27;s quest for the true Christian life in the context of medieval Catholicism. This journey takes place within a series of dream visions; the dreamer seeks, among other things, the allegorical characters Dowel (&quot;Do-Well&quot;), Dobet (&quot;Do-Better&quot;), and Dobest (&quot;Do-Best&quot;). The poem is divided into &quot;passus&quot; (&#x27;steps&#x27;), the divisions between which vary by version.

The following summary is based on the B-version of the poem.

===Vision 1===

Prologue:
The poem begins in the Malvern Hills between Worcestershire and Herefordshire. A man named Will (which can be understood either simply as a personal name or as an allegory for a person&#x27;s will, in the sense of &#x27;desire, intention&#x27;) falls asleep and has a vision of a tower set upon a hill and a fortress (&quot;&quot;) in a deep valley; between these symbols of heaven and hell is a &#x27;fair field full of folk&#x27;, representing the world of humankind. A satirical account of different sections of society follows, along with a dream-like fable representing the King as a cat and his people as rodents who consider whether to bell the cat.

Passus 1:
Holy Church visits Will and explains the tower of Truth, and discusses Truth more generally.

Passus 2:
Will sees Lady Mede (&#x27;payment&#x27;) and finds out about her planned marriage to False.

Passus 3:
Lady Mede travels to the royal court; the King proposes she marry Conscience; but Conscience denounces her.

Passus 4:
Conscience and Reason convince the King not to marry Mede to False. Will wakes up.

===Vision 2===

Passus 5:
Will falls back to sleep. Reason gives a sermon to the Field of Folk and the people decide to repent. The Seven Deadly Sins make confession and in penance attempt to go on pilgrimage to St Truth. They get lost, and Piers Plowman makes his first appearance: he will help the penitents if they help him plough his half-acre.

Passus 6:
Piers and the penitents plough the half-acre. Some people refuse to work, and Hunger punishes them until they work. But once Hunger has been sated, the people return to idleness.

Passus 7:
Eventually, Truth sends Piers a pardon for the penitents&#x27; sins; its main content is &#x27;Do well and have well and God shall have your soul&#x27; and &#x27;Do evil and have evil, and expect nothing other than that after your death, the Devil shall have your soul&#x27;. When challenged on the pardon&#x27;s validity by a priest, Piers angrily tears it in two. Will is awakened by their arguing and, musing on his dreams, decides to seek ‘Do-wel’.

===Vision 3===

Passus 8:
Will&#x27;s search for Dowel begins. He enters into a disputation with Friars. He then falls asleep once more and meets Thought. Thought instructs Will in &#x27;Do well, do better, do best&#x27;. Practical interpretation of what these concepts mean is to be provided by Wit.

Passus 9:
There is an extended allegory featuring Dowel and the Castle of Flesh, exposing the need for people to be governed by their &#x27;Inwit&#x27;. The text discusses poverty and marriage. Wit makes further inroads to understanding Dowel, as active virtue.

Passus 10:
Will meets Wit&#x27;s wife, Dame Study. She complains to Will about his ignorance. Will then proceeds to Clergy and Scripture to learn more about Dowel. He considers what use scholarship might have in helping him achieve salvation.

Passus 11:
Scripture complains about Will&#x27;s lack of self-knowledge. Angered, Will (who is already dreaming) goes to sleep and has a dream-within-a-dream in which he meets Fortune. He serves her into old age, but she abandons him. Will learns about the salvation of the Emperor Trajan and the power of love. Kynde (&#x27;character, natural disposition, nature&#x27;, here understood as an aspect of God) shows Will the world. Will has an argument with Reason: Reason, Will concludes, does not do enough to keep people from sin; but Reason disagrees. Will awakes from the dream-within-a-dream. He now meets Imaginatif, who advises Will to be patient.

Passus 12:
Imaginatif teaches Will, bringing together and improving his understanding of earlier discussions in the poem. Imaginatif emphasises the need for humility and the importance of Grace.

===Vision 4===

Passus 13:
Will awakens and then falls back to sleep; he dreams of sharing a feast with Conscience, Scripture, Clergy and Patience; he encounters a greedy Doctor of Divinity (who later shows disdain for love) and as well as eating actual food also dines on spiritual food. Piers the Plowman offers a definition of Do Well, Do Better and Do Best. Then Conscience and Patience meet Haukyn the Active Man, who wears a coat of Christian faith which is, however, soiled with the Seven Deadly Sins.

Passus 14:
Conscience teaches Haukyn to seek forgiveness and do penance; Patience teaches Haukyn about the merits of embracing poverty. Haukyn cries out for God&#x27;s mercy, which awakens Will.

===Vision 5===

Passus 15:
Will finds himself alienated from the waking world, but Reason helps him to go back to sleep, whereupon Will meets Anima (&#x27;spirit&#x27;). Anima tells Will off for his pride in wanting to know too much, but goes on to talk about charity, in particular how the Church should care for its flock, but how its priests and monks do not always fulfil this duty. Talking to Anima, Will starts to conclude that Piers the Plowman is Christ. Will realises that he needs to switch from searching for Dowel to searching for Charity.

Passus 16:
Will falls into another dream-within-a-dream, this time about the Tree of Charity, whose gardener is Piers the Plowman. Will participates in a re-enactment of the Fall of Man and then has a vision of the life of Christ; when this reaches the point where the Devil is defeated, Will wakes up from the dream-within-a-dream. Will goes looking for Piers and meets Faith/Abraham, who is himself searching for Christ.

Passus 17:
Next, Will meets Hope/Moses, characterised by the tablets of law, who is also in search of Christ. Will learns about the Good Samaritan, the prospect of salvation, and the importance of Love. He wakes up.

===Vision 6===

Passus 18:
Will sleeps again, and experiences the climactic section of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;. He experiences Love and the intersection of human and divine time. Will witnesses Christ/the Good Samaritan/Piers Plowman riding into Jerusalem and Christ&#x27;s crucifixion. He then witnesses the Four Daughters of God (Truth, Justice, Mercy, Peace) in debate; the Harrowing of Hell; and Redemption.

Will wakes again, and now exhorts his family to hear Mass.

===Vision 7===

Passus 19:
During the mass, Will falls back to sleep and meets Conscience once more. Conscience recounts the life and Passion of Christ and how Piers/Peter was given his power by Grace/Christ. Will finds out about Pentecost; once more sees Piers as a ploughman, and witnesses Pride attacking Unity/Holy Church. He wakes up and records his dream.

===Vision 8===

Passus 20:
While awake, Will meets Need. He falls asleep again and now dreams of the Antichrist. Kynde sends Old Age, Death, and Pestilence, to chastise people: Will is attacked by Old Age. He witnesses Holy Church undermined by a hypocritical Friar. Conscience goes on pilgrimage to seek Piers the Plowman, and calls on Grace for helpwhereupon Will wakes up.

==Title and authorship==
It is now commonly accepted that &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; was written by William Langland, about whom little is known. This attribution rests principally on the evidence of an early-fifteenth-century manuscript of the C-text (see below) of &quot;Piers&quot; held at Trinity College, Dublin (MS 212), which ascribes the work to one man, called &#x27;Willielmus de Langlond&#x27;:

Translation:

Other manuscripts also name the author as &quot;Robert or William Langland&quot;, or &quot;Wilhelmus W.&quot; (which could be shorthand for &quot;William of Wychwood&quot;).

The attribution to William Langland is also based on internal evidence, primarily a seemingly autobiographical section in Passus 5 of the C-text of the poem. The main narrator of the poem in all the versions is named Will, with allegorical resonances clearly intended, and Langland (or Longland) is thought to be indicated as a surname through apparent puns; e.g., at one point the narrator remarks: &quot;I have lyved in &quot;londe&quot;... my name is &quot;longe wille&quot;&quot; (B.XV.152). This could be a coded reference to the poet&#x27;s name, in the style of much late-medieval literature. New evidence suggests that this reverse cryptogram was read as &quot;Will Long Will&quot; by contemporary scribes and that the rebels of 1381 used this name as a pseudonym alongside the name &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;. Langland&#x27;s authorship, however, is not entirely beyond dispute, as recent work by Stella Pates and C. David Benson has demonstrated. In their work, &quot;The Langland Myth&quot;, they claim there is not enough evidence to suggest that Langland is, in fact, the author, but instead that it is the work of a man by the name of William de la Rokele.

In the sixteenth century, when &quot;Piers&quot; was first printed, authorship was attributed by various antiquarians (such as John Bale) and poets to John Wycliffe and Geoffrey Chaucer, amongst others. Some sixteenth- and seventeenth-century persons regarded the poem as anonymous, and/or associated it with texts in the plowman tradition of social complaint, particularly the Chaucerian pseudepigrapha &quot;The Ploughman&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;Pierce the Ploughman&#x27;s Crede&quot;. (The latter was appended to Owen Rogers&#x27; 1560 edition of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, a degraded version of Robert Crowley&#x27;s 1550 editions.) The character of Piers himself had come to be considered by many readers to be in some sense the author.

The first printed editions by Crowley named the author as &quot;Robert Langland&quot; in a prefatory note. Langland is described as a probable protégé of Wycliffe. With Crowley&#x27;s editions, the poem followed an existing and subsequently repeated convention of titling the poem &quot;The Vision of Piers&quot; [or Pierce] &quot;Plowman&quot;, which is in fact the conventional name of just one section of the poem.

Some medievalists and text critics, beginning with John Matthews Manly, have posited multiple authorship theories for &quot;Piers&quot;, an idea which continues to have a periodic resurgence in the scholarly literature. Between two and five authors are suggested, depending on how authorship is defined. Also, scholars like Charlotte Brewer suggest that scribes and their supervisors be regarded as editors with semi-authorial roles in the production of early modern texts like &quot;Piers Ploughman&quot;.

==The text==
&quot;Piers Plowman&quot; is considered to be one of the most analytically challenging texts in Middle English textual criticism. There are 50–56 surviving manuscripts, some of which are fragmentary. None of the texts is known to be in the author&#x27;s own hand, and none of them derive directly from any of the others.

All modern discussion of the text revolves around the classifications of W. W. Skeat. Skeat argued that there are as many as ten forms of the poem, but only three are to be considered authoritative—the A, B, and C-texts—although the definition of &quot;authoritative&quot; in this context is problematic. According to the three-versions hypothesis, each version represents different manuscript traditions deriving from three distinct and successive stages of authorial revision. Although precise dating is debated, the A, B, and C texts are now commonly thought of as the progressive (20–25 years) work of a single author.

According to the three-versions hypothesis, the A-text was written  1367–70 and is the earliest. It breaks off, apparently unfinished, at Book 11, and Book 12 is written by another author or interpolator. The poem runs to about 2,500 lines. The B-text (Warner&#x27;s ur-B text) was written  1377–79; it revises A, adds new material, and is three times the length of A. It runs to about 7,300 lines. The C-text was written in the 1380s as a major revision of B except for the final sections.

There is some debate over whether the poem can be regarded as finished or not. It entails additions, omissions, and transpositions; it is not significantly different in size from B. Some scholars see it as a conservative revision of B that aims at disassociating the poem from Lollardy and the religious and political radicalism of John Ball during the Great Rising of 1381. (Ball appropriated Piers and other characters in the poem for his own verses, speeches, and letters during the Rising.) There is little actual evidence for this proposal, and much against it.

Skeat believed that the A-text was incomplete and based his editions on a B-text manuscript (Oxford, MS. Laud Misc. 581) that he wrongly thought was probably a holograph. Modern editors following Skeat, such as George Kane and E. Talbot Donaldson, have maintained the basic tenets of Skeat&#x27;s work: there were three final authorial texts, now lost, that can be reconstructed, albeit imperfectly and without certainty, by rooting out the &quot;corruption&quot; and &quot;damage&quot; done by scribes.

The Kane, Kane-Donaldson, and Russell-Kane editions of the three versions, published by the Athlone Press, have been controversial, but are considered among the most important accomplishments in modern editorial work and theory in Middle English. A. V. C. Schmidt has also published a parallel edition of A, B, C and Z; the second volume containing a full critical apparatus indicating his editorial decisions was finally published in 2008, long after the first volume fell out of print.

A. G. Rigg and Charlotte Brewer hypothesized the existence of a Z-text predecessor to A which contains elements of both A and C. The Z-text is based on Oxford MS. Bodley 851, which Rigg and Brewer edited and published. It is the shortest version, and its authenticity is disputed. Ralph Hanna III has disputed the Rigg/Brewer approach based on codicological evidence and internal literary evidence; consequently, the Z-text is now more commonly viewed as a scribal corruption of A with C elements. More recently, Lawrence Warner has shown that what was thought of as B in fact incorporates matter produced as part of the C-revision: if B circulated before C, it looked nothing like what previous editors had assumed.

==Editorial, publication and reception history==

===14th–15th centuries===

John Ball, a priest involved as a leader in the Great Rising of 1381 (also known as the Peasants&#x27; Revolt), included Piers and other characters in his writings. If &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; already had perceived associations with Lollardy, Ball&#x27;s appropriations from it (assuming he was not referring to a folk character also appropriated by Langland) enhanced his and its association with the Lollards as well. The real beliefs and sympathies at work in Langland&#x27;s poem and the revolt remain, for this reason, mysterious and debatable. New evidence suggests that in Norfolk the rebels of 1381 had access to the B version of the text and that they used the author-persona&#x27;s name - Will Long Will - as a pseudonym.

No doubt because of Ball&#x27;s writings, the &quot;Dieulacres Abbey Chronicle&quot; account of the revolt refers to Piers, seemingly as a real person who was a leader with Ball in the revolt. Similarly, early in the history of the poem&#x27;s dissemination in manuscript form, Piers is often treated as the author of the poem. Since it is hard to see how this is credible to those who read the poem, perhaps the idea was that Piers was a mask for the author. Or, as the ideal character of the poem, Piers might be seen as a kind of alter-ego for the poet that was more important to his early readers than the obviously authorial narrator and his apparent self-disclosures as Will. Ironically, Will&#x27;s name and identity were substantially lost.

In some contemporary chronicles of the Rising, Ball and the Lollards were blamed for the revolt, and Piers began to be associated with heresy and rebellion. The earliest literary works comprising the Piers Plowman tradition follow in the wake of these events, although they and their sixteenth-century successors are not anti-monarchical or supportive of rebellion. Like William Langland, who may have written the C-text version of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; to disassociate himself from the Rising, they look for the reform of the English church and society by the removal of abuses in what the authors deem a restorative rather than an innovative project.

The first recorded owner of a copy of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; was the Irish judge Walter de Brugge, who died in 1396.

===16th–18th centuries===
The most conspicuous omissions from William Caxton&#x27;s press were the Bible and &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;. Robert Crowley&#x27;s 1550 editions of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; present the poem as a proto-Protestant goad to the reformation of religion and society. In the passus summaries in the second and third editions, Crowley emphasizes material in the poem warning of political instability and widespread corruption when the king is a child (as was then the case). Crowley may have made small attempts to remove or soften single references to transubstantiation, the Mass, purgatory, and the Virgin Mary as a mediator and object of devotion (although almost a dozen references to purgatory remain, as well as three significant references to Mary). He actually added a line to his second and third editions that clearly refers to Marian intercession (F1r).

After 1550, it was not printed again until 1813 except for Owen Rogers&#x27; 1561 edition—a cheap knock-off of Crowley&#x27;s text. The few people who mention &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; before 1700 usually attribute it to someone other than Langland, and often it is unclear whether they are referring to Langland&#x27;s poem or one of the many other texts circulating in print as part of the Piers Plowman tradition, particularly &quot;The Ploughman&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Since Piers was conflated with the author and dreamer-narrator of the poem at an early date, &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; or a Latin equivalent is often given as the name of the author, which indicates unfamiliarity with, or disbelief of, Crowley&#x27;s preface.

When Langland&#x27;s poem is mentioned, it is often disparaged for its barbarous language. Similar charges were made against Chaucer, but he had more defenders and was already well established as a historical figure and &quot;authority.&quot; Despite the work of Bale and Crowley, Langland&#x27;s name appears to have remained unknown or unaccepted since other authors were suggested after Crowley&#x27;s editions. Sometimes &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; was referred to as the author of the poem, and when writers refer to a list of medieval authors, they will often mention &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; as an author&#x27;s name or a substitute for one. One gets the overall impression that Langland and &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; had less existence as author and text than did the fictional figure of Piers, whose relationship to a definite authorial and textual origin had been obscured much earlier.

Samuel Pepys owned a copy of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;. Milton cites &quot;Chaucer&#x27;s Ploughman&quot; in &quot;Of Reformation&quot; (1641) when he is discussing poems that have described Constantine as a major contributor to the corruption of the church. The end of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, Passus 15, makes this point at length—but it is also made briefly in one stanza in &quot;The Ploughman&#x27;s Tale&quot; (ll. 693–700). In &quot;An Apology for a Pamphlet ...&quot; Milton refers to &quot;The Vision and Crede of Pierce Ploughman&quot;, which might mean one or both of these texts. Perhaps it refers to Rogers&#x27; 1561 edition which put them together. Henry Selden (1622) appears to have read the poem closely enough to admire it for its criticism of the church as well as its judgment and invention. John Weever (1631) also names Robert Langland, as does David Buchanan (1652). Buchanan, however, makes Langland a Scot and attributes other works to him aside from &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;.

Thomas Fuller (1662) bases his remarks about Langland on Selden and Bale, emphasizing Langland&#x27;s putative proto-Protestant status. Fuller also notes that &quot;The Praier and Complaynte of the Ploweman unto Christe&quot; was &quot;first set forth by Tindal, since, exemplified by Mr. Fox.&quot; Since the language of this text is similar to that of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, Fuller attributes it to Langland as well. Thomas Dudley, father of Anne Dudley Bradstreet (1612–72), brought a copy of Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; to America. Alexander Pope (1688–1744) owned a copy of Rogers&#x27; reprint of Crowley&#x27;s edition of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; with the &quot;Crede&quot; appended, and Isaac D&#x27;Israeli (1766–1848) wrote in his &quot;Amenities of Literature&quot; that Pope had &quot;very carefully analyzed the whole&quot; of the latter text. D&#x27;Israeli also mentions Lord Byron&#x27;s (1788–1824) praise for &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;.

===19th–20th-21st centuries===
With its old language and alien worldview, &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; fell into obscurity until the nineteenth century. Barring Rogers, after Crowley, the poem was not published in its entirety until Thomas Whitaker&#x27;s 1813 edition. It emerged at a time when amateur philologists began the groundwork of what would later become a recognized scholarly discipline. Whitaker&#x27;s edition was based on a C-text, whereas Crowley used a B-text for his base.

With Whitaker, a modern editorial tradition began, with each new editor striving to present the &quot;authentic&quot; &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; and challenging the accuracy and authenticity of preceding editors and editions. Then, as before in the English Reformation, this project was driven by a need for a national identity and history that addressed present concerns, hence analysis and commentary typically reflected the critic&#x27;s political views. In the hands of Frederick Furnivall and W. W. Skeat, &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; could be, respectively, a consciousness-raising text in the Working Man&#x27;s College or a patriotic text for grammar school pupils. &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; has often been read primarily as a political document. In an 1894 study, J. J. Jusserand was primarily concerned with what he saw as the poem&#x27;s psychological and sociopolitical content—as distinct from the aesthetic or literary—in a dichotomy common to all modern humanistic studies.

In &quot;Le temps des laboureurs. Travail, ordre social et croissance en Europe (XIe-XIVe siècle)&quot; (Albin Michel 2012) historian of medieval labour Mathieu Arnoux devotes particular attention to &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; in a breakthrough attempt to identify theological causes for the growth of agricultural production from the 11th century to the 14th century.

According to the historian Christopher Dawson, the poem represents “a precious and almost unique record” of medieval religious culture in the minds of the masses as opposed to that of the courts or of the schools and universities. Langland’s poem “is a voice from the underworld of the common people, speaking their language, using their imagery and sharing their ideals”.

==Related texts==
Many subsequent texts – at least 14 – use characters from &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, most often Piers himself. Many more texts were written with similar themes and characters, though not directly borrowing from &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, until around the end of the 16th century. Conversely, &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; was preceded by and contemporary with a number of similar works in the 14th and 15th centuries. Together, these are referred to as the &quot;Piers Plowman tradition&quot;.

<doc id="175417" wikidata="Q3935107" url="?curid=175417" title="Dynamic recompilation">
<text>In computer science, dynamic recompilation is a feature of some emulators and virtual machines, where the system may recompile some part of a program during execution. By compiling during execution, the system can tailor the generated code to reflect the program&#x27;s run-time environment, and potentially produce more efficient code by exploiting information that is not available to a traditional static compiler.

==Uses==
Most dynamic recompilers are used to convert machine code between architectures at runtime. This is a task often needed in the emulation of legacy gaming platforms. In other cases, a system may employ dynamic recompilation as part of an adaptive optimization strategy to execute a portable program representation such as Java or .NET Common Language Runtime bytecodes. Full-speed debuggers also utilize dynamic recompilation to reduce the space overhead incurred in most deoptimization techniques, and other features such as dynamic thread migration.

==Tasks==
The main tasks a dynamic recompiler has to perform are:
* Reading in machine code from the source platform
* Emitting machine code for the target platform

A dynamic recompiler may also perform some auxiliary tasks:
* Managing a cache of recompiled code
* Updating of elapsed cycle counts on platforms with cycle count registers
* Management of interrupt checking
* Providing an interface to virtualized support hardware, for example a GPU
* Optimizing higher-level code structures to run efficiently on the target hardware (see below)

==Applications==
* Many Java virtual machines feature dynamic recompilation.
* Apple&#x27;s Rosetta for Mac OS X on x86, allows PowerPC code to be run on the x86 architecture.
* Later versions of the Mac 68K emulator used in classic Mac OS to run 680x0 code on the PowerPC hardware.
* Psyco, a specializing compiler for Python.
* The HP Dynamo project, an example of a transparent binary dynamic optimizer.
* DynamoRIO, an open-source successor to Dynamo that works with the ARM, x86-64 and IA-64 (Itanium) instruction sets.
* The Vx32 virtual machine employs dynamic recompilation to create OS-independent x86 architecture sandboxes for safe application plugins.
* Microsoft Virtual PC for Mac, used to run x86 code on PowerPC.
* FreeKEYB, an international DOS keyboard and console driver with many usability enhancements utilized self-modifying code and dynamic dead code elimination to minimize its in-memory image based on its user configuration (selected features, languages, layouts) and actual runtime environment (OS variant and version, loaded drivers, underlying hardware), automatically resolving dependencies, dynamically relocating and recombining code sections on byte-level granularity and optimizing opstrings based on semantic information provided in the source code, relocation information generated by special tools during assembly and profile information obtained at load time.
* The backwards compatibility functionality of the Xbox 360 (i.e. running games written for the original Xbox) is widely assumed to use dynamic recompilation.
* Apple&#x27;s Rosetta 2 for Apple silicon, permits many applications compiled for x86-64-based processors to be translated for execution on Apple silicon.
* QEMU

===Emulators===
* PCSX2, a PlayStation 2 emulator, has a recompiler called &quot;microVU&quot;, the successor of &quot;SuperVU&quot;.
* GCemu, a GameCube emulator.
* GEM, a Game Boy emulator for MSX uses an optimizing dynamic recompiler.
* DeSmuME, a Nintendo DS emulator, has a dynarec option.
* Soywiz&#x27;s Psp, a PlayStation Portable emulator, has a dynarec option.
* Mupen64Plus, a multi-platform Nintendo 64 emulator.
* Yabause, a multi-platform Saturn emulator.
*PPSSPP, a multi-platform PlayStation Portable emulator, uses a JIT dynamic recompiler by default.
* PCem, a emulator for old pc platforms which can be used on Windows and Linux. It uses the recompiler to translate legacy cpu calls to modern cpu instructions and to gain some speed in emulation overall.
* 86Box, a fork of PCem with the goal of a more accurate emulation. It is using the recompiler for the same purpose.

<doc id="175425" wikidata="Q727782" url="?curid=175425" title="Guillaume Thomas François Raynal">
<text>Guillaume Thomas François Raynal (12 April 1713 – 6 March 1796), also known as Abbé Raynal, was a French writer, former Catholic priest, and man of letters during the Age of Enlightenment.

==Early life==
He was born at Lapanouse in Rouergue. He was educated at the Jesuit school of Pézenas, and received priest&#x27;s orders, but he was dismissed for unexplained reasons from the parish of Saint-Sulpice, Paris. He became a writer and journalist, leaving the religious life. The Abbé Raynal wrote for the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;, and compiled a series of popular but superficial works, which he published and sold himself. These—&quot;L&#x27;Histoire du stathoudérat&quot; (The Hague, 1748), &quot;L&#x27;Histoire du parlement d&#x27;Angleterre&quot; (London, 1748), &quot;Anecdotes historiques&quot; (Amsterdam, 3 vols., 1753)—gained for him access to the salons of Mme. Geoffrin, Helvétius, and the Baron d&#x27;Holbach.

In May 1754, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1775, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

==The &quot;Histoire philosophique des deux Indes&quot;==

He had the assistance of various members of the &quot;coterie philosophique&quot; in his most important work, &quot;L&#x27;Histoire philosophique et politique des établissements et du commerce des Européens dans les deux Indes&quot; (&quot;Philosophical and Political History of the Two Indies&quot; Amsterdam, 4 vols., 1770). Diderot is credited with a third of this work, which was characterized by Voltaire as &quot;&quot;du réchauffé avec de la déclamation&quot;.&quot; The other chief collaborators were Jean Pechméja, Baron d&#x27;Holbach, Jacques Paulze, the farmer-general of taxes, the Abbé Martin, and Alexandre Deleyre. To this piecemeal method of composition, in which narrative alternated with tirades on political and social questions, was added the further disadvantage of the lack of exact information, which, owing to the dearth of documents, could only have been gained by personal investigation. He released an expanded edition in 1774 and another in 1780.

The &quot;philosophic&quot; declamations perhaps constituted the work&#x27;s chief interest for the general public, and its significance as a contribution to democratic propaganda. The &quot;Histoire&quot; went through many editions, being revised and augmented from time to time by Raynal; it was translated into the principal European languages, and appeared in various abridgments. Its introduction into France was forbidden in 1779; the book was burned by the public executioner, and an order was given for the arrest of the author, whose name had not appeared in the first edition, but was printed on the title page of the Geneva edition of 1780. Seven new maps for the 1798 English edition were engraved by Thomas Kitchin, Jr.

The book examines the East Indies, South America, the West Indies, and North America. The final chapter comprises theory around the future of Europe as a whole. Raynal also examines commerce, religion, slavery, and other popular subjects, all from the perspective of the French Enlightenment. Additional versions of the book included maps of the discussed regions.

On the subject of slavery, Raynal was excoriating, writing &quot;I shall...prove that there is no reason of state which can authorize slavery. I shall not be afraid to denounce to the tribunal of reason and justice those governments which tolerate this cruelty. Whoever justifies such an odious system deserves mocking silence from the philosopher…and a stab with a dagger from the back.&quot;

==Later life==
Raynal went into exile, to Spa, and then to Berlin, where he was coolly received by Frederick the Great, in spite of his connection with the philosophe party.

At Saint Petersburg he met with a more cordial reception from Catherine II, and in 1787 he was permitted to return to France, though not to Paris. He showed generosity in assigning a considerable income to be divided annually among the peasant proprietors of upper Guienne. He was elected by Marseilles to the States-General, but refused to sit on the score of age. Raynal now realized the impossibility of a peaceful revolution, and, in terror of the proceedings for which the writings of himself and his friends had prepared the way, he sent to the Constituent Assembly an address, which was read on 31 May 1791, deprecating the violence of its reforms.

This address is said by Sainte-Beuve (&quot;Nouveaux lundis&quot;, xi.) to have been composed chiefly by de Clermont-Tonnerre and Pierre V. Malouet, and it was regarded, even by moderate men, as ill-timed. The published &quot;Lettre de l&#x27;abbé Raynal a l&#x27;Assemblee nationale&quot; (10 December 1790) was really the work of the comte de Guibert. During the Terror Raynal lived in retirement at Passy and at Montlhery. On the establishment of the Directory in 1795 he became a member of the newly organized Institute of France.

Raynal died 6 March 1796 at Chaillot.

==Address to America==
Published on 3 November 1800, after his death, Raynal addressed the people of the young United States of America with the following words, printed in the National Intelligencer and Washington Advertiser.

PEOPLE of North America! Let the example of all nations which have preceded you, and especially that of the mother country, instruct you. Be afraid of the influence of gold, which brings with luxury the corruption of manners and contempt of laws; be afraid of too unequal a distribution of riches, which shews a small number of citizens in wealth, and a great number in miser; whence arises the insolence of one, and the disgrace of the other, Guard against the spirit of conquest; the tranquility of the empire decreases as it is extended; have arms to defend yourselves, and have none to attack.

Seek ease and health in labour; prosperity, in agriculture and manufactures; strength, in good manners and virtue. Make the sciences and arts prosper, which distinguish the civilized man from the savage. Especially watch over the education of your children.

It is from public schools, be assured, that skillful magistrates, disciplined and courageous soldiers, good fathers, good husbands, good brothers, good friends, and honest men come forth. Wherever we see the youth depraved, that nation is on the decline. Let liberty have an immovable foundation in the wisdom of your contributions and let it be the cement which unites your states, which cannot be destroyed. Establish no legal preference in your different modes of worship. Superstition is every where innocent when it is neither protected nor persecuted; and let your duration be, if possible, equal to that of the world.

==Bibliography==
A detailed bibliography of his works and of those falsely attributed to him will be found in Joseph-Marie Quérard&#x27;s &quot;La France littéraire&quot;, and the same author&#x27;s &quot;Supercheries dévoilées&quot;. The biography by A Jay, prefixed to Peuchet&#x27;s edition (Paris, 10 vols, 1820–1821) of the &quot;Histoire ... des Indes&quot;, is of small value. To this edition Peuchet added two supplementary volumes on colonial development from 1785 to 1824. See also the anonymous &quot;Raynal démasqué&quot; (1791); Cherhal Montreal, &quot;Éloge ... de G.

<doc id="175426" wikidata="Q1929514" url="?curid=175426" title="AES3">
<text>AES3 is a standard for the exchange of digital audio signals between professional audio devices. An AES3 signal can carry two channels of pulse-code-modulated digital audio over several transmission media including balanced lines, unbalanced lines, and optical fiber.

AES3 was jointly developed by the Audio Engineering Society (AES) and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and so is also known as AES/EBU. The standard was first published in 1985 and was revised in 1992 and 2003. AES3 has been incorporated into the International Electrotechnical Commission&#x27;s standard IEC 60958, and is available in a consumer-grade variant known as S/PDIF.

==History and development==
The development of standards for digital audio interconnect for both professional and domestic audio equipment, began in the late 1970s in a joint effort between the Audio Engineering Society and the European Broadcasting Union, and culminated in the publishing of AES3 in 1985. The AES3 standard has been revised in 1992 and 2003 and is published in AES and EBU versions. Early on, the standard was frequently known as AES/EBU.

Variants using different physical connections are specified in IEC 60958. These are essentially consumer versions of AES3 for use within the domestic high fidelity environment using connectors more commonly found in the consumer market. These variants are commonly known as S/PDIF.

==Related standards and documents==
===IEC 60958===
IEC 60958 (formerly IEC 958) is the International Electrotechnical Commission&#x27;s standard on digital audio interfaces. It reproduces the AES3 professional digital audio interconnect standard and the consumer version of the same, S/PDIF.

The standard consists of several parts:
* IEC 60958-1: General
* IEC 60958-2: Software Information Delivery Mode
* IEC 60958-3: Consumer applications
* IEC 60958-4: Professional applications
* IEC 60958-5: Consumer application enhancement

===AES-2id===
AES-2id is an AES information document published by the Audio Engineering Society for digital audio engineering—Guidelines for the use of the AES3 interface. This document provides guidelines for the use of AES3, AES Recommended Practice for Digital Audio Engineering, Serial transmission format for two-channel linearly represented digital audio data. This document also covers the description of related standards used in conjunction with AES3 such as AES11.
The full details of AES-2id can be studied in the standards section of the Audio Engineering Society web site by downloading copies of the AES-2id document as a PDF file.

==Hardware connections==
The AES3 standard parallels part 4 of the international standard IEC 60958. Of the physical interconnection types defined by IEC 60958, two are in common use.

===IEC 60958 type I===
Type I connections use balanced, three-conductor, 110-ohm twisted pair cabling with XLR connectors. Type I connections are most often used in professional installations and are considered the standard connector for AES3. The hardware interface is usually implemented using RS-422 line drivers and receivers.

===IEC 60958 type II===
IEC 60958 Type II defines an unbalanced electrical or optical interface for consumer electronics applications. The precursor of the IEC 60958 Type II specification was the Sony/Philips Digital Interface, or S/PDIF. Both were based on the original AES/EBU work. S/PDIF and AES3 are interchangeable at the protocol level, but at the physical level, they specify different electrical signalling levels and impedances, which may be significant in some applications.

===BNC connector===
AES/EBU signals can also be run using unbalanced BNC connectors a with a 75-ohm coaxial cable. The unbalanced version has a very long transmission distance as opposed to the 150 meters maximum for the balanced version. The AES-3id standard defines a 75-ohm BNC electrical variant of AES3. This uses the same cabling, patching and infrastructure as analogue or digital video, and is thus common in the broadcast industry.

==Protocol==

:&quot;The low-level protocol for data transmission in AES3 and S/PDIF is largely identical, and the following discussion applies for S/PDIF, except as noted.&quot;

AES3 was designed primarily to support stereo PCM encoded audio in either DAT format at 48 kHz or CD format at 44.1 kHz. No attempt was made to use a carrier able to support both rates; instead, AES3 allows the data to be run at &quot;any&quot; rate, and encoding the clock and the data together using biphase mark code (BMC).

Each bit occupies one &quot;time slot&quot;. Each audio sample (of up to 24 bits) is combined with four flag bits and a synchronisation preamble which is four time slots long to make a &quot;subframe&quot; of 32 time slots. The 32 time slots of each subframe are assigned as follows:

Two subframes (A and B, normally used for left and right audio channels) make a frame. Frames contain 64 bit periods and are produced once per audio sample period. At the highest level, each 192 consecutive frames are grouped into an &quot;audio block&quot;. While samples repeat each frame time, metadata is only transmitted once per audio block. At 48 kHz sample rate, there are 250 audio blocks per second, and 3,072,000 time slots per second supported by a 6.144 MHz biphase clock.

===Synchronisation preamble===
The synchronisation preamble is a specially coded &quot;preamble&quot; that identifies the subframe and its position within the audio block. Preambles are not normal BMC-encoded data bits, although they do still have zero DC bias.

Three preambles are possible:
*X (or M) : 11100010 if previous time slot was &quot;0&quot;, 00011101 if it was &quot;1&quot;. (Equivalently, 10010011 NRZI encoded.) Marks a word for channel A (left), other than at the start of an audio block.
*Y (or W) : 11100100 if previous time slot was &quot;0&quot;, 00011011 if it was &quot;1&quot;. (Equivalently, 10010110 NRZI encoded.) Marks a word for channel B (right).
*Z (or B) : 11101000 if previous time slot was &quot;0&quot;, 00010111 if it was &quot;1&quot;. (Equivalently, 10011100 NRZI encoded.) Marks a word for channel A (left) at the start of an audio block.

The three preambles are called X, Y, Z in the AES3 standard; and M, W, B in IEC 958 (an AES extension).

The 8-bit preambles are transmitted in the time allocated to the first four time slots of each subframe (time slots 0 to 3). Any of the three marks the beginning of a subframe. X or Z marks the beginning of a frame, and Z marks the beginning of an audio block.
In two-channel AES3, the preambles form a pattern of ZYXYXYXY..., but it is straightforward to extend this structure to additional channels (more subframes per frame), each with a Y preamble, as is done in the MADI protocol.

===Channel status word===
There is one channel status bit in each subframe, a total of 192 bits or 24 bytes for each channel in each block. Between the AES3 and S/PDIF standards, the contents of the 192-bit channel status word differ significantly, although they agree that the first channel status bit distinguishes between the two. In the case of AES3, the standard describes, in detail, the function of each bit.

*Byte 0: Basic control data: sample rate, compression, emphasis
**bit 0: A value of 1 indicates this is AES3 channel status data. 0 indicates this is S/PDIF data.
**bit 1: A value of 0 indicates this is linear audio PCM data. A value of 1 indicates other (usually non-audio) data.
**bits 2–4: Indicates the type of signal preemphasis applied to the data. Generally set to 100 (none).
**bit 5: A value of 0 indicates that the source is locked to some (unspecified) external time sync. A value of 1 indicates an unlocked source.
**bits 6–7: Sample rate. These bits are redundant when real-time audio is transmitted (the receiver can observe the sample rate directly), but are useful if AES3 data is recorded or otherwise stored. Options are unspecified, 48 kHz (the default), 44.1 kHz, and 32 kHz. Additional sample rate options may be indicated in the &quot;extended sample rate&quot; field (see below).
*Byte 1: indicates if the audio stream is stereo, mono or some other combination.
**bits 0–3: Indicates the relationship of the two channels; they might be unrelated audio data, a stereo pair, duplicated mono data, music and voice commentary, a stereo sum/difference code.
**bits 4–7: Used to indicate the format of the user channel word
*Byte 2: Audio word length
**bits 0–2: Aux bits usage. This indicates how the aux bits (time slots 4–7) are used. Generally set to 000 (unused) or 001 (used for 24-bit audio data).
**bits 3–5: Word length. Specifies the sample size, relative to the 20- or 24-bit maximum. Can specify 0, 1, 2 or 4 missing bits. Unused bits are filled with 0, but audio processing functions such as mixing will generally fill them in with valid data without changing the effective word length.
**bits 6–7: Unused
*Byte 3: Used only for multichannel applications
*Byte 4: Additional sample rate information
**bits 0–1: Indicates the grade of the sample rate reference, per AES11
**bit 2: Reserved
**bits 3–6: Extended sample rate. This indicates other sample rates, not representable in byte 0 bits 6–7. Values are assigned for 24, 96, and 192 kHz, as well as 22.05, 88.2, and 176.4 kHz.
**bit 7: Sampling frequency scaling flag. If set, indicates that the sample rate is multiplied by 1/1.001 to match NTSC video frame rates.
*Byte 5: Reserved
*Bytes 6–9: Four ASCII characters for indicating channel origin. Widely used in large studios.
*Bytes 10–13: Four ASCII characters indicating channel destination, to control automatic switchers. Less often used.
*Bytes 14–17: 32-bit sample address, incrementing block-to-block by 192 (because there are 192 frames per block). At 48 kHz, this wraps approximately every day.
*Bytes 18–21: 32-bit sample address offset to indicate samples since midnight.
*Byte 22: Channel status word reliability indication
**bits 0–3: Reserved
**bit 4: If set, bytes 0–5 (signal format) are unreliable.
**bit 5: If set, bytes 6–13 (channel labels) are unreliable.
**bit 6: If set, bytes 14–17 (sample address) are unreliable.
**bit 7: If set, bytes 18–21 (timestamp) are unreliable.
*Byte 23: CRC. This byte is used to detect corruption of the channel status word, as might be caused by switching mid-block.

===Embedded timecode===
SMPTE timecode data can be embedded within AES3 signals. It can be used for synchronization and for logging and identifying audio content. It is embedded as a 32-bit binary word in bytes 18 to 21 of the channel status data.

The AES11 standard provides information on the synchronization of digital audio structures.

the AES52 standard describes how to insert unique identifiers into an AES3 bit stream.

=== SMPTE 2110 ===
SMPTE 2110-31 defines how to encapsulate an AES3 data stream in Real-time Transport Protocol packets for transmission over an IP network using the SMPTE 2110 IP based multicast framework.

=== SMPTE 302M ===
SMPTE 302M-2007 defines how to encapsulate an AES3 data stream in an MPEG transport stream for television applications.

=== Other formats ===
AES3 digital audio format can also be carried over an Asynchronous Transfer Mode network. The standard for packing AES3 frames into ATM cells is AES47.

==Early life and education==

Malkovich was born in Christopher, Illinois, on December 9, 1953. He grew up in Benton, Illinois. His father, Daniel Leon Malkovich, was a state conservation director, who published the conservation magazine &quot;Outdoor Illinois&quot;. His mother, Joe Anne (née Choisser), owned the &quot;Benton Evening News&quot; daily newspaper and &quot;Outdoor Illinois&quot;. He grew up with an older brother, Danny, and three younger sisters, Amanda, Rebecca, and Melissa. In a May 2020 interview, he revealed that Melissa is his only surviving sibling. His paternal grandparents were Croatian immigrants from the vicinity of Ozalj; his other ancestry includes English, Scottish, French, and German descent. Malkovich attended Logan Grade School, Webster Junior High School, and Benton Consolidated High School. During his high-school years, he appeared in various plays and the musical &quot;Carousel&quot;. He was also active in a folk gospel group, with whom he sang at churches and community events. As a member of a local summer theater project, he co-starred in Jean-Claude van Itallie&#x27;s &quot;America Hurrah&quot; in 1972.

After graduating from high school in 1972, Malkovich enrolled at Eastern Illinois University. He then transferred to Illinois State University, where he majored in theater, but dropped out. He studied acting at the William Esper Studio.

==Career==
In 1976, Malkovich, along with Joan Allen, Gary Sinise, and Glenne Headly, became a charter member of the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago. He moved to New York City in 1980 to appear in a Steppenwolf production of the Sam Shepard play &quot;True West&quot; directed by Sinise, for which he won an Obie Award. One of his first film roles was as an extra alongside Allen, Terry Kinney, George Wendt, and Laurie Metcalf in Robert Altman&#x27;s film &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978). In early 1982, he appeared in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; with Chicago&#x27;s Wisdom Bridge Theatre. Malkovich then directed a Steppenwolf co-production, the 1984 revival of Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Balm in Gilead&quot;, for which he received a second Obie Award and a Drama Desk Award. Other Steppenwolf productions in which Malkovich has appeared include: &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; by Tennessee Williams, directed by H. E. Baccus (1979); &quot;Burn This&quot; by Lanford Wilson, directed by Marshall W. Mason (1987); and &quot;The Libertine&quot; by Stephen Jeffreys, directed by Terry Johnson (1996). He made his feature-film debut as Sally Field&#x27;s blind boarder Mr. Will in &quot;Places in the Heart&quot; (1984). For his portrayal of Mr. Will, Malkovich received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He also portrayed Al Rockoff in Roland Joffe&#x27;s epic film &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; (1984).

His Broadway debut that year was as Biff in &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; alongside Dustin Hoffman as Willy. Malkovich won an Emmy Award for this role when the play was adapted for television by CBS in 1985. He continued to have steady work in films such as &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg, and the film adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; (both 1987) directed by Paul Newman (who appeared in the film) and Joanne Woodward. He then starred in &quot;Making Mr. Right&quot; (also 1987), directed by Susan Seidelman.

Malkovich gained significant critical and popular acclaim when he portrayed the sinister and sensual Valmont in the film &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; (1988), a film adaptation of the stage play &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot; by Christopher Hampton, who had adapted it from the 1782 novel of the same title by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos. He later reprised this role for the music video of &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot; by Annie Lennox. He played Port Moresby in &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; (1990), directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and appeared in &quot;Shadows and Fog&quot; (1991), directed by Woody Allen. In 1990, he recited, in Croatian, verses of the Croatian national anthem &quot;Lijepa naša domovino&quot; (&quot;Our Beautiful Homeland&quot;) in Nenad Bach&#x27;s song &quot;Can We Go Higher?&quot;

Malkovich starred in the 1992 film adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s novella &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; as Lennie alongside Gary Sinise as George. He was nominated for another Oscar, again in the Best Supporting Actor category, for &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; (1993). He was the narrator for the film &quot;Alive&quot; (1993) and starred in &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1998). Malkovich has hosted three episodes of the NBC sketch show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The first occasion was in January 1989 with musical guest Anita Baker, the second in October 1993 with musical guest Billy Joel (and special appearance by former cast member Jan Hooks), and the third in December 2008 with musical guest T.I. with Swizz Beatz (and special appearances by Justin Timberlake, Molly Sims and Jamie-Lynn Sigler).

Malkovich was directed for the second time (after &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;) by Stephen Frears in &quot;Mary Reilly&quot; (1996), a new adaptation of the &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; tale, co-starring Julia Roberts. Malkovich also appeared in &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot; (1999), directed by Luc Besson, playing the French king-to-be Charles VII. Though he played the title role in the Charlie Kaufman-penned &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; (1999), he played a slight variation of himself, as indicated by the character&#x27;s middle name of &quot;Horatio&quot;.

Malkovich&#x27;s directorial film debut, &quot;The Dancer Upstairs&quot;, was released in 2002. That same year Malkovich made a cameo appearance in &quot;Adaptation&quot;. He played Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s antihero Tom Ripley in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot; (also 2002), the second film adaptation of Highsmith&#x27;s 1974 novel, the first being Wim Wenders&#x27; 1977 film &quot;The American Friend&quot;.

In 2000, Malkovich was approached to play Green Goblin in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002), but he passed due to scheduling conflicts and Willem Dafoe was cast in the role. In 2001, film director Michael Cimino had also approached Malkovich to star in his never filmed 3-hour long epic of André Malraux&#x27;s &quot;Man&#x27;s Fate&quot;, alongside Johnny Depp, Uma Thurman, Daniel Day-Lewis and Alain Delon. In 2009, Malkovich was approached and then cast for the role of the Marvel Comics villain Vulture in the unproduced &quot;Spider-Man 4&quot;. 

Malkovich played the title role in the film &quot;The Great Buck Howard&quot; (2008), a role inspired by mentalist the &quot;Amazing Kreskin&quot;. Colin Hanks co-starred and his father, Tom Hanks, appeared as his on-screen father. In November 2009, Malkovich appeared in an advertisement for Nespresso with fellow actor George Clooney. He portrayed Quentin Turnbull in the film adaptation of &quot;Jonah Hex&quot; (2010). Malkovich in 2014 was the voice actor of Dave the Octopus in &quot;Penguins of Madagascar&quot;.

In 2008, Malkovich directed in French a theater production of &quot;&quot; written by Zach Helm, with Cristiana Realli and Vincent Elbaz in the leading roles, at the Comédia théâtre in Paris. Malkovich won the Molière Award for best director for it. He wrote and acted in &quot;The Infernal Comedy – Confessions of a Serial Killer&quot;, directed by , that toured many countries and venues between 2010 and 2013, including at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg, Germany, in May 2010. This was an operatic production, about the life of the Austrian serial killer Jack Unterweger. In 2011, he directed Julian Sands in &quot;A Celebration of Harold Pinter&quot; in the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In 2012, he directed a production of a newly adapted French-language version of &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot; for the Théâtre de l&#x27;Atelier in Paris. The production had a limited engagement in July 2013 at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. 

He returned to theatre, directing &quot;Good Canary&quot; in Spanish in Mexico, then in English at the Rose Theater in London in 2016. Ilan Goodman, Harry Lloyd, and Freya Mavor were in the cast. Malkovich won the Milton Schulman Award for the best director at the Evening Standard Theater Awards in 2016. He appeared in &quot;Just Call Me God&quot; in Hamburg in March 2017. Malkovich wrote and starred in a movie called &quot;100 Years&quot; (2016), directed by Robert Rodriguez. The movie is locked in a vault in the south of France, not to be seen before 2115.

In 2018, Malkovich appeared in a three-part adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot; co-starring Rupert Grint for BBC television, playing the role of fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. In 2019, Malkovich performed in London&#x27;s West End at the Garrick Theatre, starring in David Mamet&#x27;s new play &quot;Bitter Wheat&quot;. He also starred as the title character in the HBO drama series &quot;The New Pope&quot; (2020). On September 26, 2019, it was announced that Malkovich had been cast as Dr. Adrian Mallory in the Netflix comedy series &quot;Space Force&quot;.

Malkovich&#x27;s production of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, set during in the Serbo-Bulgarian War, attracted protests from Bulgarian nationalists at its November 2024 premiere at the Ivan Vazov National Theater in Sofia. The protestors, who included members of the Union of Bulgarian Writers and right wing political parties and movements, crowded the entrance, waving Bulgarian flags and held a banner which said &quot;Malkovich, go home&quot;. Malkovich characterised the protests as not &quot;a very smart idea&quot; and rebuffed the suggestion that he had come to work in Bulgaria in order to denigrate the country&#x27;s reputation.

== Works and performances ==
==Fashion design==
Malkovich created his own fashion company, Mrs. Mudd, in 2002. The company released its John Malkovich menswear collection, &quot;Uncle Kimono&quot;, in 2003, which was subsequently covered in the international press, and its second clothing line, &quot;Technobohemian&quot;, in 2011. Malkovich designed the outfits himself. In an interview with &quot;Big Issue&quot; in 2024, Malkovich said that he &quot;stopped doing fashion about six, seven years ago&quot; but still enjoys seeing collections by &quot;the great fabric designers&quot;.

==Frequent collaborators==
Malkovich was directed many times by Chilean director Raúl Ruiz — &quot;Le Temps retrouvé&quot; (&quot;Time Regained&quot;, 1999), &quot;Les Ames Fortes&quot; (&quot;Savage Souls&quot;, 2001), &quot;Klimt&quot; (2006) and &quot;Lines of Wellington&quot; (2012).

In 2008, directed by Austrian director Michael Sturminger, he portrayed the story of Jack Unterweger in a performance for one actor, two sopranos, and period orchestra entitled &quot;Seduction and Despair&quot;, which premiered at Barnum Hall in Santa Monica, California. A fully staged version of the production, entitled &quot;The Infernal Comedy&quot; premiered in Vienna in July 2009. The show has since been performed in 2009 through 2012 throughout Europe, North America and South America.

Malkovich was also directed by Sturminger in &quot;Casanova&#x27;s Variations&quot; and its movie adaptation in 2014 (co-starring Fanny Ardant). For their third collaboration, in 2017, Michael Stürminger directed Malkovich in &quot;Just Call me God – the final speech&quot;, in which he played a Third World dictator called Satur Dinam Cha, who is about to be overthrown.

He frequently worked with Julian Sands.

Malkovich has collaborated with Lithuanian actress Ingeborga Dapkūnaitė on many productions; by April 2023, there had been nine, and he has called her his &quot;oldest, closest, colleague&quot;. In 1992 they both appeared in the Steppenwolf production of &quot;A Slip of the Tongue&quot;, which later played in Shaftesbury Avenue in London, directed by Simon Stokes. She also appeared in &quot;Libra&quot;, a play directed and adapted by Malkovich about Lee Harvey Oswald, and, in January 2011, she appeared with him in &quot;The Giacomo Variations&quot; at the Sydney Opera House, as part of the Sydney Festival. In April 2023, Dapkūnaitė acted alongside Malkovich in &quot;In the Solitude of Cotton Fields&quot; in Tallinn, Estonia.

==In the media==
In 2014, the photographer Sandro Miller recreated 35 iconic portraits of John Malkovich as the subject, in a project called &quot;Malkovich, Malkovich, Malkovich: Homage to Photographer Master&quot;.

Malkovich starred in his first video-game role in &quot;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&quot; in the &quot;Exo Zombies&quot; mode. In 1992, he appeared in period costume along with Hugh Laurie in the music video for &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot; by Annie Lennox. In 2015, he appeared in the music video for Eminem&#x27;s single &quot;Phenomenal&quot;. In 2017, he appeared in some humorous Super Bowl commercials portraying himself attempting to gain control of the johnmalkovich.com domain.

==Personal life==
Malkovich married actress Glenne Headly in 1982. In 1988, the couple divorced following his affair with Michelle Pfeiffer. He began dating Nicoletta Peyran in 1989 after meeting her on the set of &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, on which she was the second assistant director. The couple has two children, Amandine and Loewy.

Malkovich has a distinctive voice quality, which &quot;The Guardian&quot; has described as &quot;wafting, whispery, and reedy&quot;. He does not consider himself a method actor. Malkovich is fluent in French, having lived and worked in theater in southern France for nearly 10 years. He and his family left France in a dispute over taxes in 2003 and have since lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Malkovich is the co-owner of the restaurant Bica do Sapato and Lux nightclub in Lisbon. He lost millions of dollars in the Madoff investment scandal in 2008. In the 1990s, Malkovich and Peyran bought a farm near Lacoste, Vaucluse, which the couple later turned into a wine label named Les Quelles de la Coste; they started planting grapevines there in 2008 and produced their first vintage in 2011. He has raised funds for the Steppenwolf Theatre Company, his sole charity.

Malkovich stated in a 2011 interview that he is not a &quot;political person&quot; and that he does not have &quot;an ideology&quot;, revealing that he had not voted since George McGovern lost his presidential run in 1972. At the Cambridge Union Society in 2002, when asked whom he would most like to fight to the death, Malkovich replied that he would &quot;rather just shoot&quot; journalist Robert Fisk and politician George Galloway, stating that Galloway was not honest. Journalists speculated that the comment was related to criticism of Israel and the war in Iraq.

When asked in an interview with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in 2008 whether having spiritual beliefs was necessary to portray a spiritual character, he said, &quot;No, I&#x27;d say not... I&#x27;m an atheist. I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m without spiritual belief particularly, or rather, specifically. Maybe I&#x27;m agnostic, but I&#x27;m not quite sure there&#x27;s some great creator somehow controlling everything and giving us free will. I don&#x27;t know; it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a lot of sense to me.&quot;

On June 6, 2013, Malkovich was walking in Toronto when a 77-year-old man named Jim Walpole tripped and accidentally cut his throat on a piece of scaffolding. Malkovich applied pressure to Walpole&#x27;s neck to reduce bleeding before Walpole was rushed to a hospital, where he received stitches and later credited Malkovich with saving his life.

<text>John Innes Mackintosh Stewart (30 September 1906 – 12 November 1994) was a Scottish novelist and academic. He is equally well known for the works of literary criticism and contemporary novels published under his real name and for the crime fiction published under the pseudonym of Michael Innes.

==Life==
Stewart was born in Edinburgh, the son of Elizabeth (Eliza) Jane (née Clark) and John Stewart of Nairn. His father was a lawyer and later the Director of Education for the City of Edinburgh.

Stewart was educated at Edinburgh Academy from 1913 to 1924 and then studied English literature at Oriel College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1928. At Oxford he was presented with the Matthew Arnold Memorial Prize and was named a Bishop Frazer&#x27;s scholar. Using this, in 1929 he went to Vienna to study psychoanalysis. He was lecturer in English at the University of Leeds from 1930 to 1935 and then became Jury Professor of English in the University of Adelaide, South Australia.

In 1932 he married Margaret Hardwick (1905—1979).

He returned to the United Kingdom to become Lecturer in English at the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast from 1946 to 1948. In 1949 he became a Student (equivalent of Fellow in other Oxford colleges) of Christ Church, Oxford. By the time of his retirement in 1973, he was a professor of the university.

In 1990 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

He died at Coulsdon in south London on 12 November 1994, aged 88. His estate was valued at £139,330.

===Michael Innes===
Between 1936 and 1986, Stewart, writing under the pseudonym of Michael Innes, published nearly fifty crime novels and short story collections, which he later described as &quot;entertainments&quot;. These abound in literary allusions and in what critics have variously described as &quot;mischievous wit&quot;, &quot;exuberant fancy&quot; and a &quot;tongue-in-cheek propensity&quot; for intriguing turns of phrase. Julian Symons identified Innes as one of the &quot;farceurs&quot;—crime writers for whom the detective story was &quot;an over-civilized joke with a frivolity which makes it a literary conversation piece with detection taking place on the side&quot;—and described Innes&#x27;s writing as being &quot;rather in the manner of Peacock strained through or distorted by Aldous Huxley&quot;. His mysteries have also been described as combining &quot;the elliptical introspection ... [of] a Jamesian character&#x27;s speech, the intellectual precision of a Conradian description, and the amazing coincidences that mark any one of Hardy&#x27;s plots&quot;.

The best-known of Innes&#x27;s detective creations is Sir John Appleby, who is introduced in &quot;Death at the President&#x27;s Lodging&quot;, in which he is a Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard. Appleby features in many of the later novels and short stories, in the course of which he rises to become Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Other novels feature portrait painter and Royal Academician, Charles Honeybath, an amateur but nonetheless effective sleuth. The two detectives meet in &quot;Appleby and Honeybath&quot;. Some of the later stories feature Appleby&#x27;s son Bobby as sleuth.

In 2007, his family transferred all the Innes copyrights and other legal rights to Owatonna Media. Owatonna Media on-sold these copyrights to Coolabi Plc in 2009, but retained a master licence in radio and audio rights. Literary rights are currently held by John Stewart Literary Management, and published by House of Stratus.

==Publications==

Stewart wrote several critical studies, including full-length studies of James Joyce, Joseph Conrad, Thomas Love Peacock and Thomas Hardy, as well as many novels and short stories. His last publication was his autobiography &quot;Myself and Michael Innes&quot; (1987).

<text>Zuid-Beveland (; &quot;South Beveland&quot;) is part of the province of Zeeland in the Netherlands north of the Western Scheldt and south of the Eastern Scheldt.

== Topography ==
It is a former island, now peninsula, crossed by the Canal through Zuid-Beveland on the west and the Scheldt–Rhine Canal on the east.

It consists of four municipalities:

*Borsele
*Goes
*Kapelle
*Reimerswaal

Goes is Zuid-Beveland&#x27;s principal urban center.

Zuid-Beveland is a former island which was joined (together with Walcheren) to the mainland by a railway embankment in 1903 and to Noord-Beveland by the Delta Works. A shipping canal connecting the Belgian port of Antwerp with the Rhine River traverses Zuid-Beveland.

== History ==

=== Third and fourth centuries ===
This was the period during which most of Zeeland appears to have been submerged. The area was and for several centuries would remain almost unpeopled.

=== Middle Ages ===
During the eleventh century the area began to be drained, as little by little polders and channels were developed to protect the fields between them. Once drained, salt levels began to reduce and the soil became very fertile. Agriculture developed and prosperity grew.

In the thirteenth century villages and towns began to appear. People lived chiefly from farming and fishing. The commercial centre of Zuid-Beveland was Goes, but Reimerswaal to the east, which later would be destroyed by floods also played an important role at this time.

=== The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ===
As a result of the St. Felix&#x27;s flood in November 1530, much of the island disappeared under water. Towns and villages were lost to what became known as the drowned land of Zuid-Beveland (&quot;Pays inondé de Zuid-Beveland / Verdronken Land van Zuid-Beveland&quot;). The island was again badly impacted forty years later in November 1570 by the All Saints&#x27; Day Flood (&quot;Allerheiligenvloed&quot; / &quot;Inondations de la Toussaint&quot;).

Between 1568 and 1648, during the course of what by its weary end had become the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the surviving lands of Zuid-Beveland were frequently in the military theatre of operations.

=== The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ===
During most of this period the economy of the Netherlands slowed or contracted, with the exception of the agricultural sector. However, the region benefited from advances in transportation, connected in 1868 to Roosendaal by railroad with the inauguration of the Zeeland Line (la &quot;Zeeuwse Lijn&quot;: la «Ligne zélandaise»), the Roosendaal–Vlissingen railway. In 1850 work began on the Zuid-Beveland Canal which linked the Western Scheldt and the Eastern Scheldt across a narrow neck of land in the east of the province.

The construction in 1871 of the Sloedam, topped off with a roadway and a railway track, across the old Sloe Channel, connected Zuid-Beveland with Walcheren.

=== World War II ===
On 16 May 1940, heavy fighting occurred near Kapelle between German and French motorised troops, who came to the rescue of the Dutch. The next day 65 French soldiers were buried by the local people.
After World War II every French soldier who was killed in the Netherlands during the war was brought to Kapelle. On 16 May 1950, the military cemetery on the edge of town was officially opened. 217 French soldiers, 20 Moroccan soldiers in French service and 1 Belgian soldier were buried there.

The area was liberated by British and Canadians during the Battle of the Scheldt in November 1944.

=== The Flood of 1953 ===
The North Sea flood on the night of 31 January and the morning of 1 February 1953 caused 1,836 deaths in the southwest of the Netherlands. Because of the relative high altitude, most parts of Zuid-Beveland (mainly the area of Goes) were relatively safe. In particular the eastern part of the peninsula suffered from floods. To prevent future floods, the Delta Works were started in 1950. As a side-effect, the connection with the rest of the country improved too.

== Landscape and land-use ==
The soil primarily consists of marine clay. The landscape is dominated by dikes surrounding polders, due to recurring periods of floods and land reclamation. The main land-use is agricultural, of which consists primarily of crop cultivation and fruit orchards. Urban land-use is limited to the towns of Goes and Kapelle and several smaller towns and villages. Industrial activities are concentrated in the west of the peninsula (the Sloe area).

== Economic activities ==
Agriculture, in particular crop cultivation, livestock breeding, aquaculture and fruit orchards are the economic mainstays. South Beveland specializes in the growing of wheat, potatoes, sugar beets, and fruits and is also known for its fisheries and oyster culture. Zuid-Beveland is also home to Europe&#x27;s largest greenhouse, located near Kapelle.

The &quot;Zak van Zuid-Beveland&quot; (a large fruit orchard area) is Zuid-Beveland&#x27;s main touristic attraction. In spring the blooming trees and the small-scale landscape make for a popular place for outdoor activities. The historic steam train from Goes to Borssele crosses this area. The many waters surrounding Zuid-Beveland are a popular place for water sports, in particular the Veerse Meer.

== Transport ==
The main road in Zuid-Beveland is the motorway A58, connecting Flushing and Eindhoven. The highway A256/N256 connects the peninsula to the north (Noord-Beveland, Zierikzee and Rotterdam). The highway N62 is the connection to the south (Zeelandic Flanders and Belgium), by means of the Western Scheldt Tunnel: a tunnel under the Western Scheldt estuary between Ellewoutsdijk and Terneuzen. It is the longest tunnel for highway traffic in The Netherlands and replaced the former ferry between Kruiningen and Perkpolder 2003.

More or less parallel to the motorway, a railroad connects Zuid-Beveland to Roosendaal, the Roosendaal–Vlissingen railway, with stations in (from west to east) Goes, Kapelle-Biezelinge, Kruiningen-Yerseke, Rilland-Bath and Krabbendijke. A cargo railroad connects the main railway with the industrial area Sloe, near Flushing. A historical steam train connects Goes and Hoedekenskerke, but this railroad nowadays only serves touristic purposes.

The Western Scheldt is an important shipping route to the Port of Antwerp. The Canal through Zuid-Beveland connects the Western and Eastern Scheldt. The more eastern Scheldt–Rhine Canal connects Antwerp and the Volkerak. The Eastern Scheldt and Veerse Meer are popular with pleasure boats.

<doc id="175437" wikidata="Q411882" url="?curid=175437" title="Gossypol">
<text>Gossypol () is a natural phenol derived from the cotton plant (genus &quot;Gossypium&quot;). Gossypol is a phenolic aldehyde that permeates cells and acts as an inhibitor for several dehydrogenase enzymes. It is a yellow pigment. The structure exhibits atropisomerism, with the two enantiomers having different biochemical properties.

Among other applications, it has been tested as a male oral contraceptive in China. In addition to its putative contraceptive properties, gossypol has also long been known to possess antimalarial properties.

== History ==
Utilization of cotton-seed oil in the 19th century was complicated by the fact that it stained everything. In 1882-1883 James Longmore from Liverpool took several patents on separating the colorant by partial saponification of the oil, and in 1886 he presented his findings to the local section of the Society of Chemical Industry. He is often considered the discoverer of gossypol, even though he only isolated it in crude form.

The name was coined in 1899 by Leon Marchlewski, who first purified the compound and studied some of its chemical properties. F. E. Withers and F. E. Caruth first attributed the toxic properties of the cotton seed (known since the 19th c.) to gossypol in 1915, and its chemical formula was established in 1927 by Earl Perry Clark (1892-1943).

==Biosynthesis==
Gossypol is a terpenoid aldehyde which is formed metabolically through acetate via the isoprenoid pathway. The sesquiterpene dimer undergoes a radical coupling reaction to form gossypol. The biosynthesis begins when geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) are combined to make the sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). The cadinyl cation (1) is oxidized to 2 by (+)-δ-cadinene synthase. The (+)-δ-cadinene (2) is involved in making the basic aromatic sesquiterpene unit, homigossypol, by oxidation, which generates the 3 (8-hydroxy-δ-cadinene) with the help of (+)-δ-cadinene 8-hyroxylase. Compound 3 goes through various oxidative processes to make 4 (deoxyhemigossypol), which is oxidized by one electron into hemigossypol (5, 6, 7) and then undergoes a phenolic oxidative coupling, &quot;ortho&quot; to the phenol groups, to form gossypol (8). The coupling is catalyzed by a hydrogen peroxide-dependent peroxidase enzyme, which results in the final product.

==Research==

===Contraception===
A 1929 investigation in Jiangxi showed correlation between low fertility in males and use of crude cottonseed oil for cooking. The compound causing the contraceptive effect was determined to be gossypol.
In the 1970s, the Chinese government began researching the use of gossypol as a contraceptive. Their studies involved over 10,000 subjects, and continued for over a decade. They concluded that gossypol provided reliable contraception, could be taken orally as a tablet, and did not upset men&#x27;s balance of hormones.

However, gossypol also had serious flaws. The studies also discovered an abnormally high rate (0.75%) of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels) among subjects. Hypokalemia causes symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and at its most extreme, paralysis. In addition, about 7% of subjects reported effects on their digestive systems, about 12% had increased fatigue, some subjects experienced impotence or reduced libido, and 9.9% became irreversibly infertile, apparently associated with longer treatment and greater total dose of gossypol. Most subjects recovered after stopping treatment and taking potassium supplements. The same study showed taking potassium supplements during gossypol treatment did not prevent hypokalemia in primates. The potassium deficiency may also be a result of the Chinese diet or genetic predisposition.

In the mid-1990s, the Brazilian pharmaceutical company Hebron announced plans to market a low-dose gossypol pill called Nofertil, but the pill never came to market. Its release was indefinitely postponed due to unacceptably high rates of permanent infertility. 5% to 25% of the men remained azoospermic up to a year after stopping treatment. 

Researchers have suggested gossypol might make a good noninvasive alternative to surgical vasectomy.

In 1986, in conjunction with the Chinese Ministry of Public Health and the Rockefeller Foundation, the World Health Organization formalized a decision to discontinue research into gossypol as a male contraceptive drug. In addition to the other side effects, the WHO researchers were concerned about gossypol&#x27;s toxicity: the in primates is less than 10 times the contraceptive dose, creating a small therapeutic window. This report effectively ended further studies of gossypol as a temporary contraceptive, but research into using it as an alternative to vasectomy continues in Austria, Brazil, Chile, China, the Dominican Republic, and Nigeria.

==Toxicity ==
Food and animal agricultural industries must manage cotton-derivative product levels to avoid toxicity. For example, only ruminant microflora can digest gossypol, and then only to a certain level, and cottonseed oil must be refined. Genetically engineered cotton plants that contain little gossypol in the seed may still contain the compound in the stems and leaves.

<text>Medical cannabis, medicinal cannabis or medical marijuana (MMJ) refers to cannabis products and cannabinoid molecules that are prescribed by physicians for their patients. The use of cannabis as medicine has a long history, but has not been as rigorously tested as other medicinal plants due to legal and governmental restrictions, resulting in limited clinical research to define the safety and efficacy of using cannabis to treat diseases.

Preliminary evidence has indicated that cannabis might reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy and reduce chronic pain and muscle spasms. Regarding non-inhaled cannabis or cannabinoids, a 2021 review found that it provided little relief against chronic pain and sleep disturbance, and caused several transient adverse effects, such as cognitive impairment, nausea, and drowsiness.
Short-term use increases the risk of minor and major adverse effects. Common side effects include dizziness, feeling tired, vomiting, and hallucinations. Long-term effects of cannabis are not clear. Concerns include memory and cognition problems, risk of addiction, schizophrenia in young people, and the risk of children taking it by accident.

Many cultures have used cannabis for therapeutic purposes for thousands of years. Some American medical organizations have requested removal of cannabis from the list of Schedule I controlled substances, emphasizing that rescheduling would enable more extensive research and regulatory oversight to ensure safe access. Others oppose its legalization, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Medical cannabis can be administered through various methods, including capsules, lozenges, tinctures, dermal patches, oral or dermal sprays, cannabis edibles, and vaporizing or smoking dried buds. Synthetic cannabinoids are available for prescription use in some countries, such as synthetic delta-9-THC and nabilone. 

Countries that allow the medical use of whole-plant cannabis include Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Uruguay. In the United States, 38 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for medical purposes, beginning with the passage of California&#x27;s Proposition 215 in 1996. Although cannabis remains prohibited for any use at the federal level, the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment was enacted in December 2014, limiting the ability of federal law to be enforced in states where medical cannabis has been legalized. This amendment reflects an increasing bipartisan acknowledgment of the potential therapeutic uses of cannabis and the significance of state-level policymaking in this area.
== Classification ==

In the U.S., the National Institute on Drug Abuse defines medical cannabis as &quot;using the whole, unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat symptoms of illness and other conditions&quot;.

A cannabis plant includes more than 400 different chemicals, of which about 70 are cannabinoids. In comparison, typical government-approved medications contain only one or two chemicals. The number of active chemicals in cannabis is one reason why treatment with cannabis is difficult to classify and study.

A 2014 review stated that the variations in ratio of CBD-to-THC in botanical and pharmaceutical preparations determines the therapeutic vs psychoactive effects (CBD attenuates THC&#x27;s psychoactive effects) of cannabis products.

== Medical uses ==
Overall, research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear whether it is a useful treatment for any condition, or whether harms outweigh any benefit. There is no consistent evidence that it helps with chronic pain and muscle spasms.

Low quality evidence suggests its use for reducing nausea during chemotherapy, improving appetite in HIV/AIDS, improving sleep, and improving tics in Tourette syndrome. When usual treatments are ineffective, cannabinoids have also been recommended for anorexia, arthritis, glaucoma, and migraine.

It is unclear whether American states might be able to mitigate the adverse effects of the opioid epidemic by prescribing medical cannabis as an alternative pain management drug.

Cannabis should not be used in pregnancy.

=== Insomnia ===
Research analyzing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) did not find significant differences in sleep duration between cannabis users and non-users. This suggests that while some individuals may perceive benefits from cannabis use in terms of sleep, it may not significantly change overall sleep patterns across the general population.

A review of literature up to 2018 indicates that cannabidiol (CBD) may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of insomnia. CBD, a non-psychoactive component of cannabis, is of particular interest due to its potential to influence sleep without the psychoactive effects associated with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

=== Nausea and vomiting ===
Medical cannabis is somewhat effective in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and may be a reasonable option in those who do not improve following preferential treatment. Comparative studies have found cannabinoids to be more effective than some conventional antiemetics such as prochlorperazine, promethazine, and metoclopramide in controlling CINV, but these are used less frequently because of side effects including dizziness, dysphoria, and hallucinations. Long-term cannabis use may cause nausea and vomiting, a condition known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS).

A 2016 Cochrane review said that cannabinoids were &quot;probably effective&quot; in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea in children, but with a high side-effect profile (mainly drowsiness, dizziness, altered moods, and increased appetite). Less common side effects were &quot;ocular problems, orthostatic hypotension, muscle twitching, pruritus, vagueness, hallucinations, lightheadedness and dry mouth&quot;.

=== HIV/AIDS ===
Evidence is lacking for both efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in treating patients with HIV/AIDS or for anorexia associated with AIDS. As of 2013, current studies suffer from the effects of bias, small sample size, and lack of long-term data.

=== Pain ===
A 2021 review found little effect of using non-inhaled cannabis to relieve chronic pain. According to a 2019 systematic review, there have been inconsistent results of using cannabis for neuropathic pain, spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and pain from rheumatic disorders, but was not effective treating chronic cancer pain. The authors state that additional randomized controlled trials of different cannabis products are necessary to make conclusive recommendations.

When cannabis is inhaled to relieve pain, blood levels of cannabinoids rise faster than when oral products are used, peaking within three minutes and attaining an analgesic effect in seven minutes.

A 2011 review considered cannabis to be generally safe, and it appears safer than opioids in palliative care.

A 2022 review concluded the pain relief experienced after using medical cannabis is due to the placebo effect, especially given widespread media attention that sets the expectation for pain relief.

===Neurological conditions===
Cannabis&#x27; efficacy is not clear in treating neurological problems, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and movement problems. Evidence also suggests that oral cannabis extract is effective for reducing patient-centered measures of spasticity. A trial of cannabis is deemed to be a reasonable option if other treatments have not been effective. Its use for MS is approved in ten countries. A 2012 review found no problems with tolerance, abuse, or addiction. In the United States, cannabidiol, one of the cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant, has been approved for treating two severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.

=== Mental health ===
A 2019 systematic review found that there is a lack of evidence that cannabinoids are effective in treating depressive or anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis.

Research indicates that cannabis, particularly CBD, may have anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) effects. A study found that CBD significantly reduced anxiety during a simulated public speaking test for individuals with social anxiety disorder. However, the relationship between cannabis use and anxiety symptoms is complex, and while some users report relief, the overall evidence from observational studies and clinical trials remains inconclusive. Cannabis is often used by people to cope with anxiety, yet the efficacy and safety of cannabis for treating anxiety disorders is yet to be researched.

Cannabis use, especially at high doses, is associated with a higher risk of psychosis, particularly in individuals with a genetic predisposition to psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. Some studies have shown that cannabis can trigger a temporary psychotic episode, which may increase the risk of developing a psychotic disorder later.

The impact of cannabis on depression is less clear. Some studies suggest a potential increase in depression risk among adolescents who use cannabis, though findings are inconsistent across studies.

== Adverse effects ==
=== Medical use ===
There is insufficient data to draw strong conclusions about the safety of medical cannabis. Typically, adverse effects of medical cannabis use are not serious; they include tiredness, dizziness, increased appetite, and cardiovascular and psychoactive effects. Other effects can include impaired short-term memory; impaired motor coordination; altered judgment; and paranoia or psychosis at high doses. Tolerance to these effects develops over a period of days or weeks. The amount of cannabis normally used for medicinal purposes is not believed to cause any permanent cognitive impairment in adults, though long-term treatment in adolescents should be weighed carefully as they are more susceptible to these impairments. Withdrawal symptoms are rarely a problem with controlled medical administration of cannabinoids. The ability to drive vehicles or to operate machinery may be impaired until a tolerance is developed. Although supporters of medical cannabis say that it is safe, further research is required to assess the long-term safety of its use.

=== Cognitive effects ===

Recreational use of cannabis is associated with cognitive deficits, especially for those who begin to use cannabis in adolescence. there is a lack of research into long-term cognitive effects of medical use of cannabis, but one 12-month observational study reported that &quot;MC patients demonstrated significant improvements on measures of executive function and clinical state over the course of 12 months&quot;.

=== Impact on psychosis ===
Exposure to THC can cause acute transient psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and people with schizophrenia.

A 2007 meta analysis concluded that cannabis use reduced the average age of onset of psychosis by 2.7 years relative to non-cannabis use. A 2005 meta analysis concluded that adolescent use of cannabis increases the risk of psychosis, and that the risk is dose-related. A 2004 literature review on the subject concluded that cannabis use is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of psychosis, but that cannabis use is &quot;neither necessary nor sufficient&quot; to cause psychosis. A French review from 2009 came to a conclusion that cannabis use, particularly that before age 15, was a factor in the development of schizophrenic disorders.

== Pharmacology ==
The genus &quot;Cannabis&quot; contains two species which produce useful amounts of psychoactive cannabinoids: &quot;Cannabis indica&quot; and &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot;, which are listed as Schedule I medicinal plants in the US; a third species, &quot;Cannabis ruderalis&quot;, has few psychogenic properties. Cannabis contains more than 460 compounds; at least 80 of these are cannabinoids – chemical compounds that interact with cannabinoid receptors in the brain. As of 2012, more than 20 cannabinoids were being studied by the U.S. FDA.

The most psychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant is tetrahydrocannabinol (or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC). Other cannabinoids include delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabichromene (CBC) and cannabigerol (CBG); they have less psychotropic effects than THC, but may play a role in the overall effect of cannabis. The most studied are THC, CBD and CBN.

CB1 and CB2 are the primary cannabinoid receptors responsible for several of the effects of cannabinoids, although other receptors may play a role as well. Both belong to a group of receptors called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). CB1 receptors are found in very high levels in the brain and are thought to be responsible for psychoactive effects. CB2 receptors are found peripherally throughout the body and are thought to modulate pain and inflammation.

=== Absorption ===
Cannabinoid absorption is dependent on its route of administration.

Inhaled and vaporized THC have similar absorption profiles to smoked THC, with a bioavailability ranging from 10 to 35%. Oral administration has the lowest bioavailability of approximately 6%, variable absorption depending on the vehicle used, and the longest time to peak plasma levels (2 to 6 hours) compared to smoked or vaporized THC.

Similar to THC, CBD has poor oral bioavailability, approximately 6%. The low bioavailability is largely attributed to significant first-pass metabolism in the liver and erratic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. However, oral administration of CBD has a faster time to peak concentrations (2 hours) than THC.

Due to the poor bioavailability of oral preparations, alternative routes of administration have been studied, including sublingual and rectal. These alternative formulations maximize bioavailability and reduce first-pass metabolism. Sublingual administration in rabbits yielded bioavailability of 16% and time to peak concentration of 4 hours. Rectal administration in monkeys doubled bioavailability to 13.5% and achieved peak blood concentrations within 1 to 8 hours after administration.

=== Distribution ===
Like cannabinoid absorption, distribution is also dependent on route of administration. Smoking and inhalation of vaporized cannabis have better absorption than do other routes of administration, and therefore also have more predictable distribution. THC is highly protein bound once absorbed, with only 3% found unbound in the plasma. It distributes rapidly to highly vascularized organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys, as well as to various glands. Low levels can be detected in the brain, testes, and unborn fetuses, all of which are protected from systemic circulation via barriers. THC further distributes into fatty tissues a few days after administration due to its high lipophilicity, and is found deposited in the spleen and fat after redistribution.

=== Metabolism ===
Delta-9-THC is the primary molecule responsible for the effects of cannabis. Delta-9-THC is metabolized in the liver and turns into 11-OH-THC. 11-OH-THC is the first metabolic product in this pathway. Both Delta-9-THC and 11-OH-THC are psychoactive. The metabolism of THC into 11-OH-THC plays a part in the heightened psychoactive effects of edible cannabis.

Next, 11-OH-THC is metabolized in the liver into 11-COOH-THC, which is the second metabolic product of THC. 11-COOH-THC is not psychoactive.

Ingestion of edible cannabis products lead to a slower onset of effect than the inhalation of it because the THC travels to the liver first through the blood before it travels to the rest of the body. Inhaled cannabis can result in THC going directly to the brain, where it then travels from the brain back to the liver in recirculation for metabolism. Eventually, both routes of metabolism result in the metabolism of psychoactive THC to inactive 11-COOH-THC.

=== Excretion ===
Due to substantial metabolism of THC and CBD, their metabolites are excreted mostly via feces, rather than by urine. After delta-9-THC is hydroxylated into 11-OH-THC via CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, it undergoes phase II metabolism into more than 30 metabolites, a majority of which are products of glucuronidation. Approximately 65% of THC is excreted in feces and 25% in the urine, while the remaining 10% is excreted by other means. The terminal half-life of THC is 25 to 36 hours, whereas for CBD it is 18 to 32 hours.

CBD is hydroxylated by P450 liver enzymes into 7-OH-CBD. Its metabolites are products of primarily CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activity, with potential activity of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. Similar to delta-9-THC, a majority of CBD is excreted in feces and some in the urine. The terminal half-life is approximately 18–32 hours.

== Administration ==
Smoking has been the means of administration of cannabis for many users, but it is not suitable for the use of cannabis as a medicine. It was the most common method of medical cannabis consumption in the US . It is difficult to predict the pharmacological response to cannabis because concentration of cannabinoids varies widely, as there are different ways of preparing it for consumption (smoked, applied as oils, eaten, infused into other foods, or drunk) and a lack of production controls. The potential for adverse effects from smoke inhalation makes smoking a less viable option than oral preparations. Cannabis vaporizers have gained popularity because of a perception among users that fewer harmful chemicals are ingested when components are inhaled via aerosol rather than smoke. Cannabinoid medicines are available in pill form (dronabinol and nabilone) and liquid extracts formulated into an oromucosal spray (nabiximols). Oral preparations are &quot;problematic due to the uptake of cannabinoids into fatty tissue, from which they are released slowly, and the significant first-pass liver metabolism, which breaks down Δ9THC and contributes further to the variability of plasma concentrations&quot;.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved smoked cannabis for any condition or disease, as it deems that evidence is lacking concerning safety and efficacy. The FDA issued a 2006 advisory against &quot;smoked&quot; medical cannabis stating: &quot;marijuana has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision.&quot;

== History ==
=== Ancient ===
Cannabis, called &quot;má&quot; (meaning &quot;hemp; cannabis; numbness&quot;) or &quot;dàmá&quot; (with &quot;big; great&quot;) in Chinese, was used in Taiwan for fiber starting about 10,000 years ago. The botanist Hui-lin Li wrote that in China, &quot;The use of Cannabis in medicine was probably a very early development. Since ancient humans used hemp seed as food, it was quite natural for them to also discover the medicinal properties of the plant.&quot; Emperor Shen-Nung, who was also a pharmacologist, wrote a book on treatment methods in 2737 BCE that included the medical benefits of cannabis. He recommended the substance for many ailments, including constipation, gout, rheumatism, and absent-mindedness. Cannabis is one of the 50 &quot;fundamental&quot; herbs in traditional Chinese medicine.

The Ebers Papyrus () from Ancient Egypt describes medical cannabis. The ancient Egyptians used hemp (cannabis) in suppositories for relieving the pain of hemorrhoids.

Surviving texts from ancient India confirm that cannabis&#x27; psychoactive properties were recognized, and doctors used it for treating a variety of illnesses and ailments, including insomnia, headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, and pain, including during childbirth.

The Ancient Greeks used cannabis to dress wounds and sores on their horses, and in humans, dried leaves of cannabis were used to treat nose bleeds, and cannabis seeds were used to expel tapeworms.

In the medieval Islamic world, Arabic physicians made use of the diuretic, antiemetic, antiepileptic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties of &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot;, and used it extensively as medication from the 8th to 18th centuries.

=== Landrace strains ===
Cannabis seeds may have been used for food, rituals or religious practices in ancient Europe and China. Harvesting the plant led to the spread of cannabis throughout Eurasia about 10,000 to 5,000 years ago, with further distribution to the Middle East and Africa about 2,000 to 500 years ago. A landrace strain of cannabis developed over centuries. They are cultivars of the plant that originated in one specific region.

Widely cultivated strains of cannabis, such as &quot;Afghani&quot; or &quot;Hindu Kush&quot;, are indigenous to the Pakistan and Afghanistan regions, while &quot;Durban Poison&quot; is native to Africa. There are approximately 16 landrace strains of cannabis identified from Pakistan, Jamaica, Africa, Mexico, Central America and Asia.

=== Modern ===
An Irish physician, William Brooke O&#x27;Shaughnessy, is credited with introducing cannabis to Western medicine. O&#x27;Shaughnessy discovered cannabis in the 1830s while living abroad in India, where he conducted numerous experiments investigating the drug&#x27;s medical utility (noting in particular its analgesic and anticonvulsant effects). He returned to England with a supply of cannabis in 1842, after which its use spread through Europe and the United States. In 1845 French physician Jacques-Joseph Moreau published a book about the use of cannabis in psychiatry. In 1850 cannabis was entered into the United States Pharmacopeia. An anecdotal report of &quot;Cannabis indica&quot; as a treatment for tetanus appeared in Scientific American in 1880.

The use of cannabis in medicine began to decline by the end of the 19th century, due to difficulty in controlling dosages and the rise in popularity of synthetic and opium-derived drugs. Also, the advent of the hypodermic syringe allowed these drugs to be injected for immediate effect, in contrast to cannabis which is not water-soluble and therefore cannot be injected.

In the United States, the medical use of cannabis further declined with the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, which imposed new regulations and fees on physicians prescribing cannabis. Cannabis was removed from the U.S. Pharmacopeia in 1941, and officially banned for any use with the passage of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.

Cannabis began to attract renewed interest as medicine in the 1970s and 1980s, in particular due to its use by cancer and AIDS patients who reported relief from the effects of chemotherapy and wasting syndrome. In 1996, California became the first U.S. state to legalize medical cannabis in defiance of federal law. In 2001, Canada became the first country to adopt a system regulating the medical use of cannabis.

== Society and culture ==

=== Legal status ===


Countries that have legalized the medical use of cannabis include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malta, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay. Other countries have more restrictive laws that allow only the use of isolated cannabinoid drugs such as Sativex or Epidiolex. Countries with the most relaxed policies include Canada, the Netherlands, Thailand, and Uruguay, where cannabis can be purchased without need for a prescription. In Mexico, THC content of medical cannabis is limited to one percent. In the United States, the legality of medical cannabis varies by state.

However, in many of these countries, access may not always be possible under the same conditions.

==== International law ====
Cannabis and its derivatives are subject to regulation under three United Nations drug control treaties: the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.

Cannabis and cannabis resin are classified as a Schedule I drug under the Single Convention treaty, meaning that medical use is considered &quot;indispensible for the relief of pain and suffering&quot; but that it is considered to be an addictive medication with risks of abuse. Countries have an obligation to provide access and sufficient availability of drugs listed in Schedule I for the purposes of medical uses.

Prior to December 2020 cannabis and cannabis resin were also included in Schedule IV, a more restrictive level of control, which is for only the most dangerous drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. They were removed after an independent scientific assessment by the World Health Organization in 2018-1029.

Member nations of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs voted 27–25 to remove it from Schedule IV on 2 December 2020, following a World Health Organization recommendation for removal in January 2019.

==== United States ====
In the United States, the use of cannabis for medical purposes is legal in 38 states, four out of five permanently inhabited U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia. An additional 10 states have more restrictive laws allowing the use of low-THC products. Cannabis remains illegal at the federal level under the Controlled Substances Act, which classifies it as a Schedule I drug with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. In December 2014, however, the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment was signed into law, prohibiting the Justice Department from prosecuting individuals acting in accordance with state medical cannabis laws.

In the US, the FDA has approved two oral cannabinoids for use as medicine in 1985: dronabinol (pure delta-9-THC; brand name Marinol) and nabilone (a synthetic neocannabinoid; brand name Cesamet). In the US, they are both listed as Schedule II, indicating high potential for side effects and addiction.

=== Economics ===

==== Distribution ====
The method of obtaining medical cannabis varies by region and by legislation. In the US, most consumers grow their own or buy it from cannabis dispensaries in states where it is legal. Marijuana vending machines for selling or dispensing cannabis are in use in the United States and are planned to be used in Canada. In 2014, the startup Meadow began offering on-demand delivery of medical marijuana in the San Francisco Bay Area, through their mobile app.

Almost 70% of medical cannabis is exported from the United Kingdom, according to a 2017 United Nations report, with much of the remaining amount coming from Canada and the Netherlands.

==== Insurance ====
In the United States, health insurance companies may not pay for a medical marijuana prescription as the Food and Drug Administration must approve any substance for medicinal purposes. Before this can happen, the FDA must first permit the study of the medical benefits and drawbacks of the substance, which it has not done since it was placed on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970. Therefore, all expenses incurred fulfilling a medical marijuana prescription will possibly be incurred as out-of-pocket. However, the New Mexico Court of Appeals has ruled that workers&#x27; compensation insurance must pay for prescribed marijuana as part of the state&#x27;s Medical Cannabis Program.

=== Positions of medical organizations ===
Medical organizations that have issued statements in support of allowing access to medical cannabis include the American Nurses Association, American Public Health Association, American Medical Student Association, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Epilepsy Foundation, and Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.

Organizations that oppose the legalization of medical cannabis include the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Psychiatric Association. However, the AAP also supports rescheduling for the purpose of facilitating research.

The American Medical Association and American College of Physicians do not take a position on the legalization of medical cannabis, but have called for the Schedule I classification to be reviewed. The American Academy of Family Physicians and American Society of Addiction Medicine also do not take a position, but do support rescheduling to better facilitate research. The American Heart Association says that &quot;many of the concerning health implications of cannabis include cardiovascular diseases&quot; but that it supports rescheduling to allow &quot;more nuanced ... marijuana legislation and regulation&quot; and to &quot;reflect the existing science behind cannabis&quot;. The American Cancer Society and American Psychological Association have noted the obstacles that exist for conducting research on cannabis, and have called on the federal government to better enable scientific study of the drug.

Cancer Research UK say that while cannabis is being studied for therapeutic potential, &quot;claims that there is solid &quot;proof&quot; that cannabis or cannabinoids can cure cancer is highly misleading to patients and their families, and builds a false picture of the state of progress in this area&quot;.

=== Nonproprietary names ===
There are three International Nonproprietary Name (INN) granted for cannabinoids: two plant-derived phytocannabinoids and one neocannabinoid:

* Dronabinol is the INN for delta-9-THC (there is a common confusion according to which the word &quot;dronabinol&quot; would only refer to synthetic delta-9-THC, which is incorrect). 
* Cannabidiol is also the official INN for the molecule, granted in 2017.
* Nabilone is the INN for a synthetic cannabinoid analog (not present in &quot;Cannabis&quot; plants).

Nabiximols is the generic name (but not recognized as an INN) of a mixture of Cannabidiol and Dronabinol. Its most common form is the oromucosal spray derived from two strains of &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; and containing THC and CBD traded under the brand name Sativex®. It is not approved in the United States, but is approved in several European countries, Canada, and New Zealand as of 2013.

As an antiemetic, these medications are usually used when conventional treatment for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy fail to work.

Nabiximols is used for treatment of spasticity associated with MS when other therapies have not worked, and when an initial trial demonstrates &quot;meaningful improvement&quot;. Trials for FDA approval in the US are underway. It is also approved in several European countries for overactive bladder and vomiting. When sold under the trade name Sativex as a mouth spray, the prescribed daily dose in Sweden delivers a maximum of 32.4 mg of THC and 30 mg of CBD; mild to moderate dizziness is common during the first few weeks.

Relative to inhaled consumption, peak concentration of oral THC is delayed, and it may be difficult to determine optimal dosage because of variability in patient absorption.

In 1964, Albert Lockhart and Manley West began studying the health effects of traditional cannabis use in Jamaican communities. They developed, and in 1987 gained permission to market, the pharmaceutical &quot;Canasol&quot;, one of the first cannabis extracts.

== Research ==
A 2022 review concluded that &quot;oral, synthetic cannabis products with high THC-to-CBD ratios and sublingual, extracted cannabis products with comparable THC-to-CBD ratios may be associated with short-term improvements in chronic pain and increased risk for dizziness and sedation.&quot;

<text>Chameleons or chamaeleons (family Chamaeleonidae) are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old World lizards with 200 species described as of June 2015. The members of this family are best known for their distinct range of colours, being capable of colour-shifting camouflage. The large number of species in the family exhibit considerable variability in their capacity to change colour. For some, it is more of a shift of brightness (shades of brown); for others, a plethora of colour-combinations (reds, yellows, greens, blues) can be seen.

Chameleons are also distinguished by their zygodactylous feet, their prehensile tail, their laterally compressed bodies, their head casques, their projectile tongues used for catching prey, their swaying gait, and in some species crests or horns on their brow and snout. Chameleons&#x27; eyes are independently mobile, and because of this the chameleon’s brain is constantly analyzing two separate, individual images of its environment. When hunting prey, the eyes focus forward in coordination, affording stereoscopic vision.

Chameleons are diurnal and adapted for visual hunting of invertebrates, mostly insects, although the large species also can catch small vertebrates. Chameleons typically are arboreal, but there are also many species that live on the ground. The arboreal species use their prehensile tail as an extra anchor point when they are moving or resting in trees or bushes; because of this, their tail is often referred to as a &quot;fifth limb&quot;. Depending on species, they range from rainforest to desert conditions and from lowlands to highlands, with the vast majority occurring in Africa (about half of the species are restricted to Madagascar), but with a single species in southern Europe, and a few across southern Asia as far east as India and Sri Lanka. They have been introduced to Hawaii and Florida.

==Etymology==

The English word &quot;chameleon&quot; ( , ) is a simplified spelling of Latin &quot;&quot;, a borrowing of the Greek (&quot;khamailéōn&quot;), a compound of (&quot;khamaí&quot;) &quot;on the ground&quot; and (&quot;léōn&quot;) &quot;lion&quot;.

==Classification==
In 1986, the family Chamaeleonidae was divided into two subfamilies, Brookesiinae and Chamaeleoninae. Under this classification, Brookesiinae included the genera &quot;Brookesia&quot; and &quot;Rhampholeon&quot;, as well as the genera later split off from them (&quot;Palleon&quot; and &quot;Rieppeleon&quot;), while Chamaeleoninae included the genera &quot;Bradypodion&quot;, &quot;Calumma&quot;, &quot;Chamaeleo&quot;, &quot;Furcifer&quot; and &quot;Trioceros&quot;, as well as the genera later split off from them (&quot;Archaius&quot;, &quot;Nadzikambia&quot; and &quot;Kinyongia&quot;). Since that time, however, the validity of this subfamily designation has been the subject of much debate, although most phylogenetic studies support the notion that the pygmy chameleons of the subfamily Brookesiinae are not a monophyletic group.

While some authorities have previously preferred to use this subfamilial classification on the basis of the absence of evidence principle, these authorities later abandoned this subfamilial division, no longer recognizing any subfamilies with the family Chamaeleonidae.

In 2015, however, Glaw reworked the subfamilial division by placing only the genera &quot;Brookesia&quot; and &quot;Palleon&quot; within the Brookesiinae subfamily, with all other genera being placed in Chamaeleoninae.

==Change of color==

Some chameleon species are able to change their skin coloration. Different chameleon species are able to vary their colouration and pattern through combinations of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, light blue, yellow, turquoise, and purple. Chameleon skin has a superficial layer which contains pigments, and under the layer are cells with very small (nanoscale) guanine crystals. Chameleons change colour by &quot;actively tuning the photonic response of a lattice of small guanine nanocrystals in the s-iridophores&quot;. This tuning, by an unknown molecular mechanism, changes the wavelength of light reflected off the crystals which changes the colour of the skin. The colour change was duplicated &quot;ex vivo&quot; by modifying the osmolarity of pieces of white skin.

Colour change in chameleons has functions in camouflage, but most commonly in social signaling and in reactions to temperature and other conditions. The relative importance of these functions varies with the circumstances, as well as the species. Colour change signals a chameleon&#x27;s physiological condition and intentions to other chameleons. Because chameleons are ectothermic, another reason why they change colour is to regulate their body temperatures, either to a darker colour to absorb light and heat to raise their temperature, or to a lighter colour to reflect light and heat, thereby either stabilizing or lowering their body temperature. Chameleons tend to show brighter colours when displaying aggression to other chameleons, and darker colours when they submit or &quot;give up&quot;. Most chameleon genera (exceptions are &quot;Chamaeleo&quot;, &quot;Rhampholeon&quot; and &quot;Rieppeleon&quot;) have blue fluorescence in a species specific pattern in their skull tubercles and in &quot;Brookesia&quot; there is also some in tubercles on the body. The fluorescence is derived from bones that only are covered in very thin skin and it possibly serves a signaling role, especially in shaded habitats.

Some species, such as Smith&#x27;s dwarf chameleon and several others in the genus &quot;Bradypodion&quot;, adjust their colours for camouflage depending on the vision of the specific predator species (for example, bird or snake) by which they are being threatened. In the introduced Hawaiian population of Jackson&#x27;s chameleon, conspicuous colour changes that are used for communication between chameleons have increased whereas anti-predator camouflage colour changes have decreased relative to the native source population in Kenya where there are more predators.

Chameleons have two superimposed layers within their skin that control their colour and thermoregulation. The top layer contains a lattice of guanine nanocrystals, and by exciting this lattice the spacing between the nanocrystals can be manipulated, which in turn affects which wavelengths of light are reflected and which are absorbed. Exciting the lattice increases the distance between the nanocrystals, and the skin reflects longer wavelengths of light. Thus, in a relaxed state the crystals reflect blue and green, but in an excited state the longer wavelengths such as yellow, orange, green, and red are reflected.

The skin of a chameleon also contains some yellow pigments, which combined with the blue reflected by a relaxed crystal lattice results in the characteristic green colour which is common of many chameleons in their relaxed state. Chameleon colour palettes have evolved through evolution and the environment. Chameleons living in the forest have a more defined and colourful palette compared to those living in the desert or savanna, which have more of a basic, brown, and charred palette.

==Evolution==

The oldest described chameleon is &quot;Anqingosaurus brevicephalus&quot; from the Middle Paleocene (about 58.7–61.7 mya) of China.
Other chameleon fossils include &quot;Chamaeleo caroliquarti&quot; from the Lower Miocene (about 13–23 mya) of the Czech Republic and Germany, and &quot;Chamaeleo intermedius&quot; from the Upper Miocene (about 5–13 mya) of Kenya.

The chameleons are probably far older than that, perhaps sharing a common ancestor with iguanids and agamids more than 100 mya (agamids being more closely related). Since fossils have been found in Africa, Europe, and Asia, chameleons were certainly once more widespread than they are today.

Although nearly half of all chameleon species today live in Madagascar, this offers no basis for speculation that chameleons might originate from there. In fact, it has recently been shown that chameleons most likely originated in mainland Africa. It appears there were two distinct oceanic migrations from the mainland to Madagascar. The diverse speciation of chameleons has been theorized to have directly reflected the increase in open habitats (savannah, grassland, and heathland) that accompanied the Oligocene period. Monophyly of the family is supported by several studies.

Daza &quot;et al.&quot; (2016) described a small (10.6 mm in snout-vent length), probably neonatal lizard preserved in the Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian boundary) amber from Myanmar. The authors noted that the lizard has &quot;short and wide skull, large orbits, elongated and robust lingual process, frontal with parallel margins, incipient prefrontal boss, reduced vomers, absent retroarticular process, low presacral vertebral count (between 15 and 17) and extremely short, curled tail&quot;; the authors considered these traits to be indicative of the lizard&#x27;s affiliation with Chamaeleonidae. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by the authors indicated that the lizard was a stem-chamaeleonid. However, Matsumoto &amp; Evans (2018) reinterpreted this specimen as an albanerpetontid amphibian. This specimen was given the name &quot;Yaksha perettii&quot; in 2020, and was noted to have several convergently chameleon-like features, including adaptations for ballistic feeding.

While the exact evolutionary history of colour change in chameleons is still unknown, there is one aspect of the evolutionary history of chameleon colour change that has already been conclusively studied: the effects of signal efficacy. Signal efficacy, or how well the signal can be seen against its background, has been shown to correlate directly to the spectral qualities of chameleon displays. Dwarf chameleons, the chameleon of study, occupy a wide variety of habitats from forests to grasslands to shrubbery. It was demonstrated that chameleons in brighter areas tended to present brighter signals, but chameleons in darker areas tended to present relatively more contrasting signals to their backgrounds. This finding suggests that signal efficacy (and thus habitat) has affected the evolution of chameleon signaling. Stuart-Fox et al. note that it makes sense that selection for crypsis is not seen to be as important as selection for signal efficacy, because the signals are only shown briefly; chameleons are almost always muted cryptic colours.

==Description==
Chameleons vary greatly in size and body structure, with maximum total lengths varying from in male &quot;Brookesia nana&quot; (one of the world&#x27;s smallest reptiles) to in the male &quot;Furcifer oustaleti&quot;. Many have head or facial ornamentation, such as nasal protrusions, or horn-like projections in the case of &quot;Trioceros jacksonii&quot;, or large crests on top of their heads, like &quot;Chamaeleo calyptratus&quot;. Many species are sexually dimorphic, and males are typically much more ornamented than the female chameleons.

Typical sizes of species of chameleon commonly kept in captivity or as pets are:

The feet of chameleons are highly adapted to arboreal locomotion, and species such as &quot;Chamaeleo namaquensis&quot; that have secondarily adopted a terrestrial habit have retained the same foot morphology with little modification. On each foot, the five distinguished toes are grouped into two fascicles. The toes in each fascicle are bound into a flattened group of either two or three, giving each foot a tongs-like appearance. On the front feet, the outer, lateral, group contains two toes, whereas the inner, medial, group contains three. On the rear feet, this arrangement is reversed, the medial group containing two toes, and the lateral group three. These specialized feet allow chameleons to grip tightly onto narrow or rough branches. Furthermore, each toe is equipped with a sharp claw to afford a grip on surfaces such as bark when climbing. It is common to refer to the feet of chameleons as didactyl or zygodactyl, though neither term is fully satisfactory, both being used in describing different feet, such as the zygodactyl feet of parrots or didactyl feet of sloths or ostriches, none of which is significantly like chameleon feet. Although &quot;zygodactyl&quot; is reasonably descriptive of chameleon foot anatomy, their foot structure does not resemble that of parrots, to which the term was first applied. As for didactyly, chameleons visibly have five toes on each foot, not two.

Some chameleons have a crest of small spikes extending along the spine from the proximal part of the tail to the neck; both the extent and size of the spikes vary between species and individuals. These spikes help break up the definitive outline of the chameleon, which aids it when trying to blend into a background.

===Senses===

Chameleons have the most distinctive eyes of any reptile. The upper and lower eyelids are joined, with only a pinhole large enough for the pupil to see through. Each eye can pivot and focus independently, allowing the chameleon to observe two different objects simultaneously. This gives them a full 360-degree arc of vision around their bodies. Prey is located using monocular depth perception, not stereopsis. Chameleons have the highest magnification (per size) of any vertebrate, with the highest density of cones in the retina.

Like snakes, chameleons do not have an outer or a middle ear, so there is neither an ear-opening nor an eardrum. However, chameleons are not deaf: they can detect sound frequencies in the range of 200–600 Hz.

Chameleons can see in both visible and ultraviolet light. Chameleons exposed to ultraviolet light show increased social behavior and activity levels, are more inclined to bask, feed, and reproduce as it has a positive effect on the pineal gland.

===Feeding===
All chameleons are primarily insectivores that feed by ballistically projecting their long tongues from their mouths to capture prey located some distance away. While the chameleons&#x27; tongues are typically thought to be one and a half to two times the length of their bodies (their length excluding the tail), smaller chameleons (both smaller species and smaller individuals of the same species) have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts. Thus, smaller chameleons are able to project their tongues greater distances than the larger chameleons that are the subject of most studies and tongue length estimates, and can project their tongues more than twice their body length.

The tongue apparatus consists of highly modified hyoid bones, tongue muscles, and collagenous elements. The hyoid bone has an elongated, parallel-sided projection, called the entoglossal process, over which a tubular muscle, the accelerator muscle, sits. The accelerator muscle contracts around the entoglossal process and is responsible for creating the work to power tongue projection, both directly and through the loading of collagenous elements located between the entoglossal process and the accelerator muscle. The tongue retractor muscle, the hyoglossus, connects the hyoid and accelerator muscle, and is responsible for drawing the tongue back into the mouth following tongue projection.

Tongue projection occurs at extremely high performance, reaching the prey in as little as 0.07 seconds, having been launched at accelerations exceeding 41 &quot;g&quot;. The power with which the tongue is launched, known to exceed 3000 W kg−1, exceeds that which muscle is able to produce, indicating the presence of an elastic power amplifier to power tongue projection. The recoil of elastic elements in the tongue apparatus is thus responsible for large percentages of the overall tongue projection performance.

One consequence of the incorporation of an elastic recoil mechanism to the tongue projection mechanism is relative thermal insensitivity of tongue projection relative to tongue retraction, which is powered by muscle contraction alone, and is heavily thermally sensitive. While other ectothermic animals become sluggish as their body temperatures decline, due to a reduction in the contractile velocity of their muscles, chameleons are able to project their tongues at high performance even at low body temperatures. The thermal sensitivity of tongue retraction in chameleons, however, is not a problem, as chameleons have a very effective mechanism of holding onto their prey once the tongue has come into contact with it, including surface phenomena, such as wet adhesion and interlocking, and suction. The thermal insensitivity of tongue projection thus enables chameleons to feed effectively on cold mornings prior to being able to behaviorally elevate their body temperatures through thermoregulation, when other sympatric lizards species are still inactive, likely temporarily expanding their thermal niche as a result.

=== Bones ===
Certain species of chameleons have bones that glow when under ultraviolet light, also known as biogenic fluorescence. Some 31 different species of &quot;Calumma&quot; chameleons, all native to Madagascar, displayed this fluorescence in CT scans. The bones emitted a bright blue glow and could even shine through the chameleon&#x27;s four layers of skin. The face was found to have a different glow, appearing as dots otherwise known as tubercles on facial bones. The glow results from proteins, pigments, chitin, and other materials that make up a chameleon&#x27;s skeleton, possibly giving chameleons a secondary signaling system that does not interfere with their colour-changing ability, and may have evolved from sexual selection.

==Distribution and habitat==
Chameleons primarily live in the mainland of sub-Saharan Africa and on the island of Madagascar, although a few species live in northern Africa, southern Europe (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta), the Middle East, southeast Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and several smaller islands in the western Indian Ocean. Introduced, non-native populations are found in Hawaii and Florida.

Chameleons are found only in tropical and subtropical regions and inhabit all kinds of lowland and mountain forests, woodlands, shrublands, savannas, and sometimes deserts, but each species tends to be a restricted to only one of a few different habitat types. The typical chameleons from the subfamily Chamaeleoninae are arboreal, usually living in trees or bushes, although a few (notably the Namaqua chameleon) are partially or largely terrestrial. The genus &quot;Brookesia&quot;, which comprises the majority of the species in the subfamily Brookesiinae, live low in vegetation or on the ground among leaf litter. Many chameleon species have small distributions and are considered threatened. Declining chameleon numbers are mostly due to habitat loss.
==Reproduction==
Most chameleons are oviparous, but all &quot;Bradypodion&quot; species and many &quot;Trioceros&quot; species are ovoviviparous (although some biologists prefer to avoid the term ovoviviparous because of inconsistencies with its use in some animal groups, instead just using viviparous).

The oviparous species lay eggs three to six weeks after copulation. The female will dig a hole—from , deep depending on the species—and deposit her eggs. Clutch sizes vary greatly with species. Small &quot;Brookesia&quot; species may only lay two to four eggs, while large veiled chameleons (&quot;Chamaeleo calyptratus&quot;) have been known to lay clutches of 20–200 (veiled chameleons) and 10–40 (panther chameleons) eggs. Clutch sizes can also vary greatly among the same species. Eggs generally hatch after four to 12 months, again depending on the species. The eggs of Parson&#x27;s chameleon (&quot;Calumma parsoni&quot;) typically take 400 to 660 days to hatch.

Chameleons lay flexible-shelled eggs which are affected by environmental characteristics during incubation. The egg mass is the most important in differentiating survivors of Chameleon during incubation. An increase in egg mass will depend on temperature and water potential. To understand the dynamics of water potential in Chameleon eggs, the consideration of exerted pressure on eggshells will be essential because the pressure of eggshells play an important role in the water relation of eggs during entire incubation period 

The ovoviviparous species, such as the Jackson&#x27;s chameleon (&quot;Trioceros jacksonii&quot;) have a five- to seven-month gestation period. Each young chameleon is born within the sticky transparent membrane of its yolk sac. The mother presses each egg onto a branch, where it sticks. The membrane bursts and the newly hatched chameleon frees itself and climbs away to hunt for itself and hide from predators. The female can have up to 30 live young from one gestation.

==Diet==
Chameleons generally eat insects, but larger species, such as the common chameleon, may also take other lizards and young birds. The range of diets can be seen from the following examples:

* The veiled chameleon, &quot;Chamaeleo calyptratus&quot; from Arabia, is insectivorous, but eats leaves when other sources of water are not available. It can be maintained on a diet of crickets. They can eat as many as 15–50 large crickets a day.
* Jackson&#x27;s chameleon (&quot;Trioceros jacksonii&quot;) from Kenya and northern Tanzania eat a wide variety of small animals including ants, butterflies, caterpillars, snails, worms, lizards, geckos, amphibians, and other chameleons, as well as plant material, such as leaves, tender shoots, and berries. It can be maintained on a mixed diet including kale, dandelion leaves, lettuce, bananas, tomatoes, apples, crickets, and waxworms.
* The common chameleon of Europe, North Africa, and the Near East, &quot;Chamaeleo chamaeleon&quot;, mainly eats wasps and mantises; such arthropods form over three-quarters of its diet. Some experts advise that the common chameleon should not be fed exclusively on crickets; these should make up no more than half the diet, with the rest a mixture of waxworms, earthworms, grasshoppers, flies, and plant materials such as green leaves, oats, and fruit.
* Some chameleons like the panther chameleon of Madagascar regulate their vitamin D3 levels, of which their insect diet is a poor source, by exposing themselves to sunlight since its UV component increases internal production.

== Anti-predator adaptations==
Chameleons are preyed upon by a variety of other animals. Birds and snakes are the most important predators of adult chameleons. Invertebrates, especially ants, put a high predation pressure on chameleon eggs and juveniles. Chameleons are unlikely to be able to flee from predators and rely on crypsis as their primary defense. Chameleons can change both their colours and their patterns (to varying extents) to resemble their surroundings or disrupt the body outline and remain hidden from a potential enemy&#x27;s sight. Only if detected, chameleons actively defend themselves. They adopt a defensive body posture, present an attacker with a laterally flattened body to appear larger, warn with an open mouth, and, if needed, utilize feet and jaws to fight back. Vocalization is sometimes incorporated into threat displays.

==Parasites==
Chameleons are parasitized by nematode worms, including threadworms (Filarioidea). Threadworms can be transmitted by biting insects such as ticks and mosquitoes. Other roundworms are transmitted through food contaminated with roundworm eggs; the larvae burrow through the wall of the intestine into the bloodstream.

Chameleons are subject to several protozoan parasites, such as &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, which causes malaria, &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;, which causes sleeping sickness, and &quot;Leishmania&quot;, which causes leishmaniasis.

Chameleons are subject to parasitism by coccidia, including species of the genera &quot;Choleoeimeria&quot;, &quot;Eimeria&quot;, and &quot;Isospora&quot;.

== As pets ==

Chameleons are popular reptile pets, mostly imported from African countries like Madagascar, Tanzania, and Togo. The most common in the trade are the Senegal chameleon (&quot;Chamaeleo senegalensis&quot;), the Yemen or veiled chameleon (&quot;Chamaeleo calyptratus&quot;), the panther chameleon (&quot;Furcifer pardalis&quot;), and Jackson&#x27;s chameleon (&quot;Trioceros jacksonii&quot;). Other chameleons seen in captivity (albeit on an irregular basis) include such species as the carpet chameleon (&quot;Furcifer lateralis&quot;), Meller’s chameleon (&quot;Trioceros melleri&quot;), Parson’s chameleon (&quot;Calumma parsonii&quot;), and several species of pygmy and leaf-tailed chameleons, mostly of the genera &quot;Brookesia&quot;, &quot;Rhampholeon&quot;, or &quot;Rieppeleon&quot;. These are among the most sensitive reptiles one can own, requiring specialized attention and care.

The U.S. has been the main importer of chameleons since the early 1980s accounting for 69% of African reptile exports. However, there have been large declines due to tougher regulations to protect species from being taken from the wild and due to many becoming invasive in places like Florida. They have remained popular though which may be due to the captive-breeding in the U.S. which has increased to the point that the U.S. can fulfill its demand, and has now even become a major exporter as well. In the U.S. they are so popular, that despite Florida having six invasive chameleon species due to the pet trade, reptile hobbyists in these areas search for chameleons to keep as pets or to breed and sell them, with some selling for up to a thousand dollars.

== Historical understandings ==
Aristotle (4th century BC) describes chameleons in his History of Animals. Pliny the Elder (1st century AD) also discusses chameleons in his Natural History, noting their ability to change colour for camouflage.

The chameleon was featured in Conrad Gessner&#x27;s &quot;Historia animalium&quot; (1563), copied from &quot;De aquatilibus&quot; (1553) by Pierre Belon.

In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the eponymous Prince says &quot;Excellent, i&#x27; faith, of the chameleon&#x27;s dish. I eat the air, promise-crammed.&quot; This refers to the Elizabethan belief that chameleons lived on nothing but the air.

<text>Modular synthesizers are synthesizers composed of separate modules for different functions. The modules can be connected together by the user to create a patch. The outputs from the modules may include audio signals, analog control voltages, or digital signals for logic or timing conditions. Typical modules are voltage-controlled oscillators, voltage-controlled filters, voltage-controlled amplifiers and envelope generators.

== History ==
The first modular synthesizer was developed by German engineer Harald Bode in the late 1950s. The 1960s saw the introduction of the Moog synthesizer and the Buchla Modular Electronic Music System, created around the same period. The Moog was composed of separate modules which created and shaped sounds, such as envelopes, noise generators, filters, and sequencers, connected by patch cords.

The Japanese company Roland released the Roland System 100 in 1975, followed by the System 700 in 1976 and the System 100m in 1979.

In the late 1970s, modular synthesizers started to be largely supplanted by highly-integrated keyboard synthesizers, samplers, sound modules, and other MIDI-connected gear. By the 1990s, modular synthesizers had fallen out of favor compared to cheaper, smaller digital and software synthesizers. However, there continued to be a community who chose the physically patched approach, the flexibility and the sound of traditional modular systems.

Since the late 1990s, there has been a resurgence in the popularity of analog synthesizers aided by physical standardization practices, an increase in available retro gear and interest, decreased production costs and increased electronic reliability and stability, the rediscovered ability of modules to control things other than sound, and a generally heightened education through the development of virtual synthesis systems such as VCV Rack, MAX/MSP, Pd and Reaktor etc.

== Types of module ==
The basic modular functions are: signal, control, logic and timing. Typically, inputs and outputs are an electric voltage.

The difference between a synthesizer module and a stand-alone effects unit is that an effects unit will have connections for input and output of the audio signal and knobs or switches for users to control various parameters of the device (for example, the modulation rate for a chorus effect) while a synthesizer module may have connections for input and output, but will also have connections so that the device&#x27;s parameters can be further controlled by other modules (for example, to connect a low-frequency oscillator module to the modulation input of a delay module to get the chorus effect.)

There exist many different types of modules. Modules with the same basic functions may have different inputs, outputs and controls, depending on their degree of complexity. Some examples include the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which may have options for sync (hard or soft), linear or exponential frequency modulation, and variable waveshape; the voltage-controlled filter (VCF) that may have both resonance and bandwidth controls; and the envelope generator which may provide outputs at each stage of the process. Examples of more complex modules include the frequency shifter, sequencer, and vocoder.

Modular synthesizers may be bulky and expensive. There are some standards that manufacturers follow for their range of physical synthesizers, such as control voltages, and gate and trigger thresholds providing general compatibility; however, connecting synthesizers from different manufacturers may require cables with different kinds of plugs.
German engineer Dieter Doepfer believed modular synthesizers could still be useful for creating unique sounds, and created a new, smaller modular system, the Doepfer A-100. This led to a new standard for modular systems, Eurorack; as of 2017, over 100 companies, including Moog and Roland, were developing Eurorack modules.

=== Typical modules ===
Modules can usually be categorized as either sources or processors. Standard modules found in a modular synthesizer are:

&quot;Sources&quot; - characterized by an output, but no signal input; it may have control inputs:
* VCO – Voltage-controlled oscillator, outputs a signal whose frequency is a function of input control voltage and settings. In its basic form, these may be simple waveforms (most usually a square wave or a sawtooth wave, but also includes pulse, triangle and sine waves), however these can be dynamically changed through such controls as sync, frequency modulation, and self-modulation.
* Noise source - Common types of noise offered by modular synthesizers include white, pink, and low frequency noise.
* LFO - A low-frequency oscillator may or may not be voltage-controlled. It may be operated with a period anywhere from a fortieth of a second to several minutes. It is generally used as a control voltage for another module. For example, modulating a VCO will produce a frequency modulation perceived as vibrato, while modulating a VCA will produce amplitude modulation perceived as tremolo, depending on the control frequency. A rectangular wave output from an LFO can be used as a logic output for timing or trigger functions on other modules.
* EG - An envelope generator is a transient voltage source. A trigger control signal applied to an envelope generator produces a single, shaped voltage. Often configured as ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) it provides a control voltage that rises and falls. Usually it controls the amplitude of a VCA or the cutoff frequency of a VCF, but the patchable structure of the synthesizer makes it possible to use the envelope generator to modulate other parameters such as the frequency or pulse width of the VCO. Simpler EGs (AD or AR) or more complex (DADSR—delay, attack, decay, sustain, release) are sometimes available.
* Sequencer or analog sequencer, is a family of compound module types that may be a source or a processor. As a source, depending upon the configuration, it may produce a sequence of voltages, usually set by adjusting values on front panel knobs. The sequencer may also output a trigger, or gate, at each step. Sequencers are stepped by a trigger being applied to the trigger input. Designs may allow for stepping forwards or backward, oscillating patterns, random order, or only using a limited number of steps. An example of an analog sequencer and controller with this level of complexity is the Doepfer A-154, A-155 combination.

&quot;Processors&quot; - characterized by a signal input and an output and may have control inputs:
* VCF - Voltage-controlled filter, which attenuates frequencies below (high-pass), above (low-pass) or both below and above (band-pass) a certain frequency. Most VCFs have variable resonance, sometimes voltage-controlled.
* VCA - Voltage-controlled amplifier, varies the amplitude of a signal in response to an applied control voltage. The response curve may be linear or exponential. Also called a two-quadrant multiplier.
* LPG - Low-pass gate, is a compound module, similar to a VCA combined with a VCF. The circuit uses a resistive opto-isolator to respond to the control voltage, which also filters the sound, allowing more high-frequency information through at higher amplification.
* RM - Ring modulator - Two audio inputs are utilized to create sum and difference frequencies while suppressing the original signals. Also called an analog multiplier or frequency mixer.
* Mixer - A module that adds voltages.
* Multiple - Fan out a voltage output to multiple inputs.
* Slew limiter - A sub-audio low-pass filter. When used in a control voltage path to an oscillator, produces a portamento effect.
* S&amp;H - Sample and hold, is usually used as a control-voltage processor. Depending upon the design, usually an ascending edge (trigger), captures the value of the voltage at the input, and outputs this voltage until the trigger input reads another voltage and repeats the process.
* Sequencer, (see also above), as a processor, may have a signal input into each step, (location or stage), which is output, when stepped to. An example of this type of sequencer is the Doepfer A-155.
* Custom control inputs - It is possible to connect any kind of voltage to a modular synthesizer as long as it remains in the usable voltage range of the instrument, usually -15V to +15V.

==Modern manufacturers of modular hardware synthesizers==

Hardware offerings range from complete systems in cases to kits for hobbyists. Many manufacturers augment their range with products based on recent re-designs of classic modules; often both the original and subsequent reworked designs are available free on the Internet, the original patents having lapsed. Many hobbyist designers also make available bare PCB boards and front panels for sale to other hobbyists.

===Form factors===
Many early synthesizer modules had height in integer inches: 11&quot; (e.g., Roland 700), 10&quot; (e.g., Wavemakers), 9&quot; (e.g., Aries), 8&quot; (e.g., ARP 2500), 7&quot; (e.g., Polyfusion, Buchla, Serge), 6&quot; (e.g., E-mu) and width in 1/4&quot; inch multiples. More recently it has become more popular to follow the standard 19&quot; rack unit system: 6U (Wiard), 5U (8.75&quot; e.g., Moog/Modcan), 4U (e.g., Serge), 3U (Eurorack).

Two 3U unit standards, in particular, are notable: Frac Rack (e.g., PAiA), which uses the entire 3U for the front panel, and Eurorack (e.g., Doepfer) which has a 2 mm horizontal lip that the front panels are seated between. Further minor variations exist where European or Japanese manufacturers round a U measurement up or down to some closer convenient metric equivalent; for example, the common 5U modules are exactly , but non-American manufacturers may prefer 220 or 230 mm.

=== Electrical ===
Other differences are in the plugs used, which can match 1/4-inch (6.3 mm) or 3.5 mm phone connectors, banana jacks, or breadboard patch leads; in the main power supply, which is most often ±12 V or ±15 V, but can range from 2.5±2.5 V to 0±18 V for different manufacturers or systems; in the trigger or gate voltages (Moog S-trigger or positive gate), with typical audio signal levels (often ±5 V with ±5 V headroom); and with control voltages of volts/octave, typically , but in some cases .

In most analog modular systems the frequency is exponentially related to the control voltage (such as 1 volt/octave or 1.2 volts/octave), sometimes called &quot;linear&quot; because the human ear perceives frequencies in a logarithmic fashion, with each octave having the same perceptual size. Some synthesizers (such as Korg MS-20, ETI 4600) use a system where the frequency (but not the perceived pitch) is linear with voltage.

Due to the continuously variable nature of knobs and sliders, reproducing an exact patch can be difficult.

==Modular software synthesizers ==
There are also software synthesizers which are organized as interconnectable modules. Many of these are virtual analog synthesizers, where the modules simulate hardware functionality. Some of them are also virtual modular systems, which simulate real historical modular synthesizers.

Computers have grown so powerful that software programs can realistically model the signals, sounds, and patchability of modular synthesizers. While potentially lacking the physical presence of desirable analog sound generation, real voltage manipulation, knobs, sliders, cables, and LEDs, software modular synthesizers offer the infinite variations and visual patching at a more affordable price and in a compact form factor.

The popular plugin formats such as VST may be combined in a modular fashion.

==Semi-modular synthesizers==
A modular synthesizer has a case or frame into which arbitrary modules can be fitted; modules are usually connected together using patch cords and a system may include modules from different sources, as long as it fits the form factors of the case and uses the same electrical specifications.

A semi-modular synthesizer on the other hand is a collection of modules from a single manufacturer that makes a cohesive product, an instrument. Modules may not be swapped out and usually a typical configuration has been pre-wired. The &quot;modules&quot; are typically not separable and may physically be parts of a contiguous circuit board. However, the manufacturer provides mechanisms to allow the user to connect modules in different orders and often to connect external components or modules (chosen and supplied by the user) between those of the instrument.

=== Matrix systems ===
Matrix systems use pin matrices or other crosspoint switches rather than patch cords. The ARP 2500 was the first synthesizer to use a fixed switch matrix. The pin matrix was made popular in the EMS VCS-3 and its descendants like the EMS Synthi 100. Other systems include the ETI 4600, and the Maplin 5600s.

The clean logical layout of these matrices has inspired a number of manufacturers like Arturia to include digitally programmable matrices in their analog or virtual analog synthesizers. Many fully digital synthesizers, like the Alesis Ion, make use of the logic and nomenclature of a &quot;modulation matrix&quot;, even when the graphical layout of a hardware matrix is completely absent.

===Patch override systems===
The different modules of a semi-modular synthesizer are wired together into a typical configuration but can be re-wired by the user using patch cords. Some examples are the ARP 2600, Anyware Semtex, Cwejman S1, EML101, Evenfall Minimodular, Future Retro XS, Korg MS-10 / MS-20 / PS-3100 / PS-3200 / PS-3300, Mungo State Zero, Roland System 100, Korg Volca Modular and Moog Mother-32 .

===Electronically reconfigurable systems===
Reconfigurable systems allow certain signals to be routed through modules in different orders without the use of patch cords. Examples include the Oberheim Matrix and Rhodes Chroma, and Moog Voyager.

==Hybrid modular synthesizers==
Hybrid synthesizers use hardware and software in combination to realize patches. Examples include the Arturia Origin by Arturia (fully self-contained), Clavia Nord Modular and Clavia Nord Modular G2 (these need an external computer to edit patches) and Audiocubes.

<doc id="175456" wikidata="Q5252737" url="?curid=175456" title="Mind–body dualism">
<text>In the philosophy of mind, mind–body dualism denotes either that mental phenomena are non-physical, or that the mind and body are distinct and separable. Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, as well as between subject and object, and is contrasted with other positions, such as physicalism and enactivism, in the mind–body problem.

Aristotle shared Plato&#x27;s view of multiple souls and further elaborated a hierarchical arrangement, corresponding to the distinctive functions of plants, animals, and humans: a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism that all three share; a perceptive soul of pain, pleasure, and desire that only humans and other animals share; and the faculty of reason that is unique to humans only. In this view, a soul is the hylomorphic form of a viable organism, wherein each level of the hierarchy formally supervenes upon the substance of the preceding level. For Aristotle, the first two souls, based on the body, perish when the living organism dies, whereas there remains an immortal and perpetual intellective part of mind. For Plato, however, the soul was not dependent on the physical body; he believed in metempsychosis, the migration of the soul to a new physical body. It has been considered a form of reductionism by some philosophers, since it enables the tendency to ignore very big groups of variables by its assumed association with the mind or the body, and not for its real value when it comes to explaining or predicting a studied phenomenon.

Dualism is closely associated with the thought of René Descartes (1641), who holds that the mind is a nonphysical—and therefore, non-spatial—substance. Descartes clearly identified the mind with consciousness and self-awareness and distinguished this from the physical brain as the seat of intelligence. Hence, he was the first documented Western philosopher to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it exists today. However, the theory of substance dualism has many advocates in contemporary philosophy such as Richard Swinburne, William Hasker, J. P. Moreland, E. J. Low, Charles Taliaferro, Seyyed Jaaber Mousavirad, and John Foster.

Dualism is contrasted with various kinds of monism. Substance dualism is contrasted with all forms of materialism, but property dualism may be considered a form of non-reductive physicalism.

==Types==
Ontological dualism makes dual commitments about the nature of existence as it relates to mind and matter, and can be divided into three different types:

# &quot;Substance dualism&quot; asserts that mind and matter are fundamentally distinct kinds of foundations.
# &quot;Property dualism&quot; suggests that the ontological distinction lies in the differences between properties of mind and matter (as in emergentism).
# &quot;Predicate dualism&quot; claims the irreducibility of mental predicates to physical predicates.

===Substance or Cartesian dualism===
Substance dualism asserts that mind and matter are fundamentally distinct kinds of foundations. There are different types of substance dualism. Most substance dualists hold the view that the mind and body are capable of causally affecting each other, known as interactionism. Notable defenders of substance dualism include John Foster, Stewart Goetz, Richard Swinburne and Charles Taliaferro.

Cartesian dualism, most famously defended by René Descartes, argues that there are two kinds of substances: mental and physical. Descartes states that the mental can exist outside of the body, and the body cannot think. Substance dualism is important historically for having given rise to much thought regarding the famous mind–body problem. It is compatible with theologies which claim that immortal souls occupy an independent realm of existence distinct from that of the physical world. Cartesians tend to equate the soul to the mind.

The Copernican Revolution and the scientific discoveries of the 17th century reinforced the belief that the scientific method was the unique way of knowledge. Bodies were seen as biological organisms to be studied in their constituent parts (materialism) by means of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and physics (reductionism). Mind–body dualism remained the biomedical paradigm and model for the following three centuries.

===Emergent dualism===

Emergent dualism is a type of substance dualism that has been defended by William Hasker and Dean Zimmerman. Emergent dualism asserts that mental substances come into existence when physical systems such as the brain reach a sufficient level of complexity. Hasker defines emergent dualism as:

Hasker has argued that emergent dualism is consistent with neuroscientific discoveries showing the dependence of mind on brain. He likens the individual mind to a magnetic field in its qualitative difference from the physical properties that generate it and also in its ability to act on the brain that generates it. Consciousness is said to arise when the brain reaches a certain threshold level of organizational complexity and when properly organized gives rise to the soul.

===Thomistic dualism===

Thomistic dualism is a type of dualism derived from the views of Thomas Aquinas. Edward Feser has written that:

Thomistic substance dualism has been defended by J. P. Moreland and Scott B. Rae. Thomistic substance dualism distinguishes itself from Cartesian substance dualism by denying that the body and soul are different substances. Instead, a person is composed of only one substance the soul whilst the body is considered an ensouled physical structure. J. P. Moreland has commented:

Eleonore Stump has suggested that Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s views on matter and the soul are difficult to define in contemporary discussion but he would fit the criteria as a non-Cartesian substance dualist.

Other terms for Thomistic dualism include hylomorphic dualism or Thomistic hylomorphism which are contrasted with substance dualism. Hylomorphism is distinct from substance dualism as it holds the view that the immaterial (form) and material (matter) are not distinct substances and only share an efficient causality.

Thomistic scholars such as Paul Chutikorn and Edward Feser have written that Aquinas was not a substance dualist. Edward Feser who has defended hylomorphic dualism has suggested that it has advantages over substance dualism such as offering a possible solution to the interaction problem. Paul Chutikorn has commented that &quot;adopting Aquinas&#x27; view of substance will provide a solution to the problem by avoiding altogether the position that man is made up of dual substances. Rather, Aquinas shows us that we can acknowledge a duality within substance itself, while maintaining its inherent substantial unity&quot;.

Aristotelian hylomorphic dualism also has many similarities with Thomistic dualism. Michael Egnor is a notable advocate of Aristotelian dualism.

===Property dualism===
Property dualism asserts that an ontological distinction lies in the differences between properties of mind and matter, and that consciousness may be ontologically irreducible to neurobiology and physics. It asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e., in the way that living human bodies are organized), mental properties emerge. Hence, it is a sub-branch of emergent materialism. What views properly fall under the &quot;property dualism&quot; rubric is itself a matter of dispute. There are different versions of property dualism, some of which claim independent categorisation.

Non-reductive physicalism is a form of property dualism in which it is asserted that all mental states are causally reducible to physical states. One argument for this has been made in the form of anomalous monism expressed by Donald Davidson, where it is argued that mental events are identical to physical events, however, strict law-governed causal relationships cannot describe relations of mental events. Another argument for this has been expressed by John Searle, who is the advocate of a distinctive form of physicalism he calls biological naturalism. His view is that although mental states are ontologically irreducible to physical states, they are causally reducible. He has acknowledged that &quot;to many people&quot; his views and those of property dualists look a lot alike, but he thinks the comparison is misleading.

===Epiphenomenalism===
Epiphenomenalism is a form of property dualism, in which it is asserted that one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states (both ontologically and causally irreducible). It asserts that while material causes give rise to sensations, volitions, ideas, etc., such mental phenomena themselves cause nothing further: they are causal dead-ends. This can be contrasted to interactionism, on the other hand, in which mental causes can produce material effects, and vice versa.

===Predicate dualism===
Predicate dualism is a view espoused by such non-reductive physicalists as Donald Davidson and Jerry Fodor, who maintain that while there is only one ontological category of substances and properties of substances (usually physical), the predicates that we use to describe mental events cannot be redescribed in terms of (or reduced to) physical predicates of natural languages.

&quot;Predicate dualism&quot; is most easily defined as the negation of &quot;predicate monism&quot;. Predicate monism can be characterized as the view subscribed to by eliminative materialists, who maintain that such intentional predicates as &quot;believe&quot;, &quot;desire&quot;, &quot;think&quot;, &quot;feel&quot;, etc., will eventually be eliminated from both the language of science and from ordinary language because the entities to which they refer do not exist. Predicate dualists believe that so-called &quot;folk psychology,&quot; with all of its propositional attitude ascriptions, is an ineliminable part of the enterprise of describing, explaining, and understanding human mental states and behavior.

For example, Davidson subscribes to anomalous monism, according to which there can be no strict psychophysical laws which connect mental and physical events under their descriptions as &quot;mental&quot; and &quot;physical&quot; events. However, all mental events also have physical descriptions. It is in terms of the latter that such events can be connected in law-like relations with other physical events. Mental predicates are irreducibly different in character (rational, holistic, and necessary) from physical predicates (contingent, atomic, and causal).

==Dualist views of mental causation==
This part is about causation between properties and states of the thing under study, not its substances or predicates. Here a state is the set of all properties of what&#x27;s being studied. Thus each state describes only one point in time.

===Interactionism===
Interactionism is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states. This is a position which is very appealing to common-sense intuitions, notwithstanding the fact that it is very difficult to establish its validity or correctness by way of logical argumentation or empirical proof. It seems to appeal to common-sense because we are surrounded by such everyday occurrences as a child&#x27;s touching a hot stove (physical event) which causes him to feel pain (mental event) and then yell and scream (physical event) which causes his parents to experience a sensation of fear and protectiveness (mental event) and so on.

===Epiphenomenalism===
Epiphenomenalism states that all mental events are caused by a physical event and have no physical consequences, and that one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states. So, the mental event of deciding to pick up a rock (&quot;&quot;M1&quot;) is caused by the firing of specific neurons in the brain (&quot;P1&quot;). When the arm and hand move to pick up the rock (&quot;P2&quot;&quot;) this is not caused by the preceding mental event &quot;M1&quot;, nor by &quot;M1&quot; and &quot;P1&quot; together, but only by &quot;P1&quot;. The physical causes are in principle reducible to fundamental physics, and therefore mental causes are eliminated using this reductionist explanation. If P1 causes both &quot;M1&quot; and &quot;P2&quot;, there is no overdetermination in the explanation for &quot;P2&quot;.

The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by Cabanis (1802), and was further explicated by Hodgson (1870) and Huxley (1874). Jackson gave a subjective argument for epiphenomenalism, but later rejected it and embraced physicalism.

===Parallelism===
Psychophysical parallelism is a very unusual view about the interaction between mental and physical events which was most prominently, and perhaps &quot;only&quot; truly, advocated by Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz. Like Malebranche and others before him, Leibniz recognized the weaknesses of Descartes&#x27; account of causal interaction taking place in a physical location in the brain. Malebranche decided that such a material basis of interaction between material and immaterial was impossible and therefore formulated his doctrine of occasionalism, stating that the interactions were really caused by the intervention of God on each individual occasion. Leibniz&#x27;s idea is that God has created a pre-established harmony such that it only seems &quot;as if&quot; physical and mental events cause, and are caused by, one another. In reality, mental causes only have mental effects and physical causes only have physical effects. Hence, the term &quot;parallelism&quot; is used to describe this view.

===Occasionalism===
Occasionalism is a philosophical doctrine about causation which says that created substances cannot be efficient causes of events. Instead, all events are taken to be caused directly by God itself. The theory states that the illusion of efficient causation between mundane events arises out of a constant conjunction that God had instituted, such that every instance where the cause is present will constitute an &quot;occasion&quot; for the effect to occur as an expression of the aforementioned power. This &quot;occasioning&quot; relation, however, falls short of efficient causation. In this view, it is not the case that the first event causes God to cause the second event: rather, God first caused one and then caused the other, but chose to regulate such behaviour in accordance with general laws of nature. Some of its most prominent historical exponents have been Al-Ghazali, Louis de la Forge, Arnold Geulincx, and Nicolas Malebranche.

===Kantianism===
According to the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, there is a distinction between actions done by desire and those performed by reason in liberty (categorical imperative). Thus, not all physical actions are caused either by matter alone or by freedom alone. Some actions are purely animal in nature, while others are the result of mind&#x27;s free action on matter.

==History==
===Ancient Greek philosophy===
Hermotimus of Clazomenae (fl. c. 6th century BCE) was a philosopher who first proposed the idea of mind being fundamental in the cause of change. He proposed that physical entities are static, while reason causes the change. Sextus Empiricus places him with Hesiod, Parmenides, and Empedocles, as belonging to the class of philosophers who held a dualistic theory of a material and an active principle being together the origin of the universe. Similar ideas were expounded by Anaxagoras.

In the dialogue &quot;Phaedo&quot;, Plato formulated his famous Theory of Forms as distinct and immaterial substances of which the objects and other phenomena that we perceive in the world are nothing more than mere shadows.

In the &quot;Phaedo&quot;, Plato makes it clear that the Forms are the &quot;universalia ante res&quot;, i.e. they are ideal universals, by which we are able to understand the world. In his allegory of the cave, Plato likens the achievement of philosophical understanding to emerging into the sunlight from a dark cave, where only vague shadows of what lies beyond that prison are cast dimly upon the wall. Plato&#x27;s forms are non-physical and non-mental. They exist nowhere in time or space, but neither do they exist in the mind, nor in the pleroma of matter; rather, matter is said to &quot;participate&quot; in form (μεθεξις, &quot;methexis&quot;). It remained unclear however, even to Aristotle, exactly what Plato intended by that.

Aristotle argued at length against many aspects of Plato&#x27;s forms, creating his own doctrine of hylomorphism wherein form and matter coexist. Ultimately however, Aristotle&#x27;s aim was to perfect a theory of forms, rather than to reject it. Although Aristotle strongly rejected the independent existence Plato attributed to forms, his metaphysics do agree with Plato&#x27;s &quot;a priori&quot; considerations quite often. For example, Aristotle argues that changeless, eternal substantial form is necessarily immaterial. Because matter provides a stable substratum for a change in form, matter always has the potential to change. Thus, if given an eternity in which to do so, it &quot;will&quot;, necessarily, exercise that potential.

Part of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;psychology&quot;, the study of the soul, is his account of the ability of humans to reason and the ability of animals to perceive. In both cases, perfect copies of forms are acquired, either by direct impression of environmental forms, in the case of perception, or else by virtue of contemplation, understanding and recollection. He believed the mind can literally assume any form being contemplated or experienced, and it was unique in its ability to become a blank slate, having no essential form. As thoughts of earth are not heavy, any more than thoughts of fire are causally efficient, they provide an immaterial complement for the formless mind.

===From Neoplatonism to scholasticism===
The philosophical school of Neoplatonism, most active in Late Antiquity, claimed that the physical and the spiritual are both emanations of &quot;the One&quot;. Neoplatonism exerted a considerable influence on Christianity, as did the philosophy of Aristotle via scholasticism.

In the scholastic tradition of Saint Thomas Aquinas, a number of whose doctrines have been incorporated into Roman Catholic dogma, the soul is the substantial form of a human being. Aquinas held the &quot;Quaestiones disputate de anima&quot;, or &#x27;Disputed questions on the soul&#x27;, at the Roman &quot;studium provinciale&quot; of the Dominican Order at Santa Sabina, the forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; during the academic year 1265–1266. By 1268 Aquinas had written at least the first book of the &quot;Sententia Libri De anima&quot;, Aquinas&#x27; commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De anima&quot;, the translation of which from the Greek was completed by Aquinas&#x27; Dominican associate at Viterbo, William of Moerbeke in 1267. Like Aristotle, Aquinas held that the human being was a unified composite substance of two substantial principles: form and matter. The soul is the substantial form and so the first actuality of a material organic body with the potentiality for life.

While Aquinas defended the unity of human nature as a composite substance constituted by these two inextricable principles of form and matter, he also argued for the incorruptibility of the intellectual soul, in contrast to the corruptibility of the vegetative and sensitive animation of plants and animals. His argument for the subsistence and incorruptibility of the intellectual soul takes its point of departure from the metaphysical principle that operation follows upon being (&quot;agiture sequitur esse&quot;), i.e., the activity of a thing reveals the mode of being and existence it depends upon. Since the intellectual soul exercises its own &quot;per se&quot; intellectual operations without employing material faculties, i.e. intellectual operations are immaterial, the intellect itself and the intellectual soul, must likewise be immaterial and so incorruptible. Even though the intellectual soul of man is able to subsist upon the death of the human being, Aquinas does not hold that the human person is able to remain integrated at death. The separated intellectual soul is neither a man nor a human person. The intellectual soul &quot;by itself&quot; is &quot;not&quot; a human person (i.e., an individual &quot;supposit&quot; of a rational nature). Hence, Aquinas held that &quot;soul of St. Peter pray for us&quot; would be more appropriate than &quot;St. Peter pray for us&quot;, because all things connected with his person, including memories, ended with his corporeal life.

The Catholic doctrine of the resurrection of the body does not subscribe that, sees body and soul as forming a whole and states that at the second coming, the souls of the departed will be reunited with their bodies as a whole person (substance) and witness to the apocalypse. The thorough consistency between dogma and contemporary science was maintained here in part from a serious attendance to the principle that there can be only one truth. Consistency with science, logic, philosophy, and faith remained a high priority for centuries, and a university doctorate in theology generally included the entire science curriculum as a prerequisite. This doctrine is not universally accepted by Christians today. Many believe that one&#x27;s immortal soul goes directly to Heaven upon death of the body.

===Descartes and his disciples===
In his &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, René Descartes embarked upon a quest in which he called all his previous beliefs into doubt, in order to find out what he could be certain of. In so doing, he discovered that he could doubt whether he had a body (it could be that he was dreaming of it or that it was an illusion created by an evil demon), but he could not doubt whether he had a mind. This gave Descartes his first inkling that the mind and body were different things. The mind, according to Descartes, was a &quot;thinking thing&quot; (), and an immaterial substance. This &quot;thing&quot; was the essence of himself, that which doubts, believes, hopes, and thinks. The body, &quot;the thing that exists&quot; (), regulates normal bodily functions (such as heart and liver). According to Descartes, animals only had a body and not a soul (which distinguishes humans from animals). The distinction between mind and body is argued in &quot;Meditation&quot; VI as follows: I have a clear and distinct idea of myself as a thinking, non-extended thing, and a clear and distinct idea of body as an extended and non-thinking thing. Whatever I can conceive clearly and distinctly, God can so create.

The central claim of what is often called &quot;Cartesian dualism&quot;, in honor of Descartes, is that the immaterial mind and the material body, while being ontologically distinct substances, causally interact. This is an idea that continues to feature prominently in many non-European philosophies. Mental events cause physical events, and vice versa. But this leads to a substantial problem for Cartesian dualism: How can an immaterial mind cause anything in a material body, and vice versa? This has often been called the &quot;problem of interactionism.&quot;

Descartes himself struggled to come up with a feasible answer to this problem. In his letter to Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine, he suggested that spirits interacted with the body through the pineal gland, a small gland in the centre of the brain, between the two hemispheres. The term &quot;Cartesian dualism&quot; is also often associated with this more specific notion of causal interaction through the pineal gland. However, this explanation was not satisfactory: &quot;how&quot; can an immaterial mind interact with the physical pineal gland? Because Descartes&#x27; was such a difficult theory to defend, some of his disciples, such as Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche, proposed a different explanation: That all mind–body interactions required the direct intervention of God. According to these philosophers, the appropriate states of mind and body were only the &quot;occasions&quot; for such intervention, not real causes. These occasionalists maintained the strong thesis that all causation was directly dependent on God, instead of holding that all causation was natural except for that between mind and body.

===Recent===

In addition to already discussed theories of dualism (particularly the Christian and Cartesian models) there are new theories in the defense of dualism. Naturalistic dualism comes from Australian philosopher, David Chalmers (born 1966) who argues there is an explanatory gap between objective and subjective experience that cannot be bridged by reductionism because consciousness is, at least, logically autonomous of the physical properties upon which it supervenes. According to Chalmers, a naturalistic account of property dualism requires a new fundamental category of properties described by new laws of supervenience; the challenge being analogous to that of understanding electricity based on the mechanistic and Newtonian models of materialism prior to Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

A similar defense comes from Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived the theory of epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not play a role in physical states. Jackson argues that there are two kinds of dualism:

# &quot;substance dualism&quot; that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances.
# &quot;property dualism&quot; that says that body and soul are different &quot;properties&quot; of the same body.

He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not yet). We can know everything, for example, about a bat&#x27;s facility for echolocation, but we will never know how the bat experiences that phenomenon.

In 2018, &quot;The Blackwell Companion to Substance Dualism&quot; was published that contains arguments for and against Cartesian dualism, emergent dualism, Thomistic dualism, emergent individualism and nonreductive physicalism. Contributors include Charles Taliaferro, Edward Feser, William Hasker, J. P. Moreland, Richard Swinburne, Lynne Rudder Baker, John W. Cooper and Timothy O&#x27;Connor.

==Arguments for dualism==
===The subjective argument===
An important fact is that minds perceive intra-mental states differently from sensory phenomena, and this cognitive difference results in mental and physical phenomena having seemingly disparate properties. The subjective argument holds that these properties are irreconcilable under a physical mind.

Mental events have a certain &quot;subjective&quot; quality to them, whereas physical ones seem not to. So, for example, one may ask what a burned finger feels like, or what the blueness of the sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like. Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events &quot;qualia.&quot; There is something &quot;that it&#x27;s like&quot; to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are &quot;qualia&quot; involved in these mental events. And the claim is that qualia cannot be reduced to anything physical.

Thomas Nagel first characterized the problem of qualia for physicalistic monism in his article, &quot;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&quot;. Nagel argued that even if we knew everything there was to know from a third-person, scientific perspective about a bat&#x27;s sonar system, we still wouldn&#x27;t know what it is like to &quot;be&quot; a bat. However, others argue that &quot;qualia&quot; are consequent of the same neurological processes that engender the bat&#x27;s mind, and will be fully understood as the science develops.

Frank Jackson formulated his well-known &quot;knowledge argument&quot; based upon similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary&#x27;s room, he asks us to consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in a black and white room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows everything there is to know about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.

However, Jackson later rejected his argument and embraced physicalism. He notes that Mary obtains knowledge not of color, but of a new intramental state, &quot;seeing color&quot;. Also, he notes that Mary might say &quot;wow,&quot; and as a mental state affecting the physical, this clashed with his former view of epiphenomenalism. David Lewis&#x27; response to this argument, now known as the &quot;ability&quot; argument, is that what Mary really came to know was simply the ability to recognize and identify color sensations to which she had previously not been exposed. Daniel Dennett and others also provide arguments against this notion.

===The zombie argument===

The zombie argument is based on a thought experiment proposed by David Chalmers over the issue of qualia or the hard problem of consciousness. The basic idea is that one can imagine, and, therefore, conceive the existence of, an apparently functioning human being/body without any conscious states being associated with it.

Chalmers&#x27; argument is that it seems plausible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe and observe about a human being must be true of the zombie. None of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be described scientifically via physics whether it is conscious or not. The mere logical possibility of a p-zombie demonstrates that consciousness is a natural phenomenon beyond the current unsatisfactory explanations. Chalmers states that one probably could not build a living p-zombie because living things seem to require a level of consciousness. However (unconscious?) robots built to simulate humans may become the first real p-zombies. Hence Chalmers half-joking calls for the need to build a &quot;consciousness meter&quot; to ascertain if any given entity, human or robot, is conscious or not.

Others such as Dennett have argued that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent, or unlikely, concept. In particular, nothing proves that an entity (e.g., a computer or robot) which would perfectly mimic human beings, and especially perfectly mimic expressions of feelings (like joy, fear, anger, ...), would not indeed experience them, thus having similar states of consciousness to what a real human would have. It is argued that under physicalism, one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one&#x27;s own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie is a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else&#x27;s.

Avshalom Elitzur has described himself as a &quot;reluctant dualist&quot;. One argument Elitzur makes in favor of dualism is an argument from bafflement. According to Elitzur, a conscious being can conceive of a P-zombie version of his/herself. However, a P-zombie cannot conceive of a version of itself that lacks corresponding qualia.

===Special sciences argument===
Howard Robinson argues that, if predicate dualism is correct, then there are &quot;special sciences&quot; that are irreducible to physics. These allegedly irreducible subjects, which contain irreducible predicates, differ from hard sciences in that they are interest-relative. Here, interest-relative fields depend on the existence of minds that can have interested perspectives. Psychology is one such science; it completely depends on and presupposes the existence of the mind.

Physics is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves. On the other hand, the study of meteorological weather patterns or human behavior is only of interest to humans themselves. The point is that having a perspective on the world is a psychological state. Therefore, the special sciences presuppose the existence of minds which can have these states. If one is to avoid ontological dualism, then the mind that &quot;has&quot; a perspective must be part of the physical reality to which it &quot;applies&quot; its perspective. If this is the case, then in order to perceive the physical world as psychological, the mind must have a perspective on the physical. This, in turn, presupposes the existence of mind.

However, cognitive science and psychology do not require the mind to be irreducible, and operate on the assumption that it has physical basis. In fact, it is common in science to presuppose a complex system; while fields such as chemistry, biology, or geology could be verbosely expressed in terms of quantum field theory, it is convenient to use levels of abstraction like molecules, cells, or the mantle. It is often difficult to decompose these levels without heavy analysis and computation. Sober has also advanced philosophical arguments against the notion of irreducibility.

===Argument from personal identity===
This argument concerns the differences between the applicability of counterfactual conditionals to physical objects, on the one hand, and to conscious, personal agents on the other. In the case of any material object, e.g. a printer, we can formulate a series of counterfactuals in the following manner:

# This printer could have been made of straw.
# This printer could have been made of some other kind of plastics and vacuum-tube transistors.
# This printer could have been made of 95% of what it is actually made of and 5% vacuum-tube transistors, etc..

Somewhere along the way from the printer&#x27;s being made up exactly of the parts and materials which actually constitute it to the printer&#x27;s being made up of some different matter at, say, 20%, the question of whether this printer is the same printer becomes a matter of arbitrary convention.

Imagine the case of a person, Frederick, who has a counterpart born from the same egg and a slightly genetically modified sperm. Imagine a series of counterfactual cases corresponding to the examples applied to the printer. Somewhere along the way, one is no longer sure about the identity of Frederick. In this latter case, it has been claimed, &quot;overlap of constitution&quot; cannot be applied to the identity of mind. As Madell puts it:

:But while my present body can thus have its partial counterpart in some possible world, my present consciousness cannot. Any present state of consciousness that I can imagine either is or is not mine. There is no question of degree here.

If the counterpart of Frederick, Frederickus, is 70% constituted of the same physical substance as Frederick, does this mean that it is also 70% mentally identical with Frederick? Does it make sense to say that something is mentally 70% Frederick? A possible solution to this dilemma is that of open individualism.

Richard Swinburne, in his book &quot;The Existence of God&quot;, put forward an argument for mind-body dualism based upon personal identity. He states that the brain is composed of two hemispheres and a cord linking the two and that, as modern science has shown, either of these can be removed without the person losing any memories or mental capacities.

He then cites a thought-experiment for the reader, asking what would happen if each of the two hemispheres of one person were placed inside two different people. Either, Swinburne claims, one of the two is me or neither is—and there is no way of telling which, as each will have similar memories and mental capacities to the other. In fact, Swinburne claims, even if one&#x27;s mental capacities and memories are far more similar to the original person than the others&#x27; are, they still may not be him.

From here, he deduces that even if we know what has happened to every single atom inside a person&#x27;s brain, we still do not know what has happened to &#x27;them&#x27; as an identity. From here it follows that a part of our mind, or our soul, is immaterial, and, as a consequence, that mind-body dualism is true.

Christian List argues that Benj Hellie&#x27;s vertiginous question, i.e. why people exist as themselves and not as someone else, and the existence of first-personal facts, are a refutation of physicalist philosophies of consciousness. However, List also argues that this also refutes standard versions of mind-body dualism that have purely third-personal metaphysics.

===Argument from reason===
Philosophers and scientists such as Victor Reppert, William Hasker, and Alvin Plantinga have developed an argument for dualism dubbed the &quot;argument from reason&quot;. They credit C. S. Lewis with first bringing the argument to light in his book &quot;Miracles&quot;; Lewis called the argument &quot;The Cardinal Difficulty of Naturalism&quot;, which was the title of chapter three of &quot;Miracles&quot;.

The argument postulates that if, as naturalism entails, all of our thoughts are the effect of a physical cause, then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. However, knowledge is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if naturalism were true, there would be no way of knowing it (or anything else), except by a fluke.

Through this logic, the statement &quot;I have reason to believe naturalism is valid&quot; is inconsistent in the same manner as &quot;I never tell the truth.&quot; That is, to conclude its truth would eliminate the grounds from which to reach it. To summarize the argument in the book, Lewis quotes J. B. S. Haldane, who appeals to a similar line of reasoning:

In his essay &quot;Is Theology Poetry?&quot;, Lewis himself summarises the argument in a similar fashion when he writes:

But Lewis later agreed with Elizabeth Anscombe&#x27;s response to his &quot;Miracles&quot; argument. She showed that an argument could be valid and ground-consequent even if its propositions were generated via physical cause and effect by non-rational factors. Similar to Anscombe, Richard Carrier and John Beversluis have written extensive objections to the argument from reason on the untenability of its first postulate.

===Cartesian arguments===
Descartes puts forward two main arguments for dualism in &quot;Meditations&quot;: firstly, the &quot;modal argument,&quot; or the &quot;clear and distinct perception argument,&quot; and secondly the &quot;indivisibility&quot; or &quot;divisibility&quot; argument.

The argument is distinguished from the zombie argument as it establishes that the mind could continue to exist without the body, rather than that the unaltered body could exist without the mind. Alvin Plantinga, J. P. Moreland, and Edward Feser have both supported the argument, although Feser and Moreland think that it must be carefully reformulated in order to be effective.

The &quot;indivisibility argument&quot; for dualism was phrased by Descartes as follows:[T]here is a great difference between a mind and a body, because the body, by its very nature, is something divisible, whereas the mind is plainly indivisible...insofar as I am only a thing that thinks, I cannot distinguish any parts in me... Although the whole mind seems to be united to the whole body, nevertheless, were a foot or an arm or any other bodily part amputated, I know that nothing would be taken away from the mind...The argument relies upon Leibniz&#x27; principle of the identity of indiscernibles, which states that two things are the same if and only if they share all their properties. A counterargument is the idea that matter is not infinitely divisible, and thus that the mind could be identified with material things that cannot be divided, or potentially Leibnizian monads.

==Arguments against dualism==

===Arguments from causal interaction===
One argument against dualism is with regard to causal interaction. If consciousness (&quot;the mind&quot;) can exist independently of physical reality (&quot;the brain&quot;), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One of the main objections to dualistic interactionism is lack of explanation of how the material and immaterial are able to interact. Varieties of dualism according to which an immaterial mind causally affects the material body and vice versa have come under strenuous attack from different quarters, especially in the 20th century. Critics of dualism have often asked how something totally immaterial can affect something totally material—this is the basic problem of causal interaction.

First, it is not clear &quot;where&quot; the interaction would take place. For example, burning one&#x27;s finger causes pain. Apparently there is some chain of events, leading from the burning of skin, to the stimulation of nerve endings, to something happening in the peripheral nerves of one&#x27;s body that lead to one&#x27;s brain, to something happening in a particular part of one&#x27;s brain, and finally resulting in the sensation of pain. But pain is not supposed to be spatially locatable. It might be responded that the pain &quot;takes place in the brain.&quot; But evidently, the pain is in the finger. This may not be a devastating criticism.

However, there is a second problem about the interaction. Namely, the question of &quot;how&quot; the interaction takes place, where in dualism &quot;the mind&quot; is assumed to be non-physical and by definition outside of the realm of science. The &quot;mechanism&quot; which explains the connection between the mental and the physical would therefore be a philosophical proposition as compared to a scientific theory. For example, compare such a mechanism to a physical mechanism that &quot;is&quot; well understood. Take a very simple causal relation, such as when a cue ball strikes an eight ball and causes it to go into the pocket. What happens in this case is that the cue ball has a certain amount of momentum as its mass moves across the pool table with a certain velocity, and then that momentum is transferred to the eight ball, which then heads toward the pocket. Compare this to the situation in the brain, where one wants to say that a decision causes some neurons to fire and thus causes a body to move across the room. The intention to &quot;cross the room now&quot; is a mental event and, as such, it does not have physical properties such as force. If it has no force, then it would seem that it could not possibly cause any neuron to fire. However, with Dualism, an explanation is required of how something without any physical properties has physical &quot;effects&quot;.

====Replies====
Alfred North Whitehead, and later David Ray Griffin, framed a new ontology (&quot;process philosophy&quot;) seeking precisely to avoid the pitfalls of ontological dualism.

The explanation provided by Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche is that of occasionalism, where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.

At the time C. S. Lewis wrote &quot;Miracles&quot;, quantum mechanics (and physical indeterminism) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, but still Lewis stated the logical possibility that, if the physical world was proved to be indeterministic, this would provide an entry (interaction) point into the traditionally viewed closed system, where a scientifically described physically probable/improbable event could be philosophically described as an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality. He states, however, that none of the arguments in his book will rely on this. Although some interpretations of quantum mechanics consider wave function collapse to be indeterminate, in others this event is defined as deterministic.

===Argument from physics===
The argument from physics is closely related to the argument from causal interaction. Many physicists and consciousness researchers have argued that any action of a nonphysical mind on the brain would entail the violation of physical laws, such as the conservation of energy.

By assuming a deterministic physical universe, the objection can be formulated more precisely. When a person decides to walk across a room, it is generally understood that the decision to do so, a mental event, immediately causes a group of neurons in that person&#x27;s brain to fire, a physical event, which ultimately results in his walking across the room. The problem is that if there is something totally non-physical &quot;causing&quot; a bunch of neurons to fire, then there is no &quot;physical&quot; event which causes the firing. This means that some physical energy is required to be generated against the physical laws of the deterministic universe—this is by definition a miracle and there can be no scientific explanation of (repeatable experiment performed regarding) where the &quot;physical&quot; energy for the firing came from. Such interactions would violate the fundamental laws of physics. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, then this would violate the law of the conservation of energy. Dualistic interactionism has therefore been criticized for violating a general heuristic principle of science: the causal closure of the physical world.

====Replies====
The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; and the &quot;New Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; provide two possible replies to the above objections. The first reply is that the mind may influence the &quot;distribution&quot; of energy, without altering its quantity. The second possibility is to deny that the human body is causally closed, as the conservation of energy applies only to closed systems. However, physicalists object that no evidence exists for the causal non-closure of the human body. Robin Collins responds that energy conservation objections misunderstand the role of energy conservation in physics. Well understood scenarios in general relativity violate energy conservation and quantum mechanics provides precedent for causal interactions, or correlation without energy or momentum exchange. However, this does not mean the mind spends energy and, despite that, it still doesn&#x27;t exclude the supernatural.

Another reply is akin to parallelism—Mills holds that behavioral events are causally overdetermined, and can be explained by either physical or mental causes alone. An overdetermined event is fully accounted for by multiple causes at once. However, J. J. C. Smart and Paul Churchland have pointed out that if physical phenomena fully determine behavioral events, then by Occam&#x27;s razor an unphysical mind is unnecessary.

Howard Robinson suggests that the interaction may involve dark energy, dark matter or some other currently unknown scientific process.

Another reply is that the interaction taking place in the human body may not be described by &quot;billiard ball&quot; classical mechanics. If a nondeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct then microscopic events are indeterminate, where the degree of determinism increases with the scale of the system. Philosophers Karl Popper and John Eccles and physicist Henry Stapp have theorized that such indeterminacy may apply at the macroscopic scale. However, Max Tegmark has argued that classical and quantum calculations show that quantum decoherence effects do not play a role in brain activity.

Yet another reply to the interaction problem is to note that it doesn&#x27;t seem that there is an interaction problem for all forms of substance dualism. For instance, Thomistic dualism doesn&#x27;t obviously face any issue with regards to interaction, for in this view the soul and the body are related as form and matter.

===Argument from brain damage===
This argument has been formulated by Paul Churchland, among others. The point is that, in instances of some sort of brain damage (e.g. caused by automobile accidents, drug abuse, pathological diseases, etc.), it is always the case that the mental substance and/or properties of the person are significantly changed or compromised. If the mind were a completely separate substance from the brain, how could it be possible that every single time the brain is injured, the mind is also injured? Indeed, it is very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind of mental or psychological deterioration or change that human beings will undergo when specific parts of their brains are damaged. So the question for the dualist to try to confront is how can all of this be explained if the mind is a separate and immaterial substance from, or if its properties are ontologically independent of, the brain.

Phineas Gage, who suffered destruction of one or both frontal lobes by a projectile iron rod, is often cited as an example illustrating that the brain causes mind. Gage certainly exhibited some mental changes after his accident, suggesting a correlation between brain states and mental states. It has been noted, however, that Gage&#x27;s most serious mental changes were only temporary, and that he made a reasonable social and mental recovery. The changes in question have almost always been distorted and exaggerated by scientific and popular literature, often relying on hearsay. Similar examples abound; neuroscientist David Eagleman describes the case of another individual who exhibited escalating pedophilic tendencies at two different times, and in each case was found to have tumors growing in a particular part of his brain.

Case studies aside, modern experiments have demonstrated that the relation between brain and mind is much more than simple correlation. By damaging, or manipulating, specific areas of the brain repeatedly under controlled conditions (e.g. in monkeys) and reliably obtaining the same results in measures of mental state and abilities, neuroscientists have shown that the relation between damage to the brain and mental deterioration is likely causal. This conclusion is further supported by data from the effects of neuro-active chemicals (e.g., those affecting neurotransmitters) on mental functions, but also from research on neurostimulation (direct electrical stimulation of the brain, including transcranial magnetic stimulation).

====Replies====

Property dualism and William Hasker&#x27;s &quot;emergent dualism&quot; seek to avoid this problem. They assert that the mind is a property or substance that emerges from the appropriate arrangement of physical matter, and therefore could be affected by any rearrangement of matter.

Writing in the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas writes that &quot;the body is necessary for the action of the intellect, not as origin of action.&quot; Thus, if the body is dysfunctional, the intellect will not actualize as it intends to. According to the philosopher Stephen Evans:

===Argument from neuroscience===
In some contexts, the decisions that a person makes can be detected up to 10 seconds in advance by means of scanning their brain activity. Subjective experiences and covert attitudes can be detected, as can mental imagery. This is strong empirical evidence that cognitive processes have a physical basis in the brain.

===Argument from simplicity===
The argument from simplicity is probably the simplest and also the most common form of argument against dualism of the mental. The dualist is always faced with the question of why anyone should find it necessary to believe in the existence of two, ontologically distinct, entities (mind and brain), when it seems possible and would make for a simpler thesis to test against scientific evidence, to explain the same events and properties in terms of one. It is a heuristic principle in science and philosophy not to assume the existence of more entities than is necessary for clear explanation and prediction.

This argument was criticized by Peter Glassen in a debate with J. J. C. Smart in the pages of &quot;Philosophy&quot; in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Glassen argued that, because it is not a physical entity, Occam&#x27;s razor cannot consistently be appealed to by a physicalist or materialist as a justification of mental states or events, such as the belief that dualism is false. The idea is that Occam&#x27;s razor may not be as &quot;unrestricted&quot; as it is normally described (applying to all qualitative postulates, even abstract ones) but instead concrete (only applies to physical objects). If one applies Occam&#x27;s Razor unrestrictedly, then it recommends monism until pluralism either receives more support or is disproved. If one applies Occam&#x27;s Razor only concretely, then it may not be used on abstract concepts (this route, however, has serious consequences for selecting between hypotheses &quot;about&quot; the abstract).

This argument has also been criticized by Seyyed Jaaber Mousavirad, who argues that the principle of simplicity could only be applied when there is no need for an additional entity. Despite arguments indicating the need for the soul, the principle of simplicity does not apply. Therefore, if there were no argument establishing the existence of the soul, one could deny its existence based on the principle of simplicity. However, various arguments have been put forth to establish its existence. These arguments demonstrate that while neuroscience can explain the mysteries of the material brain, certain significant issues, such as personal identity and free will, remain beyond the scope of neuroscience. The crux of the matter lies in the essential limitations of neuroscience and the potency of substance dualism in explaining these phenomena.

<text>Susan Lillian Townsend (; 2 April 194610 April 2014) was an English writer and humorist whose work encompasses novels, plays and works of journalism. She was best known for creating the character Adrian Mole.

After writing in secret from the age of 14, Townsend first became known for her plays, her signature character first appearing in a radio drama, but her work soon expanded into other forms. She enjoyed great success in the 1980s, with her Adrian Mole books selling more copies than any other work of fiction in Britain during the decade. This series, which eventually encompassed nine books, takes the form of the character&#x27;s diaries. The earliest books recount the life of a teenage boy during the Thatcher years, but the sequence eventually depicts Adrian Mole in middle age.

&quot;The Queen and I&quot; (1992), another popular work which was well received, was an outlet for her republican sentiments, although the Royal Family is still rendered with sympathy. Both the earliest Adrian Mole book and &quot;The Queen and I&quot; were adapted for the stage and enjoyed successful runs in London&#x27;s West End.

Townsend was poor until well into her thirties and used her experiences of hardship in her work. In her later years, she experienced ill health, in part related to the diabetes she developed in the mid-1980s, and in her last years endured serious sight and mobility problems.

==Early life==
Townsend was born at the Maternity Hospital in Causeway Lane, Leicester, the oldest of three sisters. Her father had worked at a factory making jet engines before becoming a postman, while her mother worked in a factory canteen. She attended Glen Hills Primary School, where the school secretary was Mrs Claricotes, a name she used for the school secretary in the Adrian Mole books.

At the age of eight, Townsend contracted mumps, and was obliged to stay at home. Her mother bought a collection of Richmal Crompton&#x27;s Just William books at a jumble sale which Townsend read avidly. Later, she said the William Brown character was an influence on her best-known creation.

After failing her 11-plus exam, Townsend went to the secondary modern South Wigston High School. During her childhood, while up a tree playing with her peers, she witnessed the murder of a fellow schoolgirl, but the children were not believed. The murder was committed by Joseph Christopher Reynolds (31), convicted at Leicester Assizes for the murder of Janet Warner, and hanged by Albert Pierrepoint on 17 November 1953. It was to be the last execution carried out at Leicester Prison.

==Marriage and pre-writing career==
Townsend left school at the age of fourteen and worked in a variety of jobs including packer for Birds Eye, a petrol station attendant and a receptionist. Working at a petrol station allowed her the chance to read between serving customers.

She married Keith Townsend, a sheet metal worker on 25 April 1964; the couple had three children under five by the time Townsend was 23 (Sean, Daniel, and Victoria). In 1971 the marriage ended and she became a single parent. In this position, Townsend and her children endured considerable hardship. In &quot;Mr Bevan&#x27;s Dream: Why Britain Needs Its Welfare State&quot; (1989), a short book in the &quot;Counterblasts&quot; series, she recounts an experience from when her eldest child was five. Because the Department of Social Security was unable to give her even 50p to tide them over, she was obliged to feed herself and her children on a tin of peas and an Oxo cube as an evening meal. Townsend would collect used Corona bottles, to redeem the 4p return fee by which to feed her children.

Aged thirteen, her son questioned one Sunday why they did not go to animal parks on weekends like other families. She later recounted that it was the start of her writing which became the Adrian Mole books, looking at life through the clinical eyes of a teenager but in a comedic manner. Townsend then chose to research the world of teenagers and started attending youth clubs as a volunteer organiser. This led to her training as a youth worker.

While employed as a supervisor at an adventure playground, she observed a man making canoes nearby and, because he was married, put off talking to him; it was a year before he asked her for a date. It was at a canoeing course she met her future second husband, Colin Broadway, who was the father of her fourth child, Elizabeth.

Townsend and Broadway married on 13 June 1986.

==Transition to a writing career==
Townsend&#x27;s new partner encouraged her to join a writers&#x27; group at the Phoenix Theatre, Leicester, in 1978, when she was in her early thirties. Initially too shy to speak, she did not write anything for six weeks, but was then given a fortnight to write a play. This became the thirty-minute drama &quot;Womberang&quot; (1979), set in the waiting room of a gynaecology department. At the Phoenix, she became the writer-in-residence.

During this time she was mentored by several theatre directors including Ian Giles and principally Sue Pomeroy who commissioned and directed a number of her plays including &quot;Womberang&quot;, &quot;Dayroom&quot;, &quot;Groping for Words&quot; and subsequently &quot;Ear, Nose and Throat&quot;. She was also introduced to William Ash, then chairman of the Soho Poly (now Soho Theatre), who likewise played a significant part in shaping her early career. She met writer-director Carole Hayman on the stairs of the Soho Poly theatre and went on to develop many theatre pieces with her for the Royal Court and Joint Stock, including &quot;Bazarre and Rummage&quot; and &quot;The Great Celestial Cow&quot;. They later co-wrote two television series, &quot;The Refuge&quot; and &quot;The Spinney&quot;.

At the time of writing the first Adrian Mole book, Townsend was living on the Eyres Monsell Estate, near the house in which playwright Joe Orton was brought up. Mole &quot;came into my head when my eldest son said &#x27;Why don&#x27;t we go to safari parks like other families do?&#x27; That&#x27;s the only real line of dialogue from my family that&#x27;s in any of the Mole books. It&#x27;s in because it triggered it. I remembered that kind of whiny, adolescent self-pity, that &#x27;surely these are not my parents.&#x27;&quot;

==Success of Adrian Mole==
The first two published stories appeared in a short-lived arts&#x27; journal entitled &quot;magazine,&quot; in the editing and production of which Townsend was involved, featuring the character then still called Nigel Mole. Actor Nigel Bennett had given her help and encouragement to persist with the work and sent the script to John Tydeman, the deputy head of BBC Radio Drama. The character first came to national awareness in a single radio play, &quot;The Diary of Nigel Mole, Aged 13¾&quot;, broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on New Year&#x27;s Day 1982.

Someone at the publishers Methuen heard the broadcast and commissioned Townsend to write the first book, &quot;The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾&quot; which came out in September 1982 The publisher insisted on the change of name because of the similarity to Nigel Molesworth, the schoolboy character created by Ronald Searle and Geoffrey Willans. A month after the book&#x27;s appearance it had topped the best seller list and had sold a million copies after a year. Adapted as a play, the stage version premiered in Leicester and ran at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre for more than two years. The first two books were seen by many as a realistic and humorous treatment of the inner life of an adolescent boy. They also captured something of the zeitgeist of Britain during the Thatcher era.

&quot;The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole&quot; (1984) was reputedly based on her children&#x27;s experiences at Mary Linwood Comprehensive School in Leicester. Several of the teachers who appear in the book (such as Ms Fossington-Gore and Mr Dock) are based on staff who worked at the school in the early 1980s. When the book was televised, it was mostly filmed at a different school nearby. Mary Linwood Comprehensive was closed in 1997.

These first two books were adapted into a television series, broadcast in 1985 and 1987, and a video game.

==Later life and career==
&quot;The Queen and I&quot; (1992) is a novel whose plot involves the Royal Family rehoused in a council estate after a Republican revolution. Townsend had become a republican while a child. In an interview for &quot;The Independent&quot; published in September 1992 she related that after finding the idea of God a ridiculous idea, an argument in favour of the British monarchy also collapsed. &quot;I was frightened that people believed in it all, the whole package, and I must be the only one with these feelings. It was a moment of revelation, but at the same time it would have been wicked ever to mention it.&quot; In addition, she was &quot;being taught about infinity, which I found mind-boggling. It made me feel we were all tiny, tiny specks: and if I was, then they – the Royal Family – were, too.&quot;

Like the first Mole book, &quot;The Queen and I&quot; was adapted for the stage with songs by Ian Dury and Mickey Gallagher. Michael Billington writes that Townsend &quot;was ahead of the game&quot; in treating the royal family as a suitable subject for drama. He writes: &quot;Far from seeming like a piece of republican propaganda, the play actually made the royals endearing.&quot; A later book in a similar vein, &quot;Queen Camilla&quot; (2006), was less well received.

On 25 February 2009, Leicester City Council announced that Townsend would be given the Honorary Freedom of Leicester (where she lived). Townsend became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL) in 1993. Amongst her honours and awards, she received honorary doctorates from the University of Leicester, from Loughborough University and De Montfort University, Leicester.

In 1991 Townsend appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Her chosen book was &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; by Kingsley Amis and her luxury item was a swimming pool of champagne.

==Political beliefs==

In 1989 Townsend published &quot;Mr Bevan&#x27;s Dream – Why Britain Needs its Welfare State&quot;, one of the series of &quot;Counterblast&quot; essays written by such authors as Paul Foot, Marina Warner and Fay Weldon which critiqued, either directly or indirectly the social consequences of Thatcherism.

She describes being &quot;mesmerised&quot; when seeing Aneurin Bevan, the prime mover of the British welfare state on television for the first time. The book consists of a series of short anecdotal stories which touch on ways in which the welfare and education systems of the day supported or (mostly) failed ordinary citizens. In &quot;The Quick Birth&quot;, Townsend recalls the experience of giving birth to her first child, born prematurely but who survived thanks to the dedicated National Health Service staff at her local hospital in Leicester; &quot;Community Care&quot; deals with the treatment of vulnerable people with mental health issues; &quot;Mr Smith&#x27;s privatised penis&quot;, the final section, is a dystopian satire on a future where pavements, sunlight, fresh air and even lovemaking have been sold off to private enterprise.

&quot;In this pamphlet, I have fallen back on the traditional working-class method for expressing ideas – the anecdote, or what is now called the &quot;oral tradition&quot; (which is only a fancy term for working-class people talking to each other but not bothering to record what they&#x27;ve heard&quot;).

Townsend, in a 2009 &quot;Guardian&quot; interview with Alex Clark, described herself as a &quot;passionate socialist&quot; who had no time for New Labour. &quot;I support the memory and the history of the party and I consider that these lot are interlopers&quot;, she told Clark. Despite these comments, Townsend said in 1999 that she had only voted Labour once, and in fact, her preference was &quot;Communist, Socialist Workers, or a minority party usually.&quot; The journalist Christina Patterson observed of Townsend in 2008: &quot;Her heart, it&#x27;s clear from her books and a few hours in her company, is still with the people she left behind, the people who go largely unchronicled in literature, the people who are still her friends.&quot;

==Health problems==
Townsend experienced ill health for several years. She was a chain smoker, had tuberculosis (TB), peritonitis at 23 and had a heart attack in her 30s. She developed diabetes in the 1980s. It was a condition with which she struggled, believing herself to be the &quot;world&#x27;s worst diabetic&quot;. The condition led to Townsend&#x27;s being registered blind in 2001, and she wove this theme into her work.

After experiencing kidney failure, she underwent dialysis and in September 2009 she received a kidney from her elder son Sean, after a two-year wait for a donor. She also had degenerative arthritis, which left her reliant on a wheelchair. By this time, she was dictating to Sean, who worked as her typist. Surgery was carried out at Leicester General Hospital and Townsend spoke to the BBC about her illness on an appeal for National Kidney Day.

===Death===
Townsend died at her home on 10 April 2014, eight days after her 68th birthday, following a stroke. Stephen Mangan, who portrayed Adrian Mole in the 2001 television adaptation, stated that he was &quot;greatly upset to hear that Sue Townsend has died. One of the warmest, funniest and wisest people I ever met&quot;. Townsend was survived by her husband, four children and ten grandchildren.

<text>A pseudo-anglicism is a word in another language that is formed from English elements and may appear to be English, but that does not exist as an English word with the same meaning.

For example, English speakers traveling in France may be struck by the &quot;number of anglicisms—or rather words that look English—which are used in a different sense than they have in English, or which do not exist in English (such as &quot;rallye-paper&quot;, &quot;shake-hand&quot;, &quot;baby-foot&quot;, or &quot;baby-parc&quot;)&quot;.

This is different from a false friend, which is a word with a cognate that has a different main meaning; in some cases, pseudo-anglicisms become false friends.

==Definition and terminology==
Pseudo-anglicisms are also called secondary anglicisms, false anglicisms, or pseudo-English.

Pseudo-anglicisms are a kind of lexical borrowing where the &quot;source&quot; or &quot;donor language&quot; is English, but where the borrowing is reworked in the &quot;receptor &quot; or &quot;recipient language&quot;.

The precise definition varies. Duckworth defines pseudo-anglicisms in German as &quot;neologisms derived from English language material.&quot; Furiassi includes words that may exist in English with a &quot;conspicuously different meaning&quot;.

==Typology and mechanism==
Pseudo-anglicisms can be created in various ways, such as by archaism, i.e., words that once had that meaning in English but are since abandoned; semantic slide, where an English word is used incorrectly to mean something else; conversion of existing words from one part of speech to another; or recombinations by reshuffling English units.

Onysko speaks of two types: pseudo-anglicisms and hybrid anglicisms. The common factor is that each type represents a neologism in the receptor language resulting from a combination of borrowed lexical items from English. Using German as the receptor language, an example of the first type is &quot;Wellfit-Bar&quot;, a combination of two English lexical units to form a new term in German, which does not exist in English, and which carries the meaning, &quot;a bar that caters to the needs of health-starved people.&quot; An example of the second type, is a hybrid based on a German compound word, &quot;Weitsprung&quot; (long jump), plus the English &#x27;coach&#x27;, to create the new German word &quot;Weitsprung-Coach.&quot;

According to Filipović, pseudo-anglicisms can be formed through compounding, suffixation, or ellipsis. For example, the Serbo-Croatian word was created from the English word &quot;goal&quot;, which the word &quot;man&quot; was added to. Alternatively, suffixes such as or may be added to an English word to create a new word in Serbo-Croatian, such as or . Ellipsis may also occur, wherein a component of an English word is dropped, such as the suffix &quot;-ing&quot;; examples include from &quot;boxing&quot;, or from &quot;happy ending&quot;. 

Another process of word formation that can result in a pseudo-anglicism is a blend word, consisting of portions of two words, like brunch or smog. Rey-Debove &amp; Gagnon attest &quot;tansad&quot; in French in 1919, from English &quot;tan[dem]&quot; + &quot;sad[dle]&quot;.

==Scope==

Pseudo-anglicisms can be found in many languages that have contact with English around the world, and are attested in nearly all European languages.

The equivalent of pseudo-anglicisms derived from languages other than English also exist. For example, the English-language phrase &quot;double entendre&quot;, while often believed to be French and pronounced in a French fashion, is not actually used in French. For other examples, see dog Latin, list of pseudo-French words adapted to English, and list of pseudo-German words adapted to English.

<doc id="175468" wikidata="Q254713" url="?curid=175468" title="Iva Toguri D'Aquino">
<text>Iva Ikuko Toguri D&#x27;Aquino (; July 4, 1916 – September 26, 2006) was an American citizen visiting Japan when World War II began. Unable to return to the United States, she risked her life smuggling food to American service men held in prisoner of war camps. 

The Japanese authorities forced Toguri to work as a disc jockey and radio personality on English-language radio broadcasts transmitted by Radio Tokyo to Allied troops in the South Pacific during World War II on the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; radio show. Toguri refused to broadcast anti-American propaganda, and tried to make a farce of the broadcasts. Toguri called herself &quot;Orphan Annie&quot;, but she quickly became inaccurately identified with the name &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot;, coined by Allied soldiers and which predated her broadcasts. 

After the surrender of Japan, Toguri was detained for a year by the United States military for possible wrongdoing against the U.S. but was released for lack of evidence and U.S. Department of Justice officials agreed that her broadcasts were &quot;innocuous&quot;.

However, when Toguri tried to return to the U.S. a popular uproar ensued, prompting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to renew its investigation of her wartime activities. She was subsequently charged by the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office with eight counts of treason, which were based on false testimony forced from witnesses by the prosecutors. Her 1949 trial resulted in a conviction on one count, for which she served more than six years, out of a ten-year sentence in prison.

Journalistic and governmental investigators years later pieced together the history of irregularities with the indictment, trial, and conviction, including confessions from key witnesses that they had perjured themselves at the various stages of their testimonies due to government threats. 

Toguri received a full pardon from President Gerald Ford in 1977.

==Early life==
Toguri was born in Los Angeles, and was a daughter of Japanese immigrants. Her father, Jun Toguri, had come to the U.S. in 1899, and her mother, Fumi, in 1913. Iva was a Girl Scout, and was raised as a Christian. She began grammar schools in Calexico and San Diego before returning with her family to complete her education in Los Angeles, where she attended Compton High School. Toguri graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1940 with a degree in zoology. In 1940, she registered to vote as a Republican.

On July 5, 1941, Toguri sailed for Japan from the San Pedro, Los Angeles, area, to visit an ailing relative. The U.S. State Department issued her a Certificate of Identification; she did not have a passport. In August, Toguri applied to the U.S. Vice Consul in Japan for a passport, stating she wished to return to her home in the U.S. Her request was forwarded to the State Department, but following the attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941), the State Department refused to certify her citizenship in 1942.

==&quot;The Zero Hour&quot;==
Toguri was pressured to renounce her United States citizenship by the Japanese central government with the beginning of American involvement in the Pacific War, like other Americans in Japanese territory. She refused to do so, and was subsequently declared an enemy alien and was refused a war ration card. To support herself, she found work as a typist at a Japanese news agency and eventually worked in a similar capacity for Radio Tokyo.

In November 1943, Allied prisoners of war were forced to broadcast propaganda, and she was selected to host portions of the one-hour radio show &quot;The Zero Hour&quot;. Her producer was Australian Army Major Charles Cousens, who had pre-war broadcast experience and had been captured at the Fall of Singapore. Cousens had been coerced to work on radio broadcasts, and worked with assistants U.S. Army Captain Wallace Ince and Philippine Army Lieutenant Normando Ildefonso &quot;Norman&quot; Reyes. Toguri had previously risked her life smuggling food into the nearby prisoner of war camp where Cousens and Ince were held, gaining the inmates&#x27; trust. Toguri refused to broadcast anti-American propaganda, but she was assured by Major Cousens and Captain Ince that they would not write scripts having her say anything against the United States. True to their word, no such propaganda was found in her broadcasts. After she went on air in November 1943, she and Cousens tried to make a farce of the broadcasts. Japanese propaganda officials had little feel for their nuance and double entendres.

Toguri performed in comedy sketches and introduced recorded music, but never participated in any newscasts, with on-air speaking time of generally about 2–3 minutes. She earned only 150 yen per month, or about $7, but she used some of her earnings to feed POWs, smuggling food in as she did before. She aimed most of her comments toward her fellow Americans (&quot;my fellow orphans&quot;), using American slang and playing American music. At no time did Toguri call herself &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot; during the war, and there was no evidence that any other broadcaster had done so. The name was a catch-all used by Allied forces for all of the women who were heard on Japanese propaganda radio and was in general use by the summer of 1943, months prior to Toguri&#x27;s debut as a broadcast host. Toguri hosted about 340 broadcasts of &quot;The Zero Hour&quot; under the stage names &quot;Ann&quot; (for &quot;Announcer&quot;) and later &quot;Orphan Annie&quot;, in reference to the comic strip character Little Orphan Annie.

In April 1945, Toguri married Felipe D&#x27;Aquino, a Portuguese citizen of part-Japanese descent she had met at the radio station, and became Iva Toguri D&#x27;Aquino.

==Postwar arrest and trial==
===Arrest===
After Japan&#x27;s surrender (August 15, 1945), reporters Harry T. Brundidge of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; Magazine and Clark Lee of Hearst&#x27;s International News Service (INS) offered $2,000 (the equivalent of a year&#x27;s wages in Occupied Japan) for an exclusive interview with &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot;.

Toguri was in need of money and was still trying to get home, so she accepted the offer, but instead found herself arrested on September 5, 1945, in Yokohama. Brundidge reneged on the interview payment and tried to sell his transcript of the interview as Toguri&#x27;s &quot;confession&quot;. She was released after a year in prison when neither the FBI nor General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s staff found any evidence that she had aided the Japanese Axis forces. The American and Australian prisoners of war who wrote her scripts told her and the Allied headquarters that she had committed no wrongdoing.

The case history at the FBI&#x27;s website states, &quot;The FBI&#x27;s investigation of [D&#x27;Aquino&#x27;s] activities had covered a period of some five years. During the course of that investigation, the FBI had interviewed hundreds of former members of the U.S. Armed Forces who had served in the South Pacific during World War II, unearthed forgotten Japanese documents, and turned up recordings of [D&#x27;Aquino&#x27;s] broadcasts.&quot; Investigating with the U.S. Army&#x27;s Counterintelligence Corps, they &quot;conducted an extensive investigation to determine whether [D&#x27;Aquino] had committed crimes against the U.S. By the following October, authorities decided that the evidence then known did not merit prosecution, and she was released&quot;.

She requested to return to the United States in order to have her child born on American soil, but influential gossip columnist and radio host Walter Winchell lobbied against her. Her baby was born in Japan but died shortly after. Following her child&#x27;s death, D&#x27;Aquino was rearrested by the U.S. military authorities and transported to San Francisco on September 25, 1948.

===Treason trial===
D&#x27;Aquino was charged by federal prosecutors with the crime of treason for &quot;adhering to, and giving aid and comfort to, the Imperial Government of Japan during World War II&quot;&#x27;. Her trial on eight &quot;overt acts&quot; of treason began on July 5, 1949, at the Federal District Court in San Francisco. It was the costliest and longest trial in American history at the time. D&#x27;Aquino was defended by a team of attorneys led by Wayne Mortimer Collins, a prominent advocate of Japanese-American rights. Collins enlisted the help of Theodore Tamba, who became one of D&#x27;Aquino&#x27;s closest friends, a relationship which continued until his death in 1973. One of the defense witnesses was Charles Cousens, who himself had been acquitted of treason by Australian authorities in November 1946.

On September 29, 1949, the jury found D&#x27;Aquino guilty on a single charge: Count VI, which stated, &quot;That on a day during October, 1944, the exact date being to the Grand Jurors unknown, said defendant, at Tokyo, Japan, in a broadcasting studio of The Broadcasting Corporation of Japan, did speak into a microphone concerning the loss of ships.&quot; She was fined $10,000, given a 10-year prison sentence, and stripped of her citizenship, with Toguri&#x27;s attorney Collins lambasting the verdict as &quot;Guilty without evidence&quot;. She was sent to the Federal Reformatory for Women at Alderson, West Virginia. She was paroled after serving six years and two months, released January 28, 1956, and moved to Chicago.

==Presidential pardon==
The case against D&#x27;Aquino was fraught with legal difficulties. Grand jurors had been skeptical of the government&#x27;s case. Tom DeWolfe, the Special Assistant Attorney General, was &quot;a veteran of radio treason prosecutions&quot; who complained that &quot;it was necessary for me to practically make a fourth of July speech in order to obtain [an] indictment&quot;, leading him to urge the Department of Justice to further investigate and so &quot;shore up&quot; the case in Japan. The further work, however, &quot;created new problems for DeWolfe&quot;, and soon after D&#x27;Aquino was indicted, government witness Hiromu Yagi &quot;admitted that his grand jury testimony was perjured&quot;. The FBI&#x27;s case history notes, &quot;Neither Brundidge [the &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; Magazine reporter who tried to sell his transcript of the interview with D&#x27;Aquino] nor the [suborned] witness [Hiromu Yagi] testified at trial because of the taint of perjury. Nor was Brundidge prosecuted for subornation of perjury.&quot;

In 1976, an investigation by &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporter Ron Yates discovered that Kenkichi Oki and George Mitsushio, who had given the most damaging testimony at D&#x27;Aquino&#x27;s trial, had perjured themselves. They stated that FBI and U.S. occupation police had coached them for over two months about what they were to say on the stand, and had been threatened with treason trials themselves if they did not cooperate. This was followed up by a Morley Safer report on the television news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

US President Gerald Ford granted a full and unconditional pardon to Iva Toguri D&#x27;Aquino in 1977 based on these and earlier issues with the indictment, trial, and conviction,—on January 19, his last full day in office. The decision was supported by a unanimous vote in both houses of the California State Legislature, by the national Japanese American Citizens League, and by S. I. Hayakawa, then a United States senator from California. The pardon restored her U.S. citizenship, which had been abrogated as a result of her conviction.

==Later life==
In 1980, she reluctantly divorced Felipe, after he was repeatedly denied admission into the United States.

On January 15, 2006, the World War II Veterans Committee awarded Toguri its annual Edward J. Herlihy Citizenship Award, citing &quot;her indomitable spirit, love of country, and the example of courage she has given her fellow Americans&quot;. According to one biographer, Toguri found it the most memorable day of her life.

Toguri died of natural causes in a Chicago hospital on September 26, 2006, at the age of 90.

==Legacy==
Iva Toguri has been the subject of two movies and five documentaries:

* 1946: &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot;, film; directed by Lew Landers. Lotus Long played a heavily fictionalized &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot;, described on the film&#x27;s posters as a &quot;seductive Jap traitress&quot;; Byron Barr played the G.I. protagonist who kidnaps the Japanese announcer. Blake Edwards appeared in a supporting part. The film espoused the general public&#x27;s view of &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot; at the time of Toguri&#x27;s arrest. The film&#x27;s character was not referred to by her actual name, but Long was made to look like Toguri.
* 1969: &quot;The Story of &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot;&quot;, CBS-TV and WGN radio documentary written and produced by Bill Kurtis.
* 1976: &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot;, CBS-TV documentary segment on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; by Morley Safer.
* 1995: &quot;U.S.A. vs. &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot;&quot;, self-produced documentary by Antonio A. Montanari Jr., distributed by Cinema Guild.
* 1995: &quot;Tokyo Rose: Victim of Propaganda&quot;, A&amp;E Biography documentary hosted by Jack Perkins and featuring Toguri, Wayne Collins, Jr., Gerald Ford (archive footage), Bill Kurtis, and others.
* 1999: &quot;Tokyo Rose: Victim of Propaganda&quot;, History International, produced by Scott Paddor.
* In 2004, actor George Takei announced that he was working on a film titled &quot;Tokyo Rose, American Patriot&quot; about Toguri&#x27;s activities during the war.
* 2008: Frank Darabont was slated to direct a new film &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot; with Darkwoods Productions, which had been planned since 2003.
* On July 20, 2009, &quot;History Detectives&quot; (Season 7, Episode 705) aired a 20-minute segment entitled &quot;Tokyo Rose Recording&quot; researched by Gwendolyn Wright tracing the recording of live coverage of Iva Toguri&#x27;s September 25, 1948, arrival in San Francisco under military escort for trial. The investigation of the origins of this recording documents the involvement of self-serving reporter Harry T. Brundidge and his part in the fraudulent case against her.

<text>George Sainton Kaye Butterworth, MC (12 July 18855 August 1916) was an English composer who was best known for the orchestral idyll &quot;The Banks of Green Willow&quot; and his song settings of A. E. Housman&#x27;s poems from &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. He was awarded the Military Cross for his gallantry during the fighting at Pozières in the First World War, and died in the Battle of the Somme.

==Early years==

Butterworth was born in Paddington, London. Soon after his birth, his family moved to York so that his father Sir Alexander Kaye Butterworth could take up an appointment as general manager of the North Eastern Railway, which was based there. Their home was at Riseholme, a house on Driffield Terrace, which later became part of the Mount School. In 2016, the centenary year of his death on the Somme, biographer Anthony Murphy unveiled on behalf of the York Civic Trust a blue plaque to his memory at College House, Driffield Terrace, part of the Mount School.

George received his first music lessons from his mother, who was a singer, and he began composing at an early age. As a young boy, he played the organ for services in the chapel of his preparatory school, Aysgarth School, before gaining a scholarship to Eton College. He showed early musical promise at Eton, a &quot;Barcarolle&quot; for orchestra being played during his time there (it is long since lost).

Butterworth then went up to Trinity College, Oxford, where he became more focused on music, becoming President of the University Music Club. He also made friends with the folk song collector Cecil Sharp; the composer and folk song enthusiast Ralph Vaughan Williams; the future Director of the Royal College of Music, Hugh Allen; and a baritone and future conductor, Adrian Boult. Butterworth and Vaughan Williams made several trips into the English countryside to collect folk songs (Butterworth collected over 450 himself, many in Sussex in 1907, and sometimes using a phonograph) and the compositions of both were strongly influenced by what they collected. Butterworth was also an expert folk dancer, being particularly keen in the art of morris dancing. He was employed for a while by the English Folk Dance and Song Society (of which he was a founder member in 1906) as a professional morris dancer, and was a member of the Demonstration Team.

Upon leaving Oxford, Butterworth began a career in music, writing criticism for &quot;The Times&quot;, composing, and teaching at Radley College, Oxfordshire. He also briefly studied piano and organ at the Royal College of Music, where he worked with Hubert Parry among others, though he stayed less than a year as the academic life was not for him.

Vaughan Williams and Butterworth became close friends. It was Butterworth who suggested to Vaughan Williams that he turn a symphonic poem he was working on into his &quot;London Symphony&quot;. Vaughan Williams recalled:

We were talking together one day when he said in his gruff, abrupt manner: ‘You know, you ought to write a symphony’. I answered...that I’d never written a symphony and never intended to...I suppose Butterworth’s words stung me and, anyhow, I looked out some sketches I had made for...a symphonic poem about London and decided to throw it into symphonic form...From that moment, the idea of a symphony dominated my mind. I showed the sketches to George bit by bit as they were finished, and it was then that I realised that he possessed in common with very few composers a wonderful power of criticism of other men’s work and insight into their ideas and motives. I can never feel too grateful to him for all he did for me over this work and his help did not stop short at criticism.

When the manuscript for that piece was lost (having been sent to Germany, either to the conductor Fritz Busch or for engraving, just before the outbreak of war), Butterworth, together with Geoffrey Toye and the critic Edward J. Dent, helped Vaughan Williams reconstruct the work. Vaughan Williams dedicated the piece to Butterworth&#x27;s memory after his death.

==First World War==
At the outbreak of the First World War, Butterworth, together with several of his friends, including Geoffrey Toye and R. O. Morris, joined the British Army as a private in the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry, but he soon accepted a commission as a subaltern (2nd Lieutenant) in the 13th Battalion Durham Light Infantry, and he was later temporarily promoted to lieutenant. He was known as G. S. Kaye-Butterworth in the Army. Butterworth&#x27;s letters are full of admiration for the ordinary miners of County Durham who served in his platoon. As part of 23rd Division, the 13th DLI was sent into action to capture the western approaches of the village of Contalmaison on The Somme. Butterworth and his men succeeded in capturing a series of trenches near Pozières on 16–17 July 1916, the traces of which can still be found within a small wood. Butterworth was slightly wounded in the action. For his action Temporary Lt. George Butterworth, aged 31, was awarded the Military Cross, gazetted 25 August 1916, though he did not live to receive it. The citation for the medal reads as follows:

The Battle of the Somme was now entering its most intense phase. On 4 August, 23rd Division was ordered to attack a communications trench known as Munster Alley that was in German hands. The soldiers dug an assault trench and named it &#x27;Butterworth Trench&#x27; in their officer&#x27;s honour. In desperate fighting during the night of 4–5 August, and despite friendly fire from Australian artillery, Butterworth and his miners captured and held on to Munster Alley, albeit with heavy losses. At 04:45 on 5 August, amid frantic German attempts to recapture the position, Butterworth was shot through the head by a sniper. His body was hastily buried by his men in the side of the trench, but was never recovered for formal reburial following the fierce bombardments of the final two years of conflict.

When his brigade commander, Brigadier General Page Croft, wrote to Butterworth&#x27;s father to inform him of his death, it transpired that he had not known that his son had been awarded the Military Cross. Similarly, the brigadier was astonished to learn that Butterworth had been one of the most promising English composers of his generation. Brigadier Croft wrote that Butterworth was &quot;A brilliant musician in times of peace, and an equally brilliant soldier in times of stress.&quot;

There is confusion about exactly what award(s) Butterworth received. It is said that he won the MC twice, but this is incorrect. This misunderstanding may have arisen because Butterworth&#x27;s bravery was regularly in evidence during the Somme campaign. Firstly, he was mentioned in despatches early in July, and was then recommended for the MC &quot;for conspicuous gallantry in action&quot; on 9 July at Bailiff Wood, then again – successfully – &quot;for commanding his company with great ability and coolness&quot; when wounded on 16–17 July. Brigadier Page-Croft also mentioned to Butterworth&#x27;s father that he had &#x27;won&#x27; the medal again on the night he died. However, the Military Cross was not awarded posthumously at the time, and so he could never have been awarded it twice.

Butterworth&#x27;s body was never recovered (although his unidentified remains may well lie at nearby Pozières Memorial, a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery), and his name appears on the Thiepval Memorial. George Butterworth&#x27;s &quot;The Banks of Green Willow&quot; has become synonymous for some with the sacrifice of his generation and has been seen by some as an anthem for all &#x27;Unknown Soldiers&#x27;. Sir Alexander Butterworth erected a plaque at St Mary&#x27;s Priory Church, Deerhurst, Gloucestershire in memory of his son and of his nephew, Hugh, who died at Loos in 1915. (The Rev. George Butterworth, the composer&#x27;s grandfather, had been vicar of St Mary&#x27;s in the previous century.) Sir Alexander also arranged the printing in 1918 of a memorial volume in his son&#x27;s memory. His name is one of the 38 on the War Memorial at the Royal College of Music.

Almost all Butterworth&#x27;s manuscripts were left to Vaughan Williams, after whose death Ursula Vaughan Williams lodged the original works in the Bodleian, Oxford, and the folk song collection with the EFDSS.

==&quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, and other compositions==
Butterworth did not write a great deal of music, and before and during the war he destroyed many works he did not care for, lest he should not return and have the chance to revise them. Of those that survive, his works based on A. E. Housman&#x27;s collection of poems &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; are among the best known. Many English composers of Butterworth&#x27;s time set Housman&#x27;s poetry, including Ralph Vaughan Williams.

In 1911 and 1912, Butterworth wrote eleven settings of Housman&#x27;s poems from &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. The poems are

# &quot;Loveliest of Trees&quot;
# &quot;When I Was One and Twenty&quot;
# &quot;Look Not in My Eyes&quot;
# &quot;Think No More, Lad&quot;
# &quot;The Lads in Their Hundreds&quot;
# &quot;Is My Team Ploughing&quot;
# &quot;Bredon Hill&quot;
# &quot;Oh Fair Enough Are Sky and Plain&quot;
# &quot;When the Lad for Longing Sighs&quot;
# &quot;On the Idle Hill of Summer&quot;
# &quot;With Rue My Heart Is Laden&quot;

He used no known folk tunes in the songs, although one (&quot;When I Was One and Twenty&quot;) was said to be based on a folk tune that has defied identification. The songs were dedicated to Victor Annesley Barrington-Kennett, a friend from Eton and Oxford, who was also to die in France in 1916. They were eventually published in two sets, &quot;Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad&quot; (1–6 above) and &quot;Bredon Hill and Other Songs&quot; (7–11), although the composer never settled on a preferred order. Nine of the songs were first performed by James Campbell McInnes (baritone) and Butterworth (piano) on 16 May 1911 at a meeting of the Oxford University Musical Club, organized by Boult. Shortly thereafter Boult sang several of the songs at a private function. At this stage, Butterworth still had not completed &quot;On the idle hill of summer&quot; and did not do so until he was living at Cheyne Gardens in London. It is unusual for the songs to be given publicly in full, although each of the published sets is often performed separately and recorded regularly – in fact, they can be said to be among the most frequently performed English art songs. &quot;Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad&quot; is the more popular set, with &quot;Is My Team Ploughing?&quot; being the most famous song. Another, &quot;Loveliest of Trees&quot;, is the basis for his 1912 orchestral rhapsody, also called &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, which quotes two songs from the whole – &quot;Loveliest of Trees&quot; and &quot;With Rue My Heart Is Laden&quot;.

The parallel is regularly made between the often gloomy and death-obsessed subject matter of &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, written in the shadow of the Second Boer War, and Butterworth&#x27;s subsequent death during the Great War. In particular, the song &quot;The lads in their hundreds&quot; tells of young men who leave their homeland to &#x27;die in their glory and never be old&#x27;.

The &quot;Rhapsody, A Shropshire Lad&quot; – a sort of postlude to the songs – employs a normal sized symphony orchestra, and was first performed on 2 October 1913 at the Leeds Festival, conducted by Arthur Nikisch. It was influential upon Vaughan Williams (A Pastoral Symphony), Gerald Finzi (A Severn Rhapsody) and Ernest Moeran (First Rhapsody). Butterworth&#x27;s other orchestral works are short and based on folksongs he had collected in Sussex in 1907: &quot;Two English Idylls&quot; (1911) and &quot;The Banks of Green Willow&quot; (1913). They are often performed and recorded, &quot;Banks&quot; particularly so. The latter work was premiered by the 24-year-old Adrian Boult on 27 February 1914, at West Kirby, Wirral, (this was in fact Boult&#x27;s very first professional concert).

&quot;Love Blows As the Wind Blows&quot; is a setting of poems by W. E. Henley. It exists in three forms: for voice and string quartet, voice and piano and voice and small orchestra. The orchestral version differs from the others quite markedly, not least in having only three songs: &quot;In the Year That&#x27;s Come and Gone&quot;, &quot;Life in Her Creaking Shoes&quot;, and &quot;On the Way to Kew&quot; (the other versions include &quot;Fill a Glass with Golden Wine&quot;). The orchestral version was in fact the last music Butterworth worked on before leaving for France, and shows the composer&#x27;s familiarity with Vaughan Williams&#x27; style, as well as with the music of Wagner, Elgar and Debussy.

Butterworth showed real talent that might have flourished but for his early death. The &quot;Two English Idylls&quot; and &quot;The Banks of Green Willow&quot; show an ability to handle folk song in a way that eluded many other composers – as the true building blocks of larger forms. His original music (especially the &quot;Rhapsody: A Shropshire Lad&quot; and the orchestral song cycle &quot;Love Blows As The Wind Blows&quot;) have a delicacy that brings to mind Debussy or Ibert. However, there is reasonable evidence that he had put composition behind him by the time he went to France, and it is by no means certain that he would have resumed it had he returned. It is certainly likely that he would have faced considerable pressure from friends to compose again, since his orchestral works (particularly the &quot;Rhapsody: A Shropshire Lad&quot;) had made a great impression, but he was a single-minded man who was unlikely to bow easily to such pressure. He remains perhaps the most obvious case of &quot;what if...?&quot; that is left to us from the battlefields of northern France, and he joins the Frenchman Albéric Magnard, the Spaniard Enrique Granados, and the German Rudi Stephan as possibly the greatest losses to music from the First World War. The great conductor Carlos Kleiber saw in Butterworth a special gift. In his 1978 appearance with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra he programmed, to the surprise of many, Butterworth&#x27;s &quot;English Idyll No. 1&quot;.
