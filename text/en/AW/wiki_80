<text>Zheng Chenggong, Prince of Yanping (; 27 August 1624 – 23 June 1662), better known internationally as Koxinga (), was a Southern Ming general who resisted the Qing conquest of China in the 17th century, fighting them on China&#x27;s southeastern coast.

In 1661, Koxinga defeated the Dutch outposts on Taiwan and established Zheng dynastic rule on the island, which continued to exist until 1683.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Zheng Chenggong was born in 1624 in Hirado, Hizen Province, Japan, to Zheng Zhilong, a Chinese merchant, and a Japanese woman known only by her surname &quot;Tagawa,&quot; probably Tagawa Matsu. He was raised there until the age of seven with the Japanese name Fukumatsu (福松) and then moved to Fujian province of Ming dynasty China.

In 1638, Zheng became a &quot;Xiucai&quot; (, lit. &quot;successful candidate&quot;) in the imperial examination and became one of the twelve &quot;Linshansheng&quot; () of Nan&#x27;an. In 1641, Koxinga married the niece of Dong Yangxian, an official who was a &quot;Jinshi&quot; from Hui&#x27;an. In 1644, Koxinga studied at the Guozijian (Imperial University), where he met the scholar Qian Qianyi and became his student.

===Under the Longwu Emperor===
Following the fall of Ming Dynasty in 1644, in 1645, the Prince of Tang was installed on the throne of the Southern Ming as the Longwu Emperor with support from Zheng Zhilong and his family. The Longwu Emperor established his court in Fuzhou, which was controlled by the Zhengs. In the later part of the year, Prince Lu proclaimed himself regent () in Shaoxing and established his own court there. Although Prince Lu and Longwu&#x27;s regimes stemmed from the same dynasty, each pursued different goals.

Owing to the natural defenses of Fujian and the military resources of the Zheng family, the emperor was able to remain safe for some time. The Longwu Emperor granted Zheng Zhilong&#x27;s son, Zheng Sen, a new given name, &quot;Chenggong&quot; (), and the title of &quot;Koxinga&quot; (&quot;Lord of the Imperial Surname&quot;). One of his cousins also had it.

In 1646, Koxinga first led the Ming armies to resist the Manchu invaders and won the favor of the Longwu Emperor. The Longwu Emperor&#x27;s reign in Fuzhou was brief, as Zheng Zhilong refused to support his plans for a counteroffensive against the rapidly expanding forces of the newly established Qing dynasty by the Manchus. Zheng Zhilong ordered the defending general of Xianxia Pass (), Shi Fu (a.k.a. Shi Tianfu, a relative of Shi Lang), to retreat to Fuzhou even when Qing armies approached Fujian. For this reason, the Qing army faced little resistance when it conquered the north of the pass. In September 1646, Qing armies broke through the inadequately defended mountain passes and entered Fujian. Zheng Zhilong retreated to his coastal fortress and the Longwu Emperor faced the Qing armies alone. Longwu&#x27;s forces were destroyed; he was captured and was executed in October 1646.

===Zheng Zhilong&#x27;s surrender and the death of Tagawa===
The Qing forces sent envoys to meet Zheng Zhilong secretly and offered to appoint him as the governor of both Fujian and Guangdong provinces if he would surrender to the Qing. Zheng Zhilong agreed and ignored the objections of his family, surrendering himself to the Qing forces in Fuzhou on 21 November 1646. Koxinga and his uncles were left as the successors to the leadership of Zheng Zhilong&#x27;s military forces. Koxinga operated outside Xiamen and recruited many to join his cause in a few months. He used the superiority of his naval forces to launch amphibious raids on Manchu-occupied territory in Fujian and he managed to take Tong&#x27;an in Quanzhou prefecture in early 1647. However, Koxinga&#x27;s forces lacked the ability to defend the newly occupied territory.

Following the fall of Tong&#x27;an to Zheng, the Manchus launched a counterattack in the spring of 1647, during which they stormed the Zheng family&#x27;s hometown of Anping. Koxinga&#x27;s mother, Lady Tagawa, had come from Japan in 1645 to join her family in Fujian (Koxinga&#x27;s younger brother, Tagawa Shichizaemon, remained in Japan). She did not follow her husband to surrender to the Qing dynasty. She was caught by Manchu forces in Anping and committed suicide after refusal to submit to the enemy, according to traditional accounts.

===Resistance to the Qing===

By 1650, Koxinga was strong enough to establish himself as the head of the Zheng family. He pledged allegiance to the Yongli Emperor of Southern Ming, who created him Prince of Yanping (延平王). The Yongli Emperor was fleeing from the Manchus with a motley court and hastily assembled army. Despite one fruitless attempt, Koxinga was unable to do anything to aid the last Ming emperor. Instead, he decided to concentrate on securing his own position on the southeast coast.

Koxinga had a series of military successes in 1651 and 1652 that increased the Qing government&#x27;s anxiety over the threat he posed. Zheng Zhilong wrote a letter to his son from Beijing, presumably at the request of the Shunzhi Emperor and the Qing government, urging his son to negotiate with the Manchurians. The long series of negotiations between Koxinga and the Qing dynasty lasted until November 1654. The negotiations ultimately failed. The Qing government then appointed Prince Jidu (son of Jirgalang) to lead an attack on Koxinga&#x27;s territory after this failure.

On 9 May 1656, Jidu&#x27;s armies attacked Kinmen (Quemoy), an island near Xiamen that Koxinga had been using to train his troops. Partly as a result of a major storm, the Manchus were defeated, and they lost most of their fleet in the battle. Koxinga had sent one of his naval commanders to capture Zhoushan island prior to Jidu&#x27;s attack, and now that the Manchus were temporarily without an effective naval force in the Fujian area, Koxinga was free to send a huge army to Zhoushan, which he intended to use as a base to capture Nanjing.

Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father successfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga&#x27;s attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus considered returning to Manchuria and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga&#x27;s iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga&#x27;s forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing.

Koxinga&#x27;s Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing. The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on 24 August. Koxinga&#x27;s forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements — though cavalry attacks by the city&#x27;s forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived. Koxinga&#x27;s forces were defeated and slipped back to the ships which had brought them.

===In Taiwan===

In 1661, Koxinga led his troops on a landing at &quot;Lakjemuyse&quot; to attack the Dutch colonists in Dutch Formosa. Koxinga said to the Dutch &quot;Hitherto this island had always belonged to China, and the Dutch had doubtless been permitted to live there, seeing that the Chinese did not require it for themselves; but requiring it now, it was only fair that Dutch strangers, who came from far regions, should give way to the masters of the island.&quot;

The Taiwanese Aboriginal tribes, who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652, now turned against the Dutch during the Siege of Fort Zeelandia by defecting to Koxinga&#x27;s Chinese forces. The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty and proceeded to work for the Chinese, beheading Dutch people. The frontier Aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and by destroying Dutch Protestant school textbooks.

On 1 February 1662, the Dutch Governor of Formosa, Frederick Coyett, surrendered Fort Zeelandia to Koxinga. According to Frederick Coyett&#x27;s own self-justifying account written after the siege, Koxinga&#x27;s life was saved at the end of the siege by a certain Hans Jurgen Radis of Stockaert, a Dutch defector who strongly advised him against visiting the ramparts of the fort after he had taken it, which Radis knew would be blown up by the retreating Dutch forces. This claim of a Dutch defector only appears in Coyett&#x27;s account and Chinese records make no mention of any defector. In the peace treaty, Koxinga was styled &quot;Lord Teibingh Tsiante Teysiancon Koxin&quot; (). This effectively ended 38 years of Dutch rule on Taiwan. Koxinga then devoted himself to transforming Taiwan into a military base for loyalists who wanted to restore the Ming dynasty.

Koxinga formulated a plan to give oxen and farming tools and teach farming techniques to the Taiwanese Aboriginals, giving them Ming gowns and caps and gifting tobacco to Aboriginals who were gathering in crowds to meet and welcome him as he visited their villages after he defeated the Dutch.

===In the Philippines===

In 1662, Koxinga&#x27;s forces raided several towns in the Philippines. Koxinga&#x27;s chief advisor was an Italian friar named Vittorio Riccio, whom he sent to Manila to demand tribute from the colonial government of the Spanish East Indies, threatening to expel the Spaniards if his demands were not met. The Spanish refused to pay the tribute and reinforced the garrisons around Manila, but the planned attack never took place due to Koxinga&#x27;s sudden death in that year after expelling the Dutch from Taiwan.

Koxinga&#x27;s threat to invade the islands and expel the Spanish was an important factor in the Spanish failure to conquer the Muslim Moro people in Mindanao. The threat of Chinese invasion forced the Spanish to withdraw their forces to Manila. They immediately evacuated their fort on Zamboanga in Mindanao following Koxinga&#x27;s threats. They left some troops in Jolo and by Lake Lanao to engage the Moro in protracted conflict. They permanently abandoned their colony in the Maluku Islands (Moluccas) and withdraw their soldiers from there to Manila.

===Death===
Koxinga died of unspecified illness in June 1662, only a few months after defeating the Dutch in Taiwan, at the age of 37. Contemporary accounts named heat stroke and cold as causes and modern historians suspect malaria. Qing history claimed that he died in a sudden fit of madness when his officers refused to carry out his orders to execute his son Zheng Jing, who had had an affair with his wet nurse and conceived a child with her. Zheng Jing succeeded his father as the Prince of Yanping. According to the historian Roberts Antony, &quot;the death of Zheng Chenggong began the downturn of family fortunes.&quot;

==Family==
Zheng Chenggong’s short but eventful career was characterized by family tension and conflicting loyalties. The title of Koxinga (&quot;Lord of the Imperial Surname&quot;) was one that Zheng himself used during his lifetime to emphasize his status as an adopted son of the deposed imperial house, so it was also a declaration of ongoing support to the Ming dynasty. Despite his deliberate self-identification as the noble, loyal vassal of a vanquished master, Koxinga’s actual relationship with the Longwu Emperor lasted only twelve months or so, beginning in September 1645 and ending with the Emperor&#x27;s death the following year. Although many secondary sources claim that the two men shared a &quot;close bond of affection&quot;, there is an absence of any reliable contemporary evidence on Koxinga’s relationship with the Longwu Emperor.

In contrast, Koxinga&#x27;s father Zheng Zhilong left his Japanese wife not long after the birth of his son; Koxinga was a boy of seven when he finally joined his father on the Fujianese coast. It seems that Zheng Zhilong recognized his son’s talent and encouraged him in his studies and the pursuit of a career as a scholar-official, which would legitimize the power the Zheng family had acquired, using sometimes questionable means. Zheng Zhilong’s defection to the Qing must have seemed opportunistic and in stark contrast to Koxinga’s continued loyalty to the Ming. But it is difficult to deny that in refusing to submit to the Qing, Koxinga was risking the life of his father, and that the subsequent death of Zheng Zhilong could only be justified by claiming loyalty to the Ming. It has even been suggested that Koxinga’s fury at the incestuous relationship between his son, Zheng Jing, and a younger son’s wet nurse was due to the fact that strict Confucian morality had played such a crucial role in justifying his lack of filial behaviour.

The one possible exception to this may have been his relationship with his mother, which has generally been described as being extremely affectionate, particularly in Chinese and Japanese sources. Their time together, however, was apparently very short – despite frequent entreaties from Zheng Zhilong for her to join him in China, Koxinga’s mother was only reunited with her son some time in 1645, and a year later she was killed when the Qing took Xiamen.

A portrait of Zheng was in the hands of Yuchun who was his descendant in the eight generation.

Koxinga&#x27;s descendants live in both mainland China and Taiwan and descendants of his brother Shichizaemon live in Japan. His descendants through his grandson Zheng Keshuang served as Bannermen in Beijing until 1911 when the Xinhai revolution broke out and the Qing dynasty fell, after which they moved back to Anhai and Nan&#x27;an in southern Fujian. They still live there to this day. His descendants through one of his sons Zheng Kuan live in Taiwan.

One of Koxinga&#x27;s descendants on mainland China, Zheng Xiaoxuan 鄭曉嵐, fought against the Japanese invaders in the Second Sino-Japanese War. His son was born in Shandong in mainland China and called himself a &quot;child of the resistance&quot; against Japan and he became a refugee during the war, moving from place to place across China to avoid the Japanese. He moved to Taiwan in 1949 and focuses his poetry work on building stronger ties between Taiwan and mainland China. Zheng Chouyu identified as Chinese. He felt alienated after he was forced to move to Taiwan in 1949 which was previously under Japanese rule and felt strange and foreign to him. Chouyu is Koxinga&#x27;s 11th generation descendant and his original name is Zheng Wenji.

===Concubine===
In 1661, during the Siege of Fort Zeelandia, Koxinga executed Dutch missionary Antonius Hambroek and took his teenage daughter as a concubine. Other Dutch (or part Dutch) women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their &quot;wives&quot;. In 1684 some of these women were still captives of the Chinese.

===Personality===
Koxinga was reputed to be mentally unstable: to have a vicious temper and a tendency towards ordering executions. While this might be explained by the trauma of his family being killed by the Qing army and his mother&#x27;s reported suicide (in order to prevent capture by the Qing), it was also speculated that he suffered from syphilis, a suspicion held by a Dutch doctor, Christian Beyer, who treated him.

Vittorio Riccio, a Dominican missionary who knew Koxinga, noted that Koxinga held samurai ideals on bravery, used &quot;feigned and hearty laughter&quot; to show anger, and adhered to &quot;bushido&quot; because of his samurai training and his Japanese upbringing. One Spanish missionary proffered a personal opinion that his bad temper and reported propensity for violence was due to Japanese heritage; however, this same missionary&#x27;s account of the number of executions attributed to Koxinga was greatly exaggerated.

Koxinga suffered from &quot;depressive insanity&quot; and mental illness according to Dr. Li Yengyue.

==Modern-day legacy and influences==


=== Worship ===
It is debated whether he was clean-shaven or wore a beard.

Koxinga&#x27;s legacy is treated similarly on each side of the Taiwan Strait. Koxinga is worshiped as a god in coastal China, especially Fujian, by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and in Taiwan. There is a temple dedicated to Koxinga and his mother in Tainan City, Taiwan. The National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, one of the most prestigious universities in Taiwan, is named after him.

Koxinga&#x27;s army also brought the Qinxi fraternal brotherhood into Taiwan, of which some of his army were members of the organization. In the present day, the Qinxi currently exists in Taiwan. The Hongmen are associated with them.

Tokugawa Japan imported books from Qing China including works on the Zheng family. The Qing built a shrine to commemorate Koxinga to counteract the Japanese and French in Taiwan in the 19th century. Zheng Juzhong&#x27;s books Zheng Chenggong zhuan was imported to Japan and reprinted in 1771.

=== In modern politics ===
Koxinga has received renewed attention since rumors began circulating that the People’s Liberation Army Navy were planning to name their newly acquired aircraft carrier, the ex-Soviet Varyag, the &quot;Shi Lang&quot;. Admiral Shi Lang famously defeated Koxinga’s descendants in the 1683 Battle of Penghu, thus bringing Taiwan under Qing rule. However, the Chinese government denied all allegations that the vessel would be dedicated to the decorated Qing dynasty admiral.

Koxinga is regarded as a hero in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Taiwan, and Japan, but historical narratives regarding Koxinga frequently differ in explaining his motives and affiliation. Japan treats him as a native son and emphasized his maternal link to Japan in propaganda during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. The People&#x27;s Republic of China considers Koxinga a national hero for driving the imperialist Dutch away from Taiwan and establishing ethnic Chinese rule over the island. On mainland China, Koxinga is honoured as the &quot;Conqueror of Taiwan, Great Rebel-Quelling General&quot; a military hero who brought Taiwan back within the Han Chinese sphere of influence through expanded economic, trade and cultural exchanges. In China, Koxinga is honoured without the religious overtones found in Taiwan.

The Republic of China, which withdrew to Taiwan after losing the Chinese Civil War, regards Koxinga as a patriot who also retreated to Taiwan and used it as a base to launch counterattacks against the Qing dynasty of mainland China (drawing parallels to the Republic of China&#x27;s hypothetical reclamation of the mainland, comparing the ROC to the Ming dynasty and the PRC to the Qing dynasty). In Taiwan, Koxinga is honored as the island’s most respected saint for expelling the Dutch and seen as the original ancestor of a free Taiwan, and is known as Kaishan Shengwang, or &quot;the Sage King who Opened up Taiwan&quot; and as &quot;The Yanping Prince&quot;, referring to the Kingdom of Tungning, which he established in modern-day Tainan.

In Taiwan, Koxinga is remembered and revered as a divine national hero with hundreds of temples, schools, tertiary educations, and other public centers named in his honor. Koxinga is accredited with replacing Dutch colonial rule with a more modern political system. Furthermore, Koxinga transformed Taiwan into an agrarian society through the introduction of new agricultural methods such as the proliferation of iron farming tools and new farming methods with cattle. For these reasons, Koxinga is often associated with &quot;hints of [a] consciousness of Taiwanese independence,&quot; although Koxinga himself wanted Taiwan unified with the rest of China. Great care was taken to symbolize support for the Ming legitimacy, an example being the use of the term &quot;guan&quot; instead of &quot;bu&quot; to name departments, since the latter is reserved for central government, whereas Taiwan was to be a regional office of the rightful Ming rule of China.

=== In art ===
The play &quot;The Battles of Coxinga&quot; was written by Chikamatsu Monzaemon in Japan in the 18th century, first performed in Kyoto. A 2001 film titled &quot;The Sino-Dutch War 1661&quot; starred Vincent Zhao as Koxinga. The film was renamed &quot;Kokusenya Kassen&quot; after the aforementioned play and released in Japan in 2002.

The historical novel &quot;Lord of Formosa&quot; by Dutch author Joyce Bergvelt uses Koxinga as the main character.

===In video games===
*Zheng Chenggong appears as a Master in the 2023 Japanese video game &quot;Fate/Samurai Remnant&quot;, his Servant is the also Chinese general Zhou Yu.

<text>Arya Samaj () is a monotheistic Indian Hindu reform movement that promotes values and practices based on the belief in the infallible authority of the Vedas. The sannyasi (ascetic) Dayananda Saraswati founded the samaj in the 1870s.

Arya Samaj was the first Hindu organization to introduce proselytization in Hinduism.
== Etymology ==
&quot;&quot;Arya Samaj&quot; is a compound Sanskrit term consisting of the words &quot;arya&quot; and &quot;samaj&quot;.&quot; The term &quot;&quot;arya&quot; refers to an individual who possesses virtuous attributes and noble characteristics, whereas &quot;samaj&quot; denotes a social group or organized community. Therefore, the term &quot;arya samaj&quot;&quot; refers to a community of individuals of high moral character.

==History==

=== The beginning ===
Swami Dayanand Saraswati established the Arya Samaj in April 1875 in Bombay with ten principles. However, these principles were finally settled in 1877 in Lahore.
===Vedic schools===
Between 1869 and 1873, Dayanand began his efforts to reform orthodox Hinduism in India. He established &quot;Gurukul&quot; (Vedic schools) which emphasised Vedic values, culture, and &quot;Satya&quot; (Truth). The schools gave separate educations to boys and girls based on ancient Vedic principles. The Vedic school system was also to relieve Indians from the pattern of a British education.

===Emergence of Arya Samaj in Punjab===
Due to Schisms in Adi Brahmo Samaj at Calcutta, a new variant of Adi Brahmoism called Arya Samaj began to take root in the Punjab. When he traveled to Calcutta Swami Dayanand had come into close and extended contact with Raj Narayan Bose, Debendranath Tagore etc. Swami Dayanand closely studied Tagore&#x27;s book Brahmo Dharma, a comprehensive manual of religion and ethics for Adi Dharma, while in Calcutta. The bone of contention between these two Samajs was over the authority of the Vedas–whose authority the Adi Dharma rejected and held to be inferior works, whereas Arya Samaj held Vedas to be divine revelation. Despite this difference of opinion, however, it seems that the members of the Brahmo Samaj and Swami Dayanand parted on good terms, the former having publicly praised the latter’s visit to Calcutta in several journals and the latter having taken inspiration from the former’s activity in the social sphere.

==Growth of Arya Samaj after Dayanand==
Dayanand was assassinated in 1883. Despite this setback, the Arya Samaj continued to grow, especially in Punjab. The early leaders of the Samaj were Pandit Lekh Ram (18581897) and Swami Shraddhanand (Mahatma Munshi Ram Vij) (18561926). Some authors claim that the activities of the Samaj led to increased antagonism between Muslims and Hindus. Shraddhanand led the Shuddhi movement that aimed to bring Hindus who had converted to other religions back to Hinduism.

In 1893, the Arya Samaj members of Punjab were divided on the question of vegetarianism. The group that refrained from eating meat were called the &quot;Mahatma&quot; group and the other group, the &quot;Cultured Party&quot;.

In the early 1900s, the Samaj (or organizations inspired by it such as &quot;Jat Pat Todak Mandal&quot;) campaigned against caste discrimination. They also campaigned for widow remarriage and women&#x27;s education. The samaj also established chapters in British colonies having Indian population such as South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius, Suriname, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.

Prominent Indian Nationalists such as Lala Lajpat Rai belonged to Arya Samaj and were active in its campaigning. Bhagat Singh&#x27;s grandfather followed Arya Samaj, which had a considerable influence on Bhagat Singh. The British colonial government in the early part of 20th century viewed the Samaj as a political body. Some Samajis in government service were dismissed for belonging to the Samaj.

In the 1930s, when the Hindu Nationalist group, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh grew in prominence in Northern India, they found support from the Arya Samaj of Punjab.

===Arya Samaj in Punjab===
In Punjab, the Arya Samaj was opposed by the Ahmadiyya movement which provided the Samaj one of its most aggressive opponents from among the various Muslim groups and whose founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was extensively involved in theological disputations with Samaj leaders, most notably with Pandit Lekh Ram. It was also opposed by the Sikh dominated Singh Sabha, the forerunner of the Akali Dal. It was also opposed by Vaishnavs, who were criticized by Dayānanda Sarasvatī.

===Arya Samaj in Sindh===
The Samaj was active in Sindh at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. The activities of the Samaj in the region included using shuddhi in integrating half-Muslim or low-caste communities into the organization. Narayan Dev, a Samaj member active in making many conversions is extolled as a Sindhi martyr. He is sometimes referred to as &#x27;Dayanand ka vir sipahi&#x27; (Dayanand&#x27;s heroic soldier). Dev was killed in a street fight in 1948. The history of Sindhi nationalism is also tied with the activities of the Arya Samaj. In the 19th century, the Hindu community of Sindh had been challenged by Christian missionaries and the Samaj served as a deterrent to the &quot;conversion&quot; done by Christian missionaries in the region. A Hindu Sindhi leader, K. R. Malkani, later on, became prominent in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and the BJP. According to Malkani, the Arya Samaj created a &quot;new pride&quot; among the Hindu Sindhis by opening gymnasia and Sanskrit pathshalas in the 1930s.

===Arya Samaj in Gujarat===
The Arya Samaj of Gujarat members were missionaries from Punjab who had been encouraged to move to Gujarat to carry out educational work amongst the untouchable castes by the Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III. The Gujarat Samaj opened orphanages. The Samaj started losing support when Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in 1915 because many activist joined his movement.

===Reconversion in Malabar===
In 1921, during a rebellion by the Muslim Moplah community of Malabar Indian newspapers reported that several Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam. The Arya Samaj extended its efforts to the region to reconvert these people back to Hinduism through Shuddhi ceremonies.

===Views of Orthodox Hindus on the Samaj===
The then Shankaracharya of Badrinath Math in 1939 in a letter to the archbishop of Canterbury, called Arya Samajis Un-Hindu. He also criticized the Samaj efforts at converting Christians and Muslims.

===Arya Samaj in Hyderabad state===
A branch of Arya Samaj was established at Dharur in Beed district of Hyderabad state, the largest princely state during British colonial rule. Keshav Rao Koratkar was the president of the organization until 1932. During his tenure, the Samaj established schools and libraries throughout the state. Although a social and religious organization, the Samaj activities assumed a great political role in resisting the government of the Nizam during the 1930s. In 1938–1939, Arya Samaj teamed up with the Hindu Mahasabha to resist the Nizam government through Satyagraha. The Nizam government responded by raiding and desecrating Arya Samaj mandirs. The Samaj, in turn, criticized Islam and the Islamic rulers of the state. This widely increased the gulf between the Hindu and Muslim populations of the state.

===Language issue===
Arya Samaj promoted the use of Hindi in Punjab and discouraged the use of Punjabi. This was a serious point of difference between the Sikhs, represented by the Shiromani Akali Dal group and the Arya Samaj. The difference was marked during the period immediately following the independence of India and the time of the Punjabi Suba movement (demand for a Punjabi-speaking state).

===Humanitarian efforts===
Arya Samaj is a charitable organisation. For example, donations were made to victims of the 1905 Kangra earthquake. The samaj campaigned for women&#x27;s right to vote and for the protection of widows. From 2 million in 1947, in 2011 there were an estimated 10 million Arya Samajis in the world, mostly found in India, running more than 1,000 colleges, 10,000 schools as well as thousands of charitable dispensaries and public libraries.

==Contemporary Arya Samaj==

===Arya Samaj in India===
Arya Samaj schools and temples are found in almost all major cities and as well as in rural areas (especially in the North) of India. Some are authorised to conduct weddings. The Samaj is associated with the Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) schools which number over eight hundred. There are eight million followers of the Samaj in India.

===Arya Samaj around the world===
Arya Samaj is active in countries including Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Fiji, Australia, South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius and other countries where a significant Hindu diaspora is present. The Arya Samaj in Kenya runs several schools in Nairobi and other cities of the country.

Immigrants to Canada and the United States from South Asia, Eastern Africa, South Africa, and the Caribbean countries have set up Arya Samaj temples for their respective communities. Most major metropolitan areas of the United States have chapters of Arya Samaj.

==Core beliefs==

Members of the Arya Samaj believe in a creator God referred to as the syllable &#x27;Aum&#x27; mentioned in the Yajurveda (40:17). They believe the Vedas are an infallible authority, and they respect the Upanishads and other Vedic philosophy. They reject other non-Vedic religious texts in Hinduism. For instance, they believe epics like the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; are legends of historical figures, and reject them as a reference to supreme beings and avatars. The members of Arya Samaj also reject other Hindu scriptural works such as the Puranas. Worship of idols (&quot;murti puja&quot;) is strictly prohibited in the samaj.

The core beliefs of Arya Samaj are postulated below:

# The primaeval cause of all genuine knowledge and all that is known by means of knowledge is God.
# God is truth-consciousness: formless, omnipotent, unborn, infinite, unchangeable, incomparable, , internal, undecaying, immortal, eternal, holy, and creator of the universe. God alone deserves worship.
# The Vedas are repositories of all of true knowledge. It is the paramount duty of all Aryas to study and teach and to propound the Vedas.
# One should be ever ready to imbibe truth and forsake untruth.
# All acts should be done in accordance with Dharma, i.e. after deliberating upon what is truth and untruth.
# The prime object of Arya Samaj is to do good to the whole world, i.e. to achieve physical, spiritual and social prosperity for all.
# Our conduct towards all should be guided by love, by injunctions of Dharma and according to their respective positions.
# One should dispel ignorance and promote knowledge.
# One should not be content with one&#x27;s own prosperity only but should consider the prosperity of all as his own prosperity.
# All human beings should abide by the rules concerning social or everyone&#x27;s benefit, while everyone should be free to follow any rule beneficial for him/her.

==Practices==
The Arya Samaj members consider the Gayatri Mantra, as the most holy mantra and chant it periodically, do the meditation known as &quot;Sandhya&quot; and make offering to the holy fire (&quot;havan&quot;). The havan can be performed with a priest for special occasions or without a priest for personal worship. The havan is performed as per the , usually, a simplified guide to havan, having mantras for general or special occasions. The priest is generally a Vedic scholar from the local Arya Samaj Mandir or Gurukul. Sometimes elder members of the family or neighbours can also perform the havan acting as a purohit. The host is known as the &quot;yajmana&quot;. The priest can be called an &quot;acharya&quot;, &quot;shastri&quot; or &quot;pandit&quot; depending upon his scholarly status and local reputation. It is customary to give a nominal &quot;dakshina&quot; to the priest after havan, although in Arya Samaj it is more symbolic and the priest does not state any sum. The sum is decided by the host&#x27;s capability and status but is still a small amount. After a death, Arya Samajis will often conduct a havan and collect the ashes on the fourth day.

===Diwali===
Diwali is a very important day in Arya Samaj as Swami Dayanand died on this day. A special havan is done for the same.
The Arya Samaj version of the Hindu festival Diwali is typified by the celebration in Suriname. The festival celebrates the victory of good over evil. A vegetarian fast is kept. The Gayatri Mantra is recited while oil lamps are lit, in front of a fire altar lit with sandalwood. One Diya lamp, which is larger has two wicks crossed to produce four lights, one in each direction and is lit first. The smaller lamp has one wick. A lamp is kept in every room except the bathroom and restroom. More lamps can be lit, which can be placed arbitrarily in the yard, living room and so on.

===Holi===
Holi is celebrated as the conclusion of winter and the start of spring to sow the land and hope for a good harvest. This day is marked by colours and songs (&quot;Chautal&quot;). It does not require specific prayer or fasting, however, some people keep a vegetarian fast on this day. The festivities do not associate Holi with a particular deity such as Vishnu or Shiva. The early Arya Samajist in 19th century Lahore adapted the festival to include prayers and havan but avoid the intoxication, and obscenities associated with traditional celebrations.

<text>Sir Cedric Webster Hardwicke (19 February 1893 – 6 August 1964) was an English stage and film actor whose career spanned over 50 years. His theatre work included notable performances in productions of the plays of Shakespeare and Shaw, and his film work included leading roles in several adapted literary classics.

==Early life==
Hardwicke was born in Lye, Worcestershire (now West Midlands) to Edwin Webster Hardwicke and his wife, Jessie (née Masterson). He initially attended Stourbridge Grammar School moving to Bridgnorth Grammar School in Shropshire in September 1907 until July 1911. He intended to train as a doctor but failed to pass the necessary examinations. He turned to the theatre and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).

===Military service===
Hardwicke enlisted at the outbreak of the First World War. He served with the London Scottish from 1914 to 1921 as an officer in the Judge Advocate&#x27;s branch of the British Army in France. He was one of the last members of the British Expeditionary Force to leave France. According to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; 1 January 1934, Hardwicke was one of the officers who escorted The Unknown Warrior from France, on HMS &quot;Verdun&quot;.

==Career==
===Stage===
Hardwicke made his first appearance on stage at the Lyceum Theatre, London in 1912 during the run of Frederick Melville&#x27;s melodrama &quot;The Monk and the Woman&quot;, when he took over the part of Brother John. During this year, he was at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre understudying, and subsequently appeared at the Garrick Theatre in Charles Klein&#x27;s play &quot;Find the Woman&quot;, and &quot;Trust the People&quot;. In 1913, he joined Benson&#x27;s Company and toured in the provinces, South Africa, and Rhodesia. During 1914 he toured with Miss Darragh (Letitia Marion Dallas, d. 1917) in Laurence Irving&#x27;s play &quot;The Unwritten Law&quot;, and he appeared at the Old Vic in 1914 as Malcolm in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, Tranio in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, the gravedigger in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and other roles.

After serving in the British Army in WWI, he resumed his acting career. In January 1922, he joined the Birmingham Repertory Company, playing a range of parts from the drooping young lover Faulkland in &quot;The Rivals&quot; to the roistering Sir Toby Belch in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

He played many classical roles on stage, appearing at London&#x27;s top theatres, making his name on the stage performing works by George Bernard Shaw, who said that Hardwicke was his fifth favourite actor after the four Marx Brothers. As one of the leading Shavian actors of his generation, Hardwicke starred in &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, &quot;The Apple Cart&quot;, &quot;Candida&quot;, &quot;Too True to Be Good&quot;, and &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot;, making such an impression that at the age of 41 he became the youngest actor to be knighted (this occurred in the 1934 New Year&#x27;s Honours; Laurence Olivier subsequently took the record in 1947 when he was knighted at the age of 40). Other stage successes included &quot;The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse&quot;, &quot;Antigone&quot; and &quot;A Majority of One&quot;, winning a Tony Award nomination for his performance as a Japanese diplomat.

In 1928, whilst appearing with Edith Day, Paul Robeson and Alberta Hunter in the London production of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, he married actress Helena Pickard.

In December 1935, Hardwicke was elected Rede Lecturer to Cambridge University for 1936, he took as his subject &quot;The Drama Tomorrow&quot;. In the late 1930s, he moved to the U.S., initially for film work. In the early 1940s, he continued his stage career on tours and in New York.

In 1944, Hardwicke returned to Britain, again touring, and reappeared on the London stage, at the Westminster Theatre, on 29 March 1945, as Richard Varwell in a revival of Eden and Adelaide Phillpotts&#x27; comedy &quot;Yellow Sands&quot;, and subsequently toured in this on the continent. He returned to America late in 1945 and appeared with Ethel Barrymore in December in a revival of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, and continued on the New York stage the following year. In 1946, he starred opposite Katharine Cornell as King Creon in her production of Jean Anouilh&#x27;s adaptation of the Greek tragedy &quot;Antigone&quot;.

In 1948, he joined the Old Vic Company at the New Theatre to play Sir Toby Belch, Doctor Faustus, and Gaev in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, but according to critic and biographer W.A. Darlington, &quot;it was about this time that he confessed to a friend that he was finding the competition in London too hot for him&quot;, and he moved permanently to the U.S. In 1951–52, he appeared on Broadway in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot; with Agnes Moorehead, Charles Boyer and Charles Laughton.

===Film and television work===
Hardwicke&#x27;s first appearance in a British film was in 1931, and from the late 1930s, he was in great demand in Hollywood. He played David Livingstone opposite Spencer Tracy&#x27;s Henry Morton Stanley in &quot;Stanley and Livingstone&quot; in 1939, and also played the evil Frollo in the remake of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; starring Charles Laughton the same year. In 1940, he played Mr. Jones in a screen version of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novel &quot;Victory&quot;. He starred as the unfortunate Ludwig von Frankenstein in &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein&quot; (1942) alongside Lon Chaney Jr. as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster and Bela Lugosi as Ygor.
Hardwicke played in films such as &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1935) with Fredric March and Charles Laughton, the first ever three-strip Technicolor film &quot;Becky Sharp&quot; (1935), &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1937), &quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot; (1944), &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; (1948), Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rope&quot; (1948) with James Stewart, and Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; (1955). He was featured as King Arthur in the comedy/musical &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; (1949), singing &quot;Busy Doing Nothing&quot; in a trio with Bing Crosby and William Bendix, and as the Pharaoh Sethi in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s 1956 film &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; starring Charlton Heston as Moses.

He appeared in a 1956 episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; titled &quot;Wet Saturday&quot; in which he portrayed Mr. Princey, an aristocratic gentleman who tries to cover up a murder to avoid public scandal. On 6 March 1958, he guest-starred on the TV series &quot;The Ford Show&quot; starring Tennessee Ernie Ford.

In 1961, he co-starred with Gertrude Berg in the Four Star Television situation comedy, &quot;Mrs. G. Goes to College&quot; (retitled &quot;The Gertrude Berg Show&quot; at mid-season). The series was cancelled after one season.

===Radio===
In 1945, Hardwicke played Sherlock Holmes in a BBC Radio dramatisation of &quot;The Speckled Band&quot;, opposite Finlay Currie as Dr. Watson. Years later, Hardwicke&#x27;s son Edward played Watson in the acclaimed Granada series.

Hardwicke played the titular role in a short-lived revival of the &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; radio program on the Mutual Broadcasting System, which ran 3 January 1954 to 28 March 1954.

==Personal life==
In 1928, he married the English actress Helena Pickard. They divorced in 1948; their son was actor Edward Hardwicke. His second marriage, which produced a son, Michael, and likewise ended in divorce, was to actress, Mary Scott (1921–2009), from 1950 to 1961.

A lifelong heavy smoker, he suffered from emphysema and died 6 August 1964 at the age of 71 in New York from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Hardwicke&#x27;s body was flown back to England; after a memorial service he was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in north London, where his ashes were scattered.

==Legacy==
Hardwicke left two volumes of memoirs: &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend: Recollections and Reflections of a Lucky Actor&quot;, 1932 and &quot;A Victorian in Orbit: The Irreverent Memoirs&quot; (as told to James Brough), 1961. He is commemorated by a sculpture by Tim Tolkien at Lye, commissioned by the Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council. The memorial takes the form of a giant filmstrip, the illuminated cut metal panels illustrating scenes from some of Hardwicke&#x27;s better-known roles, which include &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, &quot;Things to Come&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein&quot;. Unveiled in November 2005, it is located at Lye Cross where he lived as a child. Thorns School and Community College in neighbouring Quarry Bank has renamed its drama theatre in his honour as the Hardwicke Theatre.

Hardwicke has a motion pictures star and a television star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

<text>Trinitron was Sony&#x27;s brand name for its line of aperture-grille-based CRTs used in television sets and computer monitors. It was one of the first television systems to enter the market since the 1950s. Constant improvement in the basic technology and attention to overall quality allowed Sony to charge a premium for Trinitron devices into the 1990s.

Patent protection on the basic Trinitron design ran out in 1996, and it quickly faced a number of competitors at much lower prices.

The name Trinitron was derived from &quot;trinity&quot;, meaning the union of three, and &quot;tron&quot; from elec&quot;tron&quot; tube, after the way that the Trinitron combined the three separate electron guns of other CRT designs into one.

==History==

===Color television===

Color television had been demoed since the 1920s starting with John Logie Baird&#x27;s system. However, it was only in the late 1940s that it was perfected by both CBS and RCA. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or &quot;gel&quot;) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube. Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used. In spite of these problems, the United States Federal Communications Commission selected a sequential-frame 144 frame/s standard from CBS as their color broadcast in 1950.

RCA worked along different lines entirely, using the luminance-chrominance system. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure, the &quot;luminance&quot;. Luminance closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts, allowing it to be displayed on existing televisions. This was a major advantage over the mechanical systems being proposed by other groups. Color information was then separately encoded and folded into the signal as a high-frequency modification to produce a composite video signal – on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets the signal would be extracted, decoded back into RGB, and displayed.
Although RCA&#x27;s system had enormous benefits, it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes. Black and white TVs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even deposit of phosphor. With the compatible color encoding scheme originally developed by Georges Valensi in 1938, the color was changing continually along the line, which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow. Instead, the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots. Focusing the proper signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era, and RCA&#x27;s early experiments used three-tube projectors, or mirror-based systems known as &quot;Triniscope&quot;.

===Shadow masks===

RCA eventually solved the problem of displaying the color images with their introduction of the shadow mask. The shadow mask consists of a thin sheet of steel with tiny holes photo etched into it, placed just behind the front surface of the picture tube. Three guns, arranged in a triangle, were all aimed at the holes. Stray electrons at the edge of the beam were cut off by the mask, creating a sharply focused spot that was small enough to hit a single colored phosphor on the screen. Since each of the guns was aimed at the hole from a slightly different angle, the spots of phosphor on the tube could be separated slightly to prevent overlap.

The disadvantage of this approach was that for any given amount of gun power, the shadow mask filtered out the majority of the energy. To ensure there was no overlap of the beam on the screen, the dots had to be separated and covered perhaps 25% of its surface. This led to very dim images, requiring much greater electron beam power in order to provide a useful picture. Moreover, the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns, which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors. In spite of this, the technical superiority of the RCA system was overwhelming compared to the CBS system, and was selected as the new NTSC standard in 1953. The first broadcast using the new standard occurred on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1954, when NBC broadcast the Tournament of Roses Parade.

In spite of this early start, only a few years after regularly scheduled television broadcasting had begun, consumer uptake of color televisions was very slow to start. The dim images, constant adjustments and high costs had kept them in a niche of their own. Low consumer acceptance led to a lack of color programming, further reducing the demand for the sets in a supply and demand problem. In the United States in 1960, only 1 color set was sold for every 50 sets sold in total.

===Chromatron===

Sony had entered the television market in 1960 with the black and white TV8-301, the first non-projection type all-transistor television. A combination of factors, including its small screen size, limited its sales to niche markets. Sony engineers had been studying the color market, but the situation in Japan was even worse than the U.S.; they accounted for only 300 of the 9 million sets sold that year. But by 1961, dealers were asking the Sony sales department when a color set would be available, and the sales department put pressure on engineering in turn. Masaru Ibuka, Sony&#x27;s president and co-founder, steadfastly refused to develop a system based on RCA&#x27;s shadow mask design, which he considered technically deficient. He insisted on developing a unique solution.

In 1961, a Sony delegation was visiting the IEEE trade show in New York City, including Ibuka, Akio Morita (Sony&#x27;s other co-founder) and Nobutoshi Kihara, who was promoting his new CV-2000 home video tape recorder. This was Kihara&#x27;s first trip abroad and he spent much of his time wandering the trade floor, where he came across a small booth by the small company Autometric. They were demonstrating a new type of color television based on the Chromatron tube, which used a single electron gun and a vertical grille of electrically charged thin wires instead of a shadow mask. The resulting image was far brighter than anything the RCA design could produce, and lacked the convergence problems that required constant adjustments. He quickly brought Morita and Ibuka to see the design, and Morita was &quot;sold&quot; on the spot.

Morita arranged a deal with Paramount Pictures, who was paying for Chromatic Labs&#x27; development of the Chromatron, taking over the entire project. In early 1963, Senri Miyaoka was sent to Manhattan to arrange the transfer of the technology to Sony, which would lead to the closing of Chromatic Labs. He was unimpressed with the labs, describing the windowless basement as &quot;squalor&quot;. The American team was only too happy to point out the serious flaws in the Chromatron system, telling Miyaoka that the design was hopeless. By September 1964, a 17-inch prototype had been built in Japan, but mass-production test runs were demonstrating serious problems. Sony engineers were unable to make a version of Chromatron that could be reliably mass-produced.

When sets were finally made available in late 1964, they were put on the market at a competitive 198,000 yen (US$550), but cost the company over 400,000 yen (US$1111.11) to produce. Ibuka had bet the company on Chromatron and had already set up a new factory to produce them with the hopes that the production problems would be ironed out and the line would become profitable. After several thousand sets had shipped, the situation was no better, while Panasonic and Toshiba were in the process of introducing sets based on RCA licenses. By 1966, the Chromatron was breaking the company financially.

===Trinitron===

In the autumn of 1966, Ibuka finally gave in, and announced he would personally lead a search for a replacement for Chromatron. Susumu Yoshida was sent to the U.S. to look for potential licenses, and was impressed with the improvements that RCA had made in overall brightness by introducing new rare-earth phosphors on the screen. He also saw General Electric&#x27;s &quot;Porta-color&quot; design, using three guns in a row instead of a triangle, which allowed a greater portion of the screen to be lit. His report was cause for concern in Japan, where it seemed Sony was falling ever-farther behind the U.S. designs. They might be forced to license the shadow mask system if they wanted to remain competitive.

Ibuka was not willing to give up entirely, and had his 30 engineers explore a wide variety of approaches to see if they could come up with their own design. At one point, Yoshida asked Senri Miyaoka if the in-line gun arrangement used by GE could be replaced by a single gun with three cathodes; this would be more difficult to build, but be lower cost in the long run. Miyaoka built a prototype and was astonished by how well it worked, although it had focusing problems. Later that week, on Saturday, Miyaoka was summoned to Ibuka&#x27;s office while he was attempting to leave work to attend his weekly cello practice. Yoshida had just informed Ibuka about his success, and the two asked Miyaoka if they could really develop the gun into a workable product. Miyaoka, anxious to leave, answered yes, excused himself, and left. The following Monday, Ibuka announced that Sony would be developing a new color television tube, based on Miyaoka&#x27;s prototype. By February 1967, the focusing problems had been solved, and because there was a single gun, the focusing was achieved with permanent magnets instead of a coil, and required no manual adjustments after manufacturing.

During development, Sony engineer Akio Ohgoshi introduced another modification. GE&#x27;s system improved on the RCA shadow mask by replacing the small round holes with slightly larger rectangles. Since the guns were in-line, their electrons would land onto three rectangular patches instead of three smaller spots, about doubling the lit area. Ohgoshi proposed removing the mask entirely and replacing it with a series of vertical slots instead, lighting the entire screen. Although this would require the guns to be very carefully aligned with the phosphors on the tube in order to ensure they hit the right colors, with Miyaoka&#x27;s new tube, this appeared possible. In practice, this proved easy to build but difficult to place in the tube – the fine wires were mechanically weak and tended to move when the tubes were bumped, resulting in shifting colors on the screen. This problem was solved by running several fine tungsten wires across the grille horizontally to keep the vertical wires of the grille in place.

The combination of three-in-one electron gun and the replacement of the shadow mask with the aperture grille resulted in a unique and easily patentable product. In spite of Trinitron and Chromatron having no technology in common, the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar, or the same.

===Introduction, early models===
Officially introduced by Ibuka in April 1968, the original 12 inch Trinitron (KV-1210) had a display quality that easily surpassed any commercial set in terms of brightness, color fidelity, and simplicity of operation. The vertical wires in the aperture grille meant that the tube had to be nearly flat vertically; this gave it a unique cylindrical look. It was also all solid state, with the exception of the picture tube itself, which allowed it to be much more compact and cool running than designs like GE&#x27;s Porta-color. Some larger models such as the KV-1320UB for the United Kingdom market were initially fitted with 3AT2 valves for the extra high tension (high voltage) circuitry, before being redesigned as solid state in the early 70s.

Ibuka ended the press conference by claiming that 10,000 sets would be available by October, well beyond what engineering had told him was possible. Ibuka cajoled Yoshida to take over the effort of bringing the sets into production, and although Yoshida was furious at being put in charge of a task he felt was impossible, he finally accepted the assignment and successfully met the production goal. The KV-1210 was introduced in limited numbers in Japan in October as promised, and in the U.S. as the KV-1210U the following year.

Early color sets intended for the UK market had a PAL decoder that was different from those invented and licensed by Telefunken of Germany, who invented the PAL color system. The decoder inside the UK-sold Sony color Trinitron sets, from the KV-1300UB to the KV-1330UB, had an NTSC decoder adapted for PAL. The decoder used a 64 microsecond delay line to store every other line, but instead of using the delay line to average out the phase of the current line and the previous line, it simply repeated the same line twice. Any phase errors could then be compensated for by using a tint control knob on the front of the set, normally unneeded on a PAL set.
===Reception===

Reviews of the Trinitron were universally positive, although they all mentioned its high cost. Sony won an Emmy Award for the Trinitron in 1973. On his 84th birthday in 1992, Ibuka claimed the Trinitron was his proudest product.

New models quickly followed. Larger sizes at 19&quot; and then 27&quot; were introduced, as well as smaller, including a 7&quot; portable. In the mid-1980s, a new phosphor coating was introduced that was much darker than earlier sets, giving the screens a black color when turned off, as opposed to the earlier light grey. This improved the contrast range of the picture. Early models were generally packaged in silver cases, but with the introduction of the darker screens, Sony also introduced new cases with a dark charcoal color, following a similar change in color taking place in the hi-fi world. This line expanded with 32&quot;, 35&quot; and finally 40&quot; units in the 1990s. In 1990, Sony released the first HD Trinitron TV set, for use with the Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding standard.

In 1980, Sony introduced the &quot;ProFeel&quot; line of prosumer component televisions, consisting of a range of Trinitron monitors that could be connected to standardized tuners. The original lineup consisted of the KX-20xx1 20&quot; and KX-27xx1 27&quot; monitors (the &quot;xx&quot; is an identifier, PS for Europe, HF for Japan, etc.) the VTX-100ES tuner and TXT-100G TeleText decoder. They were often used with a set of SS-X1A stereo speakers, which matched the grey boxy styling of the suite. The concept was to build a market similar to contemporary stereo equipment, where components from different vendors could be mixed to produce a complete system. However, a lack of any major third party components, along with custom connectors between the tuner and monitors, meant that systems mixing fully compatible elements were never effectively realized. They were popular high-end units, however, and found a strong following in production companies where the excellent quality picture made them effective low-cost monitors. A second series of all-black units followed in 1986, the ProFeel Pro, sporting a space-frame around the back of the trapezoidal enclosure that doubled as a carrying handle and holder for the pop-out speakers. These units were paired with the VT-X5R tuner and optionally the APM-X5A speakers.

Sony also produced lines of Trinitron professional studio monitors, the PVM (Professional Video Monitor) and BVM (Broadcast Video Monitor) lines. These models were packaged in grey metal cubes with a variety of inputs that accepted practically any analog format. They originally used tubes similar to the ProFeel line, but over time, they gradually increased in resolution until the late 1990s when they offered over 900 lines. When these were cancelled as part of the wider Trinitron shutdown in 2007, professionals forced Sony to re-open two of the lines to produce the 20 and 14 inch models.

Among similar products, Sony produced the KV-1311 monitor/TV combination. It accepted NTSC-compatible video from various devices as well as analog broadcast TV. Along with its other functions, it had video and audio inputs and outputs as well as a wideband sound-IF decoded output. Its exterior looks much like the monitor illustrated here, with added TV controls.

By this time, Sony was well established as a supplier of reliable equipment; it was preferable to have minimal field failures instead of supporting an extensive service network for the entire United States.

Sony started developing the Trinitron for computer monitor use in the late 1970s. Demand was high, so high that there were examples of third party companies removing Trinitron tubes from televisions to use as monitors. In response, Sony started development of the GDM (Graphic Display Monitor) in 1983, which offered high resolution and faster refresh rates. Sony aggressively promoted the GDM and it became a standard on high-end monitors by the late 1980s. Particularly common models include the Apple Inc. 13&quot; model that was originally sold with the Macintosh II starting in 1987. Well known users also included Digital Equipment Corporation, IBM, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems and others. Demand for a lower cost solution led to the CDP series. In May 1988, the high-end 20 inch DDM model (Data Display Monitor) was introduced with a maximum resolution of 2,048 by 2,048, which went on to be used in the FAA&#x27;s Advanced Automation System air traffic control system.

These developments meant that Sony was well placed to introduce high-definition televisions (HDTV). In April 1981, they announced the High Definition Video System (HDVS), a suite of MUSE equipment including cameras, recorders, Trinitron monitors and projection TVs.

Sony shipped its 100 millionth Trinitron screen in July 1994, 25 years after it had been introduced. New uses in the computer field and the demand for higher resolution televisions to match the quality of DVD when it was introduced in 1996 led to increased sales, with another 180 million units delivered in the next decade.

===End of Trinitron===

Sony&#x27;s patent on the Trinitron display ran out in 1996, after 20 years. After the expiration of Sony&#x27;s Trinitron patent, manufacturers like Mitsubishi (whose monitor production is now part of NEC Display Solutions) were free to use the Trinitron design for their own product line without license from Sony although they could not use the Trinitron name. For example, Mitsubishi&#x27;s are called &quot;Diamondtron&quot;. To some degree, the name Trinitron became a generic term referring to any similar set.

Sony responded with the FD Trinitron, which used computer-controlled feedback systems to ensure sharp focus across a flat screen. Initially introduced on their 27, 32 and 36 inch models in 1998, the new tubes were offered in a variety of resolutions for different uses. The basic WEGA models supported normal 480i signals, but a larger version offered 16:9 aspect ratios. The technology was quickly applied to the entire Trinitron range, from 13 to 36 inch. High resolution versions, Hi-Scan and Super Fine Pitch, were also produced. With the introduction of the FD Trinitron, Sony also introduced a new industrial style, leaving the charcoal colored sets introduced in the 1980s for a new silver styling.

Sony was not the only company producing flat screen CRTs. Other companies had already introduced high-end brands with flat-screen tubes, like Panasonic&#x27;s Tau. Many other companies entered the market quickly, widely copying the new silver styling as well. The FD Trinitron was unable to regain the cachet that the Trinitron brand had previously possessed; in the 2004 Christmas season, they increased sales by 5%, but only at the cost of a 75% plunge in profits after being forced to lower costs to compete in the market.

At the same time, the introduction of plasma televisions, and then LCD-based ones, led to the high-end market being increasingly focused on the &quot;thin&quot; sets. Both of these technologies have well known problems, and for some time Sony explored a wide array of technologies that would improve upon them in the same way the Trinitron did on the shadow mask. Among these experiments were organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) and the field-emission display, but in spite of considerable effort, neither of these technologies matured into competitors at the time. Sony also introduced their Plasmatron displays, and later LCD as well, but these had no inherent technical advantages over similar sets from other companies. From 2006, all of Sony&#x27;s BRAVIA television products are LCD displays, initially based on screens from Samsung, and later Sharp.

Sony eventually ended production of the Trinitron in Japan in 2004. In 2006, Sony announced that it would no longer market or sell Trinitrons in the United States or Canada, but it would continue to sell the Trinitron in China, India, and regions of South America using tubes delivered from their Singapore plant. Production in Singapore finally ended by the end of March 2008, only months after ending production of their rear-projection systems. Two lines of the factory were later brought back online to supply the professional market.

280 million Trinitron tubes were built. At its peak, 20 million were made annually.

==Description==
===Basic concept===
The Trinitron design incorporates two unique features: the single-gun three-cathode picture tube, and the vertically aligned aperture grille.

The single gun consists of a long-necked tube with a single electrode at its base, flaring out into a horizontally-aligned rectangular shape with three rectangular cathodes inside. Each cathode is fed the amplified signal from one of the decoded RGB signals.

The electrons from the cathodes are all aimed toward a single point at the back of the screen where they hit the aperture grille, a steel sheet with vertical slots cut in it. Due to the slight separation of the cathodes at the back of the tube, the three beams approach the grille at slightly different angles. When they pass through the grille they retain this angle, hitting their individual colored phosphors that are deposited in vertical stripes on the inside of the faceplate. The main purpose of the grille is to ensure that each beam strikes only the phosphor stripes for its color, much as does a shadow mask. However, unlike a shadow mask, there are essentially no obstructions along each entire phosphor stripe. Larger CRTs have a few horizontal stabilizing wires part way between top and bottom.

===Advantages===
In comparison to early shadow mask designs, the Trinitron grille cuts off much less of the signal coming from the electron guns. RCA tubes built in the 1950s cut off about 85% of the electron beam, while the grille cuts off about 25%. Improvements to the shadow mask designs continually narrowed this difference between the two designs, and by the late 1980s the difference in performance, at least theoretically, was eliminated.

Another advantage of the aperture grille was that the distance between the wires remained constant vertically across the screen. In the shadow mask design, the size of the holes in the mask is defined by the required resolution of the phosphor dots on the screen, which was constant. However, the distance from the guns to the holes changed; for dots near the center of the screen, the distance was its shortest, at points in the corners it was at its maximum. To ensure that the guns were focused on the holes, a system known as dynamic convergence had to constantly adjust the focus point as the beam moved across the screen. In the Trinitron design, the problem was greatly simplified, requiring changes only for large screen sizes, and only on a line-by-line basis.

For this reason, Trinitron systems are easier to focus than shadow masks, and generally had a sharper image. This was a major selling point of the Trinitron design for much of its history. In the 1990s, new computer-controlled real-time feedback focusing systems eliminated this advantage, as well as leading to the introduction of &quot;true flat&quot; designs.

===Disadvantages===
====Visible support or damping wires====
Even small changes in the alignment of the grille over the phosphors can cause the color purity to shift. Since the wires are thin, small bumps can cause the wires to shift alignment if they are not held in place. Monitors using Trinitron technology have one or more thin tungsten wires running horizontally across the grille to prevent this. Screens 15&quot; and below have one wire located about two thirds of the way down the screen, while monitors greater than 15&quot; have 2 wires at the one-third and two-thirds positions. These wires are less apparent or completely obscured on standard definition sets due to wider scan lines to match the lower resolution of the video being displayed. On computer monitors, where the scan lines are much closer together, the wires are often visible. This is a minor drawback of the Trinitron standard which is not shared by shadow mask CRTs. Aperture grilles are not as mechanically stable as shadow or slot masks; a tap can cause the image to briefly become distorted, even with damping/support wires. Some people may find the wires to be distracting.

====Anti-glare coating====
A polyurethane sheet coated to scatter reflections is affixed to the front of the screen, where it can be damaged.

<doc id="173451" wikidata="Q2075956" url="?curid=173451" title="Culture of Wales">
<text>The culture of Wales encompasses the Welsh language, customs, festivals, music, art, cuisine, mythology, history, and politics. Wales is primarily represented by the symbol of the red Welsh Dragon, but other national emblems include the leek and the daffodil.

Although sharing many customs with the other nations of the United Kingdom, Wales has its own distinct traditions and culture, and from the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the &quot;land of song&quot;, in part due to the eisteddfod tradition.

==Development of Welsh culture==

===Historical influences===

Wales has been identified as having been inhabited by humans for some 230,000 years, as evidenced by the discovery of a Neanderthal at the Bontnewydd Palaeolithic site in north Wales. After the Roman era of occupation, a number of small kingdoms arose in what is now Wales. These early kingdoms were influenced by Ireland; however, details prior to the 8th century AD are unclear. Kingdoms during that era included Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth.
While Rhodri the Great in the 9th century was the first ruler to dominate a large portion of Wales, it was not until 1055 that Gruffydd ap Llywelyn united the individual Welsh kingdoms and began to annex parts of England. Gruffydd was killed, possibly in crossfire by his own men, on 5 August 1063 while Harold Godwinson sought to engage him in battle. This was just over three years before the Norman invasion of England, which led to a drastic change of fortune for Wales. By 1070, the Normans had already seen successes in their invasion of Wales, with Gwent fallen and Deheubarth plundered. The invasion was seemingly complete by 1093. However, the Welsh kingdoms were re-established and most of the land retaken from the Normans over the following decades. 

While Gwynedd grew in strength, Powys was broken up after the death of Llywelyn ap Madog in the 1160s and was never reunited. Llywelyn the Great rose in Gwynedd and had reunited the majority of Wales by his death in 1240. After his death, King Henry III of England intervened to prevent Dafydd ap Llywelyn from inheriting his father&#x27;s lands outside Gwynedd, leading to war. The claims of his successor, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, conflicted with those of King Edward I of England; this resulted in the conquest of Wales by English forces.

The Tudors of Penmynydd grew in power and influence during the 13th to 15th centuries, first owning land in north Wales, but losing it after Maredudd ap Tudur backed the uprising of Owain Glyndŵr in 1400. Maredudd&#x27;s son, Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur, anglicised his name to become Owen Tudor, and was the grandfather of Henry Tudor. Henry took the throne of England in 1485, at the end of the Wars of the Roses, when his forces defeated those of Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field.

Under Henry VIII, the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542 were passed. The distinction between the Principality of Wales and the Marches of Wales was ended. The law of England became the only law of Wales which was then administered by justices of the peace that were appointed in every Welsh county. Wales was then represented in parliament by 26 members.

English became the only official language of courts in Wales, and people that used the Welsh language would not be eligible for public office in the territories of the king of England. Welsh was limited to the working and lower middle classes, which played a central role in the public attitude to the language.

The House of Tudor continued to reign through several successive monarchs until 1603, when James I (James VI of Scotland) took the throne for the House of Stuart; his great-grandmother was Margaret Tudor.

===Identity and nationalism===
Welsh nationalism () emphasises the distinctiveness of Welsh language, culture, and history, and calls for more self-determination for Wales, which might include more devolved powers for the Senedd or full independence from the United Kingdom. While a sense of nationhood has existed within Wales for over 1500 years, the idea that Wales should be a modern self-determining state has only been mooted since the mid-18th century.

In 1406 Owain Glyndŵr set out a vision of Welsh independence in his Pennal letter, sent to Charles VI King of France. The letter requested maintained military support from the French to fend off the English in Wales. Glyndŵr suggested that in return, he would recognise Benedict XIII of Avignon as the Pope. The letter sets out the ambitions of Glyndŵr of an independent Wales with its own parliament, led by himself as Prince of Wales. These ambitions also included the return of the traditional law of Hywel Dda, rather than the enforced English law, establishment of an independent Welsh church as well as two universities, one in south Wales, and one in north Wales.

==Symbols==

National symbols of Wales include the dragon, the daffodil and the leek. A story of soldiers wearing the leek during battle to make it easier to identify them is recounted in the 17th century, attributed to Saint David. The earliest certain reference of the leek as a Welsh emblem was when Princess Mary, daughter of Henry VIII, was presented with a leek by the yeoman of the guard on Saint David&#x27;s Day in 1537. The colours of the leek were used for the uniforms of soldiers under Edward I of England.

The Red Dragon standard was most likely introduced to the British Isles by Roman troops who in turn had acquired it from the Dacians. It may also have been a reference to the 6th century Welsh word &quot;draig&quot;, which meant &quot;dragon&quot;. The standard was appropriated by the Normans during the 11th century, and used for the Royal Standard of Scotland. Richard I of England took a red dragon standard with him on the Third Crusade.

Both symbols were popular with Tudor kings, with Henry VII of England (Henry Tudor) adding the white and green background to the red dragon standard. It was largely forgotten by the House of Stuart, who favoured a unicorn instead. By the 17th and 18th centuries, it became common practice in Great Britain for the gentry to wear leeks on St. David&#x27;s Day. In 1807, a &quot;a red dragon passant standing on a mound&quot; was made the King&#x27;s badge for Wales. Following an increase in nationalism in 1953, it was proposed to add the motto &quot;Y ddraig goch ddyry cychwyn&quot; (&quot;the red dragon takes the lead&quot;) to the flag. This was poorly received, and six years later Queen Elizabeth II intervened to put the current flag in place. It has been proposed that the flag of the United Kingdom be redesigned to include a symbol representing Wales, as it is the only nation in the United Kingdom not represented in the flag.

The daffodil is a more recent development, becoming popular during the 19th century. It may have been linked to the leek; the Welsh for daffodil (&quot;cenhinen Bedr&quot;) translates as &quot;St Peter&#x27;s leek&quot;. During the 20th century, the daffodil rose to rival the prominence of the leek as a symbol of Wales. Prime Minister David Lloyd George ensured that the daffodil had a place in the investiture of Edward, Prince of Wales.

The traditional Welsh costume and Welsh hat were well known during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Princess Alexandrina Victoria (later Queen Victoria) had a hat made for her when she visited Wales in 1832. The hat was popularised by Sydney Curnow Vosper&#x27;s 1908 painting &quot;Salem&quot;, but by then its use had declined.

Welsh people may sometimes engage in gentle self-mockery and claim the sheep as a national emblem, due to the 3 million people in the country being vastly outnumbered by some 10 million sheep and the nation&#x27;s reliance on sheep farming. The importance of sheep farming led to the creation of the Welsh sheepdog.

Welsh lovespoons are traditionally crafted wooden spoons which a suitor would give to his beloved. The more intricacies of the design served a dual purpose, as it demonstrated the depth of their feelings to the beloved, and their crafting abilities (and therefore potential to generate income to look after the family) to their potential suitor&#x27;s family. The earliest known dated lovespoon from Wales, displayed in the St Fagans National History Museum near Cardiff. It is believed to have been crafted in 1667, although the tradition is believed to date back long before that.

==Language==
The two main languages of Wales are Welsh and English. Throughout the centuries, the Welsh language has been a central factor in the concept of Wales as a nation. Figures released by the Office of National Statistics taken from the 2011 census, show that Welsh is spoken by 19% of the population.

==Religion==

Before the Roman occupation, the dominant religion in Wales was a pagan one, led by the druids. Little is known about the traditions and ceremonies, but Tacitus, whose claims were sometimes exaggerated, stated that they performed human sacrifice: he says that in AD 61, an altar on Anglesey was found to be &quot;drenched with the blood of their prisoners&quot;. Christianity was introduced to Wales through the Romans, and after they abandoned the British Isles, it survived in South East Wales at Hentland. In the 6th century, this was home to Dubricius, the first Celtic saint.

The largest religion in modern Wales is Christianity, with almost 58% of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. The Presbyterian Church of Wales was for many years the largest denomination; it was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811; The Church in Wales had an average Sunday attendance of 32,171 in 2012. It forms part of the Anglican Communion, and was also part of the Church of England, but was disestablished by the British Government in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914. Non-Christian religions have relatively few followers in Wales, with Muslims making up 1.5% of the population while Hindus and Buddhists represent 0.3% each in the 2011 census. Over 32% of the population in Wales did not note a religion. Research in 2007 by the Tearfund organisation showed that Wales had the lowest average church attendance in the UK, with 12% of the population routinely attending.

==Festival days==

The patron saint of Wales is Saint David, &quot;Dewi Sant&quot; in Welsh. St. David&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 1 March, which some people argue should be designated a public holiday in Wales. Other days which have been proposed for national public commemorations are 16 September (the day on which Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s rebellion began) and 11 December (the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd).

The traditional seasonal festivals in Wales are:
* Calan Gaeaf (a Hallowe&#x27;en or Samhain-type festival on the first day of winter)
* Gŵyl Fair y Canhwyllau (literally Mary&#x27;s Festival of the Candles, i.e. Candlemas; also coinciding with Imbolc)
* Calan Mai (May Day, and similar to Beltane)
* Calan Awst (1 August, equivalent to Lammas and Lughnasa)
* Gŵyl Mabsant celebrated by each parish in commemoration of its native saint, often marked by a fair
* Dydd Santes Dwynwen, a Welsh equivalent to St Valentine&#x27;s Day
* Calennig is a Welsh New Year celebration

==Arts==

===Visual arts===

Many works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales participated in the Insular art of the British Isles and a number of illuminated manuscripts possibly of Welsh origin survive, of which the 8th century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels are the most notable. The 11th century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin) is certainly Welsh, made in St David&#x27;s, and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence.

The best of the few Welsh artists of the 16th–18th centuries tended to move elsewhere to work, but in the 18th century the dominance of landscape art in English art motivated them to stay at home, and brought an influx of artists from outside to paint Welsh scenery. The Welsh painter Richard Wilson (1714–1782) is arguably the first major British landscapist, but rather more notable for Italian scenes than Welsh ones, although he did paint several on visits from London.

It remained difficult for artists relying on the Welsh market to support themselves until well into the 20th century. An Act of Parliament in 1854 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom, and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists, and its artists&#x27; colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made many works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams, whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists, based respectively in the United States and France. Sir Frank Brangwyn was Welsh by origin, but spent little time in Wales.

Perhaps the most famous Welsh painters, Augustus John and his sister Gwen John, mostly lived in London and Paris; however the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast remained living in Wales for most of their lives, though well in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff, and even after moving to London; he was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism. Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill, the London-born Welshman David Jones, and the sculptor Jonah Jones. The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes.

===Ceramics===
Amgueddfa Cymru houses Welsh pottery made in Swansea and Llanelli between 1764 and 1922, in addition to porcelain made at Swansea and Nantgarw between 1813 and 1826. Several further sites can be identified through their place names, for example Pwllcrochan (a hamlet near Milford Haven estuary in Pembrokeshire), which translates to Crock Pool, and archaeology has also revealed former kiln sites across the country. These were often located near clay beds, for ease of resource gathering. Buckley and Ewenny became leading areas of pottery production in Wales during the 17th and 18th centuries; these are applied as generic terms to different potters within those areas during this period. South Wales had several notable potteries during that same period, an early exponent being the Cambrian Pottery (1764–1870, also known as &quot;Swansea pottery&quot;). The works from Cambrian attempted to imitate those of Wedgwood. Nantgarw Pottery, near Cardiff, was in operation from 1813 to 1823 making fine porcelain. Llanelly Pottery was the last surviving major pottery works in South Wales when it closed in 1922.

===Literature===
===Theatre===
Theatrical performances are thought to have begun after the Roman invasion of Britain. There are remains of a Roman amphitheatre at Caerleon, which would have served the nearby fortress of Isca Augusta. Between Roman and modern times, theatre in Wales was limited to performances of travelling players, sometimes in temporary structures. Welsh theatrical groups also performed in England, as did English groups in Wales. The rise of the Puritans in the 17th century and then Methodism during the 18th century caused declines in Welsh theatre as performances were seen as immoral.

Despite this, performances continued on showgrounds, and with a handful of travelling groups of actors. The Savoy Theatre, Monmouth, the oldest theatre still in operation in Wales, was built during the 19th century and originally operated as the Assembly Rooms. Other theatres opened over the following decades, with Cardiff&#x27;s Theatre Royal opening in 1827. After a fire, a replacement Theatre Royal opened in 1878. Competition for theatres led to further buildings being constructed, such as the New Theatre, Cardiff, which opened on 10 December 1906.

===Television===
Television in the United Kingdom started in 1936 as a public service which was free of advertising, but did not arrive in Wales until the opening of the Wenvoe transmitter in August 1952. Initially all programmes were in the English language, although under the leadership of Welsh director and controller Alun Oldfield-Davies, occasional Welsh language programmes were broadcast during closed periods, replacing the test card. In 1958, responsibility for programming in Wales fell to Television Wales and the West, although Welsh language broadcasting was mainly served by the Manchester-based Granada company, producing about an hour a week. On 1 November 1982, S4C (Sianel Pedwar Cymru) was launched bringing together the BBC, HTV and other independent producers to provide an initial service of 22 hours of Welsh-language television. The digital switchover in Wales of 2009-2010 meant that the previously bilingual Channel 4 split into S4C, broadcasting exclusively in Welsh and Channel 4 broadcasting exclusively in English.

The decision by Julie Gardner, Head of Drama for BBC Wales, to film and produce the 2005 revived version of Doctor Who in Wales is widely seen as a bellwether moment for the industry for the nation. This in turn was followed by the opening of the Roath Lock production studios in Cardiff. Recent English language programmes that have been filmed in Wales include Sherlock and His Dark Materials, while other popular series, such as Hinterland (&quot;Y Gwyll&quot;) and Keeping Faith (&quot;Un Bore Mercher&quot;) have been filmed in both Welsh and English.

===Film===

The Cinema of Wales comprises the art of film and creative movies made in Wales or by Welsh filmmakers either locally or abroad. Welsh cinema began in the late-19th century, led by Welsh-based director William Haggar. Wales continued to produce film of varying quality throughout the 20th century, in both the Welsh and English languages, though indigenous production was curtailed through a lack of infrastructure and finance, which prevented the growth of the industry nationally. Despite this, Wales has been represented in all fields of the film making process, producing actors and directors of note.

===Music===

Wales is often referred to as &quot;the land of song&quot;, and is notable for its harpists, male choirs, and solo artists. The principal Welsh festival of music and poetry is the annual &quot;National Eisteddfod&quot;. The &quot;Llangollen International Eisteddfod&quot; echoes the National Eisteddfod but provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. Traditional music and dance in Wales is supported by many societies. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes.

Male choirs (sometimes called male voice choirs), which emerged in the 19th century, have remained a lasting tradition in Wales. Originally these choirs were formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. Many of the historic Welsh choirs survive, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs. Traditional instruments of Wales include &quot;telyn deires&quot; (triple harp), fiddle, crwth, &quot;pibgorn&quot; (hornpipe) and other instruments. The Cerdd Dant Society promotes its specific singing art primarily through an annual one-day festival. The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay, while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world.

Wales has had a number of successful singers. In the 1960s, these included bands such as Amen Corner and The Iveys/Badfinger and singers including Sir Tom Jones, Dame Shirley Bassey and Mary Hopkin. By the 1980s, indie pop and alternative rock bands such as The Alarm, The Pooh Sticks and The Darling Buds were popular in their genres. But the wider view at the time was that the wider Welsh music scene was stagnant, as the more popular musicians from Wales were from earlier eras.

In the 1990s, in England, the Britpop scene was emerging, while in Wales, bands such as Y Cyrff and Ffa Coffi Pawb began to sing in English, starting a culture that would lead to the creation of Catatonia and the Super Furry Animals. The influence of the 80s bands and the emergence of a Welsh language and dual language music scene locally in Wales led to a dramatic shift in opinion across the United Kingdom as the &quot;Cool Cymru&quot; bands of the period emerged. The leading Welsh band during this period was the Manic Street Preachers, whose 1996 album &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; has been listed among the greatest albums of all time.

Some of those bands have had ongoing success, while the general popularity of Welsh music during this period led to a resurgence of singers such as Tom Jones with his album &quot;Reload&quot;. It was his first non-compilation number one album since 1968&#x27;s &quot;Delilah&quot;. Meanwhile, Shirley Bassey reached the top 20 once more in the UK Charts with her collaboration with the Propellerheads on the single &quot;History Repeating&quot;. They also introduced new acts, such as Catatonia&#x27;s Owen Powell working with Duffy during her early period. Moving into the 21st century, Bullet For My Valentine were named the Best British Band at the Kerrang! Awards for three years running. Other successful bands from this period include Funeral For A Friend, and Lostprophets.

==Media==

Television is the most common source of news in Wales, used by 75% of people, with radio used by 43%, 33% using printed newspapers and 31% using websites and apps. In 2020, 46% of people gained their news from social media, which is largely unregulated but includes some news from regulated sources.

==Sport==

Over fifty national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup, the Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. At the Olympic Games, Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team.

Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. The Welsh national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup, with Wales hosting the 1999 tournament. The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were in turn replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Scarlets; Cardiff Blues; Newport Gwent Dragons; and the Ospreys. The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14 league, the Anglo-Welsh Cup (LV Cup), the European Heineken Cup and the European (Amlin) Challenge Cup.

Wales has had its own association football league since 1992. For historical and other reasons, four Welsh clubs (Cardiff City, Swansea City, Wrexham, and Newport County) play in the English Football League. Another Welsh club plays in English football&#x27;s feeder leagues: Merthyr Town. This also qualifies those teams to compete for England&#x27;s domestic trophies. On 23 April 1927, Cardiff City became the only team outside England to win the FA Cup. In European football competitions, only teams playing in the Welsh leagues are eligible to play for Wales. The five teams in the English leagues are eligible to represent England only, and they are not allowed to compete for domestic Welsh trophies.

In international cricket, Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team, or simply &quot;England&quot;. Occasionally, a separate Wales national cricket team plays in limited-overs competitions, mainly against English county teams. Glamorgan is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. Plaid Cymru have argued that Wales should have its own international team and withdraw from the existing arrangement under which Welsh players play for England. The proposal has aroused opposition from Cricket Wales and Glamorgan County Cricket Club, who argue such a move would be financially disastrous. The debate focused on a report produced by the Welsh National Assembly&#x27;s petitions committee, which reflected the arguments on both sides. Bethan Jenkins, Plaid Cymru&#x27;s spokesperson on heritage, culture, sport and broadcasting, and a member of the petitions committee, said: &quot;Cricket Wales and Glamorgan CCC say the idea of a Welsh national cricket team is &#x27;an emotive subject&#x27;. Of course having a national team is emotive. You only have to look at the stands during any national game to see that. To suggest this as anything other than natural is a bit of a misleading argument.&quot;
In their strategic plan, Cricket Wales state they are &quot;committed to continuing to play a major role within the ECB&quot;

Wales has produced several world-class participants in individual sports, including snooker players Ray Reardon, Terry Griffiths, Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens. Successful track athletes include miler Jim Alford who was a world record holder in the 4 x 1500 metres relay, the 110-metre hurdler Colin Jackson who is a former world record holder and the winner of numerous Olympic, World and European medals, and Tanni Grey-Thompson who has won 11 Paralympic gold medals. Wales has also produced a number of world-class boxers. Joe Calzaghe was WBO World Super-Middleweight Champion and then won the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine super-middleweight and Ring Magazine Light-Heavyweight titles. Other former boxing world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli, Freddie Welsh, Howard Winstone, Percy Jones, Jimmy Wilde, Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan.

==Cuisine==
Welsh cuisine is internationally renowned; Welsh lamb, Welsh cakes, and dishes such as bara brith remain exports synonymous with quality and flavour. Some say that some other Welsh dishes are said to be similar to English cuisine in style. However, there are regional variations in the food seen across Wales, which can be traced historically to the availability of certain crops and produce in specific areas of the country. The cuisine of Gower is particularly different to the rest of Wales. It was strongly influenced by Somerset and Devon, and developed dishes such as whitepot while ingredients such as pumpkin were used, which are unusual in the rest of Wales.

Cattle farming produces the majority of Wales&#x27; agricultural output. Welsh beef is protected under European Union law, meaning that it must be produced and slaughtered in Wales. Welsh pigs are raised, providing good cuts of meat. The mountainous areas of Wales are suited to sheep farming and this has led to an association of their meat with the country. The mutton of Wales has been popular in the rest of the United Kingdom since the 16th century, and by the end of the 20th century there were more than 11 million sheep in Wales.

Several Welsh dishes are thought of as Welsh because their ingredients are associated with Wales, whereas others have been developed there. Cawl is regarded as the Welsh national dish; it is a slow-cooked meat and vegetable broth. Traditionally it was a vegetable-heavy dish, but now it is more likely to contain beef or lamb. Welsh rarebit is thought to date from the 18th century, although the original term &quot;Welsh rabbit&quot; may have been intended as a slur against the Welsh. Another use of cheese in a traditional Welsh dish is seen in Glamorgan sausage, which is a skinless sausage made of cheese and either leek or spring onion, which is then rolled into a sausage shape before frying. Laverbread is made using a purée of seaweed, and is traditionally served in a Welsh breakfast. Welsh cakes are made on a bakestone, and are small round spiced cakes containing raisins, sultanas and occasionally currants. Bara brith contains similar ingredients to Welsh cakes, but is similar to a tea bread.
The Welsh have their own versions of pancakes: crempogau (sing. &quot;crempog&quot;) (sometimes called &quot;ffroes&quot;, sing. &quot;ffroesen&quot;) are traditionally layered on top of each other to form a large cake. Some are very much like American pancakes; others may be made with yeast (called &quot;crempogau burum&quot;, sing. &quot;crempog furum&quot;) or oatmeal (although this is also true of American pancakes) and some are like Scotch pancakes.

Beer is the national drink of Wales, despite the influence of the link to temperance movement in Wales. The Wrexham Lager Beer Company was the first successful lager producer in Britain when it opened in 1882, and the Felinfoel Brewery was the first brewery in Europe to put beer in cans. Whisky production in Wales was historically a niche industry, and completely shut down in 1910 when the last distillery was bought out by a Scottish firm. However, the Penderyn distillery produced the first Wales-created whisky in a century to go on sale when it was launched in 2004. There are 20 Welsh vineyards producing 100,000 bottles of wine a year in total.

<text>Egon Zakrajšek (July 7, 1941 – September 2002) was a Slovene mathematician and computer scientist.

Zakrajšek was born in Ljubljana, SFR Yugoslavia (today Slovenia). He became an orphan even before he started school. He went to elementary school and gymnasium in Jesenice. He was a good student and he soon showed his talents and abilities. He graduated from technical mathematics at the Department of mathematics and physics of the then Faculty for natural sciences and technology (FNT) of the University of Ljubljana. He received his Master&#x27;s degree from the University of Zagreb for his work &quot;Numerična realizacija Ritzovega procesa&quot; (&quot;Numerical realization of the Ritz process&quot;) and his doctorate in 1978 in Ljubljana with his dissertation &quot;O invariantni vložitvi pri reševanju diferencialnih enačb&quot; (&quot;About the invariable embedding in solving of differential equations&quot;).

Professor Zakrajšek was one of the pioneers of computer science in Slovenia. He became an expert on the first computers of the University of Ljubljana, the Zuse Z-23 and its successor the IBM 1130. He later participated in the development of programming languages, tools and operating systems. At the same time he wrote textbooks and manuals for them: for Z-23 assembly, Algol, Fortran, Algol 68, Pascal, for domestic structran. In 1982 he set off for the United States and he became the manager of programming equipment at the Cromemco company. In 1994 he returned to homeland, where he was again a professor. With his advocacy for the C language and open operating systems, that is, Unix and Linux, he helped to modernize the lessons of computer science. He additionally became an expert for TeX, LaTeX and MATLAB.

Beside his computer science skills he was also an excellent mathematician with a broad profile. He taught and solved problems from many fields: the usage of mathematics in natural and social sciences, statistics, mechanics, classical applied mathematics, discrete mathematics, graph and network theory, linear programming, operational researches, numerical analysis.

<text>9 (nine) is the natural number following and preceding .

==Evolution of the Hindu–Arabic digit==

Circa 300 BC, as part of the Brahmi numerals, various Indians wrote a digit 9 similar in shape to the modern closing question mark without the bottom dot. The Kshatrapa, Andhra and Gupta started curving the bottom vertical line coming up with a -look-alike. How the numbers got to their Gupta form is open to considerable debate. The Nagari continued the bottom stroke to make a circle and enclose the 3-look-alike, in much the same way that the sign @ encircles a lowercase &quot;a&quot;. As time went on, the enclosing circle became bigger and its line continued beyond the circle downwards, as the 3-look-alike became smaller. Soon, all that was left of the 3-look-alike was a squiggle. The Arabs simply connected that squiggle to the downward stroke at the middle and subsequent European change was purely cosmetic.

While the shape of the glyph for the digit 9 has an ascender in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures the character usually has a descender, as, for example, in .

The form of the number nine (9) could possibly derived from the Arabic letter &quot;waw&quot;, in which its isolated form (و) resembles the number 9.
The modern digit resembles an inverted &quot;6&quot;. To disambiguate the two on objects and labels that can be inverted, they are often underlined. It is sometimes handwritten with two strokes and a straight stem, resembling a raised lower-case letter q, which distinguishes it from the 6. Similarly, in seven-segment display, the number 9 can be constructed either with a hook at the end of its stem or without one. Most LCD calculators use the former, but some VFD models use the latter.

== Mathematics ==

9 is the fourth composite number, and the first odd composite number. 9 is also a refactorable number. 

Casting out nines is a quick way of testing the calculations of sums, differences, products, and quotients of integers in decimal, a method known as long ago as the 12th century.

9 is the only square number that is the sum of two consecutive, positive cubes: formula_1

If an odd perfect number exists, it will have at least nine distinct prime factors.

9 is the sum of the cubes of the first two non-zero positive integers formula_2 which makes it the first cube-sum number greater than one. A number that is 4 or 5 modulo 9 cannot be represented as the sum of three cubes.

There are nine Heegner numbers, or square-free positive integers formula_3 that yield an imaginary quadratic field formula_4 whose ring of integers has a unique factorization, or class number of 1. 

=== Geometry ===

A polygon with nine sides is called a nonagon. A regular nonagon can be constructed with a regular compass, straightedge, and angle trisector.

The lowest number of squares needed for a perfect tiling of a rectangle is 9.

9 is the largest single-digit number in the decimal system.

=== List of basic calculations ===


==Culture and mythology==
===Indian culture===
Nine is a number that appears often in Indian culture and mythology. For example, there are nine influencers attested to in Indian astrology. In the Vaisheshika branch of Hindu philosophy, there are nine universal substances or elements: Earth, Water, Air, Fire, Ether, Time, Space, Soul, and Mind. And Navaratri is a nine-day festival dedicated to the nine forms of Durga.

===Chinese culture===
* Nine (; ) is considered a good number in Chinese culture because it sounds the same as the word &quot;long-lasting&quot; (; ).
* Nine is strongly associated with the Chinese dragon, a symbol of magic and power. There are nine forms of the dragon, it is described in terms of nine attributes, and it has nine children. It has 117 scales – 81 yang (masculine, heavenly) and 36 yin (feminine, earthly). All three numbers are multiples of 9 (, , ).

==Anthropology==
===Idioms===
* &quot;To go the whole nine yards&quot;
* &quot;A cat has nine lives&quot;
* &quot;To be on cloud nine&quot;
* The word &quot;K-9&quot; pronounces the same as &quot;canine&quot; and is used in many US police departments to denote the police dog unit. Despite not sounding like the translation of the word &quot;canine&quot; in other languages, many police and military units around the world use the same designation.
* Someone dressed &quot;to the nines&quot; is dressed up as much as they can be.
* In North American urban culture, &quot;nine&quot; is a slang word for a 9mm pistol or homicide, the latter from the Illinois Criminal Code for homicide.
==Religion and philosophy==
* Nine, as the largest single-digit number (in base ten), symbolizes completeness in the Baháʼí Faith. In addition, the word Baháʼ in the Abjad notation has a value of 9, and a 9-pointed star is used to symbolize the religion.
* The number 9 is revered in Hinduism and considered a complete, perfected and divine number because it represents the end of a cycle in the decimal system, which originated from the Indian subcontinent as early as 3000 BC.
* In Norse mythology, the number nine is associated with Odin, as that is how many days he hung from the world tree Yggdrasil before attaining knowledge of the runes.
* Nine is the number associated with Satan in LaVeyan Satanism. Anton LaVey wrote in The Satanic Rituals that this is because nine is the number of the ego since it &quot;always returns to itself&quot; even after being multiplied by any number.

==Science==
===Chemistry===
The purity of chemicals (see Nine (purity)).

===Physiology===
A human pregnancy normally lasts nine months, the basis of Naegele&#x27;s rule.

===Psychology===
Common terminal digit in psychological pricing.

<text>135 film, more popularly referred to as 35 mm film or 35 mm, is a format of photographic film with a film gauge of loaded into a standardized type of magazine (also referred to as a cassette or cartridge) for use in 135 film cameras.

The term 135 was introduced by Kodak in 1934 as a designation for 35 mm film specifically for still photography, perforated with Kodak Standard perforations. It quickly grew in popularity, surpassing 120 film by the late 1960s to become the most popular photographic film size. Despite competition from formats such as 828, 126, 110, and APS, it remains the most popular film size today.

The size of the 135 film frame with its frame&#x27;s aspect ratio of 2:3 has been adopted by many high-end digital single-lens reflex and digital mirrorless cameras, commonly referred to as &quot;full frame&quot;. Even though the format is much smaller than historical medium format and large format film, being historically referred to as &quot;miniature format&quot; or &quot;small format&quot;, it is much larger than image sensors in most compact cameras and smartphone cameras.

The engineering standard for this film is controlled by ISO 1007 titled &#x27;135-size film and magazine&#x27;.

== History ==

=== 35 mm still cameras ===

The 135 film size is derived from earlier still cameras using lengths of 35 mm movie film, which had the same size but with different perforations. The 35 mm film standard for motion picture film was established in Thomas Edison&#x27;s lab by William Kennedy Laurie Dickson. Dickson took 70 mm film stock supplied by George Eastman&#x27;s Eastman Kodak Company. The 70 mm film was cut lengthwise into two equal width (35 mm) strips, spliced together end to end, and then perforated along both edges. The original picture size was 18×24 mm (half the full frame size later used in still photography). There were four perforations on each side of a motion picture frame.

While the Leica camera popularized the format, several 35 mm still cameras used perforated movie film before the Leica was introduced in the 1920s. The first patent for one was issued to Leo, Audobard, and Baradat in England in 1908. The first full-scale production camera was the Homéos, a stereo camera produced by Jules Richard in 1913 and sold until 1920. It took 18x24 mm stereo pairs and used two Tessar lenses.

In 1909, the French designed a device for small-format photography, the &quot;&quot;, which used the 35 mm perforated film to take consecutive hundred views in 18×24 mm. He manufactured it, won the gold medal in the Concours Lépine, and in 1910 sold at a small scale and without much success.

The first big-selling 35 mm still camera was the American Tourist Multiple, which also appeared in 1913, at a cost of $175 (~5,600 US Dollars in 2024) The first camera to take full-frame 24×36 mm exposures seems to be the Simplex, introduced in the U.S. in 1914. It took either 800 half-frame or 400 full-frame shots on 50 ft (15.2 m) rolls.

The Minigraph, by Levy-Roth of Berlin, another half-frame small camera was sold in Germany in 1915. The patent for the Debrie Sept camera, a combination 35 mm still and movie camera was issued in 1918; the camera sold from 1922.

The Furet camera made and sold in France in 1923 took full-frame 24x36 mm negatives, and was the first cheap small 35 mm camera of similar appearance to more modern models.

=== Leica ===
The Leica Camera designed by Oskar Barnack used 35 mm film, and proved that a format as small as 24 mm × 36 mm was suitable for professional photography.

Although Barnack designed his prototype camera around 1913, the first experimental production run of ur-Leicas (Serial No. 100 to 130) did not occur until 1923. Full-scale production of the Leica did not begin until 1925. While by that time, there were at least a dozen other 35 mm cameras available, the Leica was a success. It came to be associated with the format, mostly because of this 35 mm popularity, as well as the entire company legacy. Early Leica cameras are considered highly collectable items. The original Leica prototype holds the record as being the world&#x27;s most expensive camera, selling for €2.16 million in 2012.

=== Pre-loaded cassettes and Kodak Retina cameras ===

In the earliest days, the photographer had to load the film into reusable cassettes and, at least for some cameras, cut the film leader. In 1934, Kodak introduced a &quot;135&quot; daylight-loading single-use cassette. This cassette was engineered so that it could be used in both Leica and Zeiss Ikon Contax cameras along with the camera for which it was invented, namely the Kodak Retina camera. The Retina camera and this daylight loading cassette were the invention of Dr. August Nagel of the &quot;Kodak AG Dr. Nagel Werk&quot; in Stuttgart. Kodak bought Dr. August Nagel&#x27;s company in December, 1931, and began marketing the &quot;Kodak Retina&quot; in the summer of 1934. The first Kodak Retina camera was a Typ 117. The 35 mm Kodak Retina camera line remained in production until 1969. Kodak also introduced a line of American made cameras that were simpler and more economical than the Retina. Argus, too, made a long-lived range of 35 mm cameras; notably the Argus C3. Kodak launched 135-format Kodachrome colour film in 1936. AGFA followed with the introduction of &quot;Agfacolor Neu&quot; later in the same year.

The designations &quot;235&quot; and &quot;435&quot; refer to 35 mm film in daylight-loading spools, that could be loaded into Contax or Leica style reusable cassettes, respectively, without need of a darkroom. The &quot;335&quot; was a daylight loading spool for the 24 × 23 mm stereo format.

=== Reflex cameras ===

Reflex viewfinders, both twin-and single-lens, had been used with earlier cameras using plates and rollfilm.

The first 35 mm single-lens reflex (SLR) was the Kine Exakta, introduced in 1936. World War II interrupted development of the type. After the war, Exakta resumed development and the Contax S model with the now familiar pentaprism viewing feature was introduced in 1949. In the 1950s, the SLR also began to be produced in Japan by such companies as Asahi and Miranda. Asahi&#x27;s Pentax introduced the instant-return mirror, important for the popularity of SLRs; until then, the viewfinder on an SLR camera blanked as the mirror sprang out of the optical path just before taking the picture, returning when the film was wound on. Nikon&#x27;s F model, introduced in March 1959, was a system camera that greatly improved the quality and utility of 35 mm format cameras, encouraging professionals (especially photojournalists) to switch from larger format cameras to the versatile, rugged, and fast SLR design. Numerous other film formats waxed and waned in popularity, but by the 1970s, interchangeable-lens SLR cameras and smaller rangefinders, from expensive Leicas to &quot;point-and-shoot&quot; pocket cameras, were all using 35 mm film, and manufacturers had proliferated.

Colour films improved, both for print negatives and reversal slides, while black-and-white films offered smoother grain and faster speeds than previously available. Since 35 mm was preferred by both amateur and professional photographers, makers of film stock have long offered the widest range of different film speeds and types in the format. The DX film-speed encoding system was introduced in the 1980s, as were single-use cameras pre-loaded with 35 mm film and using plastic lenses of reasonable enough quality to produce acceptable snapshots. Automated all-in-one processing and printing machines made 35 mm developing easier and less expensive, so that quality colour prints became available not only from photographic specialty stores, but also from supermarkets, drugstores, and big box retailers, often in less than an hour.

=== From 1996 to the present ===

In 1996, a smaller format called Advanced Photo System (APS) was introduced by a consortium of photographic companies in an attempt to supersede 135 film. Due in part to its small negative size, APS was not taken seriously as a professional format, despite the production of APS SLRs. In the point-and-shoot markets at which the format was primarily aimed, it enjoyed moderate initial success, but still never rivalled the market penetration of 135. Within five years of its launch, cheap digital compact cameras started becoming widely available, and APS sales plummeted.

While they have shifted the vast majority of their product lines to digital, major camera manufacturers such as Canon and Nikon continued to make expensive professional-grade 35 mm film SLRs until relatively recently (such as the Canon EOS-1V (discontinued in 2018) and the Nikon F6 (discontinued in 2020).

Introductory 35 mm SLRs, compact film point-and-shoot cameras, and single-use cameras continue to be built and sold by a number of makers. Leica introduced the digital Leica M8 rangefinder in 2007, but continues to make its M series rangefinder film cameras and lenses. A digital camera back for the Leica R9 SLR camera was discontinued in 2007. On March 25, 2009, Leica discontinued the R9 SLR and R-series lenses.

By the early 2020s, film photography, particularly 35 mm photography, was experiencing a resurgence in popularity. In a 2021 PetaPixel survey, 75% of respondents expressed interest in newly manufactured analog cameras. Kodak reported in 2022 that it was having trouble keeping up with demand for 35 mm film.

In 2024, the Pentax 17 and the Aflie TYCH+ 35 mm cameras were released, both using the half-frame format to conserve film. Retrospekt and Mattel put out the Malibu Barbie FC-11 35 mm camera. In September 2024, MiNT Camera took pre-orders for the Rollei 35AF, an update of the Rollei 35. Kodak offered six 35 mm film cameras for sale as of October 2024, including the Ektar H35N, another half-frame camera.

== Characteristics ==
=== Cassette ===
Individual rolls of 135 film are enclosed in single-spool, light-tight, metal cassettes to allow cameras to be loaded in daylight. The film is clipped or taped to a spool and exits via a slot lined with flocking. The end of the film is cut on one side to form a leader. It has the same dimensions and perforation pitch as 35 mm movie print film (also called &quot;long pitch&quot;, KS-1870, whereas 35 mm professional motion picture camera films are always &quot;short pitch&quot;, BH-1866).

Most cameras require the film to be rewound before the camera is opened. Some motorized cameras unwind the film fully upon loading and then expose the images in reverse order, returning the film to the cassette; this protects all exposed frames (except the last one or two), should the camera back be accidentally opened; unexposed film gets spoiled, however. Disposable cameras use the same technique so that the user does not have to rewind.
Since 1983, most film cassettes have been marked with a DX encoding six-digit barcode pattern, which uses a DX number to identify the manufacturer and film type (and thus processing method), and the number of exposures, for the use of photofinishing laboratories. The cassettes are also manufactured with a Camera Auto Sensing code constructed as two rows of six rectangular areas on the metal cassette surface which are either conductive or insulating, representing 32 possible film speeds, eight possible film lengths, and four possible values of exposure tolerance or latitude. Conforming cameras detect at least some of these areas; only three contacts are needed to set a light meter for the four most popular film speeds.

=== Film type and speed ===

The 135 film has been made in several emulsion types and sensitivities (film speeds) described by ISO standards. Since the introduction of digital cameras the most usual films have colour emulsions of ISO 100/21° to ISO 800/30°. Films of lower sensitivity (and better picture quality) and higher sensitivity (for low light) are for more specialist purposes. There are colour and monochrome films, negative and positive. Monochrome film is usually panchromatic; orthochromatic has fallen out of use. Film designed to be sensitive to infrared radiation can be obtained, both monochrome and with false-colour (or pseudocolour) rendition. More exotic emulsions have been available in 135 than other roll-film sizes.

=== Image format ===

The term &quot;135 format&quot; usually refers to a 24×36 mm film format, commonly known as 35 mm format. The 24×36 mm format is common to higher-end digital image sensors, where it is typically referred to as &quot;full-frame&quot; format.

On 135 film, the typical cameras produce a frame where the longer dimension of the 24×36 mm frame runs parallel to the length of the film. The perforation size and pitch are according to the standard specification KS-1870. For each frame, the film advances 8 perforations. This is specified as 38.00 mm. This allows for 2 mm gaps between frames. Camera models typically have different locations for the sprocket which advances the film. Therefore, each camera model&#x27;s frame may vary in position relative to the perforations. The film is approximately 0.14 mm thick.

Other image formats have been applied to 135 film, such as the half-frame format of 18×24 mm which earned some popularity in the 1960s, and the 24×24 mm of the Robot cameras. The successful range of Olympus Pen F cameras utilized the smaller half-frame size, allowing the design of a very compact SLR camera. Unusual formats include the 24×32 mm and 24×34 mm on the early Nikon rangefinders, and 24×23 mm for use with some stereo cameras. In 1967, the Soviet KMZ factory introduced a 24×58 mm panoramic format with its Horizont camera (descendants of which are called, in the Roman alphabet, Horizon). In 1998, Hasselblad and Fuji introduced a 24×65 mm panoramic format with their XPan/TX-1 camera. There is also a 21×14 mm format used by Tessina subminiature camera.

=== Length ===
The film is available in lengths for varying numbers of exposures. The standard full-length roll has always been 36 exposures (assuming a standard 24×36 frame size). Through about 1980, 20 exposure rolls were the only shorter length with widespread availability. Since then, 20 exposure rolls have been largely discontinued in favour of 24- and 12-exposure rolls. The length of the film provided includes the length required for the indicated number of exposures plus sufficient additional length for the film spoiled by being exposed to ambient light when it is drawn out of the canister, across the back of the camera, and securely engaged with the film advancing spool before the camera back is closed. A camera that uses less than the maximum distance between the spools may be able to make one additional exposure. Self-loading cameras that load the film after being closed don&#x27;t spoil the additional length provided for conventional loading and can make that additional length available for two or three additional exposures. The same length can be available for exposure in any camera if it is loaded without exposing the film to light, e.g. in a dark room or a dark bag. A 27-exposure disposable camera uses a standard 24-exposure cassette loaded in the dark.

Other, mostly shorter, lengths have been manufactured. There have been some 6-, 8-, 10-, and 15-exposure rolls given away as samples, sometimes in disposable cameras, or used by insurance adjusters to document damage claims. Twelve-exposure rolls have been used widely in the daily press. Photographers who load their own cassettes can use any length of film – with a thinner film base, up to 45 exposures will fit.

The Ilford HP black-and-white film, on a thin polyester base, allowed 72 exposures in a single cassette. They produced special reels and tanks to allow this to be processed.

== Use in digital cameras ==


Digital sensors are available in various sizes. Professional DSLR cameras usually use digital image sensors which approximate the dimensions of the 35 mm format, sometimes differing by fractions of a millimetre on one or both dimensions. Since 2007, Nikon has referred to their 35 mm format by the trade mark FX. Other makers of 35 mm format digital cameras, including Leica, Sony, and Canon, refer to their 35 mm sensors simply as full frame.

Most consumer DSLR cameras use smaller sensors, with the most popular size being APS-C which measures around 23×15 mm (giving it a crop factor of 1.5–1.6). Compact cameras have smaller sensors with a crop factor of around 3 to 6.

=== Use in smart phones ===
Most smartphones (as of 2024) have a default aspect ratio of 4:3 (crop factor of 1.33). Mimicking 35mm film in a smartphone requires cropping to a 3:2 aspect ratio (crop factor of 1.5-1.6). For an authentic homage, one can apply creative digital filters like the ones commonly used in Instagram that map the colour profile to a characteristic look. Different brands of 35mm film would achieve the creative colour profile through a chemical process. For example Fuji Velvia film gave the photo a characteristic of saturated colours under daylight, high contrast, and exceptional sharpness.

== Lenses ==

A true normal lens for 35 mm format would have a focal length of 43 mm, the diagonal measurement of the format. However, lenses of 43 mm to 60 mm are commonly considered &quot;normal&quot; lenses for the format, in mass production and popular use. Common focal lengths of lenses made for the format include 24, 28, 35, 50, 85, 105, and 135 mm. Most commonly, a 50 mm lens is the one considered &quot;normal&quot;; any lens shorter than this is considered a &quot;wide angle&quot; lens and anything above is considered a &quot;telephoto&quot; lens. Even then, wide angles shorter than 24 mm is called an &quot;extreme wide angle&quot;. Lenses above 50 mm but up to about 100 mm are called short telephoto or sometimes, as &quot;portrait telephotos&quot;, from 100 mm to about 200 mm are called &quot;medium&quot; telephotos, and above 300 mm are called &quot;long&quot; telephotos.

With many smaller formats now common (such as APS-C), lenses are often advertised or marked with their &quot;35 mm equivalent&quot; or &quot;full-frame equivalent&quot; focal length as a mnemonic, due to the historic prevalence of the 35 mm format. This &#x27;equivalent&#x27; is computed by multiplying (a) the true focal length of the lens by (b) the ratio of the diagonal measurement of the native format to that of the 35 mm format.

As a result, a lens for an APS-C (18×24 mm) format camera body with a focal length of 40 mm, might be described as &quot;60 mm (35 mm equivalent)&quot;. Although its true focal length remains 40 mm, its angle of view is equivalent to that of a 60 mm lens on a 35 mm format (24×36 mm) camera. Another example is the lens of the 2/3 inch format Fujifilm X10, which is marked with its true zoom range &quot;7.1–28.4 mm&quot; but has a 35 mm-equivalent zoom range of &quot;28–112 mm&quot;.

<doc id="173460" wikidata="Q3077349" url="?curid=173460" title="120 film">
<text>120 is a film format for still photography introduced by Kodak for their &quot;Brownie No. 2&quot; in 1901. It was originally intended for amateur photography but was later superseded in this role by 135 film. 120 film survives to this day as the only medium format film that is readily available to both professionals and amateur enthusiasts.

== Characteristics ==
The 120 film format is a roll film which is nominally between 60.7 mm and 61.7 mm wide. Most modern films made today are roughly 61 mm (2.4 inches) wide. The film is held in an open spool originally made of wood with metal flanges, later with all-metal, and finally with all-plastic. The length of the film is nominally between and , according to the ISO 732:2000 standard. However, some films may be as short as . The film is attached to a piece of backing paper longer and slightly wider than the film. The backing paper protects the film while it is wound on the spool, with enough extra length to allow loading and unloading the roll in daylight without exposing any of the film. Frame number markings for three standard image formats (6×4.5, 6×6, and 6×9 [4:3, 1:1, and 2:3 aspect ratios]; see below) are printed on the backing paper.

The 220 format was introduced in 1965 and is the same width as 120 film, but with about double the length of film and thus twice the number of possible exposures per roll. Unlike 120 film, however, there is no backing paper behind the film itself, just a leader and a trailer. This results in a longer film on the same spool, but there are no printed frame numbers. Because of this, 220 film cannot be used in cameras that rely on reading frame numbers through a red window. Also, since the film alone is thinner than a film with a backing paper, a special pressure plate may be required to achieve optimal focus if the film is registered against its back side. Some cameras capable of using both 120 and 220 film will have a two position adjustment of the pressure plate (e.g. the Pentax 6x7, Mamiya C220 or Mamiya C330) while others will require different film backs e.g. the Pentax 645 or Kowa Six.

The specifications for 120 and 220 film are defined in the ISO 732 standard. Earlier editions of ISO 732 also provided international standards for the 127 and 620 film formats.

== Frame sizes ==

120 film allows several frame sizes.
†

The 6×9 frame has the same aspect ratio as the standard 24×36 mm frame of 135 film. The 6×7 frame enlarges almost exactly to 8×10 inch paper, for which reason its proponents call it &quot;ideal format&quot;. 6×4.5 is the smallest and least expensive roll-film frame size.

The wide 6×12, 6×17, and 6×24 cm frames are produced by special-purpose panoramic cameras. Most of these cameras use lenses intended for large format cameras for simplicity of construction.

Cameras using 120 film will often combine the numbers of the frame size in the name e.g. Pentax 6×7 (6×7), Fuji 617 (6×17), and many &quot;645&quot;s (6×4.5). The number &#x27;6&#x27; in general, and the word &#x27;six&#x27; are also commonly used in naming cameras e.g. Kiev 60 and Pentacon Six.

== Other similar 6 cm roll films ==

The 105 format was introduced by Kodak in 1898 for their first folding camera and was the original 6×9 cm format roll film. The 117 format was introduced by Kodak in 1900 for their first Brownie camera, the No.1 Brownie, 6×6 cm format. These formats used the same width film as 120 film, but with slightly different spools. The 105 spool has a much wider flange, similar to the 116 spool, while the 117 spool&#x27;s flange is slightly narrower than the 120. The 105 and 620 spools also have much thinner flanges than the 117 and 120 spools ( vs. ); as a result, an unmodified 120 spool will not fit a camera designed for 105 film, such as a No. 1 Folding Pocket Kodak, as the overall length between the &quot;outside&quot; of the flanges is too long to fit the width of the film chamber.

The 620 format was introduced by Kodak in 1931 as an intended alternative to 120. Although mostly used by Kodak cameras, it became very popular. The 620 format is essentially the same film on a thinner and narrower all-metal spool (the 120 spool core was made of wood at that time):

* 105 2.509&quot; (63.7 mm) width, 1.250&quot; (31.8 mm) flange, 0.468&quot; (11.9 mm) core
* 117 2.470&quot; (62.7 mm) width, 0.875&quot; (22.2 mm) flange, 0.468&quot; (11.9 mm) core
* 120 2.???&quot; width, 0.990&quot; (25.1 mm) flange, 0.468&quot; (11.9 mm) core
* 620 2.???&quot; width, 0.905&quot; (23.0 mm) flange, 0.280&quot; (7.1 mm) core

Hence the 620 is sometimes referred to as &quot;small hole&quot; 6×6 or 6×9 as opposed to 120 &quot;large hole&quot;. The 620 format was discontinued by Kodak in 1995, but it is possible to rewind 120 film onto a 620 spool in the darkroom for use in 620 cameras. According to Kodak, the narrower metal spool allowed building smaller cameras. Nonetheless the 120 format cast-metal bodied Voigtländer Perkeo remains smaller than any 620 format camera.

<text>The Cessna 172 Skyhawk is an American four-seat, single-engine, high wing, fixed-wing aircraft made by the Cessna Aircraft Company. First flown in 1955, more 172s have been built than any other aircraft. It was developed from the 1948 Cessna 170 but with tricycle landing gear rather than conventional landing gear. The Skyhawk name was originally used for a trim package, but was later applied to all standard-production 172 aircraft, while some upgraded versions were marketed as the Cutlass, Powermatic, and Hawk XP. The aircraft was also produced under license in France by Reims Aviation, which marketed upgraded versions as the Reims Rocket.

Measured by its longevity and popularity, the Cessna 172 is the most successful aircraft in history. Cessna delivered the first production model in 1956, and , the company and its partners had built more than 44,000 units. With a break from 1986–96, the aircraft remains in production today.

A light general aviation airplane, the Skyhawk&#x27;s main competitors throughout much of its history were the Beechcraft Musketeer and Grumman American AA-5 series, though neither are currently in production. Other prominent competitors still in production include the Piper PA-28 Cherokee, and, more recently, the Diamond DA40 Diamond Star and Cirrus SR20.

==Design and development==
The Cessna 172 started as a tricycle landing gear variant of the taildragger Cessna 170, with a basic level of standard equipment. In January 1955, Cessna flew an improved variant of the Cessna 170, a Continental O-300-A-powered Cessna 170C with larger elevators and a more angular tailfin. Although the variant was tested and certified, Cessna decided to modify it with a tricycle landing gear, and the modified Cessna 170C flew again on June 12, 1955. To reduce the time and cost of certification, the type was added to the Cessna 170 type certificate as the Model 172. Later, the 172 was given its own type certificate. The 172 became an overnight sales success, and over 1,400 were built in 1956, its first full year of production.

Early 172s were similar in appearance to the 170s, with the same straight aft fuselage and tall landing gear legs, although the 172 had a straight tailfin while the 170 had a rounded fin and rudder. In 1960, the 172A incorporated revised landing gear and the swept-back tailfin, which is still in use today.

The final aesthetic development, found in the 1963 172D and all later 172 models, was a lowered rear deck allowing an aft window. Cessna advertised this added rear visibility as &quot;Omni-Vision&quot;.

Production halted in the mid-1980s, but resumed in 1996 with the 160 hp (120 kW) Cessna 172R Skyhawk. Cessna supplemented this in 1998 with the 180 hp (135 kW) Cessna 172S Skyhawk SP.

===Modifications===
The Cessna 172 may be modified via a wide array of supplemental type certificates (STCs), including increased engine power and higher gross weights. Available STC engine modifications increase power from , add constant-speed propellers, or allow the use of automobile gasoline. Other modifications include additional fuel tank capacity in the wing tips, added baggage compartment tanks, added wheel pants to reduce drag, or enhanced landing and takeoff performance and safety with a STOL kit. The 172 has also been equipped with the fuel injected Superior Air Parts Vantage engine.

==Operational history==
===World records===
From December 4, 1958, to February 7, 1959, Robert Timm and John Cook set the world record for (refueled) flight endurance in a used Cessna 172, registration number N9172B. They took off from McCarran Field (now Harry Reid International Airport) in Las Vegas, Nevada, and landed back at McCarran Field after 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and 5 seconds in a flight covering an estimated , over 6 times further than flying around the world at the equator. The flight was part of a fund-raising effort for the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund. The aircraft is now on display at the airport.

==Variants==

&quot;Cessna has historically used model years similar to U.S. auto manufacturers, with sales of new models typically starting a few months prior to the actual calendar year.&quot;
Introduced in November 1955 for the 1956 model year as a development of the Cessna 170B with tricycle landing gear, dubbed &quot;Land-O-Matic&quot; by Cessna. The 172 also featured a redesigned tail similar to the experimental 170C, &quot;Para-Lift&quot; flaps, and a maximum gross weight of while retaining the 170B&#x27;s Continental O-300-A six-cylinder, air-cooled engine. The 1957 and 1959 model years brought only minor changes, while 1959 introduced a new cowling for improved engine cooling. The prototype 172, c/n 612, was modified from 170 c/n 27053, which previously served as the prototype of the 170B. A total of 3,757 were constructed over the four model years; 1,178 (1956), 1,041 (1957), 750 (1958), 788 (1959).

1960 model year with a swept-back vertical tail and rudder and powered by a O-300-C engine. It was also the first 172 to be certified for floatplane operation. 994 built.
1961 model year with shorter landing gear, engine mounts lengthened by three inches (76 mm), a reshaped cowling, a pointed propeller spinner, and an increased gross weight of . The stepped firewall introduced in the closely related Cessna 175 was adopted in the 172, along with the 175&#x27;s wider, rearranged instrument panel located further aft in the fuselage. For the first time, the Skyhawk name was applied to an available deluxe option package that included optional wheel fairings, avionics, and a cargo door along with full exterior paint rather than partial paint stripes. The Skyhawk was also powered by an O-300-D in place of the O-300-C of the standard model. 989 built.
1962 model year with fiberglass wingtips, redesigned wheel fairings, a key starter to replace the previous pull-starter, and an optional autopilot. The seats were redesigned to be six-way adjustable, and a child seat was made optional to allow two children to be carried in the baggage area. 810 built.

1963 model year with a cut down rear fuselage with a wraparound Omni-Vision rear window, a one-piece windshield, increased horizontal stabilizer span, and a folding hat shelf in the rear cabin. Gross weight was increased to , where it would stay until the 172P. New rudder and brake pedals were also added. 1,011 were built by Cessna, while a further 18 were produced by Reims Aviation in France as the F172D.
1964 model year with a redesigned instrument panel with center-mounted avionics and circuit breakers replacing the electrical fuses of previous models. 1,209 built, 67 built by Reims as the F172E.
1965 model year with electrically-operated flaps to replace the previous lever-operated system and improved instrument lighting. 1,400 built, plus 94 by Reims as the F172F.

The 172F formed the basis for the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s T-41A Mescalero primary trainer, which was used during the 1960s and early 1970s as initial flight screening aircraft in USAF Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT). Following their removal from the UPT program, some extant USAF T-41s were assigned to the U.S. Air Force Academy for the cadet pilot indoctrination program, while others were distributed to Air Force aero clubs.

1966 model year with a longer, more pointed spinner and sold for US$12,450 in its basic 172 version and US$13,300 in the upgraded Skyhawk version. 1,474 built (including 26 as the T-41A), plus 140 by Reims as the F172G.
1967 model year with a 60A alternator replacing the generator, a rotating beacon replacing the flashing unit, redesigned wheel fairings, and a shorter-stroke nose gear oleo to reduce drag and improve the appearance of the aircraft in flight. A new cowling was used, introducing shock-mounts that transmitted lower noise levels to the cockpit and reduced cowl cracking. The electric stall warning horn was replaced by a pneumatic one. 1,586 built (including 34 as the T-41A), plus 435 by Reims as the F172H for both the 1967 and 1968 model years.

The 1968 model year marked the beginning of the Lycoming-powered 172s, with the 172I introduced with a Lycoming O-320-E2D engine of , an increase of over the Continental powerplant. The increased power resulted in an increase in optimal cruise from true airspeed (TAS) to TAS. There was no change in the sea level rate of climb at per minute. Starting with this model, the standard and deluxe Skyhawk models were no longer powered by different engines. The 172I also introduced the first standard &quot;T&quot; instrument arrangement. 649 built.


For 1968, Cessna planned to replace the 172 with a newly designed aircraft called the 172J, featuring the same general configuration but with a more sloping windshield, a strutless cantilever wing, a more stylish interior, and various other improvements. A single 172J prototype, registered N3765C (c/n 660), was built. However, the popularity of the previous 172 with Cessna dealers and flight schools prompted the cancellation of the replacement plan, and the 172J was redesignated as the 177 from the second prototype onward and sold alongside the 172.

Introduced for the 1969 model year with a redesigned tailfin cap and reshaped rear windows enlarged by . Optional long-range wing fuel tanks were also offered. The 1970 model year featured fiberglass, downward-shaped, conical camber wingtips and optional fully articulated seats. 2,055 built for both model years, plus 50 by Reims as the F172K.
Introduced for the 1971 model year with tapered, tubular steel landing gear legs replacing the original flat spring steel legs, increasing landing gear width by . The new landing gear was lighter, but required aerodynamic fairings to maintain the same speed and climb performance as experienced with the flat steel design. 172L also had a nose-mounted landing light, a bonded baggage door, and optional cabin skylights. The 1972 model year introduced a plastic fairing between the dorsal fin and vertical fin to introduce a greater family resemblance to the 182&#x27;s vertical fin. 1972 also introduced a reduced-diameter propeller, bonded cabin doors, and improved instrument panel controls. 1,535 built for both model years, plus 100 by Reims as the F172L.

Introduced for the 1973 model year with a &quot;Camber-Lift&quot; wing with a drooped leading edge for improved low-speed handling, a key-locking baggage door, and new lighting switches. The 1974 model year introduced the Skyhawk II, which was sold alongside the baseline 172M and Skyhawk models with higher standard equipment, including a second nav/comm radio, an ADF and transponder, a larger baggage compartment, and nose-mounted dual landing lights. 1975 introduced inertia-reel shoulder harnesses and an improved instrument panel and door seals. Beginning in 1976, Cessna stopped marketing the aircraft as the 172 and began exclusively using the &quot;Skyhawk&quot; designation. This model year also saw a redesigned instrument panel to hold more avionics. Among other changes, the fuel and other small gauges were relocated to the left side for improved pilot readability compared with the earlier 172 panel designs. 6,826 built; 4,926 (1973–75) and 1,900 (1976), plus 610 by Reims as the F172M.

1977 model year powered by a Lycoming O-320-H2AD engine designed to run on 100-octane fuel (hence the &quot;Skyhawk/100&quot; name), whereas all previous engines used 80/87 fuel. Other changes included pre-select flap control and optional rudder trim. The 1978 model year brought a 28-volt electrical system to replace the previous 14-volt system as well as optional air conditioning. The 1979 model year increased the flap-extension speed to . 6,425 total built; 1,725 (1977), 1,725 (1978), 1,850 (1979), and 1,125 (1980), plus 525 by Reims as the F172N.
There was no &quot;O&quot; model 172, to avoid confusion with the number zero.

Introduced for the 1981 model year with a Lycoming O-320-D2J engine replacing the O-320-H2AD of the 172N, which had proven unreliable. Other changes included a decreased maximum flap deflection from 40 degrees to 30 to allow a gross weight increase from to . A wet wing and air conditioning were optional. The 1982 model year moved the landing lights from the nose to the wing to increase bulb life, while 1983 added some minor soundproofing improvements and thicker windows. 1984 introduced a second door latch pin, a thicker windshield and side windows, additional avionics capacity, and low-vacuum warning lights. 2,664 total built; 1,052 (1981), 724 (1982), 319 (1983), 179 (1984), 256 (1985), and 134 (1986), plus 215 by Reims as the F172P. Following the end of 172P production in 1986, Cessna ceased production of the Skyhawk for ten years.
Introduced for the 1983 model year, the 172Q was given the name &quot;Cutlass&quot; to create an affiliation with the 172RG Cutlass RG, although it was actually a 172P with a Lycoming O-360-A4N engine of . The aircraft had a gross weight of and an optimal cruise speed of compared to the 172P&#x27;s cruise speed of on less. It had a useful load that was about more than the Skyhawk P and a rate of climb that was actually per minute lower, due to the higher gross weight. The Cutlass II was offered as a deluxe model of the 172Q, as was the Cutlass II/Nav-Pac with IFR equipment. The 172Q was produced alongside the 172P for the 1983 and 1984 model years before being discontinued. Sources disagree on the exact number of 172Q aircraft built, and the construction numbers listed on the Federal Aviation Administration type certificate overlap with those of the 1983 and 1984 172P.
The Skyhawk R was introduced in 1996 and is powered by a derated Lycoming IO-360-L2A producing a maximum of 160 horsepower (120 kW) at just 2,400 rpm. This is the first Cessna 172 to have a factory-fitted fuel-injected engine.

The 172R&#x27;s maximum takeoff weight is . This model year introduced many improvements, including a new interior with soundproofing, an all new multi-level ventilation system, a standard four point intercom, contoured, energy absorbing, 26g front seats with vertical and reclining adjustments and inertia reel harnesses.

The Cessna 172S was introduced in 1998 and is powered by a Lycoming IO-360-L2A producing . The maximum engine rpm was increased from 2,400 rpm to 2,700 rpm resulting in a increase over the &quot;R&quot; model. As a result, the maximum takeoff weight was increased to . This model is marketed under the name Skyhawk SP, although the Type Certification data sheet specifies it is a 172S.

The 172S is built primarily for the private owner-operator and is, in its later years, offered with the Garmin G1000 avionics package and leather seats as standard equipment.

, the 172S model was the only Skyhawk model in production.

=== Variants under 175 type certificate ===
As the Cessna 175 Skylark had gained a reputation for poor engine reliability, Cessna attempted to regain sales by rebranding the aircraft as a variant of the 172. Several later 172 variants, generally those with higher-than-standard engine power or gross weight, were built under the 175 type certificate although most did not use the unpopular Continental GO-300-E engine from the 175.
The 175 Skylark was rebranded for the 1963 model year as the P172D Powermatic, continuing where the Skylark left off at 175C. It was powered by a Continental GO-300-E with a geared reduction drive powering a constant-speed propeller, increasing cruise speed by over the standard 172D. It differed from the 175C in that it had a cut-down rear fuselage with an &quot;Omni-Vision&quot; rear window and an increased horizontal stabilizer span. A deluxe version was marketed as the Skyhawk Powermatic with a slightly increased top speed. Despite the rebranding, sales did not meet expectations, and the 175 type was discontinued for the civilian market after the 1963 model year. 65 were built, plus 3 by Reims as the FP172D.

Although the 175 type was discontinued for the civilian market, Cessna continued to produce the aircraft for the United States Armed Forces as the T-41 Mescalero. Introduced in 1967, the R172E was built in T-41B, T-41C, and T-41D variants for the US Army, USAF Academy, and US Military Aid Program, respectively. As the T-41B, the R172E was powered by a fuel-injected Continental IO-360-D or -DE driving a constant-speed propeller, and featured a 28V electrical system, jettisonable doors, an openable right front window, a 6.00x6 nose wheel tire and military avionics, but no baggage door. The T-41C was similar to the T-41B, but had a 14V electrical system, a fixed-pitch propeller, civilian avionics, and no rear seats. The T-41D featured a 28V electrical system, four seats, corrosion-proofing, reinforced flaps and ailerons, a baggage door, and provisions for wing-mounted pylons. 255 T-41B, 45 T-41C, and 34 T-41D aircraft were built. While Cessna produced the R172E exclusively for military use, Reims built a civilian model as the FR172E Reims Rocket, with 60 built for the 1968 model year.
The R172F was similar to the R172E and was built in both T-41C and T-41D variants. 7 (T-41C) and 74 (T-41D) built, plus 85 by Reims as the FR172F Reims Rocket for the 1969 model year.
The R172G was similar to the R172E/F, differing in that it was certified to be powered by a Continental IO-360-C, -D, -CB, or -DB engine. 28 (T-41D) built, plus 80 by Reims as the FR172G Reims Rocket for the 1970 model year.
The R172H introduced the extended dorsal fillet of the 172L to the T-41D. It was also certified to be powered by a Continental IO-360-C, -D, -H, -CB, -DB, or -HB engine. 163 (T-41D) built, plus 125 by Reims as the FR172H Reims Rocket for the 1971 and 1972 model years.
Certified to be powered by a Continental IO-360-H or -HB engine. Only one was built by Cessna, while Reims built 240 as the FR172J Reims Rocket for the 1973 through 1976 model years.

Following the success of the Reims Rocket in Europe, Cessna decided to once again produce the 175 type for the civilian market as the R172K Hawk XP, beginning with the 1977 model year. It was powered by a derated Continental IO-360-K or -KB engine driving a McCauley constant-speed propeller and featured a new cowling with landing lights and an upgraded interior. The Hawk XP II was also available with full IFR avionics. However, owners claimed that the increased performance of the &quot;XP&quot; did not compensate for its increased purchase price and the higher operating costs associated with the larger engine. The aircraft was well accepted for use on floats, however, as the standard 172 is not a strong floatplane, even with only two people on board, while the XP&#x27;s extra power improves water takeoff performance dramatically. 1 (1973 prototype), 725 (1977), 205 (1978), 270 (1979), 200 (1980), and 55 (1981) built, plus 85 (30 in 1977, 55 in 1978–81) by Reims as the FR172K Reims Rocket for the 1977 through 1981 model years.

Cessna introduced a retractable landing gear version of the 172 in 1980, designating it as the 172RG and marketing it as the Cutlass RG.

The Cutlass RG sold for about US$19,000 more than the standard 172 and featured a variable-pitch, constant-speed propeller and a more powerful Lycoming O-360-F1A6 engine of , giving it an optimal cruise speed of 140 knots (260 km/h), compared to for the contemporary 172N or 172P. It also had more fuel capacity than a standard Skyhawk, versus , giving it greater range and endurance. 

The 172RG first flew on August 24, 1976. It was the lowest-priced four-seat retractable-gear airplane on the U.S. market when it was introduced. Although the general aviation aircraft market was contracting at the time, the RG proved popular as an inexpensive flight-school trainer for complex aircraft and commercial pilot ratings under U.S. pilot certification rules, which required demonstrating proficiency in an aircraft with retractable landing gear.

The 172RG uses the same basic landing gear as the heavier R182 Skylane RG, which Cessna touted as a benefit, saying it was a proven design; however, owners have found the landing gear to have higher maintenance requirements than comparable systems from other manufacturers, with several parts prone to rapid wear or cracking. Compared to a standard 172, the 172RG is easier to load with its center of gravity too far aft, which adversely affects the aircraft&#x27;s longitudinal stability.

While numbered and marketed as a 172, the 172RG was certified on the Cessna 175 type certificate. No significant design updates were made to the 172RG during its five-year model run. 1,191 were produced.

Although it is slower and has less passenger and cargo capacity than popular competing single-engine retractable-gear aircraft such as the Beechcraft Bonanza, the Cutlass RG is praised by owners for its relatively low operating costs, robust and reliable engine, and docile flying qualities comparable to the standard 172, although it has higher landing gear maintenance and insurance costs than a fixed-gear 172.

=== Special versions ===
;J172T 
Model introduced in July 2014 for 2015 customer deliveries, powered by a Continental CD-155 diesel engine installed by the factory under a supplemental type certificate. Initial retail price in 2014 was $435,000 (~$ in ). The model has a top speed of and burns per hour less fuel than the standard 172. As a result, the model has an range, an increase of more than 38% over the standard 172. This model is a development of the proposed and then canceled Skyhawk TD. Cessna has indicated that the JT-A will be made available in 2016.

In reviewing this new model Paul Bertorelli of AVweb said: &quot;I&#x27;m sure Cessna will find some sales for the Skyhawk JT-A, but at $420,000, it&#x27;s hard to see how it will ignite much market expansion just because it&#x27;s a Cessna. It gives away $170,000 to the near-new Redbird Redhawk conversion which is a lot of change to pay merely for the smell of a new airplane. Diesel engines cost more than twice as much to manufacture as gasoline engines do and although their fuel efficiency gains back some of that investment, if the complete aircraft package is too pricey, the debt service will eat up any savings, making a new aircraft not just unattractive, but unaffordable. I haven&#x27;t run the numbers on the JT-A yet, but I can tell from previous analysis that there are definite limits.&quot;

The model was certified by both EASA and the FAA in June 2017. It was discontinued in May 2018, due to poor sales as a result of the aircraft&#x27;s high price, which was twice the price of the same aircraft as a diesel conversion. The aircraft remains available as an STC conversion from Continental Motors, Inc.
In July 2010, Cessna announced it was developing an electrically powered 172 as a proof-of-concept in partnership with Bye Energy. In July 2011, Bye Energy, whose name had been changed to Beyond Aviation, announced the prototype had commenced taxi tests on 22 July 2011 and a first flight would follow soon. In 2012, the prototype, using Panacis batteries, engaged in multiple successful test flights. The R&amp;D project was not pursued for production.

===Canceled model===
On October 4, 2007, Cessna announced its plan to build a diesel-powered model, to be designated the 172 Skyhawk TD (&quot;Turbo Diesel&quot;) starting in mid-2008. The planned engine was to be a Thielert Centurion 2.0, liquid-cooled, two-liter displacement, dual overhead cam, four-cylinder, in-line, turbo-diesel with full authority digital engine control with an output of and burning Jet-A fuel. In July 2013, the 172TD model was canceled due to Thielert&#x27;s bankruptcy. The aircraft was later refined into the Turbo Skyhawk JT-A, which was certified in June 2014 and discontinued in May 2018.

Simulator company Redbird Flight uses the same engine and reconditioned 172 airframes to produce a similar model, the Redbird Redhawk.

Premier Aircraft Sales also announced in February 2014 that it would offer refurbished 172 airframes equipped with the Continental/Thielert Centurion 2.0 diesel engine.

==Military operators==
A variant of the 172, the T-41 Mescalero was used as a trainer with the United States Air Force and Army. In addition, the United States Border Patrol uses a fleet of 172s for aerial surveillance along the Mexico-US border.

From 1972 to 2019 the Irish Air Corps used the Reims version for aerial surveillance and monitoring of cash, prisoner and explosive escorts, in addition to army cooperation and pilot training roles.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On February 13, 1964, Ken Hubbs, second baseman for the Chicago Cubs and winner of the Rookie of the Year Award and the Gold Glove Award, was killed when the Cessna 172 he was flying crashed near Bird Island in Utah Lake.
* On October 23, 1964, David Box, lead singer for The Crickets on their 1960 release version of &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cha Know&quot; and later a solo artist, was killed when the Cessna 172 he was aboard crashed in northwest Harris County, Texas, while en route to a performance. Box was the second lead vocalist for The Crickets to die in a plane crash, following Buddy Holly.
* On August 31, 1969, American professional boxer Rocky Marciano was killed when the Cessna 172 in which he was a passenger crashed on approach to an airfield outside Newton, Iowa.
* On September 25, 1978, a Cessna 172, N7711G, and Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 182, a Boeing 727, collided over San Diego, California. There were 144 fatalities, 2 in the Cessna 172, 135 on the PSA Flight 182 and 7 on the ground.
* On May 28, 1987, a rented Reims Cessna F172P, registered D-ECJB, was used by German teenage pilot Mathias Rust in an unauthorized flight from Helsinki-Malmi Airport through Soviet airspace to land near the Red Square in Moscow, all without being intercepted by Soviet air defense.
* On April 9, 1990, Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 2254, an Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, collided head-on with a Civil Air Patrol Cessna 172, N99501, while en route from Gadsden Municipal Airport to Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The Cessna crashed, killing two occupants, but the Brasilia made a safe emergency landing.
* On January 5, 2002, high school student Charles J. Bishop stole a Cessna 172, N2371N, and intentionally crashed it into the side of the Bank of America Tower in downtown Tampa, Florida, killing only himself and otherwise causing very little damage.
* On April 6, 2009, a Cessna 172N, C-GFJH, belonging to Confederation College in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, was stolen by a student who flew it into United States airspace over Lake Superior. The 172 was intercepted and followed by NORAD F-16s, finally landing on Highway 60 in Ellsinore, Missouri, after a seven-hour flight. The student pilot, a Canadian citizen born in Turkey, Adam Dylan Leon, formerly known as Yavuz Berke, suffered from depression and was attempting to commit suicide by being shot down, but was instead arrested shortly after landing. On November 3, 2009, he was sentenced to two years in a US federal prison after pleading guilty to all three charges against him: interstate transportation of a stolen aircraft, importation of a stolen aircraft, and illegal entry into the US. College procedures at the time allowed easy access to aircraft and keys were routinely left in them.
* On August 16, 2015, Cessna 172M N1285U collided in midair with a private North American Sabreliner, N442RM, on approach to Brown Field Municipal Airport in California, killing all five people on board the two aircraft. The cause was found to be air traffic control error. This accident, together with another fatal 2015 mid-air collision under similar circumstances, prompted the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board to recommend that the FAA more strongly emphasize scenario-based training for controllers.
* On November 11, 2021, Glen de Vries, co-founder of Medidata Solutions and Blue Origin space tourist, died in the crash of a 172 near Hampton Township, New Jersey.
* On March 5, 2024, a 172M of 99 Flying School, 5Y-NNJ, crashed after colliding with Safarilink Aviation Flight 053, a de Havilland Canada Dash 8, near Wilson Airport over Nairobi National Park, killing the instructor and student pilot aboard the 172. The Safarilink flight landed safely with no injuries to the 44 people on board.

<doc id="173466" wikidata="Q1706859" url="?curid=173466" title="Hampshire College">
<text>Hampshire College is a private liberal arts college in Amherst, Massachusetts. It was opened in 1970 as an experiment in alternative education, in association with four other colleges in the Pioneer Valley: Amherst College, Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Together they are known as the Five College Consortium. The campus also houses the National Yiddish Book Center and Eric Carle Museum, and hosts the annual Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics.

The college utilizes an alternative curriculum, with an emphasis on progressive pedagogy and self-directed academic concentrations, a focus on portfolios rather than distribution requirements, and a reliance on narrative evaluations instead of grades and GPAs.

In January 2019, following the announcement that the college would seek a merger with another institution, the college received backlash from students and faculty and announced a re-envisioning project to ensure the college remain independent and sustainable. As a result of the controversy, President Miriam Nelson stepped down; Hampshire hired its tenth president, Edward Wingenbach, beginning an effort to revise the curriculum in order to increase interdisciplinarity, collaboration, and access.

== History ==

The idea for Hampshire College originated in 1958 when the presidents of Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Smith Colleges, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst appointed a committee to examine the assumptions and practices of liberal arts education. Their report, &quot;The New College Plan&quot;, advocated many of the features that have since been realized in the Hampshire curriculum: inviting students to self-design their program of studies; training students to be able to educate themselves through their lifetimes; emphasis on each student&#x27;s curiosity and motivation; learning among and across multiple disciplines; and close mentoring relationships with teachers.

In 1965, Amherst College alumnus Harold F. Johnson, inspired by the New College Plan, donated $6 million toward the founding of Hampshire College. With a matching grant from the Ford Foundation, Hampshire&#x27;s first trustees purchased of orchard and farmland in South Amherst, Massachusetts, and construction began.

One of the most important founding documents of Hampshire College is the book &quot;The Making of a College&quot; (MIT Press, 1967; ), co-written by the College&#x27;s first president, Franklin Patterson, together with Hampshire&#x27;s founding employee from Amherst College who would become its second president, Chuck Longsworth. &quot;The Making of a College&quot; is (as of 2003) out of print but available in electronic form from the Hampshire College Archives.

Hampshire admitted its first students in 1970. For several years immediately after its founding in the early 1970s, the large number of applications for matriculation caused Hampshire College to be among the most selective undergraduate programs in the United States. Its admissions selectivity declined after that because of declining application popularity. The school&#x27;s number of applications increased again in the late 1990s, causing increased admissions selectivity.

The school has been financially challenged throughout its history, largely because it lacked a founding endowment to rely on for income stability. It has relied substantially on tuition income for operations. As of June 30, 2017, the endowment had risen to $48.5 million. In recent years, the school has been on more solid financial footing, though still lacking a sizable endowment. In recent years its financial stability has relied on fundraising efforts led by its seventh president, Jonathan Lash.

In the mid-1990s, the college began establishing a &quot;cultural village&quot; making possible the residence of independent non-profit organizations on its campus. The cultural village includes the National Yiddish Book Center, the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art and The Hitchcock Center for the Environment.

Adele Simmons served as the College&#x27;s third president from 1977 to 1989. Gregory Prince served as its fourth president from 1989 to 2005, the longest tenure of any Hampshire president.

On April 1, 2004, Prince announced his retirement, effective at the end of the 2004–2005 academic year. On April 5, 2005, the Board of Trustees named Ralph Hexter, formerly a dean at University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s College of Letters and Science, as the college&#x27;s next president, effective August 1, 2005. Hexter was inaugurated on October 15, 2005. The appointment made Hampshire one of a small number of colleges and universities in the United States with an openly gay president.

Professor Marlene Gerber Fried was interim president from 2010 to 2011. Jonathan Lash was named the sixth president of the College in May 2011, joining Hampshire as an internationally recognized expert on global sustainability, climate change, and environmental challenges and solutions. Two US Presidents have appointed him to serve on a national environmental council and commission. Lash served until 2018 and was followed by the college&#x27;s seventh president, Miriam Nelson, who began her appointment in July 2018 but resigned in April 2019 after the failure of her plan for Hampshire to merge or partner with another institution.

The Hampshire College Archives in the Harold F. Johnson Library has extensively documented the college&#x27;s history between 1965 and 2005, accessible on the college&#x27;s Web site.

On August 23, 2012, the school announced the establishment of a scholarship fund dedicated to helping undocumented students get degrees. It would give more than $25,000 yearly to help an undocumented student pay for the $43,000-plus tuition.

===2019 strategic partnership and financial challenges===
On January 15, 2019, president Miriam Nelson and the Board of Trustees announced that the college was planning to seek a strategic partner to ensure long-term sustainability due to financial instability and small endowment. In addition, the college was considering not accepting a new first-year class for Fall 2019, due to concerns with compliance and accreditation. On February 1, the board of trustees voted that, for the Fall 2019 semester, it would only be admitting about 60 students who had already been offered early admission or who had previously deferred admission until Fall 2019. Furthermore, early admission students were released from their pledge to attend Hampshire College.

Some alumni protested these decisions, as did many students, who organized sit-ins in the Dean of Students office and the Office of the President, demanding more transparency from the administration and board of trustees and for student, staff, and faculty voices to be taken into account in decision-making processes. The occupation in the Dean of Students office ended after a few weeks, and the sit-in in the president&#x27;s office lasted for 75 days, ending on April 22, 2019.

Following an announcement of the possibility that 30%–50% of the faculty and staff might be laid off, the faculty held a vote of no confidence in President Nelson, the board chair, the board vice chair, the incoming board chair, the board treasurer, and the vice president for finance and administration. Because a binding motion is required to be public for seven days before it is acted on, the February 20 no-confidence vote was not binding. A week later, the majority of the faculty decided not to move forward with a binding vote of no confidence.

On March 31, the chair of the board of trustees resigned. On April 5, Miriam Nelson, the Board&#x27;s Vice Chair, and six other trustees resigned. Nelson said that her continued presence would be a &quot;distraction&quot; from the necessary work of improving the college&#x27;s financial future. Shortly afterwards, the board announced the decision to prioritize remaining independent through a capital campaign led by alumnus Ken Burns. Ken Rosenthal was named interim president. The first round of layoffs primarily affected the admissions and fundraising offices, effective April 19, 2019. Ed Wingenbach became the new president in August.

Gradually, more information was released on what had happened. In February, following a public records request, the University of Massachusetts Amherst released emails between its chancellor and Hampshire&#x27;s president discussing a partnership between the two schools, later confirmed by UMass&#x27; president. By August, emails were released stating that, UMass was considering the idea but only if Hampshire would be closed entirely and there were massive layoffs of its faculty. Hampshire wanted its name and its &quot;spirit of interdisciplinary and independent studies&quot; to continue, its students would be able to continue their studies at UMass, and that Hampshire&#x27;s staff and faculty would be considered for positions at UMass. Ultimately, UMass and Hampshire could not come to an agreement.

In September 2019, the first-year class was 13 students. Total enrollment was around 750 students, substantially less than typical, due to decreased retention rates.

=== How Hampshire is rebuilding ===
The fundraising campaign, &quot;Change in the Making: A Campaign for Hampshire&quot; was launched in late 2019 with the goal of raising $60 million in unrestricted operating support by 2024. By March 2023, nearly $40 million had been raised. Alumnus documentarian Ken Burns committed to serve as cochair. In November 2020, Hampshire received its largest single donation since its founding, $5 million, by alumnus James S. Crown and his wife, Paula H. Crown. Later that month, alumnus Dr. Lucy McFadden contributed $2 million. In January 2022, The College received an anonymous gift of $5 million to fund the Ken Burns Initiative to Transform Higher Education. In January 2023, Stonyfield Yogurt cofounder and Hampshire alumnus Gary Hirshberg invested $1 million in the campaign.

In 2021, the College rebuilt its admissions operations, resulting in a 68 percent increase in enrollment over fall 2020 and a 100 percent increase in first-year enrollments over 2020. In fall of 2022, Hampshire welcomed its largest entering class since 2018, with 275 new students.

In 2020, continuing its legacy of innovation, Hampshire did away with departmental structures, reorganizing around urgent, global challenges like climate change, white supremacy, and life in a &quot;post-truth&quot; era.

Delayed a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Hampshire celebrated its 50th anniversary over the weekend of October 15–17, 2021, welcoming back to campus almost 900 guests, among them alums, families, community friends, donors, and former presidents and faculty members. Current staff, faculty, and students also participated in the festivities.

On March 9, 2023, &quot;in response to the continuing attacks on New College of Florida intended to limit intellectual exploration, turn back progress toward inclusion, and curtail open discussion of race, injustice, and histories of oppression,&quot; Hampshire College extended an invitation of admission to its students, matching their current cost of tuition.

==Academics and resources==

=== Curriculum ===
Hampshire College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education. Hampshire College describes itself as &quot;experimenting&quot; rather than &quot;experimental&quot;, to emphasize the changing nature of its curriculum. From its inception, the curriculum has generally had certain non-traditional features:
* An emphasis on &quot;project work&quot; as well as, or instead of, courses
* Detailed &quot;written evaluations&quot; (as well as portfolio evaluations) for completed courses and projects, rather than letter or number grades
* A curriculum centered on &quot;student interests&quot;, with students taking an active role in designing their own concentrations and projects
* An emphasis on independent motivation and student organization, both within and without the college&#x27;s formal curriculum

The curriculum is divided into three &quot;divisions&quot; rather than four grade-years:
* Division I: Exploration and Working Across Disciplines
* Division II: Concentration
* Division III: Creating Knowledge
Division II takes up two years, while Divisions I and III take up one.

Its most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were:
::Creative Writing (33)
::Art/Art Studies (20)
::Film/Video &amp; Photographic Arts (14)
::Sociology (10)

===Schools and programs===
The Hampshire College faculty are organized broadly in defined Schools of thought:
* Cognitive Science (CS): includes linguistics, most psychology, some philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science.
* Humanities, Arts, and Cultural Studies (HACU): includes film, some studio arts, literature, media studies, architecture, art history, dance, music, and most philosophy.
* Critical Social Inquiry (CSI): includes most sociology and anthropology, economics, history, politics, and some psychology.
* Natural Science (NS): includes most traditional sciences, mathematics, and biological anthropology.
* Interdisciplinary Arts (IA): includes theater, some studio arts, creative writing, and social entrepreneurship.

The Five College Program in Peace and World Security Studies (PAWSS) is based at Hampshire; its director is Michael Klare.
The national reproductive rights organization Civil Liberties and Public Policy (CLPP) operates on Hampshire&#x27;s campus, where they host an annual conference.
In 2014 Hampshire announced the formation of a new concentration, in Psychoanalytic Studies.

===Five College Consortium===

Hampshire College is the youngest of the schools in the Five-College Consortium. The other schools are Amherst College, Mt. Holyoke College, Smith College and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Students at each of the schools may take classes and borrow books at the other schools, generally without paying additional fees. They may use resources at the other schools, including internet access, dining halls, and so forth. The five colleges collectively offer over 5,300 courses, and the five libraries have over eight million books. The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) operates bus services between the schools and the greater Pioneer Valley area.

There are two joint departments in the five-college consortium: Dance and Astronomy.

==Admissions==

Hampshire College stopped accepting SAT and ACT scores of applicants in 2014 both to eliminate income and ethnicity biases in standardized testing and focus assessment on data better correlated with college success and on a longer period of time rather than a single high-pressure test. As a result, it was dropped from the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Colleges Ranking. The next year, the college said this move decreased the quantity but increased the quality and diversity of applicants, eliminated the incentive to &quot;game&quot; the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranking by admitting less-qualified students with higher numerical scores or encouraging unqualified students to apply.

==Sustainability==

===The R.W. Kern Center===

Opened on April 26, 2017, the R.W. Kern Center is the 17th Living Building in the world certified under the advanced green-building standard, the Living Building Challenge. The building cost $10.4 million made possible by private donations. It operates net-zero energy, water, and waste. The building is powered by solar panels on its roof, supplies its own drinking water by harvesting rainwater from its roof, manages its wastewater on site, and contains composting toilets. The Kern Center was built using materials from local sources without the use of any toxic &quot;red list&quot; materials; even materials such as duct tape were chosen carefully to comply with strict environmental standards. Currently, the Kern Center houses Admissions and financial aid offices as well as classrooms, student lounges, and a coffee shop. President Jonathan Lash stated that &quot;[w]ith this building we have sought to reflect our values, in the inclusive design process, the design and materials, our construction practices, and our reporting about the building... [w]hy are buildings constructed any other way? In every way, the Kern Center was built to learn and teach.&quot;

=== Climate Action Plan ===
In the next 20 years, the college plans to reduce 50% of current consumption of energy, another major goal stated in their Climate Action Plan. They plan to renovate the Robert Crown Center, Library, Cole Science Center, Franklin Patterson Hall, Merrill House, and Greenwich House. The plan is made possible by a $1 million gift.

====Solar power====
Hampshire College planned to become the first college in the United States to be 100% solar powered. The solar panel array is a part of the college&#x27;s main goal - to be climate-neutral by 2020 according to their extensive Climate Action Plan developed in April 2012. The school purchases solar credits and sells solar energy from its field. They began construction in February 2015. Two witness tests were conducted in June 2017 and its final one conducted November 2017. Since June 2017, part of the solar array has been powering the college. The solar panels cover 19 acres consisting of 15,000 panels which will eventually produce 4.7 megawatts of power. Hampshire College contracted with SolarCity to install the panels.

The college announced it will save up to $8 million in electricity cost in 20 years and $400,000 yearly. The 4.7 megawatts of solar power avoids 3,000 metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions per year, equivalent to 650 fewer cars on the road. Other solar sources on campus contribute to the primary solar array&#x27;s power production: the Kern Center rooftop solar arrays, the CSA Barn, the president&#x27;s house, and the Longworth Arts Center canopy. The president stated that &quot;[t]his is the challenge that our students and every other student is going to face in the next 20 years, how to turn the US economy into a low-carbon economy ... and they&#x27;re going to get the real firsthand experience of doing it. So that was reason number one.&quot; The president has declared that switching to renewable energy is &quot;just the right thing to do in an era of accelerating climate change.&quot; He also noted this project will keep jobs local and avoid pipelines being built through people&#x27;s communities to get power to our college.&quot;

In February of 2023, The College announced that it had achieved its 2022 goal of carbon neutrality for all campus emissions, including electricity and natural gas heating.

===Timeline of Sustainability Initiative===
Since 2011, Hampshire College has been involved in various projects to &quot;transform its food systems, campus operations, curriculum and campus culture to embrace sustainability.&quot; The college&#x27;s advances in sustainability include various projects. In 2011, the college was the first in the world to divest from fossil-fuels. In 2012, they developed the Climate Action Plan for climate neutrality by 2022. Hampshire College Farm expanded their education and operation, establishing the Center for New England and Agriculture. In 2014 the main traffic circle and parking lot was eliminated and turned into a meadow. They also stopped mowing dozen acres of lawns in hopes of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, saving landscaping expenses and creating wildlife and plant habitats. In the same year, they installed an electric car-charging station behind the library. In 2015 they permanently protected 46 acres of their property through a conservation restriction. The Kern Center became their first 100% emission-free building in 2016 and the Hitchcock Center for the Environment built its new living building on Hampshire land. In 2017, Hampshire College pledged to continue to support climate action and reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement. They signed the We Are Still In campaign along with 2,600 total signers.

==&quot;Re-Radicalization&quot; student group==
In the spring of 2004, a student group calling itself Re-Radicalization of Hampshire College (Re-Rad) emerged with a manifesto called &quot;The Re-Making of a College&quot;, which critiqued what they saw as a betrayal of Hampshire&#x27;s founding ideas in alternative education and student-centered learning. On May 3, 2004, the group staged a demonstration that packed the hall outside the President&#x27;s office during an administrative meeting. Response from the community was generally amicable and Re-Rad made some progress.

The Re-Radicalization movement was responding in part to a new &quot;First-Year Plan&quot; that changed the structure of the first year of study. Beginning in the Fall of 2002, the requirements for passing Division I were changed so that first-year students no longer had to complete independent projects (see Curriculum above). Re-Rad submitted its own counter-proposal in both 2006 and 2007, but these proposals were not acted on, and no follow-up was attempted.

The Re-Radicalization of Hampshire College assisted the administration in launching a pilot program known as &quot;mentored independent study&quot;. This program paired ten third semester students with Division III students with similar academic interests to complete a small study—observed by, and subject to the approval of, a faculty member.

While some students worry about what they see as Hampshire&#x27;s headlong plunge into normality, the circumstances of Hampshire&#x27;s founding tends to perennially attract students who revive the questions about education the institution was founded on, and who challenge the administration to honor the founding mission. Unsurprisingly, then, Re-Rad was not the first student push of its type. Similar efforts have sprung up at Hampshire with some regularity, with varying impacts. In 1996, student Chris Kawecki spearheaded a similar push called the Radical Departure, calling for a more holistic, organic integration of education into students&#x27; lives. The most durable legacy of the Radical Departure was EPEC, a series of student-led non-credit courses.

A more detailed account of movements such as these can be found in &quot;A Documentary History of Hampshire College, Vol. 4: 1995–2005&quot;.

==Campus issues==
===Divestment===

In May 1977, Hampshire was the first college in the nation to divest from apartheid South Africa. The college removed $39,000 in stocks in four companies (). In February 2009 it was reported that Hampshire College had divested from Israel because of its violation of human rights. However, under pressure from pro-Israel groups and high-profile individuals, most notably attorney Alan Dershowitz, the father of a Hampshire alumnus, Hampshire&#x27;s president stated that the changes in investments were not politically motivated. Hampshire displayed a statement from Dershowitz on its website until at least October, 2021, in which the lawyer withdrew his criticism and pledged his support, stating, &quot;Hampshire has now done the right thing. It has made it unequivocally clear that it did not and will not divest from Israel. Indeed, it will continue to hold stock in companies that do business with Israel as well as with Israeli companies...&quot;

===American flag===
Following the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, on November 9, 2016, Hampshire students lowered the American flag at the center of campus to half-staff as &quot;a protest against acts of hate and harassment.&quot; The next day, school officials announced they would allow the flag to remain at half-staff temporarily. College president Jonathan Lash said in a statement that some of the people on campus felt that the flag was &quot;a powerful symbol of fear they&#x27;ve felt all their lives because they grew up in marginalized communities, never feeling safe.&quot; In an incident under investigation by campus police, the flag was burned at some time in the evening of November 10 or the morning of November 11. It was replaced the following day and the school indicated it would continue to fly the flag at half-staff &quot;to mourn deaths from violence in the U.S. and around the world.&quot; Following a backlash, the college announced on November 21 that it would temporarily cease flying the flag on campus. This, in turn, led to protests including veterans for restoration of the flag, with sources claiming from 400 attendees to &quot;over a thousand.&quot; Local state representative John Velis (D) called for the school to return the flag and expel the students who burned the flag: they should &quot;pack up their bags and leave.&quot; On November 29, shortly after Fox News aired a news segment on the incident, Trump tweeted &quot;Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag—if they do, there must be consequences—perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!&quot; On December 2, the school decided to raise the flag to full staff.

==In the media==
In November 2001, a controversial All-Community Vote at Hampshire declared the school opposed to the recently launched War on Terrorism after 9/11, another national first that drew national media attention, including scathing reports from Fox News Channel and the &quot;New York Post&quot; (&quot;Kooky College Condemns War&quot;).

&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; had a regular sketch, &quot;Jarret&#x27;s Room&quot;, starring Jimmy Fallon, which ostensibly takes place at Hampshire College but is instead a composite of several schools. It refers to non-existent buildings (&quot;McGuinn Hall&quot;, which is actually the Sociology and Social Work building at fellow cast member Amy Poehler&#x27;s alma mater, Boston College) and features yearbooks, tests, seniors, fraternities, three-person dorm rooms, and a football team—none of which the school has ever had. The sketch also claims that the college is actually in New Hampshire rather than Massachusetts. These characters would later be revived on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon during the COVID-19 pandemic. In another SNL episode aired on December 14, 2002, host Al Gore plays Dr. Ralph Wormly Curtis, a professor at Hampshire College. The same sketch implies that the band Phish attends Hampshire as well, though in reality all four members attended the University of Vermont. In Whit Stillman&#x27;s comedy-drama film &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot;, Chloë Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale star as two recent Hampshire graduates in the early 1980s in the disco scene of New York City.

Alumnus Ken Burns wrote of the college: &quot;Hampshire College is a perfect American place. If we look back at the history of our country, the things we celebrate were outside of the mainstream. Much of the world operated under a tyrannical model, but Americans said, &#x27;We will govern ourselves.&#x27; So, too, Hampshire asked, at its founding, the difficult questions of how we might educate ourselves... When I entered Hampshire, I found it to be the most exciting place on earth.&quot; Loren Pope wrote of Hampshire in the college guide &quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot;: &quot;Today no college has students whose intellectual thyroids are more active or whose minds are more compassionately engaged.&quot;

The events around the planned closure of the college that was made unsuccessful by student protests are the subject of the 2022 film &quot;The Unmaking of a College&quot;.

==Alumni and faculty==

<doc id="173467" wikidata="Q2142982" url="?curid=173467" title="Paul Hester">
<text>Paul Newell Hester (8 January 1959 – 26 March 2005) was an Australian musician and television personality. He was the drummer for the band Split Enz for their last year together from December 1983 to December 1984, and co-founding member and drummer of the band Crowded House.

== Early years ==
Hester was the elder of two children (his younger sister is Carolyn). He was born in Melbourne, Victoria, the son of a bushman father and jazz drummer mother. At an early age he was encouraged by his mother to play drums. His extrovert personality did not impress his teachers, and he left school early and attempted various jobs before starting a musical career. He spent most of his teen years living in the Dandenong Ranges, the family home being on the edge of Sherbrooke Forest at the Sherbrooke/Kallista boundary. Some of the Melbourne bands he played in from 1976 to 1978 included Thunder and Edges. In 1979 he co-founded a Melbourne-based band called Cheks (renamed Deckchairs Overboard when they moved to Sydney in 1982).

He lived with Deborah Conway of Do-Ré-Mi during the early 1980s, while playing regularly in Love Party. Hester later worked with Conway in Rose Amongst Thorns (1990–1991) and Ultrasound (1995).

== Split Enz and Crowded House ==

=== Split Enz ===
At the departure of drummer Mal Green from Split Enz in 1981, their percussionist Noel Crombie took up the role of drummer. After the release of the Enz album &quot;Time and Tide&quot; in 1982, the band took a break to focus on other projects. According to the radio documentary &quot;Enzology&quot;, when they reformed in mid-1983, both Finn brothers returned somewhat distracted. Tim Finn had just released the very successful solo album &quot;Escapade&quot;, while younger brother Neil Finn had a child on the way.

The reunion resulted in &quot;Conflicting Emotions&quot; (November 1983), an album which marked the beginning of the end for the band. Before the tour to support the album it was decided that Crombie would return to percussion (something he says he enjoyed more than drumming), and the band would find a new drummer. Hester was auditioned on the advice of Rob Hirst of Midnight Oil and got the job. In June 1984, founder Tim Finn left Split Enz, and they released &quot;See Ya &#x27;Round&quot; in November which included &quot;This is Massive&quot; which was written by Hester. When Split Enz disbanded in December, Hester and Neil Finn decided to start a new group.

=== Crowded House ===
Initially, the new band formed by Hester and Neil Finn was named &quot;The Mullanes&quot; and then underwent a few name changes. They recruited Nick Seymour to play bass guitar and Craig Hooper on guitar, Hooper left as they secured a recording contract with Capitol Records in the US. However, Capitol disliked the name and the band changed to Crowded House to record their debut eponymous album, &quot;Crowded House&quot; in 1986. Other records by Crowded House with Hester are: &quot;Temple of Low Men&quot; (1988), &quot;Woodface&quot; (1991), &quot;Together Alone&quot; (1993), and the Best-of collection &quot;Recurring Dream&quot; (1996).

By 1993, Hester was frustrated by the demands of his career and suffered a phobia about leaving to go on tour. On his return to Australia that year, he started to see a psychiatrist. He remained with Crowded House until 1994, when the pressure of touring and the birth of his first daughter made him want to stay home, rather than remain on the road. Hester left mid-way through a 1994 tour of America, forcing the band to recruit British drummer Peter Jones for the rest of the tour. Hester performed with Crowded House at the band&#x27;s farewell concert on the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House in 1996. As of 2021, Crowded House have sold well over 20 million albums. In November 2016, the band and all of its original members (including Hester) were inducted into the ARIA Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.

== After Crowded House ==
Towards the end of his time with Crowded House, Paul produced The Holy Toledos&#x27; second album, &quot;Blood&quot;, and played drums on its first single. It was on his recommendation the band was picked up by Sony.

After leaving Crowded House, Hester appeared on many TV and radio shows in Australia and opened a cafe/restaurant named Beach House Cafe with fellow Melbourne musician Joe Camilleri in Elwood Beach in Melbourne. From 1995 until 1998, Hester appeared regularly on the popular Australian radio show &quot;Martin/Molloy&quot;. He collaborated with John Clifforth, a former Deckchairs Overboard bandmate and long time friend, in the early 2000&#x27;s on &quot;Craven&#x27;s Pharmacy&quot; where he played drums and instruments on multiple songs. He played drums as a session musician for producer Richard Pleasance. One of his final recordings was Sophie Koh&#x27;s debut album &quot;All the Pretty Boys&quot;.

Hester also briefly worked with the popular Australian children&#x27;s music group The Wiggles in 1998, playing drums on their album Toot Toot! and making a guest appearance on their video Yummy Yummy as Paul the Cook.

=== Largest Living Things ===
Hester later became involved in a new band called Largest Living Things (1997–2000), with Kevin Garant on guitar and Barry Stockley on bass, performing with members of rock groups Crowded House, Split Enz, Midnight Oil, and others. Largest Living Things released a few EPs in Australia featuring songs written and sung by Hester; in contrast to his previous work in Crowded House, Hester played guitar as well as drums. The Largest Living Things featured on Mick Molloy&#x27;s controversial 1999 TV show &quot;The Mick Molloy Show&quot;, with Hester as bandleader. Hester co-founded Tarmac Adam with former Crowded House bandmate Nick Seymour and Matt O&#x27;Donnell, Sean McVitty and Steve Paix in 2001, which released their debut album &quot;Handheld Torch&quot; in 2003.

=== &quot;Hessie&#x27;s Shed&quot; ===
In 1998, Hester hosted his own 10-part TV series &quot;Hessie&#x27;s Shed&quot; on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). This show gave Hester the room to explore his humorous presenter skills, showcase some friends, reunite with friends from Crowded House, and play with the house band, Largest Living Things, with Hester now performing from behind the drums and on the guitar.

=== The MAX Sessions ===
Hester went on to host the intimate concerts The MAX Sessions. Broadcast on MAX, these intimate concerts, which were mainly recorded at the Sydney Opera House, featured a variety of local and international acts. A highlight of the show&#x27;s concerts saw Hester reunite with former bandmates Neil Finn and Tim Finn for a few songs, backing them on drums, while they were promoting their album &quot;Everyone Is Here&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Hester was in a relationship with Deborah Conway from Do-Re-Mi in the early 1980s. He later formed a relationship with photographer Mardi Sommerfeld and they had two daughters. They lived in the suburb of Elwood in Melbourne, Victoria.

== Death and commemorations ==
On 26 March 2005, aged 46, Hester died by suicide at Elsternwick Park in Brighton, Melbourne, near his home. Four years earlier he had split from Mardi Sommerfeld. His two daughters, Olive and Sunday, were aged 5 and 10 at the time of his death. A few years before his death Hester&#x27;s mother became ill, and died in 2003. It was known to family and close friends that he had been suffering from depression for a few years prior to his passing, and was prone to mood swings.

Hester was buried at Blackwood in the Central Highlands region of Victoria. His life was commemorated at the 2005 Aria Awards, with Neil Finn singing the staple Crowded House anthem solo &quot;Better Be Home Soon&quot; along with a mini-biography and footage from his life and achievements.

In October 2005, in memory of Hester and to acknowledge his long links with the area, the local Port Phillip Council agreed to name a path alongside the Elwood Canal, the Paul Hester Walk, after him. More recently, Hester Street in the Melbourne suburb of Officer was named after him.

Hester&#x27;s girlfriend at the time of his death was New Zealand-based singer Kashan Vincent. In July 2006, Vincent sued his estate, claiming a third of his net worth. Vincent claimed the pair had a relationship for 32 months and, while not cohabiting, were engaged, but had called off their wedding. By May 2007, the lawsuit was resolved out of court, with Vincent receiving a payout, and Hester&#x27;s two daughters named as the sole beneficiaries of their father&#x27;s estate.

In 2007, a reformed Crowded House dedicated its album &quot;Time on Earth&quot; to Hester.

<doc id="173470" wikidata="Q255055" url="?curid=173470" title="Speyside single malt">
<text>Speyside single malts are single malt Scotch whiskies, distilled in Strathspey, the area around the River Spey in Moray and Badenoch and Strathspey, in northeastern Scotland.

The two best-selling single malt whiskies in the world, The Glenlivet and Glenfiddich, come from Speyside. Strathspey has the greatest number of distilleries of any of the whisky-producing areas of Scotland. Dufftown alone has six working distilleries with an annual capacity of 40.4 million litres of spirit.

==Legal status==

Speyside is a &quot;protected region&quot; for Scotch Whisky distilling under UK Government legislation. According to &quot;Visit Scotland&quot;, this region includes the area between the Highlands to the west, Aberdeenshire in the east and extending south to the Cairngorms National Park. Due to the way that the regions are specified, Speyside is wholly within the Highland region and thus whiskies produced in Speyside may legally be described as coming from either region.

==Distilleries==

Illicit distilleries were common in the 1800s, but eventually, licences became available after the passing of the 1823 Excise Act. George Smith was the first licensee in Speyside, in 1824, and his small operation at Upper Drumin in the Glen Livet valley eventually grew into the massive Glenlivet enterprise.

Today, the major distilleries in the region are owned by leading international drinks groups including Diageo, LVMH and Pernod Ricard, by family-owned companies including J. &amp; G. Grant and William Grant &amp; Sons and by The Edrington Group (majority-owned by a charitable trust).

Roughly 50 percent of Scotland&#x27;s whisky is made here in the approximately 50 distilleries located in this region. According to one source, the top five are The Macallan, Glenfiddich, Aberlour, Glenfarclas and Balvenie.

This dry, warm, region is a natural for whisky distillers because it is close to barley farms, contains the River Spey and is close to the Atlantic port of Garmouth. The water in the area is said to have &quot;the lowest level of dissolved minerals&quot; of any area in Scotland, and that may affect the taste of its whiskies. Another report explains that &quot;quartzite at the source keeps high levels of minerals from mixing with the water&quot;.

The &quot;Visit Scotland&quot; website indicates that the region&#x27;s whiskies have a fruity nature &quot;ranging from ripe pears to sultanas&quot; and some exhibit &quot;sweet, caramel and fruity notes&quot;. Another review states that the use of peat is not common here, so many of the whiskies are not &quot;smoky&quot;; the article concluded that &quot;typically, most Speyside whisky is fruity, sweet, and nutty, featuring notes of apple, honey, vanilla, and spice&quot;.

=== Benefits to the region ===
In addition to providing jobs and income for barley farmers and distillery employees in the region, whisky production has helped improve tourism. Hotels and others with tourism businesses then benefit. All regions of that produce Scotch Whisky benefit, of course; the Scotch Whisky Association estimated in 2019 that whisky tourism in Scotland generates £68.3 million per year. The Association also stated that the industry supported 40,000 jobs and accounted for over £4 billion in exports for Scotland; the specific benefits for Speyside were not provided.

The region hosts an annual whisky festival known as &quot;Spirit of Speyside&quot;.

Scotland&#x27;s Malt Whisky Trail is a tourism initiative featuring seven working Speyside distilleries, a historic distillery (Dallas Dhu, now a museum) and the Speyside Cooperage. A 2012 BBC article recommends a leisurely tour, taking a day or two at each distillery to appreciate the local &quot;traditions and lore&quot;. In 2017, tourism in the Moray Speyside area increased significantly, by 50,000 visitors, primarily because of the appeal of the Malt Whisky Trail in the region. A Trail rep stated (in summer 2019) that 60% of tourists to Speyside visit at least one distillery.

In addition to those on the Trail, some other distilleries also have visitor centres.

<doc id="173473" wikidata="Q956420" url="?curid=173473" title="Swedes (tribe)">
<text>The Swedes (; Old Norse: &quot;svíar,&quot; ) were a North Germanic tribe who inhabited Svealand (&quot;land of the Swedes&quot;) in central Sweden. Along with Geats and Gutes, they were one of the progenitor groups of modern Swedes. They had their tribal centre in Gamla Uppsala.

The Roman historian Tacitus was the first to write about the tribe in his &quot;Germania&quot; from AD 98, referring to them as the &quot;Suiones&quot;. Locally, they are possibly first mentioned by the Kylver Stone in the 4th century. Jordanes, in the 6th century, mentions &quot;Suehans&quot; and &quot;Suetidi&quot;. These names likely derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *, meaning &quot;one&#x27;s own&quot;. &quot;Beowulf&quot; mentions the Swedes around 1000 A.D.

According to early sources such as the sagas, especially &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, the Swedes were a powerful tribe whose kings claimed descendence from the god Freyr. During the Viking Age they constituted the basis of the Varangian subset, the Norsemen that travelled eastwards (see Rus&#x27; people).

The scholarly consensus is that the Rus&#x27; people originated in what is currently coastal eastern Sweden around the 8th century and that their name has the same origin as Roslagen in Sweden (with the older name being &quot;Roden&quot;). According to the prevalent theory, the name &quot;Rus&quot;″, like the Proto-Finnic name for Sweden (&quot;*roocci&quot;), is derived from an Old Norse term for &quot;the men who row&quot; (&quot;rods-&quot;) as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of Roslagen (&quot;Rus-law&quot;) or &quot;Roden&quot;, as it was known in earlier times. The name &quot;Rus″&quot; would then have the same origin as the Finnish and Estonian names for Sweden: &quot;Ruotsi&quot; and &quot;Rootsi&quot;.

Swedes made up the bulk of the Varangian Guard, this can be seen from the geographical location of the Varangian Runestones, of which almost all are found entirely in modern-day Sweden. Swedish men left to enlist in the Byzantine Varangian Guard in such numbers that a medieval Swedish law, Västgötalagen, from Västergötland declared no one could inherit while staying in &quot;Greece&quot;—the then Scandinavian term for the Byzantine Empire—to stop the emigration, especially as two other European courts simultaneously also recruited Scandinavians: Kievan Rus&#x27; c. 980–1060 and London 1018–1066 (the Þingalið).

==Name==

As the dominions of the Swedish kings grew, the name of the tribe could be applied more generally during the Middle Ages to include also the Geats. Later it again meant only the people inhabiting the original tribal lands in Svealand, rather than the Geats.
In modern North Germanic languages, the adjectival form &quot;svensk&quot; and its plural &quot;svenskar&quot; have replaced the name &quot;svear&quot; and is, today, used to denote all the citizens of Sweden. The distinction between the tribal Swedes (&quot;svear&quot;) and modern Swedes (&quot;svenskar&quot;) appears to have been in effect by the early 20th century, when &quot;Nordisk familjebok&quot; noted that &quot;svenskar&quot; had almost replaced &quot;svear&quot; as a name for the Swedish people. Although this distinction is convention in modern Norwegian, Danish and Swedish, Icelandic and Faroese do not distinguish between &quot;svíar&quot; (Icelandic) or &quot;sviar&quot; (Faroese) and &quot;sænskir&quot; (Icelandic) or &quot;svenskarar&quot; (Faroese) as words for modern Swedes.

==Etymology==
The form Suiones appears in the Roman author Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot;. A closely similar form, &quot;Swēon&quot;, is found in Old English and in the &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; of Adam of Bremen about the Hamburg-Bremen archbishops who are denoted &quot;Sueones&quot;.

Most scholars agree that &quot;Suiones&quot; and the attested Germanic forms of the name derive from the same Proto-Indo-European reflexive pronominal root, &quot;&quot;, as the Latin &quot;&quot;. The word must have meant &quot;one&#x27;s own (tribesmen)&quot;. In modern Scandinavian, the same root appears in words such as &quot;svåger&quot; (brother-in-law) and &quot;svägerska&quot; (sister-in-law). The same root and original meaning is found in the ethnonym of the Germanic tribe Suebi, preserved to this day in the name &quot;Schwaben&quot; (Swabia). The details of the phonetic development vary between different proposals.

Noréen (1920) proposed that &quot;Suiones&quot; is a Latin rendering of Proto-Germanic *&quot;Swihoniz&quot;, derived from the PIE root &quot;one&#x27;s own&quot;. The form *&quot;Swihoniz&quot; would in Ulfilas&#x27; Gothic become *&quot;Swaíhans&quot;, which later would result in the form &quot;Suehans&quot; that Jordanes mentioned as the name of the Swedes in &quot;Getica&quot;. Consequently, the Proto-Norse form would have been *&quot;Swehaniz&quot; which following the sound-changes in Old Norse resulted in Old West Norse &quot;Svíar&quot; and Old East Norse &quot;Swear&quot;. Currently, however, the root for &quot;one&#x27;s own&quot; is reconstructed as &quot;&quot; rather than , and that is the root identified for &quot;Suiones&quot; e.g. in Pokorny&#x27;s 1959 &quot;Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch&quot; and in the 2002 &quot;The Nordic languages: an international handbook of the history of the North Germanic languages&quot; edited by Oskar Bandle. *&quot;Swe&quot; is also the form cited by V. Friesen (1915), who regards the form Sviones as being originally an adjective, Proto-Germanic *&quot;Sweoniz&quot;, meaning &quot;kindred&quot;. Then the Gothic form would have been *&quot;Swians&quot; and the H in &quot;Suehans&quot; an epenthesis. The Proto-Norse form would then also have been *&quot;Sweoniz&quot;, which also would have resulted in the historically attested forms.
The name became part of a compound, which in Old West Norse was &quot;&quot; (&quot;the Svear people&#x27;&quot;, in Old East Norse &quot;Sweþiuð&quot; and in Old English &quot;Sweoðeod&quot;. This compound appears on runestones in the locatives &quot;i suiþiuþu&quot; (Runestones Sö Fv1948;289, Aspa Löt, and Sö 140 in Södermanland), &quot;a suiþiuþu&quot; (Runestone DR 344, Simris, Scania) and &quot;o suoþiauþu&quot; (Runestone DR 216, Tirsted, Lolland). A 13th century Danish source in &quot;Scriptores rerum danicarum&quot; mentions a place called &quot;litlæ swethiuthæ&quot;, which is probably the islet &quot;Sverige&quot; (Sweden) in Saltsjön in eastern Stockholm. The earliest instance, however, appears to be &quot;Suetidi&quot; in Jordanes&#x27; &quot;Getica&quot; (6th century).

The name &quot;Swethiuth&quot; and its different forms gave rise to the different Latin names for Sweden, &quot;Suethia&quot;, &quot;Suetia&quot; and &quot;Suecia&quot; as well as the modern English name for the country.

A second compound was &quot;Svíariki&quot;, or &quot;Sweorice&quot; in Old English, which meant &quot;the realm of the Suiones&quot;.

==Location==

Their primary dwellings were in eastern Svealand. Their territories also very early included the provinces of Västmanland, Södermanland and Närke in the Mälaren Valley which constituted a bay with a multitude of islands. The region is still one of the most fertile and densely populated regions of Scandinavia.

Their territories were called &quot;Svealand&quot; – &quot;Swede-land&quot; (&quot;The Voyage of Ohthere&quot; &quot;in&quot; &quot;Seven Books of History Against the Pagans&quot;: &quot;Swéoland&quot;), &quot;Suithiod&quot; – &quot;Swede-people&quot; (&quot;Beowulf&quot;: &quot;Sweoðeod&quot; [hence Sweden]), &quot;Svíaveldi&quot; or &quot;Svearike&quot; – &quot;Swede-realm&quot; (Beowulf: &quot;Swéorice&quot;). The political unification with the Geats in Götaland, a process that was not complete until the 13th century, is by some contemporary historians regarded as the birth of the Swedish kingdom, although the Swedish kingdom is named after them, &quot;Sverige&quot; in Swedish, from &quot;Svea rike&quot; – i.e. the kingdom of the Suiones.

The Æsir-cult centre in Gamla Uppsala, was the religious centre of the Swedes and where the Swedish king served as a priest during the sacrifices (blóts). Uppsala was also the centre of the Uppsala öd, the network of royal estates that financed the Swedish king and his court until the 13th century.

Some dispute whether the original domains of the Suiones really were in Uppsala, the heartland of Uppland, or if the term was used commonly for all tribes within Svealand, in the same way as old Norway&#x27;s different provinces were collectively referred to as &quot;Nortmanni&quot;.

==History==
The history of this tribe is shrouded in the mists of time. Besides Norse mythology and Germanic legend, only a few sources describe them and there is very little information.

===Romans===
There are two sources from the 1st century A.D that are quoted as referring to the Suiones. The first one is Pliny the Elder who said that the Romans had rounded the &quot;Cimbric peninsula&quot; (Jutland) where there was the &quot;Codanian Gulf&quot; (Kattegat?). In this gulf there were several large islands among which the most famous was &quot;Scatinavia&quot; (Scandinavia). He said that the size of the island was unknown but in a part of it dwelt a tribe named the &quot;Hillevionum gente&quot; (Nominative: &quot;Hillevionum gens&quot;), in 500 villages, and they considered their country to be a world of its own.

What strikes the commentators of this text is that this large tribe is unknown to posterity, unless it was a simple misspelling or misreading of &quot;Illa&quot; S&quot;vionum gente&quot;. This would make sense, since a large Scandinavian tribe named the &quot;Suiones&quot; was known to the Romans.

Tacitus wrote in AD 98 in that the Suiones were a powerful tribe (&quot;distinguished not merely for their arms and men, but for their powerful fleets&quot;) with ships that had a prow in both ends). He further mentions that the Suiones were much impressed by wealth, and the king&#x27;s thus was absolute. Further, the Suiones did not normally bear arms, and that the weapons were guarded by a slave.

After Tacitus&#x27; mention of the Suiones, the sources are silent about them until the 6th century as Scandinavia still was in pre-historic times. Some historians have maintained that it is not possible to claim that a continuous Swedish ethnicity reaches back to the Suiones of Tacitus. According to this view the referent of an ethnonym and the ethnic discourse have varied considerably during different phases of history.

===Jordanes===

In the 6th century Jordanes named two tribes he calls the Suehans and the Suetidi who lived in Scandza. They were famous for their fine horses. The Suehans were the suppliers of black fox skins for the Roman market. Then Jordanes names a tribe named Suetidi a name that is considered to refer to the Suiones as well and to be the Latin form of &quot;Sweþiuð&quot;. The Suetidi are said to be the tallest of men together with the Dani who were of the same stock.

===Anglo-Saxon sources===
There are three Anglo-Saxon sources that refer to the Swedes. The earliest one is probably the least known, since the mention is found in a long list of names of tribes and clans. It is the poem Widsith from the 6th or the 7th century:

On line 32, Ongentheow is mentioned and he reappears in the later epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, which was composed sometime in the 8th–11th centuries. The poem describes Swedish-Geatish wars, involving the Swedish kings Ongentheow, Ohthere, Onela and Eadgils who belonged to a royal dynasty called the &quot;Scylfings&quot;. These kings might have been historical as kings with similar names appear in Scandinavian sources as well (see list of legendary kings of Sweden). There appears to be a prophecy by Wiglaf in the end of the epic of new wars with the Swedes:

When more reliable historic sources appear the Geats are a subgroup of the Swedes.

The third Anglo-Saxon source is Alfred the Great&#x27;s translation of Orosius&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;, with appended tales of the voyages of Ohthere of Hålogaland and Wulfstan of Hedeby, who in the 9th century described the &quot;Sweon&quot; and &quot;Sweoland&quot;.

Ohthere&#x27;s account is limited to the following statement about Swēoland:
:Ðonne is toēmnes ðǣm lande sūðeweardum, on ōðre healfe ðæs mōres, Swēoland, oð ðæt land norðeweard; and toēmnes ðǣm lande norðeweardum, Cwēna land.

:Then Sweden is along the land to the south, on the other side of the moors, as far as the land to the north; and (then) Finland (is) along the land to the north.

Wulfstan only mentions a few regions as being subject to the Sweons (in translation):
:Then, after the land of the Burgundians, we had on our left the lands that have been called from the earliest times Blekingey, and Meore, and Eowland, and Gotland, all which territory is subject to the Sweons; and Weonodland was all the way on our right, as far as Weissel-mouth.

===Frankish sources===
The &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot; relate that a group of Norsemen, who called themselves &quot;Rhos&quot; visited Constantinople around the year 838. Fearful of returning home via the steppes, which would leave them vulnerable to attacks by the Hungarians, the &quot;Rhos&quot; travelled through Germany. They were questioned by Louis the Pious, Emperor of Francia, somewhere near Mainz. They informed the emperor that their leader was known as &quot;chacanus&quot; (the Latin for &quot;khagan&quot;) and that they lived in the north of Russia, but that they were Sueones.

===Adam of Bremen===
Dealing with Scandinavian affairs, Adam of Bremen relates in the 11th century &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; that the Sueones had many wives and were severe on crime. Hospitality was an important virtue and refusing a wanderer to stay over the night was considered shameful. The visitor was even taken to see the hosts&#x27; friends.

Their royal family is of an old dynasty (see House of Munsö), but the kings are dependent on the will of the people (the Thing). What has been decided by the people is more important than the will of the king unless the king&#x27;s opinion seems to be the most reasonable one, whereupon they usually obey. During peacetime, they feel to be the king&#x27;s equals but during wars they obey him blindly or whoever among them that he considers to be the most skillful. If the fortunes of war are against them they pray to one of their many gods (Æsir) and if they win they are grateful to him.

===Norse sagas===
The sagas are our foremost source for knowledge, and especially Snorri Sturluson, who is probably the one who has contributed the most (see for instance the Heimskringla). His descriptions sometimes concur with, sometimes contradict the previous sources.

<text>Axis &amp; Allies is a series of World War II strategy board games. The first version was initially published in 1981 and a second edition known colloquially as &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Classic&quot; was published in 1984. Played on a board depicting a Spring 1942 political map of Earth divided by territories, players take the role of one or more of the five major belligerents of World War II: the Axis powers of Germany and Japan; and the Allied powers of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Turns rotate among these belligerents, who control armies of playing pieces with which they attempt to capture enemy territories, with results determined by dice rolls. The object of the game is to win the war by capturing enough critical territories to gain the advantage over the enemy.

More than ten spinoff games have since been produced. Some of these editions are revised versions of the classic game, while others depict a specific theater, campaign or battle of World War II.

==Game development==
&quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; was designed by Larry Harris under the prototype name &quot;1942&quot; in the late 1970s. Harris partnered with a local Connecticut hobby shop, Citadel Game Store, to publish &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; in 1981 under the company name of Nova Game Designs, with the name originating from Pat Flory, the owner of the shop. The game was republished by the Milton Bradley Company in 1984 as part of the &quot;Gamemaster Series&quot; of board games. This edition has been retroactively named Axis &amp; Allies: Classic to differentiate it from later revisions. In 1996, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Classic&quot; was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design &quot;Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame&quot;. &quot;Games&quot; magazine also has inducted &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; into their buyers&#x27; guide Hall of Fame, an honor the magazine extends to &quot;games that have met or exceeded the highest standards of quality and play value and have been continuously in production for at least 10 years; i.e., classics.&quot; &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Classic&quot; was the most successful of the five &quot;Gamemaster Series&quot; of board games.

After acquiring Milton Bradley (1984) and Avalon Hill (1998), Hasbro transferred the &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Classic&quot; (1984) board game from the Milton Bradley division to the Avalon Hill division in 1999. In 1999, Hasbro acquired Wizards of the Coast. In 2004, Hasbro made Avalon Hill a subsidiary of Wizards of the Coast (WotC). In January 2021, after corporate restructuring, Avalon Hill became a subsidiary of Hasbro Gaming instead.

In 2022, Renegade Games Studios announced that they were entering a partnership with Hasbro which would include publishing future versions of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot;, among other games, as well as organizing an &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; world championship, and running an &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; website, starting in 2023. In 2023 the company released reprints of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: 1914&quot;, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies 1941&quot;, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies 1942&quot;, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies 1940 Europe&quot;, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies 1940 Pacific&quot;, and announced a reprint of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Guadalcanal&quot;, as well as two new, upcoming games: &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: North Africa&quot; and &quot;G.I. Joe: Battle for the Arctic Circle&quot;, a board game centered on the &quot;G. I. Joe&quot; line of action figures that will use the &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; game engine.

The mainline &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; game has gone through several revisions, most recently in 2018, and the game has several spinoffs. The series is currently published by Renegade Game Studios through a licensing agreement with Hasbro. There are a total of 15 board games in the &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; series (not counting second editions), 5 of which are currently supported by Renegade Game Studios. These are &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: 1914&quot;, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: 1941&quot;, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Europe 1940 2nd Edition&quot;, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Pacific 1940 2nd Edition&quot;, and &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Spring 1942 2nd Edition&quot;. Many out-of-print &quot;A&amp;A&quot; board games can be found on various auction websites.

==Gameplay==

In almost every edition of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot;, players play as the major belligerents of World War II: Germany, Japan, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The &quot;A&amp;A: 50th Anniversary Edition&quot; also includes Italy as the third Axis power and China as the fourth Allied power. The &quot;A&amp;A: Pacific 1940&quot; edition includes China and ANZAC (Australia and New Zealand armed forces). The &quot;A&amp;A: Europe 1940&quot; edition includes Italy and France. The players playing the Axis powers team up against those of the Allied powers usually in an attempt to conquer key territories, represented by regions on the map board. In earlier editions, this was done by capturing and holding until the end of a round of play certain territories where the opposing alliance&#x27;s capital cities are located. In later editions, this also included other territories on the map, where &quot;victory cities&quot; are located. 

Certain versions of Axis &amp; Allies have their own custom victory conditions. In the original Milton Bradley edition, &quot;A&amp;A: Classic&quot;, the Axis powers could also win by capturing and holding until the end of a round of play enough territories to gain an economic advantage. This &quot;economic victory&quot; was dropped in later editions of &quot;A&amp;A&quot;. In &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Pacific&quot;, Japan gains a point for every 10 IPCs they collect and can win the game if they collect 22 points. In &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: D-Day,&quot; the Allies need to control the three cities of Cherbourg, Caen, and Saint-Lo at the end of the 10th round, in &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Guadalcanal&quot;, victory is achieved by controlling airfields, and in &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Battle of the Bulge,&quot; the Germans need to control territories totaling up to 24 points before round 8.

Each round of a game involves each of the powers moving in turn according to a specified order; the game ends when either the Axis powers or the Allied powers complete their objectives. When each power takes its turn, they must first declare how they are to spend the IPCs (Industrial Production Certificates, an abstract currency representing one million man-hours of labor) in their possession: this may go into buying new units, improving units through research, or repairing damaged structures (in later editions). Players then declare any movements made that would result in combat, moving their pieces as appropriate, and after resolving combat, declaring any non-combat movements. At the end of the turn, players then place any units that were purchased at the beginning of the turn and collect IPCs based on all territories that they control at the end of their turn.

Combat is typically divided into several types; in all types, however, combat is divided into rounds. In each round, attackers and defenders roll dice to determine which of their units deal hits on the opposing side. If the number rolled is less than or equal to the unit&#x27;s attack or defense rating (where appropriate), the unit scores a hit on an opposing unit of the opponent&#x27;s choosing. During the round if an attacker defeats an enemy, the enemy can do a final retaliation before death, then be taken off the board. Some types of combat, such as strategic bombing raids, naval bombardment, and anti-aircraft defense, last only one round, though in others the attacker has the option of either continuing with another round of battle or retreating. Combat is fully resolved when either side loses all their units or the attackers choose to retreat. Though combat in different territories may be resolved in any order of the attackers choosing, combat in one territory may affect the number of combatants in another territory for later battles, as in the case of an amphibious assault or when attacking units withdraw.

==Spinoffs==
Due to the success of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Classic&quot;, as of 2021, there are thirteen spin-off games in the A&amp;A franchise using more or less the same mechanics. Four are updated or expanded versions of the original global A&amp;A: Classic game. An additional four games are theater games depicting combat in Europe or the Pacific, three games are local games of specific battles, one game takes place at the beginning of World War One and one features a global theater with the addition of a zombie apocalypse.

Additional games have also been published by other game designers with similar mechanics (some requiring components from an Axis &amp; Allies or similar game).

In 1999, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Europe&quot; was released, with slightly updated rules and a focus on the European theater of World War II; this was followed in 2001 by &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Pacific&quot; with similar rules and focus shifted to the Pacific theater. &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: D-Day&quot; (2004) focused on the Allied liberation of France. In 2004, the first major revision to the core game, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Revised&quot; was released, with elements taken from &quot;A&amp;A: Europe&quot; and &quot;A&amp;A: Pacific&quot;, also celebrating the 20th anniversary of Axis &amp; Allies itself. &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Battle of the Bulge&quot; (2006) focused on the Battle of the Bulge in Europe while &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Guadalcanal&quot; (2007) focused on the Solomon Islands Campaign in the Pacific. In 2008, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: 50th Anniversary Edition&quot; was released as one of the three games celebrating the 50th anniversary of its publisher, Avalon Hill (the other two games were &quot;Acquire&quot; and &quot;Diplomacy&quot;). This was followed by &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: 1942&quot; in 2009, the second major revision to the core game, with mechanics taken from the anniversary edition, also celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; itself. 

&quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Pacific 1940&quot; was released in December 2009 and &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Europe 1940&quot; was released in August of 2010. These games can be combined to form a Global game of World War II on a 175×80 cm (70&quot; × 32&quot;) map. All nine major powers of World War II, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and the ANZAC forces, are represented in the combined global game with unique units and colors. To streamline the game and correct balance issues, Global 1940 was revised and a new rule set was released on the Axis &amp; Allies forums in January 2011, later released as a second edition.

In 2012, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: 1941&quot; was released, containing a simplified map and rules to make it easier for beginners. In 2013, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: 1914&quot; was released, being the only non WWII centered Axis &amp; Allies game. The most recent Axis &amp; Allies game came out in October of 2018, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies &amp; Zombies&quot;, being an ahistorical version.

&quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; is not a strict historical wargame, due to its streamlining for ease of play and balancing so that both sides have a chance to win. For instance, the economic model is simplistic, with each territory producing a number of Industrial Production Certificates (IPCs) for the purchase of new units. For example, in the original Classic version, the game is supposed to start in the spring of 1942, but Japan is immediately in position to attack Hawaii again, while Germany is pressed well into the Soviet Union with an initially superior force. If the game were truer to history, the Axis empires would be at their climax in 1942, about to be pushed back by the Allies.

;Notes
==Units==
==Revisions==
Revisions would follow shortly after the game release as the rules didn&#x27;t always produce results which made sense in the context of the historical setting. For example, the abstraction of submarines fighting airplanes, initially had a restriction that the bomber was the only kind that could attack a sub. This was later revised so that all aircraft could attack submarines.

Although not the very first edition, the Milton Bradley release was the first to establish the well known game mechanics. There were three versions of the rules for the Milton Bradley games, though only the first two were included with the game itself. The third edition rules were exclusive to a computer video game &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; by Hasbro released in 1998 and &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Iron Blitz&quot; with minor additional rules released in 1999. The three editions differed by minor details. There is also a newer video game, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: RTS&quot; released in 2004, a departure from the original &quot;A&amp;A: Classic&quot; world map and introducing several tactical battle scenarios. The &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: RTS&quot; (2004) was followed by &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: RTS Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; (2006) with expanded strategy guide included.

The first major revision to the rules was designed by Larry Harris and Mike Selinker (who would later develop the board game &quot;Attack!&quot; based on the experiences learned working with Harris), who tried to address many of the Milton Bradley version&#x27;s shortcomings, including removing the Axis economic victory condition and the requirement of capturing enemy capitals in favor of &quot;victory cities&quot;, which has been used in every revision since. With victory cities, the Axis and Allies start with an equal number of victory cities (specially labeled territories), and strive to capture enough victory cities to gain a majority of them (the size of the majority being agreed upon by the players prior to the game). This allows players to play shorter or longer games, depending upon the number of victory cities a power must control in order to claim victory.

With each revision, there were also balance changes in order to make gameplay more dynamic: in the Milton Bradley edition, infantry were cheap units that tended to be most useful as defensive cannon fodder, due to their token attack and slightly better defense. This had led to many areas of the game board being heavily fortified, bogging game play down to a matter of who could build more infantry faster. To counteract this, the tank, whose defense ability was equal to infantry in the Milton Bradley release, had its defensive capabilities improved in the revised edition, so as to encourage players to use combined arms. Other balance changes included altering the costs of the various units, and altering the transport capacity: in the Milton Bradley edition, transports could carry only two infantry or one of any other land unit; later revisions had transports able to carry one infantry in addition to one of any other land unit.

The variety of land and sea units was increased by introducing artillery and destroyers from &quot;A&amp;A: Europe&quot; and &quot;A&amp;A: Pacific&quot; to &quot;A&amp;A: Revised&quot; edition. Artillery increased the effectiveness of infantry in attacks, while destroyers limited the usefulness of submarines and acted as a lower-cost substitute for the expensive battleship. Cruisers were introduced in &quot;A&amp;A: 50th Anniversary Edition&quot; to effectively split the destroyer&#x27;s many abilities. While destroyers continue to limit the usefulness of submarines, the stronger cruisers now act as lower cost battleships.

The game board itself was also reworked in each revision. The Milton Bradley classic release featured largely vibrant colors, while the revised version featured mainly darker tones. The 50th anniversary edition and 1942 edition has a more realistic terrain with only subtle hints of color to denote which power has initial control over a particular territory. The composition of territories was also slightly altered, for example, the number of territories between Berlin and Moscow had been increased for the revised edition, including adding many Soviet territories of strategic importance.

Strategic bombing was altered over the years. Until the revised edition, strategic bombing caused opposing players to lose the IPCs they had on hand. The 50th anniversary edition changed this so that industrial complexes were damaged instead. Damaged industrial complexes had less capacity to produce units and can be repaired at the cost of IPCs.

Later revisions have also included changes in research (which was generally not a worthwhile investment in the Milton Bradley edition due to its high cost and low probability of success) to have more of an effect, with mixed results, &quot;1942 edition&quot; eliminates research altogether. Another feature that was implemented but was later dropped was the revised edition&#x27;s &quot;National Advantages&quot;, which represented tactics and technologies used by a specific power during the war. For example, a British ability allowed the British player to delay their combat movement until the American player&#x27;s turn once per game, in order to have a coordinated attack.

Later editions had minor cosmetic changes in the playing pieces. In the Milton Bradley version, only the infantry pieces were unique to each power in appearance. Unique units was later expanded to include nearly every unit in later editions. Compared to the generic fighters of the Milton Bradley release, the Supermarine Spitfire was used in later editions to represent British fighters, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero was used to represent Japanese fighters, while two different fighters (the Grumman F4F Wildcat and the Lockheed P-38 Lightning) represented American fighters. The color scheme to associate units with powers was also standardized across all &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; series games, based on the colors used in &quot;A&amp;A: Europe&quot; and &quot;A&amp;A: Pacific&quot;, and is different from those used in the Milton Bradley release.

In 2009, an updated version of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Pacific&quot; was released, titled &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Pacific 1940&quot;. The 10th board game in the &quot;A&amp;A&quot; series, &quot;A&amp;AP 1940&quot; introduced the ANZAC forces as a playable power, along with two new unit types, mechanized infantry and tactical bombers.

In 2010, an updated version of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Europe&quot; was released, titled &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Europe 1940&quot;. &quot;A&amp;AE 1940&quot; introduced France as a playable power. Mechanized infantry and tactical bomber units continue to appear after debuting in &quot;A&amp;A Pac40&quot;. Italy also appears as a playable power in &quot;A&amp;AE 1940&quot; after debuting in &quot;A&amp;A 50&quot;. In &quot;A&amp;AE 1940&quot; and &quot;A&amp;AP 1940&quot; aircraft carriers and battleships are capital ships that are damaged with 1 hit and sunk with 2 hits. Damaged CVs &amp; BBs can be repaired by moving the damaged CV or BB to a friendly naval base for repairs. Special rules apply for fighters and tactical bombers if a CV is damaged. &quot;A&amp;AE 1940&quot; is the 11th &quot;A&amp;A&quot; boardgame in the series. &quot;A&amp;AE 1940&quot; and &quot;A&amp;AP 1940&quot; are designed to be played as separate games or may be combined into one game to create a 2-6 player global 1940 scenario, complete with separate set up and national objectives. The combined &quot;A&amp;AE 1940&quot; and &quot;A&amp;AP 1940&quot; maps measure 175x80 cm (70&quot; x 32&quot;). All 9 major powers of World War II are represented with unique unit pieces and their own unique color.

==Board games==
In addition to designing the board games, Larry Harris had also designed &quot;A&amp;A: Europe&quot; and &quot;A&amp;A: Pacific&quot;, which had the core mechanics of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; adapted for a specific theater. This, in turn, served as the catalyst for the revised edition. Although there were preliminary plans for a variant that allowed players to combine &quot;Europe&quot; and &quot;Pacific&quot; together, it had never been published. Larry Harris has announced two completely new editions, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies Pacific 1940&quot; released in December 2009 and &quot;Axis &amp; Allies Europe 1940&quot; released in Summer 2010, which will also include a variant that combines both games together.

Other Harris-designed &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; games were more tactical in nature, and focused on individual battles in specified, small areas: &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: D-Day&quot; (2004) focused on the Allied liberation of France, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Battle of the Bulge&quot; (2006) focused on the Battle of the Bulge, while &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Guadalcanal&quot; (2007) focused on the Solomon Islands Campaign. Though these games retained many of the traditional mechanics, some were specific to the particular game.

==Reception==
Warren Spector reviewed the 1984 Milton Bradley version of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer&quot; No. 72. Spector commented that &quot;Overall, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; is a winner. It&#x27;s simple to learn, easy to play, requires lots of thought, and has immense replay value (since each country has unique goals, resources, and geography).&quot;

In a retrospective review in Issue 4 of &quot;Simulacrum&quot;, Joe Scoleri noted, &quot;Sometimes seen as the bane of &#x27;serious&#x27; wargamers, this design has stood the test of time and the Milton Bradley re-release served to introduce a whole new generation to wargaming. While it won&#x27;t please the &quot;Advanced Third Reich&quot; crowd, it is an entertaining game nonetheless.&quot;

&quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; was declared the best-selling physical wargame in August 1996, having eclipsed the 275,000 copies sold by &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot;, the second-highest seller in the genre. It went on to sell roughly 1 million copies by 1998.

In a review of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, M Harold Page said &quot;Its big advantage is that its historical setting can draw in less geeky players. There are, however, rules to learn and master.&quot;

==Video games==
Two video games based on the official board game were released in 1998 and 2004. &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; by Hasbro released in 1998. It features a departure from the original &quot;A&amp;A: Classic&quot; world map and introduces several tactical battlefield scenarios. &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Iron Blitz&quot; released as an updated version in 1999 with minor additional rules and features marines, paratroopers, destroyers, and kamikazes. &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: RTS&quot; by TimeGate Studios released in 2004 and is primarily based on real-time strategy gameplay. &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: RTS Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; released as an expanded version in 2006. The game became TimeGate&#x27;s best-selling game.

In 2008, Wizards of the Coast created an online version of Axis &amp; Allies as part of their Gleemax game site. When Gleemax was cancelled the game found its way to the GameTable Online game site, who programmed the game for Wizards of the Coast. The initial version was based on the 2004 Revised edition. In September 2010 GameTable Online has developed a new version based on the Axis &amp; Allies: 1942 set. Game Table Online is no longer available, as it shut down in 2015. Axis and Allies and many different variants can currently be played via the TripleA website.

&quot;TripleA&quot; is an open source adaptation of Axis &amp; Allies, available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. It allows users to play single player against an AI, or hot-seat against other friends in the same room. It allows multiplayer on an online lobby, and also over email (PBEM) and network connections. Originally released in 2002, &quot;TripleA&quot; is now on stable version 2.2 as of year 2020. Version 2.2 is able to play the major versions of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Classic&quot;, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies:Revised&quot;, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: 50th Anniversary Edition&quot;, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Spring 1942&quot;. It also hosts many fan created maps, which have similar rules to Axis &amp; Allies, but use a different setup or a different map or era altogether, for example, historical scenarios like a map based on Napoleon&#x27;s conquests, Sci-Fi maps and Fantasy maps. 

In 2019, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies 1942 Online&quot; was published by Beamdog.

==Miniature games==
In 2005, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies Miniatures&quot; was released as the series&#x27; first foray into miniature gaming. This was followed up by &quot;Axis &amp; Allies Naval Miniatures: War at Sea&quot;, with &quot;Axis &amp; Allies Air Force Miniatures: Angels Twenty&quot; being released in October, 2011. There have been several additional &quot;A&amp;A Miniatures&quot; booster set releases. Currently there are 20 countries represented in &quot;A&amp;A Miniatures&quot;.

<text>Waiblingen (; Swabian: &quot;Woeblinge&quot;) is a town in the southwest of Germany, located in the center of the densely populated Stuttgart region, directly neighboring Stuttgart. It is the capital and largest city of the Rems-Murr district. , Waiblingen had 55,449 inhabitants (27,334 men and 28,115 women).

==History==
Waiblingen was first mentioned in Carolingian documents in 885 at the time of Charles the Fat. It received its town charter in 1250.

Waiblingen was the property of the Salian kings, from whom the Hohenstaufen dukes and kings inherited it. It is intimately tied to the conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines in the 12th and 13th century. During the Siege of Weinsberg in 1140, the Hohenstaufens of Swabia (led by Conrad III of Germany) used &quot;Wibellingen&quot; - a version of the town name - as their rallying cry; &quot;Wibellingen&quot; subsequently became Ghibellino in Italian.

The town was almost completely destroyed in 1634 during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, when Imperial and Spanish troops sacked the city after the Battle of Nördlingen. Fires raged for more than a week, and most of Waiblingen&#x27;s citizens were killed or had to flee. Rebuilding only began four years after this catastrophe; the existing old central part of the town dates back to the years between 1640 and 1700. Its fortifications are now well restored.

<text>The Magellanic Clouds (&quot;Magellanic system&quot; or &quot;Nubeculae Magellani&quot;) are two irregular dwarf galaxies in the southern celestial hemisphere. Orbiting the Milky Way galaxy, these satellite galaxies are members of the Local Group. Because both show signs of a bar structure, they are often reclassified as Magellanic spiral galaxies.

The two galaxies are the following:
* Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), about away
* Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), about away

The Magellanic clouds are visible to the unaided eye from the Southern Hemisphere, but cannot be observed from the most northern latitudes.

== History ==
An early possible mention of the Large Magellanic Cloud is in petroglyphs and rock drawings found in Chile. They may be the objects mentioned by the polymath Ibn Qutaybah (d. 889 CE), in his book on &quot;Al-Anwā̵’&quot; (the stations of the Moon in pre-Islamic Arabian culture):

وأسفل من سهيل قدما سهيل . وفى مجرى قدمى سهيل، من خلفهما كواكب زهر كبار، لا ترى بالعراق، يسميها أهل تهامة الأعبار
And below Canopus, there are the feet of Canopus, and on their extension, behind them bright big stars, not seen in Iraq, the people of Tihama call them &quot;al-a‘bār&quot;.

Later Al Sufi, a professional astronomer, in 964 CE, in his &quot;Book of Fixed Stars&quot;, mentioned the same quote, but with a different spelling. Under Argo Navis, he quoted that &quot;unnamed others have claimed that beneath Canopus there are two stars known as the &#x27;feet of Canopus&#x27;, and beneath those there are bright white stars that are unseen in Iraq nor Najd, and that the inhabitants of Tihama call them &quot;al-Baqar&quot; [cows], and Ptolemy did not mention any of this so we [Al-Sufi] do not know if this is true or false.&quot; Both Ibn Qutaybah and Al-Sufi were probably quoting from the former&#x27;s contemporary (and compatriot) and famed scientist Abu Hanifa Dinawari&#x27;s mostly lost work on Anwaa. Abu Hanifa was probably quoting earlier sources, which may be just travelers stories, and hence Al-Sufi&#x27;s comments about their veracity.

In Europe, the Clouds were reported by 16th century Italian authors Peter Martyr d&#x27;Anghiera and Andrea Corsali, both based on Portuguese voyages. Subsequently, they were reported by Antonio Pigafetta, who accompanied the expedition of Ferdinand Magellan on its circumnavigation of the world in 1519–1522. However, naming the clouds after Magellan did not become widespread until much later. In Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; they are designated as &quot;nubecula major&quot; and &quot;nubecula minor&quot;. In the 1756 star map of the French astronomer Lacaille, they are designated as &quot;le Grand Nuage&quot; and &quot;le Petit Nuage&quot; (&quot;the Large Cloud&quot; and &quot;the Small Cloud&quot;). John Herschel studied the Magellanic Clouds from South Africa, writing an 1847 report detailing 919 objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud and 244 objects in the Small Magellanic Cloud. In 1867 Cleveland Abbe suggested that they were separate satellites of the Milky Way. Distances were first estimated by Ejnar Hertzsprung in 1913 using 1912 measurements of Cepheid variables in the SMC by Henrietta Leavitt. Recalibration of the Cepheid scales allowed Harlow Shapley to refine the measurement, and these were again revised in 1952 following further research. , some astronomers believe the Magellanic Clouds should be renamed, alleging that Magellan was a murderer and neither an astronomer nor the discoverer of the dwarf galaxies.

== Characteristics ==
The Large Magellanic Cloud and its neighbour and relative, the Small Magellanic Cloud, are conspicuous objects in the southern hemisphere, looking like separated pieces of the Milky Way to the naked eye. Roughly 21° apart in the night sky, the true distance between them is roughly 75,000 light-years. Until the discovery of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy in 1994, they were the closest known galaxies to our own. The LMC lies about 160,000 light years away, while the SMC is around 200,000. The LMC is about 70% larger than the diameter of the SMC (32,200 ly and 18,900 ly respectively). For comparison, the Milky Way is about 87,400 ly across.

The total mass of these two galaxies is uncertain. Only a fraction of their gas seems to have coalesced into stars and they probably both have large dark matter halos. One recent estimate of the total mass of the LMC is about 1/10 that of the Milky Way. That would make the LMC rather a large galaxy in the current observable universe. Since the sizes of relatively nearby galaxies are highly skewed, the average mass can be a misleading statistic. In terms of rank, the LMC appears to be the fourth most massive member of over 50 galaxies in the local group. Suggesting that the Magellanic cloud system is historically not a part of the Milky Way is evidence that the SMC has been in orbit about the LMC for a very long time. The Magellanic system seems most similar to the distinct NGC 3109 system, which is on the edge of the Local Group.

Astronomers have long assumed that the Magellanic Clouds have orbited the Milky Way at approximately their current distances, but evidence suggests that it is rare for them to come as close to the Milky Way as they are now. Observation and theoretical evidence suggest that the Magellanic Clouds have both been greatly distorted by tidal interaction with the Milky Way as they travel close to it. The LMC maintains a very clear spiral structure in radio-telescope images of neutral hydrogen. Streams of neutral hydrogen connect them to the Milky Way and to each other, and both resemble disrupted barred spiral galaxies. Their gravity has affected the Milky Way as well, distorting the outer parts of the galactic disk.

Aside from their different structure and lower mass, they differ from our galaxy in two major ways. They are gas-rich; a higher fraction of their mass is hydrogen and helium compared to the Milky Way. They are also more metal-poor than the Milky Way; the youngest stars in the LMC and SMC have a metallicity of 0.5 and 0.25 times solar, respectively. Both are noted for their nebulae and young stellar populations, but as in our own galaxy their stars range from the very young to the very old, indicating a long stellar formation history.

The Large Magellanic Cloud was the host galaxy to a supernova (SN 1987A), the brightest observed in over four centuries.

Measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope, announced in 2006, suggest the Magellanic Clouds may be moving too fast to be long term companions of the Milky Way. If they are in orbit, that orbit takes at least 4 billion years. They are possibly on a first approach and we are witnessing the start of a galactic merger that may overlap with the Milky Way&#x27;s expected merger with the Andromeda Galaxy (and perhaps the Triangulum Galaxy) in the future.

In 2019, astronomers discovered the young star cluster Price-Whelan 1 using &quot;Gaia&quot; data. The star cluster has a low metallicity and belongs to the leading arm of the Magellanic Clouds. The existence of this star cluster suggests that the leading arm of the Magellanic Clouds is 90,000 light-years away from the Milky Way—closer than previously thought.

== Mini Magellanic Cloud (MMC) ==
Astrophysicists D. S. Mathewson, V. L. Ford and N. Visvanathan proposed that the SMC may in fact be split in two, with a smaller section of this galaxy behind the main part of the SMC (as seen from Earth&#x27;s perspective), and separated by about 30,000 light years. They suggest the reason for this is due to a past interaction with the LMC splitting the SMC, and that the two sections are still moving apart. They have dubbed this smaller remnant the Mini Magellanic Cloud. This hypothesis was confirmed in 2023. The part of the SMC which is closer to Earth lies 196,000 light-years (60 kiloparsecs) away, whereas the farther part lies 215,000 light-years (66 kiloparsecs) away.

<text>Power Rangers is an media franchise created by Haim Saban, Shuki Levy and Shotaro Ishinomori and built around a live-action superhero television series, based on Japanese tokusatsu franchise &quot;Super Sentai&quot; and currently owned by American toy and entertainment company Hasbro through a dedicated subsidiary, SCG Power Rangers LLC. It was first produced in 1993 by Saban Entertainment (later BVS Entertainment), which Saban sold to the Walt Disney Company and then brought back under his now-defunct successor company Saban Brands within his current company, Saban Capital Group. The &quot;Power Rangers&quot; television series takes much of its footage from the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; television series produced by Toei Company. The first &quot;Power Rangers&quot; entry, &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, debuted on August 28, 1993, and helped launch the Fox Kids programming block of the 1990s, during which it catapulted into popular culture along with a line of action figures and other toys by Bandai. By 2001, the media franchise had generated over $6 billion in toy sales.

Despite initial criticism that its action violence targeted child audiences, the franchise has been commercially successful. As of 2023, &quot;Power Rangers&quot; consists of 30 television seasons of 22 different themed series, three theatrical films released in 1995, 1997, and 2017 and a television special released in 2023.

In 2018, Hasbro was named the new master toy licensee. Shortly afterwards, Saban Brands and Hasbro announced that the latter would acquire the franchise and the rest of the former&#x27;s entertainment assets in a $522 million deal, with the first products from Hasbro becoming available in early 2019. In 2024, Hasbro announced a global licensing agreement with Playmates Toys to produce new additional cross-category &quot;Power Rangers&quot; toys in 2025.

Since &quot;Power Rangers&quot; derives most of its footage from the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series, it features many hallmarks that distinguish it from other superhero series. Each series revolves around a team of youths recruited and trained by a mentor to morph into the eponymous Power Rangers, able to use special powers and pilot immense assault machines, called Zords, to overcome the periodic antagonists. In the original series &quot;Mighty Morphin&quot;, the wizard Zordon recruits &quot;teenagers with attitude&quot; against Rita Repulsa.

When &quot;morphed,&quot; the rangers become powerful superheroes wearing color-coded skin-tight spandex suits and helmets with opaque visors; identical except in individual rangers&#x27; color, helmet design, and minor styling such as incorporating a skirt. Morphed Rangers generally possess enhanced strength, durability, agility and combat prowess. Some possess superhuman or psychic abilities such as super-speed, element manipulation, extra-sensory perception or invisibility. In addition, each individual ranger has a unique weapon, as well as common weaponry used for ground fighting. 

Rangers teams operate in teams of three to five, with more Rangers joining the team later. Each team of Rangers, with a few exceptions, obeys a general set of conventions, outlined at the beginning of &quot;Mighty Morphin&quot; and implied by mentors throughout many of the other series: Power Rangers may not use their Ranger powers for personal gain or for escalating a fight (unless the enemy does so), nor may the Power Rangers disclose their identities to the general public. The penalty for disobeying these rules is the loss of their power.

As in &quot;Super Sentai&quot;, the color palette of each &quot;Power Rangers&quot; team changes every series. Only Red and Blue appear in every Ranger team. Other colors and designations also appear throughout the series. A Rangers&#x27; color designation also influences their wardrobe throughout the series: civilian clothing often matches Ranger color.

==History==

===Adapting the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series===
The idea of adapting Sentai series for America emerged in the late 1970s after the agreement between Toei Company and Marvel Comics to exchange concepts to adapt them to their respective audiences. Toei, with Marvel Productions, created the Japanese &quot;Spider-Man&quot; television series, and produced three Super Sentai series, which had great success in Japan. Marvel and Stan Lee tried to sell the &quot;Sun Vulcan&quot; series to American television stations including HBO, but found no buyers and the agreement ended.

Several years later, another idea to adapt &quot;Super Sentai&quot; began in the 1980s when Haim Saban made a business trip to Japan, in which, during his stay at the hotel, the only thing that was being transmitted on his television was the Japanese series &quot;Choudenshi Bioman&quot;. At the time, Saban was fascinated by the concept of five people masked in spandex suits fighting monsters, so in 1985, he produced the pilot episode of &quot;Bio-Man&quot;, an American adaptation of &quot;Choudenshi Bioman&quot;, which was rejected by several of the largest American television stations. His idea only took off in 1992, as Saban came to Fox Kids, whose president Margaret Loesch had previously helmed Marvel Productions and thus was familiar with &quot;Super Sentai&quot;.

Production of &quot;Power Rangers&quot; episodes involves extensive localization of and revision of original &quot;Super Sentai&quot; source material to incorporate American culture and conform to American television standards. Rather than making an English dub or translation of the Japanese footage, &quot;Power Rangers&quot; programs consist of scenes featuring English-speaking actors spliced with scenes featuring either Japanese actors dubbed into English or the action scenes from the Super Sentai Series featuring the Rangers fighting monsters or the giant robot (Zord and Megazord) battles with English dubbing. In some series, original fight scenes are filmed to incorporate characters or items unique to the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; production.

Like many of Saban Entertainment previous ventures in localizing Japanese television for a Western audience, the plot, character names, and other names usually differ greatly from the source footage, though a few seasons have stayed close to the story of the original Super Sentai season. The American arm of Bandai, who co-produced the Sentai shows and manufactured its toys, worked with the adaptation of the Japanese names.

A brainstorming among executives led to &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, and for the specific show that would be made, &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, evoking the transformation sequences. The meeting also brought up the term &quot;Zord&quot; for the giant robots, to invoke both the sword that the Megazord carried, and the dinosaurs that were the team&#x27;s theme.

Along with adapting the villains from the Super Sentai counterparts, most &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series also feature villains with no Sentai counterpart. Generally, the primary antagonist of a &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series (for example, Lord Zedd, Divatox, etc.) are not adapted from the Sentai. Exceptions to this includes &quot;Zeo&quot;, &quot;Lightspeed Rescue&quot; and a few others which only use villains adapted from the Japanese shows.

The franchise began with &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; (an American adaptation of the 1992 Japanese Super Sentai Series, &quot;Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger&quot;), which began broadcasting as part of the Fox Broadcasting Company&#x27;s Fox Kids programming block.

In honour of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;″ broadcast premiere, Hasbro announced &quot;National &quot;Power Rangers&quot; Day&quot; to be celebrated annually on August 28, 2018.

===Broadcast and production===
====1993–2010====
Saban Entertainment produced and distributed &quot;Power Rangers&quot; from 1993 until the end of 2001, with Fox Kids broadcasting the series in the United States until the Fall of 2002. The Walt Disney Company acquired the franchise as part of a larger buyout of Fox Family Worldwide that took place in 2001. Fox Family Worldwide subsequently became ABC Family Worldwide Inc. This buyout also saw Saban Entertainment become BVS Entertainment in 2002, from News Corporation, Fox&#x27;s parent company, and Haim Saban.

From September 2002, &quot;Power Rangers&quot; had aired on various Disney-owned networks, including the ABC Kids program block on ABC, the ABC Family and Toon Disney cable networks, and Jetix-branded outlets worldwide. Disney moved production of the franchise from Los Angeles to Studio West in New Zealand after &quot;Wild Force&quot; ended. Several ABC affiliate broadcasting groups, including Hearst Television, declined to air the series due to the lack of FCC-compliant educational and informational content.

2008&#x27;s &quot;Power Rangers Jungle Fury&quot; was originally set to be the final season, but due to obligations with Bandai, Disney would produce 2009&#x27;s &quot;Power Rangers RPM.&quot; An article in &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; published on March 7, 2009, identified &quot;RPM&quot; as the last season of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; run. Production manager Sally Campbell stated in an interview, &quot;...at this stage we will not be shooting another season.&quot; A September 1, 2009, revision to &quot;Disney A to Z: The Official Encyclopedia&quot; by Disney&#x27;s head archivist Dave Smith states that &quot;production of new episodes [of &quot;Power Rangers&quot;] ceased in 2009&quot;. Production of &quot;Power Rangers&quot; ceased and the series by BVS Entertainment, &quot;RPM&quot;, ended on December 26, 2009.

On October 1, 2009, Bandai released a press release stating that Disney would re-broadcast &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; in January 2010 on ABC Kids in lieu of producing a new season. A new toy line accompanied the broadcast and appeared in stores in the later part of 2009.

====2011–2021====
On May 12, 2010, Haim Saban bought back the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise from Disney for $43 million and announced plans to produce a new season of the television series. Beginning with the eighteenth season, &quot;Samurai&quot; (using footage from the 2009 &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series, &quot;Samurai Sentai Shinkenger&quot;) the series would be produced under Saban Capital Group&#x27;s new Saban Brands subsidiary and premiere on Nickelodeon on February 7, 2011. Reruns of previous seasons and episodes would also begin airing on sister channel Nicktoons later that year. In addition to &quot;Samurai&quot;, Saban announced plans to make a new &quot;Power Rangers&quot; film.

On July 2, 2012, Saban Brands announced that would it launch a new Saturday morning cartoon block on The CW, called Vortexx, on August 25, 2012, with reruns of &quot;Power Rangers Lost Galaxy&quot; to air on the block.

On October 1, 2013, Saban Brands announced that it had extended agreements for the franchise with Nickelodeon and Bandai America Incorporated through 2016. In January 2016, Saban and Nickelodeon extended their broadcast partnership through 2018. In February 2018, it was announced that &quot;Power Rangers&quot; would continue airing on Nickelodeon through 2021. That same month, Saban Brands appointed Hasbro as the global master toy licensee for &quot;Power Rangers&quot; in April 2019 with a future option to purchase the franchise. On May 1, 2018, Saban would agree to sell &quot;Power Rangers&quot; and other entertainment assets to Hasbro for US$522 million in cash and stock. The Saban Brands subsidiary ended operations upon the closure of the deal on July 2, 2018.

The twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh seasons, &quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot;, would be produced by Hasbro&#x27;s Allspark studio. Beginning with the twenty-eighth season, &quot;Power Rangers Dino Fury&quot;, the series is being produced by Entertainment One (which was acquired by Hasbro on December 30, 2019, and merged with Allspark in October 2020).

====2021–2023====
In late April 2021, actor Chance Perez announced in an interview that the second season of &quot;Power Rangers Dino Fury&quot; (the twenty-ninth season overall) would premiere on Netflix in 2022; making it the first season of the series to premiere exclusively online through a streaming service. Meanwhile, new episodes of the series moved to the streaming service on June 15, 2021.

On June 14, 2022, it was announced that Jenny Klein would serve as showrunner for a &quot;Power Rangers&quot; television series that is being developed by Entertainment One for Netflix. It was reported that she will work alongside Jonathan Entwistle, who is set to direct a second attempt at a film reboot (unrelated to the 2017 film reboot). Entwistle stated on his now-deleted Twitter page that the series he and Klein are developing was set to be part of the same canon as the upcoming &quot;Power Rangers&quot; film, which he described as a &quot;cinematic universe&quot;. In June 2024, it was reported that none of those plans would move forward at Netflix; Hasbro Entertainment stated they were seeking a new partner to take the series in a new creative direction. No timeline was immediately announced.

On June 28, 2023, Hasbro announced that &quot;Power Rangers Cosmic Fury&quot; would be the final season to be filmed in New Zealand.

====2024–present====
In December 2024, reports surfaced that a new &quot;Power Rangers&quot; reboot film was being developed by Paramount Pictures in partnership with Hasbro.

==Television series==

The first six seasons (beginning with &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; and ending with &quot;In Space&quot;) followed an overarching, evolving storyline. The second season began the annual tradition of the Rangers acquiring new Zords to battle enemies while the core suits from the first season were used, except for that of the White Ranger. With the fourth season, &quot;Zeo&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers&quot; began following the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series&#x27; practice of annual Ranger suit changes.

Although the seventh season, &quot;Lost Galaxy&quot;, had ties with the preceding season, it was otherwise the first season to follow a self-contained story, as would later seasons of the show up until the seventeenth, &quot;RPM&quot;. The season also began the tradition of team-up episodes featuring Rangers, villains, and other characters from past seasons. Beginning with the eighteenth season, &quot;Samurai&quot;, the show returned to a multi-season format similar to &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, with self-contained storylines told across two seasons each. The thirtieth season, &quot;Cosmic Fury&quot;, is a continuation of &quot;Dino Fury&quot;″s story.

According to executive producer Simon Bennett, &quot;Cosmic Fury&quot; was planned to be the final season set within the canon established since &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,&quot; with Hasbro instead opting for a franchise reboot; this reboot was originally set to be produced in partnership with Netflix; however, in 2024, Hasbro and Netflix ended their partnership, with the former opting to search for a new creative partner. In December of 2024, reports surfaced that Paramount would be partnering with Hasbro to produce future &quot;Power Rangers&quot; content. 

==Feature films==
&quot;Power Rangers&quot; has been adapted into three theatrical motion pictures. The first two are distributed by 20th Century Fox, while the third film was released in 2017 by Lionsgate.

In May 2014, Saban Brands and Lionsgate announced that they are planning to produce a new &quot;Power Rangers&quot; feature film. The film, titled simply &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, was released on March 24, 2017 to mixed reviews and a low performance at the box office. A fourth &quot;Power Rangers&quot; film was announced to be developed by Entertainment One and Netflix. On July 11, 2019, during a Reddit AMA, Dacre Montgomery revealed that the studio had plans to produce a second reboot, without him and the rest of the cast and the director returning. On December 13, 2019, it was reported that Jonathan Entwistle is in early talks to direct the reboot, with Patrick Burleigh being set to write the screenplay. The plot will reportedly involve time travel and will be set in the 1990s. These plans were scuttled in 2024, although, in December of the same year, reports surfaced that a new reboot film was being developed by Paramount Pictures in conjunction with Hasbro.

On April 19, 2023, a special film titled &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot; was released. It serves to commemorate the 30th anniversary of both Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the Power Rangers franchise.

==Recurring cast and characters==


==Distribution==
&quot;Power Rangers&quot; has long had success in international markets and continues to air in many countries. As of 2006, &quot;Power Rangers&quot; aired at least 65 times a week in more than 40 worldwide markets. Many markets carry or have carried the series on their respective Fox or later Jetix/Disney XD channels or have syndicated the program on regional children&#x27;s channels or blocks, either dubbed into the local language or broadcast in the original English. Since the 2010 acquisition by Saban Brands, international television distribution rights for Power Rangers have been managed by MarVista Entertainment until early-2019.

Broadcast in East Asian territories has been treated differently from in other international markets due to the prevalence and familiarity of &#x27;the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; brand originating in Japan. &quot;Power Rangers&quot; was briefly banned in Malaysia for supposedly encouraging the use of drugs because it contained the word &quot;Morphin&#x27;&quot; in its title, which could be associated with morphine. The show eventually aired without the offending word. In Japan, many &quot;Power Rangers&quot; television seasons and films were dubbed into Japanese for television and video with the voice actors often pulled from past &quot;Super Sentai&quot; casts, leading to the English-dubbed action sequences being &quot;re-dubbed&quot; or &quot;restored&quot; back to Japanese as well. &quot;Power Rangers Mystic Force&quot; is the latest season to be broadcast in Japan on Toei Channel in January 2014, with another cast voicing the American counterparts. After broadcast of &quot;Power Rangers&quot; ended in South Korea with &quot;Wild Force&quot;, Bandai of Korea started airing dubbed &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series under the &quot;파워레인저&quot; &quot;(Power Ranger)&quot; brand on JEI TV. Some seasons of &quot;Super Sentai&quot; broadcast in South Korea have similarly named titles as their American counterparts, such as &quot;Power Ranger Dino Thunder&quot; for &quot;Abaranger&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Power Ranger S.P.D.&quot; in place of &quot;Dekaranger&quot;.

Subsequent seasons and episodes of the program also made their appearances in the iTunes Store, but , &quot;&quot; is the only Power Rangers film available. In 2012, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Season 1 volumes 1 &amp; 2 were released on iTunes to coincide with the DVD releases. As of February 2013, all 3 seasons of &quot;MMPR&quot; were released on iTunes.

On June 15, 2011, all episodes of &quot;Power Rangers&quot; from &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Season 1&quot; to &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers re-version&quot; were made available for instant streaming on Netflix.

In 2021, all episodes of &quot;Power Rangers&quot; (excluding &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (season 1)&quot; to &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers re-version&quot; and &quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot;) were removed from Netflix.

==Toys==
On February 15, 2018, Saban Brands announced that their 25-year partnership with Bandai would end in 2019. The next day, it was confirmed that Hasbro would be the new &quot;global master toy licensee&quot; for the franchise starting in April 2019, with a future option for Hasbro to buy the entire franchise. Hasbro paid $22.25 million upon the toy contract&#x27;s closure. When they acquired the franchise as a whole later that year, that amount was credited against the purchase price paid to Saban for the series and related assets.

<text>Mighty Power Rangers (MMPR) is an American superhero television series that premiered on August 28, 1993, on the Fox Kids programming block. It is the first entry of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise, and became a 1990s pop culture phenomenon along with a large line of toys, action figures, and other merchandise. The show adapted stock footage from the Japanese TV series &quot;Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger&quot; (1992–1993), which was the 16th installment of Toei&#x27;s &quot;Super Sentai&quot; franchise. The second and third seasons of the show drew elements and stock footage from &quot;Gosei Sentai Dairanger&quot; and &quot;Ninja Sentai Kakuranger&quot;, respectively, though the &quot;Zyuranger&quot; costumes were still used for the lead cast in these two seasons. Only the mecha and the Kiba Ranger (White Ranger) costume from &quot;Dairanger&quot; were featured in the second season while only the &quot;Kakuranger&quot; mecha was featured in the third season, though the &quot;Kakuranger&quot; costumes were later used for the mini-series &quot;Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers&quot;. The series was produced by MMPR Productions and distributed by Saban Entertainment, while the show&#x27;s merchandise was produced and distributed by Bandai Entertainment.

While a global storyline would continue in &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot;, and &quot;Power Rangers Lost Galaxy&quot; (which could be considered respectively and unofficially as the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons of the original series), the subsequent series would not be sequels or spin-offs in the traditional sense, having self-contained plots with no strong connection with the original series (except taking place in the same universe, not being reboots). The exceptions would be &quot;Power Rangers Dino Thunder&quot;, which could be considered as a continuation of the original classic series by having the presence of the character Tommy Oliver (the Green Ranger and later White Ranger, portrayed by Jason David Frank) as part of the regular team of Rangers of the generation of that series (in some of the other series the character only made special participations). Another series connected to the original classic series would be &quot;Power Rangers Operation Overdrive&quot;, as one of the main villains of this series, Thrax, is the son of Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, main villains of the classic series.

In 2010, a remake of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, with a revised new look of the original 1993 logo, comic book-referenced graphics, and extra alternative visual effects, was broadcast on ABC Kids, and Bandai produced brand new toys to coincide with the series. Only the first 32 of season one&#x27;s 60 episodes were remade. It was the final &quot;Power Rangers&quot; season to air on ABC Kids as Haim Saban re-acquired the franchise from Disney, who took over the rights in 2002. With the beginning of &quot;Power Rangers Samurai&quot; in 2011, the franchise had moved to Nickelodeon.

The original series also spawned the feature film &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;, released by 20th Century Fox on June 30, 1995. Despite mixed reviews, it was a success at the box office, and earned a cult following. In 1997, a second film titled &quot;&quot; was released as a bridge between the series &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot; and &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot;. In 2017, a reboot film based on the original series was distributed by Lionsgate, simply titled &quot;Power Rangers&quot;. Due to both the film&#x27;s financial failure and Hasbro&#x27;s acquisition of the franchise in 2018, another reboot is in development.

A television special titled &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot; commemorated the 30th anniversary of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; and premiered on Netflix on April 19, 2023, with returning cast members David Yost, Walter Emanuel Jones, Steve Cardenas, Johnny Yong Bosch, Karan Ashley, Catherine Sutherland, Barbara Goodson, and Richard Steven Horvitz who reprised their roles. Charlie Kersh portrayed Minh, the daughter of Trini Kwan and the third Yellow Ranger.

==Series overview==
===Season 1 (1993–1994)===
The series takes place in the fictional town of Angel Grove, California. On an exploratory mission on the moon, two astronauts discover an extraterrestrial container (referred to as a dumpster) and breach the unit, inadvertently releasing the evil alien sorceress Rita Repulsa and her minions from 10,000 years of confinement. Upon her release, she and her army of evil space aliens set their sights on conquering the nearest planet—Earth. The wise sage Zordon, who was responsible for capturing Rita, later becomes aware of her release and orders his robotic assistant Alpha 5 to select five &quot;teenagers with attitude&quot; to defend the Earth from Rita&#x27;s attacks. The five teens chosen are Jason Lee Scott, Kimberly Hart, Zack Taylor, Trini Kwan, and Billy Cranston. Zordon gives them the ability to transform into a superhuman fighting force known as the Power Rangers. This provides them with formidable abilities and an arsenal of weapons, as well as colossal assault vehicles called Zords which can combine into a giant humanoid robot known as the Megazord.

The series begins with the five teenagers combating Rita and her seemingly endless array of monsters, while also dealing with typical teenage problems and clashing with local bullies Bulk and Skull. However, consecutive failures lead Rita to adopt a new method for conquering Earth and destroying the Power Rangers—by attacking them with one of their own. Using her magic, Rita kidnaps and brainwashes a local teen whose fighting skills prove to equal that of Jason&#x27;s in a martial-arts tournament held in Angel Grove. The new teen, Tommy Oliver, passes Rita&#x27;s tests, becoming the Green Ranger. Entrusted with Rita&#x27;s Sword of Darkness, the source for the continuance of the evil spell he has fallen victim to, Tommy comes dangerously close to defeating the Power Rangers. After sabotaging the Command Center and cutting off Zordon&#x27;s connection to their dimension, Tommy helps Rita strike another blow to the Rangers when the Megazord is drained of its power in battle by a solar eclipse and then blasted into a molten lava crevice. However, Alpha eventually succeeds in reestablishing connection with Zordon, who then revives the Megazord. With it, the Rangers stop Tommy&#x27;s rampage on Angel Grove with his Dragonzord, and Jason ultimately defeats Tommy in a one-on-one duel by destroying the Sword of Darkness. Now free from Rita&#x27;s spell, Tommy chooses to use his Green Ranger powers to assist the Rangers in defeating the evil that gave them to him in the first place, and the Dragonzord is reconfigured to enable it to help form more powerful Zord combinations alongside the other Dinozords.

As time goes on, Rita focuses on eliminating Tommy to regain the powers that she believes belong to her. Using a special wax that was touched by Tommy when he was evil, Rita uses a magic Green Candle to slowly remove his powers, returning them to her. In the end, Tommy loses his powers, but he prevents Rita from reclaiming them by transferring them to Jason who, feeling guilt for failing to protect Tommy&#x27;s powers, accepts them. However, Tommy later returns to the team when the other Rangers&#x27; Power Coins are handed over to Rita in exchange for their kidnapped parents. With Zordon&#x27;s help, Tommy regains his powers and successfully retrieves the other Rangers&#x27; Power Coins. However, Tommy&#x27;s regained powers are only temporary and must be frequently re-charged by Zordon, who warns him that the Green Ranger&#x27;s powers will ultimately fail. Despite this, Tommy remains determined to continue assisting the other Rangers as long as possible.

===Season 2 (1994–1995)===
Lord Zedd, an intergalactic warlord and Rita&#x27;s superior, arrives at Rita&#x27;s Moon Palace, where he takes her place and throws her into a space dumpster again. He then begins his own campaign to conquer Earth. In order for the Power Rangers to compete with Zedd&#x27;s monsters, which are superior to the ones Finster made by Rita, Zordon and Alpha upgrade the Dinozords into the more powerful Thunderzords (which combine into the Thunder Megazord). However, Tommy is forced to retain use of the Dragonzord, due to his Green Ranger powers being too weak to support a new Zord.

After several defeats, Zedd&#x27;s attacks on the Rangers progressively become more violent. He focuses his attention on eliminating Tommy, whom he sees as Rita&#x27;s biggest mistake in giving him the Dragon Power Coin. The Green Ranger&#x27;s powers rapidly deteriorate, but Zedd&#x27;s efforts enhances the process. He succeeds with a special Green Crystal and uses it to completely take away the Green Ranger&#x27;s powers, and powers up Zedd&#x27;s Dark Rangers. When Tommy smashes the crystal, the Dark Rangers are sent away. Following the loss of the Green Ranger&#x27;s powers, Zordon and Alpha create, in secret, a new White Ranger to aid the other Rangers in battle. The White Ranger is revealed to be Tommy, who in addition receives a new Zord, the Tigerzord, and also becomes the new leader of the Power Rangers (replacing Jason), with a power that cannot be controlled or taken by the forces of evil.

During the Team Ninja Trials in Angel Grove, the Rangers become friends with three teenagers from Stone Canyon: Rocky DeSantos, Adam Park and Aisha Campbell. During an ensuing battle with Zedd and a magical serpent, Rocky, Adam and Aisha discover the Rangers&#x27; identities and, having been entrusted with their secret by Zordon, the three newcomers become allies of the Rangers. Later on, Jason, Zack and Trini are selected to represent Angel Grove at a World Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Rangers are faced with the task of finding replacements. To transfer the powers of the Red, Black and Yellow Rangers, they must find the Sword of Light, which is located on a deserted planet. Zedd pursues them across the galaxy in Serpentera, his massive personal Zord, and destroys most of the deserted planet. Serpentera runs out of power before being able to finish the Rangers, and they return to Earth safely with the Sword of Light. Zordon then chooses Rocky, Adam and Aisha to replace Jason, Zack and Trini as the Red, Black and Yellow Rangers, respectively.

Sometime before the power transfer, during the time when Tommy was being turned into the white ranger, Rita had returned to Earth and fell into the hands of Bulk and Skull, but the Rangers sent her back into space. She later returns to the Moon while the Rangers are in Australia, and with the help of Finster, she gets a special &quot;makeover&quot; to gain a younger and &quot;prettier&quot; face. She then uses a love potion on Zedd, who is in a deep sleep during his centennial re-evilizer, and he falls in love with her when he wakes up. They get married and join forces to make an even more terrible threat for the Rangers, but not even this can prepare them for what is to come.

===Season 3 (1995)===
Rito Revolto, Rita&#x27;s skeletal brother, comes to Earth and destroys the Rangers&#x27; Thunderzords and the Tigerzord with the help of a group of monsters. As a result, the Dinozords are also destroyed and the Power Coins are damaged beyond repair. Undaunted, the Power Rangers seek the aid of Ninjor, the alleged creator of the Power Coins, who gives them new Ninja Coins, providing them with the even more powerful Ninjazords (which combine into the Ninja Megazord) and the Falconzord.

Some time later, an Australian girl named Katherine Hillard moves to Angel Grove. She befriends the rangers and displays an intense affection for Tommy. Later it is found out that Rita had captured Katherine and put her under a powerful spell, giving her the ability to transform into a cat as well as a cat-like monster. Under this spell, she steals Kimberly&#x27;s Ninja Power Coin, vastly weakening and nearly killing the Pink Ranger, due to how her life force - like that of the other Rangers - is connected to her Ninja Coin. It is during this time that the Rangers acquire their most powerful Zords: the Shogunzords (which combine into the Shogun Megazord), but only after having to agree to help Lord Zedd destroy Angel Grove and subsequently betray him. Eventually, Katherine overcomes Rita&#x27;s evil spell and returns the Pink Ninja Power Coin to Kimberly. A short time later, Kimberly gets a chance to pursue her personal athletic dreams. With Zordon&#x27;s blessing, she leaves to train for the Pan Global Games, choosing Katherine to replace her as the Pink Ranger. Though her initial fear and hesitation keeps her from contributing fully to the fight against evil, Katherine eventually becomes both comfortable and capable of fulfilling her duty as the second Pink Ranger.

After several more battles, Zedd and Rita are joined by Rita&#x27;s father, Master Vile. Following his failed attempts to defeat the Rangers, he reverses time, turning the Rangers into powerless children. These events culminate in the mini-series &quot;Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers&quot; and lead to the next incarnation of the franchise, entitled &quot;Power Rangers Zeo.&quot;

* Finster A leprechaun-themed creature who is Rita&#x27;s chief monster maker in season 1. By season 3, he still occasionally makes monsters. He was portrayed by Takako Iiboshi (uncredited) and voiced by Robert Axelrod.
* Squatt One of Rita&#x27;s henchmen. A short, fat, blue hobgoblin-themed creature, he is usually blamed for Rita or Zedd&#x27;s failures. He was portrayed by Minoru Watanabe (uncredited) and voiced by Michael Sorich.

* Putty Patrollers The golem warriors made of clay who act as Rita Repulsa&#x27;s foot soldiers, the Putties are often sent to wear the Rangers down before a monster battle, as well as for sabotage and other special missions. The original Puttys were based on Golem Soldiers, which were the Sentai Counterpart on Zyuranger.
** Z-Putties In Season 2, Lord Zedd upgrades the Putty design, completely replacing Rita&#x27;s original design. Zedd&#x27;s Putties (or Z-Putties for short) are superior to the original Putties and are more expendable. However, the Z-Putties also have a big weakness—striking the Z-logo on their chests causes the Z-Putties to explode into pieces. The Z-Putties were the first group of Power Ranger exclusive foot soldiers.
* Tenga Warriors The crow-like soldiers that are able to speak. They are introduced in Season 3 when Rito takes them with him to the Moon as a wedding gift, and replace Zedd&#x27;s Putties. The Rangers normally use their Ninja Ranger powers to fight them. Unlike the Putties, the Tenga Warriors are not expendable and they return to the Moon when defeated. The Tengas originated in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot; (going by the name &quot;Tengu Warriors&quot;) under the command of Ivan Ooze. The name changed between the movie and show was because of copyright complications with the movie&#x27;s producer 20th Century Fox.. Like the Z-Putties, the Tenga&#x27;s were the second group of foot soldiers exclusive to Power Rangers.

==Production==
=== Conception ===
While on a business trip to Japan, Haim Saban came across a broadcast of &quot;Choudenshi Bioman&quot; on TV Asahi, later learning of a popular French-language dub aired on Canal+. Based on the franchise&#x27;s popularity both in and outside of its native country, Saban realized there was potential for an American adaptation. He and his business partner Shuki Levy quickly produced a pilot entitled &quot;Bio-Man&quot; in August 1986, which featured an early appearance by actor and martial artist Mark Dacascos in a leading role. According to Levy, they &quot;shopped it around for at least five years, but nobody wanted it.&quot; Saban only found success in 1992, when he found a network executive familiar with Super Sentai, Fox Kids&#x27; Margaret Loesch, that during her time with Marvel Productions saw partner Stan Lee trying to sell the &quot;Sun Vulcan&quot; series to various television stations such as ABC, CBS, NBC, and HBO. Loesch&#x27;s boss at Fox did not have much faith in the project, only financing a pilot that if unsuccessful, could even lead to Loesch&#x27;s dismissal. Levy and Saban then began working on the pilot using footage from the latest Sentai season, &quot;Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger&quot;, entitling the pitch &quot;Galaxy Rangers&quot;. A test screening with an audience of children was successful, and eventually, the pilot was picked up by Fox Kids for a 40-episode order, after which point it would be determined by the network whether or not to renew the series for additional episodes.

=== Casting ===
Due to the action-oriented nature of the show, many of the lead actors cast had background in martial arts, dance, or other physically intensive activities. Amy Jo Johnson (Kimberly) and David Yost (Billy) were former competitive gymnasts, Austin St. John (Jason) held a second-degree black belt in Taekwondo, and a first-degree black belt in Judo. Walter Emanuel Jones (Zack) was a dancer and trained in Taekwondo, and Thuy Trang (Trini) was a kung fu practitioner. Actor Jason Narvy (Skull) originally auditioned for the role of Billy.

=== Filming ===
The series was shot on location in Santa Clarita and Los Angeles, California. Recurring locations included Grant High School, Placerita Canyon State Park, Puddingstone Reservoir, and Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park. The House of the Book at Brandeis-Bardin Institute was used as the exterior location for the Command Center. Due to its unusual, futuristic architecture; the building had previously been used in the films &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; and &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot;.

As part of the initial licensing agreement between Saban and Toei Company, the producers of the &quot;Super Sentai&quot;, additional footage was filmed in the Greater Tokyo Area in Japan, and insert shots of the villain characters (particularly those played by Machiko Soga, Ami Kawai, and Hideaki Kusaka) were filmed in order to allow more in-depth, extensive scenes of the villains who would be unable to interact with the main cast due to the nature of the show. The additional footage included close-ups of the actor speaking English-language lines phonetically in order to make the necessary dialogue looping more seamless.

Episodes 39 &amp; 40 (The two part episode &quot;Doomsday&quot;) were originally intended as the season (and potentially series) finale. According to Paul Schrier, the producers brought Machiko Soga in to film new footage, but she could not mouth the dialogue. Due to the unprecedented success of the show and its merchandising, Fox Kids ordered an additional 20 episodes. Since most of the available stock footage from &quot;Zyuranger&quot; had been depleted for use in the first 40 episodes of Season 1, Saban commissioned Toei to produce 25 new monster costumes and new battle footage using the existing Zyuranger suits. This new footage has been referred to as &quot;Zyu2&quot; by &quot;Power Rangers&quot; fans. Saban used 15 of the new monster costumes and their footage for the rest of Season 1 (episodes 41–60), then the remaining ten for the first 13 episodes of Season 2. This became problematic, however, when the Thunderzords were introduced, as they were from &quot;Gosei Sentai Dairanger&quot;, which resulted in Saban splicing together footage from both &quot;Zyu2&quot; and &quot;Dairanger&quot; for the Megazord battles in these early Season 2 episodes.

Following production of Season 2&#x27;s first 20 episodes, Austin St. John, Thuy Trang and Walter Emanuel Jones left the show over contract disputes. To disguise this incident, a combination of body doubles, voice doubles and stock footage were used to continue featuring the characters Jason, Trini and Zack for eight episodes. The voice doubles were also used for the Ranger costume scenes in the last several episodes that the three actors filmed. The subplot of Jason, Trini and Zack leaving Angel Grove for the World Peace Conference was made to bridge the transition to their replacements.

During the later portion of Season 2 (following Rocky, Adam and Aisha&#x27;s introduction to the series), the production moved to Sydney, Australia for roughly four months to shoot &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;, which was released the following summer before the start of Season 3.

==Reception and controversy==
===Depictions of violence===
Despite the success of the series, it was also subject to much controversy from parents who felt the show was too violent for young children. The show had aired before television stations issued content warnings such as parental guidance or fit for viewing persons twelve years or over, the V-chip, and television ratings. In the US, numerous complaints were sent to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In 1993, the Canadian broadcast rights to &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; were jointly purchased by the YTV cable channel, and the series played to a receptive audience every weekday afternoon on YTV, the latter trailing the American broadcast by several months. However, due to complaints sent to the recently formed Canadian Broadcast Standards Council and a negative assessment from that body over the show&#x27;s violent content, YTV removed the series from their line-up in November. Despite not actually being a member of the CBSC, YTV complied and pulled the series before the end of its first season; Global (which was a CBSC member) ultimately did the same. While a phone-in poll was conducted to see if viewers wanted &quot;MMPR&quot; back on YTV, no further installments of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise aired on the network until 2011&#x27;s &quot;Power Rangers Samurai&quot;, although commercials for toys and videos were still advertised on it. Later Disney-era versions of the series were broadcast on ABC Family.

In 1994, the New Zealand Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) upheld several complaints from members of the public about the level of violence in the show. The main concern of those complainants was that the show portrayed violence as the primary means of resolving conflict, and that this was influencing children to behave more violently more frequently. Immediately following the BSA decision, the second season of the show was all but cancelled by Television New Zealand. New Zealand is the only country in the world where this show has been prematurely withdrawn from public broadcast to date. DVD and video releases of the more-recent &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series that were filmed in New Zealand can be found at The Warehouse, although general sales through video stores and other retailers are scarce. Later series in the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise, such as &quot;Power Rangers: Mystic Force&quot; and &quot;Power Rangers: Jungle Fury&quot;, were filmed in New Zealand, but the programs were still not shown in the country, until 2011, when &quot;Samurai&quot; premiered.

In mid-October 1994, the murder of Silje Redergård by two of her young friends prompted Swedish-owned TV3 to pull &quot;MMPR&quot; from its broadcast schedule in all of its market countries. However, &quot;MMPR&quot; was not related to the event.

===Poor work conditions===
As a non-union production, members of the original cast were reportedly subject to low pay, long hours, unfair contracts, and a hostile work environment and, as many of the cast were young, aspiring actors, they had no agents or lawyers to protect their interests and they themselves had limited experience in the entertainment industry. Additionally, despite the show&#x27;s financial success, members of the original cast did not receive royalty payments for re-runs of episodes in which they starred.

Austin St. John, Thuy Trang and Walter Emmanuel Jones were the first to leave the series, citing low pay, in the middle of the second season, and St. John was homeless for a time after leaving. While the reasons for their departure was debated for many years, St. John would confirm in 2014 that the departure was due to the low salaries the stars were being paid; he stated &quot;I could have worked the window at McDonald&#x27;s and probably made the same money the first season. It was disappointing, it was frustrating, it made a lot of us angry.&quot; The actors were receiving non-union pay, in the amount of about $60,000 per year without any compensation for merchandising for the show, which was estimated to be worth about $1 billion. Trang, St. John, and Jones were all represented by agent Ingrid Wang, and they requested more compensation and union recognition. 
Amy Jo Johnson, who left the series in the middle of the third season, later expressed regret that she and the other cast members did not join the three departing cast members in calling for union wages and recognition, wondering if all of them standing together may have led to a different result. According to Johnson, St. John, Jones and Trang had wanted the show to become unionized, leading to them being replaced by Steve Cardenas, Johnny Yong Bosch, and Karan Ashley, respectively.

Within the show, the actors&#x27; departure was explained by their characters being chosen as representatives in an international &quot;Peace Conference&quot; in Switzerland. Trang, St. John, and Jones released a joint statement about their departure:

===Allegations of homophobia===
David Yost was the last of the original Ranger actors to leave the series (during &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;), citing homophobic attitudes from production staff, prompting him to unsuccessfully undergo conversion therapy in an effort to change his sexuality. In a 2010 interview with fan blog &quot;No Pink Spandex&quot;, Yost stated that he walked off set one day because &quot;[he] was called &#x27;faggot&#x27; one too many times.&quot; He also stated that the producers would often ask other cast members what they thought about his homosexuality, and this made him uncomfortable as well. Shortly after this interview, producer Scott Page-Pagter stated that Yost left over a pay dispute and that he didn&#x27;t know why Yost made the allegations of homophobia; he further stated that Yost did not get along with any of the crew.

===Other===
In Malaysia, the phrase &quot;Mighty Morphin&quot; was censored and edited out from the logo due to the word &quot;morphin&quot; being too similar to the name of the drug morphine.

==Awards and nominations==
==Broadcast and home media==
Reruns of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; were aired on all networks such as Fox/ABC Family, Toon Disney (part of the Jetix block) and ABC Kids for a short time, the show aired on Nicktoons on 2013 for the Power Rangers event called Color of Courage for only 6 episodes, later returned on TeenNick&#x27;s The &#x27;90s Are All That block in honor of the series&#x27; 20th anniversary in 2013 and later in 2023, Video on Demand network Kabillion currently airs the show.

===VHS, DVD and streaming===

<doc id="173493" wikidata="Q49984" url="?curid=173493" title="Small Magellanic Cloud">
<text>The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is a dwarf galaxy near the Milky Way. Classified as a dwarf irregular galaxy, the SMC has a D25 isophotal diameter of about , and contains several hundred million stars. It has a total mass of approximately 7 billion solar masses. At a distance of about 200,000 light-years, the SMC is among the nearest intergalactic neighbors of the Milky Way and is one of the most distant objects visible to the naked eye.

The SMC is visible from the entire Southern Hemisphere and can be fully glimpsed low above the southern horizon from latitudes south of about 15° north. The galaxy is located across the constellation of Tucana and part of Hydrus, appearing as a faint hazy patch resembling a detached piece of the Milky Way. The SMC has an average apparent diameter of about 4.2° (8 times the Moon&#x27;s) and thus covers an area of about 14 square degrees (70 times the Moon&#x27;s). Since its surface brightness is very low, this deep-sky object is best seen on clear moonless nights and away from city lights. The SMC forms a pair with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which lies 20° to the east, and, like the LMC, is a member of the Local Group. It is currently a satellite of the Milky Way, but is likely a former satellite of the LMC.

==Observation history==
In the southern hemisphere, the Magellanic clouds have long been included in the lore of native inhabitants, including south sea islanders and indigenous Australians. Persian astronomer Al Sufi mentions them in his &quot;Book of Fixed Stars&quot;, repeating a quote by the polymath Ibn Qutaybah, but had not observed them himself. European sailors may have first noticed the clouds during the Middle Ages when they were used for navigation. Portuguese and Dutch sailors called them the Cape Clouds, a name that was retained for several centuries. During the circumnavigation of the Earth by Ferdinand Magellan in 1519–1522, they were described by Antonio Pigafetta as dim clusters of stars. In Johann Bayer&#x27;s celestial atlas &quot;Uranometria&quot;, published in 1603, he named the smaller cloud, Nubecula Minor. In Latin, Nubecula means a little cloud.
Between 1834 and 1838, John Frederick William Herschel made observations of the southern skies with his reflector from the Royal Observatory. While observing the Nubecula Minor, he described it as a cloudy mass of light with an oval shape and a bright center. Within the area of this cloud he catalogued a concentration of 37 nebulae and clusters.

In 1891, Harvard College Observatory opened an observing station at Arequipa in Peru. Between 1893 and 1906, under the direction of Solon Bailey, the telescope at this site was used to survey photographically both the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Henrietta Swan Leavitt, an astronomer at the Harvard College Observatory, used the plates from Arequipa to study the variations in relative luminosity of stars in the SMC. In 1908, the results of her study were published, which showed that a type of variable star called a &quot;cluster variable&quot;, later called a Cepheid variable after the prototype star Delta Cephei, showed a definite relationship between the variability period and the star&#x27;s apparent brightness. Leavitt realized that since all the stars in the SMC are roughly the same distance from Earth, this result implied that there is similar relationship between period and absolute brightness. This important period-luminosity relation allowed the distance to any other Cepheid variable to be estimated in terms of the distance to the SMC. She hoped a few Cepheid variables could be found close enough to Earth so that their parallax, and hence distance from Earth, could be measured. This soon happened, allowing Cepheid variables to be used as standard candles, facilitating many astronomical discoveries.

Using this period-luminosity relation, in 1913 the distance to the SMC was first estimated by Ejnar Hertzsprung. First he measured thirteen nearby cepheid variables to find the absolute magnitude of a variable with a period of one day. By comparing this to the periodicity of the variables as measured by Leavitt, he was able to estimate a distance of 10,000 parsecs (30,000 light years) between the Sun and the SMC. This later proved to be a gross underestimate of the true distance, but it did demonstrate the potential usefulness of this technique.

Announced in 2006, measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that either the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds may be moving too fast to be orbiting the Milky Way, or that the Milky Way Galaxy is more massive than was thought.

== Features ==
The SMC contains a central bar structure, and astronomers speculate that it was once a barred spiral galaxy that was disrupted by the Milky Way to become somewhat irregular.

There is a bridge of gas connecting the Small Magellanic Cloud with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which is evidence of tidal interaction between the galaxies. This bridge of gas is a star-forming site.
The Magellanic Clouds have a common envelope of neutral hydrogen, indicating they have been gravitationally bound for a long time. 

In 2017, using the Dark Energy Survey plus MagLiteS data, a stellar over-density associated with the Small Magellanic Cloud was discovered, which is probably the result of interactions between the SMC and LMC.

==X-ray sources==
The Small Magellanic Cloud contains a large and active population of X-ray binaries. Recent star formation has led to a large population of massive stars and high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) which are the relics of the short-lived upper end of the initial mass function. The young stellar population and the majority of the known X-ray binaries are concentrated in the SMC&#x27;s Bar.
HMXB pulsars are rotating neutron stars in binary systems with Be-type (spectral type 09-B2, luminosity classes V–III) or supergiant stellar companions. Most HMXBs are of the Be type which account for 70% in the Milky Way and 98% in the SMC. The Be-star equatorial disk provides a reservoir of matter that can be accreted onto the neutron star during periastron passage (most known systems have large orbital eccentricity) or during large-scale disk ejection episodes. This scenario leads to strings of X-ray outbursts with typical X-ray luminosities Lx = 1036–1037 erg/s, spaced at the orbital period, plus infrequent giant outbursts of greater duration and luminosity.

Monitoring surveys of the SMC performed with NASA&#x27;s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) see X-ray pulsars in outburst at more than 1036 erg/s and have counted 50 by the end of 2008. The ROSAT and ASCA missions detected many faint X-ray point sources, but the typical positional uncertainties frequently made positive identification difficult. Recent studies using XMM-Newton and Chandra have now cataloged several hundred X-ray sources in the direction of the SMC, of which perhaps half are considered likely HMXBs, and the remainder a mix of foreground stars, and background AGN.

No X-rays above background were observed from the Magellanic Clouds during the September 20, 1966, Nike-Tomahawk flight. Balloon observation from Mildura, Australia, on October 24, 1967, of the SMC set an upper limit of X-ray detection. An X-ray astronomy instrument was carried aboard a Thor missile launched from Johnston Atoll on September 24, 1970, at 12:54 UTC for altitudes above 300 km, to search for the Small Magellanic Cloud. The SMC was detected with an X-ray luminosity of 5 erg/s in the range 1.5–12 keV, and 2.5 erg/s in the range 5–50 keV for an apparently extended source.

The fourth Uhuru catalog lists an early X-ray source within the constellation Tucana: 4U 0115-73 (3U 0115-73, 2A 0116-737, SMC X-1). Uhuru observed the SMC on January 1, 12, 13, 16, and 17, 1971, and detected one source located at 01149-7342, which was then designated SMC X-1. Some X-ray counts were also received on January 14, 15, 18, and 19, 1971. The third Ariel 5 catalog (3A) also contains this early X-ray source within Tucana: 3A 0116-736 (2A 0116-737, SMC X-1). The SMC X-1, a HMXRB, is at J2000 right ascension (RA) declination (Dec) .

Two additional sources detected and listed in 3A include SMC X-2 at 3A 0042-738 and SMC X-3 at 3A 0049-726.

==Mini Magellanic Cloud (MMC)==
It has been proposed by astrophysicists D. S. Mathewson, V. L. Ford and N. Visvanathan that the SMC may in fact be split in two, with a smaller section of this galaxy behind the main part of the SMC (as seen from Earth perspective), and separated by about 30,000 ly. They suggest the reason for this is due to a past interaction with the LMC that split the SMC, and that the two sections are still moving apart. They dubbed this smaller remnant the Mini Magellanic Cloud.

In 2023, it was reported that the SMC is indeed two separate structures with distinct stellar and gaseous chemical compositions, separated by around 5 kiloparsecs.

<doc id="173503" wikidata="Q901620" url="?curid=173503" title="We're Only in It for the Money">
<text>We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money is the third album by American rock band the Mothers of Invention, released on March 4, 1968, by Verve Records. As with the band&#x27;s first two efforts, it is a concept album, and satirizes left- and right-wing politics, particularly the hippie subculture, as well as the Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. It was conceived as part of a project called &quot;No Commercial Potential&quot;, which produced three other albums: &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;, &quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot;, and &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;.

&quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; encompasses rock, experimental music, and psychedelic rock, with orchestral segments deriving from the recording sessions for &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;, which was previously issued by Capitol Records as a solo instrumental album by bandleader/guitarist Frank Zappa and was subsequently reedited by Zappa and released by Verve; the reedited &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; was produced simultaneously with &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; is the first &quot;phase&quot; of a conceptual continuity, which continued with the reedited &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; and concluded with Zappa&#x27;s final album &quot;Civilization Phaze III&quot; (1994). In 2005, &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the United States&#x27; Library of Congress, who deemed it &quot;culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant&quot; and &quot;a scathing satire on hippiedom and America&#x27;s reactions to it&quot;.

== Background ==
While filming &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;, Frank Zappa recorded in New York City for a project called &quot;No Commercial Potential&quot;, which ended up producing four albums: &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;; a revised version of Zappa&#x27;s solo album &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;; &quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot;; and &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;, which served as the soundtrack to the film of the same name, which finally saw a release in 1987, albeit in incomplete form.

Zappa stated, &quot;It&#x27;s all one album. All the material in the albums is organically related and if I had all the master tapes and I could take a razor blade and cut them apart and put it together again in a different order it still would make one piece of music you can listen to. Then I could take that razor blade and cut it apart and reassemble it a different way, and it still would make sense. I could do this twenty ways. The material is definitely related.&quot;

As the recording sessions continued, the Beatles released their acclaimed album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. In response to the album&#x27;s release, Zappa decided to change the album&#x27;s concept to parody the Beatles album, because he felt that the Beatles were insincere and &quot;only in it for the money&quot;. The Beatles were targeted as a symbol of Zappa&#x27;s objections to the corporatization of youth culture, and the album served as a criticism of them and psychedelic rock as a whole.

== Recording ==

Recording for &quot;We&#x27;re Only in it for the Money&quot; began on March 6, 1967, with the basic tracking of &quot;Who Needs the Peace Corps?&quot; at TTG Studios which was then under the title of &quot;Fillmore&quot;. The working title was inspired by a series of performance the Mothers of Invention held at the Fillmore Auditorium, finishing a day prior to the recording session. Zappa would then inaugurate a three-day recording stint at Capital Studios to record &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; from March 14-16, 1967. The band returned to New York in the following week, where Zappa became acquainted to then Cream guitarist Eric Clapton during an acoustic guitar led jam at his home. The band subsequently spent from April to June rehearsing and gigging locally in support of their previous album &quot;Absolutely Free&quot;, which released on May 26, 1967. Popular contemporaries such as guitarist Jimi Hendrix, and singer-songwriter Essra Mohawk, joined the Mothers of Invention during their New York shows.

In July, band member Ray Collins had left the Mothers before the New York recording sessions took place, but later rejoined when the band was recording the doo-wop songs that formed the album &quot;Cruisin&#x27; with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot;. Gary Kellgren was hired as an engineer for the project, and subsequently wound up delivering whispered pieces of dialogue that linked segments of &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;. During the recording sessions, Verve requested that Zappa remove a verse from the song &quot;Mother People&quot;. Zappa complied, but reversed the recording and included the backwards verse as part of the dialogue track &quot;Hot Poop&quot;, concluding the album&#x27;s first side, but this would be removed by Verve themselves on subsequent represses of their own. Also censored on all copies was the Lenny Bruce reference in &quot;Harry, You&#x27;re A Beast&quot;, and a spoken segment of &quot;Concentration Moon&quot; in which Kellgren called the Velvet Underground &quot;as shitty a group as Frank Zappa&#x27;s group&quot;.

Primary recording sessions ran from July until September 1967 at Mayfair Studios in New York. During this period of work on the album, the band recorded at a continuous rate, only taking breaks on the weekends. While the Jimi Hendrix Experience occupied Mayfair Studios on July 19 and 20, to record &quot;The Stars That Play with Laughing Sam&#x27;s Dice&quot;, the band worked on and executed ideas for the cover art for &quot;We&#x27;re Only in it for the Money&quot;. Hendrix would make an appearance in the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; mock cover, blending in with the cardboard cutouts of other major figures. Weekday work was only halted again on August 4, when Bob Dylan booked the studio to mix and press an acetate disc of &quot;Too Much Of Nothing&quot;. A majority of the basic tracks would be finished in August, and September was spent mostly overdubbing onto the basic recordings. On September 4, the Velvet Underground, who the Mothers of Invention then detested, entered the studio&#x27;s second recording space with Tom Wilson, the band&#x27;s previous producer, to record their sophomore album, &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;. Both bands did however co-operate in the studio, and Zappa even suggested to Velvet Underground front-man Lou Reed that he record himself stabbing a cantaloupe with a wrench in the band&#x27;s song &quot;The Gift&quot;. The Mothers of Invention halted work on September 22 to pursue what is considered to be their first European tour, before returning to Apostolic Studios, also in New York, from October 3-8 in order to finish the album off, with final overdubs and mixing occurring.

While recording &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, Zappa discovered that the strings of Apostolic Studios&#x27; grand piano would resonate if a person spoke near those strings. The &quot;piano people&quot; experiment involved Zappa having various speakers improvise dialogue using topics offered by Zappa. Various people contributed to these sessions, including Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart and Tim Buckley, who Zappa became familiar with after a concert in December 1966. The &quot;piano people&quot; voices primarily consisted of Motorhead Sherwood, Roy Estrada, Spider Barbour, All-Night John (the manager of the studio) and Louis Cuneo, who was noted for his laugh, which sounded like a &quot;psychotic turkey&quot;. 

During the production, Zappa experimented with recording and editing techniques which produced unusual textures and musique concrète compositions; the album featured abbreviated songs interrupted by segments of dialogue and unrelated music which changed the continuity of the album. Segments of orchestral music included on the album came from a solo orchestral album by Zappa previously released by Capitol Records under the title &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; in 1967. MGM claimed that Zappa was under contractual obligation to record for them, and subsequently Zappa re-edited &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;, releasing a drastically different version on Verve Records, after the release of &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;. The artwork of &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; identified it as &quot;phase 2 of &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;&quot;, while &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; was identified in its artwork as &quot;phase one of &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;&quot;, alluding to the conceptual continuity of the two albums.

For some pressings of the album, MGM censored several tracks without Zappa&#x27;s knowledge, involvement or permission. On the song &quot;Absolutely Free&quot;, the line &quot;I don&#x27;t do publicity balling for you anymore&quot; was edited by MGM to remove the word &quot;balling&quot;, changing the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, on &quot;Let&#x27;s Make the Water Turn Black&quot;, the line &quot;and I still remember Mama, with her apron and her pad, feeding all the boys at Ed&#x27;s Cafe&quot; was removed. Zappa later learned that this line was censored because an MGM executive thought that the word &quot;pad&quot; referred to a sanitary napkin, rather than a waitress&#x27;s order pad. The Kellgren dialogue segment in &quot;Concentration Moon&quot; was also re-edited, making it seem that he was calling the Velvet Underground &quot;Frank Zappa&#x27;s group.&quot; Zappa later declined to accept an award for the album upon being made aware of the censorship, stating &quot;I prefer that the award be presented to the guy who modified this record, because what you&#x27;re hearing is more reflective of his work than mine.&quot;

== Themes ==

In his lyrics for &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, Zappa speaks as a voice for &quot;the freaks—imaginative outsiders who didn&#x27;t fit comfortably into any group&quot;, according to AllMusic writer Steve Huey. Subsequently, the album satirizes hippie culture and left-wing politics, as well as targeting right-wing politics, describing both political sides as &quot;prisoners of the same narrow-minded, superficial phoniness.&quot;

Zappa later stated in 1978, &quot;hippies were pretty stupid. ... the people involved in [youth] processes ... are very sensitive to criticism. They always take themselves too seriously. So anybody who impugns the process, whether it&#x27;s a peace march or love beads or whatever it is – that person is the enemy and must be dealt with severely. So we came under a lot of criticism, because we dared to suggest that perhaps what was going on was really stupid.&quot;

Another element of the album&#x27;s lyrical content came from the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s harassment and arrests of young rock fans, which made it difficult for the band to perform on the West Coast, leading the band to move to New York City for better financial opportunities. Additionally, Zappa made reference to comedian Lenny Bruce; the song &quot;Harry, You&#x27;re A Beast&quot; quotes Bruce&#x27;s routine &quot;To Is A Preposition, Come Is A Verb&quot;.

The song &quot;Flower Punk&quot; parodies the garage rock staple &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, and depicts a youth going to San Francisco to become a flower child and join a psychedelic rock band. Additionally, the track makes a reference to &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, one of the songs that defined the counterculture of that period. The rhythmic pattern of &quot;Flower Punk&quot; is complex, consisting of 4 bars of a fast 5 (2–3), followed by 4 bars of 7 (2–2–3).

== Packaging ==
Zappa&#x27;s art director Cal Schenkel and Jerry Schatzberg photographed a collage for the album cover, which parodied the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Zappa spent US$4,000 () on the photo shoot, which he stated was &quot;a direct negative&quot; of the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album cover. &quot;[&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;] had blue skies ... we had a thunderstorm.&quot; Jimi Hendrix, a friend of Zappa, took part in the photo shoot.

Zappa phoned Paul McCartney, seeking permission for the parody. McCartney told him that it was an issue for business managers, but Zappa responded that the artists themselves were supposed to tell their business managers what to do. Nevertheless, Capitol objected, and the album&#x27;s release was delayed for five months. Verve decided to package the album with inverted cover artwork, placing the parody cover as interior artwork (and the intended interior artwork as the main sleeve) out of fear of legal action. Zappa was angered over the decision; Schenkel felt that the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; parody &quot;was a stronger image&quot; than the final released cover. In recent years, the album has been reissued with the intended front cover.

==Release==
The album was released on March 4, 1968, by Verve Records. It peaked at number 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 1984, Zappa prepared a remix of the album for its compact disc reissue and the vinyl box set &quot;The Old Masters I&quot;. The remix reinstated audio that had been censored by Verve, as well as the original &quot;Mother People&quot; verse. It also featured new rhythm tracks recorded by bassist Arthur Barrow and drummer Chad Wackerman. Zappa would later do the same with &quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot;, stating &quot;The master tapes for &quot;Ruben and the Jets&quot; were in better shape, but since I liked the results on &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, I decided to do it on &quot;Ruben&quot; too. But those are the only two albums on which the original performances were replaced. I thought the important thing was the material itself.&quot;

&quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; was also remixed by Zappa, but not released at the time. After the remixing was announced, a $13 million lawsuit was filed against Zappa by Jimmy Carl Black, Bunk Gardner and Don Preston, who were later joined by Ray Collins, Art Tripp and Motorhead Sherwood, increasing the claim to $16.4 million, stating that they had received no royalties from Zappa since 1969.

Zappa would later prepare a CD of the original stereo mix for release by Rykodisc in 1995. Unlike the remix, this retained the censorship applied to &quot;Concentration Moon,&quot; &quot;Harry You&#x27;re a Beast&quot; and &quot;Mother People&quot; on the original releases.

The audio documentary box set &quot;The Lumpy Money Project/Object&quot; chronicles the production of &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, including the orchestral version of &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;, a 1968 mono mix of &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; and 1984 remixes of &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; and the reedited &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; album, as well as additional material from the original recording sessions.

== Reception and legacy ==
Barret Hansen praised the album in an April 1968 review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He felt it was the most &quot;advanced&quot; rock album released up to that date, though not necessarily the &quot;best&quot;; he compared Zappa with the Beatles, and felt that the wit and sharpness of Zappa&#x27;s lyrics was more intelligent, but unless one were to adopt a utilitarian view, he would not deny the beauty of the Beatles&#x27; music. He concluded that while the initial listening may be significantly profound, due to the reliance on shock, subsequent listening may be reduced in value; and he returns to a comparison with the Beatles, in which he feels that Zappa has the greater musical genius, but is less comfortable to listen to.

AllMusic writer Steve Huey wrote, &quot;the music reveals itself as exceptionally strong, and Zappa&#x27;s politics and satirical instinct have rarely been so focused and relevant, making &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; quite possibly his greatest achievement.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album an A, writing, &quot;With bohemia permanent and changed utterly, this early attack on its massification hasn&#x27;t so much dated as found its context. Cheap sarcasm is forever.&quot; In 2012, &quot;Uncut&quot; described the album as a &quot;satirical psych-rock gem&quot;.

It was voted number 343 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). As of 2015, the album was ranked number 297 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Additionally, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 77 in its August 1987 article, &quot;The Top 100: The Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years&quot;. It is also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; along with the Mothers&#x27; first release, &quot;Freak Out!&quot;.

In 2005, the U.S. National Recording Preservation Board included &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; in the National Recording Registry, calling it &quot;culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant&quot; and &quot;a scathing satire on hippiedom and America&#x27;s reactions to it&quot;.

<text>United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was an inspection regime created by the United Nations to ensure Iraq&#x27;s compliance with policies concerning Iraqi production and use of weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf War. Between 1991 and 1997 its director was Rolf Ekéus; from 1997 to 1999 its director was Richard Butler.

==Summary==
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was an inspection regime created with the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 in April 1991 to oversee Iraq&#x27;s compliance with the destruction of Iraqi chemical, biological, and missile weapons facilities and to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency&#x27;s efforts to eliminate nuclear weapon facilities all in the aftermath of the Gulf War. The UNSCOM inspection regime was packaged with several other UN Security Council requirements, namely, that Iraq&#x27;s ruling regime formally recognize Kuwait as an independent state and pay out war reparations for the destruction inflicted in the Gulf War, including the firing of Kuwaiti oil supplies and destruction of public infrastructure. Until the UN Security Council saw that Iraq&#x27;s weapons programs had been aborted and Iraqi leaders had allowed monitoring systems to be installed, the UN&#x27;s aforementioned sanctions would continue to be imposed on Iraq.

The commission found corroborating evidence that Rihab Rashid Taha, an Iraqi microbiologist educated in England, had produced biological weapons for Iraq in the 1980s. The destruction of proscribed weapons and the associated facilities was carried out mainly by Iraq, under constant supervision by UNSCOM.

Inspectors withdrew in 1998, and disbanded the following year amid allegations that the United States had used the commission&#x27;s resources to spy on the Iraqi military. Weapons inspector Scott Ritter later stated that Operation Rockingham had cherry-picked evidence found by the United Nations Special Commission; evidence, he says, that was later used as part of the casus belli for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

The successor of the United Nations Special Commission was the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.

==History==
The United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was headed by Rolf Ekéus and later Richard Butler. During several visits to Iraq by the United Nations Special Committee (UNSCOM), set up after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait to inspect Iraqi weapons facilities, weapons inspectors were told by Rihab Rashid Taha that the al-Hakam germ warfare center was a chicken-feed plant. &quot;There were a few things that were peculiar about this animal-feed production plant,&quot; Charles Duelfer, UNSCOM&#x27;s deputy executive chairman, later told reporters, &quot;beginning with the extensive air defenses surrounding it.&quot;

=== 1991–1995 ===
The powers given to UNSCOM inspectors in Iraq were: &quot;unrestricted freedom of movement without advance notice in Iraq&quot;; the &quot;right to unimpeded access to any site or facility for the purpose of the on-site inspection...whether such site or facility be above or below ground&quot;; &quot;the right to request, receive, examine, and copy any record data, or information...relevant to&quot; UNSCOM&#x27;s activities; and the &quot;right to take and analyze samples of any kind as well as to remove and export samples for off-site analysis&quot;.

Acceptance of the intrusion of the UNSCOM&#x27;s inspectors on the part of the Iraqi regime was slow coming. But with the threat of punitive military action looming from the international community, and particularly the U.S., Saddam Hussein begrudgingly allowed UNSCOM&#x27;s inspectors into the country to begin their work.

From August 1991 the U.S. government made a Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft available to UNSCOM. The imagery was analysed by U.S. analysts, but the volume of imagery exceeded analysis capacity. With UNSCOM authority, Scott Ritter and some other UNSCOM weapons inspectors also regularly took Lockheed U-2 imagery to Israel for analysis. Iraq protested about the supply of such information to Israel.

Between 1991 and 1995, UN inspectors uncovered a massive program to develop biological and nuclear weapons. A large amount of equipment was confiscated and destroyed. Iraq by and large refused to cooperate with UNSCOM and its inspections as mandated by UN SC Res. 687 until June 1992, ten months after deadline, at which time the Iraqi government submitted &quot;full, final and complete reports&quot; on all of its weapons of mass destruction programs. These reports, however, were found to be incomplete and deficient, and at the same time UN inspectors were subjected to harassment and threats on the part of the Iraqi regime.

United Nations Security Council Resolution 699 was also passed in 1991, declaring that Iraq was responsible for all funding of UNSCOM&#x27;s inspections in Iraq.

In 1995, UNSCOM&#x27;s principal weapons inspector Dr. Rod Barton showed Taha documents obtained by UNSCOM from Israel that showed the Iraqi government had just purchased 10 tons of growth media from a British company called Oxoid. Growth media is a mixture of sugar, proteins and minerals that allows microscopic life to grow. It is used in hospitals, where swabs from patients are placed in dishes containing growth media for diagnostic purposes. Iraq&#x27;s hospital consumption of growth media was just 200 kg a year; yet in 1988, Iraq imported 39 tons of it.

Shown this evidence by UNSCOM, Taha admitted to inspectors that she had grown 19,000 litres of botulism toxin; 8,000 litres of anthrax; 2,000 litres of aflatoxins, which can cause liver cancer; clostridium perfringens, a bacterium that can cause gas gangrene; and ricin, a castor bean derivative which can kill by inhibiting protein synthesis. She also admitted conducting research into cholera, salmonella, foot and mouth disease, and camel pox, a disease that uses the same growth techniques as smallpox, but which is safer for researchers to work with. It was because of the discovery of Taha&#x27;s work with camel pox that the US and British intelligence services feared Saddam Hussein may have been planning to weaponize the smallpox virus. Iraq had a smallpox outbreak in the 1970s and UNSCOM scientists believe the government would have retained contaminated material.

UNSCOM learned that, in August 1990, after Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, Taha&#x27;s team was ordered to set up a program to weaponize the biological agents. By January 1991, a team of 100 scientists and support staff had filled 157 bombs and 16 missile warheads with botulin toxin, and 50 bombs and five missile warheads with anthrax. In an interview with the BBC, Taha denied the Iraqi government had weaponized the bacteria. &quot;We never intended to use it,&quot; she told journalist Jane Corbin of the BBC&#x27;s Panorama program. &quot;We never wanted to cause harm or damage to anybody.&quot; UNSCOM found the munitions dumped in a river near al-Hakam. UNSCOM also discovered that Taha&#x27;s team had conducted inhalation experiments on donkeys from England and on beagles from Germany. The inspectors seized photographs showing beagles having convulsions inside sealed containers.

=== 1996 ===
The al-Hakam germ warfare center, headed by the British-educated Iraqi biologist Dr. Rihab Rashid Taha, was blown up by UNSCOM in 1996. According to a 1999 report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, the normally mild-mannered Taha exploded into violent rages whenever UNSCOM questioned her about al-Hakam, shouting, screaming and, on one occasion, smashing a chair, while insisting that al-Hakam was a chicken-feed plant.

Iraq charged that the commission was a cover for US espionage and refused UNSCOM access to certain sites, such as Baath Party headquarters. Although Ekéus has said that he resisted attempts at such espionage, many allegations have since been made against the agency commission under Butler, charges which Butler has denied. Within the UN establishment in Iraq, UNSCOM was not without its critics, with the UN&#x27;s humanitarian staff informally calling the inspectors &#x27;UN-Scum&#x27;. In return, the UN&#x27;s humanitarian staff were called &quot;bunny-huggers&quot;.

Also in 1996, the Iraqi ruling regime agreed to the terms of United Security Council Resolution 986, an oil-for-supplies agreement in which Iraq was allowed to sell $2 billion worth of oil every six months as a ways to purchase supplies for its increasingly impoverished and malnourished population. This agreement also allowed the UN to oversee the use and management of oil revenues, and to see that some of the funds went to pay war reparations and for the work of UNSCOM in Iraq during this period. The distribution of supplies purchased with oil revenues was also to be supervised by UN inspectors to ensure fair and equal distribution throughout the Iraqi population.

=== 1998 Airstrikes ===
On the evening of 15 December 1998 the Security Council convened to consider two letters from weapons inspectors. The IAEA report by Mohamed El Baradei stated that Iraq &quot;has provided the necessary level of cooperation to enable... [our] activities to be completed efficiently and effectively&quot;. The UNSCOM report, authored by Richard Butler, deplored the restrictions, lack of disclosure, and concealment. While conceding that &quot;[i]n statistical terms, the majority of the inspections of facilities and sites under the ongoing monitoring system were carried out with Iraq&#x27;s cooperation,&quot; his letter listed a number of instances where unspecificed &quot;undeclared dual-capable items&quot; had been discovered, and where inspections had been held up so that buildings could be cleared of sensitive material.

Since Operation Desert Fox had already begun at the time of the meeting (just hours after the inspectors had been evacuated), the Security Council debated about who was to blame for the military action, rather than whether they should authorize it. The Iraqi representative said:

The Russian ambassador added:

The view of the Council was split, with several countries placing the responsibility on Iraq. The United States declared that &quot;Iraq&#x27;s policy of unremitting defiance and non-compliance necessitated the resort to military force&quot;. The United Kingdom stated that the objectives of the action were &quot;to degrade Iraq&#x27;s capability to build and use weapons of mass destruction, and to diminish the military threat Iraq poses to its neighbours. The targets chosen, therefore, are targets connected with his military capability, his weapons of mass destruction and his ability to threaten his neighbours.&quot;

=== 1999: End of UNSCOM ===
In December 1999, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1284, replacing UNSCOM with the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, also known as UNMOVIC. Four countries – among them Russia, France and China – abstained from voting on Res. 1284, which led the Iraqi regime to reject the resolution because they saw the resolution as a way for the UN to claim Iraq as a &quot;protectorate&quot;.

UNSCOM&#x27;s intention of identifying and eliminating Iraqi weapons programs resulted in numerous successes, illustrating the &quot;value of a system approach to biological arms verification&quot;. But the overall effect of the UN sanctions on Iraqi in the 1990s had some negative effects on the Iraqi people. Graham-Brown (2000) and Halliday (1999) argued the sanctions caused malnutrition rates among Iraqis to increase and infant mortality rates to soar, exacting a heavy toll on ordinary Iraqi civilians not part of Saddam&#x27;s patrimonial &quot;shadow state&quot;. However, research by Dyson nd Cetorelli (2017) demonstrated that claims of a rise in infant mortality rates and malnutrition rates among Iraqi civilians due to sanctions were due to manipulation of a 1999 UNICEF survey by Saddam&#x27;s regime, noting that comprehensive surveys after 2003 found no evidence that UN sanctions caused a rise in child mortality rates.

==Allegations of CIA infiltration of UNSCOM==
Evidence that UNSCOM had been used by US intelligence to penetrate Iraqi security and track President Saddam Hussein&#x27;s movements emerged in January 1999. An investigation by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; claimed that CIA engineers, working as UN technicians, installed equipment to spy on Iraqi sites without Butler&#x27;s knowledge, and that this explained the unidentified &quot;burst transmissions&quot; that had been noted by the inspectors.

Former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter later accused some UNSCOM personnel of spying, and also alleged that the purpose of the spying was to target Saddam in the bombing. Butler, on the other hand, denied allegations that foreign intelligence agencies &quot;piggybacked&quot; UNSCOM and questioned the factual accuracy of several of Ritter&#x27;s statements.

== Ritter on Iraq&#x27;s WMDs after 1998 ==

In June 1999, Ritter said:

When you ask the question, &quot;Does Iraq possess militarily viable biological or chemical weapons?&quot; the answer is &quot;NO!&quot; It is a resounding &quot;NO&quot;. Can Iraq produce today chemical weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Can Iraq produce biological weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Ballistic missiles? No! It is &quot;no&quot; across the board. So from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq has been disarmed. Iraq today possesses no meaningful weapons of mass destruction capability.

== Butler resigned 1999 ==

Butler resigned from UNSCOM on 30 June 1999.

<doc id="173505" wikidata="Q847198" url="?curid=173505" title="Just war theory">
<text>The just war theory () is a doctrine, also referred to as a tradition, of military ethics that aims to ensure that a war is morally justifiable through a series of criteria, all of which must be met for a war to be considered just. It has been studied by military leaders, theologians, ethicists and policymakers. The criteria are split into two groups: (&quot;right to go to war&quot;) and (&quot;right conduct in war&quot;). The first group of criteria concerns the morality of going to war, and the second group of criteria concerns the moral conduct within war. There have been calls for the inclusion of a third category of just war theory (&quot;jus post bellum&quot;) dealing with the morality of post-war settlement and reconstruction. The just war theory postulates the belief that war, while it is terrible but less so with the right conduct, is not always the worst option. The just war theory presents a justifiable means of war with justice being an objective of armed conflict. Important responsibilities, undesirable outcomes, or preventable atrocities may justify war.

Opponents of the just war theory may either be inclined to a stricter pacifist standard (proposing that there has never been nor can there ever be a justifiable basis for war) or they may be inclined toward a more permissive nationalist standard (proposing that a war need only to serve a nation&#x27;s interests to be justifiable). In many cases, philosophers state that individuals do not need to be plagued by a guilty conscience if they are required to fight. A few philosophers ennoble the virtues of the soldier while they also declare their apprehensions for war itself. A few, such as Rousseau, argue for insurrection against oppressive rule.

The historical aspect, or the &quot;just war tradition&quot;, deals with the historical body of rules or agreements that have applied in various wars across the ages. The just war tradition also considers the writings of various philosophers and lawyers through history, and examines both their philosophical visions of war&#x27;s ethical limits and whether their thoughts have contributed to the body of conventions that have evolved to guide war and warfare.

In the twenty-first century there has been significant debate between traditional just war theorists, who largely support the existing law of war and develop arguments to support it, and revisionists who reject many traditional assumptions, although not necessarily advocating a change in the law.

==Origins==
===Ancient Egypt===
A 2017 study found that the just war tradition can be traced as far back as to Ancient Egypt. Egyptian ethics of war usually centered on three main ideas, these including the cosmological role of Egypt, the pharaoh as a divine office and executor of the will of the gods, and the superiority of the Egyptian state and population over all other states and peoples. Egyptian political theology held that the pharaoh had the exclusive legitimacy in justly initiating a war, usually claimed to carry out the will of the gods. Senusret I, in the Twelfth Dynasty, claimed, &quot;I was nursed to be a conqueror...his [Atum&#x27;s] son and his protector, he gave me to conquer what he conquered.&quot; Later pharaohs also considered their sonship of the god Amun-Re as granting them absolute ability to declare war on the deity&#x27;s behalf. Pharaohs often visited temples prior to initiating campaigns, where the pharaoh was believed to receive their commands of war from the deities. For example, Kamose claimed that &quot;I went north because I was strong (enough) to attack the Asiatics through the command of Amon, the just of counsels.&quot; A stele erected by Thutmose III at the Temple of Amun at Karnak &quot;provides an unequivocal statement of the pharaoh&#x27;s divine mandate to wage war on his enemies.&quot; As the period of the New Kingdom progressed and Egypt heightened its territorial ambition, so did the invocation of just war aid the justification of these efforts. The universal principle of Maat, signifying order and justice, was central to the Egyptian notion of just war and its ability to guarantee Egypt virtually no limits on what it could take, do, or use to guarantee the ambitions of the state.

===India===
The Indian Hindu epic, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, offers the first written discussions of a &quot;just war&quot; (&quot;dharma-yuddha&quot; or &quot;righteous war&quot;). In it, one of five ruling brothers (&quot;Pandavas&quot;) asks if the suffering caused by war can ever be justified. A long discussion then ensues between the siblings, establishing criteria like &quot;proportionality&quot; (chariots cannot attack cavalry, only other chariots; no attacking people in distress), &quot;just means&quot; (no poisoned or barbed arrows), &quot;just cause&quot; (no attacking out of rage), and fair treatment of captives and the wounded.

In Sikhism, the term &quot;dharamyudh&quot; describes a war that is fought for just, righteous or religious reasons, especially in defence of one&#x27;s own beliefs. Though some core tenets in the Sikh religion are understood to emphasise peace and nonviolence, especially before the 1606 execution of Guru Arjan by Mughal Emperor Jahangir, military force may be justified if all peaceful means to settle a conflict have been exhausted, thus resulting in a &quot;dharamyudh&quot;.

===East Asian===
Chinese philosophy produced a massive body of work on warfare, much of it during the Zhou dynasty, especially the Warring States era. War was justified only as a last resort and only by the rightful sovereign; however, questioning the decision of the emperor concerning the necessity of a military action was not permissible. The success of a military campaign was sufficient proof that the campaign had been righteous.

Japan did not develop its own doctrine of just war but between the 5th and the 7th centuries drew heavily from Chinese philosophy, and especially Confucian views. As part of the Japanese campaign to take the northeastern island Honshu, Japanese military action was portrayed as an effort to &quot;pacify&quot; the Emishi people, who were likened to &quot;bandits&quot; and &quot;wild-hearted wolf cubs&quot; and accused of invading Japan&#x27;s frontier lands.

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
The notion of just war in Europe originates and is developed first in ancient Greece and then in the Roman Empire.

It was Aristotle who first introduced the concept and terminology to the Hellenic world that called war a last resort requiring conduct that would allow the restoration of peace. Aristotle argues that the cultivation of a military is necessary and good for the purpose of self-defense, not for conquering: &quot;The proper object of practising military training is not in order that men may enslave those who do not deserve slavery, but in order that first they may themselves avoid becoming enslaved to others&quot; (Politics, Book 7).

Stoic philosopher Panaetius considered war inhuman, but he contemplated just war when it was impossible to bring peace and justice by peaceful means. Just war could be waged solely for retribution or defense, in both cases having to be declared officially. He also established the importance of treating the defeated in a civilized way, especially those who surrendered, even after a prolongued conflict.

In ancient Rome, a &quot;just cause&quot; for war might include the necessity of repelling an invasion, or retaliation for pillaging or a breach of treaty. War was always potentially &quot;nefas&quot; (&quot;wrong, forbidden&quot;), and risked religious pollution and divine disfavor. A &quot;just war&quot; (&quot;bellum iustum&quot;) thus required a ritualized declaration by the fetial priests. More broadly, conventions of war and treaty-making were part of the &quot;ius gentium&quot;, the &quot;law of nations&quot;, the customary moral obligations regarded as innate and universal to human beings.

===Christian views===
Christian theory of the Just War begins around the time of Augustine of Hippo. The Just War theory, with some amendments, is still used by Christians today as a guide to whether or not a war can be justified. Christians may argue &quot;Sometimes war may be necessary and right, even though it may not be good.&quot; In the case of a country that has been invaded by an occupying force, war may be the only way to restore justice. 

====Saint Augustine====
Saint Augustine held that individuals should not resort immediately to violence, but God has given the sword to government for a good reason (based upon Romans 13:4). In &quot;Contra Faustum Manichaeum&quot; book 22 sections 69–76, Augustine argues that Christians, as part of a government, need not be ashamed of protecting peace and punishing wickedness when they are forced to do so by a government. Augustine asserted that was a personal and philosophical stance: &quot;What is here required is not a bodily action, but an inward disposition. The sacred seat of virtue is the heart.&quot;

Nonetheless, he asserted, peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could be stopped by only violence would be a sin. Defense of oneself or others could be a necessity, especially when it is authorized by a legitimate authority:They who have waged war in obedience to the divine command, or in conformity with His laws, have represented in their persons the public justice or the wisdom of government, and in this capacity have put to death wicked men; such persons have by no means violated the commandment, &quot;Thou shalt not kill.&quot;While not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase itself in his work &quot;The City of God&quot;:

But, say they, the wise man will wage Just Wars. As if he would not all the rather lament the necessity of just wars, if he remembers that he is a man; for if they were not just he would not wage them, and would therefore be delivered from all wars.

Augustine further taught:
No war is undertaken by a good state except on behalf of good faith or for safety.

J. Mark Mattox writes,In terms of the traditional notion of jus ad bellum (justice of war, that is, the circumstances in which wars can be justly fought), war is a coping mechanism for righteous sovereigns who would ensure that their violent international encounters are minimal, a reflection of the Divine Will to the greatest extent possible, and always justified. In terms of the traditional notion of jus in bello (justice in war, or the moral considerations which ought to constrain the use of violence in war), war is a coping mechanism for righteous combatants who, by divine edict, have no choice but to subject themselves to their political masters and seek to ensure that they execute their war-fighting duty as justly as possible.

====Isidore of Seville====
Isidore of Seville writes:
Those wars are unjust which are undertaken without cause. For aside from vengeance or to fight off enemies no just war can be waged. 

====Peace and Truce of God====

The medieval Peace of God (Latin: ) was a 10th century mass movement in Western Europe instigated by the clergy that granted immunity from violence for non-combatants.

Starting in the 11th Century, the Truce of God (Latin: ) involved Church rules that successfully limited when and where fighting could occur: Catholic forces (e.g. of warring barons) could not fight each other on Sundays, Thursdays, holidays, the entirety of Lent and Advent and other times, severely disrupting the conduct of wars. The 1179 Third Council of the Lateran adopted a version of it for the whole church.

====Saint Thomas Aquinas====
The just war theory by Thomas Aquinas has had a lasting impact on later generations of thinkers and was part of an emerging consensus in medieval Europe on just war. In the 13th century Aquinas reflected in detail on peace and war. Aquinas was a Dominican friar and contemplated the teachings of the Bible on peace and war in combination with ideas from Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Saint Augustine and other philosophers whose writings are part of the Western canon. Aquinas&#x27; views on war drew heavily on the , a book the Italian monk Gratian had compiled with passages from the Bible. After its publication in the 12th century, the had been republished with commentary from Pope Innocent IV and the Dominican friar Raymond of Penafort. Other significant influences on Aquinas just war theory were Alexander of Hales and Henry of Segusio.

In &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; Aquinas asserted that it is not always a sin to wage war, and he set out criteria for a just war. According to Aquinas, three requirements must be met. Firstly, the war must be waged upon the command of a rightful sovereign. Secondly, the war needs to be waged for just cause, on account of some wrong the attacked have committed. Thirdly, warriors must have the right intent, namely to promote good and to avoid evil. Aquinas came to the conclusion that a just war could be offensive and that injustice should not be tolerated so as to avoid war. Nevertheless, Aquinas argued that violence must only be used as a last resort. On the battlefield, violence was only justified to the extent it was necessary. Soldiers needed to avoid cruelty and a just war was limited by the conduct of just combatants. Aquinas argued that it was only in the pursuit of justice, that the good intention of a moral act could justify negative consequences, including the killing of the innocent during a war.

====Renaissance and Christian Humanists====
Various Renaissance humanists promoted Pacificist views.

* John Colet famously preached a Lenten sermon before Henry VIII, who was preparing for a war, quoting Cicero &quot;Better an unjust peace rather than the justest war.&quot;
* Erasmus of Rotterdam wrote numerous works on peace which criticized Just War theory as a smokescreen and added extra limitations, notably &quot;The Complaint of Peace&quot; and the &quot;Treatise on War&quot; (Dulce bellum inexpertis).

A leading humanist writer after the Reformation was legal theorist Hugo Grotius, whose &quot;De jura belli ac pacis&quot; re-considered Just War and fighting wars justly.

==== First World War ====
At the beginning of the First World War, a group of theologians in Germany published a manifesto that sought to justify the actions of the German government. At the British government&#x27;s request, Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, took the lead in collaborating with a large number of other religious leaders, including some with whom he had differed in the past, to write a rebuttal of the Germans&#x27; contentions. Both German and British theologians based themselves on the just war theory, each group seeking to prove that it applied to the war waged by its own side.

====Contemporary Catholic doctrine====
The just war doctrine of the Catholic Church found in the 1992 &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, in paragraph 2309, lists four strict conditions for &quot;legitimate defense by military force:&quot;
* The damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting, grave and certain.
* All other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective.
* There must be serious prospects of success.
* The use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated.

The &quot;Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church&quot; elaborates on the just war doctrine in paragraphs 500 to 501, while citing the Charter of the United Nations:

Pope John Paul II in an address to a group of soldiers noted the following: 

====Russian Orthodox Church====
The &quot;War and Peace&quot; section in the &quot;Basis of the Social Concept of the Russian Orthodox Church&quot; is crucial for understanding the Russian Orthodox Church&#x27;s attitude towards war. The document offers criteria of distinguishing between an aggressive war, which is unacceptable, and a justified war, attributing the highest moral and sacred value of military acts of bravery to a true believer who participates in a justified war. Additionally, the document considers the just war criteria as developed in Western Christianity to be eligible for Russian Orthodoxy; therefore, the justified war theory in Western theology is also applicable to the Russian Orthodox Church.

In the same document, it is stated that wars have accompanied human history since the fall of man, and according to the gospel, they will continue to accompany it. While recognizing war as evil, the Russian Orthodox Church does not prohibit its members from participating in hostilities if there is the security of their neighbours and the restoration of trampled justice at stake. War is considered to be necessary but undesirable. It is also stated that the Russian Orthodox Church has had profound respect for soldiers who gave their lives to protect the life and security of their neighbours.

===Just war tradition===
The just war theory, propounded by the medieval Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas, was developed further by legal scholars in the context of international law. Cardinal Cajetan, the jurist Francisco de Vitoria, the two Jesuit priests Luis de Molina and Francisco Suárez, as well as the humanist Hugo Grotius and the lawyer Luigi Taparelli were most influential in the formation of a &quot;just war tradition&quot;. The just war tradition, which was well established by the 19th century, found its practical application in the Hague Peace Conferences (1899 and 1907) and in the founding of the League of Nations in 1920. After the United States Congress declared war on Germany in 1917, Cardinal James Gibbons issued a letter that all Catholics were to support the war because &quot;Our Lord Jesus Christ does not stand for peace at any price... If by Pacifism is meant the teaching that the use of force is never justifiable, then, however well meant, it is mistaken, and it is hurtful to the life of our country.&quot;

Armed conflicts such as the Spanish Civil War, World War II and the Cold War were, as a matter of course, judged according to the norms (as established in Aquinas&#x27; just war theory) by philosophers such as Jacques Maritain, Elizabeth Anscombe and John Finnis.

The first work dedicated specifically to &quot;just war&quot; was the 15th-century sermon &quot;De bellis justis&quot; of Stanisław of Skarbimierz (1360–1431), who justified war by the Kingdom of Poland against the Teutonic Knights. Francisco de Vitoria criticized the conquest of America by the Spanish conquistadors on the basis of just-war theory. With Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius, just war theory was replaced by international law theory, codified as a set of rules, which today still encompass the points commonly debated, with some modifications.

Just-war theorists combine a moral abhorrence towards war with a readiness to accept that war may sometimes be necessary. The criteria of the just-war tradition act as an aid in determining whether resorting to arms is morally permissible. Just-war theories aim &quot;to distinguish between justifiable and unjustifiable uses of organized armed forces&quot;; they attempt &quot;to conceive of how the use of arms might be restrained, made more humane, and ultimately directed towards the aim of establishing lasting peace and justice&quot;.

The just war tradition addresses the morality of the use of force in two parts: when it is right to resort to armed force (the concern of &quot;jus ad bellum&quot;) and what is acceptable in using such force (the concern of &quot;jus in bello&quot;).

In 1869 the Russian military theorist Genrikh Antonovich Leer theorized on the advantages and potential benefits of war.

The Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin defined only three types of just war.

But picture to yourselves a slave-owner who owned 100 slaves warring against a slave-owner who owned 200 slaves for a more &quot;just&quot; distribution of slaves. Clearly, the application of the term &quot;defensive&quot; war, or war &quot;for the defense of the fatherland&quot; in such a case would be historically false, and in practice would be sheer deception of the common people, of philistines, of ignorant people, by the astute slaveowners. Precisely in this way are the present-day imperialist bourgeoisie deceiving the peoples by means of &quot;national ideology&quot; and the term &quot;defense of the fatherland&quot; in the present war between slave-owners for fortifying and strengthening slavery.

The anarcho-capitalist scholar Murray Rothbard (1926–1995) stated that &quot;a &quot;just&quot; war exists when a people tries to ward off the threat of coercive domination by another people, or to overthrow an already-existing domination. A war is &quot;unjust&quot;, on the other hand, when a people try to impose domination on another people or try to retain an already-existing coercive rule over them.&quot;

Jonathan Riley-Smith writes:
The consensus among Christians on the use of violence has changed radically since the crusades were fought. The just war theory prevailing for most of the last two centuries—that violence is an evil that can, in certain situations, be condoned as the lesser of evils—is relatively young. Although it has inherited some elements (the criteria of legitimate authority, just cause, right intention) from the older war theory that first evolved around AD 400, it has rejected two premises that underpinned all medieval just wars, including crusades: first, that violence could be employed on behalf of Christ&#x27;s intentions for mankind and could even be directly authorized by him; and second, that it was a morally neutral force that drew whatever ethical coloring it had from the intentions of the perpetrators.
==Criteria==

The just war theory has two sets of criteria, the first establishing &quot;jus ad bellum&quot; (the right to go to war), and the second establishing &quot;jus in bello&quot; (right conduct within war).

===&quot;Jus ad bellum&quot;===
The just war theory directs jus ad bellum to norms that aim to require certain circumstances to enable the right to go to war.
;Competent authority: Only duly constituted public authorities may wage war. &quot;A just war must be initiated by a political authority within a political system that allows distinctions of justice. Dictatorships (e.g. Hitler&#x27;s regime) or deceptive military actions (e.g. the 1968 US bombing of Cambodia) are typically considered as violations of this criterion. The importance of this condition is key. Plainly, we cannot have a genuine process of judging a just war within a system that represses the process of genuine justice. A just war must be initiated by a political authority within a political system that allows distinctions of justice&quot;.
;Probability of success: According to this principle, there must be good grounds for concluding that aims of the just war are achievable. This principle emphasizes that mass violence must not be undertaken if it is unlikely to secure the just cause. This criterion is to avoid invasion for invasion&#x27;s sake and links to the proportionality criteria. One cannot invade if there is no chance of actually winning. However, wars are fought with imperfect knowledge, so one must simply be able to make a logical case that one can win; there is no way to know this in advance. These criteria move the conversation from moral and theoretical grounds to practical grounds. Essentially, this is meant to gather coalition building and win approval of other state actors.
;Last resort: The principle of last resort stipulates that all non-violent options must first be exhausted before the use of force can be justified. Diplomatic options, sanctions, and other non-military methods must be attempted or validly ruled out before the engagement of hostilities. Further, in regard to the amount of harm—proportionally—the principle of last resort would support using small intervention forces first and then escalating rather than starting a war with massive force such as carpet bombing or nuclear warfare.
;Just cause: The reason for going to war needs to be just and cannot, therefore, be solely for recapturing things taken or punishing people who have done wrong; innocent life must be in imminent danger and intervention must be to protect life. A contemporary view of just cause was expressed in 1993 when the US Catholic Conference said: &quot;Force may be used only to correct a grave, public evil, i.e., aggression or massive violation of the basic human rights of whole populations.&quot;

===&quot;Jus in bello&quot;===
Once war has begun, just war theory (&quot;jus in bello&quot;) also directs how combatants are to act or should act:

;Distinction: Just war conduct is governed by the principle of distinction. The acts of war should be directed towards enemy combatants, and not towards non-combatants caught in circumstances that they did not create. The prohibited acts include bombing civilian residential areas that include no legitimate military targets, committing acts of terrorism or reprisal against civilians or prisoners of war (POWs), and attacking neutral targets. Moreover, combatants are not permitted to attack enemy combatants who have surrendered, or who have been captured, or who are injured and not presenting an immediate lethal threat, or who are parachuting from disabled aircraft and are not airborne forces, or who are shipwrecked.
;Proportionality: Just war conduct is governed by the principle of proportionality. Combatants must make sure that the harm caused to civilians or civilian property is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated by an attack on a legitimate military objective. This principle is meant to discern the correct balance between the restriction imposed by a corrective measure and the severity of the nature of the prohibited act.
;Military necessity: Just war conduct is governed by the principle of military necessity. An attack or action must be intended to help in the defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a legitimate military objective, and the harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. Jus in bello allows for military necessity and does not favor a specific justification in allowing for counter-attack recourse. This principle is meant to limit excessive and unnecessary death and destruction.
;Fair treatment of prisoners of war: Enemy combatants who surrendered or who are captured no longer pose a threat. It is therefore wrong to torture them or otherwise mistreat them.
;No means malum in se: Combatants may not use weapons or other methods of warfare that are considered evil, such as mass rape, forcing enemy combatants to fight against their own side or using weapons whose effects cannot be controlled (e.g., nuclear/biological weapons).

===Ending a war: &quot;Jus post bellum&quot;===
In recent years, some theorists, such as Gary Bass, Louis Iasiello and Brian Orend, have proposed a third category within the just war theory. &quot;Jus post bellum is described by some scholars as a new &quot;discipline,&quot; or as &quot;a new category of international law currently under construction&quot;. &quot;Jus post bellum&quot; concerns justice after a war, including peace treaties, reconstruction, environmental remediation, war crimes trials, and war reparations. &quot;Jus post bellum&quot; has been added to deal with the fact that some hostile actions may take place outside a traditional battlefield. &quot;Jus post bellum&quot; governs the justice of war termination and peace agreements, as well as the prosecution of war criminals, and publicly labelled terrorists. The idea has largely been added to help decide what to do if there are prisoners that have been taken during battle. It is, through government labelling and public opinion, that people use &quot;jus post bellum&quot; to justify the pursuit of labelled terrorist for the safety of the government&#x27;s state in a modern context. The actual fault lies with the aggressor and so by being the aggressor, they forfeit their rights for honourable treatment by their actions. That theory is used to justify the actions taken by anyone fighting in a war to treat prisoners outside of war.

== Traditionalists and Revisionists ==
There are two altering views related to the just war theory that scholars align with, which are traditionalists and revisionists. The debates between these different viewpoints rest on the moral responsiblites of actors in jus in bello.

=== Traditionalists ===
In the just war theory as it pertains to &quot;jus in bello&quot;, traditionalist scholars view that the two principles, &quot;jus ad bellum&quot; and &quot;jus in bello&quot;, are distinct in which actors in war are morally responsible. The traditional view places accountability on leaders who start the war, while soldiers are accountable for actions breaking &quot;jus in bello&quot;.

=== Revisionists ===
Revisionist scholars view that moral responsibility in conduct of war is placed on individual soldiers who participate in war, even if they follow the rules associated with &quot;jus in bello&quot;. Soldiers that participate in unjust wars are morally responsible. The revisionist view is based on an individual level, rather than on a collective whole.

<text>Talk of the Nation (TOTN) 
is an American talk radio program based in Washington D.C., produced by National Public Radio (NPR) that was broadcast nationally from 2 to 4 p.m. Eastern Time. It focused on current events and controversial issues.

The show began broadcasting in November 1991. It was hosted by Neal Conan from late 2001 to June 27, 2013, the program&#x27;s last day on air. Each episode featured guests discussing current affairs. Past regular hosts have included John Hockenberry, Ray Suarez, and Juan Williams. On Fridays Ira Flatow hosted &quot;Science Friday&quot;, with discussion topics from science and technology. The program invited listeners to pose questions for the guest host or hosts by telephone or e-mail.

On March 29, 2013, NPR announced that it would cease production of &quot;TOTN&quot; at the end of June, replacing it with an expanded version of &quot;Here and Now&quot;, an NPR/WBUR-FM co-production.

&quot;Science Friday&quot; continued as an independent show.

==Format==
&quot;TOTN&quot; began with a look ahead to the upcoming topics. Then the regular five-minute NPR newscast occurred. After the newscast, the show generally spent from 30 minutes to the entire show discussing the main topic. If discussion on that topic petered, or if the guests had to leave, then shorter news interviews similar to those found on the NPR news-magazines of five to ten minutes aired. Sometimes these shorter segments took calls, but often they did not. More controversial issues may have had guests and take calls the entire hour.

One hour&#x27;s topics did not carry into the next hour. This is because many stations carried only one hour of the program. In addition, the host delivered a concluding &quot;This is &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; from NPR News&quot; as a cue to stations that wish to cut away to local programming before the scheduled break.

To coordinate the choice of interviewees across all NPR programs such as &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, and &quot;Tell Me More&quot;, NPR set up a &quot; list&quot; system around 2005, whereby the first show to declare interest in a particular guest can &quot;reserve&quot; that person.

==Hosts==
Hosts included John Hockenberry (1991–1992), Ray Suarez (1993–1999), Juan Williams (2000–2001), and Neal Conan (2001–2013). Ira Flatow served as host of &quot;Science Friday&quot; since 1991.

Guest hosts on the show included: Alison Stewart, Ira Glass, Mary Louise Kelly, John Donvan, and Tony Cox.

From 2001 to 2013, &quot;TOTN&quot; had only two executive producers: Leith Bishop, and more recently, Sue Goodwin.

==Audience==
In September 2010, &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; was aired on 328 public radio stations, and had a weekly audience of 3.2 million and an AQH share of 605,700.

As of March 2013, &quot;TOTN&quot; was airing on 407 stations to what host Neal Conan said was &quot;the largest audience in the program&#x27;s history&quot;. In the final segment of the show&#x27;s final episode, Conan noted the program had an audience of &quot;more than 3.6 million ... each week. That puts &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; in the top 10 of all talk shows in the country.&quot;

==Cancellation==
On March 29, 2013, NPR and WBUR announced that &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; would cease production and that NPR would replace it with a two-hour version of &quot;Here and Now&quot;.

According to NPR executives, &quot;the unusual move ... to replace &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; with WBUR&#x27;s &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot;, which is carried by not even half as many stations across the country, is partly in response to long-voiced demands by member stations calling for more robust news coverage during the workday. The number of public radio listeners sags markedly between &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.&quot; Partnering with WBUR to expand &quot;Here and Now&quot; is considered a &quot;more pragmatic approach to expanding [mid-day] news coverage&quot; than &quot;Day to Day&quot; (2003–2009), an earlier NPR attempt at such a program, which had been produced in collaboration with &quot;Slate&quot;.

The final broadcast of the program was on June 27, 2013.

<doc id="173512" wikidata="Q1224345" url="?curid=173512" title="Differentiated services">
<text>Differentiated services or DiffServ is a computer networking architecture that specifies a mechanism for classifying and managing network traffic and providing quality of service (QoS) on modern IP networks. DiffServ can, for example, be used to provide low-latency to critical network traffic such as voice or streaming media while providing best-effort service to non-critical services such as web traffic or file transfers.

DiffServ uses a 6-bit differentiated services code point (DSCP) in the 6-bit differentiated services field (DS field) in the IP header for packet classification purposes. The DS field, together with the ECN field, replaces the outdated IPv4 TOS field.

==Background==
Modern data networks carry many different types of services, including voice, video, streaming music, web pages and email. Many of the proposed QoS mechanisms that allowed these services to co-exist were both complex and failed to scale to meet the demands of the public Internet. In December 1998, the IETF replaced the &quot;TOS&quot; and &quot;IP precedence&quot; fields in the IPv4 header with the &quot;DS field&quot;, which was later split to refer to only the top 6 bits with the &quot;ECN field&quot; in the bottom two bits. In the IPv6 header the &quot;DS field&quot; is part of the &quot;Traffic Class&quot; field where it occupies the 6 most significant bits.

In the DS field, a range of eight values (class selectors) is used for backward compatibility with the former IPv4 &quot;IP precedence&quot; field. Today, DiffServ has largely supplanted TOS and other layer-3 QoS mechanisms, such as integrated services (IntServ), as the primary architecture routers use to provide QoS.
==Traffic management mechanisms==
DiffServ is a &quot;coarse-grained&quot;, &quot;class-based&quot; mechanism for traffic management. In contrast, IntServ is a &quot;fine-grained&quot;, &quot;flow-based&quot; mechanism. DiffServ relies on a mechanism to &quot;classify&quot; and &quot;mark&quot; packets as belonging to a specific class. DiffServ-aware routers implement per-hop behaviors (PHBs), which define the packet-forwarding properties associated with a class of traffic. Different PHBs may be defined to offer, for example, low-loss or low-latency service.

Rather than differentiating network traffic based on the requirements of an individual flow, DiffServ operates on the principle of traffic classification, placing each data packet into one of a limited number of traffic classes. Each router on the network is then configured to differentiate traffic based on its class. Each traffic class can be managed differently, ensuring preferential treatment for higher-priority traffic on the network. The premise of Diffserv is that complicated functions such as packet classification and policing can be carried out at the edge of the network by edge routers. Since no classification and policing is required in the core routers, functionality there can then be kept simple. Core routers simply apply PHB treatment to packets based on their markings. PHB treatment is achieved by core routers using a combination of scheduling policy and queue management policy.

A group of routers that implement common, administratively defined DiffServ policies are referred to as a &quot;DiffServ domain&quot;.

While DiffServ does recommend a standardized set of traffic classes, the DiffServ architecture does not incorporate predetermined judgments of what types of traffic should be given priority treatment. DiffServ simply provides a framework to allow classification and differentiated treatment. The standard traffic classes (discussed below) serve to simplify interoperability between different networks and different vendors&#x27; equipment.

==Classification and marking==
Network traffic entering a DiffServ domain is subjected to classification and conditioning. A traffic classifier may inspect many different parameters in incoming packets, such as source address, destination address or traffic type and assign individual packets to a specific traffic class. Traffic classifiers may honor any DiffServ markings in received packets or may elect to ignore or override those markings. For tight control over volumes and type of traffic in a given class, a network operator may choose not to honor markings at the ingress to the DiffServ domain. Traffic in each class may be further conditioned by subjecting the traffic to rate limiters, traffic policers or shapers.

The per-hop behavior is determined by the DS and ECN fields in the IP header. The DS field contains the 6-bit DSCP value. Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) occupies the least-significant 2 bits of the IPv4 TOS field and IPv6 traffic class (TC) field.

In theory, a network could have up to 64 different traffic classes using the 64 available DSCP values. The DiffServ RFCs recommend, but do not require, certain encodings. This gives a network operator great flexibility in defining traffic classes. In practice, however, most networks use the following commonly defined per-hop behaviors:
*&quot;Default Forwarding&quot; (DF) PHB — which is typically best-effort traffic
*&quot;Expedited Forwarding&quot; (EF) PHB — dedicated to low-loss, low-latency traffic
*&quot;Assured Forwarding&quot; (AF) PHB — gives assurance of delivery under prescribed conditions
*&quot;Class Selector&quot; PHBs — which maintain backward compatibility with the IP precedence field.

===Default Forwarding===
A default forwarding (DF) PHB is the only required behavior. Essentially, any traffic that does not meet the requirements of any of the other defined classes uses DF. Typically, DF has best-effort forwarding characteristics. The recommended DSCP for DF is 0.

===Expedited Forwarding===

The IETF defines Expedited Forwarding (EF) behavior in . The EF PHB has the characteristics of low delay, low loss and low jitter. These characteristics are suitable for voice, video and other realtime services. EF traffic is often given strict priority queuing above all other traffic classes. Because an overload of EF traffic will cause queuing delays and affect the jitter and delay tolerances within the class, admission control, traffic policing and other mechanisms may be applied to EF traffic. The recommended DSCP for EF is 101110B (46 or 2EH).

===Voice Admit===

The IETF defines Voice Admit behavior in . The Voice Admit PHB has identical characteristics to the Expedited Forwarding PHB. However, Voice Admit traffic is also admitted by the network using a Call Admission Control (CAC) procedure. The recommended DSCP for voice admit is 101100B (44 or 2CH).

===Assured Forwarding===

The IETF defines the Assured Forwarding (AF) behavior in and . Assured forwarding allows the operator to provide assurance of delivery as long as the traffic does not exceed some subscribed rate. Traffic that exceeds the subscription rate faces a higher probability of being dropped if congestion occurs.

The AF behavior group defines four separate AF classes with all traffic within one class having the same priority. Within each class, packets are given a drop precedence (high, medium or low, where higher precedence means &quot;more&quot; dropping). The combination of classes and drop precedence yields twelve separate DSCP encodings from AF11 through AF43 (see table).

Some measure of priority and proportional fairness is defined between traffic in different classes. Should congestion occur &quot;between&quot; classes, the traffic in the higher class is given priority. Rather than using strict priority queuing, more balanced queue servicing algorithms such as fair queuing or weighted fair queuing are likely to be used. If congestion occurs &quot;within&quot; a class, the packets with the higher drop precedence are discarded first. Re-marking a packet is sometimes used to increase its drop precedence if a stream&#x27;s bandwidth exceeds a certain threshold. For example, a stream whose rate is above the Committed Information Rate (CIR) as defined in causes the stream to be marked with a higher AF drop precedence. This allows the decision as to when to shape the stream to devices further downstream if they encounter congestion. To prevent issues associated with tail drop, more sophisticated drop selection algorithms such as random early detection are often used.

===Class Selector===

DF= Default Forwarding

Prior to DiffServ, IPv4 networks could use the IP precedence field in the TOS byte of the IPv4 header to mark priority traffic. The TOS octet and IP precedence were not widely used. The IETF agreed to reuse the TOS octet as the DS field for DiffServ networks, later splitting it into the DS field and ECN field. In order to maintain backward compatibility with network devices that still use the Precedence field, DiffServ defines the &quot;Class Selector&quot; PHB.

The Class Selector code points are of the binary form &#x27;xxx000&#x27;. The first three bits are the former IP precedence bits. Each IP precedence value can be mapped into a DiffServ class. IP precedence 0 maps to CS0, IP precedence 1 to CS1, and so on. If a packet is received from a non-DiffServ-aware router that used IP precedence markings, the DiffServ router can still understand the encoding as a Class Selector code point.

Specific recommendations for use of Class Selector code points are given in .

===Configuration guidelines===
 offers detailed and specific recommendations for the use and configuration of code points. Other RFCs such as have updated these recommendations.

sr+bs = single rate with burst size control (such as a token bucket).

==Design considerations==

Under DiffServ, all the policing and classifying are done at the boundaries between DiffServ domains. This means that in the core of the Internet, routers are unhindered by the complexities of collecting payment or enforcing agreements. That is, in contrast to IntServ, DiffServ requires no advance setup, no reservation, and no time-consuming end-to-end negotiation for each flow.

The details of how individual routers deal with the DS field are configuration specific, therefore it is difficult to predict end-to-end behavior. This is complicated further if a packet crosses two or more DiffServ domains before reaching its destination. From a commercial viewpoint, this means that it is impossible to sell different classes of end-to-end connectivity to end users, as one provider&#x27;s Gold packet may be another&#x27;s Bronze. DiffServ or any other IP-based QoS marking does not ensure the quality of the service or a specified service-level agreement (SLA). By marking the packets, the sender indicates that it wants the packets to be treated as a specific service, but there is no guarantee this happens. It is up to all the service providers and their routers in the path to ensure that their policies will take care of the packets in an appropriate fashion.

==Bandwidth broker==

A Bandwidth Broker in the framework of DiffServ is an agent that has some knowledge of an organization&#x27;s priorities and policies and allocates bandwidth with respect to those policies. In order to achieve an end-to-end allocation of resources across separate domains, the Bandwidth Broker managing a domain will have to communicate with its adjacent peers, which allows end-to-end services to be constructed out of purely bilateral agreements.

<doc id="173513" wikidata="Q7339573" url="?curid=173513" title="Road verge">
<text>A road verge is a strip of groundcover consisting of grass or garden plants, and sometimes also shrubs and trees, located between a roadway and a sidewalk. Verges are known by dozens of other names such as grass strip, nature strip, curb strip, or park strip, the usage of which is often quite regional.

Road verges are often considered public property, with maintenance usually being a municipal responsibility. Some local authorities, however, require abutting property owners to help maintain (e.g. watering, mowing, edging, trimming/pruning and weeding) their respective verge areas, as well as clean the adjunct footpaths and gutters, as a form of community work.

Benefits of having road verges include visual aesthetics, increased safety and comfort of sidewalk users, protection from spray from passing vehicles, and a space for benches, bus shelters, street lights, and other public amenities. Verges are also often part of sustainability for water conservation or the management of urban runoff and water pollution and can provide useful wildlife habitat. Snow that has been ploughed off the street in colder climates often is stored in the area of the verge by default.

In the British Isles, road verges serve as important habitats for a range of plants, including rare wildflowers. In the UK, around 700 different species of wildflower can be found growing on verges, including 29 of the country&#x27;s 52 species of orchid. Verges can also support a wide range of animals and plants that may have been displaced from their usual grassland habitats, as the soil is not extensively fertilised and relatively undisturbed by human activity. Animals that reside on verges range from small insects and amphibians, to larger reptiles, mammals and birds, which rely on verges as a corridor connecting areas of undamaged habitat. As a result, verges may be managed by local areas to encourage biodiversity and conserve the ecosystems that rely on them. 

The main disadvantage of a road verge is that the right-of-way must be wider, increasing the cost of the road. In some localities, a wider verge offers opportunity for later road widening, should the traffic usage of a road demand this. For this reason, footpaths are usually sited a significant distance from the curb.

Certain nutrient amounts in a verge&#x27;s soil can be influenced by the amount of traffic on the road it sits beside; roads with heavier traffic tend to have more nitrate in the soil due to nitrogen compounds from air pollution leaching out of the atmosphere and into the ground.

==Sustainable urban and landscape design==

In urban and suburban areas, urban runoff from private and civic properties can be guided by grading and bioswales for rainwater harvesting collection and bioretention within the &quot;tree-lawn&quot; – parkway zone in rain gardens. This is done for reducing runoff of rain and domestic water: for their carrying waterborne pollution off-site into storm drains and sewer systems; and for the groundwater recharge of aquifers.

In some cities, such as Santa Monica, California, city code mandates specify: Parkways, the area between the outside edge of the sidewalk and the inside edge of the curb which are a component of the Public Right of Way (PROW) – that the landscaping should require little or no irrigation and the area produce no runoff.

For Santa Monica, another reason for this use of &quot;tree-lawns&quot; is to reduce current beach and Santa Monica Bay ocean pollution that is measurably higher at city outfalls. New construction and remodeling projects needing building permits require that landscape design submittals include garden design plans showing the means of compliance.

In some cities and counties, such as Portland, Oregon, street and highway departments are regrading and planting rain gardens in road verges to reduce boulevard and highway runoff. This practice can be useful in areas with either independent Storm sewers or combined storm and sanitary sewers, reducing the frequency of pollution, treatment costs, and released overflows of untreated sewage into rivers and oceans during rainstorms.

==Rural roadsides==
In some countries, the road verge can be a corridor of vegetation that remains after adjacent land has been cleared. Considerable effort in supporting conservation of the remnant vegetation is prevalent in Australia, where significant tracts of land are managed as part of the &quot;roadside conservation&quot; strategies by government agencies.

<text>A gambit (from Italian , the act of tripping someone with the leg to make them fall) is a chess opening in which a player sacrifices with the aim of achieving a subsequent advantage.

The word &quot;&quot; is also sometimes used to describe similar tactics used by politicians or business people in a struggle with rivals in their fields, for example: &quot;The early election was a risky gambit by Theresa May.&quot;

== Terminology ==
The Spanish word &quot;gambito&quot; was originally applied to chess openings in 1561 by Ruy López de Segura, from an Italian expression &quot;dare il gambetto&quot; (to put a leg forward in order to trip someone). In English, the word first appeared in Francis Beale&#x27;s 1656 translation of a Gioachino Greco manuscript, &quot;The Royall Game of Chesse-play&quot; (&quot;illustrated with almost one hundred Gambetts&quot;). The Spanish &quot;gambito&quot; led to French &quot;gambit&quot;, which has influenced the English spelling of the word. The metaphorical sense of the word as &quot;opening move meant to gain advantage&quot; was first recorded in English in 1855.

Gambits are more commonly played by White. Some well-known examples of a gambit are the King&#x27;s Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.f4) and Evans Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4). A gambit employed by Black may also be named a gambit, e.g. the Latvian Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5), or Englund Gambit (1.d4 e5); but is sometimes named a &quot;countergambit&quot;, e.g. the Albin Countergambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5) and Greco Countergambit (the original name for the Latvian Gambit). Not all opening lines involving the sacrifice of material are named as gambits, for example the main line of the Two Knights Defense (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Na5) in which Black sacrifices a pawn for active play is known as the &quot;Knorre Variation&quot;, though it may be &quot;described&quot; as a &quot;gambit&quot;. On the other hand, the Queen&#x27;s Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4) is not a true gambit as Black cannot hold the pawn without incurring a disadvantage. As is often the case with chess openings, nomenclature is inconsistent.

== Strategy ==



Gambits are described as being &quot;offered&quot; to an opponent, and that offer is then said to be either &quot;accepted&quot; or &quot;declined&quot;.

In modern chess, the typical response to a moderately sound gambit is to accept the material and give the material back at an advantageous time. For gambits that are less sound, the accepting player is more likely to try to hold on to their extra material. A rule of thumb often found in various primers on chess suggests that a player should get three moves (see tempo) of for a sacrificed pawn, but it is unclear how useful this general maxim is since the &quot;free moves&quot; part of the compensation is almost never the entirety of what the gambiteer gains. Often, a gambit can be declined with no disadvantage.

== Soundness ==
A gambit is said to be &#x27;sound&#x27; if it is capable of procuring adequate concessions from the opponent. There are three general criteria in which a gambit is often said to be sound:
# Time gain: the player accepting the gambit must take time to procure the sacrificed material and possibly must use more time to reorganize their pieces after the material is taken.
# Generation of differential activity: often a player accepting a gambit will decentralize their pieces or pawns and their poorly placed pieces will allow the gambiteer to place their own pieces and pawns on squares that might otherwise have been inaccessible. In addition, bishops and rooks can become more active simply because the loss of pawns often gives rise to open and . Former world champion Mikhail Tal once reportedly told Mikhail Botvinnik that he had sacrificed a pawn because it was simply in the way.
# Generation of positional weaknesses: finally, accepting a gambit may lead to a compromised pawn structure, holes or other positional deficiencies.

An example of a sound gambit is the Scotch Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4. Here Black can force White to sacrifice a pawn speculatively with 4...Bb4+, but White gets very good compensation for one pawn after 5.c3 dxc3 6.bxc3, or for two pawns after 6.0-0 inviting 6...cxb2 7.Bxb2, due to the development advantage and attacking chances against the black king. As a result, Black is often advised not to try to hold on to the extra pawn. A more dubious gambit is the so-called Halloween Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nxe5 Nxe5 5.d4. Here the investment (a knight for just one pawn) is too large for the moderate advantage of having a strong center.

== Examples ==

* King&#x27;s Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.f4
* Queen&#x27;s Gambit: 1.d4 d5 2.c4
* Evans Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4
* Rousseau Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 f5
* Smith–Morra Gambit: 1.e4 c5 2.d4 intending 2...cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3
* Two Knights Defense: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 with 5.exd5 Na5 6.Bb5+ c6 7.dxc6 bxc6 likely to follow
* Blackmar–Diemer Gambit (BDG): 1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.Nc3 followed by 4.f3
* From&#x27;s Gambit: 1.f4 e5
* Staunton Gambit: 1.d4 f5 2.e4
* Budapest Gambit: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5
* Scotch Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4
* Latvian Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5
* Danish Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3. c3
* Blackburne Shilling Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nd4
:This is not a true gambit by Black, since after 4.Nxe5 Qg5 Black wins material. White can play a gambit themselves with 5.Bxf7+! Ke7 6.0-0! Qxe5 7.Bxg8 Rxg8 8.c3 Nc6 9.d4, when White&#x27;s two pawns and rolling pawn center, combined with Black&#x27;s misplaced king, give White strong compensation for the sacrificed bishop.
* Elephant Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d5!?
* Englund Gambit: 1.d4 e5?!
* Italian Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.d4

<text>Automobiles Delaunay-Belleville () was a French luxury automobile manufacturer at Saint-Denis, France, north of Paris. At the beginning of the 20th century they were among the most prestigious cars produced in the world, and perhaps the most desirable French marque.

== History ==
Julien Belleville had been a maker of marine boilers from around 1850. Louis Delaunay joined the firm in 1867 and married Belleville&#x27;s daughter. He changed his name to Delaunay-Belleville and succeeded his father-in-law in charge of the company.

S.A. des Automobiles Delaunay-Belleville was formed in 1903 by Louis Delaunay and . Barbarou&#x27;s family owned the boiler making company Belleville in Saint-Denis, with boiler design influences inspired by the company. Barbarou, then 28, had experience working for Clément, Lorraine-Dietrich and Benz and was responsible for design and styling, including the trademark round grille shell. The first car was exhibited at the 1904 Paris Salon, and it received enormous acclaim.

The company started with three models, all four-cylinders: a live axled 16 hp and a 24 hp and 40 hp model, both chain-driven. These were likely the first automobiles to have pressure-lubricated camshafts. The bodies were attached with just four bolts, and the brakes were water-cooled, from a reservoir.

Delaunay-Belleville were a prestige marque, and one of the world&#x27;s leaders, from the outset, and by 1906, Emperor Nicholas II of Russia had purchased a 40. Other royal owners included King George I of Greece and King Alphonso XIII of Spain.

The first French car maker to offer a six-cylinder engine, Delaunay-Belleville&#x27;s 70 hp became available only in 1909, and then only in small numbers, remaining in limited production until 1912. This model came to be known as the Type SMT, or &quot;Sa Majesté le Tsar&quot;, because Nicholas purchased one of the last 70s built. He also ordered another in 1909; the demand for a silent starter, operable from the driving seat, became known as a Barbey starter, and was made standard at the end of 1910.

Like most prestige marques, the cars were sold as bare chassis and bodies were coachbuilt for them. Between 1906 and 1914, British imports were mainly bodied by Shinnie Brothers, a Burlington Coachbuilders subsidiary, in Aberdeen, then shipped to London for sale.

Postwar, Continental bodies gained popularity, at least in Britain, as Belgium&#x27;s D&#x27;Ieteren Frères became most associated with the company: their landaulette, on a 26 hp chassis, was priced in Britain at £900, pitting them between Napier and Rolls-Royce.

In 1919, the company offered the P4, a 2 litre sidevalve 10 hp four-cylinder, undoubtedly the most expensive &quot;voiturette&quot; on the market, as well as a 2.6 litre OHC 15.9 hp four, the P4B, in 1922.

After Barbarou resigned, Delaunay-Belleville quality began to slip. New four-cylinder pushrod overhead valve 14/40 and 16/60 models appeared in 1926, and the pre-war 20 hp and 10 hp six-cylinder models continued to be produced until 1927. The last gasps were the 21 hp six of 1928 and the 21/75 OHV six of 1930. In 1931, Continental engines, imported from the US, were offered, being quieter and cheaper.

By the late 1920s, Delaunay-Belleville had lost its prestige, and converted to truck and military vehicle production. In 1936 the previously separate car company was merged with the Delaunay-Belleville parent. Production of the Delaunay-Belleville RI-6 continued through the late 1930s and was revived after the Second World War. This was a six-cylinder-engined car strongly resembling the Mercedes-Benz 230, featuring independent suspension all-round; revived postwar, it featured Cotal preselector gearbox and a front grille design apparently copied from the 1939 Buick. However, the business was in decline: anyone buying a RI-6 in the 1940s would have done so in the knowledge after-sales service might disappear soon. Six cars were completed in 1947 and only four during the first part of 1948.

The company continued to advertise new cars for sale until 1950, but the factory was sold to Robert de Rovin in 1948 and thereafter used to make cyclecars.

<doc id="173516" wikidata="Q5434481" url="?curid=173516" title="Far-infrared astronomy">
<text>Far-infrared astronomy is the branch of astronomy and astrophysics that deals with objects visible in far-infrared radiation (extending from 30 μm towards submillimeter wavelengths around 450 μm).

In the far-infrared, stars are not especially bright, but emission from very cold matter (140 Kelvin or less) can be observed that is not seen at shorter wavelengths. This is due to thermal radiation of interstellar dust contained in molecular clouds.

These emissions are from dust in circumstellar envelopes around numerous old red giant stars. The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey mapped the galaxy for the first time in the far-infrared.

== Telescopes == 
On 22 January 2014, European Space Agency scientists reported the detection, for the first definitive time, of water vapor on the dwarf planet, Ceres, largest object in the asteroid belt. The detection was made by using the far-infrared abilities of the Herschel Space Observatory. The finding is unexpected because comets, not asteroids, are typically considered to &quot;sprout jets and plumes&quot;. According to one of the scientists, &quot;The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids.&quot;
The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is opaque over most of the far-infrared, so most far-infrared astronomy is performed by satellites such as the Herschel Space Observatory, Spitzer Space Telescope, IRAS, and Infrared Space Observatory. Upper-atmosphere observations are also possible, as conducted by the airborne SOFIA telescope.

Ground-based observations are limited to submillimetre wavelengths using high-altitude telescopes such as the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, the High Elevation Antarctic Terahertz Telescope and the Submillimeter Array.

<text>Nell Carter (born Nell Ruth Hardy; September 13, 1948 – January 23, 2003) was an American actress and singer.

Carter began her career in 1970, singing in the theater, and later began work on television. She was best known for her role as Nell Harper on the sitcom &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot;, which aired from 1981 to 1987. Carter received two Emmy and two Golden Globe award nominations for her work on the series. Prior to &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot;, Carter won a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical in 1978 for her performance in the Broadway musical &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; as well as a Primetime Emmy Award for her reprisal of the role on television in 1982.

==Early life==
Nell Ruth Hardy was born on September 13, 1948 in Birmingham, Alabama, one of nine children born to Edna Mae and Horace Hardy. She was born into a Catholic family and raised Presbyterian. Carter later self-identified as Pentecostal and as Jewish.

At the age of two, Hardy witnessed her father&#x27;s electrocution when he stepped on a live power line.

As a child, she began singing on a local gospel radio show and was also a member of the church choir. At age 15, she began performing at area coffee houses, and later joined the Renaissance Ensemble that played at coffee houses and gay bars.

On July 5, 1965 at the age of 16, Hardy was raped at gunpoint by a man whom she knew. She became pregnant as a result of the rape and gave birth to daughter Tracy the next year. Finding raising a baby alone too difficult, she sent her child to live with her older sister Willie. She later claimed that Tracy was the product of a brief marriage, but she revealed the truth in a 1994 interview.

==Career==
===Broadway work===
At age 19, Hardy changed her surname to Carter and left Birmingham, Alabama, moving to New York City with the Renaissance Ensemble, where she sang in coffee shops, nightclubs and bathhouses before landing her first Broadway role in 1971.

Carter made her Broadway debut in the 1971 rock opera &quot;Soon&quot;, which closed after three performances. She was the music director for the 1974 Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective&#x27;s production of &quot;What Time of Night It Is&quot;. Carter appeared with Bette Davis in the 1974 stage musical &quot;Miss Moffat&quot;, based on Davis&#x27; earlier film &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot;, but the show closed before reaching Broadway.

Carter became a star for her role in the musical &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&quot;, for which she won a Tony Award in 1978. She later won an Emmy for the same role in a televised performance in 1982.

In 1978, Carter was cast as Effie White in the Broadway musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; but departed the production during development to take a television role on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. When &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; premiered in late 1981, Jennifer Holliday had taken the lead role.

Carter&#x27;s additional Broadway credits include &quot;Dude&quot; and the 20th-anniversary production of &quot;Annie&quot;, in which she played Miss Hannigan.

===Film and television===
In 1979, Carter had a part in the Miloš Forman-directed musical adaptation of &quot;Hair&quot; and her voice is heard on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

In 1981, she took a role on the NBC action comedy television series &quot;The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo&quot; before landing the lead role of Nell Harper on the sitcom &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot;.

===&quot;Gimme a Break!&quot;===
Carter became best known to audiences for her lead role in the NBC television series &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot;, in which she played a housekeeper for a widowed police chief (Dolph Sweet) and his three daughters. The show earned Carter nominations for a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award. A total of 137 episodes of &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot; were produced over a run of six seasons, airing from 1981 to 1987.

In August 1987 after the cancellation of &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot;, Carter returned to the nightclub circuit with a five-month national tour with comedian Joan Rivers.

===Further television work===
In 1989, Carter played the assistant to a banquet-hall owner in an unsuccessful pilot for NBC titled &quot;Morton&#x27;s by the Bay&quot;, which aired as a one-time special that May. In October, she performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before Game 4 of the 1989 World Series in San Francisco.

In 1990, Carter starred in the CBS comedy &quot;You Take the Kids&quot;. The series, which was perceived as the black answer to &quot;Roseanne&quot; with its portrayal of a working-class black family, featured Carter as a crass, no-nonsense mother and wife. &quot;You Take the Kids&quot; faced poor ratings and reviews and only ran from December 1990 to January 1991.

During the early 1990s, Carter appeared in low-budget movies, television specials and game shows such as &quot;Match Game &#x27;90&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. She costarred in &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot; from 1993 to 1995.

In the mid-1990s, Carter appeared on Broadway in a revival of &quot;Annie&quot; as Miss Hannigan. She was upset when commercials promoting the show used white actress Marcia Lewis as Miss Hannigan. The producers stated that the commercials, which were created during an earlier production, were too costly to reshoot. However, Carter felt that racism played a part in the decision. She told the &quot;New York Post&quot;: &quot;Maybe they don&#x27;t want audiences to know Nell Carter is black. ... It hurts a lot. I&#x27;ve asked them nicely to stop it—it&#x27;s insulting to me as a black woman.&quot; Carter was later replaced by Sally Struthers.

===Later years===
In 2001, Carter appeared as a special guest star on the pilot episode of &quot;Reba&quot; and continued with the show, making three appearances in Season 1. The following year, Carter made two appearances on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; and a guest appearance on Blue&#x27;s Clues.

In 2002, she rehearsed for a production of &quot;Raisin&quot;, a stage musical based on &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; in Long Beach, California. She appeared in the 2003 film &quot;Swing&quot;. Her final onscreen appearance was in the comedy film &quot;Back by Midnight&quot;, released in 2005, two years after her death.
Nell&#x27;s final recording project was a duet with Jay Levy, produced by Jay Levy for the 1998 Warner/Rhino Album To Life!: Songs of Chanukah and Other Jewish Celebrations.

==Death==
On January 23, 2003, at the age of 54, Carter collapsed and died at her home in Beverly Hills. Her son Joshua discovered her body that night. Per a provision in Carter&#x27;s will, no autopsy was performed. Using blood tests, X-rays and a cursory physical examination, the Los Angeles County coroner&#x27;s office ruled that Carter&#x27;s death was the likely result of &quot;probable arteriosclerotic heart disease, with diabetes a contributing condition.&quot;

Carter&#x27;s friend Ann Kaser inherited her property and custody of her two sons. Carter is interred at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Personal life==
Carter attempted suicide in the early 1980s, and around 1985 she entered a drug-detoxification facility to break a longstanding cocaine addiction. Her brother Bernard died of complications from AIDS in 1989.

Carter married mathematician and lumber executive George Krynicki, and she converted to Judaism in 1982. She filed for divorce from Krynicki in 1989 and the divorce was finalized in 1992.

Carter had three children: daughter Tracy and sons Joshua and Daniel. She adopted both Joshua and Daniel as newborns over a four-month period. She attempted to adopt twice more, but both adoptions failed. In her first attempt, she allowed a young pregnant woman to move into her home with the plan that she would adopt the child, but the mother decided to keep the baby. Carter also had three miscarriages.

In 1992, Carter had surgery to repair two aneurysms. She married Roger Larocque in June 1992 but divorced him the next year. Carter declared bankruptcy in 1995 and again in 2002.

<text>KHTML is a discontinued browser engine that was developed by the KDE project. It originated as the engine of the Konqueror browser in the late 1990s, but active development ceased in 2016. It was officially discontinued in 2023.

Built on the KParts framework and written in C++, KHTML had relatively good support for Web standards during its prime. Engines forked from KHTML are used by most of the browsers that are widely used today, including WebKit (Safari) and Blink (Google Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi and Brave).

==History==
===Origins===
KHTML was preceded by an earlier engine called &quot;khtmlw&quot; or &quot;the KDE HTML Widget&quot;, developed by Torben Weis and Martin Jones, which implemented support for HTML 3.2, HTTP 1.0, and HTML frames, but not the DOM, CSS, or JavaScript.

KHTML itself came into existence on November 4, 1998, as a fork of the khtmlw library, with some slight refactoring and the addition of Unicode support and changes to support the move to Qt 2. Waldo Bastian was among those who did the work of creating that early version of KHTML.

===Re-write and improvement===
The real work on KHTML actually started between May and October 1999, with the realization that the choice facing the project was &quot;either do a significant effort to move KHTML forward or to use Mozilla&quot; and with adding support for JavaScript as the highest priority. So in May 1999, Lars Knoll began doing research with an eye toward implementing the DOM specification, finally announcing on August 16, 1999 that he had checked in what amounted to a complete rewrite of the KHTML library—changing KHTML to use the standard DOM as its internal document representation. That in turn allowed the beginnings of JavaScript support to be added in October 1999, followed shortly afterwards with the integration of KJS by Harri Porten.

In the closing months of 1999 and first few months of 2000, Knoll did further work with Antti Koivisto and Dirk Mueller to add CSS support and to refine and stabilize the KHTML architecture, with most of that work being completed by March 2000. Among other things, those changes enabled KHTML to become the second browser after Internet Explorer to correctly support Hebrew and Arabic and languages written right-to-left—before Mozilla had such support.

KDE 2.0 was the first KDE release (on October 23, 2000) to include KHTML (as the rendering engine of the new Konqueror file and web browser, which replaced the monolithic KDE File Manager).

===Other modules===
KSVG was first developed in 2001 by Nikolas Zimmermann and Rob Buis; however, by 2003, it was decided to fork the then-current KSVG implementation into two new projects: KDOM/KSVG2 (to improve the state of DOM rendering in KHTML underneath a more formidable SVG 1.0 render state) and Kcanvas (to abstract any rendering done within khtml/ksvg2 in a single shared library, with multiple backends for it, e.g., Cairo/Qt, etc.).

KSVG2 is also a part of WebKit.

===Sunsetting===
KHTML was scheduled to be removed in KDE Frameworks 6. Active development ended in 2016, just the necessary maintenance to work with updates to Frameworks 5. It was officially discontinued in 2023.

==Standards compliance==
The following standards are supported by the KHTML engine:

* HTML 4.01
* HTML 5 support
* CSS 1
* CSS 2.1 (screen and paged media)
* CSS 3 Selectors (fully as of KDE 3.5.6)
* CSS 3 Other (multiple backgrounds, box-sizing and text-shadow)
* PNG, MNG, JPEG, GIF graphic formats
* DOM 1, 2 and partially 3
* ECMA-262/JavaScript 1.5
* Partial Scalable Vector Graphics support
==Descendants==

KHTML and KJS were adopted by Apple in 2002 for use in the Safari web browser. Apple publishes the source code for their fork of the KHTML engine, called WebKit. In 2013, Google began development on a fork of WebKit, called Blink.

<text>Ultraviolet astronomy is the observation of electromagnetic radiation at ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 10 and 320 nanometres; shorter wavelengths—higher energy photons—are studied by X-ray astronomy and gamma-ray astronomy. Ultraviolet light is not visible to the human eye. Most of the light at these wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, so observations at these wavelengths must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space.

==Overview==

Ultraviolet line spectrum measurements (spectroscopy) are used to discern the chemical composition, densities, and temperatures of the interstellar medium, and the temperature and composition of hot young stars. UV observations can also provide essential information about the evolution of galaxies. They can be used to discern the presence of a hot white dwarf or main sequence companion in orbit around a cooler star.

The ultraviolet universe looks quite different from the familiar stars and galaxies seen in visible light.
Most stars are actually relatively cool objects emitting much of their electromagnetic radiation in the visible or near-infrared part of the spectrum. Ultraviolet radiation is the signature of hotter objects, typically in the early and late stages of their evolution. In the Earth&#x27;s sky seen in ultraviolet light, most stars would fade in prominence. Some very young massive stars and some very old stars and galaxies, growing hotter and producing higher-energy radiation near their birth or death, would be visible. Clouds of gas and dust would block the vision in many directions along the Milky Way.

Space-based solar observatories such as SDO and SOHO use ultraviolet telescopes (called AIA and EIT, respectively) to view activity on the Sun and its corona. Weather satellites such as the GOES-R series also carry telescopes for observing the Sun in ultraviolet.

The Hubble Space Telescope and FUSE have been the most recent major space telescopes to view the near and far UV spectrum of the sky, though other UV instruments have flown on smaller observatories such as GALEX, as well as sounding rockets and the Space Shuttle.

Pioneers in ultraviolet astronomy include George Robert Carruthers, Robert Wilson, and Charles Stuart Bowyer.

<doc id="173524" wikidata="Q2709643" url="?curid=173524" title="Nissan Skyline GT-R">
<text>The is a Japanese sports car based on the Nissan Skyline range. The first cars named &quot;Skyline GT-R&quot; were produced between 1969 and 1972 under the model code KPGC10, and were successful in Japanese touring car racing events. This model was followed by a brief production run of second-generation cars, under model code KPGC110, in 1973.

After a 16-year hiatus, the GT-R name was revived in 1989 as the BNR32 (&quot;R32&quot;) Skyline GT-R. Group A specification versions of the R32 GT-R were used to win the Japanese Touring Car Championship for four years in a row. The R32 GT-R also had success in the Australian Touring Car Championship, with Jim Richards using it to win the championship in 1991 and Mark Skaife doing the same in 1992, until a regulation change excluded the GT-R in 1993. The technology and performance of the R32 GT-R prompted the Australian motoring publication &quot;Wheels&quot; to nickname the GT-R &quot;Godzilla&quot; in its July 1989 edition. &quot;Wheels&quot; then carried the name through all the generations of Skyline GT-Rs, most notably the R34 GT-R, which they nicknamed &quot;Godzilla Returns&quot;, and described as &quot;The best handling car we have ever driven&quot;. In tests conducted by automotive publications, R34 GT-R have covered a quarter of a mile  (402 metres) in 12.2 seconds from a standing start time and accelerated from in 4.4 seconds.

The Skyline GT-R became the flagship of Nissan performance, showing many advanced technologies including the ATTESA E-TS all-wheel drive system and the Super-HICAS four-wheel steering. Today, the car is popular for import drag racing, circuit track, time attack and events hosted by tuning magazines. Production of the Skyline GT-R ended in August 2002. The car was replaced by the GT-R (R35), an all-new vehicle based on an enhanced version of the Skyline V36 platform. Although visibly different, the two vehicles share similar design features and are manufactured in the same factory.

The Skyline GT-R was never manufactured outside Japan, and the sole export markets were Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, in 1991, and the UK (in 1997, due to the Single Vehicle Approval scheme). They are also popular across the world as used Japanese imports.

Despite this, the Skyline GT-R has become an iconic sports car as a grey import vehicle in the Western world (mainly the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, Canada, and the United States). It has become notable through pop culture such as &quot;The Fast and the Furious,&quot; &quot;Initial D&quot;, &quot;Shakotan Boogie&quot;, &quot;Wangan Midnight&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed&quot;, &quot;Forza&quot;, &quot;Driving Emotion Type-S&quot;, Test Drive, and &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;. 

In 2019, Nismo announced that it would resume production of spare parts for all generations of the Skyline GT-R, including body panels and engines.

==History of the brand==
The Skyline name originated from Prince automobile company, which developed and sold the Skyline line of sedans before merging with Nissan-Datsun.

The original Skyline was launched by the Prince Motor Company in April 1957 and was powered by a 1.5-litre engine. The later iteration launched in 1964 called the Prince Skyline GT was powered by a 2.0-litre &quot;G7&quot; inline-6 engine shared with the up market Prince Gloria sedan. Two road going versions were built. The S54A which had a single carburettor engine rated at and the S54B which had a triple carburettor engine rated at and production totalled 100 units.

The GT-R abbreviation stands for Gran Turismo–Racing&quot; while the GT-B stands for Gran Turismo–Berlinetta&quot;. The Japanese chose to use Italian naming conventions when naming the car – as most cars that were made in Japan at that time used Western abbreviations – to further enhance sales. The earliest predecessor of the GT-R, the S54 2000 GT-B, came second in its first race in the 1964 Japanese GP to the purpose-built Porsche 904 GTS. However, the earlier Prince Skyline Sport coupé/convertible foreshadowed the GT-R as the first sports-oriented model in the Skyline range, hence the name.

The next development of the GT-R, the four-door PGC10 2000 GT-R, scored 33 victories in the one and a half years it raced, and by the time it attempted its 50th consecutive win, its run was ended by a Mazda Savanna RX-3. The car took 1,000 victories by the time it was discontinued in 1972. The last of the original GT-R models, the KPGC110 2000GT-R, used an unchanged S20 inline-6 engine from the earlier 2000 GT-R and only 197 units were sold due to the worldwide energy crisis. This model was the only GT-R to never participate in a major race despite being developed as a sole purpose-built race car, which now resides in Nissan&#x27;s storage unit for historical cars in Zama.

The Skyline continued into the 1990s when it became popular largely because it remained rear wheel drive, while most other manufacturers were focusing on front wheel drive cars.

Throughout its lifetime, various special editions containing additional performance-enhancing modifications were introduced by Nissan and its performance division Nismo (Nissan Motorsport).

== First generation (1969–1972)==
The first Skyline GT-R, known by the internal Nissan designation of PGC10, was introduced on 4 February 1969, and was exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealership network called &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; when the Prince company was integrated into Nissan operations in 1966. It was available originally as a four-door sedan after a public debut at the October 1968 Tokyo Motor Show. It was advertised alongside the Nissan R380 racecar to showcase the Skyline&#x27;s racing heraldry. It was equipped with the 2.0 L DOHC S20 Inline-six engine rated at at 7,000 rpm and at 5,600 rpm. Power was delivered to the rear wheels by a 5-speed manual transmission and the car was equipped with a limited slip differential. The first Skyline GT-R rode on a semi-trailing arm strut suspension. The braking system consisted of disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. It was available in a coupé bodystyle in March 1971 with the chassis code KPGC10.

The interior of the car was very basic and featured racing bucket seats and a three-spoke steering wheel along with wood inserts. The pedals were finished in aluminium.

A popular name for the PGC and KPGC10 Skyline GT-R was Hakosuka, which combines the Japanese word for box (&quot;hako&quot; or ハコ) and the pronounced abbreviation of skyline (&quot;Suka&quot; or スカ as in スカイライン or &quot;sukairain&quot;).

A total of 1,945 PGC and KPGC10 Skyline GT-Rs were produced.

== Second generation (1972–1973)==


The KPGC10&#x27;s successor, the KPGC110, was introduced in 1973 after its introduction at the 1972 Tokyo Motor Show. Powered by a 1,989 cc S20 inline-6 engine, the second generation of the GT-R delivered power to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual gearbox. This car also had both front and rear disc brakes. The suspension was a semi-trailing ring arm setup and minor aerodynamic parts were added.

This model of the GT-R was also known as the Kenmeri Skyline, due to a popular advertisement featuring a young couple (Ken and Mary) enjoying the Hokkaido countryside. The advertisement later spawned a hit song by Buzz, and the tree featured in the advertisement later became a minor star itself.

The second generation GT-R was unsuccessful, as the 1973 oil crisis reduced demand for high-performance sports cars. A total of 197 cars were built by the end of its short production run. For the next decade, this was the last GT-R until the production of the R32 in 1989.

== Third generation (1989–1994)==
=== Concept ===
After discontinuing the Skyline GT-R in 1973, Nissan revived the GT-R nameplate again in 1989. At the time Nissan was competing in Group A Racing with the Skyline GTS-R. Nissan wanted to retire the GTS-R in favor of a more competitive vehicle. The new generation of the GT-R, E-BNR32 chassis (commonly shortened to R32), was designed to dominate Group A class racing.

Nissan Kohki (Nissan&#x27;s power train engineering and manufacturing facility) originally tested a twin turbocharged bored and stroked version of the RB20 engine. This set up resulted in a power output of and used a rear wheel drive drivetrain. Under Group A regulations, a turbocharged engine must multiply its engine displacement by 1.7, putting the new Skyline in the 4,000 cc class, and requiring the use of 10-inch-wide tyres. Knowing that they would be required to use 10-inch-wide tyres, Nissan decided to make the car all wheel drive. Nissan developed a special motorsport-oriented AWD system for this purpose called the ATTESA E-TS. Although this assisted with traction, it made the car heavier; the added weight put the GT-R at a disadvantage to other cars in the 4,000 cc class. Nissan then made the decision to increase the displacement to 2,600 cc, and put the car in the 4,500 cc class, with the car&#x27;s weight near-equal to competing cars. The 4,500 cc class also allowed for 11-inch-wide tyres. New engine block and heads were then developed to better match the increased displacement. The result was a car that had a power output of . Later REINIK (Racing &amp; Rally Engineering Division Incorporated Nissan Kohi) produced Group A racing engines rated between depending on track conditions.

=== Production ===
This new RB26DETT-powered all wheel drive concept was put into production as the R32 Nissan Skyline GT-R. The R32 developed at 6,800 rpm and of torque at 4,400 rpm, it had a curb weight of . Nissan officially started its production run 21 August 1989, and began its Group A campaign in 1990.

The Skyline GT-R Nismo, identified by the model code suffix &quot;RA&quot;, was introduced on 22 February 1990 and attracted a premium of over the standard car. It existed to homologate a number of changes related to performance, aerodynamics, weight-saving and reliability for Group A racing. Those rules required a production run of 500 units, under the &quot;Evolution&quot; special regulations, but an additional 60 were produced and held by Nissan to turn into race cars, rising the production total to 560 units. Aerodynamic changes include: two additional ducts in the front bumper and removal of the protective honeycomb mesh to improve airflow to the intercooler, a bonnet lip spoiler to direct more air into the engine bay, deeper rear spats, and an additional boot lip spoiler to provide more downforce. The Nismo specification deletes ABS, which is not legal in Group A, and the rear wiper to save weight. The bonnet and front panels are aluminium in all GT-R models rather than the standard steel in non GT-R models, again to save weight. Overall the GT-R Nismo weighs compared to for the standard GT-R. Tyres are Bridgestone RE71 in 225/55R16 fitted to 16-inch alloy wheels. Mechanically, the GT-R Nismo uses the RB26 engine of the &#x27;standard&#x27; GT-R but replaces the standard Garrett T03 turbo chargers with larger T04B models, sacrificing the faster spool up of the ceramic turbo wheels for the enhanced reliability of steel wheels. The GT-R Nismo was only available in colour code KH2 &quot;Gun Grey Metallic&quot;. Other minor, but noticeable, changes include a circular &quot;Nismo&quot; logo on the right-rear of the boot lip, lack of radio tuning controls on the dashboard console (since a radio was optional), and cross-drilled brake rotors. Nismo-branded options available included a speedometer, 3-inch cat-back exhaust system, front suspension tower brace, sports shock absorbers, 17-inch alloy wheels, and a rear spoiler with a built-in third brake light.

The Skyline GT-R &#x27;N1&#x27; model (identified by the model code suffix &quot;ZN&quot;), was introduced on 19 July 1991, and designed for home-market N1 racing with a total of 245 units eventually produced (118 of these are &#x27;N1&#x27;, 64 are &#x27;V·Spec N1&#x27;, and 63 are &#x27;V·Spec II N1&#x27; – see below explanation of &#x27;V·Spec&#x27;). The most notable change was in the engine, which was upgraded to the R32-N1 specification. Building on the &#x27;Nismo&#x27; car&#x27;s specification, it was also lightened by the removal of the ABS, and rear wiper, but for &#x27;N1&#x27; the air conditioning, sound system, and boot carpet were also deleted, and distinctive light-weight headlights were fitted. &#x27;N1&#x27; cars also had reinforcing for the brake master cylinder and additional brake cooling ducts under the car. All &#x27;N1&#x27; cars were delivered with a thin layer of colour code 326 &quot;Crystal White&quot; paint.

To celebrate the success of the GT-R in both Group N and Group A racing, Nissan introduced the Skyline GT-R V·Spec (&quot;Victory SPECification&quot;) package on 3 February 1993. The V·Spec added Brembo brakes and a retuned ATTESA E-TS system. The V·Spec was available in both &#x27;plain&#x27; and &#x27;N1&#x27; variants, with all V·Spec cars using the lightweight aluminium bonnet and front bumpers from the &#x27;Nismo&#x27;. The cars also replaced the standard 16-inch wheels with 17-inch BBS wheels with 225/45R17 tyres.

Finally on 14 February 1994, the Skyline GT-R V·Spec II was introduced, with the only change being wider 245/45R17 tyres. The &#x27;plain&#x27; V·Spec and V·Spec II had a curb weight of , weighing more than the standard GT-R. Total production of the V·Spec and V·Spec II was 1,396 and 1,306 units respectively.

Production of the R32 Skyline GT-R ceased in November 1994 after a production run of 43,937 units.

The most popular colours are KH2 &quot;Gun Grey Metallic&quot; (45% of cars), followed by 326 &quot;Crystal White&quot; (18%), 732 &quot;Black Pearl Metallic&quot; (13%), KL0 &quot;Spark Silver Metallic&quot; (12%). The rarest colour is BL0 &quot;Greyish Blue Pearl&quot; with only 141 units.

In 1989, the Japanese Best Motoring television program conducted a test at the Nürburgring Nordschleife with a production version Nissan Skyline GT-R R32. Driven by Motoharu Kurosawa, the car completed a lap time of a 8:22.38 minutes around the semi-wet (damp) condition circuit, making it the fastest production vehicle around the track.

As of August 2014, the first R32 Skyline GT-Rs became eligible for US import under the NHTSA &quot;25 year&quot; rule that allows vehicles that are 25 years old (to the month) or older to be imported. Due to their age, these vehicles do not have to comply with federal emissions or with federal motor vehicle safety standards.

The R32 Zero-R was a special tuner edition which was engineered by HKS with . 10 were made but only 4 remain in existence. One was bought by the Sultan of Brunei. One of them was bought at the 2019 Tokyo Auto Salon for and sent to Australia.

The R32 Tommy Kaira GTR was another limited edition, with only 95 ever produced. At the time two specs were available: &quot;RL&quot; &amp; &quot;R&quot; .

== Fourth generation (1995–1998)==


The E-BCNR33 (R33) was developed even as the non GT-R R33 models went on sale in August 1993 (with a prototype being shown at the 1993 Tokyo Motor Show) for release in 1995 as a successor to the R32 model. The engine in the R33 was nearly identical to the R32. It used the same turbochargers and the same specification for the manual gearbox, although the synchros were stronger. The engine corrected the R32&#x27;s weak oil pump drive collar, which tended to fail in higher power applications, by using a wider collar (also fixed in spec 2 R32&#x27;s prior to R33 release). The base model of the R33 GT-R weighs .

The R33 GT-R went on sale on 6 January 1995 with the base model GT-R and the V·Spec model. The V·Spec model weighed in heavier, and had sportier suspension resulting in lower ground clearance. The V·Spec also featured the newer ATTESA E-TS Pro all wheel drive system, which included an active limited-slip differential.

At the same time as the introduction of the R33 GT-R and GT-R V·Spec, Nissan introduced the R33 GT-R V·Spec N1 model. Changes made to the R33 N1 are similar to those in the R32 N1. The car was made lighter by removing the ABS, air conditioning, sound system, rear wiper, and boot carpet. The R33 GT-R V·Spec N1 received the slightly revised R33 N1 engine.

The R33 ended production on 9 November 1998. The last R33 GT-R produced was a V-Spec in GV1 finished in Black Pearl colour.

Before the official release of the R33, Nissan recorded a lap time for the R33 GT-R at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, driven by &quot;Dirk Schoysman&quot;, car set a lap time of 7:59.887 minutes, became the first production vehicle to break into the sub 8 minute mark. Also the, fastest production vehicle around the track. In 1999, the record was broken by a Skyline GT-R R34.

In 1995, Best Motoring conducted a test of the GT-R R33 at the Nürburgring Nordschleife. Driven by Motoharu Kurosawa, the car set a 8:01.72 minute lap time around the track.

In the UK, due to the popularity of the Skyline GT-R as a grey import, a limited run of R33 GT-R V·Specs were officially imported in 1997. Sold through the Middlehurst Nissan dealer in St Helens, these cars were fitted with upgraded cooling systems, a unique front bumper, UK-specification lights, an imperial speedometer and a reprogrammed speed limiter. The entire run of 97 cars were sold in 9 months. Middlehurst Nissan would later import a run of R34 GT-R V·Specs in 1999.

=== Autech Version 40th Anniversary ===


In 1997, Autech made a limited edition GT-R four-door sedan to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Skyline nameplate. While 400 of the Autech 40th Anniversary were planned, in the end 416 examples were built.

=== 1995 GT-R LM ===
Nissan mostly competed in Group C racing with purpose built prototype race cars after the R32 GT-R was ousted from the Group A racing but rule changes for Group C forced Nissan to abandon Group C racing. Nissan then set out to develop one of its existing cars to enter the GT1 class racing in the BPR racing series. The company decided to base the new GT1 car on the R33 LM race car. The weight of the car was reduced to and the all-wheel-drive system was removed. The car was also considerably widened and lowered with a new bodykit in order to increase downforce. The car was equipped with the N1 specification engine which had a power output of . The engine was mated to a 6-speed sequential manual transmission manufactured by Xtrac.

The all-wheel-drive system was removed, which led to significant differences from the original GT-R R33. Nissan had to build a homologation road car to correspond to the rear-wheel drive system of the racing version. The 1995 GT1 regulations stated that the GT1 race car must be overall similar to the road version, but did not specify how many road cars should be produced. Thus, a single road LM car was developed and stored at Nissan&#x27;s Zuma facility. The road version of the car was detuned to and was equipped by the same wider body kit as the racing version. The interior remained the same as the standard R33 GT-R albeit with an Alcantara rimmed steering wheel and racing bucket seats.

Two race cars were built having numbers 22 and 23. They were entered in the 1995 season of LeMans but faced tough competition from more powerful race cars such as the Ferrari F40 LM and the McLaren F1 GTR. The number 22 car driven by H. Fukuyama and S. Kasuya qualified in the 34th season and finished 5th in its class with an overall position of 10th while the number 23 retired after 157 laps due to gearbox damage. Due to the entry of purpose built race cars by using loopholes in the regulations such as the Porsche 911 GT1, Nissan decided to withdraw for the 1996 season.

=== 1996 LM Limited ===
There were several limited editions of the BCNR33 produced. The first LeMans, or &quot;LM&quot; version, was introduced in May 1996 to celebrate Nissan&#x27;s participation in the 24-hours of Le Mans. The only body colour available for the R33 LM was Champion Blue. The car had a front splitter lip to direct air to the upper front aperture, and a carbon fibre rear wing with Gurney flap. There were carbon fibre inserts on the rear wing fins with a GT-R badge on the inserts. The &quot;GT-R Skyline&quot; logo under the checkered flag was placed on the C-pillars.

Nissan produced just 188 units of this model, 86 GT-R LM Limited and 102 V-Spec LM Limited.

Limited edition factory fitted extras:

* Champion Blue paint (code BT2).
* Carbon fibre rear wing blade.
* N1 Front brake cooling ducts.
* N1 bonnet lip.
* Commemorative GT-R decals on C-pillars.

=== 1996 Nismo 400R ===
A special edition of the R33 was introduced in 1995, named as Nismo 400R, with &quot;400&quot; and &quot;R&quot; standing for horsepower of the engine and for racing respectively. Overall development and planning was by Nismo (Nissan Motorsports International). But, its bored and stroked RB26DETT engine, the RBX-GT2, was engineered and produced by REINIK (later renamed REIMAX – &quot;REINIK to the MAX&quot;). The engine featured 77.7 mm stroke crankshaft (73.7 mm stock), forged 87 mm pistons (86 mm cast stock), upgraded rods, polished ports, high lift camshafts, upgraded oil system, larger exhaust manifolds and higher output turbochargers. NISMO produced an upgraded exhaust, a twin-plate clutch, and intercooler system. Nismo brake pads were fitted to the car. 400R exclusive aerodynamic updates were also added, such as wider bumpers, side skirts, a new rear bumper, a new front bumper with bigger air scoops, and a redesigned bonnet and rear spoiler made of carbon fibre. The 400R was also fitted with 1810 Nismo LM-GT1s. The engine developed and , which allowed a top speed of over , and enabled it to accelerate from in 4.0 seconds. NISMO had originally planned to produce 100 units of the 400R, however, only 44 units were made before production of the R33 ended in 1998.

== Fifth generation (1999–2002)==
The GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R, GT-R V·Spec and GT-R V·Spec N1 models were introduced in January 1999. The R34 GT-R was shorter (from front to rear), and the front overhang was reduced as compared to its predecessor. The valve covers were painted glossy red (colour code Cherry Red Effect Z24 or X1020), as opposed to black in previous models.

A new feature on the R34 GT-R is a 5.8&quot; LCD multifunction display on the centre of the dashboard, which shows seven different live readings of engine and vehicle statistics such as turbocharger pressure (1.2 bar max), oil and water temperature, among others. The GT-R V·Spec model added two extra features to the display: intake and exhaust gas temperatures. Nismo multi-function displays (MFD) could be bought at an extra cost, they included a lap timer, G-Force meter and an increase in boost pressure measurement to 2 bar. The R34 GT-R was made shorter in response to customer concerns who thought the R33 was too bulky.

Like the R33, the new R34 GT-R V·Spec (Victory Specification) models come equipped with the ATTESA E-TS Pro system and an active LSD at the rear, while standard GT-R models come with the non-Pro system and a conventional mechanical differential. The V·Spec model also had firmer suspension and lower ground clearance, thanks to front and side splitters, as well as a rear carbon fibre air diffuser, designed to keep air flowing smoothly under the car.

At the time of the R34&#x27;s introduction, like the R32 and R33, Nissan introduced an R34 V·Spec N1 model. The R34 V·Spec N1 was equipped similar to the R32 and R33 N1 models – a homologation special. It was sold without air conditioning, audio equipment, rear wiper, or boot lining, but ABS remained. The new R34 N1 was also given the new R34 N1 engine. Only 38 known R34 V·Spec N1 models were produced from the factory, 12 of which Nismo used for Super Taikyu racing. The rest were sold to various customers, mostly racing teams and tuning garages.

The V·Spec version was also imported into the UK through the Middlehurst Nissan dealer with a number of modifications carried out on these 80 cars. These included 3 additional oil coolers, revised ECU map, full Connolly leather interior, underbody diffusers, stiffer suspension, active rear limited slip differential, an increased mph speed limiter and an extra display feature on the in car display. In additional to the UK, 10 were sold to Hong Kong and Singapore, and 5 to New Zealand although with different changes for their respective markets.

In October 2000, Nissan introduced the V·Spec II, replacing the V·Spec. The V·Spec II has increased stiffness in the suspension (even stiffer than the original V·Spec) and had larger rear brake rotors. It also comes equipped with a carbon fibre bonnet equipped with a NACA duct, which is lighter than the aluminium that all other GT-R bonnets are made from. Also different on the V·Spec II was an iridium centre console and aluminium pedals. The seats were upholstered with black cloth rather than the grey cloth used on previous R34 GT-R models, and the amber turn lenses were replaced with white versions. 

With the exception of the carbon fibre bonnet, the standard trim level GT-R also received these updates. A total of 18 V·Spec II N1 were built. A total of 1855 V·Spec II were built for Japan, with an additional 2 being sold for the New Zealand market. The V·Spec N1 was replaced with the V·Spec II N1. The same changes applied to the V·Spec N1 were applied to the V·Spec II N1, with the exception of the V·Spec II carbon bonnet which was now unpainted.

In May 2001, the M·Spec was introduced. It was based on the V-Spec II, but had special &quot;Ripple control&quot; dampers, revised suspension set up, stiffer rear sway bar and a leather interior with heated front seats. The &#x27;M&#x27; on the M·Spec stood for Mizuno who is the chief engineer of Nissan. The only other change was the removal of the carbon fibre bonnet which was replaced with the standard aluminium bonnet.

In February 2002, Nissan launched a final production model of the R34 GT-R called the Skyline GT-R V·Spec II Nür and the Skyline GT-R M·Spec Nür, which were based on the V-Spec II N1. The Nür was named after the famous German Nürburgring racetrack, where the Skyline was developed. 

In total, 1,003 units of the R34 GT-R Nür were produced. 718 were V·Spec II Nürs and 285 were M·Spec Nürs. The Nür model featured an improved RB26DETT based on the N1 racing engine. The standard turbochargers were upgraded to larger versions with a slight increase in boost and the ceramic blades were replaced with steel versions. This has increased lag, but the turbo&#x27;s durability was improved while being able to handle a bigger boost increase. The V·Spec II Nür is based on the regular V·Spec II model, and the M·Spec Nür was based on the regular M·Spec model. 

Other than the addition of the Nür engine, the Nür models also included a different colour of stitching on the interior trim, as well as a speedometer reading up to , gold valve covers instead of red and a gold VIN plate instead of silver. Due to Japanese car industry norms for the passenger vehicles at the time, the car was advertised as having but it actually had over when it left the factory.

In 1999, during Nissan&#x27;s testing session at the Nürburgring Nordscheleife. The car set a unofficial lap time of 7:52 minutes around the track, driven by Nissan&#x27;s test driver Kazuo Shimizu. The car broke the Skyline GT-R R33&#x27;s record, which was the fastest production vehicle around the track.

=== Z-Tune ===
Nismo originally designed the concept of the Z-tune in 2002 when Nissan was putting an end to the R34 Skyline production. The first Z-tune was built in 2003, using a used 2002 Skyline GT-R V·Spec II. It was built with a concept RB26DETT &#x27;Z1&#x27; engine. This engine was based on Nissan&#x27;s Le Mans GT2 and GT500 racing experiences. As with the racing vehicles a strengthened engine block and stroked crankshaft were utilised. The engine was also bored. With the new displacement of 2.8 L and upgraded turbochargers the Z1 engine was rated at at 6800 rpm and of torque at 5200 rpm. The Z-Tune had a acceleration time of 3.8 seconds and has a top speed of over .

Nismo was then given the approval from Nissan to build Z-tune models for the Nismo anniversary. Nismo then purchased 18 used R34 GT-R V·Spec, each with less than on the odometer, they were then completely stripped and were resprayed to a &quot;&quot;Z-tune Silver&quot;,&quot; a special colour exclusively for the Z-tune. One car was left in its original colour of Midnight Purple III. For each of the 18 production models, the 2.8 L engine was revised to allow it to reach a speed of 8,000 rpm. The turbochargers were supplied by IHI in Japan. The engine is advertised to be able to generate (for warranty reasons). This second revision of the Z-tune engine is called the &#x27;Z2&#x27;. The bodywork is designed with the same functional components used in Nismo&#x27;s GT500 racing cars, such as engine bay vents on the bonnet and bumpers, as well as wider arches for wider wheels. The Z-tune is also improved with an aggressive suspension setup from Sachs, and a specially designed Brembo brake system.

The entire car is essentially handmade, with the car being completely stripped and re-built from the ground up. Engineers reinforced and stiffened the chassis seam welding in key areas such as the door seams and door frames and added carbon fibre to the strut towers and transmission tunnel and the engine bay, completely redesigning the suspension, drivetrain, engine, gearbox and other components so as to work at maximum efficiency and reliability as is expected of a road-going vehicle. Although Nismo planned on building 20 cars, they ceased production on only 19 (including 2 prototypes).
===Replacement===

Following the end of R34 production in 2002, Nissan announced they would separate the GT-R model from the Skyline name, creating an entirely new vehicle—though based on the same platform as the Skyline. This new car, now known simply as the Nissan GT-R, debuted in 2007 in Tokyo. Introduced to consumers in 2008, it was the first GT-R available worldwide, entering the North American market for the first time.

The GT-R uses the Premium Midship (PM) platform, an evolution of the FM platform first used by the V35 generation of the Skyline. The R34 heritage is reflected in its chassis codes: CBA-R35 (2007–2011), DBA-R35 (2012–2016), 4BA-R35 (2017–present) or simply R35.

==Powertrain==

The GT-R of the 1990s included a 2.6 L straight six-cylinder twin-turbo engine producing . The standard turbochargers were of a hybrid steel/ceramic design allowing them to spool up faster due to the light nature of the ceramic exhaust wheel.

The drive train delivered power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. This system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery to the front wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V•Spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added a hydraulic active limited-slip differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a mechanical open differential. Although it is not related to the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for &#x27;towing mode&#x27; as specified in the owners manual.

The car also had computer-controlled all wheel steering system referred to as HICAS. The HICAS system activated when the vehicle exceeded and controlled the steering of the rear wheels in the same direction as the front to improve turn in on entry to corners. This feature is often seen as more of a hindrance than help in race applications. The system tends to favor less experienced drivers, and can make the rear suspension unstable during high speed cornering.

While the published figures from Nissan were as quoted above, tests showed the car had a factory power output of closer to at the flywheel. The lower published figure was Nissan&#x27;s response to the need to abide by a gentleman&#x27;s agreement between the Japanese auto manufacturers not to introduce a car to the public exceeding of power output.

===N1 engines===
RB26DETT N1 is an upgraded version of the standard RB26DETT engine. It was developed by Nissan Kohki&#x27;s REINIK division for NISMO and N1 race cars. The standard RB26DETT, although known for its durability, proved to require too much maintenance for Group N (N1 class) racing conditions. REINIK started with a strengthened RB26DETT block. The N1 block is identified by its 24U number stamped on the block (05U standard blocks). The cylinder walls are thicker and water cooling channels are enhanced to increase flow. It also received an upgraded oil pump and water pump, to improve the cooling and lubrication for race conditions. The pistons have top rings and were balanced before assembly but otherwise very close to standard. The connecting rods are also similar to standard but made from slightly stronger material and balanced. Standard crankshaft is balanced to a higher level. Higher flow exhaust manifolds and turbochargers were added for increased torque and slightly higher top-end power. Turbine wheels on the N1 turbochargers are also made from steel for durability, rather than the lighter but weaker ceramic found on the standard turbine.

The R32 Skyline GT-R N1 road car marked the N1 engine&#x27;s introduction for sale to the public. R32, 33, and 34 N1 road cars were known for lack of amenities and their light weight. The R33 N1 engine and turbochargers were slightly revised, and the R34 N1 engine saw further improvement. The camshaft timing was altered slightly for more torque. R33 and R34 N1 turbochargers are the same size however R34 N1s use a ball bearing center section. NISMO states the ball bearings in the R34 N1 allow them to spool 400 rpm faster than R33 N1.

The final N1 engine is the R34 Nür engine. The only differences are the cam cover colour change from red to gold and R34 Nür edition was a fully loaded street car. There were 1,000 Nür engines made for use in the R34 V.spec II Nür and R34 M-spec Nür models.

==Motorsports==
The GT-R&#x27;s history of racetrack dominance began with its 50 victories scored from 1968 to 1972, including 49 consecutive wins in the Japanese race circuit. Nissan pulled out of racing shortly after the introduction of the KPGC110 due to the 1973 oil crisis.

The Skyline GT-R later earned the nickname &quot;Godzilla&quot;, as a play on its &quot;monster&quot; track performance and country of origin. The R32 GT-R dominated the Japanese Touring Car Championship, won all 29 races it entered in the series, as well as taking the series title every year from 1990 to 1993.

It took 50 races from 50 starts from 1991 to 1997 (latterly R33) in the N1 Super Taikyu. The GT-R&#x27;s success sounded the death knell of Group A Touring Car racing; with the formula being scrapped soon after. JTCC was similarly dominated by the R32 GT-R, and splintered soon after, leading to the switch to the Supertouring category and also indirectly to the GT500 category of today.

The GT-R&#x27;s success in motor racing was formidable, particularly in the annual race at the Mount Panorama circuit in Bathurst, Australia, where the winner in 1991 and 1992 was a GT-R (despite receiving additional in weight penalties and a turbo pressure relief valve in 1992, and crashing). It took the overall win of the 1991 Spa 24 Hours, after getting the pole position and fastest lap time, ahead of the Porsche 911 and BMW M3 Evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.racingsportscars.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It remained dominant in the Japanese GT series for many years. The Skyline GT-R was retired from the JGTC series (later changed Super GT Series) in 2004. Its successor, the Nissan GT-R, competed and dominated the 2008 Super GT season, winning the GT500 (see details below).

No other GT-R race victories escaped controversy. At the 1990 Macau Grand Prix Guia touring car race, the factory-backed R32, driven by Masahiro Hasemi, led the race from start to finish. The following year, officials forced the car to carry a weight penalty of . That year, it was also up against the more competitive DTM BMW M3 and Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5–16 Evolution II. A disgruntled Hasemi took fourth place. For the following and final year, the weight penalty was reduced, and works-backed Hasemi returned with another privateer R32. The privateer crashed, and Hasemi retired with engine failure.

In the UK, Andy Middlehurst took the Nissan Skyline GT-R (R32) to two consecutive championship wins in the National Saloon Car Cup. Other championship titles include the 1991 Australian Touring Car Championship (Jim Richards), the 1991 Australian Endurance Championship (Mark Gibbs &amp; Rowan Onslow), the 1991 Australian Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, the 1992 Australian Touring Car Championship (Mark Skaife) and the 1993 Spanish Touring Car Championship.

Janspeed provided three cars to race in Europe. One car to run for Andy Middlehurst in the UK in the National Touring Car Series.
In 1990 they entered three cars in the SPA-Francorchamps 24 hours. They managed a tremendous finish of one, two and three in class.
Three cars were entered to run in the SPA 24 hours in which it finished first and second in its class (Group N) in 1991. A GT-R Group A car also took first overall. 
In 1992 they finished second in Group N with the Group A entry retiring due to a pit fire.

Janspeed also ran a GT-R in the Spanish Touring Car Championship (CET). This car won the championship driven by Luis Pérez-Sala.

Akira Kameyama has taken the GT-R to the Pikes Peak International Hillclimb race on three occasion winning in each Open Class for production cars he entered, one in 1993 with the R32, another in 1996 with the R33 and again in 1998. For the following year, Rhys Millen took an R33 Skyline GT-R to win the High-Performance Showroom Stock category.

The GT-R debuted in the US at 1994 Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona. Nismo entered a sole Group A specification R32 for the GTU category. This car was so fast in the infield section in the first practice that the competition colluded to have restrictors fitted. The team was not allowed to run again until they fitted them. They eventually finished 20th. NISSAN was probably not too upset as they did not import the GT-R model to the USA. However, they did sell the 300ZX and it was one of those that won.

In 1995 Nismo developed the Skyline GT-R for endurance racing with a pair of JGTC specification R33s for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. These were not allowed to run a four-wheel drive. To meet homologation regulations, Nissan had to build at least one street-legal version with four-wheel drive removed. The two racing cars achieved some success at Le Mans, with one car placing tenth overall, and fifth in its GT1 class, class—beaten only by the more developed McLaren F1 GTRs and in overall standings by the GT2 class champion No. 84 Honda NSX entered by Team Kunimitsu. For , the Skyline GT-R LMs returned, this time carrying enlarged RB26DETTs displacing 2.8 litres. Again competing in GT1, they finished 15th overall and 10th in class. However, Nissan chose to abandon their production-based Skyline GT-R LMs in 1997 and instead turn to the purpose-built R390 GT1. In honour of the success of the Skyline at Le Mans, Nissan marketed a limited edition R33 they called the &quot;LM Limited&quot;, available only in &quot;Champion Blue&quot; (colour code BT2).

In 2006 Automotive Forums.com became the first team to compete with an R34 GT-R in the United States, participating in the Speed World Challenge GT series. Team: Driver and President of &quot;Automotive Forums.com&quot; Igor Sushko, Crew Chief Sean Morris, Team Manager Victor Reyes, Mechanic Josh Mitchell, and Engineer Merritt Johnson.

In 2007, the Heat Treatments Drag R32 Skyline GT-R driven by Reece McGregor of New Zealand, broke the world record for the fastest AWD over with a time of 7.57 seconds at at the Willowbank Dragway in Australia, a record previously held by the HKS R33 Skyline GT-R with a time of 7.67 seconds. Heat Treatments R32 has gone as quick as 7.53@185 mph.

On the same year at TOTB U.K Racing series, Keith Cowie and RB Motorsport&#x27;s GT-R BNR32 broke the fastest four-wheel drive record with a time of 12.47 seconds. The previous record holder was another GT-R, a BNR32 from Veilside Japan with 13.72 seconds during the early 90s.

In March 2015, the New Zealand tuning shop, R.I.P.S., set a new AWD record with their BNR32 &quot;RIPS MGAWOT III&quot;. It ran 7.32 seconds at .

In July 2020, Australian tuning company, Maatuoks Racing&#x27;s R32 GT-R broke the AWD quarter mile record. Car itself ran the quarter mile in 6.47 at 353.88 km/h (219.94 mph). Also became the fastest GT-R at the quarter mile by beating the ET-S R35 GT-R.

<text>In mathematics, the probabilistic method is a nonconstructive method, primarily used in combinatorics and pioneered by Paul Erdős, for proving the existence of a prescribed kind of mathematical object. It works by showing that if one randomly chooses objects from a specified class, the probability that the result is of the prescribed kind is strictly greater than zero. Although the proof uses probability, the final conclusion is determined for &quot;certain&quot;, without any possible error.

This method has now been applied to other areas of mathematics such as number theory, linear algebra, and real analysis, as well as in computer science (e.g. randomized rounding), and information theory.

==Introduction==
If every object in a collection of objects fails to have a certain property, then the probability that a random object chosen from the collection has that property is zero.

Similarly, showing that the probability is (strictly) less than 1 can be used to prove the existence of an object that does &quot;not&quot; satisfy the prescribed properties.

Another way to use the probabilistic method is by calculating the expected value of some random variable. If it can be shown that the random variable can take on a value less than the expected value, this proves that the random variable can also take on some value greater than the expected value.

Alternatively, the probabilistic method can also be used to guarantee the existence of a desired element in a sample space with a value that is greater than or equal to the calculated expected value, since the non-existence of such element would imply every element in the sample space is less than the expected value, a contradiction.

Common tools used in the probabilistic method include Markov&#x27;s inequality, the Chernoff bound, and the Lovász local lemma.

==Two examples due to Erdős==
Although others before him proved theorems via the probabilistic method (for example, Szele&#x27;s 1943 result that there exist tournaments containing a large number of Hamiltonian cycles), many of the most well known proofs using this method are due to Erdős. The first example below describes one such result from 1947 that gives a proof of a lower bound for the Ramsey number .

===First example===
Suppose we have a complete graph on vertices. We wish to show (for small enough values of ) that it is possible to color the edges of the graph in two colors (say red and blue) so that there is no complete subgraph on vertices which is monochromatic (every edge colored the same color).

To do so, we color the graph randomly. Color each edge independently with probability of being red and of being blue. We calculate the expected number of monochromatic subgraphs on vertices as follows:

For any set formula_1 of formula_2 vertices from our graph, define the variable formula_3 to be if every edge amongst the formula_2 vertices is the same color, and otherwise. Note that the number of monochromatic formula_2-subgraphs is the sum of formula_3 over all possible subsets formula_1. For any individual set formula_8, the expected value of formula_9 is simply the probability that all of the formula_10 edges in formula_8 are the same color:

:formula_12

(the factor of comes because there are two possible colors).

This holds true for any of the formula_13 possible subsets we could have chosen, i.e. formula_14 ranges from to formula_15. So we have that the sum of formula_16 over all formula_8 is

:formula_18

The sum of expectations is the expectation of the sum (&quot;regardless&quot; of whether the variables are independent), so the expectation of the sum (the expected number of all monochromatic formula_2-subgraphs) is

:formula_20

Consider what happens if this value is less than . Since the expected number of monochromatic -subgraphs is strictly less than , there exists a coloring satisfying the condition that the number of monochromatic -subgraphs is strictly less than . The number of monochromatic -subgraphs in this random coloring is a non-negative integer, hence it must be ( is the only non-negative integer less than ). It follows that if

:formula_21

(which holds, for example, for and ), there must exist a coloring in which there are no monochromatic -subgraphs. &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, there must be at least one coloring which is not &#x27;bad&#x27; for any subgraph.

By definition of the Ramsey number, this implies that must be bigger than . In particular, must grow at least exponentially with .

A weakness of this argument is that it is entirely nonconstructive. Even though it proves (for example) that almost every coloring of the complete graph on vertices contains no monochromatic -subgraph, it gives no explicit example of such a coloring. The problem of finding such a coloring has been open for more than 50 years.

===Second example===
A 1959 paper of Erdős (see reference cited below) addressed the following problem in graph theory: given positive integers and , does there exist a graph containing only cycles of length at least , such that the chromatic number of is at least ?

It can be shown that such a graph exists for any and , and the proof is reasonably simple. Let be very large and consider a random graph on vertices, where every edge in exists with probability . We show that with positive probability, satisfies the following two properties:

:Property 1. contains at most cycles of length less than .

Proof. Let be the number cycles of length less than . The number of cycles of length in the complete graph on vertices is

:formula_22

and each of them is present in with probability . Hence by Markov&#x27;s inequality we have

:formula_23
: Thus for sufficiently large , property 1 holds with a probability of more than .

:Property 2. contains no independent set of size formula_24.

Proof. Let be the size of the largest independent set in . Clearly, we have

:formula_25
when

:formula_26 Thus, for sufficiently large , property 2 holds with a probability of more than .

For sufficiently large , the probability that a graph from the distribution has both properties is positive, as the events for these properties cannot be disjoint (if they were, their probabilities would sum up to more than 1).

Here comes the trick: since has these two properties, we can remove at most vertices from to obtain a new graph on formula_27 vertices that contains only cycles of length at least . We can see that this new graph has no independent set of size formula_28. can only be partitioned into at least independent sets, and, hence, has chromatic number at least .

This result gives a hint as to why the computation of the chromatic number of a graph is so difficult: even when there are no local reasons (such as small cycles) for a graph to require many colors the chromatic number can still be arbitrarily large.

<doc id="173532" wikidata="Q1424943" url="?curid=173532" title="Henry Vane the Younger">
<text>Sir Henry Vane (baptised 26 March 161314 June 1662), often referred to as Harry Vane and Henry Vane the Younger to distinguish him from his father, Henry Vane the Elder, was an English politician, statesman, and colonial governor. He was briefly present in North America, serving one term as the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and supported the creation of Roger Williams&#x27; Rhode Island Colony and Harvard College. A proponent of religious tolerance, as governor, he defended Anne Hutchinson and her right to teach religious topics in her home which put him in direct conflict with the Puritan leaders in the Massachusetts Colony. He returned to England after losing re-election and eventually, Hutchinson was banned from the colony.

He was a leading Parliamentarian during the English Civil War and worked closely with Oliver Cromwell. He played no part in the execution of King Charles I, and refused to take oaths that expressed approval of the act. Vane served on the Council of State that functioned as the government executive during the Interregnum, but split with Cromwell over issues of governance and removed himself from power when Cromwell dissolved Parliament in 1653. He returned to power during the short-lived Commonwealth period from 1659–1660. His fight for government reform, a constitution, and civil and religious liberties made him a man &quot;too dangerous to let live&quot; in King Charles II&#x27;s view. As such, he was arrested under orders from Charles II following his restoration to the throne. After a long debate, Vane was exempted from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, and was thus denied the amnesty granted to most people for their roles in the Civil War and Interregnum.

Although he was formally granted clemency by Charles II, he was indicted for high treason by a Middlesex grand jury after charges were presented by the king&#x27;s attorney general, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, in 1662. In a court proceeding in which he was denied counsel and the opportunity to properly prepare a defence, he was convicted by a Royalist jury. Charles withdrew his earlier clemency, and Vane was beheaded on Tower Hill on 14 June 1662.

Vane was recognised by his political peers as a competent administrator and a wily and persuasive negotiator and politician. His politics was driven by a desire for religious tolerance in an era when governments were used to establish official churches and suppress dissenting views. Although his views were in a small minority, he was able to successfully build coalitions to advance his agenda. His actions contributed to both the rise and downfall of the English Commonwealth. His books and pamphlets written on political and religious subjects are still analysed today. His writing &quot;A Healing Question&quot; advocated for a constitutional convention pre-dating the American Constitutional Convention by over a century. Vane is remembered in Massachusetts and Rhode Island as an early champion of freedom.

The New England Historical and Genealogical Society wrote of him in 1848:
Those who have been accustomed to view Roger Williams in his true character, – a great and wonderful man, a pioneer in establishing religious and consequently political liberty, – must accord the same virtues to Sir Henry Vane. It is true, the latter did not lay down his life here in our land, nor was he compelled to fly to the wilderness to enjoy his opinions; but he did die for them, when and where the greatest good would accrue to the world. If Roger Williams deserves all the praise and admiration from posterity which he now has, and which are sure to increase in all future time, Sir Henry Vane certainly deserves no less.

==Early life==

Henry Vane was baptised on 26 May 1613 at Debden, Essex. He was the eldest child of Sir Henry Vane the Elder, who came from the landed gentry, and Frances Darcy, who came from minor nobility. The elder Vane used the family&#x27;s money to purchase positions at court, rising by 1629 to be Comptroller of the Household. Vane was educated at Westminster School, where his classmates included Arthur Heselrige and Thomas Scot, two other men who would figure prominently in English politics. Vane&#x27;s friend and biographer, George Sikes, wrote that Vane was &quot;[ignorant] of God&quot; and of a temperament that made him &quot;acceptable to those they call good fellows&quot;, but that he had a religious awakening at 14 or 15, after which he &quot;and his former jolly company came to a parting blow.&quot; Vane then enrolled at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where he studied in spite of his refusal to take the necessary matriculation oaths. He then travelled to Europe, where he was reported to be studying at Leiden and possibly in France and at Geneva.

Vane&#x27;s father had been upset by his open adoption of Puritan views, fearing this would hamper his opportunities for advancement at court. In 1631 he sent the young Vane to Vienna as an assistant to Robert Anstruther, the English ambassador. This was apparently a quite privileged role, for Vane&#x27;s writings of the time include messages written in French and in cipher.

During this trip the elder Vane was sent to negotiate with Swedish king Gustavus for an alliance; King Charles&#x27; unwillingness to act in the matter meant the effort was in vain. He was introduced to the king after returning to England, and encouraged by his father to seek a position in the privy chamber. His father engaged in numerous attempts to get him to give up his nonconformist views, without success. In order to worship as he chose, Vane then decided to go the New World, joining the Puritan migration.

==New England==
Vane left for the Massachusetts Bay Colony, arriving in Boston in October 1635 on a ship also carrying John Winthrop the Younger and Hugh Peter. The elder John Winthrop described Vane as &quot;a young gentleman of excellent parts&quot;, and by the following month he had already been admitted as a freeman in the colony. He began playing a role in its judicial administration, deciding whether legal disputes had sufficient merit to be heard by a full court. Vane was instrumental in brokering the resolution to a dispute between the elder Winthrop and Thomas Dudley concerning matters of judicial conduct. In May 1636 Vane was elected governor of the colony, succeeding John Haynes. The situation he faced was complex, with issues on religious, political and military fronts and as a young man of twenty-three years, he was ill-prepared.
The colony was split over the actions and beliefs of Anne Hutchinson. She had come with her husband and children to the colony in 1634. During Vane&#x27;s time as governor, she began holding Bible sessions at home, gaining a wide audience and sharing her opinions that the colonial leaders labelled as Antinomianism, the view that existing laws and practices were not necessary for salvation. Most of the older colonial leadership, including Dudley and Winthrop, espoused a more legalistic view. Vane was a supporter of Hutchinson and attended her Bible studies, as was at first the influential pastor John Cotton. Vane, however, immediately alienated some of the colonists by insisting on flying the English flag over Boston&#x27;s fort. The flag had recently been the subject of controversy, since its depiction of the Cross of St George was seen by many colonists as a symbol of papacy, and John Endecott had notoriously cut the cross out of the Salem militia&#x27;s flag. Vane&#x27;s popularity declined further when he learnt in December 1636 that there were issues in England requiring his presence, and he attempted to resign. Although the court of assistants accepted his resignation, he withdrew it upon the request of the congregation of the Boston church.

During Vane&#x27;s tenure a dispute with the Pequot tribe of present-day southeastern Connecticut boiled over into war. In 1636 the boat of a Massachusetts trader named John Oldham was found near Block Island, overrun by Indians. Further examination by the discoverers (after the Indians fled in canoes) uncovered Oldham&#x27;s body on board. The attackers were at the time believed to be from tribes affiliated with the Narragansetts, but Narragansett leaders claimed that those responsible had fled to the protection of the Pequots. The Pequots were aggressively expansionist in their dealings with the surrounding native tribes (including the Narragansett), but had until then generally kept the peace with the nearby colonists. Massachusetts authorities were already angry that the Pequots had failed to turn over men implicated in the killing of another trader on the Connecticut River; the slaying of Oldham led to calls for action.

Despite the fact that Roger Williams had warned him that the Narragansetts were more likely responsible for Oldham&#x27;s slaying, Governor Vane in August 1636 placed John Endecott at the head of a 90-man force to extract justice from the Pequots. Endecott&#x27;s heavy-handed expedition did little more than destroy Pequot settlements, and sparked a military backlash. The Pequots struck back at settlements recently established on the Connecticut River by colonists from Massachusetts, and at the Saybrook Colony of the younger John Winthrop. In April 1637, Vane called a session of the general court that authorised the colonial militia to assist the other New England colonies in continuing the war.
Vane lost his position to the elder John Winthrop in the 1637 election. The contentious election was marked by a sharp disagreement over the treatment of John Wheelwright, another Hutchinson supporter. Winthrop won in part because the location of the vote was moved to Cambridge, reducing the power of Vane&#x27;s Boston support. In the aftermath of the election Anne Hutchinson was put on trial, and eventually banished from the colony. Many of her followers seriously considered leaving after the election. At the urging of Roger Williams, some of these people, including Hutchinson, founded the settlement of Portsmouth on Aquidneck Island in the Narragansett Bay (later named Rhode Island and joined to Providence to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations). Vane decided to return to England. Biographer Henry Ireland argued in 1905, &quot;Had he remained in New England, his enlightened mind and humane spirit would have held the Puritans back from the executions of witches and persecutions of other heretics which have added a dark chapter the early history of the States.&quot; Before his departure, he published &quot;A Brief Answer to a Certain Declaration&quot;, a response to Winthrop&#x27;s defence of the Act of Exclusion; this act was passed after the election to restrict the immigration of people with views not conforming to the colony&#x27;s religious orthodoxy.

Despite their political differences, Vane and Winthrop developed an epistolary relationship in the following years. Vane&#x27;s legacy from his time in the New World includes the colonial legislation appropriating £400 for the establishment of an institute of higher learning now known as Harvard University, and his support of Roger Williams in the acquisition of Aquidneck Island from the local Indians that resulted in the formal beginnings of Rhode Island. The surviving accounts do not say that Vane provide the funds for the acquisition; Williams credits Vane as being &quot;an instrument in the hand of God for procuring this island&quot;.

According to historian Michael Winship, Vane&#x27;s experiences in Massachusetts significantly radicalized his religious views, in which he came to believe that clergy of all types, including Puritan ministers, &quot;were the second beast of Revelations 13:11&quot;, &quot;pretending to visible Saintship&quot;. This conviction drove his political activities in England, where he sought to minimise the power and influence of all types of clergy. Biographer Violet Rowe writes that &quot;Vane&#x27;s guiding principles in religious policy seem to have been two: a rooted distrust of clerical power, whether of bishops or presbyters, and a belief that the State should abstain from interference in church matters altogether.&quot;

Vane&#x27;s stance can be seen in the way the first Rhode Island patent was drafted in 1643, when he sat on the Parliamentary committee charged with colonial affairs. Unique among all of the early English colonial charters, it contains provisions guaranteeing freedom of religion. (Vane assisted Roger Williams again in 1652, when the latter sought a confirmation of the Rhode Island charter and the revocation of a conflicting charter that had been issued to William Coddington.)

==Return to England==
On his return to England, he procured, with the assistance of the Earl of Northumberland and his father, a position as Treasurer of the Royal Navy in 1639. In this position he had the personally distasteful yet highly profitable task of collecting the hated ship money (a tax to support the Navy imposed by Charles I without Parliamentary approval). In June 1640 he was awarded a knighthood by King Charles. He married Frances Wray, daughter of Sir Christopher Wray, on 1 July 1640, after which his father settled upon him most of the family&#x27;s holdings. These included Fairlawn in Kent, and Raby Castle, where Vane would make his home. According to his biographers, the relationship with Frances was anchored by shared spiritual goals and intimacy, and was happy and fulfilling.

The connection with the admiralty secured for him election to the Short and Long Parliaments representing Hull. Vane had already formed or renewed associations with prominent opponents of Charles&#x27; policies, including John Pym and John Hampden. In the Short Parliament he was noted to be &quot;capable of managing great affairs&quot;, with a &quot;penetrating judgment&quot; and an &quot;easy and graceful manner of speaking.&quot; With others like Nathaniel Fiennes, he represented a younger generation of Puritans in the leadership of the Long Parliament that effectively managed affairs: as identified by Clarendon in his history, these included Hampden, Pym, and Oliver St John in the Commons, and Earl of Bedford and Viscount Saye and Sele in the Lords.

Vane was instrumental in the 1641 impeachment and execution of the Earl of Strafford, a member of the Privy Council. Vane discovered some confidential notes his father had made of a council meeting, and passed them to John Pym. The wording in those notes could be interpreted to mean that Strafford had proposed that Charles use the Irish Army to subjugate England. The evidence against Strafford was weak, and the impeachment failed. Pym consequently orchestrated the passage of a bill of attainder against Strafford, who was then executed in May 1641. The illicit means by which Pym acquired the notes caused a rift between the Vanes that healed only when the elder Vane eventually came to oppose the king.

In the &quot;Root and Branch&quot; petition debate in the Commons, from December 1640 and into 1641, Vane supported, as did Nathaniel Fiennes, the call for radical reforms in the Church of England, a position that put Vane in opposition to his father. Amid a sea of complaints about church governance, he and Fiennes in February 1641 were added to a committee that had been established the previous November to draft a report on the state of the kingdom. Their efforts led Vane to introduce the Root and Branch Bill in May 1641. The debate on the bill was acrimonious, and resulted in a clear indication of parliamentary support for church reform. In its wake mobs invaded churches, removing &quot;scandalous images&quot; and other signs of &quot;popery&quot;. Vane made an impassioned speech that brought him to the front of his faction, claiming episcopacy (the governing structure of the Church of England) was a corrupt doctrine &quot;hastening us back again to Rome.&quot; The bill died without a vote in August, when more critical matters arose to occupy Parliament. When Charles went to Scotland to rally Scottish forces to the royalist cause, the Commons began drafting what became known as the Grand Remonstrance. Many historians have claimed Vane had a role in drafting some of its language; this matter is disputed, but either way Vane did not participate in the debate. Narrowly passed by the Commons in November 1641, the document catalogued many grievances against the king and church, and served to further polarize political affairs. The king refused to enact any of the requested reforms. Upon his return from Scotland, the king also deprived both Vanes, father and son, of their administrative posts, in revenge for their roles in the execution of Strafford.

==Civil War==
===Early years===

In the first six months of 1642, relations between the king and Parliament broke down completely, and factions supporting both sides took up arms. Parliament returned Vane to his post as Treasurer of the Navy, where he used connections to bring significant naval support to the Parliamentary side after Charles attempted to arrest five MPs on charges of high treason in December 1641. In June 1642, Charles rejected the Nineteen Propositions, the last substantive set of demands made by Parliament prior to the outbreak of the First English Civil War. After hostilities began that June with the siege of Hull, Vane was given a seat on the Committee of Safety, which oversaw Parliamentary military activities.
After the failure of the Root and Branch Bill, Parliament in 1643 called together the Westminster Assembly of Divines, a body of lay politicians, lords, and clergy whose purpose was to reform church governance. Vane sat on this body, which met periodically until 1648, as one of the lay representatives of the Independent faction. Not long after its first meeting in July, Vane was sent at the head of a Parliamentary commission seeking military assistance from the Scots. The Scots, who had been opposed to Charles in the Bishop&#x27;s Wars (1639–40) over religious issues, were willing to assist the English Parliament if the latter were willing to allow the extension of the Presbyterian system of church polity to England. Vane was opposed to both Presbyterianism and Episcopalianism, but found a way to finesse an agreement. He proposed that the agreement, which covered a combination of religious and political topics, be called the &quot;Solemn League and Covenant&quot;, and he introduced slippery language into the agreement concerning &quot;the example of the best Reformed churches&quot;. This language permitted the Scots to believe that their ideas would be adopted, while the English could interpret it to mean that English (i.e. Independent) practices could be adopted. The league and covenant were eventually approved by authorities in Scotland, England, and Ireland, and paved the way for Scottish entry into the war.

Following Vane&#x27;s success in negotiating the Scottish agreement, the death of John Pym at the end of 1643 propelled Vane into the leadership of Parliament, along with Oliver St John, Henry Marten, and Arthur Heselrige. He promoted, and became a chief member of, the Committee of Both Kingdoms, established in February 1644 as a point were English and Scottish authorities could coordinate war activities. Vane was then sent to York in June 1644, then besieged by three Parliament armies, to urge Sir Thomas Fairfax and the Earl of Manchester to divert some of those forces to face Prince Rupert of the Rhine, who had recently taken Liverpool and was pillaging properties of Parliamentary supporters in Lancashire. While there he also proposed to the generals the establishment of a government which would depose Charles I and crown the Prince to make him King. This idea was roundly rejected by the old guard generals who believed Charles could still be accommodated, but found support with the rising star of Oliver Cromwell.

On 13 September 1644 Vane acted with St John and Cromwell in the Commons to set up a &quot;Grand Committee for the Accommodation&quot;, designed to find a compromise on religious issues dividing the Westminster Assembly. He sought in its debate to identify loopholes for religious tolerance on behalf of the Independents. This exposed Vane&#x27;s opposition to Presbyterianism, and created a rift between the pro-war Independents, led by Vane and Cromwell, and the pro-peace Scots and other supporters of Presbyterianism. The latter included the Earl of Essex, whose failures in the west of England reduced popular support for his cause, even as the military success of Cromwell at Marston Moor raised his profile.

Robert Baillie, on the realisation that the Parliamentary Independents, despite previous claims of support by Vane, were not on the side of the Scots, wrote &quot;Sir Henry Vane and The Solicitor [St John]... without any regard for us, who have saved their nation and brought their two persons to the height of power now they enjoy and use to our prejudice&quot;.

===Parliamentary victory===
Overtures for peace talks were begun in November 1644 between king and Parliament. Vane was one of many negotiators sent to Uxbridge in a failed attempt to negotiate peace. Vane and the Independents were seen by some as a principal reason for the failure of these talks, because the Scots and Charles were prepared to agree on issues of church polity and doctrine and the Independents were not. The talks, which lasted from late January through most of February 1645, were overshadowed by the execution after impeachment by attainder of Archbishop Laud.

John Lilburne was known as a passionate fanatic who advocated for expanded civil rights, including the destruction of the aristocracy, and Parliament, thus he was a critic of the Commonwealth. Parliament began discussing a reorganisation of its military as early as November 1644, in part to remove some poorly-performing commanders, and to eliminate the regional character of the existing forces. In debate that principally divided the Commons from the Lords, Vane and Cromwell supported passage of the Self-denying Ordinance, forbidding military officers from serving in Parliament, and the establishment of the New Model Army, which would be capable of fighting anywhere in the country. The provisions of the Self-denying Ordinance also extended to individuals (like Vane) who held civil service posts, but included exceptions for those (like Vane) who had been turned out office by Charles and restored by Parliament.

Following the decisive Parliamentary victory at Naseby in June 1645, the first phase of the civil war was effectively over, but it dragged on for another year, before Charles surrendered to Scottish army commanders.

During this time, a new political faction began to rise within the military. Known as Levellers and led by John Lilburne and others, this populist force was in favour of greater press freedoms, and was opposed to at least some of the privileges of the aristocracy, including the existence of the House of Lords.

In January 1646, amid ongoing peace negotiations, Charles attempted to separate the Independents from other factions by proposing in letters to Vane an alliance with his faction against the Presbyterians. Vane was not amused by this, and responded by pointing out that he preferred the rights of &quot;tender consciences&quot; to be granted by Parliament rather than by the duplicitous king (papers exposing the king&#x27;s negotiating positions as facades had been captured at Naseby, and had largely silenced the Royalist elements in Parliament).

Beginning in the summer of 1645, Raby Castle was ravaged by Scots royalists. In September 1645, the Vanes succeeded in getting Parliamentary approval to fortify Raby. During the war, Vane&#x27;s father reported that Raby Castle had been &quot;visited four times&quot;, suffering damages of £16,000. Vane withheld the return of treasury fees beginning in 1645 for two and half years until the same £16,000 suffered at Raby accumulated.

===Interwar politics===

By the end of the war the Presbyterian group in the Commons, led by Denzil Holles, William Strode, and Sir Philip Stapleton, was slightly stronger than the Independents. They proceeded to introduce legislation hostile to the views on religious tolerance held by Vane and Independents in the army. Vane apparently came to realise that the Presbyterian actions posed a threat equal to that of the Episcopalians, and that military action, having sidelined the latter, might also work against the former. The Independents attempted to negotiate terms favourable to them with Charles, but these were unsuccessful.

In 1647 Vane and Oliver Cromwell, the leader of the army&#x27;s Independents, came to work closely together. The Presbyterian majority sought to disband the army to reduce the threat of those Independents, but issues over pay (which was in arrears), widows&#x27; pensions, and other grievances, prompted the Presbyterians to enter into negotiations with the army. Cromwell was eventually able to appease the army, but a Parliamentary purge of Independent officers followed, and the army was ordered to disband. Some Parliamentary leaders also began negotiating with the Scots for the return of their army, this time to oppose the English army.

The Parliament army mutinied, and under Cromwell&#x27;s orders (possibly prompted by a warning from Vane) a detachment of troops seized Charles, who had been placed under a comfortable house arrest at Holmby. This forced the Presbyterian leadership to meet the army&#x27;s demands for pay. They also established a commission to treat with the army, on which they placed Vane, presumably because of his influence with the military.

The negotiations between the army and Parliament were acrimonious. Mobs in Presbyterian-dominated London threatened Vane and other Independents. More than 50 Independent MPs, Vane among them, fled the city on 2 August for the protection of the army. The army then marched on London, with Vane and others at its head, and the Independents were again seated in Parliament. The Parliament then debated the army&#x27;s &quot;Heads of Proposals&quot; for fixing the term and powers of Parliament and church governance. Key among its terms of interest to Vane was one that effectively stripped the church, either Episcopal or Presbyterian, of any coercive powers. The &quot;Heads of Proposals&quot; was also sent to Charles, who indicated agreement to some of its terms and opposition to others, and proposed further negotiations.

The king&#x27;s proposal split the Independents between those, such as Vane and Cromwell, who were willing to negotiate with the king, and those who were not. Reverend Hugh Peter spoke out in favour of the &quot;non-addresses&quot; (i.e. no longer negotiating with the king). In November 1647, while the debate continued, Charles escaped his confinement at Hampton Court and made his way to the Isle of Wight. There he was recaptured and imprisoned in Carisbrook Castle. Offered proposals by the Scots and the Independents, he chose alliance with the Scots. Sectional violence between royalists, Presbyterians, and Independents, spread throughout the country, although the army maintained a tenuous peace in London.

===War renewed===

Violence flared throughout the country as the various factions armed and organised. A mutiny in the Royal Navy in May thrust Vane into attempts to prevent it from spreading, and to regain the support of the mutineers, who had declared for Charles. By mid-July, the army had regained control of most of England, and Cromwell defeated the Scottish army in August at the Battle of Preston. In the tumult, Vane appeared at times to be in opposition to some of the Independent factions, even having a falling out (quickly healed) with Cromwell, and many factions came to distrust him. Despite this he was one of the Parliamentary representatives for negotiations with Charles at Newport in September 1648. He was widely blamed for the failure of those negotiations over his insistence on &quot;an unbounded liberty of conscience&quot;.


In the debates of late 1648 concerning the king&#x27;s fate, Vane argued that the Parliament should constitute a government without the king &quot;to make themselves the happiest nation and people in the world.&quot; His forceful speech on 2 December suggesting that the king would need to be eliminated as a political force was opposed by others, including Nathaniel Fiennes, who claimed that the concessions the king had made to date were sufficient that an agreement might be reached. Others suggested that rather than dividing the house by opposition to the king, it be divided by separating those who had gained in the war from those who had not, and that financial contributions be made from one group to the other. After an impassioned conciliatory speech by William Prynne, Parliament finally voted on 5 December that the king&#x27;s concessions were sufficient.

On 6 December, the military stepped in to take control of matters. Troops led by Thomas Pride surrounded the Houses of Parliament, and systematically arrested arriving MPs who had been supportive of negotiation with the king. Vane did not appear that day; either he was aware of what was going to happen, or he may have stayed away because his side had lost the vote. This action, known as &quot;Pride&#x27;s Purge&quot;, resulted in the exclusion of more than 140 MPs.

The Parliament that sat became known as the Rump Parliament, and its first main order of business was the trial and execution of King Charles. During this process Vane refused to attend Parliament, although he was present as a spectator when the trial began on 20 January 1649. He later claimed to oppose putting the king on trial because of &quot;tenderness of blood&quot;, and continued to fulfil the duties of his government posts, signing admiralty papers on the day Charles was executed.

==The Commonwealth and Oliver Cromwell==
After the execution of Charles, the House of Commons voted to abolish both the crown and the House of Lords. To replace the executive functions of the crown, it established a Council of State to which Vane was appointed. He refused to be seated until he could do so without taking any oath, in particular the first one, which required an expression of approval for the regicide. Vane served on many of the council&#x27;s committees. On 1 August 1650 he was named president of the first Commission of Trade established by an Act of Parliament. The commission&#x27;s instructions were to consider, both domestic and foreign trade, the trading companies, manufactures, free ports, customs, excise, statistics, coinage and exchange, and fisheries, but also the plantations and the best means of promoting their welfare and rendering them useful to England. This act&#x27;s statesmanlike and comprehensive instructions, along with an October act prohibiting trade with pro-royalist colonies and the first Navigation Act of the following year, formed the first definitive expression of England&#x27;s commercial policy.

In his role on committees overseeing the military he directed the provisioning of supplies for Cromwell&#x27;s conquest of Ireland. As a leading member of the committee overseeing the navy (where he was joined by schoolmate Thomas Scot), he directed affairs in the naval First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–1654). Milton addressed an admiring sonnet to him in summer 1652. After the navy&#x27;s disastrous performance against the Dutch in 1652, Vane headed the committee that reformed the navy, drafting new Articles of War and formally codifying naval law. Vane&#x27;s reforms were instrumental in the navy&#x27;s successes later in the war. He was also involved in foreign diplomacy, going on a mission to France (whose purpose is unknown) in 1652 to meet with Cardinal de Retz, and travelling again to Scotland to organise the government there after Cromwell&#x27;s victories in the Third English Civil War.

Vane was also active in domestic affairs. He sat on a committee that disposed of Charles I&#x27;s art collection, and made many enemies in his role on the committees for Compounding and Sequestration. These committees, on which Vane had also sat in the 1640s, were responsible for the distribution of assets seized from royalists and other government opponents, and for negotiating with those who had failed to pay taxes and other government charges. Some of the enemies he made while engaged in this work would one day sit in judgment against him.

The process by which the Parliament carried out the duties of the executive was cumbersome, and this became an issue with Cromwell and the army, who sought the ability to act more decisively. This attitude drove a wedge between Cromwell and Vane. Under pressure from Cromwell for new elections, the Parliament began to consider proposals for electoral reform. In January 1653 a committee headed by Vane made one such proposal. It called for suffrage to be allowed on the basis of property ownership, and it sought specifically to eliminate some so-called &quot;rotten boroughs&quot;, which had small numbers of voters and were controlled by wealthy patrons. The proposal also called for some of the current members, whose republican credentials were deemed suitable, to retain their seats, so that the fledgling commonwealth might, as Harry Marten put it, be shepherded by &quot;the mother that brought it forth&quot;. This latter clause was proposed specifically at the urging of the army by Vane, who realised that those who were charged with its implementation would be able to retain power. However, Cromwell, seeking a general election, was opposed to this scheme, and the two sides were unable to reconcile.

Although Parliamentary leaders, Vane among them, had promised Cromwell on 19 April 1653 to delay action on the election bill, Vane was likely one of the ringleaders who sought to have the bill enacted the next day before Cromwell could react. Cromwell was however alerted by a supporter, and interrupted the proceedings that would otherwise have passed the bill. Bringing troops into the chamber, he put an end to the debate, saying &quot;You are no Parliament. I say you are no Parliament. I will put an end to your sitting.&quot; Vane protested, &quot;This is not honest; yea, it is against morality and common honesty&quot;, to which Cromwell shouted in response, &quot;O Sir Henry Vane, Sir Henry Vane; the Lord deliver me from Sir Henry Vane!&quot; This ended the commonwealth, and Cromwell began to rule as Lord Protector. Vane, &quot;daily missed and courted for his assistance&quot;, was invited to sit on Cromwell&#x27;s council, but refused.

Effectively in retirement, Vane wrote the &quot;Retired Man&#x27;s Meditations&quot;, published in 1655, this work, a jargon-laden religious treatise in which Vane wanders between literal and symbolic interpretation of Biblical scriptures, was treated by contemporaries and later analysts, including David Hume, as &quot;absolutely unintelligible&quot; and &quot;cloudily formed&quot;. The same year, after Cromwell called for a fast day to consider methods by which his government might be improved, Vane wrote &quot;A Healing Question&quot;. In this more carefully structured political work, he proposed a new form of government based on a constitution decided by men attending a constitutional convention. He was encouraged to publish it by Charles Fleetwood, who had shown it to Cromwell. In a postscript to the work Vane wrote the words &quot;the good old cause&quot;, a coinage that became a rallying cry in the next few years for Vane&#x27;s group of republicans.
&quot;A Healing Question&quot; was seen by John Thurloe, Cromwell&#x27;s Secretary of State, as a thinly-veiled attack on Cromwell, and its publication prompted a number of opposition political groups to step up their activities. Rumours circulated that protests raised by fringe religious groups like the Anabaptists and Quakers were due to Vane&#x27;s involvement, prompting Cromwell&#x27;s council to issue an order on 29 July 1656, summoning Vane to appear. Vane was ordered to post a bond of £5,000 &quot;to do nothing to the prejudice of the present government and the peace of the Commonwealth&quot;, but refused. He was arrested shortly afterward and imprisoned in Carisbrooke Castle. While there he addressed a letter to Cromwell in which he repudiated the extra-parliamentary authority Cromwell had assumed. Vane was released, still unrepentant, on 31 December 1656.

During Vane&#x27;s retirement he established a religious teaching group, which resulted in a group of admirers known as &quot;Vanists&quot;. He also cultivated pamphleteers and other surrogates to promote his political views. Henry Stubbe, introduced to Vane by Westminster head Richard Busby, became a supporter, and defended him in his &quot;Essay in Defence of the Good Old Cause&quot;, and in &quot;Malice Rebuked&quot; (1659).

==Richard Cromwell and after==
Following Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s death in September 1658, his son Richard succeeded him as Lord Protector. The younger Cromwell lacked the political and military skills of his father, and the political factionalism of the earlier Commonwealth began to resurface. When elections were called for a new parliament in December 1658, Cromwell attempted to prevent the election of both royalists and republicans. Vane, as a leader of the republican faction, was specifically targeted, but managed to win election representing Whitchurch. In the parliament&#x27;s session, the republicans questioned Cromwell&#x27;s claim to power, argued in favour of limiting it, and spoke against the veto power of the Cromwellian House of Lords, which was packed with supporters of the protector. The republicans were unsuccessful in enacting any substantive changes.

Vane formed an alliance with a group of republican military officers known as the Wallingford House party, who met secretly in violation of laws enacted to limit military participation in political matters. The Cromwellian factions in the parliament overreached in their attempts to control republican sentiment in the military, and Cromwell was forced to dissolve the parliament in April 1659. Cromwell, with little support in the military, abdicated several days later. Following a purge of pro-Cromwell supporters from the military and a widespread pamphleteering campaign, Cromwell&#x27;s council recalled the Rump Parliament in May.

In the reconstituted Rump Parliament, Vane was appointed to the new council of state. He also served as commissioner for the appointment of army officers, managed foreign affairs, and examined the state of the government&#x27;s finances, which were found to be in dismal condition. Through his work General John Lambert was sent to quell Booth&#x27;s Rebellion, a royalist uprising in August 1659. Lambert&#x27;s support of non-mainstream religious views like Quakerism, however, ensured his political downfall. After he and other officers were stripped of their command by Parliament in October, they rallied their troops and marched on Parliament, forcibly dissolving it. A committee of safety was formed, composed of the army grandees, and including Vane and Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke. He agreed to serve in part because he feared the republican cause was destined to fail without army support. This committee served only until December, but Vane played a vital role in trying to stop Vice Admiral Lawson from blockading London with some twenty-two ships. He negotiated with Lawson and when he couldn&#x27;t stop the planned blockade, he informed the Committee of Safety. When the advance of General George Monck&#x27;s army from Scotland led to the melting away of Lambert&#x27;s military support, General Charles Fleetwood was forced to turn over the keys to Parliament House to the Speaker which led to the restoration of the full Long Parliament. For taking part in the committee of safety, Vane was expelled (over vocal objections from allies like Heselrige) from the Commons, and ordered into house arrest at Raby Castle. He went to Raby in February 1660, but stayed there only briefly and eventually returned to his house at Hampstead.
During the tumultuous year of the late 1650s proposals for how the government should be structured and how powers should be balanced were widely debated, in private, in public debates in Parliament, and through the publication of pamphlets. Vane used all of these methods to promote his ideas. In 1660 he published &quot;A Needful Corrective or Balance in Popular Government&quot;. This open letter was essentially a response to James Harrington&#x27;s &quot;The Commonwealth of Oceana&quot;, a 1656 treatise describing Harrington&#x27;s view of a utopian government, which included limitations on property ownership and a legislature with an elected upper chamber. Harrington&#x27;s thesis was that power arose from property ownership, and concentrated land ownership led to oligarchic and monarchic forms of government. Vane disagreed with this, arguing instead that power came from godliness, and presented a somewhat apocalyptic argument in support of his idea. Vane supporter Henry Stubbe stated openly in October 1659 that permanent Senators would be required. These proposals caused a terminal split in Vane&#x27;s alliance with Heselrige, whose followers mostly deserted Vane.

==The Restoration==
In March 1660 the Long Parliament finally dissolved itself, and elections were held for the Convention Parliament, which sat in May. This body, dominated by royalists and Presbyterians, formally proclaimed Charles II as king, and he was restored to the throne on 29 May 1660. In order to minimise acts of reprisal and vengeance for acts taken during the Interregnum, the parliament passed the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, under whose terms most actions were forgiven. Specific exceptions were made for those directly involved in the regicide. Although Vane did not support the regicide and would not take an oath of support for it afterwards, he was also, after long debate, named as an exception. The act was not passed until August 1660, and Vane was arrested on 1 July 1660 on the orders of the king and imprisoned in the Tower of London. The parliament, after passing the Indemnity Act, petitioned Charles to grant clemency to Vane and others, asking that his life might be spared. This petition was granted.

Despite the clemency, Vane remained in the Tower, and the income from his estates was seized. He suffered the privations of the prison, and was unable to discharge debts that ran to £10,000. He was transferred to the Isles of Scilly in October 1661 in order to limit access to him by potential conspirators who might be scheming to free him. He continued to write, principally on religious themes, seeking to come to terms with the political state of affairs and his condition. According to &quot;The People&#x27;s Case Stated&quot;, written by Vane in this time, power originated with God, but resided primarily with the people: &quot;The power which is directive, and states and ascertains the morality of the rule of obedience, is in the hand of God; but the original, from whence all just power arises, which is magistratical and co-ercitive, is from the will or free gift of the people, who may either keep the power in themselves or give up their subjection and will in the hand of another.&quot; King and people were bound by &quot;the fundamental constitution or compact&quot;, which if the king violated, the people might return to their original right and freedom.

Following Vane&#x27;s move to Scilly, the Cavalier Parliament passed a resolution in November 1661 demanding his return to the Tower for trial. Charles temporized, and in January 1662 the Parliament renewed the demand. Vane was moved back to the Tower in April 1662, and on 2 June 1662 he was arraigned on charges of high treason against Charles II. The trial began on 6 June before the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, with four judges headed by Lord Chief Justice Robert Foster presiding, and with the king&#x27;s attorney general Sir Geoffrey Palmer prosecuting. As was typical of those accused of treason, Vane was denied legal representation. He defended himself against charges of making war against the king during the civil war by asserting the sovereign power of parliament. Accused of imagining the death of the king in 1659, he argued that it was not possible to commit treason against a king not in possession of the crown. When the prosecution argued that the king was always in &quot;de jure&quot; possession, Vane pointed out that this rendered invalid the charges that he conspired to keep Charles II from exercising his power. The judges stepped in to point out this was irrelevant. The jury, which was packed with royalists, convicted him after thirty minutes of debate.

Vane attempted to appeal his conviction, and tried to get the magistrates to sign a Bill of Exclusion in which Vane catalogued all the problems he saw with his trial. However, the magistrates refused. Informed of Vane&#x27;s conduct before and during the trial, Charles II now felt that Vane was too dangerous a man to be left alive, and retracted his clemency. (Unlike Vane, John Lambert at his trial had thrown himself to the mercy of the court, and was consequently exiled to Guernsey after his conviction.) Although Vane had been sentenced to the commoner&#x27;s death of being hanged and then drawn and quartered, Charles was persuaded to grant him the gentleman&#x27;s death of beheading. On 14 June 1662 Vane was taken to Tower Hill and beheaded. Noted diarist Samuel Pepys was there and recorded the event:

In his final days Vane had made his peace with God, and had also carefully prepared the speech he intended to make at the execution. In order to preserve the speech, he gave copies to close friends who visited him in those days, which were later printed. Many viewed him as a martyr for continuing to espouse his cause, and some thought the king had lost more than he gained by having him executed. His body was returned to his family, who interred him in the church at Shipbourne, near the family estate of Fairlawn in Kent.

==Family==
Vane and his wife Frances had ten children. Of their five sons, only the last, Christopher, had children, and succeeded to his father&#x27;s estates. He was created Baron Barnard by William III.

==Works==
A number of Vane&#x27;s speeches to Parliament and other bodies were printed during his lifetime or shortly after, including &quot;The Speech Intended to Have been Spoken on the Scaffold&quot;, published in 1662.

Vane&#x27;s other printed works include:
* &quot;A Brief Answer to a Certain Declaration&quot;, 1637
* &quot;The Retired Man&#x27;s Meditations&quot;, 1655
* &quot;A Healing Question Propounded&quot;, 1656
* &quot;Of Love of God and Union with God&quot;, 1657?
* &quot;The Proceeds of the Protector ... Against Sir Henry Vane, Knight&quot;, 1658
* &quot;A Needful Corrective or Balance in Popular Government&quot;, 1659
* &quot;Two Treatises: &quot;Epistle General to the Mystical Body of Christ&quot; and &quot;The Face of the Times&quot;&quot;, 1662
* &quot;The Cause of the People of England Stated&quot;, 1689 (written 1660–1662; the title may have been intended to be &quot;Case&quot; instead of &quot;Cause&quot;)
* &quot;A Pilgrimage into the Land of Promise&quot;, 1664
* &quot;The Trial of Sir Henry Vane, Knight&quot;, 1662

The last work contains, in addition to his last speech and details relating to the trial, &quot;The People&#x27;s Case Stated&quot;, &quot;The Valley of Jehoshaphat&quot;, and &quot;Meditations concerning Man&#x27;s Life&quot;.

Some contemporary works were incorrectly attributed to him. Clarendon, in his &quot;History of the Rebellion&quot;, assigns to Vane credit for one speech in support of the Self-Denying Ordinance; later historians find this attribution spurious. &quot;The Speech against Richard Cromwell&quot; is probably the composition of a later writer, while &quot;The Light Shining out of Darkness&quot; may have been written by Henry Stubbe.

==Reputation==
Vane was widely recognized by contemporary chroniclers as a gifted administrator and a forceful orator. Even the royalist Clarendon had good words for him, and wrote of him as follows: &quot;He had an unusual aspect, which ... made men think there was something in him of the extraordinary; and his whole life made good that imagination.&quot; Also, Clarendon credited Vane with having possessed &quot;extraordinary parts, a pleasant wit, a great understanding, a temper not to be moved&quot;, and in debate &quot;a quick conception and a very sharp and weighty expression&quot;. The 1662 biography &quot;The Life and Death of Sir Henry Vane the Younger&quot; by Vane&#x27;s chaplain George Sikes included John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Sonnet 17&quot;, written in 1652 in praise of Vane, and presented to Vane that year.

He was an advocate of free thought in religion. Although his personal religious beliefs as noted in a few of his writings from prison were sometimes baffling, by readers as varied as Richard Baxter, Clarendon, Gilbert Burnet and David Hume. Biographer David Parnham writes &quot;He presented himself as a &#x27;witness&#x27; of light, as a spiritualist, as one dispensing advanced wisdoms in the epistemological setting of an imminent and apocalyptic age of the Spirit&quot;. Nevertheless, his religious beliefs weren&#x27;t why he fought in Parliament nor why the King had him executed. He fought as an Independent in Parliament not aligned to any religious sect.

Vane&#x27;s reputation was at its height in the nineteenth century, especially in the United States. English historian John Andrew Doyle wrote of Vane that he had acquired &quot;a more dazzling reputation than has been granted to the lofty public spirit and statesmanlike foresight of Winthrop.&quot; William Wordsworth referenced Vane in his sonnet &quot;Great Men Have Been Among Us&quot; (1802). Charles Dickens included the exchange between Vane and Cromwell at the end of the Rump Parliament in his &quot;A Child&#x27;s History of England&quot;, part-published in the early 1850s. In &quot;English Traits&quot; (1856), Ralph Waldo Emerson placed Vane on a list of historical English greats.

In April 1889, &quot;WITH the single exception of Cromwell, the greatest statesman of the heroic age of Puritanism was unquestionably the younger Henry Vane. He did as much as any one to compass the downfall of Strafford; he brought the military strength of Scotland to the aid of the hard-pressed Parliament; he administered the navy with which Blake won his astonishing victories; he dared even withstand Cromwell at the height of his power, when his measures savored too much of violence...Yet before the beginning of his brilliant career in England, this young man had written his name indelibly upon one of the earliest pages in the history of the American people. It is pleasant to remember that this admirable man was once the chief magistrate of an American commonwealth. Thorough republican and enthusiastic lover of liberty, he was spiritually akin to Jefferson and to Samuel Adams...In his mind were the rudiments of the idea of a written constitution, upon which a new government for England might be built, with powers neatly defined and limited. One fancies that in some respects he would have felt himself more at home if he could have been suddenly translated from the Rump Parliament of 1653 to the Federal Convention of 1787, in which immortal assembly there sat perhaps no man of loftier spirit than his.&quot;

In 1897 the Royal Society of the Arts marked Vane&#x27;s demolished Hampstead house on Rosslyn Hill, Vane House, with a blue plaque.

A statue to honour Vane by Frederick William MacMonnies was erected in the Boston Public Library. The plaque underneath states, &quot;This statue was placed here at the request of James Freeman Clarke, D.D. an honoured citizen of Boston who nobly labored for the abolition of slavery in America. Vane was &quot;An Ardent Defender of Civil Liberty and Free Thought in Religion. He maintained that God and Parliament were superior to the King.&quot;

James Kendall Hosmer, editing Winthrop&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; in 1908, wrote of Vane:
... his heroic life and death, his services to Anglo-Saxon freedom, which make him a significant figure even to the present moment, may well be regarded as the most illustrious character who touches early New England history. While his personal contact with America was only for a brief space, his life became a strenuous upholding of American ideas: if government of, by, and for the people is the principle which English-speaking men feel especially bound to maintain, the life and death of Vane contributed powerfully to cause this idea to prevail.

Wendell Phillips, a prominent American abolitionist, friend of Frederick Douglas, and advocate for Native Americans, said,
&quot;Sir Harry Vane, in my judgment the noblest human being who ever walked the streets of yonder city,--I do not forget Franklin or Sam Adams, Washington or Fayette, Garrison or John Brown, -but Vane dwells an arrow&#x27;s flight above them all, and his touch consecrated the continent to measureless toleration of opinion and entire equality of rights. We are told we can find in Plato “all the intellectual life of Europe for two thousand years;” so you can find in Vane the pure gold of two hundred and fifty years of American civilization, with no particle of its dross. Plato would have welcomed him to the Academy, and Fenelon kneeled with him at the altar. He made Somers and John Marshall possible; like Carnot, he organized victory; and Milton pales before him in the stainlessness of his record. He stands among English statesmen preeminently the representative, in practice and in theory, of serene faith in the safety of trusting truth wholly to her own defence. For other men we walk backward, and throw over their memories the mantle of charity and excuse, saying reverently, “Remember the temptation and the age.” But Vane&#x27;s ermine has no stain; no act of his needs explanation or apology; and in thought he stands abreast of our age,--like pure intellect, belongs to all time.&quot;
