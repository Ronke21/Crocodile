<doc id="173342" wikidata="Q156916" url="?curid=173342" title="François Darlan">
<text>Jean Louis Xavier François Darlan (; 7 August 1881 – 24 December 1942) was a French admiral and political figure. Born in Nérac, Darlan graduated from the &quot;École navale&quot; in 1902 and quickly advanced through the ranks following his service during World War I. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1929, vice admiral in 1932, lieutenant admiral in 1937 before finally being made admiral and Chief of the Naval Staff in 1937. In 1939, Darlan was promoted to admiral of the fleet, a rank created specifically for him.

Darlan was Commander-in-Chief of the French Navy at the beginning of World War II. After France&#x27;s armistice with Germany in June 1940, Darlan served in Philippe Pétain&#x27;s Vichy regime as Minister of Marine, and in February 1941 he took over as Vice-President of the Council, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of the Interior and Minister of National Defence, making him the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Vichy government. In April 1942, Darlan resigned his ministries to Pierre Laval at German insistence, but retained his position as Commander-in-Chief of the French Armed Forces.

Darlan was in Algiers when the Allies invaded French North Africa in November 1942. Allied commander Dwight D. Eisenhower struck a controversial deal with Darlan, recognizing him as High Commissioner of France for North and West Africa. In return, Darlan ordered all French forces in North Africa to cease resistance and cooperate with the Allies. Less than two months later, on 24 December, Darlan was assassinated by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, a 20-year-old monarchist and anti-Vichyiste.

==Early life and career==
Darlan was born in Nérac, Lot-et-Garonne, to a family with a long connection with the French Navy. His great-grandfather was killed at the Battle of Trafalgar. His father, Jean-Baptiste Darlan, was a lawyer and politician who served as Minister of Justice in the cabinet of Jules Méline. Georges Leygues, a political colleague of his father who would spend seven years as Minister of the Marine, was Darlan&#x27;s godfather.

Darlan graduated from the &quot;École Navale&quot; in 1902. During World War I, he commanded an artillery battery that took part in the Battle of Verdun. After the war Darlan commanded the training ships &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; and &quot;Edgar Quinet&quot;, receiving promotions to frigate captain in 1920 and captain in 1926.

Thereafter Darlan rose swiftly. He was appointed Chef de Cabinet to Leygues and promoted to &quot;contre-amiral&quot; in 1929. In 1930, he served as the French Navy&#x27;s representative at the London Naval Conference, and in 1932 he was promoted to &quot;vice-amiral&quot;. Subsequently, in 1934, he took command of the Atlantic Squadron at Brest. He was promoted to &quot;vice-amiral d&#x27;escadre&quot; in 1936. 

==Chief of the Naval Staff==
In 1936, he went to London on an unsuccessful mission to persuade the Admiralty that greater Anglo-French naval co-operation was needed given the way that Germany and Italy had aligned as a result of the Spanish Civil War. On 5 August 1936, Darlan met with the First Sea Lord, Admiral Ernle Chatfield, where he expressed much concern about the prospect of Italy obtaining naval and air bases in the Balearic Islands and likewise Germany obtaining naval and air bases in the Canary Islands. Darlan argued for joint Anglo-French action to prevent the Axis powers from obtaining any bases on Spanish soil.

During the Spanish Civil War, the &quot;Front populaire&quot; government of Léon Blum leaned into a pro-Republican neutrality while Italy had intervened on the side of the Spanish Nationalists, leading to acute Italo-French tensions. Blum stated that Darlan &quot;thinks exactly as I do&quot; about a potential Italian naval threat to France, and selected him as the next chief of staff of the &quot;Marine&quot; to replace the pro-Italian Admiral Georges Durand-Viel. In addition, Darlan was considered by Blum to be loyal to the republic and Darlan had spoken in favor of the &quot;Front populaire&quot; social reforms. Darlan had attracted attention within the &quot;Marine&quot; in the fall of 1936 with his advocacy of France seizing the Balearic Islands to put a stop to the Italian naval and air bases under construction there as he argued that the prospect of Italian naval and air attacks from the Balearics on French shipping was an intolerable threat. Through Blum did not take up Darlan&#x27;s suggestion, he did approve of him as an admiral with strong anti-Italian views, which he considered to be a refreshing contrast to Durand-Viel who advocated a Franco-Italian alliance. Blum&#x27;s decision in October 1936 to appoint Darlan as the next chief of the naval staff over a number of admirals who had more seniority and combat experience was controversial. 

He was appointed Chief of the Naval Staff from 1 January 1937, at the same time promoted to &quot;amiral&quot;. Darlan was close to Blum and the Defense Minister Édouard Daladier. As head of the Navy he successfully used his political connections to lobby for a building programme to counter the rising threat from the Kriegsmarine and Regia Marina. The American historian Reynolds Salerno wrote: &quot;While Durand-Viel was a soft-spoken, cautious administrator who sought out advice from his subordinates and deferred to his minister for major policy decisions, Darlan was an extremely self-confident, resolute admiral who monopolized every aspect of the &quot;Marine&quot;&quot;. Salerno described Darlan as a conservative French nationalist who was committed to preserving France as a great power via a programe of building more warships for the &quot;Marine&quot;. Darlan&#x27;s political views were inclined towards the right, but he worked well with the centrist Daladier and the leftish Blum. 

After attending the Coronation of George VI, Darlan complained that protocol had left him, as a mere vice admiral, &quot;behind a pillar and after the Chinese admiral&quot;. In 1939 he was promoted to &quot;Amiral de la flotte&quot;, a rank created specifically to put him on equal terms with the First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy.

Darlan saw the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; as the principal threat to France, and pushed very hard for a naval expansion intended to make France the dominant power in the Mediterranean Sea. Germany had a population of 70 million while France had a population of 40 million. The numerical superiority of the &quot;Reich&quot; made it essential that the French transport a massive number of soldiers recruited in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to France to allow the French Army to face the Wehrmacht on equal terms, and as such it was considered essential that France have command of the sea-lanes in the western Mediterranean. Dalan argued that the pro-German orientation of Italian foreign policy made it likely that Italy would enter another world war on the side of Germany and that as such France needed a strong Mediterranean fleet to defend the sea-lanes linking Algeria to France in order to win against Germany. French decision-makers believed given the numerical superiority of Germany that just as in the last world war that France would need a massive number of troops from the Maghreb in order to have a chance of victory, and without soldiers from the Maghreb France was doomed. In addition, Darlan argued: &quot;A significant part of the British and French supplies and in particular, almost all the oil extracted from the French, British and Russian oil fields in the East depend upon mastery of the Mediterranean. But above all, the Mediterranean constitutes the only communication line with our Central European allies by which &quot;material&quot; may reach them&quot;. In contrast to Darlan, General Maurice Gamelin had argued for a rapprochement with Italy as he argued that a naval arms race would take away francs from the French Army. Blum and Daladier chose the course advocated by Darlan and in December 1936 approved of a naval construction programme designed to make the French Mediterranean fleet the dominant fleet in the western Mediterranean. In September 1938 during the Sudetenland crisis, Darlan mobilized the French Navy and placed the &quot;Marine&quot; on the highest state of alert. Expecting Italy to enter any war on the Axis side, Darlan reinforced the French Mediterranean fleet. 

In the fall of 1938 and the winter of 1939, Darlan continued to argue for a Mediterranean strategy as he stated that France was secure behind the Maginot Line and should in the event of war go on the offensive against Italy in order to secure command of the sea in the Mediterranean. In particular, Daladier who was now serving as premier, was greatly impressed with Darlan&#x27;s Mediterranean strategy. On 30 November 1938, demonstrations were organised by the Fascist regime in Italy demanding that France cede Nice, Corsica and Tunisia to Italy, which brought France and Italy to the brink of war. The acute crisis in Franco-Italian relations in the winter of 1938-1939 served to reinforce Darlan&#x27;s arguments within the French government for an offensive strategy against Italy.. At a meeting of the defense chiefs in January 1939, Darlan stated in the event of a war the &quot;Marine&quot; should sever the sea-lanes linking Italy to its colony of Libya while French warships should bombard Naples, La Spezia, and Pantelleria. Darlan also called for the French to seize the Italian colony of the Dodecanese islands, for a bombing campaign against Italian cities and for invasions from Tunisia into Libya and France into Italy itself. During the Danzig crisis, Darlan went to London on 8 August 1939 to meet the First Sea Lord, Admiral Dudley Pound, to discuss plans should the crisis end in a war. It was agreed at the Darlan-Pound meeting that the French fleet should remain focused on the Mediterranean with the majority of the French fleet to be stationed at the naval bases at Toulon, Mers El Kébir and Bizerte with only one squadron to be based at Brest on France&#x27;s Atlantic coast as the Royal Navy was to take responsibility for the rest of the North Atlantic and the North Sea. Germany and Italy had signed an offensive-defensive alliance known as the Pact of Steel on 22 May 1939, and it was taken for granted in both London and Paris that should the crisis result in war that it was inevitable that Italy would enter the war on Germany&#x27;s side at some point, hence Darlan&#x27;s focus on the Mediterranean during the Danzig crisis. 

After the declaration of war in September 1939, Darlan became Commander-in-Chief of the French Navy. Darlan was opposed to Daladier&#x27;s plans for a revived Salonika front. At a meeting of the Anglo-French Supreme War Council on 22 September 1939, Darlan sided with the British in opposing Daladier&#x27;s plans to take the &quot;Armée du Levant&quot; from Beirut to Thessaloniki with the aim of opening a second front in the Balkans as a way to aid Poland. Darlan argued that the plans for a new Salonika Front would distract from the blockade of Germany. Initially, Darlan had supported the British who believed that a naval blockade along with strategical bombing would be sufficient to defeat the &quot;Reich&quot; without any major land battles. The British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, believed that a combination of blockade and strategical bombing would induce the Wehrmacht generals to overthrow Hitler and thus bring the war to a close with no major land battles involving British troops. At the meetings of the Supreme War Council, Darlan along with Maurice Gamelin supported the objections of the British against the proposed expedition to the Balkans championed by Daladier and Maxime Weygand 

By late 1939, Darlan complained that the blockade had too many loopholes for neutral ships carrying war material to Germany and that the Allies needed a more aggressive approach. In particular, Darlan noted that because of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact that Germany had access to all of the vast natural resources of the Soviet Union, which rendered the Anglo-French naval blockade rather ineffectual. The Soviet Union was self-sufficient in virtually all of the natural resources needed to sustain a modern industrial economy, and German-Soviet trade defeated the purposes of the naval blockade. Starting in December 1939, Darlan started to advocate an Anglo-French expedition to Scandinavia to seize the Swedish iron mines that supplied the Germany with high-grade iron that was used to make steel (the &quot;Reich&quot; had no high-grade iron mines of it own). Darlan argued that it was imperative to strike before Germany and the Soviet Union signed another economic agreement that would allow Germany to have access to Soviet iron, saying the time to deprive Germany of its access to Swedish iron was now. 

Darlan was one of the main advocates of a Scandinavian expedition, arguing to seize the Swedish iron mines would cause collapse of the German economy no later than the spring of 1941. By January 1940, Darlan had convinced Daladier that the expedition to Scandinavia would win the war for the Allies. In January 1940, Darlan called for a joint Army-Navy expedition to sail via the Arctic Ocean to seize the Petsamo province of Finland recently occupied by the Red Army even though it would almost mean war with the Soviet Union out of the hope of provoking German response, which would allow French forces to occupy northern Sweden, and hence deprive the &quot;Reich&quot; of its most important source of iron. Darlan had a blasé attitude towards the prospect of a war with the Soviet Union, arguing that since the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact that it made little difference if France were at war with the Soviet Union or not. The plans for a Scandinavian expedition drew strong opposition from Maurice Gamelin who argued that best place for French manpower was in defending France from the expected German invasion. However, Gamelin&#x27;s inability to produce a convincing alternate strategy led for Daladier to decide in favor of Darlan&#x27;s recommendation. Unlike the plans for a new Salonika front, the British leaders, especially the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, were very keen on an expedition to Scandinavia. Likewise, Darlan supported what the French called the &quot;Baku project&quot; of having Anglo-French bombers based in Syria and Iraq bomb the oil fields in Baku in Soviet Azerbaijan as a way to cut Germany off from Soviet oil. Darlan also supported plans for French submarines to be sent into the Black Sea to sink Soviet oil tankers.

==Vichy government==
===Armistice===
Darlan was immensely proud of the French navy which he had helped to build up, and after Axis forces defeated France (May–June 1940), on 3 June he threatened that he would mutiny and lead the fleet to fight under the British flag in the event of an armistice. Darlan promised Churchill at the Briare Conference (12 June) that no French ship would ever come into German hands. Even on 15 June he was still talking of a potential armistice with indignation. Darlan appears to have retreated from his position on 15 June, when the Cabinet voted 13–6 for Camille Chautemps&#x27; compromise proposal to inquire about possible terms. He was willing to accept an armistice provided the French fleet was kept out of German hands.

On 16 June Churchill&#x27;s telegram arrived agreeing to an armistice (France and Britain were bound by treaty not to seek a separate peace) provided the French fleet was moved to British ports. This was not acceptable to Darlan, who argued that it would leave France defenceless. That day, according to Jules Moch, he declared that Britain was finished so there was no point in continuing to fight, and he was concerned that if there was no armistice Hitler would invade French North Africa via Franco&#x27;s Spain. That evening Paul Reynaud, feeling he lacked sufficient cabinet support for continuing the war, resigned as Prime Minister, and Philippe Pétain formed a new government with a view to seeking an armistice with Germany.

Darlan served as the Minister of Marine in the Pétain administration from 16 June. On 18 June Darlan gave his &quot;word of honour&quot; to the British First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound that he would not allow the French fleet to fall into German hands. Petain&#x27;s government signed an armistice (22 June 1940) but retained control of the territories known as &quot;Vichy France&quot; after the capital moved to Vichy in early July. General Charles Noguès, Commander-in-Chief of French forces in North Africa, was dismayed at the armistice but accepted it partly (he claimed) because Darlan would not let him have the French fleet to continue hostilities against the Axis powers.

Churchill later wrote that Darlan could have been the leader of the Free French, &quot;a de Gaulle raised to the tenth power&quot;, had he defected at this time. De Gaulle&#x27;s biographer Jean Lacouture described Darlan as &quot;the archetypal man of failed destiny&quot; thereafter.

===Darlan, the French Navy and the British===

The terms of the armistice called for the demobilisation and disarmament of the ships of the French Navy under German supervision in their home ports (mostly in the German-occupied zone). As the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill pointed out, this meant that French warships would be fully armed when they came under German control. At Italian suggestion, the armistice terms were amended to permit the fleet to stay temporarily in North African ports, where they might potentially be seized by Italian troops from Libya. Darlan ordered all ships then in the Atlantic ports (which Germany would soon occupy) to steam to French overseas possessions, out of reach of the Germans, although not necessarily of the Italians.

Despite Darlan&#x27;s assurance, Churchill had remained concerned that Darlan might be overruled by the politicians, and this concern was not allayed by Darlan becoming a government minister himself. Darlan repeatedly refused British requests to place the whole fleet in British custody (or in the French West Indies). He attempted to get the British to release French warships and gave a version of the armistice terms inconsistent with what the British knew from other sources to be the case. The British lacked confidence that Darlan was being straight with them (one government adviser minuted that he had &#x27;turned crook like the rest&#x27;) and believed that, even if he was sincere, he could not deliver on his promise. This belief led to the British Attack on Mers-el-Kébir (Operation Catapult), where, on 3 July 1940 the Royal Navy attacked the French fleet. The plans for &quot;Catapult&quot; had been drawn up as early as 14-16 June. Darlan was at his house at Nérac in Gascony on 3 July, and could not be contacted.

Thereafter, French forces loyal to Vichy (most of them under Darlan&#x27;s command) fiercely resisted British moves into French territory, and sometimes co-operated with German forces. However, as Darlan had promised, no capital ships fell into German hands, and only three destroyers and a few dozen submarines and smaller vessels passed into German control.

Darlan expected the Axis to win the war and saw it as to France&#x27;s advantage to collaborate with Germany. He distrusted the British, and after the attack on Mers-el-Kébir, he seriously considered waging a naval war against Britain.

===1941–42: collaboration with Germany and after===

Darlan came from a republican background and never believed in the Vichyite &quot;Révolution nationale&quot;; for example, he had reservations about Pétain&#x27;s clericalism. However, by 1941 Darlan had become Pétain&#x27;s most trusted associate. In February 1941 Darlan replaced Pierre-Étienne Flandin as &quot;Vice President of the Council&quot; (prime minister). He also became Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of the Interior, and Minister of National Defence, making him the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Vichy government. On 11 February he was named Pétain&#x27;s eventual successor, in accordance with Act Number Four of the constitution. 

Darlan was primarily concerned with negotiating the peace treaty that was supposed to be followed up after the armistice and saw the &quot;Jewish Question&quot; in France as a bargaining tool for a better peace treaty with the Germans. Darlan expected the &quot;Reich&quot; to win the war, and saw safeguarding French interests in the expected German-dominated postwar world as his main duty. Upon entering office, Darlan had wanted to swiftly sign a peace treaty that would see the Germans end their occupation zone in northern France and along the Atlantic coast, and was greatly disenchanted at the sluggish pace of the peace talks as he learned the partition of France imposed by the armistice was going to last years instead of a few months. Like many other French people at the time, Darlan adhered to a division in outlook towards &quot;les Israélites&quot; (the term for the assimilated French Jews who had embraced the French language and culture) and &quot;les Juifs&quot; (the rather derogatory term for Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe). Darlan had complained in the 1930s that France was accepting too many Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe whom he accused of causing crime and economic problems. At a cabinet meeting, Darlan stated: &quot;The stateless Jews who have thronged to our country in the last fifteen years do not interest me. But the others, the good old French Jews, have a right to every protection we can give them. I have some, by the way, in my own family&quot;. Darlan tended to be opposed to Nazi measures against the &quot;good&quot; French Jews while being silent against the Nazi measures against the &quot;bad&quot; immigrant Jews, protesting against laws that stripped the property away from French Jews while supporting the same laws against immigrant Jews. In memo, Darlan wrote that his aim towards the &quot;Jewish Question&quot; was to &quot;not bother the old French Jews&quot;. 

As a prominent figure in the Vichy government, Darlan repeatedly offered Hitler active military cooperation against Britain. Hitler, however, distrusted France and wanted it to remain neutral during his planned attack on the Soviet Union.

Darlan negotiated the Paris Protocols of May 1941 with Germany, in which Germany made concessions on prisoners of war and occupation terms, and France agreed to German bases in French colonies. This last condition was opposed by Darlan&#x27;s rival, General Maxime Weygand, and the Protocols were never ratified, though Weygand was dismissed at German insistence in November 1941.

However, the Germans became suspicious of Darlan&#x27;s opportunism and malleable loyalties as his obstructionism mounted. He refused to provide French conscript labour. After Allied forces captured French Syria and Lebanon in June–July 1941, and the German invasion of the USSR stalled before Moscow by December 1941, Darlan moved away from his policy of collaboration. An elaborate conspiracy theory, the Pacte Synarchique, was devised by more pro-German elements in the Vichy regime to discredit Laval and his technocratic circle arguing that a group of financiers aimed for French defeat in the Battle of France but also plotted against the National Revolution.

Because he reported only to Pétain, Darlan exercised broad powers, although Pétain&#x27;s own entourage (including Weygand) continued to wield considerable influence. In running the French colonial empire, Darlan relied heavily on the personal loyalty of key army and naval officers in the colonies to head off defection to Free France.

In January 1942, Darlan assumed additional government offices. But in April 1942, at German insistence, Darlan resigned his ministries, and was replaced by Pierre Laval, whom the Germans considered more trustworthy. Darlan retained several lesser posts, including that of commander-in-chief of the French armed forces.

==Darlan&#x27;s deal in North Africa==
On 5 November 1942, Darlan went to Algiers to visit his son, who was hospitalised. Coincidentally, the day after his arrival, 8 November, the Western Allies invaded French North Africa. 

During the night of 7–8 November, the main group of Algerian resistance (led by two cousins, Roger Carcassonne in Oran and José Aboulker in Algiers) seized control of Algiers in anticipation of the invasion. They prepared with Henri d&#x27;Astier de la Vigerie to support the expected Allied landings and met with General Mark Clark in Vichy Morocco, who provided them with weapons. 

They also captured Darlan. The Allies had anticipated little response from French forces in North Africa, and instead expected them to accept the authority of General Henri Giraud, sent from France to take charge. But opposition from the Vichy army continued, and no one heeded Giraud, who had no official status. To bring a quick end to the resistance and secure French co-operation, the Allies put a lot of pressure on Darlan, who released a general cease-fire (including Morocco) after two days (on 10 November). But the Americans wanted the active assistance of French forces in North Africa. Only after nine more days, once Hitler had sent troops into the formerly unoccupied zone, and under extreme pressure from the Americans, did Darlan agree that French troops in North Africa should help to defend Tunisia against rapidly arriving German reinforcements. 

Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Allied commander on the spot, recognized Darlan as commander of all French forces in the area as well his self-nomination as High Commissioner of France in Africa (head of civil government) for North and West Africa on 14 November and Vichy forces in French West Africa joined the movement. Eisenhower then reached an agreement with Darlan on 22 November to political and military co-operation.

The &quot;Darlan deal&quot; proved highly controversial, as Darlan had been a notorious collaborator with Germany, as &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Vichy government between February 1941 and June 1942: he negotiated the Paris Protocols with Hitler, that granted the Germans military facilities in Syria, Tunisia, and French West Africa. He advocated military neutrality and collaboration with Germany, both economically and politically, in exchange for compensation from the occupier.

General de Gaulle and his Free France organization were outraged; so were the pro-Allied conspirators (Géo Gras Group) who had seized Algiers. Many of them were jailed by Darlan for months. Some high American and British officials objected, and there was furious criticism by newspapers and politicians. Roosevelt defended it (using wording suggested by Churchill) as &#x27;a temporary expedient, justified only by the stress of battle&#x27;. 

In a secret session, Churchill persuaded an initially skeptical House of Commons. Eisenhower&#x27;s recognition of Darlan was right, he said, and even if not quite right, it meant French rifles pointed not at Allies, but at Axis soldiers: &quot;I am sorry to have to mention a point like this, but it makes a lot of difference to a soldier whether a man fires his gun at him, or at an enemy...&quot; At the time, Churchill saw Darlan rather than de Gaulle as the better French ally, saying in the same speech that &quot;de Gaulle is no unfaltering friend of Britain&quot;. On 26 November 1942 Churchill told the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden that &quot;Darlan has done more for us than de Gaulle&quot; while Oliver Harvey wrote in his diary: &quot;P.M. is getting more and more enthusiastic over Darlan&quot;. American historian Arthur Funk maintained that the &quot;deal with Darlan&quot; was misunderstood by the critics at the time as an opportunistic improvisation and claimed Darlan had been in talks with American diplomats for months about switching sides, and when the opportunity came, did so promptly. American historian Robert Paxton on the contrary considers it is a thesis &quot;based on too many post-war pleas to be credible&quot;: archives showing Darlan making every effort to discourage and then thwart Allied action.

The cease-fire and the &quot;deal&quot; were condemned by the Vichy government. Pétain stripped Darlan of his offices and ordered resistance to the end in North Africa, but was ignored. The Germans were more direct: German troops occupied the remaining 40% of France on 11 November. However, the Germans initially paused outside Toulon, the base where most of the remaining French ships were moored. Only on 27 November did the Germans try to seize the ships, but all capital ships were scuttled, and only three destroyers and a few dozen smaller ships were captured, mostly fulfilling Darlan&#x27;s promise in 1940 to Churchill.

Darlan refused to repeal the most aggressive laws and measures of the Vichy regime, which resulted in political prisoners remaining in concentration camps of the South. Justifying himself on military grounds, he refused to abolish the discriminatory status of Jews, restore the Crémieux Decree, or emancipate Muslims. There were numerous and obvious indications that the American public did not support its government’s Vichy policy, that it saw Vichy’s true colors, and that it even supported de Gaulle’s Free France movement: even an American official admitted that this episode amounted to “a sordid nullification of the principles for which the United Nations were supposed to be fighting for”.

==Assassination==
On the afternoon of 24 December 1942, French anti-Vichyiste and monarchist Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle shot Darlan in his headquarters; Darlan died a few hours later. Bonnier de La Chapelle (aged 20), the son of a French journalist, was part of a pro-monarchist group that wanted to restore the pretender to the French throne, the Count of Paris.

De La Chapelle was arrested immediately, tried and convicted the next day, and executed by firing squad on 26 December.

==Legacy==
Darlan was unpopular with the Allies – he was considered pompous, having asked Eisenhower to provide 200 Coldstream Guards and Grenadier Guards as an honor company for the commemoration of Napoleon&#x27;s victory at Austerlitz. It was said that &quot;no tears were shed&quot; by the British over his death. Harold Macmillan, who was Churchill&#x27;s adviser to Eisenhower at the time of the assassination, wryly described Darlan&#x27;s service and death by saying, &quot;Once bought, he stayed bought.&quot; In his memoirs of World War Two entitled &quot;The Second World War&quot;, Churchill at first portrayed Darlan in volume 2, &quot;Their Finest Hour&quot;, as an especially devious and dishonest figure, a corrupt schemer whose word was not to be trusted as a justification for the attack on Mers-el-Kébir in 1940. Later on in &quot;The Hinge of Fate&quot;, Churchill portrayed the &quot;deal with Darlan&quot; in 1942 as a distasteful, but necessary measure to allow the success of Operation Torch. At that point his picture of Darlan changed into a honorable, but misguided French patriot whose principle sin was his Anglophobia, which Churchill put down to an ancestor of Darlan&#x27;s having been killed at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Churchill devoted nearly an entire page into praising Darlan&#x27;s character with the clear implication he was a worthy alliance partner in North Africa. The British historian David Reynolds noted that Churchill&#x27;s picture of Darlan tended to change as a way to justify whatever policy he was pursuing towards France.

<text>The Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) is an American organization for female golfers. The organization is headquartered at LPGA International in Daytona Beach, Florida, and is best known for running the LPGA Tour, a series of weekly golf tournaments for elite women professional golfers from around the world.

==Organization and history==
Other &quot;LPGAs&quot; exist in other countries, each with a geographical designation in its name, but the U.S. organization is the first, largest, and most prestigious. The LPGA is also an organization for female club and teaching professionals. This is different from the PGA Tour, which runs the main professional tours in the U.S. and, since 1968, has been independent of the club and teaching professionals&#x27; organization, the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America (or PGA of America).

The LPGA also administers an annual qualifying school similar to that conducted by the PGA Tour. Depending on a golfer&#x27;s finish in the final qualifying tournament, she may receive full or partial playing privileges on the LPGA Tour. In addition to the main LPGA Tour, the LPGA also owns and operates the Epson Tour, formerly the Futures Tour, the official developmental tour of the LPGA. Top finishers at the end of each season on that tour receive playing privileges on the main LPGA Tour for the following year.

The LPGA is the oldest continuing women&#x27;s professional sports organization in the United States. It succeeded the WPGA (Women&#x27;s Professional Golf Association), which was founded in 1944 but stopped its limited tour after the 1948 season and officially ceased operations in December 1949. The WPGA had been founded by Ellen Griffin, Betty Hicks, and Hope Seignious.

The LPGA was founded in 1950 at Rolling Hills Country Club in Wichita, Kansas. Its 13 founders were: Alice Bauer, Patty Berg, Bettye Danoff, Helen Dettweiler, Marlene Hagge, Helen Hicks, Opal Hill, Betty Jameson, Sally Sessions, Marilynn Smith, Shirley Spork, Louise Suggs, and Babe Zaharias. Patty Berg served as its first president. The founders were elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame as a group in 2023 though six had already been inducted individually.

The first LPGA tournament was the 1950 Tampa Women&#x27;s Open, held at Palma Ceia Golf and Country Club in Tampa, Florida. Ironically, the winner was amateur Polly Riley, who beat the stellar field of professional founders. In 1956, the LPGA hosted its first tournament outside the United States at the Havana Open in Havana, Cuba.

In 2001, Jane Blalock&#x27;s JBC Marketing established the Women&#x27;s Senior Golf Tour, now called the Legends Tour, for women professionals aged 45 and older. This is affiliated with the LPGA, but is not owned by the LPGA.

Michael Whan, a former marketing executive in the sporting goods industry, became the eighth commissioner of the LPGA in October 2009, succeeding the ousted Carolyn Bivens.

After a lawsuit filed by golfer Lana Lawless, the rules were changed in 2010 to allow transgender competitors. In 2013, trans woman Bobbi Lancaster faced local scorn for attempting to play in Arizona&#x27;s Cactus Tour in hopes of getting a spot for the LPGA Qualifying Tournament. In December 2024, the LPGA published a new policy that states in order to compete as female in their tournaments, players must either be assigned female at birth, or have transitioned to female before undergoing male puberty. The policy goes into effect in 2025.

In 2018, the LPGA acquired an amateur golf association, the Executive Women&#x27;s Golf Association (EWGA), and expanded its emphasis to include amateur golfers in the U.S. and North America. Initially called the LPGA Women Who Play, the amateur organization was rebranded as the LPGA Amateur Golf Association. The LPGA Amateur Golf Association has member-operated chapters throughout North America and the Caribbean.

== LPGA Tour tournaments ==

As a United States–based tour, most of the LPGA Tour&#x27;s events are held in the United States. In 1956, the LPGA hosted its first tournament outside the United States at the Havana Open in Havana, Cuba. In 2020, fourteen tournaments are held outside of the United States, seven events in Asia, four in Europe, two events in Australia, and one in Canada.

Five of the tournaments held outside North America are co-sanctioned with other professional tours. The Ladies European Tour co-sanctions the Women&#x27;s British Open, The Evian Championship in France, and the Women&#x27;s Australian Open (also co-sanctioned with the ALPG Tour). The other two co-sanctioned events—the BMW Ladies Championship (LPGA of Korea Tour) and Toto Japan Classic (LPGA of Japan Tour)—are held during the tour&#x27;s autumn swing to Asia.

===LPGA majors===
The LPGA&#x27;s annual major championships are:
*Chevron Championship
*U.S. Women&#x27;s Open

===LPGA Playoffs===
Since 2006, the LPGA has played a season-ending championship tournament. Through the 2008 season, it was known as the LPGA Playoffs at The ADT; in 2009 and 2010, it was known as the LPGA Tour Championship. In 2011, the event became the CME Group Titleholders, held in November; since 2014, it has been known as the CME Group Tour Championship, and that name is used .

From 2006 through 2008 the LPGA schedule was divided into two halves, with 15 players from each half qualifying for the Championship based on their performance. Two wild-card selections were also included for a final field of 21 players. The winner of the LPGA Tour Championship, which features three days of &quot;playoffs&quot; plus the final championship round, earns $1 million.

In 2009, the Tour Championship field was increased to 120 players, with entry open to all Tour members in the top 120 on the money list as of three weeks prior to the start of the tournament. The total purse was $1.5 million with $225,000 going to the winner.

The CME Group Titleholders, which resurrects the name of a former LPGA major championship (the Titleholders Championship), was first played in 2011. From 2011 to 2013, its field was made up of three qualifiers from each official tour event during the season, specifically the top three finishers not previously qualified.

After 2014, the field is determined by a season-long points race, the Race to the CME Globe. Points conferred to players on tour depend on whether the tournament is major or not, and placement. From 2014 to 2018, the top 72 players in the Race to the CME Globe competed in the CME Group Tour Championship, with the top 12 players mathematically eligible to win a $1 million bonus in 2017 and 2018. Past Race to the CME Globe champions include Lydia Ko (2014, 2015), Ariya Jutanugarn (2016, 2018) and Lexi Thompson (2017).

== Tournament prize money ==
In 2010, total official prize money on the LPGA Tour was $41.4 million, a decrease of over $6 million from 2009. In 2010 there were 24 official tournaments, down from 28 in 2009 and 34 in 2008. Despite the loss in total tournaments, the number of tournaments hosted outside of the United States in 2010 stayed the same, as all four lost tournaments had been hosted in the United States. By 2016, the number of tournaments had risen to 33 with a record-high total prize money in excess of $63 million. In 2019, a new record was set with total prize money amounting to $70.5 million (a rise of over $5 million in one year).

==International presence==
In its first four decades, the LPGA Tour was dominated by American players. Sandra Post of Canada became the first player living outside the United States to gain an LPGA tour card in 1968. The non-U.S. contingent is now very large. The last time an American player topped the money list was in 2014 (Stacy Lewis), the last time an American led the tour in tournaments won was in 2020 (Danielle Kang), and from 2000 through 2009, non-Americans won 31 of 40 major championships.

Particularly, one of the notable trends seen in the early 21st century in the LPGA is the rise and dominance of Korean golfers. Se Ri Pak&#x27;s early success in the LPGA sparked the boom in Korean women golfers on the LPGA Tour. In 2009, there were 122 non-Americans from 27 countries on the tour, including 47 from South Korea, 14 from Sweden, 10 from Australia, eight from the United Kingdom (four from England, three from Scotland and one from Wales), seven from Canada, five from Taiwan, and four from Japan.

==Historical tour schedules and results==

*Official tournaments are tournaments in which earnings and scores are credited to the players&#x27; official LPGA record.

==Hall of Fame==
The LPGA established the Hall of Fame of Women&#x27;s Golf in 1951, with four charter members: Patty Berg, Betty Jameson, Louise Suggs, and Babe Zaharias. After being inactive for several years, the Hall of Fame moved in 1967 to its first physical premises, in Augusta, Georgia, and was renamed the LPGA Tour Hall of Fame. In 1998 it merged into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

==LPGA Tour awards==
The LPGA Tour presents several annual awards. Three are awarded in competitive contests, based on scoring over the course of the year. 
*The Player of the Year is awarded based on a formula in which points are awarded for top-10 finishes and are doubled at the LPGA&#x27;s five major championships. The points system is: 30 points for first; 12 points for second; nine points for third; seven points for fourth; six points for fifth; five points for sixth; four points for seventh; three points for eighth; two points for ninth and one point for 10th.
*The Vare Trophy, named for Glenna Collett-Vare, is given to the player with the lowest scoring average for the season.
*The Louise Suggs Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the first-year player on the LPGA Tour who scores the highest in a points competition in which points are awarded based on a player&#x27;s finish in an event. The points system is: 150 points for first; 80 points for second; 75 points for third; 70 points for fourth; and 65 points for fifth. After fifth place, points are awarded in decrements of three, beginning at sixth place with 62 points. Points are doubled in the major events and at the season-ending Tour Championship. Rookies who make the cut in an event and finish below 41st each receive five points. The award is named after Louise Suggs, one of the founders of the LPGA.

American golfer Nancy Lopez, in 1978, is the only player to win all three awards in the same season. Lopez was also the Tour&#x27;s top money earner that season.

<text>A laboratory (; ; colloquially lab) is a facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific or technological research, experiments, and measurement may be performed. Laboratories are found in a variety of settings such as schools, universities, privately owned research institutions, corporate research and testing facilities, government regulatory and forensic investigation centers, physicians&#x27; offices, clinics, hospitals, regional and national referral centers, and even occasionally personal residences.

==Overview==
The organisation and contents of laboratories are determined by the differing requirements of the specialists working within. A physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber, while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength. A chemist or biologist might use a wet laboratory, while a psychologist&#x27;s laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior. In some laboratories, such as those commonly used by computer scientists, computers (sometimes supercomputers) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data. Scientists in other fields will still use other types of laboratories. Engineers use laboratories as well to design, build, and test technological devices.

Scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and universities, industry, government, or military facilities, and even aboard ships and spacecraft. 

Despite the underlying notion of the lab as a confined space for experts, the term &quot;laboratory&quot; is also increasingly applied to workshop spaces such as Living Labs, Fab Labs, or Hackerspaces, in which people meet to work on societal problems or make prototypes, working collaboratively or sharing resources. This development is inspired by new, participatory approaches to science and innovation and relies on user-centred design methods and concepts like Open innovation or User innovation. One distinctive feature of work in Open Labs is the phenomenon of translation, driven by the different backgrounds and levels of expertise of the people involved.

==History==

Early instances of &quot;laboratories&quot; recorded in English involved alchemy and the preparation of medicines.

The emergence of Big Science during World War II increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment, introducing particle accelerators and similar devices.

=== The early laboratories ===

The earliest laboratory according to the present evidence is a home laboratory of Pythagoras of Samos, the well-known Greek philosopher and scientist. This laboratory was created when Pythagoras conducted an experiment about tones of sound and vibration of string.

In the painting of Louis Pasteur by Albert Edelfelt in 1885, Louis Pasteur is shown comparing a note in his left hand with a bottle filled with a solid in his right hand, and not wearing any personal protective equipment.

Researching in teams started in the 19th century, and many new kinds of equipment were developed in the 20th century.

A 16th century underground alchemical laboratory was accidentally discovered in the year 2002. Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor was believed to be the owner. The laboratory is called Speculum Alchemiae and is preserved as a museum in Prague.

==Techniques==
Laboratory techniques are the set of procedures used on natural sciences such as chemistry, biology, physics to conduct an experiment; while some of them involve the use of complex laboratory equipment from laboratory glassware to electrical devices, and others require more specific or expensive supplies.

==Equipment and supplies==

Laboratory equipment refers to the various tools and equipment used by scientists working in a laboratory. Laboratory equipment is generally used to either perform an experiment or to take measurements and gather data. Larger or more sophisticated equipment is generally called a scientific instrument. 

The classical equipment includes tools such as Bunsen burners and microscopes as well as specialty equipment such as operant conditioning chambers, spectrophotometers and calorimeters.

===Chemical laboratories===
* laboratory glassware such as the beaker or reagent bottle
* Analytical devices as HPLC or spectrophotometers

===Molecular biology laboratories/Life science laboratories===

* Autoclave
* Microscope
* Centrifuges
* Shakers &amp; mixers
* Pipette
* Thermal cyclers (PCR)
* Photometer
* Refrigerators and Freezers
* Universal testing machine
* ULT Freezers
* Incubators
* Bioreactor
* Biological safety cabinets
* Sequencing instruments
* Fume hoods
* Environmental chamber
* Humidifier
* Weighing scale
* Reagents (supply)
* Pipettes tips (supply)
* Polymer (supply) consumables for small volumes (μL and mL scale), mainly sterile

==Specialized types==
The title of &quot;laboratory&quot; is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories. These notably include:

* Film laboratory or Darkroom
* Clandestine lab for the production of illegal drugs
* Computer lab
* Crime lab used to process crime scene evidence
* Language laboratory
* Medical laboratory (involves handling of chemical compounds)
* Public health laboratory
* Industrial laboratory
*Cleanroom

==Safety==


In many laboratories, hazards are present. Laboratory hazards might include poisons; infectious agents; flammable, explosive, or radioactive materials; moving machinery; extreme temperatures; lasers, strong magnetic fields or high voltage. Therefore, safety precautions are vitally important. Rules exist to minimize the individual&#x27;s risk, and safety equipment is used to protect the lab users from injury or to assist in responding to an emergency.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, recognizing the unique characteristics of the laboratory workplace, has tailored a standard for occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories. This standard is often referred to as the &quot;Laboratory Standard&quot;. Under this standard, a laboratory is required to produce a Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP) which addresses the specific hazards found in its location, and its approach to them.

In determining the proper Chemical Hygiene Plan for a particular business or laboratory, it is necessary to understand the requirements of the standard, evaluation of the current safety, health and environmental practices and assessment of the hazards. The CHP must be reviewed annually. Many schools and businesses employ safety, health, and environmental specialists, such as a Chemical Hygiene Officer (CHO) to develop, manage, and evaluate their CHP. Additionally, third party review is also used to provide an objective &quot;outside view&quot; which provides a fresh look at areas and problems that may be taken for granted or overlooked due to habit.

Inspections and audits like also be conducted on a regular basis to assess hazards due to chemical handling and storage, electrical equipment, biohazards, hazardous waste management, chemical waste, housekeeping and emergency preparedness, radiation safety, ventilation as well as respiratory testing and indoor air quality. An important element of such audits is the review of regulatory compliance and the training of individuals who have access to or work in the laboratory. Training is critical to the ongoing safe operation of the laboratory facility. Educators, staff and management must be engaged in working to reduce the likelihood of accidents, injuries and potential litigation. Efforts are made to ensure laboratory safety videos are both relevant and engaging.

== Sustainability ==
The effects of climate change are becoming more of a concern for organizations, and mitigation strategies are being sought by the research community. While many laboratories are used to perform research to find innovative solutions to this global challenge, sustainable working practices in the labs are also contributing factors towards a greener environment. Many labs are already trying to minimize their environmental impact by reducing energy consumption, recycling, and implementing waste sorting processes to ensure correct disposal.

=== Best practice ===
Research labs featuring energy-intensive equipment, use up to three to five times more energy per square meter than office areas.

==== Fume hoods ====

Presumably the major contributor to this high energy consumption are fume hoods. Significant impact can be achieved by keeping the opening height as low as possible when working and keeping them closed when not in use. One possibility to help with this, could be to install automatic systems, which close the hoods after an inactivity period of a certain length and turn off the lights as well. So the flow can be regulated better and is not unnecessarily kept at a very high level.

==== Freezers ====

Normally, ULT freezers are kept at −80 °C. One such device can consume up to the same amount of energy as a single-family household (25 kWh/day). Increasing the temperature to −70 °C makes it possible to use 40% less energy and still keep most samples safely stored.

==== Air condensers ====

Minimizing the consumption of water can be achieved by changing from water-cooled condensers (&quot;Dimroth&quot; condenser) to air-cooled condensers (&quot;Vigreux&quot; column), which take advantage of the large surface area to cool.

==== Laboratory electronics ====

The use of ovens is very helpful to dry glassware, but those installations can consume a lot of energy. Employing timers to regulate their use during nights and weekends, can reduce their impact on energy consumption enormously.

==== Waste sorting and disposal ====

The disposal of chemically/biologically contaminated waste requires a lot of energy. Regular waste however requires much less energy or can even be recycled to some degree. Not every object in a lab is contaminated, but often ends up in the contaminated waste, driving up energy costs for waste disposal. A good sorting and recycling system for non contaminated lab waste will allow lab users to act sustainably and correctly dispose of waste.

=== Networks ===
As of 2021, there are numerous laboratories currently dedicating time and resources to move towards more sustainable lab practices at their facilities, e.g.  MIT and the university of Edingburgh. Furthermore, several networks have emerged such as Green Your Lab, Towards greener research, the UK-based network LEAN, the Max-Planck-Sustainability network, and national platforms such as green labs austria and green labs NL. More university independent efforts and resources include the Laboratory Efficiency Assessment Framework, the think-tank labos1point5 and the non-profit organisation my green lab.

==Organization==
Organization of laboratories is an area of focus in sociology. Scientists consider how their work should be organized, which could be based on themes, teams, projects or fields of expertise. Work is divided, not only between different jobs of the laboratory such as the researchers, engineers and technicians, but also in terms of autonomy (should the work be individual or in groups). For example, one research group has a schedule where they conduct research on their own topic of interest for one day of the week, but for the rest they work on a given group project. Finance management is yet another organizational issue.

The laboratory itself is a historically dated organizational model. It came about due to the observation that the quality of work of researchers who collaborate is overall greater than a researcher working in isolation. From the 1950s, the laboratory has evolved from being an educational tool used by teachers to attract the top students into research, into an organizational model allowing a high level of scientific productivity.

Some forms of organization in laboratories include:

*Their size: Varies from a handful of researches to several hundred.
*The division of labor: &quot;Occurs between designers and operatives; researchers, engineers, and technicians; theoreticians and experimenters; senior researchers, junior researchers and students; those who publish, those who sign the publications and the others; and between specialities.&quot; 
*The coordination mechanisms: Which includes the formalization of objectives and tasks; the standardization of procedures (protocols, project management, quality management, knowledge management), the validation of publications and cross-cutting activities (number and type of seminars).

There are three main factors that contribute to the organizational form of a laboratory :

* The educational background of the researchers and their socialization process.
* The intellectual process involved in their work, including the type of investigation and equipment they use.
* The laboratory&#x27;s history.

Other forms of organization include social organization.

=== Social organization ===
A study by Richard H.R. Harper, involving two laboratories, will help elucidate the concept of social organization in laboratories. The main subject of the study revolved around the relationship between the staff of a laboratory (researchers, administrators, receptionists, technicians, etc.) and their Locator. A Locator is an employee of a Laboratory who is in charge of knowing where each member of the laboratory currently is, based on a unique signal emitted from the badge of each staff member. The study describes social relationships among different classes of jobs, such as the relationship between researchers and the Locator. It does not describe the social relationship between employees within a class, such as the relationship between researchers.

Through ethnographic studies, one finding is that, among the personnel, each class (researchers, administrators...) has a different degree of entitlement, which varies per laboratory. Entitlement can be both formal or informal (meaning it is not enforced), but each class is aware and conforms to its existence. The degree of entitlement, which is also referred to as a staff&#x27;s rights, affects social interaction between staff. By looking at the various interactions among staff members, we can determine their social position in the organization. As an example, administrators, in one lab of the study, do not have the right to ask the Locator where the researchers currently are, as they are not entitled to such information. On the other hand, researchers do have access to this type of information. So a consequence of this social hierarchy is that the Locator discloses various degrees of information, based on the staff member and their rights. The Locator does not want to disclose information that could jeopardize his relationship with the members of staff. The Locator adheres to the rights of each class.

Social hierarchy is also related to attitudes towards technologies. This was inferred based on the attitude of various jobs towards their lab badge. Their attitude depended on how that job viewed their badge from a standpoint of utility, (how is the badge useful for my job) morality (what are my morals on privacy, as it relates to being tracked by this badge) and relations (how will I be seen by others if I refuse to wear this badge). For example, a receptionist would view the badge as useful, as it would help them locate members of staff during the day. Illustrating relations, researchers would also wear their badge due to informal pressures, such as not wanting to look like a spoil-sport, or not wanting to draw attention to themselves.

Another finding is the resistance to change in a social organization. Staff members feel ill at ease when changing patterns of entitlement, obligation, respect, informal and formal hierarchy, and more.

In summary, differences in attitude among members of the laboratory are explained by social organization: A person&#x27;s attitudes are intimately related to the role they have in an organization. This hierarchy helps understand information distribution, control, and attitudes towards technologies in the laboratory.

<doc id="173353" wikidata="Q92650" url="?curid=173353" title="Paul Graham (programmer)">
<text>Paul Graham (; born November 13, 1964) is an English-American computer scientist, writer and essayist, entrepreneur and investor. His work includes the programming language Arc, the startup Viaweb (later renamed &quot;Yahoo! Store&quot;), co-founding the startup accelerator and seed capital firm Y Combinator, a number of essays and books, and the media webpage Hacker News. 

He is the author of the computer programming books &quot;On Lisp&quot;, &quot;ANSI Common Lisp&quot;, and &quot;Hackers &amp; Painters&quot;. Technology journalist Steven Levy has described Graham as a &quot;hacker philosopher&quot;.

Graham was born in England, where he and his family have maintained a permanent residence since 2016. He is also a citizen of the United States, where he attended all of his schooling and lived for 48 years prior to returning to England. 

==Education and early life==
Graham and his family moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1968, where he attended Gateway High School. Graham gained interest in science and mathematics from his father who was a nuclear physicist.

Graham received a Bachelor of Arts with a major in philosophy from Cornell University in 1986. He then received a Master of Science in 1988, and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1990, both in computer science from Harvard University.

Graham has also studied fine arts and painting at the Rhode Island School of Design and at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. 

==Career==
In 1996, Graham and Robert Morris founded Viaweb and recruited Trevor Blackwell shortly after. They believed that Viaweb was the first application service provider. Graham received a patent for webapps based on his work at Viaweb. Viaweb&#x27;s software, written mostly in Common Lisp, allowed users to make their own Internet stores. In the summer of 1998, after Jerry Yang received a strong recommendation from Ali Partovi, Viaweb was sold to Yahoo! for 455,000 shares of Yahoo! stock, valued at $49.6 million. After the acquisition, the product became Yahoo! Store.

Graham later gained notice for his essays, which he posts on his personal website. Essay subjects range from &quot;Beating the Averages&quot;, which compares Lisp to other programming languages and introduced the hypothetical programming language &quot;Blub&quot;, to &quot;Why Nerds are Unpopular&quot;, a discussion of nerd life in high school. A collection of his essays has been published as &quot;Hackers &amp; Painters&quot; by O&#x27;Reilly Media, which includes a discussion of the growth of Viaweb and the advantages of Lisp to program it.

In 2001, Graham announced that he was working on a new dialect of Lisp named Arc. It was released on 29 January 2008. Over the years since, he has written several essays describing features or goals of the language, and some internal projects at Y Combinator have been written in Arc, including the Hacker News web forum and news aggregator program.

In 2005, after giving a talk at the Harvard Computer Society later published as &quot;How to Start a Startup&quot;, Graham along with Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris started Y Combinator to provide seed funding to startups, particularly those started by younger, more technically oriented founders. Y Combinator has invested in more than 1300 startups, including Reddit, Twitch (formerly Justin.tv), Xobni, Dropbox, Airbnb, and Stripe.

&quot;BusinessWeek&quot; included Paul Graham in the 2008 edition of its annual feature, &quot;The 25 Most Influential People on the Web&quot;.

In response to the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), Graham announced in late 2011 that no representatives of any company supporting it would be invited to Y Combinator&#x27;s Demo Day events.

In February 2014, Graham stepped down from his day-to-day role at Y Combinator.

In October 2019, Graham announced a specification for another new dialect of Lisp, written in itself, named Bel.

==Graham&#x27;s hierarchy of disagreement==

Graham proposed a disagreement hierarchy in a 2008 essay &quot;How to Disagree&quot;, putting types of argument into a seven-point hierarchy and observing that &quot;If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean, that will make most of them happier.&quot; Graham also suggested that the hierarchy can be thought of as a pyramid, as the highest forms of disagreement are rarer.

Following this hierarchy, Graham notes that articulate forms of name-calling (e.g., &quot;The author is a self-important dilettante&quot;) are no different from crude insults. When in disagreement people often become more animated and engaged, and this leads to them becoming angry. At the lower levels, the attacks are directed against the person, which can be hateful. Higher levels of argument are directed against the idea, which is easier to recognize and accept. When people argue at the higher levels, the exchange of viewpoint is more informative and helpful.

== The Blub paradox ==

Graham considers the hierarchy of programming languages with the example of &quot;Blub&quot;, a hypothetically average language &quot;right in the middle of the abstractness continuum. It is not the most powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine language.&quot; It was used by Graham to illustrate a comparison, beyond Turing completeness, of programming language power, and more specifically to illustrate the difficulty of comparing a programming language one knows to one that one does not.

Graham considers a hypothetical Blub programmer. When the programmer looks down the &quot;power continuum&quot;, they consider the lower languages to be less powerful because they miss some feature that a Blub programmer is used to. But when they look up, they fail to realize that they are looking up: they merely see &quot;weird languages&quot; with unnecessary features and assumes they are equivalent in power, but with &quot;other hairy stuff thrown in as well&quot;. When Graham considers the point of view of a programmer using a language higher than Blub, he describes that programmer as looking down on Blub and noting its &quot;missing&quot; features from the point of view of the higher language.

Graham describes this as &quot;the Blub paradox&quot; and concludes that &quot;By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful one.&quot;

The concept has been cited by programmers such as Joel Spolsky.

==Personal life==
In 2008, Graham married Jessica Livingston. They have two children, and have been living in England since 2016.

<doc id="173354" wikidata="Q184199" url="?curid=173354" title="Automation">
<text>Automation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention in processes, mainly by predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and related actions, as well as embodying those predeterminations in machines. Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes, and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.

Automation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention. Examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has also found a home in the banking industry. It can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms in terms of control complexity.

In the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th. The term &quot;automation&quot;, inspired by the earlier word &quot;automatic&quot; (coming from &quot;automaton&quot;), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department. It was during this time that the industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.

The World Bank&#x27;s World Development Report of 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation. Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation have been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist, protectionist and populist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since the 2010s.

==History==

===Early history===
It was a preoccupation of the Greeks and Arabs (in the period between about 300 BC and about 1200 AD) to keep accurate track of time. In Ptolemaic Egypt, about 270 BC, Ctesibius described a float regulator for a water clock, a device not unlike the ball and cock in a modern flush toilet. This was the earliest feedback-controlled mechanism. The appearance of the mechanical clock in the 14th century made the water clock and its feedback control system obsolete.

The Persian Banū Mūsā brothers, in their &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot; (850 AD), described a number of automatic controls. Two-step level controls for fluids, a form of discontinuous variable structure controls, were developed by the Banu Musa brothers. They also described a feedback controller. The design of feedback control systems up through the Industrial Revolution was by trial-and-error, together with a great deal of engineering intuition. It was not until the mid-19th century that the stability of feedback control systems was analyzed using mathematics, the formal language of automatic control theory.

The centrifugal governor was invented by Christiaan Huygens in the seventeenth century, and used to adjust the gap between millstones.

===Industrial Revolution in Western Europe===
The introduction of prime movers, or self-driven machines advanced grain mills, furnaces, boilers, and the steam engine created a new requirement for automatic control systems including temperature regulators (invented in 1624; see Cornelius Drebbel), pressure regulators (1681), float regulators (1700) and speed control devices. Another control mechanism was used to tent the sails of windmills. It was patented by Edmund Lee in 1745. Also in 1745, Jacques de Vaucanson invented the first automated loom. Around 1800, Joseph Marie Jacquard created a punch-card system to program looms.

In 1771 Richard Arkwright invented the first fully automated spinning mill driven by water power, known at the time as the water frame. An automatic flour mill was developed by Oliver Evans in 1785, making it the first completely automated industrial process.

A centrifugal governor was used by Mr. Bunce of England in 1784 as part of a model steam crane. The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt&#x27;s partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill Boulton &amp; Watt were building. The governor could not actually hold a set speed; the engine would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes. The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.

Several improvements to the governor, plus improvements to valve cut-off timing on the steam engine, made the engine suitable for most industrial uses before the end of the 19th century. Advances in the steam engine stayed well ahead of science, both thermodynamics and control theory. The governor received relatively little scientific attention until James Clerk Maxwell published a paper that established the beginning of a theoretical basis for understanding control theory.

=== 20th century ===
Relay logic was introduced with factory electrification, which underwent rapid adaption from 1900 through the 1920s. Central electric power stations were also undergoing rapid growth and the operation of new high-pressure boilers, steam turbines and electrical substations created a large demand for instruments and controls. Central control rooms became common in the 1920s, but as late as the early 1930s, most process controls were on-off. Operators typically monitored charts drawn by recorders that plotted data from instruments. To make corrections, operators manually opened or closed valves or turned switches on or off. Control rooms also used color-coded lights to send signals to workers in the plant to manually make certain changes.

The development of the electronic amplifier during the 1920s, which was important for long-distance telephony, required a higher signal-to-noise ratio, which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation. This and other telephony applications contributed to the control theory. In the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician Irmgard Flügge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic controls, which found military applications during the Second World War to fire control systems and aircraft navigation systems.

Controllers, which were able to make calculated changes in response to deviations from a set point rather than on-off control, began being introduced in the 1930s. Controllers allowed manufacturing to continue showing productivity gains to offset the declining influence of factory electrification.

Factory productivity was greatly increased by electrification in the 1920s. U.S. manufacturing productivity growth fell from 5.2%/yr 1919–29 to 2.76%/yr 1929–41. Alexander Field notes that spending on non-medical instruments increased significantly from 1929 to 1933 and remained strong thereafter.

The First and Second World Wars saw major advancements in the field of mass communication and signal processing. Other key advances in automatic controls include differential equations, stability theory and system theory (1938), frequency domain analysis (1940), ship control (1950), and stochastic analysis (1941).

Starting in 1958, various systems based on solid-state digital logic modules for hard-wired programmed logic controllers (the predecessors of programmable logic controllers [PLC]) emerged to replace electro-mechanical relay logic in industrial control systems for process control and automation, including early Telefunken/AEG Logistat, Siemens Simatic, Philips/Mullard/ Norbit, BBC Sigmatronic, ACEC Logacec, Estacord, Krone Mibakron, Bistat, Datapac, Norlog, SSR, or Procontic systems.

In 1959 Texaco&#x27;s Port Arthur Refinery became the first chemical plant to use digital control.
Conversion of factories to digital control began to spread rapidly in the 1970s as the price of computer hardware fell.

===Significant applications===
The automatic telephone switchboard was introduced in 1892 along with dial telephones. By 1929, 31.9% of the Bell system was automatic. Automatic telephone switching originally used vacuum tube amplifiers and electro-mechanical switches, which consumed a large amount of electricity. Call volume eventually grew so fast that it was feared the telephone system would consume all electricity production, prompting Bell Labs to begin research on the transistor.

The logic performed by telephone switching relays was the inspiration for the digital computer.
The first commercially successful glass bottle-blowing machine was an automatic model introduced in 1905. The machine, operated by a two-man crew working 12-hour shifts, could produce 17,280 bottles in 24 hours, compared to 2,880 bottles made by a crew of six men and boys working in a shop for a day. The cost of making bottles by machine was 10 to 12 cents per gross compared to $1.80 per gross by the manual glassblowers and helpers.

Sectional electric drives were developed using control theory. Sectional electric drives are used on different sections of a machine where a precise differential must be maintained between the sections. In steel rolling, the metal elongates as it passes through pairs of rollers, which must run at successively faster speeds. In paper making paper, the sheet shrinks as it passes around steam-heated drying arranged in groups, which must run at successively slower speeds. The first application of a sectional electric drive was on a paper machine in 1919. One of the most important developments in the steel industry during the 20th century was continuous wide strip rolling, developed by Armco in 1928.

Before automation, many chemicals were made in batches. In 1930, with the widespread use of instruments and the emerging use of controllers, the founder of Dow Chemical Co. was advocating continuous production.

Self-acting machine tools that displaced hand dexterity so they could be operated by boys and unskilled laborers were developed by James Nasmyth in the 1840s. Machine tools were automated with Numerical control (NC) using punched paper tape in the 1950s. This soon evolved into computerized numerical control (CNC).

Today extensive automation is practiced in practically every type of manufacturing and assembly process. Some of the larger processes include electrical power generation, oil refining, chemicals, steel mills, plastics, cement plants, fertilizer plants, pulp and paper mills, automobile and truck assembly, aircraft production, glass manufacturing, natural gas separation plants, food and beverage processing, canning and bottling and manufacture of various kinds of parts. Robots are especially useful in hazardous applications like automobile spray painting. Robots are also used to assemble electronic circuit boards. Automotive welding is done with robots and automatic welders are used in applications like pipelines.

===Space/computer age===

With the advent of the space age in 1957, controls design, particularly in the United States, turned away from the frequency-domain techniques of classical control theory and backed into the differential equation techniques of the late 19th century, which were couched in the time domain. During the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician Irmgard Flugge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control, which became widely used in hysteresis control systems such as navigation systems, fire-control systems, and electronics. Through Flugge-Lotz and others, the modern era saw time-domain design for nonlinear systems (1961), navigation (1960), optimal control and estimation theory (1962), nonlinear control theory (1969), digital control and filtering theory (1974), and the personal computer (1983).

== Advantages, disadvantages, and limitations ==

Perhaps the most cited advantage of automation in industry is that it is associated with faster production and cheaper labor costs. Another benefit could be that it replaces hard, physical, or monotonous work. Additionally, tasks that take place in hazardous environments or that are otherwise beyond human capabilities can be done by machines, as machines can operate even under extreme temperatures or in atmospheres that are radioactive or toxic. They can also be maintained with simple quality checks. However, at the time being, not all tasks can be automated, and some tasks are more expensive to automate than others. Initial costs of installing the machinery in factory settings are high, and failure to maintain a system could result in the loss of the product itself.

Moreover, some studies seem to indicate that industrial automation could impose ill effects beyond operational concerns, including worker displacement due to systemic loss of employment and compounded environmental damage; however, these findings are both convoluted and controversial in nature, and could potentially be circumvented.

The main advantages of automation are:
*Increased throughput or productivity
*Improved quality
*Increased predictability
*Improved robustness (consistency), of processes or product
*Increased consistency of output
*Reduced direct human labor costs and expenses
*Reduced cycle time
*Increased accuracy
*Relieving humans of monotonously repetitive work
*Required work in development, deployment, maintenance, and operation of automated processes — often structured as &quot;jobs&quot;
*Increased human freedom to do other things

Automation primarily describes machines replacing human action, but it is also loosely associated with mechanization, machines replacing human labor. Coupled with mechanization, extending human capabilities in terms of size, strength, speed, endurance, visual range &amp; acuity, hearing frequency &amp; precision, electromagnetic sensing &amp; effecting, etc., advantages include:
*Relieving humans of dangerous work stresses and occupational injuries (e.g., fewer strained backs from lifting heavy objects)
*Removing humans from dangerous environments (e.g. fire, space, volcanoes, nuclear facilities, underwater, etc.)

The main disadvantages of automation are:
*High initial cost
*Faster production without human intervention can mean faster unchecked production of defects where automated processes are defective.
*Scaled-up capacities can mean scaled-up problems when systems fail — releasing dangerous toxins, forces, energies, etc., at scaled-up rates.
*Human adaptiveness is often poorly understood by automation initiators. It is often difficult to anticipate every contingency and develop fully preplanned automated responses for every situation. The discoveries inherent in automating processes can require unanticipated iterations to resolve, causing unanticipated costs and delays.
*People anticipating employment income may be seriously disrupted by others deploying automation where no similar income is readily available.

=== Paradox of automation ===
The paradox of automation says that the more efficient the automated system, the more crucial the human contribution of the operators. Humans are less involved, but their involvement becomes more critical. Lisanne Bainbridge, a cognitive psychologist, identified these issues notably in her widely cited paper &quot;Ironies of Automation.&quot; If an automated system has an error, it will multiply that error until it is fixed or shut down. This is where human operators come in. A fatal example of this was Air France Flight 447, where a failure of automation put the pilots into a manual situation they were not prepared for.

===Limitations===

* Current technology is unable to automate all the desired tasks.
* Many operations using automation have large amounts of invested capital and produce high volumes of products, making malfunctions extremely costly and potentially hazardous. Therefore, some personnel is needed to ensure that the entire system functions properly and that safety and product quality are maintained.
* As a process becomes increasingly automated, there is less and less labor to be saved or quality improvement to be gained. This is an example of both diminishing returns and the logistic function.
* As more and more processes become automated, there are fewer remaining non-automated processes. This is an example of the exhaustion of opportunities. New technological paradigms may, however, set new limits that surpass the previous limits.

====Current limitations====
Many roles for humans in industrial processes presently lie beyond the scope of automation. Human-level pattern recognition, language comprehension, and language production ability are well beyond the capabilities of modern mechanical and computer systems (but see &quot;Watson computer&quot;). Tasks requiring subjective assessment or synthesis of complex sensory data, such as scents and sounds, as well as high-level tasks such as strategic planning, currently require human expertise. In many cases, the use of humans is more cost-effective than mechanical approaches even where the automation of industrial tasks is possible. Therefore, algorithmic management as the digital rationalization of human labor instead of its substitution has emerged as an alternative technological strategy. Overcoming these obstacles is a theorized path to post-scarcity economics.

===Societal impact and unemployment===
Increased automation often causes workers to feel anxious about losing their jobs as technology renders their skills or experience unnecessary. Early in the Industrial Revolution, when inventions like the steam engine were making some job categories expendable, workers forcefully resisted these changes. Luddites, for instance, were English textile workers who protested the introduction of weaving machines by destroying them. More recently, some residents of Chandler, Arizona, have slashed tires and pelted rocks at self-driving car, in protest over the cars&#x27; perceived threat to human safety and job prospects.

The relative anxiety about automation reflected in opinion polls seems to correlate closely with the strength of organized labor in that region or nation. For example, while a study by the Pew Research Center indicated that 72% of Americans are worried about increasing automation in the workplace, 80% of Swedes see automation and artificial intelligence (AI) as a good thing, due to the country&#x27;s still-powerful unions and a more robust national safety net.

According to one estimate, 47% of all current jobs in the US have the potential to be fully automated by 2033. Furthermore, wages and educational attainment appear to be strongly negatively correlated with an occupation&#x27;s risk of being automated. Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue that &quot;there&#x27;s never been a better time to be a worker with special skills or the right education, because these people can use technology to create and capture value. However, there&#x27;s never been a worse time to be a worker with only &#x27;ordinary&#x27; skills and abilities to offer, because computers, robots, and other digital technologies are acquiring these skills and abilities at an extraordinary rate.&quot; Others however argue that highly skilled professional jobs like a lawyer, doctor, engineer, journalist are also at risk of automation.

According to a 2020 study in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot;, automation has robust negative effects on employment and wages: &quot;One more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment-to-population ratio by 0.2 percentage points and wages by 0.42%.&quot; A 2025 study in the &quot;American Economic Journal&quot; found that the introduction of industrial robots reduced 1993 and 2014 led to reduced employment of men and women by 3.7 and 1.6 percentage points.

Research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of the Oxford Martin School argued that employees engaged in &quot;tasks following well-defined procedures that can easily be performed by sophisticated algorithms&quot; are at risk of displacement, and 47% of jobs in the US were at risk. The study, released as a working paper in 2013 and published in 2017, predicted that automation would put low-paid physical occupations most at risk, by surveying a group of colleagues on their opinions. However, according to a study published in &quot;McKinsey Quarterly&quot; in 2015 the impact of computerization in most cases is not the replacement of employees but the automation of portions of the tasks they perform. The methodology of the McKinsey study has been heavily criticized for being intransparent and relying on subjective assessments. The methodology of Frey and Osborne has been subjected to criticism, as lacking evidence, historical awareness, or credible methodology. Additionally, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that across the 21 OECD countries, 9% of jobs are automatable.

Based on a formula by Gilles Saint-Paul, an economist at Toulouse 1 University, the demand for unskilled human capital declines at a slower rate than the demand for skilled human capital increases. In the long run and for society as a whole it has led to cheaper products, lower average work hours, and new industries forming (i.e., robotics industries, computer industries, design industries). These new industries provide many high salary skill-based jobs to the economy. By 2030, between 3 and 14 percent of the global workforce will be forced to switch job categories due to automation eliminating jobs in an entire sector. While the number of jobs lost to automation is often offset by jobs gained from technological advances, the same type of job loss is not the same one replaced and that leading to increasing unemployment in the lower-middle class. This occurs largely in the US and developed countries where technological advances contribute to higher demand for highly skilled labor but demand for middle-wage labor continues to fall. Economists call this trend &quot;income polarization&quot; where unskilled labor wages are driven down and skilled labor is driven up and it is predicted to continue in developed economies.

==Lights-out manufacturing==

Lights-out manufacturing is a production system with no human workers, to eliminate labor costs. It grew in popularity in the U.S. when General Motors in 1982 implemented humans &quot;hands-off&quot; manufacturing to &quot;replace risk-averse bureaucracy with automation and robots&quot;. However, the factory never reached full &quot;lights out&quot; status.

The expansion of lights out manufacturing requires:
* Reliability of equipment
* Long-term mechanic capabilities
* Planned preventive maintenance
* Commitment from the staff

==Health and environment==
The costs of automation to the environment are different depending on the technology, product or engine automated. There are automated engines that consume more energy resources from the Earth in comparison with previous engines and vice versa. Hazardous operations, such as oil refining, the manufacturing of industrial chemicals, and all forms of metal working, were always early contenders for automation.

The automation of vehicles could prove to have a substantial impact on the environment, although the nature of this impact could be beneficial or harmful depending on several factors. Because automated vehicles are much less likely to get into accidents compared to human-driven vehicles, some precautions built into current models (such as anti-lock brakes or laminated glass) would not be required for self-driving versions. Removal of these safety features reduces the weight of the vehicle, and coupled with more precise acceleration and braking, as well as fuel-efficient route mapping, can increase fuel economy and reduce emissions. Despite this, some researchers theorize that an increase in the production of self-driving cars could lead to a boom in vehicle ownership and usage, which could potentially negate any environmental benefits of self-driving cars if they are used more frequently.

Automation of homes and home appliances is also thought to impact the environment. A study of energy consumption of automated homes in Finland showed that smart homes could reduce energy consumption by monitoring levels of consumption in different areas of the home and adjusting consumption to reduce energy leaks (e.g. automatically reducing consumption during the nighttime when activity is low). This study, along with others, indicated that the smart home&#x27;s ability to monitor and adjust consumption levels would reduce unnecessary energy usage. However, some research suggests that smart homes might not be as efficient as non-automated homes. A more recent study has indicated that, while monitoring and adjusting consumption levels do decrease unnecessary energy use, this process requires monitoring systems that also consume an amount of energy. The energy required to run these systems sometimes negates their benefits, resulting in little to no ecological benefit.

==Convertibility and turnaround time==
Another major shift in automation is the increased demand for flexibility and convertibility in manufacturing processes. Manufacturers are increasingly demanding the ability to easily switch from manufacturing Product A to manufacturing Product B without having to completely rebuild the production lines. Flexibility and distributed processes have led to the introduction of Automated Guided Vehicles with Natural Features Navigation.

Digital electronics helped too. Former analog-based instrumentation was replaced by digital equivalents which can be more accurate and flexible, and offer greater scope for more sophisticated configuration, parametrization, and operation. This was accompanied by the fieldbus revolution which provided a networked (i.e. a single cable) means of communicating between control systems and field-level instrumentation, eliminating hard-wiring.

Discrete manufacturing plants adopted these technologies fast. The more conservative process industries with their longer plant life cycles have been slower to adopt and analog-based measurement and control still dominate. The growing use of Industrial Ethernet on the factory floor is pushing these trends still further, enabling manufacturing plants to be integrated more tightly within the enterprise, via the internet if necessary. Global competition has also increased demand for Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems.

==Automation tools==
Engineers can now have numerical control over automated devices. The result has been a rapidly expanding range of applications and human activities. Computer-aided technologies (or CAx) now serve as the basis for mathematical and organizational tools used to create complex systems. Notable examples of CAx include computer-aided design (CAD software) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM software). The improved design, analysis, and manufacture of products enabled by CAx has been beneficial for industry.

Information technology, together with industrial machinery and processes, can assist in the design, implementation, and monitoring of control systems. One example of an industrial control system is a programmable logic controller (PLC). PLCs are specialized hardened computers which are frequently used to synchronize the flow of inputs from (physical) sensors and events with the flow of outputs to actuators and events.
Human-machine interfaces (HMI) or computer human interfaces (CHI), formerly known as &quot;man-machine interfaces&quot;, are usually employed to communicate with PLCs and other computers. Service personnel who monitor and control through HMIs can be called by different names. In the industrial process and manufacturing environments, they are called operators or something similar. In boiler houses and central utility departments, they are called &quot;stationary engineers&quot;.

Different types of automation tools exist:
* ANN – Artificial neural network
* DCS – Distributed control system
* HMI – Human machine interface
* RPA – Robotic process automation
* SCADA – Supervisory control and data acquisition
* PLC – Programmable logic controller
* Instrumentation
* Motion control
* Robotics

Host simulation software (HSS) is a commonly used testing tool that is used to test the equipment software. HSS is used to test equipment performance concerning factory automation standards (timeouts, response time, processing time).

== Cognitive automation ==
Cognitive automation, as a subset of AI, is an emerging genus of automation enabled by cognitive computing. Its primary concern is the automation of clerical tasks and workflows that consist of structuring unstructured data. Cognitive automation relies on multiple disciplines: natural language processing, real-time computing, machine learning algorithms, big data analytics, and evidence-based learning.

According to Deloitte, cognitive automation enables the replication of human tasks and judgment &quot;at rapid speeds and considerable scale.&quot; Such tasks include:
*Document redaction
*Data extraction and document synthesis / reporting
*Contract management
*Natural language search
* Customer, employee, and stakeholder onboarding
* Manual activities and verifications
* Follow-up and email communications

==Recent and emerging applications==
===CAD AI===
Artificially intelligent computer-aided design (CAD) can use text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and video-to-3D to automate in 3D modeling. AI CAD libraries could also be developed using linked open data of schematics and diagrams. Ai CAD assistants are used as tools to help streamline workflow.

=== Automated power production ===
Technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and other renewable energy sources—together with smart grids, micro-grids, battery storage—can automate power production.

=== Agricultural production ===

Many agricultural operations are automated with machinery and equipment to improve their diagnosis, decision-making and/or performing. Agricultural automation can relieve the drudgery of agricultural work, improve the timeliness and precision of agricultural operations, raise productivity and resource-use efficiency, build resilience, and improve food quality and safety. Increased productivity can free up labour, allowing agricultural households to spend more time elsewhere.

The technological evolution in agriculture has resulted in progressive shifts to digital equipment and robotics. Motorized mechanization using engine power automates the performance of agricultural operations such as ploughing and milking. With digital automation technologies, it also becomes possible to automate diagnosis and decision-making of agricultural operations. For example, autonomous crop robots can harvest and seed crops, while drones can gather information to help automate input application. Precision agriculture often employs such automation technologies

Motorized mechanization has generally increased in recent years. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where the adoption of motorized mechanization has stalled over the past decades.

Automation technologies are increasingly used for managing livestock, though evidence on adoption is lacking. Global automatic milking system sales have increased over recent years, but adoption is likely mostly in Northern Europe, and likely almost absent in low- and middle-income countries. Automated feeding machines for both cows and poultry also exist, but data and evidence regarding their adoption trends and drivers is likewise scarce.

===Retail===

Many supermarkets and even smaller stores are rapidly introducing self-checkout systems reducing the need for employing checkout workers. In the U.S., the retail industry employs 15.9 million people as of 2017 (around 1 in 9 Americans in the workforce). Globally, an estimated 192 million workers could be affected by automation according to research by Eurasia Group.
 Online shopping could be considered a form of automated retail as the payment and checkout are through an automated online transaction processing system, with the share of online retail accounting jumping from 5.1% in 2011 to 8.3% in 2016. However, two-thirds of books, music, and films are now purchased online. In addition, automation and online shopping could reduce demands for shopping malls, and retail property, which in the United States is currently estimated to account for 31% of all commercial property or around . Amazon has gained much of the growth in recent years for online shopping, accounting for half of the growth in online retail in 2016. Other forms of automation can also be an integral part of online shopping, for example, the deployment of automated warehouse robotics such as that applied by Amazon using Kiva Systems.

===Food and drink===
The food retail industry has started to apply automation to the ordering process; McDonald&#x27;s has introduced touch screen ordering and payment systems in many of its restaurants, reducing the need for as many cashier employees. The University of Texas at Austin has introduced fully automated cafe retail locations. Some cafes and restaurants have utilized mobile and tablet &quot;apps&quot; to make the ordering process more efficient by customers ordering and paying on their device. Some restaurants have automated food delivery to tables of customers using a conveyor belt system. The use of robots is sometimes employed to replace waiting staff.

===Construction===

Automation in construction is the combination of methods, processes, and systems that allow for greater machine autonomy in construction activities. Construction automation may have multiple goals, including but not limited to, reducing jobsite injuries, decreasing activity completion times, and assisting with quality control and quality assurance.

===Mining===
 Automated mining involves the removal of human labor from the mining process. The mining industry is currently in the transition towards automation. Currently, it can still require a large amount of human capital, particularly in the third world where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency through automation.

===Video surveillance===

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started the research and development of automated visual surveillance and monitoring (VSAM) program, between 1997 and 1999, and airborne video surveillance (AVS) programs, from 1998 to 2002. Currently, there is a major effort underway in the vision community to develop a fully-automated tracking surveillance system. Automated video surveillance monitors people and vehicles in real-time within a busy environment. Existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe, i.e., indoor, outdoor or airborne, the number of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensors, i.e., stationary camera vs. mobile camera. The purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area, generate warnings or notify the designated authorities in case of occurrence of particular events.

===Highway systems===
As demands for safety and mobility have grown and technological possibilities have multiplied, interest in automation has grown. Seeking to accelerate the development and introduction of fully automated vehicles and highways, the U.S. Congress authorized more than $650 million over six years for intelligent transport systems (ITS) and demonstration projects in the 1991 &quot;Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act&quot; (ISTEA). Congress legislated in ISTEA that:[T]he Secretary of Transportation shall develop an automated highway and vehicle prototype from which future fully automated intelligent vehicle-highway systems can be developed. Such development shall include research in human factors to ensure the success of the man-machine relationship. The goal of this program is to have the first fully automated highway roadway or an automated test track in operation by 1997. This system shall accommodate the installation of equipment in new and existing motor vehicles.Full automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor, computer, and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway. Fully automated driving would, in theory, allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds, which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible, politically unacceptable, or prohibitively expensive. Automated controls also might enhance road safety by reducing the opportunity for driver error, which causes a large share of motor vehicle crashes. Other potential benefits include improved air quality (as a result of more-efficient traffic flows), increased fuel economy, and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems.

===Waste management===

Automated waste collection trucks prevent the need for as many workers as well as easing the level of labor required to provide the service.

===Business process===

Business process automation (BPA) is the technology-enabled automation of complex business processes. It can help to streamline a business for simplicity, achieve digital transformation, increase service quality, improve service delivery or contain costs. BPA consists of integrating applications, restructuring labor resources and using software applications throughout the organization. Robotic process automation (RPA; or RPAAI for self-guided RPA 2.0) is an emerging field within BPA and uses AI. BPAs can be implemented in a number of business areas including marketing, sales and workflow.

===Home===

Home automation (also called domotics) designates an emerging practice of increased automation of household appliances and features in residential dwellings, particularly through electronic means that allow for things impracticable, overly expensive or simply not possible in recent past decades. The rise in the usage of home automation solutions has taken a turn reflecting the increased dependency of people on such automation solutions. However, the increased comfort that gets added through these automation solutions is remarkable.

===Laboratory===


Automation is essential for many scientific and clinical applications. Therefore, automation has been extensively employed in laboratories. From as early as 1980 fully automated laboratories have already been working. However, automation has not become widespread in laboratories due to its high cost. This may change with the ability of integrating low-cost devices with standard laboratory equipment. Autosamplers are common devices used in laboratory automation.

===Logistics automation===
Logistics automation is the application of computer software or automated machinery to improve the efficiency of logistics operations. Typically this refers to operations within a warehouse or distribution center, with broader tasks undertaken by supply chain engineering systems and enterprise resource planning systems.

===Industrial automation===
Industrial automation deals primarily with the automation of manufacturing, quality control, and material handling processes. General-purpose controllers for industrial processes include programmable logic controllers, stand-alone I/O modules, and computers. Industrial automation is to replace the human action and manual command-response activities with the use of mechanized equipment and logical programming commands. One trend is increased use of machine vision to provide automatic inspection and robot guidance functions, another is a continuing increase in the use of robots. Industrial automation is simply required in industries.

====Industrial Automation and Industry 4.0====
The rise of industrial automation is directly tied to the &quot;Fourth Industrial Revolution&quot;, which is better known now as Industry 4.0. Originating from Germany, Industry 4.0 encompasses numerous devices, concepts, and machines, as well as the advancement of the industrial internet of things (IIoT). An &quot;Internet of Things is a seamless integration of diverse physical objects in the Internet through a virtual representation.&quot; These new revolutionary advancements have drawn attention to the world of automation in an entirely new light and shown ways for it to grow to increase productivity and efficiency in machinery and manufacturing facilities. Industry 4.0 works with the IIoT and software/hardware to connect in a way that (through communication technologies) add enhancements and improve manufacturing processes. Being able to create smarter, safer, and more advanced manufacturing is now possible with these new technologies. It opens up a manufacturing platform that is more reliable, consistent, and efficient than before. Implementation of systems such as SCADA is an example of software that takes place in Industrial Automation today. SCADA is a supervisory data collection software, just one of the many used in Industrial Automation. Industry 4.0 vastly covers many areas in manufacturing and will continue to do so as time goes on.

====Industrial robotics====

Industrial robotics is a sub-branch in industrial automation that aids in various manufacturing processes. Such manufacturing processes include machining, welding, painting, assembling and material handling to name a few. Industrial robots use various mechanical, electrical as well as software systems to allow for high precision, accuracy and speed that far exceed any human performance. The birth of industrial robots came shortly after World War II as the U.S. saw the need for a quicker way to produce industrial and consumer goods. Servos, digital logic and solid-state electronics allowed engineers to build better and faster systems and over time these systems were improved and revised to the point where a single robot is capable of running 24 hours a day with little or no maintenance. In 1997, there were 700,000 industrial robots in use, the number has risen to 1.8M in 2017 In recent years, AI with robotics is also used in creating an automatic labeling solution, using robotic arms as the automatic label applicator, and AI for learning and detecting the products to be labelled.

====Programmable Logic Controllers====
Industrial automation incorporates programmable logic controllers in the manufacturing process. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) use a processing system which allows for variation of controls of inputs and outputs using simple programming. PLCs make use of programmable memory, storing instructions and functions like logic, sequencing, timing, counting, etc. Using a logic-based language, a PLC can receive a variety of inputs and return a variety of logical outputs, the input devices being sensors and output devices being motors, valves, etc. PLCs are similar to computers, however, while computers are optimized for calculations, PLCs are optimized for control tasks and use in industrial environments. They are built so that only basic logic-based programming knowledge is needed and to handle vibrations, high temperatures, humidity, and noise. The greatest advantage PLCs offer is their flexibility. With the same basic controllers, a PLC can operate a range of different control systems. PLCs make it unnecessary to rewire a system to change the control system. This flexibility leads to a cost-effective system for complex and varied control systems.

PLCs can range from small &quot;building brick&quot; devices with tens of I/O in a housing integral with the processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with a count of thousands of I/O, and which are often networked to other PLC and SCADA systems.

They can be designed for multiple arrangements of digital and analog inputs and outputs (I/O), extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise, and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or non-volatile memory.

It was from the automotive industry in the United States that the PLC was born. Before the PLC, control, sequencing, and safety interlock logic for manufacturing automobiles was mainly composed of relays, cam timers, drum sequencers, and dedicated closed-loop controllers. Since these could number in the hundreds or even thousands, the process for updating such facilities for the yearly model change-over was very time-consuming and expensive, as electricians needed to individually rewire the relays to change their operational characteristics.

When digital computers became available, being general-purpose programmable devices, they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes. However, these early computers required specialist programmers and stringent operating environmental control for temperature, cleanliness, and power quality. To meet these challenges, the PLC was developed with several key attributes. It would tolerate the shop-floor environment, it would support discrete (bit-form) input and output in an easily extensible manner, it would not require years of training to use, and it would permit its operation to be monitored. Since many industrial processes have timescales easily addressed by millisecond response times, modern (fast, small, reliable) electronics greatly facilitate building reliable controllers, and performance could be traded off for reliability.

====Agent-assisted automation====

Agent-assisted automation refers to automation used by call center agents to handle customer inquiries. The key benefit of agent-assisted automation is compliance and error-proofing. Agents are sometimes not fully trained or they forget or ignore key steps in the process. The use of automation ensures that what is supposed to happen on the call actually does, every time. There are two basic types: desktop automation and automated voice solutions.

==Control==


=== Open-loop and closed-loop ===
=== Discrete control (on/off) ===
One of the simplest types of control is &quot;on-off&quot; control. An example is a thermostat used on household appliances which either open or close an electrical contact. (Thermostats were originally developed as true feedback-control mechanisms rather than the on-off common household appliance thermostat.)

Sequence control, in which a programmed sequence of &quot;discrete&quot; operations is performed, often based on system logic that involves system states. An elevator control system is an example of sequence control.

===PID controller===

A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism (controller) widely used in industrial control systems.

In a PID loop, the controller continuously calculates an &quot;error value&quot; formula_1 as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms, respectively (sometimes denoted &quot;P&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;) which give their name to the controller type.

The theoretical understanding and application date from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analog control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers.

===Sequential control and logical sequence or system state control===
Sequential control may be either to a fixed sequence or to a logical one that will perform different actions depending on various system states. An example of an adjustable but otherwise fixed sequence is a timer on a lawn sprinkler.

States refer to the various conditions that can occur in a use or sequence scenario of the system. An example is an elevator, which uses logic based on the system state to perform certain actions in response to its state and operator input. For example, if the operator presses the floor n button, the system will respond depending on whether the elevator is stopped or moving, going up or down, or if the door is open or closed, and other conditions.

Early development of sequential control was relay logic, by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt power to a device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.

The total number of relays and cam timers can number into the hundreds or even thousands in some factories. Early programming techniques and languages were needed to make such systems manageable, one of the first being ladder logic, where diagrams of the interconnected relays resembled the rungs of a ladder. Special computers called programmable logic controllers were later designed to replace these collections of hardware with a single, more easily re-programmed unit.

In a typical hard-wired motor start and stop circuit (called a &quot;control circuit&quot;) a motor is started by pushing a &quot;Start&quot; or &quot;Run&quot; button that activates a pair of electrical relays. The &quot;lock-in&quot; relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push-button is released. (The start button is a normally open contact and the stop button is a normally closed contact.) Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch (three sets of contacts for three-phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact. This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches. The &quot;lock-in&quot; contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;off&quot; button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay.

Commonly interlocks are added to a control circuit. Suppose that the motor in the example is powering machinery that has a critical need for lubrication. In this case, an interlock could be added to ensure that the oil pump is running before the motor starts. Timers, limit switches, and electric eyes are other common elements in control circuits.

Solenoid valves are widely used on compressed air or hydraulic fluid for powering actuators on mechanical components. While motors are used to supply continuous rotary motion, actuators are typically a better choice for intermittently creating a limited range of movement for a mechanical component, such as moving various mechanical arms, opening or closing valves, raising heavy press-rolls, applying pressure to presses.

===Computer control===
Computers can perform both sequential control and feedback control, and typically a single computer will do both in an industrial application. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are a type of special-purpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in relay logic–type systems. General-purpose process control computers have increasingly replaced stand-alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers. Process control computers can process data from a network of PLCs, instruments, and controllers to implement typical (such as PID) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control algorithms using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations. They can also analyze data and create real-time graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators, engineers, and management.

Control of an automated teller machine (ATM) is an example of an interactive process in which a computer will perform a logic-derived response to a user selection based on information retrieved from a networked database. The ATM process has similarities with other online transaction processes. The different logical responses are called &quot;scenarios&quot;. Such processes are typically designed with the aid of use cases and flowcharts, which guide the writing of the software code. The earliest feedback control mechanism was the water clock invented by Greek engineer Ctesibius (285–222 BC).

<doc id="173356" wikidata="Q902026" url="?curid=173356" title="Sharpless epoxidation">
<text>The Sharpless epoxidation reaction is an enantioselective chemical reaction to prepare 2,3-epoxyalcohols from primary and secondary allylic alcohols. The oxidizing agent is &quot;tert&quot;-butyl hydroperoxide. The method relies on a catalyst formed from titanium tetra(isopropoxide) and diethyl tartrate.
2,3-Epoxyalcohols can be converted into diols, aminoalcohols, and ethers. The reactants for the Sharpless epoxidation are commercially available and relatively inexpensive.
K. Barry Sharpless published a paper on the reaction in 1980 and was awarded the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this and related work on asymmetric oxidations. The prize was shared with William S. Knowles and Ryōji Noyori.

==Catalyst==
5–10 mol% of the catalyst is typical. The presence of 3Å molecular sieves (3Å MS) is necessary. The structure of the catalyst is uncertain although it is thought to be a dimer of [].

==Selectivity==
The epoxidation of allylic alcohols is a well-utilized conversion in fine chemical synthesis. The chirality of the product of a Sharpless epoxidation is sometimes predicted with the following mnemonic. A rectangle is drawn around the double bond in the same plane as the carbons of the double bond (the &quot;xy-plane&quot;), with the allylic alcohol in the bottom right corner and the other substituents in their appropriate corners. In this orientation, the (−) diester tartrate preferentially interacts with the top half of the molecule, and the (+) diester tartrate preferentially interacts with the bottom half of the molecule. This model seems to be valid despite substitution on the olefin. Selectivity decreases with larger R1, but increases with larger R2 and R3 (see introduction).

However, this method incorrectly predicts the product of allylic 1,2-diols.
==Kinetic resolution==
The Sharpless epoxidation can also give kinetic resolution of a racemic mixture of secondary 2,3-epoxyalcohols. While the yield of a kinetic resolution process cannot be higher than 50%, the enantiomeric excess approaches 100% in some reactions.
==Synthetic utility==
The Sharpless epoxidation is viable with a large range of primary and secondary alkenic alcohols. Furthermore, with the exception noted above, a given dialkyl tartrate will preferentially add to the same face independent of the substitution on the alkene.To demonstrate the synthetic utility of the Sharpless epoxidation, the Sharpless group created synthetic intermediates of various natural products: methymycin, erythromycin, leukotriene C-1, and (+)-disparlure.

As one of the few highly enantioselective reactions during its time, many manipulations of the 2,3-epoxyalcohols have been developed.

The Sharpless epoxidation has been used for the total synthesis of various saccharides, terpenes, leukotrienes, pheromones, and antibiotics.

The main drawback of this protocol is the necessity of the presence of an allylic alcohol. The Jacobsen epoxidation, an alternative method to enantioselectively oxidise alkenes, overcomes this issue and tolerates a wider array of functional groups. For specifically glycidic epoxides, the Jørgensen-Córdova epoxidation avoids the need to reduce the carbonyl and then reoxidize, and has more efficient catalyst turnover.

<doc id="173360" wikidata="Q3093305" url="?curid=173360" title="GNU Units">
<text>GNU Units is a cross-platform computer program for conversion of units of quantities. It has a database of measurement units, including esoteric and historical units. This for instance allows conversion of velocities specified in furlongs per fortnight, and pressures specified in tons per acre. Output units are checked for consistency with the input, allowing verification of conversion of complex expressions.

== History ==
GNU Units was written by Adrian Mariano as an implementation of the &quot;units&quot; utility included with the Unix operating system. It was originally available under a permissive license. The GNU variant is distributed under the GPL although the FreeBSD project maintains a free fork of units from before the license change.

=== &quot;units&quot; (Unix utility) ===
The original &quot;units&quot; program has been a standard part of Unix since the early Bell Laboratories versions.
Source code for a version very similar to the original is available from the Heirloom Project.

=== GNU implementation ===
GNU &quot;units&quot; includes several extensions to the original version, including
* Exponents can be written with codice_1 or codice_2.
* Exponents can be larger than 9 if written with codice_1 or codice_2.
* Rational and decimal exponents are supported.
* Sums of units (e.g., codice_5) can be converted.
* Conversions can be made &quot;to&quot; sums of units, termed &quot;unit lists&quot; (e.g., from degrees to degrees, minutes, and seconds).
* Units that measure reciprocal dimensions can be converted (e.g., codice_6 to codice_7).
* Parentheses for grouping are supported. This sometimes allows more natural expressions, such as in the example given in Complex units expressions.
* Roots of units (e.g., codice_5 can be computed.
* Affine units conversions (e.g., °F to °C) are supported.
* Functions such as sin, cos, ln, log, and log2 are included.
* A script for updating the currency conversions is included; the script requires Python.

Units definitions, including nonlinear conversions and unit lists, are user extensible.

The plain text database &quot;definitions.units&quot; is a good reference in itself, as it is extensively commented and cites numerous sources.

=== Other implementations ===
&quot;UDUNITS&quot; is a similar utility program, except that it has an additional programming library interface and date conversion abilities. UDUNITS is considered the &quot;de facto&quot; program and library for variable unit conversion for netCDF files.

=== Version history ===
GNU Units version 2.19 was released on 31 May 2019, to reflect the 2019 revision of the SI; Version 2.14 released on 8 March 2017 fixed several minor bugs and improved support for building on Windows. Version 2.10, released on 26 March 2014, added support for rational exponents greater than one, and added the ability to save an interactive session in a file to provide a record of the conversions performed. Beginning with version 2.10, a 32-bit Windows binary distribution has been available on the project Web page (a 32-bit Windows port of version 1.87 has been available since 2008 as part of the GnuWin32 project).

Version 2.02, released on 11 July 2013, added hexadecimal floating-point output and two other options to simplify changing the output format.

Version 2.0, released on 2 July 2012, added the ability to convert to sums of units, such as hours and minutes or feet and inches. In addition, this release added support for UTF-8 encoding. Provision for locale-specific unit definitions was added. The syntax for defining non-linear units was changed, and added optional domain and range specifications. The names of the standard and personal units data files were changed, and the currency definitions were placed in a separate data file; a Python script for updating the currency definitions was added.

The version history is covered in detail in the NEWS file included with the source distribution.

== Usage ==

&quot;Units&quot; will output the result of the conversion in two lines. Usually, the first line (multiplication) is the desired result; the second line is the same conversion expressed as a division.

&quot;Units&quot; can also function as a general-purpose scientific calculator; it includes several built-in mathematical functions such as sin, cos, atan, ln, exp, etc.

Attempting to convert types of measurements that are incompatible will cause &quot;units&quot; to print a conformability error message and display a reduced form of each measurement.

== Examples ==
The examples that follow show results from GNU &quot;units&quot; version 2.10.

=== Interactive mode ===

The underscore (&#x27;_&#x27;) is used to indicate the result of the last successful unit conversion.

=== On the command line (non-interactive) ===
C:\&gt;units &quot;ten furlongs per fortnight&quot; &quot;kilometers per hour&quot;
 * 0.0059871429
 / 167.02458

% units cup ounces
conformability error
 0.00023658824 m^3
 0.028349523 kg
=== Complex units expressions ===
One form of the Darcy–Weisbach equation for fluid flow is
: formula_1
where Δ&quot;P&quot; is the pressure drop, &quot;ρ&quot; is the mass density, &quot;f&quot; is the (dimensionless) friction factor, &quot;L&quot; is the length of the pipe, &quot;Q&quot; is the volumetric flow rate, and &quot;d&quot; is the pipe diameter. It might be desirable to have the equation in the form
: formula_2
that would accept typical US units; the constant &quot;A&quot;1 could be determined manually using the unit-factor method, but it could be determined more quickly and easily using &quot;units&quot;:

$ units &quot;(8/pi^2)(lbm/ft^3)ft(ft^3/s)^2(1/in^5)&quot; psi
 * 43.533969
 / 0.022970568

Crane Technical Paper No. 410,
Eq. 3-5, gives the multiplicative value as 43.5.

<doc id="173362" wikidata="Q2993680" url="?curid=173362" title="Fortnight">
<text>A fortnight is a unit of time equal to 14 days (two weeks). The word derives from the Old English term , meaning &quot;&quot; (or &quot;fourteen days&quot;, since the Anglo-Saxons counted by nights).

==Astronomy and tides==
In astronomy, a &quot;lunar fortnight&quot; is half a lunar synodic month, which is equivalent to the mean period between a full moon and a new moon (and vice versa). This is equal to 14.07 days.
It gives rise to a lunar fortnightly tidal constituent (see: Long-period tides).

==Analogs and translations==
In many languages, there is no single word for a two-week period, and the equivalent terms &quot;two weeks&quot;, &quot;14 days&quot;, or &quot;15 days&quot; (counting inclusively) have to be used.

* Celtic languages: in Welsh, the term &quot;pythefnos&quot;, meaning &quot;15 nights&quot;, is used. This is in keeping with the Welsh term for a week, which is &quot;wythnos&quot; (&quot;eight nights&quot;). In Irish, the term is &quot;coicís&quot;.
* Similarly, in Greek, the term δεκαπενθήμερο (&quot;dekapenthímero&quot;), meaning &quot;15 days&quot;, is used.
* The Hindu calendar uses the Sanskrit word पक्ष &quot;pakṣa&quot;, meaning one half of a lunar month, which is between 14 and 15 solar days.
* In Romance languages there are the terms &quot;quincena&quot; (or &quot;quince días&quot;) in Galician and Spanish, &quot;quinzena&quot; or &quot;quinze dies&quot; in Catalan and &quot;quinze dias&quot; or &quot;quinzena&quot; in Portuguese, &quot;quindicina&quot; in Italian, &quot;quinze jours&quot; or &quot;quinzaine&quot; in French, and &quot;chenzină&quot; in Romanian, all meaning &quot;a grouping of 15&quot;.
* Semitic languages have a &quot;doubling suffix&quot;. When added at the end of the word for &quot;week&quot; it changes the meaning to &quot;two weeks&quot;. In Hebrew, the single-word &quot;שבועיים&quot; (&quot;shvu′ayim&quot;) means exactly &quot;two weeks&quot;. Also in Arabic, by adding the common dual suffix to the word for &quot;week&quot;, &quot;أسبوع&quot;, the form &quot;أسبوعين&quot; (&quot;usbu′ayn&quot;), meaning &quot;two weeks&quot;, is formed.
* Slavic languages: in Czech the terms &quot;čtrnáctidenní&quot; and &quot;dvoutýdenní&quot; have the same meaning as &quot;fortnight&quot;. In Ukrainian, the term &quot;два тижні&quot; is used in relation to &quot;biweekly, two weeks&quot;.

<text>In transportation, platooning or flocking is a method for driving a group of vehicles together. It is meant to increase the capacity of roads via an automated highway system.

Platoons decrease the distances between cars or trucks using electronic, and possibly mechanical, coupling. This capability would allow many cars or trucks to accelerate or brake simultaneously. This system also allows for a closer headway between vehicles by eliminating reacting distance needed for human reaction.

Platoon capability might require buying new vehicles, or it may be something that can be retrofitted. Drivers would probably need a special license endorsement on account of the new skills required and the added responsibility when driving in the lead.

Smart cars with artificial intelligence could automatically join and leave platoons. The automated highway system is a proposal for one such system, where cars organise themselves into platoons of 8 to 25.

== Potential benefits ==
* Greater fuel economy due to reduced air resistance and by reducing the need for acceleration, deceleration, and stopping to maintain traffic flow.
* Reduced congestion.
* Shorter commutes during peak periods.
* On longer highway trips, vehicles could be mostly unattended whilst in following mode.
* Vehicle to vehicle charging

==Potential disadvantages==
* Some systems have failed in traffic, as they have been hacked by remote computers, creating a hazardous situation.
* Drivers would be less in control of their own driving, being at the hands of computer software or the lead driver.
* Drivers may be less attentive than usual, and they may not be able to react as quickly to adverse situations if the software or hardware were to fail.
* The close spacing would not give drivers enough time to react to hazards if the software or hardware were to fail.
* Platooning is only possible when enough vehicles with the same software are driving together, and could be difficult in real-life situations with a mixture of vehicle types.
* Interactions between platooning and non-platooning vehicles in real-life situations may be difficult, due to differing requirements for headway and reaction time, different driving styles, and the possibility of a platoon blocking lane changes and merging traffic.
* In the event of a traffic collision with the lead vehicle, the entire platoon may be caught in a multiple-vehicle collision due to the reduced vehicle spacing.
* The close spacing of platooning vehicles may serve to further normalize tailgating among drivers of non-platooning vehicles, increasing dangerous driving behavior.

== Automated highway system ==
An automated highway system (AHS), or smart road, is a proposed intelligent transportation system technology designed to provide for driverless cars on specific right-of ways. It is most often recommended as a means of traffic congestion relief, on the grounds that it would drastically reduce following distances and headway, thus allowing a given stretch of road to carry more cars.

=== Principle ===
In one scheme, the roadway has magnetized stainless-steel spikes driven one meter apart in its center. The car senses the spikes to measure its speed and locate the center of the lane. Furthermore, the spikes can have either magnetic north or magnetic south facing up. The roadway thus provides small amounts of digital data describing interchanges and recommended speeds.

The cars have power steering and automatic speed controls, which are controlled by a computer.

The cars organize themselves into platoons of 8 to 25 cars. The cars within a platoon drive themselves a meter apart, so that air resistance is minimized. The distance between platoons is the conventional braking distance. If anything goes wrong, the maximum number of harmed cars should be one platoon.

An overview of platooning systems is given in Bergenhem 

Platooning of trucks has been proposed as a concept to reduce the energy consumption of semi-trucks and improve the feasibility of electric semi-trucks.

=== Early development ===
The origin of research on AHS was done by a team from Ohio State University led by Robert E. Fenton, based on funding from the U.S. Federal Highway Administration. Their first automated vehicle was built in 1962, and is believed to be the first land vehicle to contain a computer. Steering, braking and speed were controlled through the onboard electronics, which filled the trunk, back seat and most of the front of the passenger side of the car. Research continued at OSU until federal funding was cut in the early 1980s.

=== Deployments ===
====United States====
The USDOT-sponsored National Automated Highway System Consortium (NAHSC) project, a prototype automated highway system, was tested in San Diego County, California in 1997 along Interstate 15. However, despite the technical success of the program, investment has moved more toward autonomous intelligent vehicles rather than building specialized infrastructure. The AHS system places sensory technology in cars that can read passive road markings, and use radar and inter-car communications to make the cars organize themselves without the intervention of drivers. Such an autonomous cruise control system is being developed by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen and Toyota.

The Federal Highway Administration in 2013 funded two research projects in heavy truck platooning (without steering automation). One is led by Auburn University with Peterbilt, American Trucking Associations, Meritor Wabco, and Peloton Technology and the other is led by California Department of Transportation, with UC Berkeley and Volvo Trucks.

====SARTRE====

The SARTRE Project (Safe Road Trains for the Environment), is a European Commission funded project investigating implementation of platooning on unmodified European motorways. The project begun in September 2009, and vehicle platooning, as envisaged by the SARTRE project, is a convoy of vehicles in which a professional driver in a lead vehicle heads a line of closely following vehicles. Each following vehicle autonomously measures the distance, speed and direction and adjusts to the vehicle in front. Once in the platoon, drivers can do other things while the platoon proceeds towards its long-haul destination. All vehicles are detached and can leave the procession at any time.

In January 2011, SARTRE made the first successful demonstration of its platooning technology at the Volvo Proving Ground near Gothenburg, Sweden, in which a lead truck was followed by a car. In January 2012, SARTRE made a second demonstration in Barcelona, Spain, in which a lead truck was followed by three cars driven entirely autonomously at speeds of up to with a gap between of at most . The companies that participated in SARTRE were Volvo Trucks and Volvo Car Corporation.
;EU Truck Platooning Challenge
During its Presidency of the European Union in 2016, the Netherlands organised a European Truck Platooning Challenge. Six brands of automated trucks – DAF Trucks, Daimler Trucks, Iveco, MAN Truck &amp; Bus, Scania AB and Volvo Trucks – ran on public roads from several European cities to the Netherlands.

=== Japan ===
In January 2018, trucks from different manufacturers were successfully driven by platooning for the first time on the Shin-Tomei Expressway in Japan.

In February, 2021, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) successfully achieved traveling of trucks on part of the Shin-Tomei Expressway in a platoon in which no drivers were present in either the second or the following trucks, with staff in only the passenger seat for security purposes.

=== South Korea ===
In November 2019, Hyundai Motor Group successfully conducted its first platooning of trucks on a highway for the first time in Korea. Demonstrations of platooning, cut-in/cut-out of other vehicles, simultaneous emergency braking, and V2V communication technology were conducted.

==Innovation==

Scientific research on platooning has gained momentum over the past decade, especially from 2018 onward. Patent activities related to platooning have been increasing too. Major automotive and technology companies, such as Toyota, Volvo, Baidu, or Alphabet, are actively filing patents for various aspects of platooning, including V2V communication protocols, control systems and safety mechanisms. Between 2014 and 2023, the number of published patent families per year increased from less than 200 to over 1,000. However, patent families have declined over recent years, after having peaked at almost 1,400 in 2020.

<doc id="173366" wikidata="Q1160362" url="?curid=173366" title="Mechanization">
<text>Mechanization (or mechanisation) is the process of changing from working largely or exclusively by hand or with animals to doing that work with machinery. In an early engineering text, a machine is defined as follows:

In every fields, mechanization includes the use of hand tools. In modern usage, such as in engineering or economics, mechanization implies machinery more complex than hand tools and would not include simple devices such as an ungeared horse or donkey mill. Devices that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion, using means such as gears, pulleys or sheaves and belts, shafts, cams and cranks, usually are considered machines. After electrification, when most small machinery was no longer hand powered, mechanization was synonymous with motorized machines. Extension of mechanization of the production process is termed as automation and it is controlled by a closed loop system in which feedback is provided by the sensors. In an automated machine the work of different mechanisms is performed automatically.

==History==
===Ancient times===
Water wheels date to the Roman period and were used to grind grain and lift irrigation water. Water-powered bellows were in use on blast furnaces in China in 31 AD. By the 13th century, water wheels powered sawmills and trip hammers, to pull cloth and pound flax and later cotton rags into pulp for making paper. Trip hammers are shown crushing ore in &quot;De re Metallica&quot; (1555).

Clocks were some of the most complex early mechanical devices. Clock makers were important developers of machine tools including gear and screw cutting machines, and were also involved in the mathematical development of gear designs. Clocks were some of the earliest mass-produced items, beginning around 1830.

Water-powered bellows for blast furnaces, used in China in ancient times, were in use in Europe by the 15th century. &quot;De re Metallica&quot; contains drawings related to bellows for blast furnaces including a fabrication drawing.

Improved gear designs decreased wear and increased efficiency. Mathematical gear designs were developed in the mid 17th century. French mathematician and engineer Desargues designed and constructed the first mill with epicycloidal teeth ca. 1650. In the 18th century involute gears, another mathematical derived design, came into use. Involute gears are better for meshing gears of different sizes than epicycloidal. Gear cutting machines came into use in the 18th century.

===Industrial revolution===
The Newcomen steam engine was first used, to pump water from a mine, in 1712. John Smeaton introduced metal gears and axles to water wheels in the mid to last half of the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution started mainly with textile machinery, such as the spinning jenny (1764) and water frame (1768).

Demand for metal parts used in textile machinery led to the invention of many machine tools in the late 1700s until the mid-1800s. After the early decades of the 19th century, iron increasingly replaced wood in gearing and shafts in textile machinery. In the 1840s &quot;self acting&quot; machine tools were developed. Machinery was developed to make nails ca. 1810. The Fourdrinier paper machine for continuous production of paper was patented in 1801, displacing the centuries-old hand method of making individual sheets of paper.

One of the first mechanical devices used in agriculture was the seed drill invented by Jethro Tull around 1700. The seed drill allowed more uniform spacing of seed and planting depth than hand methods, increasing yields and saving valuable seed. In 1817, the first bicycle was invented and used in Germany. Mechanized agriculture greatly increased in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries with horse drawn reapers and horse powered threshing machines. By the late nineteenth century steam power was applied to threshing and steam tractors appeared. Internal combustion began being used for tractors in the early twentieth century. Threshing and harvesting was originally done with attachments for tractors, but in the 1930s independently powered combine harvesters were in use.

In the mid to late 19th century, hydraulic and pneumatic devices were able to power various mechanical actions, such as positioning tools or work pieces. Pile drivers and steam hammers are examples for heavy work. In food processing, pneumatic or hydraulic devices could start and stop filling of cans or bottles on a conveyor. Power steering for automobiles uses hydraulic mechanisms, as does practically all earth moving equipment and other construction equipment and many attachments to tractors. Pneumatic (usually compressed air) power is widely used to operate industrial valves.

===Twentieth century===
By the early 20th century machines developed the ability to perform more complex operations that had previously been done by skilled craftsmen. An example is the glass bottle making machine developed 1905. It replaced highly paid glass blowers and child labor helpers and led to the mass production of glass bottles.

After 1900 factories were electrified, and electric motors and controls were used to perform more complicated mechanical operations. This resulted in mechanized processes to manufacture almost all goods.

===Categories===


In manufacturing, mechanization replaced hand methods of making goods. Prime movers are devices that convert thermal, potential or kinetic energy into mechanical work. Prime movers include internal combustion engines, combustion turbines (jet engines), water wheels and turbines, windmills and wind turbines and steam engines and turbines. Powered transportation equipment such as locomotives, automobiles and trucks and airplanes, is a classification of machinery which includes sub classes by engine type, such as internal combustion, combustion turbine and steam. Inside factories, warehouses, lumber yards and other manufacturing and distribution operations, material handling equipment replaced manual carrying or hand trucks and carts.

In mining and excavation, power shovels replaced picks and shovels. Rock and ore crushing had been done for centuries by water-powered trip hammers, but trip hammers have been replaced by modern ore crushers and ball mills.

Bulk material handling systems and equipment are used for a variety of materials including coal, ores, grains, sand, gravel and wood products.

Construction equipment includes cranes, concrete mixers, concrete pumps, cherry pickers and an assortment of power tools.

===Powered machinery===
Powered machinery today usually means either by electric motor or internal combustion engine. Before the first decade of the 20th century powered usually meant by steam engine, water or wind.

Many of the early machines and machine tools were hand powered, but most changed over to water or steam power by the early 19th century.

Before electrification, mill and factory power was usually transmitted using a line shaft. Electrification allowed individual machines to each be powered by a separate motor in what is called &quot;unit drive&quot;. Unit drive allowed factories to be better arranged and allowed different machines to run at different speeds. Unit drive also allowed much higher speeds, which was especially important for machine tools.

A step beyond mechanization is automation. Early production machinery, such as the glass bottle blowing machine (ca. 1890s), required a lot of operator involvement. By the 1920s fully automatic machines, which required much less operator attention, were being used.

=== Military usage ===

The term is also used in the military to refer to the use of tracked armoured vehicles, particularly armoured personnel carriers, to move troops ( mechanized infantry) that would otherwise have marched or ridden trucks into combat. In military terminology, &quot;mechanized&quot; refers to ground units that can fight from vehicles, while &quot;motorized&quot; refers to units (motorized infantry) that are transported and go to battle in unarmoured vehicles such as trucks. Thus, a towed artillery unit is considered motorized while a self-propelled one is mechanized.

==Mechanical vs human labour==
When we compare the efficiency of a labourer, we see that he has an efficiency of about 1%–5.5% (depending on whether he uses arms, or a combination of arms and legs). Internal combustion engines mostly have an efficiency of about 20%, although large diesel engines, such as those used to power ships, may have efficiencies of nearly 50%. Industrial electric motors have efficiencies up to the low 90% range, before correcting for the conversion efficiency of fuel to electricity of about 35%.

When we compare the costs of using an internal combustion engine to a worker to perform work, we notice that an engine can perform more work at a comparative cost. 1 liter of fossil fuel burnt with an IC engine equals about 50 hands of workers operating for 24 hours or 275 arms and legs for 24 hours.

In addition, the combined work capability of a human is also much lower than that of a machine. An average human worker can provide work good for around 0,9 hp (2.3 MJ per hour) while a machine (depending on the type and size) can provide for far greater amounts of work. For example, it takes more than one and a half hour of hard labour to deliver only one kWh – which a small engine could deliver in less than one hour while burning less than one litre of petroleum fuel. This implies that a gang of 20 to 40 men will require a financial compensation for their work at least equal to the required expended food calories (which is at least 4 to 20 times higher). In most situations, the worker will also want compensation for the lost time, which is easily 96 times greater per day. Even if we assume the real wage cost for the human labour to be at US $1.00/day, an energy cost is generated of about $4.00/kWh. Despite this being a low wage for hard labour, even in some of the countries with the lowest wages, it represents an energy cost that is significantly more expensive than even exotic power sources such as solar photovoltaic panels (and thus even more expensive when compared to wind energy harvesters or luminescent solar concentrators).

== Levels of mechanization ==
For simplification, one can study mechanization as a series of steps. Many students refer to this series as indicating basic-to-advanced forms of mechanical society.

<doc id="173370" wikidata="Q1815425" url="?curid=173370" title="Whistler (radio)">
<text>A whistler is a very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic (radio) wave generated by lightning. Frequencies of terrestrial whistlers are 1 kHz to 30 kHz, with maximum frequencies usually at 3 kHz to 5 kHz. Although they are electromagnetic waves, they occur at audio frequencies, and can be converted to audio using a suitable receiver. They are produced by lightning strikes (mostly intracloud and return-path) where the impulse travels along the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field lines from one hemisphere to the other. They undergo dispersion of several kHz due to the slower velocity of the lower frequencies through the plasma environments of the ionosphere and magnetosphere. Thus they are perceived as a descending tone which can last for a few seconds. The study of whistlers categorizes them into Pure Note, Diffuse, 2-Hop, and Echo Train types.

Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft detected whistler-like activity in the vicinity of Jupiter known as &quot;Jovian Whistlers&quot;, supporting the visual observations of lightning made by Voyager 1.

Whistlers have been detected in the Earth&#x27;s magnetosheath, where they are often called “lion roars” due to their frequencies of tens to hundreds of Hz.

==Sources==
The pulse of electromagnetic energy of a lightning discharge producing whistlers contains a wide range of frequencies below the electron cyclotron frequency. Due to interactions with free electrons in the ionosphere, the waves becomes highly dispersive and like guided waves, follow the lines of geomagnetic field. These lines provide the field with sufficient focusing influence and prevents the scattering of field energy. Their paths reach into the outer space as far as 3 to 4 times the Earth&#x27;s radius in the plane of equator and bring energy from lightning discharge to the Earth at a point in the opposite hemisphere which is the magnetic conjugate of the position of radio emission for whistlers. From there, the whistler waves are reflected back to the hemisphere from which they started. The energy is almost perfectly reflected from earth surface 4 or 5 times with increase dispersion and diminishing amplitude. Along such long paths the speed of propagation of energy is between c/10 to c/100 (where c is the speed of light) and the exact value depends upon frequency.

Modulated heating of the lower ionosphere with an HF heater array can also be used to generate VLF waves that excite whistler mode propagation. By transmitting high power HF waves with a VLF modulated power envelope into the D-region ionosphere, the conductivity of the ionospheric plasma can be modulated. This conductivity modulation together with naturally occurring electrojet fields produces a virtual antenna which radiates at the modulation frequency. The HAARP HF heater array has been used to excite whistler-mode VLF signals detectable at the magnetic conjugate point, with up to 10 hops visible in the received VLF data. 

==History==
Whistlers were probably heard as early as 1886 on long telephone lines, but the clearest early description was by Heinrich Barkhausen in 1919. British scientist Llewelyn Robert Owen Storey had shown lightning generated whistlers in his 1953 PhD dissertation. Around the same time, Storey had posited the existence of whistlers meant plasma was present in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and that it moved radio waves in the same direction as Earth&#x27;s magnetic field lines. From this he deduced but was unable to conclusively prove the existence of the plasmasphere, a thin layer between the ionosphere and magnetosphere. In 1963 American scientist Don Carpenter and Soviet astronomer Konstantin Gringauz—independently of each other, and the latter using data from the &quot;Luna 2&quot; spacecraft—experimentally proved the plasmasphere and plasmapause&#x27;s existence, building on Storey&#x27;s thinking.

American electrical engineer Robert Helliwell is also known for his research into whistlers. Helliwell and one of his students, Jack Mallinckrodt, were investigating lightning noise at very low radio frequencies at Stanford University in 1950. Mallinckrodt heard some whistling sounds and brought them to Helliwell&#x27;s attention. As Helliwell recalled in an article in the October 1982 issue of the &quot;Stanford Engineer&quot;, he initially thought it was an artifact, but stood radio watch with Mallinckrodt until he heard the whistlers himself. Helliwell described these sounds as &quot;weird, strange and unbelievable as flying saucers&quot; in a 1954 article in the &quot;Palo Alto Times&quot;. Helliwell tried to understand the mechanism involved in the production of whistlers. He conducted experiments at the VLF outpost Siple Station in West Antarctica, which was active from 1971 to 1988. Since the wavelength of VLF radio signals is very large (a frequency of 10 kHz corresponds to a wavelength of ), Siple Station had an antenna that was long. The antenna was used to transmit VLF radio signals into Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, to be detected in Canada. It was possible to inject these signals into the magnetosphere, since the ionosphere is transparent to these low frequencies.

===Etymology===
Whistlers were named by British World War I radio operators. On the wide-band spectrogram, the observed characteristic of a whistler is that the tone rapidly descends over a few seconds—almost like a person whistling or an incoming grenade—hence the name &quot;whistlers.&quot;

==Nomenclature==
A type of electromagnetic signal propagating in the Earth–ionosphere waveguide, known as a radio atmospheric signal or sferic, may escape the ionosphere and propagate outward into the magnetosphere. The signal is prone to bounce-mode propagation, reflecting back and forth on opposite sides of the planet until totally attenuated. To clarify which part of this hop pattern the signal is in, it is specified by a number, indicating the portion of the bounce path it is currently on. On its first upward path, it is known as a codice_1. After passing the geomagnetic equator, it is referred to as a codice_2. The + or - sign indicates either upward or downward propagation, respectively. The numeral represents the half-bounce currently in progress. The reflected signal is redesignated codice_3, until passing the geomagnetic equator again; then it is called codice_4, and so on.

<text>Filter design is the process of designing a signal processing filter that satisfies a set of requirements, some of which may be conflicting. The purpose is to find a realization of the filter that meets each of the requirements to an acceptable degree.

The filter design process can be described as an optimization problem. Certain parts of the design process can be automated, but an experienced designer may be needed to get a good result.

The design of digital filters is a complex topic. Although filters are easily understood and calculated, the practical challenges of their design and implementation are significant and are the subject of advanced research.

== Typical design requirements ==

Typical requirements which may be considered in the design process are:
* Frequency response
* Phase shift or group delay
* impulse response
* Causal filter required?
* Stable filter required?
* Finite (in duration) impulse response required?
* Computational complexity
* Technology

=== The frequency function ===
The required frequency response is an important parameter. The steepness and complexity of the response curve determines the filter order and feasibility.

A first-order recursive filter will only have a single frequency-dependent component. This means that the slope of the frequency response is limited to 6 dB per octave. For many purposes, this is not sufficient. To achieve steeper slopes, higher-order filters are required.

In relation to the desired frequency function, there may also be an accompanying &quot;weighting&quot; function, which describes, for each frequency, how important it is that the resulting frequency function approximates the desired one.

Typical examples of frequency function are:
* A low-pass filter is used to cut unwanted high-frequency signals.
* A high-pass filter passes high frequencies fairly well; it is helpful as a filter to cut any unwanted low-frequency components.
* A band-pass filter passes a limited range of frequencies.
* A band-stop filter passes frequencies above and below a certain range. A very narrow band-stop filter is known as a notch filter.
* An all-pass filter passes all frequencies equally in gain. Only the phase shift is changed, which also affects the group delay.
* A differentiator has an amplitude response proportional to the frequency.
* A low-shelf filter passes all frequencies, but increases or reduces frequencies below the shelf frequency by specified amount.
* A high-shelf filter passes all frequencies, but increases or reduces frequencies above the shelf frequency by specified amount.
* A peak EQ filter makes a peak or a dip in the frequency response, commonly used in parametric equalizers.

=== Phase and group delay ===

* An all-pass filter passes through all frequencies unchanged, but changes the phase of the signal. Filters of this type can be used to equalize the group delay of recursive filters. This filter is also used in phaser effects.
* A Hilbert transformer is a specific all-pass filter that passes sinusoids with unchanged amplitude but shifts each sinusoid phase by ±90°.
* A fractional delay filter is an all-pass that has a specified and constant group or phase delay for all frequencies.

=== The impulse response ===

There is a direct correspondence between the filter&#x27;s frequency function and its impulse response: the former is the Fourier transform of the latter. That means that any requirement on the frequency function is a requirement on the impulse response, and vice versa.

However, in certain applications it may be the filter&#x27;s impulse response that is explicit and the design process then aims at producing as close an approximation as possible to the requested impulse response given all other requirements.

In some cases it may even be relevant to consider a frequency function and impulse response of the filter which are chosen independently from each other. For example, we may want both a specific frequency function of the filter &quot;and&quot; that the resulting filter have a small effective width in the signal domain as possible. The latter condition can be realized by considering a very narrow function as the wanted impulse response of the filter even though this function has no relation to the desired frequency function. The goal of the design process is then to realize a filter which tries to meet both these contradicting design goals as much as possible. An example is for high-resolution audio in which the frequency response (magnitude and phase) for steady state signals (sum of sinusoids) is the primary filter requirement, while an unconstrained impulse response may cause unexpected degradation due to time spreading of transient signals.

=== Causality ===

Any filter operating in real time (the filter response only depends on the current and past inputs) must be causal. If the design process yields a noncausal filter, the resulting filter can be made causal by introducing an appropriate time-shift (or delay). 

Filters that do not operate in real time (e.g. for image processing) can be non-causal. Noncausal filters may be designed to have zero delay.

=== Stability ===

A stable filter assures that every limited input signal produces a limited filter response. A filter which does not meet this requirement may in some situations prove useless or even harmful. Certain design approaches can guarantee stability, for example by using only feed-forward circuits such as an FIR filter. On the other hand, filters based on feedback circuits have other advantages and may therefore be preferred, even if this class of filters includes unstable filters. In this case, the filters must be carefully designed in order to avoid instability.

=== Locality ===

In certain applications we have to deal with signals which contain components which can be described as local phenomena, for example pulses or steps, which have certain time duration. A consequence of applying a filter to a signal is, in intuitive terms, that the duration of the local phenomena is extended by the width of the filter. This implies that it is sometimes important to keep the width of the filter&#x27;s impulse response function as short as possible.

According to the uncertainty relation of the Fourier transform, the product of the width of the filter&#x27;s impulse response function and the width of its frequency function must exceed a certain constant. This means that any requirement on the filter&#x27;s locality also implies a bound on its frequency function&#x27;s width. Consequently, it may not be possible to simultaneously meet requirements on the locality of the filter&#x27;s impulse response function as well as on its frequency function. This is a typical example of contradicting requirements.

=== Computational complexity ===

A general desire in any design is that the number of operations (additions and multiplications) needed to compute the filter response is as low as possible. In certain applications, this desire is a strict requirement, for example due to limited computational resources, limited power resources, or limited time. The last limitation is typical in real-time applications.

There are several ways in which a filter can have different computational complexity. For example, the order of a filter is more or less proportional to the number of operations. This means that by choosing a low order filter, the computation time can be reduced.

For discrete filters the computational complexity is more or less proportional to the number of filter coefficients. If the filter has many coefficients, for example in the case of multidimensional signals such as tomography data, it may be relevant to reduce the number of coefficients by removing those which are sufficiently close to zero. In multirate filters, the number of coefficients by taking advantage of its bandwidth limits, where the input signal is downsampled (e.g. to its critical frequency), and upsampled after filtering.

Another issue related to computational complexity is separability, that is, if and how a filter can be written as a convolution of two or more simpler filters. In particular, this issue is of importance for multidimensional filters, e.g., 2D filter which are used in image processing. In this case, a significant reduction in computational complexity can be obtained if the filter can be separated as the convolution of one 1D filter in the horizontal direction and one 1D filter in the vertical direction. A result of the filter design process may, e.g., be to approximate some desired filter as a separable filter or as a sum of separable filters.

=== Other considerations ===

It must also be decided how the filter is going to be implemented:
* Analog filter
* Analog sampled filter
* Digital filter
* Mechanical filter

==== Analog filters ====

The design of linear analog filters is for the most part covered in the linear filter section.

==== Digital filters ====

Digital filters are classified into one of two basic forms, according to how they respond to a unit impulse:

*Finite impulse response, or FIR, filters express each output sample as a weighted sum of the last &quot;N&quot; input samples, where &quot;N&quot; is the order of the filter. FIR filters are normally non-recursive, meaning they do not use feedback and as such are inherently stable. A moving average filter or CIC filter are examples of FIR filters that are normally recursive (that use feedback). If the FIR coefficients are symmetrical (often the case), then such a filter is linear phase, so it delays signals of all frequencies equally which is important in many applications. It is also straightforward to avoid overflow in an FIR filter. The main disadvantage is that they may require significantly more processing and memory resources than cleverly designed IIR variants. FIR filters are generally easier to design than IIR filters - the Parks-McClellan filter design algorithm (based on the Remez algorithm) is one suitable method for designing quite good filters semi-automatically. (See Methodology.)
*Infinite impulse response, or IIR, filters are the digital counterpart to analog filters. Such a filter contains internal state, and the output and the next internal state are determined by a linear combination of the previous inputs and outputs (in other words, they use feedback, which FIR filters normally do not). In theory, the impulse response of such a filter never dies out completely, hence the name IIR, though in practice, this is not true given the finite resolution of computer arithmetic. IIR filters normally require less computing resources than an FIR filter of similar performance. However, due to the feedback, high order IIR filters may have problems with instability, arithmetic overflow, and limit cycles, and require careful design to avoid such pitfalls. Additionally, since the phase shift is inherently a non-linear function of frequency, the time delay through such a filter is frequency-dependent, which can be a problem in many situations. 2nd order IIR filters are often called &#x27;biquads&#x27; and a common implementation of higher order filters is to cascade biquads. A useful reference for computing biquad coefficients is the RBJ Audio EQ Cookbook.

==== Sample rate ====

Unless the sample rate is fixed by some outside constraint, selecting a suitable sample rate is an important design decision. A high rate will require more in terms of computational resources, but less in terms of anti-aliasing filters. Interference and beating with other signals in the system may also be an issue.

==== Anti-aliasing ====

For any digital filter design, it is crucial to analyze and avoid aliasing effects. Often, this is done by adding analog anti-aliasing filters at the input and output, thus avoiding any frequency component above the Nyquist frequency. The complexity (i.e., steepness) of such filters depends on the required signal-to-noise ratio and the ratio between the sampling rate and the highest frequency of the signal.

== Theoretical basis ==

Parts of the design problem relate to the fact that certain requirements are described in the frequency domain while others are expressed in the time domain and that these may conflict. For example, it is not possible to obtain a filter which has both an arbitrary impulse response and arbitrary frequency function. Other effects which refer to relations between the time and frequency domain are

* The uncertainty principle between the time and frequency domains
* The variance extension theorem
* The asymptotic behaviour of one domain versus discontinuities in the other

=== The uncertainty principle ===

As stated by the Gabor limit, an uncertainty principle, the product of the width of the frequency function and the width of the impulse response cannot be smaller than a specific constant. This implies that if a specific frequency function is requested, corresponding to a specific frequency width, the minimum width of the filter in the signal domain is set. Vice versa, if the maximum width of the response is given, this determines the smallest possible width in the frequency. This is a typical example of contradictory requirements where the filter design process may try to find a useful compromise.

=== The variance extension theorem ===

Let formula_1 be the variance of the input signal and let formula_2 be the variance of the filter. The variance of the filter response, formula_3, is then given by

: formula_3 = formula_1 + formula_2

This means that formula_7 and implies that the localization of various features such as pulses or steps in the filter response is limited by the filter width in the signal domain. If a precise localization is requested, we need a filter of small width in the signal domain and, via the uncertainty principle, its width in the frequency domain cannot be arbitrary small.

=== Discontinuities versus asymptotic behaviour ===

Let &quot;f(t)&quot; be a function and let formula_8 be its Fourier transform. There is a theorem which states that if the first derivative of &quot;F&quot; which is discontinuous has order formula_9, then &quot;f&quot; has an asymptotic decay like formula_10.

A consequence of this theorem is that the frequency function of a filter should be as smooth as possible to allow its impulse response to have a fast decay, and thereby a short width.

== Methodology ==
One common method for designing FIR filters is the Parks-McClellan filter design algorithm, based on the Remez exchange algorithm. Here the user specifies a desired frequency response, a weighting function for errors from this response, and a filter order &quot;N&quot;. The algorithm then finds the set of &quot;N&quot; coefficients that minimize the maximum deviation from the ideal. Intuitively, this finds the filter that is as close as you can get to the desired response given that you can use only &quot;N&quot; coefficients. This method is particularly easy in practice and at least one text includes a program that takes the desired filter and &quot;N&quot; and returns the optimum coefficients. One possible drawback to filters designed this way is that they contain many small ripples in the passband(s), since such a filter minimizes the peak error.

Another method to finding a discrete FIR filter is &quot;filter optimization&quot; described in Knutsson et al., which minimizes the integral of the square of the error, instead of its maximum value. In its basic form this approach requires that an ideal frequency function of the filter formula_11 is specified together with a frequency weighting function formula_12 and set of coordinates formula_13 in the signal domain where the filter coefficients are located.

An error function formula_14 is defined as

:formula_15

where formula_16 is the discrete filter and formula_17 is the discrete-time Fourier transform defined on the specified set of coordinates. The norm used here is, formally, the usual norm on formula_18 spaces. This means that formula_14 measures the deviation between the requested frequency function of the filter, formula_20, and the actual frequency function of the realized filter, formula_21. However, the deviation is also subject to the weighting function formula_22 before the error function is computed.

Once the error function is established, the optimal filter is given by the coefficients formula_16 which minimize formula_14. This can be done by solving the corresponding least squares problem. In practice, the formula_18 norm has to be approximated by means of a suitable sum over discrete points in the frequency domain. In general, however, these points should be significantly more than the number of coefficients in the signal domain to obtain a useful approximation.

=== Simultaneous optimization in both domains ===

The previous method can be extended to include an additional error term related to a desired filter impulse response in the signal domain, with a corresponding weighting function. The ideal impulse response can be chosen independently of the ideal frequency function and is in practice used to limit the effective width and to remove ringing effects of the resulting filter in the signal domain. This is done by choosing a narrow ideal filter impulse response function, e.g., an impulse, and a weighting function which grows fast with the distance from the origin, e.g., the distance squared. The optimal filter can still be calculated by solving a simple least squares problem and the resulting filter is then a &quot;compromise&quot; which has a total optimal fit to the ideal functions in both domains. An important parameter is the relative strength of the two weighting functions which determines in which domain it is more important to have a good fit relative to the ideal function.

<doc id="173377" wikidata="Q1496339" url="?curid=173377" title="Geats">
<text>The Geats ( ; ; ; ), sometimes called &quot;Goths&quot;, were a large North Germanic tribe who inhabited (&quot;land of the Geats&quot;) in modern southern Sweden from antiquity until the Late Middle Ages. They are one of the progenitor groups of modern Swedes, along with the tribes of Swedes and Gutes. The name of the Geats also lives on in the Swedish provinces of and , the western and eastern lands of the Geats, and in many other toponyms.

The Swedish dialects spoken in the areas that used to be inhabited by Geats form a distinct group, &quot;Götamål&quot;.

==Etymology==

The etymology of the name &quot;Geat&quot; (Old English &quot;&quot;, from a Proto-Germanic *&quot;Gautaz&quot;, plural *&quot;Gautōz&quot;) is similar to that of &quot;Goths&quot; and &quot;Gutes&quot; (*&quot;Gutô&quot;, plural *&quot;Gutaniz&quot;). The names derive from ablaut grades of the Proto-Germanic word *&quot;geutaną&quot;, meaning &quot;to pour&quot;. They have the literal meaning &quot;they who pour their seed&quot;. (For more information see Goths § Etymology.) The names could also allude to watercourses in the land where they were living, but this is not generally accepted to be the case, partly because that would mean that the names&#x27; similarity would be coincidental.

A more specific theory about the word &quot;Gautigoths&quot; is that it means the Goths who live near the river &quot;Gaut&quot;, today&#x27;s Göta älv (). It might also have been a conflation of the word &quot;Gauti&quot; with a gloss of &quot;Goths&quot;. In the 17th century the name &quot;Göta älv&quot;, &#x27;River of the Geats&#x27;, replaced the earlier names &quot;Götälven&quot; and &quot;Gautelfr&quot;. The etymology of the word &quot;Gaut&quot; (as mentioned above) derives from the Proto-Germanic word *&quot;geutan&quot;, and the extended meaning of &quot;to pour&quot; is &quot;flow, stream, waterfall&quot;, which could refer to Trollhättan Falls or to the river itself.

The short form of &quot;Gautigoths&quot; was the Old Norse &quot;&quot;, which originally referred to just the inhabitants of Västergötland, or the western parts of today&#x27;s Götaland, a meaning which is retained in some Icelandic sagas.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest known surviving mention of the Geats appears in Ptolemy (2nd century AD), who refers to them as &quot;Goutai&quot;. In the 6th century, Jordanes writes of the &quot;Gautigoths&quot; and &quot;Ostrogoths&quot; (the Ostrogoths of Scandza); and Procopius refers to &quot;Gautoi&quot;. The Norse Sagas know them as &quot;Gautar&quot;; &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Widsith&quot; as &quot;Gēatas&quot;. &quot;Beowulf&quot; and the Norse sagas name several Geatish kings, but only Hygelac finds confirmation in &quot;Liber Monstrorum&quot; where he is referred to as &quot;Rex Getarum&quot; and in a copy of &quot;Historiae Francorum&quot; where he is called &quot;Rege Gotorum&quot;. These sources concern a raid into Frisia, ca 516, which is also described in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. C. 551, some decades after Hygelac&#x27;s raid, Jordanes described the Geats as a nation which was &quot;bold, and quick to engage in war&quot;.

The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain included many North Germanic people who were losers in the brutal tribal warfare of Scandinavia. The place-name &quot;-gate&quot; marks the site of Geatish settlement, often alongside strategically important Roman roads and nearby Visigothic and/or Jutish settlements. Defeated Jutes like Hengest and his brother Horsa fled to Kent, while Geats defeated by encroaching Swedes moved to Yorkshire where they founded Gillingshire by the Tees, originally the settlement of the &quot;Geatlings&quot;. It has also been suggested that East Anglia was settled by Geats at this time, or by Wulfings who also came from Götaland, bringing the traditions of &quot;Beowulf&quot; with them.

Any peace that eventually settled in southern Scandinavia was most likely due to exhaustion, and a Danish archaeologist has summarized that in the mid-6th century, and after, Scandinavia &quot;went down to hell&quot;. Scandinavian wares appear to have stopped arriving in England, c. 550, suggesting that contact was broken.

===Political centralization in Scandinavia===
According to Procopius there were 13 &quot;very numerous nations&quot; on the Scandinavian peninsula in the 6th century, which is supported by recent archaeological analyses. Several scholars consider this to be a reasonable number of independent kingdoms at the time, with each consisting of one or more tribes, as reported by Jordanes. However, by 1350, these 13 kingdoms had been reduced in number to only two, Norway and Sweden. The Geats were one of the largest tribes.

Procopius and Jordanes both mention the Geats, but after them, foreign sources about Scandinavia are scarce until the 9th century, when Anglo-Saxon and Frankish sources do shed some light on the area. In these, the Geats are absent, which has led some scholars to conclude that they were no longer an independent nation and had been subsumed by the Swedes. Norwegian and Icelandic scaldic sources from the 10th century however indicate that they were still politically independent, sometimes opposing Norwegian kings. It has been suggested that their absence from older sources is instead due to their being an inland people.

The nature and the processes of how Geats and Swedes came to form one kingdom have been much debated among Swedish scholars. The scarcity and sometimes debated veracity of sources has left much room open for interpretation. The oldest medieval Swedish sources present the Swedish kingdom as retaining differences between provinces, in laws as well as in weights and measures. Some scholars have argued that the Geats were subjugated by the Swedes, and have suggested various dates for such an event, from the 6th to the 9th centuries. Others have wanted to see a more gradual merging, and that the Geats were slowly subsumed into the more powerful kingdom of Sweden, and in many respects they maintained their own cultural identity during the Middle Ages. Still others have put emphasis on how it was individual rulers, not ethnic groups, who were driving the process towards a unified kingdom, and that the process was very complicated.

Papal letters from the 1080s style the recipients as &quot;king of the Swedes&quot; or &quot;king of the West Geats&quot;. In another papal letter from the 1160s, the title &quot;rex Sweorum et Gothorum&quot; is first attested. The Swedish kings began the custom of styling themselves as also the kings of the Geats in the 1270s.

===Dynastic struggles===
In the 11th century, the Swedish House of Munsö became extinct with the death of Emund the Old. Stenkil, a Geat, was elected king of the Swedes, and the Geats would be influential in the shaping of Sweden as a Christian kingdom. However, this election also ushered in a long period of civil unrest between Christians and pagans and between Geats and Swedes. The Geats tended to be more Christian, and the Swedes more pagan, which was why the Christian Swedish king Inge the Elder fled to Västergötland when deposed in favour of Blot-Sweyn, a king more favourable towards Norse paganism, in the 1080s. Inge would retake the throne and rule until his death c. 1100.
In his &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (book 13), the Danish 12th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus noted that the Geats had no say in the election of the king, only the Swedes. When the West Geatish law or Westrogothic law was put to paper, it reminded the Geats that they had to accept the election of the Swedes: &quot;Sveær egho konong at taka ok sva vrækæ&quot; meaning &quot;&quot;It is the Swedes who have the right of choosing [&quot;taking&quot;] and also deposing the king&quot;&quot; and then he rode Eriksgatan &quot;mæþ gislum ofvan&quot; – &quot;with hostages from above [the realm]&quot; through Södermanland, the Geatish provinces and then through Närke and Västmanland to be judged to be the lawful king by the lawspeakers of their respective things. One of these Swedish kings was Ragnvald Knaphövde, who in 1125 was riding with his retinue in order to be accepted as king by the different provinces. According to material appended to the oldest manuscript of the Westrogothic law, he decided not to demand hostages as he despised the Geats, and was slain near Falköping.

In a new general law of Sweden that was issued by Magnus Eriksson in the 1350s, it was stated that twelve men from each province, chosen by their things, should be present at the Stone of Mora when a new king was elected.

The distinction between Swedes and Geats lasted during the Middle Ages, but the Geats became increasingly important for Swedish national claims of greatness due to the Geats&#x27; old connection with the Goths. They argued that since the Goths and the Geats were the same nation, and the Geats were part of the kingdom of Sweden, this meant that the Swedes had defeated the Roman empire. The earliest attestation of this claim comes from the Council of Basel, 1434, during which the Swedish delegation argued with the Spanish about who among them were the true Goths. The Spaniards argued that it was better to be descended from the heroic Visigoths than from stay-at-homers. This cultural movement, which was not restricted to Sweden went by the name &quot;Gothicismus&quot; or in Swedish &quot;Göticism&quot;, i.e. &quot;Geaticism&quot;.

After the 15th century and the Kalmar Union, the Swedes and the Geats appear to have begun to perceive themselves as one nation, which is reflected in the evolution of &quot;svensk&quot; into a common ethnonym. It was originally an adjective referring to those belonging to the Swedish tribe, who are called &quot;svear&quot; in Swedish. As early as the 9th century, &quot;svear&quot; had been vague, both referring to the Swedish tribe and being a collective term including the Geats, and this is the case in Adam of Bremen&#x27;s work where the Geats (&quot;Goths&quot;) appear both as a proper nation and as part of the &quot;Sueones&quot;. The merging/assimilation of the two nations took a long time, however. In the early-20th century, &quot;Nordisk familjebok&quot; noted that &quot;svensk&quot; had almost replaced &quot;svear&quot; as a name for the Swedish people.

At the same time, the Swedish ancestors were often referred to as Geats, especially when their heroism or connection to the Goths was to be stressed. This practice disappeared during the 19th century, when the vikings gradually took over the role as the heroic ancestors.

==Society==
The Geats were traditionally divided into several petty kingdoms, or districts, which had their own things (popular assemblies) and laws. The largest one of these districts was Västergötland (West Geatland), and it was in Västergötland that the Thing of all Geats was held every year, in the vicinity of Skara. Despite the name, the thing was only for the inhabitants of Västergötland and Dalsland. The equivalent in Östergötland was Lionga thing.

Unlike the Swedes, who used the division hundare, the Geats used &quot;hærrad&quot; (modern Swedish &quot;härad&quot;), like the Norwegians and the Danes. Surprisingly, it would be the Geatish name that became the common term in the Swedish kingdom. This is possibly related to the fact that several of the medieval Swedish kings were of Geatish extraction and often resided primarily in Götaland. In Västergötland and Dalsland, there were also a higher-level division where one or more hærrad made up a &quot;bo&quot; linked to a kongsgård.

== Modern legacy ==
Today, the merger of the two nations is complete, as there is no longer any tangible identification in Götaland with a Geatish identity, apart from the common tendency of residents of the provinces of Västergötland and Östergötland to refer to themselves as &quot;västgötar&quot; (West Geats) and &quot;östgötar&quot; (East Geats), similarly to how residents of other provinces refer to themselves. The dialects spoken in those provinces and some surrounding areas are also collectively called götamål. Although the city &quot;Göteborg&quot; (Gothenburg) has formerly been considered to have been named after the river Göta älv, it may instead have been named after the Geats (&#x27;fortress of the Geats&#x27;) when it was founded in 1621.

Until 1973 the official title of the Swedish king was &quot;King of Sweden&quot; (earlier: of the Swedes), the Geats/Goths and the Wends (with the formula &quot;Sveriges, Götes och Vendes konung&quot;, in Latin &quot;N.N. Dei Gratia, Suecorum, Gothorum et Vandalorum Rex&quot;). The title &quot;King of the Wends&quot; was copied from the Danish title, while the Danish kings called themselves &quot;Kings of the Gotlanders&quot; (which, like &quot;Geats&quot;, was translated into &quot;Goths&quot; in Latin). &quot;Wends&quot; is a term normally used to describe the Slavic peoples who inhabited large areas of modern east Germany and Pomerania. See further in the Wikipedia articles King of the Goths and King of the Wends.

The titles, however, changed in 1973 when the new king Carl XVI Gustaf decided that his royal title should simply be &quot;King of Sweden&quot;. The disappearance of the old title was his decision alone.

==Goths==

&quot;Geatas&quot; was originally Proto-Germanic *&quot;Gautoz&quot; and &quot;Goths&quot; and &quot;Gutar&quot; (&quot;Gotlanders&quot;) were *&quot;Gutaniz&quot;. *&quot;Gautoz&quot; and *&quot;Gutaniz&quot; are two ablaut grades of a Proto-Germanic word *&quot;geutan&quot; with the meaning &quot;to pour&quot; (modern Swedish &quot;gjuta&quot;, modern German &quot;giessen&quot;). The word comes from an Indo-European root meaning &quot;to pour, offer sacrifice.&quot; There were consequently two derivations from the same Proto-Germanic ethnonym.

It is a long-standing controversy whether the Goths were Geats. Both Old Icelandic and Old English literary sources clearly separate the Geats (Isl. &quot;Gautar&quot;, OEng &quot;Geatas&quot;) from the Goths/Gutar (Isl. &quot;Gotar&quot;, OEng. &quot;Gotenas&quot;); but the Gothic historian Jordanes wrote that the Goths came originally to Dacia from the island of Scandza. Moreover, he described that on this island there were three tribes called the &quot;Gautigoths&quot; (cf. &quot;Geat/Gaut&quot;), the &quot;Ostrogoths&quot; (cf. the Swedish province of &quot;Östergötland&quot;) and &quot;Vagoths&quot; (Gutar?) ‒ this implies that the Geats were Goths rather than vice versa. The word &quot;Goth&quot; is also a term used by the Romans to describe related, culturally linked tribes like the Tervingi and the Greuthungs, so it may be correct to label Geats as Goths.

Scandinavian burial customs, such as the stone circles (domarringar), which are most common in Götaland and Gotland, and stelae (bautastenar) appeared in what is now northern Poland in the 1st century AD, suggesting an influx of Scandinavians during the formation of the Gothic Wielbark culture. Moreover, in Östergötland, in Sweden, there is a sudden disappearance of villages during this period. Contemporary accounts beginning in the fourth century further associated these groups with the earlier &quot;Getae&quot; of Dacia, but this is now disputed.

==Fringe theories==
===Götaland theory===
The Götaland theory (Swedish &quot;Västgötaskolan&quot;) is a disparate group of theories, which have attempted to prove that some events and even places that are traditionally placed around Mälaren, especially ones that are associated with the formation of medieval Sweden, instead should be located to Västergötland. The methods ranged from relatively scholarly efforts to dowsing. This &quot;school&quot; was brought to prominence in the 1980s following a TV series by Dag Stålsjö. While some serious scholars have attempted to place more emphasis on the Geats in the early history of Sweden than was traditional, Västgötaskolan has never reached any acceptance.

=== Identity of the Gēatas===
The generally accepted identification of Old English &quot;Gēatas&quot; as the same ethnonym as Swedish &quot;götar&quot; and Old Norse &quot;gautar&quot; is based on the observation that the &quot;ö&quot; monophthong of modern Swedish and the &quot;au&quot; diphthong of Old Norse correspond to the &quot;ēa&quot; diphthong of Old English.

Thus, &quot;Gēatas&quot; is the Old English form of Old Norse &quot;Gautar&quot; and modern Swedish &quot;Götar&quot;. This correspondence seems to tip the balance for most scholars. It is also based on the fact that in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the &quot;Gēatas&quot; live east of the &quot;Dani&quot; (across the sea) and in close contact with the &quot;Sweon&quot;, which fits the historical position of the Geats between the Danes and the Swedes. Moreover, the story of Beowulf, who leaves &quot;Geatland&quot; and arrives at the Danish court after a naval voyage, where he kills a beast, finds a parallel in Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga. In this saga, Bödvar Bjarki leaves &quot;Gautland&quot; and arrives at the Danish court after a naval voyage and kills a beast that has been terrorizing the Danes for two years (see also Origins for Beowulf and Hrólf Kraki).

====Jutish hypothesis====
There is a hypothesis that the Jutes also were Geats, and which was proposed by Pontus Fahlbeck in 1884. According to this hypothesis the Geats would have not only resided in southern Sweden but also in Jutland, where Beowulf would have lived.

The Geats and the Jutes are mentioned in &quot;Beowulf&quot; as different tribes, and whereas the Geats are called &quot;gēatas&quot;, the Jutes are called &quot;ēotena&quot; (genitive) or &quot;ēotenum&quot; (dative). Moreover, the Old English poem &quot;Widsith&quot; also mentions both Geats and Jutes, and it calls the latter &quot;ȳtum&quot;. However, Fahlbeck proposed in 1884 that the Gēatas of &quot;Beowulf&quot; referred to Jutes and he proposed that the Jutes originally also were Geats like those of southern Sweden. This theory was based on an Old English translation of Venerable Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; attributed to Alfred the Great where the Jutes (&quot;iutarum&quot;, &quot;iutis&quot;) once are rendered as &quot;gēata&quot; (genitive) and twice as &quot;gēatum&quot; (dative) (see e.g. the &quot;OED&quot; which identifies the Geats through &quot;Eotas&quot;, &quot;Iótas&quot;, &quot;Iútan&quot; and &quot;Geátas&quot;). Fahlbeck did not, however, propose an etymology for how the two ethnonyms could be related.

Fahlbeck&#x27;s theory was refuted by Schück who in 1907 noted that another Old English source, the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, called the Jutes &quot;īutna&quot;, &quot;īotum&quot; or &quot;īutum&quot;. Moreover, Schück pointed out that when Alfred the Great&#x27;s translation mentions the Jutes for the second time (book IV, ch. 14(16)) it calls them &quot;ēota&quot; and in one manuscript &quot;ȳtena&quot;. Björkman proposed in 1908 that Alfred the Great&#x27;s translation of Jutes as Geats was based on a confusion between the West Saxon form &quot;Geotas&quot; (&quot;Jutes&quot;) and &quot;Gēatas&quot; (&quot;Geats&quot;).

As for the origins of the ethnonym &quot;Jute&quot;, it may be a secondary formation of the toponym Jutland, where &quot;jut&quot; is derived from a Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;eud&quot; meaning &quot;water&quot;.

====Gutnish hypothesis====
Since the 19th century, there has also been a suggestion that Beowulf&#x27;s people were Gutes (from the island of Gotland in Sweden). According to the poem, the &quot;weather-geats&quot; or &quot;sea-geats&quot;, as they are called are supposed to have lived east of the Danes/Dacians and be separated from the Swedes by wide waters. Some researchers have found it a little far-fetched that &quot;wide waters&quot; relates to Vänern in Västergötland or Mälaren. The &quot;weather&quot; in &quot;weather-geats&quot;, and &quot;sea-geats&quot; marks a people living at a windy, stormy coast by the sea. The Geats of Västergötland were historically an inland people, making an epithet such as &quot;weather-&quot; or &quot;sea-&quot; a little strange. Moreover, when Beowulf dies he is buried in a mound at a place called &quot;Hrones-naesse&quot;, meaning &quot;the cape of whales&quot;. Whales have for obvious reasons never lived in Vänern, where, according to Birger Nerman, Beowulf is buried. However, an expanse of water separates the island of Gotland from the Swedes. The island lies east of Denmark/Dacia and whales were once common in the Baltic Sea where Gotland is situated. The name of the Gutes in Swedish, &quot;Gutar&quot;, is an ablaut-grade of the same name as that of the Geats in Beowulf. These facts made the archaeologist Gad Rausing come to the conclusion that the &quot;weather-Geats&quot; may have been Gutes. This was supported by another Swedish archaeologist Bo Gräslund. According to Rausing, Beowulf may be buried in a place called &quot;Rone&quot; on Gotland, a name corresponding to the &quot;Hrones&quot; in &quot;Hrones-naesse&quot;. Not far from there lies a place called &quot;Arnkull&quot; corresponding to the &quot;Earnar-naesse&quot; in Beowulf, which according to the poem was situated closely to Hrones-naesse.

This theory does not exclude the ancient population of Västergötland and Östergötland from being Geats, but rather holds that the Anglo-Saxon name &quot;Geat&quot; could refer to West-geats (Västergötland), East-geats (Östergötland) as well as weather-geats (Gotland), in accordance with Jordanes account of the Scandinanian tribes Gautigoth, Ostrogoth and Vagoth.

<text>Anselm of Laon (; 1117), properly Ansel (&quot;&quot;), was a French theologian and founder of a school of scholars who helped to pioneer biblical hermeneutics.

==Biography==
Born of very humble parents at Laon before the middle of the 11th century, he is said to have studied under Saint Anselm at Bec, though this is almost certainly incorrect. Other potential teachers of Anselm have been identified, including Bruno of Cologne and Manegold of Lautenbach. By around 1080, he had moved back to his place of birth and was teaching at the cathedral school of Laon, with his brother Ralph. Around 1109, he became dean and chancellor of the cathedral, and in 1115 he was one of Laon&#x27;s two archdeacons. His school for theology and exegesis rapidly became the most well known in Europe. Famously, in 1113, he expelled Peter Abelard from his school.

The &quot;Liber Pancrisi&quot; () names him, with his brother Ralph, Ivo of Chartres, and William of Champeaux, as one of the four modern masters.

== Works ==
Anselm&#x27;s greatest work, an interlinear and marginal gloss on the &#x27;Scriptures&#x27;, the Glossa ordinaria, now attributed to him and his followers, was one of the great intellectual achievements of the Middle Ages. It has been frequently reprinted. The significance of the gloss, which was most likely assembled after Anselm&#x27;s death by his students, such as Gilbert de la Porrée, and based on Anselm&#x27;s teaching, is that it marked a new way of learning — it represented the birth of efforts to present discrete patristic and earlier medieval interpretations of individual verses of Scripture in a readily accessible, easily referenced way. This theme was subsequently adopted and extended by the likes of Hugh of St. Victor, Peter Lombard and later Thomas Aquinas, who gave us &#x27;handbooks&#x27; for what we would now call theology.

Other commentaries apparently by Anselm have been ascribed to various writers, principally to Anselm of Canterbury.

The works are collected in Migne. Some of his &quot;Sententiae&quot; were edited at Milan by G. Lefevre in 1894. The commentary on the Psalms attributed to Haymo of Halberstadt by Migne has also been identified as possibly being the work of Anselm.

<text>Hazarajat (), also known as Hazaristan () is a mostly mountainous region in the central highlands of Afghanistan, among the Kuh-e Baba mountains in the western extremities of the Hindu Kush. It is the homeland of the Hazara people who make up the majority of its population. Hazarajat denotes an ethnic and religious zone.

Hazarajat is primarily made up of the provinces of Bamyan, Daykundi and large parts of Ghor, Ghazni, Uruzgan, Parwan, Maidan Wardak, and more. The most populous towns in Hazarajat are Bamyan, Yakawlang (Bamyan), Nili (Daykundi), Lal wa Sarjangal (Ghor), Sang-e-Masha (Ghazni), Gizab (Daykundi) and Behsud (Maidan Wardak). The Kabul, Arghandab, Helmand, Farah, Hari, Murghab, Balkh, and Kunduz rivers originate from Hazarajat.

==Etymology and usage==
The Hazara people and surrounding peoples use the names &quot;Hazarajat&quot; or &quot;Hazaristan&quot; to identify the historic Hazara lands. &quot;Hazarajat&quot; is a compound of &quot;Hazara&quot; and the Persian suffix &quot;jat&quot;, which is used to make words associated with land in the south, central and west Asia and &quot;Hazaristan&quot; is a compound of &quot;Hazara&quot; and the Persian suffix ـستان &quot;-stan&quot; means &quot;land&quot; or &quot;place of&quot;.

== Geography ==

===Topography===
The Hazarajat lies in the central Afghan highlands, among the Koh-e Baba mountains and the western extremities of the Hindu Kush. Its boundaries have historically been inexact and shifting. Its physical limitations, however, are roughly marked by the Bā-miān Basin to the north, the headwaters of the Helmand River to the south, Firuzkuh to the west, and the Unai Pass to the east. The regional terrain is mountainous and extends to the Safid Kuh and the Siāh Kuh mountains, where the highest peaks reach between and . Both sides of the Kuh-e Bābā range contain a succession of valleys. The north face of the range descends steeply, merging into low foothills and small semi-arid plains, while the south face stretches towards the Helmand Valley and the mountainous district of Behsud.

Northwestern Hazarajat encompasses the district of Ghor, long known for its mountain fortresses. The 10th-century geographer Estakhri wrote that mountainous Ghor was &quot;the only region surrounded by Islamic territories and yet inhabited by infidels&quot;. The long resistance of the inhabitants of Ghor to the adoption of Islam indicates the region&#x27;s inaccessibility; according to some travelers, the entire region is comparable to a fortress raised in the upper Central Asian highlands: from every approach, tall and steep mountains have to be traversed to reach the area. The language of the inhabitants of Ghor differed so much from that of the people of the plains that communication between the two required interpreters.

The northeastern part of the Hazarajat is the site of ancient Bamyan, a center of Buddhism and a key caravanserai on the Silk Road. The town stands at a height of , surrounded by the Hindu Kush to the north and Koh-i Baba to the south. The Hazarajat was considered part of the larger geographic region of Khurasan (Kushan), the porous boundaries of which encompassed the vast region between the Caspian Sea and the Oxus River, thus including much of present-day Northern Iran and Afghanistan.

===Climate===
Hazarajat is mountainous, and a series of mountain passes extend along its eastern edge. One of them, the Salang Pass, is blocked by snow six months out of the year. Another, the Shibar Pass, at a lower elevation, is blocked by snow only two months out of the year. Bamyan is the colder part of the region, with severe winters.

Hazarajat is the source of the rivers that run through Kabul, Arghandab, Helmand, Hari, Murghab, Balkh, and Kunduz; during the spring and summer months it has some of the greenest pastures in Afghanistan. Natural lakes, green valleys and caves are found in Bamyan.

== History ==
The area was ruled successively by the Achaemenids, Seleucids, Mauryas, Kushans, and Hephthalites before the Saffarids Islamized it and made it part of their empire. It was taken over by the Samanids, followed by the Ghaznavids and Ghurids before falling to the Delhi Sultanate. In the 13th century, it was invaded by Genghis Khan and his Mongol army. In the following decades, the Qarlughids emerged to create a local dynasty that offered a few decades of self-rule. Later, the area became part of the Timurid dynasty, the Mughal Empire and the Durrani Empire.
The subjugation of the Hazarajat, particularly the mountain fortresses of Bamyan, proved difficult for the invaders at their conquest of the region. &quot;adopted the language of the vanquished&quot;.

===19th century===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, a sense of &quot;Afghan-ness&quot; developed among the Hazaras and the Pashtuns began to coalesce. It has been suggested that in the 19th century there was an emerging awareness of ethnic and religious differences among the population of Kabul. This brought about divisions along &quot;confessional lines&quot; that became reflected in new &quot;spatial boundaries&quot;. During the reign of Dost Mohammad Khan, Mir Yazdanbakhsh, a diligent chief of the Behsud Hazaras, consolidated many of the districts they controlled. Mir Yazdanbakhsh collected revenues and safeguarded caravans traveling on the Hajigak route through Bamyan to Kabul through Sheikh Ali and Behsud areas. The consolidation of the Hazarajat thus increasingly made the region and its inhabitants a threat to the Durrani state.
Until the late 19th century, the Hazarajat remained somewhat independent and only the authority of local chieftains was obeyed. Joseph Pierre Ferrier, a French author who supposedly traveled through the region in the mid-19th century, described the inhabitants settled in the mountains near the rivers Balkh and Kholm &quot;The Hazara population is very less but ungovernable, and has no occupation but pillage; they will pillage and pillage only, and plunder from camp to camp&quot;. Subsequent British travelers doubted whether Ferrier had ever actually left Herat to venture into Afghanistan&#x27;s central mountains and have suggested that his accounts of the region were based on hearsay, especially since very few people dared then to enter the Hazarajat; even Pashtun nomads (Kuchi people) would not take their flocks to graze there, and few caravans would pass through.

Afghanistan&#x27;s Kuchi people, who are unsettled nomads who migrate between the Amu Darya and the Indus River, temporarily stayed in Hazarajat during some seasons, where they overran Hazara farmlands and pastures. Increasingly during summers, these nomads would camp in large numbers in the Hazarajat highlands.

The travels of Captains P. J. Maitland and M. G. Talbot from Herat, through Obeh and Bamyan, to Balkh, during the autumn and winter of 1885, explored the Hazarajat proper. Maitland and Talbot found the entire length of the road between Herat and Bamyan difficult to traverse. As a result of the expedition, parts of the Hazarajat were &quot;surveyed on one-eighth inch scale&quot; and thus made to fit into the mapped order of modern nation-states. More thought and attention was put into demarcating the definite borders of modern nations than ever before, which entailed great difficulties in frontier regions such as the Hazarajat.

During the Second Anglo-Afghan War, Colonel T. H. Holdich of the Indian Survey Department referred to the Hazarajat as &quot;great unknown highlands&quot;. And for the next few years, neither the Survey nor the Indian Intelligence Department succeeded in obtaining any trustworthy information on the routes between Herat and Kabul through the Hazarajat.

Various members of the Afghan Boundary Commission were able to gather the information that brought the geography of remote regions such as the Hazarajat further under state surveillance. In November 1884, the Commission crossed over the Koh-e Baba mountains by the Chashma Sabz Pass. General Peter Lumsden and Major C. E. Yate, who surveyed the tracts between Herat and the Oxus, visited the Qala-e Naw Hazaras in the Paropamisus mountain range, to the east of the Jamshidis of Kushk. Noting surviving evidence of terraced cultivation in times past, both described the northern Hazaras as semi-nomadic with large flocks of sheep and black cattle. They possessed an &quot;inexhaustible supply of grass, the hills around being covered knee-deep with a luxuriant crop of pure rye&quot;. Yate noted clusters of kebetkas, or the summer dwellings of the Qala-e Naw Hazaras on the hillsides and described &quot;flocks and herds grazing in all directions&quot;.

The geographical reach of the authority of the Afghan state was extended into the Hazarajat during the reign of Abdur Rahman Khan. Caught between the strategic interests of foreign powers and disappointed by the demarcation of the Durand Line in southern Afghanistan, which cut into Pashtun territory, he set out to bring the northern peripheries of the country more firmly under his control. This policy had disastrous consequences for the Hazarajat, whose inhabitants were singled out by Abdur Rahman Khan&#x27;s regime as particularly troublesome: &quot;The Hazara people had been for centuries past the terror of the rulers of Kabul&quot;.

===20th and 21st century===
In the 1920s the ancient Shibar Pass road which leads through Bamyan and east to the Panjshir Valley was paved for lorries, and it remained the busiest road across the Hindu Kush until the building of the Salang tunnel in 1964 and the opening of a winter route. The Hazarajat became increasingly depopulated as Hazaras migrated to cities and to surrounding countries, where they became laborers and undertook the hardest and lowest-paid work.

In 1979, there were reportedly one and a half million Hazaras in the Hazarajat and Kabul, although a reliable census has never been taken in Afghanistan. As the Afghan state weakened, uprisings broke out in the Hazarajat, freeing the region from state rule by the summer of 1979 for the first time since the death of Abdur Rahman Khan some Hazara resistance groups were formed in Iran, including Nasr and Sipah-i Pasdaran, with some being &quot;committed to the idea of a separate Hazara national identity&quot;. During the war with the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, most of the Hazarajat was unoccupied and free of Soviet or state presence. The region became ruled once again by local leaders, or mirs, and a new stratum of young radical Shiʿi commanders. Economic conditions are reported to have improved in the Hazarajat during the war, when Pashtun &quot;Kuchis&quot; stopped grazing their flocks in Hazara pastures and fields.
The group ruling Hazarajat was the Revolutionary Council of Islamic Unity of Afghanistan or &quot;Shura-e Ettefaq&quot;, led by Sayyid Ali Beheshti. The region&#x27;s geographic nature and un-strategic location meant that the government and Soviets ignored it as they fought rebels elsewhere. This effectively allowed the Shura-i Ettefaq administration to rule over the region and give autonomy to the Hazaras. Their politically opposing groups were mostly educated, secular and left-wing. Between 1982 and 1984, an internal civil war caused the Shura to be overthrown by the &quot;Sazman-i Nasr&quot; and &quot;Sepah-i Pasdaran&quot; groups. However inter-factional rivalry continued thereafter. Most of the Hazara groups united in 1987 and 1989 and formed the Hizb-e-Wahdat.

During the rule of the Taliban, once again, ethnic and sectarian violence struck Hazarajat. In 1997, a revolt broke out among Hazara people in Mazar-e Sharif when they refused to be disarmed by the Taliban; 600 Taliban were killed in subsequent fighting. In retaliation, the genocidal policies of Amir Abdur Rahman Khan&#x27;s era were adopted by the Taliban. In 1998, six thousand Hazaras were killed in the north; the intention was ethnic cleansing of Hazara. At that stage, Hazarajat does not exist as an official region; the area comprises the administrative provinces of Bamyan, Ghor, Maidan Wardak, Ghazni, Oruzgan, Juzjan, and Samangan. In March 2001, two giant Buddhist statues, Buddhas of Bamiyan, were also destroyed even though there was a lot of condemnation.

== Demographics ==

===Ethnic groups===
The Hazaras constitute the majority of the Hazarajat population.

===Language===

Dari (Persian) is the official language of Hazarajat. People in different parts of the region with their special dialects where Ghazni, Daykundi, Behsud, Bamyan, Darah Sof and Sheikh Ali are from most popular.

==Health==

Leprosy has been reported in the Hazarajat region of Afghanistan. The vast majority (80%) of the leprosy victims are Hazara.

A 1989 report noted that common diseases in the Hazarajat included gastrointestinal infections, typhoid, whooping cough, measles, leprosy, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis and malaria.

<text>The Indian National Army (INA, sometimes Second INA; &quot;Azad Hind Fauj&quot; ; &#x27;Free Indian Army&#x27;) was a Japanese-allied and -supported armed force constituted in Southeast Asia during World War II and led by Indian anti-colonial nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose. It comprised British Indian Army POWs taken by Japan and enlisting civilians in the region. The INA aimed to liberate India from British rule.
After winning Japanese assent for its goal,
the INA furnished support to the Japanese Army. The Japanese and INA forces invaded India from Rangoon in 1944, and Bose&#x27;s nominal Provisional Government of Azad Hind declared war on Britain. But losses inflicted by the British in the Battle of Imphal in Manipur caused the invasion to be halted. A long and exhausting withdrawal, accompanied by a lack of supplies, malnutrition, and death, ensued, some victorious soldiers in the Indian Army not taking INA battlefield surrender kindly. The remaining INA was driven down the Malay Peninsula and surrendered to Allied forces in August 1945. 

An earlier incarnation of the INA, the First Indian National Army, had been founded in 1942 by Iwaichi Fujiwara and Mohan Singh. However, Mohan Singh refused to align with the Japanese, leading to his arrest and the First INA&#x27;s disbandment. After Subhas Chandra Bose arrived in Southeast Asia from Nazi Germany in May 1943, he refounded the INA with significant recruitment from Indian civilian communities in Malaya and Singapore.

Subhas Bose had both drive and charisma—promoting Indian slogans, such as &quot;Jai Hind,&quot; which became highly popular—and the INA under Bose was a model of diversity by region, ethnicity, religion, and gender. Bose&#x27;s impassioned speeches may have been a factor in the POWs and civilians joining the INA. Bitterness at their discriminatory treatment by the British, and a sense of abandonment by the British after the Fall of Singapore may have been factors. The examples of POWs who did not join being shipped to distant Japanese labour camps may have been another factor. The INA followed Japanese military strategy but had its own military law and police. Although the INA has been described as a collaborationist force, its battlefield performance was poor, and its formation did not constitute a legitimate mutiny. The INA did not oppose Japanese Fascism, nor protest Japanese war crimes that occurred amongst its midst. 

After the INA&#x27;s initial formation in 1942, there was concern in the British Indian Army that further Indian troops would defect. This led to a reporting ban and a propaganda campaign called &quot;Jiffs&quot; to preserve the loyalty of the Sepoy. The British Raj, never seriously threatened by the INA, charged 300 INA officers with treason in the INA trials, but eventually backtracked in the face of opposition by the Congress. These trials became a galvanising point in the Indian Independence movement for the Indian National Congress. A number of people associated with the INA during the war later went on to hold important roles in public life in India as well as in other countries in Southeast Asia, most notably Lakshmi Sehgal in India, and John Thivy and Janaki Athinahappan in Malaya.

==First INA==

Before the start of World War II, Japan and South-East Asia were major refuges for exiled Indian nationalists. Meanwhile, Japan had sent intelligence missions, notably under Maj. Iwaichi Fujiwara, into South Asia to gather support from the Malayan sultans, overseas Chinese, the Burmese resistance and the Indian independence movement. The Minami Kikan successfully recruited Burmese nationalists, while the F Kikan was successful in establishing contacts with Indian nationalists in exile in Thailand and Malaya. Fujiwara, later self-described as &quot;Lawrence of the Indian National Army&quot; (after Lawrence of Arabia) is said to have been a man committed to the values which his office was supposed to convey to the expatriate nationalist leaders, and found acceptance among them. His initial contact was with Giani Pritam Singh and the Thai-Bharat Cultural Lodge.
At the outbreak of World War II in South-East Asia, 70,000 Indian troops (mostly Sikhs) were stationed in Malaya. In Japan&#x27;s spectacular Malayan Campaign many Indian prisoners-of-war were captured, including nearly 45,000 after the fall of Singapore alone. The conditions of service within the British-Indian Army and the social conditions in Malaya had led to dissension among these troops. From these prisoners, the First Indian National Army was formed under Mohan Singh. Singh was an officer in the British-Indian Army who was captured early in the Malayan campaign. His nationalist sympathies found an ally in Fujiwara and he received considerable Japanese aid and support. Ethnic Indians in Southeast Asia also supported the cause of Indian independence and had formed local leagues in Malaya before the war. These came together with encouragement from Japan after the occupation, forming the Indian Independence League (IIL).

Although there were a number of prominent local Indians working in the IIL, the overall leadership came to rest with Rash Behari Bose, an Indian revolutionary who had lived in self-exile in Japan since World War I. The League and INA leadership decided that the INA was to be subordinate to the IIL. A working council – composed of prominent members of the League and the INA leaders – was to decide on decisions to send the INA to war. The Indian leaders feared that they would appear to be Japanese puppets, so a decision was taken that the INA would go to battle only when the Indian National Congress called it to do so. Assurances of non-interference— later termed the Bidadary resolutions— were demanded of Japan; these would have amounted to a treaty with an independent government. In this time, F. Kikan had been replaced by the Iwakuro Kikan (or I Kikan) headed by Hideo Iwakuro. Iwakuro&#x27;s working relationship with the league was more tenuous. Japan did not immediately agree to the demands arising from the Bidadary resolutions. Differences also existed between Rash Behari and the League, not least because Rash Behari had lived in Japan for the considerable time and had a Japanese wife and a son in the Imperial Japanese Army. On the other hand, Mohan Singh expected military strategy and decisions to be autonomous decisions for the INA, independent of the league.

In November and December 1942, concern about Japan&#x27;s intentions towards the INA led to disagreement between the INA and the League on the one hand and the Japanese on the other. The INA leadership resigned along with that of the League (except Rash Behari). The unit was dissolved by Mohan Singh in December 1942, and he ordered the troops of the INA to return to PoW camps. Mohan Singh was expected to be shot.

Between December 1942 and February 1943, Rash Behari struggled to hold the INA together. On 15 February 1943, the army itself was put under the command of Lt. Col. M.Z. Kiani. A policy forming body was formed with Lt. Col J.R. Bhonsle (Director of the Military Bureau) in charge and clearly placed under the authority of the IIL. Under Bhonsle served Lt. Col. Shah Nawaz Khan as Chief of General Staff, Major P.K. Sahgal as Military Secretary, Major Habib ur Rahman as commandant of the Officers&#x27; Training School and Lt. Col. A.C. Chatterji (later Major A.D. Jahangir) as head of enlightenment and culture.

==Second INA==

===Subhas Chandra Bose===
Subhas Chandra Bose was the ideal person to lead a rebel army into India came from the very beginning of F Kikan&#x27;s work with captured Indian soldiers. Mohan Singh himself, soon after his first meeting with Fujiwara, had suggested that Bose was the right leader of a nationalist Indian army. A number of the officers and troops – including some who now returned to prisoner-of-war camps and some who had not volunteered in the first place – made it known that they would be willing to join the INA only if it was led by Subhas Bose. Bose was a nationalist. He had joined the Gandhian movement after resigning from a prestigious post in the Indian Civil Service in 1922, quickly rising in the Congress and being incarcerated repeatedly by the Raj. By late 1920s he and Nehru were considered the future leaders of the Congress. In the late 1920s, he was amongst the first Congress leaders to call for complete independence from Britain (&quot;Purna Swaraj&quot;), rather than the previous Congress objective of India becoming a British dominion. In Bengal, he was repeatedly accused by Raj officials of working with the revolutionary movement. Under his leadership, the Congress youth group in Bengal was organised into a quasi-military organisation called the Bengal Volunteers. Bose deplored Gandhi&#x27;s pacifism; Gandhi disagreed with Bose&#x27;s confrontations with the Raj. The Congress&#x27;s working committee, including Nehru, was predominantly loyal to Gandhi. While openly disagreeing with Gandhi, Bose won the presidency of Indian National Congress twice in the 1930s. His second victory came despite opposition from Gandhi. He defeated Gandhi&#x27;s favoured candidate, Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya, in the popular vote, but the entire working committee resigned and refused to work with Bose. Bose resigned from the Congress presidency and founded his own faction within the Congress, the All India Forward Bloc.

At the start of World War II, Bose was placed under house arrest by the Raj. He escaped in disguise and made his way through Afghanistan and Central -Asia. He came first to the Soviet Union and then to Germany, reaching Berlin on 2 April 1941. There he sought to raise an army of Indian soldiers from prisoners of war captured by Germany, forming the Free India Legion and the &quot;Azad Hind&quot; Radio. The Japanese ambassador, Oshima Hiroshi, kept Tokyo informed of these developments. From the very start of the war, the Japanese intelligence services noted from speaking to captured Indian soldiers that Bose was held in extremely high regard as a nationalist and was considered by Indian soldiers to be the right person to be leading a rebel army.

In a series of meetings between the INA leaders and the Japanese in 1943, it was decided to cede the leadership of the IIL and the INA to Bose. In January 1943, the Japanese invited Bose to lead the Indian nationalist movement in East Asia. He accepted and left Germany on 8 February. After a three-month journey by submarine and a short stop in Singapore, he reached Tokyo on 11 May 1943. In Tokyo, he met Hideki Tojo, the Japanese prime minister, and the Japanese High Command. He then arrived in Singapore in July 1943, where he made a number of radio broadcasts to Indians in Southeast Asia exhorting them to join in the fight for India&#x27;s independence.

===Revival===
On 4 July 1943 two days after reaching Singapore, Bose assumed the leadership of the IIL and the Indian National Army in a ceremony at Cathay Building. Bose&#x27;s influence was notable. His appeal re-invigorated the INA, which had previously consisted mainly of prisoners of war: it also attracted Indian expatriates in South Asia. He famously proclaimed that &quot;Give me blood! I will give you freedom&quot;

&quot;Local civilians joined the INA, doubling its strength. They included barristers, traders and plantation workers, as well as Khudabadi Sindhi Swarankars who were working as shop keepers; many had no military experience.&quot; Carl Vadivella Belle estimates under Bose&#x27;s dynamic appeal, membership of the IIL peaked at 350,000, while almost 100,000 local Indians in South-east Asia volunteered to join the INA, with the army ultimately reaching a force of 50,000. Hugh Toye— a British Intelligence officer and author of a 1959 history of the army called &quot;The Springing Tiger&quot;— and American historian Peter Fay (author of a 1993 history called &quot;The Forgotten Army&quot;) have reached similar estimates of troop strength. The first INA is considered to have comprised about 40,000 troops, of whom about 4,000 withdrew when it was disbanded in December 1942. The Second INA started with 12,000 troops. Further recruitment of former Indian Army personnel added about 8,000–10,000. About 18,000 Indian civilians also enlisted during this time. Belle estimates almost 20,000 were local Malayan Indians, while another 20,000 were ex-British-Indian Army members who volunteered for the INA. 

The exact organisation of the INA and its precise troop strength is not known, since its records were destroyed by the withdrawing &quot;Azad Hind&quot; Government before Rangoon was recaptured by Commonwealth forces in 1945. The order of battle described by Fay (constructed from discussions with INA-veterans), nonetheless, is similar to that described of the first INA by Toye in &quot;The Springing Tiger&quot;. The 1st Division, under M.Z. Kiani, drew many ex-Indian army prisoners of war who had joined Mohan Singh&#x27;s first INA. It also drew prisoners of war who had not joined in 1942. It consisted of the 2nd Guerrilla Regiment (the Gandhi Brigade) consisting of two battalions under Col. Inayat Kiani; the 3rd Guerrilla Regiment (the Azad Brigade) with three battalions under Col. Gulzara Singh; and the 4th Guerrilla Regiment (or Nehru Brigade) commanded by the end of the war by Lt. Col Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon. The 1st Guerrilla Regiment – the Subhas Brigade – under Col. Shah Nawaz Khan was an independent unit, consisting of three infantry battalions. A special operations group was also to be set up called the &quot;Bahadur group&quot; (Valiant), to operate behind enemy lines.

A training school for INA officers, led by Habib ur Rahman, and the &quot;Azad&quot; School for the civilian volunteers were set up to provide training to the recruits. A youth wing of the INA, composed of 45 young Indians personally chosen by Bose and known as the Tokyo Boys, was also sent to Japan&#x27;s Imperial Military Academy, where its members trained as fighter pilots. A separate all-female unit was also created under Lakshmi Sahgal. This unit was intended to have combat-commitments. Named &quot;Jhansi ki Rani&quot; (&quot;Jhansi Queens&quot;) Regiment (after the legendary rebel Queen Lakshmibai of the 1857 rebellion), it drew female civilian volunteers from Malaya and Burma. The 1st Division was lightly armed. Each battalion was composed of five companies of infantry. The individual companies were armed with six antitank rifles, six Bren guns and six Vickers machine guns. Some NCOs carried hand grenades, while senior officers of the &quot;Bahadur&quot; groups attached to each unit issued hand grenades (of captured British stock) to men going forward on duty.

The 2nd Division was organised under Colonel Abdul Aziz Tajik It was formed largely after the Imphal offensive had started and drew large remnants of what remained of the Hindustan Field Force of the First INA. The 2nd Division consisted of the 1st Infantry Regiment, which later merged with the 5th Guerrilla Regiment to form the INA&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Regiment under Col Prem Sahgal. The 1st Infantry Regiment drew many civilian volunteers from Burma and Malaya and was equipped with the largest share of the heavy armament that the INA possessed. An additional 3rd Division of the INA was composed chiefly of local volunteers in Malaya and Singapore. This unit disbanded before Japan surrendered. A motor transport division was also created, but it was severely limited by lack of resources. In 1945, at the end of the INA, it consisted of about 40,000 soldiers.
Unlike Mohan Singh, whose assumption of the rank of general had generated opposition, Bose refused to take a rank. Both the soldiers of the INA and civilians addressed Bose as &quot;Netaji&quot; (&quot;Dear leader&quot;), a term first used in Berlin by members of the Free India Legion. In October 1943, Bose proclaimed the formation of the &quot;Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind&quot;, or the Provisional Government of Free India (also known as &quot;Azad Hind&quot; or Free India). The INA was declared to be the army of &quot;Azad Hind&quot;.

==Operations==


On 23 October 1943, &quot;Azad Hind&quot; declared war against Britain and the United States. Its first formal commitment came with the opening of the Japanese offensive towards Manipur, code-named &quot;U-Go&quot;. In the initial plans for invasion of India, Field Marshal Terauchi had been reluctant to confer any responsibilities to the INA beyond espionage and propaganda. Bose rejected this as the role of Fifth-columnists, and insisted that INA should contribute substantially in troops to form a distinct identity of an Indian-liberation army. He secured from Japanese army Chief of Staff, General Sugiyama, the agreement that INA would rank as an allied army in the offensive. The advanced headquarters of &quot;Azad Hind&quot; was moved to Rangoon in anticipation of success. The INA&#x27;s own strategy was to avoid set-piece battles, for which it lacked armament as well as manpower. Initially it sought to obtain arms and increase its ranks by inducing British-Indian soldiers to defect. The latter were expected to defect in large numbers. Col Prem Sahgal, once military secretary to Subhas Bose and later tried in the first Red Fort trials, explained the INA strategy to Peter Fay – although the war itself hung in balance and nobody was sure if the Japanese would win, initiating a popular revolution with grass-roots support within India would ensure that even if Japan ultimately lost the war, Britain would not be in a position to re-assert its colonial authority. It was planned that, once Japanese forces had broken through British defences at Imphal, the INA would cross the hills of North-East India into the Gangetic plain, where it would work as a guerrilla army. This army was expected to live off the land, with captured British supplies, support, and personnel from the local population.

===1944===
The plans chosen by Bose and Masakazu Kawabe, chief of the Burma area army, envisaged the INA being assigned an independent sector in the &quot;U-Go&quot; offensive. No INA units were to operate at less than battalion strength. For operational purposes, the Subhas Brigade was placed under the command of the Japanese General Headquarters in Burma. Advance parties of the &quot;Bahadur&quot; Group also went forward with advanced Japanese units. As the offensive opened, the INA&#x27;s 1st Division, consisting of four guerrilla regiments, was divided between &quot;U Go&quot; and the diversionary &quot;Ha-Go&quot; offensive in Arakan. One battalion reached as far as Mowdok in Chittagong after breaking through the British West African Division. A Bahadur Group unit, led by Col. Shaukat Malik, took the border enclave of Moirang in early April. The main body of the 1st Division was however committed to the &quot;U-Go&quot;, directed towards Manipur. Led by Shah Nawaz Khan, it successfully protected the Japanese flanks against Chin and Kashin guerrillas as Renya Mutaguchi&#x27;s three divisions crossed the Chindwin river and the Naga Hills, and participated in the main offensive through Tamu in the direction of Imphal and Kohima. The 2nd Division, under M.Z. Kiani, was placed to the right flank of the 33rd Division attacking Kohima. However, by the time Khan&#x27;s forces left Tamu, the offensive had been held, and Khan&#x27;s troops were redirected to Kohima. After reaching Ukhrul, near Kohima, they found Japanese forces had begun their withdrawal from the area. The INA&#x27;s forces suffered the same fate as Mutaguchi&#x27;s army when the siege of Imphal was broken. With little or nothing in the way of supplies, and with additional difficulties caused by the monsoon, Allied air dominance, and Burmese irregular forces, the 1st and 2nd divisions began withdrawing alongside the 15th Army and Burma Area Army. During the withdrawal through Manipur, a weakened Gandhi regiment held its position against the advancing Maratha Light Infantry on the Burma–India road while the general withdrawal was prepared. The 2nd and 3rd INA regiments protected the flanks of the Yamamoto force successfully at the most critical time during this withdrawal, but wounded and diseased men succumbed to starvation along the route. Commonwealth troops following the Japanese forces found INA dead along with Japanese troops who had died of starvation. The INA lost a substantial number of men and amount of materiel in this retreat. A number of units were disbanded or used to feed into new divisions.

===1945===

As the Allied Burma campaign began the following year, the INA remained committed to the defence of Burma and was a part of the Japanese defensive deployments. The Second Division was tasked with the defence of Irrawaddy and the adjoining areas around Nangyu, and offered opposition to Messervy&#x27;s 7th Indian Division when it attempted to cross the river at Pagan and Nyangyu during Irrawaddy operations. Later, during the Battles of Meiktila and Mandalay, the forces under Prem Sahgal were tasked with defending the area around Mount Popa from the British 17th Division, which would have exposed the flank of Heitarō Kimura&#x27;s forces attempting to retake Meiktila and Nyangyu. The division was obliterated, at times fighting tanks with hand grenades and bottles of petrol. Many INA soldiers realised that they were in a hopeless position. Many surrendered to pursuing Commonwealth forces. Isolated, losing men to exhaustion and to desertion, low on ammunition and food, and pursued by Commonwealth forces, the surviving units of the second division began an attempt to withdraw towards Rangoon. They broke through encircling Commonwealth lines a number of times before finally surrendering at various places in early April 1945. As the Japanese situation became precarious, the &quot;Azad Hind&quot; government withdrew from Rangoon to Singapore, along with the remnants of the 1st Division and the Rani of Jhansi Regiment. Nearly 6,000 troops of the surviving units of the INA remained in Rangoon under A. D. Loganathan. They surrendered as Rangoon fell and helped keep order until the Allied forces entered the city.

As the Japanese withdrawal from Burma progressed, other remnants of the INA began a long march overland and on foot towards Bangkok. In what has been called an &quot;epic retreat to safety&quot;, Bose walked with his troops, refusing to leave them despite Japanese soldiers finding him transport. The withdrawing forces regularly suffered casualties from Allied planes strafing them and in clashes with Aung San&#x27;s Burmese resistance, as well as from Chinese guerrillas who harassed the Japanese troops. Bose returned to Singapore in August to what remained of the INA and &quot;Azad Hind&quot;. He wished to stay with his government in Singapore to surrender to the British, reasoning that a trial in India and possible execution would ignite the country, serving the independence movement. He was convinced not to do so by the &quot;Azad Hind&quot; cabinet. At the time of Japan&#x27;s surrender in September 1945, Bose left for Dalian near the Soviet border in Japanese-occupied China to attempt to contact the advancing Soviet troops, and was reported to have died in an air crash near Taiwan. The remaining INA troops surrendered under the command of M.Z. Kiani to British-Indian forces at Singapore.

==End of the INA==

===Repatriation to India===
Even before the end of the war in South Asia, the INA prisoners who were falling into Allied hands were being evaluated by forwarding intelligence units for potential trials. Almost fifteen hundred had been captured in the battles of Imphal and Kohima and the subsequent withdrawal, while larger numbers surrendered or were captured during the 14th Army&#x27;s Burma Campaign. A total of 16,000 of the INA&#x27;s 43,000 recruits were captured, of whom around 11,000 were interrogated by the Combined Services Directorate of Investigation Corps (CSDIC). The number of prisoners necessitated this selective policy which anticipated trials of those with the strongest commitment to Bose&#x27;s ideologies. Those with lesser commitment or other extenuating circumstances would be dealt with more leniently, with the punishment proportional to their commitment or war crimes. For this purpose, the field intelligence units designated the captured troops as &quot;Blacks&quot; with the strongest commitment to &quot;Azad Hind&quot;; &quot;Greys&quot; with varying commitment but also with enticing circumstances that led them to join the INA; and &quot;Whites&quot;, those who were pressured into joining the INA under the circumstances but with no commitment to &quot;Azad Hind&quot;, INA, or Bose.

By July 1945, a large number had been shipped back to India. At the time of the fall of Japan, the remaining captured troops were transported to India via Rangoon. Large numbers of local Malay and Burmese volunteers, including the recruits to the Rani of Jhansi regiment, returned to civilian life and were not identified. Those repatriated passed through transit camps in Chittagong and Calcutta to be held at detention camps all over India including Jhingergacha and Nilganj near Calcutta, Kirkee outside Pune, Attock, Multan and at Bahadurgarh near Delhi. Bahadurgarh also held prisoners of the Free India Legion. By November, around 12,000 INA prisoners were held in these camps; they were released according to the &quot;colours&quot;. By December, around 600 &quot;Whites&quot; were released per week. The process to select those to face trial started.

The British-Indian Army intended to implement appropriate internal disciplinary action against its soldiers who had joined the INA, whilst putting to trial a selected group in order to preserve discipline in the Indian Army and to award punishment for criminal acts where these had occurred. As news of the army spread within India, it began to draw widespread sympathy support and admiration from Indians. Newspaper reports around November 1945 reported executions of INA troops, which worsened the already volatile situation. Increasingly violent confrontations broke out between the police and protesters at the mass rallies being held all over India, culminating in public riotings in support of the INA men. This public outcry defied traditional communal barriers of the subcontinent, representing a departure from the divisions between Hindus and Muslims seen elsewhere in the independence movement and campaign for Pakistan.

===Red Fort trials===

Between November 1945 and May 1946, approximately ten courts-martial were held in public at the Red Fort in Delhi. Claude Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the British-Indian army, hoped that by holding public trials in the Red Fort, public opinion would turn against the INA if the media reported stories of torture and collaborationism, helping him settle a political as well as military question. Those to stand trials were accused variously of murder, torture and &quot;waging war against the King-Emperor&quot;. However, the first and most celebrated joint courts-martial – those of Prem Sahgal, Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan – were not the story of torture and murder Auchinleck had hoped to tell the Indian press and people. The accusations against them included the alleged murder of their comrades-in-arms in the INA whilst in Burma. Peter Fay highlights in his book &quot;The Forgotten Army&quot; that the murders alleged were, in fact, courts-martial of captured deserters the defendants had presided over. If it was accepted that the three were part of a genuine combatant army (as the legal defence team later argued), they had followed due process of written INA law and of the normal process of conduct of war in execution of the sentences. Indians rapidly came to view the soldiers who enlisted as patriots and not enemy-collaborators. Philip Mason, then-Secretary of the War Department, later wrote that &quot;in a matter of weeks ... in a wave of nationalist emotion, the INA were acclaimed heroes who fought for the freedom of India.&quot; The three accused were from the three major religions of India: Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. Indians felt the INA represented a true, secular, national army when judged against the British-Indian Army, where caste and religious differences were preserved amongst ranks. The opening of the first trial saw violence and a series of riots in a scale later described as &quot;sensational&quot;. The Indian National Congress and the Muslim League both made the release of the INA prisoners an important political issue during the campaign for independence in 1945–1946. Lahore in Diwali 1946 remained dark as the traditional earthen lamps lit on Diwali were not lit by families in support of prisoners. In addition to civilian campaigns of non-cooperation and non-violent protest, protest spread to include mutinies within the British-Indian Army and sympathy within the British-Indian forces. Support for the INA crossed communal barriers to the extent that it was the last major campaign in which the Congress and the Muslim League aligned together; the Congress tricolour and the green flag of the League were flown together at protests.

The Congress quickly came forward to defend soldiers of the INA who were to be court-martialled. The INA Defence Committee was formed by the Indian Congress and included prominent Indian legal figures, among whom were Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhulabhai Desai, Kailashnath Katju and Asaf Ali. The trials covered arguments based on military law, constitutional law, international law, and politics. Mithi Mukherjee call the trials a &quot;key moment in the elaboration of an anticolonial critique of international law in India.&quot; Much of the initial defence was based on the argument that they should be treated as prisoners of war as they were not paid mercenaries but &quot;bona fide&quot; soldiers of a legal government – Bose&#x27;s &quot;Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind&quot;. Nehru argued that &quot;however misinformed or otherwise they had been in their notion of patriotic duty towards their country&quot;, they recognized the free Indian state as their sovereign and not the British sovereign. Peter Fay points out that at least one INA prisoner – Burhan-ud-Din  a brother of the ruler of Chitral – may have deserved to be accused of torture, but his trial had been deferred on administrative grounds. Those charged after the first celebrated courts-martial only faced trial for torture and murder or abetment of murder. Charges of treason were dropped for fear of inflaming public opinion. 

In spite of aggressive and widespread opposition to the continuation of the court-martial, it was completed. All three defendants were found guilty in many of the charges and sentenced to deportation for life. The sentence, however, was never carried out. Immense public pressure, demonstrations, and riots forced Claude Auchinleck to release all three defendants. Within three months, 11,000 soldiers of the INA were released after cashiering and forfeiture of pay and allowance. On the recommendation of Lord Mountbatten and with the agreement of Jawaharlal Nehru, former soldiers of the INA were not allowed to join the new Indian Armed Forces as a condition for independence. 

Some mutinies in the Royal Indian Navy in 1946 are thought to have been caused by the nationalist feelings inspired by the opposition to INA trials. Historians like Sumit Sarkar, Peter Cohen, Fay and others suggest that these events played a crucial role in hastening the end of British rule. 

==Post 1947==
Within India, the INA continues to be an emotive and celebrated subject of discussion. It continued to have a stronghold over the public psyche and the sentiments of the armed forces until as late as 1947. It has been suggested that Shah Nawaz Khan was tasked with organising INA troops to train Congress volunteers at Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s request in late 1946 and early 1947. After 1947, several members of the INA who were closely associated with Subhas Bose and with the INA trials were prominent in public life. A number of them held important positions in independent India, serving as ambassadors immediately after independence: Abid Hasan in Egypt and Denmark, A. C. N. Nambiar in the Federal Republic of Germany, Mehboob Hasan in Canada, Cyril John Stracey in the Netherlands, and N. Raghavan in Switzerland. Mohan Singh was elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament. He worked for the recognition of the members of Indian National Army as &quot;freedom fighters&quot; in the cause of the nation&#x27;s independence in and out of Parliament. Shah Nawaz Khan served as Minister of State for Rail in the first Indian cabinet. Lakshmi Sahgal, Minister for Women&#x27;s Affairs in the &quot;Azad Hind&quot; government, was a well known and widely respected public figure in India. In 1971, she joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and was later elected the leader of the All India Democratic Women&#x27;s Association. Joyce Lebra, an American historian, wrote that the rejuvenation of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, then a fledgling Tamil political party in southern India, would not have been possible without participation of INA members.
Some accounts suggest that the INA veterans were involved in training civilian resistance forces against the Nizam&#x27;s Razakars prior to the execution of Operation Polo and annexation of Hyderabad.
It has been also documented that some INA veterans led Pakistani irregulars during the First Kashmir war. Mohammed Zaman Kiani served as Pakistan&#x27;s political agent to Gilgit in the late 1950s. Of the very few ex-INA members who joined the Indian Armed Forces after 1947 R. S. Benegal, a member of the Tokyo Boys, joined the Indian Air Force in 1952 and later rose to be an air commodore. Benegal saw action in both 1965 and Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, earning a Maha Vir Chakra, India&#x27;s second-highest award for valour.

Among other prominent members of the INA, Ram Singh Thakur, composer of a number of songs including the INA&#x27;s regimental march Qadam Qadam Badhaye Ja, has been credited by some for the modern tune of the Indian national anthem.

Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Lakshmi Sahgal were later awarded the Indian civilian honours of Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan respectively by the Indian Government in the 1990s. Lakshmi Sahgal was nominated for the Indian presidential election by communist parties in 2002. She was the sole opponent of A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, who emerged victorious. Subhas Bose himself was posthumously awarded Bharat Ratna in 1992, but this was later withdrawn over the controversy over the circumstances of his death.

Former INA recruits in diasporic Singapore, however, faced a different situation. In Singapore, Indians – particularly those who were associated with the INA – were treated with disdain as they were &quot;stigmatized as fascists and Japanese collaborators&quot;. Some within this diaspora later emerged as notable political and social leaders. The consolidation of trade unions in the form of National Union of Plantation Workers was led by ex-INA leaders. In Malaya, notable members of the INA were involved in founding the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) in 1946; John Thivy was the founding president. Janaky Athi Nahappan, second-in-command of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, was also a founding member of the MIC and later became a noted welfare activist and a distinguished senator in the Dewan Negara of the Malaysian Parliament. Rasammah Bhupalan, also of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, later became a well-known welfare-activist and a widely respected champion for women&#x27;s rights in Malaysia.

==Relations==
===Japanese Army===
The INA was known as the puppet army of the Japanese empire. In early days, the officers in the INA distrusted the Japanese. Leaders of the first INA sought formal assurances from Japan before committing to war. When these did not arrive, Mohan Singh resigned after ordering his army to disband; he expected to be sentenced to death. After Bose established &quot;Azad Hind&quot;, he tried to establish his political independence from the regime that supported him. Indeed, he had led protests against the Japanese expansion into China, and supported Chiang Kai-shek during the 1930s. Azad &quot;Hind&quot; depended on Japan for arms and material but sought to be as financially independent as possible, levying taxes and raising donations from Indians in Southeast Asia&quot;. On the Japanese side, members of the high command had been personally impressed by Bose and were willing to grant him some latitude; more importantly, the Japanese were interested in maintaining the support of a man who had been able to mobilise large numbers of Indian expatriates – including, most importantly, 40,000 of the 45,000 Indians captured by the Japanese at Singapore. However, Faye notes that interactions between soldiers in the field was different. Attempts to use Shah Nawaz&#x27;s troops in road building and as porters angered the troops, forcing Bose to intervene with Mutaguchi. After the withdrawal from Imphal, the relations between both junior non-commissioned officers and between senior officers had deteriorated. INA officers accused the Japanese Army high command of trying to deceive INA troops into fighting for Japan. Conversely, Japanese soldiers often expressed disdain for INA soldiers for having changed their oath of loyalty. This mutual dislike was especially strong after the withdrawal from Imphal began; Japanese soldiers, suspicious that INA defectors had been responsible for their defeat, addressed INA soldiers as &quot;shameless one&quot; instead of &quot;comrade&quot; as previously had been the case. &quot;Azad Hind&quot; officials in Burma reported difficulties with the Japanese military administration in arranging supply for troops and transport for wounded men as the armies withdrew. Toye notes that local IIL members and &quot;Azad Hind Dal&quot; (local &quot;Azad Hind&quot; administrative teams) organised relief supplies from Indians in Burma at this time. As the situation in Burma became hopeless for the Japanese, Bose refused requests to use INA troops against Aung San&#x27;s Burma National Army, which had turned against Japan and was now allied with Commonwealth forces.
===British-Indian Army===

The first interaction of the INA with the British-Indian forces was during the months during the First Arakan offensive, between December 1942 and March 1943. The morale of &quot;Sepoys&quot; during this time was low and knowledge about the INA was minimal. The INA&#x27;s special services agents led a successful operation during this time in encouraging the Indian troops to defect to the INA. By the end of March 1945, however, the &quot;Sepoys&quot; in the British-Indian Army were reinvigorated and perceived the men of the INA to be savage turncoats and cowards. Senior British officers in the Indian Army considered them &quot;rabble&quot;. Historians Christopher Bayly and Tim Harper mention that sepoys in field units shot captured or wounded INA men, relieving their British officers of the complex task of formulating a formal plan for captured men. After Singapore was retaken, Mountbatten ordered the INA&#x27;s war memorial to its fallen soldiers to be blown up.

As the story of the INA unfolded in post-war India, the view of Indian soldiers on the INA – and on their own position during the war – also changed. The Raj observed with increasing disquiet and unease the spread of pro-INA sympathies within the troops of the British-Indian forces. In February 1946, while the trials were still going on, a general strike by ratings of the Royal Indian Navy rapidly deteriorated into a mutiny incorporating ships and shore establishments of the RIN throughout India. The mutineers raised slogans invoking Subhas Bose and the INA, demanding an end to the trials. The mutiny received widespread public support. In some places in the British-Indian Army, non-commissioned Officers started ignoring orders from British superiors. In Madras and Pune British garrisons faced revolts from within the ranks of the British-Indian Army. These were suppressed by force. At the conclusion of the first trial, when the sentences of deportation were commuted, Fay records Claude Auchinleck as having sent a &quot;personal and secret&quot; letter to all senior British officers, explaining: 

==Influence==

===World War II===
Sidney Bradshaw Fay concludes that the INA was not significant enough to beat the British-Indian Army by military strength. He also writes that the INA was aware of this and formulated its own strategy of avoiding set-piece battles, gathering local and popular support within India and instigating revolt within the British-Indian Army to overthrow the Raj. Moreover, the Forward Bloc underground movement within India had been crushed well before the offensives opened in the Burma–Manipur theatre, depriving the army of any organised internal support. However, despite its small numerical strength and lack of heavy weapons, its special services group played a significant part in halting the First Arakan Offensive while still under Mohan Singh&#x27;s command. The propaganda threat of the INA and lack of concrete intelligence on the unit early after the fall of Singapore made it a threat to Allied war plans in Southeast Asia, since it threatened to destroy the &quot;Sepoys&quot;&#x27; loyalty to a British-Indian Army that was demoralised from continuing defeats. There were reports of INA operatives successfully infiltrating Commonwealth lines during the Offensive. This caused British intelligence to begin the &quot;Jiffs&quot; propaganda campaign and to create &quot;Josh&quot; groups to improve the morale and preserve the loyalty of the sepoys as consolidation began to prepare for the defence of Manipur. These measures included imposing a complete news ban on Bose and the INA that was not lifted until four days after the fall of Rangoon two years later.

During the Japanese &quot;U-Go&quot; offensive towards Manipur in 1944, the INA played a crucial (and successful) role in diversionary attacks in Arakan and in the Manipur Basin itself, where it fought alongside Mutaguchi&#x27;s 15th Army. INA forces protected the flanks of the assaulting Yamamoto force at a critical time as the latter attempted to take Imphal. During the Commonwealth Burma Campaign, the INA troops fought in the battles of Irrawaddy and Meiktilla, supporting the Japanese offensive and tying down Commonwealth troops.

===Indian independence===

The first INA trial, which was held in public, became a rallying point for the independence movement from the autumn of 1945. The release of INA prisoners and the suspension of the trials came to be the dominant political campaign, superseding the campaign for independence. Christopher Bayly notes that the &quot;INA was to become a much more powerful enemy of the British empire in defeat than it had been during its ill-fated triumphal march on Delhi.&quot; The Viceroy&#x27;s journal describes the autumn and winter of 1945–1946 as &quot;The Edge of a Volcano&quot;. The setting of the trial at Red Fort was taken by Indian public as a deliberate taunt by the British Raj over the vanquished INA, recalling the INA&#x27;s battle cries of unfurling the Indian tricolour over the Red Fort. Many compared the trials to that of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor tried in the same place after the failed 1857 uprising. Support for the INA grew rapidly and their continued detention and news of impending trials was seen an affront to the movement for independence and to Indian identity itself. It was further feared that the Congress would exploit the INA to gain mass support against the Raj and possibly start an armed struggle with weapons smuggled from Burma. Nehru was suspected of using INA men to train Congress volunteers. The political effects of the INA trials were enormous and were felt around India as late as 1948, much to the chagrin of the Congress government in independent India, which feared that pro-INA sympathies could help alternative sources of power.

Historians such as Sumit Sarkar, Sugata Bose, and Ayesha Jalal conclude that the INA trials and its after-effects brought a decisive shift in British policy towards independence Indian. Particularly disturbing was the overt and public support for the INA by the soldiers of the Indian Army and the mutinies. The Congress&#x27;s rhetoric preceding the 1946 elections gave the Raj reasons to fear a revival of the Quit India Movement of 1942. Gandhi noted:
===British colonies===

After the war ended, the story of the INA and the Indian Legion was seen as so inflammatory that, fearing mass revolts and uprisings across its empire, the British Government forbade the BBC from broadcasting their story. The use of Indian troops for the restoration of Dutch and French rule in Vietnam and Indonesia fed into the already growing resentment within the forces. Indian troops sent to suppress Sukarno&#x27;s agitations in Indonesia in 1946 rapidly identified with the nationalist sentiments in the previous Dutch colony. The South East Asia Command reported growing sympathy for the INA and dislike of the Dutch. There were similar pro-nationalist sentiments among Indian troops sent to Vietnam, Thailand and Burma. This led to the realisation by 1946 that the British-Indian Army, the bulwark of the policing force in the British colonies, could not be used as an instrument of British power. INA-inspired strikes emerged throughout Britain&#x27;s colonies in Southeast Asia. In January 1946, protests started at Royal Air Force bases in Karachi and spread rapidly to Singapore. This was followed by a full-scale mutiny by a British Army unit in Singapore. In British Malaya, men of the Parachute Regiment refused to obey orders from their officers. Authors like Nilanjana Sengupta attribute these to a combination of dissatisfaction over pay and work conditions and conflicts of comradeship over the INA trials. Former INA members in Malaya identified closely with the left-wing organisations in opposing British colonial authority. The majority of prominent left-wing union leaders in Malaya after the war were members of the INA. The activities of the trade unions in the newly established Tamil schools were particularly influential, leading to the establishment of an inspector system by the British to supervise the curriculum and teaching in these schools. Joyce Lebra notes that the INA had a particularly strong unifying influence over ethnic Indians residing in Malaya. Lebra concludes that the experience of the INA was useful in challenging British authority in the post-war period in Malaya, and in improving the socio-economic conditions of the Indian community.

==Controversies==
British and Commonwealth troops viewed the recruits as traitors and Axis collaborators. Almost 40,000 Indian soldiers in Malaya did not join the army and remained as PoWs. Many were sent to work in the Death Railway, suffered hardships and nearly 11,000 died under Japanese internment. Many of them cited the oath of allegiance they had taken to the King among reasons not to join a Japanese-supported organisation, and regarded the recruits of the INA as traitors for having forsaken their oath. Commanders in the British-Indian Army like Wavell later highlighted the hardships this group of soldiers suffered, contrasting them with the troops of the INA. Many British soldiers held the same opinion. Hugh Toye and Peter Fay point out that the First INA consisted of a mix of recruits joining for various reasons, such as nationalistic leanings, Mohan Singh&#x27;s appeals, personal ambition or to protect men under their own command from harm. Fay notes some officers like Shah Nawaz Khan were opposed to Mohan Singh&#x27;s ideas and tried to hinder what they considered a collaborationist organisation. However, both historians note that Indian civilians and former INA soldiers all cite the tremendous influence of Subhas Bose and his appeal to patriotism in rejuvenating the INA. Fay discusses the topic of loyalty of the INA soldiers, and highlights that in Shah Nawaz Khan&#x27;s trial it was noted that officers of the INA warned their men the possibility of having to fight the Japanese after having fought the British, to prevent Japan exploiting post-war India. Carl Vadivella Belle suggested in 2014 that among the local Indians and ex-British-Indian Army volunteers in Malaya, there was a proportion who joined due to the threat of conscription as Japanese labour troops. Recruitment also offered local Indian labourers security from continual semi-starvation of the estates and served as a barrier against Japanese tyranny.

INA troops were alleged to engage in or be complicit in torture of Allied and Indian prisoners of war. Fay in his 1993 history analyses war-time press releases and field counter-intelligence directed at &quot;Sepoys&quot;. He concludes that the &quot;Jiffs&quot; campaign promoted the view that INA recruits were weak-willed and traitorous Axis collaborators, motivated by selfish interests of greed and personal gain. He concludes that the allegations of torture were largely products of the &quot;Jiffs&quot; campaign. He supports his conclusion by noting that isolated cases of torture had occurred, but allegations of widespread practice of torture were not substantiated in the charges against defendants in the Red Fort trials. Published memoirs of several veterans, including that of William Slim, portray the INA troops as incapable fighters and as untrustworthy. Toye noted in 1959 that individual desertions occurred in the withdrawal from Imphal. Fay concluded that stories of INA desertions during the battle and the initial retreat into Burma were largely exaggerated. The majority of desertions occurred much later, according to Fay, around the battles at Irrawaddy and later around Popa. Fay specifically discusses Slim&#x27;s portrayal of the INA, pointing out what he concludes to be inconsistencies in Slim&#x27;s accounts. Fay also discusses memoirs of Shah Nawaz, where Khan claims INA troops were never defeated in battle. Fay criticises this too as exaggerated. He concludes the opinions held by Commonwealth war veterans such as Slim were an inaccurate portrayal of the unit, as were those of INA soldiers themselves. Harkirat Singh notes that British officers&#x27; personal dislike for Subhas Chandra Bose may have prejudiced their judgement of the INA itself.

==Commemorations==

The INA is memorialised in the &quot;Swatantrata Sainani Smarak&quot;, which is located at the Salimgarh Fort in Delhi, adjacent to the Red Fort. Its exhibits include the Indian National Army uniform worn by Colonel Prem Sahgal, riding boots and coat buttons of Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and photographs of Subhas Chandra Bose. A separate gallery holds material and photographs from excavations carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India inside the fort in 1995. The Indian National Army Memorial at Moirang, Manipur, commemorates the place where the flag of &quot;Azad Hind&quot; was raised by Col. Shaukat Hayat Malik. Moirang was the first Indian territory captured by the INA.

The INA War Memorial at Singapore commemorating the &quot;Unknown Warrior&quot; of the INA was unveiled by Bose in July 1945. Situated at the Esplanade Park, it was destroyed on Mountbatten&#x27;s orders when Allied troops reoccupied the city. In 1995, the National Heritage Board of Singapore, with financial donations from the Indian community in Singapore, erected the Former Indian National Army Monument at the site where the old memorial stood. The site is now officially one of the historical sites of Singapore.

The INA&#x27;s battle cry, &quot;Jai Hind&quot;, was declared the &quot;national greeting&quot; of India by Nehru and remains a popular nationalist greeting. Today it is used by all Indian prime ministers to conclude their Independence Day speeches. The cry became independent India&#x27;s first commemorative post mark on 15 August 1947. The first postage stamps issued by Independent India are called the &quot;Jai Hind&quot; series of stamps, showing the Indian flag with the letters &quot;Jai Hind&quot; in the top right hand corner. These were a part of the series issued on 15 August 1947. Commemorative postage stamps were also issued by the Indian government in 1968 and 1993 respectively to commemorate the 25th and the 50th anniversaries of the establishment of &quot;Azad Hind&quot; at Singapore. The Department of Posts also includes the six unused &quot;Azad Hind&quot; stamps in its commemorative book &quot;India&#x27;s Freedom Struggle through India Postage Stamps&quot;. The &quot;Azad Hind Fauj Marg&quot; (Azad Hind Fauj Road) in New Delhi is named after the INA and houses the Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology.

==In popular culture==

The Indian National Army remains a significant topic of discussion in the popular history of India; it is an emotive topic which has been the subject of numerous works of literature, art, and visual media within India and outside. Some of the earliest works in print media were created at the time of the INA trials. These include works of fiction like &quot;Jai Hind: The Diary of a Rebel Daughter of India&quot; published in 1945 by Amritlal Seth. The book, a work of fiction narrating the story of a recruit of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, is believed to be loosely based on the story of Lakshmi Sahgal. In later decades works by authors like Amitav Ghosh, such as his book &quot;The Glass Palace&quot;, have used the backdrop of the &quot;Azad Hind&quot; and the Japanese occupation of Burma for the narrative of the story. &quot;The Day of the Scorpion&quot; and &quot;The Towers of Silence&quot;, the second and third books in Paul Scott&#x27;s &quot;Raj Quartet&quot;, mention &quot;Jiffs&quot; in the political and social context in which the term found use in the Eastern Army during the war. The 1984 British TV series &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;, based on Scott&#x27;s quartet, also includes the role of the INA as part of the political backdrop of the story.

In visual media, the INA has been the subject of a number of documentaries. &quot;The War of The Springing Tiger&quot; made by Granada Television for Channel 4 in 1984 examined the role of the Indian National Army in the Second World War, the motivation of its soldiers and explored its role in the independence movement.
In 1999 Film India released a documentary, &quot;The Forgotten Army&quot;. Directed by Kabir Khan and produced by Akhil Bakshi, it followed what was called the &quot;Azad Hind Expedition&quot; between 1994 and 1995, retracing the route taken by the INA from Singapore to Imphal, before ending at Red Fort. Amongst the members of the expedition team were Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon, Lakshmi Sahgal and Captain S.S. Yadava, an INA veteran and once the general secretary of the All India INA Committee. The documentary went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at the Film South Asia festival in 1999.
The National Archives of Singapore digitised its available resources in 2007 as &quot;Historical Journey of the Indian National Army&quot;. In 2004, the Indian Legion in Europe was the subject of a BBC magazine article authored by Mike Thomson, but it did not attempt to distinguish the differences between the Legion and the INA. The &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, a large broadsheet in India, dedicates a part of its website to INA resources as &quot;Indian National Army in East Asia.&quot;

Indian cinema has also seen a number of films in many different Indian languages, where the INA is a significant part of the narrative. These include &quot;Pahla Admi&quot; by Bimal Roy and &quot;Samadhi&quot; by Ramesh Saigal, both produced in 1950 based on fictional INA veterans. More recently, &quot;Indian&quot;, a 1996 Tamil film directed by S. Shankar, incorporates a lead character (played by Kamal Hassan) in its story who is a veteran of the INA. Shyam Benegal produced &quot;&quot; in 2004, which traces the last five years of Subhas Chandra Bose. Benegal describes the story of the INA in small details in his film whilst focusing on its leader. The film was also widely noted for A. R. Rahman&#x27;s music. The INA&#x27;s marching song, &quot;Qadam Qadam Badhaye Ja&quot;, has since become a famous patriotic song in India. Today it is in use as the regimental quick march of the Indian Parachute regiment.
More recently, a 2017 Hindi movie Rangoon, starring Kangna Ranaut, Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor is based against the backdrop of the INA presence in Rangoon, with the movie centred around the protagonists trying to get across a jewelled sword to the INA. In 2020 Amazon Prime Video released a five-part series called The Forgotten Army - Azaadi Ke Liye! Which tells the story of the INA through the eyes of one of its Captains and the woman he loves. In 2017 only, a show was released namely, Bose: Dead/Alive, it showed Netaji&#x27;s mysterious disappearance in 1945. In this show too Azad Hind Fauj was shown.

<doc id="173387" wikidata="Q1993735" url="?curid=173387" title="Appeal to tradition">
<text>Appeal to tradition (also known as argumentum ad antiquitatem or argumentum ad antiquitam, appeal to antiquity, or appeal to common practice) is a claim in which a thesis is deemed correct on the basis of correlation with past or present tradition. The appeal takes the form of &quot;this is right because we&#x27;ve always done it this way&quot;, and is a logical fallacy. The opposite of an appeal to tradition is an appeal to novelty, in which one claims that an idea is superior just because it is new. 

An appeal to tradition essentially makes two assumptions that may not be &quot;necessarily&quot; true:

* The old way of thinking was proven correct when introduced, i.e. since the old way of thinking was prevalent, it was necessarily correct. 
:In reality, this may be false—the tradition might be entirely based on incorrect grounds.
* The past justifications for the tradition are still valid. 
:In reality, the circumstances may have changed; this assumption may also therefore have become untrue.

Appeal to tradition imports the value of not needing to reinvent ways to do things for which effective ways have already been established. But, &quot;is fallacious when it confuses a long tradition of careful testing with the mere tendency to hold on to ideas because they are old&quot;.

An appeal to tradition can be complicated by the possibility that different people might have different views, each with their own tradition to appeal to. For example, &quot;Augustine&#x27;s appeal to tradition against the Donatists is more complicated because the Donatists had appealed to tradition against the Catholics&quot;.

== Argument from inertia ==
A close relative/variant of the appeal to tradition is the argument from inertia or appeal to inertia (sometimes called &quot;Stay the Course&quot;), which states a mistaken &quot;status quo&quot;, potentially related to existing customs be maintained for its own sake, usually because making a change would require admission of fault in the mistake or because correcting the mistake would require extraordinary effort and resources

Its name derives from inertia, a concept in physics representing the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity.

==Contrasting fallacies==
* Where appeal to tradition might seek to avoid expending resources and effort on making the necessary change, the sunk-cost fallacy resists change due to that which has already been expended in the past to contribute to the present condition.
* The appeal to tradition counterpoints with the appeal to novelty (&quot;argumentum ad novitatem&quot;), where the alternative is sought simply on the basis that it is new.

<doc id="173388" wikidata="Q10668296" url="?curid=173388" title="Single malt Scotch">
<text>Single malt Scotch refers to single malt whisky made in Scotland. To qualify for this category, a whisky must have been distilled at a single distillery using a pot still distillation process and made from a mash of malted barley. Therefore, a single malt means that the whisky has not been blended elsewhere with whisky from other distilleries. As with any Scotch whisky, a single malt Scotch must be distilled in Scotland and matured in oak casks in Scotland for at least three years, although most single malts are matured longer.

==Definitions==
* &quot;Malt&quot; indicates that the whisky is distilled from &quot;malted&quot; barley. Malting calls for soaking the grains in water for several days until it germinates. Heat is then applied to stop the germination, often using peat as the fuel. Other grains, such as rye or wheat, can be malted for other types of whisky, but barley must be used for single malt Scotch. The dry malt is ground into flour (grist) and mixed with hot water; this mashing process converts the starch into sugar. Later, yeast is added to increase the process of fermentation. Finally, impurities such as methanol are removed during distillation; this also increases the alcohol content.
* &quot;Single&quot; indicates that all the spirits in the bottle come from a single distillery. That distillery may combine single malt whiskies of several ages in a bottle.

Another term is sometimes seen, &quot;double malt Scotch&quot; or &quot;triple malt&quot;. This designation indicates that the whisky was aged in two or three types of casks, but was not blended; hence, it still falls into the single malt category. The more common term for this type of whisky is &quot;double wood&quot; or &quot;triple wood&quot;. Examples include The Balvenie 12 Years Old DoubleWood and Laphroaig Triple Wood.

Many companies use malt whisky purchased from multiple distilleries, and these whiskies combined into &quot;blended malt&quot;.

Until the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 (SWR 2009), the word &quot;blended&quot; only appeared (in the context of Scotch whisky) on bottles of whisky that contained a mixture of both barley and non-barley grain whisky, but this is no longer the case. Under the terminology established by the SWR 2009, the term &quot;blended malt Scotch whisky&quot; replaced the term &quot;vatted malt&quot; to describe a mixture of single malt Scotch whiskies (malted barley whisky).

Only about 10% of the Scotch whiskies on the market are defined as single malt. The other 90% is made by combining numerous whiskies, typically two-thirds grain whisky (non-barley) and one-third malt whisky, from several, or numerous, distilleries in Scotland. The resulting products are labeled &quot;blended Scotch whisky&quot;, without the word &quot;malt&quot;. Nearly 90% of Scotch whisky sold each year is a blended type. Nonetheless, in 2018, single malt Scotch made up nearly 28% by value of the £4.7 billion of whisky exported from Scotland.

For any Scotch whisky, whether malt or blended, the age statement on a bottle refers to the number of years the whisky spent maturing in casks. Very few whiskies are bottled from a single cask. The mixing of spirits with different amounts of ageing is allowed; the age statement of the resulting mix reflects the age of the &quot;youngest&quot; whisky in the bottle.

==History==

Distillation of whisky has been performed in Scotland for centuries. The earliest written record of whisky production in Scotland from malted barley is an entry on the 1494 Exchequer Rolls, which reads &quot;Eight bolls of malt to Friar John Cor, by order of the King, wherewith to make &quot;aqua vitae&quot;.&quot; The expression &#x27;single&#x27; means that of &quot;separate, distinct, not combined or taken together&quot; and is adapted from the old Latin word &quot;singulum&quot; (individual).

In the following centuries, the various governments of Scotland began taxing the production of whisky, to the point that most of the spirit was produced illegally. However, in 1823, Parliament passed the Excise Act making commercial distillation legal and profitable. Punishments were imposed on landowners when unlicensed distilleries were found on their properties. The passing of the act encouraged many distillers to apply for licensees. An Upper Drummin farmer in the Glen Livet valley, George Smith, working under landlord the Duke of Gordon, was the first person in Scotland to take out a licence for a distillery under the new law, founding what would become the Glenlivet Distillery in 1824, making single malt Scotch. Others followed and by 1830, some 232 distilleries had become licensed in Scotland.

In the 1830s, Aeneas Coffey patented a refined version of a design originally created by Robert Stein, based on early innovations by Sir Anthony Perrier, for a column still. This new method produced whisky much more efficiently than the traditional pot stills. The new type of still allowed for continuous distillation, without the need for cleaning after each batch was made. This process made manufacturing more affordable by performing the equivalent of multiple distillation steps. The new still dramatically increased production; the whisky was less intense and smoother, though less flavoursome.

Quickly, merchants began blending the malt whisky with &quot;grain whisky&quot; distilled in the continuous stills, making the first blended Scotch whisky. The blended Scotch proved quite successful, less expensive to produce than malt, and exhibited more flavour and character than grain. The combination allowed the single malt producers to expand their operations, or to sell their products to other distillers who were making the blended products. After the 1850s, blended Scotch became far more popular than single malt whisky which eventually became a niche product for connoisseurs.

By the Victorian era, distilleries had become commonplace across Scotland. A common feature in design originating from Charles C. Doig was that of a pagoda like roof that improved the efficiency of distilleries by drawing off peat smoke in the malting process. Even today many distilleries possess a pagoda style roof on at least one building even if no malting takes place and in some instances, new pagoda roofs are added for aesthetic purposes. However, while whisky production was widespread in Scotland, the number of single malts was comparatively limited until the late 20th century. It was noted that in 1967, of 110 distilleries only 30 allowed the public to buy their whisky as a single malt. However, by the 1990s, changing demand had resulted in most distilleries offering a single malt to customers.

A 2016 report stated that only 20% of the Scotch whisky was made by companies owned in Scotland. The owners of the majority of products are Diageo, a London-based company, Pernod Ricard of France and Suntory Global Spirits, a Japanese-owned company. Independent distilleries owned by Scots companies make a substantial amount of whisky too, particularly William Grant &amp; Sons, the largest of these. Grant produces 8% of all Scotch whisky, with brands including Glenfiddich and Balvenie. Glenfiddich is the best-selling single malt Scotch in the world; roughly 14 million bottles are sold annually.

In recent times, single malt has made up about 26% of the whisky exported to other countries; bulk spirits constituted about 5% and the balance has been blended whisky. The top importers of Scotch whisky are the US (21%), France (11%) and Singapore (6%).

===Economic benefits===
The Scotch Whisky Association estimated in 2019 that Scotland&#x27;s whisky industry supported 40,000 jobs. The industry&#x27;s contribution to the economy of the UK was estimated as £5.5 billion in 2018; the industry provided £3.8 billion in direct GVA (gross value added) to Scotland. Whisky tourism has also become significant and accounts for £68.3 million per year. 

One factor may have negatively affected sales, an extra 3.9% duty on spirits imposed by the UK in 2017. By 2020, another factor may affect exports: the 25% increase in tariffs imposed by the U.S. in October 2019. By year-end 2017, however, exports totaled a record-breaking £4.37 billion, an increase of 8.9% over 2016. Of that total, single malt Scotch accounted for £1.17 billion in exports, a 14% increase over 2016.

Exports in 2018 again increased, by 7.8% by value, and 3.6% in number of bottles, in spite of the duty imposed in 2017; exports grew to a record level, £4.7 billion. The US tariffs were not yet in place at that time, however. Of the total exports in 2018, single malt accounted for £1.3 billion.

Whisky tourism has also become significant and accounts for £68.3 million per year; the percentage contribution to this industry by single malt Scotch distilleries, however, has not been released. The tourism has been a real plus to the economy, and of significant value especially in remote rural areas, according to Fiona Hyslop MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs. &quot;The Scottish Government is committed to working with partners like the Scotch Whisky Association to increase our tourism offer and encourage more people to visit our distilleries,&quot; the Secretary added.

== Regions ==

Flavour, aroma, and finish differ widely between single malts. Single malt Scotch whiskies are categorised into the following whisky-producing regions: Campbeltown single malts, Highland single malts, Island single malts (a sub-section of the Highland region), Islay single malts, Lowland single malts, and Speyside single malts

==Independent bottlers==
Independent bottlers buy casks of single malts and either bottle them immediately or store them for future use. Many of the independents began as stores and merchants who bought the whisky in bulk and bottled it for individual sales. Many distilleries do not bottle their whisky as a single malt, so independent bottlings are the only way the single malt gets to market. The bottling process is generally the same, but independents generally do not have access to the distillery&#x27;s water source, so another source is used to dilute the whisky. Additionally, independents are generally less concerned with maintaining a particular style, so more single year and single cask bottlings are produced.

Established independent bottlers include Duncan Taylor, Murray McDavid, Douglas Laing &amp; Co, and Blackadder.

<doc id="173394" wikidata="Q101539" url="?curid=173394" title="Flight attendant">
<text>A flight attendant is a member of the aircrew whose primary responsibility is ensure the safety of passengers in the cabin of an aircraft across all stages of flight. Their secondary duty is to see to the comfort of passengers. Flight attendants are also known as a steward () or stewardess (), or air host () or air hostess () and are collectively referred to as cabin crew.

== History ==
The role of a flight attendant derives from that of similar positions on passenger ships or passenger trains, but has more direct involvement with passengers because of the confined quarters on aircraft. Additionally, the job of a flight attendant revolves around safety to a much greater extent than those of similar staff on other forms of transportation. Flight attendants on board a flight collectively form a &quot;cabin crew&quot;, as distinguished from pilots and engineers in the cockpit.

The German Heinrich Kubis was the world&#x27;s first flight attendant, in 1912 aboard a Zeppelin. Kubis first attended to the passengers on board the DELAG Zeppelin LZ 10 &quot;Schwaben&quot;. He also attended to the famous LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot; and was on board when it burst into flames. He survived by jumping out a window when it neared the ground.

Origins of the word &quot;steward&quot; in transportation are reflected in the term &quot;chief steward&quot; as used in maritime transport terminology. The term purser and chief steward are often used interchangeably describing personnel with similar duties among seafaring occupations. This lingual derivation results from the international British maritime tradition (i.e. chief mate) dating back to the 14th century and the civilian United States Merchant Marine on which U.S. aviation is somewhat modelled. Due to international law, conventions and agreements, in which all ships&#x27; personnel who sail internationally are similarly documented, see Merchant Mariner&#x27;s Document, by their respective countries, the U.S. Merchant Marine assigns such duties to the chief steward in the overall rank and command structure of which pursers are not positionally represented or rostered.

Imperial Airways of the United Kingdom had &quot;cabin boys&quot; or &quot;stewards&quot;; in the 1920s. In the US, Stout Airways was the first to employ stewards in 1926, working on Ford Trimotor planes between Detroit and Grand Rapids, Michigan. Western Airlines (1928) and Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) (1929) were the first US carriers to employ stewards to serve food. Ten-passenger Fokker aircraft used in the Caribbean had stewards in the era of gambling trips to Havana, Cuba from Key West, Florida. Lead flight attendants would in many instances also perform the role of purser, steward, or chief steward in modern aviation terminology.

The first female flight attendant was a 25-year-old registered nurse named Ellen Church. Hired by United Airlines in 1930, she also first envisioned nurses on aircraft. Other airlines followed suit, hiring nurses to serve as flight attendants, then called &quot;stewardesses&quot; or &quot;air hostesses&quot;, on most of their flights. In the United States, the job was one of only a few in the 1930s to permit women, which, coupled with the Great Depression, led to large numbers of applicants for the few positions available. Two thousand women applied for just 43 positions offered by Transcontinental and Western Airlines in December 1935.

Female flight attendants rapidly replaced male ones, and by 1936, they had all but taken over the role. They were selected not only for their knowledge but also for their physical characteristics. A 1936 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the requirements:

Three decades later, a 1966 &quot;New York Times&quot; classified ad for stewardesses at Eastern Airlines listed these requirements:

Appearance was considered one of the most important factors to become a stewardess. At that time, airlines believed that the exploitation of female sexuality would increase their profits; thus the uniforms of female flight attendants were often formfitting, complete with white gloves and high heels.

In the United States, they were required to be unmarried and were fired if they decided to marry. The requirement to be a registered nurse on an American airline was relaxed as more women were hired, and disappeared almost entirely during World War II as many nurses joined military nurse corps.

Ruth Carol Taylor was the first African-American flight attendant in the United States. Hired in December 1957, on 11 February 1958, Taylor was the flight attendant on a Mohawk Airlines flight from Ithaca to New York, the first time such a position had been held by an African American. She was let go within six months as a result of Mohawk&#x27;s then-common marriage ban. Patricia Banks Edmiston became the first black flight attendant for Capitol Airlines in 1960 following a legal complaint which resulted in the airline being required to hire her.

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&#x27;s (EEOC) first complainants were female flight attendants complaining of age discrimination, weight requirements, and bans on marriage. (Originally female flight attendants were fired if they reached age 32 or 35 depending on the airline, were fired if they exceeded weight regulations, and were required to be single upon hiring and fired if they got married.) In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants&#x27; employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Also in 1968, the EEOC ruled that sex was not a bona fide occupational requirement to be a flight attendant. The restriction of hiring only women was lifted at all airlines in 1971 due to the decisive court case of &quot;Diaz v. Pan Am&quot;. The Airline Deregulation Act was passed in 1978, and the no-marriage rule was eliminated throughout the US airline industry by the 1980s. The last such broad categorical discrimination, the weight restrictions, were relaxed in the 1990s through litigation and negotiations. Airlines still often have vision and height requirements and may require flight attendants to pass a medical evaluation.

==Overview==
The role of a flight attendant is to &quot;provide routine services and respond to emergencies to ensure the safety and comfort of airline passengers&quot;.

Typically flight attendants require holding a high school diploma or equivalent, and in the United States, the median annual wage for flight attendants was $50,500 in May 2017, higher than the median for all workers of $37,690.

The number of flight attendants required on flights is mandated by each country&#x27;s regulations. In the U.S., for light planes with 19 or fewer seats, or, if weighing more than , 9 or fewer seats, no flight attendant is needed; on larger aircraft, one flight attendant per 50 passenger seats is required.

The majority of flight attendants for most airlines are female, though a substantial number of males have entered the industry since 1980.

===Responsibilities===

Prior to each flight, flight attendants and pilots go over safety and emergency checklists, the locations of emergency equipment and other features specific to that aircraft type. Boarding particulars are verified, such as special needs passengers, small children travelling alone, or VIPs. Weather conditions are discussed including anticipated turbulence. A safety check is conducted to ensure equipment such as life-vests, torches (flash lights) and firefighting equipment are on board and in proper condition. They monitor the cabin for any unusual smells or situations. They assist with the loading of carry-on baggage, checking for weight, size and dangerous goods. They make sure those sitting in emergency exit rows are willing and able to assist in an evacuation. They then give a safety demonstration or monitor passengers as they watch a safety video. They then must &quot;secure the cabin&quot; ensuring tray tables are stowed, seats are in their upright positions, armrests down and carry-ons stowed correctly and seat belts are fastened prior to take-off.
Once up in the air, flight attendants will usually serve drinks and/or food to passengers using an airline service trolley. The duty has led to the mildly derogatory slang term &quot;trolley dolly&quot;. When not performing customer service duties, flight attendants must periodically conduct cabin checks and listen for any unusual noises or situations. Checks must also be done on the lavatory to ensure the smoke detector has not been disabled or destroyed and to restock supplies as needed. Regular cockpit checks must be done to ensure the health and safety of the pilot(s). They must also respond to call lights dealing with special requests. During turbulence, flight attendants must ensure the cabin is secure. Prior to landing, all loose items, trays and rubbish must be collected and secured along with service and galley equipment. All hot liquids must be disposed of. A final cabin check must then be completed prior to landing. It is vital that flight attendants remain aware as the majority of emergencies occur during take-off and landing. Upon landing, flight attendants must remain stationed at exits and monitor the aircraft and cabin as passengers disembark the plane. They also assist any special needs passengers and small children off the aeroplane and escort children, while following the proper paperwork and ID process to escort them to the designated person picking them up.

Flight attendants are trained to deal with a wide variety of emergencies, and are trained in first aid. More frequent situations may include a bleeding nose, illness, small injuries, intoxicated passengers, aggressive and anxiety stricken passengers. Emergency training includes rejected take-offs, emergency landings, cardiac and in-flight medical situations, smoke in the cabin, fires, depressurisation, on-board births and deaths, dangerous goods and spills in the cabin, emergency evacuations, hijackings, and water landings. 

====Cabin chimes and overhead panel lights====
On most commercial airliners, flight attendants receive various forms of notification on board the aircraft in the form of audible chimes and coloured lights above their stations. While the colours and chimes are not universal and may vary between airlines and aircraft types, these colours and chimes are generally the most commonly used:

* &#x27; (Boeing) or &#x27; (Airbus): interphone calls from the cockpit to a flight attendant and/or interphone calls between two flight attendants, the latter case if a green light is not present or being used for the same purpose (steady with high-low chime), or all services emergency call (flashing with repeated high-low chime). On some airlines Airbus&#x27; aircraft (such as Delta Air Lines), this light is accompanied by a high-medium-low chime to call the purser. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner uses a separate red light to indicate a sterile flight deck while using pink for interphone calls from the cockpit.
* : call from passenger in seat (steady with single high chime).
* : call from passenger in lavatory (steady with single high chime), or lavatory smoke detector set off (flashing with repeated high chime).
* : on some aircraft (some airlines Airbus aircraft, and the Boeing 787), this colour is used to indicate interphone calls between two flight attendants, distinguishing them from the pink or red light used for interphone calls made from the flight deck to a flight attendant, and is also accompanied with a high-low chime like the pink or red light. On the Boeing 787, a flashing green light with a repeated high-low chime is used to indicate a call to all flight attendant stations.

===Chief purser===
The chief purser (CP), also titled as in-flight service manager (ISM), flight service manager (FSM), customer service manager (CSM) or cabin service director (CSD) is the senior flight attendant in the chain of command of flight attendants. While not necessarily the most-senior crew members on a flight (in years of service to their respective carrier), chief pursers can have varying levels of &quot;in-flight&quot; or &quot;on board&quot; bidding seniority or tenure in relation to their flying partners. To reach this position, a crew member requires some minimum years of service as flight attendant. Further training is mandatory, and chief pursers typically earn a higher salary than flight attendants because of the added responsibility and managerial role.

===Purser===

The purser is in charge of the cabin crew, in a specific section of a larger aircraft, or the whole aircraft itself (if the purser is the highest ranking). On board a larger aircraft, pursers assist the chief purser in managing the cabin. Pursers are flight attendants or a related job, typically with an airline for several years prior to application for, and further training to become a purser, and normally earn a higher salary than flight attendants because of the added responsibility and supervisory role.

==Qualifications==
===Training===
Minimum entry requirements for a career as a flight attendant is usually the completion of the final year of high school; e.g. the International Baccalaureate. Many prospective attendants have a post-secondary school diploma in an area such as tourism and a number hold degrees having worked in other occupations, often as teachers. Graduates holding degrees, including those with studies in one or more foreign languages, communication studies, business studies, public relations or nursing can be favoured by employers.

Flight attendants are normally trained in the hub or headquarters city of an airline over a period that may run from four weeks to six months, depending on the country and airline. The main focus of training is safety, and attendants are evaluated for each type of aircraft in which they work. One of the most elaborate training facilities was Breech Academy, which Trans World Airlines (TWA) opened in 1969 in Overland Park, Kansas. Other airlines also sent their attendants to the school. However, during the fare wars, the school&#x27;s viability declined and it closed around 1988.

Safety training includes, but is not limited to: emergency passenger evacuation management, use of evacuation slides / life rafts, in-flight firefighting, first aid, CPR, defibrillation, ditching/emergency landing procedures, decompression emergencies, crew resource management, and security.

In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration requires flight attendants on aircraft with 20 or more seats and used by an air carrier for transportation to hold a &quot;Certificate of Demonstrated Proficiency&quot;. It shows that a level of required training has been met. It is not limited to the air carrier at which the attendant is employed (although some initial documents showed the airlines where the holders were working), and is the attendant&#x27;s personal property. It does have two ratings, Group 1 and Group 2 (listed on the certificate as &quot;Group I&quot; and &quot;Group II&quot;). Either or both of these may be earned depending upon the general type of aircraft, (propeller or turbojet), on which the holder has trained.

There are also training schools, not affiliated with any particular airline, where students generally not only undergo generic, though otherwise practically identical, training to flight attendants employed by an airline, but also take curriculum modules to help them gain employment. These schools often use actual airline equipment for their lessons, though some are equipped with full simulator cabins capable of replicating a number of emergency situations. In some countries, such as France, a degree is required, together with the &quot;Certificat de formation à la sécurité&quot; (Safety training certificate).

===Language===
Multilingual flight attendants are often in demand to accommodate international travellers. The languages most in demand, other than English, are French, Russian, Hindi, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Bengali, Japanese, Arabic, German, Portuguese, Italian, and Turkish. In the United States, airlines with international routes pay an additional stipend for language skills on top of flight pay, and some airlines hire specifically for certain languages when launching international destinations. Carole Middleton recalled when interviewed in 2018 that &quot;you had to be able to speak another language&quot; when working in the industry in the 1970s.

===Height===
Most airlines have height requirements for safety reasons, making sure that all flight attendants can reach overhead safety equipment. Typically, the acceptable height for this is over but under tall. Regional carriers using small aircraft with low ceilings can have height restrictions.
Some airlines, such as EVA Air, have height requirements for purely aesthetic purposes.

==Presentation==
The overall presentation of flight attendants&#x27; has transformed over the decades. Many early uniforms had a strongly military appearance; hats, jackets, and skirts showed simple straight lines and military details like epaulettes and brass buttons. Many uniforms had a summer and winter version, differentiated by colours and fabrics appropriate to the season: navy blue for winter, for example, khaki for summer. But as the role of women in the air grew, and airline companies began to realise the publicity value of their female flight attendants, more feminine lines and colours began to appear in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Some airlines began to commission designs from high-end department stores and still others called in noted designers or even milliners to create distinctive and attractive apparel. During the 1960s, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) was known for brightly coloured female flight attendant uniforms that included short miniskirts. In the early 1970s, the uniform changed to hotpants.

===Haute couture===
In the 1930s, the first flight attendant uniforms were designed to be durable, practical, and inspire confidence in passengers with the first female flight attendants dressing in uniforms resembling nurses&#x27; outfits. The first female flight attendants for United Airlines wore green berets, green capes and nurse&#x27;s shoes and other airlines, such as Eastern Air Lines, actually dressed female flight attendants in nurses&#x27; uniforms. However, by the 1960s a number of airlines were promoting their flight attendant&#x27;s uniforms as evoking the refinement of &quot;haute couture&quot;. In March 1962, Air France launched a new model designed by Marc Bohan at Dior, introducing the &quot;Air France&quot; model into its Haute couture collection. Hainan Airlines debuted their new flight attendant&#x27;s uniforms at the 2017 Laurence Xu Haute Couture Show at Paris Couture Week.

Since the 1980s, Asian airlines, especially national flag carriers, usually feature the traditional dress and fabrics of their respective country in their female flight attendants&#x27; uniform. It was meant as a marketing strategy to showcase their national culture as well as to convey welcoming warmth and hospitality. For example, Thai Airways flight attendants are required to change from their corporate purple suits into traditional Thai costume prior to passengers boarding. Garuda Indonesia, Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines female flight attendants wear modified kebayas, with batik motifs on them. For example, Garuda Indonesia&#x27;s design, called &#x27;Lereng Garuda Indonesia&#x27; is inspired by the traditional batik motif of &#x27;Parang Gondosuli&#x27;. Vietnam Airlines flight attendants wear red áo dài and Air India flight attendants wear a sari on all passenger flights.

===Uniform and makeup===
During the mid-1990s, several U.S.-based airlines required female flight attendants to wear shoes with heels. Minimum heel heights ranged from mandated by US Airways. Flight attendants at times avoided censure by changing into more comfortable shoes during flights, since their supervisors were less likely to be present there.

In 2015, the Israeli airline El Al introduced a requirement that female flight attendants wear high heels until passengers had been seated. The airline&#x27;s workers&#x27; union stated that the requirement would endanger the health and safety of the flight attendants and instructed its members to ignore the rule. Later that year the requirement was removed.

Until 2016, some female crew members on British Airways were required to wear British Airways&#x27; standard &quot;ambassador&quot; uniform, which has not traditionally included trousers.

In 2019, Virgin Atlantic began to allow its female flight attendants to wear trousers and not wear makeup.

In 2023, Qantas declared that it had ended uniform rules based on gender. Female flight attendants are no longer required to wear high heels, male flight attendants can wear makeup, and flight attendants of any gender can wear the same type of jewellery and have long hair in a ponytail or bun.

== Health conditions ==
A 2018 study found higher instances of melanoma, breast, uterine, gastrointestinal, cervical, and thyroid cancers reported in flight attendants in contrast to the general population. Specifically, the increased cancer cases reported were seen in breast cancer (3.4% of flight crew compared to 2.3% in the general population - a 50% increase), cervical cancer (1.0% compared to 0.70%), gastrointestinal cancer (0.47% compared to 0.27% – a 74% increase), thyroid cancer (0.67% compared to 0.56%) and higher rates of both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers with reports of the latter increasing with every five years spent in the job. The study did not look into what causes this increase, but the authors said increased exposure to ionizing radiation from time spent in the thinner upper atmosphere, poor cabin air quality as well as disrupted sleep and meal cycles could be factors.

Other studies have found increased rates of breast and skin cancer, reduced respiratory health, adverse reproductive and perinatal outcomes, musculoskeletal injuries, and higher rates of mental health conditions in flight attendants.

=== Radiation ===
Flight attendants and crew members are known to be exposed to cosmic ionizing radiation which is a form of radiation that comes from space and intensifies as altitude above sea level increases. The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization lists ionizing radiation as a known human carcinogen. Passengers are also exposed to this type of cosmic radiation, but they spend considerably less time on average in the air than crew members. An online travel agency report found, in particular, that travelling adults in Britain spend on average 306 hours on flights to holiday destinations during their lifetime. In contrast, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration, a flight attendant can spend up to 30 hours of flight time in seven consecutive days and in some cases more. The effect of cosmic radiation on air crew members is a subject of a growing body of research.

Cabin crew members are also regularly exposed to more UV radiation than the general population, which can make these workers more vulnerable to skin cancers.

The U.S. National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP) reports that aircrew have the largest average annual effective dose of all U.S. radiation workers.

=== Cabin air quality ===
Poor cabin air quality is a subject of ongoing study in relation to symptoms such as headache, fatigue, fever, and respiratory difficulties among many others that have been reported by flight attendants, particularly on long-haul routes. There is also much concern regarding the transmission of contagious diseases, particularly tuberculosis. An open question remains whether these complaints are due to poor cabin air quality or to other factors inherent in flights, such as lowered barometric pressure, hypoxia, low humidity, etc. Other chemical contaminants found in the cabin may include engine leakages, pesticides and flame retardants, which contain compounds that may act as hormone disruptors and increase the risk of some cancers.

=== Sleep disruption ===
Flight attendants often have disrupted sleep cycles. They are more likely to have disruptions in their sleep patterns because they may work at night, cross time zones, and have irregular schedules. There is some evidence linking sleep disruptions to increased cancer risk. Flight attendants may also have different lifestyle behaviours related to diet, physical activity, and health care than the general population which could affect overall health and cancer risk.

=== Secondhand tobacco smoke ===
Many of the flight attendants working today were exposed to second-hand in-flight smoke until 1998 with partial smoking bans enacted in 1988. The long-term effects of this historical secondhand smoke exposure have not been well characterized.

== Sexual harassment ==
Flight attendants are exposed to verbal and sexual harassment. Studies in the United States and Australia have found that the vast majority (two-thirds) of flight attendants experience sexual harassment in the course of their careers, including sexual assault, inappropriate touching and sexual comments both by colleagues and passengers.

The studies also found that 70% of flight attendants who experience sexual harassment on the job &quot;chose not to report the incident because they did not think it would be dealt with appropriately or they were concerned reporting it would make the situation worse&quot; and &quot;their airline was not doing enough to put a stop to harassment&quot;, and that &quot;they have not noticed any employer efforts over the past year to address sexual harassment at work.&quot;

== Emotional labour ==
The concept of emotional labour as the process of managing feelings and expressions to fulfil the emotional requirements of a job through a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace (as opposed to the concept of emotion work, i.e. the management of one&#x27;s feelings in private life) was first established and linked to the profession of flight attendants by Professor Emerita of Sociology Arlie Hochschild, in her book, &quot;The Managed Heart&quot;. According to Hochschild, flight attendants do emotional labour to enhance the status of the customer and entice further sales by their friendliness, and support this effort by evoking feelings that make the &quot;nice&quot; display seem natural. With regard to how flight attendants are supposed to use their smile in the job, the author writes:

Hochschild notes that corporate logic in the airline industry generates a series of links between competition, market expansion, advertising, heightened passenger expectations about rights to display, and company demands for acting; and when conditions allow this logic to work, private use of emotional exchange gives way to corporate use of emotional exchange.

Hochschild also writes of how flight attendants are trained to control passengers&#x27; feelings during times of turbulence and dangerous situations while suppressing their own fear or anxiety.

The emotional labour performed by flight attendants and cross-cultural aspects of it have since been actively studied and are a topic of ongoing research.

==Sponsorship and advertising==

In the 1960s and 1970s, many airlines began advertising the attractiveness and friendliness of their flight attendants. National Airlines began a &quot;Fly Me&quot;; campaign using attractive female flight attendants with taglines such as &quot;I&#x27;m Lorraine. Fly me to Orlando.&quot; Braniff International Airways presented a campaign known as the &quot;Air Strip&quot; with similarly attractive young female flight attendant changing uniforms mid-flight. In the United States, many airlines had a policy such that only unmarried women could be flight attendants, as well as a mandatory retirement age of 32 for flight attendants because of the belief women would be less appealing and attractive after this age. Many of the women were recruited as seniors in college and in beauty pageants.

In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants&#x27; employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Emirates have long sponsored international sporting events and employ their flight attendants to present awards at Wimbledon and other events.

==Unions==
Flight attendant unions were formed, beginning at United Airlines in the 1940s, to negotiate improvements in pay, benefits and working conditions. Those unions would later challenge what they perceived as sexist stereotypes and unfair work practices such as age limits, size limits, limitations on marriage, and prohibition of pregnancy. Many of these limitations have been lifted by judicial mandates. The largest flight attendants&#x27; union is the Association of Flight Attendants, representing nearly 60,000 flight attendants at 19 airlines within the US.

The Association of Professional Flight Attendants represents the flight attendants of American Airlines, the world&#x27;s largest carrier. APFA is the largest independent flight attendant union in the world.

In the UK, cabin crew can be represented by either Cabin Crew &#x27;89, or the much larger and more powerful Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union.

In Australia, flight attendants are represented by the Flight Attendants&#x27; Association of Australia (FAAA). There are two divisions: one for international crews (long-haul) and one for domestic crews (short-haul).

In New Zealand, flight attendants can be represented by either the Flight Attendants and Related Services Association (FARSA) or by the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union (EPMU).

In Canada, flight attendants are represented by either the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) or by the Canadian Flight Attendants Union (CFAU).

===Discrimination===
Originally female flight attendants were required to be single upon hiring, and were fired if they got married, exceeded weight regulations, or reached age 32 or 35 depending on the airline. In the 1970s, the group Stewardesses for Women&#x27;s Rights protested sexist advertising and company discrimination, and brought many cases to court. In 1964, United States President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law which prohibited sex discrimination and led to the creation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1968. The EEOC ruled that sex was not a bona fide occupational requirement to be a flight attendant. For flight attendants, this meant that they had an official governing body to report offences to and allowed them to successfully challenge age ceiling and marriage bans in relation to their effectiveness as employees.

In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants&#x27; employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The restriction of hiring only women was lifted at all airlines in 1971 due to the decisive court case of &quot;Diaz v. Pan Am&quot;. The no-marriage rule was eliminated throughout the US airline industry by the 1980s. The last such broad categorical discrimination, the weight restrictions, were relaxed in the 1990s through litigation and negotiations. By the end of the 1970s, the term &quot;stewardess&quot; had generally been replaced by the gender-neutral alternative &quot;flight attendant&quot;. Also, during the 1980s and 1990s, more men were allowed to apply as flight attendants, helping to create more usage of this term. More recently the term &quot;cabin crew&quot; or &quot;cabin staff&quot; has begun to replace &#x27;flight attendants&#x27; in some parts of the world, because of the term&#x27;s recognition of their role as members of the crew.

==Roles in emergencies==
Actions of flight attendants in emergencies have long been credited in saving lives; in the United States, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and other aviation authorities view flight attendants as essential for safety, and are thus usually required on Part 121 aircraft operations. Studies, some done in light of the 1985 Manchester Airport disaster (British Airtours Flight 28M), have concluded that assertive cabin crew are essential for the rapid evacuation of aeroplanes. Notable examples of cabin crew actions include:

===11 September 2001===
The role of flight attendants received heightened prominence after the September 11 attacks when flight attendants (such as Sandra W. Bradshaw and CeeCee Lyles of United Airlines Flight 93; Robert Fangman of United Airlines Flight 175; Renee May of American Airlines Flight 77; and Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney of American Airlines Flight 11) actively attempted to protect passengers from assault, and also provided vital information to air traffic controllers on the hijackings, as did many passengers.

In the wake of these attacks, many flight attendants at major airlines were laid off because of decreased passenger loads.

===Other emergencies===

* In April 1936, flight attendant Nellie Granger aided survivors after the crash of TWA Flight 1, then walked through a snowstorm to find help, before returning to the crash scene.
* Senior Purser Neerja Bhanot saved the lives of passengers and crew when Pan Am Flight 73 was hijacked. She was killed while protecting children from the terrorists. After her death she received the Special Courage Award from the United States Department of Justice and India&#x27;s highest civilian honour for bravery, the Ashoka Chakra.
* Naila Nazir, Pakistani flight attendant (employee of Pakistan International Airlines) who received 1985&#x27;s Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) Heroism Award for her brave handling of tense and dangerous situation during the 13 days of the Flight PK-326 hijacking ordeal.
* 1985 Manchester Airport disaster (British Airtours Flight 28M), the two forward flight attendants, Arthur Bradbury and Joanna Toff, repeatedly crawled into the smoke filled and burning cabin to drag a number of passengers to safety, and were subsequently awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal. The two rear flight attendants, Sharon Ford and Jacqui Ubanski, who opened the rear doors but were overwhelmed by fire and smoke were awarded the same medal posthumously.
* Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 751, when cabin crew recognised an emergency landing was imminent and commanded the passengers to &quot;bend down ... hold your knees&quot; to adopt the brace position.
* Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529, whose sole flight attendant, Robin Fech, provided emergency briefings, brace and evacuation commands to the passengers when the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia aircraft sustained serious damage to one of its engines and crash landed. The NTSB accident report commended &quot;the exemplary manner in which the flight attendant briefed the passengers and handled the emergency&quot;.
* BOAC Flight 712, where a flight attendant, Barbara Jane Harrison, died saving passengers from an on-board fire and was posthumously awarded the George Cross.
* British Airways Flight 5390, in which a flight attendant was able to prevent a pilot from being lost through a cockpit window that had failed.
* Southern Airways Flight 242, on which the cabin crew provided safety briefings to their passengers, and on their own initiative, warned passengers of the impending crash by commanding passengers to adopt the brace position. At least one flight attendant is known to have assisted in rescuing trapped passengers.
* Air Florida Flight 90, in which Kelly Duncan, the lone surviving flight attendant, passed the only life vest she could find to a passenger. She is recognised in the NTSB report for this &quot;unselfish act&quot;.
* TWA flight attendant Uli Derickson who protected passengers during the TWA Flight 847 hijacking by assisting with negotiation efforts.
* TWA Flight 843, when a TWA Lockheed L-1011 Tristar aircraft crashed after an aborted takeoff in 1992. The aircraft was destroyed by fire. Nine flight attendants, along with five off-duty flight attendants, evacuated all 292 persons on board without loss of life. The NTSB in their after accident report noted, &quot;The performance of the flight attendants during the emergency was exceptional and probably contributed to the success of the emergency evacuation.&quot;
* On British Airways Flight 2069, cabin crew stopped the plane from being crashed by a mentally ill passenger.
* Crew on American Airlines Flight 63 prevented shoe bomber Richard Reid from blowing up the plane.
* Flight attendants on QantasLink Flight 1737 prevented their plane from being hijacked by a passenger with mental health issues. Two of them were taken to hospital with stab wounds.
* Aloha Airlines Flight 243 suffered a decompression which tore an section of fuselage away from the plane. The only fatality was flight attendant C.B. Lansing who was blown out of the aeroplane. Flight attendant Michelle Honda was thrown violently to the floor during the decompression but, despite her injuries, crawled up and down the aisle reassuring passengers.
* Flight attendants on Air Canada Flight 797 (Sergio Benetti, Judi Davidson, Laura Kayama) used procedures which were not specifically taught in training such as moving passengers to the front of the aircraft to move them away from the fire and smoke, and passing out towels for passengers to cover their nose and mouths with while the cabin was filling with smoke. Chief Flight Attendant Sergio Benetti was the first to open the front door of the aircraft, and escaped out that way, leaving all passengers and other crew behind.
* US Airways flight attendant Richard DeMary helped to evacuate surviving passengers and another crew member from the burning wreckage of USAir Flight 1016, which crashed during a go-around in adverse weather conditions after a failed landing attempt at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.
* Flight attendants on US Airways Flight 1549 successfully evacuated all passengers from the aircraft within 90 seconds even though the rear was rapidly filling with water.
* Nine cabin crew members aboard Air France Flight 358 successfully evacuated the aircraft within 90 seconds after the A340-300 overran a runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport. The NTSB stated that the actions of the cabin crew contributed to the 100% survival rate.
* The flight attendants of Philippine Airlines Flight 434 kept the passengers calm after a bomb exploded during the flight from Cebu to Tokyo. Though one passenger was killed during the explosion, they took care of the injured passengers.
* Paul Hayes, the director of air safety at Ascend, a British-based aviation consultancy, told Reuters, &quot;The cabin crew (of Japan Airlines Flight 516) must have done an excellent job. It was a miracle that all the passengers got off considering the wreckage shown in many images.

One exception was the accident on Air Canada Flight 797, when the investigative board found that &quot;misleading&quot; reports about the fire by the flight attendant in charge &quot;influenced the captain&#x27;s decision to delay the initiation of a descent&quot;, and that such &quot;delay increased the time for the fire to propagate and the time that passengers were exposed to the toxic environment before the aeroplane could be evacuated&quot;. The accident killed 23 passengers; none of the flight attendants sustained any injuries. Chief Flight Attendant Sergio Benetti was the first to open the front door of the aircraft, and escaped that way, leaving all passengers and other crew behind.

<text>The Elgin Marbles ( ) are a collection of Ancient Greek sculptures from the Parthenon and other structures from the Acropolis of Athens, removed from Ottoman Greece and shipped to Britain by agents of Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, and now held in the British Museum in London. The majority of the sculptures were created in the 5th century BC under the direction of sculptor and architect Phidias.

The term &quot;Parthenon Marbles&quot; or &quot;Parthenon Sculptures&quot; () refers to sculptures—the frieze, metopes and pediments—from the Parthenon held in various collections, principally the British Museum and the Acropolis Museum in Athens.

From 1801 to 1812, Elgin&#x27;s agents removed about half the surviving Parthenon sculptures, as well as sculptures from the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike and the Propylaia, sending them to Britain in efforts to establish a private museum. Elgin stated he removed the sculptures with permission of the Ottoman officials who exercised authority in Athens at the time. The legality of Elgin&#x27;s actions has been disputed.

Their presence in the British Museum is the subject of longstanding international controversy. In Britain, the acquisition of the collection was supported by some, while others, such as Lord Byron, likened Elgin&#x27;s actions to vandalism or looting. A UK parliamentary inquiry in 1816 concluded that Elgin had acquired the marbles legally. Elgin sold them to the British government in that year, after which they passed into the trusteeship of the British Museum. In 1983, the Greek government formally asked the UK government to return them to Greece, and listed the dispute with UNESCO. The UK government and British Museum declined UNESCO&#x27;s offer of mediation. In 2021, UNESCO called upon the UK government to resolve the issue at the intergovernmental level.

The Greek government and supporters of the marbles&#x27; return to Greece have argued that they were obtained illegally or unethically, that they are of exceptional cultural importance to Greece, and that their cultural value would be best appreciated in a unified public display with the other major Parthenon antiquities in the Acropolis Museum. The UK government and British Museum have argued that they were obtained legally, that their return would set a precedent which could undermine the collections of the major museums of world culture, and that the British Museum&#x27;s collection allows them to be better viewed in the context of other major ancient cultures and thus complements the perspective provided by the Acropolis Museum. Discussions between UK and Greek officials are ongoing.

==Name==
The Elgin Marbles are named after the 7th Earl of Elgin, who, between 1801 and 1812, oversaw their removal from the Parthenon, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike and the Propylaia and their shipment to England. By an act of parliament, the British Museum Act 1816, the collection was transferred to the British Museum on the condition that it be kept together and named &quot;the Elgin Marbles&quot;. The term &quot;Parthenon Marbles&quot; or &quot;Parthenon Sculptures&quot; refers to the sculptures and architectural features removed specifically from the Parthenon. These are currently held in seven museums around the world, principally the Acropolis Museum and the British Museum. The term &quot;Parthenon Sculptures&quot; is used in this sense by both the British Museum and the Greek government.

Mario Trabucco della Torretta argues that partisans of retention often prefer the term &quot;Elgin Marbles&quot; and those advocating restitution prefer &quot;Parthenon Sculptures&quot; or &quot;Parthenon Marbles&quot;.

==Background==
The Parthenon was built on the Acropolis of Athens from 447 BCE as a temple to the goddess Athena. It is likely that Phidias was responsible for the sculptural design. In subsequent centuries the building was converted into a church and a mosque and the sculptures were extensively damaged, although the building remained structurally sound. During the Sixth Ottoman–Venetian War (1684–1699), the defending Turks fortified the Acropolis and used the Parthenon as a gunpowder store. On 26 September 1687, a Venetian artillery round ignited the gunpowder, and the resulting explosion blew out the central portion of the Parthenon and caused the cella&#x27;s walls to crumble into rubble. Three of the four walls collapsed, or nearly so, and about three-fifths of the sculptures from the frieze fell. About 300 people were killed in the explosion, which showered marble fragments over a significant area. For the next century and a half, portions of the remaining structure were scavenged for building material and many valuable objects were removed.

==Acquisition==
In November 1798, the Earl of Elgin was appointed as &quot;Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty to the Sublime Porte of Selim III, Sultan of Turkey&quot; (Greece was then part of the Ottoman Empire). Before his departure to take up the post, he had approached officials of the British government to inquire if they would be interested in employing artists to take casts and drawings of the sculptured portions of the Parthenon. According to Elgin, &quot;the answer of the Government ... was entirely negative.&quot;

Elgin decided to carry out the work himself, and employed artists to take casts and drawings under the supervision of the Neapolitan court painter, Giovanni Lusieri. Although his original intention was only to document the sculptures, in 1801 Elgin began to remove material from the Parthenon and its surrounding structures under the supervision of Lusieri. According to a Turkish local, marble sculptures that fell were being burned to obtain lime for building, and comparison with previously published drawings documented the state of rapid decay of the remains. Pieces were also removed from the Erechtheion, the Propylaia, and the Temple of Athena Nike, all inside the Acropolis.

They were brought from Greece to Malta, then a British protectorate, where they remained for a number of years until they were transported to Britain. The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost to Elgin of £74,240 (equivalent to £ in pounds). Elgin intended to use the marbles to enhance the art of Britain, and his ultimate goal had been for them to be purchased by the Government.

To build the case for the public expenditure, Elgin bought a house in London and set up the sculptures there as a private museum, making them accessible to artists, and eventually, the public. Elgin resumed negotiations for the sale of the collection to the British Museum in 1811, but talks failed when the government offered only £30,000; less than half of his expenses relating to them. The following years marked an increased interest in classical Greece, and Elgin procured testimonials from Ennio Quirino Visconti, director of the Louvre, and Antonio Canova of the Vatican Museum, who affirmed the high artistic value of the marbles. In 1816, a House of Commons Select Committee, established at Lord Elgin&#x27;s request, found that they were of high artistic value and recommended that the government purchase them for £35,000 to further the cultivation of the fine arts in Britain. In June 1816, after further debate, parliament approved the purchase of the marbles by a vote of 82–30. The marbles were transferred to the British Museum on 8 August.

==Description==

The marbles acquired by Elgin include some 21 figures from the statuary from the east and west pediments, 15 of an original 92 metope panels depicting battles between the Lapiths and the centaurs, as well as 75 metres of the Parthenon frieze which decorated the horizontal course set above the interior architrave of the temple. As such, they represent more than half of what now remains of the surviving sculptural decoration of the Parthenon.

Elgin&#x27;s acquisitions also included objects from other buildings on the Athenian Acropolis – a caryatid from the Erechtheion; four slabs from the parapet frieze of the Temple of Athena Nike; and a number of other architectural fragments of the Parthenon, Propylaia, Erechtheion, and the Temple of Athena Nike – as well as the Treasury of Atreus in Mycenae.

The British Museum also holds additional fragments from the Acropolis, acquired from various collections without connection to Elgin, such as those of Léon-Jean-Joseph Dubois, William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, and the Society of Dilettanti.

==Legality of the removal from Athens==
In February 1816, a House of Commons Select Committee held public hearings on whether Elgin had acquired the marbles legally and whether they should be purchased by the government. In his evidence to the committee, Elgin stated that the work of his agents at the Acropolis, and the removal of the marbles, were authorised by a &quot;firman&quot; (a generic term employed by Western travellers to signify any official Ottoman order) from the Ottoman government obtained in July 1801, and was undertaken with the approval of the &quot;voivode&quot; (civil governor of Athens) and the &quot;dizdar&quot; (military commander of the Acropolis citadel). In March 1810, another &quot;firman&quot; was obtained, authorising the second shipment of marbles from Athens to Britain. Elgin told the committee, &quot;the thing was done publicly before the whole world... and all the local authorities were concerned in it, as well as the Turkish government&quot;.

The committee cleared Elgin of all allegations that he had acquired the marbles illegally or had misused his powers as ambassador. Elgin&#x27;s version of events, however, remains controversial. No official record of the July 1801 &quot;firman&quot; has been found in the Turkish archives. An Italian translation of the purported &quot;firman&quot; is held by the British Museum, and an English translation was submitted to the 1816 Select Committee. The document states in part,

Vassilis Demetriades, of the University of Crete, argues that the document is not a &quot;firman&quot; (a decree from the Sultan), or a &quot;buyuruldi&quot; (an order from the Grand Vizier), but a &quot;mektub&quot; (official letter) from the Sultan&#x27;s acting Grand Vizier which did not have the force of law. Dyfri Williams states that although the document is not a &quot;firman&quot; in the technical sense, the term was widely used informally in diplomatic and court circles to refer to a range of official Ottoman documents. He argues that the document is possibly a &quot;buyuruldi&quot;, but &quot;[w]hatever the exact form of the document was, it clearly had to be obeyed, and it was.&quot; Historian Edhem Eldem also argues for the likely authenticity of the document and calls it a firman in the broad meaning of the word.
There is debate over whether the document authorised Elgin&#x27;s agents to remove sculptures attached to the Parthenon and other structures. Demetriades, David Rudenstine and others argue that the document only authorised Elgin&#x27;s party to remove artefacts recovered from the permitted excavations, not those still attached to buildings. Williams argues that the document was &quot;rather open ended&quot; and that the civil governor agreed with Hunt&#x27;s interpretation that it allowed Elgin&#x27;s party to remove sculptures fixed to buildings. Beard concludes, &quot;No amount of poring over the text can provide the answer. As often with documents sent out from head office, the precise interpretation would rest with men carrying out the orders on the spot.&quot;

Legal academic John Henry Merryman argues that the document provides only &quot;slender authority&quot; for the removal of the fixed sculptures, but that legally Elgin&#x27;s actions were ratified by the conduct of Ottoman officials. In 1802, Ottoman officials in Constantinople issued documents to the civil governor and the military commander of Athens ratifying their conduct and, in March 1810, issued a command allowing Elgin to transport a shipment of marbles from Greece to Britain.

Legal academic Catharine Titi states that Sir Robert Adair reported that the Ottomans in 1811 &quot;absolutely denied&quot; that Elgin had any property in the sculptures. Legal scholar Alexander Herman and historian Edhem Eldem state that documents in the Turkish archives show that this denial was only a delaying tactic for reasons of diplomacy, and that the Porte eventually granted permission for the transport of the marbles to Britain later in 1811.

A number of eyewitnesses to the removal of the marbles from the Acropolis, including members of Elgin&#x27;s party, stated that expensive bribes and gifts to local officials were required to ensure their work progressed. It is suggested that &quot;little money&quot; was paid to the disdar, and only to induce him to continue the work. No money is ever mentioned for the commencement of the work, which is due to the official authorisation. Merryman argues that bribery would not have rendered the acquisition of the marbles illegal by the standards of the time:

Rudenstine, states that further investigation would be required to determine whether, at the time, bribery would have been a significant legal consideration in such official transactions under Ottoman or British law. Herman argues that bribing officials was illegal under British and Ottoman law at the time, but that the Porte took no action against its officials in Athens and therefore tacitly tolerated their actions.

In May 2024, a spokesperson for Turkey, which is a successor or the continuing state of the Ottoman Empire, denied knowledge of the firman and stated that Turkey supported the return of the marbles. The spokesman stated that the marbles&#x27; removal was carried out by &quot;UK colonialists&quot;, adding: &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s room to discuss its legality, even during the time and under the law of the time.&quot; In response, archaeologist Mario Trabucco della Torretta states that scholars consider that the British copy of the firman is genuine and that it is arguable that it did grant Elgin permission to remove the sculptures.

==Contemporary reaction==

When, in 1807, Elgin put the first shipment of marbles on display in London they were &quot;an instant success among many&quot; who admired the sculptures and supported their arrival. The sculptor John Flaxman thought them superior to &quot;the treasures of Italy&quot;, and Benjamin West called them &quot;sublime specimens of the purest sculpture&quot;. Henry Fuseli was enthusiastic, and his friend Benjamin Haydon became a tireless advocate for their importance. Classicist Richard Payne Knight, however, declared they were Roman additions or the work of inferior craftsmen, and painter Ozias Humphrey called them &quot;a mass of ruins&quot;.

Lord Byron, a few years later, strongly objected to the removal of the marbles from Greece, denouncing Elgin as a vandal. In his narrative poem &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, published in 1812, he wrote in relation to the Parthenon:

Byron was not the only one to protest against the removal at the time. Sir John Newport said:Edward Daniel Clarke witnessed the removal of the metopes and called the action a &quot;spoliation&quot;, writing that &quot;thus the form of the temple has sustained a greater injury than it had already experienced from the Venetian artillery&quot;, and that &quot;neither was there a workman employed in the undertaking... who did not express his concern that such havoc should be deemed necessary, after moulds and casts had been already made of all the sculpture which it was designed to remove.&quot; When Sir Francis Ronalds visited Athens and Giovanni Battista Lusieri in 1820, he wrote that &quot;If Lord Elgin had possessed real taste in lieu of a covetous spirit he would have done just the reverse of what he has, he would have removed the rubbish and left the antiquities.&quot;
In 1810, Elgin published a defence of his actions, in which he argued that he had only decided to remove the marbles when he realised that they were not being cared for by Ottoman officials and were in danger of falling into the hands of Napoleon&#x27;s army.

Felicia Hemans supported the purchase of the marbles and in her &quot;Modern Greece: A Poem&quot; (1817), defied Byron with the question:
and quoted Haydon and other defenders of their accessibility in her notes.

Goethe thought the British government&#x27;s decision to buy the marbles would herald &quot;a new age of great art&quot;. The marbles went on public display in a temporary room of the British Museum in 1817 and soon broke attendance records for the museum. John Keats visited the British Museum in 1817, recording his feelings in the sonnet titled &quot;On Seeing the Elgin Marbles&quot;. Some lines of his &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; are also thought to have been inspired by his visit to the Elgin Marbles. William Wordsworth also viewed the marbles and commented favourably on their aesthetics in a letter to Haydon.

The marbles were later displayed in the specially constructed Elgin Saloon (1832) and became the preferred models for academic training in fine arts. Plaster casts of the marbles were in high demand and were distributed to museums, private collectors and heads of state throughout the world. They were moved to the Duveen Gallery, named after Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen, in 1939 where they continued to attract record attendances.

==Damage==

=== Late antiquity and Byzantine era ===
Sometime after the Parthenon was converted to a Christian church in the 6th-century CE, the metopes of the north, west and east facades of the Parthenon were defaced by Christians in order to remove images of pagan deities. The damage was so extensive that the images on the affected metopes often can&#x27;t be confidently identified.

===Venetians===

The Venetian bombardment of the Parthenon in 1687 seriously damaged the majority of sculptures, including some of those later removed by Elgin. Further damage to the Parthenon&#x27;s artwork occurred when the Venetian general Francesco Morosini attempted to remove some of the larger sculptures. During the operation, a sculpture of Poseidon and two horses of Athena&#x27;s chariot fell and broke into pieces. Several sculptures and fragments were removed by the Venetians.

===Elgin===
Elgin consulted with Italian sculptor Antonio Canova in 1803 about how best to restore the marbles. Canova was considered by some to be the world&#x27;s best sculptural restorer of the time; Elgin wrote that Canova declined to work on the marbles for fear of damaging them further.

To facilitate transport by Elgin, the columns&#x27; capitals and many metopes and frieze slabs were either hacked off the main structure or sawn and sliced into smaller sections, causing irreparable damage to the Parthenon itself. One shipload of marbles on board the British brig &quot;Mentor&quot; was caught in a storm off Cape Matapan in southern Greece and sank near Kythera, but was salvaged at the Earl&#x27;s personal expense; it took two years to bring them to the surface.

===British Museum===
The artefacts held in London suffered from 19th-century pollution which persisted until the mid-20th century and have suffered irreparable damage by previous cleaning methods employed by British Museum staff.

As early as 1838, scientist Michael Faraday was asked to provide a solution to the problem of the deteriorating surface of the marbles. The outcome is described in the following excerpt from the letter he sent to Henry Milman, a commissioner for the National Gallery.

The marbles generally were very dirty ... from a deposit of dust and soot. ... I found the body of the marble beneath the surface white. ... The application of water, applied by a sponge or soft cloth, removed the coarsest dirt. ... The use of fine, gritty powder, with the water and rubbing, though it more quickly removed the upper dirt, left much embedded in the cellular surface of the marble. I then applied alkalies, both carbonated and caustic; these quickened the loosening of the surface dirt ... but they fell far short of restoring the marble surface to its proper hue and state of cleanliness. I finally used dilute nitric acid, and even this failed. ... The examination has made me despair of the possibility of presenting the marbles in the British Museum in that state of purity and whiteness which they originally possessed.

A further effort to clean the marbles ensued in 1858. Richard Westmacott, who was appointed superintendent of the &quot;moving and cleaning the sculptures&quot; in 1857, in a letter approved by the British Museum Standing Committee on 13 March 1858 concluded

I think it my duty to say that some of the works are much damaged by ignorant or careless moulding – with oil and lard – and by restorations in wax and resin. These mistakes have caused discolouration. I shall endeavour to remedy this without, however, having recourse to any composition that can injure the surface of the marble.
Yet another effort to clean the marbles occurred in 1937–38. This time the incentive was provided by the construction of a new Gallery to house the collection. The Pentelic marble mined from Mount Pentelicus north of Athens, from which the sculptures are made, naturally acquires a tan colour similar to honey when exposed to air; this colouring is often known as the marble&#x27;s &quot;patina&quot; but Lord Duveen, who financed the whole undertaking, acting under the misconception that the marbles were originally white probably arranged for the team of masons working in the project to remove discolouration from some of the sculptures. The tools used were seven scrapers, one chisel and a piece of carborundum stone. They are now deposited in the British Museum&#x27;s Department of Preservation. The cleaning process scraped away some of the detailed tone of many carvings. According to Harold Plenderleith, the surface removed in some places may have been as much as one-tenth of an inch (2.5 mm).

The British Museum responded by saying that &quot;mistakes were made at that time.&quot; On another occasion, it was said that &quot;the damage had been exaggerated for political reasons&quot; and that &quot;the Greeks were guilty of excessive cleaning of the marbles before they were brought to Britain.&quot; During the international symposium on the cleaning of the marbles, organised by the British Museum in 1999, curator Ian Jenkins, deputy keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities, remarked that &quot;The British Museum is not infallible, it is not the Pope. Its history has been a series of good intentions marred by the occasional cock-up, and the 1930s cleaning was such a cock-up&quot;. Nonetheless, he claimed that the prime cause for the damage inflicted upon the marbles was the 2000-year-long weathering on the Acropolis.

In a newspaper article, American archaeologist Dorothy King wrote that techniques similar to those used in 1937–1938 were applied by Greeks as well in more recent decades than the British, and maintained that Italians still find them acceptable. The British Museum said that a similar cleaning of the Temple of Hephaestus in the Athenian Agora was carried out by the conservation team of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in 1953 using steel chisels and brass wire. According to the Greek ministry of Culture, the cleaning was carefully limited to surface salt crusts. The 1953 American report concluded that the techniques applied were aimed at removing the black deposit formed by rain-water and &quot;brought out the high technical quality of the carving&quot; revealing at the same time &quot;a few surviving particles of colour&quot;.
A 2023 study by Emma Payne concluded that the damage from the 1930s cleaning was minor and needed to be considered in the context of the time. Studies of the surface of the sculptures with archaeometric techniques, including Visible-Induced Luminescence (VIL), have revealed multiple traces of ancient polychromy on the sculptures, corroborating the idea that the cleaning damage was less extensive than previously thought.

Documents released by the British Museum under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that a series of minor accidents, thefts and acts of vandalism by visitors have inflicted further damage to the sculptures. This includes an incident in 1961 when two schoolboys knocked off a part of a centaur&#x27;s leg, and in 1966 four shallow lines were scratched on the back of one of the figures by vandals. In 1970, letters were scratched on to the upper right thigh of another figure. Four years later, the dowel hole in a centaur&#x27;s hoof was damaged by thieves trying to extract pieces of lead. In June 1981, a west pediment figure was slightly chipped by a falling glass skylight.

==Return controversy==

=== Greek requests for return ===
In 1836, King Otto of the newly independent Greece, formally asked the British government to return some of the Elgin Marbles (the four slabs of the frieze of the Temple of Athena Nike). In 1846, following a request from Greece, Britain sent a complete set of casts of the Parthenon frieze, and in 1890, the city of Athens unsuccessfully requested the return of the original frieze. In 1927, the Greek minister in London unsuccessfully asked for the return of some architectural fragments. In 1983, the Greek government formally asked the UK government to return &quot;all the sculptures which were removed from the Acropolis of Athens and are at present in the British Museum&quot;, and in 1984, it listed the dispute with UNESCO. In 2000, a select committee of the UK parliament held an inquiry into the illegal trade in cultural property, which considered the dispute over the marbles. The committee heard evidence from the then Greek foreign minister, George Papandreou, who argued that the question of legal ownership was secondary to the ethical and cultural arguments for returning the sculptures. The committee, however, made no recommendations on the future of the marbles.

In 2000, the Greek government commissioned the construction of a new Acropolis Museum, which opened in 2009. The museum was, in part, designed to arrange the surviving Parthenon sculptures (including those in the Elgin collection) as they originally stood on the Parthenon itself, and to counter arguments that the Elgin Marbles would be better preserved and displayed in the British Museum. The Acropolis Museum displays a portion of the remaining frieze (about 30% has been lost or destroyed), placed in their original orientation and in sight of the Parthenon. The position of the elements held in London are clearly marked with white casts, and space is left where the sculptures no longer survive.

In 2013, the Greek government asked UNESCO to mediate between the Greek and UK authorities on the return of the marbles, but the UK government and the British Museum declined UNESCO&#x27;s offer to mediate. In 2021, UNESCO concluded that the UK government had an obligation to return the marbles and called upon the UK government to open negotiations with Greece.

In late 2022, British and Greek authorities resumed negotiations on the future of the marbles. Asked about the possible return of the Marbles, the British Culture Secretary, Michelle Donelan replied: &quot;I can sympathise with some of the arguments but I do think that is a very dangerous and slippy road to embark down&quot;, expressing the worry that other cultural items now held in Britain might also have to be returned to the places they were acquired from.

In November 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak cancelled a meeting with the Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis over public comments Mitsotakis made regarding the marbles.

===Rationale for returning to Athens===
Those arguing for the marbles&#x27; return cite legal, moral, cultural, conservation and artistic grounds. Their arguments include:

* The marbles were obtained illegally, or at least unethically, and hence should be returned to their rightful owner.
* While the marbles are of universal cultural value, they are also part of the unique cultural heritage of Greece, and this is the most fitting location for them to be displayed.
* The Parthenon sculptures around the world should be reunited in order to restore &quot;organic elements&quot; which &quot;at present remain without cohesion, homogeneity and historicity of the monument to which they belong&quot; and allow visitors to better appreciate them as a whole.
* Presenting all the extant Parthenon Marbles near their original historical and cultural environment, and in the context of other Greek antiquities, would permit their &quot;fuller understanding and interpretation&quot;.
* Safekeeping of the marbles would be ensured at the Acropolis Museum, as it is equipped with state-of-the-art technology for the protection and preservation of exhibits.
* The Elgin Marbles have suffered significant damage from poor conservation and accidents in London and it cannot be assumed they will be better preserved there.
* Returning the Parthenon sculptures would not set a precedent for other restitution claims because of the distinctively &quot;universal value&quot; of the Parthenon.

===Rationale for remaining in London===
A range of arguments has been presented by scholars, British political leaders and the British Museum for the retention of the Elgin Marbles in London. These include the following:

* Elgin acquired the marbles legally and no court of law would find in favour of a Greek complainant.
* Elgin rescued the marbles from destruction and those in the British Museum are in better condition than those left behind. The British Museum has a right to retain and publicly display what it preserved from destruction.
* Bringing the Parthenon sculptures together as a unified whole is impossible as half had been lost or destroyed by 1800.
* The British Museum display allows the marbles to be better viewed in the context of other major ancient cultures and thus complements the perspective provided by the Acropolis Museum collection.
* Fulfilling all restitution claims would empty most of the world&#x27;s great museumsthis has also caused concerns among other European and American museums, with one potential target being the Nefertiti Bust in Berlin&#x27;s Neues Museum; in addition, portions of Parthenon marbles are kept by many other European museums.
* The British Museum receives about 6 million visitors per year as opposed to 1.5 million visitors to the Acropolis Museum. The removal of the marbles to Greece would significantly reduce the number of people who have the opportunity to visit the marbles.
* The Elgin Marbles have been on public display in England since 1807 and in that time have become a part of the British cultural heritage.

=== Public campaigns for return ===
Outside Greece, a campaign for the return of the marbles began in 1981 with the formation of the International Organising Committee – Australia – for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles, and in 1983, with the formation of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles. Campaign organisations also exist in Greece and around the world.

A number of British and international celebrities such as comedian Stephen Fry and actor George Clooney have expressed their support for the return of the marbles.

===Opinion polls===
An Ipsos MORI poll of British voters in 1998, found 39% in favour of returning the marbles to Greece and 15% in favour of keeping them in Britain; 45% had no opinion or would not vote if the question were put to a referendum. Another Mori poll in 2002 showed similar results. A YouGov poll in 2021 found that 59% of British respondents thought the Parthenon marbles belonged in Greece, 18% that they belonged in Britain, and 18% did not know.

===British press===
&quot;The Guardian&quot; published an editorial in 2020 reiterating its support for the return of the Parthenon marbles. In January 2022, &quot;The Times&quot; reversed its long-standing support for retaining the marbles, publishing an editorial calling for their return to Greece. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; published an editorial in January 2023 arguing that any decision on the return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece should be made by the UK parliament.

===British Museum Act 1963===
The British Museum Act 1963 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which forbids the British Museum from disposing of its holdings, except in a small number of special circumstances. Any change to the Act would have to be passed by Parliament.

==Loans and copies==
The British Museum has made plaster casts of the marbles and distributed them to many museums around the world. In 2022, The Institute of Digital Archaeology (IDA) in Oxford asked the British Museum to scan its marbles from the Parthenon in order to make robot-carved marble replicas. The museum, however, declined the request and the Greek government declined to comment on the project.

The British Museum lent the figure of a river-god, possibly the river Ilisus, to the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg to celebrate its 250th anniversary. It was on display there from 6 December 2014 until 18 January 2015. This was the first time the British Museum had lent part of its Parthenon Marbles collection and it caused some controversy. The British Museum states that it is open to lending its marbles from the Parthenon to Greece but the Greek government does not wish to agree to the standard clause acknowledging the British Museum&#x27;s ownership of any loan items.

<doc id="173398" wikidata="Q335098" url="?curid=173398" title="Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin">
<text>Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin and 11th Earl of Kincardine, ( ; 20 July 176614 November 1841), often known as Lord Elgin, was a Scottish nobleman, diplomat, and collector, known primarily for the controversial procurement of marble sculptures (known as the Elgin Marbles) from the Parthenon and other structures on the Acropolis of Athens.

==Early life==
A member of the formerly royal house of Bruce, Elgin was born at the family seat, Broomhall House, near Dunfermline, Fife. He was the second son of Charles Bruce, 5th Earl of Elgin and his wife Martha Whyte, governess to Princess Charlotte of Wales. He succeeded his older brother William Robert Bruce, the 6th Earl, in 1771 when he was only five.

He was educated at Harrow and Westminster. After several years at St Andrews, he proceeded to the Continent where he completed his studies at Paris.

== Career ==

=== Military career ===
Elgin entered the army as an ensign in the Scots Guards in 1785. He transferred to 65th Foot in 1789, as captain of a company, by purchase. In 1793, he was appointed to the staff as a major of foot by brevet, holding the rank on the Continent only. In 1795, he transferred to 12th Regiment of Foot as a major. Later in 1795, he raised a regiment of Fencible Infantry and was appointed its colonel, with the permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in the Army. He was promoted to colonel in the Army in 1802, to major general in 1809 and to lieutenant general in 1814.

=== Public life ===
Elgin was elected as a Scottish representative peer in 1790. In 1799, he was appointed to the Privy Council (PC). He attended Parliament whenever his other duties allowed until he lost his seat in 1807. He held the office of Lord Lieutenant of Fife.

=== Diplomatic career ===
In 1791, he was sent as a temporary envoy-extraordinary to Austria, while Sir Robert Keith was ill. He was then sent as envoy-extraordinary in Brussels from 1792 until the conquest of the Austrian Netherlands by France. After spending time in Britain, he was sent as envoy-extraordinary to Prussia in 1795.

Elgin was appointed as ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in December 1798. On 11 March 1799, shortly before setting off for Constantinople, Elgin married Mary, daughter and heiress of William Hamilton Nisbet, of Dirleton. Elgin arrived at Constantinople on 6 November 1799. As ambassador to the Sublime Porte he showed considerable skill and energy in fulfilling a difficult mission, the extension of British influence during the conflict between the Ottoman Empire and France. The Treaty of Amiens was signed by Britain and France in March 1802. His embassy at an end, Elgin departed Constantinople on 16 January 1803.

==The Elgin Marbles==

Following discussions with the diplomat and archaeologist Sir William Hamilton, Elgin decided he would engage, at his own expense, a team of artists and architects to produce plaster casts and detailed drawings of ancient Greek buildings, sculptures and artefacts. In this way he hoped to make his embassy, &quot;beneficial to the progress of the Fine Arts in Great Britain.&quot;

Elgin procured the services of a Neapolitan painter, Lusieri, and of several skilful draughtsmen and modellers. These artists were dispatched to Athens in the summer of 1800, and were principally employed in making drawings of the ancient monuments. Elgin stated that about the middle of the summer of 1801, he had received a &quot;firman&quot; from the Sublime Porte which allowed his agents not only to &quot;fix scaffolding round the ancient Temple of the Idols [the Parthenon], and to mould the ornamental sculpture and visible figures thereon in plaster and gypsum,&quot; but also &quot;to take away any pieces of stone with old inscriptions or figures thereon&quot;. The document exists in an Italian translation made by the British Embassy in Constantinople and now held by the British Museum, but no official copy of it has yet been found in the Turkish government archives from the imperial era. There is debate over the legal status of the document.

The actual procurement of ancient marbles from Athens formed no part of Elgin&#x27;s first plan. The decision to remove marbles attached to structures was made on the spot by Philip Hunt, Elgin&#x27;s chaplain and one of his representatives in Athens. Elgin&#x27;s agents removed about half of the Parthenon frieze, fifteen metopes, and seventeen pedimental sculpture fragments, in addition to a caryatid and a column from the Erechtheion, sculptured slabs from the Athenian temple of Nike Apteros, and various antiquities from Attica and other districts of Hellas.

Part of the Elgin collection was prepared for embarkation for Britain in 1803, and considerable difficulties were encountered at every stage of its transit. Elgin&#x27;s vessel, the &quot;Mentor&quot;, was wrecked near Cerigo with its cargo of marbles, and it was not till after the labours of three years, and the expenditure of a large sum of money, that the marbles were successfully recovered by the divers. On Elgin&#x27;s departure from the Ottoman Empire in 1803, he withdrew all his artists from Athens with the exception of Lusieri, who remained to direct the excavations, which were still carried on, though on a much reduced scale. Additions continued to be made to the Elgin collections, and as late as 1812, eighty fresh cases of antiquities arrived in England.

Elgin&#x27;s procurement of the marbles was supported by some, including Goethe, and censured by others in Britain as vandalism, most famously Lord Byron, who wrote the following lines
&lt;poem&gt;::Dull is the eye that will not weep to see
::Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed
::By British hands, which it had best behoved
::To guard those relics ne&#x27;er to be restored.
::Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved,
::And once again thy hapless bosom gored,
::And snatch&#x27;d thy shrinking gods to northern climes abhorred!&lt;/poem&gt;
Elgin defended his actions in a pamphlet &quot;Memorandum on the Subject of the Earl of Elgin&#x27;s Pursuits in Greece&quot;, published in 1810. On the recommendation of a British parliamentary select committee, the marbles were purchased by the British government in 1816 for £35,000, considerably below their cost to Elgin (estimated at £75,000), and transferred in trust to the British Museum, where they went on display in 1817.

Britain&#x27;s ownership of the Elgin Marbles is disputed by Greece. Discussions between UK and Greek officials about the future of the marbles are ongoing.

== Detention in France ==
After leaving Constantinople, the Elgins decided to return to Britain via Italy and France. When, on 18 May 1803, war again broke out between Britain and France, they were in Lyon. Elgin was declared a prisoner of war and was released on parole on condition that he not leave France. In November, Elgin was imprisoned in the fortress of Lourdes and the French offered to release him in exchange for a French general in detention in England. The British refused, and Elgin was again released on parole. In October 1805, the French gave Lady Elgin, who was pregnant, permission to return to England on compassionate grounds. Elgin himself was finally allowed to leave France in June 1806 following a direct appeal to Napoleon by British Prime Minister Lord Grenville. As a condition of his release, Elgin agreed to return to France whenever the French government demanded.

==Return to Britain and later life==
Soon after returning to Britain, Elgin discovered that his wife was having an affair with Robert Ferguson, one of his oldest friends. In December 1807, Elgin successfully sued Ferguson for seduction in the English courts and was awarded £10,000 in damages. In March 1808, he brought a successful divorce action in Edinburgh against his wife on grounds of adultery. The marriage was formally dissolved by a private act of Parliament. The court cases were widely reported and caused considerable public scandal.

In 1807, Elgin lost his seat in the House of Lords, and the resumption of a military or diplomatic career was ruled out by the terms of his parole in France, which Elgin felt honour bound to observe while Napoleon was in power. Elgin was deeply in debt due to the costs associated with his embassy, his procurement of the Elgin marbles, and his court actions. He virtually retired from public life.

In September 1810, Elgin married Elizabeth Oswald of Dunnikier. That year, he offered his collection of antiquities for sale to the government, but withdrew when he was offered only £30,000.

During 1815 Elgin became embroiled in the Tweddell remains affair, a controversy over the possessions of John Tweddell, a classical scholar who had died in 1799 in Athens. Elgin was accused of having appropriated some of Tweddell&#x27;s papers after his death, during his term as British ambassador in Constantinople. Some of Tweddell&#x27;s papers had been destroyed in a fire and others lost at sea. The remaining papers were misplaced when Elgin arranged for them to be sent back to England. The matter was settled in late 1816 with the return of some of the items to Tweddell&#x27;s family.

In 1820, Elgin was again elected to the House of Lords, but his requests for a peerage were unsuccessful. He eventually moved to France to escape his creditors and died in Paris on 4 November 1841. His widow, the Dowager Countess of Elgin, died in Paris 1 April 1860.

==Family==

Lord Elgin married twice. On 11 March 1799, he married Mary Nisbet (1778–1855), the only child of William Hamilton Nisbet, of Dirleton. They had a son and three daughters:
*George Charles Constantine Bruce, Lord Bruce (5 April 18001840)
*Lady Mary Bruce (28 August 1801 – 21 December 1883)
*Lady Matilda Harriet Bruce (1802 – 31 August 1857), married Sir John Maxwell, 8th Baronet
*Hon. William Nisbet Hamilton Bruce (4 March 1804 – 20 April 1805), died in infancy
*Lady Lucy Bruce (21 January 18064 September 1881)

After her marriage to Elgin ended in divorce, Mary married Ferguson.

Elgin, on 21 September 1810, married Elizabeth Oswald (1790–1860), the youngest daughter of James Townsend Oswald of Dunnikier. They had four sons and three daughters:
* James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin (20 July 1811 – 20 November 1863), governor-in-chief of British North America and viceroy of India

<doc id="173400" wikidata="Q1502139" url="?curid=173400" title="Geneva Bible">
<text>The Geneva Bible, sometimes known by the sobriquet Breeches Bible, is one of the most historically significant translations of the Bible into English, preceding the Douay Rheims Bible by 22 years, and the King James Version by 51 years. It was the primary Bible of 16th-century English Protestantism and was used by William Shakespeare, Oliver Cromwell, John Knox, John Donne and others. It was one of the Bibles taken to America on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; (Pilgrim Hall Museum has collected several Bibles of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers), and its frontispiece inspired Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s design for the first Great Seal of the United States.

The Geneva Bible was used by many English Dissenters, and it was still respected by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers at the time of the English Civil War, in the booklet &quot;The Souldiers Pocket Bible&quot;.

Because the language of the Geneva Bible was more forceful and vigorous, most readers strongly preferred this version to the Great Bible. In the words of Cleland Boyd McAfee, &quot;it drove the Great Bible off the field by sheer power of excellence&quot;.

==History==
The Geneva Bible followed the Great Bible of 1539, the first authorized Bible in English, which was the authorized Bible of the Church of England.

During the reign of Mary I (1553–1558), who restored Catholicism and outlawed Protestantism in England, a number of English Protestant scholars fled to Geneva, which was then a republic in which John Calvin and, later, Theodore Beza, provided the primary spiritual and theological leadership. Among these scholars was William Whittingham who supervised the translation now known as the Geneva Bible, in collaboration with Myles Coverdale, Christopher Goodman, Anthony Gilby, Thomas Sampson, and William Cole. Whittingham was directly responsible for the New Testament, which was complete and published in 1557, while Gilby oversaw the Old Testament. Several members of this group would later become prominent figures in the Vestments controversy.
The first full edition of this Bible, which included a revised New Testament, appeared in 1560, and was published by Sir Rowland Hill of Soulton, but it was not printed in England until 1575 (New Testament) and 1576 (complete Bible). Over 150 editions were issued; the last probably in 1644. The first Bible printed in Scotland was a Geneva Bible, which was first issued in 1579. In fact, the involvement of Knox (1514–1572) and Calvin (1509–1564) in the creation of the Geneva Bible made it especially appealing in Scotland, where in 1579 a law was passed requiring every household of sufficient means to buy a copy.

Some editions from 1576 onwards included Laurence Tomson&#x27;s revisions of the New Testament. Some editions from 1599 onwards used a new &quot;Junius&quot; version of the Book of Revelation, in which the notes were translated from a new Latin commentary by Franciscus Junius. 

The annotations, a significant part of the Geneva Bible, were Calvinist and Puritan in character, and as such were disliked by the ruling pro-government Anglicans of the Church of England, as well as by James I, who commissioned the &quot;Authorized Version&quot;, or King James Bible, in order to replace it. The Geneva Bible had also motivated the earlier production of the Bishops&#x27; Bible under Elizabeth I for the same reason, and the later Rheims–Douai edition by the Catholic community. The Geneva Bible nevertheless remained popular among Puritans and was in widespread use until after the English Civil War. The last edition was printed in 1644.

The Geneva Bible acquired the sobriquet &quot;Breeches Bible&quot; because it describes Adam and Eve as having made “breeches” to cover their nakedness (Genesis 3:7).

The Geneva notes were surprisingly included in a few editions of the King James Version, as late as 1715. Benjamin Franklin is understood to have been inspired by the frontispiece of the Geneva Bible in his design proposal for the first Great Seal of the United States.

==Translation and format==
The Geneva Bible was the first English version to be translated entirely from the original languages of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Though the text is principally just a revision of William Tyndale&#x27;s earlier work of 1534, Tyndale had only fully translated the New Testament; he had translated the Old Testament through 2 Chronicles before he was imprisoned. The English refugees living in Geneva completed the first translation of the Old Testament from Hebrew to English. The work was led by William Whittingham.

=== Textual basis ===
The Geneva Bible was translated from scholarly editions of the Greek New Testament and the Hebrew Scriptures that comprise the Old Testament. The English rendering was substantially based on the earlier translations by William Tyndale and Myles Coverdale (the Geneva Bible relies significantly upon Tyndale).

=== Format ===
==== Size ====
The Geneva Bible was also issued in more convenient and affordable sizes than earlier versions. The 1560 Bible was in quarto format (218 × 139 mm type area), but pocket-size octavo editions were also issued, and a few large folio editions. The New Testament was issued at various times in sizes from quarto down to 32º (the smallest, 70×39 mm type area).

==Breeches Bible==
Here are both the Geneva, Tyndale and the King James versions of Genesis 3:7 with original spelling (not modernized):
==King James I and the Geneva Bible==
King James I&#x27;s distaste for the Geneva Bible was not caused by the translation of the text into English, but rather the annotations in the margins. He felt strongly that many of the annotations were &quot;very partial, untrue, seditious, and savoring too much of dangerous and traitorous conceits&quot;. In all likelihood, he saw the Geneva&#x27;s interpretations of some biblical passages as anti-clerical &quot;republicanism&quot;, which could imply church hierarchy was unnecessary. Other passages appeared particularly seditious, most notably references to monarchs as &quot;tyrants&quot;.

Examples of the commentary in conflict with the monarchy in the Geneva Bible (modern spelling) include:

* Daniel 6:22 – &quot;For he Daniel] disobeyed the king’s wicked commandment in order to obey God, and so he did no injury to the king, who ought to command nothing by which God would be dishonoured.&quot;
* Daniel 11:36 – &quot;So long the tyrants will prevail as God has appointed to punish his people: but he shows that it is but for a time.&quot;
* Exodus 1:19 – To the Hebrew midwives lying to their leaders, &quot;Their disobedience herein was lawful, but their dissembling evil.&quot;
* 2 Chronicles 15:15-17 – King Asa &quot;showed that he lacked zeal, for she should have died both by the covenant and by the law of God, but he gave place to foolish pity and would also seem after a sort to satisfy the law.&quot;

When toward the end of the conference two Puritans suggested that a new translation of the Bible be produced to better unify the Anglican Church in England and Scotland, James embraced the idea. He would not only be rid of those inconvenient annotations but have greater influence on the translation of the Bible as a whole. He commissioned and chartered a new translation of the Bible which would eventually become the most famous version of the Bible in the history of the English language. Officially known as the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; to be read in churches, the new Bible would come to bear his name as the so-called King James Bible or King James Version (KJV) elsewhere or casually. The first and early editions of the King James Bible from 1611 and the first few decades thereafter lack annotations, unlike nearly all editions of the Geneva Bible up until that time. 

Initially, the King James Version did not sell well and competed with the Geneva Bible. Shortly after the first edition of the KJV, King James banned the printing of new editions of the Geneva Bible to further entrench his version. However, Robert Barker continued to print Geneva Bibles even after the ban, placing the spurious date of 1599 on new copies of Genevas which were actually printed between about 1616 and 1625.

== Legacy ==
Although the King James Version was intended to replace the Geneva Bible, the King James translators relied heavily upon this version. Bruce Metzger, in Theology Today 1960, observes the inevitable reliance the KJV had on the Geneva Bible. Some estimate that twenty percent of the former came directly from the latter. He further revels in the enormous impact the Geneva Bible had on Protestantism: &quot;In short, it was chiefly owing to the dissemination of copies of the Geneva version of 1560 that a sturdy and articulate Protestantism was created in Britain, a Protestantism which made a permanent impact upon Anglo-American culture.&quot;

The Puritan Separatists or Pilgrim Fathers aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620 brought to North America copies of the Geneva Bible. German historian Leopold von Ranke observed that &quot;Calvin was virtually the founder of America.&quot;

<doc id="173403" wikidata="Q4876058" url="?curid=173403" title="Bead stringing">
<text>Bead stringing is the putting of beads on string.

It can range from simply sliding a single bead onto any thread-like medium (string, silk thread, leather thong, thin wire, multi-stranded beading wire, or a soft, flexible wire) to complex creations that have multiple strands or interwoven levels. The choice of stringing medium can be an important point in the overall design, since string-type mediums might be subject to unwanted stretching if the weight of the beads is considerable. Similarly, certain bead types with sharp edges, such as hollow metal beads or some varieties of stone or glass, might abrade the string and cause the strand to eventually break.

The simplest design is a single bead centered as a focal point on the string medium. The ends of the string can be simply knotted together or components of a clasp may be attached to each end.

Next in complexity would be stringing multiple beads onto a single strand. Here alone are numerous opportunities for adding elements to the design concept. All the beads might be identical. The beads might be varied (in shape, color, type or any combination thereof) and used either in a random assortment or in a deliberate repeating pattern. Items not strictly defined as beads, such as pendants or &quot;drops&quot;, might be placed within the strand to serve as focal points or accent elements in the design.

Knotting is a next level of proficiency in creating strands. Here the stringing medium (traditionally silk thread or another similar, synthetic medium) has knots tied into it as a means of separating the individual beads from each other. The traditional strand of pearls is a well-known example of this technique. Pearls are threaded onto silk, and a knot is tied between each one to not only space them for greater individual prominence but to also keep them from rubbing directly against each other and risking the abrasion of the nacre that gives them their luster. This classic design can be varied by adding or using other varieties of beads or varying the number and placement of knots used.

Multiple strands can be created using either the simple stringing or the knotting technique. Here, depending on the overall design, more planning may be called for. If the bead pattern is random, the only concern is that one strand be sized shorter than the next, so they will all lie flat and not interfere with each other when worn or displayed. However, if a specific repeating pattern is planned, then careful planning will be required so that the placement of matching portions of the pattern between the strands is aligned properly. A beading board, generally a flat panel with measured curved indentations in several staggered lengths, is a useful tool for spacing the beads to work out the desired pattern. Once the design has been worked out, joining the strands together might require special multiple-strand clasp fixtures unless there is a single knotting point or specific design element that will accommodate it.

There is another way of using the smallest size of beads which is naive and in Pakistan it is called &quot;Motikaari&quot; (an Urdu word for &quot;beadwork&quot;). It is a medium for artistic expression e.g. calligraphy or portraiture by arranging patterns of smallest size of beads of different textures and hues in the length of adjoined strings.
Motikaari is a craft as well as an art. The craftsperson/artist who work on motikaari is called &#x27;Motikaar&#x27;. The method of making a pattern involves three stages.
The first stage in this art form is to prepare a desired pattern on paper. Then it is pasted on a flat panel hardboard sheet. Preparation of hardboard sheet is the second important stage of the work. In the third stage, the beads of different colors are strung together according to the sketched pattern into the thread with the help of needle in the form of independent but parallel columns of strings. (This method discovered by Motikaar Malik Nisar Ahmed of Pakistan is the simplest and easiest so far. Malik Nisar Ahmed claimed to be the creator of this form of bead stringing as he made countless items of Motikaari compared to anybody else in the world. He is the member of Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA).)

Finally, after the consummation of the artistic pattern, it is removed from the hardboard so that it can be displayed in the shape of hanging strings of beads.

Among the types of wire used for bead stringing, tiger tail wire is the most common.

<text>An analog sampled filter an electronic filter that is a hybrid between an analog and a digital filter. The input is an analog signal, and usually stored in capacitors. The time domain is discrete, however. Distinct analog samples are shifted through an array of holding capacitors as in a bucket brigade. Analog adders and amplifiers do the arithmetic in the signal domain, just as in an analog computer.

Note that these filters are subject to aliasing phenomena just like a digital filter, and anti-aliasing filters will usually be required. See .

Companies such as Linear Technology and Maxim produce integrated circuits that implement this functionality. Filters up to the 8th order may be implemented using a single chip. Some are fully configurable; some are pre-configured, usually as low-pass filters.

Due to the high filter order that can be achieved in an easy and stable manner, single chip analog sampled filters are often used for implementing anti-aliasing filters for digital filters. The analog sampled filter will in its turn need yet another anti-aliasing filter, but this can often be implemented as a simple 1st order low-pass analog filter consisting of one series resistor and one capacitor to ground.</text><links>

<text>The University of British Columbia (UBC) is a public research university with campuses near Vancouver and Kelowna, in British Columbia, Canada. With an annual research budget of $893million, UBC funds 9,992 projects annually in various fields of study within the industrial sector, as well as governmental and non-governmental organizations.

The Vancouver campus is situated on the Point Grey campus lands, an unincorporated area next to the City of Vancouver and the University Endowment Lands. The university is located west of Downtown Vancouver. UBC is also home to TRIUMF, Canada&#x27;s national particle and nuclear physics laboratory, which boasts the world&#x27;s largest cyclotron. In addition to the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies and the Stuart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute, UBC and the Max Planck Society collectively established the first Max Planck Institute in North America, specializing in quantum mechanics. Green College is UBC&#x27;s transdisciplinary semi-independent post-graduate live-in college and is situated on the north-eastern tip of campus adjacent to Burrard Inlet. One of Canada&#x27;s largest research libraries, the UBC Library system has over 8.3million items (including print and electronic) among its 21 branches. It is visited annually by 3.1 million people or 9.7 million virtually. The Okanagan campus, acquired in 2005, is located in Kelowna, British Columbia.

Those affiliated with UBC include eight Nobel laureates, 75 Rhodes scholars, 231 Olympians with 65 medals won collectively, 306 fellows to the Royal Society of Canada, and 22 3M National Teaching Fellows. Among UBC&#x27;s alums are Canadian Prime Ministers John Turner, Kim Campbell, Justin Trudeau, and the former Prime Minister of Bulgaria, Kiril Petkov.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===


In 1877, six years after British Columbia joined Canada, the Superintendent of Education, John Jessop, submitted a proposal to form a provincial university. The provincial legislature passed &quot;An Act Respecting the University of British Columbia&quot; in 1890, but disagreements arose over whether to build the university on Vancouver Island or the mainland.

The British Columbia University Act of 1908 formally called a provincial university into being, although its location was not specified. The governance was modelled on the Provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, which created a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty) responsible for academic policy and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership. The Act constituted a 21-member senate with Francis Carter-Cotton of Vancouver as chancellor.

Before the University Act, there were several attempts at creating a degree-granting university with help from the universities of Toronto and McGill. Columbia College in New Westminster, through its affiliation with Victoria College of the University of Toronto, began to offer university-level credit at the turn of the century, but McGill came to dominate higher education in the early 1900s.

Building on a successful affiliation between Vancouver and Victoria high schools with McGill University, Henry Marshall Tory helped establish the McGill University College of British Columbia. From 1906 to 1915, McGill BC (as it was called) operated as a private institution, providing the first few years toward a degree at McGill University or elsewhere. The Henry Marshall Tory Medal was established in 1941 by Tory, founding president of the University of Alberta and of the National Research Council of Canada and a co-founder of Carleton University. 

In the meantime, appeals were made to the government to revive the earlier legislation for a provincial institution, leading to the University Endowment Act in 1907 and the University Act in 1908. In 1910, the Point Grey site was chosen, and the government appointed Dr. Frank Fairchild Wesbrook as President in 1913 and Leonard Klinck as Dean of Agriculture in 1914. A declining economy and the outbreak of war in August 1914 compelled the university to postpone plans for building at Point Grey, and instead the former McGill University College site at Fairview became home to the university until 1925. On the first day of lectures, September 30, 1915, the new independent university absorbed McGill University College. The University of British Columbia awarded its first degrees in 1916, and Klinck became the second president in 1919, serving until 1944.

In 1917, Evlyn Fenwick Farris became the first woman in Canada to be appointed to the board of governors of a university— a founding governor of UBC. She was also the first woman to be appointed to the UBC Senate. Active in its formation, the University Women&#x27;s Club of Vancouver considered UBC its &quot;godchild.&quot;

===Move to Point Grey===
World War I dominated campus life and the student body was &quot;decimated&quot; by enlistments for active service, with three hundred male UBC students in Company &quot;D&quot; alone. By the war&#x27;s end, 697 male members of the university had enlisted. 109 students graduated in the three war-time congregations, all but one in the Faculty of Arts and Science.

By 1920, the university had only three faculties: Arts, Applied Science, and Agriculture (with the Departments of Agronomy, Animal Husbandry, Dairying, Horticulture, and Poultry). It only awarded the degrees of Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) and Bachelor of Science in agriculture (BSA). There were 576 male students and 386 female students in the 1920–21 winter session, but only 64 academic staff, including 6 women.

In the early part of the 20th century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law, and medicine. Although UBC did not offer degrees in these fields, it began to offer degrees in new professional areas such as engineering, agriculture, nursing, and school teaching. It also introduced graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis, with students completing M.A. degrees in natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.

By 1922, the student body numbered over 1200 and embarked on a &quot;Build the University&quot; campaign. Students marched through the streets of Vancouver to draw attention to their plight, enlist popular support, and embarrass the government. Fifty-six thousand signatures were presented at the legislature in support of the campaign, which was ultimately successful. On September 22, 1925, lectures began at the new Point Grey campus. Except for the library, science, and Power House buildings, all the campus buildings were temporary buildings. Students built two playing fields, but the university had no dormitories and no social center. However, the university continued to grow.

Soon, however, the effects of the depression began to be felt. The provincial government, upon which the university depended heavily, cut the annual grant severely. In 1932–33, salaries were cut by up to 23%. Posts remained vacant, and a few faculty lost their jobs. Most graduate courses were dropped. In 1935, the university established the Department of Extension. Just as things began to improve, World War II began, and Canada declared war on September 10, 1939. Soon afterwards, University President Klinck wrote:

&#x27; From the day of the declaration of war, the University has been prepared to put at the disposal of the Government all possible assistance by way of laboratories, equipment and trained personnel, insofar as such action is consistent with the maintenance of reasonably efficient instructional standards. To do less would be unthinkable. &#x27;

Heavy rains and melting snowfall eroded a deep ravine across the north end of the campus, in the Grand Campus Washout of 1935. The campus did not have storm drains and surface runoff went down a ravine to the beach. When the university carved a ditch to drain flooding on University Avenue, the rush of water steepened the ravine and eroded it back as fast as per hour. The resulting gully eventually consumed , two bridges and buildings near Graham House. The university was closed for four and a half days. Afterwards, the gully was filled with debris from a nearby landslide, and only traces are visible today.

Military training on the campus became popular and was later made mandatory. WWII marked the first provision of money from the federal government to the university for research purposes. This laid a foundation for future research grants from the federal government of Canada.

===Post-war years===
By the end of World War II, Point Grey&#x27;s facilities could not meet the influx of veterans returning to their studies. The university needed new staff, courses, faculties and buildings for teaching and accommodation. The student population rose from 2,974 in 1944–45 to 9,374 in 1947–48. Surplus Army and Air Force camps were used for both classrooms and accommodations. The university took over fifteen complete camps during the 1945–46 session, with a sixteenth camp on Little Mountain, in Vancouver, converted into suites for married students. Most of the camps were dismantled and carried by barge or truck to the university, where the huts were scattered across the campus.

Student numbers hit 9,374 in 1948; more than 53% of the students were war veterans in 1947–67. Between 1947 and 1951, the university built twenty new permanent buildings. Those included the War Memorial Gym, which was built with money raised primarily by the students and dedicated on October 26, 1951.

In the 1961–62 academic year, the university had an enrollment of 12,602 students, including 798 graduate students. The next year, the single-University policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial Universities gained autonomy as Universities – the University of Victoria was established in 1963.

===Recent history===

Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau announced the creation of the Museum of Anthropology at UBC on July 1, 1971. At a construction cost of $2.5million the museum building, designed by Arthur Erickson, opened in 1976. That same year, the university launched a normal school program under the direction of Sally Rogow to train educators on methods to teach students with multiple disabilities or who were visually impaired.

UBC was the host for the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1974. The &quot;Proceedings&quot; of the Congress were edited by Ralph Duncan James in four volumes.

In 1993, UBC concluded its &quot;World of Opportunity&quot; capital campaign that started in 1988. In total the university raised $262 million for the campaign. An additional $72 million in &quot;non-campaign fundraising&quot; was also raised. During the administration of President Strangway, UBC abandoned its previous design and planning process and private donors started to have more influence on building design.

In 2015, UBC concluded its &quot;Start an Evolution&quot; capital campaign. The campaign&#x27;s quiet phase started in April 2008 and it launched publicly in September 2011. The initial goal was to raise $1.5 billion. The campaign surpassed that goal and raised $1.624 billion.

UBC&#x27;s 15th president was Professor Santa J. Ono. He assumed the presidency on August 15, 2016. He served previously as the 28th president of the University of Cincinnati. Dr. Martha Piper – who served as the 11th president of the university – served as interim president from September 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016, following the resignation of Dr. Arvind Gupta.

In early May 2020, UBC announced it would be holding a virtual graduation for the class of 2020 amid concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. The university received $419,248 from the Government of Canada to promote uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among public health leaders, community figures, Indigenous peoples and leadership in municipal government.

On October 3, 2022, Dr. Deborah Buszard was appointed interim President and Vice-Chancellor of UBC.

In July 2023, UBC announced that Carleton University President Benoit-Antoine Bacon would be UBC&#x27;s new President as of November 1, 2023.

==Campuses==

===Vancouver===
The main campus is located at Point Grey, approximately from downtown Vancouver. It lies on forcefully taken territory of the Musqueam people. It is near several beaches and has views of the North Shore Mountains. The Pacific Spirit Regional Park serves as a green-belt between the campus and the city. Buildings on the Vancouver campus occupy gross on of maintained land. The campus street plan is mostly in a grid of malls (some of which are pedestrian-only). Lower Mall and West Mall are in the southwestern part of the peninsula, with Main, East and Wesbrook Malls northeast of them.

The campus is not within Vancouver&#x27;s city limits and therefore UBC is policed by the RCMP rather than the Vancouver Police Department. However, the Vancouver Fire Department provides service to UBC under a contract. In addition to UBC RCMP, there is also the UBC Campus Security that patrols the campus. Postage sent to any building on campus includes Vancouver in the address.

UBC Vancouver also has two satellite campuses within the City of Vancouver: at Vancouver General Hospital, for the medical sciences and at Robson Square in downtown Vancouver, for part-time credit and non-credit programs. UBC is also a partner in the consortium backing Great Northern Way Campus Ltd and is affiliated with a group of adjacent theological colleges, which include the Vancouver School of Theology, Regent College, Carey Theological College and Corpus Christi College.

The campus is home to numerous gardens. The UBC Botanical Garden and Centre for Plant Research, the first UBC department, holds a collection of over 8000 different kinds of plants used for research, conservation and education. The UBC botanical garden&#x27;s original site was at the &quot;Old Arboretum&quot;. All that remains of it today are trees planted in 1916 by John Davidson. The old arboretum is now home to many buildings including the First Nations House of Learning. The Nitobe Memorial Garden, built to honor Japanese scholar Inazo Nitobe, has been the subject of more than fifteen years&#x27; study by a UBC professor, who believes its construction hides a number of impressive features, including references to Japanese philosophy and mythology, shadow bridges visible only at certain times of year and positioning of a lantern filled with light at the exact date and time of Nitobe&#x27;s death each year. The garden is behind the university&#x27;s Asian Centre, which was built using steel girders from Japan&#x27;s exhibit at Osaka Expo.

The campus also features the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts: a performing arts center containing the Chan Shun Concert Hall, Telus Studio Theatre and the Royal Bank Cinema. It is often the site of convocation ceremonies and the filming location for the 4400 Center on the television show &quot;The 4400&quot;, as well as the Madacorp entrance set on &quot;Kyle XY&quot;. It has also been featured as the Cloud 9 Ballroom in the re-imagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (Season 1, Episode 11: &quot;Colonial Day&quot;).

Since the mid-1980s UBC has worked with property developers to build several large residential developments throughout UBC&#x27;s campus. Such developments include: Chancellor Place, Hampton Place, Hawthorn Place and Wesbrook Village.

===Okanagan===

The Okanagan Campus was established in 2005 on what was previously the North Kelowna Campus of Okanagan University College, next to Kelowna International Airport. It was founded in partnership with the Syilx Okanagan Nation and it lies on their ancestral and forcefully taken territory.

The campus had a 2019 enrollment of 10,708 undergraduate and graduate students and has its own academic Senate. UBC Okanagan offers 62 undergraduate and 19 graduate programs in a diversity of disciplines including Arts, Science, Fine Arts, Engineering, Nursing, Human Kinetics, Education, Management, Social Work and Interdisciplinary Graduate Studies. UBC&#x27;s Faculty of Medicine delivers medical doctor training through the Southern Medical Program with facilities at UBC Okanagan and a clinical academic campus at Kelowna General Hospital.

From 2005 through 2012, the Okanagan campus completed a $450million expansion with construction of several residential, teaching and research buildings. The expansion included the Charles E. Fipke Centre for Innovative Research, University Centre, the Engineering Management and Education building, the Arts and Sciences Centre, Reichwald Health Sciences Centre and several new student residence buildings. The Commons building was opened in 2019 as an expansion to the Library building. Two additional student housing facilities, Skeena and Nechako, opened in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

In 2010, UBC Okanagan campus grew from 105 ha. to 208.6 ha. Like the Point Grey campus, the Okanagan campus attracts Canadian and international students.

UBC Okanagan is currently expanding its campus to downtown Kelowna. Construction on the 43 storey downtown campus building was approved in August 2023 and is expected to be completed by 2027. Eight storeys will be used as academic space for health programs, as the campus will be in close proximity to Interior Health offices and Kelowna General Hospital. The building will also include public engagement spaces, an art gallery, cafes, retailers and 473 rental housing units.

===Libraries, archives and galleries===

The UBC Library, which has 7.8million volumes, 2.1million e-books, more than 370,000 e-journals and more than 700,000 items in locally produced digital collections, is Canada&#x27;s second-largest academic library. From 2014 to 2015, there were more than 3.8million on-campus visits and over 9.5million visits to its website.

The library has fifteen branches and divisions across the UBC Vancouver and UBC Okanagan campuses.

The former Main Library underwent construction and was renamed the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre. Opened in April 2008, the Learning Centre incorporates the centre heritage block of the old Main Library with two new expansion wings and features an automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS), the first of its kind in Canada.

UBC has a number of different collections that have been donated and acquired. Major General Victor Odlum CB, CMG, DSO, VD donated his library of 10,000 books, which has been housed in &quot;the Rockwoods Centre Library&quot; of the UBC Library since 1963. After Videomatica&#x27;s 2011 closure, UBC and SFU acquired their $1.7-million collection. UBC received about 28,000 movie DVDs, 4,000 VHS titles and 900 Blu-ray discs which are housed at UBC Library&#x27;s Koerner branch on the Vancouver campus. In 2014, renowned art collector and antiques specialist, Uno Langmann, donated the Uno Langmann Family Collection of B.C. Photographs, which consists of more than 18,000 rare and unique early photographs from the 1850s to the 1970s. It is considered the premiere private collection of early provincial photos and an important illustrated history of early photographic methods. In 2016, the library acquired one of the world&#x27;s most rare and extraordinary books, the Kelmscott &quot;Chaucer&quot; from 1896. The book was printed in a limited edition of only 438 copies, but there are only 48 copies in the world with its particular type of binding.

The Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery at UBC is mandated to research, exhibit, collect, publish, educate and develop programs in the field of contemporary art and in contemporary approaches to the practice of art history and criticism. The Belkin maintains and manages the university&#x27;s art collection of over 5,000 objects, including the Outdoor Art Collection and an archive of over 30,000 items. Works from the permanent collection and archives, with an emphasis on recent acquisitions, are exhibited on an annual basis and are also used by other institutions for research and loans. The Belkin has an active publication program and participates in programming that includes lectures, tours, concerts and symposia related to art history, criticism and curating.

===Sustainability===
====CIRS building====
The University of British Columbia CIRS building is designed to be net positive in four environmental aspects. It uses energy obtained from the Earth and Ocean Sciences (EOSC) Building to heat itself, which wastes around 900 megawatts due to ten air changes every hour. The building&#x27;s wood holds nearly 600 tons of carbon, offsetting more carbon than its construction and maintenance created. Sustainable features include a water supply sourced entirely from rainwater, an on-site sewage treatment facility converting waste into reusable water and compost, and the use of wood from pine beetle-killed trees, minimizing the need for logging.

The building relies primarily on solar energy for electricity, and all areas use natural lighting during the day. These green technologies and sustainable operating practices reduce the building&#x27;s ecological footprint and enhance the well-being of its occupants.

====Water conservation initiatives====
For over 20 years, UBC has implemented water consumption policies through two initiatives, ECOTrek and UBC Renew. ECOTrek is Canada&#x27;s largest sustainability project, which involved a massive water and energy-saving initiative, rebuilding almost 300 academic buildings at UBC. This project achieved a World Clean Energy nomination. The water management aspect included updates to toilets, urinals, basins, and water-cooled equipment, along with the installation of steam and water meters to monitor and quantify water consumption across campus.

The UBC Renew project focuses on renovating aging institutional buildings instead of demolishing and constructing new ones. Demolition can have significant environmental impacts, such as soil pollution, increased air pollutants, and higher water consumption. Renovating old buildings helps save large volumes of water and reduces energy costs.

The university retrofitted its facilities with composting toilets; however, these did not function correctly. As of 2019, UBC consumed about four billion liters of water a year, which could fill 1,600 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

====Community efforts====
Beyond the UBC sustainability team, a student-driven initiative is taking place in making a bottled-water free campus in hopes of reducing bottled water on campus and to encourage students to engage in environmentally friendly behaviors. Production of bottled water puts strain on the environment and increases landfill space. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature 2001 report, about 1.5million tons of plastic is used for bottling 89billion liters of water each year.

==Governance and academics==

UBC&#x27;s administration, as mandated by the University Act, is composed of a chancellor, convocation, board, senate and faculties of the university. The board of governors manages property and revenue, while the senate manages the university&#x27;s academic operation. Both are composed of faculty and students who are elected to the position. Degrees and diplomas are conferred by the convocation, which is composed of alumni, administrators and faculty, with a quorum of twenty members. UBC also has a president, who is the university&#x27;s chief executive officer and a member of the senate, board of governors, convocation and also serves as vice chancellor. The president of the university is responsible for managing the academic operation of the university, including recommending appointments, calling meetings of faculties and establishing committees.

===Faculties and schools===
UBC&#x27;s academic activity is organized into &quot;faculties&quot; and &quot;schools&quot;. UBC has twelve faculties at its Vancouver campus and seven at its Okanagan campus. UBC Vancouver has two academic colleges: Interdisciplinary Studies and Health Disciplines, while UBC Okanagan has a College of Graduate Studies. At the Vancouver campus, the Faculty of Arts, which dates back to the 1915 Fairview Campus, is the largest faculty with twenty departments and schools. With the split of the Faculty of Arts and Science in 1964, the Faculty of Science is the second largest faculty with nine departments. The Sauder School of Business is UBC&#x27;s Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration. The School of Architecture offers a program accredited by the Canadian Architectural Certification Board at the bachelor level (B.Arch.) and the master&#x27;s level (M.Arch.). , a new school was created: UBC Vancouver School of Economics in conjunction with the Sauder School of Business. The university&#x27;s first inter-faculty school, the School of Biomedical Engineering, was established in 2017 as a partnership between the Faculties of Applied Science and Medicine.

In 2014, UBC created a new &quot;International Programs&quot; designation separate from the traditional definition of a faculty. To accompany this designation, the university created Vantage College to allow international students who do not meet the English language requirements for general admission to enter the university&#x27;s transition program.

====Dual undergraduate degree with Sciences Po====
The dual degree program is a highly selective program in which undergraduate students earn two Bachelor of Arts degrees from both Sciences Po in France and UBC in four years. Previously, students could earn one Bachelor of Arts and one Bachelor of Commerce (Sauder School of Business); however, this program was discontinued with the last student intake occurring in September 2017. Currently, students in the dual degree program can only earn a Bachelor of Arts degree from UBC, along with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Sciences Po, which can both be in different majors pertaining to the social sciences. Students spend two years at one of three Sciences Po regional campuses in France (Le Havre, Menton, or Reims), each of which is devoted to a particular region of the world. After two years, students matriculate at UBC. Graduates are guaranteed admission to a Sciences Po graduate program within one-year of graduation.

===Reputation===

The University of British Columbia has ranked in a number of post-secondary rankings. In the 2022 &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; rankings, the university ranked 44th in the world and second in Canada. The 2024 &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; ranked the University 34th in the world and third in Canada. The 2024 &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; ranked the University 41st in the world and second in Canada. In the 2022–23 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global University Ranking&quot;, the university ranked 35th in the world and second in Canada. The Canadian-based &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine ranked the University of British Columbia third in their 2023 Canadian Medical Doctoral University category and in their 2023 reputation survey. The university was ranked in spite of having opted out – along with several other universities in Canada – of participating in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; graduate survey since 2006. In &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s 2011 global university rankings, the university was ranked eighth among institutions outside the United States and second in Canada (after the University of Toronto).

Along with academic and research-based rankings, the university has also been ranked by publications that evaluate the employment prospects of its graduates. In the &quot;Times Higher Education&#x27;s&quot; 2022 global employability ranking, the university ranked 36th in the world and third in Canada.

=== International partnerships ===
UBC students can study abroad for a semester or a year at over 200 partner institutions.

=== Enrollment ===
The mean admission average during the 2023–24 school year for domestic first-year students was 89–91 per cent. The acceptance rate for domestic applications in 2013 was 50.4 per cent, of which 57.1 per cent enrolled. In 2014/15, UBC employed 3,270 full-time Faculty members, 10,942 non-faculty members and 8,031 students. It reported 871 unpaid employees.

====Vancouver enrollment====
University of British Columbia has a total of 72,585 students across both campuses. International students, amounting to 20,237, make up 28% of the university&#x27;s student population. There are 2,303 indigenous students, making up 3.2% of the student population.
===Research===

The University of British Columbia is a member of Universitas 21, an international association of research-led institutions and the only Canadian member of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, a consortium of 42 leading research universities in the Pacific Rim. In 2017, the University of British Columbia had the second-largest sponsored research income (external sources of funding) out of any Canadian university, totaling C$577 million. In the same year, the university&#x27;s faculty averaged a sponsored research income of $249,900, the eighth highest in the country, while graduate students averaged a sponsored research income of $55,200.

The university has been ranked on several bibliometric university rankings, which uses citation analysis to evaluate the impact a university has on academic publications. In 2019, the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked UBC 27th in the world and second in Canada. The University Ranking by Academic Performance 2018–19 rankings placed the university 27th in the world and second in Canada.

The university operates and manages several research centers:
* In 1972, a consortium of the University of British Columbia and four other universities from Alberta and British Columbia established the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre. Located on Vancouver Island, the center provides year-round research facilities and technical assistance for biologists, ecologists and oceanographers. 
* The Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies is an interdisciplinary research institute for fundamental research in the Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities.
* The UBC Farm is a learning and research farm in UBC&#x27;s South Campus area. It features Saturday Farm Markets from early June until early October, selling organic produce and eggs to the community.
* TRIUMF, a laboratory specializing in particle and nuclear physics, is also situated at the university. The name was formerly an acronym for Tri-University Meson Facility, but TRIUMF is now owned and operated by a consortium of eleven Canadian universities. The consortium runs TRIUMF through a contribution of funds from the National Research Council of Canada and makes TRIUMF&#x27;s facilities available to Canadian scientists and to scientists from around the world.
* BC Centre on Substance Use (BCCSU) and UBC have established &quot;Professorships in Cannabis Science&quot; in 2018 following Canada&#x27;s legalization of cannabis.
* The Centre for the Study of Democratic Institutions is a research institute for the teaching and study of innovation in democratic practice and institutions. Established in 2002, the center conducts research and teaching in cooperation with scholars, public officials, NGOs and students. The center is formally housed in the UBC School of Public Policy and Global Affairs (SPPGA) and operates in association with faculty in the UBC Department of Political Science. It was initially funded from the Merilees Chair through a donation by Gail and Stephen Jarislowsky.
* The Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute, one of three Canadian research institutes focused on quantum materials and technology research, was established in 2015 with the support of the Canada First Excellence Research Fund and a donation from Stewart Blusson.

In 2017, UBC inked a $3 million research agreement with Huawei for big data and fuel cell technology. The university refused to release the agreement without an access to information request.

===Indigenous===
UBC&#x27;s Longhouse is the university&#x27;s centre for Indigenous activities. The university has an associate dean of Indigenous Education and has developed a governing board and senate policies as well as Aboriginal governed councils within the university structure. UBC offers degrees in First Nations and Indigenous Studies through a program in the Arts Faculty, and a Chinook Diploma Program in the Sauder School of Business; it also runs the Chinook Summer Biz Camp, to foster entrepreneurship among First Nations and Métis high school students. It hosts a Bridge Through Sport Program, Summer Science Program, Native Youth Program and Cedar Day Camp and After school Program. Its First Nations Forestry Initiatives were developed in partnership with specific Aboriginal communities to meet their needs in their more remote areas.

==Finances==
In 2012–13, UBC&#x27;s budget exceeded $2billion and the university posted balanced financial results for the fourth consecutive year through strategic revenue diversification, careful management of assets and a continued focus on fundraising for projects across the university. In the 2024–25 budget, government grants account for approximately 40 per cent of total revenues. 

===Tuition===
Tuition fees vary significantly between Canadian citizens (and permanent residents) and international students. In addition, for both undergraduate and graduate programs, tuition rates vary among the university&#x27;s faculties. Students must also pay for various living expenses such as housing, food and health care. , these expenses were estimated at around $13,000 CAD per academic year.

====Undergraduate tuition====
UBC tuition for 2012 was $4,700 before adding other mandatory administrative fees for a Canadian student in a basic 30-unit program, though various programs cost from $3,406 to $9,640. Tuition for international students is significantly higher (2.3–4.6 times higher than domestic students). In 2012, tuition for international students ranged from $16,245 CAD to $25,721 CAD.

In 2001–02, UBC had one of the lowest undergraduate tuition rates in Canada, at an average of $2,181 CAD per year for a full-time program due to a government-instituted tuition freeze.

In 2001, the BC Liberal party defeated the NDP in British Columbia and lifted the tuition freeze. In 2002–03 undergraduate and graduate tuition rose by an average of 30% and up to 40% in some faculties. This has led to better facilities, but also to student unrest and contributed to a teaching assistant union strike.

UBC again increased tuition by 30% in the 2003–04 year, again by approximately 15% in the 2004–05 season and 2% in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 years. Increases were lower than expected because, in the 2005 Speech from the Throne, the government announced tuition increases would be capped to inflation. In 2006–07, the Canadian average undergraduate tuition fee was $4,347 and the BC average was $4,960. In 2014, the board of governors passed a one-time 10% tuition increase for all new incoming international students. In December 2015, UBC&#x27;s board of governors passed a motion increasing international tuition by more than 46.8% for the academic years 2016–17, 2017–18, 2018–2019. This announcement was met with indignation by many of the university&#x27;s students as this was the second major increase in international tuition in less than a year, taking total international student tuition fee increases to above 60% within 4 years (minimum international tuition will be bench marked at $35,071 CAD in the year 2018–19).

====Graduate tuition====
In the academic year 2019/2020, graduate programs assess tuition fees that vary significantly, depending on the program and the student&#x27;s citizenship. International students without external funding that meet the general eligibility criteria will be supported with guaranteed funding of up to $3,200 per year. Tuition for professional Master&#x27;s programs varies.

==Student life==

===Student representation===
The Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia, or AMS, represents UBC undergraduate students within the Vancouver campus. The society&#x27;s mandate is to improve the quality of educational, social and personal lives of UBC students. The AMS lobbies the UBC administration on behalf of the student body, provides services such as the AMS/GSS Health and Dental Plan, supports and administers student clubs and maintains the Student Union Building (aka SUB) and the services it houses. A constituency (undergraduate society) exists within each school and faculty of the university and acts as the subsidiary of the AMS within those schools and faculties.

The Graduate Student Society (GSS), which operates as an independent entity, represents graduate students. A council representing each graduate program and an executive elected by graduate students as a whole governs the GSS.

The university also has elected student representatives sitting on, as voting members, the board of governors (three student representatives) and the academic senate (18 student representatives), as laid out in the British Columbia University Act. Although the university is the official body that elects the students, the university delegates these representative elections to the AMS.

On the Okanagan Campus, the Students&#x27; Union Okanagan, or UBCSUO, is the elected representation of the student body. Composed of a board of directors and executive team, the UBCSUO lobbies the administration and provincial government on behalf of the student body, manages the student health and dental plan, as well as hosts social programming throughout the year. The Student Union Offices are located within the University Centre Building. In the wake of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the SUO initiated the Emergency Bursary Program which supported UBC students with nearly $1,000,000 in emergency funding.

===Student demographics===
In the 2020–21 academic year, females made up 57 per cent of UBC Vancouver&#x27;s student body and 53 per cent of UBC Okanagan&#x27;s student body.

===Student facilities===
The heart of student activity at UBC Vancouver is the centrally located Student Union Building (commonly referred to as &quot;The Nest&quot;), which houses offices of many AMS student clubs, over a dozen restaurants and cafes, a pub (commonly referred to as &quot;The Gallery&quot;), a nightclub (&quot;The Pit&quot;), the 425-seat Norman Bouchard Memorial Theatre (&quot;The Norm Theatre&quot;), several shops and a post office. The AMS runs the majority of the SUB&#x27;s outlets and shops; however, UBC Food Services&#x27; recent addition of major corporate outlets has generated controversy. The SUB Art Gallery contains mostly students&#x27; works. An underground bus loop to replace the &quot;Grassy Knoll&quot; beside the SUB did not receive funding by Translink.
As a result, the administration has cancelled the bus loop project, although the rest of the renovations of the University Boulevard Neighborhood are still under consideration.

On June 1, 2015, the new Student Union Building—called the AMS Student Nest, or simply &quot;the Nest&quot;—opened to students, largely replacing and extending the old SUB in functionality. The Nest, built for $107million, is much larger than its predecessor, and has numerous amenities including a performance centre, an art exhibition space, a large ballroom, a three-storey climbing wall, radio broadcast facilities, a daycare, and a 10,740 square foot rooftop garden and public space with a water feature and outdoor seating. Many of the restaurants as well as the Pit Pub have moved to the Nest under their original name or with new names. AMS Student Nest was designed by B+H Architects in collaboration with DIALOG, opened on June 1, 2015, on UBC&#x27;s Vancouver campus. The building has an area of 23 700m² with a capacity of 300 people. The structure of the building was worked on by RJC Engineers using primarily wood and steel construction.
Other student facilities on campus include the Ladha Science Student Centre (funded through a donation from Abdul Ladha, a levy on Science undergraduate students, the VP Students and the dean of Science) and the Meekison Arts Student Space in the Faculty of Art&#x27;s Buchanan D building. The UBC Bookstore&#x27;s locations on the Vancouver campus: the main store at 6200 University Boulevard and a store at Sauder School of Business join the stores at the Okanagan and Robson Square Campuses in offering a variety of products and services. The bookstores return a dividend to UBC each year, which is re-invested in the campus or in student and community organizations.

===Greek organizations===
UBC&#x27;s 19 Greek organizations make up Canada&#x27;s largest and most active Greek system. The Alma Mater Society recognizes an Inter Fraternal Council (IFC) as a club and weekly meetings of the fraternities under IFC take place at their respective fraternity houses. There are eleven fraternities on campus, the first of which was Zeta Psi, in January 1926. 

UBC was ranked eighth among Canada&#x27;s top party schools by the website &quot;Ask Men&quot;.

===Residences===


The UBC Point Grey campus has a resident population of about 10,041 students who live in an unincorporated area, outside the City of Vancouver known as Electoral Area A within and partly administered by Metro Vancouver. Neighboring the University Endowment Lands, on-campus residential services are provided by the Province of BC and by UBC. Emergency Planning is administered by Metro Vancouver. Because UBC is not in a municipality, there is no mayor, council, or other democratic municipal representation for on-campus residents, although residents can vote for the director of Electoral Area A. British Columbia&#x27;s Residential Tenancy Act does not protect UBC residents because university accommodations for students and employees are exempt.

, there are three dormitory style residences on campus, primarily for first and second-year students: Totem Park, Place Vanier and Orchard Commons.

Students also have suite-style residence options on the Point Grey campus. The Gage Towers consist of three 17-floor towers.

Brock Commons Tallwood House opened in 2017, becoming the tallest mass timber building in the world. Brock Commons South building finished completion and became open for students in June 2024.

===Athletics===

The University of British Columbia&#x27;s sports teams are called the Thunderbirds. The Thunderbirds participate in the U Sports Canada West Universities Athletic Association for most varsity sports. However, several varsity teams at UBC compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. , UBC considered joining the NCAA Division II. With a long history of competing in sports, the Thunderbirds have garnered a number of championships. In particular, the women swimmers who had represented UBC had brought back 22 conference championships and 16 national championships.
The University of British Columbia has a number of athletic facilities open to both their varsity teams as well as to their students. The stadium with the largest seating capacity at UBC is the Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre. The Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre is home to the varsity ice hockey teams and was also used as a venue for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Other facilities at UBC include Thunderbird Stadium, home to the university&#x27;s football and soccer varsity teams, UBC Aquatic Centre, home to the university&#x27;s swimming teams, the War Memorial Gymnasium, home to the university&#x27;s basketball and volleyball varsity teams and Thunderbird Park, home to the university&#x27;s many other outdoor varsity teams.

The university has also had a long history of sending a number of students to represent their countries at the Olympics. Since having its first athlete sent to the Olympics in 1928, a total of 231 individuals from UBC have represented their respective countries at the Olympics. The total number of individual medals athletes from UBC had won was 61, with 19 gold, 21 silver and 24 bronze. The majority of these medals won had come from the sport of rowing.

====Marching band====
UBC&#x27;s marching band, the Thunderbird Marching Band, was founded in September 2012 and is entirely student-run. The band performs at various Thunderbirds football, basketball, rugby and hockey games, as well as other campus events. It is the only university-level marching band in Western Canada.

====Fight songs====
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation and athletic games are: &quot;Hail, U.B.C&quot; with words and music by Harold King, &quot;High on Olympus&quot; with words by D. C. Morton and music by J. C. F. Haeffner. and &quot;Hail, UBC!&quot; (2009) with words and music by Steve Chatman.

===Campus events ===

A small number of large-scale, campus-wide events occur annually at UBC which are organized by university institutions, the AMS and student constituencies of various faculties and departments. Additionally, a number of unofficial traditions exist at UBC: jumping from the Aquatic Centre&#x27;s 10-metre diving board late at night and repainting the Engineering cairn so as to advertise other clubs.
Several group athletic events take place at UBC every year. Storm the Wall is an intramural relay race put on by UBC Recreation in April, culminating in the climbing of a wall. Day of the Longboat is an intramural event put on at the end of September/early October by UBC Recreation. It is a major voyageur canoe race with teams competing in a 2 km paddle around the waters of Jericho Sailing Centre. The program is operated by over 120 volunteer students and staff who are responsible for operating every aspect of this program. UBC Recreation&#x27;s student administrators fill various roles including event planning, sport officiating, public relations and building supervision.

Faculty constituencies, such as the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) and Science Undergraduate Society (SUS), hold events annually. Many of the major constituencies, such as for Arts, Science and Engineering, hold their own faculty weeks to celebrate their faculties. The events may include keynote speeches, merchandise sales and dances. Arts County Fair was an annual concert and party on the last day of classes in April, put on by the AUS and occurring at Thunderbird Stadium. Past headliners have included Sam Roberts, The New Pornographers and Metric. Due to increasing financial difficulties (mostly resulting from mounting security and related costs) the AUS announced they would not continue the event in 2008. In its place, the Alma Mater Society of UBC hosted the AMS Block Party to celebrate the end of classes.

During the Spring exam season, the Ski &amp; Board Club organizes the Undie Run, a charity event that encourages people to donate their clothes to the Big Brothers &amp; Sisters organization in Vancouver. Students meet at the Student Union Building, remove the clothes they are going to donate and then run around campus in their underwear. Students run through places like the Irvin K. Barber Centre and Place Vanier Residence before ending at the Martha Piper Plaza fountain.

To celebrate the beginning of classes, UBC Orientations organizes several events for first-year students, such as Imagine UBC, GALA and UBC Jump Start. Imagine UBC is an orientation day and pep rally for first-year undergraduate students that replaces the first day of class after Labour Day at UBC Vancouver.

====Model United Nations====
In March 2012, UBC was the partner Host University of the Harvard World Model United Nations Conference (WorldMUN 2012 Vancouver). As the world&#x27;s largest student-organized Model UN conference, this was also the largest student conference to have ever been organized by UBC and the largest student conference on Canadian soil. There were 2,200 student delegates and nearly 200 faculty advisors from 270 universities from over 60 countries. The organizing committee amassed over 500 student volunteers from across the UBC campus and the local student community to execute the week-long event.

=== Engineering student pranks ===
UBC engineering students have a history of performing pranks which attract national and international attention. UBC does not condone student pranks, nor publicize them (unlike the California Institute of Technology or Massachusetts Institute of Technology; see hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Notable incidents include the hanging of the shell of a VW Bug from the underside of the Lions Gate Bridge. Those responsible for the Lions Gate prank have never been caught, nor has it been discovered how the prank was performed.

==Notable people==


Throughout UBC&#x27;s history, faculty, alumni and former students have played prominent roles in many different fields. Many UBC alumni and faculty have gone on to win awards including eight Nobel Prizes and 74 Rhodes Scholarships.

Former alumni have won Nobel Prizes: Robert Mundell (Economic Sciences) who graduated from the UBC Department of Economics and Bertram Brockhouse (Physics).

<text>Donald Alfred Davie, FBA (17 July 1922 – 18 September 1995) was an English Movement poet, and literary critic. His poems in general are philosophical and abstract, but often evoke various landscapes.

==Biography==

Davie was born in Barnsley, Yorkshire, a son of Baptist parents. He began his education at Barnsley Holgate Grammar School, and then attended St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, to study English on a scholarship, beating his future Movement associate Kingsley Amis in the process. His studies there were interrupted by service during the war in the Royal Navy in Arctic Russia, where he taught himself the language. In the last year of the war, in Devon, he married Doreen John. He returned to Cambridge in 1946 and received his B.A., M.A. and PhD. He was a fellow of Trinity College Dublin from 1954 to 1957, and then a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge from 1959 until 1964. In 1964 Davie was made the first Professor of English at the new University of Essex. He taught English there until 1968, when he moved to Stanford University, succeeding Yvor Winters. In 1978, he relocated to Vanderbilt University, where he taught until his retirement in 1988.

He often wrote on the technique of poetry, both in books such as &quot;Purity of Diction in English Verse&quot;, and in smaller articles such as &quot;Some Notes on Rhythm in Verse&quot;. Davie&#x27;s criticism and poetry are both characterized by his interest in modernist and pre-modernist techniques. Davie argued that &quot;there is no necessary connection between the poetic vocation on the one hand, and on the other exhibitionism, egoism, and licence&quot;. He writes eloquently and sympathetically about British modernist poetry in &quot;Under Briggflatts&quot;, while in &quot;Thomas Hardy and British Poetry&quot; he defends a pre-modernist verse tradition. Much of Davie&#x27;s poetry has been compared to that of the traditionalist Philip Larkin, but other works are more influenced by Ezra Pound. He is featured in the &quot;Oxford Book of Contemporary Verse&quot; (1980).

In the 1960s, Davie was a conduit between the Cambridge poets and the Black Mountain poets. Irish literary critic Denis Donoghue described Davie&#x27;s poetry as &quot;an enforced choice between masturbation and happily wedded love&quot; bereft of drama.

Davie delivered the 1990 Warton Lecture on English Poetry. He died of cancer at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter in September 1995.

Writer Calvin Bedient discusses Davie&#x27;s style in his book &quot;Eight Contemporary Poets&quot;. He informs readers of Davie&#x27;s specific thoughts by including quotes. According to Bedient, Davie said that &quot;To make poetry out of moral commonplace, a poet has to make it clear that he speaks not in his own voice (that would be impertinent) but as the spokesman of a social tradition.&quot; It follows that Davie&#x27;s voice is unique compared to the modern movement that was happening during his life. His work does not epitomize contemporary poetry like that of many of his counterparts, but rather it calls upon a certain nostalgia for the past. Davie&#x27;s work is distinctly &quot;English&quot; sounding, as he uses English phrases and traditional language. In particular, his work often reminds readers of the late Augustan poets, whose work is sophisticated and polished. He writes in a similar style to Philip Larkin and Ted Hughes, who were both alive during Davie&#x27;s lifetime. In addition, Davie writes without fear of criticism. He uses a strong and confident voice to assert his thoughts and musings.

<text>Mathematical physics refers to the development of mathematical methods for application to problems in physics. The &quot;Journal of Mathematical Physics&quot; defines the field as &quot;the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories&quot;. An alternative definition would also include those mathematics that are inspired by physics, known as physical mathematics.

== Scope ==
There are several distinct branches of mathematical physics, and these roughly correspond to particular historical parts of our world.

=== Classical mechanics ===

Applying the techniques of mathematical physics to classical mechanics typically involves the rigorous, abstract, and advanced reformulation of Newtonian mechanics in terms of Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics (including both approaches in the presence of constraints). Both formulations are embodied in analytical mechanics and lead to an understanding of the deep interplay between the notions of symmetry and conserved quantities during the dynamical evolution of mechanical systems, as embodied within the most elementary formulation of Noether&#x27;s theorem. These approaches and ideas have been extended to other areas of physics, such as statistical mechanics, continuum mechanics, classical field theory, and quantum field theory. Moreover, they have provided multiple examples and ideas in differential geometry (e.g., several notions in symplectic geometry and vector bundles).

=== Partial differential equations ===

Within mathematics proper, the theory of partial differential equation, variational calculus, Fourier analysis, potential theory, and vector analysis are perhaps most closely associated with mathematical physics. These fields were developed intensively from the second half of the 18th century (by, for example, D&#x27;Alembert, Euler, and Lagrange) until the 1930s. Physical applications of these developments include hydrodynamics, celestial mechanics, continuum mechanics, elasticity theory, acoustics, thermodynamics, electricity, magnetism, and aerodynamics.

=== Quantum theory ===

The theory of atomic spectra (and, later, quantum mechanics) developed almost concurrently with some parts of the mathematical fields of linear algebra, the spectral theory of operators, operator algebras and, more broadly, functional analysis. Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics includes Schrödinger operators, and it has connections to atomic and molecular physics. Quantum information theory is another subspecialty.

=== Relativity and quantum relativistic theories ===

The special and general theories of relativity require a rather different type of mathematics. This was group theory, which played an important role in both quantum field theory and differential geometry. This was, however, gradually supplemented by topology and functional analysis in the mathematical description of cosmological as well as quantum field theory phenomena. In the mathematical description of these physical areas, some concepts in homological algebra and category theory are also important.

=== Statistical mechanics ===

Statistical mechanics forms a separate field, which includes the theory of phase transitions. It relies upon the Hamiltonian mechanics (or its quantum version) and it is closely related with the more mathematical ergodic theory and some parts of probability theory. There are increasing interactions between combinatorics and physics, in particular statistical physics.

== Usage ==
The usage of the term &quot;mathematical physics&quot; is sometimes idiosyncratic. Certain parts of mathematics that initially arose from the development of physics are not, in fact, considered parts of mathematical physics, while other closely related fields are. For example, ordinary differential equations and symplectic geometry are generally viewed as purely mathematical disciplines, whereas dynamical systems and Hamiltonian mechanics belong to mathematical physics. John Herapath used the term for the title of his 1847 text on &quot;mathematical principles of natural philosophy&quot;, the scope at that time being 
&quot;the causes of heat, gaseous elasticity, gravitation, and other great phenomena of nature&quot;.

=== Mathematical vs. theoretical physics ===
The term &quot;mathematical physics&quot; is sometimes used to denote research aimed at studying and solving problems in physics or thought experiments within a mathematically rigorous framework. In this sense, mathematical physics covers a very broad academic realm distinguished only by the blending of some mathematical aspect and theoretical physics aspect. Although related to theoretical physics, mathematical physics in this sense emphasizes the mathematical rigour of the similar type as found in mathematics.

On the other hand, theoretical physics emphasizes the links to observations and experimental physics, which often requires theoretical physicists (and mathematical physicists in the more general sense) to use heuristic, intuitive, or approximate arguments. Such arguments are not considered rigorous by mathematicians.

Such mathematical physicists primarily expand and elucidate physical theories. Because of the required level of mathematical rigour, these researchers often deal with questions that theoretical physicists have considered to be already solved. However, they can sometimes show that the previous solution was incomplete, incorrect, or simply too naïve. Issues about attempts to infer the second law of thermodynamics from statistical mechanics are examples. Other examples concern the subtleties involved with synchronisation procedures in special and general relativity (Sagnac effect and Einstein synchronisation).

The effort to put physical theories on a mathematically rigorous footing not only developed physics but also has influenced developments of some mathematical areas. For example, the development of quantum mechanics and some aspects of functional analysis parallel each other in many ways. The mathematical study of quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and quantum statistical mechanics has motivated results in operator algebras. The attempt to construct a rigorous mathematical formulation of quantum field theory has also brought about some progress in fields such as representation theory.

== Prominent mathematical physicists ==

=== Before Newton ===
There is a tradition of mathematical analysis of nature that goes back to the ancient Greeks; examples include Euclid (&quot;Optics&quot;), Archimedes (&quot;On the Equilibrium of Planes&quot;, &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot;), and Ptolemy (&quot;Optics&quot;, &quot;Harmonics&quot;). Later, Islamic and Byzantine scholars built on these works, and these ultimately were reintroduced or became available to the West in the 12th century and during the Renaissance.

In the first decade of the 16th century, amateur astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus proposed heliocentrism, and published a treatise on it in 1543. He retained the Ptolemaic idea of epicycles, and merely sought to simplify astronomy by constructing simpler sets of epicyclic orbits. Epicycles consist of circles upon circles. According to Aristotelian physics, the circle was the perfect form of motion, and was the intrinsic motion of Aristotle&#x27;s fifth element—the quintessence or universal essence known in Greek as &quot;aether&quot; for the English &quot;pure air&quot;—that was the pure substance beyond the sublunary sphere, and thus was celestial entities&#x27; pure composition. The German Johannes Kepler [1571–1630], Tycho Brahe&#x27;s assistant, modified Copernican orbits to &quot;ellipses&quot;, formalized in the equations of Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion.

An enthusiastic atomist, Galileo Galilei in his 1623 book &quot;The Assayer&quot; asserted that the &quot;book of nature is written in mathematics&quot;. His 1632 book, about his telescopic observations, supported heliocentrism. Having made use of experimentation, Galileo then refuted geocentric cosmology by refuting Aristotelian physics itself. Galileo&#x27;s 1638 book &quot;Discourse on Two New Sciences&quot; established the law of equal free fall as well as the principles of inertial motion, two central concepts of what today is known as classical mechanics. By the Galilean law of inertia as well as the principle of Galilean invariance, also called Galilean relativity, for any object experiencing inertia, there is empirical justification for knowing only that it is at &quot;relative&quot; rest or &quot;relative&quot; motion—rest or motion with respect to another object.

René Descartes developed a complete system of heliocentric cosmology anchored on the principle of vortex motion, Cartesian physics, whose widespread acceptance helped bring the demise of Aristotelian physics. Descartes used mathematical reasoning as a model for science, and developed analytic geometry, which in time allowed the plotting of locations in 3D space (Cartesian coordinates) and marking their progressions along the flow of time.

Christiaan Huygens, a talented mathematician and physicist and older contemporary of Newton, was the first to successfully idealize a physical problem by a set of mathematical parameters in &quot;Horologium Oscillatorum&quot; (1673), and the first to fully mathematize a mechanistic explanation of an unobservable physical phenomenon in &quot;Traité de la Lumière&quot; (1690). He is thus considered a forerunner of theoretical physics and one of the founders of modern mathematical physics.

=== Newtonian physics and post Newtonian ===

The prevailing framework for science in the 16th and early 17th centuries was one borrowed from Ancient Greek mathematics, where geometrical shapes formed the building blocks to describe and think about space, and time was often thought as a separate entity. With the introduction of algebra into geometry, and with it the idea of a coordinate system, time and space could now be thought as axes belonging to the same plane. This essential mathematical framework is at the base of all modern physics and used in all further mathematical frameworks developed in next centuries. 

By the middle of the 17th century, important concepts such as the fundamental theorem of calculus (proved in 1668 by Scottish mathematician James Gregory) and finding extrema and minima of functions via differentiation using Fermat&#x27;s theorem (by French mathematician Pierre de Fermat) were already known before Leibniz and Newton. Isaac Newton (1642–1727) developed calculus (although Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed similar concepts outside the context of physics) and Newton&#x27;s method to solve problems in mathematics and physics. He was extremely successful in his application of calculus and other methods to the study of motion. Newton&#x27;s theory of motion, culminating in his &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (&quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;) in 1687, modeled three Galilean laws of motion along with Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation on a framework of absolute space—hypothesized by Newton as a physically real entity of Euclidean geometric structure extending infinitely in all directions—while presuming absolute time, supposedly justifying knowledge of absolute motion, the object&#x27;s motion with respect to absolute space. The principle of Galilean invariance/relativity was merely implicit in Newton&#x27;s theory of motion. Having ostensibly reduced the Keplerian celestial laws of motion as well as Galilean terrestrial laws of motion to a unifying force, Newton achieved great mathematical rigor, but with theoretical laxity.

In the 18th century, the Swiss Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782) made contributions to fluid dynamics, and vibrating strings. The Swiss Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) did special work in variational calculus, dynamics, fluid dynamics, and other areas. Also notable was the Italian-born Frenchman, Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813) for work in analytical mechanics: he formulated Lagrangian mechanics) and variational methods. A major contribution to the formulation of Analytical Dynamics called Hamiltonian dynamics was also made by the Irish physicist, astronomer and mathematician, William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865). Hamiltonian dynamics had played an important role in the formulation of modern theories in physics, including field theory and quantum mechanics. The French mathematical physicist Joseph Fourier (1768 – 1830) introduced the notion of Fourier series to solve the heat equation, giving rise to a new approach to solving partial differential equations by means of integral transforms.

Into the early 19th century, following mathematicians in France, Germany and England had contributed to mathematical physics. The French Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827) made paramount contributions to mathematical astronomy, potential theory. Siméon Denis Poisson (1781–1840) worked in analytical mechanics and potential theory. In Germany, Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) made key contributions to the theoretical foundations of electricity, magnetism, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. In England, George Green (1793–1841) published &quot;An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism&quot; in 1828, which in addition to its significant contributions to mathematics made early progress towards laying down the mathematical foundations of electricity and magnetism.

A couple of decades ahead of Newton&#x27;s publication of a particle theory of light, the Dutch Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) developed the wave theory of light, published in 1690. By 1804, Thomas Young&#x27;s double-slit experiment revealed an interference pattern, as though light were a wave, and thus Huygens&#x27;s wave theory of light, as well as Huygens&#x27;s inference that light waves were vibrations of the luminiferous aether, was accepted. Jean-Augustin Fresnel modeled hypothetical behavior of the aether. The English physicist Michael Faraday introduced the theoretical concept of a field—not action at a distance. Mid-19th century, the Scottish James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) reduced electricity and magnetism to Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic field theory, whittled down by others to the four Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Initially, optics was found consequent of Maxwell&#x27;s field. Later, radiation and then today&#x27;s known electromagnetic spectrum were found also consequent of this electromagnetic field.

The English physicist Lord Rayleigh [1842–1919] worked on sound. The Irishmen William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865), George Gabriel Stokes (1819–1903) and Lord Kelvin (1824–1907) produced several major works: Stokes was a leader in optics and fluid dynamics; Kelvin made substantial discoveries in thermodynamics; Hamilton did notable work on analytical mechanics, discovering a new and powerful approach nowadays known as Hamiltonian mechanics. Very relevant contributions to this approach are due to his German colleague mathematician Carl Gustav Jacobi (1804–1851) in particular referring to canonical transformations. The German Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) made substantial contributions in the fields of electromagnetism, waves, fluids, and sound. In the United States, the pioneering work of Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839–1903) became the basis for statistical mechanics. Fundamental theoretical results in this area were achieved by the German Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906). Together, these individuals laid the foundations of electromagnetic theory, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics.

=== Relativistic ===

By the 1880s, there was a prominent paradox that an observer within Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic field measured it at approximately constant speed, regardless of the observer&#x27;s speed relative to other objects within the electromagnetic field. Thus, although the observer&#x27;s speed was continually lost relative to the electromagnetic field, it was preserved relative to other objects &quot;in&quot; the electromagnetic field. And yet no violation of Galilean invariance within physical interactions among objects was detected. As Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic field was modeled as oscillations of the aether, physicists inferred that motion within the aether resulted in aether drift, shifting the electromagnetic field, explaining the observer&#x27;s missing speed relative to it. The Galilean transformation had been the mathematical process used to translate the positions in one reference frame to predictions of positions in another reference frame, all plotted on Cartesian coordinates, but this process was replaced by Lorentz transformation, modeled by the Dutch Hendrik Lorentz [1853–1928].

In 1887, experimentalists Michelson and Morley failed to detect aether drift, however. It was hypothesized that motion &quot;into&quot; the aether prompted aether&#x27;s shortening, too, as modeled in the Lorentz contraction. It was hypothesized that the aether thus kept Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic field aligned with the principle of Galilean invariance across all inertial frames of reference, while Newton&#x27;s theory of motion was spared.

Austrian theoretical physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach criticized Newton&#x27;s postulated absolute space. Mathematician Jules-Henri Poincaré (1854–1912) questioned even absolute time. In 1905, Pierre Duhem published a devastating criticism of the foundation of Newton&#x27;s theory of motion. Also in 1905, Albert Einstein (1879–1955) published his special theory of relativity, newly explaining both the electromagnetic field&#x27;s invariance and Galilean invariance by discarding all hypotheses concerning aether, including the existence of aether itself. Refuting the framework of Newton&#x27;s theory—absolute space and absolute time—special relativity refers to &quot;relative space&quot; and &quot;relative time&quot;, whereby &quot;length&quot; contracts and &quot;time&quot; dilates along the travel pathway of an object.

Cartesian coordinates arbitrarily used rectilinear coordinates. Gauss, inspired by Descartes&#x27; work, introduced the curved geometry, replacing rectilinear axis by curved ones. Gauss also introduced another key tool of modern physics, the curvature. Gauss&#x27;s work was limited to two dimensions. Extending it to three or more dimensions introduced a lot of complexity, with the need of the (not yet invented) tensors. It was Riemman the one in charge to extend curved geometry to N dimensions. In 1908, Einstein&#x27;s former mathematics professor Hermann Minkowski, applied the curved geometry construction to model 3D space together with the 1D axis of time by treating the temporal axis like a fourth spatial dimension—altogether 4D spacetime—and declared the imminent demise of the separation of space and time. Einstein initially called this &quot;superfluous learnedness&quot;, but later used Minkowski spacetime with great elegance in his general theory of relativity, extending invariance to all reference frames—whether perceived as inertial or as accelerated—and credited this to Minkowski, by then deceased. General relativity replaces Cartesian coordinates with Gaussian coordinates, and replaces Newton&#x27;s claimed empty yet Euclidean space traversed instantly by Newton&#x27;s vector of hypothetical gravitational force—an instant action at a distance—with a gravitational &quot;field&quot;. The gravitational field is Minkowski spacetime itself, the 4D topology of Einstein aether modeled on a Lorentzian manifold that &quot;curves&quot; geometrically, according to the Riemann curvature tensor. The concept of Newton&#x27;s gravity: &quot;two masses attract each other&quot; replaced by the geometrical argument: &quot;mass transform curvatures of spacetime and free falling particles with mass move along a geodesic curve in the spacetime&quot; (Riemannian geometry already existed before the 1850s, by mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Bernhard Riemann in search for intrinsic geometry and non-Euclidean geometry.), in the vicinity of either mass or energy. (Under special relativity—a special case of general relativity—even massless energy exerts gravitational effect by its mass equivalence locally &quot;curving&quot; the geometry of the four, unified dimensions of space and time.)

=== Quantum ===
Another revolutionary development of the 20th century was quantum theory, which emerged from the seminal contributions of Max Planck (1856–1947) (on black-body radiation) and Einstein&#x27;s work on the photoelectric effect. In 1912, a mathematician Henri Poincare published &quot;Sur la théorie des quanta&quot;. He introduced the first non-naïve definition of quantization in this paper. The development of early quantum physics followed by a heuristic framework devised by Arnold Sommerfeld (1868–1951) and Niels Bohr (1885–1962), but this was soon replaced by the quantum mechanics developed by Max Born (1882–1970), Louis de Broglie (1892–1987), Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976), Paul Dirac (1902–1984), Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961), Satyendra Nath Bose (1894–1974), and Wolfgang Pauli (1900–1958). This revolutionary theoretical framework is based on a probabilistic interpretation of states, and evolution and measurements in terms of self-adjoint operators on an infinite-dimensional vector space. That is called Hilbert space (introduced by mathematicians David Hilbert (1862–1943), Erhard Schmidt (1876–1959) and Frigyes Riesz (1880–1956) in search of generalization of Euclidean space and study of integral equations), and rigorously defined within the axiomatic modern version by John von Neumann in his celebrated book &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot;, where he built up a relevant part of modern functional analysis on Hilbert spaces, the spectral theory (introduced by David Hilbert who investigated quadratic forms with infinitely many variables. Many years later, it had been revealed that his spectral theory is associated with the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. He was surprised by this application.) in particular. Paul Dirac used algebraic constructions to produce a relativistic model for the electron, predicting its magnetic moment and the existence of its antiparticle, the positron.

<text>In mathematics and signal processing, the time domain is a representation of how a signal, function, or data set varies with time. It is used for the analysis of mathematical functions, physical signals or time series of economic or environmental data.

In the time domain, the independent variable is time, and the dependent variable is the value of the signal. This contrasts with the frequency domain, where the signal is represented by its constituent frequencies. For continuous-time signals, the value of the signal is defined for all real numbers representing time. For discrete-time signals, the value is known at discrete, often equally-spaced, time intervals. It is commonly visualized using a graph where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents the signal&#x27;s value. An oscilloscope is a common tool used to visualize real-world signals in the time domain. 

Though most precisely referring to time in physics, the term &quot;time domain&quot; may occasionally informally refer to position in space when dealing with spatial frequencies, as a substitute for the more precise term &quot;spatial domain&quot;.

== Origin of term ==
The use of the contrasting terms &quot;time domain&quot; and &quot;frequency domain&quot; developed in U.S. communication engineering in the late 1940s, with the terms appearing together without definition by 1950. When an analysis uses the second or one of its multiples as a unit of measurement, then it is in the time domain. When analysis concerns the reciprocal units such as Hertz, then it is in the frequency domain.

<doc id="173424" wikidata="Q1060715" url="?curid=173424" title="Soulcalibur (video game)">
<text>is a 1998 fighting game developed and published by Namco. It is the second game in the &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; series, preceded by &quot;Soul Edge&quot;. Originally released in arcades on July 30, 1998, it ran on the Namco System 12 hardware, and was ported to the Dreamcast console in 1999 with new features and improved graphics.

The game centers on the pursuit of the legendary weapon known as Soul Edge, now in the possession of a warrior known as Nightmare, who slaughters countless people to satisfy the blade&#x27;s bloodlust. Other warriors pursue him either to claim the weapon for themselves or to destroy it, end his mass murder, and free him of its curse. Developed closely with Namco&#x27;s &quot;Tekken&quot; development team, it is one of the few home console ports that outdid their arcade parent performance-wise. The title brought many innovations to the fighting game genre that include a heavy emphasis on weapons and a unique eight-way movement system.

&quot;Soulcalibur&quot; received unanimous critical applause upon release; it is the second-highest-rated video game of all time, with a 98 rating on Metacritic. It won the majority of Game of the Year awards in its respective year, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest fighting games and one of the greatest video games ever made, topping numerous &quot;best of&quot; lists in years following. The North American home version was released as a launch game for the Dreamcast, playing a part in its successful launch. &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; became available as a downloadable title on the Xbox 360&#x27;s Xbox Live Marketplace in July 2008 and it is forward compatible with the Xbox One.

==Gameplay==
One of the biggest innovations introduced by &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; to the gameplay system of its predecessor, &quot;Soul Edge&quot;, is the eight-way run. Previous 3D fighters had only limited movement along the third axis, with sidesteps and rolls providing useful but unsustained lateral movement. In &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;, simply holding down a joystick direction causes the character to move in that direction, giving the player a sense of freedom and deepening the strategy of the game.

&quot;Soulcalibur&quot; also features &quot;forgiving buffering&quot;, allowing players to enter an input for one move before their characters have finished recovering from their previous move, which makes executing a quick succession of moves easier (other fighting games such as the &quot;Tekken&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series have relatively strict buffering requirements, meaning expert timing is required to pull off many combinations, but &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; features much more lenient timing to successfully execute a buffer). Finally, the Guard Impact offensive blocking maneuver shown in &quot;Soul Edge&quot; has been given a deeper range of techniques, allowing players to push back or redirect attacks past themselves as well as swatting away an opponent&#x27;s weapon to stun them.

==Characters==
&quot;Soulcalibur&quot; was originally planned to be a dramatic overhaul, with all new characters apart from Mitsurugi from &quot;Soul Edge&quot;. However, nine of the 11 characters from &quot;Soul Edge&quot; ended up carrying over to &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; by the time the roster was finalized in the Dreamcast version (Cervantes, Hwang, Seong Mi-na, Mitsurugi, Rock, Siegfried, Sophitia, Taki, Voldo), with an additional ten new characters joining the ranks (in the South Korean version of the game, Mitsurugi was replaced by an English-Japanese swordsman named Arthur). Cervantes exclusively appears outside original arcade version, in additions to a playable version of the final boss character, Inferno. The arcade version featured a staggered Time Release system for hidden characters akin to the Tekken series as well as codes that could be entered on the Namco website.

As with many fighting games, many of the new characters were heavily styled after existing characters from the franchise. For example, new character Maxi has a fighting style and move set influenced by &quot;Soul Edge&#x27;s&quot; Li Long (the only of the original starting characters not to return). In fact, &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; only added one original playing style, belonging to Ivy. New characters Xianghua, Maxi, Yoshimitsu, Astaroth, Kilik, Nightmare (re-introduced from &quot;Soul Edge&quot; as a regular character), and Lizardman were based upon existing characters Hwang, Li Long, Mitsurugi, Rock, Seong Mi-na, Siegfried, and Sophitia, respectively. Consequently, Namco has been working since &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; to gradually separate the individual styles of the characters in order to make each one unique.

==Plot==
The mystical sword of the legends, the &quot;Soul Edge&quot;, ended up in the hands of the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon of Spain. For the next 25 years he stayed dormant on the remnants of a Spanish port town taking the souls of those who reached him during their search for the sword. Like Soul Edge this game begins in the year 1583. The reign of terror of Cervantes was soon to start but through the joined efforts of Greek divine warrior Sophitia Alexandra and Japanese ninja Taki he was stopped and killed with one of the twin Soul Edge blades shattered in the process. As it was about to tear itself apart a young German knight Siegfried Schtauffen approached the port town and battled Cervantes whose corpse had been momentarily reanimated through the will of the Soul Edge. After emerging victorious Siegfried&#x27;s attention turned to the sword. At the moment he took the hilt of the cursed blade Soul Edge released a bright column of light into the sky. This was known as the &quot;Evil Seed&quot; which was bound to bring calamity and death in its wake.

Three years after those events, Soul Edge uses Siegfried as its host, and now Siegfried is Nightmare, a knight wearing azure armor and sporting a hideously deformed right arm. Europe plunges into a vortex of slaughters as he and his followers claim souls to strengthen the blade in its weakened state. Unknown to them a group of warriors met on their journey to stop Soul Edge and with them three sacred weapons join once again.

==Development==
After releasing &quot;Soul Edge&quot;, Namco took some time to evaluate what had made the game successful before jumping into the development of its sequel. Producer Hiroaki Yotoriyama decided to give the sequel a new name instead of just calling it &quot;Soul Edge 2&quot; in order to have a fresh start and take the series in a new direction. The name &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; is a portmanteau of the word &quot;soul&quot; (as in &quot;Soul Edge&quot;) and King Arthur&#x27;s sword Excalibur (ultimately, the name would be used within the game&#x27;s universe for the holy weapon which would counteract Soul Edge&#x27;s evil). Inspired by an internal Namco prototype featuring a character able to run openly in a field, the eight-way run system was implemented. Upon application, the development team was surprised at how well it meshed with their fighting system and decided to build the rest of the game around it. During development they worked closely with Namco&#x27;s &quot;Tekken&quot; development team, sharing ideas and research. Yotoriyama felt that with that cooperation and partnership, they were able to develop &quot;the greatest weapon-based fighting action game in the world&quot;.

Yotoriyama has described the game&#x27;s concept as expressing &quot;fun and diversity in weapon combat&quot;, citing the contrast in how one weapon would affect gameplay compared to another and how they would react to each other upon clashing. Each character&#x27;s fighting style was designed to revolve around their weapon, though he noted that because of the differences they experienced difficulty in balancing the gameplay. He described the availability of movement in comparison to &quot;Tekken 3&quot; as a large contrast between the two series and more tactical and emphasized how it interacted with the game&#x27;s &quot;ring out&quot; feature. Each character in &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; was designed around the idea that they could be viewed as a real person could, and to this end, motion creator Masataka Ishiguro emphasized the arm and leg movements for each character in relation to their weapon, wanting players to &quot;feel the individual motions and the realism within the game&quot;

It had been announced in January as &quot;New Weapon Fighting Game&quot; and a test version was shown at E3 in May. The team for the arcade version of &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; consisted of roughly sixty people working on Namco&#x27;s System 12 hardware, while the team developing the home port was reduced to about forty. Given a deadline of seven months to coincide with the North American launch of the Dreamcast, the transition was difficult for the team, due to the differences in hardware. However, due to the similar capabilities and limits of each system, content was left intact between the two versions, with Yotoriyama feeling that the team was &quot;obsessed&quot; with giving their best effort for the port. The biggest technological change to the Dreamcast port was to render all of the game&#x27;s stages in full 3D polygons, whereas the far backgrounds in the arcade original were flat, two-dimensional images. Additional content was also added to the game to ensure replay value, based on researching other fighting games marketed at the time. Many of the team&#x27;s ideas that they were unable to incorporate into the port were eventually used for later games in the series.

==Release==
The game was originally released in the Japanese arcades on July 30, 1998, with releases in North America and Europe following later the same year. A &quot;Gamest Book&quot; series guide book &quot;Soul Calibur Skill Up Manual&quot; (ソウルキャリバー スキルアップマニュアル) was published by Shinseisha on September 27, 1998.

===Dreamcast===
The Dreamcast port of &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; was released in Japan on August 5, 1999; and in North America and Europe as launch titles, on September 9, 1999, and November 26, 1999, respectively. The North American Dreamcast version of the game removes one of Voldo&#x27;s suggestive codpieces featuring a bull. However, the codpiece is present in the European and Japanese versions, as well as the North American Xbox 360 version. The European Dreamcast version was distributed and advertised by Sega Europe.

The Dreamcast version of &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; is one of the first examples of a home conversion of a game being graphically superior to its original arcade counterpart. Among the differences were the improved graphics (including the addition of 3D backgrounds), tweaked gameplay, new game modes, new costumes, and the inclusion of an extra character, Cervantes de Leon. The Dreamcast version features new modes such as Team Battle, Survival, and Training Mode. In Mission Battle, the player completes various missions to attain points, which can be used to buy various art, which then unlocks extra features, costumes and stages. Another feature added is the artwork section, containing official artwork, fanart, and high-res pictures. Also unlockable are a &quot;liquid metal&quot; version of the characters&#x27; costume and a &quot;Battle Theater&quot; mode, plus a way to modify the opening introduction theme by changing the characters appearing in it, and an &quot;Exhibition Mode&quot; displaying characters performing their katas (in Mission Mode it is possible to add more characters to the &quot;Exhibition Mode&quot;, such as Taki and Seung Mina).

===Xbox 360 (Xbox Live Arcade)===
In 2008, Namco Bandai Games announced a port of &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; would be released for the Xbox 360. The port was based on the European Dreamcast version and was made available for download on Xbox Live Arcade on July 2, 2008. While the game included HD updated graphics and various Live leaderboards, online play was absent which makes it an exception amongst most games ported to Xbox Live Arcade. Other features from the Dreamcast version (Museum, etc., with the exception of Mission Battle) are also in the game. While the intro is removed from this port, the intro music is still in this port. All content is unlocked by the start of the game.

The game is no longer available in the Microsoft Store.

===iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch)===
On January 19, 2012, Namco Bandai released a port of &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; for Apple&#x27;s iOS platform. Game modes in this version include Arcade, Time Attack, Survival, Extra Survival, Practice, and Museum mode. The game was released as a Universal App to run at native resolutions on iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch.

The game is no longer available in the iOS store.

===Android===
On November 20, 2013, Namco Bandai released a port of &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; for the Android platform. The app makes use of Google Play Games for synchronization between devices and runs at native resolution and screen aspect ratio.

The game is no longer available in the Google Play Store.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; on their September 1, 1998 issue as being the third most-successful arcade game of the month.

The Dreamcast version of &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; sold in excess of one million copies by December 1999, and 1.3 million by 2002. It is the second biggest selling game on the system. It won the 1999 E3 Game Critics Award for &quot;Best Fighting Game&quot;. At the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; with &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Console Fighting Game of the Year&quot; (along with a nomination for &quot;Game of the Year&quot;).

Blake Fischer reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Beautiful, deep, and far more compelling than any 3D fighter in recent memory, &quot;Soul Calibur&quot; is reason enough to own a Dreamcast.&quot;

The game received universal critical acclaim, garnering perfect 10/10 scores from &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot;, and was for nearly a decade the last game to receive a perfect rating from &quot;IGN&quot;, until the release of &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; in 2008. It is the second game ever to get a perfect 40/40 from Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; (the first being &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;). As of 2017, game review aggregator website GameRankings has the Dreamcast version ranked as the seventh best-reviewed game of all time, as well as being the highest-scoring title in the fighting game genre.

The Dreamcast version of &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; also holds a score of 98, making it one of the highest-rated video games of all time across all consoles and platforms, on Metacritic.

===Retrospective===
&quot;Soulcalibur&quot; was named as the number one best Dreamcast game by &quot;Game Informer&quot;. In 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; as the fifth best Dreamcast game, while ScrewAttack ranked it sixth. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; named &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; the best Dreamcast game of all time on their list. In 2005, &quot;GameSpot&quot; ranked &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; as the sixth best launch title yet, calling it &quot;not only one of the greatest launch games or one of the greatest fighters, but one of the greatest games ever. Period.&quot; In 2022, Cultured Vultures ranked &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; as the best Dreamcast game of all time.

<doc id="173426" wikidata="Q1418354" url="?curid=173426" title="Soul Edge">
<text>is a 1996 fighting game developed and published by Namco for arcades. It is the first installment in the &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; series. Introduced at the JAMMA trade show in November 1995, the full arcade game was released in February 1996 on System 11 hardware, the same board used by &quot;Tekken&quot; and &quot;Tekken 2&quot;. Later in December an upgraded and expanded version of the game was ported to the PlayStation; this version was renamed to Soul Blade outside Japan and released in 1997.

&quot;Soul Edge&quot; is a 3D fighting game and was the second such game to be based on weapons, following &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; (itself preceded by the 2D &quot;Samurai Showdown&quot; series). The plot centers upon the eponymous sword, rumored to offer unlimited power to anyone who can find and wield it, leading to nine warriors attempting to pursue the tenth who is rumored to have the sword. The game was a commercial and critical success, with praise given to graphics, gameplay and characters. It was followed up with &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; in July 1998.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Soul Edge&quot; was created prior to the introduction of the so-called 8-Way Run. The characters can sidestep to either side by double-tapping down to move to the foreground or tapping down then up to the background. The jump maneuver (which in &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; is more like a hop) moves the player higher into the air, even allowing it to pass above the opponent (much like in &quot;Tekken&quot;). The game uses an active block system performed by pressing the block button, and a combat system based on the three attack buttons: horizontal attack, vertical attack, and kick.

Character moves retain a feel of Namco&#x27;s &quot;Tekken&quot; series. Each character has one or two slow but unblockable attacks. Each character is also capable of performing one or two &quot;Critical Edge&quot; attacks, consisting of a long series of linked hits, usually ending in a strong high attack. These moves require the input of a special combination of two parts: they are activated by pressing all three attack buttons together, and if it connects, the player has the chance of extending the combo with a character-specific sequence, which must be input during the attack. This attack depletes one-third of the Weapon Gauge when used.

The Weapon Gauge is a life bar for the character&#x27;s equipped weapon. Each time the player blocks an attack, the bar depletes. If the bar is totally emptied, the weapon is lost and the character is forced to fight unarmed. The unarmed move-lists are the same for every character. Another feature that was removed from &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;″s engine is a rock paper scissors situation when two character strike at the same time, locking their weapons; those who press the correct button have the advantage.

&quot;Soul Edge&quot; uses an optional offensive block maneuver called the &quot;Guard Impact&quot; that allows players to intercept incoming attacks and push them back, resulting in a momentary opportunity for a free counterattack. Opponents, however, are also able to return a Guard Impact after receiving a Guard Impact, allowing for stalemate clashes until one opponent missed the subsequent timing. This gameplay feature is expanded in future &quot;Soul&quot; series games.

The game uses the ring out system, which is a forcible maneuver that ejects the opponent from the arena and gains an automatic victory for the round. To achieve a ring out, a character must be knocked outside the ring by an enemy (the player cannot accidentally or deliberately get a ring out by hopping out of the ring). The only exception to this rule is Cervantes and Inferno (known in this game as SoulEdge), who can get a ring out by themselves upon performing a certain special attack, as long as they are near the edge of the arena.

==Plot and characters==
&quot;Soul Edge&quot;″s events take place in the year 1583. The game tells the tale of warriors searching for the ultimate sword, &quot;Soul Edge&quot;. It has been given many names throughout history, such as &quot;The Sword of Salvation&quot;, &quot;The Sword of Heroes&quot;, and &quot;The Ultimate Sword&quot;, among others. Many strong warriors searched for years, but very few actually found it. The sword, currently in the form of a twin pair of long swords, appeared mysteriously in an auction. It was taken by the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon and nothing is known of his fate thereafter. Presently, nine warriors from around the world (Hwang, Li Long, Mitsurugi, Rock, Seong Mi-na, Siegfried, Sophitia, Taki, and Voldo) search for the sword for different reasons. Some desire its power, others want revenge. Some, believing that it is a benevolent sword, crave its support. Others, knowing of its evil nature, seek its destruction. Nothing is known for certain about the sword, except for one thing: it brings misfortune to those seeking it. What many do not know is that the sword&#x27;s power is evil, feeding upon the souls of not only its victims but its wielder as well.

==Development and release==
&quot;Soul Edge&quot; was developed as an experiment by Namco to explore the possibilities of a weapon-based fighting game; &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; was one of the first of this type, while &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; was the first in 3D. &quot;Soul Edge&quot; was the first motion capture based video game created by using passive optical system markers.

&quot;Soul Edge&quot; was initially released in arcades in 1995. A &quot;Gamest Mook&quot; series guide book (GMC-30) was published by Shinseisha on April 30, 1996.

A couple of months later, Namco released a fixed version, labeled &quot;Soul Edge Ver. II.&quot; Hwang (initially a palette swap of Mitsurugi for the Korean version of the game) was introduced to Japanese players with a new move list, Cervantes became playable, Guard Impacts and Air Combos were implemented, all the characters received upgraded move lists, and new stages were added. The overseas PlayStation version was renamed &quot;Soul Blade&quot; to avoid potential complications due to EDGE Games&#x27; earlier &quot;EDGE&quot; trademark.

===PlayStation===
On December 20, 1996, &quot;Soul Edge&quot; was ported to the Sony PlayStation for the Japanese market. A limited special edition came with the Namco Joystick controller. An official tribute book &quot;Soul Edge Official Fan Book&quot; (ソウルエッジ オフィシャルファンブック／年代記) was published in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; series by &quot;Famitsu&quot; on March 31, 1997.

The port kept the &quot;Soul Edge Ver. II&quot; roster of ten characters and added five unlockable characters, including SoulEdge, the final boss of the game. Other PlayStation-specific features include:
* A new costume for each character, chosen from various works sent by fans, giving each one a total of three different costumes, plus two color variations for the Player 1 and Player 2 costumes. It also includesbesides the standard Arcade modeVS mode, Survival, Team Battle, Time Attack, and Training modes.
* A new RPG-styled mode called Edge Master mode, which works as a kind of story mode for the ten initial characters. The mode presents the selected character&#x27;s story as a book, while the player moves in a map to various locations and fights in battles, sometimes with handicap rules. Generally, each chapter of the book rewards the player with a weapon.
* An opening CGI cinematic and individual endings done using the game&#x27;s engine rather than still images as in its sequels &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; and &quot;Soulcalibur II&quot;. Each of the ten normally selectable characters have two endings, usually one happy ending and another tragic ending. These endings are accessible by pressing a special button/button sequence during certain times, indicated by black bars moving away, while others involve a short minigame, such as Mitsurugi avoiding gunshots. This type of ending was finally brought back in &quot;Soulcalibur III&quot;.
* The inclusion of seven extra weapons per character, which have different designs and statistics, composed of Power (inflicts more damage), Defense (receives less damage), Strength (damage dealt with enemy&#x27;s weapon gauge), Durability (resistance of player&#x27;s weapon gauge), and Weight (changes character&#x27;s speed). Certain weapons also have a special ability, such as the ability to damage through defense or restore/drain the player&#x27;s health.
* The inclusion of three different in-game soundtracks to choose from: the original arcade soundtrack, a studio-recorded version of the arcade soundtrack called &quot;Arrange Soundtrack&quot; and the Khan Super Session, made expressly for the home version.
* In the English version, all non-Asian characters have their English voice as default. (The concept of speaking different languages was followed by &quot;Tekken 4&quot; since the character Julia Chang from &quot;Tekken 3&quot; speaks in her ending.)

Versions labeled &quot;Soul Blade&quot; came out in 1997. In the North American version, the opening cutscene where Sophitia would have been nude is censored. In the European version, Li Long&#x27;s pair of nunchaku were changed to a three-section staff, since BBFC guidelines at the time banned any depiction of nunchaku.

===Soundtracks===
Two soundtrack CDs were released for the game: &quot;Soul Edge Original Soundtrack - Khan Super Session&quot; and &quot;Super Battle Sound Attack Soul Edge&quot;.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Soul Edge&quot; on their March 15, 1996 issue as being the second most-successful arcade game of the month. On the annual 1996 &quot;Gamest&quot; chart, &quot;Soul Edge&quot; was the 20th highest-grossing arcade game in Japan that year. The arcade game was more successful in the United States, where it became one of the top five highest-grossing arcade conversion kits of 1996. Despite this, it was not able to achieve the same level of arcade success as Namco&#x27;s popular &quot;Tekken&quot; series. According to &quot;Next Generation&quot; magazine, &quot;Soul Edge&quot; &quot;enjoyed less success than it deserved&quot; in arcades.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the arcade version of &quot;Soul Edge Version II&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;there is still the slight control delay, but character movement is still fluid and seamless, and the trailing slashes of light in the wake of weapon movement is as gorgeous as ever.&quot; The PlayStation conversion, &quot;Soul Blade&quot;, was a bestseller in the UK. Due to its popularity, the game has been re-released as part of the PlayStation Greatest Hits, the PlayStation Platinum range, and the PlayStation The Best series.

===PlayStation===
The PlayStation game received very positive reviews. It holds aggregated scores of 91% on GameRankings and 89/100 on Metacritic, including high ratings by IGN (&quot;extremely fun, and has just enough new elements to make it worth playing multiple times&quot;), and GameSpot (&quot;a great fighting game with its share of flaws&quot;). &quot;Next Generation&quot; praised it for &quot;filling in all the blanks with great gameplay, superb characters, unique graphics, and combines them into one solid package.&quot; They later commended the PlayStation port for retaining all the characters, levels, graphics, and gameplay from the arcade version. &quot;GameFan&quot; called it &quot;without a doubt the most stunning graphical fighting feast ever to grace any console.&quot; The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; particularly applauded the full motion video intro and the new story mode. They awarded it &quot;Best Intro&quot; in their &quot;1998 Video Game Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;GamePro&quot; stated: &quot;Bow down to the new king of fighters, and the first gotta-play-it game of the year.&quot;

In 1997, &quot;&quot; named &quot;Soul Edge&quot; as the fourth top game on the PlayStation, and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listed the PlayStation version as a runner-up for &quot;Fighting Game of the Year&quot; (behind &quot;Street Fighter Collection&quot;) and &quot;Best Music&quot; (behind &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot;). &quot;PSU&quot; listed this game as the sixth &quot;PSone classic&quot; most deserving to be remade for the PlayStation 3 in 2011. That same year, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;Soul Edge&quot; as the 19th best fighting game of all time.

The PlayStation version&#x27;s opening sequence won the SIGGRAPH &#x27;97 award for the best game video of 1996. It was also included on the list of the ten all-time best game cinematics by Cheat Code Central in 2012.

<doc id="173427" wikidata="Q570023" url="?curid=173427" title="California Über Alles">
<text>&quot;California Über Alles&quot; is the debut single by American punk rock band Dead Kennedys. It was the group&#x27;s first recording and was released in June 1979 on the Optional Music label, with &quot;The Man with the Dogs&quot; appearing as its B-side. The title track was re-recorded in 1980 for the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot;, and the original recording as well as the B-side were later included on the 1987 compilation &quot;Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death&quot;.

==Meaning== 
The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway for their band The Healers. Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.

The title is an allusion to the first stanza of the national anthem of Germany, which begins with the words &quot;Deutschland, Deutschland über alles&quot; (&quot;Germany, Germany above everything&quot;). After the end of the Third Reich in 1945, the anthem was shortened to just the third stanza of the original song, as this passage is sometimes associated with Nazism and, in following, claims a large area of land that is no longer contained within the current borders of Germany.

The lyrics are a pointed, satirical attack on Jerry Brown, the Governor of California from 1975 to 1983 (and later 2011–2019), and are sung from his perspective, as an imaginary version of Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision of America. The line &quot;Serpent&#x27;s egg already hatched&quot; is a reference to a comment on the corrosive nature of power from William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, and also a reference to the Ingmar Bergman film &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Egg&quot; set in 1920s Berlin that gets its title from the Shakespeare play. The lines &quot;Big Bro on white horse is near&quot; and &quot;now it is 1984&quot; refer respectively to a statement Brown made during his first governorship that Americans were supposedly looking for &quot;a leader on a white horse&quot;, and to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell&#x27;s classic novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; to describe a future (from a 1979 perspective) where Jerry Brown has become president, and his &quot;suede/denim secret police&quot; kill &quot;uncool&quot; people in &quot;organic poison gas&quot; chambers.

After the song&#x27;s initial release, mild confusion arose in the Bay Area music scene as to why Biafra (who was outspoken about his far-left political views) was targeting Jerry Brown (a notably liberal politician for the time). Brown succeeded Ronald Reagan as governor of California, and Reagan was a seemingly more obvious target. However, Biafra frequently expressed his disdain for hippies, and the Dead Kennedys often satirized both left-wing and right-wing politicians.

The song is also an early example of Dead Kennedys&#x27; style, with heavy surf rock and militaristic overtones. It begins with sinister military-style drums, joined by an ominous bass riff. Biafra paints the scene in low, sneering tones before bursting into the manic chanted chorus; after two verses and choruses, the song shifts into a slower middle eight section set to a martial drumbeat over which Jello Biafra imagines the nightmarish actions of Brown&#x27;s SS-styled secret police (&quot;Come quietly to the camp; you&#x27;d look nice as a drawstring lamp,&quot; a reference to the allegation that lampshades were made from human skin during the Holocaust). The pace speeds up as it approaches the last iteration of the chorus, closing with a repeated chord sequence accompanied by a final burst of explosive drums.

German-American author Gero Hoschek was inspired by the song to title a 1988 magazine piece about the &quot;Golden State&quot; in the German &quot;Zeit Magazin&quot; weekly titled &quot;Kalifornia Über Alles!&quot; as well as a never–produced screenplay. Biafra complained, and was provided with a copy of the movie script, which he read and liked; understanding that there was no copyright violation, he gave Hoscheck permission to use the similar name.

==Alternative versions==
The original, improvised version (containing familiar lyrics but different music performed by the Dancing Assholes and Biafra&#x27;s first band, The Healers) is included as the final track on the vinyl version of the &quot;Rocky Mountain Low&quot; compilation.

The version recorded for &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; was played slightly faster, featuring a much more strident vocal from Biafra and a fuller, more confrontational sound altogether than the single mix.

On their EP &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot;, they recorded an updated version of the song, titled &quot;We&#x27;ve Got a Bigger Problem Now&quot;, about then-President Ronald Reagan, including a lounge-jazz introduction, different lyrics, and several verses set at a much slower pace. A live version of the song was recorded with the instrumentals of the original version of the song.

Jello Biafra has made satirical references to the song in his political advocacy. A speech of his appears on the spoken word album &quot;Mob Action Against the State&quot; that is entitled &quot;We&#x27;ve Got a Bigger Problem Now: War, Terrorism &amp; Beyond&quot;. After the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor of California, Biafra commented, &quot;California Über Alles indeed&quot;.

Another updated version of this song about Governor Schwarzenegger, called &quot;Kali-Fornia Über Alles 21st Century&quot;, was performed live (among a few other Dead Kennedys classics) when Biafra toured with the band Melvins to support their collaboration album in 2004. A live recording of this new version appears on their second collaborative effort, &quot;Sieg Howdy!&quot;.

Fans of Dulwich Hamlet F.C. in South London also regularly sing a version of the song as a tribute to their longest-serving manager - Gavin Rose. Many of the words are replaced in this version, e.g. &quot;Dulwich Hamlet&quot; instead of &quot;California&quot;.

<text>The M1 carbine (formally the United States carbine, caliber .30, M1) is a lightweight semi-automatic carbine chambered in the .30 carbine (7.62×33mm) cartridge that was issued to the U.S. military during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The M1 carbine was produced in several variants and was widely used by paramilitary and police forces around the world after World War II.

The M2 carbine is the selective-fire version of the M1 carbine, capable of firing in both semi-automatic and full-automatic. The M3 carbine was an M2 carbine with an active infrared scope system.

Despite having a similar name and physical outward appearance, the M1 carbine is not a carbine version of the M1 Garand rifle. On 1 July 1925, the U.S. Army began using the current naming convention where the &quot;M&quot; is the designation for &quot;Model&quot; and the number represents the sequential development of equipment and weapons. Therefore, the &quot;M1 carbine&quot; was the first carbine developed under this system. The &quot;M2 carbine&quot; was the second carbine developed under the system, etc.

==Development history==
===Limitations of weapons in the U.S. arsenal===


Prior to World War II, the U.S. Army Ordnance Department received reports that the full-size M1 rifle was too heavy and cumbersome for most support troops (staff, artillerymen, radiomen, etc.) to carry. During pre-war and early war field exercises, it was found that the M1 Garand impeded these soldiers&#x27; mobility, as a slung rifle would frequently catch on brush or hit the back of the helmet and tilt it over the eyes. Many soldiers found the rifle slid off the shoulder unless slung diagonally across the back, where it prevented the wearing of standard field packs and haversacks.

Additionally, Germany&#x27;s use of glider-borne and paratrooper forces to launch surprise &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; attacks behind the front lines generated a request for a new compact infantry weapon to equip support troops. This request called for a compact, lightweight defensive weapon with greater range, accuracy and firepower than a handgun, while weighing half as much as the Thompson submachine gun or the M1 rifle. The U.S. Army decided that a carbine-type weapon would adequately fulfill all of these requirements, and specified that the new arm should weigh no more than and have an effective range of . Paratroopers were also added to the list of intended users and a folding-stock version would also be developed.

===Design===

In 1938, the chief of infantry requested that the ordnance department develop a &quot;light rifle&quot; or carbine, though the formal requirement for the weapon type was not approved until 1940.

Winchester developed the .30 Carbine cartridge for the ordnance department. Winchester at first did not submit a carbine design, as it was occupied in developing the Winchester G30 rifle. The G30 rifle originated as a design by Jonathan &quot;Ed&quot; Browning, half-brother of the famous firearm designer John Moses Browning. A couple of months after Ed Browning&#x27;s death in May 1939, Winchester hired David Marshall &quot;Carbine&quot; Williams who had begun work on a short-stroke gas piston design while serving a prison sentence at a North Carolina minimum-security work farm. Winchester, after Williams&#x27; release, had hired Williams on the strength of recommendations of firearms industry leaders and hoped Williams would be able to complete various designs left unfinished by Ed Browning, including the Winchester G30 rifle. Williams incorporated his short-stroke piston in the existing design as the G30M. After the Marine Corps&#x27; semi-automatic rifle trials in 1940, Browning&#x27;s rear-locking tilting bolt design proved unreliable in sandy conditions. As a result, Williams redesigned the G30M to incorporate a Garand-style rotating bolt and operating slide, retaining the short-stroke piston as the .30 M2 Winchester Military Rifle. By May 1941, Williams had shaved the M2 rifle prototype from about to a .

Ordnance found unsatisfactory the first series of prototype carbines submitted by several firearms companies and some independent designers. Winchester had contacted the ordnance department to examine their rifle M2 design. Major René Studler of ordnance believed the rifle design could be scaled down to a carbine which would weigh and demanded a prototype as soon as possible. The first model was developed at Winchester in 13 days by William C. Roemer, Fred Humeston and three other Winchester engineers under the supervision of Edwin Pugsley and was essentially Williams&#x27; last version of the .30-06 M2 scaled down to the .30 SL cartridge. This patchwork prototype was cobbled together using the trigger housing and lockwork of a Winchester M1905 rifle and a modified Garand operating rod. The prototype was an immediate hit with army observers.

After the initial Army testing in August 1941, the Winchester design team set out to develop a more refined version. Williams participated in the finishing of this prototype. The second prototype competed successfully against all remaining carbine candidates in September 1941, and Winchester was notified of their success the next month. Standardization as the M1 carbine was approved on 22 October 1941. This story was the loose basis for the 1952 movie &quot;Carbine Williams&quot; starring James Stewart. Contrary to the movie, Williams had little to do with the carbine&#x27;s development, with the exception of his short-stroke gas piston design. Williams worked on his own design apart from the other Winchester staff, but it was not ready for testing until December 1941, two months after the Winchester M1 carbine had been adopted and type-classified. Winchester supervisor Edwin Pugsley conceded that Williams&#x27; final design was &quot;an advance on the one that was accepted&quot; but noted that Williams&#x27; decision to go it alone was a distinct impediment to the project, and Williams&#x27; additional design features were not incorporated into M1 production. In a 1951 memo written in fear of a patent infringement lawsuit by Williams, Winchester noted his patent for the short-stroke piston may have been improperly granted as a previous patent covering the same principle of operation was overlooked by the patent office.

In 1973, the senior technical editor at the NRA contacted Edwin Pugsley for &quot;a technical last testament&quot; on M1 carbine history shortly before his death on 19 November 1975. According to Pugsley, &quot;The carbine was invented by no single man,&quot; but was the result of a team effort including: William C. Roemer, David Marshall Williams, Fred Humeston, Cliff Warner, at least three other Winchester engineers, and Pugsley himself. Ideas were taken and modified from the Winchester M2 Browning rifle (Williams&#x27; gas system), the Winchester Model 1905 rifle (fire control group and magazine), M1 Garand (buttstock dimensions, and bolt and operating slide principles), and a percussion shotgun in Pugsley&#x27;s collection (hook breech and barrel band assembly/disassembly).

==Features==


===Ammunition===
The .30 Carbine cartridge is essentially a rimless version of the obsolete .32 Winchester Self-Loading cartridge introduced for the Winchester Model 1905 rifle. The propellant was much newer, though, taking advantage of chemistry advances. As a result, the .30 Carbine cartridge is approximately 27% more powerful than its parent cartridge. A standard .30 Carbine ball bullet weighs 110 grains (7.1 g), a complete loaded round weighs 195 grains (12.6 g) and has a muzzle velocity of giving it 967 ft·lbf (1,311 joules) of energy, when fired from the M1 carbine&#x27;s barrel.

In comparison, the .30-06 Springfield ball round used by the M1 Garand is almost three times as powerful as the .30 Carbine, while the carbine round is twice as powerful as the .45 ACP-caliber Thompson submachine gun in common use at the time. As a result, the carbine offers much better range, accuracy and penetration than those submachine guns. The M1 is also half the weight of the Thompson and fires a lighter cartridge. Therefore, soldiers armed with the carbine can carry much more ammunition than those armed with a Thompson.

Categorizing the M1 carbine series has been the subject of much debate. Although commonly compared to the later German StG 44 and Russian AK-47, the M1 and M2 carbines are under-powered and outclassed. Instead, the carbine falls somewhere between the submachine gun and assault rifle and could be called a precursor of the personal defense weapon since it fulfilled a similar role.

One characteristic of .30 caliber Carbine ammunition is that from the beginning of production, non-corrosive primers were specified. This was the first major use of this type of primer in a military firearm. Because the rifle had a closed gas system, not normally disassembled in the field, corrosive primers would have led to a rapid deterioration of the function of the gas system. The use of non-corrosive primers was a novelty in service ammunition at this time. Some failures to fire were reported in early lots of .30 caliber Carbine ammunition, attributed to moisture ingress of the non-corrosive primer compound.

===Sights, range and accuracy===
The M1 carbine entered service with a simple flip sight, which had two settings: . However, field reports indicated that this sight was inadequate, and in 1944, it was replaced by a sliding ramp-type adjustable sight with four settings: , , , and . This new rear sight was also adjustable for windage.

At , the M1 carbine can deliver groups between , sufficient for its intended purpose as a close-range defensive weapon. The M1 carbine has a maximum effective range of . However, bullet drop is significant past . Therefore, the M1 has a practical effective range of about .

===Magazines===
The M1 carbine entered service with a standard straight 15-round box magazine. The introduction of the select-fire M2 carbine in October 1944 also brought into service the curved 30-round box magazine or &quot;Banana Clip&quot;. After WWII, the 30-round magazine quickly became the standard magazine for both the M1 and M2 carbines, although the 15-round magazine remained in service until the end of the Vietnam War.

Perhaps the most common accessory used on the M1 carbine was a standard magazine belt pouch that was slid over the stock and held two extra 15-round magazines. This field adaptation was never officially approved but proved an efficient method to supply extra ammunition in combat. After the introduction of the 30-round magazine, it was common for troops to tape two 30-round magazines together, a practice that became known as &quot;jungle style&quot;. This led the military to introduce the &quot;Holder, Magazine T3-A1&quot; also called the &quot;jungle clip&quot;, a metal clamp that held two magazines together without the need for tape.

The 30-round magazines introduced for use with the selective-fire M2 carbine would not be reliably retained by the magazine catch made for the original M1 carbine which was designed to retain a 15-round magazine, so the much heavier 30-round magazine would not be properly seated in the M1 carbine magazine well. The loaded 30-round magazine would typically slant (impairing feed reliability) or even fall out, which contributed to the poor reliability record of the 30-round magazines. Because of their thin steel construction, they were also more prone to damage due to their added length and weight when loaded. In response to these issues, early production M1 carbines had to be fitted with the type IV magazine catch used on the M2 carbine (and late production M1 carbines) if they were to be used with 30-round magazines in order to ensure reliable loading and feeding. The type IV magazine catch has a leg on the left side to correspond with the additional nub on the 30-round magazines.

Initial combat reports noted that the M1 carbine&#x27;s magazine release button was often mistaken for the safety button while under fire. When this occurred, pressing the magazine release caused the loaded magazine to drop, while the safety remained in the &quot;off&quot; position. As a result, the push-button safety was redesigned using a rotating lever.

===Accessories===

Originally the M1 carbine did not have a bayonet lug, but personnel equipped with it were often issued with an M3 fighting knife. Due to requests from the field, the carbine was modified to incorporate a bayonet lug attached to the barrel band starting in 1945. However, very few carbines with bayonet lugs reached the front lines before the end of World War II. After the war, the bayonet lug was added to many M1 carbines during the arsenal refurbishing process. By the start of the Korean War, the bayonet lug-equipped M1 was standard issue. It is now rare to find an original M1 carbine without the bayonet lug. The M1 carbine mounts the M4 bayonet, which was based on the earlier M3 fighting knife and formed the basis for the later M5, M6 and M7 bayonet-knives.

A folding-stock version of the carbine, the M1A1, was also developed after a request for a compact and light infantry arm for airborne troops. The Inland Division of General Motors manufactured 140,000 of them in two product runs in late 1942. They were originally issued to the 82nd and 101st airborne divisions but were later issued to all U.S. Army Airborne units and the U.S. Marine Corps. The folding-stock M1A1 is an unusual design in that the stock is not locked in the open or closed position, but is instead held in place by a spring-loaded cam.

As carbines were reconditioned, parts such as the magazine catch, rear sight, barrel band without bayonet lug, and stock were upgraded with current standard-issue parts. Also, both during and after World War II, many semi-automatic M1 carbines were converted to select-fire M2 carbines by using the T17 and T18 conversion kits. The conversion included a modified sear, slide, and trigger housing, and added a disconnector, disconnector lever, and selector switch that could be set for semi-auto or full-automatic fire.

During World War II, the T23 (M3) flash hider was designed to reduce the muzzle flash from the carbine, but was not introduced into service until the advent of the M3 carbine. With the exception of T23 hiders mounted on M3 carbines, few if any T23 flash-hider attachments saw service during the war, though unit armorers occasionally hand-built improvised compensator-flash-hiders of their own design.

Combat tests of the M2 carbine resulted in an Army Ground Forces request that led to development of the T13 recoil check adopted September 1945.

The M1 carbine was used with the M8 grenade launcher (see M7 grenade launcher), which was developed in early 1944. It was fired with the .30 caliber Carbine M6 grenade blank cartridge to launch 22 mm rifle grenades. However, the stress from firing rifle grenades could eventually crack the carbine&#x27;s stock, and it also could not use the launcher with the M7 auxiliary &quot;booster&quot; charge to extend its range without breaking the stock. This made the M1 carbine with M8 grenade launcher a type of emergency-use weapon.

==Production==
A total of over 6.1 million M1 carbines of various models were manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II (compared with about 5.4 million M1 rifles and about 1.3 million Thompson submachine guns). Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies (see § Military contractors below). The largest producer was the Inland division of General Motors, but many others were made by contractors as diverse as IBM, the Underwood Typewriter Company, and Rock-Ola Manufacturing Corporation. Few contractors made all the parts for carbines bearing their names: some makers bought parts from other major contractors or sub-contracted minor parts to companies like Marlin Firearms or Auto-Ordnance. Parts by all makers were required to be interchangeable. Often one company would get ahead or behind in production and parts would be shipped from one company to the other to help them catch up on their quota. When receivers were shipped for this purpose, the manufacturers would often mark them for both companies. Some of the strangest combinations were the M1s made by the combined efforts of Underwood and Quality Hardware, resulting in the manufacturer mark &quot;Un-quality&quot;. The receiver was subcontracted from Union Switch and Signal, not Underwood. Many carbines were refurbished at several arsenals after the war, with many parts interchanged from original maker carbines. True untouched war production carbines, therefore, are the most desirable for collectors.

The M1 carbine was also one of the most cost-effective weapons used by the United States military during World War II. At the beginning of World War II, the average production cost for an M1 carbine was approximately $45, about half the cost of an M1 rifle at approximately $85 and about a fifth of the cost of a Thompson submachine gun at approximately $225. The .30 caliber Carbine ammunition was also far cheaper to produce than the standard .30-06 ammunition; used fewer resources, was smaller, lighter and easier to make. These were major factors in the United States military decision to adopt the M1 carbine, especially when considering the vast numbers of weapons and ammunition manufactured and transported by the United States during World War II.

==U.S. combat use==
===World War II===


The M1 carbine with its reduced-power .30 cartridge was not originally intended to serve as a primary weapon for combat infantrymen, nor was it comparable to more powerful assault rifles developed late in the war. However, it was markedly superior to the .45 caliber submachine guns in use at the time in both accuracy and penetration, and its lighter .30 caliber cartridge allowed soldiers to carry more ammunition. As a result, the carbine was soon widely issued to infantry officers, American paratroopers, non-commissioned officers, ammunition bearers, forward artillery observers, and other frontline troops. The first M1 carbines were delivered in mid-1942, with initial priority given to troops in the European Theater of Operations (ETO).

During World War II a standard U.S. Army infantry company was issued a total of 28 M1 carbines. The company headquarters was issued nine carbines (for the company commander, executive officer, first sergeant, mess sergeant, supply sergeant, bugler, and three messengers), the weapons platoon was issued sixteen carbines (for the platoon leader, platoon sergeant, two platoon messengers in the platoon headquarters, one messenger in each of the two mortar and machine gun section headquarters, and ten for the mortar and machine gun ammunition bearers), and the three rifle platoons were issued one each (for the platoon leader).

The M1 carbine gained generally high praise for its small size, light weight and firepower, especially by those troops who were unable to use a full-size rifle as their primary weapon. However, its reputation in front-line combat was mixed and negative reports began to surface with airborne operations in Sicily in 1943, and increased during the fall and winter of 1944.

In the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, soldiers and guerrilla forces operating in heavy jungle with only occasional enemy contact praised the carbine for its small size, light weight, and firepower. However, soldiers and marines engaged in frequent daily firefights (particularly those serving in the Philippines) found the weapon to have insufficient penetration and stopping power. While carbine bullets would easily penetrate the front and back of steel helmets, as well as the body armor used by Japanese forces of the era, reports of the carbine&#x27;s failure to stop enemy soldiers, sometimes after multiple hits, appeared in individual after-action reports, postwar evaluations, and service histories of both the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps.

The carbine&#x27;s exclusive use of non-corrosive-primer ammunition was found to be ideal by troops and ordnance personnel serving in the Pacific, where barrel corrosion was a significant issue with the corrosive primers used in .30-06 caliber weapons. However, in the European theatre, some soldiers reported misfires attributed to moisture ingress of the non-corrosive primer compound.

====Selective-fire version====

Initially, the M1 carbine was intended to have a select-fire capability, but the requirement for rapid production of the new carbine resulted in the omission of this feature from the Light Rifle Program. On 26 October 1944, in response to the Germans&#x27; widespread use of automatic weapons, especially the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle, the select-fire &quot;M2 carbine&quot; was introduced, along with a new 30-round magazine. The M2 had a fully automatic rate-of-fire of 750-775 rounds-per-minute. Although actual M2 production began late in the war (April 1945), U.S. Ordnance issued conversion-part kits to allow field conversion of semi-auto M1 carbines to the selective-fire M2 configuration. These converted M1/M2 select-fire carbines saw limited combat service in Europe, primarily during the final Allied advance into Germany. In the Pacific, both converted and original M2 carbines saw limited use in the last days of the fighting in the Philippines.

====Infrared sight versions====
The &quot;M3 carbine&quot; was an M2 carbine with the M2 infrared night sight or &quot;sniperscope&quot;. The M3 did not have iron sights. It was first used in combat by Army units during the invasion of Okinawa, where about 150 M3 carbines were used. For the first time, U.S. soldiers had a weapon that allowed them to visually detect Japanese infiltrating into American lines at night, even during complete darkness. A team of two or three soldiers was used to operate the weapon and provide support. At night, the scope would be used to detect Japanese patrols and assault units moving forward. At that point, the operator would fire a burst of automatic fire at the greenish images of enemy soldiers. The M3 carbine had an effective range of about , limited by the visual capabilities of the sight. Fog and rain further reduced the weapon&#x27;s effective range. However, it is estimated that 30% of Japanese casualties inflicted by rifle and carbine fire during the Okinawan campaign were caused by the M3 carbine.

The system was refined over time, and by the Korean War the improved M3 infrared night sight was in service. The M3 sight has a longer effective range than its predecessor, about . However, it still required the user to carry a heavy backpack-mounted battery pack to power the scope and infrared light. They were used primarily in static defensive positions in Korea to locate troops attempting to infiltrate in darkness. M3 operators would not only use their carbines to dispatch individual targets, but also used tracer ammo to identify troop concentrations for machine gunners to decimate. In total, about 20,000 sets were made before they became obsolete, and were given to the public as surplus.

===Korean War===

By the Korean War, the select fire M2 carbine had largely replaced the submachine-gun in U.S. service and was the most widely used carbine variant. However, the semi-auto M1 carbine was also widely used- especially by support troops. However, in Korea, all versions of the carbine soon acquired a widespread reputation for jamming in extremely cold weather, this being eventually traced to weak return springs, freezing of parts due to overly viscous lubricants and inadequate cartridge recoil impulse as the result of subzero temperatures.

There were also many complaints from individual soldiers that the carbine bullets failed to stop heavily clothed or gear-laden North Korean and Chinese (PVA) troops even at close range and after multiple hits. Marines of the 1st Marine Division also reported instances of carbine bullets failing to stop enemy soldiers, and some units issued standing orders for carbine users to aim for the head. PVA infantry forces who had been issued captured U.S. small arms disliked the carbine for the same reason.

A 1951 official U.S. Army evaluation reported that ...&quot;There are practically no data bearing on the accuracy of the carbine at ranges in excess of . The record contains a few examples of carbine-aimed fire felling an enemy soldier at this distance or perhaps a little more. But they are so few in number that no general conclusion can be drawn from them. Where carbine fire had proved killing effect, approximately 95 percent of the time the target was dropped at less than .&quot; The evaluation also reported that ...&quot;Commanders noted that it took two to three engagements at least to settle their men to the automatic feature of the carbine so that they would not greatly waste ammunition under the first impulse of engagement. By experience, they would come to handle it semi-automatically, but it took prolonged battle hardening to bring about this adjustment in the human equation.&quot;

Despite its mixed reputation, the M2 carbine&#x27;s firepower often made it the weapon of choice, when it came to night patrols in Korea. The M3 carbine with its infrared sniper scope was also used against night infiltrators, especially during the static stages of the conflict.

===Vietnam War===
The M1 and M2 carbines issued to U.S. forces were first given to American military advisors in Vietnam beginning in 1956, and later, the United States Air Force Security Police and United States Army Special Forces. These weapons began to be replaced by the M16 in 1964, and they were generally out of service by the 1970s. By the war&#x27;s end, it was estimated that a total of 1.5 million M1 and M2 carbines were left in Vietnam.

At least 793,994 M1 and M2 carbines were given to the South Vietnamese and were widely used throughout the Vietnam War. A number were captured during the war by Viet Cong, with some made compact by shortening the barrel and/or stock. &quot;While the carbine&#x27;s lighter weight and high rate of fire made it an excellent weapon for small-statured Asians, these guns lacked sufficient hitting power and penetration, and they were eventually outclassed by the AK-47 assault rifle.&quot;
The M1/M2/M3 carbines were the most heavily produced family of U.S. military weapons for several decades. They were used by every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.

==Foreign usage==


After World War II, the M1 and M2 carbines were widely exported to U.S. allies and client states (1,015,568 to South Korea, 793,994 to South Vietnam, 269,644 to France, etc.), they were used as a frontline weapon well into the Vietnam War era, and they continue to be used by military, police, and security forces around the world to this day.

===British Army===
During World War II, the British SAS used the M1 and M1A1 carbines after 1943. The weapon was taken into use simply because a decision had been taken by Allied authorities to supply .30 caliber weapons from U.S. stocks in the weapons containers dropped to Resistance groups sponsored by an SOE, or later also Office of Strategic Services (OSS), organizer, on the assumption the groups so supplied would be operating in areas within the operational boundaries of U.S. forces committed to Operation Overlord. They were found to be suited to the kind of operation the two British, two French, and one Belgian Regiment carried out. It was handy enough to parachute with, and, in addition, could be easily stowed in an operational Jeep. Other specialist intelligence collection units, such as 30 Assault Unit sponsored by the Naval Intelligence Division of the British Admiralty, which operated across the entire Allied area of operations, also made use of this weapon.. The carbine continued to be utilized as late as the Malayan Emergency, by the Police Field Force of the Royal Malaysian Police, along with other units of the British Army, were issued the M2 carbine for both jungle patrols and outpost defense. The Royal Ulster Constabulary also used the M1 carbine.

===German Army===
Small numbers of captured M1 carbines were used by German forces in World War II, particularly after D-Day. The German designation for captured carbines was &quot;Selbstladekarabiner 455(a)&quot;. The &quot;&quot;a&quot; came from the country name in German; in this case, &quot;Amerika&quot;. It was also used by German police and border guards in Bavaria after World War II and into the 1950s. The carbines were stamped according to the branch they were in service with; for instance, those used by the border guard were stamped &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot;&quot;. Some of these weapons were modified with different sights, finishes, and sometimes new barrels.

===Japanese GSDF===
A variant was produced shortly after World War II by Japanese manufacturer Howa Machinery, under U.S. supervision. These were issued to all branches of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, and large numbers of them found their way to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. Howa also made replacement parts for US-made M1 carbines issued to Japanese police and military.

=== Israel Defense Forces ===
The M1 carbine was also used by the Israeli Palmach-based special forces in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. And, because of their compact size and semi-automatic capabilities, they continued to be used by Israeli Defence Forces after the creation of Israel. The Israeli police still use the M1 carbine as a standard long gun for non-combat elements and Mash&#x27;az volunteers.

=== French Army ===
The U.S. provided France with 269,644 M1 and M2 carbines from World War II to 1963. The carbines were used by the French Paratroopers and Legionnaires, as well as specialists (e.g., drivers, radio operators, engineers), during the First Indochina War, the Algerian War and the Suez Crisis.


=== South Vietnam ===
The U.S. provided the Army of the Republic of Vietnam with 793,994 M1 and M2 carbines from 1963 to 1973. Along with tens of thousands of carbines left behind by the French after the First Indochina War, the M1 and M2 carbines were the most widely issued small arm during the early stages in the Vietnam War and remained in service in large numbers until the fall of Saigon. The South Vietnamese would also receive 220,300 M1 Garands and 520 M1C/M1D rifles, and 640,000 M16 rifles.

The Viet Minh and the Viet Cong also used large numbers of M1 and M2 carbines, captured from the French, ARVN and local militia forces of South Vietnam, as well as receiving many thousands of carbines from the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), China and North Korea. Over time, the SKS and eventually the AK-47 would replace the carbine to become the dominant weapons used by the Viet Cong.

=== South Korea ===
The Republic of Korea Armed Forces received 1,015,568 M1 and M2 carbines from 1963 to 1972. Along with hundreds of thousands of Carbines and M1 Garands provided by the United States Army before, during and shortly after the Korean War, South Korea would become the largest single recipient of American M1 and M2 carbines.

The Republic of Korea Armed Forces in Vietnam used M1 and M2 carbines in the early years of participation of the Vietnam War until the forces received the M16 rifle from the United States.

=== Philippines ===
The government of the Philippines still issues M1 carbines to the infantrymen of the Philippine Army&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Division assigned in Luzon Island (some units are issued just M14 automatic rifles and M1 carbines) and the Civilian Auxiliary Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) and Civilian Volunteer Organizations (CVO) spread throughout the Philippines. Certain provincial police units of the Philippine National Police (PNP) still use government-issued M1 carbines as well as some operating units of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). In many provinces in the Philippines, M1 carbines are still a highly valued light small arm. Elements of the New People&#x27;s Army and Islamic secessionist movements value the carbine as a lightweight weapon and preferred choice for mountain and ambush operations.

The M1 carbine has become one of the most recognized firearms in Philippine society, with the Marikina-based company ARMSCOR Philippines still continues to manufacture .30 caliber ammunition for the Philippine market.

=== Latin America ===
The M1 and M2 carbines were widely used by military, police, and security forces and their opponents during the many guerrilla and civil wars throughout Latin America until the 1990s, when they were mostly replaced by more modern designs. A notable user was Che Guevara who used them during the Cuban Revolution and in Bolivia where he was executed by a Bolivian soldier armed with an M2 carbine. Guevara&#x27;s fellow revolutionary Camilo Cienfuegos also used an M2 carbine that he modified with the pistol grip and foregrip from a Thompson submachine gun. Cienfuegos&#x27; carbine is on display in the Museum of the Revolution (Cuba).

In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a police battalion named &quot;Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais&quot; (BOPE, or &quot;Special Police Operations Battalion&quot;) still uses the M1 carbine.

==Variants==

The standard-issue versions of the carbine officially listed and supported were the M1, M1A1, M2 and M3.

===Carbine, Cal .30, M1A1===
* Side-folding stock, 15-round box magazine
* Paratrooper model
* About 150,000 produced

The M1A1 was designed in May 1942 for paratrooper units, and came with a folding stock, but was otherwise identical to a standard M1. M1A1 carbines were made by Inland, a division of General Motors and originally came with the early &quot;L&quot; nonadjustable sight and barrel band without bayonet lug. Inland production of M1A1 carbines was interspersed with Inland production of M1 carbines with the standard stock. Stocks were often swapped out as carbines were refurbished at arsenals.

===Carbine, Cal .30, M1A2===
* Proposed variant with improved sight adjustable for windage and elevation
* Produced only as an &quot;overstamped&quot; model (an arsenal-refurbished M1 with new rear sight and other late M1 improvements)

===Carbine, Cal .30, M1A3===
* Underside-folding pantograph stock, 15-round magazine
* Type standardized to replace the M1A1 but may not have been issued
* Pantograph stock was more rigid than the M1A1&#x27;s folding stock and folded flush under the fore end. A more common name for this type of stock is an &quot;underfolder&quot;.

===Carbine, Cal .30, M2===

* Mid to late 1944
* Selective fire (capable of semi-automatic or fully automatic fire)
* 15-round magazine or 30-round magazine
* About 600,000 produced

Initially, the M1 carbine was intended to have a selective-fire capability, but the decision was made to put the M1 into production without this feature. Fully automatic capability was incorporated into the design of the M2 (an improved, selective-fire version of the M1), introduced in 1944. The M2 featured the late M1 improvements to the rear sight, addition of a bayonet lug, and other minor changes.

Research into a conversion kit for selective fire began May 1944; the first kit was developed by Inland engineers, and known as the &quot;T4&quot;. Inland was awarded a contract for 500 T4 carbines in September 1944. Although the conversion was seen as satisfactory, the heavier 30-round magazine put greater strain on the magazine catch, necessitating the development of a sturdier catch. The slide, sear, and stock design also had to be modified. On fully automatic fire, the T4 model could fire about 750 rounds per minute, and generated a manageable recoil.

Although some carbines were marked at the factory as M2, the only significant difference between an M1 and M2 carbine is in the fire control group. The military issued field conversion kits (T17 and T18) to convert an M1 to an M2. Legally a carbine marked M2 is always a machine gun for national firearms registry purposes.

These M2 parts including the heavier M2 stock were standardized for arsenal rebuild of M1 and M1A1 carbines.

A modified round bolt replaced the original flat top bolt to save machining steps in manufacture. Many sources erroneously refer to this round bolt as an &quot;M2 bolt&quot; but it was developed as a standard part for new manufacture M1 and later M2 carbines and as a replacement part, with priority given to use on M1A1 and M2 carbines. The slightly heavier round bolt did moderate the cyclic rate of the M2 on full automatic.

Despite being in demand, very few M2 carbines saw use during World War II, and then mostly in the closing days against Japan. The M2 carbine was logistically compatible with the millions of M1 carbines in U.S. service, and offered longer range, better accuracy and better penetration than (pistol caliber) submachine guns like the M1 Thompsons and M3 Grease Guns. Therefore, after World War II, the M2 carbine largely replaced the submachine-guns in U.S. service, until it was itself replaced by the M16 rifle.

The M2 model was the most widely used carbine variant during the Korean War. A detailed study of the effectiveness of the M2 in the war was assembled by S. L. A. Marshall. He found that many troops complained on the lack of effective range of the gun, which allowed the enemy to get close enough to throw hand grenades. A more detailed analysis showed however that most troops who complained actually tended to run low on ammo, because they fired their M2 on fully automatic too soon. Troops who fired their guns on semi-automatic at distance generally complained less about the M2&#x27;s effectiveness. Generally, the more seasoned troops used the latter approach. The carbine was usually given to second line troops (administrative, support, etc.), who had little combat experience and also did not have much training in small-unit tactics, but who usually had to engage the enemy at some critical moment, like a breakthrough or ambush. Marshall noted that almost all killing shots with carbines in Korea were at ranges of or less. The M2 was a preferred weapon for night patrols. The M2 was also used in the early stages of the Vietnam War by special forces, ARVN advisers, and air crews.

Contemporary authors have struggled to categorize the M2 carbine. While it did introduce select-fire capability and an intermediate cartridge, its stopping power and weight was far below that of the StG 44. As such, it is considered by some to be an early predecessor to the assault rifle or personal defense weapon.

===Carbine, Cal .30, M2A1===
* M2 with an M1A1 folding stock. Like the M1A1, it was made for paratroopers.

===Carbine, Cal .30, M2A2===
* Arsenal-refurbished (over stamped M2) model

===Carbine, Cal .30, M3===
* M2 with mounting (T3 mount) for an early active (infrared) night vision sight
* About 3,000 produced
* Three versions of night sight (M1, M2, M3)

The M3 carbine was an M2 carbine fitted with a mount designed to accept an infrared sight for use at night. It was initially used with the M1 sniperscope, and an active infrared sight, and saw action in 1945 with the Army during the invasion of Okinawa. Before the M3 carbine and M1 sniperscope were type-classified, they were known as the T3 and T120, respectively. The system continued to be developed, and by the time of the Korean War, the M3 carbine was used with the M3 sniperscope.

The M2 sniper scope extended the effective nighttime range of the M3 carbine to . In the later stages of the Korean War, an improved version of the M3 carbine, with a revised mount, a forward pistol grip, and a new M3 sniperscope design was used in the latter stages of Korea and briefly in Vietnam. The M3 sniperscope had a large active infrared spotlight mounted on top of the scope body itself, allowing use in the prone position. The revised M3/M3 had an effective range of around . Eventually, the M3 carbine and its M3 sniperscope would be superseded by passive-design night vision scopes with extended visible ranges; the improved scopes in turn required the use of rifle-caliber weapons with flatter trajectories and increased hit probability.

==Derivatives, conversions, and commercial copies==
Several companies manufactured copies of the M1 carbine after World War II, which varied in quality. Some companies used a combination of original USGI and new commercial parts, while others manufactured entire firearms from new parts, which may or may not be of the same quality as the originals. These copies were marketed to the general public and police agencies but were not made for or used by the U.S. military.

In 1963, firearms designer Col. Melvin M. Johnson developer of the M1941 Johnson rifle offered the US Military a conversion of original US Military M1 carbines to his new 5.7mm MMJ cartridge, while also introducing a newly manufactured version of the M1 carbine called the &quot;Spitfire&quot; made by his Johnson Arms, Inc. business that was designed and built specifically for this new wildcat cartridge (also known as the 5.7 mm MMJ or .22 Spitfire). The Spitfire was advertised firing a 40-grain (2.6 g) bullet with a muzzle velocity of , though handloaders with careful selection of modern powders and appropriate bullets consistently safely exceed those numbers while remaining within the M1 carbine&#x27;s maximum pressure rating of . In comparison, the &quot;standard&quot; load for the .30 Carbine has a .30 Carbine ball bullet weighing 110 grains (7.1 g); a complete loaded round weighs 195 grains (12.6 g) and has a muzzle velocity of , giving it 967 ft⋅lbf (1,311 joules) of energy when fired from the M1 carbine&#x27;s barrel.

Johnson advertised the smaller caliber and the modified carbine as a survival rifle for use in jungles or other remote areas. It provided for light, easily carried ammunition in a light, fast handling carbine with negligible recoil. While the concept had some military application when used for this role in the selective-fire M2 carbine, it was not pursued, and few Spitfire carbines were made.

More recently, the Auto-Ordnance division of Kahr Arms began production of an M1 carbine replica in 2005 based on the typical M1 carbine as issued in 1944, without the later adjustable sight or barrel band with bayonet lug. The original Auto-Ordnance had produced various parts for IBM carbine production during World War II but did not manufacture complete carbines until the introduction of this replica. The AOM110 and AOM120 models (no longer produced) featured birch stocks and handguards, Parkerized receivers, flip-style rear sights and barrel bands without bayonet lugs. The current AOM130 and AOM140 models are identical except for American walnut stocks and handguards.

In 2014, Inland Manufacturing, LLC in Dayton, Ohio introduced the reproduction of the &quot;Inland M1 carbine&quot;. Inland Manufacturing, LLC is a private entity that is producing reproductions of the M1 carbine and M1A1 paratrooper models that were built by the original Inland Division of General Motors from 1941 to 1945. The new Inland M1 carbines feature many of the same characteristics of the original Inland carbines and are manufactured in the US. The M1 carbine is modeled after the last production model that Inland manufactured in 1945 and features a Type 3 bayonet lug and barrel band, adjustable rear sights, push button safety, round bolt, and &quot;low wood&quot; walnut stock, and a 15-round magazine. A 30-round mag catch was utilized to allow high-capacity magazines. A &quot;1944&quot; M1 carbine is also available that has the same features as the 1945 only with a Type 2 barrel Band and 10-round magazine and is available for sale in most states with magazine capacity and bayonet lug restrictions. The M1A1 is modeled after a late production 1944 M1A1 paratrooper model with a folding &quot;low wood&quot; walnut stock, Type two barrel band, and includes the same adjustable sights which were actually introduced in 1944.

An Israeli arms company (Advanced Combat Systems) offers a modernized bullpup variant called the Hezi SM-1. The company claims accuracy of 1.5 MOA at .

===Derivatives===
====Ingram SAM====
The Ingram SAM rifles are M1 carbine derivatives in 5.56×45mm NATO (SAM-1), 7.62×39mm (SAM-2) and 7.62×51mm NATO (SAM-3). The 5.56×45mm versions accept M16 magazines, the 7.62×39mm accept AK magazines and the 7.62×51mm versions use FN FAL magazines. They did not catch on in competition against the Ruger Mini-14 in both the police and civilian markets. The Ingram SAM rifles are occasionally found on auction sites for collectors.

====9×19mm Parabellum====
Iver Johnson&#x27;s 9×19mm Parabellum carbine was introduced in 1985 until 1986 using modified Browning High Power 20-round magazines.

Chiappa Firearms produces a 9mm M1 carbine derivative called the M1-9 which uses Beretta M9/92FS magazines. The Chiappa is not gas operated and instead relies on blowback operation.

==Hunting and civilian use==

Some U.S. states prohibit use of the .30 Carbine cartridge for hunting deer and larger animals due to a lessened chance of killing an animal in a single shot, even with expanding bullets. The M1 carbine is also prohibited for hunting in several states such as Pennsylvania because of the semi-automatic function, and Illinois which prohibits all non-muzzleloading rifles for big game hunting. Five-round magazines are commercially made for use in states that limit the capacity of semi-automatic hunting rifles.

After World War II, the USA decommissioned surplus M1 carbines for sale to the general public. The last batch came from Blue Sky and Arlington Ordinance in 1963 and was sold to NRA members for $20 each. Inland Mfg continues to make new M1 carbine replicas.

The M1 carbine was also used by various law enforcement agencies and prison guards and was prominently carried by riot police during the civil unrest of the late 1960s and early 1970s; until it was replaced in those roles by more modern .223 caliber semi-automatic rifles such as the Ruger Mini-14 and the Colt AR-15-type rifles in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The ease of use and great adaptability of the weapon led to it being used by Malcolm X and Patty Hearst. Both were featured in famous news photographs carrying a version the carbine. One of these firearms was also the weapon used in the 1947 assassination of notorious American mobster Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel.

<doc id="173429" wikidata="Q2287999" url="?curid=173429" title="Simon Says">
<text>Simon Says is a children&#x27;s game for three or more players. One player takes the role of &quot;Simon&quot; and issues instructions (usually physical actions such as &quot;jump in the air&quot; or &quot;stick out your tongue&quot;) to the other players, which should be followed only when succeeding the phrase &quot;Simon says&quot;. Players are eliminated from the game by either following instructions that are not immediately preceded by the phrase, or by failing to follow an instruction which does include the phrase &quot;Simon says&quot;. It is the ability to distinguish between genuine and fake commands, rather than physical ability, that usually matters in the game; in most cases, the action just needs to be attempted.

The object for the player acting as Simon is to get all the other players out as quickly as possible; the winner of the game is usually the last player who has successfully followed all of the given commands. Occasionally, however, two or more of the last players may all be eliminated at the same time, thus resulting in Simon winning the game.

The game is embedded in popular culture, with numerous references in films, music, and literature.

In Ireland, and some parts of the United Kingdom, the game is also known as &quot;O&#x27;Grady says&quot;.

==Other languages==
This game has translated across multiple cultures, many of them retaining the name Simon. Others substitute another name (&quot;Yakup der ki&quot; / &quot;Jacob says&quot; in Turkish), refer to some authority figure as with قال المعلّم / &quot;The teacher says&quot; in Lebanon, or use the verb alone as with &quot;Mando&quot; / &quot;I say&quot; in Spanish.

==Gameplay and variants==
A command starting with &quot;Simon says&quot; means that the players must obey that command. A command &quot;without&quot; the beginning &quot;Simon says&quot; means do not do this action. Anyone who breaks one of these two rules is eliminated from the remainder of the game. Often, anyone who speaks is also eliminated.

There can be very complex and difficult command chains, such as &quot;Simon says: Arms up. Simon says: Arms down. Arms up.&quot; Anyone ending with their arms up is eliminated, because a command that doesn&#x27;t begin with &quot;Simon says&quot; cannot be obeyed.

It is considered cheating to give impossible commands (&quot;Simon says, lift both of your legs up and keep them there!&quot;) or phrase the commands in such a way that the other player has no option but to &#x27;go out&#x27; (&quot;Simon says, jump up. Come down.&quot;). However, at least in some versions, it is allowed for Simon to eliminate players by asking them to do something seemingly unrelated to the game (example: &quot;Anyone remaining join me up here.&quot;).

===Simon says (electronic version)===

The electronic game &quot;Simon&quot; is named for Simon Says. Instead of having to listen to the presence of the instruction phrase, the player has to repeat a short sequence of button presses after demonstration by the device. This gameplay has been repeated as minigame in many subsequent video games and is often confusingly referred to as &quot;Simon Says&quot; as well, despite the differences from the playground game

===Do this do that===

A variation on the instruction phrases is used in this variant. Instead of only actions beginning with &quot;Simon says&quot; having to be obeyed, an action along with the phrase &quot;do &quot;this&quot;&quot; must be obeyed while an action with the phrase &quot;do &quot;that&quot;&quot; must not be obeyed. Obeying a &quot;do that&quot; command or not obeying a &quot;do this&quot; command will eliminate a player. In Swedish, this variant is known as Gör si, gör så.

===Bird Fly===
This variant, found in India, Pakistan, Germany, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Hungary, puts the focus on the specifics of the instruction phrase. The Simon announces the phrase &quot;All X fly&quot; or similar (i.e. &quot;Chidiya ud&quot; (Hindi) which translates to &quot;Bird fly&quot; or &quot;Alle Vögel fliegen hoch&quot; (German) which is &quot;All birds fly up&quot;), with the subject replaced by various creatures and objects. If the subject can fly, the other children have to perform an action, but have to stay still if it cannot fly. The action is usually fixed, involving raising the arms or jumping.

===Following John===

A similar Swedish child&#x27;s game is &quot;Följa John&quot; meaning &quot;following John&quot;, where physical actions are conducted by &quot;John&quot; (usually involving movement in a line), and where remaining participants are replicating the activities shown by John. However, the commands are silent, and based on the remaining participants observation of John&#x27;s actions. Especially when performed in a line, this can become a physical action equivalent of the game Telephone.

<text>&quot;Fin de siècle&quot; () is a French term meaning “end of century,” a phrase which typically encompasses both the meaning of the similar English idiom &quot;turn of the century&quot; and also makes reference to the closing of one era and onset of another. Without context, the term is typically used to refer to the end of the 19th century. This period was widely thought to be a period of social degeneracy, but at the same time a period of hope for a new beginning. The “spirit” of &quot;fin de siècle&quot; often refers to the cultural hallmarks that were recognized as prominent in the 1880s and 1890s, including ennui, cynicism, pessimism, and “a widespread belief that civilization leads to decadence.”

The term is commonly applied to French art and artists, as the traits of the culture first appeared there, but the movement affected many European countries. The term becomes applicable to the sentiments and traits associated with the culture, as opposed to focusing solely on the movement&#x27;s initial recognition in France. The ideas and concerns developed by &quot;fin de siècle&quot; artists provided the impetus for movements such as symbolism and modernism.

The themes of &quot;fin de siècle&quot; political culture were very controversial and have been cited as a major influence on fascism and as a generator of the science of geopolitics, including the theory of . Professor of Historical Geography at the University of Nottingham, Michael Heffernan, and Mackubin Thomas Owens wrote about the origins of geopolitics:

The “new world of the twentieth century would need to be understood in its entirety, as an integrated global whole.” Technology and global communication made the world “smaller” and turned it into a single system; the time was characterized by pan-ideas and a utopian “one-worldism,” proceeding further than pan-ideas.

The major political theme of the era was that of revolt against materialism, rationalism, positivism, bourgeois society, and liberal democracy. The fin de siècle generation supported emotionalism, irrationalism, subjectivism, and vitalism, while the mindset of the age saw civilization as being in a crisis that required a massive and total solution.

==Fin de siècle syndrome==

Michael Heffernan in his article [End of the century, end of the world?] (2000) finds in the Christian world what he calls &quot;the syndrome of fin de siècle&quot;. In 2000, this took the form of the Year 2000 problem. are accompanied by future expectations:

==Degeneration theory==
B. A. Morel&#x27;s degeneration theory was a theory that held that although societies can progress, they can also remain static or even regress if influenced by a flawed environment, such as national conditions or outside cultural influences. This degeneration was described as being passed from generation to generation, resulting in imbecility and senility due to hereditary influence. Max Nordau&#x27;s &quot;Degeneration&quot; held that the two dominant traits of those degenerated in a society involve ego mania and mysticism. The former term was understood to mean a pathological degree of self-absorption and unreasonable attention to one&#x27;s own sentiments and activities, as can be seen in the extremely descriptive nature of minute details; the latter referred to the impaired ability to translate primary perceptions into fully developed ideas, largely noted in symbolist works. Nordau&#x27;s treatment of these traits as degenerative qualities lends to the perception of a world falling into decay through fin de siècle corruptions of thought, and influencing the pessimism growing in Europe&#x27;s philosophical consciousness. As fin de siècle citizens, attitudes tended toward science in an attempt to decipher the world in which they lived. The focus on psycho-physiology, now psychology, was a large part of fin de siècle society in that it studied a topic that could not be depicted through Romanticism, but relied on traits exhibited to suggest how the mind works, as does symbolism. The concept of genius returned to popular consciousness around this period through Max Nordau&#x27;s work with degeneration, prompting study of artists supposedly affected by social degeneration and what separates imbecility from genius. The genius and the imbecile were determined to have largely similar character traits, including and . The first, which means delusions of grandeur, begins with a disproportionate sense of importance in one&#x27;s own activities and results in a sense of alienation, as Nordau describes in Baudelaire, as well as the second characteristic of madness of doubt, which involves intense indecision and extreme preoccupation with minute detail. The difference between degenerate genius and degenerate madman become the extensive knowledge held by the genius in a few areas paired with a belief in one&#x27;s own superiority as a result. Together, these psychological traits lend to originality, eccentricity, and a sense of alienation, all symptoms of (the evil of the century) that impacted French youth at the beginning of the 19th century until expanding outward and eventually influencing the rest of Europe approaching the turn of the century.

==Pessimism==

England&#x27;s ideological space was affected by the philosophical waves of pessimism sweeping Europe, starting with philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s work from before 1860 and gradually influencing artists internationally. R. H. Goodale identified 235 essays by British and American authors concerning pessimism, ranging from 1871 to 1900, showing the prominence of pessimism in conjunction with English ideology. Further, Oscar Wilde&#x27;s references to pessimism in his works demonstrate the relevance of the ideology on the English. In &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;, Wilde&#x27;s protagonist asks another character whether &quot;at heart, [she is] an optimist or a pessimist? Those seem to be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.&quot; Wilde&#x27;s reflection on personal philosophy as more culturally significant than religion lends credence to degeneration theory, as applied to Baudelaire&#x27;s influence on other nations. However, the optimistic Romanticism popular earlier in the century would also have affected the shifting ideological landscape. The newly fashionable pessimism appears again in Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, written that same year:
Lane is philosophically current as of 1895, reining in his master&#x27;s optimism about the weather by reminding Algernon of how the world typically operates. His pessimism gives satisfaction to Algernon; the perfect servant of a gentleman is one who is philosophically aware. Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s work demonstrates some of the pessimism expected of the time, and his work with modernity exemplified the decadence and decay with which turn-of-the-century French art is associated, while his work with symbolism promoted the mysticism Nordau associated with fin de siècle artists. Baudelaire&#x27;s pioneering translations of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s verse supports the aesthetic role of translation in fin de siècle culture, while his own works influenced French and English artists through the use of modernity and symbolism. Baudelaire, Rimbaud, and their contemporaries became known as French decadents, a group that influenced its English counterpart, the aesthetes like Oscar Wilde. Both groups believed the purpose of art was to evoke an emotional response and demonstrate the beauty inherent in the unnatural as opposed to trying to teach its audience an infallible sense of morality.

==Literary conventions==
In the Victorian fin de siècle, the themes of degeneration and anxiety are expressed not only through the physical landscape which provided a backdrop for Gothic Literature, but also through the human body itself. Works such as Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; (1886), Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1891), Arthur Machen&#x27;s &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; (1894), H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895), Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897) and Richard Marsh&#x27;s &quot;The Beetle&quot; (1897) all explore themes of change, development, evolution, mutation, corruption and decay in relation to the human body and mind. These literary conventions were a direct reflection of many evolutionary, scientific, social and medical theories and advancements that emerged toward the end of the 19th century.

==Artistic conventions==

The works of the Decadents and the Aesthetes contain the hallmarks typical of fin de siècle art. Holbrook Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Eighteen Nineties&quot; describes the characteristics of English decadence, which are: perversity, artificiality, egoism, and curiosity. The first trait is the concern for the perverse, unclean, and unnatural. Romanticism encouraged audiences to view physical traits as indicative of one&#x27;s inner self, whereas the fin de siècle artists accepted beauty as the basis of life, and so valued that which was not conventionally beautiful.
This belief in beauty in the abject leads to the obsession with artifice and symbolism, as artists rejected ineffable ideas of beauty in favour of the abstract. Through symbolism, aesthetes could evoke sentiments and ideas in their audience without relying on an infallible general understanding of the world.

The third trait of the culture is egoism, a term similar to that of &quot;egomania&quot;, meaning disproportionate attention placed on one&#x27;s own endeavours. This can result in a type of alienation and anguish, as in Baudelaire&#x27;s case, and demonstrates how aesthetic artists chose cityscapes over country as a result of their aversion to the natural.

Finally, curiosity is identifiable through diabolism and the exploration of the evil or immoral, focusing on the morbid and macabre, but without imposing any moral lessons on the audience.
