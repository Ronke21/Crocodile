<text>Joseph &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; Wheeler (September 10, 1836 – January 25, 1906) was a military commander and politician of the Confederate States of America. He was a cavalry general in the Confederate States Army in the 1860s during the American Civil War, and then a general in the United States Army during both the Spanish-American and Philippine–American Wars near the turn of the twentieth century. For much of the Civil War, he was the senior cavalry general in the Army of Tennessee and fought in most of its battles in the Western Theater.

Between the Civil War and the Spanish–American War, Wheeler served multiple terms as a U.S. Representative from the state of Alabama as a Democrat.

==Early life==
Although of old New England ancestry (descended from the English Puritans who came to New England during the Puritan migration to New England), Joseph Wheeler was born near Augusta, Georgia, and spent some of his early childhood growing up with relatives in Derby, Connecticut while also spending about half of each year in Georgia. Joseph Wheeler and Julia Knox Hull Wheeler were his parents. He was the grandson of Brigadier General William Hull, a veteran of the American Revolution.

Despite his being partially brought up in the northern United States, and being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point from the state of New York, Wheeler always considered himself a Georgian and Southerner.
Wheeler entered West Point in July 1854, barely meeting the height requirement at the time for entry. He graduated on July 1, 1859, placing 19th out of 22 cadets, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Dragoons. He attended the U.S. Army Cavalry School located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and upon completion was transferred on June 26, 1860, to the Regiment of Mounted Rifles stationed in the New Mexico Territory.

It was while stationed in New Mexico and fighting in a skirmish with Indians that Joseph Wheeler picked up the nickname &quot;Fighting Joe.&quot; On September 1, 1860, he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant.

==Civil War==

===Early service===
At the start of the Civil War, Wheeler entered the Confederate States Army on March 16 as a first lieutenant in the Georgia state militia artillery and then was assigned to Fort Barrancas off of Pensacola, Florida, reporting to Maj. Gen. Braxton Bragg. His resignation from the U.S. Army was accepted on April 22, 1861. He was ordered to Huntsville, Alabama, to take command of the newly formed 19th Alabama Infantry Regiment and was promoted to colonel on September 4.

Wheeler and the 19th Alabama fought well under Bragg at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. During the Siege of Corinth in April and May, Wheeler&#x27;s men on picket duty repeatedly clashed with U.S. patrols. Serving as acting brigade commander, Wheeler burned the bridges over the Tuscumbia River to cover the Confederate retreat to Tupelo, Mississippi.

===Middle Tennessee===
From September to October, Wheeler transferred to the cavalry branch and commanded the 2nd Cavalry Brigade of the Left Wing in the Army of Mississippi. During the Confederate Heartland Offensive, Wheeler aggressively maintained contact with the U.S. Army. He began to suffer from poor relations with Nathan Bedford Forrest, when Bragg reassigned most of Forrest&#x27;s men to Wheeler, sending Forrest to Murfreesboro, Tennessee to recruit a new brigade. Wheeler fought at the Battle of Perryville in October and, after the fight, performed an excellent rearguard action protecting the army&#x27;s retreat. He was promoted to brigadier general on October 30 and led the cavalry belonging to the Second Corps, Army of Tennessee, from November to December. During the action at La Vergne, Tennessee, on November 27, Wheeler was wounded by an artillery shell that exploded near him.

In December 1862, the U.S. Army of the Cumberland began to advance from Nashville against Bragg&#x27;s army. Now commanding all of the Army of Tennessee&#x27;s cavalry, Wheeler skirmished aggressively to delay their advance. He drove into the rear of the U.S. army, destroying hundreds of wagons and capturing more than 700 prisoners. After the Battle of Stones River, as Bragg&#x27;s army withdrew to the Duck River line, Wheeler struck the U.S. supply lines at Harpeth Shoals on January 12–13, burning three steamboats and capturing more than 400 prisoners. Bragg recommended that Wheeler be promoted as a &quot;just reward&quot;, and he became a major general on January 20, 1863.

Wheeler led the army&#x27;s Cavalry Corps from January to November 24, then from December to November 15, 1864. For his actions on January 12–13, 1863, Wheeler and his troopers received the Thanks of the Confederate Congress on May 1, 1863.

In February 1863, Wheeler and Forrest attacked Fort Donelson at Dover, Tennessee, but the small U.S. garrison repulsed them. Forrest angrily told Wheeler, &quot;Tell [General Bragg] that I will be in my coffin before I will fight again under your command.&quot; Bragg dealt with this rivalry in the Tullahoma Campaign by assigning Wheeler to guard the army&#x27;s right flank while Forrest guarded the left. A Union cavalry advance on Shelbyville on June 27 trapped Wheeler and 50 of his men on the north side of the Duck River, forcing Wheeler to plunge his horse over a 15-foot embankment and escape through the rain-swollen river.

===Chickamauga and Chattanooga===

Wheeler and his troopers guarded the army&#x27;s left flank at the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863. After the routed U.S. army collected in Chattanooga, Gen. Bragg sent Wheeler&#x27;s men into central Tennessee to destroy railroads and Federal supply lines in a major raid. On October 2, his attack at Anderson&#x27;s Cross Roads (also known as Powell&#x27;s Crossroads) destroyed more than 700 U.S. supply wagons, tightening the Confederate siege of Chattanooga. Pursued by U.S. soldiers, Wheeler advanced to McMinnville and captured its 600-man garrison. There were more actions at Murfreesboro and Farmington. Still, by October 9, Wheeler safely crossed the Tennessee River at Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The extensive raid and a subsequent northern movement to assist Longstreet in his siege of Knoxville would cause the mounted arm of the army to miss the Chattanooga Campaign (November 23–25). Wheeler covered Bragg&#x27;s retreat from Chattanooga following the Union breakthrough at Missionary Ridge on November 25 and received a wound in his foot as his cavalry and Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne&#x27;s infantry fought at the Battle of Ringgold Gap on November 27.

===Georgia and the Carolinas===
During U.S. Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s Atlanta Campaign, Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry corps screened the flanks of the Army of Tennessee as Gen. Joseph E. Johnston drew back from several positions toward Atlanta. In July, Sherman sent two large cavalry columns to destroy the railroads supplying the defenders of Atlanta. With fewer than 5,000 cavalrymen, Wheeler defeated the enemy raids, capturing one of the two commanding generals, Maj. Gen. George Stoneman (the highest-ranking U.S. prisoner of war). In August, Wheeler&#x27;s corps crossed the Chattahoochee River in an attempt to destroy the railroad Sherman was using to supply his force from Chattanooga. Wheeler&#x27;s men captured the town of Dalton, but he failed to defeat the U.S. garrison protected in a nearby fort. Wheeler then took his men into East Tennessee, crossing the Tennessee River above Knoxville. His raid continued to the west, causing minor interruptions in the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad and then continued south through Franklin, Tennessee, until he recrossed the Tennessee at Tuscumbia, Alabama. The raid Wheeler was ordered to undertake was described by historian Ed Bearss as a &quot;Confederate disaster&quot; because it caused minimal damage to the United States while denying Gen. John Bell Hood, now in command of the Army of Tennessee, the direct support of his cavalry arm. Without accurate intelligence of Sherman&#x27;s dispositions, Hood lost the Battle of Jonesborough and was forced to evacuate Atlanta. Wheeler rendezvoused with Hood&#x27;s army in early October after destroying the railroad bridge at Resaca. That said, the blame for this defeat cannot be laid at Wheeler&#x27;s feet.

In late 1864, Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry did not accompany Hood on his Franklin–Nashville Campaign back into Tennessee and was virtually the only effective Confederate force to oppose Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea to Savannah. However, his resistance to Sherman did little to comfort Georgia civilians, and lax discipline within his command caused great dissatisfaction. Robert Toombs said, &quot;I hope to God he will never get back to Georgia.&quot; Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill wrote that &quot;the whole of Georgia is full of bitter complaints of Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry.&quot; A telling encounter between Wheeler and Sherman is documented in one of Sherman&#x27;s reports. This incident occurred after Gen. Jeff C Davis decided to dismantle a pontoon bridge to distance his army from a group of escaped slaves who sought refuge and safety with the Union forces. 
According to Sherman&#x27;s account, Wheeler ordered his cavalry to charge the refugees. This action forced the men, women, and children into the water, where it is presumed many drowned.

Wheeler and his men continued to attempt to stop Sherman in the 1865 Carolinas Campaign. He defeated a U.S. cavalry force under Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick in South Carolina at the Battle of Aiken on February 11. He was replaced as cavalry chief by Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton III and fought under him at the Battle of Bentonville on March 19–20. While attempting to cover Confederate President Jefferson Davis&#x27;s flight south and west in May, Wheeler was captured at Conyer&#x27;s Station just east of Atlanta. He had intended to reach the Trans-Mississippi and Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, still resisting out west, and had with him three officers from his staff and 11 privates when he was taken. Wheeler was imprisoned for two months, first at Fort Monroe and then in solitary confinement at Fort Delaware, where he was paroled on June 8.

During his career in the Confederate States Army, Wheeler was wounded three times, lost 36 staff officers to combat, and a total of 16 horses were shot from under him. Military historian Ezra J. Warner believed that Wheeler&#x27;s actions leading cavalry in the conflict &quot;were second only to those of Bedford Forrest&quot;.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

After the war, Wheeler became a planter and a lawyer near Courtland, Alabama, where he married and raised a family. His home, Pond Spring, in an area now known as Wheeler, Alabama, is a historical site owned by the Alabama Historical Commission.

In 1880, Wheeler was elected from Alabama as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives. Wheeler&#x27;s opponent, Greenback incumbent William M. Lowe, contested the election. After a contentious legal battle that lasted over a year, Lowe was declared the winner and assumed the seat on June 3, 1882. Lowe served only four months before dying of tuberculosis. Wheeler won a special election to return and serve the remaining weeks of the term.

Wheeler supported the election of Luke Pryor in 1882 and did not run for reelection, but was elected again in 1884 and re-elected to seven subsequent terms before resigning in 1900. While in Congress, Wheeler strove to heal the breach between the slave states and the United States and championed policies to help rebuild the southern U.S. economy. At the 1884 Democratic National Convention, Wheeler supported Grover Cleveland to be the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for President of the United States.

In foreign policy, Wheeler was outspokenly Anglophile; he sought a closer relationship between the United States and the British Empire and is regarded as one of the earliest advocates of what would later be called the &quot;Special Relationship&quot; between the United States of America and the United Kingdom. When he was asked during the 1888 United States presidential election if he believed that President Grover Cleveland was &quot;as pro-British as people say&quot;, Wheeler replied by saying, &quot;No, but he ought to be.&quot; While in Washington DC between 1886 and 1887, he formed a friendship with Lionel Sackville-West, 2nd Baron Sackville, the British &quot;Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States&quot;. He described Sackville West as &quot;an absolute gentleman&quot; and &quot;very forward&quot; as well as &quot;manful&quot; and &quot;impeccably honest.&quot; By contrast, he described French President Jules Grévy as &quot;a dumb sumbitch&quot; in a statement which he later refused to retract, despite pressure from allies in Washington DC to do so.

In January 1890, when House Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed began the process of eliminating the disappearing quorum by calling the names of House members who refused to answer, Wheeler climbed onto one of the desks and then proceeded to leap from desk to desk in an attempt to reach the center and stop the Speaker.

==Spanish–American War==

In 1898, Wheeler, now aged 61, volunteered for the Spanish–American War, receiving an appointment to major general of volunteers from President William McKinley. He assumed command of the cavalry division, which included Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders, and was nominally second-in-command of the Fifth Army Corps. He sailed for Cuba and was charged with scouting for the U.S. advance by General William Rufus Shafter, overall commander of V Corps. He was ordered not to engage the enemy on his own until the American troop disembarkation had been completed.

Approaching Las Guasimas de Sevilla on June 24, American reports suggested the Spaniards were digging in with a field gun; however, Cuban scouts contradicted these, revealing the Spaniards were preparing to abandon their position. In fact, the Spanish troops at the position had received orders to fall back on Santiago. Wheeler requested the assistance of the attached Cuban forces in an immediate attack, but their commander, Col. Gonzales Clavel, refused. Wheeler attacked anyway, rushing his men forward with two guns to the front. Colonel Young&#x27;s brigade led the advance against the Spanish columns in what came to be called the Battle of Las Guasimas, the first major engagement of the war.

During the excitement of the battle, Wheeler is said to have called out, &quot;Let&#x27;s go, boys! We&#x27;ve got the damn Yankees on the run again!&quot; Wheeler&#x27;s forces moved to encircle the Spaniards&#x27; first battle line, assaulting its front and right flank, but were repelled. During a pause in the fighting, both sides reinforced their positions. The Spaniards sent forward two companies of the &quot;San Fernando Battalion&quot;, along with the artillery. After midday, the U.S. attack was renewed, but Spanish Comandante Andrés Alcañiz, leading the &quot;Provisional de Puerto Rico Battalion&quot;, once again checked the American assault.

After halting the American advance, the Spanish resumed their ongoing withdrawal toward Santiago&#x27;s outer defenses according to their original plans. The battle had cost U.S. forces 17 dead and 52 wounded, while Spanish forces suffered seven dead and seven wounded.

Wheeler fell seriously ill during the campaign and turned over command of the division to Brig. Gen. Samuel S. Sumner. Wheeler was still incapacitated in July when the Battle of San Juan Hill began, but once he heard the sound of guns, the &quot;War Child&quot; returned to the front despite his illness. Being the senior officer at the front, he first issued orders to the 1st Division, under Jacob F. Kent, before returning to his own command. Upon taking the heights, Wheeler assured General William R. Shafter that the position could be held against a counterattack. He led the division through the Siege of Santiago and was a senior member of the peace commission.

Wheeler&#x27;s youngest son died shortly after his return from serving in Cuba; he drowned while swimming in the ocean. When back in the United States, Wheeler commanded the convalescent camp of the army at Montauk Point, now a state park in New York.

==Philippine–American War==
Wheeler sailed for the Philippines to fight in the Philippine–American War, arriving in August 1899. He commanded the First Brigade in Arthur MacArthur&#x27;s Second Division during the Philippine–American War until January 1900. During this period, Wheeler was mustered out of the volunteer service and commissioned a brigadier general in the regular army, reentering the organization he had resigned from over 39 years before, both on June 16, 1900. After hostilities, he commanded the Department of the Lakes until his retirement on September 10, 1900, and moved to New York City.

==Later life==

Wheeler wrote several books on military history and strategy and civil subjects. His first was &quot;A Revised System of Cavalry Tactics, for the Use of the Cavalry and Mounted Infantry, C.S.A.&quot; in 1863, a manual that saw use by the Confederacy. His other works include: &quot;Fitz-John Porter&quot; in 1883, &quot;The Santiago Campaign&quot; in 1898, &quot;Confederate Military History: Alabama&quot; in 1899, and &quot;Report on the Island of Guam&quot; in 1900. Wheeler also co-wrote several more books throughout the rest of his life, the last of which, &quot;The New America and the Far East: A Picturesque and Historic Description of These Lands and Peoples&quot;, was published in 1907, after his death.

Wheeler also appeared in an early film called &quot;Surrender of General Toral&quot; (1898) with William Rufus Shafter.

While attending the hundredth-anniversary celebration of the U.S. Military Academy (West Point, New York) in 1902, Wheeler approached the old West Point hotel, where his Confederate comrades James Longstreet and Edward Porter Alexander were seated on the porch. At the festivities, Wheeler wore the dress uniform of his most recent rank, that of a general in the U.S. Army. Longstreet recognized him coming near and reportedly said, &quot;Joe, I hope that Almighty God takes me before he does you, for I want to be within the gates of hell to hear Jubal Early cuss you in the blue uniform.&quot; (Longstreet did predecease Wheeler, dying in January 1904.)

General Wheeler was a member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution (joined in 1898) and the Society of Colonial Wars.

After a prolonged illness, Wheeler died in Brooklyn on January 25, 1906, at the age of 69. He is one of the few former Confederate officers buried within Arlington National Cemetery.
==Legacy==
In 1925, the state of Alabama donated a bronze statue of Joseph Wheeler to the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol. Additionally, several locations in Alabama are named after Wheeler, including Joe Wheeler State Park, Wheeler Lake and Dam, and the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge. Also, Joseph Wheeler High School in Marietta, Georgia, and Wheeler County, Georgia are named after him. During World War II, the United States Navy named a Liberty Ship in honor of Wheeler. Wheeler Road, a main thoroughfare through west Augusta is named after him as well. Furthermore, Joe Wheeler Electric Cooperative in northwest Alabama also honors him. Also Camp Wheeler, near Macon, Georgia (which served as an army base during both World Wars), was named for Wheeler.

The City of Derby, Connecticut, where Wheeler grew up, named him as one of the first members of its Hall of Fame in 2007.

Wheeler was portrayed by Gary Busey in the 1997 TV movie &quot;Rough Riders&quot;.

<doc id="171746" wikidata="Q1784471" url="?curid=171746" title="Midland Mainline (train operating company)">
<text>Midland Mainline was a train operating company in the United Kingdom that operated the Midland Main Line franchise between April 1996 and November 2007. It was owned by the British transport company National Express.

Midland Mainline took over operations of the franchise from the state-owned operator InterCity in April 1996. Originally intended to run for ten years, a two-year extension was awarded in exchange for greater investment into new rolling stock and the provision of an hourly service to . To facilitate the &quot;Project Rio&quot; services, 23 HST power cars and associated Mark 3 carriages were transferred from Virgin CrossCountry to Midland Mainline. During February 2002, Midland Mainline ordered 16 four-carriage and 7 nine-carriage Class 222 &quot;Meridian&quot; trains, the first of which entered service in May 2004. These new trainsets allowed for several HSTs to be released to other operators, such as First Great Western and Great North Eastern Railway (GNER).

Midland Mainline ran fast and semi-fast passenger services from London to the East Midlands and Yorkshire, on the Midland Main Line. Most services ran between London St Pancras and either , or . Some services extended to , , , Leeds, and . Midland Mainline operated at 27 stations, of which it managed eight. In June 2007, the Department for Transport awarded the franchise to rival company Stagecoach; accordingly, the services operated by Midland Mainline were transferred to East Midlands Trains on 11 November 2007.

==History==
The Midland Mainline franchise was awarded by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising to &quot;Midland Main Line Limited&quot; for a period of ten years with operations commencing on 28 April 1996. Shortly after the franchise commenced, the transport conglomerate National Express launched a bid to acquire Midland Main Line Limited, and thereby the franchise. The tentative acquisition was promptly referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for review as National Express not only operated an existing rail franchise but also numerous express coach services in the West Midlands. The Commission found that the deal would likely be against the public interest, leading to the Board of Trade deciding that National Express ought to commit to certain requirements in respect to coast fares and service levels. National Express consented to several restrictions, including to maintain the service levels of its coach services, to not increase fares above the increase in the Retail Price Index, and to provide verifying information to regulatory authorities so that its level of compliance to this undertakings can be ascertained. 

During May 1999, Midland Mainline was able to extend its sphere of operation following the delivery of additional rolling stock. In August 2000, the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority awarded a two-year extension in return for National Express committing itself to certain investments in the franchise, which included the ordering of new rolling stock and the running of an hourly service to Leeds.

==Service patterns==
The off peak service pattern, upon conclusion of the franchise in November 2007, consisted of four departures per hour from London St Pancras. There were two fast and two semi-fast trains per hour. All Midland Mainline services (except The Master Cutler morning up service) called at Leicester with the fastest journey time to and from London of one hour and nine minutes. The services between London, Luton and Bedford supplemented the high frequency Thameslink and later First Capital Connect commuter service.

===Limited services===
Midland Mainline operated a limited service between St Pancras and Leeds, with three early morning departures from Leeds and four evening return trips from St Pancras. This was principally because Midland Mainline&#x27;s HSTs were maintained at Neville Hill depot. The timings did not compare favourably with the principal service from London King&#x27;s Cross to Leeds along the East Coast Main Line with the Midland Main Line having a much slower line speed. The journey time on the Midland route was around three hours and 15 minutes vs two hours and 15 minutes via the East Coast.

In July 1996, a bus service between Kettering and Corby was introduced.

From May 1999, a small number of through trains from St Pancras to Burton upon Trent and Barnsley were introduced as well as stops at Belper and Meadowhall.

From May 2000, through trains between St Pancras and Matlock were introduced, ceasing in December 2004 when Class 222s were introduced, as they were not allowed on the Derwent Valley Line branch line. That same month, Midland Mainline also began operating one Saturday service between St Pancras and York via Doncaster; in summer, it would continue to Scarborough. On Sunday, a service to York started at Leicester, with the return service being via the Erewash Valley Line to Nottingham, where it reversed before proceeding to St Pancras.

A small number of trains operated between St Pancras and Sheffield via Nottingham and along the Erewash Valley Line to Chesterfield serving Langley Mill and Alfreton.

==Project Rio==
From May 2003 until September 2004, Midland Mainline operated an hourly service between St Pancras and Manchester Piccadilly; this was at the request of the Strategic Rail Authority whilst the West Coast Main Line between London Euston and Manchester underwent engineering work using former Virgin CrossCountry High Speed Trains. This temporary service was named &quot;Project Rio&quot; after the similarity of the route to footballer Rio Ferdinand&#x27;s recent transfer movements. He first transferred from West Ham United to Leeds United, then later crossed the Pennines in a £30million record transfer to Manchester United.

The service used the Midland Main Line as far as Trent Junction, before taking the Erewash Valley Line (avoiding Derby) to Clay Cross, rejoining the Midland Main Line until Dore South Junction, using Dore Tunnel Curve to join the Hope Valley Line westwards towards Manchester Piccadilly. South of Leicester, the service ran in the path of the xx:30 semi-fast Nottingham train, with an additional Leicester to Nottingham service introduced using the displaced Class 170 &quot;Turbostar&quot;.

==Named trains==
* The Robin Hood on the 06:30 Sheffield to St Pancras via Nottingham, and returning as the 17:00 St Pancras to Nottingham.
* The Master Cutler on the 06:14 Leeds to St Pancras which runs non stop from Chesterfield, and 16:55 St Pancras to Leeds return.
* The Midlands Express on the 07:05 Sheffield to St Pancras.

==Rolling stock==

Midland Mainline inherited a fleet of High Speed Trains from British Rail. Enhancements were carried out to the power cars of the HSTs, most notably a revised lighting cluster.

In April 1997, Midland Mainline ordered 13 (later expanded to 17) Class 170 &quot;Turbostars&quot; to operate stopping services. Originally, all were ordered as two-carriage sets before it was decided to increase 10 to three-carriage sets. During May 1999, the first Class 170 entered service with the operator; the type&#x27;s arrival permitted a new timetable with increased frequencies to be introduced, in which the Class 170s operated the majority of the stops south of Leicester, allowing the HSTs to be better used on the longer-distance services.

To cover for a shortage of HSTs, Midland Mainline hired two Fragonset Class 47 locomotives to top and tail a set of HSBC Rail Mark 2 carriages on a morning service from Nottingham to London St Pancras and evening return to Sheffield from February 2002. In October 2002, Midland Mainline was able to replace these, after leasing an additional five HST power cars and two sets of Mark 3 carriages that had been released by Virgin CrossCountry.

During February 2002, Midland Mainline ordered sixteen four-carriage and seven nine-carriage Class 222 &quot;Meridian&quot; trains based on Virgin CrossCountry&#x27;s Class 220 &quot;Voyager&quot;, but with developments to improve passenger comfort and address some of the criticisms aimed at the Voyager. The first of these sets entered service in May 2004. The four-carriage sets replaced the Class 170s, which were transferred to Central Trains, while the nine-carriage sets were ordered to operate a new service from London St Pancras to Leeds via Nottingham and the Erewash Valley Line. When the Strategic Rail Authority ruled that there was not enough demand for this service, the nine-carriage sets were left sitting idle until eventually they were put into use on the services between Nottingham/Sheffield and London St Pancras from July 2005, releasing one HST for hire to First Great Western while it refurbished its fleet and two other HSTs to Great North Eastern Railway (GNER) to allow that operator to run extra services to Leeds from May 2007.

As the nine-carriage Meridians were lightly loaded while the four-carriage sets were overcrowded, it was decided in 2006 to reduce all of the nine-carriage sets to eight carriages, the removed carriages then being used to extend seven of the four-carriage sets to five carriages. A further reconfiguration of the Meridians took place in 2008, shortly after East Midlands Trains took over Midland Mainline&#x27;s services, when six of the eight-carriage sets were reduced to seven carriages and the remaining set was reduced to five carriages, allowing all nine of the remaining four-carriage sets to be extended to five carriages.

To operate the Project Rio services to Manchester Piccadilly, 23 HST power cars and associated Mark 3 carriages were transferred from Virgin CrossCountry in May 2003. Whilst these were undergoing overhaul, a First Great Western HST was hired from May 2003 until February 2004. When Project Rio concluded in September 2004, some sets were transferred to First Great Western and GNER, while others went into storage.

Midland Mainline&#x27;s fleet consisted of the following trains at the time they ceased operating:

===Final fleet===
===Previous fleet===
==Stations==
Midland Mainline operated at twenty-seven stations, of which it managed eight:
London St Pancras, Wellingborough, Kettering, Market Harborough, Leicester, Derby, Chesterfield and Sheffield.

Other stations served included:
Luton Airport Parkway, Luton, Bedford Midland, Loughborough, Long Eaton, Willington, Burton upon Trent, Beeston, Nottingham, Langley Mill, Alfreton, Dronfield, Meadowhall, Barnsley, Doncaster, Wakefield Westgate, Leeds, York, Scarborough.

Stations which used to be served but then had their Midland Mainline services stop before the franchise ended:
Duffield, Ambergate, Whatstandwell, Cromford, Matlock Bath, Matlock, Stockport, Manchester Piccadilly.

==Depot==
Midland Mainline&#x27;s HSTs were maintained at Neville Hill with the rest of the fleet at Derby Etches Park.

==Demise==
As part of a redrawing of the rail franchise map from November 2007, the Midland Mainline franchise was combined with some Central Trains services into a new East Midlands franchise.

In September 2006, the Department for Transport (DfT) announced that National Express, Arriva, FirstGroup and Stagecoach had been shortlisted to bid for the new franchise. In June 2007, the DfT awarded the franchise to Stagecoach, with the services operated by Midland Mainline transferring to East Midlands Trains on 11 November 2007.

<text>Michael Ian Grade, Baron Grade of Yarmouth, (born 8 March 1943) is an English television executive and businessman. He has held a number of senior roles in television, including controller of BBC1 (1984–1986), chief executive of Channel 4 (1988–1997), chairman of the board of governors of the BBC (2004–2006), and executive chairman of ITV plc (2007–2009). He sat as a Conservative Party life peer in the House of Lords from 2011 until after his appointment as Chair of Ofcom.

In April 2022, it was announced by the Government that Grade would take up his four year appointment as chairman of Ofcom from May 2022 and would move to the crossbenches in the House of Lords at the earliest practical opportunity.

==Early life==
Grade was born into a Jewish show business family originally called Winogradsky. His father was the theatrical agent Leslie Grade, and his uncles were the impresarios Lew Grade and Bernard Delfont. When he was three years old, his non-Jewish mother (Lynn Smith) left the family to conduct a relationship with wrestling commentator Kent Walton. Grade was brought up by his paternal grandmother, and he only saw his mother once more as an adult. He was educated at Stowe School in Buckinghamshire and St Dunstan&#x27;s College in London.

==Career==
Grade joined the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in 1960, and was a sports columnist from 1964 to 1966. By his own account (as related on Channel 4 chat show &quot;The Late Clive James&quot;), the job had been organised by his father. When Leslie Grade suffered a serious stroke in 1966, the 23-year-old Michael moved into his theatrical business. In 1969, he moved to London Management &amp; Representation. Among the artists whom Grade represented were Morecambe and Wise (he successfully negotiated the duo&#x27;s defection from ATV to BBC2 in 1968) and Larry Grayson.

===LWT===
Grade entered the television industry in 1973 when he joined London Weekend Television (LWT) as deputy controller of programmes (entertainment). During this time he bought the scripts of an African-American sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot; which had an all-black cast. Adapted as &quot;The Fosters&quot; (1976–1977), it became the first British sitcom to have an entirely black cast. At LWT, Grade worked with both John Birt and Greg Dyke.

After he became director of programmes in 1977, Grade commissioned the series &quot;Mind Your Language&quot;, but later cancelled it. At an event at the Edinburgh Television Festival in 1985, he agreed that the series was racist, and said that &quot;it was really irresponsible of us to put it out&quot;. In what was termed &#x27;Snatch of the Day&#x27; by the press in 1978, Grade attempted the acquisition of exclusive screening rights to Football League matches. Previously the BBC had held the more desirable rights, but the Office of Fair Trading intervened, and Grade&#x27;s purchase was revoked. The package of recorded highlights on Saturday evenings now alternates each season between ITV and the BBC.

Also in 1978, Grade managed to place under contract the entertainer Bruce Forsyth who had helped the BBC to dominate the Saturday evening television ratings through the decade via &quot;The Generation Game&quot; series. His new vehicle was titled &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Big Night&quot; and was intended to feature all his talents in one programme lasting two hours. The budget was £2million for a fourteen-week run. The new series was considered a disaster, with the press turning against the host, but did achieve an initial audience of 14 million. &quot;The Generation Game&quot;, with new host Larry Grayson, managed to achieve a larger audience. LWT&#x27;s &quot;Big Night&quot; was not recommissioned.

Grade announced at a press conference in May 1979 that LWT had secured a contract with a production company formed by television dramatist Dennis Potter and his producer Kenith Trodd. The corporate association proved short-lived, with both sides having insufficient experience for budgeting drama shot on film, and was terminated by Grade in the summer of 1980. Only three of what had been projected as six filmed plays by Potter were shot and screened. Grade though, was directly involved with some of the playwright&#x27;s later commissions.

Grade approved production of &quot;The Professionals&quot; and initiated the long-running arts&#x27; programme &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;.

In 1981, Grade left LWT to begin a two-year period as the president of Embassy Television in the United States. In &quot;The Times&quot; he was quoted as stating, &quot;It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; it is, if you like, a gamble I want to take&quot;. His pay rose from £32,000 to $250,000 per annum. During this time he was largely involved in developing and selling sitcoms in this period: &quot;When you read 30 or 40 comedy scripts a week, you get a bit barking.&quot; Grade also produced a series for the only time in his career, a nine-part adaptation of &quot;Kane and Abel&quot;, the novel by Jeffrey Archer. In a &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot; interview with Michael Freedland in 2011, Grade said he had &quot;missed public service broadcasting, real drama, news, current affairs&quot;.

===BBC===
In early summer 1984, Bill Cotton recruited Grade for BBC Television, where he became controller of BBC 1 on 1 September 1984, taking, as he told Michael Freedland, &quot;the biggest pay cut in history&quot;; his salary went down from $500,000, excluding large bonuses, to £37,000 a year. Later he became director of programmes in 1986, and managing director designate in 1987, before leaving the BBC at the end of 1987. His three-year tenure as a BBC controller was controversial.

Grade cancelled the rights to screen &quot;Dallas&quot; while fighting Thames Television for the rights to the series (although this decision was subsequently reversed). He cut short the expensive serialisation of &quot;The Tripods&quot; trilogy, written by John Christopher, because he was dissatisfied with the ratings it had achieved after two series. He also considered cancelling the sitcom &quot;Blackadder&quot;, judging the first series to be unfunny. In exchange for renewing &quot;Blackadder&quot;, he required that it become a wholly studio-based production on a lower budget.

Grade agreed to commission Dennis Potter&#x27;s serial &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; (1986) after a brief meeting with Jonathan Powell, then the BBC&#x27;s head of drama. It was a highlight of this period, but came under criticism from Mary Whitehouse and the tabloid press for its content. Referring to the depiction of an illicit sexual encounter in episode three, Grade said: &quot;There are very few people in television drama that you are prepared to trust with scenes like this. But Dennis Potter is one of them&quot;.

During his time as controller, Grade was also responsible for purchasing the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; for BBC1&#x27;s new daytime schedule; it debuted on British television on 27 October 1986. He was also responsible for repeating &quot;Neighbours&quot;, at first exclusively an afternoon programme, in a later timeslot (on the advice of his daughter, Alison, who was annoyed that she could not watch it because she was at school). This proved to be a successful scheduling decision, with audiences in excess of 18 million for the new 5.35 pm broadcasts. Other successes during Grade&#x27;s tenure included the debut of soap operas &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot; in 1985 and the hospital drama &quot;Casualty&quot; in 1986. He was also praised by Bob Geldof for agreeing to broadcast the charity rock concert Live Aid for 24 hours.

In November 1984 he decided to end screening beauty pageants, stating, &quot;I believe these contests no longer merit national air time. They are an anachronism in this day and age of equality and verging on the offensive.&quot;

====&quot;Doctor Who&quot; controversy====
Grade announced on 27 February 1985 that season 23 of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was scheduled to be transmitted from January to March 1986, would be postponed as he had decided that the programme&#x27;s budget would be better spent on other drama productions. What became an 18-month hiatus for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (the series did not resume transmission until September 1986) prompted a strong reaction from viewers. Grade was also noted for his strong dislike of the series, such as in an interview in 2004, where he said: &quot;I thought it was horrible, awful. I thought it was so outdated. It was just a little show for a few pointy head &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fans. It was also very violent and it had lost its magic&quot;. In an appearance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Room 101&quot; in 2002, Grade chose the series as one of his hates, criticised its production values and said that he had little interest in, or sympathy for, science fiction.

Eric Saward, the script editor of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; at the time of its suspension, responded to Grade&#x27;s criticism a few years later. In his view, Grade&#x27;s comments were unfair because he was in the position to allocate more resources to the programme and thus improve its quality. Actress Katy Manning, who had portrayed a companion of Jon Pertwee&#x27;s Doctor, praised Grade&#x27;s treatment of the series on the DVD commentary for &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot; (1971). In her view, Grade &quot;was actually doing the right thing&quot;, and she credited the long break prior to 2005 with rejuvenating the series.

The decision in the autumn of 1986 that season 24 of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; could only happen on the condition that Colin Baker was removed from the title role has been attributed to Grade, with him reportedly describing Baker&#x27;s portrayal as &quot;absolutely God-awful&quot;. It has also been suggested that Grade was influenced by a romantic relationship with Baker&#x27;s ex-wife, Liza Goddard. In 2022, Grade denied both that the decision to fire Baker was his and any personal relationship with Goddard. Baker&#x27;s immediate predecessor in the role, Peter Davison, argued in 2018 that the decision to dismiss the actor was more to do with the executives wanting to get rid of the series&#x27; producer, John Nathan-Turner, saying: &quot;I was upset about what happened, really – because, first of all, it wasn&#x27;t to do with Colin, I know that. It was to do with other issues. The power structure in the BBC had changed and they didn&#x27;t want John Nathan-Turner around is the truth of it.&quot;

Following the end of the first series of the revived &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2005, Grade wrote a letter to Mark Thompson, the Director-General of the BBC, congratulating all involved in the production on its success, signing-off with &quot;PS never dreamed I would ever write this. Must be going soft!&quot; In an interview for &quot;Radio Times&quot; in 2012, Grade commented: &quot;From clunky Daleks that couldn&#x27;t go up and down stairs to the filmic qualities today of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, it&#x27;s a transformation... The show still leaves me cold, but I admire it, which I never did before.&quot;

===Channel 4===
Grade left the BBC in 1987 after an unsuccessful application to succeed Alasdair Milne as director-general and a conflict with the corporation&#x27;s new deputy director-general, John Birt, a former friend and colleague at London Weekend Television. He accepted the post of chief executive of Channel 4, succeeding Jeremy Isaacs, and took up his position at the beginning of 1988. Isaacs criticised Grade&#x27;s appointment and threatened to &quot;throttle&quot; Grade if the nature of the channel was altered.

Grade phased out some of its more high-brow programming, for which he was accused of &quot;dumbing down&quot;. His 1991 decision to axe the long-running and widely admired discussion series &quot;After Dark&quot; is detailed here. Grade stated that in the same week that he moved to Channel 4, it had shown a repeat of the 1984 adaptation of &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot;, featuring American actress Amy Irving &quot;blacked up&quot; as an Indian princess. During this period, he was also criticised by the conservative press: &quot;Daily Mail&quot; columnist Paul Johnson dubbed him Britain&#x27;s &quot;pornographer-in-chief&quot;.

In addition to securing talent from the BBC, Grade recognised the improving quality of US television output, making series such as &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;ER&quot; the mainstays of the channel&#x27;s schedule. In 1994, while at Channel 4, he was awarded the BAFTA fellowship in recognition of &quot;an exceptional contribution&quot; to television.

In 1997, Grade became involved in a dispute with Chris Morris regarding the satire &quot;Brass Eye&quot; after repeatedly intervening in the production to order edits to various episodes, and rescheduling some instalments for sensitivity. Morris responded by inserting a frame stating &quot;Grade is a cunt&quot; into the final episode of the first run. In the same year, Grade left Channel 4 to head First Leisure Corporation but departed two years later following a substantial internal re-structuring. His next job was as the chairman of the new Pinewood and Shepperton film studios company.

===Return to the BBC===
Grade was on the board of the poorly received Millennium Dome project, and has served as chairman of Octopus Publishing, the Camelot Group, and Hemscott (a position that he intends to relinquish).

He had ambitions to become chairman of the BBC board of governors in 2001, but was beaten to the post by Gavyn Davies. Following Davies&#x27; resignation in the aftermath of the Hutton Inquiry report, it was announced on 2 April 2004 that Grade had been appointed BBC chairman; his only demand was that he would not have to give up his job as a director of Charlton Athletic F.C. He took up his post on 17 May.

On 19 September 2006, Grade became non-executive chairman of online food delivery company Ocado. He resigned from the role on 23 January 2013, after which he was replaced by Sir Stuart Rose.

===ITV===
On 28 November 2006, Grade and the BBC confirmed that he was to resign from his position within the corporation to replace Sir Peter Burt as chairman, and Charles Allen as chief executive, of one of the companies forming part of its commercial rival, ITV. He became executive chairman of ITV plc on 8 January 2007.

During Grade&#x27;s tenure, ITV struggled with falling advertising revenue and viewing figures. Upon appointment, Grade announced that his first priority would be to work as a senior partner at ITV Network Limited to improve ITV programming, as well as strengthen its digital channels, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and CITV. On 12 September 2007, Grade announced a controversial five-year re-structuring plan for ITV plc-owned regions, selecting entertainment as the top priority. A major overhaul of ITV plc&#x27;s regional structure was also proposed. The plans would result in the consolidation of the ITV regional news programmes in England, with regions now broadcasting a single service per region rather than multiple, specialised, local services (for example, ITV Yorkshire would no longer broadcast in separate northern and southern regions). They would also merge fully ITV Border with ITV Tyne Tees, and ITV West with ITV Westcountry, effectively ending two regions&#x27; tenure as independent players within ITV; the proposals have been criticised by BECTU and the National Union of Journalists. Any such changes would be subject to approval by Ofcom.

In March 2009, Grade initiated libel action against another television executive, Greg Dyke, and &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper over allegations of improper conduct made by Dyke about Grade, relating to his move from the BBC to ITV in 2006. The newspaper subsequently withdrew the allegations and published an apology, admitting that the allegations had no justification.

On 23 April 2009, Grade announced he would be stepping down as chief executive to become non-executive chairman at the conclusion of regulatory reviews into advertising contract rights and digital TV, at some point before the end of 2009.

===Peerage===
Grade revealed his membership of the Conservative Party for the first time in May 2010. On 25 January 2011, he was created a life peer, as Baron Grade of Yarmouth, &quot;of Yarmouth in the County of Isle of Wight&quot;. He was introduced in the House of Lords on 27 January and sat as a Conservative until moving to the crossbenches as part of his role as chairman of Ofcom, conditions of appointment effective from 1 May 2022.

===Ofcom===
On 2 April 2022, it was announced by the government that Grade would take up his four year appointment as chairman of Ofcom effective from 1 May 2022. Following misinformation preceding the 2024 United Kingdom riots, Grade received criticism for Ofcom&#x27;s failure to properly respond to rulebreaking behaviour by outlets such as GB News, &quot;while continuing to enforce [rules] against less partisan media.&quot; Noting Grade&#x27;s public approval of Laurence Fox appearing on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot;, concerns were raised about Ofcom&#x27;s impartiality under his leadership.

==Personal life==
Grade was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1998. That same year, he published his autobiography, &quot;It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time&quot;, and married his third wife, Francesca Leahy; they have a son, Samuel.

He was previously married to Penelope Jane Levinson (1967–1981) (she later married writer and historian Sir Max Hastings), by whom he has two children, and Sarah Lawson (1982–1991), a film producer.

Grade is a fan of Charlton Athletic F.C.

<text>First ScotRail was a train operating company in Scotland owned by FirstGroup. It operated the ScotRail franchise between October 2004 and March 2015.

On 17 October 2004, First ScotRail took over operations from the incumbent franchisee, National Express. First ScotRail operated most commuter and long-distance services within Scotland, and some services to northern England, as well as the Caledonian Sleeper to London. Of FirstGroup&#x27;s four train operating companies, ScotRail was the second largest (in terms of number of passenger journeys 2013–14) after First Great Western at the time of the termination of its franchise.

During April 2008, Transport Scotland granted a three-year franchise extension to First ScotRail. In May 2009, First ScotRail announced a crackdown on fare-dodging due to abuse of the Flexipass ticket system. One month later, it was alleged that ScotRail&#x27;s passenger figures were substantially inflated and that 7.2 million less passenger journeys had been actually made; the matter became politically charged but did not impact the extension decision. In June 2012, the Scottish Government announced that the Caledonian Sleeper services would be split off from the ScotRail franchise. Following its unsuccessful bid to retain the franchise in 2014, First ScotRail transferred operations to Abellio ScotRail on 1 April 2015.

==History==

Between March 1997 and October 2004, the public transport conglomerate National Express operated the ScotRail franchise under the ScotRail brand. During July 2003, the Scottish Executive and the Strategic Rail Authority announced Arriva, FirstGroup and National Express had been shortlisted to bid for the new franchise. In June 2004, the franchise was awarded to FirstGroup; the services formerly operated by ScotRail were transferred to First ScotRail on 17 October 2004.

On 1 January 2006, Transport Scotland was established to carry out the Scottish Executive&#x27;s transport responsibilities including its then newly devolved powers over rail franchising. During April 2008, Transport Scotland granted a three-year franchise extension to First ScotRail, postponing its end-date to November 2014.

In May 2009, First ScotRail announced a crackdown on fare-dodging shortly after discovering that one of its most popular saver tickets could be subject to widespread abuse; 150 travellers were caught misusing Flexipass tickets within a single week alone. First ScotRail&#x27;s approach to dealing with fare-dodgers remained a point of controversy at times.

During June 2009, a report by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport alleged that passenger figures generated by ScotRail had contained 7.2 million more passenger journeys than had been actually made; in response, Holyrood&#x27;s audit committee called in Auditor General Robert Black to review the extent of the miscalculation. First ScotRail stated that the &quot;long-standing&quot; error was being corrected, while Transport Scotland contended that the overestimate did not impact its decision to extend the ScotRail franchise.

During October 2011, First ScotRail and the British railway infrastructure operator Network Rail announced the enactment of a series of new measures to handle service disruption in the event of severe winter conditions. In addition to improved access to travel information at stations and aboard trains, a new design of warmed plastic tunnels along with the first &quot;power shower&quot; system in the UK were rolled out to help de-ice trains, while it was stated that priority would be given to keeping the most highly-trafficked routes operational. At times of severe weather, ScotRail services had been temporarily suspended on grounds of safety; in such situations, wherever possible, active trains were directed to stop in the nearest convenient station and alternative transportation was provided until services could be resumed.

In June 2012, the Scottish Government announced that when the ScotRail franchise would be re-tendered in 2014, the Caledonian Sleeper services would be split off and transferred to a standalone franchise. In May 2014, it was announced that the new Caledonian Sleeper franchise had been awarded to Serco.

In addition to FirstGroup, multiple other transport companies entered bids to operate the ScotRail franchise, including Abellio, Arriva, MTR, and National Express. During early October 2014, it was announced that Abellio&#x27;s bid had been selected and thus First ScotRail would be discontinued from April 2015.

Accordingly, the franchise was transferred to Abellio ScotRail at midnight on 1 April 2015. Several hours beforehand, the Caledonian Sleeper services had been separately transferred to Serco.

==Services==

===Main lines===
Express trains operated between Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Dundee and Aberdeen. The Highland Main Line links Inverness to the south. Some stretches of main line, such as the Highland Main Line, are single track, and express trains must call at intermediate stations to permit trains coming in the opposite direction to pass.

The main lines of Scotland are:
*Ayrshire Coast Line
*Dundee–Aberdeen line
*Edinburgh–Dundee line
*Fife Circle Line
*Glasgow–Edinburgh via Carstairs line
*Glasgow–Edinburgh via Falkirk line
*Glasgow–Dundee line
*Glasgow South Western Line
*Highland Main Line

===Glasgow===

The densest part of the network was the suburban network around Glasgow, with 183 stations, the second-largest suburban rail network in the UK, after London. Much of it is electrified. Glasgow’s main terminal stations are Central and Queen Street stations. ScotRail operated trains in this area under the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) brand. However, the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport no longer has any input into specifying rail services in the Glasgow area. DMUs and EMUs that were liveried in the carmine and cream livery were stripped of the Strathclyde logos. Lines in and around Glasgow were:

*Argyle Line
*Ayrshire Coast Line
*Cathcart Circle Lines
*Croy Line
*Cumbernauld Line
*Inverclyde Line
*Maryhill Line
*Motherwell–Cumbernauld line
*North Clyde Line (extended to Cumbernauld &amp; Edinburgh)
*Paisley Canal line
*Shotts Line
*Glasgow South Western Line
*Whifflet Line (incorporated into the Argyle Line)
The North Clyde Line is now linked to the Edinburgh-Bathgate Line (see Edinburgh, below) with the completion of the Airdrie–Bathgate rail link, creating a new direct link between Glasgow and Edinburgh. There is also a proposal to create a new rail link across the city with the Crossrail Glasgow project.

===Edinburgh===

Edinburgh’s suburban network is less dense than Glasgow’s. Edinburgh’s main station is Waverley. The main railway line through the city centre runs in a cutting immediately below Edinburgh Castle. A secondary station is at in the west of the city. Railway lines running north from Edinburgh to Fife and the Highlands cross the Firth of Forth via the Forth Bridge. Lines in and around Edinburgh were:
*Edinburgh–Bathgate line (incorporated into the North Clyde Line)
*Edinburgh Crossrail
*Edinburgh–Dunblane line
*North Berwick Line
*Shotts Line
*Edinburgh–Dundee line

The Edinburgh rail network is being expanded with the construction of the Waverley Line to the Borders, and the Edinburgh–Bathgate Line has been extended by the Airdrie–Bathgate rail link. A project to open a rail link to Edinburgh Airport was cancelled in September 2007 by the Scottish Government in favour of construction of a station at nearby Gogar which will connect with the Edinburgh tram network to take passengers to the terminal. A proposal to re-open the Edinburgh suburban railway line has been made by campaigning groups.

===Rural lines===
Rural lines include the scenic West Highland Line, Kyle of Lochalsh line and Far North Line. These lines carried more passengers, mostly tourists, during the summer months, but provided a valuable link and social service during the winter months.

Many rural lines are single track. Trains terminating at the coastal towns of Oban and Mallaig connected with the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry services to Skye, Colonsay, Lismore, Islay and the Outer Hebrides and Inner Hebrides.

The rural lines were:
*Aberdeen–Inverness line
*Far North Line
*Kyle of Lochalsh line
*West Highland Line

===InterCity &amp; Sleeper services===

First ScotRail operated some services that ventured south of the border: principally the Caledonian Sleeper to London Euston along the West Coast Main Line, and a three times daily cross-country service between Newcastle upon Tyne and Glasgow Central via Carlisle and Kilmarnock.

==Performance==
Performance figures for National Express’s last quarter as franchise holder, July to September 2004, were:
Performance figures for FirstGroup’s first quarter as franchise holder, October to December 2004, were:
FirstGroup started operating the franchise on 17 October 2004.

The performance figures released by the Office for Rail Regulation (ORR) are as follows:
Note:
* The percentage change figures are not the actual increases in % but the percentage increase in the % value.
* These values are very similar to the sector performance level.

==Rolling stock==

First ScotRail inherited a fleet of Class 150, Class 156, Class 158, Class 170, Class 314, Class 318, Class 320 and Class 334s from National Express, as well as Mark 2 carriages and Mark 3 sleepers for use on the Caledonian Sleeper.

First ScotRail contracted EWS to haul the Caledonian Sleeper services. Class 90s were used south of Edinburgh and Glasgow Central with Class 67s used on the portions to Fort William, Aberdeen and Inverness. A dedicated pool was also created due to the need to fit cast steel brakes. Three Class 90s were repainted in First ScotRail livery with EWS logos.

For a short time in 2005, the Edinburgh - North Berwick Line services were operated by English Welsh &amp; Scottish Class 90s with former Virgin Trains Mark 3 carriages and a Driving Van Trailer. In late 2005, five Class 322s were transferred from One to replace these. Following an refurbishment performed by Hunslet-Barclay of Kilmarnock between 2006 and 2007, all Class 322s had their capacity increased from 252 passengers to 293.

During January 2007, public calls were made for the refurbishments of First ScotRail&#x27;s Class 158 diesel multiple units, particularly in regards to the toilet facilities. One year later, work commenced on the refurbishment of 25 Class 158s, which involved repainting, new seating, extra luggage space, the addition of new customer information systems, and the fitting of the requested toilet retention tanks.

In September 2008, Transport Scotland announced that all First ScotRail trains, including those previously operated on behalf of the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport, would be repainted in a new blue livery with white saltire markings on the carriage ends. This rebranding placed less emphasis on the &quot;First&quot; and was marketed as &quot;ScotRail: Scotland&#x27;s Railway&quot;. The first unit to receive the new livery was 170434, unveiled at Glasgow Queen Street on 22 September 2008.

During December 2008, ScotRail started operated a set of DB Schenker Mark 2 carriages on a peak-hour Fife Circle Line service hauled by a Class 67. A second set was also operated for a while.

In July 2008, Transport Scotland funded the acquisition of 22 three-carriage and 16 four-carriage Class 380 &quot;Desiros&quot; with the first entering service in December 2010. These trains operated Ayrshire and Inverclyde services, adding extra capacity and allowed the cascade of existing stock to the new Glasgow to Edinburgh services via the reopened Airdrie to Bathgate line.

===Fleet at end of franchise===
===Past fleet===
Former train types operated by First ScotRail include:
==Stations==
The majority of Scotland&#x27;s 340 passenger stations were operated by First ScotRail under Network Rail ownership. Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central stations were operated by Network Rail itself; Glasgow Prestwick Airport station was owned and operated by the airport; and was operated by the InterCity East Coast franchise holder (originally GNER, then National Express East Coast, then East Coast, and finally Virgin Trains East Coast). ScotRail operated Lockerbie station although none of its services called there.

==Depots==
First ScotRail&#x27;s fleet was maintained at Edinburgh Haymarket, Glasgow Shields Road, Corkerhill and Inverness depots. During early 2005, the rebuilt Glasgow Eastfield was reopened.

<doc id="171749" wikidata="Q7912388" url="?curid=171749" title="Valleys &amp; Cardiff Local Routes">
<text>Valleys &amp; Cardiff Local Routes (formerly Valley Lines) is the urban and suburban rail network radiating from Cardiff, Wales. It includes lines within the city itself, the Vale of Glamorgan and the South Wales Valleys.

The services are currently operated by Transport for Wales Rail. In total, it serves 81 stations in six unitary authority areas: 20 in the city of Cardiff, 11 in the Vale of Glamorgan, 25 in Rhondda Cynon Taf, 16 in Caerphilly, 8 in Bridgend and 5 in Merthyr Tydfil.

Services on these routes are currently provided by a transitional fleet of Class 150 DMUs, Class 231 Diesel–electric multiple units and Class 756 tri-mode multiple units. They are typically end-to-end, in that they run from one branch terminus, through Cardiff Queen Street station, to another branch terminus, e.g. from Pontypridd to Barry Island.

The major hubs of the network are and . Other hubs are , and .

==History==

A stretch of the Vale of Glamorgan Line, on which passenger services were closed under the Beeching Axe, re-opened for passenger service, with services from to , via , Rhoose Cardiff Intl. Airport and Llantwit Major. These services were originally advertised to start in April 2005, but commenced on 12 June 2005. Previously services only went as far as Barry.

On 28 March 2020, ownership of the lines between Cardiff and Treherbert, Aberdare, Merthyr Tydfil, Coryton, Rhymney and Cwmbargoed (the &quot;Core Valley Lines&quot;) was transferred from Network Rail to Transport for Wales, who leased them to operator AKIL.

==Electrification==

On 16 July 2012 the UK Government announced plans to extend the electrification of the network at a cost of £350 million. This was at the same time of the announcement of electrification of the South Wales Main Line from Cardiff to Swansea. This would also see investment in new trains and continued improvements to stations.

The investment will require new trains and should result in reduced journey times and cheaper maintenance of the network. Work was expected to start between 2014 and 2019, but has since been pushed back to between 2019 and 2024.

==Lines==

The colours used below are from the official network map (see External links). Stations in bold are major interchanges for the network.

===Routes===
Generally trains run from one line to another, joining at Cardiff Central eliminating the need for changing trains there. However they may not run for the whole length of the line.

Before the June 2024 train timetable changes, Services had run between:
*Bridgend/Barry Island and Merthyr Tydfil/Aberdare – incorporating the Vale of Glamorgan and Merthyr/Aberdare Lines
*Penarth and Rhymney/Bargoed – incorporating the Vale of Glamorgan and Rhymney Lines
*Radyr and Coryton – incorporating the City and Coryton Lines
*Cardiff Central and Treherbert – incorporating the Rhondda Line only
*Cardiff Queen Street and Cardiff Bay – incorporating the Butetown Branch Line only

After the June 2024 train timetable changes, Services now run between:
*Bridgend/Barry Island and Rhymney/Bargoed – incorporating the Vale of Glamorgan and Rhymney Lines
*Penarth and Coryton/Caerphilly – incorporating the Vale of Glamorgan and Rhymney/Coryton Lines
*Cardiff Central and Merthyr Tydfil/Aberdare – incorporating the City and Merthyr/Aberdare Lines (trains from Aberdare to Cardiff now travel after Radyr via the City Line, and after Cardiff Central then go on to Cardiff Queen St and proceed to Merthyr Tydfil; trains from Merthyr Tydfil continue on to Aberdare after Cardiff Central)
*Cardiff Central and Treherbert – incorporating the Rhondda Line only
*Cardiff Queen Street/Pontypridd and Cardiff Bay – incorporating the Butetown Branch Line only

==Surrounding lines==
The following lines also serve Cardiff and the South Wales Valleys but are not considered part of the network by Transport for Wales and use more &quot;mainline&quot; rolling stock (currently Class 197 units).

<text>Westminster School is a public school in Westminster, London, England, in the precincts of Westminster Abbey. It descends from a charity school founded by Westminster Benedictines before the Norman Conquest, as documented by the Croyland Chronicle and a charter of King Offa. Continuous existence is clear from the early 14th century. Westminster was one of nine schools examined by the 1861 Clarendon Commission and reformed by the Public Schools Act 1868. The school motto, &quot;Dat Deus Incrementum&quot;, quotes 1 Corinthians 3:6: &quot;I planted the seed... but God made it grow.&quot; The school owns playing fields and tennis courts in the centre of the 13-acre Vincent Square, along which Westminster Under School is also situated.

Its academic results place it among the top schools nationally; about half its students go to Oxbridge, giving it the highest national Oxbridge acceptance rate.
In the 2023 A-levels, the school saw 82.3% of its candidates score A* or A. The school is included in The Schools Index of the world&#x27;s 150 best private schools and among top 30 senior schools in the UK. Among its graduates are three Nobel laureates: Edgar Adrian (Nobel Prize for Physiology in 1932), Sir Andrew Huxley (likewise in 1963) and Sir Richard Stone (Nobel Prize in Economics in 1984). During the mid-17th century, the liberal philosopher of the Enlightenment, John Locke, attended the school, and seven UK prime ministers also then attended, all belonging to the Whig or Liberal factions of British politics: Henry Pelham and his brother Thomas Pelham-Holmes, Charles Watson-Wentworth, James Waldegrave, Augustus Fitzroy, William Cavendish-Bentinck, and John Russell.

Boys join the Under School at seven and the Senior School at 13 if they pass their examinations. Girls join the Sixth Form at 16. About a quarter of the 750 pupils board. Weekly boarders may go home after Saturday morning school.

==History==
The earliest records of a school at Westminster date back to the 1340s and are held in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Muniment Room. Parts of the buildings now used by the school date back to the tenth-century Anglo-Saxon abbey at Westminster.

In 1540, Henry VIII ordered the dissolution of the monasteries in England, including that of the powerful Abbots of Westminster, but personally ensured the School&#x27;s survival by his royal charter. The Royal College of St. Peter carried on with forty &quot;King&#x27;s Scholars&quot; financed from the royal purse. By this point Westminster School had certainly become a public school (i.e. a school available to members of the paying public, rather than the private tuition arranged by the nobility). During Mary I&#x27;s reign the Abbey was reinstated as a Roman Catholic monastery, but the school continued.

Elizabeth I refounded the school in 1560, with new statutes to select 40 King&#x27;s Scholars from boys who had attended the school for a year. Queen Elizabeth frequently visited her scholars, although she never signed the statutes or endowed her scholarships; 1560 is now generally taken as the date that the school was &quot;founded&quot;.

Elizabeth I appointed William Camden as Head Master, and he is the only layman known to have held the position until 1937. It was Richard Busby, himself an Old Westminster, who established the reputation of the school for several hundred years, as much by his classical learning as for his ruthless discipline by the birch, immortalised in Pope&#x27;s &quot;Dunciad&quot;. Busby prayed publicly up School for the safety of the Crown, on the very day of Charles I&#x27;s execution, and then locked the boys inside to prevent their going to watch the spectacle a few hundred yards away. Regardless of politics, he thrashed Royalist and Puritan boys alike without fear or favour. Busby also took part in Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s funeral procession in 1658, when a Westminster schoolboy, Robert Uvedale, succeeded in snatching the &quot;Majesty Scutcheon&quot; (white satin banner) draped on the coffin, which is now held in the library (it was given to the school by his family three hundred years later). Busby remained in office throughout the Civil War and the Commonwealth, when the school was governed by Parliamentary Commissioners, and well into the Restoration.

In 1679, a group of scholars killed a bailiff, ostensibly in defence of Abbey&#x27;s traditional right of sanctuary after the man had arrested a person connected to the college. Busby obtained a royal pardon for his scholars from Charles II and added the cost to the school bills.

Until the 19th century, the curriculum was predominantly made up of Latin and Greek, and all taught up School. Westminster boys were uncontrolled outside school hours and notoriously unruly about town, but the proximity of the school to the Palace of Westminster meant that politicians were well aware of boys&#x27; exploits. After the Public Schools Act 1868, in response to the Clarendon Commission on the financial and other malpractices at nine pre-eminent public schools, the school began to approach its modern form. It was legally separated from the Abbey, although the organisations remain close. The Dean of Westminster was &quot;ex officio&quot; the Chair of the Governing Body until 2020 and remains a Governor. There followed a scandalous public and parliamentary dispute lasting a further 25 years, to settle the transfer of the properties from the Canons of the Abbey to the school. School statutes have been made by Order in Council of Queen Elizabeth II. The Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, and the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, were also &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the school&#x27;s Governing Body until 2020.

Unusually among public schools, Westminster did not adopt most of the broader changes associated with the Victorian ethos of Thomas Arnold, such as the emphasis on team over individual spirit, and the school retained much of its distinctive character. Despite many pressures, including evacuation and the destruction of the school roof during the Blitz, the school refused to move out of the city, unlike other schools such as Charterhouse and St. Paul&#x27;s, and remains in its central London location.

Westminster Under School was formed in 1943 in the evacuated school buildings in Westminster, as a distinct preparatory school for day pupils between the ages of eight to 13 (now seven to 13). Only the separation is new: for example, in the 18th century, Edward Gibbon attended Westminster from the age of 11 and Jeremy Bentham from the age of eight. The Under School has since moved to Vincent Square, overlooking the school&#x27;s playing fields. Its current Master is Kate Jefferson.

In 1967, the first female pupil was admitted to the school. Girls became full members in 1973. In 1981, a single-sex boarding house, Purcell&#x27;s, was created for girls. In 1997 the school expanded further with the creation of a new day house, Milne&#x27;s, at 5a, Dean&#x27;s Yard.

In 2005 the school was one of 50 leading independent schools found guilty of running a cartel, exposed by &quot;The Times&quot;, which had allowed them to collaborate in uncompetitive fees for thousands of customers. Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, &quot;They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.&quot;. However, each school agreed to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and ex-gratia payments totalling £3 million into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared.

In 2007, the school responded to an invitation to become the sponsor of Pimlico School, which was due to be rebuilt as an academy, but decided not to do so after Westminster City Council developed its plans. In 2013 the school collaborated with the Harris Federation to set up a selective, mixed sixth-form academy, with entrance priority being given to those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Harris Westminster Sixth Form opened nearby in 2014; pupils of the academy share some lessons and facilities of the school.

In 2010 the school and the abbey celebrated the 450th anniversary of the granting of their royal charter and Elizabeth I&#x27;s refoundation of the school in 1560. Queen Elizabeth II with the Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a controversial statue in Little Dean&#x27;s Yard of the Queen&#x27;s namesake Elizabeth I, the nominal foundress of the School, by Old Westminster sculptor Matthew Spender. The head of the statue came off in May 2016 after a Sixth Former (a pupil in Year 12) tried to climb onto the statue. The head has since been reattached.

In May 2013, the school was criticized for staging an auction involving the selling of internships to fund bursaries, resulting in adverse press coverage.

In December 2017, the school announced plans to open six schools in China, working with the Hong Kong educational group HKMETG; the first opened in Chengdu in 2020. Revenue generated by the deal will be used to support bursary funds at the existing school, and follows similar moves by Harrow School, Malvern School, Wellington College and Dulwich College. The school was criticized in the media and by its pupils for its decision to teach the Chinese national curriculum as opposed to an international curriculum normally taught by international schools. Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at SOAS London, was quoted in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as saying, &quot;I think they have no idea what they&#x27;re dealing with... If you set up a school in China, they will have a party secretary superintending the whole school and the party secretary will be responsible for political education.&quot; The school responded that it would exercise &quot;soft power&quot; over the teaching and would also teach an international curriculum for students aged 16–18. The issue was re-opened when &quot;The Times&quot; published an article quoting Professor Edward Vickers of Kyushu University, who accused the school (and King&#x27;s College School, with similar plans) of &quot;helping Chinese teach propaganda&quot;. These plans were cancelled in November 2021 in response to &quot;recent changes in Chinese education policy&quot;.

The school stands mainly in the precincts of the medieval monastery of Westminster Abbey, its main buildings surrounding its private square Little Dean&#x27;s Yard (known as Yard), off Dean&#x27;s Yard, where Church House, the headquarters of the Church of England, is situated, along with some of the houses, the common room, the humanities building Weston&#x27;s, and College Hall.
Just outside the abbey precincts in Great College Street is Sutcliff&#x27;s (named after the tuck shop on the site of the building in the 19th century), where Geography, Art, Theology, Philosophy and Classics (Latin and Ancient Greek) are taught. The Robert Hooke Science Centre is further away, just off Smith Square. As part of an expansion programme funded by donations and a legacy from A. A. Milne, the school has acquired the nearby Millicent Fawcett Hall for Drama and Theatre Studies lessons and performances; the Manoukian Centre for Music Lessons (timetabled and private) and recitals; and the Weston Building at 3 Dean&#x27;s Yard. It often uses St John&#x27;s, Smith Square as a venue for major musical concerts.
College Garden, to the East of Little Dean&#x27;s Yard, is believed to be the oldest garden in England, under continuous cultivation for about a millennium. Just beyond rises the Victoria Tower of the Houses of Parliament; the King&#x27;s Scholars have special rights of access to the House of Commons. To the North, the Dark Cloister leads straight to the Abbey, which serves as the School Chapel.

The playing fields are half a mile away at Vincent Square, which Dean Vincent created for the school by hiring a horse and plough to carve out of the open Tothill Fields. The boathouse is now some way from the school at Putney, where it is also used for the Oxford and Cambridge boat race; but the school&#x27;s First Eight still returns annually to exercise its traditional right to land at Black Rod Steps of the Palace of Westminster.

In 2011, the school agreed to buy a 999-year lease of Lawrence Hall, London from The Royal Horticultural Society. This listed Art-Deco building adjacent to the school&#x27;s playing fields at Vincent Square has been converted into a Sports Centre. It provides for climbing, martial arts, fencing, rowing, table tennis, badminton, netball, indoor football and indoor cricket. In 2012 the school took possession of St Edward&#x27;s House, which was the last Anglican monastery in London. The building, on the corner of Great College Street and Tufton Street, now houses Purcell&#x27;s, a Boarding House for girls and a Day House for boys, as well as a small Chapel and Refectory. Westminster Under School has also been enlarged by a building in Douglas Street, which provides an Art Studio, IT Suite and Dining Hall.

Westminster was the 13th most expensive HMC day school and tenth most expensive HMC boarding school in the UK in 2014/2015 It achieved the highest percentage of students accepted by Oxbridge colleges over the period 2002–2006, and was ranked as best boys&#x27; school in the country in terms of GCSE results in 2017. In 2019, 84% of pupils scored A*-A for their A-Levels examination, while 80% scored A*-A for their GCSEs.

The school plans to introduce girls into Year 9 in 2028. It will be co-educational in all year groups by 2030.

==Architecture==
Westminster School, in the middle of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Westminster Abbey, St. Margaret&#x27;s, and the Palace of Westminster, has several buildings notable for qualities, age and history.
* The Great Cloisters, St Faith&#x27;s Chapel, The Chapter House, The Parlour, 1 and 2 The Cloisters, and the dormitory with the Chapel of St Dunstan are listed Grade I as a group on the National Heritage List for England. 
* The dormitory at Little Dean&#x27;s Yard and the staircase and doorway in Little Dean&#x27;s Yard to the Busby Library are separately listed Grade I.
* College Hall, the 14th-century abbot&#x27;s state dining hall, is one of the oldest and finest examples of a medieval refectory and still in daily use for that purpose in term-time; outside of term it reverts to the dean as the abbot&#x27;s successor. Queen Elizabeth Woodville took sanctuary here in 1483 with five daughters and her son Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, but failed to save him from his fate as one of the Princes in the Tower. In the 1560s, Elizabeth I several times came to see her scholars act their Latin plays on a stage in front of the attractive Elizabethan gallery, which may have been first erected especially for the purpose.
* College, now shared between the three Houses of College, Dryden&#x27;s and Wren&#x27;s, is a dressed stone building overlooking College Garden, the former monastery&#x27;s Infirmary garden, which is still the property of the Collegiate Church of Westminster Abbey. College dates from 1729 and was designed by the Earl of Burlington, based on earlier designs by Sir Christopher Wren (himself an Old Westminster).
* School, originally built in the 1090s as the monks&#x27; dormitory, is the school&#x27;s main hall, used for Latin Prayers (a weekly assembly with prayers in the Westminster dialect of Latin), exams, and large concerts, plays and the like. From 1599 it was used to teach all the pupils, the Upper and Lower Schools being separated by a curtain hung from a 16th-century pig iron bar, which remains the largest piece of pig iron in the world. The panelling &quot;up School&quot; is painted with the coats of arms of many former pupils. The original shell-shaped apse at the north end of the school gave its name to the &#x27;Shell&#x27; forms taught there and the corresponding classes at many other public schools. The current shell displays a Latin epigram on the rebuilding of School, with the acrostic &quot;Semper Eadem&quot;, Elizabeth I&#x27;s motto. The classroom door to the right of the Shell was recovered from the notorious Star Chamber at its demolition, but was destroyed during the Blitz. The building lies directly on top of the Westminster Abbey museum in the Norman Undercroft, and ends at the start of the Pyx Chamber. Both School and College had their roofs destroyed by incendiary bombs in the Blitz of 1941. They were re-opened by George VI in 1950.
* The school gateway was also designed by the Earl of Burlington. It is engraved with the names of many pupils, who used to hire a stonemason for the purpose. 

* Ashburnham House houses the library and the Mathematics Department, and until 2005 accommodated the Economics, English and History of Art departments as well. Ashburnham House may have been built by Inigo Jones or his pupil John Webb around the time of the Restoration, as a London seat for the family, who became the Earls of Ashburnham. It incorporates remains of the mediaeval Prior&#x27;s House. Its garden is the site of the monks&#x27; refectory and some of the earliest sittings of the House of Commons. In 1731 when Ashburnham housed the King&#x27;s and Cottonian libraries, which form the basis of the British Library, there was a disastrous fire, and many of the books and manuscripts still show the marks. After the Public Schools Act 1868 there was a scandalous parliamentary and legal battle between the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey and the School until the School eventually obtained Ashburnham House under the Act for £4,000. The dispute was reported in &quot;The Times&quot; and it was suggested by Thomas Wise, Secretary of The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings that the property was &quot;in danger of being pulled down or of being virtually destroyed by being converted into a boarding-house in connexion with Westminster School&quot;, adding that the &quot;house is admirably suited for a residence for the Dean or one of the Canons, and is totally unfitted for a school or a boarding house.&quot; The school responded: &quot;The Chapter themselves have in past years greatly altered and disfigured Ashburnham-house. It had originally two wings; one was destroyed and never restored. About 1848 the roof was taken off, a story added, and a dome in the ceiling of the drawing-room demolished, the external elevation being ruined. The house now has no beauty externally, and hardly any features of interest internally, except the staircase, which in any case would be preserved&quot;. On 28 November William Morris also became involved in the campaign, writing a letter to the editor of &quot;The Daily News&quot;. In the event, the school demolished the adjacent Turle&#x27;s House and renovated sections of the east wing, but left the staircase and drawing room untouched. During the Second World War, the library was used for military purposes and as an American soldiers&#x27; club, the Churchill Club.

==Customs==
===The Greaze===

The Greaze has been held &quot;up School&quot; (in the School Hall) on Shrove Tuesday since at least 1753. The head cook ceremoniously tosses a horsehair-reinforced pancake over a high bar, which was used from the 16th century to curtain off the Under School from the Great School. Members of the school fight for the pancake for one minute, watched over by the Dean of Westminster, the Head Master, and the upper year groups of the school and distinguished or even occasionally royal visitors. The pupil who gets the largest weight is awarded a gold sovereign (promptly redeemed for use next year), and the Dean begs for a half-holiday for the whole school. Weighing scales are on hand in the event of a dispute. A cook who failed to get the pancake over the bar after three attempts would formerly have been &quot;booked&quot; or pelted with Latin primers, but that tradition has long lapsed.
===Coronation===
The privilege of being the first commoners to acclaim each new sovereign at their coronation in Westminster Abbey is reserved for the King&#x27;s (or Queen&#x27;s) Scholars. Their shouts of &quot;Vivat Rex/Regina&quot; (&quot;Long live the king/queen!&quot;) are incorporated into the coronation anthem &quot;I was glad&quot;. The tradition dates back to the coronation of King James II.

===Commem===
The School commemorates its benefactors every year with a service in Westminster Abbey in Latin in which the Captain of the King&#x27;s Scholars lays a wreath of pink roses on the tomb of Elizabeth I: the service alternates between Little Commem, held in Henry VII&#x27;s Chapel and involving just the King&#x27;s Scholars, and the Big Commem, to which the whole school community is invited.
===House of Commons gallery===
The King&#x27;s Scholars have privileged access to the House of Commons gallery, said to be a compromise recorded in the Standing Orders of the House in the 19th century, to stop the boys from climbing into the Palace over the roofs.
===Latin prayers===
Despite the formal separation from the abbey, the school remains Anglican, with services in the abbey attended by the entire school at least twice a week, and many other voluntary-attendance services of worship. The school was expressly exempted by the Act of Uniformity to allow it to continue saying Latin prayers despite the Reformation. Every Wednesday there is an assembly Up School known as Latin Prayers, which opens with the Head Master leading all members of the school in chanting prayers in Latin, followed by notices in English. The school&#x27;s unique pronunciation of formal Latin is known as &quot;Westminster Latin&quot;, and descends from medieval English scholastic pronunciation: Queen Elizabeth I, who spoke fluent Latin, commanded that Latin was not to be said &quot;in the monkish fashion&quot;, a significant warning upon loyalties between Church and State. 

===Latin plays===
Since the monastic Christmas revels of medieval times, Latin plays have been presented by Scholars, with a prologue and witty epilogue on contemporary events. Annual plays, &quot;either tragedy or comedy&quot;, were required by the school statutes in 1560, and some early plays were acted in College Hall before Elizabeth I and her whole Council. However, in a more prudish age, Queen Victoria did not accompany Prince Albert and the Prince of Wales to the play, and recorded in her diary that it was &quot;very Improper&quot;. Today, the play is put on less frequently, any members of the school may take part, and the Master of the King&#x27;s Scholars gives the Latin prologue. The 1938 play caused a diplomatic incident, with the German ambassador withdrawing after being offended by the words &quot;Magna Germania&quot; figuring in extenso on a map of Europe displayed.

===Language===
There is a Westminster jargon little known to the general public:
*Years 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 are called Fifth Form, Lower Shell, Upper Shell, Sixth Form and Remove, respectively.
*&#x27;Green&#x27; is Dean&#x27;s Yard.
*&#x27;Yard&#x27; is Little Dean&#x27;s Yard.
*&#x27;School&#x27; is the main school hall, where Latin Prayers, exams and major plays and talks take place.
*&#x27;Sanctuary&#x27; is the area outside the Great West Door of the Abbey off Broad Sanctuary.
*&#x27;Fields&#x27; is Vincent Square.
*The preposition &quot;up&quot; is used to mean &quot;at&quot; or &quot;towards&quot; (hence up School). At my house (boarding/day) and home can be differentiated thus, up House means at School and at my house means at home.
*&#x27;Station&#x27; is sport.
*&#x27;Water&#x27; is rowing.

==Station==

The school has three Eton Fives courts behind Ashburnham House. The school frequently fields pupils as national entries in international competitions in rowing, or &quot;water&quot;, and fencing.

Westminster School Boat Club is the oldest rowing club in the world, located on the River Thames. The Oxford University Boat Club uses Westminster&#x27;s boathouse at Putney as its HQ for the annual Oxford and Cambridge boat race on the Thames. The boathouse was remodelled in 1997 and won a Wandsworth design award in 1999. The school&#x27;s colour is pink; Westminster rowers raced Eton College for the right to wear the colour. The premier Leander Club at Henley, founded in London by a number of Old Westminster rowers, later adopted it, although they call the colour cerise. The only problems arise when racing against Abingdon School, whose team also wears pink.
Since 1810, when the Head Master, William Vincent, fenced off and ordered the ploughing of the waste marshlands known as Tothill Fields for use by the school, which were being threatened by London&#x27;s urban sprawl, the school&#x27;s main sports ground has been nearby at Vincent Square, with football and cricket on the main area and tennis and netball on the courts; it also hosts a playground for Westminster Under School. At 13 acres, it is the largest private, open green space in Central London, despite this, it is not large enough for all pupils doing these sports to use simultaneously the three football pitches and typically one smaller practice pitch becomes one main cricket square and several smaller practice squares for the cricket season. So the school hires and owns other sporting facilities near the school. These include the oldest boating club in the world, an astroturf ground in Battersea, and the Queen Mother Sports Centre, home to a variety of sports. &quot;Green&quot; (Dean&#x27;s Yard) is also used, and the three Eton Fives courts in Ashburnham Garden, the garden behind Ashburnham House.

Westminster played in the first school cricket match against Charterhouse School in 1794 and from 1796 played cricket against Eton.

Westminster has a historic joint claim to a major role in developing Association Football. During the 1840s at both Westminster and Charterhouse, pupils&#x27; surroundings meant they were confined to playing their football in the cloisters, making the rough and tumble of the handling game that was developing at other schools such as Rugby impossible, and necessitating a new code of rules. On 24 November 1858, Westminster played Dingley Dell at Vincent Square in the earliest known football fixture in the London area (Dingley Dell was the most active non-school team in the London area in the five years before the Football Association was established in 1863). During the formulation of the rules of Association Football in the 1860s, representatives of Westminster School and Charterhouse also pushed for a passing game, in particular rules that allowed forward passing (&quot;passing on&quot;). Other schools (in particular Eton College, Harrow, and Shrewsbury School) favoured a dribbling game with a tight off-side rule. By 1867 the Football Association had chosen in favour of the Westminster and Charterhouse game and adopted an off-side rule that permitted forward passing. The modern forward-passing game was a direct consequence of Westminster and Charterhouse football.

==Houses==
The school is split into 11 houses, some of which are day houses (only admitting day pupils, who go home after school), the others being boarding houses with a mix of boarders and day pupils. College is the exception to this — all King&#x27;s Scholars must board. Each house has a Housemaster, a teacher who is responsible for the house, the pupils in it and their welfare, and a &quot;Head of House&quot;, a pupil in the Remove, nominated by the Housemaster. The role of the Head of House largely consists of assisting the Housemaster in organising activities such as house competitions, for which the Head of House might draw up teams. Further to these positions, each day house has an Assistant Housemaster, and each boarding house has a Resident Tutor. The houses are named after people connected to the house or school in various ways – mainly prominent Old Westminsters, but also former Head Masters and Housemasters. Grant&#x27;s is the oldest house for pupils other than scholars, not only of Westminster but of any public school.

Houses are a focus for pastoral care and social and sporting activities, as well as accommodation for boarders. All day houses are mixed-sex, and all houses admit girls; RR is the only boarding house not to admit girls as boarders (up until 2020) and PP does not admit boys as boarders.

All King&#x27;s Scholars, both boys and girls, are required to board in College (unless under exceptional circumstances). Wren&#x27;s was formerly known as &quot;Homeboarders&quot; and Dryden&#x27;s as &quot;Dale&#x27;s&quot;. Before it was rebuilt, Rigaud&#x27;s was known as &quot;Clapham&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Best&#x27;s&quot;.

==Staff==

===Other notable staff===

==Controversies==

=== Fee fixing ===
Between 2001 and 2004, the school was one of fifty independent schools involved in the independent school fee fixing scandal in the United Kingdom. It was subsequently found guilty of operating a fee-fixing cartel by the Office of Fair Trading. The commission argued that until 2000, the practice had been legal and that the commission had not been aware of the change in the law.

=== Rape culture and racism ===
Two independent reviews were commissioned after national campaigns from Everyone&#x27;s Invited and Black Lives Matter unearthed evidence of rape culture and racism at Westminster School. In March 2022, the school issued a &quot;sincere and unreserved&quot; apology for harm caused by racism, sexual harassment and other harmful sexual behaviour.

==== Review into harmful sexual behaviours ====
In March 2021, alumni compiled a &quot;dossier of rape culture&quot; at the school. A 21-page document included 76 entries on &quot;everyday life&quot; for female pupils and included claims of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. Allegations were levelled at both students and teachers.

In March 2022, a review into harmful sexual behaviour at the school was headed by Fiona Scolding QC. The review considered 44 Westminster-related posts submitted to Everyone&#x27;s Invited alongside other evidence. The review found that 25% of pupils and 65% of girls surveyed said they experienced physical or verbal harmful sexual behaviours, sexual discrimination, and unwanted sharing of images. There was also &quot;a strong sense from pupil interviewees of a social hierarchy within the school where some male pupils&#x27; status was dictated by familial wealth, academic success and charisma.&quot; Submissions to Everyone&#x27;s Invited also recalled the &quot;Westminster Tree&quot; website that mapped sexual contact between students.

A total of 44 recommendations included an overhaul of the school&#x27;s relationships and sex education curriculum, &quot;active bystander&quot; training, and a greater emphasis on building healthy relationships. The report also recommended training for housemasters, matrons, and tutors on managing pastoral issues including mental health. Other recommendations include a behavioural code of conduct for students informed by the student body.

==== Racism and race review ====
In 2020, more than 250 alumni signed a letter lobbying the school to combat the &quot;toxic culture of racism within the student body.&quot; Signatories complained that Westminster did not include any black authors in their curriculum and overlooked Britain&#x27;s role in the slave trade.

In March 2022, Challenge Consultancy published a Race Review of Westminster School that found &quot;continued denial of the racism and the invisibility of the issue&quot;. Challenge Consultancy was commissioned by Westminster School to facilitate understanding of how staff and pupils perceive the culture around race, ethnicity and cultural diversity and consider how it can better engage with these issues in the future. The review&#x27;s authors were led by Femi Otitoju who found evidence that international pupils including British Asian, British Black, Chinese and Jewish pupils &quot;recounted a lack of sensitivity and delays in responding to emotions they experienced when calling out unacceptable behaviour&quot;. 25 recommendations included the recruitment of &quot;diverse teaching staff,&quot; a publicised racial harassment policy, and an increased offer of counselling for victims.

<text>Chongqing is a direct-administered municipality in Southwestern China. Chongqing is one of the four direct-administered municipalities under the Central People&#x27;s Government, along with Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin. It is the only directly administrated municipality located deep inland. The municipality covers a large geographical area roughly the size of Austria, which includes several disjunct urban areas in addition to Chongqing proper. Due to its classification, the municipality of Chongqing is the largest city proper in the world by population, though Chongqing is not the most populous urban area.

The municipality of Chongqing is the only Chinese municipality with a resident population of over 30 million; however, this number includes its large rural population. In 2020, Chongqing surpassed Shanghai as China&#x27;s largest municipality by urban population; , it has an urban population of 22.8 million. The municipality contains 26 districts, 8 counties, and 4 autonomous counties. The city served as the wartime capital for the Republic of China (ROC) during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). On 14 March 1997, the current municipality was separated from the surrounding province of Sichuan, with the goal of furthering development in the central and western parts of the country. University of Washington professor Kam Wing Chan argued that Chongqing&#x27;s status is more akin to that of a province rather than a city.

As one of China&#x27;s National Central Cities, Chongqing serves as a center for finance in the Sichuan Basin and the upstream Yangtze, as well as for manufacturing and transportation. It is a connection in the Yangtze River Economic Belt and a base for the country&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative. Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport is the second-busiest airport in China, and is one of the top 50 busiest airports in the world. The city&#x27;s monorail system is the world&#x27;s longest and busiest, as well as having the greatest number of stations, with 70. Chongqing is ranked as a Beta (global second-tier) city. It is the headquarters of the Changan Automobile, one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; car manufacturers of China. , the city hosts 12 foreign representations, the fifth-most in China behind Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. It is one of the top 40 cities globally by scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index; the municipality is home to several notable universities, including Chongqing University, Southwest University, and Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Chongqing&#x27;s location is historically associated with the State of Ba. Its capital was first called Jiangzhou ().

===Imperial era===
Jiangzhou subsequently remained under Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s rule during the Qin dynasty, the successor of the Qin State, as well as the rule of Han dynasty emperors.
Jiangzhou was subsequently renamed during the Northern and Southern dynasties to Chu Prefecture (), then again in 581 AD (Sui dynasty) to Yu Prefecture (), and later in 1102 during Northern Song to Gong Prefecture (). The name Yu however survives to this day as an abbreviation for Chongqing, as well as for the city&#x27;s historic center, where the old town once stood; its name is Yuzhong (, Central Yu). It received its current name in 1189, after Prince Zhao Dun of the Southern Song dynasty described his crowning as king and then Emperor Guangzong as a &quot;double celebration&quot; (, or &quot;chóngqìng&quot; in short). To mark the occasion of his enthronement, Yu Prefecture was therefore converted to Chongqing Fu.

In 1362 (during the Yuan dynasty), Ming Yuzhen, a peasant rebel leader, established the Daxia Kingdom () at Chongqing for a short time. In 1621 (during the Ming dynasty), another short-lived kingdom of Daliang () was established by She Chongming () with Chongqing as its capital. In 1644, after the fall of the Ming dynasty to a rebel army, Chongqing, together with the rest of Sichuan, was captured by Zhang Xianzhong, who was said to have massacred a large number of people in Sichuan and depopulated the province, in part by causing many people to flee to safety elsewhere. The Manchus later conquered the province, and during the Qing dynasty, immigration to Chongqing and Sichuan took place with the support of the Qing emperor.

In 1890, the British Consulate General was opened in Chongqing. The following year, the city became the first inland commerce port open to foreigners, with the proviso that foreign ships should not be at liberty to trade there until Chinese-owned steamers had succeeded in ascending the Yangtze river. This restriction was abolished by the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which declared the city open on the same terms as other ports, although it was not until 1907 that a steamship made the journey without the help of manual haulers. From 1896 to 1904, the American, German, French, and Japanese consulates were opened in Chongqing.

===Provisional wartime capital of the Republic of China===
During and after the Second Sino-Japanese War, from November 1937 to May 1946, it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s provisional capital. After the General and remaining army had lived there for a time following their retreat in 1938 from the previous capital of Wuhan, it was formally declared the second capital city () on 6 September 1940. After Britain, the United States, and other Allies entered the war in Asia in December 1941, one of the Allies&#x27; deputy commanders of operations in Southeast Asia (Southeast Asia Command SEAC), Joseph Stilwell, was based in the city.

The city was also visited by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of SEAC which was itself headquartered in Sri Lanka. Chiang Kai Shek as Supreme Commander in China worked closely with Stilwell. From 1938 to 1943, the city suffered from continuous massive bombing campaigns of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army Air Forces; battles of which were fought entirely by the Chinese Air Force squadrons and anti-aircraft artillery units. Many lives were saved by the air-raid shelters which took advantage of the mountainous terrain. Chongqing was acclaimed to be the &quot;City of Heroes&quot; due to the indomitable spirits of its people as well as their contributions and sacrifices during the war. Many factories and universities were relocated from eastern China and ultimately to Chongqing during years of setbacks in the war, transforming this city from inland port to a heavily industrialized city.

===Chinese Civil War===
After World War II ended, Chongqing became one of the last refuges of the Nationalist Kuomintang government on the Chinese mainland during the Chinese Civil War. Following the Yangtze River Crossing campaign, the KMT capital of Nanjing was occupied by the Communists in 23 April. The KMT decamped first to Guangzhou, then Chongqing. Chongqing served as the KMT capital until late November 1949, when the Nationalist KMT government withdrew from the city by air.

===Municipality status===

On 14 March 1997, the Eighth National People&#x27;s Congress decided to merge the sub-provincial city with adjacent Fuling, Wanxian, and Qianjiang prefectures that it had governed on behalf of the province since September 1996, and grant it independence from Sichuan. The resulting single entity became Chongqing Municipality, containing 30,020,000 people in forty-three former counties without intermediate political levels. The municipality became the spearhead of China&#x27;s effort to develop its western regions and to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Dam project. Its first official ceremony took place on 18 June 1997.

On 8 February 2010, Chongqing became one of the nine National Central Cities, along with Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan, Xi&#x27;an, and Zhengzhou. According to Zhou Liqun, a consultant for National Development and Reform Commission of China, Chongqing&#x27;s status as a National Central City would encourage the development of Western China. Chongqing, which is located in central-western China, would complement the other National Central Cities, all of which are located along China&#x27;s eastern coastline. The same year on 18 June, the Liangjiang New Area was established in Chongqing, which was the third state-level new area at the time of its establishment.

==Geography==
===Physical geography and topography===

Chongqing is located in the subtropics, situated in the transitional area between the Sichuan Basin and the plain on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze. Its climate features frequent monsoon conditions, often raining at night in late spring and early summer. The city&#x27;s &quot;night rain in the Ba Mountains&quot;, features in poems throughout Chinese history, including &quot;Written on a Rainy Night—A Letter to the North&quot; by Li Shangyin. Its territory is from east to west at its longest, and from north to south at its widest. It borders Hubei and Hunan to the east, Sichuan and Shaanxi to the north, and Guizhou to the south.
Chongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Gorge in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The area slopes downward from north to south towards the Yangtze valley, and features a large massif of mountains and hills, with steep sloping areas at different heights. Karst landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, limestone caves and valleys can be found in many places. The &quot;Longshuixia Gap&quot; (), with its Three Natural Bridges, has made the region a popular tourist attraction. The Yangtze River runs through the whole area from west to east, covering a course of , cutting through the Wu Mountains at three places and forming the well-known Three Gorges: the Qutang, Wuxia and Xiling gorges. Coming from northwest and running through &quot;the Jialing Lesser Three Gorges&quot; of Libi, Wentang and Guanyin, the Jialing River joins the Yangtze in Chongqing.

The central urban area of Chongqing, called Chongqing proper, is built on mountains and partially surrounded by the Yangtze and Jialing rivers. With its special topography, Chongqing&#x27;s topography includes mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfalls, gorges, and caves. The Tang dynasty poet Li Bai was inspired by the natural scenery and wrote this epigram.

The Zhongliang () and Tongluo () mountains roughly form the eastern and western boundaries of Chongqing&#x27;s urban area. Several high mountains are situated outside central Chongqing, including the -high Wugong Ling Mountain in Jiangjin.

===Climate===

Chongqing has a monsoonal humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;), bordering on a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) and for most of the year experiences very high relative humidity, with all months above 75%. Known as one of the &quot;Three Furnaces&quot; of the Yangtze River, along with Wuhan and Nanjing, its summers are long and among the hottest and most humid in China, with highs of in July and August in the urban area. Winters are short and somewhat mild, but damp and overcast. The city&#x27;s location in the Sichuan Basin causes it to have one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, at only 983 hours, lower than much of Northern Europe; the monthly percent possible sunshine in the city proper ranges from a mere 5% in January to 43% in August. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from on 11 January 1955 (unofficial record of was set on 8 February 1943) to on 18 and 19 August 2022 (unofficial record of was set on 8 and 9 August 1933).

Chongqing, with over 100 days of fog per year, is known as the &quot;Fog City&quot; (); this is because in the spring and fall, a thick layer of fog enshrouds it for 68 days per year. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), this special weather possibly played a role in protecting the city from being overrun by the Imperial Japanese Army.


==Cityscape==


==Politics==


Since 1997, Chongqing has been a direct-controlled municipality in the Chinese administrative structure, making it a provincial-level division with commensurate political importance. The municipality&#x27;s leader is Secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, the country&#x27;s second highest governing council. Under the USSR-inspired nomenklatura system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the CCP and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include He Guoqiang, Wang Yang, Bo Xilai, Zhang Dejiang, and Sun Zhengcai, the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal party standing committee, the &quot;de facto&quot; top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.

The municipal People&#x27;s Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.

The municipality also has a Municipal People&#x27;s Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People&#x27;s Congresses. The People&#x27;s Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People&#x27;s Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People&#x27;s Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People&#x27;s Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (&quot;zhengxie&quot;) meets at around the same time as the People&#x27;s Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The &quot;zhengxie&quot; is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.

===Military===
Chongqing was the wartime capital of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War (i.e., World War II), and from 1937 to 1945, the seat of administration for the Republic of China&#x27;s government before its departure to Nanjing and then Taiwan. After the eventual defeat at the Battle of Wuhan General Chiang-Kai Shek and the army were forced to use it as base of resistance from 1938 onwards. It also contains a military museum named after the Chinese Korean War hero Qiu Shaoyun.

Chongqing used to be the headquarters of the 13th Group Army of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, one of the two group armies that formerly comprised the Chengdu Military Region, which was reorganized into the Western Theater Command in 2016.

===Administrative divisions===
Chongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The municipality is divided into 38 subdivisions (3 were abolished in 1997, and Wansheng and Shuangqiao districts were abolished in October 2011), consisting of 26 districts, 8 counties, and 4 autonomous counties. The boundaries of Chongqing municipality reach much farther into the city&#x27;s hinterland than the boundaries of the other three provincial level municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and much of its administrative area, which spans over , is rural. At the end of year 2018, the total population is 31.02 million. As of 2022, Chongqing is the largest Chinese city by urban population, with a population of 22.80 million.

==Economy==

Chongqing was a major recipient of China&#x27;s investment in industrial capacity during the Third Front campaign.

There has been a massive government push to transform Chongqing into the region&#x27;s economic, trade, and financial center and use the municipality as a platform to open up the country&#x27;s western interior to further development. Chongqing is facing rapid urbanization. For instance, statistics suggest that new construction added approximately daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. Thus, Chongqing was separated from Sichuan province and made into a municipality in its own right on 14 March 1997 in order to accelerate its development and subsequently China&#x27;s relatively poorer western areas (see China Western Development strategy). By the 2000s the city had become an important industrial area in western China.

, Chongqing&#x27;s nominal GDP was US$433 billion (CN¥ 2.91 trilion), about 2.41% of the country&#x27;s GDP and ranked 16th among province-level administrative units; the municipality&#x27;s primary, secondary and tertiary industries were worth CN¥201.21 billion (US$29.92 billion), CN¥1.169 trillion (US$173.86 billion) and CN¥1.542 trillion (US$229.3 billion) respectively. Its nominal GDP per capita was US$13,479 (CN¥90,663) and ranked 10th in the country.

Chongqing has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Maanshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.

Traditionally, due to its geographic inaccessibility, Chongqing and Sichuan have both been important military bases in weapons research and development. Even though Chongqing&#x27;s industries are diversified, unlike eastern China, its export sector is small due to its relatively disadvantageous inland location. Instead, factories producing local-oriented consumer goods such as processed food, cars, chemicals, textiles, machinery, sports equipment and electronics are common.

Chongqing is China&#x27;s third largest motor vehicle production center and the largest for motorcycles. In 2007, it had an annual output capacity of 1 million cars and 8.6 million motorcycles. Leading makers of cars and motorbikes includes China&#x27;s fourth biggest automaker; Changan Automotive Corp and Lifan Hongda Enterprise, as well as Ford Motor Company, with the US car giant having 3 plants in Chongqing. The municipality is also one of China&#x27;s nine largest iron and steel producers in China as well as one of its three major aluminum producers. Important manufacturers include Chongqing Iron and Steel Company (重庆钢铁股份有限公司) and Southwest Aluminum (西南鋁業), which is Asia&#x27;s largest aluminum plant. Agriculture remains significant. Rice and fruits, especially oranges, are the area&#x27;s main produce. Natural resources are also abundant with large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese. Coal reserves total approximately . Chuandong Natural Gas Field is China&#x27;s largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270 billion m3 – more than 1/5 of China&#x27;s total. Has China&#x27;s largest reserve of strontium (China has the world&#x27;s 2nd biggest strontium deposit). Manganese is mined in the Xiushan area. Although the mining sector has been denounced as heavily polluting and unsafe. Chongqing is also planned to be the site of a 10 million ton capacity refinery operated by CNPC (parent company of PetroChina) to process imported crude oil from the Sino-Myanmar pipelines. The pipeline itself, though not yet finished, will eventually run from Sittwe (in Myanmar&#x27;s western coast) through Kunming in Yunnan before reaching Chongqing and it will provide China with fuels sourced from Myanmar, the Middle East and Africa. Recently, there has been a drive to move up the value chain by shifting towards high technology and knowledge intensive industries resulting in new development zones such as the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ). Chongqing&#x27;s local government is hoping through the promotion of favorable economic policies for the electronics and information technology sectors, that it can create a 400 billion RMB high technology manufacturing hub which will surpass its car industry and account for 25% of its exports.

The city has also invested heavily in infrastructure to attract investment. The network of roads and railways connecting Chongqing to the rest of China has been expanded and upgraded reducing logistical costs. Furthermore, the nearby Three Gorges Dam which is the world&#x27;s largest, supplies Chongqing with power and allows oceangoing ships to reach Chongqing&#x27;s Yangtze River port. These infrastructure improvements have led to the arrivals of numerous foreign direct investors (FDI) in industries ranging from car to finance and retailing; such as Ford, Mazda, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, ANZ Bank, Scotiabank, Wal-Mart, Metro AG and Carrefour, among other multinational corporations.

===Economic and technological development zones===
The city includes a number of economic and technological development zones:
* Chongqing Chemical Industrial Park
* Chongqing Economic &amp; Technological Development Zone
* Chongqing Hi-Tech Industry Development Zone
* Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ)
* Chongqing Export Processing Zone
* Jianqiao Industrial Park (located in Dadukou District)
* Liangjiang New Area
* Liangjiang Cloud Computing Center (the largest of its kind in China)

Chongqing itself is part of the West Triangle Economic Zone, along with Chengdu and Xi&#x27;an.

==Education and research==
, Chongqing hosts 70 institutions of higher education (excluding adult colleges), making it the fourth city with the most higher education institutions nationwide and the first city in Western China, which comprises Chongqing, six provinces (Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai), and three autonomous regions (Tibet, Ningxia, and Xinjiang), with a combination of more than 290 million population.

, the municipality had 31 bridges across the Yangtze River including over a dozen in the city&#x27;s urban core. Aside from the city&#x27;s first two Yangtze River bridges, which were built, respectively, in 1960 and 1977, all of the other bridges were completed since 1995.

===Public transit===
====Chongqing Rail Transit====


Public transport in Chongqing consists of metro, intercity railway, a ubiquitous bus system and the world&#x27;s largest monorail network.

According to the Chongqing Municipal Government&#x27;s ambitious plan in May 2007, Chongqing is investing 150 billion RMB over 13 years to finish a system that combines underground metro lines with heavy monorail.

, four metro lines, the long CRT Line 1, a conventional subway, and the long heavy monorail CRT Line 2 (through Phase II), Line 3, a heavy monorail connects the airport and the southern part of downtown. Line 6, runs between Beibei, a district in the city&#x27;s far north to downtown. Line 5 opened in late 2017.

It was planned that by 2020 CRT would consist of 6 lines and 1 loop line, adding of road and railway to the 2012 transportation infrastructure, and 93 new metro stations would be added to the 111 stations in place in 2012. By 2050 Chongqing would have 18 lines.

====Aerial tramway====

Chongqing is the only Chinese city that has kept public aerial tramways. There were three aerial tramways in Chongqing: the Yangtze River Tramway, the Jialing River Tramway and the South Mountain Tramway, of which the Yangtze River Tramway is the only one still operating, now considered a Class 4A tourist attraction. The -long tramway connects the southern and northern banks of the Yangtze River, carrying about 10,000 passengers a day.
===Rail===
Major stations in Chongqing:

* Chongqing railway station in Yuzhong, accessible via Metro Lines 1 &amp; 3 (Lianglukou Metro station), is the city&#x27;s oldest railway station and located near the Jiefangbei CBD in the city center. The station handles mostly long-distance trains. There are plans for a major renovation and overhaul of this station, thus many services have been transferred to Chongqing North railway station.
* Chongqing North railway station is a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to Chengdu, Beijing and other cities. It was completed in 2006 and is connected to Metro Line.
* Chongqing West railway station is in Shapingba, a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to many cities, completed in 2018.
* Shapingba railway station is in Shapingba, near Shapingba CBD, accessible via Shapingba metro station on Lines 1, 9 and the Loop line. It handles many local and regional train services. It was completed in 2018.
* Chongqing East railway station was expected to be completed in 2025.

Chongqing is a major freight destination for rail with continued development with improved handling facilities. Due to subsidies and incentives, the relocation and construction of many factories in Chongqing has seen a huge increase in rail traffic.

Chongqing is a major rail hub regionally.
* Chengdu–Chongqing railway (to Chengdu, Sichuan Province)
* Sichuan–Guizhou railway (to Guiyang, Guizhou Province)
* Xiangyang–Chongqing railway (to Hubei Province)
* Chongqing–Huaihua railway (to Hunan Province)
* Suining–Chongqing railway (to Sichuan Province)

===River port===

Chongqing is one of the most important inland ports in China. There are numerous luxury cruise ships that terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the Yangtze River to Yichang, Wuhan, Nanjing or even Shanghai. In the recent past, this provided virtually the only transportation option along the river. However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exist throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.

===Highways===
Traditionally, the road network in Chongqing has been narrow, winding and limited to smaller vehicles because of the natural terrain, large rivers and the huge population demands on the area, especially in the Yuzhong District. In other places, such as Jiangbei, large areas of homes and buildings have recently been cleared to improve the road network and create better urban planning; thus, several ring roads have also been constructed. This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. The construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to its neighbors. The natural mountainous terrain that Chongqing is built on makes many road projects difficult to construct, including for example some of the world&#x27;s highest road bridges.

Unlike many other Chinese cities, it is rare for motorbikes, electric scooters or bicycles to be seen on Chongqing&#x27;s Roads. This is due to the extremely hilly and mountainous nature of Chongqing&#x27;s roads and streets. However, despite this, Chongqing is a manufacturing center for these types of vehicles.

The first important bridge in urban Chongqing was the Niujiaotuo Jialing River Bridge, built in 1958. The first bridge over the Yangtze river was the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge (or Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge) built in 1977.

, within the area of the 9 districts, there were 20 bridges on the Yangtze river and 28 bridges on the Jialing river. The bridges in Chongqing exhibit a variety of shapes and structures, making Chongqing a showcase for bridge design.

<doc id="171753" wikidata="Q7961801" url="?curid=171753" title="Wales &amp; West">
<text>Wales &amp; West was a train operating company in the United Kingdom that operated the South Wales &amp; West franchise from 1996 until 2001.

The franchise was operated by Prism Rail from October 1996 until July 2000, when the firm was taken over by National Express. The company ceased to operate trains in October 2001, following a reorganisation of rail franchises.

==Operations==
Originally privatised under the name &quot;South Wales and West Railway&quot;, the company operated a network of local and middle-distance services in South Wales and the south west of England. These ranged from rural services in Cornwall and Pembrokeshire to urban commuter services in the Bristol area.

Longer-distance services operated under the Alphaline brand provided regular links to North Wales and the north west of England, as well as to the South Coast and London Waterloo.

Wales &amp; West received considerable government subsidy. The first full financial year (1997/98) was supported by a payment of £70.9 million, with expenditure due to reduce to £38.1 million for its final trading year of 2003/04. The provisional claim from British Rail for the year 1996/97 had been £84.8 million, including an administered profit of £4.8 million.

==Rolling stock==
Wales &amp; West inherited a fleet of Class 143, Class 150, Class 153 and Class 158s from British Rail. Wales &amp; West also hired-in some locomotive-hauled trains on occasion.

Wales &amp; West&#x27;s fleet was maintained at Cardiff Canton and Exeter depots.

==Enhancements==
Wales &amp; West carried out various enhancements to their 78-vehicle Class 158 fleet including new carpets, internal repainting and upgrades to air conditioning equipment. Seating was replaced throughout, with a revised layout offering a greater proportion of seats at tables and fewer airline-style seats.

One member of the Class 158 fleet was used to trial additional safety features. This included an airline-style lighting strip along the carriage aisle leading to the exits and illuminated arrows above internal doorways. In time, most of the company&#x27;s trains also received an automated system of pre-recorded safety announcements.

Prism Rail also gave an undertaking to install passenger information displays at 205 stations. This ambitious project went on to cost Prism significantly more than expected, with no chance of recouping its investment – but the commitment was upheld and the project completed. Even the remote Sugar Loaf station that typically receives fewer than 100 passengers per year was equipped.

Other improvements committed to included:
* Raising punctuality targets from 90% to 92% 
* Raising reliability targets from 99% to 99.5%
* Station improvements including waiting shelters and personal security features
* Re-staffing seven stations for an experimental period of 12 months

==Corporate identity==

By the end of the 1990s, the company had started to develop its own vehicle liveries to replace those inherited from Regional Railways. An experimental silver, blue and orange livery carried by 158867 evolved into a dedicated silver and navy livery for the flagship Alphaline fleet. The rest of the fleet began to receive an array of different promotional liveries featuring locations from the company&#x27;s operating area.

The shortened Wales and West name was adopted to replace the original identity of South Wales &amp; West Railway, with various updates to the company logo taking place. 

===Logos===
==Demise==
In 2000 the Strategic Rail Authority announced its intention that a single all-Wales franchise should take over the majority of rail services in Wales. Accordingly, the Wales and West brand was withdrawn in October 2001 and services were redistributed between franchises and rebranded as follows:
* The Valley Lines franchisee, Cardiff Railway Company Ltd, took on responsibility for most of Wales &amp; West&#x27;s services in Wales and changed its principal trading name to Wales and Borders Trains.
* Other services primarily focused on south west England remained with Wales and West Passenger Trains Ltd. which changed its trading name to Wessex Trains.

<text>Wales and Borders was a train operating company in the United Kingdom owned by National Express that operated the Wales &amp; Borders franchise from October 2001 until December 2003.

==History==
In October 1996, the Valley Lines franchise commenced operating services around Cardiff and the South Wales Valleys. In March 2000, the Strategic Rail Authority decided to re-organise the Valley Lines and Wales &amp; West franchises, both being operated by National Express.

Valley Lines became Wales &amp; Borders from October 2001, combining its services with most of Wales &amp; West&#x27;s Welsh services and the Cambrian Line services from Central Trains. In September 2003 Wales &amp; Borders took over the North Wales Coast Line services from First North Western.

==Services==
Wales and Borders operated passenger services in Wales and the West Country as seen in their route map. It also operated services to Liverpool Lime Street, Manchester Piccadilly, Birmingham International, Penzance and London Waterloo.

On 14 October 2001, the services from Birmingham New Street to Chester, Aberystwyth, and Pwllheli operated by Central Trains were transferred.

On 28 September 2003, the services from Birmingham New Street, Crewe and Manchester Piccadilly to Llandudno and Holyhead as well as those between Bidston and Wrexham Central and Llandudno and Blaenau Ffestiniog operated by First North Western were also transferred.

==Rolling stock==
Wales and Borders inherited a fleet of Class 142, Class 143 and Class 150s from Valley Lines and Class 158s from Wales &amp; West and Central Trains. From First North Western it inherited Class 153 and Class 175s.

Wales and Borders also used Mark 2 carriages on Rhymney Line and Fishguard Harbour services hauled by English Welsh &amp; Scottish EWS Class 37s and Mark 2 carriages hauled by English Welsh &amp; Scottish Class 47s on North Wales Coast Line services.

==Depot==
Wales and Borders&#x27; fleet was maintained at Cardiff Canton depot.

==Demise==
On 1 August 2003, the Strategic Rail Authority awarded the new franchise to Arriva with the services operated by Wales &amp; Borders transferring to Arriva Trains Wales on 7 December 2003.

<text>Arriva Trains Northern was a train operating company in England owned by Arriva that operated the Regional Railways North East franchise from March 1997 until December 2004. 

== History ==
As part of the privatisation of British Rail, the Regional Railways North East franchise was awarded by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising to MTL after it won the contest from a field of Connex, FirstBus, Grand Central, a management/Via-GTI consortium, National Express, Prism Rail and Stagecoach. The franchise commenced on 2 March 1997.

In May 1998, the franchise was rebranded as Northern Spirit with a livery of turquoise with a lime green stylised italic &quot;N&quot; across the midsection introduced.

At the same time, the long distance regional services connecting Sunderland, Newcastle, Scarborough and Hull with Manchester, Liverpool and Blackpool were sub-branded under the TransPennine Express banner with rolling stock painted in a base colour of maroon with a gold stylised italic &quot;N&quot; across the midsection. These services would later become a franchise in their own right from 2004, which is currently operated by TransPennine Express.

On 18 February 2000, MTL was purchased by Arriva, and on 27 April 2001 the franchise was rebranded as Arriva Trains Northern. The Arriva corporate turquoise and stone livery was introduced on refurbished 153352 in July 2001.

==Services==
Arriva Trains Northern operated a mix of long distance regional, local urban and rural passenger services in the North of England and Yorkshire and the Humber extending across the Pennines.

The network extended from Carlisle and Chathill in the north to Sunderland, Scarborough, Hull and Cleethorpes on the east coast down to Sheffield and across to Manchester, Liverpool, Blackpool and Morecambe on the West Coast.

A daily Leeds to Glasgow Central via the Settle &amp; Carlisle and West Coast Main Lines service was introduced in September 1999, the first time such a service had operated since 1982.

==Problems==
A long-running dispute with the RMT union lead to a prolonged period of industrial action. As a result, in 2001, the Strategic Rail Authority imposed a £2million fine. Throughout its life, the franchise suffered a shortage of drivers and rolling stock which led to many cancellations on a daily basis. An emergency timetable was later brought in which cancelled many services on a permanent basis rather than random as before.

==Rolling stock==
Arriva Trains Northern inherited a fleet of Class 142, Class 144, Class 150, Class 153, Class 155, Class 156, Class 158, Class 308 and Class 321s from Regional Railways.

In September 1998, Northern Spirit traded seven of its Class 142s (142085-091) to Valley Lines in exchange for seven Class 150s (150268-274), although between October and December 2002 these were swapped for unrefurbished units 142072-77 and 142080-083, as 142086-091 had only recently been refurbished by Northern Spirit and Valley Lines wished to start their own refurbishment from scratch. In January 2001, the first of 16 Class 333s ordered to replace the Class 308s, entered service.

A shortage of available rolling stock to meet increasing demand led Arriva Trains Northern to lease Class 37s and ex Virgin CrossCountry Mark 2 carriages from English Welsh &amp; Scottish to top and tail a daily service from Leeds to Carlisle for 12 months from September 2003. It also operated a peak hour Knaresborough to Leeds service.

Some of the rolling stock was owned by the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive and these were repainted red and silver with the Metro logos of the passenger transport executive.

==Depots==
Arriva Trains Northern&#x27;s fleet was maintained at Heaton depot in Newcastle upon Tyne and Neville Hill depot in Leeds.

==Demise==
In 2000, the Strategic Rail Authority announced that it planned to create a new TransPennine Express franchise transferring Arriva Train Northern&#x27;s long distance regional services with the remainder to be combined with those of the Regional Railways North West franchise to form a new Northern Rail franchise.

In July 2003, the Strategic Rail Authority awarded the TransPennine franchise to FirstGroup/Keolis with services operated by Arriva Trains Northern transferring to First TransPennine Express on 1 February 2004.

In July 2004, the Strategic Rail Authority awarded the Northern Rail franchise to Serco-Abellio with the remaining services operated by Arriva Trains Northern transferring to Northern Rail on 12 December 2004.

In 2015, it was announced that Arriva had been awarded the Northern franchise, trading this time as Northern by Arriva. This franchise started in April 2016. However, this franchise was terminated early due to poor performance at the end of February 2020.

When the passenger rail franchise was subsumed into GTR, Southern was split from Gatwick Express and the two became separate brands, alongside the Thameslink and Great Northern brands.

Southern operates the majority of commuter services from its Central London terminals at London Bridge and to South London, East and West Sussex, as well as regional services in parts of Hampshire, Kent and Surrey. It also provides services between Watford Junction and Croydon via the West London line.

For three consecutive years from 2016 to 2018, Southern came last on passenger satisfaction in surveys conducted by the consumer group &quot;Which?&quot;, scoring low for value for money, reliability, and punctuality in 2018. In 2022, Southern was ranked second-worst on overall passenger satisfaction in a survey conducted by Transport Focus.

==History==
As part of the wider privatisation of the state owned railway operator British Rail in the 1990s, Connex South Central was awarded the Network SouthCentral franchise by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising. Operations commenced on 26 May 1996.

In March 2000, the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority (SSRA) announced its intention to relet the franchise from May 2003; both Connex and Govia were shortlisted. In October 2000, the SSRA announced that Govia had been awarded the franchise and would operate it from May 2003. Govia negotiated a deal with Connex to buy out the remainder of its franchise, this was completed in August 2001. Govia trading as SouthCentral took over operations on 26 August 2001. The franchise was originally to run for twenty years but, in 2002, the Strategic Rail Authority changed the way it handled financing agreements and therefore Govia was re-awarded with a seven-and-a-half-year franchise until December 2009.

In May 2003, the franchise was rebranded as Southern in a recall of the pre-nationalisation Southern Railway, using a green roundel logo with &quot;Southern&quot; in yellow in a green bar.

During April 2007, the Department for Transport (DfT) announced that the Gatwick Express franchise was to be incorporated into the main South Central franchise. This reorganisation was part of a wider plan to increase capacity on the Brighton Main Line, involving the extension of peak-hour services from Gatwick to Brighton and Eastbourne from December 2008. This change doubled the number of London to Brighton express trains during those periods.

In December 2008, Southern took over the services on the Redhill to Tonbridge Line from Southeastern.

The South Central franchise end date was brought forward to September 2009 upon the integration of the Gatwick Express service, to allow the new operator to be in place during major changes to the timetable in and around South London in December 2009. In the run-up to the bidding process for the franchise, reports emerged suggesting that Transport for London, the operator of the London Overground service, wished to take control of all overground services in South London, including the &#x27;Metro&#x27; area of the South Central franchise. However, such a transfer never took place and the DfT put out the entire franchise for tender.

In August 2008, the DfT shortlisted Govia, National Express, NedRail and Stagecoach for the new South Central franchise. In June 2009, the DfT announced that Govia had retained the franchise, to start on 20 September 2009.

In March 2012, the Department for Transport announced that Abellio, FirstGroup, Govia, MTR and Stagecoach had been shortlisted for the new Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise. The Invitation to Tender was to be issued in October 2012, with the successful bidder announced in spring 2013. However, in the wake of the collapse of the InterCity West Coast refranchising process, the government announced in October 2012 that the process would be put on hold pending the results of a review.

In December 2012, Southern&#x27;s to via service ceased, being partially replaced by London Overground&#x27;s new to service.

At the conclusion of the Southern franchise in July 2015, the South Central franchise was merged into the Govia Thameslink Railway franchise, which is run as a management contract rather than a traditional franchise. However, the Southern brand was retained.

===2007 and 2008 timetables===
Southern was criticised for major changes to its timetables in December 2007 and December 2008.

In December 2007, Southern changed the arrangement for the splitting of services to and from London Victoria on the Arun Valley Line, opting to split trains at Horsham rather than Barnham, as well as run the portion to Portsmouth or Southampton non-stop to Barnham. Some passengers criticised this change as it increased the journey time to and from London by up to 10 minutes from certain stations, while in the event of services running behind schedule, trains were sometimes not split at Horsham, and proceeded non-stop to Barnham, leaving Arun Valley commuters at Horsham with the prospect of no onward trains.

During December 2008, further timetable changes included the introduction of the extended Gatwick Express services. However, reliability and timekeeping on some of the new services were considered poor, leading to several public meetings being held. On 22 January 2009, Southern responded to some of these criticisms. During 2009, these services have recorded improved timekeeping and criticisms have since subsided.

The new timetable also led to unhappiness due to the difference in speed and frequency of service between East Coastway services and those on the Brighton Main Line.

===December 2010 timetable===
Further changes to the timetable were made in December 2010; the first timetable change to include many of the requirements of the new franchise. Additional services were included at evenings and weekends. In the London area a &#x27;metro&#x27; frequency of service was introduced on most routes with the extension of the weekday daytime four-trains-per-hour norm to late evenings (up to around midnight), Saturdays and Sundays. In addition, new late-night services were introduced from London on Friday and Saturday nights with last trains leaving central London at around 00:30.

Outside London, a new later-evening service was introduced to Uckfield from London Bridge, new late-night services from Brighton along the West Coastway line and direct services between Southampton and Brighton on Sundays.

===Punctuality and overcrowding===
In January 2015, Southern hit controversy when it was revealed that the 7.29am Brighton to London Victoria train failed to get in on time on any occasion out of all 240 attempts in 2014. Later in May 2015 it was revealed that Southern had fined passengers for standing in first class on an overcrowded train. Only 20% of Southern trains arrived on time in the year from April 2015 to March 2016, and there was an ongoing industrial dispute over driver-only operated trains. In late 2016, the Transport Select Committee told ministers to &quot;get a grip&quot; on railway franchises, with their report asking if the train operator was in breach of their contractual obligations due to the large number of cancelled trains, and went on to say, &quot;in normal circumstances, this would be grounds for termination of the contract&quot;.

===2016 amended timetable===
In 2016, the company introduced an &quot;amended timetable [that] would be a temporary measure until staffing returned to normal&quot; to be announced on 5 July. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) trade union said that 350 services would be cancelled every day (the company ran 2,242 weekday services in the previous timetable). The company said it had insufficient personnel, and too many were taking sick leave; the union denied that high levels of sickness were the cause of cancellations, while agreeing that there were an insufficient number of guards and drivers.

The government Department for Transport said that the situation was unacceptable. While the company was obliged to notify the department in advance, this did not amount to giving the company permission for the changes. The RMT union general secretary Mick Cash said the government had permitted GTR to introduce the emergency timetable, but that it was &quot;nothing to do with staff sickness and everything to do with gross mismanagement of this franchise and the failure to employ enough guards and drivers. ... a cynical and cowardly ploy&quot;.

The &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; mentioned Southern in an article in June 2016 &quot;Southern rail suggests commuter goes on 100 mile detour to Clapham instead of her normal six minute journey&quot;. In June 2016, amongst criticism of the performance of its services, Go-Ahead warned of lower than anticipated profits on its Govia Thameslink Railway franchises, leading to an 18% drop in the Go-Ahead share price.

From 31 October 2016, Southern restored the full weekday timetable.

===Control of doors and strikes===

In 2016, Southern altered its method of door operation, with control of the doors moving from the conductor to the driver. Southern said this would allow the conductor to concentrate on the passengers, but the RMT and Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) unions said that it was an attempt to make conductors unnecessary and would be unsafe. The rail safety regulator, the Rail Standards and Safety Board has said that &quot;We have 30 years of data which we have analysed. We have found that the driver performing the task does not increase the risk to passengers at all.&quot; During 2016, the RMT and ASLEF unions went on strike over the changes, causing severe disruption to Southern services. The strikes continued into 2017.

The BBC suggested that the RMT union are particularly worried about the new method of operation because if drivers (rather than conductors) control the doors then trains could run without conductors and thus any strike by conductors would not have the power to cancel trains.

In December 2016, it was announced that the government would pay £50million to Southern to cover the costs of the disruption caused by the strikes, due to a deal between the government and Southern. This deal means that the government pays £38million for lost revenue and £15million in compensation to passengers. This deal also means that Govia Thameslink Railway will save around £1.1million in pay for striking workers. Commentators argued that the government gave a management contract rather than a normal franchise to GTR in order to push through DOO. The management contract meant that GTR did not have the incentive to resolve strikes as a normal franchisee would have, as the government lost money from strikes rather than GTR.

On 2 February 2017, the TUC announced that talks between Southern and ASLEF had reached an agreement meaning that the dispute with ASLEF had been resolved. However, the RMT union said it was &#x27;betrayed&#x27; by Southern and that strikes by the RMT would continue. On 29 June 2017, ASLEF implemented an overtime ban with the aim of highlighting a claimed failure by Southern to recruit adequate staff.

==Services==
&lt;section begin=service-table/&gt;
The standard off-peak service as of June 2024 is:

&lt;section end=service-table/&gt;
==Rolling stock==

, Southern services are almost entirely operated by 214 Class 377 electric multiple units, with the exception of services on the unelectrified Marshlink line and the Uckfield branch of the Oxted line, which use Class 171 diesel multiple units.

South Central inherited a fleet of Class 205, Class 207, Class 319, Class 421, Class 423, Class 455 and Class 456 multiple-unit trains from Connex South Central. Southern inherited a Class 73 locomotive and Class 460 &quot;Juniper&quot; trains from Gatwick Express.

A franchise commitment was to replace all the Mark 1 slam-door stock, resulting in Southern ordering 28 three-car DC, 139 four-car DC and 15 four-car dual-voltage Class 377 &quot;Electrostars&quot; in September 2001 and March 2002 to replace the Class 421, Class 422 and Class 423s.

In August 2002, Southern ordered nine two-car and six four-car Class 171 &quot;Turbostars&quot; to replace the Class 205s and Class 207s on the routes that are not fully electrified. A tenth two-car Class 171 was transferred from South West Trains, entering traffic in July 2007.

In 2007, Southern ordered 12 four-car, dual-voltage Class 377/5 &quot;Electrostars&quot; to replace the remaining twelve Class 319s for transfer to First Capital Connect. In March 2008 Go Ahead purchased a further 11 Class 377/5s. All 23 ended up being sublet to First Capital Connect to provide extra stock for the Thameslink Programme Key Output Zero changes from March 2009. However, due to delays in their production, Class 377/2s were also sublet. To cover for this, Class 350/1s were subleased from London Midland.

To provide stock for the extended Gatwick Express services to Brighton, in 2008 Southern leased 17 Class 442 &quot;Wessex Electrics&quot; withdrawn by South West Trains in early 2007. After retaining the franchise in 2009, Southern leased the remaining seven Class 442s. The last of the Class 460 &quot;Junipers&quot; were withdrawn in September 2012.

To release Class 377/3s for use on London suburban services, Southern introduced a fleet of ex-London Overground Class 313s on the Coastway lines from May 2010. The Class 313s remained in service until May 2023, when they were withdrawn and replaced by Class 377s.

During 2011, Southern announced that, because of delays in procuring new trains for the Thameslink Programme, the 23 Class 377/5s on sub-lease to First Capital Connect would not be returned in time to deliver the operator&#x27;s planned capacity increases from the December 2013 timetable change. It therefore began a process to procure 130 new vehicles. It was announced in December 2011 that Bombardier had been contracted to supply 26 five-car Class 377/6s. In November 2012, it was announced that an option for a further 40 vehicles was being exercised.

All twenty-four Class 456s were transferred to South West Trains in 2014 after the introduction of the Class 377/6 fleet.

In April 2016, Southern commenced a lease for nine three-carriage Class 170s last used by First ScotRail from Eversholt Rail Group. Four (170421–424) moved to Wolverton Works in 2015 and were reconfigured as two two-carriage and two four-carriage Class 171s. The other five (170416–420) remained in Scotland on sub-lease to Abellio ScotRail and were scheduled to move to Southern in 2018.

In May 2022, Southern withdrew its Class 455s and received 2 Class 377s from Southeastern.

On 7 September 2022, three Class 171s, having been reformed to three-car formations and renumbered to 170422–424, transferred to East Midlands Railway.

Between December 2024 and December 2025, Southern is set to transfer 13 Class 377/1s (377121-133) to Southeastern to replace ageing Class 465 units. This will be made possible by the movement of 30 ex-Greater Anglia Class 379 sets to Great Northern route services from London Kings Cross, which will in turn allow Class 387/1 dual-voltage units currently in service with Great Northern to be released to work on Southern routes.

===Current fleet===
===Past fleet===
Former units operated by Southern include:
===Depots===
Southern&#x27;s fleet is maintained at Brighton Lovers Walk and Selhurst depots. The Gatwick Express fleet is maintained at Stewarts Lane.

Light maintenance is also carried out at Littlehampton for the electric fleet, and St Leonards for the class 171 fleet when on Marshlink services.

==Future==
Southern, as part of its successful bid for the South Central franchise in 2009, made several commitments to improving services across the network. These included:
* Increasing the length of suburban services in South London to 10 cars between 2011 and 2013
* Increasing the service level on all routes in South London to 4 trains per hour (tph) until 23:00 each day, and the introduction of late-night services on Fridays and Saturdays
* The introduction of an hourly service on Sundays between Brighton and Southampton Central, and an increase in the number of late-night services between Brighton and Worthing
* The introduction of late-night services on the London to Uckfield route
* Installation of new ticket gates at 22 stations across the network
* Increasing the number of car-parking spaces at stations by 1,000 and the number of cycle spaces by 1,500
* Cleaning and refreshing of all stations and trains on the network
* Major refurbishments to seven stations: , , , , , and 

===Uckfield–Lewes line===
The franchise consultation paper released at the beginning of the 2009 franchising process stated that the ultimate franchise agreement would include a change mechanism to enable the DfT to incorporate additional routes into the South Central franchise, and it invited bidders to submit priced options for schemes put forward by stakeholders. One such scheme could, as indicated in the South Central Franchise Consultation Paper, be the reopening of the Uckfield – Lewes line, closed in 1969. During the 2010s, several interested parties have been examining the possibility of reopening the line.

===Future of the franchise===
In January 2016, Transport for London announced a proposal to take over the London suburban parts of the franchise in 2021 through a partnership with the Department for Transport to form a new suburban metro service. However, the plan was rejected by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling in December 2016.

In January 2017, it was reported that the Department for Transport was considering temporarily renationalising the franchise if the service did not improve.

On 17 June 2021, the DfT extended the current contract from 19 September 2021 to 31 March 2022.

The contract for the delivery of Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern services was extended by the DfT on 25 March 2022. The current contract will now expire on 1 April 2028.

==Rolling out of smartcards==

Southern was criticised in January 2007 for not wishing to introduce Oyster Pay As You Go on its London routes, stating that it was not financially viable. In 2007, Southern introduced Oyster on its Watford Junction to Clapham Junction route, and the company later agreed in principle to the introduction of Oyster across its network, but did not give any firm timescale, managing director Chris Burchell saying &quot;There are still a number of outstanding issues that need to be discussed with TfL, but we do not believe these will prevent us making PAYG a reality on our network. We look forward to discussions with TfL on how we can make this happen as soon as possible for our passengers.&quot; In its successful franchise bid in 2009, Southern said it was committed to rolling out Oyster Pay As You Go in the London area, but also that such a move was subject to industry agreement. Since 2 January 2010, Oyster Pay As You Go has been valid on all its London routes, along with most other train services in the London area. In addition, Oyster is valid on Southern services beyond the Greater London boundary as far as Epsom, Epsom Downs, Tattenham Corner, Upper Warlingham, Caterham and Gatwick Airport.

===The Key===

In 2012, Southern became the first rail company in England to use the ITSO card on its network. The Key is a smartcard similar to Transport for London&#x27;s Oyster card. Tickets of various types can be purchased for the smartcard at ticket vending machines across the majority of the GTR network, except within Oyster-capable travel areas, as well as online (season tickets only).

Three forms of Key exist: child, adult, and staff. All child smartcards need a photograph, which is printed onto the card, as well as proof of age while registering. The Key can be de-activated and the tickets transferred to a new card sent out in the post if the smartcard is reported as lost, stolen or faulty. Staff smartcards are only issued to employees of GTR, and offer unlimited travel across all of GTR&#x27;s network.

The Key also has a pay-as-you-go feature called keyGo. With this, customers can tap in and out freely within the keyGo area, and the cheapest combination of tickets from the entire day&#x27;s taps are automatically calculated at the end of the railway day and automatically charged to a linked payment card. keyGo is also valid on Brighton &amp; Hove buses and Metrobus services within certain areas. Bus journeys are charged at the single, day zonal, day network or Plusbus rates as appropriate.

The Key can be used on all National Rail services where tickets are available for purchase on smartcards.

<text>Connexxion formerly [[Transdev#Netherlands|Transdev Netherlands]], [[Veolia Transport Nederland|Veolia Transport Nederlands]] and Connex Netherlands is a large public transport company in the Netherlands, operating in the west, middle, east, and southwest parts of the country. It is owned by Transdev and Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten. It is a subsidiary of Transdev Netherlands.

==History==


Connexxion was formed on 10 May 1999 from a merger between transport companies NZH, ZWN, Midnet and Oostnet. Its name is a mutation of the French word meaning connection. In January 2007, Connexxion took over Utrecht public transport operator GVU and Nijmegen operator Novio. In 2007, Connexxion&#x27;s 33% shareholding in Syntus was sold.

On 12 October 2007, Connexxion was privatised with a 67% stake purchased by Transdev-BNG-Connexxion Holding BV (TBCH), a consortium consisting of Transdev (75%) and Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten (BNG) (25%), beating a Deutsche Bahn / Rabobank consortium and FirstGroup. This gives Transdev 50%, BNG 17%, and the government a 33% stake in Connexxion. In February 2013, the government&#x27;s 33% shareholding was purchased by Transdev, increasing its shareholding to 86%.

Connexxion&#x27;s parent company, Transdev Netherlands, also had another operation called Veolia Transport Nederland. The branding was replaced with the Connexxion in December 2016. As a result, Veolia Transport Nederland&#x27;s Haaglanden operations were rebranded to Connexxion.

==Operations==
===Operating area===
Connexxion operate in Amstelland, Amsterdam-Zuidoost, Arnhem, Gooi, Haarlem, Hoeksche Waard, IJsselmonde, North Holland, Vechtstreek, Zaanstreek and Zeeland.

===Buses===
As of January 2016, Connexxion operated 1,900 buses and coaches. It operates the only trolleybus network in the Netherlands and, in 2017, introduced double-deckers on one route. Connexxion also owns bus companies Hermes and Novio.

In December 2013, Connexxion commenced operating the IJsselmonde, Rotterdam concession for 10 years. In December 2017, Connexxion will begin operating the Amstelland-Meerlanden concession for 10 years. An order has been placed with VDL for 100 Citeas SLFA electric buses. This will make it the largest operator of electric buses in Europe.

===Rail===
Connexxion is contracted to operate the Arnhem to Doetinchem concession until December 2020 and the Vallei line concession until December 2021.

Connexxion held the Almelo to Mariënberg concession from December 2006 until December 2013 however its operation was sub-contracted to Syntus. It operated the Sneltram between Utrecht and Nieuwegein until December 2013.

The fleet comprises five 2-car Protos electric multiple units, nine 3-car Stadler GTWs diesel multiple units, and two 3-car Stadler Flirts.

===Ferries===
Connexxion operated a ferry route from Velsen to IJmuiden and Amsterdam Centraal station with Voskhod hydrofoils until 31 December 2013.

===Taxis===
As of March 2015 Connexxion operated 3,500 taxis.

<text>Thames Trains was a train operating company in the United Kingdom owned by Go-Ahead Group, which operated the Thames Trains franchise from October 1996 until March 2004.

==History==
The Thames Trains franchise was awarded by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising to Victory Rail Holdings, a company owned by Go-Ahead (65%) and some ex-British Rail managers (35%), with operations commencing on 13 October 1996. Go-Ahead bought the remaining shares it did not own in June 1998.

The Ladbroke Grove rail crash of 5 October 1999 involved a Thames Trains Class 165, which had failed to stop at a red signal. Thames Trains was fined £2 million for violations of health and safety law in connection with the incident, and was also ordered to pay £75,000 in costs.

==Services==
Thames Trains ran services along the Great Western Main Line from London Paddington to Didcot with services continuing north to Oxford, Bicester Town, Hereford and Stratford-upon-Avon. It also operated services on the Greenford, Windsor &amp; Eton Central, Marlow, Henley and Bedwyn lines and on the Reading to Basingstoke and North Downs lines.

In 1998 a service from Oxford to Bristol was introduced in partnership with First Great Western. This was withdrawn in 2003 to relieve congestion, at the request of the Strategic Rail Authority.

==Rolling stock==


Thames Trains inherited a fleet of near-new Class 165 and Class 166 diesel multiple units from British Rail. Because the paintwork was still under warranty, the existing Network SouthEast livery was retained with only a Thames Trains logo added. Upon the warranty expiring, a new livery of white, blue and green was introduced in 2000.

==Depot==
Thames Trains&#x27; fleet was maintained at Reading TMD.

==Demise==
In April 2003 the Strategic Rail Authority invited FirstGroup and Go-Ahead to bid for a two-year franchise that would coincide with the end date of the First Great Western franchise, after which both would become part of the Greater Western franchise. In November 2003 the Strategic Rail Authority awarded the new franchise to First with the services operated by Thames Trains transferring to First Great Western Link on 1 April 2004.

<text>The September 11 attacks transformed the first term of President George W. Bush and led to what he referred to as the war on terror. The accuracy of describing it as a &quot;war&quot; and its political motivations and consequences are the topic of strenuous debate. The U.S. government increased military operations, economic measures, and political pressure on groups that it accused of being terrorists, as well as increasing pressure on the governments and countries which were accused of sheltering them. October 2001 saw the first military action initiated by the US. Under this policy, NATO invaded Afghanistan to remove the Taliban regime (which harbored al-Qaeda) and capture al-Qaeda forces.

Critics point out that the Afghan conflict has contributed to the destabilization of neighbouring Pakistan and Afghanistan has undergone a long war, culminating in the return of the Taliban in 2021. The US government has also asserted that the US invasion of Iraq is connected to 9/11.

== Immediate ==
===Rescue and recovery===

Because of the events that took place on September 11, 2001, American society as a whole suffered dramatically. Recovery took years, and the economy declined drastically after the attacks. Various first responders united that day to help as much as possible. Whether they were paramedics, police officers, firefighters, doctors, nurses, or ordinary civilians, the main objective was to cooperate and help the wounded. More than 1,500 first responders, ironworkers, engineers, heavy equipment operators, and other workers worked at Ground Zero to attempt to find survivors and clean up the wreckage. Cranes and bulldozers were brought in along with search and rescue dogs in order to locate survivors and bodies of the deceased, however, operations were hindered by the presence of approximately two feet of soot at the site, which obscured objects and bodies. 
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, only 20 survivors were pulled alive from the rubble, although there were several human remains and belongings that were removed from the site. The day after the attack, then-mayor Rudy Giuliani told reporters that they were receiving mobile phone calls from people trapped in the debris. The task of removing debris and rubble continued well into 2002, with some 108,000 truckloads of 1.8 million tons of rubble removed by May 2002.

==== Hazards ====
Outside of the general hazards due to fires, falling debris, heavy machinery, broken metal, and hazardous air conditions, there were also hidden concerns within the clean-up zone. The parking garage under the World Trade Center at the time of the attacks held nearly 2,000 automobiles; each held an estimated 5 gallons of gasoline, which could ignite and explode. Other concerns were around buried fuel tanks that were located on the site, and the 1.2 million rounds of ammunition that were housed at Building 6 for the use of the U.S. Customs Service.

===US public reaction===

Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, George W. Bush&#x27;s job approval rating soared to 86%. On September 20, 2001, the president spoke before the nation and a joint-session of Congress, regarding the events of that day, the intervening nine days of rescue and recovery efforts, and his intent in response to those events in going after the terrorists who orchestrated the attacks. In the speech, he characterized the speech itself as being akin to the President&#x27;s customary State of the Union address.

The attacks also had immediate and overwhelming effects upon the United States population. People began rallying around the popularized phrase, &quot;United We Stand,&quot; in hopes of being resilient and keeping the American spirit alive in the face of a devastating attack. The majority of the US population rallied behind President Bush and the federal government in widespread support to the recovery and the expectant reaction to the attacks. The highly visible role played by Rudy Giuliani, the Mayor of New York City, won him high praise nationally and in New York City. He was named Person of the Year by &quot;Time&quot; magazine for 2001, and at times had a higher profile in the US than President Bush.

Two major public reactions to the attacks were a surge of public expressions of patriotism not seen since World War II, marked most often by displays of the American flag; and an unprecedented level of respect, sympathy, and admiration for New York City and New Yorkers as a group by Americans in other parts of the United States. Some criticized this particular reaction, noting that not everyone who died was from New York City (for example, some of the passengers on the planes) and that the Arlington County, Virginia community also suffered in the attacks. Many people joined together to help the victims. Gratitude toward uniformed public-safety workers, and especially toward firefighters, was widely expressed in light of both the drama of the risks taken on the scene and the high death toll among the workers. Many people paid tribute to the police officers and firefighters who died during the attacks by wearing NYPD and FDNY hats. The number of casualties among the emergency service personnel was unprecedented.

Blood donations saw a surge in the weeks after 9/11. According to a report by the Journal of the American Medical Association, &quot;...the number of blood donations in the weeks after September 11, 2001, attacks was markedly greater than in the corresponding weeks of 2000 (2.5 times greater in the first week after the attacks; 1.3–1.4 times greater in the second to fourth weeks after the attack).&quot; At the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show that took place in New York in February 2002, a tribute was paid to the search and rescue dogs who not only assisted in locating survivors and bodies from the rubble but were also inside the World Trade Center buildings before they collapsed.

====Backlash and hate crimes====

In weeks following the attacks, there was a surge in incidents of harassment and hate crimes against South Asians, Middle Easterners, and anyone thought to be &quot;Middle Eastern-looking&quot; people—particularly Sikhs, because Sikh males usually wear turbans, which are stereotypically and erroneously associated with Muslims by many Americans. Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh man, was one of the first victims of this backlash; he was shot dead on September 15 at the gas station he owned in Mesa, Arizona. Mark Anthony Stroman, a white supremacist, killed two men and injured a third in a shooting spree beginning September 15 in Dallas, Texas. His victims, including Bangladeshi American Rais Bhuiyan, were all targeted because they looked &quot;of Muslim descent&quot;. His motive for the killings was revenge for the 9/11 attacks. In New York City itself, the only death possibly related to post-9/11 hate violence officially recorded as a homicide was Henryk Siwiak, a Polish immigrant shot in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn on September 11. His family theorized he may have been the victim of a hate crime in the wake of the attacks, since he was wearing camouflage clothing, had dark hair and spoke imperfect, heavily accented English. The case remains unsolved; police are open to the family&#x27;s theory but have not classified the killing as a bias crime.

In many cities there were reports of vandalism against mosques and other Islamic institutions, including some cases of arson. In the year after the attack, anti-Muslim hate crimes jumped 1,600 percent and this is further aggravated by a climate of prejudice that manifests in different ways. The FBI and other government agencies arrested and deported Arabs and Arab Americans in higher numbers after the attacks than before, often with limited or insufficient evidence to connect them to purported terrorism.

In the hopes of dissuading Islamophobic violence, President Bush delivered remarks at the Islamic Center of Washington on September 17 in which he distinguished between al-Qaeda and Islam writ large, affirming that &quot;Islam is peace&quot;; he also criticized Americans who would &quot;take out their anger&quot; about 9/11 against Muslim individuals, calling them &quot;the worst of humankind&quot;. Compared to the days immediately preceding Bush&#x27;s speech, there were fewer hate crimes against Muslims in the United States in the days after it. The Pew Research Center reported that in November 2001, 59% of Americans, relatively evenly distributed among both Republicans and Democrats, reported viewing Islam favorably, an increase in positive disposition compared to 45% that March. This shared outlook did not last, however, and over subsequent years views of Islam diverged along partisan lines as Republicans increasingly associated Islam with violence. 

== Long-term effects ==

===Effects on children===
The attacks were regarded by some as particularly disturbing to children, in part because of the frequency with which the images were replayed on television. Many schools closed early, especially those with children whose parents worked in Washington, D.C., and New York City. In Sarasota, Florida, Emma E. Booker Elementary School became a part of history, as President George W. Bush was reading to a classroom of children there when the attacks happened.

Psychological studies focused on children exposed to the attacks in Lower Manhattan and New York City found higher rates of clinically significant behavior problems among preschool children, as well as elevated rates of PTSD and depression in the years after the attacks. For children who lost a parent in the attack, psychologists noticed that while some coped well initially, they would at times succumb to bouts of depression and self-harm later in life, or become reluctant to discuss their family history.

===Health effects===

The thousands of tons of toxic debris resulting from the collapse of the Twin Towers contained more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens. Subsequent debilitating illnesses among rescue and recovery workers are said to be linked to exposure to these carcinogens. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality in the aftermath of the attacks, citing national security; however, the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.

Health effects also extended to residents, students, and office workers of Lower Manhattan and nearby Chinatown. Several deaths have been linked to the toxic dust, and the victims&#x27; names were included in the World Trade Center memorial. As of January 1, 2002, the New York Police Department had received 37 disability claims, and the Fire Department reported 269 disability claims related to injuries suffered as a result of the attacks. Approximately 18,000 people have been estimated to have developed illnesses as a result of the toxic dust. By 2004, nearly half of more than 1,000 screened rescue-and-recovery workers and volunteers reported new and persistent respiratory problems, and more than half reported persistent psychological symptoms. Because of the long latency period between exposure and development of asbestos-related diseases, exposed Manhattan residents, especially rescue-and-recovery workers, can suffer future adverse health effects. One such death related to health effects was the January 6, 2006, death of NYPD James Zadroga which was ruled by a New Jersey coroner as directly due to clean-up at the WTC site. This ruling was unequivocally rejected in October 2007 by the New York City Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Charles Hirsch, and Medical Examiner Michele Slone. On June 29, 2019, former New York Police Department detective Luis G. Alvarez died from colorectal cancer, with which he was diagnosed in 2016 and is believed to be caused from his three months spent at Ground Zero after 9/11.

There is also scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products in the air may have negative effects on fetal development. A notable children&#x27;s environmental health center is currently analyzing the children whose mothers were pregnant during the WTC collapse and were living or working nearby. A study of rescue workers released in April 2010 found that all those studied had impaired lung functions, and that 30–40% were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack.

==== Legal ====
Years after the attacks, legal disputes over the costs of illnesses related to the attacks were still in the court system. On October 17, 2006, a federal judge rejected New York City&#x27;s refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers, allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city. Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks. Christine Todd Whitman, administrator of the EPA in the aftermath of the attacks, was heavily criticized by a U.S. District Judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe. Mayor Giuliani was criticized for urging financial industry personnel to return quickly to the greater Wall Street area.

===Economic===

After the terrorist attack, various repercussions took place that affected the U.S as a whole. All the money and claims that were being put out to help aid the victims of the attack, as well as different security and laws to protect the U.S, caused several layoffs and unemployment. Specifically, It was said that 462 extended masses were layoffs because of the attacks that displaced approximately 130,000 employees. The unemployment rate inclined to a total of 5.0%.

The attacks caused an estimated overall economic loss to the city of $82.8 to 94.8 billion, with the lower number being consistent with the NYC Partnership&#x27;s November 2001 estimate and the high end being consistent with the New York City Comptroller&#x27;s October 2001 estimate. It was calculated that the lost human productive value, life insurance payouts were $2.63 billion, federal payments after offsets were estimated at $2.34 billion and charitable payments were $0.79 billion.

==== Lost artwork ====

It was projected by one individual that the public art that was damaged or destroyed during the attacks was valued at $10 million. Art by Louise Nevelson, Alexander Calder, and James Rosati were all destroyed along with a memorial sculpture by Elyn Zimmerman in memorial for the victims of the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing.

==== Insurance claims ====
As of August 2002, there were approximately 1,464 claims against the city of New York City that amounted to approximately $8.2 billion, although the New York City Law Department indicated at the time that the City&#x27;s liability for the claims would only be around $350 million, provided through an act of Congress. The claims ranged from City employee&#x27;s personal injuries that totaled around $5.2 billion, suffering due to the loss of life that totaled around $3 billion, and for the destruction of property such as the one filed by AEGIS Insurance Company for $250 million.

====Grants and funds====

Following the road to recovery, the federal government and state begin issuing grants and various funds to compensate and help those who suffered. The 9/11 Heroes Stamp Program was administered by the Department of Homeland Security which gave funds to those who became disabled from direct contact in the attack or suffered a loss from the attack. The Post- 9/11 GI Bill became a result after 9/11, paying homage to the U.S military soldiers, which provided educational and financial assistance to those soldiers who were returning to civilian life. Federal grant aid assisted states, communities, and local organizations in their efforts to stay safe and remain readily prepared. For that to happen the program law enforcement training and technical assistance grant was created hoping to stop or better compose for a terrorist attack.

The September 11th Victim Compensation fund (VCF) was established to provide financial assistance to those that experienced the disaster directly or those who lost family members from the attack. The fund has provided reimbursements for medical treatments for various conditions affecting victims, including PTSD and health effects from being exposed to toxic air.

==== Trade relations ====
The attacks affected trade relations with foreign countries, complicating the supply of oil demands. After the attack, oil prices skyrocketed.

=== New infrastructure ===

Rebuilding of the area began shortly after clean up, and construction began on the Freedom Tower and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.

==== Park51 ====
Park51 (originally named Cordoba House) is a planned 13-story Muslim community center to be located two blocks from the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan. The majority of the center will be open to the general public and its proponents have said the center will promote interfaith dialogue. It will contain a Muslim prayer space that has controversially been referred to as the &quot;Ground Zero mosque&quot;, though numerous commentators noted that it was neither a mosque nor at Ground Zero.

It would replace an existing 1850s Italianate-style building that was being used as a Burlington Coat Factory before it was damaged in the September 11 attacks. The proposed multi-faith aspects of the design include a 500-seat auditorium, theater, a performing arts center, a fitness center, a swimming pool, a basketball court, a childcare area, a bookstore, a culinary school, an art studio, a food court, and a memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks. The prayer space for the Muslim community will accommodate 1,000–2,000 people.

== Security and military actions ==
The evolution of security and protective services changed tremendously due to the attacks. Immediate changes included air travel policies, airport security and screening, and guidelines that must be obeyed before getting on board. Congress immediately responded after the terrorist attack by passing the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which applied to different types of transportation, not just air travel.

Additional screening was another main focus that took place during the period after the attacks, and many passengers were prescreened and advanced screened at different security checkpoints. This led to the major issue of racial profiling and invasion of privacy, as many Middle Eastern-looking people were singled out for further screening. Luggage screening was another main objective, as new technology was introduced to scan passengers&#x27; luggage thoroughly and search for weapons or bombs. In addition, some pilots were required by the Department of Homeland Security to carry a firearm on board. Better known as a Federal flight deck officer, these pilots undergo training to prevent terrorist attacks or other potential dangers on an airplane.

Another act was passed known as the USA Patriot Act, which broadened the powers of law enforcement to identify terrorist activity. For example, law enforcement was allowed able to break one&#x27;s premises without a search warrant and their consent, if they were suspected of terrorist activity. This also included roving wiretaps as a method of surveillance. For instance, the government was allowed to search through one&#x27;s record searches and intelligence searches. Specifically, if one searched terrorism activities or showed unusual behavior and then deleted their history, the government was able to see that. The purpose of this act was to catch acts of terrorism before any attacks were planned and executed. A program called Total Information Awareness was developed to enhance the technology that would collect and analyze information about every individual in the United States, and trace unusual behaviors that could help prevent terrorist activities. Information that was gathered through the program included internet activity, credit card purchase histories, airline ticket purchases, and medical records.

===Surveillance===
===9/11-related plots and attacks within the US (2001–2021)===

====Thwarted attacks====
* It was rumored that al-Qaeda planned to target the US Bank Tower (aka Library Tower) in Los Angeles and other buildings elsewhere in the US in an alleged second wave of aircraft hijackings to be carried out in the spring or summer of 2002. However, terrorism researchers and counter-terrorism experts have disputed this, expressing doubts about the legitimacy of the supposed plot.
* 2001 shoe bomb plot in which London-born Richard Reid carried shoes that were packed with two types of explosives onboard a transatlantic American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami.
* 2003 plot by former FBI agent Iyman Faris to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City
* 2004 Financial buildings plot which targeted the International Monetary Fund and World Bank buildings in Washington, DC, the New York Stock Exchange and other financial institutions was stopped in the early stages. The conspirators were said to have &quot;had no funding, vehicles or bomb-making equipment.&quot;
* 2004 Columbus Shopping Mall Bombing Plot
* 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot which was to involve liquid explosives
* 2006 Sears Tower plot
* 2007 Fort Dix attack plot
* 2007 John F. Kennedy International Airport attack plot
* 2009 Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in which a passenger tried to set off plastic explosives sewn to his underwear
* 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt
* 2011 Spokane bombing attempt
* 2015 Curtis Culwell Center attack

====Successful attacks with at least 10 fatalities====
* 2009 Fort Hood shooting – 14 people were killed and 33 others were injured, including the perpetrator.
* 2015 San Bernardino attack – 16 people were killed, including both perpetrators, and 24 others were injured.
* 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting – 50 people were killed, including the perpetrator, and 58 others were injured.

Bombings in Kabul, Afghanistan occurred after the attacks and were reposted live by CNN correspondent Nic Robertson less than 24 hours after the attacks in America.

==International==
The attacks had major worldwide political effects. Many other countries introduced tough anti-terrorism legislation and took action to cut off terrorist finances, including the freezing of bank accounts suspected of being used to fund terrorism. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies stepped up cooperation to arrest terrorist suspects and break up suspected terrorist cells around the world.

Reaction to the attacks in the Muslim world was mixed. Also, shortly after the attack, the media picked up on several celebrations of the attacks in the Middle East with images of these celebrations being broadcast on television and published in print. Less publicized were public displays of sympathy, including candlelight vigils in countries like Iran.

In the immediate aftermath, support for the United States&#x27; right to defend itself was expressed across the world, and by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368. The Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, was in Washington D.C. at the time of the attacks and invoked the ANZUS military alliance as a pledge of Australian assistance to the U.S.

=== Aid ===
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks many United States–based airports would not accept airplane flights to land, causing Operation Yellow Ribbon in which all incoming international flights were rerouted by the FAA to airports in Canada. Many Canadians opened up their homes to stranded travelers and organizations such as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals gave comfort to animals and other special groups that were stranded by the diversions.

In France, calls to the United States Embassy were placed by locals who offered rooms within their homes to stranded passengers and observed the official day of mourning with three minutes of silence and stillness.

=== Memorials and vigils ===
The attack prompted numerous memorials and services all over the world with many countries, along with the United States, declaring a national day of mourning. In Berlin, 200,000 Germans marched to show their solidarity with America. The French newspaper of record, &quot;Le Monde&quot;, ran a front-page headline reading &quot;Nous sommes Tous Américains&quot;, or &quot;We are all Americans&quot;. In London, the US national anthem was played at the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace. In the UK, national anthems are typically only played for official state visits. To mark the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, New York City lit the Empire State Building in purple and gold, to say &quot;thank you&quot; for this action.

===Hate crimes===
Hate crimes against Muslims increased around the world. For example, Canada experienced a 16-fold increase in anti-Muslim attacks immediately a year after 9/11. In the year leading to the attack, there were only 11 reported crimes but a year following 9/11, there were 173 hate crime cases reported. The same also happened in the United Kingdom and Australia. In the latter&#x27;s case, a study conducted in Sydney and Melbourne revealed an overwhelming majority of Muslim residents who experienced racism or racist violence since the attack. Another study claimed that hate crimes &quot;increased for all Muslims after 9/11, although the relative risk was much higher for those individuals living in countries with smaller Muslim populations.&quot;

An increase in racial tensions was seen in countries such as England, with a number of violent crimes linked to the September 11th attacks. The most severe example was seen in Peterborough, where teenager Ross Parker was murdered by a gang of up to ten Muslims of Pakistani background who had sought a white male to attack.

<doc id="171763" wikidata="Q332526" url="?curid=171763" title="Steal This Album!">
<text>Steal This Album! is the third studio album by the American nu metal band System of a Down, released on November 26, 2002, by American Recordings and Columbia Records. Produced by Rick Rubin and Daron Malakian, it peaked at number 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. 

==Background==
In early 2002, medium-quality MP3s of the album were released on the internet under the name &quot;Toxicity II&quot;. The band issued a statement expressing disappointment that fans were hearing material that was unfinished, and they worked to release a completed, better quality version of the album, which became &quot;Steal This Album!&quot;.

Though often reported in the media as being a collection of B-sides and outtakes, the band insisted that the &quot;Steal This Album!&quot; material is of the same quality as the tracks which made it onto &quot;Toxicity&quot;. Vocalist Serj Tankian has said that the songs were left out of &quot;Toxicity&quot; &quot;because they did not fit the overall continuity of the album&quot;. In May 2009, drummer John Dolmayan revealed that the album is his favorite System of a Down release. Similarly, Tankian also called the album his favorite System of a Down album in a 2012 AMA on reddit.

A first version of &quot;Streamline&quot; was used in &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; soundtrack, which was released in early 2002, and as a B-side on the CD2 edition of &quot;Aerials&quot;.

Multi-instrumentalist Arto Tunçboyacıyan sings on the song &quot;Bubbles&quot;, making his third appearance with System of a Down (having appeared on two songs on &quot;Toxicity&quot;). 

Commenting on the track &quot;I-E-A-I-A-I-O&quot;, drummer John Dolmayan said it was inspired by an encounter he had with actor David Hasselhoff in a liquor store in Los Angeles when he was around 12:

==Critical reception==
The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics scoring 77 out of 100 on aggregate website &quot;Metacritic&quot;. Giving the album 4 stars out of 5 in his review for &quot;AllMusic&quot; Chris True noted &quot;If System proved anything with 2001&#x27;s &quot;Toxicity&quot;, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re one of the few breaths of fresh air out there in mainstream metal land. This collection is no different, and with its amazing pacing, it&#x27;s hard to not be moved by what this band can do&quot;. &quot;Steal This Album stands head-and-tattooed shoulders above its competition in the hard-rock genre&quot; said &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in a mutually glowing review, awarding the album a B+ rating.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Steal This Album&quot; &quot;An absurdist blast of political rage, silly theater and shattered math metal.&quot; Jeremy Gladstone of &quot;Kludge&quot; gave the album a score of 7 out of 10 in his review and both praised and criticized the album writing &quot;Love them or hate them, System is here to stay. The writing is consistent and the music is as tight as we have been accustomed to, perhaps a degree more so at times on the album. Steal This Album is guaranteed to satisfy every System of a Down fan listening. However, from song eight to twelve on the album, the material is a little too similar to really stand out compared to the more intense tracks. Unreleased material can sometimes be good, and sometimes it still doesn&#x27;t work out&quot;.

Victoria Segal, writing for &quot;NME&quot;, gave &quot;Steal This Album!&quot; 3.5 stars out of 5 in a less flattering review, stating &quot;System Of A Down&#x27;s concerns may be no laughing matter, but unfortunately, their music often is. Guitarist Daron Malakian describes this record as &#x27;a bridge between &quot;Toxicity&quot; and our next record,&#x27; which only indicates troubled waters ahead&quot;. She did however end her review with &quot;Yes, System Of A Down are insane, ridiculous, a brain-pan pizza with extra mushrooms. But how can something this righteous ever be wrong?&quot;

<doc id="171764" wikidata="Q220348" url="?curid=171764" title="System of a Down (album)">
<text>System of a Down is the debut studio album by the Armenian-American heavy metal band System of a Down, released on June 30, 1998, by American Recordings and Columbia Records. The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in February 2000. After the success of the band&#x27;s following album, &quot;Toxicity&quot; (2001), &quot;System of a Down&quot; was certified platinum and has since gone double platinum.

==Composition==

The album is generally considered nu metal and alternative metal, both of which would become staples for the band. Lyrical themes throughout the album vary, with many songs following a theme of being anti-war, but also has topics of genocide, religion, and brainwashing. &quot;Suite-Pee&quot; is a criticism of pedophilia within the Catholic Church and religious extremism. &quot;Soil&quot; is, according to guitarist Daron Malakian at a Lowlands show, &quot;about death, and friends that die, and life that dies&quot;. &quot;Mind&quot; talks about government mind control, specifically mentioning CIA brainwashing in the album&#x27;s liner notes. &quot;P.L.U.C.K.&quot; is a song dedicated to the victims of the Armenian genocide, and is meant to be a criticism and denouncing of the Turkish Government.

==Artwork==
The cover artwork is from a 1928 anti-fascist poster designed by visual artist John Heartfield for the Communist Party of Germany. The text on the original poster is: &quot;A hand has 5 fingers! With these 5 grab the enemy!&quot; This slogan inspired part of the text contained on the back of the album: &quot;The hand has five fingers, capable and powerful, with the ability to destroy as well as create&quot;. Later, it is written in bold letters: &quot;Open your eyes, open your mouths, close your hands and make a fist&quot; (used later by Serj Tankian in the song &quot;Uneducated Democracy&quot;). The artwork also bears a close resemblance to the cover of George Harrison&#x27;s album &quot;Living in the Material World&quot;. 

==Reception==

&quot;System of a Down&quot; received acclaim from music critics. &quot;Q&quot; called it &quot;an excellent starting point for this most curious band&quot;.

The album is featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; included the album in its list of &quot;The Best Metal Debut Albums&quot;, at number 22.

<text>Arriva Ltd. is a British multinational public transport company headquartered in Sunderland, England.

The company was originally established on 24 October 1938 as T Cowie Ltd. Initially focused on the sale of motorcycles, it relaunched shortly after the Second World War by Tom Cowie. During December 1964, the company was floated, it acquired its first car dealership months later. In 1972, the company established Cowie Contract Hire, a successful contract hire business. T. Cowie entered into bus operations via the purchase of the London-based Grey-Green operator in 1980. During 1984, it acquired the Hanger Group along with the vehicle leasing business Interleasing. In April 1994, the company was renamed Cowie Group. Months later, Cowie Group acquired the Leaside Buses and South London Transport business units amid the wider privatisation of London bus services. During 1997, it also bought the Denmark-based operator Unibus, becoming its first venture based outside the United Kingdom.

During November 1997, the company was rebranded as Arriva. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, it disposed of its vehicle-hire and motor-retailing businesses. In February 2000, Arriva purchased MTL Holdings, which included its first UK rail franchises, Merseyrail Electrics and Northern Spirit. In April 2008, the LNWR train maintenance business was acquired. Arriva became a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn in August 2010. Arriva operates bus, coach, train, tram and waterbus services in 10 countries across Europe. As of November 2023, it employed 35,500 people and operated 1.5 billion passenger journeys annually. It operates as three divisions: UK Bus, UK Rail and Mainland Europe. Deutsche Bahn announced in 2019 that it wished to sell Arriva, but such a sale was placed on hold as of November in that year. During the early 2020s, several of Arriva&#x27;s continental European operations have been sold on. In October 2023, Deutsche Bahn agreed terms to sell Arriva to I Squared Capital with the transaction completed in June 2024.
==History==


The company was founded by TSK Cowie in Sunderland in 1938. It was initially active as a second-hand motorcycle dealer and traded under the name T. Cowie Limited. During 1948, the business was re-launched by Tom Cowie, the founder&#x27;s son, still selling motorcycles. T Cowie plc was floated in December 1964, and in 1965 it bought out the first of many car dealerships.

In 1972, it formed Cowie Contract Hire, which became the largest contract hire business in the UK. During 1980, T. Cowie made its first foray into bus operations, buying the Grey-Green operation in London from the George Ewer Group. In 1984, T. Cowie p.l.c. acquired the Hanger Group, which included Interleasing, a large vehicle leasing business. Further leasing companies acquired were Marley Leasing, RoyScot Drive and Ringway Leasing. Following the retirement of Tom Cowie, the company was renamed Cowie Group plc during April 1994.

As part of the privatisation of London bus services, Cowie Group acquired the Leaside Buses and South London Transport business units in September 1994 and January 1995 respectively. Cowie Group also bought United Automobile Services and British Bus in July and August 1996, both of which had acquired a number of privatised bus companies. As a result of these transactions, in October 1996, Cowie Group was reclassified on the stock exchange from a motor dealer to a transport group.

In November 1997, the company was rebranded as Arriva p.lc. That same year, it also bought Unibus in Denmark, its first venture outside the United Kingdom.

During June 1999, Arriva sold its vehicle-hire business to General Motors. In February 2000, Arriva purchased MTL Holdings, which included its first UK rail franchises, Merseyrail Electrics and Northern Spirit. Between 2002 and 2003, Arriva sold its motor-retailing businesses, furthermore, in February 2006, it also disposed of its vehicle-rental business to Northgate. During April 2008, the LNWR train maintenance business in England was acquired.

In 2010, it was reported that the government-owned railway companies of France (SNCF) and Germany (Deutsche Bahn) were considering making takeover bids for the business. SNCF subsidiary Keolis and Arriva entered discussions regarding a merger, however, in April 2010, Deutsche Bahn made a takeover offer for Arriva valued at £7.75 per share (£1.585 billion). During August 2010, Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s takeover bid was approved by the European Commission, albeit conditional on the disposal of some Arriva services in Germany. The takeover took effect on 27 August 2010, and Arriva was delisted from the London Stock Exchange on 31 August 2010.

In late 2011, Arriva acquired Grand Central and sold its Arriva Scotland West bus operation. In May 2013, Arriva purchased Veolia Transport&#x27;s Central European business with 3,400 vehicles. Arriva changed its logo in January 2018.

In March 2019, DB announced that it would be selling Arriva through either a sale or possible public flotation and invited companies interested in acquiring it to register expressions of interest by 3 May; however, by mid-November, the sale had been reportedly placed on hold. In early 2023, reports again alleged that parent company Deutsche Bahn was considering options for spinning out Arriva to concentrate on its core German rail operations. During the following months, various portions of Arriva&#x27;s operations on continental Europe have been sold to other companies, these disposals have largely focused on busin operations. In October 2023, Deutsche Bahn agreed terms to sell Arriva to I Squared Capital. The sale was completed in June 2024.

==Current operations==
===Croatia===
====Bus====
In May 2013, Arriva entered the Croatian bus market with the purchase of Panturist Veolia Osijek (Veolia Transport Central Europe) with 120 buses. In August 2017 Arriva took a 78.34% share in Autotrans Group (ATG); via this move, it became the number one private bus operator active in Croatia.

===Czech Republic===
Arriva group bought three medium-sized bus transport companies (Transcentrum Bus s.r.o., Bosák Bus s.r.o. and Osnado s.r.o.) in 2006 and 2007 end established its own rail transport company Arriva vlaky s.r.o. in 2009. These four companies are owned through Arriva holding Česká republika s.r.o. which is owned by the Dutch company Arriva Coöperatie W.A. (majority of 99.9% since 2008).

In July 2013, the current Veolia Transport Česká republika a.s. with its four subsidiary companies fell under Arriva group as Arriva Transport Česká republika a.s. The daughter companies were simultaneously renamed and rebranded as Arriva Praha s.r.o., Arriva Teplice s.r.o., Arriva Vychodni Cechy a.s. and Arriva Morava a.s. They operate primarily buses (it is the biggest bus transport operator in the Czech Republic) but also trolleybuses in Teplice (Arriva Teplice) and Desná Railway (Arriva Morava).

The two Arriva holdings in the Czech Republic have not any direct interconnection yet. Moreover, the Arriva group operated in the Czech Republic also through the German rail transport company Vogtlandbahn GmbH. The former Abellio companies Probo Bus and PT Real, purchased in December 2013, are owned by DB Czech Holding s.r.o. which is owned by German DB Mobility Logistics AG.

In November 2007, Arriva acquired Osnado, which operates bus and coach services in the north of Hradec Králové Region in East Bohemia, in the foothills of the Giant Mountains. The three bus companies retain their original names but with the Arriva corporate logo and livery.

Since December 2010, Vogtlandbahn operates under its own name the line Trilex (Liberec – Zittau – Varnsdorf – Rybniště/Seifhennersdorf). After Arriva was bought by Deutsche Bahn in 2010, Vogtlandbahn was resold to the Italian state railways Ferrovie dello Stato together with Luxembourg infrastructure fund Cube.

Between September 2013 and December 2013, Arriva vlaky tried operating a commercial service from Praha Masarykovo nádraží to Kralupy nad Vltavou in competition with subsidised lines of České dráhy. The company did not succeed with its effort to gain a subsidy for it to continue.

Four trains on the local Desná Railway, operated by Connex Morava (lately Veolia Transport Morava) since 2002, were taken over by Arriva Morava in July 2013.

During 1999, Arriva established NoordNed as a joint venture company with the Dutch state-owned passenger rail company Nederlandse Spoorwegen. In 2003, the company took full ownership of the former joint venture, opting to drop the NoordNed branding two years later. During 2005, Arriva was awarded a 15-year contract to operate trains from Groningen to Leeuwarden, Delfzijl, Roodeschool and Nieuweschans.

In 2012, Arriva commenced operating trains in the Achterhoek and between Zwolle and Emmen; these services operate under the Spurt brand.

On 21 June 2013, Arriva was selected to operate a new service between The Hague and Brussels. Service was set to start in December 2015, but the project was cancelled in 2014 because the involved parties could not agree upon a final business case and because NS reactivated the original service to Brussels, which made the new Arriva service unnecessary.

During December 2016, Arriva acquired the majority of Limburg&#x27;s bus and train systems.

In June 2024, a train of Arriva has been extended from Maastricht to Liège-Guillemins in cooperation with the National Railway Company of Belgium to replace the existing service there. The resulting Three Countries Train runs from Liège-Guillemins to Aachen Hbf.

===United Kingdom===
====Bus and coach====

Arriva operates 5,900 buses in London, the north east, north west and south east of England, Yorkshire, the Midlands, Wales and previously Scotland.

====Patient transport====
Arriva Transport Solutions provides non-emergency ambulance services, typically to convey disabled patients to and from hospital out-patient appointments. These services, formerly provided by ambulance services, are now awarded by competitive tender. The company has been running these services in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and Rutland since 2012. A report by the Care Quality Commission in 2014 said that patients were &quot;often&quot; arriving late for appointments, and taxi drivers with &quot;poor attitudes&quot; being used when other resources were unavailable.

Following its successful bid over the rival North West ambulance service for non–emergency transport, in Greater Manchester Arriva admitted it had submitted incorrect performance figures which had earned it a £1.5m bonus. Arriva had been the subject of many complaints about its service. Comparisons were drawn with misreporting in the UK Serco scandal and MPs said the Serious Fraud Office may need to be involved.

====Train====
Arriva has operated a number of rail franchises in the UK since the privatisation of British Rail in 1996, through its subsidiary, Arriva UK Trains. It gained its first franchises in February 2000. Arriva UK Trains currently runs a number of train operating companies:
* Arriva Rail London: operates London Overground, concession runs until May 2026
* Chiltern Railways: operates services on the Chiltern Main Line, franchise runs until December 2027
* CrossCountry: operates long-distance cross-country routes, franchise runs until 15 October 2027
* Grand Central: open-access operator with services on the East Coast Main Line purchased in November 2011
Arriva TrainCare (previously LNWR) operates train maintenance depots at Bristol, Cambridge, Crewe, Eastleigh and Newcastle.

Following the purchase of Arriva by Deutsche Bahn in August 2010, Arriva UK Trains expanded to take over Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s existing DB Regio UK division which consisted of Chiltern Railways, Tyne &amp; Wear Metro and London Overground Rail Operations.

Arriva UK Trains wishes to expand the number of UK Rail businesses it operates by developing open access operations and successfully bidding for further Department for Transport rail franchises. Alliance Rail Holdings continues to develop new open access proposals following the rejection of its initial plans by the Office of Rail Regulation in 2011.

Between 2011 and 2012, Arriva&#x27;s applications to bid for the InterCity West Coast, Greater Anglia, Essex Thameside and Thameslink franchises were all rejected by the Department for Transport. Following this run of failure Arriva was publicly critical of the government&#x27;s prequalification process and called for it to be abolished. However, Arriva was subsequently shortlisted for the Greater Western, Crossrail, Caledonian Sleeper and ScotRail franchises.

Ten hybrid Optare Solos and two Bluebird mini-buses for use in the city of Valletta were also purchased. An assortment of the newest buses from the former owner/driver pre-July 2011 operation were also acquired and refurbished to bring them broadly into line with the rest of the fleet. This included the fitting of air conditioning and CCTV equipment and rebranding into standard Arriva livery for daily use alongside the main fleet. These included buses built by SCARNIF, MCV, BMC, King Long and Saracakis among others, with the main common factor being that they are all fully automatic and low floor designs.

Arriva has been harshly criticised both by commuters and by the government agency Transport Malta for consistently failing to keep up standards. On 14 November 2012, Arriva was harshly reprimanded by Transport Malta and given until the end of the month to bring up all its routes to 100% efficiency before TM deploys its own shuttles at Arriva&#x27;s expense.

In August 2013, the Government of Malta instructed Arriva Malta to remove the articulated buses from service, pending investigation following three major fire outbreaks in the span of 48 hours. The fires destroyed the buses and in one case caused extensive damage to some nearby vehicles belonging to MaltaPost, the country&#x27;s postal operator. Nobody was injured in these incidents. Like in the UK when the same buses had caught fire, these buses became a popular joke in conversations and social media sites.

By the end of December 2013, Arriva had reportedly run up losses of €50 million in two and a half years.

On 1 January 2014, Arriva ceased operations in Malta, with the services nationalised by the Maltese government as Malta Public Transport. Upon being tendered, the services were taken over by ALSA.

===Sweden===
Arriva operated in Sweden until 2022, when it sold its Swedish operations to the Finnish state-owned VR Group, and was rebranded as VR Sverige.

====Bus====

In Ekerö Municipality, traffic started on 1 March 2009 however Arriva won this contract again in 2019. The E32 contract which was procured in 2019 had three contesters Arriva who came on first place, Nobina who came on second place and Transdev who came on third place. In August 2012, Arriva began operation in western Stockholm with 255 buses under a 12-year contract with the regional transport authority. In January 2013 a further 229 buses were added.
When Arriva took over the Roslagen Light Rail and bus traffic in the Roslagen area of Stockholm, there was total chaos. Arriva&#x27;s failure to follow the contract resulted in a fine of 174 million kronor.

Arriva operated services in the Halland Region from June 2010, partly taking over services from Swebus. In July 2022, Arriva sold all of its Swedish bus operations to VR Group with 800 buses.

==Branding==

Prior to being rebranded as Arriva in November 1997, the Cowie fleets generally were still trading under their pre-privatisation names with individual liveries. As part of the rebranding the operations were renamed as Arriva Derby, Arriva Fox County etc.

A uniform livery of aquamarine (pantone 321) with a cream coloured semicircle at the front with a yellow skirt and signwriting was adopted. This livery was adopted by most by Arriva&#x27;s European acquisitions as well as Arriva Trains Northern and Arriva Trains Wales. The same livery was applied to the Arriva London fleet albeit with red in lieu of aquamarine to comply with a Transport for London requirement for buses to be 80% red. London vehicles are now painted all-over red to comply with Transport for London&#x27;s amended requirements.

In the mid-2000s, an aquamarine livery with less cream, a dark blue skirt and yellow stripe was adopted for some longer distance services in the United Kingdom. The first buses to carry this new style were 3 Northern Counties Palatine II DAF DB250s based at the Arriva Southern Counties Gillingham garage for routes 700/701 between Medway Towns and Bluewater. Dubbed the interurban livery, in September 2009 it was decided to adopt this livery as standard for all UK buses. Most European operations retain the old livery, although some Czech buses have also received it. In December 2008 Arriva Trains Wales unveiled a dark blue livery on its Mark 2 carriages, this has since been adopted as its standard livery.

Exceptions to standard livery include:
* Arriva Denmark – Yellow and blue (following Sydttrafik, Midttrafik, Nordjyllands Trafikselskab and some local train companies as well and Movias own colour schemes)
* Arriva London – red livery specified by Transport for London
* Arriva Mobility Solutions (Slovakia) – red livery according to IDS BK specifications
* Arriva Rail London – white, orange &amp; blue livery specified by Transport for London
* Arriva Rail North – white &amp; blue livery specified by Department for Transport
* Arriva Stockholm – Red and blue specified by SL
* Chiltern Railways – existing white &amp; blue livery retained, superseded in 2013 by a white &amp; silver livery
* CrossCountry – maroon, grey &amp; pink
* Grand Central – existing black &amp; orange livery retained
* Green Line Coaches – light &amp; dark green
* Glasgow Flyer – white, green &amp; black
* New Enterprise Coaches – white with red logos
* Spurt – red and white
* VT-Arriva, Hungary – light blue
* Wardle Transport – Arriva livery but with red in lieu of aquamarine
* Yorkshire Tiger – Yorkshire Tiger branded vehicles are mainly orange with the exception of Tiger Blue and Flying Tiger which are blue
* Transportes Sul do Tejo – TST vehicles are mainly white with some having yellow and blue stripes, others only blue stripes and the Sulfertagus service having a red transition to blue on a mainly white livery.

<doc id="171768" wikidata="Q247949" url="?curid=171768" title="Bush (British band)">
<text>Bush are a British rock band formed in London in 1992. Their current lineup consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Gavin Rossdale, lead guitarist Chris Traynor, bassist Corey Britz, and drummer Nik Hughes.

In 1994, Bush found immediate success outside the UK with the release of their debut album, &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot;, which is certified six times multi-platinum by the RIAA. They went on to become one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1990s, selling over ten million records in the United States and 20 million records worldwide.

Despite their success in the US (especially in the mid-1990s), the band were considerably less popular in their home country and they have enjoyed only marginal success there.

Bush have had numerous top ten singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; rock charts and one No. 1 album with &quot;Razorblade Suitcase&quot; in 1996. The band broke up in 2002 but reformed in 2010, and have released five albums since then: &quot;The Sea of Memories&quot; (2011), &quot;Man on the Run&quot; (2014), &quot;Black and White Rainbows&quot; (2017), &quot;The Kingdom&quot; (2020), and &quot;The Art of Survival&quot; (2022).

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; (1992–1995)===
After leaving his band Midnight, Gavin Rossdale met former King Blank guitarist Nigel Pulsford at a Wembley performance by Baby Animals opening for Bryan Adams in November 1991. The two musicians became friends over a shared appreciation for several artists, including Big Black, The Fall, Pixies, and The Velvet Underground. They formed a new band which they called Future Primitive. Describing the early sound of the group, one British record label executive said years later, &quot;They weren&#x27;t what they are today – they were a little like the more commercial side of INXS&quot;. To complete the lineup, the pair recruited bassist Dave Parsons, and drummer Robin Goodridge joined in mid-1993 shortly before Bush were signed. While still known as Future Primitive, the band released the song &quot;Bomb&quot;, later to be featured on the band&#x27;s debut, as a single through Rossdale&#x27;s own Mad Dog Winston Records. Rossdale&#x27;s goal was for Bush to sign with 4AD because of his love for their bands Cocteau Twins, Pixies and Throwing Muses.

In 1993, the band was signed by Rob Kahane, who had a distribution deal with Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Records. The band completed recording its debut album &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; in early 1994. However, the death of Disney executive Frank G. Wells eliminated a supporter for Kahane, and executives at Hollywood deemed Bush&#x27;s album unacceptable for release. Consequently, the bandmates took jobs performing menial labour. Interscope Records ultimately decided to release the album, and at the end of 1994, Kahane sent an advance copy of the album to a friend at influential Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM, which added the song &quot;Everything Zen&quot; to its rotation.

On the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts (North America), &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; peaked at No. 4 on the Heatseekers and &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts. The album spawned two Top 40 singles. After about six months of promotion for &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot;, the album began to sell well, once &quot;Comedown&quot; and &quot;Glycerine&quot; struck America. Additionally, &quot;Little Things&quot; and &quot;Machinehead&quot; both charted well in North America.

In Canada, the band were initially forced to release &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; under the name BushX, as the 1970s Canadian band Bush still held the rights to the name &quot;Bush&quot; in the Canadian market. The dispute arose after the British band&#x27;s lawyers threatened to intervene to prevent the Canadian band from reissuing its 1970 album, although it was entirely between the bands&#x27; lawyers as Rossdale and Domenic Troiano, the leader of the Canadian band, both expressed a willingness to negotiate a solution. In 1997, after the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Razorblade Suitcase&quot; also bore the X, Rossdale and Troiano directly negotiated an agreement under which the British band were allowed to drop the X in exchange for donating $20,000 each to the Starlight Foundation and the Canadian Music Therapy Trust Fund. Both &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; and &quot;Razorblade Suitcase&quot; were then reissued without the X.

===&quot;Razorblade Suitcase&quot; (1996–1998)===
In late 1996 Bush released the first single &quot;Swallowed&quot; from their second album titled &quot;Razorblade Suitcase.&quot; The song spent seven weeks on top of the Modern Rock Tracks chart. This was followed by single &quot;Greedy Fly&quot;. The album hit number 1 in America and placed high in many European countries. &quot;Razorblade Suitcase&quot; featured American recording engineer Steve Albini, a move which was viewed negatively by critics. Albini had worked with Nirvana on their final studio album, &quot;In Utero&quot;, three years before. Bush later released the remix album &quot;Deconstructed&quot;. The album saw Bush re-arranging their songs into dance and techno stylings. The album went platinum less than a year after release.

===&quot;The Science of Things&quot; (1999–2000)===
Following the completion of touring, Rossdale went into seclusion in Ireland, where he worked on material for the group&#x27;s next album, periodically sending demo tapes of his works in progress to his bandmates. The group finally convened to record in London in August 1998, where the band reteamed with &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley.

The release of &quot;The Science of Things&quot; was stymied by a court battle between the band and Trauma Records. The case was settled in early 1999 and the album was finally released that October. &quot;The Science of Things&quot; was a major departure in several forms from Bush&#x27;s first two albums. Like the multi-platinum successes of Bush&#x27;s first two albums, this album also reached platinum status. Also, while the band&#x27;s previous albums were strongly influenced by grunge, &quot;The Science of Things&quot; featured some electronic music influences in addition to the sound defined by Bush&#x27;s earlier work. For example, although lead single &quot;The Chemicals Between Us&quot; had a prominent guitar riff, it also had many electronic elements usually found in dance music. Although the album had a few hit songs, it failed to chart in the top 10.

The band&#x27;s performance at Woodstock &#x27;99, however, helped &quot;The Science of Things&quot; achieve platinum status despite its slow start. Three singles were released from &quot;The Science of Things&quot;, most notably &quot;The Chemicals Between Us&quot;, which spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks and peaked at No. 67 on the US Hot 100. &quot;Warm Machine&quot; was the second single released. &quot;Letting the Cables Sleep&quot;, the third single, reached No. 4 on the Modern Rock Tracks and also received considerable airplay, and appeared in an episode of the medical drama series &quot;ER&quot;.

===&quot;Golden State&quot; and breakup (2001–2002)===
In October 2001, now on the Atlantic Records record label, Bush released its next album, &quot;Golden State&quot;. While the album attempted to return to the simple, catchy sound of the band&#x27;s debut, it failed to achieve the same commercial success as the band&#x27;s previous releases. Several singles were released, most notably the hit &quot;The People That We Love (Speed Kills)&quot;, but none were mainstream successes. The album was the band&#x27;s least successful, selling only 380,000 copies in the US. &quot;The People That We Love (Speed Kills)&quot; was used in the game &quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2&quot;. In January 2002, Pulsford retired after the release of &quot;Golden State&quot; to spend more time with his family. Chris Traynor filled in for him for the subsequent tour, which would turn out to be Bush&#x27;s last for eight years. Due to declining record sales and a lack of support from Atlantic Records, Bush disbanded in 2002. In 2005, a greatest hits album called &quot;The Best of &#x27;94–&#x27;99&quot; and a live album called &quot;Zen X Four&quot; were released.

===Post-breakup (2003–2010)===

Gavin Rossdale formed a new band, Institute, in 2004, serving as their lead vocalist and guitarist, just as in Bush. Chris Traynor also joined the band, as lead guitarist. In addition to playing in Institute, Traynor also joined the reunited metal band Helmet in 2004 on bass; he quit the band in 2006. Institute released one album, &quot;Distort Yourself&quot;, but failed to achieve much commercial success in spite of opening for U2&#x27;s Vertigo Tour at some shows. Institute broke up in 2006 and Rossdale then embarked on a solo career. In 2007, he covered the John Lennon song &quot;Mind Games&quot; for the Lennon tribute album &quot;Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur&quot;. His first solo album, &quot;Wanderlust&quot;, supported by leading single &quot;Love Remains the Same&quot;, was released in June 2008. Rossdale also ventured into acting, appearing in the films &quot;Zoolander&quot;, &quot;Little Black Book&quot;, &quot;The Game of Their Lives&quot;, &quot;Constantine&quot;, &quot;How to Rob a Bank&quot; and others.

Robin Goodridge recorded with the British rock band Elyss in 2004, although they have not released any new material since. In 2006, Goodridge began drumming for indie rock band Spear of Destiny, and appeared on their 2007 album, &quot;Imperial Prototype&quot;. During the summer of 2008, he toured the UK with British rock band Stone Gods after their current drummer Ed Graham reportedly fell ill. On 29 July it was announced that Graham had left the band and on 6 October 2008, the band&#x27;s website announced that Goodridge had joined the band. Nigel Pulsford spent most of his time since leaving Bush raising his children with his wife. In an interview with Blender, Gavin Rossdale admitted that the likelihood of a Bush reunion was &quot;very high&quot;. He then added &quot;quite high&quot;. In a November 2008 interview, Rossdale revealed that he had tried to contact the other members of Bush, &quot;I reached out to them&quot;.

===Reunion and &quot;The Sea of Memories&quot; (2010–2013)===
On 22 June 2010, it was announced that Bush would play their first show in eight years at the second-annual Epicenter Music Festival in Fontana, California on 25 September 2010. A new album, then-titled &quot;Everything Always Now&quot;, was also announced as well as a new single &quot;Afterlife&quot;. Founding members Nigel Pulsford and Dave Parsons both decided not to rejoin the band.

Pulsford&#x27;s and Parsons&#x27; successors were previous touring member Chris Traynor and Corey Britz, former bassist for The Calling, respectively. The new line-up played seven shows in 2010, performing songs from Bush&#x27;s previous four albums as well as a new song, &quot;Afterlife&quot;.

Gavin announced on radio that their new album had been named &quot;The Sea of Memories&quot; and was released in September and managed to peak at No. 18 on the &quot;Billboard Top 200&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Sound of Winter&quot; was released in July 2011 and reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart. On 19 November 2011, Bush performed a live set for &quot;Guitar Center Sessions&quot; on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host, Nic Harcourt. Their song &quot;Into The Blue&quot; was featured on The Avengers soundtrack album released on 1 May 2012. They toured with Nickelback on their Here and Now Tour.

===&quot;Man on the Run&quot; (2014–2016)===

On 26 March 2014, it was reported that Bush had begun recording their sixth studio album with producer Nick Raskulinecz. Gavin Rossdale announced on 18 August 2014 that the new album, &quot;Man on the Run&quot;, was available for pre-order in both digital and deluxe edition CD form. A day later, the band revealed that the lead single from the album would be &quot;The Only Way Out&quot;. In November 2014 the band announced tour dates for the early months of 2015 beginning on 30 January. In June 2016, Bush released a music video for the new song &quot;People At War&quot;.

===&quot;Black and White Rainbows&quot; (2017–2019)===
In January 2017, it was reported that Bush had mastered and completed work on their seventh studio album. On 6 February 2017, the band announced the title, release date of 10 March 2017, and track listing for their seventh studio album, &quot;Black and White Rainbows&quot;. The lead single from the album, &quot;Mad Love&quot;, was released the same day.

On 2 April 2018 a tour of the United States of America, called &quot;Revolution 3 Tour,&quot; was announced for the summer. They performed as co-headliners with Stone Temple Pilots and The Cult.

Rossdale also revealed that he was working on some material called &quot;heavier&quot; than the recent productions in anticipation of a forthcoming band album.

===&quot;The Kingdom&quot; (2019–2022)===
In May 2019, Bush set &quot;The Mind Plays Tricks on You&quot; as the title of their new studio album, tentatively due in early 2020.

Drummer Robin Goodridge departed from the band in 2019. With Goodridge&#x27;s departure, Rossdale became the only original member of Bush remaining in the band.

On 10 May 2019, it was announced that a song, &quot;Bullet Holes&quot;, would feature in the film &quot;John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum&quot;. The song and music video were released on 17 May 2019. Rossdale claimed in late May that the new album, featuring songwriting from Tyler Bates, was influenced by Bush&#x27;s presence on music festivals dominated by primarily metal bands, and that he had been specifically listening to System of a Down during the writing process for the new album. During the summer of 2019 Bush toured the US with Our Lady Peace and LĪVE.

On 3 March 2020 the band released a new single, &quot;Flowers on a Grave&quot; and announced their new album was re-titled &quot;The Kingdom&quot;. The album was released on 17 July 2020.

===&quot;The Art of Survival&quot; and &quot;Loaded: The Greatest Hits 1994–2023&quot; (2022–2025)===
On 7 March 2022, Bush announced a United States tour with Alice in Chains and Breaking Benjamin, to run from August to October.

On 27 July 2022, Bush announced that their ninth studio album, &quot;The Art of Survival&quot;, would be released on 7 October, and released the lead single, &quot;More Than Machines&quot;. The second single, &quot;Heavy Is the Ocean&quot;, was released on 16 September.

On 5 September 2023, &quot;Blabbermouth&quot; reported that Bush were to issue a greatest hits compilation later that year, the first to feature any of their post-2010 reunion material and Bush&#x27;s second overall. The band announced an accompanying single, &quot;Nowhere to Go But Everywhere&quot;, which was released on 22 September. On the same day, Bush revealed the title of the new compilation, &quot;&quot; and announced a promotional US tour.

&quot;Blabbermouth&quot; reported in early December 2023 that Rossdale had confirmed he was already &quot;7 songs into another [Bush] record&quot;, which Rossdale hoped to release in early 2024.

It was announced in August 2024 that Bush would release an EP, scheduled for release that September. Although the EP, titled &quot;Loads of Remixes&quot;, featured no new original content, it consisted of remixed versions of past Bush hits. The release was preceded in late July 2024 by a remixed edition of &quot;Glycerine&quot; created by bass player Corey Britz and titled &quot;Corey&#x27;s Bedroom Mix&quot;, and a version of &quot;Swallowed&quot; remixed in collaboration with Queens of the Stone Age bassist Michael Shuman&#x27;s side project GLU.

===&quot;I Beat Loneliness&quot; (2024-present) ===
Rossdale confirmed on 2 September 2024 that a new Bush studio album had been recorded.

On 2 January 2025, Gavin Rossdale set the title for the tenth Bush studio release as &quot;I Beat Loneliness&quot;, scheduled for release that year.

==Musical style and influences==

Bush have been described as grunge, post-grunge, alternative rock, and hard rock. One of the first bands to be described as post-grunge, Bush were labeled almost pejoratively as such. Matt Diehl of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Bush as &quot;the most successful and shameless mimics of Nirvana&#x27;s music&quot;. In the book &quot;Fargo Rock City: A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural North Dakota&quot;, Chuck Klosterman wrote, &quot;Bush was a good band who just happened to signal the beginning of the end; ultimately, they would become the grunge Warrant&quot;. In the book &quot;Accidental Revolution: The Story of Grunge&quot;, Kyle Anderson wrote about Bush&#x27;s album &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot;, writing: 

Bush have noted Nirvana&#x27;s music as a key influence in their work, but remained insistent that their style is original. Talking to &quot;The Morning Call&quot; in February 1996, lead guitarist Nigel Pulsford remarked &quot;Nirvana was a big influence. They acted as a catalyst, put the guitar band back in vogue and inspired us to perform&quot;. Of the similarities in the music of the two acts, Gavin Rossdale told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he &quot;hoped&quot; there was an element of Nirvana in Bush but also that felt he &quot;had [his] own thing&quot;. In 2011, Rossdale named the Pixies as &quot;the most influential band&quot; to him; indeed, founding members Pulsford and Rossdale became friends in part over a shared interest in the Pixies. Rossdale also acknowledged Alice in Chains as a major influence in his formative days as a rock musician, in particular the song &quot;Man in the Box&quot; (1990), which he described as &quot;a pivotal song for me as a songwriter and a young musician trying to figure out my own aesthetic&quot;. In addition, members of Bush have cited artists including The Beatles, Big Black, David Bowie, Bob Dylan, PJ Harvey, Hole, Hüsker Dü, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, My Bloody Valentine, Led Zeppelin, Tom Petty, The Replacements, Sex Pistols, Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth, Soul Asylum, Soundgarden, and Neil Young as influential or inspirational.

* The Paris-Madrid Trail is run on 24 May with a scheduled distance of 1014 km. It is a disastrous event which causes at least eight deaths including those of drivers Marcel Renault and Claude Barrow. The race is stopped by the authorities at Bordeaux. It is in retrospect sometimes referred to as the &quot;VIII Grand Prix de l&#x27;ACF&quot;. Fernand Gabriel (France) is the first to reach Bordeaux in his Mors.
* Road racing is banned as a result and the legacy of the event is the introduction of circuits, the first being opened at Le Mans in 1906 for the inaugural French Grand Prix, organised by the Automobile Club de France (ACF).
Gordon Bennett Cup
* Fourth running of the Gordon Bennett Cup takes place in Ireland due to road racing being illegal in Great Britain, the scheduled host. The location is the roads around Athy, County Kildare, and the winner is Camille Jenatzy (Belgium) driving a Mercedes
* It is at the 1903 Gordon Bennett cup that international racing colours are formally adopted with Italy taking red, Germany white, France blue and Great Britain taking its British racing green (BRG) for the first time. The British choice of green is partly due to the event being held in Ireland, which at the time is part of the UK, and to precedent as the winning Napier of 1902 had been painted olive green.
Ardennes Circuit
* Second running of the Ardennes Circuit race around Bastogne is won by Pierre de Crawhez driving a Panhard-Levassor 70 hp in a time of 5:52:07. The total distance is 512.05 km (85.34 km x 6 laps).

<text>Mohamed Mostafa ElBaradei (, ; born 17 June 1942) is an Egyptian law scholar and diplomat who served as the vice president of Egypt on an interim basis from 14 July 2013 until his resignation on 14 August 2013.

He was the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), an intergovernmental organization under the auspices of the United Nations (UN), from 1997 to 2009. At the end of his tenure he was appointed “Director General Emeritus of the International Atomic Energy Agency”. He and the IAEA were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005 &quot;for their efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is used in the safest possible way&quot;. ElBaradei was also featured in the Western press regarding politics in Egypt, particularly the 2011 revolution which ousted President Hosni Mubarak and the 2013 Egyptian coup d&#x27;état.

ElBaradei was born and raised in Giza Governorate, Greater Cairo, Egypt. He was one of five children of Mostafa ElBaradei, an attorney who headed the Egyptian Bar Association. ElBaradei&#x27;s father was also a supporter of democratic rights in Egypt, supporting a free press and an independent judiciary.

ElBaradei is married to Aida El Kashef, a former early-childhood teacher. They have two children: a daughter, Laila, a lawyer living in the UK; and a son, Mostafa, an IT manager living in Vienna. They also have two granddaughters, Maya and Nina.

A native speaker of Arabic, ElBaradei is also fluent in English and French, and knows &quot;enough German to get by, at least in Vienna.&quot;

== Education and early career ==

Following in the footsteps of his father, Mostafa, ElBaradei also studied law. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law from the University of Cairo in 1962, a master&#x27;s degree LLM in 1971 and a doctorate degree JSD in international law in 1974 from the New York University School of Law. His thesis was titled &quot;The right of passage through straits in time of peace&quot;.

ElBaradei&#x27;s diplomatic career began in 1964 in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he served in the Permanent Missions of Egypt to the UN in New York and in Geneva, in charge of political, legal, and arms-control issues. From 1974 to 1978, he was a special assistant to the foreign minister. In 1980, he became a senior fellow in charge of the International Law Program at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). From 1981 to 1987, he was also an adjunct professor of international law at the New York University School of Law.

In 1984, ElBaradei became a senior staff member of the IAEA Secretariat, serving as the agency&#x27;s legal adviser (1984 to 1993) and Assistant Director General for External Relations (1993 to 1997). ElBaradei is currently a member of both the International Law Association (ILA) and the American Society of International Law (ASIL).

== Public career as IAEA Director General (1997–2009) ==
ElBaradei&#x27;s tenure has been marked by high-profile, non-proliferation issues, which include the inspections in Iraq preceding the March 2003 invasion, and tensions over the nuclear program of Iran.

ElBaradei began to serve as Director General of the IAEA, which is based in Vienna, on 1 December 1997, succeeding Hans Blix of Sweden. The agency gradually came to take an active role in attempts to prevent nuclear proliferation, with its focus first centred on Iraq and Sudan, in which cases the agency claimed success, and later also on North Korea and Iran. ElBaradei was re-elected for two more four-year terms in 2001 and, despite opposition from the United States, to a third term in 2005. 

In late August 2007, ElBaradei finalized a secret &quot;divisive and risky&quot; nuclear agreement with Iran. Diplomats from the U.S., France, Britain, and Germany filed a formal protest.

In 2009 ElBaradei stated that Iran&#x27;s nuclear threat had been exaggerated and there was no evidence the country was close to building a nuclear weapon. He also rejected accusations that he had concealed Iran&#x27;s nuclear ambitions. His third and last term ended in November 2009. ElBaradei faced criticism from Washington, Israel, London, Berlin, and Paris, where officials saw his actions as attempts to block their efforts to intensify pressure on Iran regarding its nuclear program.

===First term as Director General===
After being appointed by the IAEA General Conference in 1997, ElBaradei said in his speech that, &quot;for international organizations to enjoy the confidence and support of their members, they have to be responsive to [members&#x27;] needs; show concrete achievements; conduct their activities in a cost-effective manner; and respect a process of equitable representation, transparency, and open dialogue.&quot;

Just a couple of months before ElBaradei took office, the Model Additional Protocol was adopted, creating a new environment for IAEA verification by giving it greater authority to look for undeclared nuclear activities. When in office, ElBaradei launched a program to establish &quot;integrated safeguards&quot; combining the IAEA&#x27;s comprehensive safeguard agreements with the newly adopted Additional Protocol. In his statement to the General Conference in 1998, he called upon all states to conclude the Additional Protocol: &quot;One of the main purposes of the strengthened-safeguards system can be better achieved with global adherence. I would, therefore, urge all states with outstanding-safeguards agreements to conclude them, and I would also urge all states to accelerate their consideration of the Model Additional Protocol and enter into consultations with the Agency at the earliest possible opportunity. We should work together to ensure that, by the year 2000, all states [will] have concluded outstanding-safeguards agreements and also the Additional Protocol.&quot; ElBaradei repeated this call through his years as the Director General of the IAEA. In November 2009, 93 countries had Additional Protocols in force.

ElBaradei&#x27;s first term ended in November 2001, just two months after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. These attacks made clear that the more is needed to be done to protect nuclear material and installations from theft or a terrorist attack. Consequently, ElBaradei established a nuclear security program to combat the risk of nuclear terrorism by assisting member states to strengthen the protection of their nuclear and radioactive material and installations, the Nuclear Security Fund .

===Second term as Director General===
One of the major issues during ElBaradei&#x27;s second term as the director general of the IAEA was the agency&#x27;s inspections in Iraq. ElBaradei disputed the U.S. rationale for the 2003 invasion of Iraq from the time of the 2002 Iraq disarmament crisis, when he, along with Hans Blix, led a team of UN weapons inspectors in Iraq. ElBaradei told the UN Security Council in March 2003 that documents purporting to show that Iraq had tried to acquire uranium from Niger were not authentic.

In an October 2003 interview published in the Cairo Times, he said &quot;the ultimate sense of security will be when we come to recognize that we are all part of one human race. Our primary allegiance is to the human race and not to one particular color or border. I think the sooner we renounce the sanctity of these many identities and try to identify ourselves with the human race the sooner we will get a better world and a safer world.

ElBaradei described the U.S. invasion of Iraq as &quot;a glaring example of how, in many cases, the use of force exacerbates the problem rather than [solves] it.&quot; ElBaradei further stated that &quot;we learned from Iraq that an inspection takes time, that we should be patient, that an inspection can, in fact, work,&quot; and that he had &quot;been validated&quot; in concluding that Saddam Hussein had not revived his nuclear weapons program.

In a 2004 op-ed piece on the dangers of nuclear proliferation, in the &quot;New York Times&quot; (12 February 2004), ElBaradei stated that &quot;[w]e must abandon the unworkable notion that it is morally reprehensible for some countries to pursue weapons of mass destruction, yet morally acceptable for others to rely on them for security – and indeed to continue to refine their capacities and postulate plans for their use.&quot; He went on to say &quot;If the world does not change course, we risk self-destruction.&quot;

===Third and final term as Director General===
The United States initially voiced opposition to his election to a third four-year term in 2005. In a May 2005 interview with the staff of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Lawrence Wilkerson, the chief of staff to former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, charged former Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security John Bolton with an underhanded campaign to unseat ElBaradei. &quot;Mr. Bolton overstepped his bounds in his moves and gyrations to try to keep [ElBaradei] from being reappointed as [IAEA] head,&quot; Wilkerson said. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported in December 2004 that the Bush administration had intercepted dozens of ElBaradei&#x27;s phone calls with Iranian diplomats and was scrutinizing them for evidence [that] they could use to force him out. IAEA spokesman Mark Gwozdecky said the agency worked on &quot;the assumption that one or more entities may be listening to our conversations.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s not how we would prefer to work, but it is the reality. At the end of the day, we have nothing to hide,&quot; he said. Iran responded to the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reports by accusing the U.S. of violating international law in intercepting the communications.

The United States was the only country to oppose ElBaradei&#x27;s reappointment and eventually failed to win enough support from other countries to oust ElBaradei. On 9 June 2005, after a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and ElBaradei, the United States dropped its objections. Among countries that supported ElBaradei were China, Russia, Germany, and France. China praised his leadership and objectivity, and supported him for doing &quot;substantial fruitful work, which has maintained the agency&#x27;s role and credit in international non-proliferation and promoted the development of peaceful use of nuclear energy. His work has been universally recognized in the international community. China appreciates Mr. El Baradei&#x27;s work and supports his reelection as the agency&#x27;s director general.&quot; France, Germany, and some developing countries, have made clear their support for ElBaradei as well. Russia issued a strong statement in favor of re-electing him as soon as possible.

ElBaradei was unanimously re-appointed by the IAEA board on 13 June 2005.

===Comments on no fourth term===
In 2008, ElBaradei said that he would not be seeking a fourth term as director general. Moreover, he said, in an IAEA document, that he was &quot;not available for a further term&quot; in office. In its first five rounds of voting, the IAEA Board of Governors was split in its decision regarding the next director general. ElBaradei said, &quot;I just hope that the agency has a candidate acceptable to all—north, south, east, west—because that is what is needed.&quot; After several rounds of voting, on 3 July 2009, Mr. Yukiya Amano, Japanese ambassador to the IAEA, was elected as the next IAEA director general.

===ElBaradei and U.S. relations===
ElBaradei, leader of the National Coalition for Change, has been a major voice for democratic change in Egypt since 2009 and was a significant leader during the 2011 protests. However, he has a rocky history with the U.S. government and supports some policies that do not support current U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. During his tenure as Director General of the IAEA (1997–2009), for instance, ElBaradei downplayed claims of possible military dimensions to Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, which undermined U.S. efforts to press Iran over its safeguards violations. According to a 3 July 2003 article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, ElBaradei also maintained that Iraq&#x27;s nuclear program had not restarted before the 2003 Iraq War, contradicting claims by the Bush administration. He told the German news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; on 12 July 2010 that he wanted to open the Gaza Strip – Egypt border and accused Israel of being the biggest threat to the Middle East because of their nuclear weapons.

ElBaradei has called for international criminal investigation of former Bush administration officials for their roles in planning the war on Iraq.

===Multinational control of the nuclear fuel cycle===
In an op-ed that he wrote for the &quot;Economist&quot; in 2003, ElBaradei outlined his idea for the future of the nuclear fuel cycle. His suggestion was to &quot;limit the processing of weapon-usable material in civilian nuclear programs, as well as the production of new material, by agreeing to restrict these operations exclusively to facilities under multinational control.&quot; Also, &quot;nuclear-energy systems should be deployed that, by design, avoid the use of materials that may be applied directly to making nuclear weapons.&quot; He concluded by saying that &quot;considerable advantages would be gained from international co-operation in these stages of the nuclear-fuel cycle. These initiatives would not simply add more non-proliferation controls, to limit access to weapon-usable nuclear material; they would also provide access to the benefits of nuclear technology for more people in more countries.&quot;

Non-nuclear-weapon states have been reluctant to embrace these proposals due to a perception that the commercial or strategic interests of nuclear-weapon states motivate the proposals, a perception that the proposals produce a dependency on a limited number of nuclear fuel suppliers, and a concern that the proposal restricts their unalienable right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

===Technical cooperation and cancer control===
ElBaradei&#x27;s work does not only concentrate on nuclear verification. Another very important aspect is development through nuclear technology. In 2004, ElBaradei sponsored a comprehensive global initiative—the Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT)—to fight cancer. In one of his statements, ElBaradei said: &quot;A silent crisis in cancer treatment persists in developing countries and is intensifying every year. At least 50 to 60 percent of cancer victims can benefit from radiotherapy, but most developing countries do not have enough radiotherapy machines or sufficient numbers of specialized doctors and other health professionals.&quot; In the first year of operation, PACT provided cancer-treatment capacity in seven member states, using the IAEA&#x27;s share of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize.

In his speech to the 2008 General Conference, ElBaradei said that &quot;development activities remain central to our work. Our resources have long been insufficient to keep pace with requests for support, and we have increasingly made use of partnerships with other organizations, regional collaborations and country-to-country support. I again emphasize that technical cooperation is not a bargaining chip, part of a political &#x27;balance&#x27; between the development and safeguards activities of the agency.&quot;

==International Crisis Group==
ElBaradei served on the board of trustees of the International Crisis Group, a non-governmental organization that enjoys an annual budget of over $15 million and is bankrolled by the Carnegie, the Ford Foundation, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as George Soros&#x27; Open Society Institute. Soros himself serves as a member of the organization&#x27;s executive committee.

== Egyptian politics ==

=== 2011 Egyptian revolution ===

During the early days of the Egyptian Revolution, ElBaradei&#x27;s speechwriter and long-time associate Laban Coblentz and other IAEA colleagues of ElBaradei contradicted the notion that ElBaradei had only recently become engaged in Egyptian politics, saying he had never relinquished his focus on human rights deficiencies in his home country. Coblentz noted that ElBaradei had first confronted Mubarak in early 2003, during the lead-up to the Iraq War, as well as on subsequent encounters.

Coblentz also pointed out the role that social media played in convincing ElBaradei that the young people of Egypt were ready for change: &quot;It was really this last 14 months, where someone I knew as not being particularly computer savvy, taught himself to use Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and started to do in virtual space what was forbidden to do by the Mubarak regime, the freedom of assembly by large groups.&quot;

While speaking at the Harvard Kennedy School on 27 April 2010, ElBaradei joked that he is &quot;looking for a job&quot; and is seeking to be an &quot;agent of change and an advocate for democracy&quot; within Egyptian politics. He also made clear that his wife is not very enthusiastic about any potential run.

On 27 January 2011, ElBaradei returned to Egypt amid ongoing turmoil, with the largest mass protests in 30 years, which had begun two days earlier, on 25 January 2011. ElBaradei declared himself ready to lead a transitional government if that was the will of the nation, saying that, &quot;If [people] want me to lead the transition, I will not let them down.&quot;
Subsequently, &quot;when he joined protesters Friday after noon prayers, police fired water cannons at him and his supporters. They used batons to beat some of ElBaradei&#x27;s supporters, who surrounded him to protect him.&quot; On 28 January 2011, ElBaradei was reported to have been placed under house arrest in Egypt. However, the next day, when he was interviewed by Al Jazeera, he said that he was unaware of any such arrest.

Later on, ElBaradei arrived in Tahrir Square to join thousands of other protesters against the Mubarak regime and spoke directly to the people, stating that they &quot;have taken back [their] rights&quot; and that they cannot go back. A number of Egyptian political movements have called on ElBaradei to form a transitional government. ElBaradei has also stated that &quot;the people [of Egypt] want the regime to fall.&quot; In response to the appointment of Omar Suleiman as the new vice president of Egypt, ElBaradei stated that it was a &quot;hopeless, desperate attempt by Mubarak to stay in power. I think [that] it is loud and clear...that Mubarak has to leave today.&quot; Additionally, ElBaradei restated his position that, when Egypt does become a democratic nation, &quot;there is no reason to believe that a democracy in Egypt would not lead to a better relationship with the US based on respect and equity.&quot;

The Guardian reported that ElBaradei had been mandated by the Muslim Brotherhood and four other opposition groups to negotiate an interim &quot;national salvation government.&quot; However, BBC reported that the Muslim Brotherhood, the largest opposition party banned by Mubarak&#x27;s regime, had not consented to the choice of ElBaradei as the representative of the opposition. &quot;The people have not appointed Mohamed ElBaradei to become a spokesman of them. The Muslim Brotherhood is much stronger than Mohamed ElBaradei as a person. And we do not agree [that he should represent] this movement. The movement is represented by itself, and it will [appoint] a committee. . .to [delegate its representatives].&quot;

His appointment was controversial largely because of the long periods that he has spent outside the country. His appointment was seen as a recognition of the importance of various Western nations&#x27; support of the revolts.

=== Possible presidential candidacy ===
ElBaradei&#x27;s name was circulated by opposition groups from 2009 to 2012 as a possible candidate to succeed President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt&#x27;s highest executive position when his name was suggested by Mohamed Hassanein Heikal.

ElBaradei did not make any clear statements regarding his intentions to run for the office; however, he has demanded that certain conditions be met to ensure fair elections accompanied by changes to the constitution that will allow more freedom for independent candidates before he would actually consider running for the presidency. Several opposition groups have endorsed him, considering him a neutral figure who could transition the country to greater democracy.

On 24 February 2010, ElBaradei met with several opposition leaders and notable intellectuals at his home in Cairo. The meeting was concluded with an announcement for the formation of a new non-party-political movement called the &quot;National Association for Change.&quot; The movement aims for general reforms in the political scene and mainly article 76 of the Egyptian constitution, which places restrictions on free presidential elections, especially when it comes to independent candidates. The banned political group, the Muslim Brotherhood, was represented at the meeting by one of its key figures; however, its stand in accepting a non-member of its group as a representative is still unclear. It is also unknown whether Amr Moussa, the head of the Arab League who met with ElBaradei a day earlier, will be part of the new movement.

On 7 March 2011 it was announced that ElBaradei intended to run for the presidential elections, this intention was later clearly stated in a live interview by ElBaradei to the ON TV channel 10 March 2011.
On 14 January 2012 ElBaradei declared he would not run for president.

On 4 July 2013 ElBaradei was mentioned as a favorite to head a transitional Egyptian government amid the 2013 Egyptian coup d&#x27;état as the prime minister.

=== President of Constitution Party ===
On 28 April 2012, ElBaradei launched the Constitution Party (DL). This date was too late to allow him to run for the presidency. The party claims itself as liberal, in order to protect and promote the principles and objectives of the 25 January 2011 Revolution according to liberal ideals. ElBaradei became a prominent figure of the Egyptian opposition. On 24 November, DL formed together with the secular parties the National Salvation Front, a coalition of the primary opposition parties against President Mohamed Morsi&#x27;s decrees. On 5 December 2012, he became the coordinator of National Salvation Front.

===Vice president===

Mohamed ElBaradei was involved in the coup d&#x27;état that toppled democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi amid mass protests against the perceived mismanagement of the country, the refusal of Morsi to form a coalition government, and the authoritarian influence of the Muslim Brotherhood on what had been a secular Muslim-majority state for decades. He was described by Reuters as the &quot;designated negotiator&quot; for the political opposition. ElBaradei gave support to the military&#x27;s plan to oust Morsi and begin implementing a &quot;political road map&quot; for Egypt, including the installation of Supreme Constitutional Court Chief Justice Adly Mansour as interim president of Egypt. He was present when General Sisi announced the temporary suspension of the constitution and the removal of Morsi from power.

In the political transition following Morsi&#x27;s ejection from the presidency, ElBaradei was immediately mentioned as a candidate for interim prime minister. He reportedly denied interest in the position at first. There were reports that ElBaradei would be named prime minister, which were retracted after objections by the Nour Party, on 7 July. He was sworn in as vice president, responsible for international relations, on 14 July 2013.

====14 August government raids and resignation====
On 14 August 2013, following a violent crackdown by security forces on supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi, in which at least 525 people were killed, ElBaradei resigned as vice president. In his resignation letter, ElBaradei stated: &quot;...I always saw peaceful alternatives for resolving this societal wrangling. Certain solutions were proposed, which could have led to national conciliation, but things have come this far ... It has become difficult for me to continue bearing the responsibility for decisions with which I do not agree and the consequences of which I fear. I cannot bear the responsibility for a single drop of blood before God, before my own conscience or the citizens...&quot; He then left the country for Vienna, where he was previously based as Director General of The International Atomic Energy Agency.

After his resignation, an Egyptian law professor at Helwan University, Sayyed Ateeq, filed lawsuit against ElBaradei, accusing him of a &quot;betrayal of trust&quot;. As Ateeq told Reuters, &quot;Dr. ElBaradei was entrusted with this position and he had a duty to go back to those who entrusted him and ask to resign.&quot; The case was heard in Cairo in October that year, and dismissed.

== Other activities ==
Mohamed ElBaradei is a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization that works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today&#x27;s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with heads of government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

ElBaradei is a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy.

== Awards ==
During his tenure as director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, ElBaradei received many awards for his efforts to ensure that nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes.

=== 2005 Nobel Peace Prize ===
On 7 October 2005, ElBaradei and the IAEA were announced as joint recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize for their &quot;efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy, for peaceful purposes, is used in the safest possible way.&quot; ElBaradei donated all of his winnings to building orphanages in Cairo. The IAEA&#x27;s winnings are being spent to train scientists from developing countries to use nuclear techniques in combating cancer and malnutrition. ElBaradei is the fourth Egyptian to receive the Nobel Prize, following Anwar Sadat (1978 in Peace), Naguib Mahfouz (1988 in Literature), and Ahmed Zewail (1999 in Chemistry).

In his Nobel lecture, ElBaradei said that the changing landscape of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament may be defined by the emergence of an extensive black market in nuclear material and equipment, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and sensitive nuclear technology, and the stagnation in nuclear disarmament. To combat proliferation, ElBaradei has suggested keeping nuclear and radiological material out of the hands of extremist groups, tightening control over the operations for producing the nuclear material that could be used in weapons, and accelerating disarmament efforts. ElBaradei also stated that only one percent of the money spent to develop new weapons would be enough to feed the entire world and that, if we hope to escape self-destruction, nuclear weapons should have no place in our collective conscience and no role in our security.

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said that he was delighted that the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize had been awarded to the UN nuclear watchdog and its head, ElBaradei. &quot;The secretary general congratulates him and the entire staff of the agency, past and present, on their contributions to global peace,&quot; a spokesman for Annan said.

==== Postage issues ====
Egypt Post on 8 October 2005 commemorated this award by issuing a set of two postage stamps. On 1 June 2009, to commemorate 4th Extraordinary Session of PAPU Plenipotentiary Conference held in Cairo between 1 and 9 June, Egypt Post issued a set of 16 stamps bearing African winners of Nobel Prizes, among which one is of ElBaradei

<text>Keolis Nederland is a public transport company operating bus and passenger train services in the Netherlands. Originally created as Syntus and owned by Connexxion, Keolis and Nederlandse Spoorwegen, since 2012 Keolis Nederland has been a 100% subsidiary of Keolis. Syntus is an acronym for Synergy between Train and Bus.

==History==

In 1991 Geldersche Streekvervoer Maatschappij (GSM) and the Dutch Railways started a transport integration project called Integratie Gelderland Oost. Integration between train and bus was the main goal. GSM later merged with Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf Arnhem to form Gelderse Vervoersmaatschappij.

In 1999 Syntus commenced rail operations, Connexxion, Keolis and Nederlandse Spoorwegen each owning one-third. In 2007 Connexxion&#x27;s share was purchased by Keolis and Nederlandse Spoorwegen. In 2012 Keolis purchased Nederlandse Spoorwegen&#x27;s 50% share.

In October 2017, Syntus was rebranded Keolis Nederland with a new visual identity.

==Visgraatmodel==
Syntus propagates synergy, which is based on a so-called &#x27;visgraatmodel&#x27; (fish bone model). In this model train service represent the backbones. Bus services represent the spokes that feed train services. After a while other public transport companies like Arriva and Veolia Transport copied the model.

==Operations==
In 2005, Syntus briefly operated a cross border service into Germany from Arnhem to Emmerich.

From December 2006 until December 2013, Syntus operated the Almelo to Mariënberg rail concession under sub-contract to Connexxion.

In August 2010, Syntus commenced an eight-year contract to operate services in Overijssel. In December 2010, it commenced a 10-year contract to operate services in Gelderland. In December 2016, it commenced a seven-year contract to operate services in Utrecht.

In December 2017, Keolis Nederland has commenced a ten-year contract to operate bus services in Almere. In the same month, it has commenced a 15-year contract to operate rail services in the province of Overijssel from Zwolle to Enschede and Zwolle to Kampen. These will be operated by 16 Stadler Flirts.

==Branding==
Syntus&#x27; corporate identity consisted of the colors yellow, white and blue. Every region has its own identity incorporated in the corporate identity. The Syntus brand was retired in 2017 and replaced by the Keolis brand.

<text>In linguistics, and particularly phonology, stress or accent is the relative emphasis or prominence given to a certain syllable in a word or to a certain word in a phrase or sentence. That emphasis is typically caused by such properties as increased loudness and vowel length, full articulation of the vowel, and changes in tone. The terms &quot;stress&quot; and &quot;accent&quot; are often used synonymously in that context but are sometimes distinguished. For example, when emphasis is produced through pitch alone, it is called &quot;pitch accent&quot;, and when produced through length alone, it is called &quot;quantitative accent&quot;. When caused by a combination of various intensified properties, it is called &quot;stress accent&quot; or &quot;dynamic accent&quot;; English uses what is called &quot;variable stress accent&quot;.

Since stress can be realised through a wide range of phonetic properties, such as loudness, vowel length, and pitch (which are also used for other linguistic functions), it is difficult to define stress solely phonetically.

The stress placed on syllables within words is called word stress. Some languages have &quot;fixed stress&quot;, meaning that the stress on virtually any multisyllable word falls on a particular syllable, such as the penultimate (e.g. Polish) or the first (e.g. Finnish). Other languages, like English and Russian, have &quot;lexical stress&quot;, where the position of stress in a word is not predictable in that way but lexically encoded. Sometimes more than one level of stress, such as &quot;primary stress&quot; and &quot;secondary stress&quot;, may be identified.

Stress is not necessarily a feature of all languages: some, such as French and Mandarin Chinese, are sometimes analyzed as lacking lexical stress entirely.

The stress placed on words within sentences is called sentence stress or prosodic stress. That is one of the three components of prosody, along with rhythm and intonation. It includes phrasal stress (the default emphasis of certain words within phrases or clauses), and contrastive stress (used to highlight an item, a word or part of a word, that is given particular focus).

== Phonetic realization ==
There are various ways in which stress manifests itself in the speech stream, and they depend to some extent on which language is being spoken. Stressed syllables are often louder than non-stressed syllables, and they may have a higher or lower pitch. They may also sometimes be pronounced longer. There are sometimes differences in place or manner of articulation. In particular, vowels in unstressed syllables may have a more central (or &quot;neutral&quot;) articulation, and those in stressed syllables have a more peripheral articulation. Stress may be realized to varying degrees on different words in a sentence; sometimes, the difference is minimal between the acoustic signals of stressed and those of unstressed syllables.

Those particular distinguishing features of stress, or types of prominence in which particular features are dominant, are sometimes referred to as particular types of accent: &quot;dynamic accent&quot; in the case of loudness, &quot;pitch accent&quot; in the case of pitch (although that term usually has more specialized meanings), &quot;quantitative accent&quot; in the case of length, and &quot;qualitative accent&quot; in the case of differences in articulation. They can be compared to the various types of accents in music theory. In some contexts, the term &quot;stress&quot; or &quot;stress accent&quot; specifically means dynamic accent (or as an antonym to &quot;pitch accent&quot; in its various meanings).

A prominent syllable or word is said to be &quot;accented&quot; or &quot;tonic&quot;; the latter term does not imply that it carries phonemic tone. Other syllables or words are said to be &quot;unaccented&quot; or &quot;atonic&quot;. Syllables are frequently said to be in &quot;pretonic&quot; or &quot;post-tonic&quot; position, and certain phonological rules apply specifically to such positions. For instance, in American English, /t/ and /d/ are flapped in post-tonic position.

In Mandarin Chinese, which is a tonal language, stressed syllables have been found to have tones that are realized with a relatively large swing in fundamental frequency, and unstressed syllables typically have smaller swings. (See also Stress in Standard Chinese.)

Stressed syllables are often perceived as being more forceful than non-stressed syllables.

== Word stress ==
Word stress, or sometimes &quot;lexical stress&quot;, is the stress placed on a given syllable in a word. The position of word stress in a word may depend on certain general rules applicable in the language or dialect in question, but in other languages, it must be learned for each word, as it is largely unpredictable, for example in English. In some cases, classes of words in a language differ in their stress properties; for example, loanwords into a language with &quot;fixed&quot; stress may preserve stress placement from the source language, or the special pattern for Turkish placenames.

===Non-phonemic stress===
In some languages, the placement of stress can be determined by rules. It is thus not a phonemic property of the word, because it can always be predicted by applying the rules.

Languages in which the position of the stress can usually be predicted by a simple rule are said to have &quot;fixed stress&quot;. For example, in Czech, Finnish, Icelandic, Hungarian and Latvian, the stress almost always comes on the first syllable of a word. In Armenian the stress is on the last syllable of a word. In Quechua, Esperanto, and Polish, the stress is almost always on the penult (second-last syllable). In Macedonian, it is on the antepenult (third-last syllable).

Other languages have stress placed on different syllables but in a predictable way, as in Classical Arabic and Latin, where stress is conditioned by the weight of particular syllables. They are said to have a regular stress rule.

Statements about the position of stress are sometimes affected by the fact that when a word is spoken in isolation, prosodic factors (see below) come into play, which do not apply when the word is spoken normally within a sentence. French words are sometimes said to be stressed on the final syllable, but that can be attributed to the prosodic stress, which is placed on the last syllable (unless it is a schwa in which case the stress is placed on the second-last syllable) of any string of words in that language. Thus, it is on the last syllable of a word analyzed in isolation. The situation is similar in Mandarin Chinese. French and Georgian (and, according to some authors, Mandarin Chinese) can be considered to have no real lexical stress.

===Phonemic stress===
With some exceptions above, languages such as Germanic languages, Romance languages, the East and South Slavic languages, Lithuanian, Greek, as well as others, in which the position of stress in a word is not fully predictable, are said to have &quot;phonemic stress&quot;. Stress in these languages is usually truly lexical and must be memorized as part of the pronunciation of an individual word. In some languages, such as Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Lakota and, to some extent, Italian, stress is even represented in writing using diacritical marks, for example in the Spanish words and . Sometimes, stress is fixed for all forms of a particular word, or it can fall on different syllables in different inflections of the same word.

In such languages with phonemic stress, the position of stress can serve to distinguish otherwise identical words. For example, the English words &quot;insight&quot; () and &quot;incite&quot; () are distinguished in pronunciation only by the fact that the stress falls on the first syllable in the former and on the second syllable in the latter. Examples from other languages include German ( vs. ); and Italian ( vs. ).

In many languages with lexical stress, it is connected with alternations in vowels and/or consonants, which means that vowel quality differs by whether vowels are stressed or unstressed. There may also be limitations on certain phonemes in the language in which stress determines whether they are allowed to occur in a particular syllable or not. That is the case with most examples in English and occurs systematically in Russian, such as (, ) vs. (, ); and in Portuguese, such as the triplet (, ), (, ), (, ).

Dialects of the same language may have different stress placement. For instance, the English word &quot;laboratory&quot; is stressed on the second syllable in British English (&quot;labóratory&quot; often pronounced &quot;labóratry&quot;, the second &quot;o&quot; being silent), but the first syllable in American English, with a secondary stress on the &quot;tor&quot; syllable (&quot;láboratory&quot; often pronounced &quot;lábratory&quot;). The Spanish word is stressed on the first syllable in Spain () but on the second syllable in the Americas (). The Portuguese words for Madagascar and the continent Oceania are stressed on the third syllable in European Portuguese ( and ), but on the fourth syllable in Brazilian Portuguese ( and ).

===Compounds===
With very few exceptions, English compound words are stressed on their first component. Even the exceptions, such as &quot;mankínd&quot;, are instead often stressed on the first component by some people or in some kinds of English. The same components as those of a compound word are sometimes used in a descriptive phrase with a different meaning and with stress on both words, but that descriptive phrase is then not usually considered a compound: &quot;bláck bírd&quot; (any bird that is black) and &quot;bláckbird&quot; (a specific bird species) and &quot;páper bág&quot; (a bag made of paper) and &quot;páper bag&quot; (very rarely used for a bag for carrying newspapers but often also used for a bag made of paper).

=== Levels of stress ===

Some languages are described as having both &quot;primary stress&quot; and &quot;secondary stress&quot;. A syllable with secondary stress is stressed relative to unstressed syllables but not as strongly as a syllable with primary stress. As with primary stress, the position of secondary stress may be more or less predictable depending on language. In English, it is not fully predictable, but the different secondary stress of the words &quot;organization&quot; and &quot;accumulation&quot; (on the first and second syllable, respectively) is predictable due to the same stress of the verbs &quot;órganize&quot; and &quot;accúmulate&quot;. In some analyses, for example the one found in Chomsky and Halle&#x27;s &quot;The Sound Pattern of English&quot;, English has been described as having four levels of stress: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary, but the treatments often disagree with one another. 

Peter Ladefoged and other phoneticians have noted that it is possible to describe English with only one degree of stress, as long as prosody is recognized and unstressed syllables are phonemically distinguished for vowel reduction. They find that the multiple levels posited for English, whether &quot;primary–secondary&quot; or &quot;primary–secondary–tertiary&quot;, are not phonetic stress (let alone phonemic), and that the supposed secondary/tertiary stress is not characterized by the increase in respiratory activity associated with primary/secondary stress in English and other languages. (For further detail see Stress and vowel reduction in English.)

== Prosodic stress ==

&quot;Prosodic stress&quot;, or &quot;sentence stress&quot;, refers to stress patterns that apply at a higher level than the individual word – namely within a prosodic unit. It may involve a certain natural stress pattern characteristic of a given language, but may also involve the placing of emphasis on particular words because of their relative importance (contrastive stress).

An example of a natural prosodic stress pattern is that described for French above; stress is placed on the final syllable of a string of words (or if that is a schwa, the next-to-final syllable). A similar pattern is found in English (see above): the traditional distinction between (lexical) primary and secondary stress is replaced partly by a prosodic rule stating that the final stressed syllable in a phrase is given additional stress. (A word spoken alone becomes such a phrase, hence such prosodic stress may appear to be lexical if the pronunciation of words is analyzed in a standalone context rather than within phrases.)

Another type of prosodic stress pattern is &quot;quantity sensitivity&quot; – in some languages additional stress tends to be placed on syllables that are longer (moraically heavy).

Prosodic stress is also often used pragmatically to emphasize (focus attention on) particular words or the ideas associated with them. Doing this can change or clarify the meaning of a sentence; for example:

As in the examples above, stress is normally transcribed as italics in printed text or underlining in handwriting.

In English, stress is most dramatically realized on focused or accented words. For instance, consider the dialogue

In it, the stress-related acoustic differences between the syllables of &quot;tomorrow&quot; would be small compared to the differences between the syllables of &quot;dinner&quot;, the emphasized word. In these emphasized words, stressed syllables such as &quot;din&quot; in &quot;din&quot;ner are louder and longer. They may also have a different fundamental frequency, or other properties.

The main stress within a sentence, often found on the last stressed word, is called the &quot;nuclear stress&quot;.

== Stress and vowel reduction ==
In many languages, such as Russian and English, vowel reduction may occur when a vowel changes from a stressed to an unstressed position. In English, unstressed vowels may reduce to schwa-like vowels, though the details vary with dialect (see stress and vowel reduction in English). The effect may be dependent on lexical stress (for example, the unstressed first syllable of the word &quot;photographer&quot; contains a schwa , whereas the stressed first syllable of &quot;photograph&quot; does not ), or on prosodic stress (for example, the word &quot;of&quot; is pronounced with a schwa when it is unstressed within a sentence, but not when it is stressed).

Many other languages, such as Finnish and the mainstream dialects of Spanish, do not have unstressed vowel reduction; in these languages vowels in unstressed syllables have nearly the same quality as those in stressed syllables.

== Stress and rhythm ==

Some languages, such as English, are said to be &quot;stress-timed languages&quot;; that is, stressed syllables appear at a roughly constant rate and non-stressed syllables are shortened to accommodate that, which contrasts with languages that have &quot;syllable timing&quot; (e.g. Spanish) or &quot;mora timing&quot; (e.g. Japanese), whose syllables or moras are spoken at a roughly constant rate regardless of stress.

== Historical effects ==
It is common for stressed and unstressed syllables to behave differently as a language evolves. For example, in the Romance languages, the original Latin short vowels and have often become diphthongs when stressed. Since stress takes part in verb conjugation, that has produced verbs with vowel alternation in the Romance languages. For example, the Spanish verb (to return, come back) has the form in the past tense but in the present tense (see Spanish irregular verbs). Italian shows the same phenomenon but with alternating with instead. That behavior is not confined to verbs; note for example Spanish from Latin , or Italian from Latin . There are also examples in French, though they are less systematic : from Latin where the first syllable was stressed, vs from Latin where the main stress was on the penultimate syllable.

== Stress &quot;deafness&quot; ==
An operational definition of word stress may be provided by the stress &quot;deafness&quot; paradigm. The idea is that if listeners perform poorly on reproducing the presentation order of series of stimuli that minimally differ in the position of phonetic prominence (e.g. ), the language does not have word stress. The task involves a reproduction of the order of stimuli as a sequence of key strokes, whereby key &quot;1&quot; is associated with one stress location (e.g. ) and key &quot;2&quot; with the other (e.g. ). A trial may be from two to six stimuli in length. Thus, the order is to be reproduced as &quot;1121&quot;. It was found that listeners whose native language was French performed significantly worse than Spanish listeners in reproducing the stress patterns by key strokes. The explanation is that Spanish has lexically contrastive stress, as evidenced by the minimal pairs like () and (), while in French, stress does not convey lexical information and there is no equivalent of stress minimal pairs as in Spanish.

An important case of stress &quot;deafness&quot; relates to Persian. The language has generally been described as having contrastive word stress or accent as evidenced by numerous stem and stem–clitic minimal pairs such as () and (). The authors argue that the reason why Persian listeners are &quot;stress-deaf&quot; is that their accent locations arise postlexically. Persian thus lacks stress in the strict sense.

Stress &quot;deafness&quot; has been studied for a number of languages, such as Polish and French learners of Spanish.

== Spelling and notation for stress ==
The orthographies of some languages include devices for indicating the position of lexical stress. Some examples are listed below:
* In Modern Greek, all polysyllables are written with an acute accent () over the vowel of the stressed syllable. (The acute accent is also used on some monosyllables in order to distinguish homographs, as in (&#x27;the&#x27;) and (&#x27;or&#x27;); here the stress of the two words is the same.)
* In Spanish orthography, stress may be written explicitly with a single acute accent on a vowel. Stressed antepenultimate syllables are always written with that accent mark, as in . If the last syllable is stressed, the accent mark is used if the word ends in the letters &quot;n&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, or a vowel, as in . If the penultimate syllable is stressed, the accent is used if the word ends in any other letter, as in . That is, if a word is written without an accent mark, the stress is on the penult if the last letter is a vowel, &quot;n&quot;, or &quot;s&quot;, but on the final syllable if the word ends in any other letter. However, as in Greek, the acute accent is also used for some words to distinguish various syntactical uses (e.g. &#x27;tea&#x27; vs. a form of the pronoun &#x27;you&#x27;; &#x27;where&#x27; as a pronoun or &quot;wh&quot;-complement, &#x27;where&#x27; as an adverb). 
* Catalan and Valencian orthographies use the acute and grave accents to mark both stress and vowel quality. An acute on indicates that the vowel is stressed and close-mid (), while grave on indicates that the vowel is stressed and open-mid (). Grave on and acute on simply indicate that the vowels are stressed. Thus, the acute is used on close or close-mid vowels, and the grave on open or open-mid vowels.
* In Filipino orthography (which also applies to other Philippine languages), an acute accent is used to distinguish similar words with distinct definitions. The position of the stress may occur in first, middle or final syllable of a word. Stress that occurs in the first syllable serves as the default word and is usually left unwritten e.g. (&#x27;whistle&#x27;) which distinguishes from (&#x27;seven&#x27;). Diacritics in Modern Tagalog and other Philippine languages are rarely used in writing, cases of which the diacritical marks are used can only be seen in formal and academic setting. Vowels with an acute accent are not included in the Filipino alphabet, possible combinations include: á,é,í,ó and ú.
* In Portuguese, stress is sometimes indicated explicitly with an acute accent (for &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, and open &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;o&quot;), or circumflex (for close &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;o&quot;). The orthography has an extensive set of rules that describe the placement of diacritics, based on the position of the stressed syllable and the surrounding letters.
* In Italian, the grave accent is needed in words ending with an accented vowel, e.g. , &#x27;city&#x27;, and in some monosyllabic words that might otherwise be confused with other words, like (&#x27;there&#x27;) and (&#x27;the&#x27;). It is optional for it to be written on any vowel if there is a possibility of misunderstanding, such as (&#x27;condominiums&#x27;) and (&#x27;joint owners&#x27;). (In this particular case, a frequent one in which diacritics present themselves, the difference of accents is caused by the fall of the second &quot;i&quot; from Latin in Italian, typical of the genitive, in the first noun (con/domìnìi/, meaning ); while the second was derived from the nominative (con/dòmini/, meaning simply )). The acute accent may be used on and to represent close-mid vowels when they are stressed. Since final is hardly ever close-mid, is very rarely encountered in written Italian (e.g. &#x27;subway&#x27;). The two different accents may be used to differentiate minimal pairs within Italian (for example &#x27;peach&#x27; vs. &#x27;fishing&#x27;), but in practice this is limited to didactic texts.
* Maltese orthography indicates stress with grave accent.

Though not part of normal orthography, a number of devices exist that are used by linguists and others to indicate the position of stress (and syllabification in some cases) when it is desirable to do so. Some of these are listed here.
* Most commonly, the stress mark is placed before the beginning of the stressed syllable, where a syllable is definable. However, it is occasionally placed immediately before the vowel. In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), primary stress is indicated by a high vertical line (primary stress mark: codice_1) before the stressed element, secondary stress by a low vertical line (secondary stress mark: codice_1). For example, or . Extra stress can be indicated by doubling the symbol: .
* Linguists frequently mark primary stress with an acute accent over the vowel, and secondary stress by a grave accent. Example: or . That has the advantage of not requiring a decision about syllable boundaries.
* In English dictionaries that show pronunciation by respelling, stress is typically marked with a prime mark placed after the stressed syllable: /si-lab′-ə-fi-kay′-shən/.
* In pronunciation guides, stress is often indicated using a combination of bold text and capital letters. For example, si-lab-if-i-KAY-shun or si-LAB-if-i-KAY-shun
* In Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian dictionaries, stress is indicated with marks called (, &#x27;stress marks&#x27;). Primary stress is indicated with an acute accent (´) on a syllable&#x27;s vowel (example: ). Secondary stress may be unmarked or marked with a grave accent: . If the acute accent sign is unavailable for technical reasons, stress can be marked by making the vowel capitalized or italic. In general texts, stress marks are rare, typically used either when required for disambiguation of homographs (compare &#x27;in great quantities&#x27;, and &#x27;in great quantities&#x27;), or in rare words and names that are likely to be mispronounced. Materials for foreign learners may have stress marks throughout the text.
* In Dutch, indication of stress is usually marked by an acute accent on the vowel (or, in the case of a diphthong or double vowel, the first two vowels) of the stressed syllable. Compare (&#x27;deterioration&#x27;) and (&#x27;rear exit&#x27;).
* In Biblical Hebrew, a complex system of cantillation marks is used to mark stress, as well as verse syntax and the melody according to which the verse is chanted in ceremonial Bible reading. In Modern Hebrew, there is no standardized way to mark the stress. Most often, the cantillation mark (part of ), which looks like a left-pointing arrow above the consonant of the stressed syllable, for example (&#x27;morning&#x27;) as opposed to (&#x27;cowboy&#x27;). That mark is usually used in books by the Academy of the Hebrew Language and is available on the standard Hebrew keyboard at AltGr-6. In some books, other marks, such as , are used.

<text>XLISP is a family of Lisp implementations written by David Betz and first released in 1983.

The first version was a Lisp with object-oriented extensions for computers with limited power. The second version (XLISP 2.0) moved toward Common Lisp, but was by no means a complete implementation. After a long period of inactivity, the author released a new version based on XSCHEME, his Scheme implementation. The most current version follows the Scheme R3RS standard.

==Derivatives==
* AutoLISP, a programming and scripting language for AutoCAD, is based on a very old version of XLISP.
* XLISP-PLUS is a derivative of XLISP 2.0 that continues to add Common Lisp features. Winterp is a derivative of XLISP-PLUS.
* XLISP-STAT is an implementation of Lisp-Stat, an environment for dynamic graphics and statistics with objects.
* Nyquist is an extension of XLISP for sound synthesis.
* ANIMAL (AN IMage ALgebra) is an image manipulation environment created by Carla Maria Modena and Roberto Brunelli.
* A 1989 entry to the IOCCC identifies itself as &quot;XLISP 4.0&quot;.

<text>Alianza Federal de Mercedes, which in English translates to Federal Land Grant Alliance, was a group led by Reies Tijerina based in New Mexico in the 1960s that fought for the land rights of Hispano New Mexicans.

The Alianza had affiliates in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico and San Luis, Colorado.

Hispano residents had settled in the areas of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado centuries before. Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States Congress ostensibly guaranteed that current residents would retain their land rights after the New Mexico Territory was transferred to U.S. ownership. However, by the 1960s, many traditional shepherds had lost their land to cattle ranchers and the U.S. Forest Service.

==The Tierra Amarilla incident==
On June 5, 1967, in Tierra Amarilla, a small band of Chicanos affiliated with Alianza Federal de Mercedes attempted to arrest the county&#x27;s district attorney and put him on trial. There were shots fired and two men were wounded. The invaders held the courthouse for two hours, ransacking it, but the district attorney was out of town. The National Guard, equipped with armored tanks, was called in by Governor of New Mexico David Cargo. While the gunmen were in hiding, the National Guard held many of their family members captive. This incident received national publicity and brought the Alianza&#x27;s cause to public attention.

Prior to the incident, quoted from The Chicanos: Mexican American Voices, edited by Ed Ludwig and James Santibanez. &quot;In June, 1967, Tijerina attempted to hold a mass meeting of the Alianza. The District Attorney of Rio Arriba County, Alfonso Sanchez, issued a statement on a radio broadcast:

... I wish to give all notice to all Alianza members who plan to be present and participate in the meeting at Coyote tomorrow. That meeting is versus the law since it is planned to take over private property. Criminal charges of unlawful assembly will be filed against all persons who attend.

The District Attorney did not stop with the warning. The night before the meeting, cars of the State Police traced swift paths through the night, through the small, darkened towns of Rio Arriba County and to the homes of those members of the Alianza who, they thought, might attend the meeting arranged by Reies Tijernia. There was sudden pounding on wooden doors, house lights flicked on, startled faces appeared in the night.
&quot;You&#x27;re under arrest,&quot; were the often repeated words.
Nine Alianza members were jailed.
Two days later the Alianza had procured a warrant for the arrest of District Attorney Alfonso Sanchez. Armed, their group entered the courthouse at Tierra Amarilla in an attempt to make a citizen&#x27;s arrest.

<text>Frederick VII (Frederik Carl Christian; 6 October 1808 – 15 November 1863) was King of Denmark from 1848 to 1863. He was the last Danish monarch of the older Royal branch of the House of Oldenburg and the last king of Denmark to rule as an absolute monarch. During his reign, he signed a constitution that established a Danish parliament and made the country a constitutional monarchy. Frederick&#x27;s motto was &quot;Folkets Kærlighed, min Styrke&quot; (Danish for &quot;the People&#x27;s Love, my Strength&quot;).

==Early life ==

The future King Frederick VII was born at 11 a.m. on 6 October 1808 at his parents&#x27; residence &quot;Levetzau&#x27;s Palace&quot;, an 18th-century palace which forms part of the Amalienborg Palace complex in central Copenhagen. Born into the House of Oldenburg, the royal house which had ruled Denmark since its foundation there in the 15th century, he was the second, but eldest surviving, child to the then Prince Christian Frederick of Denmark, the future King Christian VIII, and his first wife Duchess Charlotte Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. His maternal grandparents were Friedrich Franz I, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and Luise, Duchess of Saxe-Gotha.

The young prince was baptised on 17 October by the royal confessor Nicolai Edinger Balle, Bishop of Zealand, with the names &quot;Frederik Carl Christian&quot;. To his mother, he was always known as &quot;Fritz&quot;.

==Marriages==
The king&#x27;s first two marriages both ended in scandal and divorce. He was first married in Copenhagen on 1 November 1828 to his second cousin Princess Vilhelmine Marie of Denmark, a daughter of King Frederick VI of Denmark. They separated in 1834 and divorced in 1837. On 10 June 1841 he married for a second time to Duchess Caroline Charlotte Mariane of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, whom he divorced in 1846.
On 7 August 1850 in Frederiksborg Palace, he morganatically married Louise Christina Rasmussen, whom he created Lensgrevinde Danner in 1850, a milliner and former ballet dancer who had for many years been his acquaintance or mistress, the natural daughter of Gotthilf L. Køppen and of Juliane Caroline Rasmussen. This marriage seems to have been happy, although it aroused great moral indignation among the nobility and the bourgeoisie. Rasmussen was denounced as a vulgar gold digger by her enemies, but viewed as an unaffected daughter of the people by her admirers and seems to have had a stabilizing effect on him. She also worked at maintaining his popularity by letting him meet the people of the provinces.

===Extramarital relations and possible offspring===
The expectation that Frederick would not likely produce offspring, despite numerous affairs, was widespread, but sources rarely state the reasons. Some speculate that Frederick was infertile. During the reign of Frederick&#x27;s father, Christian VIII, the succession question was already being brought forward. &quot;(See below: Succession crisis)&quot;

It has been claimed that Frederick did indeed father a son, Frederik Carl Christian Poulsen, born on 21 November 1843, as a result of his relationship with Else Maria Guldborg Pedersen (also referred to as Marie Poulsen), which took place after his first two unhappy marriages. This was first asserted in 1994. In 2009, a Danish woman, Else Margrethe (&#x27;Gete&#x27;) Bondo Oldenborg Maaløe claimed to be the great-granddaughter of Frederik VII through Frederik Carl. Maaloe possesses four letters from Frederick to Marie Poulsen acknowledging paternity; these are quoted in her book, published in 2009. In all cases, however, extramarital offspring were and still are barred from the line of succession.

It has been claimed Frederick had a same-sex relationship with his friend, Carl Berling (1812–1871), publisher and owner of the newspaper &quot;Berlingske Tidende&quot;. The bisexual Berling had an illegitimate child with Louise Rasmussen, Carl Christian (1841–1908). Carl Christian was much liked by the King, to the extent that he insisted on signing the new constitution on Carl Christian&#x27;s 8th birthday on 5 June 1849. To retain a tinge of decency, the King married Louise Rasmussen and the trio then moved into the royal castle, where Berling was appointed Chamberlain and remained until 1861. The public indignation within higher circles over Frederick&#x27;s morganatic marriage is well-known, but reasons have rarely been explained in detail.

==Reign==

Frederick, who was the last king of the older branch of the Oldenburg dynasty, had a rather neglected childhood after the divorce of his parents. His youth was marked by private scandals and for many years he appeared as the problem child of the royal family.
When he succeeded to the throne in January 1848, he was almost at once met by the demands for a constitution. The Schleswig-Holsteiners wanted an independent state while the Danes wished to maintain South Jutland as a Danish area. The king soon yielded to the Danish demands, and in March he accepted the end of absolutism, which resulted in the June Constitution of 1849. During the First War of Schleswig against the German powers in 1848–51, Frederick appeared as ”the national leader&quot; and was regarded almost as a war hero, despite having never taken any active part in the struggles.

During his reign, Frederick on the whole behaved as a constitutional monarch. He did not, however, quite give up interfering in politics. In 1854, he contributed to the fall of the strongly conservative Ørsted cabinet, and in 1859–60, he accepted a liberal government appointed on the initiative of his wife. During the crisis in the Duchies in 1862–63, shortly before his death, he spoke openly for an inter-Scandinavian military co-operation. Those minor crises created frictions and maintained some permanent insecurity, but did not damage his general popularity. In some of these affairs, he overstepped the mark beyond any doubt; on the other hand, the first Danish constitution was somewhat vague as regards to the limits of royal power.

Frederick&#x27;s rule also witnessed the heyday of the National Liberal Party, which was in office from 1854. This period was marked by some political and economic reforms, such as the beginning of the demolition of the walls around Copenhagen and, in 1857, the introduction of free trade. The constant quarrels with the opposition regarding the Schleswig-Holstein Question and German demands that Denmark not try to unite with Schleswig (South Jutland) led to some changes to the constitution in order to fit the foreign political situation, which created frustration in Denmark. The National Liberals therefore at last favored a more resistant course against the Germans, which led to the Second War of Schleswig in 1864. The king wholeheartedly supported this course and just before his sudden death he was prepared to sign a new special constitution for Denmark and Schleswig (the so-called November Constitution).

==Succession crisis==

Frederick was married three times, but he produced no legitimate issue. The fact that he reached middle age without producing an heir meant that his second cousin Prince Christian of Glücksburg (1818–1906), the paternal descendant of Christian III, was chosen as his heir-presumptive in 1852. When Frederick died in 1863, Christian took the throne as Christian IX.

Nationalism in the German-speaking parts of Schleswig-Holstein meant that there was no consensus to keep the duchies united under the Danish crown, internationally or within the duchies themselves. The duchies were inherited according to Salic law among the descendants of a past heiress, Hedvig of Holstein, whose heir according to primogeniture after King Frederick VII was Frederick, Duke of Augustenburg (who proclaimed himself Duke of Schleswig-Holstein after Frederick VII&#x27;s death). This Frederick of Augustenburg had become the symbol of the nationalist German independence movement in Schleswig-Holstein since the time that his father, in exchange for compensation, had renounced his claims as first in line to inherit the twin Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein following the London Protocol of 8 May 1852, which concluded the First War of Schleswig. Because of his father&#x27;s renunciation, Frederick was regarded as ineligible to succeed.

Denmark was (up until 1953) also under Salic Law, but only among descendants of Frederick III (who was the first hereditary monarch of Denmark; previously the kingdom had been, officially, elective). But Frederick VII was the last of Frederick III&#x27;s male line, therefore, his nearest kinsmen in the male-line, the Schleswig-Holstein ducal lines of Augustenborg and Glücksburg (cadet branches of Denmark&#x27;s earlier, non-hereditary kings), were not entitled to succeed to Denmark&#x27;s throne, although they retained hereditary claims to the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Upon Frederick VII&#x27;s death, Denmark&#x27;s throne could devolve to or through a female heir according to &quot;semi-Salic&quot; succession. There were, however, conflicting interpretations of that provision and of Denmark&#x27;s claim to its applicability to the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, held theretofore in personal union by the kings of Denmark. The question was solved by an election and a separate law to confirm Denmark&#x27;s new successor.

The closest female relatives of Frederick VII were the issue of his paternal aunt, Princess Louise Charlotte of Denmark, who had married a cadet Hessian prince. However, they were not male-line descendants of Helwig of Schauenburg, and thus were not eligible to succeed in Holstein, and had disputed claims on Schleswig. The semi-Salic heiresses of Frederick VII were Princess Caroline of Denmark and Frederick VII&#x27;s divorced wife Vilhelmine (both childless daughters of the late King Frederick VI). They were followed in the line of succession by Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark, sister of Frederick VI, who had married Frederick, Duke of Augustenburg, Salic heir to Schleswig and Holstein after Frederick VII, but whose wife&#x27;s claim to Denmark would only come into effect after the deaths of Caroline and Vilhelmine, both still living in 1863.

Some rights also belonged to the Glücksburg line, a more junior branch of the royal clan. They were also semi-Salic heirs of Frederick III through a daughter of Frederick V of Denmark&#x27;s, and they were more junior agnatic heirs eligible to succeed in Schleswig-Holstein. These dynasts were Christian of Glücksburg (1818–1906) and his two elder brothers, the younger of whom had sons and daughters.

Prince Christian of Glücksburg (1818–1906) had been a foster grandson of the sonless royal couple Frederick VI and Queen Marie Sophie, and he thus was well known at the royal court. Prince Christian was a nephew of Queen Marie Sophie&#x27;s and descended from a first cousin of Frederick VI. He was brought up as a Dane, having lived in Danish-speaking lands of the royal dynasty, and he never bore arms for German interests against Denmark, as had other princes of the House of Glücksburg and the House of Augustenburg. This made him a relatively attractive royal candidate from the Danish viewpoint since, as a descendant of Frederick III, he was eligible to succeed in Denmark, although not first in line. He was also, but separately, eligible to inherit the dual duchies, but was not first in line either. Christian of Glücksburg also had married Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel, second-eldest daughter of the closest female relative of Frederick VII&#x27;s. Louise&#x27;s mother and brothers, princes of Hesse in Germany, renounced their rights in favor of Louise and her husband. Prince Christian&#x27;s wife thereby became the closest female heiress of Frederick VII&#x27;s. The thorny question of the application of semi-Salic provision in the succession of Denmark was at that point resolved by legislation, through which Prince Christian of Glücksburg was chosen in 1852 to succeed Frederick VII in Denmark.

Frederick VII died in Glücksburg in 1863 following an attack of erysipelas and was interred in Roskilde Cathedral. Christian took the throne as Christian IX.

In November 1863, Frederick of Augustenborg claimed the twin-duchies in succession to Frederick VII of Denmark, who also was the last king of Denmark who, by primogeniture, was also sovereign Duke of Schleswig and Holstein, but whose death extinguished the patriline of Denmark&#x27;s hereditary Oldenburg kings. The resulting divergence of hereditary claims to the duchies eventually developed into the Second War of Schleswig.

==Legacy==
Frederick VII managed to make himself one of the most beloved Danish kings of recent times. This was probably due partially to his relinquishment of absolutism and partially to his personality. In spite of many weaknesses documented by his contemporaries — drinking, eccentric behavior, etc. — he also possessed something of a gift as an actor. He could be both folksy and genuinely hearty, able to appear as a &quot;simple, yet dignified monarch&quot;. During his many travels throughout Denmark, he cultivated contacts with ordinary subjects. He was also a keen antiquarian and according to the later Danish archaeologist P.V. Glob, it was &quot;he, more than anyone else, [who] helped to arouse the wide interest in Danish antiquities&quot;.
