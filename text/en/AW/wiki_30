<text>In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), color confinement, often simply called confinement, is the phenomenon that color-charged particles (such as quarks and gluons) cannot be isolated, and therefore cannot be directly observed in normal conditions below the Hagedorn temperature of approximately 2 terakelvin (corresponding to energies of approximately 130–140 MeV per particle). Quarks and gluons must clump together to form hadrons. The two main types of hadron are the mesons (one quark, one antiquark) and the baryons (three quarks). In addition, colorless glueballs formed only of gluons are also consistent with confinement, though difficult to identify experimentally. Quarks and gluons cannot be separated from their parent hadron without producing new hadrons.

==Origin ==
There is not yet an analytic proof of color confinement in any non-abelian gauge theory. The phenomenon can be understood qualitatively by noting that the force-carrying gluons of QCD have color charge, unlike the photons of quantum electrodynamics (QED). Whereas the electric field between electrically charged particles decreases rapidly as those particles are separated, the gluon field between a pair of color charges forms a narrow flux tube (or string) between them. Because of this behavior of the gluon field, the strong force between the particles is constant regardless of their separation.

Therefore, as two color charges are separated, at some point it becomes energetically favorable for a new quark–antiquark pair to appear, rather than extending the tube further. As a result of this, when quarks are produced in particle accelerators, instead of seeing the individual quarks in detectors, scientists see &quot;jets&quot; of many color-neutral particles (mesons and baryons), clustered together. This process is called &quot;hadronization&quot;, &quot;fragmentation&quot;, or &quot;string breaking&quot;.

The confining phase is usually defined by the behavior of the action of the Wilson loop, which is simply the path in spacetime traced out by a quark–antiquark pair created at one point and annihilated at another point. In a non-confining theory, the action of such a loop is proportional to its perimeter. However, in a confining theory, the action of the loop is instead proportional to its area. Since the area is proportional to the separation of the quark–antiquark pair, free quarks are suppressed. Mesons are allowed in such a picture, since a loop containing another loop with the opposite orientation has only a small area between the two loops. At non-zero temperatures, the order operator for confinement are thermal versions of Wilson loops known as Polyakov loops.

==Confinement scale==
The confinement scale or QCD scale is the scale at which the perturbatively defined strong coupling constant diverges. This is known as the Landau pole. The confinement scale definition and value therefore depend on the renormalization scheme used. For example, in the MS-bar scheme and at 4-loop in the running of formula_1, the world average in the 3-flavour case is given by
:formula_2

When the renormalization group equation is solved exactly, the scale is not defined at all. It is therefore customary to quote the value of the strong coupling constant at a particular reference scale instead.

It is sometimes believed that the sole origin of confinement is the very large value of the strong coupling near the Landau pole. This is sometimes referred as &quot;infrared slavery&quot; (a term chosen to contrast with the ultraviolet freedom). It is however incorrect since in QCD the Landau pole is unphysical, which can be seen by the fact that its position at the confinement scale largely depends on the chosen renormalization scheme, i.e., on a convention. Most evidence points to a moderately large coupling, typically of value 1-3 depending on the choice of renormalization scheme. In contrast to the simple but erroneous mechanism of &quot;infrared slavery&quot;, a large coupling is but one ingredient for color confinement, the other one being that gluons are color-charged and
can therefore collapse into gluon tubes.

==Models exhibiting confinement==
In addition to QCD in four spacetime dimensions, the two-dimensional Schwinger model also exhibits confinement. Compact Abelian gauge theories also exhibit confinement in 2 and 3 spacetime dimensions. Confinement has been found in elementary excitations of magnetic systems called spinons.

If the electroweak symmetry breaking scale were lowered, the unbroken SU(2) interaction would eventually become confining. Alternative models where SU(2) becomes confining above that scale are quantitatively similar to the Standard Model at lower energies, but dramatically different above symmetry breaking.

==Models of fully screened quarks==
Besides the quark confinement idea, there is a potential possibility that the color charge of quarks gets fully screened by the gluonic color surrounding the quark. Exact solutions of SU(3) classical Yang–Mills theory which provide full screening (by gluon fields) of the color charge of a quark have been found. However, such classical solutions do not take into account non-trivial properties of QCD vacuum. Therefore, the significance of such full gluonic screening solutions for a separated quark is not clear.

<text>A shape is a graphical representation of an object&#x27;s form or its external boundary, outline, or external surface. It is distinct from other object properties, such as color, texture, or material type.
In geometry, &quot;shape&quot; excludes information about the object&#x27;s position, size, orientation and chirality.
A figure is a representation including both shape and size (as in, e.g., figure of the Earth).

A plane shape or plane figure is constrained to lie on a &quot;plane&quot;, in contrast to &quot;solid&quot; 3D shapes.
A two-dimensional shape or two-dimensional figure (also: 2D shape or 2D figure) may lie on a more general curved &quot;surface&quot; (a two-dimensional space).

== Classification of simple shapes ==

Some simple shapes can be put into broad categories. For instance, polygons are classified according to their number of edges as triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, etc. Each of these is divided into smaller categories; triangles can be equilateral, isosceles, obtuse, acute, scalene, etc. while quadrilaterals can be rectangles, rhombi, trapezoids, squares, etc.

Other common shapes are points, lines, planes, and conic sections such as ellipses, circles, and parabolas.

Among the most common 3-dimensional shapes are polyhedra, which are shapes with flat faces; ellipsoids, which are egg-shaped or sphere-shaped objects; cylinders; and cones.

If an object falls into one of these categories exactly or even approximately, we can use it to describe the shape of the object. Thus, we say that the shape of a manhole cover is a disk, because it is approximately the same geometric object as an actual geometric disk.

==In geometry==

A geometric shape consists of the geometric information which remains when location, scale, orientation and reflection are removed from the description of a geometric object. That is, the result of moving a shape around, enlarging it, rotating it, or reflecting it in a mirror is the same shape as the original, and not a distinct shape.

Many two-dimensional geometric shapes can be defined by a set of points or vertices and lines connecting the points in a closed chain, as well as the resulting interior points. Such shapes are called polygons and include triangles, squares, and pentagons. Other shapes may be bounded by curves such as the circle or the ellipse. 

Many three-dimensional geometric shapes can be defined by a set of vertices, lines connecting the vertices, and two-dimensional faces enclosed by those lines, as well as the resulting interior points. Such shapes are called polyhedrons 
and include cubes as well as pyramids such as tetrahedrons. Other three-dimensional shapes may be bounded by curved surfaces, such as the ellipsoid and the sphere.

A shape is said to be convex if all of the points on a line segment between any two of its points are also part of the shape.

===Properties===
There are multiple ways to compare the shapes of two objects:
* Congruence: Two objects are &quot;congruent&quot; if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of rotations, translations, and/or reflections.
* Similarity: Two objects are &quot;similar&quot; if one can be transformed into the other by a uniform scaling, together with a sequence of rotations, translations, and/or reflections.
* Isotopy: Two objects are &quot;isotopic&quot; if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of deformations that do not tear the object or put holes in it.

Sometimes, two similar or congruent objects may be regarded as having a different shape if a reflection is required to transform one into the other. For instance, the letters &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are a reflection of each other, and hence they are congruent and similar, but in some contexts they are not regarded as having the same shape. Sometimes, only the outline or external boundary of the object is considered to determine its shape. For instance, a hollow sphere may be considered to have the same shape as a solid sphere. Procrustes analysis is used in many sciences to determine whether or not two objects have the same shape, or to measure the difference between two shapes. In advanced mathematics, quasi-isometry can be used as a criterion to state that two shapes are approximately the same.

Simple shapes can often be classified into basic geometric objects such as a line, a curve, a plane, a plane figure (e.g. square or circle), or a solid figure (e.g. cube or sphere). However, most shapes occurring in the physical world are complex. Some, such as plant structures and coastlines, may be so complicated as to defy traditional mathematical description – in which case they may be analyzed by differential geometry, or as fractals.

Some common shapes include: Circle, Square, Triangle, Rectangle, Oval, Star (polygon), Rhombus, Semicircle.
Regular polygons starting at pentagon follow the naming convention of the Greek derived prefix with &#x27;-gon&#x27; suffix: Pentagon, Hexagon, Heptagon, Octagon, Nonagon, Decagon... See polygon

== Equivalence of shapes ==
In geometry, two subsets of a Euclidean space have the same shape if one can be transformed to the other by a combination of translations, rotations (together also called rigid transformations), and uniform scalings. In other words, the &quot;shape&quot; of a set of points is all the geometrical information that is invariant to translations, rotations, and size changes. Having the same shape is an equivalence relation, and accordingly a precise mathematical definition of the notion of shape can be given as being an equivalence class of subsets of a Euclidean space having the same shape.

Mathematician and statistician David George Kendall writes:
In this paper ‘shape’ is used in the vulgar sense, and means what one would normally expect it to mean. [...] We here define ‘shape’ informally as ‘all the geometrical information that remains when location, scale and rotational effects are filtered out from an object.’

Shapes of physical objects are equal if the subsets of space these objects occupy satisfy the definition above. In particular, the shape does not depend on the size and placement in space of the object. For instance, a &quot;&quot; and a &quot;p&quot; have the same shape, as they can be perfectly superimposed if the &quot;&quot; is translated to the right by a given distance, rotated upside down and magnified by a given factor (see Procrustes superimposition for details). However, a mirror image could be called a different shape. For instance, a &quot;b&quot; and a &quot;p&quot; have a different shape, at least when they are constrained to move within a two-dimensional space like the page on which they are written. Even though they have the same size, there&#x27;s no way to perfectly superimpose them by translating and rotating them along the page. Similarly, within a three-dimensional space, a right hand and a left hand have a different shape, even if they are the mirror images of each other. Shapes may change if the object is scaled non-uniformly. For example, a sphere becomes an ellipsoid when scaled differently in the vertical and horizontal directions. In other words, preserving axes of symmetry (if they exist) is important for preserving shapes. Also, shape is determined by only the outer boundary of an object.

===Congruence and similarity===

Objects that can be transformed into each other by rigid transformations and mirroring (but not scaling) are congruent. An object is therefore congruent to its mirror image (even if it is not symmetric), but not to a scaled version. Two congruent objects always have either the same shape or mirror image shapes, and have the same size.

Objects that have the same shape or mirror image shapes are called geometrically similar, whether or not they have the same size. Thus, objects that can be transformed into each other by rigid transformations, mirroring, and uniform scaling are similar. Similarity is preserved when one of the objects is uniformly scaled, while congruence is not. Thus, congruent objects are always geometrically similar, but similar objects may not be congruent, as they may have different size.

=== Homeomorphism ===

A more flexible definition of shape takes into consideration the fact that realistic shapes are often deformable, e.g. a person in different postures, a tree bending in the wind or a hand with different finger positions.

One way of modeling non-rigid movements is by homeomorphisms. Roughly speaking, a homeomorphism is a continuous stretching and bending of an object into a new shape. Thus, a square and a circle are homeomorphic to each other, but a sphere and a donut are not. An often-repeated mathematical joke is that topologists cannot tell their coffee cup from their donut, since a sufficiently pliable donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while preserving the donut hole in a cup&#x27;s handle. 

A described shape has external lines that you can see and make up the shape. If you were putting your coordinates on a coordinate graph you could draw lines to show where you can see a shape, however not every time you put coordinates in a graph as such you can make a shape. This shape has a outline and boundary so you can see it and is not just regular dots on a regular paper.

=== Shape analysis ===

The above-mentioned mathematical definitions of rigid and non-rigid shape have arisen in the field of statistical shape analysis. In particular, Procrustes analysis is a technique used for comparing shapes of similar objects (e.g. bones of different animals), or measuring the deformation of a deformable object. Other methods are designed to work with non-rigid (bendable) objects, e.g. for posture independent shape retrieval (see for example Spectral shape analysis).

===Similarity classes===
All similar triangles have the same shape. These shapes can be classified using complex numbers , , for the vertices, in a method advanced by J.A. Lester and Rafael Artzy. For example, an equilateral triangle can be expressed by the complex numbers 0, 1, representing its vertices. Lester and Artzy call the ratio
formula_1
the shape of triangle . Then the shape of the equilateral triangle is
formula_2
For any affine transformation of the complex plane, formula_3   a triangle is transformed but does not change its shape. Hence shape is an invariant of affine geometry.
The shape depends on the order of the arguments of function S, but permutations lead to related values. For instance,
formula_4 Also formula_5
Combining these permutations gives formula_6 Furthermore,
formula_7 These relations are &quot;conversion rules&quot; for shape of a triangle.

The shape of a quadrilateral is associated with two complex numbers , . If the quadrilateral has vertices , , , , then and . Artzy proves these propositions about quadrilateral shapes:
# If formula_8 then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
# If a parallelogram has , then it is a rhombus.
# When and , then the quadrilateral is square.
# If formula_9 and , then the quadrilateral is a trapezoid.
A polygon formula_10 has a shape defined by &quot;n&quot; − 2 complex numbers formula_11 The polygon bounds a convex set when all these shape components have imaginary components of the same sign.

== Human perception of shapes ==
Human vision relies on a wide range of shape representations. Some psychologists have theorized that humans mentally break down images into simple geometric shapes (e.g., cones and spheres) called geons. Meanwhile, others have suggested shapes are decomposed into features or dimensions that describe the way shapes tend to vary, like their &quot;segmentability&quot;, &quot;compactness&quot; and &quot;spikiness&quot;. When comparing shape similarity, however, at least 22 independent dimensions are needed to account for the way natural shapes vary. 

There is also clear evidence that shapes guide human attention.

<text>A twig is a thin, often short, branch of a tree or bush.

The buds on the twig are an important diagnostic characteristic, as are the abscission scars where the leaves have fallen away. The color, texture, and patterning of the twig bark are also important, in addition to the thickness and nature of any pith of the twig.

There are two types of twigs: vegetative twigs and fruiting spurs. Fruiting spurs are specialized twigs that generally branch off the sides of branches and are stubby and slow-growing, with many annular ring markings from seasons past. The twig&#x27;s age and rate of growth can be determined by counting the winter terminal bud scale scars, or annular ring marking, across the diameter of the twig.

==Uses==
Twigs can be useful in starting a fire. They can be used as wood, bridging the gap between highly flammable tinder (dry grass and leaves) and firewood. This is due to their high amounts of stored carbon dioxide used in photosynthesis.

Twigs are a feature of tool use by non-humans. For example, chimpanzees have been observed using twigs to go &quot;fishing&quot; for termites, and elephants have been reported using twigs to scratch parts of their ears and mouths which could not be reached by rubbing against a tree.

Acrux is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Crux. It has the Bayer designation α Crucis, which is Latinised to Alpha Crucis and abbreviated Alpha Cru or α Cru. With a combined visual magnitude of +0.76, it is the 13th-brightest star in the night sky. It is the most southerly star of the asterism known as the Southern Cross and is the southernmost first-magnitude star, 2.3 degrees more southerly than Alpha Centauri. This system is located at a distance of 321 light-years from the Sun.

To the naked eye Acrux appears as a single star, but it is actually a multiple star system containing six components. Through optical telescopes, Acrux appears as a triple star, whose two brightest components are visually separated by about 4 arcseconds and are known as Acrux A and Acrux B, α1 Crucis and α2 Crucis, or α Crucis A and α Crucis B. Both components are B-type stars, and are many times more massive and luminous than the Sun. This system was the second ever to be recognized as a binary, in 1685 by a Jesuit priest. α1 Crucis is itself a spectroscopic binary with components designated α Crucis Aa (officially named Acrux, historically the name of the entire system) and α Crucis Ab. Its two component stars orbit every 76 days at a separation of about 1 astronomical unit (AU). HR 4729, also known as Acrux C, is a more distant companion, forming a triple star through small telescopes. C is also a spectroscopic binary, which brings the total number of stars in the system to at least five.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;α Crucis&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Crucis&quot;) is the system&#x27;s Bayer designation; &quot;α1&quot; and &quot;α2 Crucis&quot;, those of its two main components stars. The designations of these two constituents as &quot;Acrux A&quot; and &quot;Acrux B&quot; and those of &quot;A&#x27;s&quot; components—&quot;Acrux Aa&quot; and &quot;Acrux Ab&quot;—derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

The historical name &quot;Acrux&quot; for &quot;α1 Crucis&quot; is an &quot;Americanism&quot; coined in the 19th century, but entering common use only by the mid 20th century. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN states that in the case of multiple stars the name should be understood to be attributed to the brightest component by visual brightness. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Acrux&quot; for the star &quot;Acrux Aa&quot; on 20 July 2016 and it is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

Since Acrux is at −63° declination, making it the southernmost first-magnitude star, it is only visible south of latitude 27° North. It barely rises from cities such as Miami, United States, or Karachi, Pakistan (both around 25°N) and not at all from New Orleans, United States, or Cairo, Egypt (both about 30°N). Because of Earth&#x27;s axial precession, the star was visible to ancient Hindu astronomers in India who named it &quot;Tri-shanku&quot;. It was also visible to the ancient Romans and Greeks, who regarded it as part of the constellation of Centaurus.

In Chinese, (, &quot;Cross&quot;), refers to an asterism consisting of Acrux, Mimosa, Gamma Crucis and Delta Crucis. Consequently, Acrux itself is known as (, &quot;the Second Star of Cross&quot;).

This star is known as &quot;Estrela de Magalhães&quot; (&quot;Star of Magellan&quot;) in Portuguese.

==Stellar properties==

The two components, α1 and α2 Crucis, are separated by 4 arcseconds. α1 is magnitude 1.40 and α2 is magnitude 2.09, both early class B stars, with surface temperatures of about 28,000 and , respectively. Their luminosities are 25,000 and 16,000 times that of the Sun. α1 and α2 orbit over such a long period that motion is only barely seen. From their minimum separation of 430 astronomical units, the period is estimated to be around 1,500 years.

α1 is itself a spectroscopic binary star, with its components thought to be around 14 and 10 times the mass of the Sun and orbiting in only 76 days at a separation of about . The masses of α2 and the brighter component of α1 suggest that the stars will someday expand into blue and red supergiants (similar to Betelgeuse and Antares) before exploding as supernovae. Component Ab may perform electron capture in the degenerate O+Ne+Mg core and trigger a supernova explosion, otherwise it will become a massive white dwarf.

Photometry with the TESS satellite has shown that one of the stars in the α Crucis system is a β Cephei variable, although α1 and α2 Crucis are too close for TESS to resolve and determine which one is the pulsator.

Rizzuto and colleagues determined in 2011 that the α Crucis system was 66% likely to be a member of the Lower Centaurus–Crux sub-group of the Scorpius–Centaurus association. It was not previously seen to be a member of the group. A bow shock is present around α Crucis, and is visible in the infrared spectrum, but is not aligned with α Crucis; the bow shock likely formed from large-scale motions in the interstellar matter.

The cooler, less-luminous B-class star HR 4729 (HD 108250) lies 90 arcseconds away from triple star system α Crucis and shares its motion through space, suggesting it may be gravitationally bound to it, and it is therefore generally assumed to be physically associated. It is itself a spectroscopic binary system, sometimes catalogued as component C (Acrux C) of the Acrux multiple system. Another fainter visual companion listed as component D or Acrux D. A further seven faint stars are also listed as companions out to a distance of about two arc-minutes.

On 2 October 2008, the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft resolved three of the components (A, B and C) of the multiple star system as Saturn&#x27;s disk occulted it.


== In culture ==

Acrux is represented in the flags of Australia, New Zealand, Samoa, and Papua New Guinea as one of five stars that compose the Southern Cross. It is also featured in the flag of Brazil, along with 26 other stars, each of which represents a state; Acrux represents the state of São Paulo. As of 2015, it is also represented on the cover of the Brazilian passport.

The Brazilian oceanographic research vessel &quot;Alpha Crucis&quot; is named after the star.

<text>Neil James Innes (; 9 December 1944 – 29 December 2019) was an English writer, comedian and musician. He first came to prominence in the comedy rock group the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and later became a frequent collaborator with the Monty Python troupe on their BBC television series and films, and is often called the &quot;seventh Python&quot; along with performer Carol Cleveland. He co-created the Rutles, a Beatles parody/pastiche project, with Python Eric Idle, and wrote the band&#x27;s songs. He also wrote and voiced the 1980s ITV children&#x27;s cartoon adventures of &quot;The Raggy Dolls&quot;.

==Early life==
Innes was born in Danbury in Essex. His Scottish father was a warrant officer in the British Army, and Innes spent his childhood in West Germany where his father was deployed with the British Army of the Rhine. He took piano lessons from age 7 to 14 and taught himself to play guitar. His parents were supportive of their children&#x27;s artistic leanings, and his father also drew and painted. After returning to the United Kingdom, Innes received his formal education at Thorpe Grammar School, the Norwich School of Art and Goldsmiths College, London, where he studied fine art. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Fine Art from Goldsmiths in 1966.

==Career==
===The Bonzo Dog (Doo-Dah) Band===
While still at Goldsmiths, Innes joined a semi-professional college band originally called the Bonzo Dog Dada Band (after Bonzo the dog, an illustrated cartoon character from the 1920s, and the art movement Dada), which was later renamed the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band after the group tired of constantly explaining the concept of Dada to confused onlookers (and later still the band name was officially shortened to the Bonzo Dog Band). At this point the band, which then had a revolving membership of anything up to a dozen players at a time, largely performed a dada-influenced, deliberately shambolic, comedic repertoire of trad-jazz cover versions at local public houses and college events, to the delight and occasional bemusement of audiences. 

Innes had met the band&#x27;s co-founders Vivian Stanshall and Rodney Slater some time earlier when they and bandmate &quot;Legs&quot; Larry Smith were studying at the Central School of Art, but Innes&#x27; official entry into the band was actually facilitated by his then-landlord and college tutor, Vernon Dudley Bohay Nowell, who happened to be the band&#x27;s bass guitarist at the time. Innes&#x27; induction into the band proved to be fundamental to their eventual success when he brought a more focused and disciplined musical direction to their efforts, with his talents as a composer, arranger and multi-instrumentalist. At the band&#x27;s creative peak in 1968 and 1969, Innes, alone and together with Stanshall, composed most of the band&#x27;s original material, including his solo composition (and sole Bonzos hit) &quot;I&#x27;m the Urban Spaceman&quot;, (produced by Apollo C. Vermouth, a collective alias for Paul McCartney and Gus Dudgeon), and &quot;Death Cab for Cutie&quot; (with lyrics by Stanshall), which featured in the Beatles&#x27; film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; (1967). Innes won an Ivor Novello Award for Best Novel(ty) Song in 1968 for &quot;I&#x27;m the Urban Spaceman&quot;.

During the same creatively-fertile 1968/69 period, Innes and the Bonzo Dog Band also appeared each week in both seasons of the British children&#x27;s television series &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; which also featured future Monty Python members Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam. Although initially intended to appeal solely to children, the show&#x27;s surreal and absurdist nature soon also attracted a large adult following.

After the break-up of the Bonzo Dog Band in early 1970, Innes joined with former Dog Band bassist Dennis Cowan, drummer Ian Wallace and guitarist Roger McKew to form The World, a band hoping for &quot;more commercial&quot; success with music ranging from rock to pure pop, yet still retaining some Doo-Dah style and even some of the humour. However, by the time their first and only album, &quot;Lucky Planet&quot;, was released in late 1970 the members had already disbanded and were moving on to other projects.

===GRIMMS and Monty Python===
The 1970s proved to be a highly prolific decade for Innes as a solo artist, band member and live stage and television performer.

In 1971, Innes briefly reunited with most of his former Bonzo Dog Band colleagues to record their reunion/contractual obligation album &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Up and Be Friendly&quot;, and he, Vivian Stanshall and Dennis Cowan also formed a short-lived touring band named Freaks with Keith Moon on drums. This in turn led Innes and Stanshall to a union with The Scaffold and other musicians, poets and performers later that year as GRIMMS. While Stanshall effectively bowed out of this group soon after its formation, Innes remained as one of the permanent core members for the next five years, working with Andy Roberts, Roger McGough, John Gorman, Mike McGear, Dave Richards, Brian Patten, Adrian Henri, John Megginson, future Rutles bandmates Ollie Halsall and John Halsey, and Gerry Conway (among many others). Although GRIMMS was initially conceived purely as a touring revue-type ensemble, early 1973 saw the release of their self-titled live album, followed by a second studio-recorded album &quot;Rockin&#x27; Duck&quot; at the end of the same year. GRIMMS remained an informal enough setup throughout this period to allow the various members to come and go as they pleased and continue with their own outside musical, performing and literary careers, and in 1973 Innes also recorded his debut solo album &quot;How Sweet To Be An Idiot&quot;, aided and abetted by various GRIMMS. The group also undertook regular and extensive tours of the UK university and theatre circuit throughout its existence, releasing a book of humorous poetry, lyrics and photographs in 1974 entitled &quot;Clowns On The Road&quot; detailing some of their experiences. The final GRIMMS studio LP &quot;Sleepers&quot; was released in 1976, after which their activities as a group ceased.

In the mid-1970s, Innes became closely associated with the Monty Python team, having first worked with Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle on the 1960s television show &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot;. He contributed music to the Monty Python albums &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Previous Record&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief&quot; (1973), and played a major role in performing and writing songs and sketches for their final TV series in 1974, after John Cleese temporarily left the troupe. He wrote a squib of a song called &quot;George III&quot; for the episode &quot;The Golden Age of Ballooning&quot;, which was sung by the Flirtations but billed onscreen as the Ronettes. He also wrote the song &quot;When Does a Dream Begin?&quot;, used in &quot;Anything Goes: The Light Entertainment War&quot;. He co-wrote the &quot;Most Awful Family in Britain&quot; sketch and played a humorous stilted guitar version of the theme song, &quot;The Liberty Bell&quot; march, during the credits of the last episode, &quot;Party Political Broadcast&quot;. He is one of only two non-Pythons ever to be credited writers for the TV series, the other being Douglas Adams (who co-wrote the &quot;Patient Abuse&quot; sketch, also featured in &quot;Party Political Broadcast&quot;).

He appeared on stage with the Pythons in the UK and Canada in 1973, in London in 1974 and in New York City in 1976, performing the Bob Dylanesque &quot;Protest Song&quot; (complete with harmonica) on the album &quot;Monty Python Live at City Center&quot;. He was introduced as Raymond Scum. After his introduction he told the audience, &quot;I&#x27;ve suffered for my music. Now it&#x27;s your turn.&quot; In 1980, he travelled to the States with the Pythons again, subsequently appearing in &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;. He performed the songs &quot;How Sweet to Be an Idiot&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m the Urban Spaceman&quot;. He also appeared as one of the singing &quot;Bruces&quot; in the Philosopher Sketch and as a Church Policeman in the &quot;Salvation Fuzz&quot; sketch.

Innes wrote original songs for the film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975), such as &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; and &quot;Brave Sir Robin&quot;. He appeared in the film as a head-bashing monk, the serf crushed by the giant wooden rabbit, and the leader of Sir Robin&#x27;s minstrels. He also had small roles in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (1977) and &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; (1979), and performed the whistling on the latter&#x27;s hit song, &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;. His collaborations with Monty Python and other artists were documented in the musical film &quot;The Seventh Python&quot; (2008), which premiered at the Mods &amp; Rockers Film Festival on 26 June 2008.

===Rutland Weekend Television, The Rutles, and The Innes Book of Records===
After Monty Python finished its original run on UK television, Innes joined Eric Idle on the series &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot;. This was a Pythonesque sketch show based in a fictional low-budget regional television station, which ran for two seasons in 1975–76. Songs and sketches from the series appeared on a 1976 BBC LP, &quot;The Rutland Weekend Songbook&quot;. One short sketch on the show spawned the Rutles (the &quot;prefab four&quot;), which was an affectionate pastiche of the Beatles. In the sketch Innes portrayed the character of Ron Nasty, a character based on John Lennon, while Idle portrayed Dirk McQuickly (a character based on Paul McCartney), and the fictional group briefly performed &#x27;I Must Be In Love&#x27;, a suitably Beatlesque pastiche written by Innes.

Eric Idle later played a videotape of the Rutles sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1976 during an appearance as guest host, and the favourable response led to a 1978 American-made spin-off TV movie, &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot;, with Innes and Idle again playing Nasty and McQuickly. While Idle and Innes co-created the original Rutles sketch concept, Idle wrote the screenplay for the film on his own, and Innes composed all of the songs for the project without any input from Idle (Dirk McQuickly&#x27;s musical contributions on the soundtrack were performed by guitarist/vocalist Ollie Halsall while Idle lip-synched them in the film). Innes&#x27; songs consequently appeared on the soundtrack album &quot;The Rutles&quot;, released by Warner Bros in 1978.

The songs written by Innes so closely pastiched the original source material that he was taken to court by the owners of the Beatles&#x27; catalogue. Innes had to testify under oath that he had not listened to the songs at all while composing the Rutles&#x27; songs, but had created them completely originally based on what he remembered various songs by the Beatles sounding like at different times. However the court ruled in favour of ATV music and imposed co-writing credits and royalties. Many years later, Innes&#x27; own music publisher demanded a co-writing credit for Innes from Beatles-influenced band Oasis, for their 1994 song &quot;Whatever&quot;, as it directly lifted parts of its melody from Innes&#x27; 1973 song &quot;How Sweet to Be an Idiot&quot;. This event was subsequently referenced in the Rutles&#x27; song &quot;Shangri-La&quot; on their 1996 reunion album &quot;The Rutles Archaeology&quot;, which was itself a parody of &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;.

After &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot;, Innes made a solo series in 1979 on BBC television, &quot;The Innes Book of Records&quot;, which ran for three series until 1981. The series offered an early example of music-video presentation, albeit on a shoestring BBC budget, centred around new recordings and alternate versions of many of Innes&#x27; older compositions along with new material written specially for the show. In keeping with Innes&#x27; usual whimsically surreal style, each episode was linked by a loose and often absurdist theme and also featured an eccentric guest performer (such as Stanley Unwin or Percy Edwards) or musician (such as Ivor Cutler or Jake Thackray). Innes&#x27; former bandmate Vivian Stanshall also appeared in one episode, reciting his own surrealist monologue about the English seaside.

===Other television work===

During the 1980s, Innes delved into children&#x27;s entertainment. This new career path began when he took over from Tom Baker as host of Yorkshire TV&#x27;s &quot;The Book Tower&quot; for the ITV network. He went on to play the role of the Magician in the live-action children&#x27;s television series &quot;Puddle Lane&quot;, also made by Yorkshire Television. He also wrote and voiced the 1980s children&#x27;s cartoon adventures of &quot;The Raggy Dolls&quot;, a motley collection of &quot;rejects&quot; from a toy factory. The 65 episodes for Yorkshire Television included the characters Sad Sack, Hi-Fi, Lucy, Dotty, Back-to-Front, Princess and Claude.

He also composed and performed original music and songs for children&#x27;s television, including &quot;Puddle Lane&quot;, &quot;The Raggy Dolls&quot;, &quot;The Riddlers&quot; and &quot;Tumbledown Farm&quot;. He brought Monty Python&#x27;s Terry Jones&#x27;s book &quot;Fairy Tales&quot; to television as &quot;East of the Moon&quot;. He contributed all the stories and music on this production. He was also involved with the popular children&#x27;s show &quot;Tiswas&quot;.

Also, during the 1980s, Innes wrote and performed incidental music and songs for the BBC TV series, &quot;Jane&quot;. &quot;Jane&quot; was a short-form drama series which was shown nightly in 10-minute segments. The weekly episodes were edited together and broadcast in a 50-minute version on Saturday evening.

===Reunion concerts===

At the time of &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; CDs, there was a revival of interest in the Rutles and a new album was released in 1996 entitled &quot;Archaeology&quot;.

In 1998, Innes hosted a 13-episode television series for Anglia Television, called &quot;Away with Words&quot;, in which he travelled to different areas of Britain to explore the origins of well-known words and phrases.

Innes took part, along with the remaining Monty Python members, in the 2002 Concert for George, in memory of George Harrison.

Innes was occasionally heard (often as the butt of jokes) standing in as the pianist for the BBC Radio 4 panel game &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;.

Innes toured the UK in 2006 and produced a new Bonzo CD as part of the Bonzo Dog Band&#x27;s 40th Anniversary tour. In 2008 he undertook the Neil Innes and Fatso 30th Anniversary tour, playing predominantly Rutles numbers with a few Bonzos and Python items.

===The Idiot Bastard Band===
In late 2010, Innes announced the formation of the Idiot Bastard Band, a comedy musical collective featuring himself, Adrian Edmondson, Phill Jupitus, Simon Brint and Rowland Rivron. The band debuted, with an 8-week residency, at the Wilmington Arms in Clerkenwell, London in December, playing a range of comedy songs old and new, with deliberately little rehearsal.

New concerts were scheduled in 2011. Jupitus was unable to attend due to prior commitments and was replaced by several special guests, including Paul Whitehouse, Barry Cryer and Nigel Planer. Following the death of Brint, the band performed a further tour in 2012. The band&#x27;s name is a play on Frank Zappa&#x27;s song The Idiot Bastard Son.

==Personal life and death==

While a student at Goldsmiths College, London, in the mid-1960s Innes met Yvonne Catherine Hilton; they married on 3 March 1966. The couple had three sons, Miles (b. 1967), Luke (b. 1971), and Barney (b. 1978).

Innes died of a heart attack on 29 December 2019 at Montcuq, Lot, France, where he had lived for several years. Fellow entertainers, including John Cleese and Stephen Fry, paid tribute to him. &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; star Mark Gatiss also paid tribute to Innes. Comedian Diane Morgan called him &quot;one of the nicest people I&#x27;ve ever met and a towering talent,&quot; and director Edgar Wright said he was &quot;forever a fan&quot; of Innes.

On 28 November 2024, a one-off concert &quot;A Celebration of the life of Neil Innes: &#x27;How Sweet To Be An Idiot&#x27;&quot; was held at the Indigo at The O2 in London, featuring Innes&#x27;s music played by colleagues and admirers, as well as poetry and comedy. Artists included John Altman, Charlie Dore, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam, Maddy Prior, Adrian Edmondson, Tom McGuinness, Roger McGough, Yo La Tengo, Terrafolk, Andy Roberts, &quot;Legs&quot; Larry Smith, Luke Innes, Kevin Eldon, Isabella Coulstock, Joe Stilgoe, The Rutles and Emo Philips among others, and the event was hosted by Sanjeev Bhaskar and Martin Lewis. Pre-recorded tributes from Stephen Fry, Aimee Mann and Rick Wakeman were also shown.

<text>Russian Ark () is a 2002 experimental historical drama film directed by Alexander Sokurov. The plot follows an unnamed narrator, who wanders through the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, and implies that he died in some horrible accident and is a ghost drifting through. In each room, he encounters various real and fictional people from various periods in the city&#x27;s 300-year history. He is accompanied by &quot;the European&quot;, who represents the Marquis de Custine, a 19th-century French traveler.

An international co-production between Russia and Germany, &quot;Russian Ark&quot; was shot entirely in the Winter Palace of the Russian State Hermitage Museum on 23 December 2001, using a one-take single 87-minute Steadicam sequence shot. It extensively uses the fourth wall device, but repeatedly broken and re-erected. At times, the narrator and the companion interact with the other performers, while at other times they pass unnoticed.

The film was entered into the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.

== Plot ==
On a winter&#x27;s day, a small party of men and women arrive by horse-drawn carriage to a minor side entrance of the Winter Palace, dressed in the style of the early 19th century to attend a ball hosted by the Emperor Alexander I. The narrator (whose point of view is always in first-person) meets another spectral but visible outsider, &quot;the European&quot;, and follows him through numerous rooms of the palace. &quot;The European&quot;, a 19th-century French diplomat who appears to be the Marquis de Custine, has nothing but contempt for Russians; he tells the narrator that they are unable to create or appreciate beauty as &quot;Europeans&quot; do, as demonstrated by the European treasures around him. Each room manifests a different period of Russian history, although the periods are not in chronological order.

Featured are Peter the Great harassing and striking one of his generals; a spectacular presentation of operas and plays in the era of Catherine the Great; an imperial audience in which Tsar Nicholas I is offered a formal apology by the Shah of Persia, represented by his grandson Khosrow Mirza, for the death of ambassador Alexander Griboyedov in 1829; the idyllic family life of Tsar Nicholas II&#x27;s children; the ceremonial changing of the various regiments of the Imperial Guard; contemporary tourists visiting the palace; the museum&#x27;s director whispering the need to make repairs during the rule of Joseph Stalin; and a desperate Leningrader making his own coffin during the 900-day siege of the city during World War II.

A grand ball follows, held in the Nicholas Hall, with many of the participants in spectacular period costume and a full orchestra conducted by Valery Gergiev featuring music by Mikhail Glinka, then a long final exit with a crowd down the grand staircase. The European tells the narrator that he belongs here, in the world of 1913 where everything is still beautiful and elegant, and does not want to go any further. The narrator then walks backwards out the hallway and sees many people from different time periods exiting the building together. As he watches them, the narrator quietly departs the procession, leaves the building through a side door and looks out upon the River Neva.

== Cast ==

* Alexander Sokurov as Narrator
* Sergei Dontsov (Sergey Dreyden) as the European (Marquis de Custine)
* Mariya Kuznetsova as Catherine the Great
* Maksim Sergeyev as Peter the Great
* Anna Aleksakhina as Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)
* Vladimir Baranov as Nicholas II
* Svetlana Svirko as Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)

== Production ==

The film displays 33 rooms of the museum, which are filled with a cast of over 2,000 actors and three orchestras. &quot;Russian Ark&quot; was recorded in uncompressed high-definition video using a Sony HDW-F900 camera. The information was not recorded compressed to tape as usual, but uncompressed onto a hard disk which could hold 100 minutes which was carried behind the cameraman as he traveled from room to room, scene to scene. According to &quot;In One Breath: Alexander Sokurov&#x27;s Russian Ark&quot;, the documentary on the making of the film, four attempts were made. The first failed at the five-minute mark. After two more failed attempts, they were left with only enough battery power for one final take. The four hours of daylight available were also nearly gone. Fortunately, the final take was a success and the film was completed at 90 minutes. Tilman Büttner, the director of photography and Steadicam operator, executed the shot on 23 December 2001.

In a 2002 interview, Büttner said that film sound was recorded separately. &quot;Every time I did the take, or someone else made a mistake, I would curse, and that would have gotten in, so we did the sound later.&quot; Lighting directors of photography on the film were Bernd Fischer and Anatoli Radionov. The director later rejected Büttner&#x27;s nomination for a European Film Academy award, believing that only the whole film should gain an award.

== Post-production ==

In post-production the uncompressed HD 87-minute one-shot could be reworked in detail: besides many object removals (mainly cables and other film equipment), compositings (e.g. additional snow or fog), stabilisations, selective colour-corrections and digitally added focus changes, the whole film was continuously and dynamically reframed (resized) and for certain moments even time-warped (slowed down and sped up). This work took several weeks and was mainly executed by editor Patrick Wilfert under supervision of lead editor Sergei Ivanov on Discreet Logic&#x27;s Inferno system. Avoiding any playouts and using framestore to framestore transfers only, the picture was left uncompressed, before being reprinted onto filmstock for theatrical distribution.

== Background ==
The narrator&#x27;s guide, &quot;the European&quot;, is based on the book by the French aristocrat Marquis de Custine, who visited Russia in 1839 and wrote &quot;La Russie en 1839&quot;, in which he depicted Russia in extremely unflattering terms. A few biographical elements from Custine&#x27;s life are shown in the film. Like the European, the Marquis&#x27; mother was friends with the Italian sculptor Canova and he himself was very religious. Custine&#x27;s book mocks Russian civilization as a thin veneer of Europe on an Asiatic soul. For Custine, Europe was &quot;civilization&quot; while Asia was &quot;barbarism&quot;, and his placing of Russia as a part of Asia rather than Europe was meant to deny that Russians had any sort of civilization worthy of the name. Echoing this sentiment, the film&#x27;s European comments that Russia is a theater and that the people he meets are actors. The Marquis&#x27;s family fortune came from a porcelain works, hence the European&#x27;s interest in the Sèvres porcelain waiting for the diplomatic reception. At the end of the film, which depicts the last imperial ball in 1913, the European appears to accept Russia as a European nation.

&quot;In One Breath&quot;, a documentary about the making of &quot;Russian Ark&quot;, written and directed by Knut Elstermann, gives more insight into the single long shot tracking techniques and formidable organization behind the making of the film.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===

&quot;Russian Ark&quot; is a German-Russian co-production. The film grossed $3,048,997 in the United States and Canada, with $5,641,171 internationally, for a worldwide total of $8,690,168.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Russian Ark&quot; received high critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 89% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 109 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The consensus review summary reads, &quot;As successful as it is ambitious, &quot;Russian Ark&quot; condenses three centuries of Russian history into a single, uninterrupted, 87-minute take.&quot; On Metacritic, which uses an average of critics&#x27; reviews, the film has an 86/100 rating based on 32 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;Apart from anything else, this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen... [T]he effect of the unbroken flow of images (experimented with in the past by directors like Hitchcock and Max Ophüls) is uncanny. If cinema is sometimes dreamlike, then every edit is an awakening. &quot;Russian Ark&quot; spins a daydream made of centuries.&quot;

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked the film 84th in its list of the best films of the 2000s. In a critics&#x27; and readers&#x27; poll by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, it was voted the 358th greatest film of all time.

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Russian Ark&quot; received the Visions Award at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival, a Special Citation at the 2003 San Francisco Film Critics Circle Awards and the 2004 Silver Condor Award for Best Foreign Film from the Argentine Film Critics Association; it was also nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, the Golden Hugo at the 2002 Chicago International Film Festival and the 2004 Nika Award for Best Film. In addition, Alexander Sokurov was named Best Director at Fancine in 2003 and was nominated for the 2002 European Film Award for Best Director. Cinematographer Tilman Büttner was also nominated for various awards for his work on the film, including a European Film Award for Best Cinematographer and a German Camera Award.

<doc id="169208" wikidata="Q30198" url="?curid=169208" title="Marsh">
<text>In ecology, a marsh is a wetland that is dominated by herbaceous plants rather than by woody plants. More in general, the word can be used for any low-lying and seasonally waterlogged terrain. In Europe and in agricultural literature low-lying meadows that require draining and embanked polderlands are also referred to as marshes or marshland.

Marshes can often be found at the edges of lakes and streams, where they form a transition between the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They are often dominated by grasses, rushes or reeds. If woody plants are present they tend to be low-growing shrubs, and the marsh is sometimes called a carr. This form of vegetation is what differentiates marshes from other types of wetland such as swamps, which are dominated by trees, and mires, which are wetlands that have accumulated deposits of acidic peat.

Marshes provide habitats for many kinds of invertebrates, fish, amphibians, waterfowl and aquatic mammals. This biological productivity means that marshes contain 0.1% of global sequestered terrestrial carbon. Moreover, they have an outsized influence on climate resilience of coastal areas and waterways, absorbing high tides and other water changes due to extreme weather. Though some marshes are expected to migrate upland, most natural marshlands will be threatened by sea level rise and associated erosion.

==Basic information==

Marshes provide a habitat for many species of plants, animals, and insects that have adapted to living in flooded conditions or other environments. The plants must be able to survive in wet mud with low oxygen levels. Many of these plants, therefore, have aerenchyma, channels within the stem that allow air to move from the leaves into the rooting zone. Marsh plants also tend to have rhizomes for underground storage and reproduction. Common examples include cattails, sedges, papyrus and sawgrass. Aquatic animals, from fish to salamanders, are generally able to live with a low amount of oxygen in the water. Some can obtain oxygen from the air instead, while others can live indefinitely in conditions of low oxygen. The pH in marshes tends to be neutral to alkaline, as opposed to bogs, where peat accumulates under more acid conditions.

== Values and ecosystem services ==
Marshes provide habitats for many kinds of invertebrates, fish, amphibians, waterfowl and aquatic mammals. Marshes have extremely high levels of biological production, some of the highest in the world, and therefore are important in supporting fisheries.

Marshes also improve water quality by acting as a sink to filter pollutants and sediment from the water that flows through them. Marshes partake in water purification by providing nutrient and pollution consumption. Marshes (and other wetlands) are able to absorb water during periods of heavy rainfall and slowly release it into waterways and therefore reduce the magnitude of flooding. Marshes also provide the services of tourism, recreation, education, and research.

==Types of marshes==

Marshes differ depending mainly on their location and salinity. These factors greatly influence the range and scope of animal and plant life that can survive and reproduce in these environments. The three main types of marsh are salt marshes, freshwater tidal marshes, and freshwater marshes. These three can be found worldwide, and each contains a different set of organisms.

===Salt marshes===
Saltwater marshes are found around the world in mid to high latitudes, wherever there are sections of protected coastline. They are located close enough to the shoreline that the motion of the tides affects them, and, sporadically, they are covered with water. They flourish where the rate of sediment buildup is greater than the rate at which the land level is sinking. Salt marshes are dominated by specially adapted rooted vegetation, primarily salt-tolerant grasses.

Salt marshes are most commonly found in lagoons, estuaries, and on the sheltered side of a shingle or sandspit. The currents there carry the fine particles around to the quiet side of the spit, and sediment begins to build up. These locations allow the marshes to absorb the excess nutrients from the water running through them before they reach the oceans and estuaries. These marshes are slowly declining. Coastal development and urban sprawl have caused significant loss of these essential habitats.

===Freshwater tidal marshes===

Although considered a freshwater marsh, the ocean tides affect this form of marsh. However, without the stresses of salinity at work in its saltwater counterpart, the diversity of the plants and animals that live in and use freshwater tidal marshes is much higher than in salt marshes. The most severe threats to this form of marsh are the increasing size and pollution of the cities surrounding them.

===Freshwater marshes===

Ranging greatly in size and geographic location, freshwater marshes make up North America&#x27;s most common form of wetland. They are also the most diverse of the three types of marsh. Some examples of freshwater marsh types in North America are:

====Wet meadows====
Wet meadows occur in shallow lake basins, low-lying depressions, and the land between shallow marshes and upland areas. They also happen on the edges of large lakes and rivers. Wet meadows often have very high plant diversity and high densities of buried seeds. They are regularly flooded but are often dry in the summer.

====Vernal pools====
Vernal pools are a type of marsh found only seasonally in shallow depressions in the land. They can be covered in shallow water, but in the summer and fall, they can be completely dry. In western North America, vernal pools tend to form in open grasslands, whereas in the east, they often occur in forested landscapes. Further south, vernal pools form in pine savannas and flatwoods. Many amphibian species depend upon vernal pools for spring breeding; these ponds provide a habitat free from fish, which eat the eggs and young of amphibians. An example is the endangered gopher frog. Similar temporary ponds occur in other world ecosystems, where they may have local names. However, vernal pool can be applied to all such temporary pool ecosystems.

====Playa lakes====
Playa lakes are a form of shallow freshwater marsh in the southern high plains of the United States. Like vernal pools, they are only present at certain times of the year and generally have a circular shape. As the playa dries during the summer, conspicuous plant zonation develops along the shoreline.

===Prairie potholes===
Prairie potholes are found in northern North America, such as the Prairie Pothole Region. Glaciers once covered these landscapes, and as a result, shallow depressions were formed in great numbers. These depressions fill with water in the spring. They provide important breeding habitats for many species of waterfowl. Some pools only occur seasonally, while others retain enough water to be present all year.

=== Riverine wetlands ===
Many kinds of marsh occur along the fringes of large rivers. The different types are produced by factors such as water level, nutrients, ice scour, and waves.

===Embanked marshlands===

Large tracts of tidal marsh have been embanked and artificially drained. They are usually known by the Dutch name of polders. In Northern Germany and Scandinavia they are called &quot;Marschland&quot;, &quot;Marsch&quot; or &quot;marsk&quot;; in France &quot;marais maritime&quot;. In the Netherlands and Belgium, they are designated as marine clay districts. In East Anglia, a region in the East of England, the embanked marshes are also known as Fens.

==Restoration==
Some areas have already lost 90% of their wetlands, including marshes. They have been drained to create agricultural land or filled to accommodate urban sprawl. Restoration is returning marshes to the landscape to replace those lost in the past. Restoration can be done on a large scale, such as by allowing rivers to flood naturally in the spring, or on a small scale by returning wetlands to urban landscapes.

==19th century in film==

Before Muybridge&#x27;s 1878 work, photo sequences were not recorded in real-time because light-sensitive emulsions needed a long exposure time. The sequences were basically made as time-lapse recordings. It is possible that people at the time actually viewed such photographs come to life with a phénakisticope or zoetrope (this certainly happened with Muybridge&#x27;s work).

* 1826 – &quot;View from the Window at Le Gras&quot;, Nicéphore Niépce takes the oldest known extant photograph.
* 1833 – Since 1833 onwards, &#x27;animated films&#x27; or rather animated effects began to be made with the use of phénakisticopes, zoetropes, and praxinoscopes.
* 1865 – &quot;Revolving&quot;, self-portrait by French photographer Nadar. Around 1865 he produced this series of self-portraits consisting of 12 frames showing different angles of him sitting still in a chair. Except for a smile in 1 frame, not even a fold in his jacket or a single hair seems to change between the different angles. The portrait could be regarded as a predecessor to the chronophotography which Marey and Muybridge started to experiment with more than 10 years later. As the sequence revolves around space rather than time it is even more related to the bullet-time effect popularized by &quot;The Matrix&quot; about 135 years later. There is no clue if more than one camera was used in the shoot, but it is certainly well-executed.

==1870s==

* 1874 – &quot;Passage de Vénus&quot;, first precedent of a film; On December 9, 1874, French astronomer Pierre Janssen and Brazilian engineer Francisco Antônio de Almeida using Janssen&#x27;s &#x27;photographic revolver&#x27; photograph the transit of the planet Venus across the Sun. They were purportedly taken in Japan. It is the oldest film on IMDb.
* 1878 –
** &quot;The Horse in Motion;&quot; British photographer Eadweard Muybridge took a series of &quot;automatic electro-photographs&quot; depicting the movement of a horse. He shot the photographs in June 1878. An additional card reprinted the single image of the horse &quot;Occident&quot; trotting at high speed, which had previously been published by Muybridge in 1877. The most famous of these electro-photographs is &quot;Sallie Gardner&quot; taken on June 19, 1878. Railroad tycoon Leland Stanford hired Muybridge to settle the questions of whether a galloping horse ever has all four of its feet off the ground. Muybridge&#x27;s photos showed the horse with all four feet off the ground. He went on a lecture tour showing his photographs on a moving-image device he called the zoopraxiscope.
** &quot;Le singe musicien&quot;, first animated movie using the praxinoscope

==1880s==

*1885 – American inventors George Eastman and Hannibal Goodwin each invented a sensitized celluloid base roll photographic film to replace the glass plates then in use. &quot;L&#x27;homme Machine&quot;, was directed by French scientist Étienne-Jules Marey; it is the oldest black and white animated known film.
*1886 – Louis Le Prince was granted an American dual-patent for a 16-lens device which combines a motion picture camera with a projector.
*1887 – &quot;Man Walking Around a Corner&quot;, directed by French inventor Louis Le Prince; It is the oldest known film. Although according to David Wilkinson&#x27;s 2015 documentary &quot;The First Film&quot; it is not film, but a series of photographs, 16 in all, each taken from one of the lens from Le Prince&#x27;s camera. Pictures from the film were sent in a letter dated August 18, 1887 to his wife. Le Prince later developed the one lens camera and on October 14, 1888 he finally made the world&#x27;s first moving image, &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene.&quot;
*1888 – &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot;, the earliest surviving film by French inventor Louis Le Prince, is shot in Leeds, West Yorkshire in England with a groundbreaking 20 frames per second. Other short films made at the same time were &quot;Accordion Player&quot; and &quot;Traffic Crossing Leeds Bridge&quot;.
*1889 – Eastman Kodak is the first company to begin commercial production of film on a flexible transparent base, celluloid.

==1890s==
*1891 – &quot;Dickson Greeting&quot;; &quot;Men Boxing&quot;; &quot;Newark Athlete&quot;
*1892 – &quot;Le Clown et ses chiens&quot;; &quot;Pauvre Pierrot&quot;; &quot;Un bon bock&quot;, first projected animated films released by Émile Reynaud
*1893 – &quot;Blacksmiths&quot;, the first film shown publicly on the Kinetoscope, a system given to Edison; Thomas Edison created &quot;America&#x27;s First Film Studio&quot;, Black Maria.
*1894 – 
**&quot;Carmencita&quot; was made. According to film historian Charles Musser the first woman to appear in front of an Edison motion picture camera was in the film. She may have been the first woman to appear in a motion picture in the United States. It was directed and produced by William K.L. Dickson, who was the Scottish inventor credited with the invention of the motion picture camera under the employ of Edison.
**&quot;The Dickson Experimental Sound Film&quot; made by William Dickson in late 1894 or early 1895 is the first known film with live-recorded sound and appears to be the first motion picture made for the Kinetophone, the proto-sound-film system developed by Dickson and Edison.
*1895 – In Paris on December 28, 1895, the Lumière brothers screen ten films at the Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris making the first commercial public screening ever made, marked traditionally as the birth date of the film. Gaumont Film Company, the oldest ever film studio, was founded by inventor Léon Gaumont.
*1896 – &quot;L&#x27;Arrivée d&#x27;un train en gare de La Ciotat&quot;, one of the six more short films released by the Lumière brothers; Pathé-Frères is founded; &quot;Le Manoir du diable (The Haunted Castle)&quot; is a French short silent film directed by Georges Méliès which depicts a pantomimed sketch in the style of a theatrical comic fantasy.

*1898 –&quot;The Astronomer&#x27;s Dream&quot;; &quot;The Cavalier&#x27;s Dream&quot;; &quot;Photographing a Ghost&quot;; &quot;Santa Claus&quot; 
*1898 –&quot; Shinin No Sosei&quot; and&quot; Bake Jizo&quot; were made by Ejiro Hatta, some of the first films in Japan which were ghost stories. Salvador Toscano created the film, &quot;Don Juan Tenorio&quot;, which is considered one of the first films in Mexico and perhaps the first fictional film in Mexico, as South America as a continent focuses on making documentaries in its early film history.
*1898 –&quot; Hiralal Sen was&quot; inspired and filmed the&quot; &quot;Flower of Persia&quot;&quot; play&quot;.&quot; 
*1899 – &quot;The Dreyfus Affair&quot; and &quot;Cendrillon&quot; (first screen adaptation of the traditional fairy tale &quot;Cinderella&quot;) was released by Georges Méliès; earliest known use of a color motion picture film footage by Edward Raymond Turner

<doc id="169214" wikidata="Q219772" url="?curid=169214" title="PJ Harvey">
<text>Polly Jean Harvey (born 9 October 1969) is an English singer-songwriter. Primarily known as a vocalist and guitarist, she is also proficient with a wide range of instruments.

Harvey began her career in 1988 when she joined local band Automatic Dlamini as a vocalist, guitarist and saxophonist. The band&#x27;s frontman, John Parish, is still her long-term collaborator. In 1991, she formed a trio called PJ Harvey and this began her career as PJ Harvey. The trio released two acclaimed studio albums called &quot;Dry&quot; (1992) and &quot;Rid of Me&quot; (1993) before disbanding, after which Harvey continued as a solo artist. Since 1995, she has released a further ten studio albums with collaborations from various musicians including Parish, former bandmate Rob Ellis, Mick Harvey, and Eric Drew Feldman, and has also worked extensively with record producer Flood.

Among the accolades Harvey has received are both the 2001 and 2011 Mercury Prize for &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot; (2000) and &quot;Let England Shake&quot; (2011), respectively, making her the only artist to have been awarded the prize twice. She has also received eight Brit Award nominations, eight Grammy Award nominations and two further Mercury Prize nominations. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarded her three accolades: 1992&#x27;s Best New Artist and Best Singer Songwriter, and 1995&#x27;s Artist of the Year. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also listed &quot;Rid of Me&quot;, &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;, and &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot; on its list of their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2011, she was awarded for Outstanding Contribution to Music at the &quot;NME&quot; Awards. In the 2013 Birthday Honours, she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to music.
== Early life ==
Polly Jean Harvey was born on 9 October 1969 in Bridport, Dorset, the second child of Ray and Eva Harvey (). Her parents owned a quarrying business on Ham Hill, the site of a large Iron Age hillfort, and she grew up on the family farm in Corscombe. During her childhood, she attended Beaminster School in nearby Beaminster, where she received guitar lessons from folk singer-songwriter Steve Knightley. Her parents introduced her to music that would later influence her work, including blues, Captain Beefheart and Bob Dylan. Her parents were avid music fans and regularly arranged get-togethers and small gigs, counting Ian Stewart among their oldest friends.

As a teenager, Harvey began learning saxophone and joined an eight-piece instrumental group, Bologne, run by composer Andrew Dickson. She was also a guitarist with folk duo the Polekats, with whom she wrote some of her earliest material. After finishing school, she joined Yeovil College and attended a visual arts foundation course.

== Career ==
=== Automatic Dlamini: 1988–1991 ===
In July 1988, Harvey became a member of Automatic Dlamini, a band based in Bristol with whom she gained extensive ensemble-playing experience. Formed by John Parish in 1983, the band consisted of a rotating line-up that at various times included Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey had met Parish in 1987 through mutual friend Jeremy Hogg, the band&#x27;s slide guitarist. Providing saxophone, guitars and backing vocals, she travelled extensively during the band&#x27;s early days, including performances in East and West Germany, Spain and Poland to support the band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;The D is for Drum&quot;. A second European tour took place throughout June and July 1989. Following the tour, the band recorded &quot;Here Catch, Shouted His Father&quot;, their second studio album, between late 1989 and early 1990. This is the only Automatic Dlamini material to feature Harvey, but remains unreleased, although bootleg versions of the album are in circulation.

In January 1991, Harvey left to form her own band with former bandmates Ellis and Oliver, though she had also formed lasting personal and professional relationships with other members, especially Parish, to whom she has referred as her &quot;musical soulmate&quot;. Parish would subsequently contribute to, and sometimes co-produce, Harvey&#x27;s solo studio albums and has toured with her several times. As a duo, Parish and Harvey have recorded two collaborative albums where Parish composed the music and Harvey wrote the lyrics. Parish&#x27;s girlfriend in the late 1980s was photographer Maria Mochnacz. She and Harvey became close friends and Mochnacz went on to shoot and design most of Harvey&#x27;s album artwork and music videos, contributing significantly to her public image.

Harvey said of her time with Automatic Dlamini: &quot;I ended up not singing very much but I was just happy to learn how to play the guitar. I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap. I was listening to a lot of Irish folk music at the time, so the songs were folky and full of penny whistles and stuff. It was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people.&quot; She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying &quot;after the experience with John&#x27;s band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with people in the audience, and I probably did learn that from him, amongst other things.&quot;

Harvey wrote to the American rock band Slint after they printed a request for female singers on the sleeve of their 1991 album &quot;Spiderland&quot;, but Slint broke up before the album was released.

=== PJ Harvey Trio; &quot;Dry&quot; and &quot;Rid of Me&quot;: 1991–1994 ===
Harvey decided to name her new band the PJ Harvey Trio, rejecting other names as &quot;nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound&quot;, and also to allow her to continue music as a solo artist. The trio consisted of Harvey on vocals and guitar, Ellis on drums and backing vocals, and Oliver on bass. Oliver later departed to rejoin the still-active Automatic Dlamini. He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio&#x27;s &quot;disastrous&quot; debut performance was held at a skittle alley in Charmouth Village Hall in April 1991. Harvey later recounted the event saying: &quot;we started playing and I suppose there was about fifty people there, and during the first song we cleared the hall. There was only about two people left. And a woman came up to us, came up to my drummer, it was only a three piece, while we were playing and shouted at him &#x27;Don&#x27;t you realise nobody likes you! We&#x27;ll pay you, you can stop playing, we&#x27;ll still pay you!&#x27;&quot;
The group relocated to London in June 1991 when Harvey applied to study sculpture, still undecided as to her future career. During this time, the group recorded a set of demo songs and distributed them to record labels. Independent label Too Pure agreed to release the band&#x27;s debut single &quot;Dress&quot; in October 1991, and later signed PJ Harvey. &quot;Dress&quot; received mass critical acclaim upon its release and was voted Single of the Week in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; by guest reviewer John Peel, who admired &quot;the way Polly Jean seems crushed by the weight of her own songs and arrangements, as if the air is literally being sucked out of them ... admirable if not always enjoyable.&quot; However, Too Pure provided little promotion for the single and critics claim that &quot;&quot;Melody Maker&quot; had more to do with the success of the &quot;Dress&quot; single than Too Pure Records.&quot; A week after its release, the band recorded a live radio session for Peel on BBC Radio 1 on 29 October featuring &quot;Oh, My Lover&quot;, &quot;Victory&quot;, &quot;Sheela-Na-Gig&quot; and &quot;Water&quot;.

The following February, the trio released &quot;Sheela-Na-Gig&quot; as their equally-acclaimed second single and their debut studio album, &quot;Dry&quot; (1992), followed in March. Like the singles preceding it, &quot;Dry&quot; received an overwhelming international critical response. The album was cited by Kurt Cobain of Nirvana as his sixteenth-favourite album ever in his posthumously published &quot;Journals&quot; (2002). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also named Harvey as Songwriter of the Year and Best New Female Singer. A limited edition double LP version of &quot;Dry&quot; was released alongside the regular version of the album, containing both the original and demo versions of each track, called &quot;Dry Demonstration&quot;, and the band also received significant coverage at the Reading Festival in 1992.

Island (PolyGram) signed the trio amid a major label bidding war in mid-1992, and in December 1992 the trio travelled to Cannon Falls, Minnesota in the United States to record the follow-up to &quot;Dry&quot; with producer Steve Albini. Prior to recording with Albini, the band recorded a second session with John Peel on 22 September and recorded a version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;, and two new songs &quot;Me Jane&quot; and &quot;Ecstasy&quot;. The recording sessions with Albini took place at Pachyderm Recording Studio and resulted in the band&#x27;s major label debut &quot;Rid of Me&quot; in May 1993. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that it &quot;is charged with aggressive eroticism and rock fury. It careens from blues to goth to grunge, often in the space of a single song.&quot; The album was promoted by two singles, &quot;50ft Queenie&quot; and &quot;Man-Size&quot;, as well as tours of the United Kingdom in May and of the United States in June, continuing there during the summer.

However, during the American leg of the tour, internal friction started to form between the members of the trio. Deborah Frost, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, noticed &quot;an ever widening personal gulf&quot; between the band members, and quoted Harvey as saying &quot;It makes me sad. I wouldn&#x27;t have got here without them. I needed them back then – badly. But I don&#x27;t need them anymore. We all changed as people.&quot; Despite the tour&#x27;s personal downsides, footage from live performances was compiled and released on the long-form video &quot;Reeling with PJ Harvey&quot; (1993). The band&#x27;s final tour was to support the Irish rock band U2 in August 1993, after which the trio officially disbanded. In her final appearance on American television in September 1993 on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, Harvey performed a solo version of &quot;Rid of Me&quot;. As &quot;Rid of Me&quot; sold substantially more copies than &quot;Dry&quot;, &quot;4-Track Demos&quot;, a compilation album of demos for the album was released in October and inaugurated her career as a solo artist. In early 1994, it was announced that U2&#x27;s manager, Paul McGuinness, had become her manager.

=== &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; and &quot;Is This Desire?&quot;: 1995–1999 ===
As Harvey embarked on her solo career, she explored collaborations with other musicians. In 1995 she released her third studio album, &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;, featuring former bandmate John Parish, Bad Seeds multi-instrumentalist Mick Harvey and French drummer Jean-Marc Butty, all of whom would continue to perform and record with Harvey throughout her career. The album was also her first material to be produced by Flood. A blues-influenced and futuristic record, &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; included strings, organs and synthesisers. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said in its review that &quot;Harvey sings the blues like Nick Cave sings gospel: with more distortion, sex and murder than you remember. &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; was a towering goth version of grunge.&quot;
The record generated a surprise modern rock radio hit in the United States with its lead single, &quot;Down by the Water&quot;. The music video received heavy rotation on MTV and became Harvey&#x27;s most recognizable song. Three consecutive singles—&quot;C&#x27;mon Billy&quot;, &quot;Send His Love to Me&quot; and &quot;Long Snake Moan&quot;—were also moderately successful. The album sold one million copies worldwide including 370,000 in the United States. It was also certified Silver in the United Kingdom within seven months of its release, having sold over 60,000 copies. In the US, the album was voted Album of the Year by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also named Harvey 1995&#x27;s Artist of the Year and &quot;Spin&quot; ranked the album third in The 90 Greatest Albums of the 1990s, behind Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991) and Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; (1990). In 1996, Harvey also received her first Grammy Award nominations for Best Alternative Music and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance (&quot;Down by the Water&quot;).

In 1996, following the international success of &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; and experimental collaboration album &quot;Dance Hall at Louse Point&quot; with John Parish, Harvey began composing material that would end up on her fourth studio album, during what she referred to as &quot;an incredibly low patch&quot;. The material introduced electronica elements into her work. During recording sessions in 1997 original PJ Harvey Trio drummer Rob Ellis rejoined Harvey&#x27;s band, and Flood was hired again as producer. The sessions, which continued into April the following year, resulted in &quot;Is This Desire?&quot; (1998). Originally released in September 1998, the album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Performance. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;A Perfect Day Elise&quot;, was moderately successful in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 25 on the UK Singles Chart, her most successful single to date.

In July 2020, a vinyl reissue of &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; was announced, including unreleased demos.

=== &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot; and &quot;Uh Huh Her&quot;: 2000–2006 ===

In early 2000, Harvey began work on her fifth studio album &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot; with Rob Ellis and Mick Harvey. Written in her native Dorset, Paris and New York, the album showcased a more mainstream indie rock and pop rock sound to her previous albums and the lyrics followed themes of love that tied into Harvey&#x27;s affection for New York City. The album featured Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke on three tracks, including his lead vocals on &quot;This Mess We&#x27;re In&quot;. Upon its release in October 2000 the album was a critical and commercial success, selling over one million copies worldwide and charting in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The album&#x27;s three singles—&quot;Good Fortune&quot;, &quot;A Place Called Home&quot; and &quot;This Is Love&quot;—were moderately successful.
The album won a BRIT Award nomination for Best Female Artist and two Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Album and Best Female Rock Performance for the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;This Is Love&quot;. Harvey was nominated for, and won, the 2001 Mercury Prize. The awards ceremony was held on the same day as the September 11 attacks on the United States and Harvey was on tour in Washington, D.C., one of the affected cities, when she won the prize. Reflecting on the win in 2011, she said: &quot;quite naturally I look back at that and only remember the events that were taking place across the world and to win the prize on that day—it didn&#x27;t have much importance in the grand scheme of things&quot;, noting &quot;it was a very surreal day&quot;. The same year, Harvey also topped a readers&#x27; poll conducted by &quot;Q&quot; magazine of the 100 Greatest Women in Rock Music.

During three years of various collaborations with other artists, Harvey was also working on her sixth studio album, &quot;Uh Huh Her&quot;, which was released in May 2004. For the first time since &quot;4-Track Demos&quot; (1993), Harvey played every instrument—with the exception of drums provided by Rob Ellis—and was the sole producer. The album received &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot; by critics, but its production was criticised. It debuted and peaked at number 12 in the UK Albums Chart and was certified Silver by the BPI within a month of its release.

Harvey also did an extensive world tour in promotion of the album, lasting seven months. Selected recordings from the tour were included on Harvey&#x27;s first live DVD, &quot;On Tour: Please Leave Quietly&quot;, directed by Maria Mochnacz and released in 2006.

=== &quot;White Chalk&quot; and &quot;Let England Shake&quot;: 2007–2014 ===

During her first performance since the &quot;Uh Huh Her&quot; tour at the Hay Festival of Literature &amp; Arts on 26 May 2006, Harvey revealed that her next studio album would be almost entirely piano-based. Following the October release of &quot;The Peel Sessions 1991–2004&quot;, a compilation of songs recorded from 1991 to 2000 during her radio sessions with John Peel, she began recording her seventh studio album &quot;White Chalk&quot; in November, together with Flood, John Parish and Eric Drew Feldman and drummer Jim White in a studio in West London. &quot;White Chalk&quot; was released in September 2007 and marked a radical departure from her usual alternative rock style, consisting mainly of piano ballads. The album received favourable reviews, its style being described by one critic as containing &quot;pseudo-Victorian elements—drama, restraint, and antiquated instruments and sounds.&quot; Harvey herself said of the album: &quot;when I listen to the record I feel in a different universe, really, and I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s in the past or in the future. The record confuses me, that&#x27;s what I like—it doesn&#x27;t feel of this time right now, but I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s 100 years ago or 100 years in the future&quot;, summing up the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;really weird.&quot; During the tour for the album Harvey performed without a backing band, and also began performing on an autoharp, which continues to be her primary instrument after guitar and has influenced her material since &quot;White Chalk&quot;.

March 2009 saw the release of her second collaboration studio album with John Parish &quot;A Woman a Man Walked By&quot;. Written in the vein of punk blues, folk and experimental rock, it was preceded by the lead single &quot;Black Hearted Love&quot;. As with their first effort, Parish wrote all of the music and played most of the instruments, leaving Harvey to the lyrics and singing. 

In April 2010, Harvey appeared on &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; to perform a new song titled &quot;Let England Shake&quot;. In a pre-performance interview with Marr, she stated that the new material she had written had been &quot;formed out of the landscape that I&#x27;ve grown up in and the history of this nation&quot; and as &quot;a human being affected by politics.&quot; Her eighth studio album &quot;Let England Shake&quot; was released in February 2011, and received universal critical acclaim. &quot;NME&quot;″s 10/10 review summarised the album as &quot;a record that ventures deep into the heart of darkness of war itself and its resonance throughout England&#x27;s past, present and future&quot; and other reviews also noted its themes and writing style as &quot;bloody and forceful,&quot; mixing &quot;ethereal form with brutal content,&quot; and &quot;her most powerful.&quot; Dealing with the then-conflict in Afghanistan and other episodes from English history, the album featured John Parish, Mick Harvey and Jean-Marc Butty as Harvey&#x27;s backing band and the quartet toured extensively in its promotion. Following the release of the album&#x27;s two well-received singles—&quot;The Words That Maketh Murder&quot; and &quot;The Glorious Land&quot;—and the collection of short films by Seamus Murphy to accompany the album, Harvey won her second Mercury Music Prize on 6 September. The award marked her as the first artist to receive the award twice, entering her into the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the only artist to have achieved this., and sales of &quot;Let England Shake&quot; increased 1,190% overnight following her win. On 23 September, &quot;Let England Shake&quot; was certified Gold in the United Kingdom and was listed as album of the year by &quot;MOJO&quot; and &quot;Uncut&quot;.
On 3 August 2013, Harvey released a song &quot;Shaker Aamer&quot; in support of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp detainee by the same name who was the last British citizen to be held there. The song describes in detail what Aamer endured during his four-month hunger strike.

=== &quot;The Hope Six Demolition Project&quot;, and &quot;I Inside the Old Year Dying&quot;: 2015–present ===

On 16 January 2015, PJ Harvey began recording her ninth studio album, &quot;The Hope Six Demolition Project&quot;, in front of a live audience. A custom built recording studio was made in London&#x27;s Somerset House. &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine noted that much like her previous album &quot;Let England Shake&quot;, many of the lyrics were politically charged, but this time it was more globally focused. While recording she was shown to be using saxophones, an autoharp and a bouzouki. Flood was confirmed to be the producer of the album. On 18 December 2015, Harvey released a 20-second teaser for the album, which contained a release date of spring 2016.

On 21 January 2016, the debut single, &quot;The Wheel&quot;, was played on Steve Lamacq&#x27;s show on BBC Radio 6 Music. The album was released on 15 April. A new video, &quot;The Orange Monkey&quot;, was shared on 2 June 2016. Directed by Irish filmmaker Seamus Murphy, it was made from footage of Murphy&#x27;s and Harvey&#x27;s trips to Afghanistan. Together they have also traveled to Washington, D.C., and Kosovo and their collaboration yielded the 2015 book &quot;The Hollow of the Hand&quot;, which collected her poems and his photographs. Their impressions from the journey and the creative process behind the recording of the new album were chronicled in the documentary called &quot;A Dog Called Money&quot;, which was premiered at the 69th Berlin International Film Festival.

The album reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Alternative Music Album category. Harvey spent much of 2016 and 2017 touring the world with her nine-piece band, playing mainly on saxophone and taking her critically lauded live show around North America, South America, Europe and Australasia.

Harvey remained active since then, frequently releasing folk songs for soundtracks to popular TV Series and films. In 2019, she released the instrumental soundtrack album to the Ivo van Hove stage adaptation of &quot;All About Eve&quot; with the vocals of Gillian Anderson and Lily James. In October 2022, she released another full soundtrack album to the Irish black comedy Apple TV+ TV Series &quot;Bad Sisters&quot; together with Tim Phillips.

From 2020 up to 2022, UMC/Island Records and Beggars Group launched the reissue campaign of her studio work, accompanied by separate demo records to each album. In the culmination of the reissue project, the compilation of 59 songs, previously unavailable physically or digitally, titled &quot;B-Sides, Demos and Rarities&quot; was released on 4 November 2022.

In June 2022, Harvey stated that her next studio album is scheduled to be released in summer 2023. In January 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Harvey at number 145 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

In April 2023, it was announced on Harvey&#x27;s official website that her tenth studio album &quot;I Inside the Old Year Dying&quot; would be released on 7 July 2023 on Partisan Records. It also marked the first time (since the release of &quot;Dry&quot; on Too Pure in 1992), Harvey releasing her album on the independent label, after 30 years being signed on Island Records, part of Universal Music Group. The first single &quot;A Child&#x27;s Question, August&quot; premiered on 26 April 2023. Harvey toured Europe in support of the new album with 26 dates in September–October 2023 and is scheduled to perform on the 17 music festivals in Europe in summer 2024. US Tour is planned for autumn 2024. The album has been met with widespread critical acclaim, debuted at number 5 at UK Albums Chart and has been nominated as the Best Alternative Music Album at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards.

== Collaborations and projects ==

Besides her own work, Harvey has also collaborated with a number of other artists. In 1995, she recorded a duet of American folk song &quot;Henry Lee&quot; with her then-partner Nick Cave and also featured on the Bob Dylan cover &quot;Death is Not the End&quot;, both released on Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds&#x27; &quot;Murder Ballads&quot; (1996). In the same year she sang the theme song &quot;Who Will Love Me Now?&quot; on Philip Ridley&#x27;s film &quot;The Passion of Darkly Noon&quot;. After her 1995 tour, she met Pascal Comelade and decided to collaborate with him, singing on several tracks including &quot;Love Too Soon&quot; on his album &quot;L&#x27;Argot du Bruit&quot;. In May 1998, before the release of &quot;Is This Desire?&quot;, she featured on Tricky&#x27;s &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;, performing lead vocals on &quot;Broken Homes&quot;, and also contributed to Sparklehorse&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; performing guitar, piano and backing vocals on two songs, &quot;Eyepennies&quot; and &quot;Piano Fire&quot;. Following the tour in promotion of &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot;, she contributed vocals to eight tracks on &quot;Volume 9: I See You Hearin&#x27; Me&quot; and &quot;Volume 10: I Heart Disco&quot; by Josh Homme&#x27;s side project the Desert Sessions, also appearing in the music video for &quot;Crawl Home&quot;. Throughout 2004, Harvey produced Tiffany Anders&#x27; album &quot;Funny Cry Happy Gift&quot;, and also produced, performed on and wrote five songs for Marianne Faithfull&#x27;s album &quot;Before the Poison&quot;, and contributed backing vocals on &quot;Hit the City&quot;, &quot;Methamphetamine Blues&quot; and &quot;Come to Me&quot; on Mark Lanegan&#x27;s album &quot;Bubblegum&quot;. Harvey contributed the song &quot;Slow-Motion Movie-Star&quot;, an outtake from &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot;, to Mick Harvey&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Two of Diamonds&quot;, released in 2007.

Harvey has also recorded two studio albums with long-time collaborator John Parish. &quot;Dance Hall at Louse Point&quot; (1996) was written collectively with Parish with the exception of the song &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot;, written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The album also listed her as Polly Jean Harvey, which may have impacted album sales. Harvey has also reflected on how the album was &quot;an enormous turning point&quot; and &quot;lyrically, it moved me into areas I&#x27;d never been to before.&quot; In 1998, she also performed lead vocals on &quot;Airplane Blues&quot;, as a soundtrack accompaniment to the &quot;Wingwalkers&quot; art exhibition by Rebecca Goddard and Parish&#x27;s wife, Michelle Henning, which was released as the closing song on Parish&#x27;s second solo album &quot;How Animals Move&quot; in 2002. Following the release of &quot;White Chalk&quot;, Harvey reunited with Parish to record &quot;A Woman a Man Walked By&quot;, released in March 2009. Like &quot;Dance Hall at Louse Point&quot;, the album received positive reviews and was a moderate commercial success, peaking at number 25 in the UK Albums Chart. She collaborated with Egyptian musician Ramy Essam on &quot;The Camp&quot;, a charity single released in June 2017 to benefit displaced children in the Lebanese Bekaa Valley fleeing the Syrian civil war.

Aside from collaborations, Harvey has also embarked on a number of projects as a composer. In January 2009, a new stage production of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; opened on Broadway. Directed by Ian Rickson and starring Mary-Louise Parker in the title role, the play featured an original score of incidental music written by Harvey. In November 2011, Harvey also composed part of the score for Young Vic&#x27;s long-running production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in London. She subsequently worked with Rickson a number of times, contributing music for his stage production of &quot;Electra&quot;, &quot;The Nest&quot;, and &quot;The Goat&quot;. In 2019, Harvey scored Ivo van Hove&#x27;s West End production of &quot;All About Eve&quot;. She documented her artistic process for writing scores in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme &#x27;Behind the Scenes&#x27; hosted by journalist John Wilson.

In May 2012, Harvey composed two songs, &quot;Horse&quot; and &quot;Bobby Don&#x27;t Steal&quot;, for Mark Cousins&#x27; film &quot;What is This Film Called Love?&quot;, which also features &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;.

In 2014, a number of Harvey&#x27;s songs were featured in the second season of &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;.

In March 2018, Harvey and Parish released a song called &quot;Sorry For Your Loss&quot; as tribute to singer-songwriter Mark Linkous, who took his own life in 2010.

In 2019, Harvey composed the score for Shane Meadows&#x27; miniseries, &quot;The Virtues&quot;, broadcast on Channel 4.

In 2022, Harvey composed the score for Sharon Horgan, Dave Finkel, and Brett Baer&#x27;s Apple TV+ series &quot;Bad Sisters.&quot;

In 2024, Harvey&#x27;s songs again feature on the stage in London Tide, directed by Ian Rickson, and based on Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;. London Tide is adapted by Ben Power and features original songs written by PJ Harvey and Ben Power.

== Musical style and influences ==
Harvey possesses an expansive contralto vocal range. Harvey aims to not repeat herself in her music, which results in every album sounding different to her previous works. In an October 2004 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, she said: &quot;when I&#x27;m working on a new record, the most important thing is to not repeat myself ... that&#x27;s always my aim: to try and cover new ground and really to challenge myself. Because I&#x27;m in this for learning.&quot; While her musical style has been described as alternative rock, punk blues, art rock, avant-rock, and grunge, she has experimented with various other genres including electronica, indie rock and folk music.

She changes her physical appearance for each album by altering her mode of dress or hairstyle, creating a unique aesthetic that extends to all aspects of the album, from the album art to the live performances. She works closely with friend and photographer Maria Mochnacz to develop the visual style of each album. Around the time of &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;, for example, Harvey began experimenting with her image and adopting a theatrical aspect to her live performances. Her former fashion style, which consisted of simple black leggings, turtleneck sweaters and Dr. Martens boots, was replaced by ballgowns, catsuits, wigs and excessive make-up. She also began using stage props like a Ziggy Stardust-style flashlight microphone. She denied the influence of drag, Kabuki or performance art on her new image, a look she affectionately dubbed &quot;Joan Crawford on acid&quot; in an interview with &quot;Spin&quot; in 1996, but admitted that &quot;it&#x27;s that combination of being quite elegant and funny and revolting, all at the same time, that appeals to me. I actually find wearing make-up like that, sort of smeared around, as extremely beautiful. Maybe that&#x27;s just my twisted sense of beauty.&quot; However, she later told &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot; magazine, &quot;that was kind of a mask. It was much more of a mask than I&#x27;ve ever had. I was very lost as a person, at that point. I had no sense of self left at all&quot;, and has never repeated the overt theatricality of the &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; tour.

At an early age, she was introduced by her parents to blues music, jazz and art rock, which would later influence her: &quot;I was brought up listening to John Lee Hooker, to Howlin&#x27; Wolf, to Robert Johnson, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix and Captain Beefheart. So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that&#x27;s always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older. I think the way we are as we get older is a result of what we knew when we were children.&quot; Other influential artists were &quot;Nina Simone, the Rolling Stones, people like that I grew up listening to but find I returned to&quot;. During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synth-pop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, although later stated that it was a phase when she was &quot;having a bit of a rebellion against my parents&#x27; record collection.&quot; In her later teenage years, she became a fan of Pixies, and she then listened to Slint. She has named Bob Dylan, and Neil Young, when talking about her influences. Many critics have compared Harvey to Patti Smith, which Harvey dismisses as &quot;lazy journalism&quot;. However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is &quot;so energising to see and so passionate with what she&#x27;s doing&quot;. Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance, stating : &quot;She is so exciting to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality&quot;. She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music, Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, classical composers like Arvo Pärt, Erik Satie, Samuel Barber, and Henryk Górecki. As a lyricist, Harvey has cited numerous poets, authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter, T. S. Eliot, W. B. Yeats, James Joyce, Ted Hughes and contemporaries such as Shane MacGowan and Jez Butterworth. Elvis Presley was also mentioned in her 2022 book &quot;Orlam&quot; and the 2023 single &quot;A Child&#x27;s Question, August&quot;.

Harvey rejects the notion that her song lyrics are autobiographical, telling &quot;The Times&quot; in 1998: &quot;the tortured artist myth is rampant. People paint me as some kind of black witchcraft-practising devil from hell, that I have to be twisted and dark to do what I am doing. It&#x27;s a load of rubbish&quot;. What is more, she later told &quot;Spin&quot;: &quot;some critics have taken my writing so literally to the point that they&#x27;ll listen to &#x27;Down by the Water&#x27; and believe I have actually given birth to a child and drowned her.&quot;

== Other ventures ==
Outside her better-known music career, Harvey is also an occasional artist and actress. In 1998, she appeared in Hal Hartley&#x27;s film &quot;The Book of Life&quot; as Magdalena—a modern-day character based on the Biblical Mary Magdalene—and had a cameo role as a Playboy Bunny in &quot;A Bunny Girl&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a short film directed by Sarah Miles, in which she also performs &quot;Nina in Ecstasy&quot;, an outtake from &quot;Is This Desire?&quot; (1998). Harvey also collaborated with Miles on another film, &quot;Amaeru Fallout 1972&quot;, which includes Harvey performing a cover of &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot;.

Harvey is also an accomplished sculptor who has had several pieces exhibited at the Lamont Gallery and the Bridport Arts Centre. In 2010, she was invited to be the guest designer for the summer issue of Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s literary magazine &quot;&quot;. The issue featured Harvey&#x27;s paintings and drawings alongside short stories by Woody Allen. Her most recent artwork features in her second book of poetry &quot;Orlam&quot;.

In December 2013, Harvey gave her debut public poetry reading at the British Library. On 2 January 2014, she guest-edited BBC Radio 4&#x27;s the &quot;Today&quot; programme.

In October 2015, Harvey published her first collection of poetry, a collaboration with photographer Seamus Murphy, entitled &quot;The Hollow of The Hand.&quot; To create the book, Harvey and Murphy made several journeys to Kosovo, Afghanistan and Washington, D.C. Their experiences were documented in Murphy&#x27;s film &quot;A Dog Called Money&quot;, which was released in UK cinemas and online on 8 November 2019. The pair had previously worked together to create 12 short films for &quot;Let England Shake&quot;.

In April 2022, she published a book-length narrative poem titled &quot;Orlam&quot;.

On June 1st 2024 Harvey kicked off her European tour to be followed by a tour of North America.

== Personal life ==
In the early 1990s, Harvey was romantically involved with drummer and photographer Joe Dilworth of Stereolab. From 1996 to 1997, following their musical collaborations, Harvey had a relationship with Nick Cave, and their subsequent break-up influenced Cave&#x27;s follow-up studio album &quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Call&quot; (1997), with songs such as &quot;Into My Arms&quot;, &quot;West Country Girl&quot; and &quot;Black Hair&quot; being written specifically about her.

Harvey has one older brother, Saul, and four nephews through him. She expressed a fondness for children in 1995 and stated that she would love to have them, saying: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t consider it unless I was married. I would have to meet someone that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. That&#x27;s the only person who I would want to be the father of my children. Maybe that will never happen. I obviously see it in a very rational way but I&#x27;d love to have children.&quot;

Harvey was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to music. As of 2023, she lives in Dorset.

<text>Paul Mark Oakenfold (; born 30 August 1963), formerly known mononymously as Oakenfold, is an English record producer, remixer and trance DJ. He has provided over 100 remixes for over 100 artists including U2, Moby, Madonna, Britney Spears, Massive Attack, The Cure, New Order, The Rolling Stones, The Stone Roses and Michael Jackson. Oakenfold was voted the No. 1 DJ in the World twice in 1998 and 1999 by &quot;DJ Magazine&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Oakenfold was born on 30 August 1963 at Mile End Hospital. His father delivered the &quot;London Evening News&quot;. He lived in Highbury, Greenhithe, then Croydon, attending Archbishop Lanfranc School, then studied to be a chef for four years and worked at the Army and Navy Club.

===Early career: 1980–1984===
Paul Oakenfold describes his early life as a &quot;bedroom DJ&quot; in a podcasted interview with Vancouver&#x27;s &quot;24 Hours&quot;, stating he grew up listening to the Beatles.

Oakenfold&#x27;s musical career began in the late 1970s, when he met Trevor Fung and began helping him DJ soul music in a Covent Garden wine bar. Here in London, he also met Rumours where he played Earth, Wind and Fire and popular British bands.

In 1981, 18-year-old Oakenfold and his friend Ian Paul moved to New York City. Oakenfold worked as a courier in West Harlem. During this time, hip-hop was overtaking dance music as the most popular sound in the area (see 1984 in music). Oakenfold and Fung used fake identification to sneak into various dance clubs, like Studio 54, where they met members of the band Maze, Bobby Womack and Bob Marley, whom they also interviewed, claiming to be &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; journalists.

Returning to London, Oakenfold began breaking into the mainstream, as an A&amp;R man for Champion Records. At that time, he signed DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, as well as Salt-n-Pepa. Oakenfold appeared on the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; BBC programme for children with a breakdancing crew. He became a promoter and British agent for the Beastie Boys and Run-D.M.C. Since then, he appeared at The Project in Streatham playing soul and jazz music.

===Perfecto Records and fame: 1985–1991===

In 1987, Oakenfold travelled to the island of Ibiza for a week to celebrate his birthday. Trevor Fung, Nicky Holloway, Ian Saint Paul, Danny Rampling and Johnny Walker accompanied him. Oakenfold convinced the owner of a venue in England to host an &quot;Ibiza Reunion&quot; party after-hours. He had previously made an attempt, but it failed as the crowd was not prepared for the acid house style until 1987 when the party was successful. After that, the night became a classic and became one of the UK&#x27;s major acid house nights, known as &quot;Spectrum&quot; at Heaven in Charing Cross. The party was best known for the &quot;Theatre of Madness&quot;, as more than 1,500 people were present on Monday nights, until it went down; with the financial issues it changed its name to the &quot;Land of Oz&quot;. Artists like Alex Paterson DJ&#x27;d in the VIP chillout area known as the &quot;White Room&quot;, which gave Oakenfold more free time, and then he began producing music under the alias &quot;Electra&quot; in 1988. Members included Nick Divaris, John &quot;Johnny&quot; Rocca and Micky. As they continued releasing only four singles as the Balearic beat band Electra, in Full Frequency Range Recordings (FFRR Records) founded and run by Radio 1&#x27;s Pete Tong, the duo created a new alias under the name Perfecto. Also in 1988 he decided to create a place where new artists could develop their careers. At that moment, Perfecto Records was born.

He collaborated with his friend Steve Osborne on various projects. In 1990, he worked with Terry Farley, Andrew Weatherall and Osborne on two remixes for Happy Mondays. The remixes of &quot;Rave On&quot; and &quot;Hallelujah&quot; were released on the &quot;Madchester Rave On&quot; EP, as well as &quot;Step On&quot;, a cover version adapted from John Kongos&#x27; 1971 hit &quot;He&#x27;s Gonna Step on You&quot;. The song reached the top 5 position in the UK. He was invited as a guest DJ to Spike Island, a gig with the Stone Roses. Pleased with the last single, the Happy Mondays gave Oakenfold and Osborne the opportunity to produce their third studio album, &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot;. The album entered the UK charts at number one with pre-sales of 150,000. The album was named &quot;NME&quot;″s 1990 Album of the Year, and both Oakenfold and Osborne won the 1991 Brit Award for Best Producer.

In 1991, they remixed Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;Safe from Harm&quot; as well as many others.

===Tours and nightclubs: 1992–2000===

In 1992, when U2 released their song &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot;, the Perfecto remix reached a higher charted position than the original song. In 1993 with the success of his last remix as Perfecto, he was hired by U2 to provide the warm-up sonics to their Zoo TV world tour, and replaced BP Fallon in the 1993 legs of Europe and Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, with more than fifty shows in Zooropa &#x27;93 and Zoomerang from 7 May to 10 December of the same year.

Also in 1993, Oakenfold and Osborne&#x27;s project Grace was formed as State of Grace and featuring vocals by Patti Low, though by the time Grace had charted a number of singles in the UK charts (around 1996), it had become a &#x27;solo fronted project&#x27; with jazz singer Dominique Atkins as the lead vocalist. The project was dissolved in 1997 as Oakenfold was touring as a performance DJ more frequently and could not commit to recording, though a remixed version of &quot;Not Over Yet&quot; was issued under the &#x27;Planet Perfecto featuring Grace&#x27; name in 1999.
In September 1994 and again in 1998, he teamed up with Steve Osborne and Ben Hillier to remix the Rolling Stones song &quot;You Got Me Rocking&quot; and Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Out of My Mind&quot;. He began producing his own tracks as well, continuing to remix songs from popular artists. He began using Goa music, fusing it with similar-sounding European tracks to create his own distinct sound. He took this to the mainstream in 1994 and created a pair of two-hour sets for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Essential Mix&quot;; the first of these was broadcast in the early hours of Sunday 20 March 1994, with the second being &quot;The Goa Mix&quot; broadcast on Sunday 18 December 1994. His album &quot;Perfecto Fluoro&quot; became the No. 1 essential dance collection of Boston Beat during 1996 with Jamiroquai&#x27;s &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot;.

On 9 June 1997, Oakenfold created &quot;Global Underground 004: Paul Oakenfold, Live in Oslo&quot; (GU004) which is a double mix CD in the &quot;Global Underground&quot; series. Compiled and mixed by Oakenfold, it is the first work he created for GU. The mix was recorded live at Cosmopolite Club in Oslo, Norway, as part of the official launch of the Quart Festival. It showcased Oakenfold&#x27;s eclectic taste in music at the time, as the mix combines various forms of dance music. In 1997, Oakenfold mixed one disc of the double album &quot;Fantazia Presents the House Collection 6&quot;, a UK house music compilation series. Oakenfold became Cream&#x27;s resident DJ from 1997 to 1999. During this time, he began to concentrate on the release of &quot;Tranceport&quot; in 1998.

In 1998 and 1999, Oakenfold took the first place in &quot;DJ Mag&quot;″s Top 100 DJs. With the two-year contract as a resident in Liverpool&#x27;s Cream, it was in 1999 that he released &quot;Resident. Two Years of Oakenfold at Cream.&quot; on Virgin. Thrive Records, the US distributor for early Global Underground releases had a different numbering scheme for the &quot;Global Underground&quot; albums; due to this &quot;Global Underground 007: Paul Oakenfold, New York&quot; (GU007) was released as (GU002) in the United States only. The compilation was released on 25 May 1998, with the US release on 19 January 1999. This was the second production from Oakenfold with GU and it contained trance, drum and bass, progressive house, progressive trance, breakbeat and downtempo. This became his last work with GU.

In 1999, he became the first DJ to play on the main stage at the Glastonbury Festival for 90,000 people, which he considers his favorite gig. He became resident DJ for the opening of (short-lived) London superclub Home, a role he performed until May the following year. Also in 1999, he moved to the United States where he went on tour.

In 2000, he created fourteen tracks of jazz, soul, house and Goa based styles with Mitchell Oakenfold. Twenty-four FX and scratches loops and sounds were included too, each consisting of six seconds; the album cover says &quot;Only for DJs and Producers&quot; and was released on Music of Life.

In March 2000, he teamed up with Steve Osborne, Andy Gray and Bruno Ellingham to remix Moby&#x27;s song &quot;Natural Blues&quot;.

Sometime before July 2000, he teamed up with Andy Gray to write and produce the theme for the Channel 4 reality show &quot;Big Brother&quot; under the name Elementfour. The series started airing on 18 July 2000, with the theme later released as a single. The programme and theme moved over to Channel 5 from 18 August 2011 to 5 November 2018.

In September 2000, he opened the new Digital Radio station Ministry of Sound Radio with a live mix from the famous London club.

Oakenfold appeared in the intro scene of EA&#x27;s &quot;Euro 2000&quot; video game, which featured him using his turntables to activate the video game and control various players. He also composed the game&#x27;s soundtrack, which featured 7 tracks including a remix of the official anthem of the tournament.

===Pioneer in America: 2000–2001===

After his success in Europe, one of Oakenfold&#x27;s first major events in America was Fresno, California&#x27;s Cyberfest on 22 July 2000. The 500 acre indoor and outdoor central California location had the biggest dance capacity ever in America. An estimated 80,000 dancers and music lovers from Seattle, Reno, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Diego were welcomed that day. Cyberfest 2000, also known as the &quot;Festival Of The Future&quot; featured other DJs such as Chemical Brothers, BT, and Carl Cox. Cyberfest 2000 paved the way for other major events in the area such as the Electric Daisy Carnival in Los Angeles in 2010.

In 2001, Oakenfold took part in the first Area Festival tour. This tour featured Incubus, Carl Cox, the Orb, OutKast, and the Roots. He later released a new compilation album, &quot;Perfecto Presents: Ibiza&quot;.

2001 also saw the release of the video game &quot;Frequency&quot;, for which Oakenfold produced one track, &quot;See It&quot;.

Global Underground sold over 150,000 copies of Oakenfold&#x27;s previous &quot;Global Underground: New York&quot;. A spokesperson for the label claimed that in the US, demand for UK dance music had been increasing in the past couple of years, and now made up over two-thirds of the label&#x27;s sales. The Global Underground New York office opened in on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan. The Mekka Electronic Music Festival, otherwise known as the &quot;electronic Lollapallooza&quot; took place in ten cities in the United States and Canada during August and September, including New York City, Los Angeles, Toronto and San Francisco. The event featured Paul, Armand van Helden, De La Soul, LTJ Bukem, Josh Wink, Derrick Carter, Roni Size, Deep Dish, BT, The Crystal Method, Carl Craig and Überzone. Oakenfold next moved to Los Angeles to work on film soundtracks and to focus his DJing stateside. In 2001 he created the soundtrack for the film &quot;Swordfish&quot;, &quot;Swordfish: The Album&quot; contained a transformation of &quot;Planet Rock&quot; into a seven-minute breakbeat trance anthem. Most of the tracks are collaborations with Andy Gray, the remix of N.E.R.D.&#x27;s &quot;Lapdance&quot; which gained total notability from other tracks. The soundtrack was produced under Village Roadshow and Warner Bros. and distributed through London-Sire Records.

Oakenfold recorded a track with Crazy Town vocalist Shifty Shellshock at the end of the year for his new album. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Shellshock said that the track known as &quot;Starry Eyed Surprise&quot; was created after the pair met at a Crazy Town show.

===&quot;Bunkka&quot;: 2002–2004===

In 2002, &quot;Bunkka&quot; became his first official studio album when he signed to Maverick. The name &quot;Bunkka&quot; came from Peter Gabriel&#x27;s studio in the UK, where the album was recorded. An extended play was released featuring live versions of four songs under Peoplesound Records. It is also Oakenfold&#x27;s best selling album to date, with sales largely exceeding 1,000,000 (1 million) copies worldwide.

The album features vocals from Jane&#x27;s Addiction vocalist Perry Farrell on &quot;Time of Your Life&quot; and Shifty Shellshock of Los Angeles rock and rap band Crazy Town on &quot;Starry Eyed Surprise&quot;; Ice Cube on &quot;Get Em Up&quot;; and Tricky and Nelly Furtado on &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;. The album contains appearances by Asher D of So Solid Crew on &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot;, and Grant-Lee Philips, founder of the &#x27;90s Los Angeles rock band Grant Lee Buffalo is also included with Carmen Rizzo&#x27;s version of his song &quot;Motion&quot;. &quot;Bunkka&quot; also provided the start to three new artists, Carla Werner on the single &quot;Southern Sun&quot;, Tiff Lacey on &quot;Hypnotised&quot; and Emiliana Torrini on &quot;Hold Your Hand&quot;. Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s spoken words are provided on &quot;Nixon&#x27;s Spirit&quot;. Pakistani musician Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan&#x27;s composition was adapted in an electronic version on the tracks &quot;Zoo York&quot;. In 2002, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named Oakenfold in their list of the &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die&quot;. In 2002, Oakenfold revealed he had struggled with dyslexia as a child and announced his intention to help dyslexic children.

In 2002, Oakenfold remixed David Arnold&#x27;s &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;; the song was released under Warner Bros. Records and was followed by the album&#x27;s next two singles after &quot;Starry Eyed Surprise&quot;, &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot; and &quot;Southern Sun&quot;. &quot;Southern Sun&quot; with Carla Werner was first issued as a B-side of &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot; until it was included on Tiësto&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Sunrise 3: Panama&quot; compilation with his own remix of the song. &quot;Southern Sun&quot; became a hit as it was then released as the A-side of &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot; in mid-2002. &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot; was featured in Saab commercials, the 2003 EA Sports game &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour&quot;, the THQ game &quot;Juiced&quot;, the pilot for the television program &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, and as the NASCAR theme song for 2006. It appears in the video game series &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; in &quot;DDR Ultramix&quot; for the Xbox, the &quot;Fastlane&quot; episode &quot;Dogtown&quot; and the &quot;Alias&quot; episode &quot;Snowman&quot;. &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot; was also listed as the number one song that makes you drive faster by UpVenue. Also in 2003, he remixed another hit soundtrack for &#x27;Elvis Presley&#x27; which charted fairly well after his 2003 remix of &quot;Rubberneckin&#x27;&quot; made the top three in Australia and top five in the UK. This remix contributed to the Elvis phenomenon of the 21st century. In an earlier episode of &quot;Radio Free Roscoe&quot;, &quot;The Imposter&quot;, a 2005 series on The N, a character Travis Strong DJed to the song, acting as if it were his own. It has also been used in the film adaptation of Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s novel &quot;Stormbreaker&quot;, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; and it was reproduced with Korean lyrics for the film &quot;Collateral&quot;. The song has also been used during the performances of extreme freestyle water ski jumpers, and later became the theme song for the TV show &quot;TRL Italy&quot; from 2003 till 2005. The EP &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; was released on Perfecto and featured other works from Oakenfold and other artists. At the Creamfields event in 2002 at Speke Airfield, DJs such as Oakenfold, Seb Fontaine and Paul van Dyk performed along with Dave Clarke, Jon Carter, Richie Hawtin and Felix Da Housecat. The event also featured live appearances from Basement Jaxx, All Saints, Death in Vegas and Moloko. In 2003, Oakenfold released the fourth single of his album, &quot;Hypnotised&quot; which became successful enough to be included on his next compilation from the &quot;Perfecto Presents...&quot; series, &quot;Perfecto Presents: Great Wall&quot; which also included the Deepsky remix of the song as well as tracks like Motorcycle&#x27;s &quot;As the Rush Comes&quot;, Björk&#x27;s &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot;, UNKLE&#x27;s remix of Ian Brown&#x27;s &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; and Oakenfold&#x27;s remix of Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Hollywood&quot;. In 2003, Oakenfold produced a remix of &quot;Pourvu qu&#x27;elles soient douces&quot;, a 1988 hit by French singer Mylène Farmer.

With the event of Creamfields that took place in 2004, Oakenfold released a compilation of songs he played during the event as well as tracks influenced by the environment and the vibe of deejays such as Paul van Dyk, Armin van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, Judge Jules, Fergie, Tall Paul, Eddie Halliwell, Chris Lawrence, Adam Sheridan, Shan, and Alex Kidd at the Cream/Goodgreef and &quot;Mixmag&quot; Arena.

===&quot;A Lively Mind&quot;, &quot;Greatest Hits &amp; Remixes, Vol. 1&quot; and side work: 2005–2007===

In 2005, Oakenfold was contacted by the car manufacturer Toyota to create a free promotional CD available from aygo.com to promote a new Toyota car. The CD contained only seven songs which he worked on with Ian Green; the album was entitled &quot;Feed Your Mind&quot;.

During Oakenfold&#x27;s career he has remixed a variety of songs from Madonna, like &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;American Life&quot;, &quot;Sorry&quot; and later in 2008 &quot;Give It 2 Me&quot; from her album &quot;Hard Candy&quot;, Oakenfold went on tour with Madonna for two months opening her presentation in the Confessions Tour, previously he had supported her in 2004 at Slane Castle in Ireland. His sets lasted for an hour and a half, followed by Madonna&#x27;s two-hour show.

Oakenfold remixed the &quot;Transformers&quot; theme as the theme song for the TV series, &quot;Transformers Cybertron&quot;. He also contributed with his single &quot;Beautiful Goal&quot; for the &quot;FIFA Football 2005&quot; video game. His single &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot; was composed for the 2005 video game &quot;Juiced&quot;. His second studio album, &quot;A Lively Mind&quot; was released on 6 June 2006. Receiving unsuccessful reviews, the first single &quot;Faster Kill Pussycat&quot;, a collaboration with the actress Brittany Murphy, was released on 2 May 2006; the second single was &quot;Sex &#x27;n&#x27; Money&quot;. Both songs stand out from the rest, as most of the album has a more trance-like feel. Gregory Jeffries from AllMusic stated the album might have been in the nominated albums of dance music in 1997 but not in 2006, as the album has guitars with disco sounds that might be only appealing to trance addicts.
In 2007, he played live at the Boston Pops which created a piece of orchestral music with electronic music. The event took place in Miami for 10,000 people with a 75-piece orchestra, he wrote a piece of music which he described as &quot;difficult&quot;. In 2007 he was nominated to 2 International Dance Music Awards (IDMA) at the Winter Music Conference (WMC), &quot;Best Underground Dance Track&quot; for &quot;Faster Kill Pussycat&quot; and &quot;Best Full Length DJ Mix CD&quot; for &quot;A Lively Mind&quot;. 2007 saw the publication of the first official biography of Paul Oakenfold, written by Richard Norris of The Grid and Beyond the Wizard&#x27;s Sleeve fame. &quot;Paul Oakenfold: The Authorised Biography&quot; was published by Bantam Press on 24 September 2007. Oakenfold is a self-professed supporter of association football clubs Chelsea F.C. and Los Angeles FC. It was thought that he played a zombie in the movie &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; however this is incorrect, he was offered the opportunity but turned it down. He also scored the soundtrack for the 2007 Japanese CGI anime film &quot;Vexille&quot;.

In October 2007 he released his &quot;Greatest Hits &amp; Remixes, Vol. 1&quot; which features his best performance tracks. Oakenfold was a judge for the sixth and seventh annual Independent Music Awards. In October 2007 Oakenfold remixed Britney Spears&#x27; number one hit &quot;Gimme More&quot;, which became the lead remix off the release. Oakenfold has created more than one hundred remixes, and has sold over 5,000,000 (5 million) long plays. He toured in British universities to promote his new album and autobiography. The tribute album was released in November in the United Kingdom with a 2-CD set and a 3 CD version with the same number of songs. It was also released in the United States with only 20 tracks in one CD; it featured some remixes from the original version but it also included two new remixes which are: Justin Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;My Love&quot; song and his remix of Hans Zimmer&#x27;s &quot;Jack Theme Suite&quot; which was used for the film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;.

This was a new version &quot;Not Over Yet&quot; which he produced while working with Osborne as Grace and in collaboration with Ryan Tedder from OneRepublic. The song was covered by Klaxons as &quot;It&#x27;s Not Over Yet&quot;. In 2008, Oakenfold worked on film scores for various films and television programs such as &quot;Californication&quot;, &quot;The Heavy&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, and &quot;Speed Racer&quot;. In mid-July Oakenfold ended his world tour promoting his greatest hits album. He also joined Madonna again in her Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour in London, Santiago, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. After touring, he began his residency in Las Vegas on 30 August. In the fall of 2008, he started his first Resident DJ position in the United States. &quot;Paul Oakenfold Presents: Perfecto Las Vegas&quot; was conceptualized specifically for Rain Nightclub, the legendary nightclub and concert venue at the Palms Casino Resort known for its special effects and international headliner acts.

She is also daughter of actress Silvia Pinal and singer Enrique Guzmán.

== Early life ==
Gabriela Alejandra Guzmán Pinal was born February 9, 1968, in Mexico City, to her mother Silvia Pinal&#x27;s third marriage. Guzmán has three siblings: two older half-sisters, actress Sylvia Pasquel and Viridiana Alatriste. Her younger brother, Luis Enrique Guzmán, is her only sibling from the same father and mother.

Guzmán grew up in the entertainment world, having two superstars as her parents. At age 14, her older sister Viridiana Alatriste died in a car crash, which affected her greatly. After her sister&#x27;s passing, she became rebellious and determined to enjoy her life to the fullest. She routinely sneaked out of her house to join the vibrant nightlife of Mexico City. During those times, Alejandra met Kenny Aviles from the band Kenny y Los Electricos, who became like a mother to her. It was then that she came to realize she belonged on the stage.

== Career ==
Guzmán began her musical career in 1988 with her first song, &quot;Bye Mamá&quot;, which she dedicated to her mother. In the 1990s, she released several of her biggest albums like &quot;Eternamente Bella&quot;, &quot;Flor de Piel&quot;, as well as &quot;Libre&quot; which launched with a signed contract to BMG Ariola. Her success placed her in being nominated to a Grammy, Latin Grammy, and her albums to be labeled Gold and Platinum.

Throughout her career, Guzmán has had success throughout Mexico and the United States. She has done duets with Franco De Vita, Mario Domm, Fonseca, and the most known Gloria Trevi. Her along with Trevi had several duets together and did the Versus Tour together from 2017-2018. Guzmán is one of the most prominent female artists of Mexico, and she has been labeled as &quot;La Reina del Rock&quot; (the Queen of Rock).

She served as judge of the second season of &quot;Va Por Ti&quot;. She also served as coach of &quot;La Voz...México&quot;. On July 5, 2018, Telemundo announced Alejandra Guzmán as a coach on La Voz (U.S.). Guzmán joined Luis Fonsi, Carlos Vives and Wisin as coaches on the Spanish-language version of NBC singing-competition &quot;The Voice&quot;. In 2020, Amazon announced her starring role in the Amazon Prime series &quot;El juego de las llaves&quot;.

In 2021, she joined the cast of the second season of the Amazon Prime Video series El Juego de las Llaves created by Marisa Quiroga, and produced by Amazon Studios, Corazón Films, and Pantaya. Guzmán was also a featured performer on the American music TV series A Tiny Audience produced by February Entertainment. for HBO Max and aired in Latin America by DirecTV Latam.

In 2022, Guzmán appeared in the premiere episode of the music-TV show ¡LaNoche!, produced by February Entertainment and aired in the US, alongside Paulina Rubio. It was the first time the two artists shared a stage. The show included cameos by their mothers, Mexican actresses Silvia Pinal and Susana Dosamantes. In 2022 Alejandra Guzmán and Paulina Rubio embarked on a 20-city US tour. The PERRÍSIMAS US TOUR 2022 kicked off in April 2022, and included major cities such as Chicago, El Paso, New York, Miami, and Las Vegas, before wrapping up on May 22 in Los Angeles. In July 2022, La Guzmán kicked off her TUYA TOUR with a sold-out show at the Arena CDMX. She was joined by special guests Silvia Pinal, Fey, Erik Rubín, and Aleks Syntek. In November 2022, Guzmán performed a series of concerts at the Venetian Las Vegas.

== Personal life ==
Alejandra Guzmán has had several relationships throughout her life. Her first public relationship was with Erik Rubin which did not last long due to conflict with Mexican singer Paulina Rubio over him. She later started a relationship with Pablo Moctezuma, a businessman with whom Guzmán has a daughter, Frida Sofía, born March 1992. She and Moctezuma later separated.

Guzmán married American businessman Farrell Goodman in 1998. The marriage was destroyed right after, when Goodman was arrested due to carrying narcotics in an airport in Germany. Her last public relationship to date was a little after her divorce from Goodman, with Gerardo Gómez de la Borbolla. They initially had a great relationship but things ended after she suffered a miscarriage and fell into a deep depression, during which time he also wanted to be part of her work team as well as launching a singing career of his own. Alejandra revealed years later that she ended up having an abortion from a second pregnancy with him.

In 2007 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and was able to survive due to early detection. In 2009 Alejandra almost died a few months after she had butt enhancement injections from unlicensed estheticians. She was injected with polymers which caused infections and for several years she has had over 30 surgical procedures to remove them from her body.

Since 2020 Guzmán and her daughter Frída Sofía have been estranged. In 2021 Frída Sofía caused a huge scandal by asserting that Guzmán&#x27;s father Enrique had sexually molested her since she was 5. Guzmán has sided fully with her father, who denies the accusations and has stated she hopes this will be solved soon enough.

<text>This is a list of films released in 1995. The highly anticipated sequel &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; was the year&#x27;s biggest box-office hit, and &quot;Braveheart&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

==Highest-grossing films==

The top 10 films released in 1995 by worldwide gross are as follows:

===Box office records===
*The &quot;Batman&quot; franchise became the fifth film franchise to gross $1 billion with the release of &quot;Batman Forever&quot;.
**&quot;Batman Forever&quot; is released in theaters and surpasses &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; for scoring the highest-opening weekend of all time, generating a total of $52.8 million.

===Film records===
* &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; has been running in theaters for 27 years, becoming the longest running film in theaters 

===Context===

The theatrical box office of 1994 achieved record grosses, with nine films earning more than $100million and the highest attendance (1.29billion) since 1960 (1.3billion). By 1995, however, the average cost of making and marketing a film had doubled since 1990, reaching $50.4million, making turning a profit more difficult. The rising salary cost of actors was a contributing factor; studios vied to secure popular actors such as Harrison Ford, Jim Carrey, Tom Cruise, and Arnold Schwarzenegger who could generally guarantee a minimum level of box-office success and held broad appeal outside of the United States and Canada. If notable stars were unavailable, studios were forced to pay exorbitant salaries for less-well-known stars and pay other cast lower salaries to offset costs. In 1995, theatrical box-office revenue was falling; the first quarter was about $90million lower than the same period in 1994. Markets outside of the U.S. and Canada were growing, accounting for 41% of a film&#x27;s total revenue—including theatrical and home media profits—and outperformed the U.S. and Canadian box offices for the first time in 1994. Anticipated films such as &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, and &quot;Pocahontas&quot; were scheduled for release alongside &quot;Waterworld&quot;, the most-expensive film of its time.

He is one of the pioneers of Rock &amp; Roll in Mexico, along with César Costa, Angélica María, Johnny Laboriel and Alberto Vasquez, among others. He is also the father of Mexican singer Alejandra Guzmán by his former wife, actress and singer Silvia Pinal.

Guzmán has been a rock star in Mexico throughout the last half of the 20th century, known primarily for his translation of 1950s rock standards, such as &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, for Spanish-speaking listeners. In 1958 he joined &quot;Los Teen Tops&quot;, along with the Martínez brothers and piano player, Sergio Martel. In 1959 they debuted in the US on CBS radio, and they released their famous version of &quot;La Plaga&quot; (Good Golly Miss Molly). He also wrote several hits for himself &quot;Pensaba en tí&quot;, &quot;La Ronchita&quot;, and for other Latin stars. 
He also appeared in films, such as &quot;Canta Mi Corazón&quot; in 1965. His hits include Spanish covers of &quot;Put Your Head on My Shoulder&quot;, &quot;Rolly Polly&quot;, &quot;Bonnie Moronie&quot; as well as the original &quot;Dame Felicidad&quot; (&quot;Give Me Joy&quot;). During the mid-1960s Guzmán formed a motion picture company and produced some films in Ecuador. In the late 1960s, Guzman and his wife, Silvia Pinal, starred in a television show called &quot;Silvia y Enrique&quot;. He has continued recording, including with his daughter Alejandra Guzmán, throughout the 1990s and 2000s. As with his ex-wife, his stepdaughter Sylvia Pasquel, and his daughter, he has his handprints embedded onto the Paseo de las Luminarias; he was inducted in 1983 for his work in the recording industry.

<doc id="169228" wikidata="Q1772698" url="?curid=169228" title="Affair">
<text>An affair is a relationship typically between two people, one or both of whom are either married or in a long-term relationship with someone else. The affair can be solely sexual or solely physical or solely emotional – or a combination of these. People who involve themselves in affairs do so out of the need for just sex, an intimate relationship, passionate attachment or a combination, which is often referred to as a &quot;soul tie&quot;. 

Relationships are considered to be contracts. They may be a formal one like marriage – consisting of both a verbal and written contract, or an informal one – consisting of only verbal contract. Because most affairs are clandestine in nature, an affair breaks those contracts. Clandestine affairs can commonly cause feelings of betrayal to the other person in the primary relationship. Ironically, affairs themselves are also contracted relationships and come with numerous stipulations and rules. 

An affair is different from a &quot;fling&quot; in that it is usually long-term. The word for the most-likely unmarried partner in an affair is the gender-neutral French &quot;paramour&quot;. Affairs are often emotionally lopsided in that paramour will be the only one to heavily invest themselves into the affair.

==Romantic affair==

A romantic affair, also called an affair of the heart, may refer to a sexual liaison or more emotional relationship between two people who may have sex without expecting a more formal romantic relationship. 

The term &quot;affair&quot; may also describe part of an agreement within an open marriage or open relationship, such as swinging, dating, or polyamory, in which some forms of sex with one&#x27;s non-primary partner(s) are permitted and other forms are not. Participants in open relationships, including unmarried couples and polyamorous families, may consider sanctioned affairs the norm, but when a non-sanctioned affair occurs, it is described as infidelity and maybe experienced as adultery, or a betrayal both of trust and integrity, even though to most people it would not be considered illicit.

When romantic affairs lack both overt and covert sexual behavior, yet exhibit intense or enduring emotional intimacy, it may also be referred to as an emotional affair, platonic love, or a romantic friendship.

== Extramarital affair ==

Extramarital affairs are relationships outside of marriage where an illicit romantic or sexual relationship or a romantic friendship or passionate attachment occurs.

An affair can continue in one form or another for years, even as one of the partners in that affair passes through marriage, divorce, and remarriage. This could be considered the primary relationship, with the marriage secondary to it. Several people claim the reason for an extramarital affair is their unsuccessful marriage where both spouses fail to please each other. Dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, Adventure , Impulse , are the major reasons of romantic affairs. This may be serial polygamy or other forms of nonmonogamy.

The ability to pursue serial and clandestine extramarital affairs while safeguarding other secrets and conflict of interest inherent in the practice, requires skill in deception and duplicitous negotiation. Even to hide one affair requires a degree of skill or malicious gaslighting. All these behaviors are more usually called lying.

Deception can be defined as the &quot;covert manipulation of perception to alter thoughts, feelings, or beliefs&quot;. The presence of deception may indicate the degree to which the deceiver has breached fundamental conditions of fidelity, reciprocal vulnerability, and transparency. Sometimes these are explicit or assumed pre-conditions of a committed intimate relationship.

Individuals having affairs with married men or women can be prosecuted for adultery in some jurisdictions and can be sued by the jilted spouses in others, or named as &#x27;co-respondents&#x27; in divorce proceedings. As of 2009, eight U.S. states permitted such alienation of affections lawsuits. Affairs with the consent of their significant others may not be considered infidelity or adultery.

=== Extramarital Affairs in Different Cultures and Legal Systems ===
Extramarital affairs are viewed and treated differently across various cultures and legal systems, reflecting distinct social norms, religious beliefs, and legal frameworks. In some countries, extramarital affairs are strictly condemned and can lead to serious legal or social consequences, while in others they are more socially accepted or legally tolerated. 

=== Islamic Jurisprudence and Legal Standards ===
According to classical Islamic jurisprudence, testimony for the crime of adultery must be provided by at least four male Muslim witnesses. Some legal schools allow the substitution of up to three male witnesses with six female witnesses, but at least one witness must be male. The witnesses must be of sound mind, reliable character, and unrelated to the involved parties. This legal system emphasizes the sanctity of marriage and regards infidelity as a severe breach of religious and moral principles.

=== Legal Treatment in Iran ===
In some countries like Iran, extramarital affairs (zinā) are considered serious offenses and can result in punishments such as flogging or, in some cases, stoning, depending on the evidence and circumstances. Stoning has historically been used as a punishment for adultery in some cases, particularly for married offenders. In one notable case, Iran carried out the stoning of two men convicted of adultery in Mashhad, as confirmed by judiciary spokesman Ali Reza Jamshidi. Despite a 2002 directive from Iran’s judiciary imposing a moratorium on stoning and its subsequent removal from the draft penal code, some stoning sentences have continued to be implemented. The most recent reported stoning execution took place in 2007. International human rights organizations have criticized stoning as a punitive measure, describing it as a &quot;grotesque&quot; practice that intensifies the suffering of those sentenced.

=== Alienation of Affection Lawsuits in North Carolina ===
In North Carolina, an alienation of affection lawsuit is still legally recognized. A spouse who believes their marriage has been damaged due to the interference of a third party can sue for financial damages. The lawsuit claims that the third party’s actions disrupted the marital relationship, leading to the breakdown of affection between the plaintiff and their spouse. North Carolina law does not require proof of extramarital sex; the plaintiff must demonstrate that genuine affection existed within the marriage and that the third party’s wrongful and malicious actions led to the alienation of that affection. Damages can include both economic and non-economic compensation, such as loss of earnings or emotional distress. 

=== French Political Culture and Extramarital Affairs ===
In some cases, extramarital affairs among the French elite and politicians have been regarded as private matters and have not significantly impacted their political careers. For instance, François Mitterrand, former president of France, maintained a long-term relationship outside his marriage and fathered a daughter with his mistress. Although the affair was known within political circles, it remained largely undisclosed to the public until after his death, with minimal effect on his political reputation. This reflects a cultural attitude in France—and perhaps in other countries—where extramarital relationships are sometimes viewed as separate from public responsibilities and are less likely to influence political standing. 

=== Public Opinion ===
Public opinion surveys reveal that French society is notably more tolerant of extramarital affairs compared to other nations, particularly regarding the personal lives of political figures. A 2013 Pew Research Center study highlighted that only 47% of French respondents considered infidelity morally unacceptable, making it the lowest rate among 39 countries surveyed. This is in stark contrast to the United States, where 84% of respondents viewed infidelity as morally wrong. Such findings reflect a significant cultural divergence in how private morality is perceived in public life.This tolerance is further underscored by a 2014 Pew Research Center report, which examined attitudes toward infidelity across eight European Union nations. The report revealed a median disapproval rate of 65%, yet France again recorded the lowest level of moral condemnation among the surveyed countries. These results suggest that French society prioritizes professional competence and political effectiveness over personal behavior, particularly when evaluating public figures.The leniency in public opinion likely contributes to the resilience of French politicians’ careers despite personal controversies. It also shapes media coverage in France, where the press traditionally avoids delving into politicians&#x27; private lives unless directly relevant to their roles. This cultural attitude reinforces the separation between personal morality and public responsibilities in French society.
==Online affair==
The appearance of computer-mediated communication introduces a new type of communication and consequently a new type of &quot;affair&quot;. There are various kinds of computer-mediated communication that differ in some significant aspects: one-to-one or group communication formats, interrelating with anonymous or identified people and communicating in synchronous or asynchronous formats. Online affairs combine features of close and remote relationships.

Ben Ze&#x27;ef argues that an online affair is a unique kind of affair—termed &quot;detached attachment&quot;, or just &quot;detachment&quot;—that includes opposing features whose presence in a face-to-face affair would be paradoxical. Like direct, face-to-face affairs, online affairs can be spontaneous and casual and show intensive personal involvement. However, online affairs can also be more of a planned discourse than spontaneous talk; like written letters, online messages can be stored and thus have a permanent presence, which is absent from face-to-face affairs.

People participating in online affairs may be strangers to each other in the sense that they have never actually met each other. However, they are also close to each other since they share intimate information. In online affairs, people try to enjoy the benefits of both close and remote affairs, while avoiding their flaws. People enjoy the highly valued products of close affairs while paying the low cost of remote affairs. As one woman wrote: &#x27;He constantly told me that he can not provide me with what I would want and I would always respond with: &quot;I&#x27;m not asking anything from you, but simply enjoy your company&quot;&#x27;.

<doc id="169229" wikidata="Q5446856" url="?curid=169229" title="Fiel a La Vega">
<text>Fiel a La Vega is a Rock en Español band from Puerto Rico formed in 1994. The band consisted of members Tito Auger and Ricky Laureano (vocals and guitars), who come from the northern city of Vega Alta, Puerto Rico, along with brothers Pedro and Jorge Arraiza (drums and bass), who come from the neighboring city of Vega Baja. Their hometown is what gave name to the band. Since 1996, they were joined by percussionist Papo Román, who left the band in 2006 to spend time with his family.

The band rose to prominence with their eponymous debut album, which was released in 1996. The album was a hit, spawning several hit singles like &quot;Salimos de Aquí&quot; and &quot;El Wanabí&quot;, and turning the band into one of the most popular musical groups in the island at the moment. Fiel a la Vega followed their debut album with four more studio albums, three of which were released independently. Despite not having the support of a multinational record label or wide publicity, after 20 years, the band is still considered by many as &quot;the most important rock band in the history of Puerto Rico&quot;.

In recent years, the band has left the hectic production/gigging schedule, with its members being involved in personal projects. Singer Auger has been touring the island solo, and with a musical troupe called La Banda Acústica Rodante, while guitarist Laureano has been pursuing a solo career, while also touring the island with fellow guitarist Joel Rodríguez. Brothers Pedro and Jorge continue to work as a professor and chef respectively, while also working on their own band, Los Arraiza Voladores and featuring with the acoustic cover band Good Acoustics. In October 2016 the band performed at the Coliseo of Puerto Rico to celebrate their 20th anniversary accompanied by former member Papo Román and keyboards played by Francisco &quot;Quito&quot; González. The concert had an attendance of 7,000 people and lasted 3 and a half hours commemorating their two decades playing music.

==Band history==

===Early years (1994-1995)===
Childhood friends Ricky Laureano and Tito Auger formed the band in 1994 after looking for success in the United States. Returning to Puerto Rico, they joined long-time friends Pedro and Jorge Arraiza (with whom they had played before in &quot;Los Arraiza Voladores&quot;) and officially started the band. After playing local gigs through the island, they started gaining the attention of the public and became one of the most sought bands in the island. Their television debut was in &quot;Voces en Función&quot;.

===First Albums and Success (1996-1998)===
In April 1996, the band released their eponymous album &quot;Fiel a la Vega&quot;, adding percussionist Papo Román to its line-up. The album spawned hits like &quot;Salimos de Aquí&quot; and &quot;El Wanabí&quot;, both of which were released with videos. According to local newspaper &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot;, the album was among the Top 10 sellers of the year. In August 1996, the band played at Hard Rock Cafe in Old San Juan. In 1997, their first album was certified gold for selling 50,000 units.

Following the success of the album, the band held four sold-out concerts in July 1997 in the Performing Arts Center of Guaynabo. The concert was released months later as the band&#x27;s follow-up album, titled &quot;El Concierto Acústico&quot;. In the concert, the band played acoustic versions of the songs in their first album as well as covers from Latin American artists that influenced them such as Roy Brown, Leon Gieco, Silvio Rodríguez, and Haciendo Punto en Otro Son.

The band continued to enjoy the success playing in front of 30,000 people at the Claridad Festival. That night an attendance record at the festival was set. That same year, they participated in the annual special show of Banco Popular dedicated to Bobby Capó. The band performed the song &quot;Sale el Sol&quot; in the show.

In 1998, amidst relentless touring, they released &quot;A Quien Pueda Interesar&quot;. The album was accompanied with videos for the songs &quot;Bla, Bla, Bla&quot;, &quot;Al Frente&quot;, and &quot;El Panal&quot;. Following the success of this second album, they became the first Puerto Rican band to headline and sell out the Roberto Clemente Coliseum. The concert was held on June 6, 1998.

In November of the same year, they returned to the Roberto Clemente Coliseum, sharing the stage with local bands Haciendo Punto en Otro Son and Moliendo Vidrio. During the concert, the bands alternated sets performing the hit songs of each other, ending with a huge &quot;junte&quot; of all of the musicians singing several songs of each band. The concert was recorded and released later as an album titled &quot;Un Junte para la Historia&quot;.

===Deal with EMI Latin (1999-2001)===
In March 1999, the band organized a series of concerts at the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center where they performed their music with a symphonic orchestra, not The Puerto Rico Symphonic Orchestra, as it is sometimes stated. In the concert, they played their hits as well as covers from Rubén Blades, Danny Rivera, Silvio Rodríguez, and Puerto Rican Salsa superstars El Gran Combo. At that time, the band finished negotiating a record deal with EMI Latin. Soon after, they released &quot;Tres&quot; being their only CD with a major label. The band produced the hit singles &quot;Canción en la Arena&quot;, &quot;Solamente&quot; and &quot;Desde el Comienzo&quot;.

In April 2000, the band toured the East Coast of the United States with shows in Miami, Orlando, New York City, and Washington, DC. In June 2000, upon returning to Puerto Rico, the band held a concert at the Rubén Rodríguez Coliseum in Bayamón. In August 2001, they collaborated with other artists in a song titled &quot;Canción para Vieques&quot;, about the Navy-Vieques protests.

===Last albums (2001-2010)===
In November 2001, they parted ways with EMI Latin. A month later, they released their second live album titled &quot;El Concierto Sinfónico&quot;. They followed it with presentations in the island and in Florida, while they began to work in their fourth studio album. The album &quot;La Prosperidad&quot; was released independently in December 2002 with the single &quot;Hay que Edificar&quot;. They supported it with a national tour through all the island finishing on May 31, 2002, with a concert at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum.

In 2005, they released a greatest hits album to coincide with the band&#x27;s tenth anniversary. &quot;Desde el Comienzo: 1994-2004&quot;.

On October 11, 2006, percussionist Papo Román communicated by letter to his &quot; friends, press, musicians and dear fieles&quot; that he will be quitting the band after ten long years with them. He stated that, despite not regretting the time spent with the band, he needed to slow down and dedicate time to his family. Román is the father of six children, two of them teenage daughters.

In 2007, the band was selected along with several Latin rock groups to be part of a marketing campaign from Absolut Vodka. The campaign features the popular Absolut bottle silhouette using the motif of Fiel a la Vega&#x27;s first album. The other bands selected were Los Amigos Invisibles (Venezuela), Charly García (Argentina), Los Jaivas (Chile) and Aterciopelados (Colombia).

In March 2007, the band recorded a live concert at the Ambassador Theater in San Juan. At the end of the year, the concert was released in a DVD titled &quot;&quot;. Also, according to their website, they started working on a new album.

In April 2008, the band played at the &quot;Movistar Music Fest 2008&quot; in Panama, with Tego Calderón, Calle 13, and Zion.

In early 2010, the band released the first single from their next album. The album, titled &quot;Equilibrio&quot;, was released on February 9, 2010. On December of that year, the band started a series of concerts on the cities of San Juan, Ponce, and Mayaguez. The concert in San Juan was supposed to be held at the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras, but due to ongoing strikes and protests at the university against the government, the band moved it to the Centro de Bellas Artes in Caguas. During the concert, lead singer Tito Auger heavily criticized the government for its handling of the crisis at the university and the current state of the country. &quot;In recent years, it has been made more evident that the alleged democracy that protects us is only a mask for the media, a simple slogan. We are dominated by a plutocracy, which is an industrial, business, and political class, that is getting stronger and richer&quot; said Auger.

=== Recent years ===

In recent years, the members have all been involved in their own projects. Singer Tito Auger has been performing with La Banda Acústica Rodante, which features fellow singers and musicians Mikie Rivera, Rucco Gandía, Walter Morciglio, and Nore Feliciano, while guitarist Ricky Laureano has launched a solo career, releasing two albums and occasionally touring under the name of Laureano &amp; Rodríguez, along with Joel Rodríguez. Laureano explained in an interview that &quot;saying we [Fiel a la Vega] will continue to make music together is more complicated than ever because everybody is doing his own thing. Tito and I are dedicated full-time to music, Jorge is a chef, and Pedro is a professor; so it wouldn&#x27;t be impossible, but it&#x27;s an uphill battle.&quot;

On October 18, 2014, Fiel a la Vega held a sold-out concert at Bahía Urbana in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in front of nearly 5,500 people. During the concert, which lasted more than 3 hours, the band played songs that spanned their 18-year trajectory. The concert was also broadcast through the Internet.

In October 2016 the band performed on the Coliseo of Puerto Rico to celebrate their 20th anniversary accompanied by former member Papo Román and keyboards played by Francisco &quot;Quito&quot; González. The concert had an attendance of 7,000 people and lasted three and a half hours commemorating their two decades playing music.

On August 18, 2018, they sold out hotspot venue VIVO Beach Club with a show including hits from all their albums. The show featured giant projection screens on which videos allusive to the songs were shown.
In October 2019 they sold out two shows at San Juan&quot;s Luis A. Ferre Performing Arts Center of their acoustic show accompanied by a string quartet directed by Ricardo &quot;Papoi&quot; Dávila and with pianist Jorge &quot;Bebo&#x27; Rivera. 
They followed up in November 2nd with &quot;Rocktoberfest @ VIVO Beach Club&quot; alongside Puerto Rican rock bands Vivanativa, La Secta and Millo Torres y el Tercer Planeta. hosted by comedian Chente Ydrach. For this show Ocean Lab Brewery (located at VIVO Beach Club) produced one distinct beer for each of the bands and the host, to their specifications and those were the only beers available during the Fest.
On July 27, 2020, they broadcast a live, socially distanced show over social media platforms which collected nearly half a million views in two days. In this show they played their 1998 album &quot;A Quien Pueda Interesar&quot; entirely. They also announced new material in the works.
In August 2023, the band released &quot;Prima•Vera&quot;, their sixth studio album and the first in more than 13 years. Guitarist Ricky Laureano said the new album represented &quot;a musical rebirth for us and a testimony of our commitment to music&quot;.

<text>Miami Sound Machine was an American Latin pop band of Latin-influenced music that featured the vocals of Cuban-born recording artist Gloria Estefan (née Fajardo). Established in 1975 by Emilio Estefan, the band was originally known as the Miami Latin Boys before becoming the Miami Sound Machine in 1977.

The band released 13 albums and a string of hit singles until 1989. The band&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Primitive Love&quot; credited the band whereas their follow-up album &quot;Let It Loose&quot; in 1987 placed Gloria Estefan at the forefront. From 1988 to 1989, the latter album was also repackaged as &quot;Anything For You&quot; with new cover art with the international release in Europe, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1989, the group&#x27;s name ceased being included on the CD or album products—as Estefan continued as a solo artist.

==History==
===1970s===
In 1975, Gloria and her cousin Mercedes &quot;Merci&quot; Navarro (1957–2007) met Emilio Estefan Jr. while performing at a church ensemble rehearsal. Estefan, who had formed the band The Miami Latin Boys earlier that year, learned about Gloria through a mutual acquaintance.

While The Miami Latin Boys were performing at a Cuban wedding at Hotel Dupont, Gloria and Merci (who were wedding guests) performed two Cuban standards impromptu. They impressed The Miami Latin Boys so much that they were invited to join the band permanently; thereby, the band&#x27;s name was changed to The Miami Sound Machine. Gloria, who was attending the University of Miami at the time, only agreed to perform during the weekends so that her studies would not be interrupted.

In 1977, Miami Sound Machine began recording and releasing various albums and 45s on Audiofon Records in Miami, Florida. The group&#x27;s primary lineup consisted of six Cuban-born Americans:

* Emilio Estefan Jr. (percussion and accordion) 
* Gloria Fajardo (lead vocals and hand percussion) 
* Merci Navarro (lead vocals) and her husband Raul Murciano (keyboards) 
* Enrique &quot;Kiki&quot; Garcia (drums) 
* Juan Marcos Avila (bass)

====&quot;Live Again/Renacer&quot; ====
In 1977, Miami Sound Machine&#x27;s first album &quot;Live Again/Renacer&quot; was released with two different covers. The group had several more releases on the Audiofon label, the RCA Victor label, and subsequently Miami Sound Machine&#x27;s own label Miami Sound Machine Records. In 1978, Gloria married Emilio Estefan Jr. after two years of dating. In 1979, Miami Sound Machine added American guitarist and native Miamian, Wesley B. Wright, and Cuban-born Fernando Garcia on trumpet (unrelated to &quot;Kiki&quot; Garcia).

====&quot;Miami Sound Machine&quot;====
By the end of 1979, the band was signed to Discos CBS International. Miami Sound Machine then released several albums, 45s, and twelve-inch singles beginning with the 1980 self-titled &quot;Miami Sound Machine&quot;. The combination of traditional Latin rhythms and American R&amp;B grooves combined with the songwriting of Gloria Estefan, &quot;Kiki&quot; Garcia, and Wesley B. Wright) set a crossover musical standard for the next two decades to come.

===1980s===
During the 1980s, with the popularity of Miami-based films and television series such as &quot;Scarface,&quot; &quot;Invasion U.S.A.&quot;, and &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, the city was gaining a reputation as an exciting and notorious destination. South Beach and the remainder of Dade County was also attracting attention. NFL Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino was breaking football records and adding to the Miami mystique.

====&quot;Otra Vez&quot;====
In 1980, Miami Sound Machine added a more complete horn section primarily consisting of trumpeters Fernando Garcia and Victor &quot;Papito&quot; Lopez and trombonist Louis Perez. The permanent addition of a full horn section added a new dimension and would become a future Miami Sound Machine musical trademark. MSM using this lineup flew to San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1981 to record their second LP on the C.B.S. International label. The album was entitled &quot;Otra Vez&quot; and was recorded at Ochoa Studios in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This would be the last LP to feature the early signature sound of two female vocalists (Gloria and her cousin Merci) singing both in harmony and unison.

====&quot;Rio&quot;====
By early 1982, Roger Fisher was added as a second keyboardist, as well as the virtuoso harmonica player Gustavo Lezcano. Merci and Raul left the band in late 1982, just prior to the recording of the third CBS International LP &quot;Rio&quot;. The painfully shy Gloria was now the sole lead vocalist on stage and in the studio. As a result, she began to evolve both systematically and stylistically in her performances. Fisher filled Raul&#x27;s piano duties. At the same time, Betty Cortés was brought in as replacement for Fisher&#x27;s second keyboardist role and to sing background vocals live and occasionally in the studio. During the same time period, Elena Stracuzzi was brought in to sing background vocals for live performances. In 1983, Leo Villar was added as second trumpeter to replace Fernando Garcia who had left the prior year.

====&quot;Eyes of Innocence&quot;====

Miami Sound Machine was now a large ensemble. Despite an eclectic lineup, Miami Sound Machine was focused primarily on the founding members:

* Gloria and Emilio Estefan
* Enrique &quot;Kiki&quot; Garcia
* Juan Marcos Avila
* Wesley B. Wright

By the early 1980s, Miami Sound Machine had established themselves as major musical artists in Latin America with a strong presence in both the media and on the radio. The next major hurdle was conquered in early 1984 when a Dutch DJ began playing &quot;Dr. Beat&quot; in Amsterdam. Garcia&#x27;s catchy lyrics, Gloria&#x27;s sassy vocals, Wright&#x27;s funky guitar, and Emilio&#x27;s infectious conga drums took Europe by storm with the tune eventually reaching the top 10 in the UK and most of Continental Europe, finally causing record labels in the US Market to take notice of the group&#x27;s strong musical prowess.

In late 1984, the group released their first Epic/Columbia album, &quot;Eyes of Innocence&quot;, which contained the Garcia-penned classic, previously released, single and dance hit &quot;Dr. Beat&quot; as well as the ballad &quot;I Need Your Love&quot;.

====&quot;Primitive Love&quot;====

Miami Sound Machine&#x27;s follow-up album &quot;Primitive Love&quot; was released in 1985. While the horn section were featured on prominent cuts, guitarist Wesley B. Wright was the only member of the core rhythm section to actually record on the LP. On all of the previous LPs, the band members almost exclusively recorded the original studio tracks. In 1985, there would be personnel changes:

* Phenom session percussionist Rafael Padílla, who performed on some of the LP&#x27;s tracks, was now a permanent member. 
* Chicago native Jim &quot;Sport&quot; Trompeter replaced Betty Wright (née Cortés) on second keyboards.
* Venezuelan jazz saxophonist Ed Callé performed on the LP and was added to the horn section.

The successful LP launched three top 10 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: the Garcia-penned &quot;Conga&quot; reached No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; &quot;Bad Boy&quot; reached No. 8 and &quot;Words Get in the Way&quot; (written by Gloria Estefan) reaching No. 5 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the US Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, establishing that the group could perform pop ballads as successfully as dance tunes. At the end of 1985, the stalwart horn section was now in flux, with session player Dana Teboe filling the trombone position in place of the original trombonist, Louis Perez. By early 1986, Victor &quot;Papito&quot; Lopez (visually known for his iconic jet black Cuban mustache) was subsequently replaced by Randy Barlow. By the end of 1986, Teddy Mulet became the band&#x27;s official trombonist.

===Appearances and soundtracks ===
In 1985, Miami Sound Machine appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Johnny Carson, &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;, Walt Disney specials, and frequent spots on &quot;MTV&quot;. The band twice performed on the television presentation of the Miss Universe Pageant (1984; 1986). The song &quot;Hot Summer Nights&quot; was also released that year and was part of the soundtrack for the film &quot;Top Gun.&quot; The song &quot;Suavé&quot; was also recorded as part of the soundtrack for the Sylvester Stallone film &quot;Cobra&quot;. Miami Sound Machine also made a cameo appearance in the ABC Sunday Night Movie &quot;Club Med&quot;.

After a massive world tour that ran from 1985 to 1986, the following members left the group: guitarist Wesley B. Wright; founding bassist Juan Marcos Avila; and keyboardist Roger Fisher. Emilio assumed the role of producer and no longer performed live.

=== &quot;Let It Loose / Anything for You&quot; ===

Miami Sound Machine returned to the studio in early 1987, and bassist Jorgé &quot;George&quot; Casas on bass, keyboardist Clay Ostwald, and guitarist John DeFaria joined the remaining members. With &quot;Kiki&quot; Garcia being the remaining core member, Gloria Estefan was given top billing and the band&#x27;s name was changed to Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine to capitalize on the lead singer&#x27;s mass appeal.

In late 1987, Miami Sound Machine released &quot;Let It Loose&quot;, and it went multi-platinum, with three million copies sold in the US alone. It featured the hits &quot;Anything for You&quot; reaching number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;1-2-3&quot; making it to No. 3, &quot;Betcha Say That&quot; to number 36, &quot;Rhythm Is Gonna Get You&quot; to No. 5, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stay Away from You&quot; to No. 6. &quot;Can&#x27;t Stay Away from You&quot;, &quot;Anything for You&quot; and &quot;1-2-3&quot; were also top charting singles on the Adult Contemporary hits.

Another world tour began and the group traveled for the first time to Europe, South America. and an even more extensive tour in the United States, culminating with a sold-out concert in their hometown of Miami, Florida, which was recorded and later sold on VHS. By 1988, founding member &quot;Kiki&quot; Garcia quit. With no other core members remaining other than Gloria herself, the &quot;Miami Sound Machine&quot; moniker was to be used from that point on for concerts and live performances only.

In 1988, after the worldwide chart success of single &quot;Anything for You&quot;, her &quot;Let it Loose&quot; album was repackaged overseas as &quot;Anything for You.&quot; It became the band&#x27;s first UK number 1 album, selling over a million copies. It was the biggest selling album of the year in The Netherlands, staying at number 1 for 16 weeks. The album also took top honors in Australia and Canada, launching Gloria Estefan to superstar status.

By the end of 1988, none of the originating members Miami Sound Machine were performing with Estefan. A new rhythm section was put in place, and the horn section was expanded.

Although there have been changes in personnel, three members (Jorge Casas, Clay Ostwald and Teddy Mulet) have performed with Estefan since 1986. The current rhythm section has been in place since 1992 (with the subsequent addition of drummer Olbin Burgos and percussionist Edwin Bonilla). Seven members of the Miami Sound Machine lineage appeared in New York City&#x27;s staging of the Broadway show &quot;On Your Feet!&quot;: Jorge Casas, Clay Ostwald, Teddy Mulet, Olbin Burgos, Edwin Bonilla, Tom Timko and David Fernandez.

=== Revamping attempt ===
In 2002, an attempt was made to create a shoot-off &quot;Miami Sound Machine&quot; with a new eponymous album (produced by Emilio Estefan) and a completely different lineup consisting of Lorena Pinot, Sohanny Gross and Carla Ramirez.

Without Gloria Estefan&#x27;s signature vocals or any real connection to the preexisting Miami Sound Machine musicians, however, the new project was only met with moderate success in a few select European countries and failed to chart significantly in the United States.

<text>Gloria María Milagrosa Estefan (née Fajardo García; born September 1, 1957) () is a Cuban-American singer, actress, and businesswoman. Estefan is an eight-time Grammy Award winner, a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, and has been named one of the Top 100 greatest artists of all time by both VH1 and &quot;Billboard&quot;. Estefan&#x27;s record sales exceed 100 million worldwide, making her one of the best-selling female singers of all time. Many of Estefan&#x27;s songs became international chart-topping hits, including &quot;1-2-3&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Lose You&quot;, &quot;Coming Out of the Dark&quot;, &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;, and &quot;Heaven&#x27;s What I Feel&quot;. Other hits include &quot;Bad Boy&quot;, &quot;Rhythm Is Gonna Get You&quot;, &quot;Get On Your Feet&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;ll Be Mine (Party Time)&quot;.

A contralto, Estefan started her career as lead singer of Miami Latin Boys, which was later renamed Miami Sound Machine. She and Miami Sound Machine earned worldwide success with their 1985 single &quot;Conga&quot;, which became Estefan&#x27;s signature song and led to Miami Sound Machine winning the 15th annual Tokyo Music Festival&#x27;s grand prix in 1986. In 1988, she and Miami Sound Machine achieved their first number-one hit with &quot;Anything for You&quot;.

In March 1990, Estefan sustained a life-threatening cervical fracture of her spine when her tour bus was involved in a serious crash near Scranton, Pennsylvania. She underwent an emergency surgical stabilization of her cervical spine and post-surgical rehabilitation that lasted almost a year, but made a full recovery. A year later, in March 1991, Estefan launched her comeback with a worldwide tour and album, &quot;Into the Light&quot;.

Estefan&#x27;s 1993 Spanish-language album, &quot;Mi Tierra&quot;, won the first of her three Grammy Awards for Best Tropical Latin Album. The album was also the first Diamond album in Spain. Estefan has been awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Las Vegas Walk of Fame and was a Kennedy Center Honors recipient in 2017 for her contributions to American cultural life. Estefan won an MTV Video Music Award, was honored with the American Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, and has been named BMI Songwriter of the Year. She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and has received multiple &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. She is also a recipient of the 2015 Presidential Medal of Freedom.

&quot;Billboard&quot; has listed Estefan as the third-most successful Latina and 23rd-greatest Latin Artist of all time in the U.S., based on both Latin albums and Latin songs chart. Hailed as the &quot;Queen of Latin Pop&quot; by the media, she has amassed 38 number one hits across &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, including 15 chart-topping songs on the Hot Latin Songs chart.

== Early life and education ==
=== Early life ===
Gloria Estefan (née Fajardo García) was born Gloria María Milagrosa Fajardo García in Havana, Cuba on September 1, 1957 to parents José Fajardo (1933–1980) and Gloria García (1930–2017). Estefan&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Spanish immigrants. Her maternal grandfather, Leonardo García, emigrated to Cuba from Pola de Siero, Asturias, Spain, where he married Gloria&#x27;s grandmother, Consuelo Pérez, who was originally from Logroño, Spain. Consuelo&#x27;s father Pantaleón Pérez served as the head chef to two Cuban presidents. Estefan&#x27;s paternal side also had musical sensibilities, as the lineage had a famous flautist and a classical pianist.

Estefan&#x27;s mother Gloria Fajardo, nicknamed &quot;Big Gloria&quot;, won an international contest during her childhood and received a Hollywood offer to dub Shirley Temple&#x27;s films in Spanish. However, Leonardo García did not permit his daughter to pursue the offer. Gloria Fajardo earned a Ph.D. in education in Cuba, but her diploma and other papers were destroyed by Cuban officials when she left for the United States.

Estefan&#x27;s paternal grandparents were José Manuel Fajardo González and Amelia Montano. José Manuel was a Cuban soldier and a motor escort for the wife of Cuban president Fulgencio Batista, and Amelia Montano was a poet. As a result of the Cuban Revolution, the Fajardo family fled and settled in Miami, in 1959, and ran one of the first Cuban restaurants in the city. In 1961, Estefan&#x27;s father José participated in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. He was captured by his cousin, who was a member of Fidel Castro&#x27;s army, and imprisoned in Cuba for nearly two years. On his return, he joined the United States military and fought in the Vietnam War.

After returning from the Vietnam War in 1968, Estefan&#x27;s father became ill with multiple sclerosis, attributed to Agent Orange exposure that he suffered in Vietnam. Estefan helped her mother care for him and her younger sister Rebecca, nicknamed &quot;Becky&quot; (b. 1963), while her mother worked to support them. Gloria Fajardo first had to regain her teaching credentials, then worked as a schoolteacher for the Dade County Public School system. When Estefan was nine, she alleged that a music teacher hired to teach her guitar lessons sexually abused her. She alleged that the man told her that he would kill her mother if she told anyone about the abuse. Estefan told her mother who alerted the police of the allegation; charges were not pressed because of the additional trauma she felt Estefan would undergo as a result of testifying against the perpetrator. When Estefan was 16, her father&#x27;s illness led him to be hospitalized at a Veterans Administration medical facility.

Estefan became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1974 under the name Gloria Garcia Fajardo.

=== Education ===
Estefan was raised Catholic and attended Our Lady of Lourdes Academy in Miami, where she was a member of the National Honor Society.

Estefan attended the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, where she graduated in 1979 with a B.A. in psychology and a minor in French. While attending the University of Miami, Estefan also worked as an English, Spanish, and French translator at Miami International Airport&#x27;s Customs Department and, because of her language abilities, says she was once approached by the CIA as a possible employee. In 1984, she was inducted into the Iron Arrow Honor Society, the highest honor bestowed by the University of Miami.

== Career ==

=== 1975–1988: Miami Sound Machine ===
In 1975, Estefan and her cousin Mercedes &quot;Merci&quot; Navarro (1957–2007) met Emilio Estefan, Jr. while performing at a church ensemble rehearsal. Emilio, who had formed the band the Miami Latin Boys earlier in that year, learned about Estefan through a mutual acquaintance. While the Miami Latin Boys were performing at a Cuban wedding at the Dupont Plaza Hotel, Estefan and Navarro, who were wedding guests, performed two Cuban standards impromptu. They impressed the Miami Latin Boys so much that they were invited to join the band permanently with the band&#x27;s name changing to Miami Sound Machine. Estefan, who was attending the University of Miami at the time, only agreed to perform during the weekends so that her studies would not be interrupted.

In 1977, Miami Sound Machine began recording and releasing various albums and 45s on the Audiofon Records label in Miami. Their first album was titled &quot;Live Again/Renacer&quot; (1977). After several more releases on the Audiofon, RCA Victor, and MSM Records labels, the band was signed to Discos CBS International and released several albums beginning with the 1978 self-titled album &quot;Miami Sound Machine&quot;. In 1978, Gloria married Emilio Estefan Jr. after two years of dating. Growing in popularity in both the U.S. and around the world, the group continued recording and issuing various works for Discos CBS International through 1985.

In 1984, Miami Sound Machine released their first Epic/Columbia album, &quot;Eyes of Innocence&quot;, which included the dance hit &quot;Dr. Beat&quot; and the ballad &quot;I Need Your Love&quot;. Their more successful follow-up album &quot;Primitive Love&quot; was released in 1985, and contained three Top 10 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;Conga&quot; (U.S. No. 10), &quot;Words Get in the Way&quot; (U.S. No. 5), and &quot;Bad Boy&quot; (U.S. No. 8), as well as &quot;Falling in Love (Uh-Oh)&quot; (U.S. No. 25). &quot;Words Get in the Way&quot; reached No. 1 on the US Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, establishing that the group could perform pop ballads as successfully as dance tunes. The song &quot;Hot Summer Nights&quot; was also released that year and was part of the film &quot;Top Gun&quot;.

Their next album, &quot;Let It Loose&quot; (1987), went multi-platinum, with three million copies sold in the US alone. It featured the hits: &quot;Anything for You&quot; (No. 1 Hot 100), &quot;1-2-3&quot; (No. 3 Hot 100), &quot;Betcha Say That&quot; (No. 36 Hot 100), &quot;Rhythm Is Gonna Get You&quot; (No. 5 Hot 100), and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stay Away from You&quot; (No. 6 Hot 100). &quot;Can&#x27;t Stay Away From You&quot;, &quot;Anything for You&quot;, and &quot;1-2-3&quot; were all No. 1 Adult Contemporary hits as well. In that same year, Estefan took top billing and the band&#x27;s name changed to Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine. In 1988, after the worldwide chart success of single &quot;Anything for You&quot;, the &quot;Let It Loose&quot; album was repackaged as &quot;Anything for You&quot;.

=== 1989–1992: &quot;Cuts Both Ways&quot; and &quot;Into the Light&quot; ===

In 1989, the group&#x27;s name was dropped, and Estefan has been credited as a solo artist ever since. In late 1989, Estefan released her best-selling album to date, &quot;Cuts Both Ways&quot;. The album included the hit singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Lose You&quot; (Hot 100 No. 1 hit), &quot;Oye Mi Canto&quot;, &quot;Here We Are&quot;, &quot;Cuts Both Ways&quot; (No. 1 on the U.S. Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart), and &quot;Get on Your Feet&quot;.

On March 20, 1990, while touring in support of &quot;Cuts Both Ways&quot;, Estefan was critically injured, suffering a fractured spine when a semi-truck crashed into the tour bus she was in during a snowstorm near Scranton, Pennsylvania. Estefan was returning from a meeting with President George Bush to discuss participation in an anti-drug campaign. She was taken to Community Medical Center&#x27;s Intensive Care Unit in Scranton and flown by helicopter the following day to the Hospital for Joint Diseases at NYU Langone Health in New York City, where she underwent surgery that included implanting two titanium rods to stabilize her vertebral column. Her rehabilitation included almost a year of intensive physical therapy, and she said &quot;there were times when the pain was so bad I prayed I&#x27;d pass out.&quot; However, she ultimately recovered completely.

In January 1991, Estefan released the concept album &quot;Into the Light&quot;. That same month, she performed &quot;Coming Out of the Dark&quot; for the first time at the American Music Awards to a standing ovation, the performance coming ten months after the crash. &quot;Coming Out of the Dark&quot; reached No. 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Other notable singles from &quot;Into the Light&quot; were &quot;Seal Our Fate&quot; and &quot;Live for Loving You&quot;. The album peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart and at No. 2 on the British albums chart. The album eventually went double platinum in the US and platinum in the UK.

On January 26, 1992, Estefan performed in the Super Bowl XXVI halftime show. Estefan released &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; in 1992, and the album included the U.S. hit ballads &quot;Always Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;I See Your Smile&quot; along with the international hit dance track &quot;Go Away&quot;. That same year, Estefan sang backup vocals on fellow Cuban-American singer-songwriter Jon Secada&#x27;s breakthrough single &quot;Just Another Day&quot; and received songwriting credit for the Spanish-language version &quot;Otro Día Más Sin Verte&quot;.

=== 1993–1995: &quot;Mi Tierra&quot;, &quot;Christmas Through Your Eyes,&quot; cover album, and &quot;Abriendo Puertas&quot; ===
In June 1993, Estefan released her first Spanish-language album &quot;Mi Tierra&quot;. &quot;Mi Tierra&quot; peaked at No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart and No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart. In the US, the singles &quot;Mi Tierra&quot;, the romantic-tropical ballad &quot;Con Los Años Que Me Quedan&quot;, and &quot;Mi Buen Amor&quot; all reached No. 1 on the &quot;Hot Latin Tracks&quot; chart. The album sold over eight million copies worldwide, going on to become multi-platinum in Spain (10 times) and in the US (16 times; Platinum – Latin field), and earning the Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album.

In September 1993, Estefan released her first Christmas album, &quot;Christmas Through Your Eyes&quot;. It was also notable as being the first album from Estefan that was not produced by her husband. The album included the singles &quot;This Christmas&quot; and &quot;Silent Night&quot;, and went Platinum in the US.

Estefan released &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me&quot; in October 1994, a cover album featuring some of her favorite songs from the 1960s and 1970s. The album included her remake of the disco hit &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;.

In 1995, Estefan released her second Spanish-language album, &quot;Abriendo Puertas.&quot; The album earned Estefan her second Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album. It spawned two No. 1 dance hits (&quot;Abriendo Puertas&quot; and &quot;Tres Deseos&quot;) and two No. 1 Latin singles (&quot;Abriendo Puertas&quot; and &quot;Más Allá&quot;).

<doc id="169250" wikidata="Q6556349" url="?curid=169250" title="Lipid-anchored protein">
<text>Lipid-anchored proteins (also known as lipid-linked proteins) are proteins located on the surface of the cell membrane that are covalently attached to lipids embedded within the cell membrane. These proteins insert and assume a place in the bilayer structure of the membrane alongside the similar fatty acid tails. The lipid-anchored protein can be located on either side of the cell membrane. Thus, the lipid serves to anchor the protein to the cell membrane. They are a type of proteolipids.

The lipid groups play a role in protein interaction and can contribute to the function of the protein to which it is attached. Furthermore, the lipid serves as a mediator of membrane associations or as a determinant for specific protein-protein interactions. For example, lipid groups can play an important role in increasing molecular hydrophobicity. This allows for the interaction of proteins with cellular membranes and protein domains. In a dynamic role, lipidation can sequester a protein away from its substrate to inactivate the protein and then activate it by substrate presentation.

Overall, there are three main types of lipid-anchored proteins which include prenylated proteins, fatty acylated proteins and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins (GPI). A protein can have multiple lipid groups covalently attached to it, but the site where the lipids bind to the protein depends both on the lipid group and protein.

== Prenylated proteins ==

Prenylated proteins are proteins with covalently attached hydrophobic isoprene polymers (i.e. branched five-carbon hydrocarbon) at cysteine residues of the protein. More specifically, these isoprenoid groups, usually farnesyl (15-carbon) and geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) are attached to the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the C terminal of the protein. This prenylation of lipid chains to proteins facilitate their interaction with the cell membrane.

The prenylation motif “CaaX box” is the most common prenylation site in proteins, that is, the site where farnesyl or geranylgeranyl covalently attach. In the CaaX box sequence, the C represents the cysteine that is prenylated, the A represents any aliphatic amino acid and the X determines the type of prenylation that will occur. If the X is an Ala, Met, Ser or Gln the protein will be farnesylated via the farnesyltransferase enzyme and if the X is a Leu then the protein will be geranylgeranylated via the geranylgeranyltransferase I enzyme. Both of these enzymes are similar with each containing two subunits.

=== Roles and function ===

Prenylated proteins are particularly important for eukaryotic cell growth, differentiation and morphology. Furthermore, protein prenylation is a reversible post-translational modification to the cell membrane. This dynamic interaction of prenylated proteins with the cell membrane is important for their signalling functions and is often deregulated in disease processes such as cancer. More specifically, Ras is the protein that undergoes prenylation via farnesyltransferase and when it is switched on it can turn on genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. Thus overactiving Ras signalling can lead to cancer. An understanding of these prenylated proteins and their mechanisms have been important for the drug development efforts in combating cancer. Other prenylated proteins include members of the Rab and Rho families as well as lamins.

Some important prenylation chains that are involved in the HMG-CoA reductase metabolic pathway are geranylgeraniol, farnesol and dolichol. These isoprene polymers (e.g. geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate) are involved in the condensations via enzymes such as prenyltransferase that eventually cyclizes to form cholesterol.

== Fatty acylated proteins ==

Fatty acylated proteins are proteins that have been post-translationally modified to include the covalent attachment of fatty acids at certain amino acid residues. The most common fatty acids that are covalently attached to the protein are the saturated myristic (14-carbon) acid and palmitic acid (16-carbon). Proteins can be modified to contain either one or both of these fatty acids.

=== &quot;N-&quot;myristoylation ===
&quot;N&quot;-myristoylation (i.e. attachment of myristic acid) is generally an irreversible protein modification that typically occurs during protein synthesis in which the myrisitc acid is attached to the α-amino group of an N-terminal glycine residue through an amide linkage. This reaction is facilitated by &quot;N&quot;-myristoyltransferase . These proteins usually begin with a - sequence and with either a serine or threonine at position 5. Proteins that have been myristoylated are involved in signal transduction cascade, protein-protein interactions and in mechanisms that regulate protein targeting and function. An example in which the myristoylation of a protein is important is in apoptosis, programmed cell death. After the protein BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (Bid) has been myristoylated, it targets the protein to move to the mitochondrial membrane to release cytochrome c, which then ultimately leads to cell death. Other proteins that are myristoylated and involved in the regulation of apoptosis are actin and gelsolin.

=== &quot;S&quot;-palmitoylation ===

S-palmitoylation (i.e. attachment of palmitic acid) is a reversible protein modification in which a palmitic acid is attached to a specific cysteine residue via thioester linkage. The term S-acylation can also be used when other medium and long fatty acids chains are also attached to palmitoylated proteins. No consensus sequence for protein palmitoylation has been identified. Palmitoylated proteins are mainly found on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane where they play a role in transmembrane signaling. The palmitoyl group can be removed by palmitoyl thioesterases. It is believed that this reverse palmitoylation may regulate the interaction of the protein with the membrane and thus have a role in signaling processes. Furthermore, this allows for the regulation of protein subcellular localization, stability and trafficking. An example in which palmitoylation of a protein plays a role in cell signaling pathways is in the clustering of proteins in the synapse. When the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) is palmitoylated, it is restricted to the membrane and allows it to bind to and cluster ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane. Thus, palmitoylation can play a role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.

Palmitoylation mediates the affinity of a protein for lipid rafts and facilitates the clustering of proteins. The clustering can increase the proximity of two molecules. Alternatively, clustering can sequester a protein away from a substrate. For example, palmitoylation of phospholipase D (PLD) sequesters the enzyme away from its substrate phosphatidylcholine. When cholesterol levels decrease or PIP2 levels increase the palmitate mediated localization is disrupted, the enzyme trafficks to PIP2 where it encounters its substrate and is active by substrate presentation.

== GPI proteins ==

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-anchored proteins) are attached to a GPI complex molecular group via an amide linkage to the protein&#x27;s C-terminal carboxyl group. This GPI complex consists of several main components that are all interconnected: a phosphoethanolamine, a linear tetrasaccharide (composed of three mannose and a glucosaminyl) and a phosphatidylinositol. The phosphatidylinositol group is glycosidically linked to the non-N-acetylated glucosamine of the tetrasaccharide. A phosphodiester bond is then formed between the mannose at the nonreducing end (of the tetrasaccaride) and the phosphoethanolamine. The phosphoethanolamine is then amide linked to the C-terminal of the carboxyl group of the respective protein. The GPI attachment occurs through the action of GPI-transamidase complex. The fatty acid chains of the phosphatidylinositol are inserted into the membrane and thus are what anchor the protein to the membrane. These proteins are only located on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane.

=== Roles and function ===
The sugar residues in the tetrasaccaride and the fatty acid residues in the phosphatidylinositol group vary depending on the protein. This great diversity is what allows the GPI proteins to have a wide range of functions including acting as hydrolytic enzymes, adhesion molecule, receptors, protease inhibitor and complement regulatory proteins. Furthermore, GPI proteins play an important in embryogenesis, development, neurogenesis, the immune system and fertilization. More specifically, the GPI protein IZUMO1R (also named JUNO after the Roman goddess of fertility) on the egg plasma has an essential role in sperm-egg fusion. Releasing the IZUMO1R (JUNO) GPI protein from the egg plasma membrane does not allow for sperm to fuse with the egg and it is suggested that this mechanism may contribute to the polyspermy block at the plasma membrane in eggs. Other roles that GPI modification allows for is in the association with membrane microdomains, transient homodimerization or in apical sorting in polarized cells.

<doc id="169252" wikidata="Q2566254" url="?curid=169252" title="La Ley (band)">
<text>; ) were a Chilean rock band formed by Andrés Bobe, Rodrigo Aboitiz, Luciano Rojas and Mauricio Claveria with Beto Cuevas. The band has won one Grammy Award, two Latin Grammy Awards, three Lo Nuestro Awards and three Premios MTV Latinoamérica.

La Ley has released eight studio albums, sixteen compilation albums, two EPs, thirty-one music videos, four video albums, one live album, one double format album, one soundtrack and thirty single albums.

== History ==
After an unsuccessful first album, &quot;Desiertos&quot; (1990), they released &quot;Doble Opuesto&quot; (1991), which appears as the official first album of the band. Singles like &quot;Desiertos,&quot; &quot;Tejedores de Ilusión,&quot; and &quot;Prisioneros de la Piel&quot; made them stars in Chile, Argentina and Mexico, especially after the release of &quot;La Ley&quot;, their second recording (1993). After Bobe&#x27;s death in 1994, La Ley continued with a new guitarist, Pedro Frugone, and released two more albums; in 1995, the band released &quot;Invisible&quot;, the album was their international breakout record and provided to the band their best-selling studio album to date, it included the number ones &quot;Dia Cero&quot; and &quot;El Duelo&quot;.

Before the release of &quot;Vértigo&quot;, Rodrigo Aboitiz left the band. In the middle of the tour, bassist Luciano Rojas left the band as well, and together with the Aboitiz formed a new group named Saiko.

Their music became more rock and less experimental, and the musicians dropped their dark image. Not all of their fans were on board with the new style, but the last La Ley albums, &quot;Uno&quot; (2000) and &quot;Libertad&quot; (2003), consolidated the band as one of the most important in Latin America, earning it a Latin Grammy award for each of the two albums.

La Ley also performed on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; in 2001, and released an album of the performance, which went on to win a Grammy award. In 2004, they released a greatest hits compilation (featuring three new songs: Mírate, Bienvenido al Anochecer, and Histeria) titled &quot;Historias e Histeria.&quot;

In 2005 Rodrigo Aboitiz and Luciano Rojas performed with the band at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival (Spanish: Festival Internacional de la Canción de Viña del Mar) and after a tour around Latin America, the band dissolved in Buenos Aires on September 29, to work on their personal projects, leaving open the possibility for a return in the future. Most of the original members have since formed a group known as Dia Cero with Chilean singer Ignacio Redard.

On February 22, 2023, the official lineup for the Besame Mucho Festival was published, which took place on December 2, 2023, at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California. This caused a stir among the fans of the band because the name of La Ley appeared along with other emblematic artists of Latin music with great experience. Speculations continued for a week about whether it was really a meeting between the members of La Ley after 7 years, or possibly a new composition of the band led by Cuevas.

On March 1, exactly one week after announcing the Besame Mucho Festival lineup, an official statement was published by Beto Cuevas and Mauricio Clavería on their respective Instagram accounts, confirming the band&#x27;s reunion with their latest formation. official of Cuevas, Clavería and Frugone. In the same statement, it is mentioned that it is a one-time reunion for the only occasion for the mentioned festival, so no plans to work together in the future have been contemplated.

<doc id="169258" wikidata="Q574375" url="?curid=169258" title="Mecano">
<text>Mecano was a Spanish pop band formed in 1981 and active until 1992. Mecano became one of the most successful Spanish pop bands of all time. The band is still the best-selling Spanish band, with over 20 million records worldwide. They were considered by some to be avant-garde for their time and part of la Movida Madrileña countercultural movement. They had a brief comeback in 1998.

The band&#x27;s line-up consisted of singer Ana Torroja and brothers Nacho and José María Cano, who worked alongside session musicians such as Arturo Terriza, Manolo Aguilar, Nacho Mañó, Javier Quílez, Ángel Celada and Óscar Astruga. The trio&#x27;s musical career spanned two distinct stages. The first, up to 1985, was essentially as a synthpop band, while in the second stage Mecano followed a more acoustic pop rock direction, with elements of ballad, dance, flamenco, bossa nova, tango, salsa, rumba flamenca, bolero, pasodoble, and even reggae.

The unprecedented success also hit Hispanic America. Also, thanks to adaptations to other languages of several of their songs, they influenced non-Spanish speaking countries such as Italy and France, as with their song &quot;Une femme avec une femme&quot;. In 2005, Mecano&#x27;s music was adapted into the successful musical &quot;Hoy no me puedo levantar&quot;, which opened productions in Spain and Mexico. After two years, it was announced that the musical had been seen by more than 1,500,000 spectators in both countries, making it the most successful original production in Spanish of all time.

Some of their biggest number one singles include &quot;Me cuesta tanto olvidarte&quot;, &quot;La fuerza del destino&quot;, &quot;Hijo de la luna&quot;, &quot;Cruz de navajas&quot;, &quot;Une femme avec une femme&quot; (&quot;Mujer contra mujer&quot;, a worldwide number one hit), and &quot;El 7 de septiembre&quot;.

==History==
The band started as a synthpop ensemble (&quot;tecno pop&quot; in Spanish) by brothers Nacho and José María Cano, along with singer Ana Torroja, in 1981 in Madrid influenced by English new wave band Spandau Ballet. In a period of cultural experimentation in the newly democratic Spain, Mecano achieved its initial popularity with its debut single, &quot;Hoy no me puedo levantar&quot; (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Up Today&quot;), a song about youth boredom and hangovers. Their first, self-titled album became a collection of classics that would later represent Spanish 1980s pop music.

At the same time, Nacho Cano branched out into producing other bands, and both brothers started writing songs for other pop up-and-comers. Although those secondary acts wouldn&#x27;t achieve the level of success Mecano gained, they turned out to be new testing grounds for Mecano.

After switching recording labels, passing from then CBS-Columbia (later Sony Music) to the Ariola label (later acquired by BMG music group) and having achieved another huge hit in 1986 with &quot;Me cuesta tanto olvidarte&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s So Hard to Forget You&quot;), the band reformed its musical approach with the album &quot;Entre el cielo y el suelo&quot; (&quot;Between the Sky and the Ground&quot;). Their new style emphasised pop over techno. It also facilitated the export of their music to Latin America. This new versatility was evidenced by &quot;Hijo de la Luna&quot; (&quot;Son of the Moon&quot;). This song was also submitted by the band as a potential contestant for Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1986, but TVE selected another band, Cadillac.

Their follow-up album, &quot;Descanso Dominical&quot; (&quot;Sunday Rest&quot;), produced two of their most popular singles. One was, &quot;La fuerza del destino,&quot; (&quot;The force of fate&quot;) in which actress Penélope Cruz debuted in the video clip for it. She later had a relationship with Nacho Cano for several years. The other single &quot;Mujer contra mujer&quot; (&quot;Woman against woman&quot;), is about a lesbian relationship, seen through the eyes of a friend, who only later realises what is going on. It was recorded in French (&quot;Une femme avec une femme&quot;), English and Italian, giving Mecano their first global hit. The single which was released in Latin America in 1989, became a number one hit, it also remained seven consecutive weeks on the French number one position from 10 November to 22 December 1990; the song became one of the greatest hits of all time in that country.

&quot;Aidalai&quot; (nonsense word meaning, &quot;Oh Dalai&quot;), their following album, was published in 1991 and was as successful as their previous two works.

&quot;El 7 de septiembre&quot; (&quot;7 September&quot;) was dedicated to Coloma Fernández Armero, who was Nacho Cano&#x27;s girlfriend for several years. &quot;El 7 de septiembre&quot;, which was released in the summer of 1992, was the last Ibero-American number one hit for the band, a music video was released for the song and it was inspired by the 1927 German silent film &quot;Metropolis&quot;. It was the last original album of the band.

In 1993, the band announced a temporary hiatus.

In 1998, the band released the album &quot;Ana, Jose, Nacho&quot;, which mixed new songs with greatest hits. The band separated later that year and all three members went on to have solo careers, though only Ana found success as a singer. In 2005 keyboardist Nacho Cano wrote a musical based on 32 Mecano songs, named after their first single.

In 2005, the members of Mecano released a double-CD/DVD package commemorating the 25th anniversary of the creation of the band. The new CD/DVD, &quot;Mecanografia&quot; (Mecano-graphy), includes a compilation of all their singles, never-before released songs, and a DVD with videos and early concert appearances.

The Cano brothers were innovative musicians in the use of technology, and Nacho was one of the first Spanish musicians to own a Fairlight keyboard. (Its screen can be seen in the back cover of their only live album). José María also commented that he often locked himself in a room with a dictionary and books to write his songs, while Nacho has said that to compose he started off with a rhythm machine, then added the melody, and the lyrics came in last.

In November 2009, the band reunited with a new song to be released later that month.

On 25 November 2011, the journalist José Antonio Abellán announced their reunion in ABC Punto Radio for a world tour in 2012. This was later denied. Other media such as the newspaper El País, confirmed the news and the world tour.

Songs from &quot;Entre el cielo y el suelo&quot; have been covered by Montserrat Caballé and Celia Cruz. Also, the unpublished song &quot;Lía&quot; was sung by Ana Belén. The Eurodance band Loona covered the song &quot;Hijo de la luna&quot; in 1998 and achieved a major hit with it. Laura Branigan recorded a version of &quot;Mujer Contra Mujer&quot; on her 1993 album &quot;Over My Heart&quot;. In 2008, Mexican singer Daniela Romo included the song in her album, &quot;Sueños de Cabaret.&quot; &quot;Cruz de Navajas&quot; was covered in a salsa style by Dominican singer Raulin Rosendo.

In 2004, Mexican pop singer Fey recorded the album &quot;La Fuerza Del Destino&quot;, an album consisting of 12 Mecano covers. This album was nominated for the Latin Grammy Awards in 2005. Costa Rican Latin grammy winners, Editus covered the song &quot;Hijo De La Luna&quot; in their album &quot;Siempre...&quot;.

Non-Spanish covers include Sarah Brightman, who sang the songs &quot;Tú&quot;, &quot;Hijo de la luna&quot;, &quot;Naturaleza Muerta&quot;. Mario Frangoulis covered &quot;Hijo de la luna&quot; and &quot;Naturaleza Muerta.&quot; The Belgian-Spanish Belle Perez did the same. Greek singer Eleni Dimou covered &quot;Hijo de la luna&quot; translating it in Greek (&quot;Πέφτει το φεγγάρι&quot; - &quot;Moon is falling&quot;).

The Spanish heavy metal band Stravaganzza covered the song &quot;Hijo de la luna&quot; in their most recent studio work: an EP called &quot;Hijo del Miedo&quot; (Son of Fear).

Recently the crossover soprano Geraldine Larrosa covered a French/Spanish version of &quot;Naturaleza Muerta&quot;.

A Portuguese-language cover of &quot;Hawaii–Bombay&quot; was performed by Brazilian new wave band Metrô on their 1985 album &quot;Olhar&quot;. Portuguese singer José Cid also sung a version of his own.

In their 2008 album, &quot;Tales of Ithiria&quot;, the German symphonic metal band Haggard made a cover for &quot;Hijo de la Luna&quot;.

A Finnish pop-folk artist Tuula Amberla released a cover in Finnish of &quot;Hijo de la Luna&quot; called &quot;Kuun poika&quot; in 1992, later a symphonic metal band Katra made the same cover in their 2008 album &quot;Beast Within&quot;.

In 2009, the Mexican singer Gloria Trevi sang a live cover of the song &quot;&quot;Hijo de la Luna&quot; on the Mexican television show, &quot;El Show de los Sueños&quot;. Also that same year the Brazilian-Venezuelan singer, Elisa Rego, did an electronic version of &quot;Aire&quot; song (Air) included in her fifth studio album titled &quot;Temperamental&quot;. It is noteworthy that also in her beginnings (1982) Rego was the lead singer of ES-3, an underground rock band who specialized in performing Mecano covers in Caracas city night clubs long before this Spanish trio visited Venezuela for the first time in 1984 during the Promotional Tour of the &quot;Ya Viene El Sol&quot;-album (The Sun is Coming). Then their second visit to Venezuela was in 1986 in the promotional tour of &quot;Entre el cielo y el suelo&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="169262" wikidata="Q176786" url="?curid=169262" title="Intuitionistic logic">
<text>Intuitionistic logic, sometimes more generally called constructive logic, refers to systems of symbolic logic that differ from the systems used for classical logic by more closely mirroring the notion of constructive proof. In particular, systems of intuitionistic logic do not assume the law of excluded middle and double negation elimination, which are fundamental inference rules in classical logic.

Formalized intuitionistic logic was originally developed by Arend Heyting to provide a formal basis for L. E. J. Brouwer&#x27;s programme of intuitionism. From a proof-theoretic perspective, Heyting’s calculus is a restriction of classical logic in which the law of excluded middle and double negation elimination have been removed. Excluded middle and double negation elimination can still be proved for some propositions on a case by case basis, however, but do not hold universally as they do with classical logic. The standard explanation of intuitionistic logic is the BHK interpretation.

Several systems of semantics for intuitionistic logic have been studied. One of these semantics mirrors classical Boolean-valued semantics but uses Heyting algebras in place of Boolean algebras. Another semantics uses Kripke models. These, however, are technical means for studying Heyting’s deductive system rather than formalizations of Brouwer’s original informal semantic intuitions. Semantical systems claiming to capture such intuitions, due to offering meaningful concepts of “constructive truth” (rather than merely validity or provability), are Kurt Gödel’s dialectica interpretation, Stephen Cole Kleene’s realizability, Yurii Medvedev’s logic of finite problems, or Giorgi Japaridze’s computability logic. Yet such semantics persistently induce logics properly stronger than Heyting’s logic. Some authors have argued that this might be an indication of inadequacy of Heyting’s calculus itself, deeming the latter incomplete as a constructive logic.

== Mathematical constructivism ==
In the semantics of classical logic, propositional formulae are assigned truth values from the two-element set formula_1 (&quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; respectively), regardless of whether we have direct evidence for either case. This is referred to as the &#x27;law of excluded middle&#x27;, because it excludes the possibility of any truth value besides &#x27;true&#x27; or &#x27;false&#x27;. In contrast, propositional formulae in intuitionistic logic are &quot;not&quot; assigned a definite truth value and are &quot;only&quot; considered &quot;true&quot; when we have direct evidence, hence &quot;proof&quot;. We can also say, instead of the propositional formula being &quot;true&quot; due to direct evidence, that it is inhabited by a proof in the Curry–Howard sense. Operations in intuitionistic logic therefore preserve justification, with respect to evidence and provability, rather than truth-valuation.

Intuitionistic logic is a commonly-used tool in developing approaches to constructivism in mathematics. The use of constructivist logics in general has been a controversial topic among mathematicians and philosophers (see, for example, the Brouwer–Hilbert controversy). A common objection to their use is the above-cited lack of two central rules of classical logic, the law of excluded middle and double negation elimination. David Hilbert considered them to be so important to the practice of mathematics that he wrote:

Intuitionistic logic has found practical use in mathematics despite the challenges presented by the inability to utilize these rules. One reason for this is that its restrictions produce proofs that have the disjunction and existence properties, making it also suitable for other forms of mathematical constructivism. Informally, this means that if there is a constructive proof that an object exists, that constructive proof may be used as an algorithm for generating an example of that object, a principle known as the Curry–Howard correspondence between proofs and algorithms. One reason that this particular aspect of intuitionistic logic is so valuable is that it enables practitioners to utilize a wide range of computerized tools, known as proof assistants. These tools assist their users in the generation and verification of large-scale proofs, whose size usually precludes the usual human-based checking that goes into publishing and reviewing a mathematical proof. As such, the use of proof assistants (such as Agda or Coq) is enabling modern mathematicians and logicians to develop and prove extremely complex systems, beyond those that are feasible to create and check solely by hand. One example of a proof that was impossible to satisfactorily verify without formal verification is the famous proof of the four color theorem. This theorem stumped mathematicians for more than a hundred years, until a proof was developed that ruled out large classes of possible counterexamples, yet still left open enough possibilities that a computer program was needed to finish the proof. That proof was controversial for some time, but, later, it was verified using Coq.

==Syntax==

The syntax of formulas of intuitionistic logic is similar to propositional logic or first-order logic. However, intuitionistic connectives are not definable in terms of each other in the same way as in classical logic, hence their choice matters. In intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL) it is customary to use →, ∧, ∨, ⊥ as the basic connectives, treating ¬&quot;A&quot; as an abbreviation for . In intuitionistic first-order logic both quantifiers ∃, ∀ are needed.

=== Hilbert-style calculus ===
Intuitionistic logic can be defined using the following Hilbert-style calculus. This is similar to a way of axiomatizing classical propositional logic.

In propositional logic, the inference rule is modus ponens
* MP: from formula_2 and formula_3 infer formula_4
and the axioms are
* THEN-1: formula_5
* THEN-2: formula_6
* AND-1: formula_7
* AND-2: formula_8
* AND-3: formula_9
* OR-1: formula_10
* OR-2: formula_11
* OR-3: formula_12
* FALSE: formula_13
To make this a system of first-order predicate logic, the generalization rules
* formula_14-GEN: from formula_15 infer formula_16, if formula_17 is not free in formula_18
* formula_19-GEN: from formula_20 infer formula_21, if formula_17 is not free in formula_18
are added, along with the axioms
* PRED-1: formula_24, if the term formula_25 is free for substitution for the variable formula_17 in formula_3 (i.e., if no occurrence of any variable in formula_25 becomes bound in formula_29)
* PRED-2: formula_30, with the same restriction as for PRED-1

==== Negation ====
If one wishes to include a connective formula_31 for negation rather than consider it an abbreviation for formula_32, it is enough to add:
* NOT-1&#x27;: formula_33
* NOT-2&#x27;: formula_34

There are a number of alternatives available if one wishes to omit the connective formula_35 (false). For example, one may replace the three axioms FALSE, NOT-1&#x27;, and NOT-2&#x27; with the two axioms
* NOT-1: formula_36
* NOT-2: formula_37
as at . Alternatives to NOT-1 are formula_38 or formula_39.

==== Equivalence ====
The connective formula_40 for equivalence may be treated as an abbreviation, with formula_41 standing for formula_42. Alternatively, one may add the axioms

* IFF-1: formula_43
* IFF-2: formula_44
* IFF-3: formula_45

IFF-1 and IFF-2 can, if desired, be combined into a single axiom formula_46 using conjunction.

===Sequent calculus===

Gerhard Gentzen discovered that a simple restriction of his system LK (his sequent calculus for classical logic) results in a system that is sound and complete with respect to intuitionistic logic. He called this system LJ. In LK any number of formulas is allowed to appear on the conclusion side of a sequent; in contrast LJ allows at most one formula in this position.

Other derivatives of LK are limited to intuitionistic derivations but still allow multiple conclusions in a sequent. LJ&#x27; is one example.

==Theorems==
The theorems of the pure logic are the statements provable from the axioms and inference rules. For example, using THEN-1 in THEN-2 reduces it to formula_47. A formal proof of the latter using the Hilbert system is given on that page. With formula_48 for formula_4, this in turn implies formula_50. In words: &quot;If formula_51 being the case implies that formula_3 is absurd, then if formula_3 does hold, one has that formula_51 is not the case.&quot; Due to the symmetry of the statement, one in fact obtained
:formula_55
When explaining the theorems of intuitionistic logic in terms of classical logic, it can be understood as a weakening thereof: It is more conservative in what it allows a reasoner to infer, while not permitting any new inferences that could not be made under classical logic. Each theorem of intuitionistic logic is a theorem in classical logic, but not conversely. Many tautologies in classical logic are not theorems in intuitionistic logicin particular, as said above, one of intuitionistic logic&#x27;s chief aims is to not affirm the law of the excluded middle so as to vitiate the use of non-constructive proof by contradiction, which can be used to furnish existence claims without providing explicit examples of the objects that it proves exist. 

===Double negations===
A double negation does not affirm the law of the excluded middle (PEM); while it is not necessarily the case that PEM is upheld in any context, no counterexample can be given either. Such a counterexample would be an inference (inferring the negation of the law for a certain proposition) disallowed under classical logic and thus PEM is not allowed in a strict weakening like intuitionistic logic. Formally, it is a simple theorem that formula_56 for any two propositions. By considering any formula_57 established to be false this indeed shows that the double negation of the law formula_58 is retained as a tautology already in minimal logic. This means any formula_59 is established to be inconsistent and the propositional calculus is in turn always compatible with classical logic.

When assuming the law of excluded middle implies a proposition, then by applying contraposition twice and using the double-negated excluded middle, one may prove double-negated variants of various strictly classical tautologies. The situation is more intricate for predicate logic formulas, when some quantified expressions are being negated.

==== Double negation and implication====
Akin to the above, from modus ponens in the form formula_60 follows formula_61. The relation between them may always be used to obtain new formulas: A weakened premise makes for a strong implication, and vice versa. For example, note that if formula_62 holds, then so does formula_63, but the schema in the other direction would imply the double-negation elimination principle. Propositions for which double-negation elimination is possible are also called stable. Intuitionistic logic proves stability only for restricted types of propositions. A formula for which excluded middle holds can be proven stable using the disjunctive syllogism, which is discussed more thoroughly below. The converse does however not hold in general, unless the excluded middle statement at hand is stable itself.

An implication formula_64 can be proven to be equivalent to formula_65, whatever the propositions. As a special case, it follows that propositions of negated form (formula_66 here) are stable, i.e. formula_67 is always valid.

In general, formula_68 is stronger than formula_63, which is stronger than formula_70, which itself implies the three equivalent statements formula_71, formula_72 and formula_73 . Using the disjunctive syllogism, the previous four are indeed equivalent. This also gives an intuitionistically valid derivation of formula_74, as it is thus equivalent to an identity.

When formula_4 expresses a claim, then its double-negation formula_76 merely expresses the claim that a refutation of formula_4 would be inconsistent. Having proven such a mere double-negation also still aids in negating other statements through negation introduction, as then formula_78. A double-negated existential statement does not denote existence of an entity with a property, but rather the absurdity of assumed non-existence of any such entity. Also all the principles in the next section involving quantifiers explain use of implications with hypothetical existence as premise.

====Formula translation====
Weakening statements by adding two negations before existential quantifiers (and atoms) is also the core step in the double-negation translation. It constitutes an embedding of classical first-order logic into intuitionistic logic: a first-order formula is provable in classical logic if and only if its Gödel–Gentzen translation is provable intuitionistically. For example, any theorem of classical propositional logic of the form formula_79 has a proof consisting of an intuitionistic proof of formula_80 followed by one application of double-negation elimination. Intuitionistic logic can thus be seen as a means of extending classical logic with constructive semantics.

===Non-interdefinability of operators===
Already minimal logic easily proves the following theorems, relating conjunction resp. disjunction to the implication using negation. Firstly,
* formula_81
In words: &quot;formula_3 and formula_4 each imply that it is not the case that both formula_3 and formula_4 fail to hold together.&quot;

And here the logically negative conclusion formula_86 is in fact equivalent to formula_87. The alternative implied theorem, formula_88, represents a weakened variant of the disjunctive syllogism.
Secondly,
* formula_89
In words: &quot;formula_3 and formula_4 both together imply that neither formula_3 nor formula_4 fail to hold.&quot;

And here the logically negative conclusion formula_94 is in fact equivalent to formula_95. A variant of the converse of the implied theorem here does also hold, namely
* formula_96
In words: &quot;formula_3 implying formula_4 implies that it is not the case that formula_3 holds while formula_4 fails to hold.&quot;

And indeed, stronger variants of all of these still do hold - for example the antecedents may be double-negated, as noted, or all formula_4 may be replaced by formula_76 on the antecedent sides, as will be discussed.

However, neither of these five implications above can be reversed without immediately implying excluded middle (consider formula_103 for formula_3) resp. double-negation elimination (consider true formula_3). Hence, the left hand sides do not constitute a possible definition of the right hand sides.

In contrast, in classical propositional logic it is possible to take one of those three connectives plus negation as primitive and define the other two in terms of it, in this way. Such is done, for example, in Łukasiewicz&#x27;s three axioms of propositional logic. 
It is even possible to define all in terms of a sole sufficient operator such as the Peirce arrow (NOR) or Sheffer stroke (NAND). Similarly, in classical first-order logic, one of the quantifiers can be defined in terms of the other and negation.
These are fundamentally consequences of the law of bivalence, which makes all such connectives merely Boolean functions.
The law of bivalence is not required to hold in intuitionistic logic. As a result, none of the basic connectives can be dispensed with, and the above axioms are all necessary. So most of the classical identities between connectives and quantifiers are only theorems of intuitionistic logic in one direction. Some of the theorems go in both directions, i.e. are equivalences, as subsequently discussed.

====Existential vs. universal quantification====
Firstly, when formula_17 is not free in the proposition formula_57, then
:formula_108
When the domain of discourse is empty, then by the principle of explosion, an existential statement implies anything. When the domain contains at least one term, then assuming excluded middle for formula_109, the inverse of the above implication becomes provably too, meaning the two sides become equivalent. This inverse direction is equivalent to the drinker&#x27;s paradox (DP). Moreover, an existential and dual variant of it is given by the independence of premise principle (IP). Classically, the statement above is moreover equivalent to a more disjunctive form discussed further below. Constructively, existence claims are however generally harder to come by.

If the domain of discourse is not empty and formula_3 is moreover independent of formula_17, such principles are equivalent to formulas in the propositional calculus. Here, the formula then just expresses the identity formula_112. This is the curried form of modus ponens formula_113, which in the special the case with formula_57 as a false proposition results in the law of non-contradiction principle formula_115.

Considering a false proposition formula_57 for the original implication results in the important
* formula_117
In words: &quot;If there exists an entity formula_17 that does &quot;not&quot; have the property formula_3, then the following is &quot;refuted&quot;: Each entity has the property formula_3.&quot;

The quantifier formula with negations also immediately follows from the non-contradiction principle derived above, each instance of which itself already follows from the more particular formula_121. To derive a contradiction given formula_122, it suffices to establish its negation formula_123 (as opposed to the stronger formula_3) and this makes proving double-negations valuable also. By the same token, the original quantifier formula in fact still holds with formula_125 weakened to formula_126. And so, in fact, a stronger theorem holds:
:formula_127
In words: &quot;If there exists an entity formula_17 that does &quot;not&quot; have the property formula_3, then the following is &quot;refuted&quot;: For each entity, one is &quot;not&quot; able to prove that it does &quot;not&quot; have the property formula_3&quot;.

Secondly,
:formula_131
where similar considerations apply. Here the existential part is always a hypothesis and this is an equivalence. Considering the special case again,
* formula_132
The proven conversion formula_133 can be used to obtain two further implications:
:formula_134
:formula_135
Of course, variants of such formulas can also be derived that have the double-negations in the antecedent.
A special case of the first formula here is formula_136 and this is indeed stronger than the formula_137-direction of the equivalence bullet point listed above. For simplicity of the discussion here and below, the formulas are generally presented in weakened forms without all possible insertions of double-negations in the antecedents.

More general variants hold. Incorporating the predicate formula_4 and currying, the following generalization also entails the relation between implication and conjunction in the predicate calculus, discussed below.
:formula_139
If the predicate formula_4 is decidedly false for all formula_17, then this equivalence is trivial. If formula_4 is decidedly true for all formula_17, the schema simply reduces to the previously stated equivalence. In the language of classes, formula_144 and formula_145, the special case of this equivalence with false formula_57 equates two characterizations of disjointness formula_147:
:formula_148

====Disjunction vs. conjunction====
There are finite variations of the quantifier formulas, with just two propositions:
* formula_149
* formula_150
The first principle cannot be reversed: Considering formula_103 for formula_3 would imply the weak excluded middle, i.e. the statement formula_153. But intuitionistic logic alone does not even prove formula_154. So in particular, there is no distributivity principle for negations deriving the claim formula_155 from formula_156. For an informal example of the constructive reading, consider the following: From conclusive evidence it not to be the case that &quot;both&quot; Alice and Bob showed up to their date, one cannot derive conclusive evidence, &quot;tied to either&quot; of the two persons, that this person did not show up. Negated propositions are comparably weak, in that the classically valid De Morgan&#x27;s law, granting a disjunction from a single negative hypothetical, does not automatically hold constructively. The intuitionistic propositional calculus and some of its extensions exhibit the disjunction property instead, implying one of the disjuncts of any disjunction individually would have to be derivable as well.

The converse variants of those two, and the equivalent variants with double-negated antecedents, had already been mentioned above. Implications towards the negation of a conjunction can often be proven directly from the non-contradiction principle. In this way one may also obtain the mixed form of the implications, e.g. formula_157. Concatenating the theorems, we also find
* formula_158
The reverse cannot be provable, as it would prove weak excluded middle.

In predicate logic, the constant domain principle is not valid: formula_159 does not imply the stronger formula_160. The distributive properties does however hold for any finite number of propositions. For a variant of the De Morgan law concerning two existentially closed decidable predicates, see LLPO.

====Conjunction vs. implication====
From the general equivalence also follows import-export, expressing incompatibility of two predicates using two different connectives:
* formula_161
Due to the symmetry of the conjunction connective, this again implies the already established formula_162.
The equivalence formula for the negated conjunction may be understood as a special case of currying and uncurrying. Many more considerations regarding double-negations again apply. And both non-reversible theorems relating conjunction and implication mentioned in the introduction to non-interdefinability above follow from this equivalence. One is a simply proven variant of a converse, while formula_96 holds simply because formula_2 is stronger than formula_165.

Now when using the principle in the next section, the following variant of the latter, with more negations on the left, also holds:
* formula_166
A consequence is that
* formula_167

====Disjunction vs. implication====
Already minimal logic proves excluded middle equivalent to consequentia mirabilis, an instance of Peirce&#x27;s law. 
Now akin to modus ponens, clearly formula_168 already in minimal logic, which is a theorem that does not even involve negations. In classical logic, this implication is in fact an equivalence. With taking formula_3 to be of the form formula_170, excluded middle together with explosion is seen to entail Peirce&#x27;s law.

In intuitionistic logic, one obtains variants of the stated theorem involving formula_48, as follows. Firstly, note that two different formulas for formula_172 mentioned above can be used to imply formula_173. It also followed from direct case-analysis, as do variants where the negations are moved around, such as the theorems formula_174 or formula_88, the latter being mentioned in the introduction to non-interdefinability. These are forms of the disjunctive syllogism involving negated propositions formula_176. Strengthened forms still holds in intuitionistic logic, say
* formula_177
The implication cannot generally be reversed, as that would immediately imply excluded middle. So, intuitionistically, &quot;Either formula_178 or formula_179&quot; is generally also a stronger propositional formula than &quot;If not formula_178, then formula_179&quot;, whereas in classical logic these are interchangeable.

Non-contradiction and explosion together actually also prove the stronger variant formula_182. And this shows how excluded middle for formula_4 implies double-negation elimination for it. For a fixed formula_4, this implication also cannot generally be reversed. However, as formula_185 is always constructively valid, it follows that assuming double-negation elimination for all such disjunctions implies classical logic also.

Of course the formulas established here may be combined to obtain yet more variations. For example, the disjunctive syllogism as presented generalizes to
:formula_186
If some term exists at all, the antecedent here even implies formula_187, which in turn itself also implies the conclusion here (this is again the very first formula mentioned in this section).

The bulk of the discussion in these sections applies just as well to just minimal logic. But as for the disjunctive syllogism with general formula_4, minimal logic can at most prove formula_189 where formula_190 denotes formula_191. The conclusion here can only be simplified to formula_4 using explosion.

====Equivalences====
The above lists also contain equivalences.
The equivalence involving a conjunction and a disjunction stems from formula_193 actually being stronger than formula_194. Both sides of the equivalence can be understood as conjunctions of independent implications. Above, absurdity formula_48 is used for formula_196. In functional interpretations, it corresponds to if-clause constructions.
So e.g. &quot;Not (formula_178 or formula_179)&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Not formula_178, and also not formula_179&quot;.

An equivalence itself is generally defined as, and then equivalent to, a conjunction (formula_201) of implications (formula_137), as follows:
* formula_203
With it, such connectives become in turn definable from it:
* formula_204
* formula_205
* formula_206
* formula_207

In turn, formula_208 and formula_209 are complete bases of intuitionistic connectives, for example.

====Functionally complete connectives====
As shown by Alexander V. Kuznetsov, either of the following connectives – the first one ternary, the second one quinary – is by itself functionally complete: either one can serve the role of a sole sufficient operator for intuitionistic propositional logic, thus forming an analog of the Sheffer stroke from classical propositional logic:
* formula_210
* formula_211

==Semantics==
The semantics are rather more complicated than for the classical case. A model theory can be given by Heyting algebras or, equivalently, by Kripke semantics. In 2014, a Tarski-like model theory was proved complete by Bob Constable, but with a different notion of completeness than classically.

Unproved statements in intuitionistic logic are not given a intermediate or third truth value (as is sometimes mistakenly asserted). One can prove that such statements have no third truth value, a result dating back to Glivenko in 1928. Instead they remain of unknown truth value, until they are either proved or disproved. Statements are disproved by deducing a contradiction from them.

A consequence of this point of view is that intuitionistic logic has no interpretation as a two-valued logic, nor even as a finite-valued logic, in the familiar sense. Although intuitionistic logic retains the trivial propositions formula_1 from classical logic, each &quot;proof&quot; of a propositional formula is considered a valid propositional value, thus by Heyting&#x27;s notion of propositions-as-sets, propositional formulae are (potentially non-finite) sets of their proofs.

===Heyting algebra semantics===
In classical logic, we often discuss the truth values that a formula can take. The values are usually chosen as the members of a Boolean algebra. The meet and join operations in the Boolean algebra are identified with the ∧ and ∨ logical connectives, so that the value of a formula of the form &quot;A&quot; ∧ &quot;B&quot; is the meet of the value of &quot;A&quot; and the value of &quot;B&quot; in the Boolean algebra. Then we have the useful theorem that a formula is a valid proposition of classical logic if and only if its value is 1 for every valuation—that is, for any assignment of values to its variables.

A corresponding theorem is true for intuitionistic logic, but instead of assigning each formula a value from a Boolean algebra, one uses values from a Heyting algebra, of which Boolean algebras are a special case. A formula is valid in intuitionistic logic if and only if it receives the value of the top element for any valuation on any Heyting algebra.

It can be shown that to recognize valid formulas, it is sufficient to consider a single Heyting algebra whose elements are the open subsets of the real line R. In this algebra we have:

:formula_213

where int(&quot;X&quot;) is the interior of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;X&quot;∁ its complement.

The last identity concerning &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; allows us to calculate the value of ¬&quot;A&quot;:

:formula_214

With these assignments, intuitionistically valid formulas are precisely those that are assigned the value of the entire line. For example, the formula ¬(&quot;A&quot; ∧ ¬&quot;A&quot;) is valid, because no matter what set &quot;X&quot; is chosen as the value of the formula &quot;A&quot;, the value of ¬(&quot;A&quot; ∧ ¬&quot;A&quot;) can be shown to be the entire line:

:formula_215

So the valuation of this formula is true, and indeed the formula is valid. But the law of the excluded middle, &quot;A&quot; ∨ ¬&quot;A&quot;, can be shown to be &quot;invalid&quot; by using a specific value of the set of positive real numbers for &quot;A&quot;:

:formula_216

The interpretation of any intuitionistically valid formula in the infinite Heyting algebra described above results in the top element, representing true, as the valuation of the formula, regardless of what values from the algebra are assigned to the variables of the formula. Conversely, for every invalid formula, there is an assignment of values to the variables that yields a valuation that differs from the top element. No finite Heyting algebra has the second of these two properties.

===Kripke semantics===
Building upon his work on semantics of modal logic, Saul Kripke created another semantics for intuitionistic logic, known as Kripke semantics or relational semantics.

===Tarski-like semantics===
It was discovered that Tarski-like semantics for intuitionistic logic were not possible to prove complete. However, Robert Constable has shown that a weaker notion of completeness still holds for intuitionistic logic under a Tarski-like model. In this notion of completeness we are concerned not with all of the statements that are true of every model, but with the statements that are true &quot;in the same way&quot; in every model. That is, a single proof that the model judges a formula to be true must be valid for every model. In this case, there is not only a proof of completeness, but one that is valid according to intuitionistic logic.

==Metalogic==
===Admissible rules===
In intuitionistic logic or a fixed theory using the logic, the situation can occur that an implication always hold metatheoretically, but not in the language. For example, in the pure propositional calculus, if formula_217 is provable, then so is formula_218. Another example is that formula_219 being provable always also means that so is formula_220. One says the system is closed under these implications as rules and they may be adopted.

===Theories&#x27; features===
Theories over constructive logics can exhibit the disjunction property. The pure intuitionistic propositional calculus does so as well.

In particular, it means the excluded middle disjunction for an un-rejectable statement formula_221 is provable exactly when formula_221 is provable.
This also means, for examples, that the excluded middle disjunction for some the excluded middle disjunctions are not provable also.

===Relation to other logics===
==== Paraconsistent logic ====
Intuitionistic logic is related by duality to a paraconsistent logic known as &quot;Brazilian&quot;, &quot;anti-intuitionistic&quot; or &quot;dual-intuitionistic logic&quot;.

The subsystem of intuitionistic logic with the FALSE (resp. NOT-2) axiom removed is known as minimal logic and some differences have been elaborated on above.

==== Intermediate logics ====
In 1932, Kurt Gödel defined a system of logics intermediate between classical and intuitionistic logic. Indeed, any finite Heyting algebra that is not equivalent to a Boolean algebra defines (semantically) an intermediate logic. On the other hand, validity of formulae in pure intuitionistic logic is not tied to any individual Heyting algebra but relates to any and all Heyting algebras at the same time.

So for example, for a schema not involving negations, consider the classically valid formula_223. Adopting this over intuitionistic logic gives the intermediate logic called Gödel-Dummett logic.

==== Relation to classical logic ====
The system of classical logic is obtained by adding any one of the following axioms:
* formula_224 (Law of the excluded middle)
* formula_225 (Double negation elimination)
* formula_226 (Consequentia mirabilis, see also Peirce&#x27;s law)

Various reformulations, or formulations as schemata in two variables (e.g. Peirce&#x27;s law), also exist. One notable one is the (reverse) law of contraposition
* formula_227
Such are detailed on the intermediate logics article.

In general, one may take as the extra axiom any classical tautology that is not valid in the two-element Kripke frame formula_228 (in other words, that is not included in Smetanich&#x27;s logic).

==== Many-valued logic ====
Kurt Gödel&#x27;s work involving many-valued logic showed in 1932 that intuitionistic logic is not a finite-valued logic. (See the section titled Heyting algebra semantics above for an infinite-valued logic interpretation of intuitionistic logic.)

==== Modal logic ====
Any formula of the intuitionistic propositional logic (IPC) may be translated into the language of the normal modal logic S4 as follows:

:formula_229

and it has been demonstrated that the translated formula is valid in the propositional modal logic S4 if and only if the original formula is valid in IPC. The above set of formulae are called the Gödel–McKinsey–Tarski translation.
There is also an intuitionistic version of modal logic S4 called Constructive Modal Logic CS4.

===Lambda calculus===
There is an extended Curry–Howard isomorphism between IPC and simply-typed lambda calculus.

<text>A family tree, also called a genealogy or a pedigree chart, is a chart representing family relationships in a conventional tree structure. More detailed family trees, used in medicine and social work, are known as genograms.

== Representations of family history ==

Genealogical data can be represented in several formats, for example, as a pedigree or . Family trees are often presented with the oldest generations at the top of the tree and the younger generations at the bottom. An ancestry chart, which is a tree showing the ancestors of an individual and not all members of a family, will more closely resemble a tree in shape, being wider at the top than at the bottom. In some ancestry charts, an individual appears on the left and his or her ancestors appear to the right. Conversely, a descendant chart, which depicts all the descendants of an individual, will be narrowest at the top. Beyond these formats, some family trees might include all members of a particular surname (e.g., male-line descendants). Yet another approach is to include all holders of a certain office, such as the Kings of Germany, which represents the reliance on marriage to link dynasties together.

The passage of time can also be included to illustrate ancestry and descent. A time scale is often used, expanding radially across the center, divided into decades. Children of the parent form branches around the center and their names are plotted in their birth year on the time scale. Spouses&#x27; names join children&#x27;s names and nuclear families of parents and children branch off to grandchildren, and so on. Great-grandparents are often in the center to portray four or five generations, which reflect the natural growth pattern of a tree as seen from the top but sometimes there can be great-great-grandparents or more. In a descendant tree, living relatives are common on the outer branches and contemporary cousins appear adjacent to each other. Privacy should be considered when preparing a living family tree.

The image of the tree probably originated with that of the Tree of Jesse in medieval art, used to illustrate the Genealogy of Christ in terms of a prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 11:1). Possibly the first non-biblical use, and the first to show full family relationships rather than a purely patrilineal scheme, was that involving family trees of the classical gods in Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Genealogia Deorum Gentilium&quot; (&quot;On the Genealogy of the Gods of the Gentiles&quot;), whose first version dates to 1360.

== Common formats ==
In addition to familiar representations of family history and genealogy as a tree structure, there are other notable systems used to illustrate and document ancestry and descent.

=== Ahnentafel ===

An &quot;Ahnentafel&quot; (German for &quot;ancestor table&quot;) is a genealogical numbering system for listing a person&#x27;s direct ancestors in a fixed sequence of ascent:
# Subject (or proband)
# Father
# Mother
# Paternal grandfather
# Paternal grandmother
# Maternal grandfather
# Maternal grandmother
and so on, back through the generations. Apart from the subject or proband, who can be male or female, all even-numbered persons are male, and all odd-numbered persons are female. In this scheme, the number of any person&#x27;s father is double the person&#x27;s number, and a person&#x27;s mother is double the person&#x27;s number plus one. This system can also be displayed as a tree:

=== Fan chart ===

A fan chart features a half circle chart with concentric rings: the subject is the inner circle, the second circle is divided in two (each side is one parent), the third circle is divided in four, and so forth. Fan charts depict paternal and maternal ancestors.

== Graph theory ==
While family trees are depicted as trees, family relations do not in general form a tree in the strict sense used in graph theory, since distant relatives can mate. Therefore, a person can have a common ancestor on both their mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s side. However, because a parent must be born before their child, an individual cannot be their own ancestor, and thus there are no loops. In this regard, ancestry forms a directed acyclic graph. Nevertheless, graphs depicting matrilineal descent (mother-daughter relationships) and patrilineal descent (father-son relationships) do form trees. Assuming no common ancestor, an ancestry chart is a perfect binary tree, as each person has exactly one mother and one father; these thus have a regular structure. A Descendant chart, on the other hand, does not, in general, have a regular structure, as a person can have any number of children or none at all.

== Notable examples ==

Family trees have been used to document family histories across time and cultures throughout the world.

=== Africa ===
In Africa, the ruling dynasty of Ethiopia claimed descent from King Solomon via the Queen of Sheba. Through this claim, the family traced their descent back to the House of David.

The genealogy of Ancient Egyptian ruling dynasties was recorded from the beginnings of the Pharaonic era to the end of the Ptolomaic Kingdom; although this is not a record of one continuously linked family lineage, and surviving records are incomplete.

Elsewhere in Africa, oral traditions of genealogical recording predominate. Members of the Keita dynasty of Mali, for example, have had their pedigrees sung by griots during annual ceremonies since the 14th century. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, many ruling clans—most notably those descended from Oduduwa—claim descent from the legendary King Kisra. Here too, pedigrees are recited by griots attached to the royal courts.

=== The Americas ===
In some pre-contact Native American civilizations, genealogical records of ruling and priestly families were kept, some of which extended over several centuries or longer.

===Pre-Islamic Arabia===
In pre-Islamic Arabia, the Arab tribes were often organized around extended family units, and tribal identity was key to understanding one&#x27;s heritage and honor. Each tribe, or qabila, would trace its lineage back to a common ancestor. These genealogies were passed down orally, with poets, historians, and storytellers responsible for preserving these family histories.
The Arabs were well-known for their oral traditions and poetry, where family lineages were often preserved in elaborate genealogies. For example, many pre-Islamic poets like Imru&#x27; al-Qais referenced their tribal heritage and the great ancestors of their families in their poetry.

===Islamic Era and Beyond ===
With the rise of Islam in the 7th century, genealogy took on even more significance, particularly for those claiming descent from the Prophet Muhammad. Sayyids (those who trace their lineage back to the Prophet) and Hashemites (the family of the Prophet&#x27;s clan) have been highly regarded throughout history. The Prophet Muhammad’s family tree is one of the most well-known genealogical records in the Arab world. The Islamic era also formalized the recording of genealogies, with Islamic scholars beginning to document and preserve family histories in written form. This was not only important for religious reasons but also for maintaining tribal alliances, political power, and historical records.
The First Recorded Arab Genealogical Trees. The first known recorded genealogical trees for Arabs are largely from the early Islamic period, and these genealogies were meticulously recorded by historians, genealogists, and scholars.
===The Genealogy of the Prophet Muhammad===
One of the most famous early genealogical trees in the Arab world is that of Prophet Muhammad. His genealogy was carefully documented in various Islamic texts, and it traces his lineage to Ishmael, the son of Abraham. The family tree is crucial in establishing the Prophet’s noble lineage.
This line of descent is known as the Hashemite lineage, originating from Hashim, a forefather of the Prophet, and it remains one of the most revered lineages in the Arab world.
The Book of Lineages (كتاب الأنساب, Kitab al-Ansab)The early Islamic genealogist Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (1372–1449) compiled a monumental work called &quot;Kitab al-Ansab&quot;, which documents the genealogies of various Arab tribes. His work was based on earlier genealogical sources and serves as a foundational resource for understanding Arab tribal and familial lineages.
Ibn Khaldun and Genealogies: Another important historical figure, Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406), a famous historian and philosopher, included discussions on genealogy in his renowned work, Muqaddimah. In his writing, he explored the role of tribes and lineages in Arab society, and this work contributed to the study of genealogies as part of social and political structures.
Early Arab Family Trees and Tribal Systems
Tribal Clans: Ancient Arab society was deeply rooted in the concept of tribal affiliation. The family tree often extended across large tribal networks that governed the social and political dynamics of pre-Islamic Arabia. Families like the Quraysh tribe (to which the Prophet Muhammad belonged) and the Banu Hashim clan were particularly significant.
In these tribes, each family, or bayt, would have its own genealogical history, and knowing one’s ancestry was considered essential for social status, marriage eligibility, and political power.
Recorded Genealogies for Prestige and Protection: Genealogies also served as a form of social security. By tracing one&#x27;s family history back to notable ancestors, a family could bolster its claim to land, resources, or power. It also ensured that family members could protect themselves against challenges to their status or inheritance.
The Role of Ilm al-Ansab (Genealogy Science)The science of genealogy (Ilm al-Ansab) became a recognized scholarly field within the Arab world. Scholars and experts in genealogy would specialize in documenting, analyzing, and preserving genealogical records for the Arab tribes. This process led to the creation of family trees that not only had historical value but also served as political tools, especially in contexts where tribal affiliation played a key role in gaining or maintaining power.
While we can trace recorded family trees in the Arab world back to the early Islamic period, with prominent examples like the genealogy of the Prophet Muhammad and scholarly works by figures like Ibn Khaldun and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, the practice of preserving and documenting family lineages has ancient roots in Arab culture. Tribal identity and genealogical knowledge were integral to the social fabric of pre-Islamic Arabia and continue to play a significant role in modern Arab societies. The family tree, therefore, has always been a crucial part of Arab heritage, not just as a way of tracing descent but as a means of preserving cultural identity and social structure.

=== East Asia ===
There are extensive genealogies for the ruling dynasties of China, but these do not form a single, unified family tree. Additionally, it is unclear at which point(s) the most ancient historical figures named become mythological.

In Japan, the ancestry of the Imperial Family is traced back to the mythological origins of Japan. The connection to persons from the established historical record only begins in the mid-first millennium AD.

The longest family tree in the world is that of the Chinese philosopher and educator Confucius (551–479 BC), who is descended from King Tang (1675–1646 BC). The tree spans more than 80 generations from him and includes more than 2 million members. An international effort involving more than 450 branches around the world was started in 1998 to retrace and revise this family tree. A new edition of the Confucius genealogy was printed in September 2009 by the Confucius Genealogy Compilation Committee, to coincide with the 2560th anniversary of the birth of the Chinese thinker. This latest edition was expected to include some 1.3 million living members who are scattered around the world today.

=== Europe and West Asia ===
Before the Dark Ages, in the Greco-Roman world, some reliable pedigrees dated back perhaps at least as far as the first half of the first millennium BC; with claimed or mythological origins reaching back further. Roman clan and family lineages played an important part in the structure of their society and were the basis of their intricate system of personal names. However, there was a break in the continuity of record-keeping at the end of Classical Antiquity. Records of the lines of succession of the Popes and the Eastern Roman Emperors through this transitional period have survived, but these are not continuous genealogical histories of single families. Refer to descent from antiquity.

Many noble and aristocratic families of European and West Asian origin can reliably trace their ancestry back as far as the mid to late first millennium AD; some claiming undocumented descent from Classical Antiquity or mythological ancestors. In Europe, for example, the pedigree of Niall Noígíallach would be a contender for the longest, through Conn of the Hundred Battles (fl. 123 AD); in the legendary history of Ireland, he is further descended from Breogán, and ultimately from Adam, through the sons of Noah.

Another very old and extensive tree is that of the Lurie lineage—which includes Sigmund Freud and Martin Buber—and traces back to Lurie, a 13th-century rabbi in Brest-Litovsk, and from there to Rashi and purportedly back to the legendary King David, as documented by Neil Rosenstein in his book &quot;The Lurie Legacy&quot;. The 1999 edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; recorded the Lurie family in the &quot;longest lineage&quot; category as one of the oldest-known living families in the world today.

Family trees and representations of lineages are also important in religious traditions. The biblical genealogies of Jesus also claim descent from the House of David, covering a period of approximately 1000 years. In the Torah and Old Testament, genealogies are provided for many biblical persons, including a record of the descendants of Adam. Also according to the Torah, the Kohanim are descended from Aaron. Genetic testing performed at the Technion has shown that most modern Kohanim share common Y-chromosome origins, although there is no complete family tree of the Kohanim. In the Islamic world, claimed descent from Muhammad greatly enhanced the status of political and religious leaders; new dynasties often used claims of such descent to help establish their legitimacy.

=== Elsewhere ===
Elsewhere, in many human cultures, clan and tribal associations are based on claims of common ancestry, although detailed documentation of those origins is often very limited.

=== Global ===
Forms of family trees are also used in genetic genealogy. In 2022, scientists reported the largest detailed human genetic genealogy, that unifies human genomes from many sources for insights about human history, ancestry and evolution and demonstrates a novel computational method for estimating how human DNA is related via a series of 13 million linked trees along the genome, a , which has been described as the largest &quot;human family tree&quot;.

<doc id="169270" wikidata="Q184204" url="?curid=169270" title="Macrophage">
<text>Macrophages (; abbreviated M[[Phi|φ]], MΦ or MP) are a type of white blood cell of the innate immune system that engulf and digest pathogens, such as cancer cells, microbes, cellular debris and foreign substances, which do not have proteins that are specific to healthy body cells on their surface. This process is called phagocytosis, which acts to defend the host against infection and injury.

Macrophages are found in essentially all tissues, where they patrol for potential pathogens by amoeboid movement. They take various forms (with various names) throughout the body (e.g., histiocytes, Kupffer cells, alveolar macrophages, microglia, and others), but all are part of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Besides phagocytosis, they play a critical role in nonspecific defense (innate immunity) and also help initiate specific defense mechanisms (adaptive immunity) by recruiting other immune cells such as lymphocytes. For example, they are important as antigen presenters to T cells. In humans, dysfunctional macrophages cause severe diseases such as chronic granulomatous disease that result in frequent infections.

Beyond increasing inflammation and stimulating the immune system, macrophages also play an important anti-inflammatory role and can decrease immune reactions through the release of cytokines. Macrophages that encourage inflammation are called M1 macrophages, whereas those that decrease inflammation and encourage tissue repair are called M2 macrophages. This difference is reflected in their metabolism; M1 macrophages have the unique ability to metabolize arginine to the &quot;killer&quot; molecule nitric oxide, whereas M2 macrophages have the unique ability to metabolize arginine to the &quot;repair&quot; molecule ornithine. However, this dichotomy has been recently questioned as further complexity has been discovered.

Human macrophages are about in diameter and are produced by the differentiation of monocytes in tissues. They can be identified using flow cytometry or immunohistochemical staining by their specific expression of proteins such as CD14, CD40, CD11b, CD64, F4/80 (mice)/EMR1 (human), lysozyme M, MAC-1/MAC-3 and CD68.

Macrophages were first discovered and named by Élie Metchnikoff, a Russian Empire zoologist, in 1884.

== Structure ==
=== Types ===


A majority of macrophages are stationed at strategic points where microbial invasion or accumulation of foreign particles is likely to occur. These cells together as a group are known as the mononuclear phagocyte system and were previously known as the reticuloendothelial system. Each type of macrophage, determined by its location, has a specific name:

Investigations concerning Kupffer cells are hampered because in humans, Kupffer cells are only accessible for immunohistochemical analysis from biopsies or autopsies. From rats and mice, they are difficult to isolate, and after purification, only approximately 5 million cells can be obtained from one mouse.

Macrophages can express paracrine functions within organs that are specific to the function of that organ. In the testis, for example, macrophages have been shown to be able to interact with Leydig cells by secreting 25-hydroxycholesterol, an oxysterol that can be converted to testosterone by neighbouring Leydig cells. Also, testicular macrophages may participate in creating an immune privileged environment in the testis, and in mediating infertility during inflammation of the testis.

Cardiac resident macrophages participate in electrical conduction via gap junction communication with cardiac myocytes.

Macrophages can be classified on basis of the fundamental function and activation. According to this grouping, there are classically activated (M1) macrophages, wound-healing macrophages (also known as alternatively-activated (M2) macrophages), and regulatory macrophages (Mregs).

== Development ==
Macrophages that reside in adult healthy tissues either derive from circulating monocytes or are established before birth and then maintained during adult life independently of monocytes. By contrast, most of the macrophages that accumulate at diseased sites typically derive from circulating monocytes. Leukocyte extravasation describes monocyte entry into damaged tissue through the endothelium of blood vessels as they become macrophages. Monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis, triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells, pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site. At some sites such as the testis, macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation. Unlike short-lived neutrophils, macrophages survive longer in the body, up to several months.

== Function ==
=== Phagocytosis ===

Macrophages are professional phagocytes and are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris. This role is important in chronic inflammation, as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils, which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age (see CD31 for a description of this process).

The neutrophils are at first attracted to a site, where they perform their function and die, before they or their neutrophil extracellular traps are phagocytized by the macrophages. When at the site, the first wave of neutrophils, after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours, stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils.

The removal of dying cells is, to a greater extent, handled by &quot;fixed macrophages&quot;, which will stay at strategic locations such as the lungs, liver, neural tissue, bone, spleen and connective tissue, ingesting foreign materials such as pathogens and recruiting additional macrophages if needed.

When a macrophage ingests a pathogen, the pathogen becomes trapped in a phagosome, which then fuses with a lysosome. Within the phagolysosome, enzymes and toxic peroxides digest the pathogen. However, some bacteria, such as &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, have become resistant to these methods of digestion. Typhoidal &quot;Salmonellae&quot; induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo, and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action, thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis. Macrophages can digest more than 100 bacteria before they finally die due to their own digestive compounds.

=== Role in innate immune response ===
When a pathogen invades, tissue resident macrophages are among the first cells to respond. Two of the main roles of the tissue resident macrophages are to phagocytose incoming antigen and to secrete proinflammatory cytokines that induce inflammation and recruit other immune cells to the site.

==== Phagocytosis of pathogens ====

Macrophages can internalize antigens through receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Macrophages have a wide variety of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that can recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) from pathogens. Many PRRs, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), scavenger receptors (SRs), C-type lectin receptors, among others, recognize pathogens for phagocytosis. Macrophages can also recognize pathogens for phagocytosis indirectly through opsonins, which are molecules that attach to pathogens and mark them for phagocytosis. Opsonins can cause a stronger adhesion between the macrophage and pathogen during phagocytosis, hence opsonins tend to enhance macrophages’ phagocytic activity. Both complement proteins and antibodies can bind to antigens and opsonize them. Macrophages have complement receptor 1 (CR1) and 3 (CR3) that recognize pathogen-bound complement proteins C3b and iC3b, respectively, as well as fragment crystallizable γ receptors (FcγRs) that recognize the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of antigen-bound immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. When phagocytosing and digesting pathogens, macrophages go through a respiratory burst where more oxygen is consumed to supply the energy required for producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other antimicrobial molecules that digest the consumed pathogens.

==== Chemical secretion ====
Recognition of MAMPs by PRRs can activate tissue resident macrophages to secrete proinflammatory cytokines that recruit other immune cells. Among the PRRs, TLRs play a major role in signal transduction leading to cytokine production. The binding of MAMPs to TLR triggers a series of downstream events that eventually activates transcription factor NF-κB and results in transcription of the genes for several proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12B, and type I interferons such as IFN-α and IFN-β. Systemically, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α induce fever and initiate the acute phase response in which the liver secretes acute phase proteins. Locally, IL-1β and TNF-α cause vasodilation, where the gaps between blood vessel epithelial cells widen, and upregulation of cell surface adhesion molecules on epithelial cells to induce leukocyte extravasation. Additionally, activated macrophages have been found to have delayed synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) which are important mediators of inflammation and pain. Among the PGs, anti-inflammatory PGE2 and pro-inflammatory PGD2 increase the most after activation, with PGE2 increasing expression of IL-10 and inhibiting production of TNFs via the COX-2 pathway.

Neutrophils are among the first immune cells recruited by macrophages to exit the blood via extravasation and arrive at the infection site. Macrophages secrete many chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL8 (IL-8) that attract neutrophils to the site of infection. After neutrophils have finished phagocytosing and clearing the antigen at the end of the immune response, they undergo apoptosis, and macrophages are recruited from blood monocytes to help clear apoptotic debris.

Macrophages also recruit other immune cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, basophils, eosinophils, and T cells through chemokines such as CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Along with dendritic cells, macrophages help activate natural killer (NK) cells through secretion of type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) and IL-12. IL-12 acts with IL-18 to stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-γ) by NK cells, which serves as an important source of IFN-γ before the adaptive immune system is activated. IFN-γ enhances the innate immune response by inducing a more aggressive phenotype in macrophages, allowing macrophages to more efficiently kill pathogens.

Some of the T cell chemoattractants secreted by macrophages include CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11.

=== Role in adaptive immunity ===
==== Interactions with CD4+ T Helper Cells ====
Macrophages are professional antigen presenting cells (APC), meaning they can present peptides from phagocytosed antigens on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II molecules on their cell surface for T helper cells. Macrophages are not primary activators of naïve T helper cells that have never been previously activated since tissue resident macrophages do not travel to the lymph nodes where naïve T helper cells reside. Although macrophages are also found in secondary lymphoid organs like the lymph nodes, they do not reside in T cell zones and are not effective at activating naïve T helper cells. The macrophages in lymphoid tissues are more involved in ingesting antigens and preventing them from entering the blood, as well as taking up debris from apoptotic lymphocytes. Therefore, macrophages interact mostly with previously activated T helper cells that have left the lymph node and arrived at the site of infection or with tissue resident memory T cells.

Macrophages supply both signals required for T helper cell activation: 1) Macrophages present antigen peptide-bound MHC class II molecule to be recognized by the corresponding T cell receptor (TCR), and 2) recognition of pathogens by PRRs induce macrophages to upregulate the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 (also known as B7) that binds to CD28 on T helper cells to supply the co-stimulatory signal. These interactions allow T helper cells to achieve full effector function and provide T helper cells with continued survival and differentiation signals preventing them from undergoing apoptosis due to lack of TCR signaling. For example, IL-2 signaling in T cells upregulates the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, but T cell production of IL-2 and the high-affinity IL-2 receptor IL-2RA both require continued signal from TCR recognition of MHC-bound antigen.

==== Activation ====
Macrophages can achieve different activation phenotypes through interactions with different subsets of T helper cells, such as TH1 and TH2. Although there is a broad spectrum of macrophage activation phenotypes, there are two major phenotypes that are commonly acknowledged. They are the classically activated macrophages, or M1 macrophages, and the alternatively activated macrophages, or M2 macrophages. M1 macrophages are proinflammatory, while M2 macrophages are mostly anti-inflammatory.

===== Classical =====
TH1 cells play an important role in classical macrophage activation as part of type 1 immune response against intracellular pathogens (such as intracellular bacteria) that can survive and replicate inside host cells, especially those pathogens that replicate even after being phagocytosed by macrophages. After the TCR of TH1 cells recognize specific antigen peptide-bound MHC class II molecules on macrophages, TH1 cells 1) secrete IFN-γ and 2) upregulate the expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L), which binds to CD40 on macrophages. These 2 signals activate the macrophages and enhance their ability to kill intracellular pathogens through increased production of antimicrobial molecules such as nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2-). This enhancement of macrophages&#x27; antimicrobial ability by TH1 cells is known as classical macrophage activation, and the activated macrophages are known as classically activated macrophages, or M1 macrophages. The M1 macrophages in turn upregulate B7 molecules and antigen presentation through MHC class II molecules to provide signals that sustain T cell help. The activation of TH1 and M1 macrophage is a positive feedback loop, with IFN-γ from TH1 cells upregulating CD40 expression on macrophages; the interaction between CD40 on the macrophages and CD40L on T cells activate macrophages to secrete IL-12; and IL-12 promotes more IFN-γ secretion from TH1 cells. The initial contact between macrophage antigen-bound MHC II and TCR serves as the contact point between the two cells where most of the IFN-γ secretion and CD-40L on T cells concentrate to, so only macrophages directly interacting with TH1 cells are likely to be activated.

In addition to activating M1 macrophages, TH1 cells express Fas ligand (FasL) and lymphotoxin beta (LT-β) to help kill chronically infected macrophages that can no longer kill pathogens. The killing of chronically infected macrophages release pathogens to the extracellular space that can then be killed by other activated macrophages. TH1 cells also help recruit more monocytes, the precursor to macrophages, to the infection site. TH1 secretion TNF-α and LT-α to make blood vessels easier for monocytes to bind to and exit. TH1 secretion of CCL2 as a chemoattractant for monocytes. IL-3 and GM-CSF released by TH1 cells stimulate more monocyte production in the bone marrow.

When intracellular pathogens cannot be eliminated, such as in the case of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, the pathogen is contained through the formation of granuloma, an aggregation of infected macrophages surrounded by activated T cells. The macrophages bordering the activated lymphocytes often fuse to form multinucleated giant cells that appear to have increased antimicrobial ability due to their proximity to TH1 cells, but over time, the cells in the center start to die and form necrotic tissue.

===== Alternative =====
TH2 cells play an important role in alternative macrophage activation as part of type 2 immune response against large extracellular pathogens like helminths. TH2 cells secrete IL-4 and IL-13, which activate macrophages to become M2 macrophages, also known as alternatively activated macrophages. M2 macrophages express arginase-1, an enzyme that converts arginine to ornithine and urea. Ornithine help increase smooth muscle contraction to expel the worm and also participates in tissue and wound repair. Ornithine can be further metabolized to proline, which is essential for synthesizing collagen. M2 macrophages can also decrease inflammation by producing IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) and IL-1 receptors that do not lead to downstream inflammatory signaling (IL-1RII).

==== Interactions with CD8+ cytotoxic t cells ====
Another part of the adaptive immunity activation involves stimulating CD8+ via cross presentation of antigens peptides on MHC class I molecules. Studies have shown that proinflammatory macrophages are capable of cross presentation of antigens on MHC class I molecules, but whether macrophage cross-presentation plays a role in naïve or memory CD8+ T cell activation is still unclear.

==== Interactions with B cells ====
Macrophages have been shown to secrete cytokines BAFF and APRIL, which are important for plasma cell isotype switching. APRIL and IL-6 secreted by macrophage precursors in the bone marrow help maintain survival of plasma cells homed to the bone marrow.

==== Subtypes ====
There are several activated forms of macrophages. In spite of a spectrum of ways to activate macrophages, there are two main groups designated M1 and M2. M1 macrophages: as mentioned earlier (previously referred to as classically activated macrophages), M1 &quot;killer&quot; macrophages are activated by LPS and IFN-gamma, and secrete high levels of IL-12 and low levels of IL-10. M1 macrophages have pro-inflammatory, bactericidal, and phagocytic functions. In contrast, the M2 &quot;repair&quot; designation (also referred to as alternatively activated macrophages) broadly refers to macrophages that function in constructive processes like wound healing and tissue repair, and those that turn off damaging immune system activation by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10. M2 is the phenotype of resident tissue macrophages, and can be further elevated by IL-4. M2 macrophages produce high levels of IL-10, TGF-beta and low levels of IL-12. Tumor-associated macrophages are mainly of the M2 phenotype, and seem to actively promote tumor growth.

Macrophages exist in a variety of phenotypes which are determined by the role they play in wound maturation. Phenotypes can be predominantly separated into two major categories; M1 and M2. M1 macrophages are the dominating phenotype observed in the early stages of inflammation and are activated by four key mediators: interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These mediator molecules create a pro-inflammatory response that in return produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin-6 and TNF. Unlike M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages secrete an anti-inflammatory response via the addition of Interleukin-4 or Interleukin-13. They also play a role in wound healing and are needed for revascularization and reepithelialization. M2 macrophages are divided into four major types based on their roles: M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d. How M2 phenotypes are determined is still up for discussion but studies have shown that their environment allows them to adjust to whichever phenotype is most appropriate to efficiently heal the wound.

M2 macrophages are needed for vascular stability. They produce vascular endothelial growth factor-A and TGF-β1. There is a phenotype shift from M1 to M2 macrophages in acute wounds, however this shift is impaired for chronic wounds. This dysregulation results in insufficient M2 macrophages and its corresponding growth factors that aid in wound repair. With a lack of these growth factors/anti-inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from M1 macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner. Normally, after neutrophils eat debris/pathogens they perform apoptosis and are removed. At this point, inflammation is not needed and M1 undergoes a switch to M2 (anti-inflammatory). However, dysregulation occurs as the M1 macrophages are unable/do not phagocytose neutrophils that have undergone apoptosis leading to increased macrophage migration and inflammation.

Both M1 and M2 macrophages play a role in promotion of atherosclerosis. M1 macrophages promote atherosclerosis by inflammation. M2 macrophages can remove cholesterol from blood vessels, but when the cholesterol is oxidized, the M2 macrophages become apoptotic foam cells contributing to the atheromatous plaque of atherosclerosis.

=== Role in muscle regeneration ===
The first step to understanding the importance of macrophages in muscle repair, growth, and regeneration is that there are two &quot;waves&quot; of macrophages with the onset of damageable muscle use– subpopulations that do and do not directly have an influence on repairing muscle. The initial wave is a phagocytic population that comes along during periods of increased muscle use that are sufficient to cause muscle membrane lysis and membrane inflammation, which can enter and degrade the contents of injured muscle fibers. These early-invading, phagocytic macrophages reach their highest concentration about 24 hours following the onset of some form of muscle cell injury or reloading. Their concentration rapidly declines after 48 hours. The second group is the non-phagocytic types that are distributed near regenerative fibers. These peak between two and four days and remain elevated for several days while muscle tissue is rebuilding. The first subpopulation has no direct benefit to repairing muscle, while the second non-phagocytic group does.

It is thought that macrophages release soluble substances that influence the proliferation, differentiation, growth, repair, and regeneration of muscle, but at this time the factor that is produced to mediate these effects is unknown. It is known that macrophages&#x27; involvement in promoting tissue repair is not muscle specific; they accumulate in numerous tissues during the healing process phase following injury.

=== Role in wound healing ===
Macrophages are essential for wound healing. They replace polymorphonuclear neutrophils as the predominant cells in the wound by day two after injury. Attracted to the wound site by growth factors released by platelets and other cells, monocytes from the bloodstream enter the area through blood vessel walls. Numbers of monocytes in the wound peak one to one and a half days after the injury occurs. Once they are in the wound site, monocytes mature into macrophages. The spleen contains half the body&#x27;s monocytes in reserve ready to be deployed to injured tissue.

The macrophage&#x27;s main role is to phagocytize bacteria and damaged tissue, and they also debride damaged tissue by releasing proteases. Macrophages also secrete a number of factors such as growth factors and other cytokines, especially during the third and fourth post-wound days. These factors attract cells involved in the proliferation stage of healing to the area. Macrophages may also restrain the contraction phase. Macrophages are stimulated by the low oxygen content of their surroundings to produce factors that induce and speed angiogenesis and they also stimulate cells that re-epithelialize the wound, create granulation tissue, and lay down a new extracellular matrix. By secreting these factors, macrophages contribute to pushing the wound healing process into the next phase.

=== Role in limb regeneration ===
Scientists have elucidated that as well as eating up material debris, macrophages are involved in the typical limb regeneration in the salamander. They found that removing the macrophages from a salamander resulted in failure of limb regeneration and a scarring response.

=== Role in iron homeostasis ===
As described above, macrophages play a key role in removing dying or dead cells and cellular debris. Erythrocytes have a lifespan on average of 120 days and so are constantly being destroyed by macrophages in the spleen and liver. Macrophages will also engulf macromolecules, and so play a key role in the pharmacokinetics of parenteral irons.

The iron that is released from the haemoglobin is either stored internally in ferritin or is released into the circulation via ferroportin. In cases where systemic iron levels are raised, or where inflammation is present, raised levels of hepcidin act on macrophage ferroportin channels, leading to iron remaining within the macrophages.

=== Role in pigment retainment ===

Melanophages are a subset of tissue-resident macrophages able to absorb pigment, either native to the organism or exogenous (such as tattoos), from extracellular space. In contrast to dendritic juncional melanocytes, which synthesize melanosomes and contain various stages of their development, the melanophages only accumulate phagocytosed melanin in lysosome-like phagosomes. This occurs repeatedly as the pigment from dead dermal macrophages is phagocytosed by their successors, preserving the tattoo in the same place.

=== Role in tissue homeostasis ===
Every tissue harbors its own specialized population of resident macrophages, which entertain reciprocal interconnections with the stroma and functional tissue. These resident macrophages are sessile (non-migratory), provide essential growth factors to support the physiological function of the tissue (e.g. macrophage-neuronal crosstalk in the guts), and can actively protect the tissue from inflammatory damage.

=== Nerve-associated macrophages ===
Nerve-associated macrophages or NAMs are those tissue-resident macrophages that are associated with nerves. Some of them are known to have an elongated morphology of up to 200μm 

== Clinical significance ==
Due to their role in phagocytosis, macrophages are involved in many diseases of the immune system. For example, they participate in the formation of granulomas, inflammatory lesions that may be caused by a large number of diseases. Some disorders, mostly rare, of ineffective phagocytosis and macrophage function have been described, for example.

=== As a host for intracellular pathogens ===
In their role as a phagocytic immune cell macrophages are responsible for engulfing pathogens to destroy them. Some pathogens subvert this process and instead live inside the macrophage. This provides an environment in which the pathogen is hidden from the immune system and allows it to replicate.

Diseases with this type of behaviour include tuberculosis (caused by &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;) and leishmaniasis (caused by &quot;Leishmania&quot; species).

In order to minimize the possibility of becoming the host of an intracellular bacteria, macrophages have evolved defense mechanisms such as induction of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates, which are toxic to microbes. Macrophages have also evolved the ability to restrict the microbe&#x27;s nutrient supply and induce autophagy.

==== Tuberculosis ====
Once engulfed by a macrophage, the causative agent of tuberculosis, &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, avoids cellular defenses and uses the cell to replicate. Recent evidence suggests that in response to the pulmonary infection of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, the peripheral macrophages matures into M1 phenotype. Macrophage M1 phenotype is characterized by increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6) and increased glycolytic activities essential for clearance of infection.

==== Leishmaniasis ====
Upon phagocytosis by a macrophage, the &quot;Leishmania&quot; parasite finds itself in a phagocytic vacuole. Under normal circumstances, this phagocytic vacuole would develop into a lysosome and its contents would be digested. &quot;Leishmania&quot; alter this process and avoid being destroyed; instead, they make a home inside the vacuole.

==== Chikungunya ====
Infection of macrophages in joints is associated with local inflammation during and after the acute phase of &quot;Chikungunya&quot; (caused by CHIKV or Chikungunya virus).

==== Others ====
Adenovirus (most common cause of pink eye) can remain latent in a host macrophage, with continued viral shedding 6–18 months after initial infection.

&quot;Brucella spp.&quot; can remain latent in a macrophage via inhibition of phagosome–lysosome fusion; causes brucellosis (undulant fever).

&quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;, the causative agent of Legionnaires&#x27; disease, also establishes residence within macrophages.

=== Heart disease ===
Macrophages are the predominant cells involved in creating the progressive plaque lesions of atherosclerosis.

Focal recruitment of macrophages occurs after the onset of acute myocardial infarction. These macrophages function to remove debris, apoptotic cells and to prepare for tissue regeneration. Macrophages protect against ischemia-induced ventricular tachycardia in hypokalemic mice.

=== HIV infection ===
Macrophages also play a role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Like T cells, macrophages can be infected with HIV, and even become a reservoir of ongoing virus replication throughout the body. HIV can enter the macrophage through binding of gp120 to CD4 and second membrane receptor, CCR5 (a chemokine receptor). Both circulating monocytes and macrophages serve as a reservoir for the virus. Macrophages are better able to resist infection by HIV-1 than CD4+ T cells, although susceptibility to HIV infection differs among macrophage subtypes.

=== Cancer ===
Macrophages can contribute to tumor growth and progression by promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion, fostering tumor angiogenesis and suppressing antitumor immune cells. Inflammatory compounds, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha released by the macrophages activate the gene switch nuclear factor-kappa B. NF-κB then enters the nucleus of a tumor cell and turns on production of proteins that stop apoptosis and promote cell proliferation and inflammation. Moreover, macrophages serve as a source for many pro-angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF/CSF1) and IL-1 and IL-6, contributing further to the tumor growth. 

Macrophages have been shown to infiltrate a number of tumors. Their number correlates with poor prognosis in certain cancers, including cancers of breast, cervix, bladder, brain and prostate. Some tumors can also produce factors, including M-CSF/CSF1, MCP-1/CCL2 and Angiotensin II, that trigger the amplification and mobilization of macrophages in tumors. Additionally, subcapsular sinus macrophages in tumor-draining lymph nodes can suppress cancer progression by containing the spread of tumor-derived materials.

=== Cancer therapy ===
Experimental studies indicate that macrophages can affect all therapeutic modalities, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Macrophages can influence treatment outcomes both positively and negatively. Macrophages can be protective in different ways: they can remove dead tumor cells (in a process called phagocytosis) following treatments that kill these cells; they can serve as drug depots for some anticancer drugs; they can also be activated by some therapies to promote antitumor immunity. Macrophages can also be deleterious in several ways: for example they can suppress various chemotherapies, radiotherapies and immunotherapies. Because macrophages can regulate tumor progression, therapeutic strategies to reduce the number of these cells, or to manipulate their phenotypes, are currently being tested in cancer patients. However, macrophages are also involved in antibody mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and this mechanism has been proposed to be important for certain cancer immunotherapy antibodies. Similarly, studies identified macrophages genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors as promising therapeutic approach to lowering tumor burden.

=== Obesity ===
It has been observed that increased number of pro-inflammatory macrophages within obese adipose tissue contributes to obesity complications including insulin resistance and diabetes type 2.

The modulation of the inflammatory state of adipose tissue macrophages has therefore been considered a possible therapeutic target to treat obesity-related diseases. Although adipose tissue macrophages are subject to anti-inflammatory homeostatic control by sympathetic innervation, experiments using ADRB2 gene knockout mice indicate that this effect is indirectly exerted through the modulation of adipocyte function, and not through direct Beta-2 adrenergic receptor activation, suggesting that adrenergic stimulation of macrophages may be insufficient to impact adipose tissue inflammation or function in obesity.

Within the fat (adipose) tissue of CCR2 deficient mice, there is an increased number of eosinophils, greater alternative macrophage activation, and a propensity towards type 2 cytokine expression. Furthermore, this effect was exaggerated when the mice became obese from a high fat diet. This is partially caused by a phenotype switch of macrophages induced by necrosis of fat cells (adipocytes). In an obese individual some adipocytes burst and undergo necrotic death, which causes the residential M2 macrophages to switch to M1 phenotype. This is one of the causes of a low-grade systemic chronic inflammatory state associated with obesity.

== Intestinal macrophages ==
Though very similar in structure to tissue macrophages, intestinal macrophages have evolved specific characteristics and functions given their natural environment, which is in the digestive tract. Macrophages and intestinal macrophages have high plasticity causing their phenotype to be altered by their environments. Like macrophages, intestinal macrophages are differentiated monocytes, though intestinal macrophages have to coexist with the microbiome in the intestines. This is a challenge considering the bacteria found in the gut are not recognized as &quot;self&quot; and could be potential targets for phagocytosis by the macrophage.

To prevent the destruction of the gut bacteria, intestinal macrophages have developed key differences compared to other macrophages. Primarily, intestinal macrophages do not induce inflammatory responses. Whereas tissue macrophages release various inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, intestinal macrophages do not produce or secrete inflammatory cytokines. This change is directly caused by the intestinal macrophages environment. Surrounding intestinal epithelial cells release TGF-β, which induces the change from proinflammatory macrophage to noninflammatory macrophage.

Even though the inflammatory response is downregulated in intestinal macrophages, phagocytosis is still carried out. There is no drop off in phagocytosis efficiency as intestinal macrophages are able to effectively phagocytize the bacteria,&quot;S. typhimurium&quot; and &quot;E. coli&quot;, but intestinal macrophages still do not release cytokines, even after phagocytosis. Also, intestinal macrophages do not express lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IgA, or IgG receptors. The lack of LPS receptors is important for the gut as the intestinal macrophages do not detect the microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPS/PAMPS) of the intestinal microbiome. Nor do they express IL-2 and IL-3 growth factor receptors.

=== Role in disease ===

Intestinal macrophages have been shown to play a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn&#x27;s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In a healthy gut, intestinal macrophages limit the inflammatory response in the gut, but in a disease-state, intestinal macrophage numbers and diversity are altered. This leads to inflammation of the gut and disease symptoms of IBD. Intestinal macrophages are critical in maintaining gut homeostasis. The presence of inflammation or pathogen alters this homeostasis, and concurrently alters the intestinal macrophages. There has yet to be a determined mechanism for the alteration of the intestinal macrophages by recruitment of new monocytes or changes in the already present intestinal macrophages.

Additionally, a new study reveals macrophages limit iron access to bacteria by releasing extracellular vesicles, improving sepsis outcomes.

== Media ==
== History ==

Macrophages were first discovered late in the 19th century by zoologist Élie Metchnikoff. Metchnikoff revolutionized the branch of macrophages by combining philosophical insights and the evolutionary study of life. Later on, Van Furth during the 1960s proposed the idea that circulating blood monocytes in adults allowed for the origin of all tissue macrophages. In recent years, publishing regarding macrophages has led people to believe that multiple resident tissue macrophages are independent of the blood monocytes as it is formed during the embryonic stage of development. Within the 21st century, all the ideas concerning the origin of macrophages (present in tissues) were compiled together to suggest that physiologically complex organisms, from macrophages independently by mechanisms that don&#x27;t have to depend on the blood monocytes.

<text>The written history of the Cape Colony in what is now South Africa began when Portuguese navigator Bartolomeu Dias became the first modern European to round the Cape of Good Hope in 1488. In 1497, Vasco da Gama sailed along the whole coast of South Africa on his way to India, landed at St Helena Bay for 8 days, and made a detailed description of the area. The Portuguese, attracted by the riches of Asia, made no permanent settlement at the Cape Colony. However, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) settled the area as a location where vessels could restock water and provisions.

== First settlement ==
The Dutch East India Company settlement in the area began in March 1647, with the shipwreck of the Dutch ship &quot;Nieuwe Haarlem&quot;. The shipwreck victims built a small fort that they named the &quot;Sand Fort of the Cape of Good Hope.&quot; They stayed for nearly one year, until they were rescued by a fleet of 12 ships under the command of W. G. de Jong.

After their return to Holland some of the shipwrecked crewmates tried to persuade the Dutch East India Company to open a trading center at the Cape.

A Dutch East India Company expedition of 90 Calvinist settlers, under the command of Jan van Riebeeck, founded the first permanent settlement near the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. Jan van Riebeeck was on one of the rescue ships that had come to rescue the shipwrecked sailors, and upon seeing the land, he decided to return. They arrived in the harbour of modern-day Cape Town on 6 April 1652 with five ships:

#&quot;Reijger&quot;, 
#&quot;Oliphant&quot;, 
#&quot;Goede Hoop&quot;, 
#&quot;Walvisch&quot;, 
#&quot;Dromedaris&quot;.

The settlers initially built a clay and timber fort, which was replaced between 1666 and 1679 by the Castle of Good Hope, which is now the oldest building in South Africa. The Colony began properly in 1671 with the first purchase of land from the Khoikhoi (called &quot;Hottentots&quot; by the settlers) beyond the original limits of the fort built by van Riebeeck.

A long term policy of the VOC was to limit the growth of the colony to a small clearly defined area. Initially the VOC had hoped to employ a small number of servants and employees to produce food close to the fortress whilst obtaining cattle from the local Khoikhoi. However repeated crop failures convinced company officials to release nine servants to become semi-independent burgers who would produce food on free hold farms. Land grants were limited until the arrival of the colony&#x27;s new commander Simon van der Stel in 1679.

van der Stel pursued an expansionist agricultural policy which was continued by his son William thereby increasing the number of farms in the colony to 258 by 1705. The number of free hold farms almost doubled by 1731 to 435 farms. Income inequality increased rapidly in the early years of the colony&#x27;s development and by 1731 only 7% of the colony&#x27;s small free settler population controlled over half of all the private property in the colony.

The earliest colonists were, for the most part, from the lower, working class and displayed an indifferent attitude towards developing the colony, but after a commissioner that was sent out in 1685 to attract more settlers, a more dedicated group of immigrants began to arrive. French refugees began to arrive in the Cape after leaving their country after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. This small body of immigrants had a marked influence on the character of the Dutch settlers. Owing to the policy instituted in 1701 of the Dutch East India Company which dictated that schools should teach exclusively in Dutch and strict laws of assembly, the Huguenots ceased by the middle of the 18th century to maintain a distinct identity, and the knowledge of French disappeared. By the late 1700s the Cape Colony was one of the best developed European settlements outside Europe or the Americas.

==Economy==

The two pillars of the Cape Colony&#x27;s economy for almost the entirety of its history were shipping and agriculture. Its strategic position meant that prior to the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 almost every ship sailing between Europe and Asia stopped off at the colony&#x27;s capital Cape Town. The supplying of these ships with fresh provisions, fruit, and wine provided a very large market for the surplus produce of the colony.

== Further expansion ==

The Cape colonists gradually acquired all of the land of the Khoikhoi to the north and east of their base at Cape Town. Besides those who died in warfare, whole tribes of Khoikhoi were severely disrupted by smallpox epidemics in 1713 and 1755. A few remaining tribes maintained their independence, but the majority of the Khoikhoi took jobs with the colonists as herdsmen. The Dutch East India Company government passed a law in 1787 subjecting the remaining nomadic Khoikhoi to certain restrictions. The direct effect of this law was to make the Khoikhoi even more dependent upon the farmers, or to compel them to migrate northward beyond the colonial border. Those who chose the latter encountered the hostility of their old foes, the San, who inhabited the plains from the Nieuwveld and Sneeuwberg mountains to the Orange River.

== Conflicts with the Dutch East India Company ==

Neither the hostility of the natives, nor the struggle to make agriculture profitable on &quot;Karoo&quot; or &quot;veld&quot;, slowed the progress made by the colonists as much as the narrow and tyrannical policy adopted by the Dutch East India Company. The Company stopped the colony&#x27;s policy of open immigration, monopolised trade, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers into one body, told the farmers what crops to grow, demanded a large percentage of every farmer&#x27;s harvest, and harassed them. This tended to discourage further development of industry and enterprise. From these roots sprung a dislike of orderly government, and libertarian view-point that has characterised the &quot;boers&quot; or Dutch farmers for many generations. Seeking largely to escape the oppression of the Dutch East India Company, the farmers trekked farther and farther from the seat of government. The company, to control these emigrants, established a magistracy at Swellendam in 1745 and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786. The authorities declared the Gamtoos River as the eastern frontier of the colony, but the trekkers soon crossed it. To avoid collision with the bantu tribes advancing south and west from east central Africa, the Dutch agreed in 1780 to make the Great Fish River the boundary of the colony. In 1795 the heavily taxed boers of the frontier districts, who received no protection against the Africans, expelled the officials of the Dutch East India Company, and established independent governments at Swellendam and at Graaff-Reinet.

The Netherlands fell to the French army under the leadership of Napoléon Bonaparte in 1795. Reacting to the weakness of the Dutch East India Company holdings, a British force under Sir James Henry Craig set out for Cape Town to secure the colony for the Stadtholder Prince William V of Orange against the French. The governor of Cape Town refused at first to obey any instructions from the prince, but after Craig threatened to use force, he capitulated. The boers of Graaff Reinet did not surrender until an army had been sent against them, and in 1799 and again in 1801 they rose in revolt. In February 1803, as a result of the Peace of Amiens, the colony came under the control of the Batavian Republic.

<doc id="169281" wikidata="Q453949" url="?curid=169281" title="Charo">
<text>María Rosario Pilar Martínez Molina Baeza, professionally known by her stage name Charo, is a Spanish-born actress, singer, comedian, and flamenco guitarist who rose to international prominence in the 1960s on American television, as well as starring in several films.

Charo began playing classical (Spanish-style) guitar at the age of nine, training under the famed guitarist Andrés Segovia. In 1966, she married 66-year-old bandleader Xavier Cugat and moved to the United States with him. In the late 1960s and 1970s, she became a ubiquitous presence on American television, frequently appearing as a guest star on series such as &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. She is known for her uninhibited and exuberant manner, high energy levels, vague age, heavy Spanish accent, and catchphrase &quot;cuchi-cuchi&quot;. She frequently pokes fun at herself, while also pointing out the potential judgment of others, through her accent.

As a musician, Charo has performed and recorded in various styles for five decades. She released a series of disco recordings in the 1970s with Salsoul Records, most notably &quot;Dance a Little Bit Closer&quot; (1977). In 1995 her flamenco album &quot;Guitar Passion&quot; (1994) was awarded Female Pop Album of the Year at the &quot;Billboard&quot; International Latin Music Conference, and was named Best Female Latin Pop Album by &quot;Billboard&quot; Magazine. In an interview, Charo has said, &quot;Around the world I am known as a great musician. But in America I am known as the cuchi-cuchi girl. That&#x27;s okay, because cuchi-cuchi has taken me .&quot;

==Early life==
Charo was born in the city of Murcia, Spain. Her birth date has been a matter of some dispute (see &#x27;Birth year controversy&#x27; below). Her Spanish passport gives her name as María del Rosario Mercedes Pilar Martínez Molina Baeza.

Charo has claimed she was enrolled in a convent school until the age of 15, when a nun told her that she belonged in show business. In the most colorful version of her childhood, Charo&#x27;s grandmother hired a music professor to give her weekly classical guitar lessons, and he became the first man to enter the convent.

In a 2005 interview, she reminisced: &quot;The institution had great young teachers and students. Everything was a charity. Mr. Segovia, between concerts that&#x27;s when he&#x27;d come, and if you&#x27;d been there a year and you weren&#x27;t good, you&#x27;d go out and they would give your place to another young kid.&quot;
Charo has stated in several interviews that she graduated with honors at age 16.

Bandleader Xavier Cugat &quot;discovered&quot; her while in Spain filming a television special in 1964. They wed on August 7, 1966. An April 1966 column by Earl Wilson on the couple&#x27;s wedding plans announced: &quot;Sixty-year-old Xavier Cugat and his 20-year-old Spanish girlfriend and singing star Charo hope to marry in San Cugat, Spain, in a few days if Cugat can convince church authorities his two divorces should not be counted against him since he wasn&#x27;t married in church.&quot;

They were the first couple to be wed at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Charo later claimed that her marriage to Cugat was merely a business contract, a way for him to legally bring her to the United States.

===Birth year controversy===

Charo&#x27;s year of birth is the subject of dispute. Her Spanish birth certificate and passport, as well as her American naturalization papers, give her birthdate as March 13, 1941. She later claimed she was born in 1947, then changed it to 1949. In 1977, she asserted in a court hearing that her passport and naturalization papers were incorrect and that her birthdate was January 15, 1951.

Several newspaper articles around the time of her 1966 wedding to Cugat gave Charo&#x27;s age as 17. Others referred to her as Cugat&#x27;s &quot;18-year-old protégée&quot;. An April 1966 column on the wedding plans stated that she was 20 and Cugat was 60. Many sources identified her as 21 on the day of her wedding.

Later, when asserting her birthdate was 1951, she claimed her parents allowed her to falsify her age to appear older when marrying Cugat. However, that would have made her 15 at the time, contradicting her claim to have graduated from school at 16, not yet having begun her performing career. She has never clarified the discrepancy.

In October 1977, the same year in which Charo filed for divorce from Cugat and became a naturalized American citizen, judge Roger Foley in Las Vegas adjudicated the 1951 birth year to be official. Charo provided sworn affidavits from her parents, although the claim has been viewed with skepticism. Commenting on the disputes over her age, she has said that the public&#x27;s disbelief could prove advantageous: &quot;But if people really believe I&#x27;m older, that&#x27;s fine. Don&#x27;t be surprised if I come out with my own cosmetics, a new energy bar, and maybe some vitamins.&quot;

==Career==

Charo was highly visible throughout the 1970s, appearing ten times on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and on variety and talk shows such as &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;, &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn&quot;, &quot;The Captain and Tennille&quot;, &quot;The John Davidson Show&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; (which she guest-hosted at least once) and the short-lived &quot;The Brady Bunch Variety Hour&quot;.

In 1975, &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; critic Harry Bowman wrote that the ABC network had &quot;penciled in . . . a half-hour comedy starring the uninhibited wife of Xavier Cugat&quot; and commented, &quot;This is probably the worst idea of the season.&quot; By October of that year, Charo was promoting a TV special slated for November, but it did not actually appear until May 1976.

A TV listing for August 24, 1976, shows what appears to be an unsold pilot airing on ABC at 8:30 p.m. CST: &quot;&quot;Charo and the Sergeant&quot;—Situation comedy starring Charo Cugat. Charo&#x27;s first U.S. job is to be a dancer at an off-limits nightclub, and her conservative Marine Corps husband finds out. The few episodes that were taped ended up being broadcast on the American Armed Forces Network overseas.&quot;

By the late 1970s, Charo was being mentioned as an example of how overexposure could damage a celebrity. One such article quoted the &quot;Q score&quot; of Performer Q, Steve Levitt&#x27;s celebrity popularity rating service, to show that her popularity declined slightly even as her familiarity increased:

She was named Best Flamenco Guitarist in &quot;Guitar Player Magazine&quot;″s readers&#x27; poll twice.

Charo returned to the dance-music scene in June 2008 with the single &quot;España Cañi&quot;, which was released through Universal Wave Records.

On March 1, 2017, Charo was revealed a contestant for Season 24 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, paired with professional dancer Keo Motsepe. On April 3, 2017, they were the second couple eliminated from the competition and finished in 11th place.

==Personal life==
In 1977, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States. That year, she filed for divorce from Cugat, which was granted on April 14, 1978.

On August 11, 1978, she married her second husband, producer Kjell Rasten, in South Lake Tahoe, California. He soon became her manager. They have one child, son Shel Rasten (born 1981), who is the drummer for the heavy metal band Treazen. He is also an actor and producer, known for &quot;The Boulevard&quot; (2013), &quot;FAMOUS (and on the List)&quot; (2010) and &quot;&quot; (2002).

They moved to Hawaii, but eventually moved back to Beverly Hills, California.

Rasten died by suicide on February 18, 2019, at the age of 78. Charo publicly stated: In recent years, his health began to decline and he developed a rare and horrible skin disease called bullous pemphigoid. He also became very depressed. That, along with the many medications he needed to take, became too much for him, and he ended his suffering.

<doc id="169283" wikidata="Q5011347" url="?curid=169283" title="CHSH inequality">
<text>In physics, the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt (CHSH) inequality can be used in the proof of Bell&#x27;s theorem, which states that certain consequences of entanglement in quantum mechanics cannot be reproduced by local hidden-variable theories. Experimental verification of the inequality being violated is seen as confirmation that nature cannot be described by such theories. CHSH stands for John Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony, and Richard Holt, who described it in a much-cited paper published in 1969. They derived the CHSH inequality, which, as with John Stewart Bell&#x27;s original inequality, is a constraint—on the statistical occurrence of &quot;coincidences&quot; in a Bell test—which is necessarily true if an underlying local hidden-variable theory exists. In practice, the inequality is routinely violated by modern experiments in quantum mechanics.

== Statement ==
The usual form of the CHSH inequality is

where
formula_1 and formula_2 are detector settings on side formula_3, formula_4 and formula_5 on side formula_6, the four combinations being tested in separate subexperiments. The terms formula_7 etc. are the quantum correlations of the particle pairs, where the quantum correlation is defined to be the expectation value of the product of the &quot;outcomes&quot; of the experiment, i.e. the statistical average of formula_8, where formula_9 are the separate outcomes, using the coding +1 for the &#x27;+&#x27; channel and −1 for the &#x27;−&#x27; channel. Clauser et al.&#x27;s 1969 derivation was oriented towards the use of &quot;two-channel&quot; detectors, and indeed it is for these that it is generally used, but under their method the only possible outcomes were +1 and −1. In order to adapt to real situations, which at the time meant the use of polarised light and single-channel polarisers, they had to interpret &#x27;−&#x27; as meaning &quot;non-detection in the &#x27;+&#x27; channel&quot;, i.e. either &#x27;−&#x27; or nothing. They did not in the original article discuss how the two-channel inequality could be applied in real experiments with real imperfect detectors, though it was later proved that the inequality itself was equally valid. The occurrence of zero outcomes, though, means it is no longer so obvious how the values of &quot;E&quot; are to be estimated from the experimental data.

The mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics predicts that the value of formula_10 exceeds 2 for systems prepared in suitable entangled states and the appropriate choice of measurement settings (see below). The maximum violation predicted by quantum mechanics is formula_11 (Tsirelson&#x27;s bound) and can be obtained from a maximal entangled Bell state.

== Experiments ==
Many Bell tests conducted subsequent to Alain Aspect&#x27;s second experiment in 1982 have used the CHSH inequality, estimating the terms using (3) and assuming fair sampling. Some dramatic violations of the inequality have been reported.

In practice most actual experiments have used light rather than the electrons that Bell originally had in mind. The property of interest is, in the best known experiments, the polarisation direction, though other properties can be used. The diagram shows a typical optical experiment. Coincidences (simultaneous detections) are recorded, the results being categorised as &#x27;++&#x27;, &#x27;+−&#x27;, &#x27;−+&#x27; or &#x27;−−&#x27; and corresponding counts accumulated.

Four separate subexperiments are conducted, corresponding to the four terms formula_12 in the test statistic &quot;S&quot; (, above). The settings , , , and are generally in practice chosen—the &quot;Bell test angles&quot;—these being the ones for which the quantum mechanical formula gives the greatest violation of the inequality.

For each selected value of formula_13, the numbers of coincidences in each category formula_14 are recorded. The experimental estimate for formula_12 is then calculated as:
 {N_{++} + N_{+-} + N_{-+}+ N_{--}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Once all the &#x27;s have been estimated, an experimental estimate of &quot;S&quot; (Eq. ) can be found. If it is numerically greater than 2 it has infringed the CHSH inequality and the experiment is declared to have supported the quantum mechanics prediction and ruled out all local hidden-variable theories.

The CHSH paper lists many preconditions (or &quot;reasonable and/or presumable assumptions&quot;) to derive the simplified theorem and formula. For example, for the method to be valid, it has to be assumed that the detected pairs are a fair sample of those emitted. In actual experiments, detectors are never 100% efficient, so that only a sample of the emitted pairs are detected. A subtle, related requirement is that the hidden variables do not influence or determine detection probability in a way that would lead to different samples at each arm of the experiment.

The CHSH inequality has been violated with photon pairs, beryllium ion pairs, ytterbium ion pairs, rubidium atom pairs, whole rubidium-atom cloud pairs, nitrogen vacancies in diamonds, and Josephson phase qubits.

== Derivation ==
The original 1969 derivation will not be given here since it is not easy to follow and involves the assumption that the outcomes are all +1 or −1, never zero. Bell&#x27;s 1971 derivation is more general. He effectively assumes the &quot;Objective Local Theory&quot; later used by Clauser and Horne. It is assumed that any hidden variables associated with the detectors themselves are independent on the two sides and can be averaged out from the start. Another derivation of interest is given in Clauser and Horne&#x27;s 1974 paper, in which they start from the CH74 inequality.

=== Bell&#x27;s 1971 derivation ===
The following is based on page 37 of Bell&#x27;s &quot;Speakable and Unspeakable&quot;, the main change being to use the symbol ‘&quot;E&quot;’ instead of ‘&quot;P&quot;’ for the expected value of the quantum correlation. This avoids any suggestion that the quantum correlation is itself a probability.

We start with the standard assumption of independence of the two sides, enabling us to obtain the joint probabilities of pairs of outcomes by multiplying the separate probabilities, for any selected value of the &quot;hidden variable&quot; λ. λ is assumed to be drawn from a fixed distribution of possible states of the source, the probability of the source being in the state λ for any particular trial being given by the density function ρ(λ), the integral of which over the complete hidden variable space is 1. We thus assume we can write:
formula_16
where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are the outcomes. Since the possible values of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are −1, 0 and +1, it follows that:
Then, if &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;′, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot;′ are alternative settings for the detectors,
:formula_17

Taking absolute values of both sides, and applying the triangle inequality to the right-hand side, we obtain

:formula_18

We use the fact that formula_19 and formula_20 are both non-negative to rewrite the right-hand side of this as
formula_21

By (), this must be less than or equal to
formula_22
which, using the fact that the integral of is 1, is equal to
formula_23
which is equal to formula_24.

Putting this together with the left-hand side, we have:
formula_25
which means that the left-hand side is less than or equal to both formula_26 and formula_27. That is:
formula_28
from which we obtain
formula_29
(by the triangle inequality again), which is the CHSH inequality.

=== Derivation from Clauser and Horne&#x27;s 1974 inequality ===

In their 1974 paper, Clauser and Horne show that the CHSH inequality can be derived from the CH74 one. As they tell us, in a two-channel experiment the CH74 single-channel test is still applicable and provides four sets of inequalities governing the probabilities &quot;p&quot; of coincidences.

Working from the inhomogeneous version of the inequality, we can write:
formula_30
where &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are each &#x27;+&#x27; or &#x27;−&#x27;, indicating which detectors are being considered.

To obtain the CHSH test statistic &quot;S&quot; (), all that is needed is to multiply the inequalities for which &quot;j&quot; is different from &quot;k&quot; by −1 and add these to the inequalities for which &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are the same.

== Optimal violation by a general quantum state ==
In experimental practice, the two particles are not an ideal EPR pair. There is a necessary and sufficient condition for a two-qubit density matrix formula_31 to violate the CHSH inequality, expressed by the maximum attainable polynomial &quot;S&quot;max defined in . This is important in entanglement-based quantum key distribution, where the secret key rate depends on the degree of measurement correlations.

Let us introduce a 3×3 real matrix formula_32 with elements formula_33, where formula_34 are the Pauli matrices. Then we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the real symmetric matrix formula_35,
formula_36
where the indices are sorted by formula_37. Then, the maximal CHSH polynomial is determined by the two greatest eigenvalues,
formula_38

=== Optimal measurement bases ===

There exists an optimal configuration of the measurement bases &quot;a, a&#x27;, b, b&quot;&#x27; for a given formula_31 that yields &quot;S&quot;max with at least one free parameter.

The projective measurement that yields either +1 or −1 for two orthogonal states formula_40 respectively, can be expressed by an operator formula_41. The choice of this measurement basis can be parametrized by a real unit vector formula_42 and the Pauli vector formula_43 by expressing formula_44. Then, the expected correlation in bases &quot;a, b&quot; is
formula_45
The numerical values of the basis vectors, when found, can be directly translated to the configuration of the projective measurements.

The optimal set of bases for the state formula_31 is found by taking the two greatest eigenvalues formula_47 and the corresponding eigenvectors formula_48 of formula_49, and finding the auxiliary unit vectors
formula_50
where formula_51 is a free parameter. We also calculate the acute angle
formula_52
to obtain the bases that maximize ,
formula_53

In entanglement-based quantum key distribution, there is another measurement basis used to communicate the secret key (formula_54 assuming Alice uses the side A). The bases formula_55 then need to minimize the quantum bit error rate &quot;Q&quot;, which is the probability of obtaining different measurement outcomes (+1 on one particle and −1 on the other). The corresponding bases are
formula_56
The CHSH polynomial &quot;S&quot; needs to be maximized as well, which together with the bases above creates the constraint formula_57.

== CHSH game ==
The CHSH game is a thought experiment involving two parties separated at a great distance (far enough to preclude classical communication at the speed of light), each of whom has access to one half of an entangled two-qubit pair. Analysis of this game shows that no classical local hidden-variable theory can explain the correlations that can result from entanglement. Since this game is indeed physically realizable, this gives strong evidence that classical physics is fundamentally incapable of explaining certain quantum phenomena, at least in a &quot;local&quot; fashion.

In the CHSH game, there are two cooperating players, Alice and Bob, and a referee, Charlie. These agents will be abbreviated formula_58 respectively. At the start of the game, Charlie chooses bits formula_59 uniformly at random, and then sends formula_60 to Alice and formula_61 to Bob. Alice and Bob must then each respond to Charlie with bits formula_62 respectively. Now, once Alice and Bob send their responses back to Charlie, Charlie tests if formula_63, where ∧ denotes a logical AND operation and ⊕ denotes a logical XOR operation. If this equality holds, then Alice and Bob win, and if not then they lose.

It is also required that Alice and Bob&#x27;s responses can only depend on the bits they see: so Alice&#x27;s response formula_1 depends only on formula_60, and similarly for Bob. This means that Alice and Bob are forbidden from directly communicating with each other about the values of the bits sent to them by Charlie. However, Alice and Bob are allowed to decide on a common &quot;strategy&quot; before the game begins.

In the following sections, it is shown that if Alice and Bob use only classical strategies involving their local information (and potentially some random coin tosses), it is impossible for them to win with a probability higher than 75%. However, if Alice and Bob are allowed to share a single entangled qubit pair, then there exists a strategy which allows Alice and Bob to succeed with a probability of ~85%.

=== Optimal classical strategy ===
We first establish that any &quot;deterministic&quot; classical strategy has success probability at most 75% (where the probability is taken over Charlie&#x27;s uniformly random choice of formula_66). By a deterministic strategy, we mean a pair of functions formula_67, where formula_68 is a function determining Alice&#x27;s response as a function of the message she receives from Charlie, and formula_69 is a function determining Bob&#x27;s response based on what he receives. To prove that any deterministic strategy fails at least 25% of the time, we can simply consider all possible pairs of strategies for Alice and Bob, of which there are at most 8 (for each party, there are 4 functions formula_70). It can be verified that for each of those 8 strategies there is always at least one out of the four possible input pairs formula_71 which makes the strategy fail. For example, in the strategy where both players always answer 0, we have that Alice and Bob win in all cases except for when formula_72, so using this strategy their win probability is exactly 75%.

Now, consider the case of randomized classical strategies, where Alice and Bob have access to &quot;correlated&quot; random numbers. They can be produced by jointly flipping a coin several times before the game has started and Alice and Bob are still allowed to communicate. The output they give at each round is then a function of both Charlie&#x27;s message and the outcome of the corresponding coin flip. Such a strategy can be viewed as a probability distribution over deterministic strategies, and thus its success probability is a weighted sum over the success probabilities of the deterministic strategies. But since every deterministic strategy has a success probability of at most 75%, this weighted sum cannot exceed 75% either.

=== Optimal quantum strategy ===

Now, imagine that Alice and Bob share the two-qubit entangled state: formula_73, commonly referred to as an EPR pair. Alice and Bob will use this entangled pair in their strategy as described below. The optimality of this strategy then follows from Tsirelson&#x27;s bound.

Upon receiving the bit formula_60 from Charlie, Alice will measure her qubit in the basis formula_75, and then take the average. We analyze the case where formula_76 here:
In this case the winning response pairs are formula_77 and formula_78. On input formula_76, we know that Alice will measure in the basis formula_80, and Bob will measure in the basis formula_81. Then the probability that they both output 0 is the same as the probability that their measurements yield formula_82 respectively, so precisely formula_83. Similarly, the probability that they both output 1 is exactly formula_84. So the probability that either of these successful outcomes happens is formula_85.

In the case of the 3 other possible input pairs, essentially identical analysis shows that Alice and Bob will have the same win probability of formula_86, so overall the average win probability for a randomly chosen input is formula_85. Since formula_88, this is strictly better than what was possible in the classical case.

=== Modeling general quantum strategies ===

An arbitrary quantum strategy for the CHSH game can be modeled as a triple formula_89 where 
* formula_90 is a bipartite state for some formula_91,
* formula_92 and formula_93 are Alice&#x27;s observables each corresponding to receiving formula_94 from the referee, and
* formula_95 and formula_96 are Bob&#x27;s observables each corresponding to receiving formula_97 from the referee.
The optimal quantum strategy described above can be recast in this notation as follows: formula_98 is the EPR pair formula_99, the observable formula_100 (corresponding to Alice measuring in the formula_101 basis), the observable formula_102 (corresponding to Alice measuring in the formula_103 basis), where formula_104 and formula_105 are Pauli matrices. The observables formula_106 and formula_107 (corresponding to each of Bob&#x27;s choice of basis to measure in). 
We will denote the success probability of a strategy formula_108 in the CHSH game by formula_109, and we define the &quot;bias&quot; of the strategy formula_108 as formula_111, which is the difference between the winning and losing probabilities of formula_108.

In particular, we have 
formula_113
The bias of the quantum strategy described above is formula_114.

=== Tsirelson&#x27;s inequality and CHSH rigidity ===

Tsirelson&#x27;s inequality, discovered by Boris Tsirelson in 1980, states that for any quantum strategy formula_108 for the CHSH game, the bias formula_116. Equivalently, it states that success probability
formula_117
for any quantum strategy formula_108 for the CHSH game. In particular, this implies the optimality of the quantum strategy described above for the CHSH game.

Tsirelson&#x27;s inequality establishes that the maximum success probability of &quot;any&quot; quantum strategy is formula_85, and we saw that this maximum success probability is achieved by the quantum strategy described above. In fact, any quantum strategy that achieves this maximum success probability must be isomorphic (in a precise sense) to the canonical quantum strategy described above; this property is called the &quot;rigidity&quot; of the CHSH game, first attributed to Summers and Werner. More formally, we have the following result:

(\mathcal{S}) = \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exist isometries formula_120 and formula_121 where formula_122 are isomorphic to formula_123 such that letting formula_124 we have 
formula_125
where formula_126 denotes the EPR pair and formula_127 denotes some pure state, and 
formula_128}}

Informally, the above theorem states that given an arbitrary optimal strategy for the CHSH game, there exists a local change-of-basis (given by the isometries formula_129) for Alice and Bob such that their shared state formula_130 factors into the tensor of an EPR pair formula_131 and an additional auxiliary state formula_132. Furthermore, Alice and Bob&#x27;s observables formula_133 and formula_134 behave, up to unitary transformations, like the formula_105 and formula_104 observables on their respective qubits from the EPR pair. An &quot;approximate&quot; or &quot;quantitative&quot; version of CHSH rigidity was obtained by McKague, et al. who proved that if you have a quantum strategy formula_108 such that formula_138 for some formula_139, then there exist isometries under which the strategy formula_108 is formula_141-close to the canonical quantum strategy. Representation-theoretic proofs of approximate rigidity are also known.

=== Applications ===

Note that the CHSH game can be viewed as a &quot;test&quot; for quantum entanglement and quantum measurements, and that the rigidity of the CHSH game lets us test for a &quot;specific&quot; entanglement as well as &quot;specific&quot; quantum measurements. This in turn can be leveraged to test or even verify entire quantum computations—in particular, the rigidity of CHSH games has been harnessed to construct protocols for verifiable quantum delegation, certifiable randomness expansion, and device-independent cryptography.

<doc id="169286" wikidata="Q1380989" url="?curid=169286" title="Jimmy Wilde">
<text>William James Wilde (12 May 1892 – 10 March 1969) was a Welsh professional boxer who competed from 1911 to 1923. He simultaneously held the National Sporting Clubs British flyweight title and the World Flyweight championship from 1916 to 1923.

Often regarded as the greatest British fighter of all time, he was the first official world flyweight champion and was rated by American boxing writer Nat Fleischer, as well as many other professionals and fans including former boxer, trainer, manager, and promoter, Charley &quot;Broadway&quot; Rose, as &quot;the Greatest Flyweight Boxer Ever&quot;. Wilde earned various nicknames, such as &quot;The Mighty Atom&quot;, &quot;Ghost with the Hammer in His Hand&quot;, and &quot;The Tylorstown Terror&quot; due to his bludgeoning punching power. While reigning as the world&#x27;s greatest flyweight, Wilde would take on bantamweights and even featherweights, and knock them out.

== Early years ==
Jimmy Wilde&#x27;s birth certificate states that he was born in the Taff Bargoed Valley community of Pentwyn Deintyr) (now known as the Graig), Quakers Yard, Treharris, Wales, in the county borough of Merthyr Tydfil. His parents later moved to the village of Tylorstown in the Rhondda Valley when Wilde was around six years old. In the 1901 census eight year old William James Wilde, his parents and his three sisters were all recorded as speaking only Welsh. His father was a coal miner and Jimmy later worked in the pits himself, being small enough to crawl through gullies impassable to most of his colleagues. He started boxing at the age of 16 in fairground boxing booths, where crowds were amazed by his toughness and ability to knock down much larger opponents, most of whom were local men weighing around 200 lbs. In 1910, Wilde married his wife Elizabeth and was a father the same year. He left Tylorstown Colliery in 1913.

== Professional career ==
The record books often show that Wilde started boxing professionally in 1911, but it is widely assumed (and later confirmed by boxing analysts) that he had been fighting professionally for at least four years before that. His claim that he had at least 800 fights is probably greatly exaggerated, but it was certainly more than the 152 shown in Boxrec and elsewhere. His officially listed debut was on 26 December 1910, when he fought Les Williams to a no-decision in three rounds.

Managed by Teddy Lewis, (reserve captain of the local rugby club, Pontypridd RFC) Wilde went undefeated in 103 bouts, all of which were held in Britain, a remarkable achievement. In the middle of that streak, on 31 December 1912, he won the British 7 stone championship by beating Billy Padden by an eighteenth-round knockout in Glasgow. He finally lost his undefeated record when he challenged Tancy Lee for the vacant British and Europe Flyweight Championship on 15 January 1915 in London. Ignoring his handlers advice to postpone the fight because he was suffering from Influenza, a weakened Wilde was knocked out in the seventeenth round (of twenty).

In 1915, Wilde was hospitalized, requiring an operation for &quot;an internal complaint&quot;. After a sixteen-fight knockout streak, on 14 February 1916 he won the British flyweight title by beating Joe Symonds by a knockout in round twelve at the National Sporting Club in London. On 13 May, he had two fights on the same day at Woolwich barracks winning both by knockout, both fights combined lasted less than five rounds. On 26 June Wilde returned to the National Sporting Club to take his revenge on Tancy Lee with an eleventh-round knockout. On 18 December, Wilde became the first World Flyweight Champion when he defeated Young Zulu Kid of the United States, knocking him out in the eleventh round of their bout at the Holborn Stadium.

In late December 1916, after being rejected on two previous occasions due to an old leg problem from a colliery accident and for being underweight, Wilde was accepted into the British Army and while never seeing active service, became a physical training instructor at Aldershot.

In 1917, he retained the British title by beating George Clarke by a fourth round KO. He kept fighting and winning, and in 1919, he beat American bantamweight Joe Lynch who would later win the World bantamweight title.

Wilde travelled to the United States for a series of fights and on 6 December 1919, lost to &quot;Little&quot; Jackie Sharkey in a controversial ten-round newspaper decision. According to the &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot; (before a crowd close to 8,000 at the Auditorium in Milwaukee Wisconsin) Sharkey was considered to have won eight of the ten rounds according to the newspapermen at ringside. Sharkey&#x27;s blows were said to land more frequently and with greater force. Sharkey&#x27;s win was at least a minor upset as Wilde led in the early betting 2 to 1.
In 1920, Wilde went undefeated in 10 fights, but lost by a knockout in 17 rounds to former World Bantamweight Champion Pete Herman, who outweighed him by more than a stone (14 pounds), in 1921. The bout was originally scheduled as a title defence, but Herman had lost his championship to Lynch the month before. Herman easily regained the Bantamweight title from Lynch in July 1921, leading some to suspect that he had left the title behind with Lynch in America intentionally. That was the fight that marked his return to Britain after touring the United States all of 1920. 

American promoter Tex Rickard (who promoted the Philippine sensation Pancho Villa) lured Wilde out of retirement with a promise of a £15,000 payday which was, at that time, a fortune. On 18 June 1923 at the Polo Grounds in New York, Wilde was knocked out in the seventh round by his younger opponent. Villa became the Philippines&#x27; first ever world champion. Wilde announced his retirement before returning to England, confirming his decision on 1 January 1924.

In 1927, at the age of 35, Wilde was reportedly considering making a comeback, but after consulting a specialist in head trauma, never returned to competitive boxing. For a while he ran a successful Cinema and cafe in Cardiff.

== Retirement ==
Wilde published a ghost-written autobiography in 1938 entitled &quot;Fighting Was My Business.&quot; 

In the early 1930s Wilde&#x27;s son David had a short career in professional boxing without any great success. He gave up boxing to run a hairdressers in north London.

In the 1930s Wilde lived in Hocroft Court, Cricklewood, from where almost all of his boxing trophies and medals were stolen in a 1936 burglary. He became a boxing referee, including in 1936 refereeing every bout of a boxing tournament at the Hastings Pier Pavilion. and he wrote an incisive weekly boxing column in the &quot;News of the World&quot; for nigh on two decades. In December 1936 he was injured after being thrown from his car when it collided with a van near Hampstead and suffered severe concussion.

After the War Wilde lived in Cadoxton, Barry, South Wales. In 1960, Wilde suffered facial injuries after being mugged at a train station in Cardiff. His wife, Elizabeth, died in 1967, and two years later Wilde, who was suffering from Diabetes and Dementia died at Whitchurch Hospital. He was buried alongside his wife in Barry Cemetery.

== Awards and recognition ==
With the longest unbeaten streak in boxing history, he went 103 fights before his first loss. Wilde had a record of 139 wins, 3 losses, 1 draw and 5 no-contests, with an impressive 99 wins by knockout. Ring Magazine, named him both the 3rd greatest puncher of all time, and the greatest flyweight of all time, and rated him as the 13th greatest fighter of the 20th century.

In 1990, he was elected to the inaugural class of the International Boxing Hall of Fame and in 1992, the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame.

He was ranked as the top flyweight of all-time by the International Boxing Research Organization in 2006.

<doc id="169290" wikidata="Q289405" url="?curid=169290" title="The Vines (band)">
<text>The Vines are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1994. Their sound has been described as a musical hybrid of 1960s garage rock and 1990s alternative rock. The band has been through several line-up changes, with vocalist/guitarist Craig Nicholls serving as the sole constant throughout the band&#x27;s history.

The Vines&#x27; success in the Australian recording industry resulted in winning the ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Get Free&quot; and receiving five other nominations for their debut album &quot;Highly Evolved&quot;, plus two further nominations in subsequent years. In 2003, the album went platinum in Australia, and since then the band has released four albums and a best-of compilation from their time at Capitol Records. The Vines have released seven studio albums.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years (1994–2001) ===
In 1991, Craig Nicholls met Patrick Matthews while working at their local McDonald&#x27;s in the suburb of South Hurstville, New South Wales. Bonded over a shared love of rock music, they began playing together at Matthews&#x27; home, with Nicholls on guitar and vocals and Matthews on bass. They were later joined by Matthews&#x27; school friend David Olliffe on drums.

==== Band name ====
Originally called &quot;Rishikesh&quot;, a name suggested by Olliffe, which refers to the Indian city where the Beatles visited an ashram in 1968, they played a couple of small gigs in pubs. The local newspapers regularly misprinted the name as &quot;Rishi Chasms&quot;, so Nicholls suggested a new name, &quot;the Vines&quot;, as an homage to his father, who fronted a local band called the Vynes.

==== Early demo recordings and live shows ====
In October 1994, Patrick, Craig and David played their first gig as The Vines at an 18th birthday party at South Hurstville RSL Memorial Bowling Club. They covered songs by Nirvana, You Am I, and others. Back in the shed, meanwhile, the three had started developing their own sound on a four-track recorder, with Nicholls soon emerging as the band&#x27;s primary songwriter.

By late 1998, The Vines only played a handful of gigs over the course of six years. One of them was at The Iron Duke pub in Sydney. Supporting local band Starky, it was the first time they were called back onstage for an encore.

In April 1999, The Vines entered a studio for the first time to record their debut demos with high-school friend Glenn Santry as the engineer. In two quick sessions at A# Studios in Riverwood, they recorded six tracks, including early versions of &quot;In the Jungle&quot; and &quot;Winning Days&quot;.

==== Increased exposure and early releases ====
In 2000, the &quot;In the Jungle&quot; demo was played on FBi Radio Sydney, catching the ear of Ivy League Records&#x27; Andy Cassell. Ivy League&#x27;s management company Winterman and Goldstein soon signed The Vines and encouraged them to record further demos and play more shows.

In early 2001, The Vines embarked on their first national tour of Australia as supporting act for You Am I and Eskimo Joe. During their gigs, the band gave away 5-track demo CDs featuring early recordings of songs like &quot;Highly Evolved&quot; and &quot;Mary Jane&quot;. In the same year, their Australia debut single &quot;Hot Leather/Sunchild&quot; was released through independent label Illustrious Artists, run by Russell Hopkinson from You Am I.

Meanwhile, Rex Records put out what was to be their UK debut single, &quot;Factory&quot;, as a limited seven-inch single. The release became &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s Single of the Week in November 2001.

=== &quot;Highly Evolved&quot; (2001–2003) ===

By the beginning of 2001, The Vines had compiled a collection of songs. Winterman and Goldstein approached the Australian artist development company Engineroom with a 19-song demo tape. Impressed by their potential, Engineroom signed the band, funded the recording of more demos and negotiated deals with British and American labels, bypassing Australia.

American producer Rob Schnapf became impressed with The Vines after receiving a demo CD, leading him to express interest in collaborating with the band by sending an email filled with the phrase &quot;The Vines!&quot;. In July 2001, the band flew to Los Angeles, to begin recording their debut album, &quot;Highly Evolved&quot;, with Schnapf at Sunset Sound Studios. Running into money issues, the originally planned eight-week recording session extended to six months. Faced with pressure from the label, David Olliffe returned to Australia halfway through the recording, leading to the recruitment of session players such as Joey Waronker and Pete Thomas.

The band signed to Heavenly Records in the UK in December 2001 and EMI in Australia in April 2002. While mixing the record &quot;Highly Evolved&quot;, The Vines signed with Capitol Records.

In early 2002, The Vines embarked on a pre-release tour in the United Kingdom to promote their highly anticipated album, &quot;Highly Evolved&quot;. As they took to the stage, the band introduced a new drummer, Hamish Rosser, who replaced David Olliffe. Additionally, The Vines welcomed Ryan Griffiths, a longtime friend and schoolmate of Nicholls, as a second guitarist.

The first single off the album, &quot;Highly Evolved&quot;, earned them more critical acclaim as &quot;NME&quot; made it a Single of the Week in March 2002. The single charted in the UK at number 32 on the singles chart and on Australia&#x27;s ARIAnet top 100 singles chart.

&quot;Highly Evolved&quot; was released on July 14, 2002. It reached number 11 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 albums chart and sold 1.5 million copies throughout the world with distribution through Capitol Records. By end of 2003, the album went platinum in Australia.

In August, 2002, The band played high-profile slots on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and the MTV Video Music Awards. They won the ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Get Free&quot; in 2002, and were nominated for five other awards.

The Vines gained significant recognition in 2002, appearing on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in September 2002 with the words &quot;Rock is Back: Meet the Vines&quot; boldly emblazoned underneath. Referred to as the &#x27;The&#x27; bands, the Strokes, the Hives, the White Stripes, and the Vines combined &quot;old fashioned punk and adrenaline fuelled riffs&quot; to be ushered in at the beginning of 2002 as the &quot;saviors of rock&quot;.

In 2002, The Vines appeared three times on the cover of &quot;NME&quot; in June, July, and October, hailed as the future of rock &amp; roll. Their US debut single &quot;Get Free&quot; was listed as number 38 on NME&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest Singles of All Time.&quot;

===&quot;Winning Days (2004–2005)&quot;===
In May 2003, the band went into a studio in Woodstock, New York, with Rob Schnapf again on production. While Craig Nicholls had talked of having a highly produced album, he told the Australian edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in March 2004 that they decided to stick to a less-is-more philosophy. &quot;I wanted it to be – in my head – something grand, with big ideas and that vision sort of thing. But at the same time, that doesn&#x27;t mean that something can&#x27;t be special if it&#x27;s just simple. Because I think that the songs are the main thing&quot;.
Their second album, &quot;Winning Days&quot;, was released on 29 March 2004 and rose to number 23 in the US. &quot;Ride&quot; and &quot;Winning Days&quot; were released as singles in Australia (where they did not chart) and the UK.

=== &quot;Vision Valley&quot; (2006–2007) ===

In mid-2005, the group announced they were working on their third album, with producer Wayne Connolly. Andy Kent of fellow Australian band You Am I filled in on bass playing duties. In November of that year, the band&#x27;s management announced they had finished recording all the songs that would appear on the album.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Listen to the Radio&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single, and was made available for digital download on 7 March on iTunes. The song was used on the soundtrack for the video game &quot;FlatOut 2&quot;. &quot;Gross Out&quot; was made available for digital download on 18 March, and was the first song leaked from the album. &quot;Vision Valley&quot; was released on 1 April 2006 in Australia, 3 April in Europe, and 4 April in the United States.

&quot;Vision Valley&quot; consisted of short, immediate songs; the album running little over 30 minutes in length. &quot;Anysound&quot; was the second official single from the album, and an animated music video was released exclusively through YouTube. The song was included as a track heard on the in-game radio in the 2007 LucasArts published . &quot;Dope Train&quot; was released as a third single, with a music video composed of live footage of the band from Big Day Out in 2007.

On 19 July 2006, the Vines played a gig at the Annandale Hotel under the name &quot;Joe Dirt&quot;, with a new bassist, Brad Heald, after Patrick Matthews departed the group. Matthews had left in response to an outburst Nicholls had while the group played a promotional show for Triple M radio.

===&quot;Melodia&quot; (2007–2008)===

In 2007, the Vines signed to Ivy League Records for an Australian album deal. The first single preceding the album &quot;Melodia&quot; was &quot;He&#x27;s a Rocker&quot;, which was released through iTunes on 3 June 2008 along with two bonus tracks. &quot;MerryGoRound&quot; was released as a follow-up single for radio airplay in Australia during August 2008. &quot;MerryGoRound&quot; only received support and backing from Triple J radio. &quot;Get Out&quot; was released as the third single from &quot;Melodia&quot; in September 2008 for radio airplay, and a music video was released to coincide with the release of &quot;Get Out&quot; as a single by Ivy League Records on YouTube. &quot;Get Out&quot; was featured on the in-game soundtrack of &quot;Midnight Club: Los Angeles&quot; released in late October 2008 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 gaming platforms.

In October 2008, the Vines commenced a national Australian tour in support of &quot;Melodia&quot;, playing small venues throughout Australia. In November 2008, the Vines were announced as being part of the line-up for the 2009 Australian Big Day Out, but the band cancelled.

===&quot;Future Primitive&quot; (2009–2012)===

On 14 November 2009, the Vines played at the Annandale Hotel, under the alias of the Crimes. They had a support slot with You Am I, playing their back catalogue and a new song from an album due in 2011.

A music video for &quot;Gimme Love&quot; wrapped filming on 1 March 2011, with the completed video surfacing online through YouTube on 27 March. The music video pays homage to the 2010 film &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;.

Over a year after its completion, &quot;Future Primitive&quot; received an official release date through &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on 3 June 2011. Because the Vines did not have a label at the time of recording, the band members funded the album&#x27;s recording themselves. Upon the album&#x27;s completion, the band approached various record labels to see if any were interested in signing the band for its release, explaining the year-long delay between recording and release.

On 26 November 2011, rumours on the band&#x27;s Facebook page suggested that the band had &quot;pushed out&quot; two of its members. At the 2011 Homebake music festival, the Vines emerged on the main-stage as a three piece, consisting of Nicholls, Heald and drummer Murray Sheridan. The departure of both Griffiths and Rosser was confirmed by Channel V presenter Jane Gazzo, who wrote that the two had been &quot;sacked&quot; in a Twitter post.

Craig&#x27;s sister, Jess Nicholls, also confirmed their departure via the band&#x27;s official forum. &quot;If any of you were at Homebake yesterday, I&#x27;m sure you can agree the set was amazing and sounded better than ever,&quot; she wrote. &quot;The band has made a creative decision to revert back to a three piece, as they originally started. I know you will probably have a lot of questions but just wanted to say don&#x27;t fear, this is in no way the end of the Vines!!&quot; Nicholls, Heald and Sheridan performed again at Southbound music festival in Perth on 8 January 2012.

On 16 March 2012, Rosser announced that he had joined Australian rock band Wolfmother, as their new drummer, on the &quot;Faster Louder&quot; website. He also claimed that the band had &quot;broken up&quot;, although &quot;Craig [Nicholls] will always write great music in the future and he may choose to carry on under the Vines&#x27; name.&quot;

===&quot;Wicked Nature&quot; (2012–2015)===

Heald confirmed his departure from the band in 2012. A new line-up, consisting of Nicholls, drummer Lachlan West and bassist Tim John, entered the studio to record their sixth album on 20 August 2012 in Sydney&#x27;s 301 Studio and completed the mixing of the album at the end of 2012.

West revealed in a June 2013 interview with his other band, Something With Numbers, that two producers have worked on the forthcoming Vines release. Paul McKercher produced the first half of the record and Lachlan Mitchell, who also produced the latest Something With Numbers record, worked on the second half based upon West&#x27;s recommendation to Nicholls. The article also stated that the new Vines album was &quot;due for release in the latter half of this year (2013)&quot;. According to a June 2014 &quot;Faster Louder&quot; article, in addition to the anticipated sixth album, a seventh album was recorded with the new line-up.

At the beginning of July 2014, the Vines created a PledgeMusic page for their sixth record &quot;Wicked Nature&quot;, a double album which was released on 2 September 2014. The lead single &quot;Metal Zone&quot; was released on 14 July. Its music video premiered on Noisy on 11 July.

In spring of 2015, it was announced that Craig Nicholls started a side project called White Shadows, which focused on electronic music. A debut album for the project, titled &quot;Secret of Life&quot;, was later released that year. Its lead single, &quot;Give Up Give Out Give In&quot;, was released on 9 April 2015 with a music video produced. The album featured over 70 different guest musicians.

=== &quot;In Miracle Land&quot; and classic line-up reunion (2016–2018) ===

On 1 April 2016, The Vines released the single &quot;In Miracle Land&quot;. On 14 April 2016, Craig Nicholls performed a solo show at Sydney&#x27;s Newtown Social Club. The band supported the upcoming album with a brief &quot;In Miracle Land&quot; tour, playing three dates in October 2016.

In 2017, The Vines re-issued their debut album, &quot;Highly Evolved&quot;, in celebration of its 15th anniversary.

On 28 April 2018, Nicholls performed with The Killers in Sydney, joining them for &quot;When We Were Young&quot; and &quot;Get Free.&quot; In May 2018, the original line-up from 2002 to 2004 reunited for two shows at the Enmore and Metro Theatre. This marked Patrick Matthews&#x27; first performance with The Vines in 14 years and the first for Ryan Griffiths and Hamish Rosser in seven years. 

The album &quot;In Miracle Land&quot; was released on 29 June 2018, featuring the same line-up as their previous album &quot;Wicked Nature&quot;, with Tim John on bass and Lachlan West on drums.

=== Eighth Studio Album (2018–present) ===
On 30 March 2024, in a YouTube interview, Hamish Rosser confirmed his return to The Vines, mentioning that new music is in progress and awaiting finalization and release. Rosser mentioned Autumn Shade V as one of the new songs.

== Musical style ==
Ex-bassist Matthews believed that &quot;Winning Days&quot; was a step in a different direction for the band. &quot;The themes are more introspective and less wild rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot;. Their music also was described by Chart Attack as having &quot;neo-psychedelic arrangements&quot;.

== Reception ==
Upon the release of their debut album, the Vines were hailed as &quot;the second coming of Nirvana&quot; by the British press; their grungy sound was considered reminiscent of the Seattle scene and Nicholls&#x27; erratic on-stage behaviour and raw vocals drew comparisons between him and Kurt Cobain. &quot;Highly Evolved&quot; became a huge success and their accompanying live shows in the early years were praised as &quot;electrifying&quot; and &quot;sensational&quot;.

Critical reactions to 2004&#x27;s &quot;Winning Days&quot; were mixed. Pitchfork&#x27;s Chris Ott described it as being &quot;nothing more than boring and harmlessly vapid&quot; and showing &quot;only mild promise&quot;. Conversely, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27; David Fricke said it was &quot;a leap forward in style and frenzy&quot;.

In June 2021, Double J&#x27;s Al Newstead wrote an op-ed in support of the band. &quot;Their legacy isn&#x27;t clean cut,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but it&#x27;s still remarkable to see what The Vines achieved, and chiefly what Nicholls survived.&quot;

== Legacy ==
The Vines gained notoriety in the early 2000s as one of the leading bands of the garage rock revival scene. Their debut album &quot;Highly Evolved&quot; was named number two album of the year by &quot;NME&quot; and listed in &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot;″s 200 Greatest Australian Albums of All Time.

In 2002, The Vines became the first Australian musical act to be featured on the cover of US &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine since Men at Work in 1983; this helped revive international interest in the Australian music scene, which numerous artists have continued to benefit from in subsequent years.

The Vines are considered an influential group in the development of 2000s indie rock, with a number of bands and musicians citing them as an inspiration or influence. Alex Turner, frontman of Arctic Monkeys, credits The Vines as a major influence in Arctic Monkeys&#x27; early years, stating: &quot;One of the reasons we formed the band was because of the Vines&quot;. Turner also named Craig Nicholls&#x27; live performances as a powerful early inspiration and described The Vines as &quot;collectively our favorite band at the time.&quot; Kevin Parker of Tame Impala and his bandmates remarked that they were &quot;super massive fans&quot; and idolised The Vines and Craig Nicholls when they were younger. Wolf Alice cited The Vines as an early inspiration and named The Vines&#x27; second album &quot;Winning Days&quot; as one of the group&#x27;s most vital influences. While performing on stage in 2018, The Killers directly attributed The Vines with &quot;blowing open&quot; the doors for other indie bands like themselves to achieve mainstream success. Other artists who have cited The Vines as an influence include Violent Soho, British India and VANT.

<text>The Hives are a Swedish rock band formed in Fagersta in 1993. After gaining traction in Sweden through the 1990s, they rose to worldwide prominence in the early 2000s during the garage rock revival. The band&#x27;s line-upconsisting of Howlin&#x27; Pelle Almqvist (vocals), Nicholaus Arson (lead guitar, backing vocals), Vigilante Carlstroem (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Dr. Matt Destruction (bass), and Chris Dangerous (drums)remained unchanged from 1993 until 2013, when Matt Destruction retired for health reasons and was replaced by The Johan and Only, the former Randy bassist.

The Hives have released six studio albums: &quot;Barely Legal&quot; (1997), &quot;Veni Vidi Vicious&quot; (2000), &quot;Tyrannosaurus Hives&quot; (2004), &quot;The Black and White Album&quot; (2007), &quot;Lex Hives&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons&quot; (2023). They have also released the compilation album &quot;Your New Favourite Band&quot; (2001), the live DVD &quot;Tussles in Brussels&quot; (2005), and the live album &quot;Live at Third Man Records&quot; (2020). Their mainstream success came with the release of &quot;Veni Vidi Vicious&quot; and its single &quot;Hate to Say I Told You So&quot;, considered their signature song. They are known for always dressing in matching black-and-white tuxedos and for their energetic and eccentric live shows, with critics hailing them as one of the best live rock bands of the last two decades.

==History==
===Beginnings of the Hives (1993–1999)===
The Hives was formed in 1993 by brothers Per &quot;Pelle&quot; Almqvist (Howlin&#x27; Pelle Almqvist) and Niklas Almqvist (Nicholaus Arson) in Fagersta. Friends of the brothers, Mikael Karlsson (Vigilante Carlstroem), Mattias Bernvall (Dr. Matt Destruction) and Christian Grahn (Chris Dangerous), soon joined the band and took punk rock-inspired stage names like the brothers. Drummer Dangerous suggested the name &quot;Hives&quot; for the band as he had read the word for the skin disease in a dictionary. The other members misunderstood the condition based on his description of it, as Howlin&#x27; Pelle later explained, &quot;we thought it was a way more lethal disease, for one, and we thought it was way more contagious. So, we figured that we’d spread like a deadly disease across the land&quot;. The band went by the name Hives for some time before they realized that &quot;all good band names are plurals&quot;, and added a &#x27;the&#x27; to their name.

The band&#x27;s first recording was a 1994 demo titled &quot;Sounds Like Sushi&quot;. In 1995, the band signed with Burning Heart Records, a Swedish independent record label. The following year they released their debut EP &quot;Oh Lord! When? How?&quot; In 1997, the band released their debut studio album, &quot;Barely Legal,&quot; and embarked on a tour in support of it. The &quot;Barely Legal&quot; track &quot;The Stomp&quot; was later featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;RocknRolla&quot;. The band&#x27;s early releases would be marked by the influence of such bands as Rancid, New Bomb Turks, Turbonegro, and Dead Kennedys.

In 1998, the band released their second EP, &quot;A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T&quot;. Burning Heart signed a deal with Epitaph Records to distribute the band&#x27;s material in the United States during that same year.

===&quot;Veni Vidi Vicious&quot; and &quot;Your New Favourite Band&quot; (2000–2002)===
The Hives released their second studio album, &quot;Veni Vidi Vicious,&quot; in April 2000 through Burning Heart Records. The band members described the album as being like &quot;a velvet glove with brass knuckles, both brutal and sophisticated at the same time&quot;. The album yielded the singles &quot;Hate to Say I Told You So&quot;, &quot;Main Offender&quot;, &quot;Die, All Right!&quot;, and &quot;Supply and Demand&quot;. The album track &quot;The Hives – Introduce the Metric System in Time&quot; was included on the punk rock compilation album &quot;Punk-O-Rama Volume 5&quot; from Epitaph later that year. &quot;Hate To Say I Told You So&quot; was later included on the soundtrack for &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, and also featured in the video game Forza Horizon . The track &quot;Main Offender&quot; was featured in the video game &quot;Rock Band&quot; while &quot;Die, All Right!&quot; was released as downloadable content in the game&#x27;s digital music store.

After seeing the video for &quot;Hate to Say I Told You So&quot; on German television, industry executive Alan McGee decided to sign the band to his newly formed Poptones label. Poptones released the &#x27;best of&#x27; compilation &quot;Your New Favourite Band&quot; in 2001, which proved to be the band&#x27;s breakthrough record, reaching number seven on the UK album charts. Following the success of the album, the band re-released the singles &quot;Hate to Say I Told You So&quot; and &quot;Main Offender&quot;, which reached number 23 and 24 respectively on the UK Singles chart. The band also re-released &quot;Veni Vidi Vicious&quot; in the US.

During the promotion of &quot;Veni Vidi Vicious&quot; and &quot;Your New Favourite Band&quot;, the Hives signed a record deal with Universal Music, reportedly worth $10 million. The signing was a result of Epitaph selling the rights to the band&#x27;s material in the US to Warner Bros. Records without informing the members beforehand. A dispute followed between the Hives and the labels, who claimed that the band were still contracted for one more album, in which a lawsuit was filed against the band and settled out of court.

===&quot;Tyrannosaurus Hives&quot; (2003–2006)===
After extensive touring and winning awards for &quot;Best International Band&quot; and &quot;Best Dressed Band&quot; at the NME awards in 2003, the band retreated to Fagersta to record their third album.&quot;Tyrannosaurus Hives&quot; was released in 2004 and included the singles &quot;Walk Idiot Walk&quot;, which debuted at number 13 on the UK singles charts, &quot;Two-Timing Touch and Broken Bones&quot;, a top 50 hit, and &quot;A Little More for Little You&quot;. The tracks &quot;B is for Brutus&quot; and &quot;Uptight&quot; were featured in the video game &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot;, while &quot;No Pun Intended&quot; was featured in the video games &quot;SSX on Tour&quot; and .

In 2005, the band won five Swedish Grammis awards in the categories &quot;Artist of the Year&quot;, &quot;Rock Group of the Year&quot;, &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;Producer of the Year&quot; (with collaborator, Pelle Gunnerfeldt), while the video for &quot;Walk Idiot Walk&quot; won the MTV &quot;Best Music Video&quot; award.

===&quot;The Black and White Album&quot; (2007–2011)===

The Hives announced their new album in August 2007 along with the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Tick Tick Boom&quot;. &quot;The Black and White Album&quot; was released on 15 October in the UK and on 13 November in the US. It was mostly recorded in Oxford, Mississippi, Miami, and Sweden. The bonus track &quot;Fall Is Just Something Grownups Invented&quot; was used as the theme for Cartoon Network&#x27;s fall season while the band performed in commercials featuring the song.

&quot;Return The Favour&quot; was featured in a Nike commercial, while &quot;Tick Tick Boom&quot; was used in the films &quot;Jumper&quot;, &quot;Taken&quot;, &quot;MacGruber&quot;, and &quot;Get Smart&quot;, as the theme song for WWE Survivor Series 2007, in advertisements for the 2007 season of the NFL Network and Finish Line, and included in the video games &quot;Lego: Rock Band&quot;, Madden NFL 07, Madden NFL 11 and &quot;.&quot; The track &quot;Try It Again&quot; was later used in the trailer for the film &quot;Get Him to the Greek&quot;. In 2008, specific songs from the band&#x27;s catalog was remixed and compiled into a track titled &quot;Black, White and Run&quot; for the Nike+ Original Run series.

In January 2008, the band received the &quot;Best Live Act&quot; award at the Swedish Grammis and performed at the 2008 NHL All-Star Game in Atlanta, performing &quot;Tick Tick Boom&quot; during the players&#x27; presentation. In July 2010, the band released an EP titled &quot;Tarred and Feathered&quot;, which consisted of the cover songs &quot;Civilization&#x27;s Dying&quot; by Zero Boys, &quot;Nasty Secretary&quot; by Joy Rider &amp; Avis Davis and &quot;Early Morning Wake Up Call&quot; by Flash and the Pan. &quot;Nasty Secretary&quot; was later included on the video game &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot;&#x27;s soundtrack. In January 2011, guitarist Arson wrote a short diary entry on the band&#x27;s website stating that they had recorded some new songs before Christmas, and were planning to continue recording throughout month.

===&quot;Lex Hives&quot; and Destruction&#x27;s departure (2012–2023)===

In March 2012, the band announced their fifth studio album, &quot;Lex Hives&quot;, and released the first single from the album &quot;Go Right Ahead&quot;. The song was performed live during an appearance at the Norwegian-Swedish talk show &quot;Skavlan&quot; on 30 March. After a run of live shows in California and two weekend shows at Coachella, the band performed on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on 23 April.

&quot;Lex Hives&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s own label, Disque Hives, in June and included twelve self-produced tracks, with a deluxe version containing two bonus tracks produced by Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme. The album track &quot;Come On!&quot; was used as the theme for Xbox One&#x27;s &quot;Invitation&quot; commercials, and featured in an episode of &quot;Workaholics&quot; and the documentary &quot;The Crash Reel&quot;, while the song &quot;1000 Answers,&quot; was included on the soundtrack of the video game &quot;FIFA 12&quot;.

Due to health reasons, Dr. Matt Destruction left the band in late 2013 and was replaced by Randy bassist Johan Gustafsson, who took the stage name The Johan and Only. On 13 February 2015, the band released the stand-alone single &quot;Blood Red Moon&quot;. The band&#x27;s activity became limited between 2015 and 2019, with appearances largely reduced to occasional festival appearances. These included Riot Fest, Rock am Ring, Lollapalooza Paris and Download Festival.
In May 2019, the band released the single &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; and followed it up with another single titled &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; a month later. The band toured the US in 2019 alongside fellow Swedish band Refused, with the run of dates dubbed the Scream Team Tour. Drummer Dangerous took a hiatus from the band during this period in order to recover from surgery and was replaced on the tour by former Queens of the Stone Age drummer Joey Castillo. While on tour, the Hives recorded their first live album, &quot;Live at Third Man Records&quot;, which was later released on 25 September 2020.

After being unable to tour in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band created a virtual world tour in January 2021 titled the World&#x27;s First World Wide Web World Tour which saw them perform live-streamed sets at country-specific times, with &quot;shows&quot; in Berlin, London, New York City, Sydney, São Paulo and Stockholm. The band returned to real-life touring later in 2021, serving as the opener on The Offspring&#x27;s UK and European tour dates.

===&quot;The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons&quot; (2023–present)===

In January 2023, the band shared a series of photos in which Howlin&#x27; Pelle held up protest signs on Hollywood Boulevard that read &quot;The Hives Must Album Now!&quot; and &quot;Honk If You Want a New The Hives Album&quot;. A new series of merch was also shared, featuring both the former slogan and one that read &quot;The Hives! Make Records or Go Home!&quot; A second set of photos was shared in early February, with Almqvist now holding a sign that read &quot;Where Is the New The Hives Album&quot;. The campaign continued with photos of Arson, Carlstroem and Dangerous &quot;joining the protest&quot; and wearing the new merch.

In May 2023, the band confirmed that their sixth studio album, &quot;The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons&quot;, would be released on 11 August 2023. The band also shared the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Bogus Operandi&quot;, marking their first new release in four years. That same month, the band began a tour of the UK and Ireland in support of Arctic Monkeys. A second single from the album, &quot;Countdown to Shutdown&quot;, followed in June 2023. Its music video featured a cameo from the band&#x27;s former bassist Dr. Matt Destruction, who played an office worker. Prior to the release of the album, the Hives released a further three singles: &quot;Rigor Mortis Radio&quot;, &quot;Trapdoor Solution&quot;, and &quot;The Bomb&quot;. The Hives later embarked on a global tour in support of the album throughout Europe and America that concludes in 2024.

==Collaborations==
In 2006, Almqvist collaborated with Swedish rock artist Moneybrother on a cover of the Operation Ivy song &quot;Freeze Up&quot; for his cover album &quot;Pengabrorsan&quot;. The duo replaced the song&#x27;s original lyrics with Swedish lyrics and retitled it to &quot;Jag Skriver Inte På Nåt&quot; (Swedish for &quot;I Won&#x27;t Sign Anything&quot;). The Hives collaborated with hip-hop producer Timbaland on the track &quot;Throw It On Me&quot; from his 2007 album &quot;Shock Value&quot;. The band also featured in the track&#x27;s music video. During that same year, Howlin&#x27; Pelle posted in the online diary on the band&#x27;s website that he had recorded footsteps with Jack White for the Raconteurs new album.

In 2008, the Hives contributed to the tracks &quot;Time For Some Action&quot; and &quot;Windows&quot; from N.E.R.D.&#x27;s album &quot;Seeing Sounds&quot;, with Almqvist providing guest vocals on the former. The members are credited by their real names on the album instead of the pseudonyms they use within the band. Later that year, the band recorded a Christmas duet entitled &quot;A Christmas Duel&quot; with Cyndi Lauper, which was available as a free download from their website on 28 November.

In 2018, the Almqvist brothers gifted the song &quot;Let the Punishment Fit the Behind&quot; to the Norwegian rock band Turbonegro for their album &quot;RockNRoll Machine&quot;. Howlin&#x27; Pelle performed the song live with the band during their concert in Stockholm on 9 March. In 2019, the singer contributed backing vocals to the track &quot;Turn the Cross&quot; from Swedish punk band Refused&#x27;s album &quot;War Music&quot;.

==Style and onstage performance==

All songwriting except covers on the band&#x27;s albums are credited to &quot;Randy Fitzsimmons&quot;. The band claims Fitzsimmons was an honorary &quot;sixth Hive&quot;, who along with writing their music, discovered and managed the band. The band has included hidden references to a sixth member of the band, including a hidden sixth pair of legs on the back cover of the &quot;Tyrannosaurus Hives&quot; album art. &quot;Randy Fitzsimmons&quot; is a registered pseudonym for guitarist Niklas Almqvist.

The Hives are renowned for their energetic and highly rated live shows, with &quot;Spin&quot; ranking them number eight on their list of best live bands in 2006 and frontman Howlin&#x27; Pelle receiving particular praise for his showmanship. When asked about their efforts to connect with the audience, drummer Dangerous replied that &quot;there are so many bands out there that don&#x27;t say a word to the crowd. I don&#x27;t get it. They don&#x27;t even look at the audience and that&#x27;s ridiculous&quot;. In 2023, Howlin&#x27; Pelle commented on the effects of their live shows saying &quot;we give so much energy and then it kind of bounces right back. So on one hand your body gets tired but your soul feels better and better. So it’s not just tiring, like it also gives you a lot of energy&quot;. The Hives always dress in matching black-and-white tuxedos because &quot;it makes [them] look like [they] belong together&quot;.
