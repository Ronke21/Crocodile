<text>Fanny Mendelssohn (14 November 1805 – 14 May 1847) was a German composer and pianist of the early Romantic era who was known as Fanny Hensel after her marriage. Her compositions include a string quartet, a piano trio, a piano quartet, an orchestral overture, four cantatas, more than 125 pieces for the piano and over 250 lieder, most of which were unpublished in her lifetime. Although lauded for her piano technique, she rarely gave public performances outside her family circle.

She grew up in Berlin and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, as well as the composers Ludwig Berger and Carl Friedrich Zelter. Her younger brother Felix Mendelssohn, also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Owing to her family&#x27;s reservations and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, six of her songs were published under her brother&#x27;s name in his Opus 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married artist Wilhelm Hensel and, in 1830, they had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. She died of a stroke in 1847, aged 41.

Since the 1990s, her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. Her &quot;Easter Sonata&quot; was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before new analysis of documents in 2010 corrected the attribution. The Fanny &amp; Felix Mendelssohn Museum opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Fanny Mendelssohn was born in Hamburg, the oldest of four children, including her brother Felix Mendelssohn born four years after her. She was descended on both sides from distinguished Jewish families; her parents were Abraham Mendelssohn (who was the son of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn), and Lea Salomon, a granddaughter of the entrepreneur Daniel Itzig. She was baptised as a Christian in 1816, becoming Fanny Cäcilie Mendelssohn Bartholdy. Despite this, she and her family continued an affinity with the social and moral values of Judaism. Like her brother Felix, she objected strongly when their father Abraham changed the family surname to &quot;Mendelssohn Bartholdy&quot; with the intention of playing down their Jewish origins: she wrote to Felix of &quot;Bartholdy, that name which we all dislike.&quot;

While growing up in the family&#x27;s new home in Berlin, Mendelssohn showed prodigious musical ability and began to write music. She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who may have learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of Johann Kirnberger, a student of Johann Sebastian Bach. Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father&#x27;s birthday in 1819. Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models represented by her great-aunts Fanny von Arnstein and Sarah Levy, both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known salon and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.

After studying briefly with the pianist Marie Bigot in Paris, Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from Ludwig Berger and composition instruction from Carl Friedrich Zelter. At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, &quot;He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.&quot; Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819. In October 1820, they joined the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, which was then being led by Zelter. Much later, in an 1831 letter to Goethe, Zelter described Fanny&#x27;s skill as a pianist with the highest praise for a woman at the time: &quot;... she plays like a man.&quot; Visitors to the Mendelssohn household in the early 1820s, including Ignaz Moscheles and Sir George Smart, were equally impressed by both siblings.

===Gender and class limitations===
The music historian Richard Taruskin suggested that &quot;the life of Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel is compelling proof that women&#x27;s failure to &quot;compete&quot; with men on the compositional playing-field has been the result of social prejudice and patriarchical mores (which in the nineteenth century granted only men the right to make the decisions in bourgeois households).&quot; Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn&#x27;s father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, &quot;Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix&#x27;s] profession, while for it can and must be only an ornament&quot;. Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:
From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.

The music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn &quot;struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status ...; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.&quot; Felix&#x27;s friend Henry Chorley wrote of Fanny: &quot;Had Madame Hensel been a poor man&#x27;s daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of Madame Schumann and Madame Pleyel as a female pianist of the highest class&quot;, suggesting that as well as her sex, her social class was limiting for her career.

The biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny&#x27;s son Sebastian Hensel has been construed by the musicologist Marian Wilson Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere. Kimber notes that Fanny&#x27;s &quot;oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.&quot;

===Felix and Fanny===
The siblings&#x27; bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny&#x27;s works were often played alongside her brother&#x27;s at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organized by her father and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself. In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote &quot;Up to the present moment I possess his [Felix&#x27;s] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.&quot;

In 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name, three in his Op. 8 collection and three more in his Op. 9. In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when Queen Victoria, receiving Felix at Buckingham Palace, expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, &quot;Italien&quot; (to words by Franz Grillparzer), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.

There was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully. Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her &quot;Minerva&quot; after the Roman goddess of wisdom. Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the Nibelungenlied (which never materialized): Fanny wrote &quot;The hunt with Siegfried&#x27;s death provides a splendid finale to the second act.&quot;

=== Marriage and later life===
In 1829, after a courtship of several years (they had first met in 1821 when she was 16), Fanny married the artist Wilhelm Hensel, and the following year gave birth to their only child, Sebastian Hensel. She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837.

In 1830 came her first public notice as a composer, when John Thomson, who had met her in Berlin the previous year, wrote in the London journal &quot;The Harmonicon&quot; in praise of a number of her songs that had been shown to him by Felix. Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd) came in 1838, when she played her brother&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1.

Fanny&#x27;s support of Felix&#x27;s music was clearly demonstrated during the 1838 rehearsals in Berlin for her brother&#x27;s oratorio &quot;St. Paul&quot; at the Singverein, which she attended at the invitation of its conductor, Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen. In a letter to her brother she described attending the rehearsals and &quot;suffering and champing at the bit ... as I heard the whining and [the accompanist&#x27;s] dirty fingers on the piano ... They started [the passage] &#x27;mache dich auf&#x27; at half the right tempo, and then I instinctively called out, &#x27;My God, it must go twice as fast!&#x27;&quot; The consequence was that Rungenhagen consulted her closely about all details of the rehearsals and performance; this included her firm instructions not to add a tuba to the organ part. &quot;I assured them that they should be ruled by my word, and they&#x27;d better do it for God&#x27;s sake.&quot;
Wilhelm Hensel, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny&#x27;s composing, but unlike many others of her circle was also in favour of her seeking publication of her works. The music historian Nancy B. Reich has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence. One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839–40. This was her first visit to Southern Europe and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the Prix de Rome (one was the young Charles Gounod) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin music enthusiast Robert von Keudell: in her diary she wrote: &quot;Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected ... He has always given me the very best counsel.&quot;

In 1846, after an approach by two Berlin publishers and without consulting Felix, she decided to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1), under her married name, &quot;Fanny Hensel geb. [i.e. née] Mendelssohn-Bartholdy&quot;. After publication, Felix wrote to her &quot;[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft ... may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.&quot; (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal &quot;Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.&quot; She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: &quot;I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me ... If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won&#x27;t grieve, for I&#x27;m not ambitious.&quot;

Throughout March 1847 Fanny had many meetings with Clara Schumann. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.

===Death===
On 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother&#x27;s cantatas, &quot;The First Walpurgis Night&quot;. Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses), but not before completing his String Quartet No. 6 in F minor, written in memory of his sister. Fanny was buried next to her parents in a portion of the Dreifaltigkeit Cemetery in Berlin reserved for Jewish converts to Christianity (&quot;Neuchristen&quot;).

==Compositions==
Fanny Mendelssohn composed over 450 pieces of music. Her compositions include a string quartet, a piano trio, a piano quartet, an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and in excess of 250 lieder (art songs). Six of her songs were originally published under Felix&#x27;s name in his Opus 8 and 9 collections. Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name &quot;Lied für Klavier (Song for Piano)&quot;, analogous to Felix&#x27;s &quot;Lieder ohne Worte (Songs Without Words)&quot;. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829–30, with a second set (Op. 30) appearing in 1833–34. Fanny&#x27;s sets of &quot;Lieder für Klavier&quot; were written in the period 1836–1837, at about the same time as Felix&#x27;s set Op. 38.

The majority of Fanny Mendelssohn&#x27;s compositions are limited to lieder and piano pieces as she felt her abilities did not extend to larger, more intricate compositions. She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works. After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, &quot;I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.&quot; She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a piano quartet in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a piano trio (Op. 11). Her &quot;Easter Sonata&quot; written in 1828, was unpublished in her lifetime. It was discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.
Most of Hensel&#x27;s work after her marriage was on a small scale, songs and piano pieces. In 1831 for the first birthday of her son Sebastian, she created a cantata, the &quot;Lobgesang &quot; (Song of Praise). Two other works for orchestra, soloists and choir were written in that year, &quot;Hiob&quot; (Job) and an oratorio in sixteen sections, &quot;Höret zu, merket auf&quot; (Listen and take note). In 1841 she composed a cycle of piano pieces depicting the months of the year, &quot;Das Jahr&quot; (The Year). The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband, with each piece accompanied by a short poem. The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with others suggesting they represent her own life. In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing &quot;Das Jahr&quot;:I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary. But do not imagine that I give these names when playing them in society, they are for home use entirely.
After &quot;Das Jahr&quot; her only large-scale work was her Piano Trio Op. 11 of 1847.

===Style and form===

Angela Mace, the musicologist who proved Fanny Hensel&#x27;s authorship of the &quot;Easter Sonata&quot;, considers that Fanny was much more experimental with her lieder than Felix, noting that her works have a &quot;harmonic density&quot; that serves to express emotion.

R. Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix&#x27;s music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of Ludwig van Beethoven in terms of form, tonality and fugal counterpoint. This is apparent for example in Fanny&#x27;s string quartet.

The musicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Hensel&#x27;s music has left the presence of triple hypermeter in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms. He also points to a lack of tonic harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied &quot;Verlust&quot; (&quot;Loss&quot;) as a deliberate means to reflect the song&#x27;s themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn&#x27;s use of word painting is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text. She commonly used strophic form for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger. Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to through-composed forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.

==Legacy==

From the 1980s onwards there has been renewed interest in Mendelssohn and her works. In November 2017, the Mendelssohn-Haus museum in Leipzig inaugurated a permanent exhibit dedicated to her. The Fanny &amp; Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of the two siblings, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg.

Minor planet is named after her.

On 14 November 2021, Google commemorated Fanny Hensel&#x27;s 216th birthday with a Google Doodle in North America, Iceland, Germany, Greece, Ukraine, Israel, Armenia, Australia and New Zealand.

===Music===
Six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout much of her life. He collected many of her works intending to release them to the public through his publisher, Breitkopf &amp; Härtel. In 1850, the publisher began to distribute Fanny Mendelssohn&#x27;s unreleased works, starting with &quot;Vier Lieder&quot; Op. 8. Commencing in the late 1980s, Fanny Mendelssohn&#x27;s music has become better known, thanks to concert performances and new recordings. Her &quot;Easter Sonata&quot; for piano, formerly attributed to Felix, was premiered in her name by Andrea Lam on 12 September 2012.

===Writings===
Fanny Mendelssohn published no writings during her lifetime. Selected letters and journal entries were published during the 19th century, notably by Sebastian Hensel in his book on the Mendelssohn family. Her collected letters to Felix, edited by Marcia Citron, were published in 1987.

===Biographical and musicological studies===
During the 19th century Fanny mainly figured as a bystander in biographies and studies of her brother Felix; typically she was a representative of a supposed &#x27;feminizing&#x27; influence that sapped his artistry. In the 20th century the conventional narrative switched to presenting Felix as disapproving of his sister&#x27;s musical activities and seeking to contain them, whilst the &#x27;feminizing&#x27; accusation against Fanny evaporated. From the 1980s onwards Fanny Mendelssohn has been the subject of many academic books and articles. Kimber opines that &quot;The tale of Fanny, the &#x27;suppressed&#x27; composer, has so readily found a place in the biographies of the siblings because of its resemblance to prevailing models for the life of a &#x27;Great Composer&#x27; ... based in Romantic ideology about male artists. ... Hensel fits neatly into a traditional narrative of the suffering artistic genius ... with a modern twist: the feminine gender of its main character. Thus two characters [Felix and Fanny] are forced to bear the weight of two centuries of gender ideology.&quot;

A catalogue of the works of Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel has been prepared by Renate Hellwig-Unruh in 2000, according to which each work may be referred to by its &quot;H-U number&quot;.

Sheila Hayman, the great-great-great-granddaughter of Fanny Mendelssohn, released the 97-minutes documentary &quot;Fanny: The Other Mendelssohn&quot; in 2023.

<doc id="174724" wikidata="Q353411" url="?curid=174724" title="Goro Shimura">
<text>was a Japanese mathematician and Michael Henry Strater Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Princeton University who worked in number theory, automorphic forms, and arithmetic geometry. He was known for developing the theory of complex multiplication of abelian varieties and Shimura varieties, as well as posing the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture which ultimately led to the proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

==Biography==
Gorō Shimura was born in Hamamatsu, Japan, on 23 February 1930. Shimura graduated with a B.A. in mathematics and a D.Sc. in mathematics from the University of Tokyo in 1952 and 1958, respectively.

After graduating, Shimura became a lecturer at the University of Tokyo, then worked abroad — including ten months in Paris and a seven-month stint at Princeton&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Study — before returning to Tokyo, where he married Chikako Ishiguro. He then moved from Tokyo to join the faculty of Osaka University, but growing unhappy with his funding situation, he decided to seek employment in the United States. Through André Weil he obtained a position at Princeton University. Shimura joined the Princeton faculty in 1964 and retired in 1999, during which time he advised over 28 doctoral students and received the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1970, the Cole Prize for number theory in 1977, the Asahi Prize in 1991, and the Steele Prize for lifetime achievement in 1996.

Shimura described his approach to mathematics as &quot;phenomenological&quot;: his interest was in finding new types of interesting behavior in the theory of automorphic forms. He also argued for a &quot;romantic&quot; approach, something he found lacking in the younger generation of mathematicians. Shimura used a two-part process for research, using one desk in his home dedicated to working on new research in the mornings and a second desk for perfecting papers in the afternoon.

Shimura had two children, Tomoko and Haru, with his wife Chikako. Shimura died on 3 May 2019 in Princeton, New Jersey at the age of 89.

==Research==
Shimura was a colleague and a friend of Yutaka Taniyama, with whom he wrote the first book on the complex multiplication of abelian varieties and formulated the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture. Shimura then wrote a long series of major papers, extending the phenomena found in the theory of complex multiplication of elliptic curves and the theory of modular forms to higher dimensions (e.g. Shimura varieties). This work provided examples for which the equivalence between motivic and automorphic &quot;L&quot;-functions postulated in the Langlands program could be tested: automorphic forms realized in the cohomology of a Shimura variety have a construction that attaches Galois representations to them.

In 1958, Shimura generalized the initial work of Martin Eichler on the Eichler–Shimura congruence relation between the local &quot;L&quot;-function of a modular curve and the eigenvalues of Hecke operators. In 1959, Shimura extended the work of Eichler on the Eichler–Shimura isomorphism between Eichler cohomology groups and spaces of cusp forms which would be used in Pierre Deligne&#x27;s proof of the Weil conjectures.

In 1971, Shimura&#x27;s work on explicit class field theory in the spirit of Kronecker&#x27;s Jugendtraum resulted in his proof of Shimura&#x27;s reciprocity law. In 1973, Shimura established the Shimura correspondence between modular forms of half integral weight &quot;k&quot;+1/2, and modular forms of even weight 2&quot;k&quot;.

Shimura&#x27;s formulation of the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (later known as the modularity theorem) in the 1950s played a key role in the proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1995. In 1990, Kenneth Ribet proved Ribet&#x27;s theorem which demonstrated that Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem followed from the semistable case of this conjecture. Shimura dryly commented that his first reaction on hearing of Andrew Wiles&#x27;s proof of the semistable case was &#x27;I told you so&#x27;.

==Other interests==
His hobbies were shogi problems of extreme length and collecting Imari porcelain. &quot;The Story of Imari: The Symbols and Mysteries of Antique Japanese Porcelain&quot; is a non-fiction work about the Imari porcelain that he collected over 30 years that was published by Ten Speed Press in 2008.

<text>Post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin: &#x27;after this, therefore because of this&#x27;) is an informal fallacy that states &quot;Since event Y &quot;followed&quot; event X, event Y must have been &quot;caused&quot; by event X.&quot; It is a fallacy in which an event is presumed to have been caused by a closely preceding event merely on the grounds of temporal succession. This type of reasoning is fallacious because mere temporal succession does not establish a causal connection. It is often shortened simply to post hoc fallacy. A logical fallacy of the questionable cause variety, it is subtly different from the fallacy &quot;cum hoc ergo propter hoc&quot; (&#x27;with this, therefore because of this&#x27;), in which two events occur simultaneously or the chronological ordering is insignificant or unknown. Post hoc is a logical fallacy in which one event seems to be the cause of a later event because it occurred earlier.

&quot;Post hoc&quot; is a particularly tempting error because correlation sometimes appears to suggest causality. The fallacy lies in a conclusion based &quot;solely&quot; on the order of events, rather than taking into account other factors potentially responsible for the result that might rule out the connection.

A simple example is &quot;The rooster crows immediately before sunrise; therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise.&quot;

== Pattern ==
The form of the &quot;post hoc fallacy&quot; is expressed as follows:
:* A occurred, then B occurred.
:* Therefore, A caused B.

When B is undesirable, this pattern is often combined with the formal fallacy of denying the antecedent, assuming the logical inverse holds: believing that avoiding A will prevent B.

== Examples ==
* A tenant moves into an apartment and the building&#x27;s furnace develops a fault. The manager blames the tenant&#x27;s arrival for the malfunction. One event merely followed the other, in the absence of causality.
* Brazilian footballer Pelé blamed a dip in his playing performance on having given a fan a specific playing shirt. His play recovered after receiving from a friend what he was told was the shirt in question, despite it actually being the same shirt he&#x27;d worn during his poor performance.
* Reporting of coincidental vaccine adverse events, where people have a health complaint after being vaccinated and assume it was caused by the vaccination.

<doc id="174737" wikidata="Q76574" url="?curid=174737" title="Maypole">
<text>A maypole is a tall wooden pole erected as a part of various European folk festivals, around which a maypole dance often takes place.

The festivals may occur on 1 May or Pentecost (Whitsun), although in some countries it is instead erected during Midsummer (20–26 June). In some cases, the maypole is a permanent feature that is only utilized during the festival, although in other cases it is erected specifically for the purpose before being taken down again.

Primarily found within the nations of Germanic Europe and the neighboring areas which they have influenced, its origins remain unknown. It has often been speculated that the maypole originally had some importance in the Germanic paganism of Iron Age and early Medieval cultures and that the tradition survived Christianisation, albeit losing any original meaning that it had. It has been a recorded practice in many parts of Europe throughout the Medieval and Early Modern periods, although it became less popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, the tradition is still observed in some parts of Europe and among European communities in the Americas.

==Symbolism==

English historian Ronald Hutton concurs with Swedish scholar Carl Wilhelm von Sydow who stated that maypoles were erected &quot;simply&quot; as &quot;signs that the happy season of warmth and comfort had returned.&quot; Their shape allowed for garlands to be hung from them and were first seen, at least in the British Isles, between AD 1350 and 1400 within the context of medieval Christian European culture. In 1588, at Holy Trinity Church in Exeter, villagers gathered around the &#x27;summer rod&#x27; for feasting and drinking. Chaucer mentions that a particularly large maypole stood at St Andrew Undershaft, which was collectively erected by church parishioners annually due to its large shape.

The symbolism of the maypole has been continuously debated by folklorists for centuries, although no definitive answer has been found. Some scholars classify maypoles as symbols of the world axis (axis mundi). The fact that they were found primarily in areas of Germanic Europe, where, prior to Christianisation, Germanic paganism was followed in various forms, has led to speculation by some that the maypoles were in some way a relic of a Germanic pagan tradition. One theory holds that they were a remnant of the Germanic reverence for sacred trees, as there is evidence for various sacred trees and wooden pillars that were venerated by the pagans across much of Germanic Europe, including Thor&#x27;s Oak and the Irminsul. Ronald Hutton, however, states that &quot;there is absolutely no evidence that the maypole was regarded as a reflection of it.&quot; It is also known that, in Norse paganism, cosmological views held that the universe was a world tree, known as Yggdrasil.

Some observers have proposed phallic symbolism, an idea which was expressed by Thomas Hobbes, who erroneously believed that the poles dated back to the Roman worship of the god Priapus. This notion has been supported by various figures since, including the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Phallic symbolism has been attributed to the maypole in the later Early Modern period, as one sexual reference is in John Cleland&#x27;s controversial novel &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;:

... and now, disengaged from the shirt, I saw, with wonder and surprise, what? not the plaything of a boy, not the weapon of a man, but a maypole of so enormous a standard, that had have proportions been observed, it must have belonged to a young giant.

Ronald Hutton has stated, however, that &quot;there is no historical basis for his claim and no sign that the people who used maypoles thought that they were phallic&quot; and that &quot;they were not carved to appear so.&quot;

The anthropologist Mircea Eliade theorizes that the maypoles were simply a part of the general rejoicing at the return of summer, and the growth of new vegetation. In this way, they bore similarities with the May Day garlands which were also a common festival practice in Britain and Ireland.

==Regional traditions==

===Europe===

====Belgium====
In Belgium, the Maypole is called or in Dutch. Hasselt erects its on 30 April. In Brussels and Leuven, the is traditionally erected on 9 August before 5 p.m.

The planting of the in Brussels is reminiscent of a long-standing (folkloric) feud with Leuven, dating back to 1213. In that year, a brawl broke out between the two cities, which saw the former victorious. To commemorate this event, Brussels was granted, almost 100 years later, the eternal right by John II, Duke of Brabant, to erect a , but only if they managed to do this every year on 9 August before 5 p.m. Following a &quot;theft&quot; of the tree in 1974, Leuven has also claimed ownership of the only official Meyboom. Ever since, the two cities have been involved in a friendly rivalry to decide who has the &quot;real&quot; Meyboom.

It is also customary, mostly in the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium, to place a branch (also called a ) on the highest point of a building under construction. The erection of the branch is often cause for celebration by both the workmen and the neighbors.

====Germany and Austria====

In Germany and Austria, the maypole (or ) is a tradition going back to the 16th century. It is a decorated tree or tree trunk that is usually erected either on 1 May – in Baden and Swabia – or on the evening before, for example, in East Frisia. In most areas, especially in Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, and Austria, it is usual to have a ceremony to erect the maypole on the village green. The custom of combining it with a village or town fete, which usually takes place on 1  May or April 30 at Pentecost (Whitsun), is widespread. This tradition is especially strong in the villages of the Bavarian Alps where the raising of the traditional maypole on 1 May in the village square is a cause for much celebration. Some poles are painted in the Bavarian colors of white and blue; most are decorated with emblems depicting local crafts and industry. In Bavaria, the is procured, prepared and then stored in some building, such as a farmer&#x27;s barn days or weeks before being erected on 1 May. The young men (nowadays probably women, too) from the villages try to steal the from each other (out of the storage places) which is why the people of the village take turns in watching over it. If a village manages to steal a , then the village the has been stolen from has to invite the whole village of the thieves to free beer and a festivity to get it back.

Just before the is erected, depending on the region, there may be a procession through the village, usually ending at a central place and/or restaurant and usually watched by crowds of spectators and accompanied by a brass band. The actual installation of the tree then takes place in the afternoon or evening. The maypole is traditionally set up with the help of long poles, today it may sometimes also be done using tractors, forklifts, or even cranes. In Lower Austria ropes and ladders are used.

If the communal tree is erected already on the eve of 1 May, then the event is usually followed by a May dance or . Depending on local custom, the may remain in place all year round or may be taken down at the end of May. The trunk may then be stored until the following year.

From the Rhineland in and around Cologne originates a somewhat different, private, maytree tradition. During the night before 1 May, traditionally unmarried men, but nowadays persons of any gender, erect cut young birch trees, complete with their spring green foliage, often decorated with multicoloured satin (sometimes crepe paper) streamers, in front of the house of their sweetheart. (Sometimes, but rarely, additionally with a (heartshaped) sign bearing the name of the adored person. Normally the person who &quot;is meant&quot; (and neighbours etc.) is/are left to just guess/speculate about the identity of the involved.) These individual may trees can be spotted in other regions of the country, too, and even in urban environments where people sometimes have to get quite creative in finding a spot and way to fix them somewhere (as opposed to easier, traditional places with garden soil to just &quot;plant&quot; (stick) it in or fence posts to bind it to).

====Hungary====

In Hungary the common term is Májusfa. They were danced around and usually decorated with a full bottle of wine, with &quot;hímestojás&quot;, flowers and ribbons. May Poles and similar decorated branches, collectively called &quot;Zöld ágak&quot; were believed to have magical properties. All of them were often put up as an ornament to bring good luck and protect against witches&#x27; spells, since it was generally believed by the Hungarians that they can be protected against with different types of weed and herbs.

The base was a tall tree stripped of its bark, with the foliage left only at the top (usually 12-15 meters), but it could also be a smaller tree or a large, flowering, greenish branch. They also tried to personalise the trees, decorating them with small gifts, combs, mirrors but also thorny branches and rags, reflecting negative qualities.

Often it was only in front of the priest and judge&#x27;s house that a tall May Pole was erected, but every girl had to have at least one branch. Usually each suitor would put one in the girl&#x27;s garden. Often they would carve it out and write the boy&#x27;s name on it. The cutting and wood delivery had to be done in secret, under the cover of night, so that the lady in question would not suspect anything. When the family saw the boys, if the girl liked the suitor, they invited them in to dinner and proudly left the tree in the garden.

In the morning, they compared who got the longer May Pole, and tried to guess who gave it to them and often, which envious lover has plucked the tree. Unlike other May Poles, in Hungary it was the length of the tree that mattered, which would ultimately convince the girls to go out with the men. This was a common form of rural flirting, similar to the Hajnalfa. 

The lovers were always assisted by a (often drunken) courting team of similar boys. If two boys liked the same girl, after one team had erected the maypole, the other would secretly take it away and dig his own in its place. 

On the last Sunday of May &quot;májusfa-kitáncolás,&quot; when they tore the pole down, while dancing one last time. The máj-kerék was placed on it that day, a wagon wheel on the end of a high pole, decorated with ribbons, wine bottles and linen scarves. Its placement was a metaphor for the fulfilment of a love affair. If the kitáncolás didn&#x27;t happen that meant, the boy has abandoned his courtship. The ornaments of the wheel were raced to be taken down by the men climbing up the pole. Often, however, they would play tricks on each other by putting water with paprika in a bottle on top of the tree instead of wine. The winner was declared the King of Pentecost, the Judge Stag or the First Stag. During the demolition, young people dressed merely in green branches collected a &quot;ransom&quot;, all around the village. 

In addition to the love May Poles, there were also community May Poles in front of churches and pubs, around which they had fun until the evening.

====Italy====

Maypole traditions can be found in some parts of Italy, such as in Veneto, Friuli, Umbria, and Marche. In the last of these regions, the tradition dates back to the Napoleonic campaigns, when the (Liberty tree), the symbol of the French Revolution, arrived in Italy. Liberty trees were erected in the southern part of the region in Ripatransone and Ascoli Piceno. In 1889, the first congress of the Second International, met in Paris for the centennial of the French Revolution and the Exposition Universelle. A proposal by Raymond Lavigne called for international demonstrations on the 1890 anniversary of the Chicago protests. After the institution of the International Workers&#x27; Day the maypole rite in the southern part of the March became a socialist ritual. At the top of the tree (poplar) appeared the red flag. In the second half of the 20th century, the rite of the maypole around Ascoli remained a rite of celebration of spring but it became also a political symbol of the peasant movement () that struggled against the landowners to have decent living conditions. Every year, even today, on the night of 30 April, in many villages of the zone like Appignano del Tronto, Arquata del Tronto, Ascoli Piceno, Castorano, Castignano, Castel di Lama, Colli del Tronto, Grottammare, Monsampolo del Tronto, Porchia (Montalto Marche), Monteprandone, Offida, Rotella, Spinetoli, San Benedetto del Tronto, citizens cut a poplar on which they put-up a red flag and the tree is erected in village squares or at crossroads.

The same ritual is known from Lamon, a village in the Dolomites in Veneto, which likely predates the Napoleonic period. Here, a number of quarters and hamlets erect a maypole in the form of a larch whose branches and bark are almost completely removed. Only the top branches are left. A red flag is normally attached, although Italian flags or flags of other countries (Colombia, Bolivia for example) or artists (Bob Marley) are also attested. Around the maypole, quarters and hamlets give feasts with music, food, and alcohol which usually last until the dawn of 1 May. The Maypole is locally called &#x27;Majo&#x27; (May in the local dialect).

====Malta====
Grand Master Marc&#x27;Antonio Zondadari introduced the game of cockaigne (with the use of the maypole) to Maltese Carnival in 1721: on a given signal, the crowd assembled in Palace Square and converged on a collection of hams, sausages and live animals hidden beneath leafy branches outside the Main Guard. The provisions became the property of those who, having seized them, were able to carry them off.

====Nordic countries====


In Denmark, the maypole tradition is almost extinct but is still observed on the islands of Avernakø and Strynø south of Funen and in a few villages in southern Himmerland in eastern Jutland. The Maypole is generally referred to as a , meaning &quot;May tree&quot;.

In Sweden and Swedish-speaking parts of Finland, the maypole is usually called a midsummer pole, (), as it appears at the Midsummer celebrations, although the literal translation also occurs, where the word refers to the Old Swedish word which means &quot;dress&quot;, and not the month of May. The traditions surrounding the maypoles vary locally, as does the design of the poles, although the design featuring a cross and two rings is most common nowadays. A perhaps more original incarnation is the one still in use in the Swedish landscape of Småland, where the pole carries a large horizontally suspended ring around it, hanging from ropes attached at the top of the pole. This perhaps more original form of course strongly reinforces the procreation symbolism. The cross-arm may be a latter-day attempt to Christianize the pagan symbol into the semblance of a cross, although not completely successful. Common in all of Sweden are traditional ring dances, mostly in the form of dances where participants alternate dancing and making movements and gestures based on the songs, such as pretending to scrub laundry while singing about washing, or jumping as frogs during the song (&quot;The little frogs&quot;). Ring dancing is mostly popular with small children. The central part played by young children in the celebration emphasizes the procreation aspect of the celebration. Yet another pointer in this direction is the custom that young maidens expect to dream of their future mate if they pick seven different flowers and place them under their pillow when they go to bed on this day only.

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom, the maypole was found primarily in England and in areas of the Scottish Lowlands and Wales which were under English influence. However, the earliest recorded evidence comes from a Welsh poem written by Gryffydd ap Adda ap Dafydd in the mid-14th century, in which he described how people used a tall birch pole at Llanidloes, central Wales. Literary evidence for maypole use across much of Britain increases in later decades, and &quot;by the period 1350–1400 the custom was well established across southern Britain, in town and country and in both Welsh-speaking and English-speaking areas.&quot;

The practice became increasingly popular throughout the ensuing centuries, with the maypoles becoming &quot;communal symbols&quot; that brought the local community together – in some cases, poorer parishes would join up with neighboring ones in order to obtain and erect one, whilst in other cases, such as in Hertfordshire in 1602 and Warwickshire in 1639, people stole the poles of neighboring communities, leading to violence. In some cases the wood for the pole was obtained illegally, for instance in 1603, the earl of Huntingdon was angered when trees were removed from his estates for use as maypoles without his permission.

The rise of Protestantism in the 16th century led to increasing disapproval of maypoles and other May Day practices from various Protestants who viewed them as idolatry and therefore immoral. Under the reign of Edward VI in England and Wales, Protestant Anglicanism was declared to be the state religion, and under the Reformation many maypoles, such as the famous Cornhill maypole of London, were destroyed; however when Mary I ascended the throne after Edward&#x27;s death, she reinstated Roman Catholicism as the state faith, and the practice of maypoles was reinstated. Under later English monarchs, the practice was sporadic, being banned in certain areas, such as Doncaster, Canterbury, and Bristol, but continuing in many others, according to the wishes of the local governors. In Scotland meanwhile, which at this time was still an independent state, Protestantism, in the form of Presbyterianism, had taken a more powerful hold, and largely wiped out the practice of maypoles across the country.

Royal support contributed to the outlawing of maypole displays and dancing during the English Interregnum. The Long Parliament&#x27;s ordinance of 1644 described maypoles as &quot;a Heathenish vanity, generally abused to superstition and wickedness.&quot; The only recorded breach of the Long Parliament&#x27;s prohibition was in 1655 in Henley-in-Arden, where local officials stopped the erection of maypoles for traditional games. Scholars suspect but have no way to prove, that the lack of such records indicates official connivance in the flouting of the prohibition. However, they are certain that the prohibition turned maypole dancing into a symbol of resistance to the Long Parliament and to the republic that followed it.

The church of St Andrew Undershaft in the City of London is named after the maypole that was kept under its eaves and set up each spring until 1517 when student riots put an end to the custom. The maypole itself survived until 1547 when a Puritan mob seized and destroyed it as a &quot;pagan idol&quot;.

When the Restoration occurred in 1660, common people in London, in particular, put up maypoles &quot;at every crossway&quot;, according to John Aubrey. The largest was the Maypole in the Strand, near the current St Mary-le-Strand church. The maypole there was the tallest by far, reaching over , and it stood until being blown over by a high wind in 1672 when it was moved to Wanstead in Essex and served as a mount for the telescope of Sir Isaac Newton.

In the countryside, may dances and maypoles appeared sporadically even during the Interregnum, but the practice was revived substantially after the Restoration. By the 19th century, the maypole had been subsumed into the symbology of &quot;Merry England&quot;. The addition of intertwining ribbons seems to have been influenced by a combination of 19th-century theatrical fashion and visionary individuals such as John Ruskin in the 19th century. However, the maypole remained an anti-religious symbol to some theologians, as shown by &quot;The Two Babylons&quot;, an anti-Catholic conspiracist pamphlet that first appeared in 1853.

As revived, the dance is performed by pairs of boys and girls (or men and women) who stand alternately around the base of the pole, each holding the end of a ribbon. They weave in and around each other, boys going one way and girls going the other and the ribbons are woven together around the pole until they meet at the base. There are also more complex dances for set numbers of (practiced) dancers (the May Queen dancing troupes) involving complicated weaves and unweaves, but they are not well known today. However, such dances are performed every Mayday around the permanent Maypole at Offenham, in Worcestershire. Temporary Maypoles are usually erected on village greens and events are often supervised by local Morris dancing groups.

In some regions, a somewhat different Maypole tradition existed: the carrying of highly decorated sticks. The sticks had hoops or cross-sticks or swags attached, covered with flowers, greenery, or artificial materials such as crepe paper. Children would take these hand-held poles to school on May Day morning and prizes may be awarded for the most impressive. This tradition is known as garlanding and was a central feature of Mayday celebrations in central and southern England until the mid-19th century. After that time, it began to be replaced by formally organized school-centered celebrations. It still occurs from place to place but is invariably a reinstatement of a local custom that had lapsed decades earlier.

In 1780, Kilmarnock Council, now in East Ayrshire, paid Robert Fraser 2s. 6d. for &quot;dressing a Maypole&quot;, one of the last recorded examples of the rural festival of the first of May in Scotland, having been put down by Act of Parliament immediately after the Reformation in 1560.

The tallest maypoles in Britain may be found in the villages of Nun Monkton, North Yorkshire (), Barwick-in-Elmet, West Yorkshire (), Welford-on-Avon, Warwickshire () and Paganhill, Gloucestershire (18 metres or 60 feet; although a taller, post-WWI &#x27;Memorial Pole&#x27; of 29.5 m or 97 ft was previously erected in 1919, making it one of the tallest on record).

Holywood in County Down, Northern Ireland has a maypole situated at the crossroads of Main Street and Shore Road/Church Road in the center of the town. It is the only Maypole in Ireland. Although the origin is uncertain, it is thought that the original maypole dates from the 18th century, when a Dutch ship ran aground offshore. The latest maypole was damaged and removed after a storm in February 2021. The remains were removed by Ards and North Down Borough Council and a replacement pole was ordered.

===America===

====Canada====
In Canada, maypole dances are sometimes done as part of Victoria Day celebrations which occur in May. In New Westminster, British Columbia, dancing around the maypole and May Day celebrations have been held for 149 years.

====United States====

While not celebrated among the general public in the United States today, a Maypole dance nearly identical to that celebrated in the United Kingdom is an important part of May Day celebrations in local schools and communities. Often the Maypole dance will be accompanied by other dances as part of a presentation to the public.

The earliest use of the Maypole in America occurred in 1628, when William Bradford, governor of New Plymouth, wrote of an incident where a number of servants, together with the aid of an agent, broke free from their indentured service to create their own colony, setting up a maypole in the center of the settlement, and behaving in such a way as to receive the scorn and disapproval of the nearby colonies, as well as an officer of the king, bearing patent for the state of Massachusetts. Bradford writes:
They also set up a May-pole, drinking and dancing about it many days together, inviting the Indian women, for their consorts, dancing and frisking together, (like so many fairies, or furies rather,) and worse practices. As if they had a new revived &amp; celebrated the feasts of the Roman Goddess Flora, or the beastly practices of the madd Bacchinalians. Morton likewise (to shew his poetry) composed sundry rimes &amp; verses, some tending to lasciviousness, and others to the detraction &amp; scandal of some persons, which he affixed to this idle or idol May-pole. They changed also the name of their place, and instead of calling it Mount Wollaston, they call it Merie-mounted, as if this jollity would have lasted ever. But this continued not long, for after Morton was sent for England, shortly after came over that worthy gentleman, Mr. John Indecott, who brought a patent under the broad seal, for the government of Massachusetts, who visiting those parts caused the May-pole to be cutt downe, and rebuked them for their profanes, and admonished them to look there should be better walking; so they now, or others, changed the name of their place again, and called it Mount-Dagon.
Governor Bradford&#x27;s censure of the Maypole tradition played a central role in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s fictional story &quot;The Maypole of Merry Mount&quot;, published in 1837.

New York City&#x27;s Central park also has a rich history of the Maypole, particularly in the early 20th century. Photographs from the early to mid 1900s depict children participating in Maypole dances, which suggest that dances and tradition like these were integral to the park at that time. This scene can also be shown in artwork during this time. For example, artist Maurice Prendergast capture this tradition in his watercolor painting &quot;May Day, Central Park.&quot; The painting depicts children dancing around the Maypole. But by the mid-20th century the May Day celebration in central park has declined and the focus of the May Day has shifted towards a political demonstrations and labor right strikes, particularly during the 1930 to current day. On Mayday (May 1st), workers from different backgrounds and occupation all gathered to protest for workers rights. This is an annual tradition In new York city that hundred of worker participate in as they marched from Washington square park to Foley Square. 

== Educational and Cultural Preservation Efforts ==
In Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, Maypole dancing is featured during spring events to teach children and tourists about European settlers&#x27; customs. Centers such as the North House Folk School (Minnesota) host classes on Maypole construction, dance choreography, and its historical significance.

Cornland School in Chesapeake transformed the old schoolhouse structure to be a historic museum, into an African American history museum. The museum&#x27;s opening was marked by a Maypole celebration, a traditional festivity symbolizing community unity and cultural heritage. This event highlighted the museum&#x27;s dedication to preserving and celebrating African American history and traditions.

== Pagan and Wiccan Traditions ==
In Modern Paganism and Wicca, Maypole are central to Beltane Celebrations (April 30th- May 1st). Contemporary Wiccan and Pagan communities still continues to celebrate the Maypole as a central part of their Beltane celebration as it symbolizes fertility, unity, and the energy of spring. It is a significant celebration in the community as it marks the midpoint between the spring equinox and the summer solstice. It symbolizes the fertility of the land the blossoming of life. And participants dance around the May Pole to symbolize the intertwining between masculine and feminine energy.

Many modern Pagan communities organize public Beltane events featuring Maypole dances, bonfires, and feasting. These gatherings provide an opportunity for communal celebration, education, and the preservation of Pagan traditions.

In Wiccan traditions, the Maypole is often viewed as a phallic symbol, representing the God, while the ribbons and the circular dance represent the Goddess. The weaving of ribbons signifies the union of these divine aspects, embodying fertility and the creative forces of nature. This ritual not only honors deities but also serves as a communal activity that strengthens bonds among participants.

==In literature==
Poet Jonathan Swift in his poem &quot;A Maypole&quot; describes a maypole as:

&quot;The May-Pole of Merry Mount&quot; is a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It first appeared in &quot;The Token and Atlantic Souvenir&quot; in 1836. The story revolves around a young couple feeling the influence of nature who get betrothed in the presence of a Maypole and face Puritan ire. Hawthorne based his story on events in colonial New England history, borrowing from a story of Thomas Mortan whose settlement opposed the rigid cultural and religious standards of the Plymouth colony Puritans.

== In Film ==
The Maypole is depicted in films like &quot;Midsommar&quot; (2019), which sparked cultural discussions about European folk traditions and their symbolism. Despite the film&#x27;s dark tone, it renewed mainstream interest in Maypole dancing and folk rituals. In this horror film, the Maypole is central to the plot, with a significant scene depicting a traditional Maypole dance set to the Swedish folk song &quot;Hårgalåten.&quot; When producing and writing the script for this film, they film makers took a lot of their inspirations from their trip to Sweden, and incorporated a lot of the culture into the film. For example, Ari Aster, The filmmaker, stated how a lot of the props they used, like the mallet used, were replicas based on real life items they saw in the country or in museums. He states that &quot;This is not Swedish history, this is folklore, when he spoke about a lot of the horror aspects of the film when they depict the cult like actions from the locals. Like the self suicides, which were filmed on historical sites in Sweden.

&quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973) is British horror film features a notable scene where villagers perform a Maypole dance, singing &quot;The Maypole Song,&quot; which underscores the film&#x27;s exploration of pagan rituals.

==In art==
The maypole has also been featured in various cultural depictions, including magazine covers. For instance, the May 1, 1923, cover of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, illustrated by Rockwell Kent, showcases a couple dancing around a maypole at a carnival. Similarly, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; has featured maypole imagery on its covers. The May 3, 1941, issue, with artwork by Ilonka Karasz, depicts a floral maypole scene, reflecting the seasonal celebration.

<text>Camille Jordan (11 January 1771 in Lyon – 19 May 1821) was a French politician born in Lyon of a well-to-do mercantile family.

Jordan was educated in Lyon, and from an early age was imbued with royalist principles. He actively supported by voice, pen, and musket his native town in its resistance to the Convention, and when Lyon fell, in October 1793, Jordan fled. From Switzerland he passed in six months to England, where he formed acquaintances with other French exiles and with prominent British statesmen, and imbibed a lasting admiration for the English Constitution.

In 1796 he returned to France, and next year he was sent by Lyon as a deputy to the Council of the Five Hundred. There, his eloquence won him consideration. He earnestly supported what he felt to be true freedom, especially in matters of religious worship, though the energetic appeal on behalf of church bells in his &quot;Rapport sur la liberté des cultes&quot; procured him the sobriquet of &quot;Jordan-Cloche&quot;. Proscribed at the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of the 18th Fructidor (4 September 1797), he escaped to Basel. Thence he went to Germany, where he met Goethe.

Back again in France by 1800, he boldly published in 1802 his &quot;Vrai sens du vote national pour le consulat à vie&quot;, in which he exposed the ambitious schemes of Bonaparte. He was unmolested, however, and during the First Empire lived in literary retirement at Lyon with his wife and family, producing for the Lyon academy occasional papers on the &quot;Influence réciproque de l&#x27;éloquence sur la Révolution et de la Révolution sur l&#x27;éloquence&quot;; &quot;Etudes sur Klopstock&quot;, etc.

At the restoration in 1814, he again emerged into public life. By Louis XVIII he was ennobled and named a councillor of state; and from 1816 he sat in the chamber of deputies as representative of Am. At first, he supported the ministry, but when they began to show signs of reaction, he separated from them, and gradually came to be at the head of the constitutional opposition. His speeches in the chamber were always eloquent and powerful. Though warned by failing health to resign, Camille Jordan remained at his post till his death at Paris, on 19 May 1821.

To his pen we owe (1791); (1792); (1792); (I797); (1818); (1818). His were collected in 1818. The &quot;,&quot; and translations from the German, were published in . Besides the histories of the time, see further details vol. x. of the ; a paper on Jordan and Madame de Staël, by Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, in the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot; for March 1868 and R Boubbe, &quot;&quot;Camille Jordan à Weimar&quot;,&quot; in the &quot;Correspondance&quot; (1901), ccv. 718–738 and 948–970.

<text>High/Low is the debut studio album by the American band Nada Surf, released in 1996. It contains the hit single &quot;Popular&quot;. &quot;High/Low&quot; was produced by Ric Ocasek. Nada Surf supported it by touring with Superdrag and the Gravel Pit.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; noted that &quot;there&#x27;s an almost elegant austerity to the album&#x27;s sound, but what ultimately brings the songs into focus is the band&#x27;s ultra-efficient playing, which is so sparing you&#x27;d think the recording studio charged them by the note.&quot; &quot;The Ottawa Citizen&quot; concluded that Nada Surf &quot;may have been moulded by a superior studio presence, but the root of their sound, guitar-driven and heavy on the backbeat, speaks of an energy that was harnessed and focused, not manufactured.&quot;

<text>The American Eskimo Dog is a breed of companion dog, originating in Germany. The American Eskimo Dog is a member of the Spitz family. The breed&#x27;s progenitors were German Spitz, but due to anti-German sentiment during the First World War, it was renamed &quot;American Eskimo Dog.&quot; Although modern American Eskimo Dogs have been exported as German Spitz Gross (or Mittel, depending on the dog&#x27;s height), the breeds have diverged and the standards are significantly different. In addition to serving as a watchdog and companion, the American Eskimo Dog also achieved a high degree of popularity in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s as a circus performer.

There are three size varieties of the American Eskimo Dog breed, the toy, the miniature and the standard. They share a common resemblance with Japanese Spitz, Danish Spitz, Volpino Italiano, German Spitz, Indian Spitz, and Samoyeds.

==History==
In Northern Europe, smaller Spitz were eventually developed into the various German Spitz breeds. European immigrants brought their Spitz pets with them to the United States, especially New York, in the early 1900s, &quot;all of them descended from the larger German Spitz, the Keeshond, the white Pomeranian, and the Italian Spitz, the Volpino Italiano.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark/Brace&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Although white was not always a recognized color in the various German Spitz breeds, it was generally the preferred color in the US. In a display of patriotism in the era around World War I, dog owners began referring to their pets as American Spitz rather than German Spitz.

After World War I, the small Spitz dogs came to the attention of the American public when the dogs became popular entertainers in the American circus. In 1917, the Cooper Brothers’ Railroad Circus featured the dogs. A dog named Stout&#x27;s Pal Pierre was famous for walking a tightrope with the Barnum and Bailey Circus in the 1930s, and also contributing to their popularity, they sold puppies after the show. Due to the popularity of the circus dogs, many of today&#x27;s American Eskimo Dogs can trace their lineage back to these circus dogs.

After World War II, the dogs continued to be popular pets. Postwar contact with Japan led to importation into the United States of the Japanese Spitz, which may have been crossed into the breed at this time. The breed was first officially recognized as the &quot;American Eskimo&quot; as early as 1919 by the American United Kennel Club (UKC), and the first written record and history of the breed was printed in 1958 by the UKC. At that time there was no official breed club and no breed standard, and dogs were accepted for registration as single dogs, based on appearance. In 1970 the National American Eskimo Dog Association (NAEDA) was founded, and single dog registrations ceased. In 1985 the American Eskimo Dog Club of America (AEDCA) was formed by fanciers who wished to register the breed with the American Kennel Club (AKC). Following the AKC&#x27;s requirements for breed recognition, the AEDCA collected the pedigree information from 1,750 dogs that now form the basis of the AKC recognized breed, which is called the American Eskimo Dog. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1995. The stud book was opened from 2000 to 2003 in an attempt to register more of the original UKC registered lines, and today many American Eskimo Dogs are dual-registered with both American kennel clubs. The breed was recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club in 2006.
==Characteristics==
American Eskimo Dogs are usually white, though white and biscuit is also accepted by the AKC. They are double-coated, with thick straight fur and a ruff around the neck and shoulders. The tail is heavily furred and generally curls over their back.

=== Size ===
American Eskimo Dogs are small to medium dogs, and come in three size varieties:

* Toy: 9–12 inches and 5–10 lbs / 22–30 cm and 2.27–4.5 kg
* Miniature: 12–15 inches and 10–20 lbs / 30–40 cm and 4.5–9 kg
* Standard: 15–20 inches and 15–40 lbs / 38–50 cm and 6.8–18 kg

<text>Charles François Marie, Comte de Rémusat (, 13 March 1797 – 6 June 1875), was a French politician and writer.

==Biography==
He was born in Paris. His father, Auguste Laurent, Comte de Rémusat, whose family came from Toulouse, was chamberlain to Napoleon Bonaparte, but acquiesced in the restoration and became prefect first of Haute Garonne, and then of Nord. Charles&#x27; mother was Claire Élisabeth Jeanne Gravier de Vergennes, Madame de Rémusat.

He developed political views more liberal than those of his parents, and having been brought up for a career in law, he published in 1820 a pamphlet on trial by jury. He was an active journalist, showing in philosophy and literature the influence of Victor Cousin, and is said to have furnished to no small extent the original of Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s character, Henri de Marsay . He signed the journalists&#x27; protest against the Ordinances of July 1830, and in the following October was elected deputy for Haute Garonne.

Becoming a Doctrinaire, he supported most of those measures of restriction on popular liberty which made the July monarchy unpopular with French Radicals. In 1836 he became for a short time undersecretary of state for the interior. He then became an ally of Adolphe Thiers, and in 1840 held the ministry of the interior for a brief period. In the same year he became an Academician. For the rest of Louis Philippe&#x27;s reign he was in opposition until he joined Thiers in his attempt at a ministry in the spring of 1848. During this time Rémusat constantly spoke in the chair here, but was still more active in literature, especially on philosophical subjects, the most remarkable of his works being his book on Pierre Abélard (2 vols., 1845). He had to leave France after the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;; nor did he re-enter political life during the Second Empire until 1869, when he founded a moderate opposition journal at Toulouse. Neither the Revolution of 1848 nor the Second Empire was to
his taste. Eventually he gave up hope for the restoration of constitutional monarchy in France and he declared himself in favor of the Third French Republic: &quot;I have never desired anything else than the peaceful triumph of the great principles of the French Revolution. I hoped that the monarchy would bring it forth; today I put my hopes in the Republic, firmly maintained and wisely organized.&quot;

In 1871 he refused the Vienna embassy offered him by Thiers, but in August he was appointed minister of foreign affairs in succession to Jules Favre. Although minister he was not a deputy, and on standing for Paris in September 1873 he was beaten by Désiré Barodet. A month later he was elected (having already resigned with Thiers) for Haute Garonne by a great majority. He died in Paris.

During his abstention from politics Rémusat continued to write on philosophical history, especially English. &quot;Saint Anselme de Cantorbéry&quot; appeared in 1854; &quot;L&#x27;Angleterre au ... son temps&quot;, etc., in 1858; &quot;John Wesley&quot; in 1870; &quot;Lord Herbert de Cherbury&quot; in 1874; &quot;Histoire de la philosophie en Angleterre depuis Bacon jusqu&#x27;à Locke&quot; in 1875; besides other and minor works. He wrote well, was a forcible speaker and an acute critic; but his adoption of the indeterminate eclecticism of Victor Cousin in philosophy and of the somewhat similarly indeterminate liberalism of Thiers in politics probably limited his powers, though both no doubt accorded with his critical and unenthusiastic turn of mind. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1873.

<doc id="174754" wikidata="Q476959" url="?curid=174754" title="Teiji Takagi">
<text>Teiji Takagi (高木 貞治 &quot;Takagi Teiji&quot;, April 21, 1875 – February 28, 1960) was a Japanese mathematician, best known for proving the Takagi existence theorem in class field theory. The Blancmange curve, the graph of a nowhere-differentiable but uniformly continuous function, is also called the Takagi curve after his work on it.

== Biography ==
He was born in the rural area of the Gifu Prefecture, Japan. He began learning mathematics in middle school, reading texts in English since none were available in Japanese. After attending a high school for gifted students, he went on to the Imperial University (later Tokyo Imperial University), at that time the only university in Japan before the Imperial University System was established on June 18, 1897. There he learned mathematics from such European classic texts as Salmon&#x27;s &quot;Algebra&quot; and Weber&#x27;s &quot;Lehrbuch der Algebra&quot;. Aided by Hilbert, he then studied at Göttingen. Aside from his work in algebraic number theory he wrote a great number of Japanese textbooks on mathematics and geometry.

During World War I, he was isolated from European mathematicians and developed his existence theorem in class field theory, building on the work of Heinrich Weber. As an Invited Speaker, he presented a synopsis of this research in a talk &quot;Sur quelques théoremes généraux de la théorie des nombres algébriques&quot; at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Strasbourg in 1920. There he found little recognition of the value of his research, since algebraic number theory was then studied mainly in Germany and German mathematicians were excluded from the Congress. Takagi published his theory in the same year in the journal of the University of Tokyo. However, the significance of Takagi&#x27;s work was first recognized by Emil Artin in 1922, and was again pointed out by Carl Ludwig Siegel, and at the same time by Helmut Hasse, who lectured in Kiel in 1923 on class field theory and presented Takagi&#x27;s work in a lecture at the meeting of the DMV in 1925 in Danzig and in his &quot;Klassenkörperbericht&quot; (class field report) in the 1926 annual report of the DMV. Takagi was then internationally recognized as one of the world&#x27;s leading number theorists. In 1932 he was vice-president of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich and in 1936 was a member of the selection committee for the first Fields Medal.

He was also instrumental during World War II in the development of Japanese encryption systems; see Purple.

The Autonne-Takagi factorization of complex symmetric matrices is named in his honour.

* The Creeper system, an experimental self-replicating program, is written by Bob Thomas at BBN Technologies to test John von Neumann&#x27;s theory. Creeper infected DEC PDP-10 computers running the TENEX operating system. Creeper gained access via the ARPANET and copied itself to the remote system where the message &quot;I&#x27;m the creeper, catch me if you can!&quot; was displayed. The Reaper program was later created to delete Creeper.
* At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a graduate student named Alan Davis (working for Prof. Donald Gillies) created a process on a PDP-11 that (a) checked to see if an identical copy of itself was currently running as an active process, and if not, created a copy of itself and started it running; (b) checked to see if any disk space (which all users shared) was available, and if so, created a file the size of that space; and (c) looped back to step (a). As a result, the process stole all available disk space. When users tried to save files, the operating system advised them that the disk was full and that they needed to delete some existing files. Of course, if they did delete a file, this process would immediately snatch up the available space. When users called in a system administrator (A. Ian Stocks) to fix the problem, he examined the active processes, discovered the offending process, and deleted it. Of course, before he left the room, the still existing process would create another copy of itself, and the problem would not go away. The only way to make the computer work again was to reboot.

=== 1972 ===
* The science fiction novel, &quot;When HARLIE Was One&quot;, by David Gerrold, contains one of the first fictional representations of a computer virus, as well as one of the first uses of the word &quot;virus&quot; to denote a program that infects a computer.

=== 1973 ===
* In fiction, the 1973 Michael Crichton movie &quot;Westworld&quot; made an early mention of the concept of a computer virus, being a central plot theme that causes androids to run amok. Alan Oppenheimer&#x27;s character summarizes the problem by stating that &quot;...there&#x27;s a clear pattern here which suggests an analogy to an infectious disease process, spreading from one...area to the next.&quot; To which the replies are stated: &quot;Perhaps there are superficial similarities to disease&quot; and, &quot;I must confess I find it difficult to believe in a disease of machinery.&quot; (Crichton&#x27;s earlier work, the 1969 novel &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; and 1971 film were about an extraterrestrial biological virus-like disease that threatened the human race.)

=== 1974 ===
* The Rabbit (or Wabbit) virus, more a fork bomb than a virus, is written. The Rabbit virus makes multiple copies of itself on a single computer (and was named &quot;rabbit&quot; for the speed at which it did so) until it clogs the system, reducing system performance, before finally reaching a threshold and crashing the computer.

=== 1975 ===
* April: ANIMAL is written by John Walker for the UNIVAC 1108.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/univac/animalsrc.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ANIMAL asked several questions of the user in an attempt to guess the type of animal the user was thinking of, while the related program PERVADE would create a copy of itself and ANIMAL in every directory to which the current user had access. It spread across the multi-user UNIVACs when users with overlapping permissions discovered the game, and to other computers when tapes were shared. The program was carefully written to avoid damaging existing file or directory structures, and to avoid copying itself if permissions did not exist or if harm would result. Its spread was halted by an OS upgrade that changed the format of the file status tables PERVADE used. Though non-malicious, &quot;Pervading Animal&quot; represents the first Trojan &quot;in the wild&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/univac/animal.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1980s ==

=== 1982 ===
* A program called Elk Cloner, written for Apple II systems, was created by high school student Richard Skrenta, originally as a prank. The Apple II was particularly vulnerable due to the storage of its operating system on a floppy disk. Elk Cloner&#x27;s design combined with public ignorance about what malware was and how to protect against it led to Elk Cloner being responsible for the first large-scale computer virus outbreak in history.

=== 1983 ===
* November: The term &quot;virus&quot; is re-coined by Frederick B. Cohen in describing self-replicating computer programs. In 1984 Cohen uses the phrase &quot;computer virus&quot; (suggested by his teacher Leonard Adleman) to describe the operation of such programs in terms of &quot;infection&quot;. He defines a &quot;virus&quot; as &quot;a program that can &#x27;infect&#x27; other programs by modifying them to include a possibly evolved copy of itself.&quot; Cohen demonstrates a virus-like program on a VAX11/750 system at Lehigh University. The program could install itself in, or infect, other system objects.

=== 1984 ===
* August: Ken Thompson publishes his seminal paper, &quot;Reflections on Trusting Trust&quot;, in which he describes how he modified a C compiler so that when used to compile a specific version of the Unix operating system, it inserts a backdoor into the login command, and when used to compile a new copy of itself, it inserts the backdoor insertion code, even if neither the backdoor nor the backdoor insertion code is present in the source code of this new copy.

=== 1986 ===

* Appearance of Lehigh virus (discovered at its namesake university), boot sector viruses such as Yale from the US, Stoned from New Zealand, Ping Pong from Italy, and appearance of the first self-encrypting file virus, Cascade. Lehigh was stopped on campus before it spread to the &quot;wild&quot; (to computers beyond the university), and as a result, has never been found elsewhere. A subsequent infection of Cascade in the offices of IBM Belgium led to IBM responding with its own antivirus product development. Prior to this, antivirus solutions developed at IBM were intended for staff use only.
* October: The Jerusalem virus, part of the (at that time unknown) Suriv family, is detected in the city of Jerusalem. The virus destroys all executable files on infected machines upon every occurrence of Friday the 13th (except Friday 13 November 1987 making its first trigger date May 13, 1988).

Festering Hate was the last iteration of the CyberAIDS series extending back to 1985 and 1986. Unlike the few Apple viruses that had come before which were essentially annoying, but did no damage, the Festering Hate series of viruses was extremely destructive, spreading to all system files it could find on the host computer (hard drive, floppy, and system memory) and then destroying everything when it could no longer find any uninfected files.
* November 2: The Morris worm, created by Robert Tappan Morris, infects DEC VAX and Sun machines running BSD UNIX that are connected to the Internet, and becomes the first worm to spread extensively &quot;in the wild&quot;, and one of the first well-known programs exploiting buffer overrun vulnerabilities.

Later assessments of the damage showed the aftermath to be minimal. John McAfee had been quoted by the media as saying that five million computers would be affected. He later said that pressed by the interviewer to come up with a number, he had estimated a range from five thousand to five million, but the media naturally went with just the higher number.
* October: Milton-Bradley releases &quot;Omega Virus&quot;, a board game containing one of the first examples of a sentient computer virus in mainstream media.

It is believed to have been created by the United States and United Kingdom as a tool for espionage and mass surveillance.

===2015===
* The BASHLITE malware is leaked leading to a massive spike in DDoS attacks.
* Linux.Wifatch is revealed to the general public. It is found to attempt to secure devices from other more malicious malware.

===2016===
* January: A trojan named &quot;MEMZ&quot; is created. The creator, Leurak, explained that the trojan was intended merely as a joke. The trojan alerts the user to the fact that it is a trojan and warns them that if they proceed, the computer may no longer be usable. It contains complex payloads that corrupt the system, displaying artifacts on the screen as it runs. Once run, the application cannot be closed without causing further damage to the computer, which will stop functioning properly regardless. When the computer is restarted, in place of the bootsplash is a message that reads &quot;Your computer has been trashed by the MEMZ Trojan. Now enjoy the Nyan cat...&quot;, which follows with an animation of the Nyan Cat.
* February: Ransomware Locky with its over 60 derivatives spread throughout Europe and infected several million computers. At the height of the spread over five thousand computers per hour were infected in Germany alone. Although ransomware was not a new thing at the time, insufficient cyber security as well as a lack of standards in IT was responsible for the high number of infections. Unfortunately, even up to date antivirus and internet security software was unable to protect systems from early versions of Locky.
* February: Tiny Banker Trojan (Tinba) makes headlines. Since its discovery, it has been found to have infected more than two dozen major banking institutions in the United States, including TD Bank, Chase, HSBC, Wells Fargo, PNC and Bank of America. Tiny Banker Trojan uses HTTP injection to force the user&#x27;s computer to believe that it is on the bank&#x27;s website. This spoof page will look and function just as the real one. The user then enters their information to log on, at which point Tinba can launch the bank webpage&#x27;s &quot;incorrect login information&quot; return, and redirect the user to the real website. This is to trick the user into thinking they had entered the wrong information and proceed as normal, although now Tinba has captured the credentials and sent them to its host.
* August: Journalists and researchers report the discovery of spyware, called Pegasus, developed and distributed by a private company which can and has been used to infect iOS and Android smartphones often – based on 0-day exploits – without the need for any user-interaction or significant clues to the user and then be used to exfiltrate data, track user locations, capture film through its camera, and activate the microphone at any time. The investigation suggests it was used on many targets worldwide and revealed its use for e.g. governments&#x27; espionage on journalists, opposition politicians, activists, business people and others.
* September: Mirai creates headlines by launching some of the most powerful and disruptive DDoS attacks seen to date by infecting the Internet of Things. Mirai ends up being used in the DDoS attack on 20 September 2016 on the Krebs on Security site which reached 620 Gbit/s. Ars Technica also reported a 1 Tbit/s attack on French web host OVH. On 21 October 2016 multiple major DDoS attacks in DNS services of DNS service provider Dyn occurred using Mirai malware installed on a large number of IoT devices, resulting in the inaccessibility of several high-profile websites such as GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, Airbnb and many others. The attribution of the attack to the Mirai botnet was originally reported by BackConnect Inc., a security firm.

=== 2017 ===
* May: The WannaCry ransomware attack spreads globally. Exploits revealed in the NSA hacking toolkit leak of late 2016 were used to enable the propagation of the malware. Shortly after the news of the infections broke online, a UK cybersecurity researcher in collaboration with others found and activated a &quot;kill switch&quot; hidden within the ransomware, effectively halting the initial wave of its global propagation. The next day, researchers announced that they had found new variants of the malware without the kill switch.
*June: The Petya attack spreads globally affecting Windows systems. Researchers at Symantec reveal that this ransomware uses the EternalBlue exploit, similar to the one used in the WannaCry ransomware attack.

* March 2: Researchers Nassi, Cohen, and Bitton developed a computer worm called Morris II, targeting generative AI email assistants to steal data and send spam, thereby breaching security protections of systems like ChatGPT and Gemini. Conducted in a test environment, this research highlights the security risks of multimodal large language models (LLMs) that now generate text, images, and videos. Generative AI systems, which operate on prompts, can be exploited through weaponized prompts. For instance, hidden text on a webpage could instruct an LLM to perform malicious activities, such as phishing for bank details. While generative AI worms like Morris II haven’t been observed in the public, their potential threat is a concern for the tech industry.
* March 29: XZ Utils backdoor is discovered.
* April 1: The Linux&#x27;s WALLSCAPE Bug is discovered.
* June 29: Brain Cipher - a variant of LockBit 3.0 Ransomware behind Indonesia&#x27;s Data Center attacks.

<doc id="174762" wikidata="Q203958" url="?curid=174762" title="Reflection nebula">
<text>In astronomy, reflection nebulae are clouds of interstellar dust which might reflect the light of a nearby star or stars. The energy from the nearby stars is insufficient to ionize the gas of the nebula to create an emission nebula, but is enough to give sufficient scattering to make the dust visible. Thus, the frequency spectrum shown by reflection nebulae is similar to that of the illuminating stars. Among the microscopic particles responsible for the scattering are carbon compounds (e. g. diamond dust) and compounds of other elements such as iron and nickel. The latter two are often aligned with the galactic magnetic field and cause the scattered light to be slightly polarized.

==Discovery==
Analyzing the spectrum of the nebula associated with the star Merope in the Pleiades, Vesto Slipher concluded in 1912 that the source of its light is most likely the star itself, and that the nebula reflects light from the star (and that of the star Alcyone). Calculations by Ejnar Hertzsprung in 1913 lend credence to that hypothesis. Edwin Hubble further distinguished between the emission and reflection nebulae in 1922.

Reflection nebula are usually blue because the scattering is more efficient for blue light than red (this is the same scattering process that gives us blue skies and red sunsets).

Reflection nebulae and emission nebulae are often seen together and are sometimes both referred to as diffuse nebulae.

Some 500 reflection nebulae are known. A blue reflection nebula can also be seen in the same area of the sky as the Trifid Nebula. The supergiant star Antares, which is very red (spectral class M1), is surrounded by a large, yellow reflection nebula.

Reflection nebulae may also be the site of star formation.

==Luminosity law==

In 1922, Edwin Hubble published the result of his investigations on bright nebulae. One part of this work is the Hubble luminosity law for reflection nebulae, which makes a relationship between the angular size (&quot;R&quot;) of the nebula and the apparent magnitude (&quot;m&quot;) of the associated star:

where is a constant that depends on the sensitivity of the measurement.

<doc id="174773" wikidata="Q752651" url="?curid=174773" title="Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation">
<text>Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation (also called the Sharpless bishydroxylation) is the chemical reaction of an alkene with osmium tetroxide in the presence of a chiral quinine ligand to form a vicinal diol. The reaction has been applied to alkenes of virtually every substitution, often high enantioselectivities are realized, with the chiral outcome controlled by the choice of dihydroquinidine (DHQD) vs dihydroquinine (DHQ) as the ligand. Asymmetric dihydroxylation reactions are also highly site selective, providing products derived from reaction of the most electron-rich double bond in the substrate.

It is common practice to perform this reaction using a catalytic amount of osmium tetroxide, which after reaction is regenerated with reoxidants such as potassium ferricyanide or &quot;N&quot;-methylmorpholine &quot;N&quot;-oxide. This dramatically reduces the amount of the highly toxic and very expensive osmium tetroxide needed. These four reagents are commercially available premixed (&quot;AD-mix&quot;). The mixture containing (DHQ)2-PHAL is called AD-mix-α, and the mixture containing (DHQD)2-PHAL is called AD-mix-β.

Such chiral diols are important in organic synthesis. The introduction of chirality into nonchiral reactants through usage of chiral catalysts is an important concept in organic synthesis. This reaction was developed principally by K. Barry Sharpless building on the already known racemic Upjohn dihydroxylation, for which he was awarded a share of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

== Background ==
Alkene dihydroxylation by osmium tetroxide is an old and extremely useful method for the functionalization of alkenes. However, since osmium(VIII) reagents like osmium tetroxide (OsO4) are expensive and extremely toxic, it has become desirable to develop catalytic variants of this reaction. Some stoichiometric terminal oxidants that have been employed in these catalytic reactions include potassium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide (Milas hydroxylation), &quot;N&quot;-Methylmorpholine &quot;N&quot;-oxide (NMO, Upjohn dihydroxylation), &quot;tert&quot;-butyl hydroperoxide (&quot;t&quot;BHP), and potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6). K. Barry Sharpless was the first to develop a general, reliable enantioselective alkene dihydroxylation, referred to as the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation (SAD). Low levels of OsO4 are combined with a stoichiometric ferricyanide oxidant in the presence of chiral nitrogenous ligands to create an asymmetric environment around the oxidant.

== Reaction mechanism ==
The reaction mechanism of the Sharpless dihydroxylation begins with the formation of the osmium tetroxide – ligand complex (2). A [3+2]-cycloaddition with the alkene (3) gives the cyclic intermediate 4. Basic hydrolysis liberates the diol (5) and the reduced osmate (6). Methanesulfonamide (CH3SO2NH2) has been identified as a catalyst to accelerate this step of the catalytic cycle and if frequently used as an additive to allow non-terminal alkene substrates to react efficiently at 0 °C. Finally, the stoichiometric oxidant regenerates the osmium tetroxide – ligand complex (2).

The mechanism of the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation has been extensively studied and a potential secondary catalytic cycle has been identified (see below). If the osmylate ester intermediate is oxidized before it dissociates, then an osmium(VIII)-diol complex is formed which may then dihydroxylate another alkene. Dihydroxylations resulting from this secondary pathway generally suffer lower enantioselectivities than those resulting from the primary pathway. A schematic showing this secondary catalytic pathway is shown below. This secondary pathway may be suppressed by using a higher molar concentration of ligand.

===[2+2] vs [3+2] debate===
In his original report Sharpless suggested the reaction proceeded via a [2+2] cycloaddition of OsO4 onto the alkene to give an osmaoxetane intermediate (see below). This intermediate would then undergo a 1,1- migratory insertion to form an osmylate ester which after hydrolysis would give the corresponding diol. In 1989 E. J. Corey published a slightly different variant of this reaction and suggested that the reaction most likely proceeded via a [3+2] cycloaddition of OsO4 with the alkene to directly generate the osmylate ester. Corey&#x27;s suggestion was based on a previous computational study done by Jorgensen and Hoffmann which determined the [3+2] reaction pathway to be the lower energy pathway. In addition Corey reasoned that steric repulsions in the octahedral intermediate would disfavor the [2+2] pathway.

The next ten years saw numerous publications by both Corey and Sharpless, each supporting their own version of the mechanism. While these studies were not able to distinguish between the two proposed cyclization pathways, they were successful in shedding light on the mechanism in other ways. For example, Sharpless provided evidence for the reaction proceeding via a step-wise mechanism. Additionally both Sharpless and Corey showed that the active catalyst possesses a U-shaped chiral binding pocket. Corey also showed that the catalyst obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics and acts like an enzyme pocket with a pre-equilibrium. In the February 1997 issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society Sharpless published the results of a study (a Hammett analysis) which he claimed supported a [2+2] cyclization over a [3+2]. In the October issue of the same year, however, Sharpless also published the results of another study conducted in collaboration with Ken Houk and Singleton which provided conclusive evidence for the [3+2] mechanism. Thus Sharpless was forced to concede the decade-long debate.

=== Catalyst structure ===

Crystallographic evidence has shown that the active catalyst possesses a pentacoordinate osmium species held in a U-shaped binding pocket. The nitrogenous ligand holds OsO4 in a chiral environment making approach of one side of the olefin sterically hindered while the other is not.

== Catalytic systems ==
Numerous catalytic systems and modifications have been developed for the SAD. Given below is a brief overview of the various components of the catalytic system:
# Catalytic Oxidant: This is always OsO4, however certain additives can coordinate to the osmium(VIII) and modify its electronic properties. OsO4 is often generated in situ from K2OsO2(OH)4 (an Os(VI) species) due to safety concerns.
# Chiral Auxiliary: This is usually some kind of cinchona alkaloid.
# Stoichiometric Oxidant:
#* Peroxides were among the first stoichiometric oxidants to be used in this catalytic cycle; see the Milas hydroxylation. Drawbacks of peroxides include chemoselectivity issues.
#* Trialkylammonium N-oxides, such as NMO—as in the Upjohn Reaction—and trimethylamine N-oxide.
#* Potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6) is the most commonly used stoichiometric oxidant for the reaction, and is the oxidant that comes in the commercially available AD-mix preparations.
# Additive:
#* Citric acid: Osmium tetroxide is an electrophilic oxidant and as such reacts slowly with electron-deficient olefins. It has been found that the rate of oxidation of electron-deficient olefins can be accelerated by maintaining the pH of the reaction slightly acidic. On the other hand, a high pH can increase the rate of oxidation of internal olefins, and also increase the enantiomeric excess (e.e.) for the oxidation of terminal olefins.

== Regioselectivity ==
In general Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation favors oxidation of the more electron-rich alkene (scheme 1).

In this example SAD gives the diol of the alkene closest to the (electron-withdrawing) para-methoxybenzoyl group, albeit in low yield. This is likely due to the ability of the aryl ring to interact favorably with the active site of the catalyst via π-stacking. In this manner the aryl substituent can act as a directing group.

== Stereoselectivity ==
The diastereoselectivity of SAD is set primarily by the choice of ligand (i.e. AD-mix-α versus AD-mix-β), however factors such as pre-existing chirality in the substrate or neighboring functional groups may also play a role. In the example shown below, the para-methoxybenzoyl substituent serves primarily as a source of steric bulk to allow the catalyst to differentiate the two faces of the alkene.

It is often difficult to obtain high diastereoselectivity on &quot;cis&quot;-disubstituted alkenes when both ends of the olefin have similar steric environments.

<doc id="174774" wikidata="Q16932703" url="?curid=174774" title="Russian Germans in North America">
<text>Russian Germans in North America are descended from the many ethnic Germans from Russia who immigrated to North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Russian Germans frequently lived in distinct communities and maintained German language schools and German churches. They were primarily Volga Germans from the lower Volga River valley; Black Sea Germans from the Crimean Peninsula/Black Sea region; or Volhynian Germans from the governorate of Volhynia in what is Ukraine. The smaller villages were often settled by colonists of a common religious denomination who had come from the same area and so a town is made up of German-speaking Catholics, Lutherans. The people often settled together from the same region of Germany and so spoke the same German dialect.

Originally recruited and welcomed to the Russian Empire in the 18th century, when they were promised to be allowed to practice own language and religions and to be exempted from compulsory military service, the Germans from Russia found increasing hardship. With changes in politics, the Russian government took back some of the privileges that had been granted, economic conditions grew poor. Those conditions led to German mass migrations from Russia.

After the Bolshevik Revolution and the rise of the Soviet Union, particularly under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, conditions for the remaining Germans in Russia declined considerably. The subsequent rise of Nazi Germany, with its concern about ethnic Germans in other lands and proselytizing to the German &quot;Volk&quot;, led to suspicions of any Germans in Russia. In 1932 and 1933, the Soviet authorities forced starvation among the Volga Germans according to Western observers. Soviet authorities seized food supplies under the pretext of famine in the rest of the Soviet Union, and they ordered the breakup of many German villages.

After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Stalin ordered the deportation of Russian Germans to labor camps in Siberia and Central Asia, as he was suspicious of potential collaboration with the invaders. In some areas, his forces attempted to bulldoze the German churches and reused their tombstones for paving blocks. Many Germans in the Americas sent donations back to their communities, but others permanently lost contact with their relatives during the social disruptions of the Ukrainian famine, Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, and World War II.

==Areas of immigration ==
Unlike many other immigrants to the Americas during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Germans from Russia wanted to continue farming and settled in agricultural areas, rather than industrial cities. Primary areas of settlement were in the Great Plains since it resembled the flat terrain of the Russian steppes. In addition, the upper Great Plains still had arable land available for free settlement under the Homestead Act. In the 2000 Census, North Dakota reported 43.9% of the population identified as having German ancestry. In 1910, 5% of the population of North Dakota had been born in Russia; it is likely that most were ethnic Germans.

Large-scale immigration to the Americas started in the 1870s and continued until the 1917 Revolution, when travel and emigration were stopped.

Since the reunification of Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the declining conditions in Russia, many ethnic Germans still living in the lands of the former Soviet Union sought German repatriation.

==United States==
The Volga Germans were heavily involved with the growing sugar beet industry in northern Colorado and western Nebraska. Most Black Sea Germans were affiliated with wheat production in the Dakotas.

The highest concentrations of Germans from Russia were mainly in the Great Plains. By 1910, North Dakota had the largest population of them, followed by Kansas, Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. Over time, many of them drifted further west into Montana, Oregon, Washington, and California. States in the Great Lakes region such as Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan had sizable populations of Germans from Russia as well.

By 1990, approximately one million descendants of Germans from Russia lived in the United States. Many of those descendants today often describe their ancestry as simply being German, and have become a subgroup of German Americans. 

In 2019, a crowdsourced survey was conducted by Sandy Schilling Payne that analyzed approximately 150 years of migration patterns within the United States. It was reported that California had the highest number of places where Germans from Russia and their descendants resided. Factors such as the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl, and World War II prompted many to relocate from hard hit states in the Midwest to California. 

===Cities===
Other Volga Germans made new lives in the industrializing American cities, especially in Chicago, which had an immense upsurge in immigration from Eastern Europe during that time. The largest area of concentrated settlement was in Jefferson Park, on the city&#x27;s Northwest Side, mostly between 1907 and 1920. By 1930, 450 families of the Evangelical faith were living in that area, most of whom originated from &quot;Wiesenseite&quot;. Later, during the period of suburbanization, many of their descendants moved out to outlying areas such as Maywood and Melrose Park. Many families living in the Jefferson Park central business district along Lawrence and Milwaukee Avenue have Volga German immigrant ancestors.

A community of Volga Germans developed in Portland, mainly concentrated in Albina. Outsiders often described this area as &quot;Little Russia,&quot; despite their ethnic German identity.

Another urban center that attracted numerous Volga German families was Denver, specifically the neighborhood of Globeville.
===Wheat===
Bernhard Warkentin, born in a small Russian village in 1847, travelled to America in his early twenties. Interested in flour mills, he was especially impressed with the wheat-growing possibilities in the United States. After he had visited Kansas, Warkentin found the Great Plains much like those that he had left behind. Settling in Harvey County, Kansas, he built a water mill on the banks of the Little Arkansas River, the Halstead Milling and Elevator Company. Warkentin&#x27;s greatest contribution to Kansas was the introduction of hard Turkey Wheat into Kansas, which replaced the soft variety grown exclusively in the state.

===Culture===
Negatively influenced by the violation of their rights and cultural persecution by the tsar, the Russian Germans who settled in the northern Midwest saw themselves as an ethnic group that was separate from Russian Americans and had an entirely different experience from the German Americans who had immigrated from German lands. The Germans from Russia settled in tight-knit communities, which retained their German language and culture. They raised large families, built German-style churches, buried their dead in distinctive cemeteries by using wrought iron grave markers, and created choir groups that sang German church hymns. Many farmers specialized in the production of sugar beets and wheat, which are still major crops in the upper Great Plains. During World War I, their identity was challenged by anti-German sentiment. 

===Memory===
During the 1970s, Dr. Kenneth Rock, a professor of history at Colorado State University, collected 60 oral histories of Russian German immigrants and their descendants as part of the &quot;Germans from Russia in Colorado&quot; Study Project. He documented life in the ethnic German communities in Russia, the immigration experience, work and social life in the United States, and interaction between the Russian-German communities and the wider society in both Russia and the United States. They were often described as looking like Russians but sounding like Germans.

==Canada==
===Background===
In addition to the large population of Germans from Russia that settled on the American prairie, many also settled in the Canadian West. In the early 1870s, the Canadian government had begun to create promotional programs in Europe to entice settlers to the largely-unsettled western areas in what would become Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and British Columbia. Public policy also served to attract immigration following the passage of the federal &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; of 1872, which provided free grants of homesteads to those who settled on the Canadian prairie. In the early 20th century, many immigrants moved from the United States to Canada in search of inexpensive land and greater social autonomy. Those German-American immigrants brought not only their experience working on the American plains but also their accrued wealth, which gave a much needed boost to the economy of Western Canada.

===1875–1918===
The Germans from Russia who flocked to Canada in the late 19th and early 20th centuries came from different religious backgrounds, including Lutheran, Catholic, and Mennonite. The last group, named after the founder Menno Simons, was the largest portion of the immigrant population. Those Mennonites were Plautdietsch-speaking people of Dutch descent who in Russia had been the best organized by preparing scouting parties to investigate the prospect of immigration to Canada and the United States. The scouts had been reliant on the assistance of established Mennonite groups such as those found in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and in Ontario. From 1873 to 1879, Mennonites formed block settlements in Manitoba such as the East Reserve and West Reserve, with a total of close to 7,000 members. Most settled in southern Manitoba in the richest part of the Red River Valley. The communities were centered around religious homogeneity, the insistence on the tenets of adult baptism, and the refusal to bear arms or to swear an oath. Many Mennonites had been propelled to leave because of the introduction of extended conscription, which had been put into place in 1874 and was set to take effect in Russia in 1881.

Many Germans from Russia emigrated from the United States to Western Canada from 1890 to 1909. They sought to escape rising land prices and the imposition of laws that had begun to encroach on their relative autonomy. Canada was seen as a new frontier and a place of vast land but little settlement. The immigrants settled mainly in the colonies of St. Peter and St. Joseph, East and West of Saskatoon, in central Saskatchewan. In the 1890s, twelve Catholic families established Rastadt-Dorf, and another twenty-one settled Katherinetal. Additional settlements were begun in Davin, Kronau, and Speyer.

===Interwar period===
During the interwar period, conditions in Russia worsened, especially after the Revolution and the Great Famine of 1921. Many ethnic Germans sought to leave the Soviet Union but faced opposition from a government that did not wish to see such a large portion of its population leave. The government imposed a fee for obtaining a passport, which led to protests as many would-be immigrants flooded the streets of Moscow. Many Mennonites were eventually able to leave, and between the World Wars, over 20,000 of them left destined for Canada.

From the 1910s to several years after the end of the Second World War, the ethnic background of the Germans made them prey to discrimination in Canada. By 1914, Germany had become Canada&#x27;s enemy, and the Germans from Russia were not immune from suspicion, even though many families had not lived in Germany for hundreds of years. This period saw the suppression of many German cultural customs, including the suppression of their print media and the closure of German schools. The federal &quot;Wartime Elections Act&quot;, passed in September 1917, revoked the citizenship of any German naturalized after March 1902. Many settlements were renamed to disguise their obvious German origin.

The 1920s also saw the movement of Germans from Russia within Western Canada as well. Many pushed further west and settled in British Columbia. The area had the appeal of a warmer climate, an escape from the frigid prairie. Other Germans were propelled by economic factors such as the Great Depression, which not only impoverished many but also coincided with a tremendous drought ushering in crop failures. The economy of the Prairies and much of the rest of Canada was dependent on the success of wheat farming. Wheat had been a staple crop for the Germans in Russia and adapted well to the climate of Western Canada. Repeated crop failures meant a large influx of German-Russians to larger cities and towns, which would contribute to the gradual decline of their culturally homogeneous communities. The prairie lands abutting the United States border experienced Dust Bowl conditions, which sent swarms of families to the coastal areas of British Columbia. Throughout the period after World War II, new immigrants joined their families in British Columbia and congregated in the Fraser Valley and Vancouver Island.

===Legacy===
Throughout their history in Western Canada, the Germans from Russia have maintained many of their cultural characteristics, including their dialects, which have been proliferated through Saturday schools and Canadian policies that allowed for cultural freedom. Those schools operated on Saturday mornings for around three hours and became especially vital as German stopped being taught in Canadian public schools after World War I. The Mennonites, unlike most Volga Germans, maintained those schools even after World War II. The Volga Germans&#x27; dialects was also maintained by the churches, especially for Mennonite.

Before the Germans from Russia left for North America, they had been regarded as privileged colonists in Russia. When they arrived in the United States and Canada, they found that they were treated the same as any other migrant group from Eastern Europe. The Mennonites may be seen as an exception since they successfully used connections with their brethren in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and in Ontario. Through their hard work on the North American plains, they established themselves as a productive portion of society in both Canada and America.

==Language ==
The Germans from Russia originally spoke German dialects such as the Palatine dialect or Mennonite Low German () at home. Since the villages in Russia often were populated by settlers from a particular region and isolated from Germany, they maintained their regional dialects. Depending on their specific dialect, some Germans from Russia had difficulties understanding Standard German, which can differ greatly from the dialects.

After emigrating from Russia to the Americas, the Germans kept speaking their dialects. As a result of anti-German sentiment that developed over the course of both world wars, English became the dominant language among many of them. However, descendants of Germans from Russia who choose to stay in touch with their heritage often learn Standard German, especially since the modern Hochdeutsch that stems from Martin Luther&#x27;s translation of the Bible had already been the standard written form of the language. Today, German is preserved mainly through singing groups, recipes, and educational settings.

<text>A Place in the Sun is the second studio album by the American rock band Lit, released on February 23, 1999.

==Release==
Produced by Don Gilmore, the album was released on February 23, 1999 by Dirty Martini and RCA Records. It was the band&#x27;s first release through a major label. The song &quot;No Big Thing&quot;, which originally appeared on their previous album &quot;Tripping the Light Fantastic&quot;, was re-recorded for this album, and eventually appeared on the auto racing video game &quot;Jarrett &amp; Labonte Stock Car Racing&quot;.

On December 9, 2013, the band announced on its Facebook page that it would perform a special 15th anniversary show for &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;, when the band would play the entire album from start to finish on February 28, 2014, at the House of Blues in Anaheim, California.

==Reception and legacy==

The album peaked at #31 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Singles from the album were &quot;My Own Worst Enemy&quot;, which reached #1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart for eleven weeks, &quot;Zip-Lock&quot; and &quot;Miserable&quot;. &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; has been certified platinum by in sales by the RIAA, in the United States.

&quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; received mixed reviews. Leslie Matthew in &quot;AllMusic&quot; described it as &quot;an album that is sonically more focused, but it also unfortunately makes the band sound like replicas of a dozen of their post-grunge contemporaries: neither Better Than Ezra or Less Than Jake&quot;. At &quot;NME&quot;, the songs &quot;My Own Worst Enemy&quot; and &quot;No Big Thing&quot; were described as having &quot;a hook as sharp and persistent as a leech&quot;. It went on to say, &quot;Gonzoid trash fun maybe, but how we got from The Dead Kennedys to here remains a mystery.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; listed the album as one of &quot;20 Pop Punk Albums Which Will Make You Nostalgic&quot;.

The album was a massive influence on Eve 6&#x27;s &quot;Horrorscope&quot; (2000), Good Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;Good Charlotte&quot; (2000), American Hi-Fi&#x27;s &quot;American Hi-Fi&quot; (2001), The All-American Rejects&#x27; &quot;Move Along&quot; (2005) and Zebrahead&#x27;s &quot;Broadcast to the World&quot; (2006).

The most common source of ionization is high-energy ultraviolet photons emitted from a nearby hot star. Among the several different types of emission nebulae are H II regions, in which star formation is taking place and young, massive stars are the source of the ionizing photons; and planetary nebulae, in which a dying star has thrown off its outer layers, with the exposed hot core then ionizing them.

==General information==
Usually, a young star will ionize part of the same cloud from which it was born, although only massive, hot stars can release sufficient energy to ionize a significant part of a cloud. In many emission nebulae, an entire cluster of young stars is contributing energy.

Stars that are hotter than 25,000 K generally emit enough ionizing ultraviolet radiation (wavelength shorter than 91.2 nm) to cause the emission nebulae around them to be brighter than the reflection nebulae. The radiation emitted by cooler stars is generally not energetic enough to ionize hydrogen, which results in the reflection nebulae around these stars giving off less light than the emission nebulae. 

The nebula&#x27;s color depends on its chemical composition and degree of ionization. Due to the prevalence of hydrogen in interstellar gas, and its relatively low energy of ionization, many emission nebulae appear red due to strong emissions of the Balmer series. If more energy is available, other elements will be ionized, and green and blue nebulae become possible. By examining the spectra of nebulae, astronomers infer their chemical content. Most emission nebulae are about 90% hydrogen, with the remaining helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements.

Some of the most prominent emission nebulae visible from the northern celestial hemisphere are the North America Nebula (NGC 7000) and Veil Nebula NGC 6960/6992 in Cygnus, while in the south celestial hemisphere, the Lagoon Nebula M8 / NGC 6523 in Sagittarius and the Orion Nebula M42. Further in the southern hemisphere is the bright Carina Nebula NGC 3372.

Emission nebulae often have dark areas in them which result from clouds of dust which block the light.

Many nebulae are made up of both reflection and emission components such as the Trifid Nebula.

<text>In physics, a gravitational field or gravitational acceleration field is a vector field used to explain the influences that a body extends into the space around itself. A gravitational field is used to explain gravitational phenomena, such as the &quot;gravitational force field&quot; exerted on another massive body. It has dimension of acceleration (L/T2) and it is measured in units of newtons per kilogram (N/kg) or, equivalently, in meters per second squared (m/s2).

In its original concept, gravity was a force between point masses. Following Isaac Newton, Pierre-Simon Laplace attempted to model gravity as some kind of radiation field or fluid, and since the 19th century, explanations for gravity in classical mechanics have usually been taught in terms of a field model, rather than a point attraction. It results from the spatial gradient of the gravitational potential field.

In general relativity, rather than two particles attracting each other, the particles distort spacetime via their mass, and this distortion is what is perceived and measured as a &quot;force&quot;. In such a model one states that matter moves in certain ways in response to the curvature of spacetime, and that there is either &quot;no gravitational force&quot;, or that gravity is a fictitious force.

Gravity is distinguished from other forces by its obedience to the equivalence principle.

== Classical mechanics ==

In classical mechanics, a gravitational field is a physical quantity. A gravitational field can be defined using Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation. Determined in this way, the gravitational field around a single particle of mass is a vector field consisting at every point of a vector pointing directly towards the particle. The magnitude of the field at every point is calculated by applying the universal law, and represents the force per unit mass on any object at that point in space. Because the force field is conservative, there is a scalar potential energy per unit mass, , at each point in space associated with the force fields; this is called gravitational potential. The gravitational field equation is
formula_1
where is the gravitational force, is the mass of the test particle, is the radial vector of the test particle relative to the mass (or for Newton&#x27;s second law of motion which is a time dependent function, a set of positions of test particles each occupying a particular point in space for the start of testing), is time, is the gravitational constant, and is the del operator.

This includes Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, and the relation between gravitational potential and field acceleration. and are both equal to the gravitational acceleration (equivalent to the inertial acceleration, so same mathematical form, but also defined as gravitational force per unit mass). The negative signs are inserted since the force acts antiparallel to the displacement. The equivalent field equation in terms of mass density of the attracting mass is:
formula_2
which contains Gauss&#x27;s law for gravity, and Poisson&#x27;s equation for gravity. Newton&#x27;s law implies Gauss&#x27;s law, but not vice versa; see &quot;Relation between Gauss&#x27;s and Newton&#x27;s laws&quot;.

These classical equations are differential equations of motion for a test particle in the presence of a gravitational field, i.e. setting up and solving these equations allows the motion of a test mass to be determined and described.

The field around multiple particles is simply the vector sum of the fields around each individual particle. A test particle in such a field will experience a force that equals the vector sum of the forces that it would experience in these individual fields. This is
formula_3
i.e. the gravitational field on mass is the sum of all gravitational fields due to all other masses &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot;, except the mass itself. is the position vector of the gravitating particle , and is that of the test particle.

== General relativity ==

In general relativity, the Christoffel symbols play the role of the gravitational force field and the metric tensor plays the role of the gravitational potential.

In general relativity, the gravitational field is determined by solving the Einstein field equations
formula_4
where is the stress–energy tensor, is the Einstein tensor, and is the Einstein gravitational constant. The latter is defined as , where is the Newtonian constant of gravitation and is the speed of light.

These equations are dependent on the distribution of matter, stress and momentum in a region of space, unlike Newtonian gravity, which is depends on only the distribution of matter. The fields themselves in general relativity represent the curvature of spacetime. General relativity states that being in a region of curved space is equivalent to accelerating up the gradient of the field. By Newton&#x27;s second law, this will cause an object to experience a fictitious force if it is held still with respect to the field. This is why a person will feel himself pulled down by the force of gravity while standing still on the Earth&#x27;s surface. In general the gravitational fields predicted by general relativity differ in their effects only slightly from those predicted by classical mechanics, but there are a number of easily verifiable differences, one of the most well known being the deflection of light in such fields.

== Embedding diagram ==
Embedding diagrams are three dimensional graphs commonly used to educationally illustrate gravitational potential by drawing gravitational potential fields as a gravitational topography, depicting the potentials as so-called gravitational wells, sphere of influence.

<text>The Canadian territory of Yukon has had a responsible government since 1978. In the 19th century, Yukon was a segment of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company-administered North-Western Territory and then the Canadian-administered Northwest Territories. The territory only obtained a recognizable local government in 1895 when it became a separate district of the Northwest Territories. In 1898, Yukon was made a separate territory with its own commissioner and appointed Territorial Council. Prior to the creation of the Yukon Legislative Assembly in 1978, the Territorial Council had a largely advisory role with no political parties or government leader. Instead, powers were invested in the governing Commissioner appointed by the federal government.

Yukon has had nine premiers since 1978, of which five were from the Yukon Party and its predecessor the Yukon Progressive Conservative Party, two were from the Yukon Liberal Party, and two were from the Yukon New Democratic Party. Yukon is the only province or territory in Canada that has never had a native-born premier. The Government of Yukon does not publish an official list of premiers. Listed here are the terms of serve as provided by the Parliament of Canada.

<doc id="174791" wikidata="Q18293488" url="?curid=174791" title="British Agricultural Revolution">
<text>The British Agricultural Revolution, or Second Agricultural Revolution, was an unprecedented increase in agricultural production in Britain arising from increases in labor and land productivity between the mid-17th and late 19th centuries. Agricultural output grew faster than the population over the hundred-year period ending in 1770, and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world. This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in England and Wales, from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801, though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the 19th century as the population more than tripled to over 35 million.

Using 1700 as a base year (=100), agricultural output per agricultural worker in Britain steadily increased from about 50 in 1500, to around 65 in 1550, to 90 in 1600, to over 100 by 1650, to over 150 by 1750, rapidly increasing to over 250 by 1850. The rise in productivity accelerated the decline of the agricultural share of the labour force, adding to the urban workforce on which industrialization depended: the Agricultural Revolution has therefore been cited as a cause of the Industrial Revolution.

However, historians continue to dispute when exactly such a &quot;revolution&quot; took place and of what it consisted. Rather than a single event, G. E. Mingay states that there were a &quot;profusion of agricultural revolutions, one for two centuries before 1650, another emphasising the century after 1650, a third for the period 1750–1780, and a fourth for the middle decades of the nineteenth century&quot;. This has led more recent historians to argue that any general statements about &quot;the Agricultural Revolution&quot; are difficult to sustain.

One important change in farming methods was the move in crop rotation to turnips and clover in place of fallow under the Norfolk four-course system. Turnips can be grown in winter and are deep-rooted, allowing them to gather minerals unavailable to shallow-rooted crops. Clover fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form of fertiliser. This permitted the intensive arable cultivation of light soils on enclosed farms and provided fodder to support increased livestock numbers whose manure added further to soil fertility.

== Term ==
Called “British”, the term implies that the revolution began in Britain, not that it existed solely in Britain. Other countries in Europe (including France, Prussia (Germany), and Russia), East Asia and North America followed suit in the next two centuries. The Second Agricultural Revolution was much like the Neolithic Revolution in that it occurred in many regions across the world in a short span of time.

The British origins of the revolution is the view shared by the British historians. The Dutch historians disagree. In the Netherlands between 1500 and 1650, the agricultural output per laborer rose by 80% leading to over 60% decline in manpower engaged in agriculture by 1650. From 1500 to 1750, the Dutch were faster than Britain in reducing the agricultural sector of population. The Netherlands were called &quot;school room,&quot; or &quot;home&quot; of the modern agricultural revolution. Notably, one of the innovations in the British Revolution was the “Dutch” light plow. English landowners and their agents who returned from exile in the Netherlands in the 17th century introduced Dutch methods and techniques.

The term &quot;revolution&quot; refers to increase in yields per land and labour. Innovations in agricultural technology and methods took place gradually rather than an abrupt sweeping alteration.
==Major developments and innovations==
The British Agricultural Revolution was the result of the complex interaction of social, economic and farming technological changes. Major developments and innovations include:

* Norfolk four-course crop rotation: fodder crops, particularly turnips and clover, replaced leaving the land fallow. 
* The Dutch acquired the Chinese heavy, mould-board iron plough so that it could be pulled with fewer oxen or horses.
* Enclosure: the removal of common rights to establish exclusive ownership of land
* Development of a national market free of tariffs, tolls and customs barriers
* Transportation infrastructures, such as improved roads, canals, and later, railways
* Land conversion, land drains and reclamation
* Increase in farm size
* Selective breeding

One of the most important innovations of the British Agricultural Revolution was the development of the Norfolk four-course rotation, which greatly increased crop and livestock yields by improving soil fertility and reducing fallow.

Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons to help restore plant nutrients and mitigate the build-up of pathogens and pests that often occur when one plant species is continuously cropped. Rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Turnip roots, for example, can recover nutrients from deep under the soil. As it is now known, the Norfolk four-course system rotates crops so that different crops are planted, resulting in various kinds and quantities of nutrients being taken from the soil as the plants grow. An essential feature of the Norfolk four-field system was that it used labour at times when demand was not at peak levels.

Planting cover crops such as turnips and clover was not permitted under the common field system because they interfered with access to the fields. Besides, other people&#x27;s livestock could graze the turnips. During the Middle Ages, the open-field system had initially used a two-field crop rotation system where one field was left fallow or turned into pasture for a time to try to recover some of its plant nutrients. Later they employed a three-year, three field crop rotation routine, with a different crop in each of two fields, e.g. oats, rye, wheat, and barley with the second field growing a legume like peas or beans, and the third field fallow. Normally from 10% to 30% of the arable land in a three crop rotation system is fallow. Each field was rotated into a different crop nearly every year. Over the following two centuries, the regular planting of legumes in the fields that were previously fallow slowly restored the fertility of some croplands. The planting of legumes helped to increase plant growth in the empty field because of the ability of the bacteria on legume roots to fix nitrogen from the air into the soil in a form that plants could use. Other crops that were occasionally grown were flax and members of the mustard family.

Convertible husbandry was the alternation of a field between pasture and grain. Because nitrogen builds up slowly over time in pasture, ploughing up pasture and planting grains resulted in high yields for a few years. A big disadvantage of convertible husbandry was the hard work in breaking up pastures and difficulty in establishing them. The significance of convertible husbandry is that it introduced pasture into the rotation.

The farmers in Flanders (in parts of France and current day Belgium) discovered a still more effective four-field crop rotation system, using turnips and clover (a legume) as forage crops to replace the three-year crop rotation fallow year. The four-field rotation system allowed farmers to restore soil fertility and restore some of the plant nutrients removed with the crops. Turnips first show up in the probate records in England as early as 1638 but were not widely used till about 1750. Fallow land was about 20% of the arable area in England in 1700 before turnips and clover were extensively grown in the 1830s. Guano and nitrates from South America were introduced in the mid-19th century, and fallow steadily declined to reach only about 4% in 1900. Ideally, wheat, barley, turnips and clover would be planted in that order in each field in successive years. The turnips helped keep the weeds down and were an excellent forage crop—ruminant animals could eat the tops and roots through a large part of the summer and winters. There was no need to let the soil lie fallow as clover would add nitrates (nitrogen-containing salts) back to the soil. The clover made excellent pasture and hay fields as well as green manure when it was ploughed under after one or two years. The addition of clover and turnips allowed more animals to be kept through the winter, which in turn produced more milk, cheese, meat and manure, which maintained soil fertility.

The mix of crops also changed: the area under wheat rose by 1870 to 3.5 million acres (1.4m ha), barley to 2.25m acres (0.9m ha) and oats less dramatically to 2.75m acres (1.1m ha), while rye dwindled to , less than a tenth of its late medieval peak. Grain yields benefited from new and better seed alongside improved rotation and fertility: wheat yields increased by a quarter in the 18th century and nearly half in the 19th, averaging 30 bushels per acre (2,080 kg/ha) by the 1890s.

===Dutch and Rotherham swing (wheel-less) plough===
The Dutch acquired the iron-tipped, curved mouldboard, adjustable depth plough which was invented in Chinese Han dynasty from the Chinese in the early 17th century. It had the advantage of being able to be pulled by one or two oxen compared to the six or eight needed by the heavy wheeled northern European plough. The Dutch plough was brought to Britain by Dutch contractors who were hired to drain East Anglian fens and Somerset moors. The plough was extremely successful on wet, boggy soil, but was soon used on ordinary land as well.

British improvements included Joseph Foljambe&#x27;s cast iron plough (patented 1730), which combined an earlier Dutch design with several innovations. Its fittings and coulter were made of iron, and the mouldboard and share were covered with an iron plate, making it easier to pull and more controllable than previous ploughs. By the 1760s Foljambe was making large numbers of these ploughs in a factory outside of Rotherham, using standard patterns with interchangeable parts. The plough was easy for a blacksmith to make, but by the end of the 18th century it was being made in rural foundries. By 1770 it was the cheapest and best plough available. It spread to Scotland, America, and France.

===New crops===
The Columbian exchange brought many new foodstuffs from the Americas to Eurasia, most of which took decades or centuries to catch on. Arguably the most important of these was the potato. Potatoes yielded about three times the calories per acre of wheat or barley, mainly because it took only taking 3–4 months to mature versus 10 months for wheat. On top of this, potatoes had higher nutritive value than wheat, could be grown in even fallow and nutrient-poor soil, did not require any special tools, and were considered fairly appetizing. According to Langer, a single acre of potatoes could feed a family of five or six, plus a cow, for the better part of a year, an unprecedented level of production. By 1715 the potato was widespread in the Low Countries, the Rhineland, southwestern Germany, and eastern France, but took longer to spread elsewhere.

The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, established in 1660, almost immediately championed the potato, stressing its value as a substitute for wheat (particularly since famine periods for wheat overlapped with bump periods for potatoes). The 1740 famines buttressed their case. The mid 18th century was marked by rapid adoption of the potato by various European countries, especially in central Europe, as various wheat famines demonstrated its value. The potato was grown in Ireland, a property of the English crown and common source of food exports, since the early 17th century and quickly spread so that by the 18th century it had been firmly established as a staple food. It spread to England shortly after it took hold in Ireland, first being widely cultivated in Lancashire and around London, and by the mid-18th century it was esteemed and common. By the late 18th century, Sir Frederick Eden wrote that the potato had become &quot;a constant standing dish, at every meal, breakfast excepted, at the tables of the Rich, as well as the Poor.&quot;

While not as vital as the potato, maize also contributed to the boost of Western European agricultural productivity. Maize also had far higher per-acre productivity than wheat (about two and a half times), grew at widely differing altitudes and in a variety of soils (though warmer climates were preferred), and unlike wheat it could be harvested in successive years from the same plot of land. It was often grown alongside potatoes, as maize plants required wide spacing. Maize was cultivated in Spain since 1525 and Italy since 1530, contributing to their growing populations in the early modern era as it became a dietary staple in the 17th century (in Italy it was often made into polenta). It spread from northern Italy into Germany and beyond, becoming an important staple in the Habsburg monarchy (especially Hungary and Austria) by the late 17th century. Its spread started in southern France in 1565, and by the start of the 18th century it was the main food source of central and southern French peasants (it was more popular as animal fodder in the north).

===Enclosure===

In Europe, agriculture was feudal from the Middle Ages. In the feudal open-field system, peasant farmers were assigned individual narrow strips of land in large fields which were used for growing crops. For the right to work this land they would pay a percentage of the yield to the aristocracy or the Catholic Church, who owned the land. A separate section of land in the same area would be &quot;held in common&quot; as grazing pasture. Periodically the grazing land would be rotated with the crop land to allow the land to recover.

As early as the 12th century, some fields in England tilled under the open-field system were enclosed into individually owned fields. The Black Death from 1348 onward accelerated the break-up of the feudal system in England. Many farms were bought by yeomen who enclosed their property and improved their use of the land. More secure control of the land allowed the owners to make innovations that improved their yields. Other husbandmen rented property they &quot;share cropped&quot; with the land owners. Many of these enclosures were accomplished by acts of Parliament in the 16th and 17th centuries.

The process of enclosing property accelerated in the 15th and 16th centuries. The more productive enclosed farms meant that fewer farmers were needed to work the same land, leaving many villagers without land and grazing rights. Many of them moved to the cities in search of work in the emerging factories of the Industrial Revolution. Others settled in the English colonies. English Poor Laws were enacted to help these newly poor.

Some practices of enclosure were denounced by the Church, and legislation was drawn up against it; but the large, enclosed fields were needed for the gains in agricultural productivity from the 16th to 18th centuries. This controversy led to a series of government acts, culminating in the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 which sanctioned large-scale land reform. The process of enclosure was largely complete by the end of the 18th century.

===Development of a national market===
Regional markets were widespread by 1500 with about 800 locations in Britain. The most important development between the 16th century and the mid-19th century was private marketing. By the 19th century, marketing was nationwide, and the vast majority of agricultural production was for market rather than for the farmer and his family. The 16th-century market radius was about 10 miles, which could support a town of 10,000.
The next stage of development was trading between markets, requiring merchants, credit and forward sales, knowledge of markets and pricing and of supply and demand in different markets. Eventually, the market evolved into a national one driven by London and other growing cities. By 1700, there was a national market for wheat.

Legislation regulating middlemen required registration, addressed weights and measures, fixing of prices and collection of tolls by the government. Market regulations were eased in 1663 when people were allowed some self-regulation to hold inventory, but it was forbidden to withhold commodities from the market in an effort to increase prices. In the late 18th century, the idea of self-regulation was gaining acceptance. The lack of internal tariffs, customs barriers and feudal tolls made Britain &quot;the largest coherent market in Europe&quot;.

===Transportation infrastructures===
High wagon transportation costs made it uneconomical to ship commodities very far outside the market radius by road, generally limiting shipment to less than 20 or 30 miles to market or to a navigable waterway. Water transport was, and in some cases still is, much more efficient than land transport. In the early 19th century it cost as much to transport a ton of freight 32 miles by wagon over an unimproved road as it did to ship it 3,000 miles across the Atlantic. A horse could pull at most one ton of freight on a macadam road, which was multi-layer stone covered and crowned, with side drainage. But a single horse could pull a barge weighing over 30 tons.

Commerce was aided by the expansion of roads and inland waterways. Road transport capacity grew from threefold to fourfold from 1500 to 1700. Railroads would eventually reduce the cost of land transport by over 95%.

===Land conversion, drainage and reclamation===
Another way to get more land was to convert some pasture land into arable land and recover fen land and some pastures. It is estimated that the amount of arable land in Britain grew by 10–30% through these land conversions.

The British Agricultural Revolution was aided by land maintenance advancements in Flanders and the Netherlands. With large and dense populations in Flanders and Holland, farmers there were forced to take maximum advantage of every bit of usable land; the country had become a pioneer in canal building, soil restoration and maintenance, soil drainage, and land reclamation technology. Dutch experts like Cornelius Vermuyden brought some of this technology to Britain.

Water-meadows were utilised in the late 16th to the 20th centuries and allowed earlier pasturing of livestock after they were wintered on hay. This increased livestock yields, giving more hides, meat, milk, and manure as well as better hay crops.

===Rise in domestic farmers===
With the development of regional markets and eventually a national market, aided by improved transportation infrastructures, farmers were no longer dependent on their local market and were less subject to having to sell at low prices into an oversupplied local market and not being able to sell their surpluses to distant localities that were experiencing shortages. They also became less subject to price fixing regulations. Farming became a business rather than solely a means of subsistence.

===Selective breeding of livestock===
In England, Robert Bakewell and Thomas Coke introduced selective breeding as a scientific practice, mating together two animals with particularly desirable characteristics and also using inbreeding or the mating of close relatives, such as father and daughter, or brother and sister, to stabilise certain qualities in order to reduce genetic diversity in desirable animal programmes from the mid-18th century. Arguably, Bakewell&#x27;s most important breeding programme was with sheep. Using native stock, he was able to quickly select for large, yet fine-boned sheep, with long, lustrous wool. The Lincoln Longwool was improved by Bakewell, and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed, named the Dishley Leicester. It was hornless and had a square, meaty body with straight top lines.

Bakewell was also the first to breed cattle to be used primarily for beef. Previously, cattle were first and foremost kept for pulling ploughs as oxen or for dairy uses, with beef from surplus males as an additional bonus, but he crossed long-horned heifers and a Westmoreland bull to eventually create the Dishley Longhorn. As more farmers followed his lead, farm animals increased dramatically in size and quality. The average weight of a bull sold for slaughter at Smithfield was reported around 1700 as , though this is considered a low estimate: by 1786, weights of were reported, though other contemporary indicators suggest an increase of around a quarter over the intervening century. In 1300, the average milk cow produced 100 gallons of milk annually. By 1800, this figure rose to 566 gallons.

==19th century==
Besides the organic fertilisers in manure, new fertilisers were slowly discovered. Massive sodium nitrate (NaNO3) deposits found in the Atacama Desert, Chile, were brought under British financiers like John Thomas North and imports were started. Chile was happy to allow the exports of these sodium nitrates by allowing the British to use their capital to develop the mining and imposing a hefty export tax to enrich their treasury. Massive deposits of sea bird guano (11–16% nitrogen, 8–12% phosphate, and 2–3% potassium), were found and started to be imported after about 1830. Significant imports of potash obtained from the ashes of trees burned in opening new agricultural lands were imported.

By-products of the British meat industry like bones from the knackers&#x27; yards were ground up or crushed and sold as fertiliser. By about 1840 about 30,000 tons of bones were being processed (worth about £150,000). An unusual alternative to bones was found to be the millions of tons of fossils called coprolites found in South East England. When these were dissolved in sulphuric acid they yielded a high phosphate mixture (called &quot;super phosphate&quot;) that plants could absorb readily and increased crop yields. Mining coprolite and processing it for fertiliser soon developed into a major industry—the first commercial fertiliser.

Higher yield per acre crops were planted as potatoes went from about 300,000 acres in 1800 to about 400,000 acres in 1850 with a further increase to about 500,000 in 1900. Labour productivity slowly increased at about 0.6% per year. With more capital invested, more organic and inorganic fertilisers, and better crop yields increased the food grown at about 0.5% per year—not enough to keep up with population growth.

Great Britain contained about 10.8 million people in 1801, 20.7 million in 1851 and 37.1 million by 1901. This corresponds to an annual population growth rate of 1.3% in 1801-1851 and 1.2% in 1851–1901, twice the rate of agricultural output growth. In addition to land for cultivation there was also a demand for pasture land to support more livestock. The growth of arable acreage slowed from the 1830s and went into reverse from the 1870s in the face of cheaper grain imports, and wheat acreage nearly halved from 1870 to 1900.

The recovery of food imports after the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) and the resumption of American trade following the War of 1812 (1812–1815) led to the enactment in 1815 of the Corn Laws (protective tariffs) to protect cereal grain producers in Britain against foreign competition. These laws were removed in 1846 after the onset of the Great Irish Famine in which a potato blight ruined most of the Irish potato crop and brought famine to the Irish people from 1846 to 1850. Though the blight also struck Scotland, Wales, England, and much of continental Europe, its effect there was far less severe since potatoes constituted a much smaller percentage of the diet than in Ireland. Hundreds of thousands died in the famine, and millions more emigrated to England, Wales, Scotland, Canada, Australia, Europe, and the United States, reducing the population from about 8.5 million in 1845 to 4.3 million by 1921.

Between 1873 and 1879 British agriculture suffered from wet summers that damaged grain crops. Cattle farmers were hit by foot-and-mouth disease, and sheep farmers by liver rot. The poor harvests, however, masked a greater threat to British agriculture: growing imports of foodstuffs from abroad. The development of the steam ship and the development of extensive railway networks in Britain and in the United States allowed U.S. farmers with much larger and more productive farms to export hard grain to Britain at a price that undercut the British farmers. At the same time, large amounts of cheap corned beef started to arrive from Argentina, and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the development of refrigerator ships (reefers) in about 1880 opened the British market to cheap meat and wool from Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina.

The Long Depression was a worldwide economic recession that began in 1873 and ended around 1896. It hit the agricultural sector hard and was the most severe in Europe and the United States, which had been experiencing strong economic growth fuelled by the Second Industrial Revolution in the decade following the American Civil War. By 1900, half the meat eaten in Britain came from abroad, and tropical fruits such as bananas were also being imported on the refrigerator ships.
===Seed planting===
Before the introduction of the seed drill, the common practice was to plant seeds by broadcasting (evenly throwing) them across the ground by hand on the prepared soil and then lightly harrowing the soil to cover the seed. Seeds left on top of the ground were eaten by birds, insects, and mice. There was no control over spacing, and seeds were planted too close together and too far apart. Alternatively, seeds could be laboriously planted one by one using a hoe and/or a shovel. Cutting down on wasted seed was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five.

The seed drill was introduced from China to Italy in the mid-16th century where it was patented by the Venetian Senate. Jethro Tull invented an improved seed drill in 1701. It was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and at the correct depth. Tull&#x27;s seed drill was expensive and fragile and therefore did not have much of an impact. The technology to manufacture affordable and reliable machinery, including agricultural machinery, improved dramatically in the last half of the 19th century.

==Significance==
The Agricultural Revolution was part of a long process of improvement, but sound advice on farming began to appear in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others, and the overall agricultural productivity of Britain started to grow significantly only in the 18th century. It is estimated that total agricultural output grew 2.7-fold between 1700 and 1870 and output per worker at a similar rate. Despite its name, the Agricultural Revolution in Britain did not result in overall productivity per hectare of agricultural area as high as in China, where intensive cultivation (including multiple annual cropping in many areas) had been practiced for many centuries.

The Agricultural Revolution in Britain proved to be a major turning point in history, allowing the population to far exceed earlier peaks and sustain the country&#x27;s rise to industrial pre-eminence. Towards the end of the 19th century, the substantial gains in British agricultural productivity were rapidly offset by competition from cheaper imports, made possible by the exploitation of new lands and advances in transportation, refrigeration, and other technologies.

The Agricultural Revolution in other countries was a turning point too. In the agrarian societies, four families produced enough food for five families, that is for themselves and one more family. Not much manpower was available for non-agricultural activity. In the course of the revolution, one family began to produce enough food for five families. Much manpower was liberated from agriculture and became available for industry. Thus the Agricultural Revolution made possible the Industrial Revolution:

Unprecedented population growth followed and even more explosive was the growth of the non-agricultural sector. Barrington Moore stressed the &quot;importance of getting rid of agriculture as a major social activity&quot; in the formation of the working class. First, &quot;rural proletariat&quot; appeared; later, this mass moved to cities causing unprecedented urbanization. When the percentage of manpower engaged in agriculture declined from 80 to 60, occurred great social revolutions or reformations (revolution from above). The result was not liberte, egalite, fraternite; often the result was the opposite, with stronger autocracy. But in all cases, the power shifted from land owners to industrial entrepreneurs or central-planning states, marking &quot;revolutionary break with the past.&quot; The ten-millennia Agrarian Age was succeeded by the Industrial Age.

Today, agriculture accounts for 5% of the world product. But these 5% is the basis holding the rest 95% like a reverse pyramid. The Second Agricultural Revolution created this basis and made possible our industry and other sectors of the modern civilization. Without this basis all this civilization, with all its technological progress, would collapse. &quot;No modern development made us independent from Earth Mother, or Pachamama that feeds, as the Inca put it.&quot;

<doc id="174797" wikidata="Q1133627" url="?curid=174797" title="Pool of Radiance">
<text>Pool of Radiance is a role-playing video game developed and published by Strategic Simulations, Inc (SSI) in 1988. It was the first adaptation of TSR&#x27;s &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) fantasy role-playing game for home computers, becoming the first episode in a four-part series of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; computer adventure games. The other games in the &quot;Gold Box&quot; series used the game engine pioneered in &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, as did later &quot;D&amp;D&quot; titles such as the &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; online game. &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; takes place in the Forgotten Realms fantasy setting, with the action centered in and around the port city of Phlan.

Just as in traditional &quot;D&amp;D&quot; games, the player starts by building a party of up to six characters, deciding the race, gender, class, and ability scores for each. The player&#x27;s party is enlisted to help the settled part of the city by clearing out the marauding inhabitants that have taken over the surroundings. The characters move on from one area to another, battling bands of enemies as they go and ultimately confronting the powerful leader of the evil forces. During play, the player characters gain experience points, which allow them to increase their capabilities. The game primarily uses a first-person perspective, with the screen divided into sections to display pertinent textual information. During combat sequences, the display switches to a top-down &quot;video game isometric&quot; view.

Generally well received by the gaming press, &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988&quot;. Some reviewers criticized the game&#x27;s similarities to other contemporary games and its slowness in places, but praised the game&#x27;s graphics and its role-playing adventure and combat aspects. Also well-regarded was the ability to export player characters from &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; to subsequent SSI games in the series.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; is based on the same game mechanics as the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rule set. As in many role-playing games (RPGs), each player character in &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; has a character race and a character class, determined at the beginning of the game. Six races are offered, including elves and halflings, as well as four classes (fighter, cleric, magic-user, and thief). Non-human characters have the option to become multi-classed, which means they gain the capabilities of more than one class, but advance in levels more slowly. During character creation, the computer randomly generates statistics for each character, although the player can alter these attributes. The player also chooses each character&#x27;s alignment, or moral philosophy; while the player controls each character&#x27;s actions, alignment can affect how NPCs view their actions. The player can then customize the appearance and colors of each character&#x27;s combat icon. Alternatively, the player can load a pre-generated party to be used for introductory play. These characters are combined into a party of six or less, while leaving two open slots to add NPCs. Players create their own save-game files, assuring their characters can continue regardless of events in the game. The MS-DOS version can be copied to the hard drive. Other computer systems, such as the Commodore 64, require a separate disk for saved games.
The game&#x27;s exploration mode uses a three-dimensional first-person perspective, with a rectangle in the top left of the screen displaying the party&#x27;s current view; the remainder of the screen displays text information about the party and the area. During gameplay, the player accesses menus to allow characters to use objects; trade items with other characters; parley with opponents; buy or sell items or pool the characters&#x27; money; cast magic spells, and learn new magic skills. Players can view characters&#x27; movement from different angles, such as an aerial view. The game uses three different versions of each sprite to indicate differences between short-, medium-, and long-range encounters.

In combat mode, the screen switches to a top-down perspective with dimetric projection, where the player chooses what actions the characters will take in each round; these actions occur immediately, instead of happening after all commands are issued as is standard in some RPGs. Optionally, the player can let the computer choose character moves for each round. Characters and monsters may make an extra attack on a retreating enemy that moves next to them. If a character&#x27;s hit points (HP) go below zero, another character must bandage the wounded character to prevent their death. The game contains random encounters, and game reviewers for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine observed that random encounters seem to follow standard patterns of encounter tables in pen and paper &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game manuals. They also observed that the depictions of monsters confronting the party &quot;looked as though they had jumped from the pages of the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;&quot;.

Different combat options are available to characters based on class: fighters can use melee or ranged weapons; magic-users can cast spells; thieves are able to &quot;back-stab&quot; opponents by strategically positioning themselves. As fighters progress in level, they can attack more than once in a round, and they also gain the ability to &quot;sweep&quot; enemies, effectively attacking each nearby low-level creature in the same turn. Magic-users and clerics are allowed to memorize and cast a set number of spells each day, and cast spells must be memorized again before reuse; this process requires all characters to rest in a camp for several hours, which also restores lost hit points to damaged characters. This chore of memorizing spells each night significantly added to the amount of game management required by the player.

As characters defeat enemies, they gain experience points (XP). After gaining enough XP, the characters &quot;train up a level&quot; to become more powerful. This training is purchased in special areas within the city walls. In addition to gaining new spells from training, mages can increase their spells known by transcribing spells from scrolls that they find in unsettled areas. Defeated enemies in these areas also contain items such as weapons and armor, which characters can sell to city stores.

== Setting ==

&quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; takes place in the Forgotten Realms fantasy world, in and around the city of Phlan. This is located on the northern shore of the Moonsea along the Barren River, between Zhentil Keep and Melvaunt. The party begins in the civilized section of &quot;New Phlan&quot; that is governed by a council. This portion of the city hosts businesses, including shopkeepers that sell holy items for worshippers at each temple, a jewelry shop, and retailers who provide arms and armor. A party can also contract with the clerk of the city council for various commissions; proclamations posted on the walls within City Hall offer pieces of useful information in the form of coded clues which can be deciphered using the included Adventurer&#x27;s Journal.

Phlan has three temples, each dedicated to different gods. Each temple can heal wounded, poisoned, or afflicted characters, and can restore deceased characters to life for a high price. The party can also visit the hiring hall and hire an experienced NPC adventurer to accompany the party. Encounters with NPCs in shops and taverns offer valuable information. Listening to gossip in taverns can be helpful to characters, although some tavern tales are false and lead characters into great danger.

==Plot==
The ancient trade city of Phlan has fallen into impoverished ruin. Now only a small portion of the city remains inhabited by humans, who are surrounded by evil creatures. To rebuild the city and clean up the Barren River, the city council of New Phlan has decided to recruit adventurers to drive the monsters from the neighboring ruins. Using bards and publications, they spread tales of the riches waiting to be recovered in Phlan, which draws the player&#x27;s party to these shores by ship.

At the start of the game, the adventurers&#x27; ship lands in New Phlan, and they receive a brief but informative tour of the civilized area. They learn that the city is plagued with a history of invasions and wars and has been overtaken by a huge band of humanoids and other creatures. Characters hear rumors that a single controlling element is in charge of these forces. The characters begin a block-by-block quest to rid the ruins of monsters and evil spirits.

Beyond the ruins of old Phlan, the party enters the slum area—one of two quests available right away to new parties. This quest involves the clearing of the slum block and allows a new party to quickly gain experience. The second quest is to clear out Sokol Keep, located on Thorn Island. This fortified area is inhabited by the undead, which can only be defeated with silver weapons and magic. The characters&#x27; adventure is later expanded to encompass the outlying areas of the Moonsea region. Eventually, the player learns that an evil spirit named Tyranthraxus, who has possessed an ancient dragon, is at the root of Phlan&#x27;s problems. The characters fight Tyranthraxus the Flamed One in a climactic final battle.

== Development ==
&quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; was the first official game based on the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules. The scenario was created by TSR designers Jim Ward, David Cook, Steve Winter, and Mike Breault, and coded by programmers from Strategic Simulations, Inc&#x27;s Special Projects team. The section of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; world in which &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; takes place was intended to be reserved for development solely by SSI. The game was created on Apple II and Commodore 64 computers, taking one year with a team of thirty-five people. This game was the first to use the game engine later used in other SSI D&amp;D games known as the &quot;Gold Box&quot; series. The SSI team developing the game was led by Chuck Kroegel. Kroegel stated that the main challenge with the development was interpreting the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; rules to an exact format. Developers also worked to balance the graphics with gameplay to provide a faithful &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; feel, given the restrictions of a home computer. In addition to the core &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; manuals, the books &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; and &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; were also used during development. The images of monsters were adapted directly from the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; book. The game was originally programmed by Keith Brors and Brad Myers, and it was developed by George MacDonald. The game&#x27;s graphic arts were by Tom Wahl, Fred Butts, Darla Marasco, and Susan Halbleib.

&quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; was released in June 1988; it was initially available on the Commodore 64, Apple II series and IBM PC compatible computers. A version for the Atari ST was also announced. The Macintosh version was released in 1989. The Macintosh version featured a slightly different interface and was intended to work on black-and-white Macs like the Mac Plus and the Mac Classic. The screen was tiled into separate windows including the game screen, text console, and compass. Graphics were monochrome and the display window was relatively small compared to other versions. The Macintosh version featured sound, but no music. The game&#x27;s Amiga version was released two years later. The PC 9800 version in Japan was fully translated (like the Japanese Famicom version) and featured full-color graphics. The game was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System under the title &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Pool of Radiance&quot;, released in April 1992. The NES version was the only version of the game to feature a complete soundtrack, which was composed by Seiji Toda, as he was signed to the publisher, Pony Canyon&#x27;s record label at the time. The same soundtrack can be found on the PC-9801 version. The Amiga version also features some extra music, while most other ports contain only one song that plays at the title screen.

The original &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; game shipped with a 28-page introductory booklet, which describes secrets about the game and its concepts. The booklet guides players through the character creation process, explaining how to create a party of adventurers. The game also included the 38-page &quot;Adventurer&#x27;s Journal&quot;, which provides the game&#x27;s background and features depictions of fliers, maps, and information that characters see in the game.

The DOS, Macintosh and Apple II versions of &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; include a 2-ply code wheel for translating Espruar (the elvish language) and Dethek (the dwarven language) runes into English. Some Dethek runes have multiple different translations. After the title screen, a copy protection screen is displayed consisting of two runes and a line of varying appearance (a dotted line, a dashed line, or a line with alternating dots and dashes) which correspond to markings on the code wheel. The player is prompted to enter a five or six character code which corresponds to a five or six character word. In the case of a five character word, there is a number at the beginning of the word which is not entered. Under the lines on the wheel are slots which reveal English letters, the coded English word being determined by lining up the runes, matching the correct line appearance, and then entering the word revealed on the code wheel. If the player enters an incorrect code three times, the game closes itself. In the DOS version of &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, the code wheel is also used for some in-game puzzles. For example, in Sokol Keep the player discovers some parchment with elvish runes on it that require use of the code wheel to decipher; this is optional however, but may be used to avoid some combat with undead if the decoded words are said to them. In the NES version, the elvish words are given to the player deciphered without the use of the code wheel, as the NES release did not include a code wheel.

=== Re-release ===
GOG.com released &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; and many Gold Box series games digitally on August 20, 2015, as a part of &quot;Forgotten Realms: The Archives-Collection Two&quot;. Steam released &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; in 2022.

==Reception==
SSI sold 264,536 copies of &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; for computers in North America, three times that of &quot;Heroes of the Lance&quot;, an AD&amp;D-licensed action game SSI also released that year. It became by far the company&#x27;s most successful game up to that time; even its hint book outsold any earlier SSI game. It spawned a series of games, which combined to sell above 800,000 copies worldwide by 1996.

In &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s preview of &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; in July 1988, the writer noted a &quot;sense of &quot;deja vu&quot;&quot; in the similarity of the game&#x27;s screen to previous computer RPGs. For example, the three-dimensional view like a maze in the upper-left window was similar to &quot;Might &amp; Magic&quot; or &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, both released in the mid-1980s. The window that included a listing of characters was featured in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Wasteland&quot;; and the usage of one active character as a representation of the entire party was part of &quot;Ultima V&quot;. The reviewer also noted that the design approach for game play was &quot;closer to SSI&#x27;s own &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Crown&quot; adventures than to the other games in the genre&quot;.

&quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; received positive reviews. &quot;G.M.&quot; called the game&#x27;s graphics &quot;good&quot; and praised its role-playing and combat aspects. They felt that &quot;roleplayers will find &quot;Pools&quot; is an essential purchase, but people who are solely computer games oriented may hesitate before buying it [...] it will be their loss&quot;. Tony Dillon from &quot;Commodore User&quot; gave it a score of 9 out of 10; the only complaint was a slightly slow disk access, but the reviewer was impressed with the game&#x27;s features, awarding it a &quot;Commodore User&quot; superstar and proclaiming it &quot;the best RPG ever to grace the C64, or indeed any other computer&quot;. Issue #84 of the British magazine &quot;Computer + Video Games&quot; rated the game highly, saying that &quot;&quot;Pools&quot; is a game which no role player or adventurer should be without and people new to role playing should seriously consider buying as an introductory guide&quot;. Another UK publication, &quot;The Games Machine&quot;, gave the game an 89% rating. The reviewer noted that the third-person arcade style combat view is a &quot;great improvement&quot; for SSI, as they would &quot;traditionally incorporate simplistic graphics in their role-playing games&quot;. The reviewer was critical that &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; was &quot;not original in its presentation&quot; and that the colors were &quot;a little drab&quot;, but concluded that the game is &quot;classic &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; which SSI have recreated excellently&quot;. A review from &quot;Zzap&quot; was less positive, giving the game a score of 80%. The reviewer felt that the game required too much &quot;hacking, slicing and chopping&quot; without enough emphasis on puzzle solving. The game was awarded 49% for its puzzle factor.

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #16 (June/July, 1989), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Overall, &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; must be termed a success. It is beautiful to look at, true to its &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; roots, boasts features like automapping and excellent documentation, and has a strong theme to motivate gamers.&quot;

Three reviewers for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; had conflicting reactions. Ken St. Andre—designer of the &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; RPG—approved of the game despite his dislike of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded as &quot;take it from a &#x27;rival&#x27; designer, &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer&quot;. Tracie Forman Hicks, however, opined that over-faithful use of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; system left it behind others like &quot;Ultima&quot; and &quot;Wizardry&quot;. She also disliked the game&#x27;s puzzles and lengthy combat sequences. Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a &quot;well-designed slicer/dicer&quot;, concluding that &quot;patience (possibly of Job) [is] required to get through this one&quot;. Shay Addams from &quot;Compute!&quot; stated that experienced role-playing gamers &quot;won&#x27;t find anything new here&quot;, but recommended it to those who &quot;love dungeons, dragons, and drama&quot;. In their March 1989 &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser gave &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; a three-page review. They praised it as &quot;the first offering that truly follows &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game rules&quot; and advised readers to &quot;rush out to your local dealer and buy &quot;Pool Of Radiance&quot;&quot;, considering it SSI&#x27;s flagship product and speculating that it would &quot;undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR&quot;. The Lessers stated that the Commodore version would be nearly unplayable without the built-in SSI fast loader; conversely, they found that the DOS version was so fast—twice the speed of the Commodore version when using [[EGA graphics—that the Lessers had to slow the computer to read all the on-screen messages.

Alex Simmons, Doug Johns, and Andy Mitchell reviewed the Amiga version of &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; for &quot;Amiga Action&quot; magazine in 1990, giving it a 79% overall rating. Mitchell preferred the game &quot;[[Champions of Krynn]]&quot;, which had been released by the time the Amiga version of &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; became available; he felt that &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; was &quot;more of the same&quot; when compared to &quot;Champions&quot;, but was less playable and with more limited actions for players. Simmons felt that &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; looked primitive and seemed less polished when compared with &quot;Champions of Krynn&quot;; he felt that although &quot;Pool&quot; was not up to the standard of &quot;Champions&quot;, he said it was still &quot;a fine little game&quot;. Johns, on the other hand, felt that &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; was well worth the wait, considering it very user-friendly despite being less polished than &quot;Champions of Krynn&quot;.

[[Lisa Stevens]] reviewed the Macintosh version of &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; in &quot;[[White Wolf (magazine)|White Wolf]]&quot; #26 (April/May, 1991), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;I can&#x27;t recommend &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; highly enough to Macintosh users, and especially players who are familiar with the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game system. SSI has thrown down the gauntlet for the other computer game companies who are catering to the growing Macintosh market. I hope the other companies take up the challenge and produce games of this caliber.&quot;

&quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; was well received by the gaming press and won the [[Origins Award]] for &quot;Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988&quot;. For the second annual &quot;Beastie Awards&quot; in 1989, &quot;Dragon&quot;″s readers voted &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; the best fantasy role-playing game, with &quot;Ultima V&quot; as the runner-up for the year. The Apple II version was the most popular format, with the PC DOS/MS-DOS version a close second, and the Commodore 64/128 version got the fewest votes. The primary factor given for votes was its faithfulness to the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; system as well as the game&#x27;s graphics and easy-to-use [[user interface]] for commands. &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; was also selected for the [[RPGA]]-sponsored Gamers&#x27; Choice Awards for the Best Computer Game of 1989. In 1990 the game received the fifth-highest number of votes in a survey of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; readers&#x27; &quot;All-Time Favorites&quot;.

Allen Rausch, writing for [[GameSpy]]&#x27;s 2004 retrospective &quot;A History of D&amp;D Video Games&quot;, concluded that although the game &quot;certainly had its flaws (horrendous load times, interface weirdness, and a low-level cap among others), it was a huge, expansive adventure that laid a good foundation for every Gold Box game that followed&quot;. In 1994, &quot;[[PC Gamer US]]&quot; named &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; the 43rd best computer game ever.

IGN ranked &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; No. 3 on their list of &quot;The Top 11 Dungeons &amp; Dragons Games of All Time&quot; in 2014. In March 2008, [[Dvice.com]] listed &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; among its 13 best electronic versions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The contributor felt that &quot;the Pool of Radiance series set the stage for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; to make a major splash in the video game world&quot;. Ian Williams of &quot;[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]&quot; rated the game #5 on his list of &quot;The 10 Greatest Dungeons and Dragons Videogames&quot; in 2015.

== Sequels and related works ==
In November 1989, a [[novelization]] of the game, also called &quot;[[Pool of Radiance (novel)|Pool of Radiance]]&quot;, was published by James Ward and Jane Cooper Hong, published by TSR. It is set in the Forgotten Realms setting based on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game. &quot;Dragon&quot; described the novel&#x27;s plot: &quot;Five companions find themselves in the unenviable position of defending the soon-to-be ghost town against a rival possessing incredible power&quot;. The book was the first in a trilogy, followed by &quot;[[Pools of Darkness (novel)|Pools of Darkness]]&quot; and &quot;[[Pool of Twilight]]&quot;.

&quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; was the first in a four-part series of computer &quot;D&amp;D&quot; adventures set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. The others were released by SSI one year apart: &quot;[[Curse of the Azure Bonds]]&quot; (1989), &quot;[[Secret of the Silver Blades]]&quot; (1990), and &quot;[[Pools of Darkness]]&quot; (1991). The 1989 game &quot;[[Hillsfar]]&quot; was also created by SSI but was not a sequel to &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;. &quot;Hillsfar&quot; is described instead, by the reviewers from &quot;Dragon&quot;, as &quot;a value-added adventure for those who would like to take a side trip while awaiting the sequel&quot;. A player can import characters from &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; into &quot;Hillsfar&quot;, although the characters are &quot;reduced to their basic levels&quot; and do not retain any weapons or [[Magic item (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|magic items]]. Original &quot;Hillsfar&quot; characters cannot be exported to &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, but they can be exported to &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot;. A review for &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; noted that &quot;you can transfer your characters from &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; and it&#x27;s a good idea to do so. It will give you a headstart in the game&quot;.

[[GameSpot]] declared that &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, thanks to its detailed art, variety of quests and available treasure, and tactical combat system, and despite the limitations of only four allowed character classes and the low maximum character level, &quot;ultimately succeeded in its goal of bringing a standardized form of AD&amp;D to the home computer, and laid the foundation for other future gold box AD&amp;D role-playing games&quot;. Scott Battaglia of [[GameSpy]] said &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; is &quot;what many gamers consider to be the epitome of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; RPGs. These games were so great that people today are using MoSlo in droves to slow down their [[Pentium III]]-1000 MHz enough to play these gems&quot;.

The 1988 &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game [[Adventure (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|module]] &quot;[[Ruins of Adventure]]&quot; was produced using the same adventure scenario as &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, including its plot, background, and setting, as well as many of its characters, thus providing clues on how to complete missions in &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;. &quot;Ruins of Adventure&quot; contains four linked mini-scenarios, which form the core of &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;. According to the editors of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; was based on &quot;Ruins of Adventure&quot;, rather than the module being based on the computer game, but Mike Breault stated in a 2021 interview that TSR chose him, Winter, Cook, and Ward to work on the design and writing for &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, indicating that the material was originally created for the game.

&quot;[[The Forgotten Realms Atlas]]&quot; (1990) has many maps covering the Forgotten Realms, including regions in &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;. It is out of print and is prized by collectors.

<text>Generic map of a medieval [[Manorialism|manor]], showing strip farming. The mustard-colored areas are part of the [[Open-field system|[[demesne]]]], the [[hatching|hatched]] areas part of the [[Open-field system|[[glebe]]]]. William R. Shepherd, &quot;Historical Atlas&quot;, 1923
The open-field system was the prevalent agricultural system in much of Europe during the Middle Ages and lasted into the 20th century in Russia, Iran, and Turkey. Each manor or village had two or three large fields, usually several hundred acres each, which were divided into many narrow strips of land. The strips or selions were cultivated by peasants, often called tenants or serfs. The holdings of a manor also included woodland and pasture areas for common usage and fields belonging to the lord of the manor and the religious authorities, usually Roman Catholics in medieval Western Europe. The farmers customarily lived in separate houses in a nucleated village with a much larger manor house and church nearby. The open-field system necessitated co-operation among the residents of the manor.

The Lord of the Manor, his officials, and a manorial court administered the manor and exercised jurisdiction over the peasantry. The Lord levied rents and required the peasantry to work on his personal lands, called a demesne.

In medieval times, little land was owned outright. Instead, generally the lord had rights given to him by the king, and the tenant rented land from the lord. Lords demanded rents and labour from the tenants, but the tenants had firm user rights to cropland and common land and those rights were passed down from generation to generation. A medieval lord could not evict a tenant nor hire labour to replace him without legal cause. Most tenants likewise were not free without penalty to depart the manor for other locations or occupations. The rise of capitalism and the concept of land as a commodity to be bought and sold led to the gradual demise of the open-field system. The open-field system was gradually replaced over several centuries by private ownership of land, especially after the 15th century in the process known as enclosure in England. France, Germany, and other northern European countries had systems similar to England, although open fields generally endured longer on the continent. 

Some elements of the open-field system were practised by early settlers in the New England region of the United States.

==Description==

The most visible characteristic of the open-field system was that the arable land belonging to a manor was divided into many long narrow furlongs for cultivation. The fields of cultivated land were unfenced, hence the name &quot;open&quot;-field system. Each tenant of the manor cultivated several strips of land scattered around the manor.

The village of Elton, Cambridgeshire, is representative of a medieval open-field manor in England. The manor, whose Lord was an abbot from a nearby monastery, had 13 &quot;hides&quot; of arable land of six virgates each. The acreage of a hide and virgate varied; but at Elton, a hide was and a virgate was . Thus, the total of arable land amounted to . The abbot&#x27;s demesne land consisted of three hides plus of meadow and of pasture. The remainder of the land was cultivated by 113 tenants who lived in a village on the manor. Counting spouses, children, and other dependents, plus landless people, the total population resident in the manor village was probably 500 to 600.

The abbot also owned two water mills for grinding grain, a fulling mill for finishing cloth, and a millpond on the manor. The village contained a church, a manor house, a village green, and the sub-manor of John of Elton, a rich farmer who cultivated one hide of land and had tenants of his own. The tenants&#x27; houses lined a road rather than being grouped in a cluster. Some of the village houses were fairly large, long by wide. Others were only long and wide. All were insubstantial and required frequent reconstruction. Most of the tenants&#x27; houses had outbuildings and an animal pen with a larger area, called a croft, of about one-half acre (0.2 ha), enclosed for a garden and grazing for animals.

The tenants on the manor did not have equal holdings of land. About one-half of adults living on a manor had no land at all and had to work for larger landholders for their livelihood. A survey of 104 13th-century manors in England found that, among the landholding tenants, 45 percent had less than . To survive, they also had to work for larger landowners. 22 percent of tenants had a virgate of land (which varied in size between and and 31 percent had one-half virgate. To rely on the land for a livelihood a tenant family needed at least .

The land of a typical manor in England and other countries was subdivided into two or three large fields. Non-arable land was allocated to common pasture land or &quot;waste&quot;, where the villagers would graze their livestock throughout the year, woodland for pigs and timber, and also some private fenced land (paddocks, orchards and gardens), called &quot;closes&quot;. The ploughed fields and the meadows were used for livestock grazing when fallowed or after the grain was harvested.

One of the two or three fields was fallowed each year to recover soil fertility. The fields were divided into parcels called furlongs. The furlong was further subdivided into long, thin strips of land called selions or ridges. Selions were distributed among the farmers of the village, the manor, and the church. A family might possess about 70 selions totalling about scattered around the fields. The scattered nature of family holdings ensured that families each received a ration of both good and poor land and minimised risk. If some selions were unproductive, others might be productive. Ploughing techniques created a landscape of ridge and furrow, with furrows between ridges dividing holdings and aiding drainage.

The right of pasture on fallowed fields, land unsuitable for cultivation, and harvested fields was held in common with rules to prevent overgrazing enforced by the community.

==Crops and production==

The typical planting scheme in a three-field system was that barley, oats, or legumes would be planted in one field in spring, wheat or rye in the second field in the fall and the third field would be left fallow. The following year, the planting in the fields would be rotated. Pasturage was held in common. The tenants pastured their livestock on the fallow field and on the planted fields after harvest. An elaborate set of laws and controls, partly set by the Lord of the Manor and partly by the tenants themselves regulated planting, harvest, and pasturing.

Wheat and barley were the most important crops with roughly equal amounts planted on the average in England. Annual wheat production at Battle Abbey in Sussex in the late 14th century ranged from 2.26 to 5.22 seeds harvested for every seed planted, averaging 4.34 seeds harvested for every seed planted. Barley production averaged 4.01 and oats 2.87 seeds harvested for seeds planted. This translates into yields of 7 to 17 bushels per acre harvested. Battle Abbey may have been atypical, with better management and soils than typical of demesnes in open-field areas. Barley was used in making beer – consumed in large quantities – and mixed with other grains to produce bread that was a dietary staple for the poorer farmers. Wheat was often sold as a cash crop. Richer people ate bread made of wheat. At Elton in Cambridgeshire in 1286, perhaps typical of that time in England, the tenants harvested about twice as much barley as wheat with lesser amounts of oats, peas, beans, rye, flax, apples, and vegetables.

The land-holding tenants also had livestock, including sheep, pigs, cattle, horses, oxen, and poultry. Pork was the principal meat eaten; sheep were primarily raised for their wool, a cash crop. Only a few rich landholders had enough horses and oxen to make up a ploughing-team of six to eight oxen or horses, so sharing among neighbours was essential.

==History==
Much of the land in the open-field system during medieval times had been cultivated for hundreds of years earlier on Roman estates or by farmers belonging to one of the ethnic groups of Europe. There are hints of a proto-open-field system going back to AD 98 among the Germanic tribes. Germanic and Anglo-Saxon invaders and settlers possibly brought the open-field system to France and England after the 5th century AD. The open-field system appears to have developed to maturity between AD 850 and 1150 in England, although documentation is scarce prior to the Domesday Book of 1086.

The open-field system was never practiced in all regions and countries in Europe. It was most common in heavily populated and productive agricultural regions. In England, the south-east, notably parts of Essex and Kent, retained a pre-Roman system of farming in small, square, enclosed fields. In much of eastern and western England, fields were similarly either never open or were enclosed earlier. The primary area of open fields was in the lowland areas of England in a broad swathe from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire diagonally across England to the south, taking in parts of Norfolk and Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, large areas of the Midlands, and most of south central England. This area was the main grain-growing region (as opposed to pastoral farming) in medieval times.

The population in Europe grew in the early centuries of the open-field system, doubling in Britain between 1086 and 1300, which required increased agricultural production and more intensive cultivation of farmland. The open-field system was generally not practised in marginal agricultural areas or in hilly and mountainous regions. Open fields were well suited to the dense clay soils common in northwestern Europe. Heavy ploughs were needed to cut through the soil and the ox or horse teams which pulled the ploughs were expensive, and thus both animals and ploughs were often shared by necessity among farm families.

The Black Death of 1348–1350 killed 30–60% of Europe&#x27;s population. As a consequence the surviving population had access to larger tracts of empty farmland and wages increased due to a shortage of labour. Richer farmers began to acquire land and remove it from communal usage. An economic recession and low grain prices in fifteenth century England gave a competitive advantage to the production of wool, meat, and milk. The shift away from grain to livestock accelerated enclosure of fields. The steadily increasing number of formerly open fields converted to enclosed (fenced) fields caused social and economic stress among small farmers who lost their access to communal grazing lands. Many tenants were forced off the lands their families may have cultivated for centuries to work for wages in towns and cities. The number of large and middle-sized estates grew in number while small land-holders decreased in number. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, the practice of enclosure (particularly depopulating enclosure) was denounced by the Church and the government, and legislation was drawn up against it. The dispossession of tenants from their land created an &quot;epidemic of vagrancy&quot; in England in the late 16th and early 17th century. The tide of elite opinion began to turn towards support for enclosure, and the rate of enclosure increased in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

==Controversies and inefficiencies==

The open-field system is considered by many economists to have been inefficient for agricultural production and resistant to technological innovation. &quot;Everyone was forced to conform to village norms of cropping, harvesting, and building.&quot; The communal institutions, the manorial court, and the tenants regulated agricultural practices and economic behaviour. The manorial lord exercised control over the tenants by extracting rent for land or labour to cultivate his demesne lands. The scattered holdings of each farmer increased the time needed to travel to and from fields.

The open-field system, especially its characteristic of common grazing lands, has often been used as an example by economists to illustrate &quot;the tragedy of the commons&quot; and assert that private ownership is a better steward of resources than common or public ownership. &quot;Tragedy of the commons&quot; refers to the alleged destruction of common pastures in England as a result of overgrazing, each tenant maximizing his gain by grazing as many animals as possible and ignoring the long-term impact of overgrazing. The author of the term &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;, Garrett Hardin, pointed out that the pastures of England were &quot;protected from ruin by limiting each tenant to a fixed number of animals&quot;. Thus, Hardin says the commons were &quot;managed...which may be good or bad depending on the quality of the management&quot;. 

The fact that the open-field system endured for roughly a thousand years over a large part of Europe and provided a livelihood to a growing population indicates that there might not have been a better way of organizing agriculture during that time period. However, some argue that the pastures of England were actually highly managed; they were considered to be privately owned by the village as a whole, which led to a communal sense of responsibility to maintaining the land. Managerial practices such as stinting, or limiting the amount of cattle permitted, required weed removal, removal of straw, cutting thistles, ringing swine, and knobbing cow&#x27;s horns to prevent grubbing were common. The commons were regularly inspected by the villagers and sometimes by a delegation from the manorial court. It is even argued that the commons that Hardin was referring to in &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot; were actually pre-enclosure commons, which were not true commons, but rather left over lands that were misused by the poor, displaced, and criminals.

The replacement of the open-field system by privately owned property was fiercely resisted by many elements of society. Karl Marx was extremely opposed to the enclosure of the open field system, calling it a &quot;robbery of the common lands&quot;. The &quot;brave new world&quot; of a harsher, more competitive and capitalistic society from the 16th century onward destroyed the securities and certainties of land tenure in the open-field system. The open field system died only slowly. More than half the agricultural land of England was still not enclosed in 1700, after which the government discouraged the continuation of the open-field system. It was finally laid to rest in England about 1850 after more than 5,000 Acts of Parliament and just as many voluntary agreements over several centuries had transformed the &quot;scattered plots in the open fields&quot; into unambiguous private and enclosed properties free of village and communal control and use. Over half of all agricultural land in England was enclosed during the 18th and 19th centuries. Other European countries also began to pass legislation to eliminate the scattering of farm land, the Netherlands and France passing laws making land consolidation compulsory in the 1930s and 1950s respectively. In Russia, the open-field system, called &quot;cherespolositsa&quot; (&quot;alternating ribbons (of land)&quot;) and administered by the &quot;obshchina / mir&quot; (the general village community), remained as the main system of peasant land ownership in Russia until the Stolypin reform process that started in 1905, but generally continued for many years, finally ending only with the Soviet policy of collectivisation in the 1930s.

==Modern usage==

One place in England where the open-field system continues to be used is the village of Laxton, Nottinghamshire. It is thought that its anomalous survival is due to the inability of two early 19th-century landowners to agree on how the land was to be enclosed, thus resulting in the perpetuation of the existing system.

The only other surviving medieval open strip field system in England is in Braunton, North Devon. It is still farmed with due regard to its ancient origins and is conserved by those who recognise its importance although the number of owners has fallen dramatically throughout the years and this has resulted in the amalgamation of some of the strips.

There is also a surviving medieval open strip field system in Wales in the township of Laugharne, which is also the last town in the UK with an intact medieval charter.

Vestiges of an open-field system also persist in the Isle of Axholme, North Lincolnshire, around the villages of Haxey, Epworth and Belton, where long strips, of an average size of half an acre, curve to follow the gently sloping ground and are used for growing vegetables or cereal crops. The boundaries are mostly unmarked, although where several strips have been amalgamated a deep furrow is sometimes used to divide them. The ancient village game of Haxey Hood is played in this open landscape.

===Allotment gardens===

A similar system to open fields survives in the United Kingdom as allotment gardens. In many towns and cities, areas of land of one or two acres (up to about one hectare) are interspersed between the buildings. These areas are usually owned by local authorities or by allotment associations. Small patches of the land are allocated at a low rent to people for growing food.

<text>A Red Scare is a form of moral panic provoked by fear of the rise, supposed or real, of left-wing ideologies in a society, especially communism and socialism. Historically, red scares have led to mass political persecution, scapegoating, and the ousting of those in government positions who have had connections with left-wing movements. The name is derived from the red flag, a common symbol of communism and socialism.

The term is most often used to refer to two periods in the history of the United States which are referred to by this name. The First Red Scare, which occurred immediately after World War I, revolved around a perceived threat from the American labor movement, anarchist revolution, and political radicalism that followed revolutionary socialist movements in Germany and Russia during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The Second Red Scare, which occurred immediately after World War II, was preoccupied with the perception that national or foreign communists were infiltrating or subverting American society and the federal government. Following the end of the Cold War, unearthed documents revealed substantial Soviet spy activity in the United States, although many of the agents were never properly identified by Senator Joseph McCarthy.

==First Red Scare (1917–1920)==

The first Red Scare in the United States accompanied the Russian Revolution (specifically the October Revolution) and the Revolutions of 1917–1923. Citizens of the United States in the years of World War I (1914–1918) were intensely patriotic; anarchist and left-wing social agitation aggravated national, social, and political tensions. Political scientist and former Communist Party USA member Murray Levin wrote that the Red Scare was &quot;a nationwide anti-radical hysteria provoked by a mounting fear and anxiety that a Bolshevik revolution in America was imminent—a revolution that would change Church, home, marriage, civility, and the American way of Life&quot;. News media exacerbated such fears, channeling them into anti-foreign sentiment due to the lively debate among recent immigrants from Europe regarding various forms of anarchism as possible solutions to widespread poverty. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), also known as the Wobblies, backed several labor strikes in 1916 and 1917. These strikes covered a wide range of industries including steel working, shipbuilding, coal mining, copper mining, and others necessary for wartime activities.

After World War I ended (November 1918), the number of strikes increased to record levels in 1919, with more than 3,600 separate strikes by a wide range of workers, e.g. steel workers, railroad shop workers, and the Boston police department. The press portrayed these worker strikes as &quot;radical threats to American society&quot; inspired by &quot;left-wing, foreign &quot;agents provocateurs&quot;&quot;. The IWW and those sympathetic to workers claimed that the press &quot;misrepresented legitimate labor strikes&quot; as &quot;crimes against society&quot;, &quot;conspiracies against the government&quot;, and &quot;plots to establish communism&quot;. Opponents of labor viewed strikes as an extension of the radical, anarchist foundations of the IWW, which contends that all workers should be united as a social class and that capitalism and the wage system should be abolished.

In June 1917, as a response to World War I, Congress passed the Espionage Act to prevent any information relating to national defense from being used to harm the United States or to aid her enemies. The Wilson administration used this act to make anything &quot;urging treason&quot; a &quot;nonmailable matter&quot;. Due to the Espionage Act and the then Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson, 74 separate newspapers were not being mailed.
In April 1919, authorities discovered a plot for mailing 36 bombs to prominent members of the U.S. political and economic establishment: J. P. Morgan Jr., John D. Rockefeller, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, U.S. Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer, and immigration officials. On June 2, 1919, in eight cities, eight bombs exploded simultaneously. One target was the Washington, D.C., house of U.S. Attorney General Palmer, where the explosion killed the bomber, who (evidence indicated) was an Italian-American radical from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Afterwards, Palmer ordered the U.S. Justice Department to launch the Palmer Raids (1919–21). He deported 249 Russian immigrants on the &quot;Soviet Ark&quot;, formed the General Intelligence Unit – a precursor to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) – within the Department of Justice, and used federal agents to jail more than 5,000 citizens and to search homes without respecting their constitutional rights.

In 1918, before the bombings, President Woodrow Wilson had pressured Congress to legislate the anti-anarchist Sedition Act of 1918 to protect wartime morale by deporting putatively undesirable political people. Law professor David D. Cole reports that President Wilson&#x27;s &quot;federal government consistently targeted alien radicals, deporting them... for their speech or associations, making little effort to distinguish terrorists from ideological dissidents&quot;. President Wilson used the Sedition Act of 1918 to limit the exercise of free speech by criminalizing language deemed disloyal to the United States government.

Initially, the press praised the raids; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated: &quot;There is no time to waste on hairsplitting over [the] infringement of liberty&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the injuries inflicted upon the arrested were &quot;souvenirs of the new attitude of aggressiveness which had been assumed by the Federal agents against Reds and suspected-Reds&quot;. In the event, twelve publicly prominent lawyers characterized the Palmer Raids as unconstitutional. The critics included future Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, who published &quot;A Report on the Illegal Practices of The United States Department of Justice&quot;, documenting systematic violations of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution via Palmer-authorized &quot;illegal acts&quot; and &quot;wanton violence&quot;. Defensively, Palmer then warned that a government-deposing left-wing revolution would begin on 1 May 1920—May Day, the International Workers&#x27; Day. When it failed to happen, he was ridiculed and lost much credibility. Strengthening the legal criticism of Palmer was that fewer than 600 deportations were substantiated with evidence, out of the thousands of resident aliens arrested and deported. In July 1920, Palmer&#x27;s once-promising Democratic Party bid for the U.S. presidency failed. Wall Street was bombed on September 16, 1920, near Federal Hall National Memorial and the JP Morgan Bank. Although both anarchists and communists were suspected as being responsible for the bombing, ultimately no individuals were indicted for the bombing, in which 38 died and 141 were injured.

In 1919–20, several states enacted &quot;criminal syndicalism&quot; laws outlawing advocacy of violence in effecting and securing social change. The restrictions included limitations on free speech. Passage of these laws, in turn, provoked aggressive police investigation of the accused persons, their jailing, and deportation for being &quot;suspected&quot; of being either communist or left-wing. Regardless of ideological gradation, the Red Scare did not distinguish between communism, anarchism, socialism, or social democracy. This aggressive crackdown on certain ideologies resulted in many Supreme Court cases over free speech. In the 1919 case of &quot;Schenk v. United States&quot;, the Supreme Court, introducing the clear-and-present-danger test, effectively deemed the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 constitutional.

==Second Red Scare (1947–1957)==

The second Red Scare occurred after World War II (1939–1945), and is known as &quot;McCarthyism&quot; after its best-known advocate, Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthyism coincided with an increased and widespread fear of communist espionage that was consequent of the increasing tension in the Cold War through the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe, the Berlin Blockade (1948–49), the end of the Chinese Civil War, the confessions of spying for the Soviet Union that were made by several high-ranking U.S. government officials, and the outbreak of the Korean War.

===Internal causes of the anti-communist fear===
The events of the late 1940s, the early 1950s—the trial of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg (1953), the trial of Alger Hiss, the Iron Curtain (1945–1991) around Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union&#x27;s first nuclear weapon test in 1949 (RDS-1)—surprised the American public, influencing popular opinion about U.S. national security, which, in turn, was connected to the fear that the Soviet Union would drop nuclear bombs on the United States, and fear of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA).

In Canada, the 1946 Kellock–Taschereau Commission investigated espionage after top-secret documents concerning RDX, radar and other weapons were handed over to the Soviets by a domestic spy-ring.

At the House Un-American Activities Committee, former CPUSA members and NKVD spies, Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Chambers, testified that Soviet spies and communist sympathizers had penetrated the U.S. government before, during and after World War II. Other U.S. citizen spies confessed to their acts of espionage in situations where the statute of limitations on prosecuting them had run out. In 1949, anti-communist fear, and fear of American traitors, was aggravated by the Chinese Communists winning the Chinese Civil War against the Western-sponsored Kuomintang, their founding of the Communist China, and later China intervenes (October–December 1950) in the Korean War (1950–1953) against U.S. ally South Korea.

A few of the events during the Red Scare were also due to a power struggle between director of FBI J. Edgar Hoover and the Central Intelligence Agency. Hoover had instigated and aided some of the investigations of members of the CIA with &quot;leftist&quot; history, like Cord Meyer. This conflict could also be traced back to the conflict between Hoover and William J. Donovan, going back to the first Red Scare, but especially during World War II. Donovan ran the OSS (CIA&#x27;s predecessor). They had differing opinions on the nature of the alliance with the Soviet Union, conflicts over jurisdiction, conflicts of personality, the OSS hiring of communists and criminals as agents, etc.

Historian Richard Powers distinguishes two main forms of anti-communism during the period, liberal anti-communism and countersubversive anti-communism. The countersubversives, he argues, derived from a pre-WWII isolationist tradition on the right. Liberal anti-communists believed that political debate was enough to show Communists as disloyal and irrelevant, while countersubversive anticommunists believed that Communists had to be exposed and punished. At times, countersubversive anticommunists accused liberals of being &quot;equally destructive&quot; as Communists due to an alleged lack of religious values or supposed &quot;red web&quot; infiltration into the New Deal.

Much evidence for Soviet espionage existed, according to Democratic Senator and historian Daniel Moynihan, with the Venona project consisting of &quot;overwhelming proof of the activities of Soviet spy networks in America, complete with names, dates, places, and deeds.&quot; However, Moynihan argued that because sources like the Venona project were kept secret for so long, &quot;ignorant armies clashed by night&quot;. With McCarthy advocating an extremist view, the discussion of communist subversion was made into a civil rights issue instead of a counterintelligence one. This historiographical perspective is shared by historians John Earl Haynes and Robert Louis Benson. While President Truman formulated the Truman Doctrine against Soviet expansion, it is possible he was not fully informed of the Venona intercepts, leaving him unaware of the domestic extent of espionage, according to Moynihan and Benson.

=== History ===
==== Early years ====
By the 1930s, communism had become an attractive economic ideology, particularly among labor leaders and intellectuals. By 1939, the CPUSA had about 50,000 members. In 1940, soon after World War II began in Europe, the U.S. Congress legislated the Alien Registration Act (also known as the Smith Act, 18 USC § 2385) making it a crime to &quot;knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise or teach the duty, necessity, desirability or propriety of overthrowing the Government of the United States or of any State by force or violence, or for anyone to organize any association which teaches, advises or encourages such an overthrow, or for anyone to become a member of or to affiliate with any such association&quot;—and required Federal registration of all foreign nationals. Although principally deployed against communists, the Smith Act was also used against right-wing political threats such as the German-American Bund, and the perceived racial disloyalty of the Japanese-American population (&quot;cf.&quot; hyphenated-Americans).

==== World War II ====

After the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany on August 23, 1939, negative attitudes towards communists in the United States were on the rise. While the American communist party at first attacked Germany for its September 1, 1939 invasion of western Poland, on September 11 it received a blunt directive from Moscow denouncing the Polish government. On September 17, the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland and occupied the Polish territory assigned to it by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, followed by co-ordination with German forces in Poland. The CPUSA turned the focus of its public activities from anti-fascism to advocating peace, not only opposing military preparations, but also condemning those opposed to Hitler. The party did not at first attack President Roosevelt, reasoning that this could devastate American Communism, blaming instead Roosevelt&#x27;s advisors.

On November 30, when Soviet Union attacked Finland and after forced mutual assistance pacts from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Communist Party considered Russian security sufficient justification to support the actions. Secret short wave radio broadcasts in October from Comintern leader Georgi Dimitrov ordered CPUSA leader Earl Browder to change the party&#x27;s support for Roosevelt. On October 23, the party began attacking Roosevelt. The party was active in the isolationist America First Committee. The CPUSA also dropped its boycott of Nazi goods, spread the slogans &quot;The Yanks Are Not Coming&quot; and &quot;Hands Off&quot;, set up a &quot;perpetual peace vigil&quot; across the street from the White House and announced that Roosevelt was the head of the &quot;war party of the American bourgeoisie&quot;. By April 1940, the party &quot;Daily Worker&quot;&#x27;s line seemed not so much antiwar as simply pro-German. A pamphlet stated the Jews had just as much to fear from Britain and France as they did Germany. In August 1940, after NKVD agent Ramón Mercader killed Trotsky with an ice axe, Browder perpetuated Moscow&#x27;s fiction that the killer, who had been dating one of Trotsky&#x27;s secretaries, was a disillusioned follower.

In allegiance to the Soviet Union, the party changed this policy again after Hitler broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact by attacking the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. The CPUSA opposed labor strikes in the weapons industry and supporting the U.S. war effort against the Axis Powers. With the slogan &quot;Communism is Twentieth-Century Americanism&quot;, the chairman, Earl Browder, advertised the CPUSA&#x27;s integration to the political mainstream. In contrast, the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party opposed U.S. participation in the war and supported labor strikes, even in the war-effort industry. For this reason, James P. Cannon and other SWP leaders were convicted per the Smith Act.

==== Increasing tension ====

In March 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9835, creating the &quot;Federal Employees Loyalty Program&quot; establishing political-loyalty review boards who determined the &quot;Americanism&quot; of Federal Government employees, and requiring that all federal employees to take an oath of loyalty to the United States government. It then recommended termination of those who had confessed to spying for the Soviet Union, as well as some suspected of being &quot;Un-American&quot;. This led to more than 2,700 dismissals and 12,000 resignations from the years 1947 to 1956. It also was the template for several state legislatures&#x27; loyalty acts, such as California&#x27;s Levering Act. The House Committee on Un-American Activities was created during the Truman administration as a response to allegations by Republicans of disloyalty in Truman&#x27;s administration. The House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and the committees of Senator Joseph McCarthy (R., Wisc.) conducted character investigations of &quot;American communists&quot; (actual and alleged), and their roles in (real and imaginary) espionage, propaganda, and subversion favoring the Soviet Union—in the process revealing the extraordinary breadth of the Soviet spy network in infiltrating the federal government. The process also launched the successful political careers of Richard Nixon and Robert F. Kennedy, as well as that of Joseph McCarthy. The HUAC held a large interest in investigating those in the entertainment industry in Hollywood. They interrogated actors, writers, and producers. The people who cooperated in the investigations got to continue working as they had been, but people who refused to cooperate were blacklisted. Critics of the HUAC claim their tactics were an abuse of government power and resulted in a witch hunt that disregarded citizens’ rights and ruined their careers and reputations. Critics claim the internal witch hunt was a use for personal gain to spread influence for government officials by intensifying the fear of Communists infiltrating the country. Supporters, however, believe the actions of the HUAC were justified given the level of threat Communism posed to democracy in the United States.

Senator McCarthy stirred up further fear in the United States of communists infiltrating the country by saying that communist spies were omnipresent, and he was America&#x27;s only salvation, using this fear to increase his own influence. In 1950 Joseph McCarthy addressed the senate, citing 81 separate cases, and made accusations against suspected communists. Although he provided little or no evidence, this prompted the Senate to call for a full investigation.

Senator McCarran introduced the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950 that was passed by the U.S. Congress and which modified a great deal of law to restrict civil liberties in the name of security. President Truman declared the act a &quot;mockery of the Bill of Rights&quot; and a &quot;long step toward totalitarianism&quot; because it represented a government restriction on the freedom of opinion. He vetoed the act but his veto was overridden by Congress. Much of the bill eventually was repealed.

The formal establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949 and the beginning of the Korean War in 1950 meant that Asian Americans, especially those of Chinese or Korean descent, came under increasing suspicion by both American civilians and government officials of being Communist sympathizers. Simultaneously, some American politicians saw the prospect of American-educated Chinese students bringing their knowledge back to &quot;Red China&quot; as an unacceptable threat to American national security, and laws such as the China Aid Act of 1950 and the Refugee Relief Act of 1953 gave significant assistance to Chinese students who wished to settle in the United States. Despite being naturalized, however, Chinese immigrants continued to face suspicion of their allegiance. The general effect, according to University of Wisconsin-Madison scholar Qing Liu, was to simultaneously demand that Chinese (and other Asian) students politically support the American government yet avoid engaging directly in politics.

The Second Red Scare profoundly altered the temper of American society. Its later characterizations may be seen as contributory to works of feared communist espionage, such as the film &quot;My Son John&quot; (1952), about parents&#x27; suspicions their son is a spy. Abundant accounts in narrative forms contained themes of the infiltration, subversion, invasion, and destruction of American society by un–American &quot;thought&quot;. Even a baseball team, the Cincinnati Reds, temporarily renamed themselves the &quot;Cincinnati Redlegs&quot; to avoid the money-losing and career-ruining connotations inherent in being ball-playing &quot;Reds&quot; (communists). In 1954, Congress passed the Communist Control Act of 1954, which prevented members of the communist party in America from holding office in labor unions and other labor organizations.

==== Wind down ====
Examining the political controversies of the 1940s and 1950s, historian John Earl Haynes, who studied the Venona decryptions extensively, argued that Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s attempts to &quot;make anti-communism a partisan weapon&quot; actually &quot;threatened [the post-War] anti-Communist consensus&quot;, thereby ultimately harming anti-communist efforts more than helping them. Meanwhile, the &quot;shockingly high level&quot; of infiltration by Soviet agents during WWII had largely dissipated by 1950. Liberal anti-communists like Edward Shils and Daniel Moynihan had contempt for McCarthyism, and Moynihan argued that McCarthy&#x27;s overreaction distracted from the &quot;real (but limited) extent of Soviet espionage in America.&quot; In 1950, President Harry Truman called Joseph McCarthy &quot;the greatest asset the Kremlin has.&quot;
In 1954, after accusing the army, including war heroes, Senator Joseph McCarthy lost credibility in the eyes of the American public and the Army-McCarthy Hearings were held in the summer of 1954. He was formally censured by his colleagues in Congress and the hearings led by McCarthy came to a close. After the Senate formally censured McCarthy, his political standing and power were significantly diminished, and much of the tension surrounding the idea of a possible communist takeover died down.

From 1955 through 1959, the Supreme Court made several decisions which restricted the ways in which the government could enforce its anti-communist policies, some of which included limiting the federal loyalty program to only those who had access to sensitive information, allowing defendants to face their accusers, reducing the strength of congressional investigation committees, and weakening the Smith Act. In the 1957 case &quot;Yates v. United States&quot; and the 1961 case &quot;Scales v. United States&quot;, the Supreme Court limited Congress&#x27;s ability to circumvent the First Amendment, and in 1967 during the Supreme Court case &quot;United States v. Robel&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that a ban on communists in the defense industry was unconstitutional.

In 1995, the American government declassified details of the Venona Project following the Moynihan Commission, which when combined with the opening of the USSR Comintern archives, provided substantial validation of intelligence gathering, outright spying, and policy influencing, by Americans on behalf of the Soviet Union, from 1940 through 1980. Over 300 American communists, whether they knew it or not, including government officials and technicians that helped in developing the atom bomb, were found to have engaged in espionage. This allegedly included some pro-Soviet capitalists, such as economist Harry Dexter White, and communist businessman David Karr.

== New Red Scare ==

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, China&#x27;s growing military and economic power has resulted in a &quot;New Red Scare&quot; in the United States. Both Democrats and Republicans have expressed anti-China sentiment. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, the New Red Scare has caused the American and Chinese governments to &quot;increasingly view Chinese students with suspicion&quot; on American college campuses.

The fourth iteration of the Committee on the Present Danger, a United States foreign policy interest group, was established on March 25, 2019, branding itself Committee on the Present Danger: China (CPDC). The CPDC has been criticized as promoting a revival of Red Scare politics in the United States, and for its ties to conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney and conservative activist Steve Bannon. David Skidmore, writing for &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, saw it as another instance of &quot;adolescent hysteria&quot; in American diplomacy, as another of the &quot;fevered crusades [which] have produced some of the costliest mistakes in American foreign policy&quot;. Between 2000 and 2023, there were 224 reported instances of Chinese espionage directed at the United States.

== Outside the United States ==

The American Red Scares, combined with the general atmosphere of the Cold War, had a marked influence on other Anglophone countries. Anticommunist paranoia and violence was significantly advanced in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. In other parts of the world, such as Indonesia, fear and loathing of communism has escalated to the level of political violence.

<text>Motion JPEG (M-JPEG or MJPEG) is a video compression format in which each video frame or interlaced field of a digital video sequence is compressed separately as a JPEG image.

Originally developed for multimedia PC applications, Motion JPEG enjoys broad client support: most major web browsers and players provide native support, and plug-ins are available for the rest. Software and devices using the M-JPEG standard include media players, game consoles, digital cameras, IP cameras, webcams, streaming servers, video cameras, and non-linear video editors.

== History ==
Motion JPEG was originally developed for multimedia PC applications.

Early implementations of MJPEG were generally implemented in Hardware. C-Cube was an early proponent with their CL550 JPEG codec been used in several hardware implementations. It was announced that the NeXTdimension from NeXT would ship with an onboard CL550 to implement MJPEG. This was however later shelved and wasn&#x27;t included in the final product that was shipped.

Apple provided a Software implementation of MJPEG in their QuickTime Player in the mid-1990s.

== Design ==

M-JPEG is an intraframe-only compression scheme (compared with the more computationally intensive technique of interframe prediction). Whereas modern interframe video formats, such as MPEG1, MPEG2 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, achieve real-world compression ratios of 1:50 or better, M-JPEG&#x27;s lack of interframe prediction limits its efficiency to 1:20 or lower, depending on the tolerance to spatial artifacting in the compressed output. Because frames are compressed independently of one another, M-JPEG imposes lower processing and memory requirements on hardware devices.

As a purely intraframe compression scheme, the image quality of M-JPEG is directly a function of each video frame&#x27;s static (spatial) complexity. Frames with large smooth transitions or monotone surfaces compress well and are more likely to hold their original details with few visible compression artifacts. Frames exhibiting complex textures, fine curves and lines (such as writing on a newspaper) are prone to exhibit discrete cosine transform (DCT) artifacts such as ringing, smudging and macroblocking. M-JPEG-compressed video is also insensitive to motion complexity, i.e. variation over time. It is neither hindered by highly random motion (such as the water-surface turbulence in a large waterfall), nor helped by the absence of motion (such as static landscape shot by tripod), which are two opposite extremes commonly used to test interframe video formats.

For QuickTime formats, Apple has defined two types of coding: MJPEG-A and MJPEG-B. MJPEG-B no longer retains valid JPEG Interchange Files within it, hence it is not possible to take a frame into a JPEG file without slightly modifying the headers.

JPEG is inefficient, using more bits to deliver similar quality, compared to more modern formats (such as JPEG 2000 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC). Since the development of the original JPEG standard in the early 1990s, technology improvements have been made not only to the JPEG format but to the interframe compression schemas possible as well.

== Features ==

Motion JPEG is simple to implement because it uses a mature compression standard (JPEG) with well-developed libraries, and it is an intraframe method of compression.

It tolerates rapidly changing motion in the video stream, whereas compression schemes using interframe compression can often experience unacceptable quality loss when the video content changes significantly between each frame.

Minimal hardware is required because it is not computationally intensive.

== Standardisation ==

Unlike the video formats specified in international standards such as MPEG-2 and the format specified in the JPEG still-picture coding standard, there is no document that defines a single exact format that is universally recognized as a complete specification of “Motion JPEG” for use in all contexts. This raises compatibility concerns about file outputs from different manufacturers. However, each particular file format usually has some standard on how M-JPEG is encoded. For example, Microsoft documents their standard format to store M-JPEG in AVI files, Apple documents how M-JPEG is stored in QuickTime files, RFC 2435 describes how M-JPEG is implemented in an RTP stream, and an M-JPEG CodecID is planned for the Matroska file format.

== Applications ==

M-JPEG is now used by video-capture devices such as digital cameras, IP cameras, and webcams, as well as by non-linear video editing systems. It is natively supported by the QuickTime Player, the PlayStation console, and web browsers such as Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.

=== Video editing ===

M-JPEG is frequently used in non-linear video editing systems. Modern desktop CPUs are powerful enough to work with high-definition video, so no special hardware is required, and they in turn offer native random-access to any frame.

=== Game consoles ===

The PlayStation game console integrated M-JPEG like decompression hardware for in-game FMV sequences, while the PlayStation Portable handheld game console can play M-JPEG from the Memory Stick Pro Duo under the .avi extension with a resolution of 480×272. Both can record clips in M-JPEG with its Go!Cam camera.

Nintendo&#x27;s Wii game console, as well as VTech&#x27;s InnoTab, can play M-JPEG-encoded videos on SD card using its Photo Channel. The SanDisk Sansa e200 and the Zen V digital audio players play short M-JPEG videos. Recent firmware updates to the Nintendo 3DS can now record and play &quot;3D-AVI&quot; M-JPEG-encoded files, which is the same format used in the Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D series, from a SD card in 320×240 resolution so long as the video duration is 10 minutes or less.

=== Digital cameras ===

Prior to the rise in MPEG-4 encoding in consumer devices, a progressive scan form of M-JPEG saw widespread use in the “movie” modes of digital still cameras, allowing video encoding and playback through the integrated JPEG compression hardware with only a software modification. The resultant quality is still inferior compared to a similar-sized MPEG, particularly as the sound (when included) was uncompressed PCM and recorded at a low sample rate or low-compression, low processor-demand ADPCM.

To keep file sizes and transfer rates under control, frame sizes and rates, along with sound sampling rates, are kept relatively low with very high levels of compression for each individual frame. Resolutions of 160×120 or 320×240 are common sizes, typically at 10, 12 or 15 frames per second, with picture quality equivalent to a JPEG setting of “50” with mono ADPCM sound sampled at ~8 kHz. This results in a very basic, but serviceable video output at a similar storage cost to MPEG (~120 kB/s video rate, ~8 kB/s audio – or approx 1 Mbit/s at 320×240 resolution), but with minimal processing overheads. This video is typically stored in Microsoft&#x27;s AVI or Apple&#x27;s QuickTime Movie container files. These files are viewable natively on most operating systems, however sometimes an additional codec must be installed.

The AMV video format, common on cheap &quot;MP4&quot; players, is a modified version of M-JPEG.

In addition to portable players (which are mainly &quot;consumers&quot; of the video), many video-enabled digital cameras use M-JPEG for video-capture. For instance:
* In August 2008, Nikon announced the D90, the first D-SLR to record video. The format used is M-JPEG. The D90 uses three different motion JPEG formats: 320×216 pixels, 640×424 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.
* In June 2009, Pentax announced that the then-upcoming K-7 camera would use M-JPEG in resolutions 640×416, 1280×720, and 1536×1024. The data rate for the M-JPEG files created can be up to 74 Mbit/s.
* In August 2016, Canon announced that the 5D Mark IV camera would record 4K video in M-JPEG, with a data rate of approximately 500 Mbit/s.

Many network-enabled cameras provide M-JPEG streams that network clients can connect to. Mozilla and Webkit-based browsers have native support for viewing these M-JPEG streams.

Some network-enabled cameras provide their own M-JPEG interfaces as part of the normal feature set. For cameras that don&#x27;t provide this feature natively, a server can be used to transcode the camera pictures into an M-JPEG stream and then provide that stream to other network clients.

=== Media players ===

Apple announced on September 1, 2010 that their newest version of the Apple TV would support M-JPEG up to 35 Mbit/s, 1280 by 720 pixels, 30 frames per second, audio in μlaw, PCM stereo audio in .avi file format.

Certain media players such as the Netgear NeoTV 550 do not support the playback of M-JPEG.

=== Video streaming ===

HTTP streaming separates each image into individual HTTP replies on a specified marker. HTTP streaming creates packets of a sequence of JPEG images that can be received by clients such as QuickTime or VLC.

In response to a GET request for a MJPEG file or stream, the server streams the sequence of JPEG frames over HTTP. A special mime-type content type multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary=&lt;boundary-name&gt; informs the client to expect several parts (frames) as an answer delimited by &lt;boundary-name&gt;. This boundary name is expressly disclosed within the MIME-type declaration itself. The TCP connection is not closed as long as the client wants to receive new frames and the server wants to provide new frames. Two basic implementations of a M-JPEG streaming server are &quot;cambozola&quot; and &quot;MJPG-Streamer&quot;. The more robust &quot;ffmpeg-server&quot; also provides M-JPEG streaming support.

Native web browser support includes: Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox. Other browsers, such as Internet Explorer can display M-JPEG streams with the help of external plugins. Cambozola is an applet that can show M-JPEG streams in Java-enabled browsers. M-JPEG is also natively supported by PlayStation and QuickTime. Most commonly, M-JPEG is used in IP based security cameras.

== Successors ==

Technology improvements can be found in the designs of H.263v2 Annex I and MPEG-4 Part 2, that use frequency-domain prediction of transform coefficient values, and in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, that use spatial prediction and adaptive transform block size techniques. There are also more sophisticated entropy coding than what was practical when the first JPEG design was developed. All of these new developments make M-JPEG an inefficient recording mechanism.

<doc id="174814" wikidata="Q465338" url="?curid=174814" title="Phaistos Disc">
<text>The Phaistos Disc, or Phaistos Disk, is a disk of fired clay from the island of Crete, Greece, possibly from the middle or late Minoan Bronze Age (second millennium BC), bearing a text in an unknown script and language. Its purpose and its original place of manufacture remain disputed. It is now on display at the archaeological museum of Heraklion. The name is sometimes spelled Phaestos or Festos.

The disk was discovered in 1908 by the Italian archaeologist Luigi Pernier during the excavation of the Minoan palace of Phaistos. The disk is about in diameter and is covered on each side with a spiral text, consisting of a total of 241 occurrences of 45 distinct signs, which were created by pressing individual sign stamps onto the soft clay before firing. While its unique features initially led some scholars to suspect a forgery or hoax, the disk is now generally accepted by archaeologists as authentic.

This mysterious object captured the imagination of amateur and professional palaeographers, and many attempts have been made to decipher the code behind the disc&#x27;s signs. While it is not clear that it is a script, most attempted decipherments assume that it is; most additionally assume a syllabary, others an alphabet or logography.

== Discovery ==
The Phaistos Disc was discovered in the Minoan palace-site of Phaistos, near Hagia Triada, on the south coast of Crete; specifically the disc was found in the basement of room 8 in building 101 of a group of buildings to the northeast of the main palace. This grouping of four rooms also served as a formal entry into the palace complex. Italian archaeologist Luigi Pernier recovered the intact &quot;dish&quot; on 3 July 1908 during his excavation of the first Minoan palace.

The disc was found in the main cell of an underground &quot;temple depository&quot;. These basement cells, only accessible from above, were neatly covered with a layer of fine plaster. Their content was poor in precious artifacts, but rich in black earth and ashes, mixed with burnt bovine bones. In the northern part of the main cell, in the same black layer, a few centimetres south-east of the disc and about above the floor, Linear A tablet &#x27;PH-1&#x27; was also found.

== Dating ==
Yves Duhoux (1977) dates the disc to between 1850 B.C. and 1600 B.C. (MMIII in Minoan chronology) on the basis of Luigi Pernier&#x27;s report, which says that the disc was in a Middle Minoan undisturbed context. Jeppesen (1963) dates it to after 1400 (LMII–LMIII in Minoan chronology). Doubting the viability of Pernier&#x27;s report, Louis Godart (1990) resigns himself to admitting that archaeologically, the disc may be dated to anywhere in Middle or Late Minoan times (MMI–LMIII, a period spanning most of the second millennium B.C.). Jan Best suggests a date in the first half of the 14th century B.C. (LMIIIA) based on his dating of tablet PH-1.

== Physical description ==
===Material===
The disk is made of fine-grained clay. Some authors have stated that the clay does not appear to be of local origin, perhaps not even from Crete. It was intentionally and properly fired, unlike tablets and seals that were baked only accidentally.

=== Shape and dimensions ===
The disk is approximately cylindrical, about in diameter and almost thick, with rounded edges. More precisely, the outline is slightly egg-shaped, with the diameter varying from 15.8 to and the thickness from 1.6 to . The disk is slightly on side A and on side B.

=== Typographic writing ===
The most remarkable feature of the Phaistos disk is that the embossed signs that comprise its inscription all result from pressing separate stamps – one for each symbol – into the soft clay before firing. Thus the disk can be seen as an early example of movable-type printing. Typesetter and linguist Herbert Brekle writes:

A medieval example of a similar blind printing technique
is the Prüfening dedicatory inscription.

Popular-science author Jared Diamond describes the disc as an example of a technological innovation that did not become widespread because it was made at the wrong time in history. Diamond contrasts the process with Gutenberg&#x27;s printing press.

=== Scribed lines ===
Besides the stamped symbols, there are a few markings made by scoring the moist clay with a sharp stylus. On each side there is a continuous spiral line that separates successive turns of the text. The strip between successive spires of this line is divided into sections by short radial lines, so that each section contains a few whole signs. The presumed start of the text, adjacent to the edge, is also marked by such a radial stroke, with the addition of five dots punched along it with the stylus. Finally, under some of the stamped signs, there are short oblique strokes.

== Signs ==



=== Sign list and counts ===
There are 45 distinct signs on the disk, occurring a total of 242 times — 123 on side A and 119 on side B. In addition to these, a small diagonal line was incised with a stylus (not stamped) underneath some signs, a total of 18 times. The 45 symbols were numbered by Sir Arthur Evans from 01 to 45, and this numbering has been adopted by most researchers.

The signs were added to the Unicode universal computer character (UCS) set in 2008, after a 2006 proposal by Michael Everson and John H. Jenkins. In the following table, the No. column is the Evans number of each sign; the Glyph column is a modern drawing of the symbol; and the Font column uses the UCS font available in the browser. The assigned Unicode names are PHAISTOS DISC SIGN followed by the names shown under Name in the table below, taken from a 1995 book by Louis Godart.

One sign occurrence on side A is too damaged to identify. According to Godart, it may be sign 03 (TATTOOED HEAD) or 20 (DOLIUM); or less probably 08 (GAUNTLET) or 44 (SMALL AXE). Theoretically, it could also be a 46th distinct sign.

The sign images below are reversed left-to-right relative to their appearance on the disk, reflecting their presentation in most Western books and articles.

Also, some signs occur in the disk in two or more orientations, rotated by 90 or 180 degrees. It is generally assumed that the rotation has no semantic or linguistic value, so the rotated copies are still the same symbol. Therefore, the &quot;normal&quot; orientation of those signs is not known, and might have been left to the scribe&#x27;s discretion.

=== Nature of depicted objects ===
Many of the signs are depictions of concrete objects with a recognizable general nature (such as humans, birds, plants, a boat), or parts thereof (heads, hides, flowers). However, in most cases the precise nature of objects depicted is still unknown (as of 2023). The sign names assigned by scholars, in particular by Godart and the Unicode consortium, were rather arbitrary, often based on the slightest shape similarity.

Symbol 21 (Godart&#x27;s &quot;COMB&quot;) was once conjectured to be a palace floorplan. However, this hypothesis was cast in doubt by the discovery of a vase with a nearly identical symbol incised on the bottom, believed to be a potter&#x27;s mark.
Symbol 20 (&quot;DOLIUM&quot;) was assumed to be the conch of a large sea snail, such as &quot;Tonna dolium&quot; or some &quot;Eudolium&quot; or &quot;Charonia&quot; species. One such conch was found at Phaistos and is believed to have been used as a musical instrument for ritual uses.

=== Sign distribution ===
The distribution of symbols is highly non-random, and quite different between the two sides. Evans&#x27;s symbol 02 (PLUMED HEAD) is the most frequent one, occurring 19 times — 14 of them on side A. The next most frequent signs are 07 (HELMET), with 18 occurrences, mostly on side B; 12 (SHIELD), with 17, mostly on side A; and 27 (HIDE), with 15, of which 10 on side A.

Still, 26 of the 45 symbols occur on both sides, at least once on each. The most common signs that occur on only one side are 31 (EAGLE), on side A, and 22 (SLING), on side B; both with five occurrences each.

The following table shows how many distinct signs (Sign count) have the same number of occurrences (Frequency). The third number in each column is the product of the two numbers above, that is, the total number of occurrences (Token count) of those signs:

The nine &quot;hapaxes&quot; (symbols occurring just once) are 04 (A5), 05 (B3), 11 (A13), 15 (B8), 17 (A24), 30 (B27), 42 (B9), 43 (B4), 44 (A7). Of the eight twice-occurring symbols, four (03, 21, 28, 41) occur on side A only, three (09, 16, 20) on side B only, and only one (14) occurs on both sides.

=== Sign correlations ===

The distribution of symbol pairs too is highly non-uniform. For example, of the 17 occurrences of sign 12 (SHIELD), thirteen follow immediately sign 02 (PLUMED HEAD).

== Text ==
The following is a single image of the text &quot;unrolled&quot;. While the order of the characters is left-to-right reversed, the signs themselves are in the original orientation.
=== Directionality ===
Evans, at one point, published an assertion that the disc had been written, and should be read, from the center out, because it would have been easiest to place the inscription first and then size the disc to fit the text. There is general agreement that he was wrong, and Evans himself later changed his mind: the inscription was made, and should be read, in the clockwise sense, from the outside in toward the centre, as with the similar spiral inscription on the Lead Plaque of Magliano.

=== &quot;Words&quot; ===
The signs are laid out on each side as a single spiral text, which is split by the inscribed radial strokes into groups. These groups are conventionally called &quot;words&quot;, even though their true linguistic or other nature is not known. Both ends of the text on each side are also assumed to be &quot;word&quot; boundaries. There are 61 such &quot;words&quot; on the Disc, with two to seven sign occurrences each: 31 on side A and 30 on side B. These &quot;words&quot; are conventionally numbered A1 to A31 and B1 to B30, reading from right to left (clockwise, edge-to-center). 

There may be one additional radial stroke near the center of side A, over-stamped by the sign 03 (TATTOOED HEAD), between sign 10 (ARROW) and the central sign 38 (ROSETTE). However, most scholars ignore that possible stroke and count the last three symbols as a single &quot;word&quot; 10-03-38 (which happens to occur also at about the same position on the next-to-last turn).

On both sides, there is a radial line also right before the start (outermost end) of the text, with five dots punched along it using a sharp round stylus.

=== &quot;Paragraphs&quot; ===

The short oblique strokes that were drawn with a stylus (not stamped) below some signs are always attached to the last sign of a &quot;word&quot; (assuming outside-in reading direction). Their meaning is a matter of discussion. One hypothesis, supported by Evans, is that they further subdivide the text into &quot;paragraphs&quot;.

===Transcriptions===

The following transcriptions of the text all assume a right-to-left (clockwise, edge-to-center) reading direction on the disk, starting at the vertical (radial) line of five dots. In these transcription, however, the order of the characters has been flipped, so that they should be read left-to-right and top-to-bottom. The oblique stroke is assumed to indicate the last word of a &quot;paragraph&quot;. A horizontal line has been added after each &quot;paragraph&quot; for clarity.

For consistency with most published sources, these transcriptions assume that there is an oblique stroke at the end of word A24, even though high-resolution images show it to be just a crack.

==== Unicode ====
The following is a rendering of the Phaistos Disc inscription in Unicode characters from the Phaistos code block (code points +101D0 to +101FC). The radial strokes are denoted by the ASCII character &quot;|&quot; (+7C), and the oblique subscripted stroke by the comma-like PHAISTOS DISK COMBINING OBLIQUE STROKE (+101FD) &quot;after&quot; the affected symbol. The radial stroke with five dots, that indicates the presumed start of text, is denoted by the ISO Latin 1 character &quot;¦&quot; (+A6). The boxed question mark &quot;⍰&quot; (+2370) denotes the illegible sign in word A8. The appearance of the signs will depend on the font used by the browser, but normally they should all be left-to-right flipped relative to their appearance on the disk.

==== Numerical ====
The following transcription uses the Evans numbers for the signs. The vertical bar characters &quot;¦&quot; and &quot;|&quot; represent the start-of-text and word-separating radial lines, respectively. The slash &quot;/&quot; denotes the oblique stroke under the preceding sign. The caret &quot;^&quot; indicates the transition from the first turn of the text (along the disk&#x27;s edge) to the inner turns, and &quot;??&quot; is the unreadable sign.

=== Corrections ===
The disc shows signs of corrections having been made, with some signs erased and over-printed by other signs.

Godart describes these corrections as occurring in the following words: A1 (signs 02-12-13-01), A4 (29-29-34) together with A5 (02-12-04), A8 (12), A10 (02-41-19?-35), A12 (12), A16 (12-31-26?), A17 (second 27?), A29 (second 27?), B1 (12-22), B3 (37?), B4 (22-25 imprinted over the same), B10 (07?-24?-40?), B13 (beside 29?). Question marks indicate uncertainty about that particular sign being the result of a correction.

The borders of word B28 were also widened to make room for sign 02.

=== Sign rotations ===
The two signs 27 (HIDE) in word A29 are rotated 180 degrees compared with all other occurrences of this sign: &quot;head down&quot; versus &quot;head up&quot;. This rotation might be motivated by lack of space in A29.

Arie Cate observed that if signs rotations were random with uniform distribution, then the probability that they end up in only two (or three) signs is very small.

=== Signs in adjacent windings ===
There are several locations on side A where two occurrences of the same sign lie near each other in adjacent turns of the spiral, such as sign 02 (PLUMED HEAD) in word A1 and in word A14. Also the two 27 signs (HIDE) signs in word A29 are upside down, with the &quot;heads&quot; pointing to the HIDE sign of word A23, in the adjacent turn. Arie Cate claims that the probability of these alignments being coincidental is rather small.

== Origin of the artifact ==
For the first few decades after its discovery most scholars argued strongly against the local origin of the artifact. Evans wrote that:

Gustave Glotz claimed that the clay was not from Crete. Ipsen concluded that the disc was certainly from somewhere on the Aegean; however, because of its differences from Linear A or B, he, like Evans, supported a non-Cretan origin for the Disc. He observes, however, that since Linear A was a common Aegean script such an assumption will not resolve the problem of multiplicity.
However, the consensus on this question changed in later decades, as a few other artifacts were found on Crete with significant resemblances to the disk. For instance, a vase found at Knossos (Vase 14 236) bears a stamped sign identical to the disk&#x27;s 25 SHIELD sign (a circle with seven dots). Also, under the bottom of a bowl found in 1965 at Phaistos (bowl F 4718 from the House South of the Ramp) there is a sign in relief, believed to be a potter&#x27;s mark, that is practically identical to sign 21 (COMB). A very similar sign is found as an impression on a sealing from a deposit of administrative documents discovered in 1955, beneath Room 25 of the Second Palace of Phaistos (sealing CMS II.5, n. 246). Female images with pendulous breasts have also been found at Malia and Phaistos.The Arkalochori Axe also bears a short inscription that uses several signs similar to those of the disk.

These and other finds have made Cretan origin more popular. This view was expressed by Michael Trauth in 1990, Duhoux in 2000 and Andrew Robinson in 2008.

== Hoax hypothesis ==
The uniqueness of the script, of the spiral arrangement, and of the method of writing (individual glyph stamps) have led some scholars to raise the possibility that the Phaistos disc is a 1908 forgery or hoax. It was pointed out that the date of manufacture has never been established by thermoluminescence dating.
However, the Disc is now generally accepted as authentic by archaeologists. Andrew Robinson concurs that thermoluminescence dating would be highly desirable, but does not endorse the forgery arguments.

The precise excavation records maintained by Luigi Pernier have always been a problem for the hoax hypothesis. That hypothesis was eventually put to rest by the discovery of the other artifacts in Crete with similar glyphs, which a 1909 hoaxer would not have known about. Also, a gold signet ring from Knossos (the Mavro Spilio ring), found in 1926, contains a Linear A inscription laid out in a spiral, similar to the Phaistos Disc.

== Decipherment attempts ==
A great deal of speculation developed around the disc during the 20th century, particularly capturing the imagination of amateur archeologists. Many attempts have been made to decipher the code behind the disc&#x27;s signs, with a wide variety of theories having been suggested, including prayers, a narrative or an adventure story, a &quot;psalterion&quot;, a call to arms, a board game, and a geometric theorem; some of these theories are considered to be pseudoarchaeology, with little realistic chance of being accurate.

Most linguistic interpretations assume a syllabary, based on the proportion of 45 symbols in a text of 241 tokens typical for that type of script; some assume a syllabary with interspersed logographic symbols, a property of every known syllabary of the Ancient Near East (Linear B as well as cuneiform and hieroglyphic writing). There are, however, also alphabetic and purely logographical interpretations.

While enthusiasts still believe the mystery can be solved, scholarly attempts at decipherment are thought to be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs turn up elsewhere, as it is generally thought that there is not enough context available for meaningful analysis. Any decipherment without external confirmation, such as successful comparison to other inscriptions, is unlikely to be accepted as conclusive.

=== Comparison with other scripts ===
While the Phaistos disk writing system is, on the whole, very different from other known scripts, several scholars have argued against it being an entirely independent invention. Gunther Ipsen argued that the creator must have been influenced by other scripts, and points out the Hieroglyphic Luwian script from Anatolia as an example of an original script inspired by other writing systems (its symbol values inspired by cuneiform, its shapes by Egyptian hieroglyphs).

Several scholars have proposed that the Phaistos signs are older or alternate forms of Linear A glyphs, specifically. Others have pointed to similar resemblances with the Anatolian (Luwian) hieroglyphs, or with Egyptian hieroglyphs. More remote possibilities are the Phoenician abjad or the Byblos syllabary.

==== Linear A ====
Comparison of the disk&#x27;s signs with those of Linear A inscriptions go back to Evans in 1909. In 1959, Benjamin Schwartz asserted a genetic relationship between the Phaistos Disc script and the Cretan linear scripts. Similar claims were made also by Werner Nahm in 1975, Torsten Timm in 2004, and others.

Some of these proposals point to similarities between some glyphs, such as 12 (SHIELD) , 43 (STRAINER) , and 31 (EAGLE) to both Linear A and Linear B characters, and conjecture that they may have the same phonetic values — respectively &#x27;qe&#x27;, &#x27;ta&#x27;, and &#x27;ku&#x27;. Based on the Linear A character distribution patterns collected by Giulio Facchetti, Torsten Timm goes as far as identifying 20 of the 45 characters with Linear A/B signs.

==== Anatolian hieroglyphs ====
Parallels between the Phaistos disk script and Anatolian hieroglyphs were proposed, among others, by S. Davis in 1961 and Jan Best and Fred Woudhuizen in 1988. In 2004, Winfried Achterberg and others proposed an extensive mapping to Anatolian hieroglyphs, which led them to a full decipherment claim. The third revised and extended edition of the authors&#x27; monograph on the subject was published in 2021.

==Summary table==

The following table summarizes the proposed identifications of Phaistos signs with Linear A/B, the Arkalochori Axe glyphs, and Luwian hieroglyphs:

== List of decipherment claims ==
Decipherment claims can be categorized into linguistic decipherments, identifying the language of the inscription, and non-linguistic decipherments. A purely logographical reading is not linguistic in the strict sense: while it may reveal the meaning of the inscription, it will not allow for the identification of the underlying language.

== Unicode ==

A set of 46 symbols from the Phaistos Disc, comprising Evans&#x27;s 45 signs and one combining oblique stroke, have been encoded in Unicode since April 2008 (Unicode version 5.1). They are assigned to the range 101D0–101FF in Plane 1 (the Supplementary Multilingual Plane). These characters were encoded with strong left-to-right directionality, and so in code charts and text (such as elsewhere on this page) the glyphs are mirrored from the way they appear on the disc itself.

== Modern use ==
Side A of the Phaistos Disc is used as the logo of FORTH, one of the largest research centers in Greece.

<text>The backslash is a mark used mainly in computing and mathematics. It is the mirror image of the common slash . It is a relatively recent mark, first documented in the 1930s. It is sometimes called a hack, whack, [[Escape character|escape]] (from C/UNIX), reverse slash, slosh, downwhack, backslant, backwhack, bash, reverse slant, reverse solidus, and reversed virgule.

==History==

, efforts to identify either the origin of this character or its purpose before the 1960s have not been successful. The earliest known reference found to date is a 1937 maintenance manual from the Teletype Corporation with a photograph showing the keyboard of its Kleinschmidt keyboard perforator WPE-3 using the Wheatstone system. The symbol was called the &quot;diagonal key&quot;, and given a (non-standard) Morse code of .

In June 1960, IBM published an &quot;Extended character set standard&quot; that includes the symbol at 0x19. In September 1961, Bob Bemer (IBM) proposed to the X3.2 standards committee that , and be made part of the proposed standard, describing the backslash as a &quot;reverse division operator&quot; and cited its prior use by Teletype in telecommunications. In particular, he said, the was needed so that the ALGOL Boolean operators (logical conjunction) and (logical disjunction) could be composed using and respectively. The Committee adopted these changes into the draft American Standard (subsequently called ASCII) at its November 1961 meeting.

These operators were used for min and max in early versions of the C programming language supplied with Unix V6 and V7.

==Usage==

===Programming languages===
In many programming languages such as C, Perl, PHP, Python and Unix scripting languages, and in many file formats such as JSON, the backslash is used as an escape character, to indicate that the character following it should be treated specially (if it would otherwise be treated literally), or literally (if it would otherwise be treated specially). For instance, inside a C string literal the sequence produces a newline byte instead of an &#x27;n&#x27;, and the sequence produces an actual double quote rather than the special meaning of the double quote ending the string. An actual backslash is produced by a double backslash .

Regular expression languages used it the same way, changing subsequent literal characters into metacharacters and vice versa. For instance searches for either &#x27;|&#x27; or &#x27;b&#x27;, the first bar is escaped and searched for, the second is not escaped and acts as an &quot;or&quot;.

Outside quoted strings, the only common use of backslash is to ignore (&quot;escape&quot;) a newline immediately after it. In this context it may be called a &quot;continued line&quot; as the current line continues into the next one. Some software replaces the backslash+newline with a space.

To support computers that lacked the backslash character, the C trigraph was added, which is equivalent to a backslash. Since this can escape the next character, which may itself be a , the primary modern use may be for code obfuscation. Support for trigraphs in C++ was removed in C++17, and support for them in C is planned to be removed in C23.

In Visual Basic (and some other BASIC dialects) the backslash is used as an operator symbol to indicate integer division. This rounds toward zero.

The ALGOL 68 programming language uses the &quot;\&quot; as its Decimal Exponent Symbol. ALGOL 68 has the choice of 4 Decimal Exponent Symbols: e, E, \, or 10. Examples: , , or .

In APL is called &quot;Expand&quot; when used to insert fill elements into arrays, and &quot;Scan&quot; when used to produce prefix reduction (cumulative fold).

In PHP version 5.3 and higher, the backslash is used to indicate a namespace.

In Haskell, the backslash is used both to introduce special characters and to introduce lambda functions (since it is a reasonable approximation in ASCII of the Greek letter .

===Filenames===

MS-DOS 2.0, released 1983, copied the idea of a hierarchical file system from Unix and thus used the (forward) slash as the directory separator. Possibly on the insistence of IBM, Microsoft added the backslash to allow paths to be typed at the command line interpreter prompt, while retaining compatibility with MS-DOS 1.0 (in which was the command-line option indicator. Typing &quot;&quot; gave the &quot;wide&quot; option to the &quot;&quot; command, so some other method was needed if one actually wanted to run a program called inside a directory called ). Except for COMMAND.COM, all other parts of the operating system accept both characters in a path, but the Microsoft convention remains to use a backslash, and APIs that &quot;return&quot; paths use backslashes. In some versions, the option character can be changed from to via SWITCHAR, which allows COMMAND.COM to preserve in the command name.

The Microsoft Windows family of operating systems inherited the MS-DOS behavior and so still support either character – but individual Windows programs and sub-systems may, wrongly, only accept the backslash as a path delimiter, or may misinterpret a forward slash if it is used as such. Some programs will only accept forward slashes if the path is placed in double-quotes. The failure of Microsoft&#x27;s security features to recognize unexpected-direction slashes in local and Internet paths, while other parts of the operating system still act upon them, has led to some serious lapses in security. Resources that should not be available have been accessed with paths using particular mixes, such as .

===Text markup===

The backslash is used in the TeX typesetting system and in RTF files to begin markup tags.

In USFM, the backslash is used to mark format features for editing Bible translations.

In caret notation, represents the control character 0x1C, file separator. This is entirely a coincidence and has nothing to do with its use in file paths.

===Mathematics===

A backslash-like symbol is used for the set difference.

The backslash is also sometimes used to denote the right coset space.

Especially when describing computer algorithms, it is common to define backslash so that is equivalent to . This is integer division that rounds down, not towards zero.

In MATLAB and GNU Octave the backslash is used for left matrix divide, while the (forward) slash is for right matrix divide.

==Confusion with ¥ and other characters==

In the Japanese encodings ISO 646-JP (a 7-bit code based on ASCII), JIS X 0201 (an 8-bit code), and Shift JIS (a multi-byte encoding which is 8-bit for ASCII), the code point 0x5C that would be used for backslash in ASCII is instead rendered as a yen sign . Due to extensive use of the 005C code point to represent the yen sign, even today some fonts such as MS Mincho render the backslash character as a ¥, so the characters at Unicode code points and both render as when these character sets are selected. Computer programs still treat 005C as a backslash in these environments but display it as a yen sign, causing confusion, especially in MS-DOS filenames.

Several other ISO 646 versions also replace backslash with other characters, including ₩ (Korean), Ö (German, Swedish), Ø (Danish, Norwegian), ç (French) and Ñ (Spanish), leading to similar problems, though with less lasting impact compared to the yen sign. Although the conflict is resolved by unique code point allocations in Unicode, the longevity of legacy systems means that (although diminishing) the issue continues to persist.

In 1991, RFC 1345 suggested as a unique two-character mnemonic that might be used in internet standards as &quot;a practical way of identifying [this] character, without reference to a coded character set and its code in [that] coded character set&quot;. Consequently, this style may be seen in early Internet Engineering Task Force documents.

==Unicode==
Unicode has codepoints for a variety of backslash symbols:

<doc id="174818" wikidata="Q1163299" url="?curid=174818" title="Wood gas">
<text>Wood gas is a fuel gas that can be used for furnaces, stoves, and vehicles. During the production process, biomass or related carbon-containing materials are gasified within the oxygen-limited environment of a wood gas generator to produce a combustible mixture. In some gasifiers this process is preceded by pyrolysis, where the biomass or coal is first converted to char, releasing methane and tar rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

In stark contrast with synthesis gas, which is almost pure mixture of wood gas &quot;also&quot; contains a variety of organic compound (&quot;distillates&quot;) that require scrubbing for use in other applications. Depending on the kind of biomass, a variety of contaminants are produced that will condense out as the gas cools. When producer gas is used to power cars and boats or distributed to remote locations it is necessary to scrub the gas to remove the materials that can condense and clog carburetors and gas lines. Anthracite and coke are preferred for automotive use, because they produce the smallest amount of contamination, allowing smaller, lighter scrubbers to be used.

== History ==
The first wood gasifier was apparently built by Gustav Bischof in 1839. The first vehicle powered by wood gas was built by T.H. Parker in 1901.
Around 1900, many cities delivered fuel gases (centrally produced, typically from coal) to residences. Natural gas came into use only in the 1930s.

Wood gas vehicles were used during World War II as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels. In Germany alone, around 500,000 &quot;producer gas&quot; vehicles were in use at the end of the war. Trucks, buses, tractors, motorcycles, ships, and trains were equipped with a wood gasification unit. In 1942, when wood gas had not yet reached the height of its popularity, there were about 73,000 wood gas vehicles in Sweden,
65,000 in France, 10,000 in Denmark, and almost 8,000 in Switzerland. In 1944, Finland had 43,000 &quot;woodmobiles&quot;, of which 30,000 were buses and trucks, 7,000 private vehicles, 4,000 tractors and 600 boats.

Wood gasifiers are still manufactured in China and Russia for automobiles and as power generators for industrial applications. Trucks retrofitted with wood gasifiers are used in North Korea
in rural areas, particularly on the roads of the east coast.

== Production ==

A wood gasifier takes wood chips, sawdust, charcoal, coal, rubber or similar materials as fuel and burns these incompletely in a fire box, producing wood gas, solid ash and soot, the latter of which have to be removed periodically from the gasifier. The wood gas can then be filtered for tars and soot/ash particles, cooled and directed to an engine or fuel cell.
Most of these engines have strict purity requirements of the wood gas, so the gas often has to pass through extensive gas cleaning in order to remove or convert, &quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;crack&quot;, tars and particles. The removal of tar is often accomplished by using a water scrubber. Running wood gas in an unmodified gasoline-burning internal combustion engine may lead to problematic accumulation of unburned compounds.

The quality of the gas from different &quot;gasifiers&quot; varies a great deal. Staged gasifiers, where pyrolysis and gasification occur separately instead of in the same reaction zone as was the case in the World War II gasifiers, can be engineered to produce essentially tar-free gas (less than 1 mg/m3), while single-reactor fluidized bed gasifiers may exceed 50,000 mg/m³ tar. The fluidized bed reactors have the advantage of being much more compact, with more capacity per unit volume and price. Depending on the intended use of the gas, tar can be beneficial, as well by increasing the heating value of the gas.

The heat of combustion of &quot;producer gas&quot; – a term used in the United States, meaning wood gas produced for use in a combustion engine – is rather low compared to other fuels. Taylor (1985)
reports that producer gas has a lower heat of combustion of 5.7 MJ/kg versus 55.9 MJ/kg for natural gas and 44.1 MJ/kg for gasoline. The heat of combustion of wood is typically 15–18 MJ/kg. Presumably, these values can vary somewhat from sample to sample. The same source reports the following chemical composition by volume which most likely is also variable:
::

The composition of the gas is strongly dependent on the gasification process, the gasification medium (air, oxygen or steam), and the fuel moisture. Steam-gasification processes typically yield high hydrogen contents, downdraft fixed bed gasifiers yield high nitrogen concentrations and low tar loads, while updraft fixed bed gasifiers yield high tar loads.

During the production of charcoal for blackpowder, the volatile wood gas is vented. Extremely-high-surface-area carbon results, suitable for use as a fuel in black powder.

<text>Ysaye M. Barnwell is an American singer and composer. Barnwell was a member of the African American a cappella ensemble Sweet Honey in the Rock from 1979 to 2013.

In addition to writing many of the group&#x27;s songs, A female bass, she conducts music workshops around the United States, UK, Canada and Australia, including a workshop she created called &quot;Building a Vocal Community: Singing in the African American Tradition&quot;. In 1977, she founded the Jubilee Singers, a choir at All Souls Church, Unitarian in Washington, DC.

== Early life and education ==
Barnwell was raised in New York City in Harlem and later in Jamaica, Queens. The daughter of a violinist, Barnwell began her 15 year study of the violin with her father at the age of 2 ½.

Barnwell earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees (1967 and 1968) in speech pathology from State University of New York at Geneseo, and a PhD (1975) in speech pathology from the University of Pittsburgh. In 1981, she also earned a Master of Science in Public health, from Howard University.

== Career ==

Barnwell spent over a decade as a professor at Howard University&#x27;s College of Dentistry. Afterwards, she turned to community based projects in computer technology and the arts. She also directed health programs in Washington, D.C. at Children&#x27;s Hospital National Medical Center and Gallaudet University.

While attending All Souls Church, Unitarian, Dr. Barnwell noticed that the racial makeup of the choir did not reflect that of the congregation. This led her to found the Jubilee Singers in 1977, which she directed for three years. Her work with the Jubilee singers led her to begin arranging and composing music for vocal ensembles. She produced Sweet Honey in the Rock&#x27;s 1998 25th anniversary album, &quot;...Twenty-Five...&quot;, and edited &quot;&quot;.

Barnwell&#x27;s acting credits include a principal role on a television series called &quot;A Man Called Hawk&quot;; she also appeared in the 1998 film &quot;Beloved&quot;. She released a solo recording of stories and song, &quot;Um Humm&quot;, in 2000.

She wrote a children&#x27;s book with CD, &quot;No Mirrors in My Nana&#x27;s House&quot;. A second children&#x27;s book and CD set was released in March 2008: &quot;We Are One&quot;.

Barnwell was named after the great Belgian violinist, Eugène Ysaÿe.

<doc id="174821" wikidata="Q229749" url="?curid=174821" title="Heather Locklear">
<text>Heather Deen Locklear (born September 25, 1961) is an American actress famous for her role as Amanda Woodward on &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (1993–1999), for which she received four consecutive Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress – Television Series Drama. She is also known for her role as Sammy Jo Carrington on &quot;Dynasty&quot; from 1981 to 1989, her first major television role, which began a longtime collaboration with producer Aaron Spelling.

Other notable television roles include Officer Stacy Sheridan on &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot; (1982–1986) and Caitlin Moore on &quot;Spin City&quot; (1999–2002), for which she earned two more Golden Globe nominations, this time for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. She had a recurring role on the TV Land sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; and a main role on the TNT drama-comedy television series &quot;Franklin &amp; Bash&quot; in 2013. Her film roles include the science-fiction thriller &quot;Firestarter&quot; (1984), the action comedy &quot;Money Talks&quot; (1997), the live-action/animated comedy &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003) and the romantic comedy &quot;The Perfect Man&quot; (2005).

==Early life==
Heather Deen Locklear was born on September 25, 1961, in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Diane (née Tinsley), a production executive, and Bill Locklear, an administrator at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and former colonel in the United States Marine Corps. She has Lumbee ancestry.

==Career==
===1980-1982: Beginnings===
While at UCLA, she began modeling and working in commercials for the school store. She made her earliest screen appearances in the early 1980s with small roles in episodes of &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;240-Robert&quot; and &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;. Locklear auditioned for &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; probably in 1980 - producers were looking for someone to replace Suzanne Somers – but she did not get the role. Later, she was screen tested with then-unknown Tom Cruise for the lead roles on &quot;The Powers of Matthew Star&quot;, an 1982 NBC short-lived TV series.

===1982-1992: Breakthrough with &quot;Dynasty&quot; and &quot;T.J. Hooker&quot;===
In 1982 began a long-term collaboration between Locklear and producer Aaron Spelling. Spelling casts her as Sammy Jo Dean during season 2 of his TV series &quot;Dynasty&quot; for 15 episodes. The following year, Locklear joins the cop show &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot; with William Shatner as female lead to replace actress April Clough. She portrayed rookie Officer Stacy Sheridan.

Until the mid-1980s, Locklear appeared as a series regular on &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot;, while making semi-regular appearances on &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Locklear remembered at 90s Con in Daytona Beach: &quot;I’d be in my police uniform, padded bra, all that s***, and then I’d have to be all glammed up, and they’d drive me to the Dynasty set, and so it kind of went back and forth…I just had two jobs!&quot;. After &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot; ended in 1986, Locklear became a full-time cast member on &quot;Dynasty&quot; until its cancellation in 1989. In 1991, the cast of &quot;Dynasty&quot; (including Locklear) reconvened for the four-hour miniseries &quot;&quot;.

Following &quot;Dynasty&quot;&#x27;s success, Locklear appeared in her first starring film as Drew Barrymore&#x27;s mother in &quot;Firestarter&quot; (1984). 

Locklear had a leading role in the 1989 film &quot;The Return of Swamp Thing&quot;, for which she won the satirical Razzie Award for Worst Actress). She also starred in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Going Places&quot; created for the TGIF block. It was her &quot;first time filming in front of a live audience&quot;, she said in an interview with Barry Roskin Blake on Inside Entertainment in 1990.

===1993-1999: &quot;Melrose Place (1992)&quot; and worldwide recognition===
In 1993, Heather Locklear began playing another of her best-known roles, Amanda Woodward, on Aaron Spelling&#x27;s drama series &quot;Melrose Place&quot; created by Darren Star. Spelling originally signed Locklear for a limited four-episode run to boost interest, the first of which aired on January 27, 1993. Locklear is credited to boost ratings at the end of the first season and became a full-time cast member, though she continued to be billed as Special Guest Star in the opening credits from season two until its cancellation in 1999. 

&quot;It wasn’t until Heather Locklear came on that she unlocked something, maybe because she brought this &quot;Dynasty&quot; cred. She literally could not say “hello” without an agenda&quot;, said Darren Star to Vulture. Years earlier, he talked to The Hollywood Reporter: &quot;[I] meet with Heather and at the time, Amanda was a fairly innocuous part with a four-episode arc. Once we started writing for her and saw how she was able to take an innocuous line and give it devious subtext, that inspired so much in terms of where the show could go&quot;. Locklear remembered: &quot;I just said, &#x27;I wanna be a businesswoman. I don&#x27;t wanna be Sammy Jo from &quot;Dynasty&quot;. I don&#x27;t wanna, like, be a quirky girl&quot;.

Locklear earned four Golden Globe Awards nominations for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama from 1994 to 1997.

Throughout her career, Locklear has appeared in eight television productions made by Aaron Spelling: &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot;, &quot;Matt Houston&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, and the television film &quot;Rich Men, Single Women&quot;.

Locklear was the guest host on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on May 14, 1994. Two of her best-known skits included her as an elderly Jewish woman on &quot;Coffee Talk&quot; with Mike Myers and her acting as Amanda Woodward in a &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; skit with Myers, Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider and Phil Hartman, wherein Wayne has a dream that he is a character on &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. Locklear also made a cameo in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; in 1993. In 1996, she appeared as the main guest on &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, performing in a spoof of &quot;Melrose Place&quot; titled &quot;Muppet Heights&quot;. She was also the subject of a Lifetime &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot; special in 1997, and of an &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; special in 2004.

Locklear was featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine on May 19, 1994, as &quot;Melrose Place&quot; reached the height of its popularity. She was named one of &quot;People&quot; Magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People twice, first in 1994, and again in 2001.

===1999-2005: from drama to comedy===
After &quot;Melrose Place&quot; ended in 1999, Locklear was cast in the fourth season of ABC sitcom &quot;Spin City&quot;, initially opposite Michael J. Fox and later Charlie Sheen. Fox and show staff approached her to play a woman who would manage the mayor&#x27;s (Barry Bostwick) senatorial campaign. Locklear moved to New York for filming and Spin City rated top in its new time slot among 18-to-49-year-olds. DreamWorks boss Jeffrey Katzenberg credits &quot;Sheen’s instant chemistry with costar Heather Locklear for keeping the series spinning forward&quot;. Because of Sheen joins the show, production was relocated in Los Angeles the next year and until the end of the show. Locklear earned two Golden Globe Awards nominations for Best Actress in a Television Series – Comedy before the series ended in 2002. 

&quot;Spin City&quot; marks a new beginning in Locklear&#x27;s carreer with several comedies for television et theatrical movies. In 2002, Locklear had a brief recurring role in the sitcom &quot;Scrubs&quot;, another hit show created by Bill Lawrence years after &quot;Spin City&quot;. She also had a guest spot in the last season of David E. Kelley&#x27;s legal comedy drama &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. She played the love-interest of John C. McGinley and Peter MacNicol, respectively.

In 2003, she starred in a pilot for her own comedy series, &quot;Once Around the Park&quot;, but this was unsuccessful. The same year, Locklear appeared in the film &quot;Uptown Girls&quot;, a romantic comedy starring Brittany Murphy. In 2004, Locklear made a guest appearance on the sitcom &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, which starred her former &quot;Spin City&quot; co-star Charlie Sheen. In 2005, Locklear appeared in the film &quot;The Perfect Man&quot; with Hilary Duff. The same year, she had a brief recurring role on the drama series &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, which starred her former &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot; co-star William Shatner. This show was another David E. Kelley production. Locklear was also featured in a Biography Channel special.

In 2004, Locklear returns to drama in primetime opposite Blair Underwood and starred in the short-lived television drama series &quot;LAX&quot; set in the airport of the same name. She portrayed an ambitious airport executive overseeing the Los Angeles hub. She was also executive producer on the series, but it was cancelled after 11 episodes. &quot;LAX debuted to an audience of 13 million. But then things went south — quickly: The series lost 5 million viewers in its second week and went into a free fall until November, when NBC axed the drama from its schedule&quot;, according to Entertainment Weekly.

===Since 2006: Lifetime movies and guest roles===
In 2006, Locklear starred in another television pilot, &quot;Women of a Certain Age&quot;, but this was unsuccessful.

In 2007, Locklear made another pilot for ABC, &quot;See Jayne Run&quot;, about a business woman who juggles a career with single motherhood, but this was also unsuccessful. She guest-starred on the series &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; and in the sitcom &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;, and was placed 25th on &quot;TV Guide&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Greatest TV Icons&quot; list.

Also in 2007, Locklear starred in her first Lifetime movie, Angels Fall, about a beautiful chef who moves to a small town in Wyoming after her Boston restaurant is shut down because of a fatal shooting. At the time, it was one of the top-ten watched telecasts in the history of the network. Then, in 2008, Locklear played in the romantic comedy-drama television film for Lifetime Flirting with Forty. It was the four most-watched original movies in basic cable that year with 4 million viewers.

In 2009, Locklear joined the cast of The CW&#x27;s updated version of &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. Beginning on November 17, 2009, she reprised her role as Amanda Woodward and appeared in eight episodes. Ten years after the end of the original &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, Amanda Woodward is now a partner in a public relations firm, and is both mentor and tormentor to a young underling, Ella, played by Katie Cassidy. However, despite Locklear&#x27;s appearances (along with various other original series regulars), the new show was not a ratings success and was cancelled after one season. In 2011, Locklear starred in the television movie &quot;He Loves Me&quot; on the Lifetime Channel.

In 2012, Locklear began appearing in a recurring role on the TV Land comedy series &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;. In 2013, she became a regular on the comedy-drama &quot;Franklin &amp; Bash&quot;. In 2014, Locklear featured in a public service announcement titled &quot;We Are, Sarah Jones&quot;, in memory of camera assistant Sarah Jones who was killed in an accident on the set of &quot;Midnight Rider&quot; on February 20, 2014.

In 2021, Locklear portrayed Kristine Carlson in the Lifetime television film &quot;Don&#x27;t Sweat the Small Stuff: The Kristine Carlson Story&quot;, which follows the changes in Carlson&#x27;s life after her husband Dr. Richard Carlson suddenly died in 2006.

In 2024, Locklear starred in the Lifetime film &quot;Mormon Mom Gone Wrong: The Ruby Franke Story&quot; as part of its &quot;Ripped from the Headlines&quot; feature films where she portrayed Jodi Hildebrandt.

In 2006, Heather Locklear appeared in the music video for country singer Toby Keith&#x27;s single &quot;Crash Here Tonight&quot; that same year.

In 2020, Locklear joined &quot;Scrubs&quot; actors Zach Braff and Donald Faison in their podcast &quot;Fake Doctors, Real Friends with Zach and Donald&quot;. She had a two-episodes guest spot in that sitcom. Also, the actress remembered a &quot;gross&quot; moment filming &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;. She recalled her costar James Naughton touching her breast for a scene. Naughton&#x27;s rep told the moment was written in the script. Later, Locklear clarified: &quot;To be clear, I was never upset with James, just surprised&quot;. 

In September 2024, Locklear made her first public appearance in nearly three years at 90s Con held in Daytona Beach, Florida.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===

Locklear was married to Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee from May 10, 1986, to 1993. Locklear filed for divorce due to Tommy’s infidelity. After their divorce, she married Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, on December 17, 1994, in Paris. She gave birth to their only child, daughter in 1997. Locklear filed for divorce from Sambora in February 2006. The following month Sambora filed for joint custody of their daughter and enforcement of a prenuptial agreement. Their divorce was finalized in April 2007. In the same month, Locklear began a relationship with fellow &quot;Melrose Place&quot; alumnus Jack Wagner. In August 2011, Locklear and Wagner announced they were engaged. The couple had called off their engagement by that November.

In April 2020, Locklear became engaged to former motocross racer Chris Heisser, whom she first dated in high school.

==Health and legal troubles==
In March 2008, a 911 call was made by someone who claimed to be Locklear&#x27;s doctor, who said that Locklear was trying to kill herself. Emergency responders were dispatched to Locklear&#x27;s home. Her publicist later said that Locklear had never requested any medical assistance, and the Ventura County Sheriff&#x27;s Department later stated that no further action was taken once they arrived at Locklear&#x27;s Westlake Village home, as she appeared to be fine. They did, however, state that they believed the call was genuine.

On June 24, 2008, Locklear checked into a medical facility in Arizona for psychological ailments including anxiety and depression, and requested an in-depth evaluation of her medication to receive proper diagnosis and treatment. Her agent confirmed Locklear was suffering from anxiety and depression. On July 23, 2008, Locklear returned home after four weeks of treatment at the facility.
In September 2008, Locklear was pulled over by a California Highway Patrol officer and arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, just outside Santa Barbara after she was seen driving erratically. Police had been tipped off about Locklear&#x27;s driving by Jill Ishkanian, a former reporter and editor at &quot;Us Weekly&quot; magazine, who saw Locklear outside a market in Montecito, California. Ishkanian photographed the incident and then sold the photos to the celebrity-news website TMZ.com for $27,500 (), although she claims it was a chance meeting and denies having followed or set up Locklear to obtain photographs. Locklear was formally charged on November 17, 2008, with one misdemeanor count of driving under the influence. A blood test detected no alcohol nor illegal narcotics, but Santa Barbara County Deputy District Attorney Lee Carter stated authorities believe the prescription medications Locklear consumed for her anxiety and depression &quot;could have impaired her ability to safely drive a motor vehicle&quot;. On January 2, 2009, Locklear pleaded no contest to reckless driving, and in return the district attorney dismissed the DUI charges. Locklear was sentenced to three years of informal probation, a DMV driver safety class and a $700 fine.

On January 12, 2012, Locklear&#x27;s sister called 911 when she believed Locklear was in danger after reportedly taking prescription drugs and alcohol. Emergency personnel responded, and Locklear was taken to Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks, California, but was reported to be out of danger the following day.
In February 2018, Locklear was arrested for domestic violence and battery against a police officer. She was charged with one felony count of domestic violence and three misdemeanor counts of battery on a police officer. As deputies arrived at her Thousand Oaks home, she allegedly kicked three of the arresting deputy sheriffs and told them she would shoot at them if they ever came into her home again. According to audio of the 911 call, Locklear&#x27;s brother called the police after coming to her home, where he found Locklear and her boyfriend arguing. Locklear was released on a $20,000 bond just before 6 a.m. the next day. Locklear&#x27;s boyfriend, former American Motorcycle Association motocross racer Chris Heisser, was arrested on a driving under the influence charge in Thousand Oaks, hours after Locklear had been taken into custody. After obtaining a warrant, police searched her home for a weapon on March 12 but found none.

On June 24, 2018, Locklear was arrested again, this time for two misdemeanor counts of battery. On June 25, 2018, after being released on bail for charges of battery, Locklear was hospitalized in a suspected case of overdose. In August 2019, she pleaded no contest to charges stemming from that arrest and was sentenced to 30 days in a residential mental health facility.

In April 2020, Locklear wrote on Instagram that she had been sober for one year. She has received treatment for addiction 20 times.

<doc id="174822" wikidata="Q2622355" url="?curid=174822" title="Producer gas">
<text>Producer gas is fuel gas that is manufactured by blowing through a coke or coal fire with air and steam simultaneously. It mainly consists of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), as well as substantial amounts of nitrogen (N2). The caloric value of the producer gas is low (mainly because of its high nitrogen content), and the technology is obsolete. Improvements over producer gas, also obsolete, include water gas where the solid fuel is treated intermittently with air and steam and, far more efficiently synthesis gas where the solid fuel is replaced with methane.

In the US, producer gas may also be referred to by other names based on the fuel used for production such as wood gas. Producer gas may also be referred to as suction gas. The term suction refers to the way the air was drawn into the gas generator by an internal combustion engine. Wood gas is produced in a gasifier

==Production==
Producer gas is generally made from coke, or other carbonaceous material such as anthracite. Air is passed over the red-hot carbonaceous fuel and carbon monoxide is produced. The reaction is exothermic and proceeds as follows:

Formation of producer gas from air and carbon:

:C + O → CO, +97,600 calories/mol
:CO + C → 2CO, –38,800 calories/mol (mol of the reaction formula)
:2C + O → 2CO, +58,800 calories/mol (per mol of O i.e. per mol of the reaction formula)

Reactions between steam and carbon:

:HO + C → H + CO, –28,800 calories/mol (presumably mol of the reaction formula)
:2HO + C → 2H + CO, –18,800 calories/mol (presumably mol of the reaction formula)

Reaction between steam and carbon monoxide:

:HO + CO → CO + H, +10,000 calories/mol (presumably mol of the reaction formula)
:CO + H → CO + HO, –10,000 calories/mol (presumably mol of the reaction formula)

The average composition of ordinary producer gas according to Latta was: CO: 5.8%; O: 1.3%; CO: 19.8%; H: 15.1%; CH: 1.3%; N: 56.7%; B.T.U. gross per cu.ft 136 The concentration of carbon monoxide in the &quot;ideal&quot; producer gas was considered to be 34.7% carbon monoxide (carbonic oxide) and 65.3% nitrogen. After &quot;scrubbing&quot;, to remove tar, the gas may be used to power gas turbines (which are well-suited to fuels of low calorific value), spark ignited engines (where 100% petrol fuel replacement is possible) or diesel internal combustion engines (where 15% to 40% of the original diesel fuel requirement is still used to ignite the gas ). During World War II in Britain, plants were built in the form of trailers for towing behind commercial vehicles, especially buses, to supply gas as a replacement for petrol (gasoline) fuel. A range of about 80 miles for every charge of anthracite was achieved.

In old movies and stories, when there is a description of suicide by &quot;turning on the gas&quot; and leaving an oven door open without lighting the flame, the reference was to coal gas or town gas. As this gas contained a significant amount of carbon monoxide it was quite toxic. Most town gas was also odorized, if it did not have its own odor. Modern &#x27;natural gas&#x27; used in homes is far less toxic, and has a mercaptan added to it for odor for identifying leaks.

Various names are used for producer gas, air gas and water gas generally depending on the fuel source, process or end use including:

* Air gas: also called &quot;power gas&quot;, &quot;generator gas&quot;, or &quot;Siemens&#x27; producer gas&quot;. Produced from various fuels by partial combustion with air. Air gas consists principally of carbon monoxide with nitrogen from the air used and a small amount of hydrogen. This term is not commonly used, and tends to be used synonymously with wood gas.
* Producer gas: Air gas modified by simultaneous injection of water or steam to maintain a constant temperature and obtain a higher heat content gas by enrichment of air gas with H. Current usage often includes air gas.
* Semi-water gas: Producer gas.
* Blue water-gas: Air, water or producer gas produced from clean fuels such as coke, charcoal and anthracite which contain insufficient hydrocarbon impurities for use as illuminating gas. Blue gas burns with a blue flame and does not produce light except when used with a Welsbach gas mantle.
* Lowe&#x27;s Water Gas: Water gas with a secondary pyrolysis reactor to introduce hydrocarbon gasses for illuminating purposes.
* Carburetted gas: Any gas produced by a process similar to Lowe&#x27;s in which hydrocarbons are added for illumination purposes.
* Wood gas: produced from wood by partial combustion. Sometimes used in a gasifier to power cars with ordinary internal combustion engines.
Other similar fuel gasses

* Coal gas or illuminating gas: Produced from coal by distillation.
* Water gas: Produced by injection of steam into fuel preheated by combustion with air. The reaction is endothermic so the fuel must be continually re-heated to keep the reaction going. This was usually done by alternating the steam with an air stream. This name is sometimes used incorrectly when describing carburetted blue water gas simply as blue water gas.
* Coke oven gas: Coke ovens give off a gas exactly similar to illuminating gas, part of which is used to heat the coal. There may be a large excess, however, which is used for industrial purposes after it has been purified.
* Syngas, or synthesis gas: (from synthetic gas or synthesis gas) can be applied to any of the above gasses, but generally refers to modern industrial processes, such as natural gas reforming, hydrogen production, and processes for synthetic production of methane and other hydrocarbons.
* City (Town) gas: any of the above-manufactured gases including producer gas containing sufficient hydrocarbons to produce a bright flame for illumination purposes, originally produced from coal, for sale to consumers and municipalities.

Uses and Advantages of Producer Gas:
* It is used in furnace. When furnaces are big, no scrubbing etc. is required. When furnace is small, scrubbing is necessary to avoid chocking of small burners. In gas engines, it is used after scrubbing.
* There is no loss due to smoke and convection current.
* Quantity of air required for the combustion of producer gas is not much above the theoretical quantity; when burning solid fuel, far more than the theoretical quantity is required. With solid fuels, the larger quantity of exhaust takes away considerable heat with it.
* Producer gas is more easily transmitted than solid fuel.
* Gas-fired furnaces can be maintained at a constant temperature.
* With gas, an oxidising and reducing flame can be obtained.
* Heat loss due to converting solid fuel into producer gas can be made in an economic way.
* Smoke nuisance can be avoided.
* Producer gas can be produced even by the poorest quality of fuel.

<doc id="174823" wikidata="Q204194" url="?curid=174823" title="Dark nebula">
<text>A dark nebula or absorption nebula is a type of interstellar cloud, particularly molecular clouds, that is so dense that it obscures the visible wavelengths of light from objects behind it, such as background stars and emission or reflection nebulae. The extinction of the light is caused by interstellar dust grains in the coldest, densest parts of molecular clouds. Clusters and large complexes of dark nebulae are associated with Giant Molecular Clouds. Isolated small dark nebulae are called Bok globules. Like other interstellar dust or material, the things it obscures are visible only using radio waves in radio astronomy or infrared in infrared astronomy.

Dark clouds appear so because of sub-micrometre-sized dust particles, coated with frozen carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which effectively block the passage of light at visible wavelengths. Also present are molecular hydrogen, atomic helium, C18O (CO with oxygen as the 18O isotope), CS, NH3 (ammonia), H2CO (formaldehyde), c-C3H2 (cyclopropenylidene) and a molecular ion N2H+ (diazenylium), all of which are relatively transparent. These clouds are the spawning grounds of stars and planets, and understanding their development is essential to understanding star formation.

The form of such dark clouds is very irregular: they have no clearly defined outer boundaries and sometimes take on convoluted serpentine shapes. The closest and largest dark nebulae are visible to the naked eye, since they are the least obscured by stars in between Earth and the nebula, and because they have the largest angular size, appearing as dark patches against the brighter background of the Milky Way like the Coalsack Nebula and the Great Rift. These naked-eye objects are sometimes known as dark cloud constellations and take on a variety of names.

In the inner molecular regions of dark nebulae, important events take place, such as the formation of stars and masers.

==Complexes and constellations==
Along with molecular clouds, dark nebula make up molecular cloud complexes.

Dark nebula form in the night sky apparent dark cloud constellations.

<text>Gustavus Cannon (September 12, 1883 – October 15, 1979) was an American blues musician who helped to popularize jug bands (such as his own Cannon&#x27;s Jug Stompers) in the 1920s and 1930s. There is uncertainty about his birth year; his tombstone gives the date as 1874.

==Career==
Born on a plantation in Red Banks, Mississippi, Cannon moved a hundred miles to Clarksdale, then the home of W. C. Handy, at the age of 12. His musical skills came without training; he taught himself to play a banjo that he made from a frying pan and a raccoon skin. He ran away from home at the age of fifteen and began his career entertaining at sawmills and at levee and railroad camps in the Mississippi Delta around the turn of the twentieth century.

While in Clarksdale, Cannon was influenced by two local musicians, Jim Turner and Alec Lee. Turner&#x27;s fiddle playing in W. C. Handy&#x27;s band so impressed Cannon that he decided to learn to play the fiddle himself. Lee, a guitarist, taught Cannon his first folk blues, &quot;Po&#x27; Boy, Long Ways from Home,&quot; and showed him how to use a knife blade as a slide, a technique that Cannon adapted to his banjo playing.

Cannon left Clarksdale around 1907 and soon settled near Memphis, Tennessee, where he played in a jug band led by Jim Guffin. He began playing in Memphis with Jim Jackson. He met the harmonica player Noah Lewis, who introduced him to a young guitar player, Ashley Thompson. Lewis and Thompson later were members of Cannon&#x27;s Jug Stompers. The three of them formed a band to play at parties and dances. In 1914 Cannon began touring in medicine shows. He supported his family through various jobs, including sharecropping, ditch digging, and yard work, but supplemented his income with music.

Cannon began recording, as Banjo Joe, for Paramount Records in 1927. At that session he was backed by Blind Blake. After the success of the Memphis Jug Band&#x27;s first records, he quickly assembled a jug band, Cannon&#x27;s Jug Stompers, featuring Lewis and Thompson (later replaced by Elijah Avery). The group was first recorded at the Memphis Auditorium for Victor Records in January 1928. Hosea Woods joined the Jug Stompers in the late 1920s, playing guitar, banjo and kazoo and providing some vocals. Cannon&#x27;s Jug Stompers&#x27; recording of &quot;Big Railroad Blues&quot; is available on the compilation album &quot;The Music Never Stopped: Roots of the Grateful Dead&quot;.

Although their last recordings were made in 1930, Cannon&#x27;s Jug Stompers were one of Beale Street&#x27;s most popular jug bands through the 1930s. A few songs Cannon recorded with the Jug Stompers are &quot;Minglewood Blues,&quot; &quot;Pig Ankle Strut,&quot; &quot;Wolf River Blues,&quot; &quot;Viola Lee Blues,&quot; &quot;White House Station,&quot; and &quot;Walk Right In&quot; (a pop hit for The Rooftop Singers in the 1960s and for Dr. Hook in the 1970s). By the end of the 1930s, Cannon had effectively retired, although he occasionally performed as a solo musician.

Cannon made a few recordings for Folkways Records in 1956. During the blues revival of the 1960s, he made some appearances at colleges and coffee houses with Furry Lewis and Bukka White, but he had to pawn his banjo to pay his heating bill the winter before The Rooftop Singers had a hit with &quot;Walk Right In.&quot;

In the wake of becoming a hit composer, he recorded an album for Stax Records in 1963, with fellow Memphis musicians Will Shade (the former leader of the Memphis Jug Band) on jug and Milton Roby on washboard. Cannon performed traditional songs, including &quot;Kill It,&quot; &quot;Salty Dog,&quot; &quot;Going Around,&quot; &quot;The Mountain,&quot; &quot;Ol&#x27; Hen,&quot; &quot;Gonna Raise a Ruckus Tonight,&quot; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Rain No More,&quot; &quot;Boll-Weevil,&quot; &quot;Come On down to My House,&quot; &quot;Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor,&quot; &quot;Get Up in the Morning Soon,&quot; and &quot;Crawdad Hole,&quot; along with his own &quot;Walk Right In,&quot; with stories and introductions between songs.

Cannon appeared in the film &quot;Hallelujah!&quot; (1929), produced by King Vidor, in the late-night wedding scene.

<doc id="174834" wikidata="Q313925" url="?curid=174834" title="Thomas Browne">
<text>Sir Thomas Browne ( &quot;brown&quot;; 19 October 160519 October 1682) was an English polymath and author of varied works which reveal his wide learning in diverse fields including science and medicine, religion and the esoteric. His writings display a deep curiosity towards the natural world, influenced by the Scientific Revolution of Baconian enquiry and are permeated by references to Classical and Biblical sources as well as the idiosyncrasies of his own personality. Although often described as suffused with melancholia, Browne&#x27;s writings are also characterised by wit and subtle humour, while his literary style is varied, according to genre, resulting in a rich, unique prose which ranges from rough notebook observations to polished Baroque eloquence.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Thomas Browne was born in the parish of St Michael, Cheapside, in London on 19 October 1605. He was the youngest child of Thomas Browne, a silk merchant from Upton, Cheshire, and Anne Browne, the daughter of Paul Garraway of Lewes, Sussex. He had an elder brother and two elder sisters. The family, who had lived at Upton for several generations, were &quot;evidently people of some importance&quot; who &quot;intermarried with families of position in that neighbourhood&quot;, and were armigerous. Browne&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of Henry Birkenhead, Clerk of the Green Cloth to Elizabeth I of England and Clerk of the Crown for the counties of Cheshire and Flintshire. Browne&#x27;s father died while he was young, and his mother married Sir Thomas Dutton of Gloucester and Isleworth, Middlesex, by whom she had two daughters.
Browne was educated at Winchester College. In 1623, he went to Broadgates Hall of Oxford University. Browne was chosen to deliver the undergraduate oration when the hall was incorporated as Pembroke College in August 1624. He graduated from Oxford in January 1627, after which he studied medicine at Padua and Montpellier universities, completing his studies at Leiden, where he received a medical degree in 1633. He settled in Norwich in 1637 and practised medicine there until he died in 1682. 

In 1641, Browne married Dorothy Mileham of Burlingham St Peter, Norfolk. They had 10 children, six of whom died before their parents.

===Literary career===
Browne&#x27;s first literary work was &quot;Religio Medici&quot; &quot;(The Religion of a Physician)&quot;. It surprised him when an unauthorised edition appeared in 1642, which included unorthodox religious speculations. An authorised text appeared in 1643, with some of the more controversial views removed. The expurgation did not end the controversy. The Scottish writer Alexander Ross attacked in his (1645). Browne&#x27;s book was placed upon the Papal &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; in the same year.
In 1646 Browne published his encyclopaedia, &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or, Enquiries into Very many Received Tenents, and commonly Presumed Truths&quot;, the title of which refers to the prevalence of false beliefs and &quot;vulgar errors&quot;. A sceptical work that debunks in a methodical and witty manner several legends circulating at the time, it displays the Baconian side of Browne—the side that was unafraid of what at the time was still called the &quot;New Learning&quot;. The book is significant in the history of science because it promoted an awareness of scientific journalism.

The last works published by Browne were two philosophical Discourses. They are closely related to each other in concept. The first, &quot;Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial, or a Brief Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns lately found in Norfolk&quot; (1658), was inspired by the discovery in Norfolk of some 40 to 50 Anglo-Saxon burial urns. It is a literary meditation upon death, the funerary customs of the world and the ephemerality of fame. The other discourse in the diptych is antithetical in style, subject matter and imagery. &quot;The Garden of Cyrus, or The Quincuncial Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients, Artificially, Naturally, and Mystically Considered&quot; (1658) features the quincunx that Browne used to demonstrate evidence of the Platonic forms in art and nature.

=== Later life and knighthood ===

Browne believed in the existence of angels and witchcraft. He attended the 1662 Bury St Edmunds witch trial, where his citation of a similar trial in Denmark may have influenced the jury&#x27;s minds concerning two accused women, who were later found guilty of witchcraft.

In November 1671, King Charles II, accompanied by his Court, visited Norwich. The courtier John Evelyn, who had occasionally corresponded with Browne, made good use of the royal visit to call upon &quot;the learned doctor&quot; of European fame and wrote of his visit, recording that &quot;his whole house and garden is a paradise and Cabinet of rarities and that of the best collection, amongst Medails, books, Plants, natural things&quot;. During his visit, Charles visited Browne&#x27;s home. A banquet was held in St Andrew&#x27;s Hall for the royal visit. Obliged to honour a notable local, the name of the Mayor of Norwich was proposed to the King for knighthood. The Mayor, however, declined the honour and proposed Browne&#x27;s name instead.

=== Death and aftermath ===

Browne died on 19 October 1682, his 77th birthday. He was buried in the chancel of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich. His skull was removed when his lead coffin was accidentally re-opened by workmen in 1840. It was not re-interred in St Peter Mancroft until 4 July 1922 when it was recorded in the burial register as aged 317 years. Browne&#x27;s coffin plate, which was stolen the same time as his skull, was also eventually recovered, broken into two halves, one of which is on display at St Peter Mancroft. Alluding to the commonplace opus of alchemy it reads, &quot;Amplissimus Vir Dns. Thomas Browne, Miles, Medicinae Dr., Annos Natus 77 Denatus 19 Die mensis Octobris, Anno. Dni. 1682, hoc Loculo indormiens. Corporis Spagyrici pulvere plumbum in aurum Convertit.&quot; — translated from Latin as &quot;The esteemed Gentleman Thomas Browne, Knight, Doctor of Medicine, 77 years old, died on the 19th of October in the year of Our Lord 1682 and lies sleeping in this coffin. With the dust of his alchemical body he converts lead into gold&quot;. The origin of the invented word &quot;spagyrici&quot; is from the Greek &quot;spao&quot; to tear open + &quot;ageiro&quot; to collect, a signature neologism coined by Paracelsus to define his medicine-oriented alchemy; the origins of iatrochemistry, being first advanced by him.

Browne&#x27;s coffin-plate verse, along with the collected works of Paracelsus and several followers of the Swiss physician listed in his library, is evidence that although sometimes highly critical of Paracelsus, nevertheless, like the &#x27;Luther of Medicine&#x27;, he believed in palingenesis, physiognomy, alchemy, astrology and the kabbalah.

The Library of Sir Thomas Browne was held in the care of his eldest son Edward until 1708. The auction of Browne and his son Edward&#x27;s libraries in January 1711 was attended by Hans Sloane. Editions from the library were subsequently included in the founding collection of the British Library.

==Autobiography==
On 14 March 1673, Browne sent a short autobiography to the antiquarian John Aubrey, presumably for Aubrey&#x27;s collection of &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, which provides an introduction to his life and writings:

:...I was born in St Michael&#x27;s Cheap in London, went to school at Winchester College, then went to Oxford, spent some years in foreign parts, was admitted to be a &quot;Socius Honorarius&quot; of the College of Physicians in London, Knighted September 1671, when the King, Queen and Court came to Norwich. [Wrote] &quot;Religio Medici&quot; in English, which was since translated into Latin, French, Italian, High and Low Dutch. 
:&quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or Enquiries into Common and Vulgar Errors&quot; translated into Dutch four or five years ago.
:&quot;Hydriotaphia, or Urn Buriall.&quot; 
:&quot;Hortus Cyri [the Garden of Cyrus], or de Quincunce.&quot; 
:Have some miscellaneous tracts which may be published...

==Literary influence==

Browne is widely considered one of the most original writers in the English language. The freshness and ingenuity of his mind invested everything he touched with interest; while on more important subjects his style, if frequently ornate and Latinate, often rises to the highest pitch of stately eloquence. He has a paradoxical and ambiguous place in the history of ideas, as equally, a devout Christian, a promoter of the new inductive science, and an adherent of ancient esoteric learning. For these reasons, one literary critic succinctly assessed him as &quot;an instance of scientific reason lit up by mysticism in the Church of England&quot;. However, the complexity of Browne&#x27;s labyrinthine thought processes, his highly stylised language, his many allusions to Biblical, Classical and contemporary learning, along with esoteric authors, are each contributing factors to why he remains obscure, little-read, and, thus, misunderstood.

A master neologist, Browne appears at number 69 in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;″s list of top-cited sources. He has 775 entries in the OED of first usage of a word, is quoted in a total of 4131 entries of first evidence of a word, and is quoted 1596 times as first evidence of a particular meaning of a word. Examples of his coinages, many of which are of a scientific or medical nature, include &#x27;ambidextrous&#x27;, &#x27;antediluvian&#x27;, &#x27;analogous&#x27;, &#x27;approximate&#x27;, &#x27;ascetic&#x27;, &#x27;anomalous&#x27;, &#x27;carnivorous&#x27;, &#x27;coexistence&#x27;, &#x27;coma&#x27;, &#x27;compensate&#x27;, &#x27;computer&#x27;, &#x27;cryptography&#x27;, &#x27;cylindrical&#x27;, &#x27;disruption&#x27;, &#x27;ergotisms&#x27;, &#x27;electricity&#x27;, &#x27;exhaustion&#x27;, &#x27;ferocious&#x27;, &#x27;follicle&#x27;, &#x27;generator&#x27;, &#x27;gymnastic&#x27;, &#x27;hallucination&#x27;, &#x27;herbaceous&#x27;, &#x27;holocaust&#x27;, &#x27;insecurity&#x27;, &#x27;indigenous&#x27;, &#x27;jocularity&#x27;, &#x27;literary&#x27;, &#x27;locomotion&#x27;, &#x27;medical&#x27;, &#x27;migrant&#x27;, &#x27;mucous&#x27;, &#x27;prairie&#x27;, &#x27;prostate&#x27;, &#x27;polarity&#x27;, &#x27;precocious&#x27;, &#x27;pubescent&#x27;, &#x27;therapeutic&#x27;, &#x27;suicide&#x27;, &#x27;ulterior&#x27;, &#x27;ultimate&#x27; and &#x27;veterinarian&#x27;.

The influence of his literary style spans four centuries. In the 19th century, Browne&#x27;s reputation was revived by the Romantics. Thomas De Quincey, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Charles Lamb (who considered himself the rediscoverer of Browne) were all admirers. Carlyle was also influenced by him.

The composer William Alwyn wrote a symphony in 1973 based upon the rhythmical cadences of Browne&#x27;s literary work &quot;Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial&quot;.

The Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges alluded to Browne throughout his literary writings, from his first publication, &quot;Fervor de Buenos Aires&quot; (1923) until his last years. He described Browne as &quot;the best prose writer in the English language&quot;.

==Recognition==
In the 18th century, Samuel Johnson, who shared Browne&#x27;s love of the Latinate, wrote a brief &quot;Life&quot; in which he praised Browne as a faithful Christian and assessed his prose.

The English author Virginia Woolf wrote two short essays about him, observing in 1923, &quot;Few people love the writings of Sir Thomas Browne, but those who do are the salt of the earth.&quot;

Clive James included an essay on Browne in his &quot;Cultural Amnesia&quot; collection. James celebrated Browne&#x27;s style and originality, stating that Browne was &quot;minting new coin&quot; with everything he wrote.

== Portraits and influence in the visual arts ==

The National Portrait Gallery in London has a contemporary portrait by Joan Carlile of Sir Thomas Browne and his wife Dorothy, probably completed between 1641 and 1650.

More recent sculptural portraits include Henry Alfred Pegram&#x27;s 1905 statue of Sir Thomas contemplating with an urn in Norwich. This statue occupies the central position in the Haymarket beside St Peter Mancroft, not far from the site of his house. Unveiled on 19 October 1905, it was moved from its original position in 1973 and once more in 2023.

* In 1931 the English painter Paul Nash was invited to illustrate a book of his own choice, Nash chose Sir Thomas Browne&#x27;s &quot;Urn Burial&quot; and &quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot;, providing the publisher with a set of 32 illustrations to accompany Browne&#x27;s Discourses. The edition was published in 1932. A pencil drawing by Nash called &quot;Urne Buriall: Teeth, Bones and Hair&quot; is held by Birmingham Museums Trust.

* In 2005 a small standing figure in silver and bronze, commissioned for the 400th anniversary of Browne&#x27;s birth, was sculpted by Robert Mileham. 

* In 2016 the artists Peter Rodulfo and Mark Burrell elected Browne as honorary &quot;Great-Grandfather&quot; of the North Sea Magical Realists art-movement. Simultaneously they realised in painting items taken from Browne&#x27;s &quot;Musaeum Clausum&quot; in its &quot;Rarities in Pictures&quot; section.

<text>The Shim Sham Shimmy, Shim Sham or just Sham originally is a particular tap dance routine and is regarded as tap dance&#x27;s national anthem. For today&#x27;s swing dancers, it is a line dance.

==History==
In the late 1920s, when Leonard Reed and Willie Bryant were with the Whitman Sisters troupe on the T.O.B.A. circuit in Chicago, they created a tap dance routine they called &quot;Goofus&quot; to the tune Turkey in the Straw. The routine consisted of standard steps: eight bars each of the Double Shuffle, the Cross Over, Tack Annie (an up-and-back shuffle), and Falling Off a Log.

In early 1930s, the Shim Sham was performed on stage in Harlem at places like Connie&#x27;s Inn, Dickie Wells&#x27;s Shim Sham Club, the 101 Ranch, the LaFayette Theatre, and the Harlem Opera House.

At the end of many performances, all of the musicians, singers, and dancers would get together on stage and do one last routine: the Shim Sham Shimmy. Tap dancers would perform technical variations, while singers and musicians would shuffle along as they were able. For example, in 1931 flash dance act The Three Little Words would close their show at Connie&#x27;s Inn with the Shim Sham, and invite everyone to join in, &quot;and the whole club would join us, including the waiters. For awhile people were doing the Shim Sham up and down Seventh Avenue all night long,&quot; according to Joe Jones.

According to tap dancer Howard “Stretch” Johnson the word &quot;Shim&quot; was a contraction of the term &quot;she-him&quot;, a reference to the fact that the female chorus line dancers at the 101 Ranch were played by men.

At the Savoy Ballroom, some lindy hoppers did the shim sham as a group line dance, without the taps. A bunch of dancers would just jump up and start doing the shim sham on the side of the ballroom, over in the corner. Although a few people might join in, most everybody else kept on dancing without paying any attention to it.

In the mid-1980s, Frankie Manning introduced the shim sham at New York Swing Dance Society dances, and he also created a special version of the shim sham for swing dancers. Frankie Manning&#x27;s version of the shim sham caught on, and it&#x27;s now done at swing dances worldwide.

==Variations==

There are several variations of &quot;shim sham&quot; choreography. There is the choreography used by Leonard Reed and Willie Bryant, as well as a number of variations by Leonard Reed and others. Other &quot;shim sham&quot; choreographies include ones by Frankie Manning, Al Minns and Leon James (also called the &quot;Savoy Shim Sham&quot;), and Dean Collins.
The Leonard Reed Shim Shams:

* The original Shim Sham from 1927, a 32-bar chorus composed of four steps and a break
* The Freeze Chorus, circa 1930s, the original Shim Sham without the breaks
* The Joe Louis Shuffle Shim Sham, 1948, a tap-swing dance 32-bar chorus number that Leonard Reed performed with the World Heavyweight Boxing champ Joe Louis
* The Shim Sham II, 1994, a 32-bar chorus dance based on the original Shim Sham
* The Revenge of the Shim Sham, 2002, a 32-bar chorus dance, Leonard Reed’s final Shim Sham, which builds upon his original four (the name was suggested by Maxwell DeMille at a performance at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles).

==The dance==
The Shim Sham is 10 phrases of choreography (each phrase lasting four 8-counts), so it does not usually take up an entire song. After the Shim Sham was over, the dancers then would exit either stage left or right, depending on what was agreed upon for that show.

Today in the Lindy Hop scene, once the Shim Sham choreography is over, dancers typically grab a partner and break into lindy hop for the remainder of the song. During this portion of the song, the band or a DJ may call out &quot;Freeze!&quot; or &quot;Slow!&quot; instructing the dancers to either stop where they are or dance slowly, then call out &quot;Dance!&quot; to tell everyone to resume normal dancing. The Frankie Manning version repeats the basic choreography (replacing each of the break steps with an 8-beat hold), then adds two Boogie Back/Boogie Forward phrases and two Boogie Back/Shorty George phrases to the end of the second repetition of the basic choreography. Only after the final Shorty George is completed do the dancers break into freestyle Lindy Hop.

==The music==
The Shim Sham goes best with swing songs whose melody lines start on beat eight, as does the choreography. An obvious choice is The Shim Sham Song (Bill Elliot Swing Orchestra), which was written specifically for this dance and has musical effects (e.g., breaks) in all the right places. However, today the Shim Sham — particularly the Frankie Manning version — is danced more often to &quot;&#x27;Tain&#x27;t What You Do (It&#x27;s The Way That Cha Do It)&quot; by Jimmie Lunceford and His Orchestra, or &quot;Tuxedo Junction&quot; by Erskine Hawkins. In fact, it is typical now at a Lindy dance party for dancers to start up a Shim Sham whenever &quot;&#x27;Tain&#x27;t What You Do&quot; is played. There is also a recording &quot;Stompin&#x27; at the Savoy&quot; with the George Gee band where Manning himself calls out the moves.

==The steps==
These are the steps of the original 32-bar Shim Sham:

===Step 1: The shim sham/double shuffle===
===The break===
===Step 2: Push and cross/Crossover===
===Step 3: Tacky Annies/Tack Annies===
===Step 4: Half breaks/Falling-off-the-log===

<text>Yo La Tengo (Spanish for &quot;I&#x27;ve got it&quot;; also abbreviated as YLT) is an American indie rock band formed in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1984. Since 1992, the lineup has consisted of Ira Kaplan (guitars, piano, vocals), Georgia Hubley (drums, piano, vocals), and James McNew (bass, vocals). In 2015, original guitarist Dave Schramm rejoined the band and appeared on their fourteenth album, &quot;Stuff Like That There&quot;.

Despite achieving limited mainstream success, Yo La Tengo has been called &quot;the quintessential critics&#x27; band&quot; and maintains a strong cult following. Though they mostly play original material, the band performs a wide repertoire of cover songs both in live performance and on record.

==History==
===Formation and early history, 1984–1985===
Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley formed the band as a couple in 1984. They chose the name Yo La Tengo, Spanish for &quot;I have it&quot;. The name came from a baseball anecdote from the 1962 season, when New York Mets center fielder Richie Ashburn and shortstop Elio Chacón collided in the outfield. When Ashburn went for a catch, he would yell, &quot;I got it! I got it!&quot; only to run into Chacón, a Venezuelan who spoke only Spanish. Ashburn learned to yell, &quot;Yo la tengo! Yo la tengo!&quot; instead. In a later game, Ashburn happily saw Chacón backing off. He relaxed, positioned himself to catch the ball, and was run over by left fielder Frank Thomas, who understood no Spanish and had missed a team meeting that proposed using the words &quot;Yo la tengo!&quot; as a way to avoid outfield collisions. After getting up, Thomas asked Ashburn, &quot;What the hell is a yellow tango?&quot;

Kaplan and Hubley placed an advertisement to recruit other musicians who shared their love for bands such as the Soft Boys, Mission of Burma, and Arthur Lee&#x27;s Love. The group&#x27;s debut recording was a 7&quot; single, &quot;The River of Water&quot;, backed with a cover of Lee&#x27;s &quot;A House Is Not a Motel&quot;, released in late 1985 with Dave Schramm on lead guitar and Dave Rick on bass. After recording &quot;Private Doberman&quot; for the Coyote Records compilation &quot;Luxury Condos Coming to Your Neighborhood Soon&quot;, Rick left the band and was replaced by Mike Lewis, the founding bass player of Boston garage-punk bands DMZ and Lyres, who was also a member of Brooklyn garage rock band the A-Bones throughout his tenure in YLT.

===Early releases, 1986–1989===
In 1986, Yo La Tengo released their first LP, &quot;Ride the Tiger&quot; on Coyote Records. Produced by former Mission of Burma bassist Clint Conley who also took over bass duties on three songs, the album &quot;marked Yo La Tengo as a band with real potential&quot; according to reviewer Mark Deming. Kaplan was credited as &quot;naive guitar&quot; on the sleeve, and in the liner notes for the 1993 reissue of the album on City Slang Records, went so far as to say &quot;Dave&#x27;s guitar playing is inarguably the best thing about the record.&quot;

Schramm and Lewis left the band after the album&#x27;s release, with Kaplan subsequently taking on the role of lead guitar and Stephan Wichnewski joining to play bass. The group&#x27;s next album &quot;New Wave Hot Dogs&quot; (1987) sold poorly, but, per Deming, &quot;was a quantum leap over the sound of their debut.&quot;

The release of &quot;President Yo La Tengo&quot; in 1989 did much to establish the band&#x27;s reputation among rock critics; Robert Christgau praised the &quot;mysterioso guitar hook&quot; of the first song, &quot;Barnaby, Hardly Working&quot;. Produced by Gene Holder of The dB&#x27;s, the album was the band&#x27;s last release on Coyote. Despite the album&#x27;s positive reception, sales were still poor and Wichnewski left the band not long after. Hubley and Kaplan carried on as a duo and began playing two-electric-guitar shows.

===Bar/None and Alias Records, 1990–1992===
Yo La Tengo reunited with Dave Schramm in 1990 to record &quot;Fakebook&quot;, an album of mostly acoustic tunes, including covers of Cat Stevens, Gene Clark, the Kinks, Daniel Johnston, among others. It also featured five original songs, including an acoustic version of &quot;Barnaby, Hardly Working&quot;. Again produced by Gene Holder, the album&#x27;s folk sound was a change of pace for the band. Years later, Kaplan recalled that the album was &quot;just me and Georgia looking for an excuse to record with Dave Schramm and Al Greller&quot; who played guitar and double bass on the album, respectively.

In 1991, with Dave Schramm in tow, Yo La Tengo collaborated with Daniel Johnston on the song &quot;Speeding Motorcycle&quot; which was released as a single. The band also released a 7&quot; single on Bar/None Records with the song &quot;Walking Away from You&quot; backed with a cover of Beat Happening&#x27;s &quot;Cast a Shadow.&quot; Gene Holder produced the single and played the bass. The &quot;That Is Yo La Tengo&quot; EP released later that year included some tracks that would end up on the group&#x27;s next LP.

After the release of &quot;That Is Yo La Tengo&quot;, James McNew (who also records under the solo moniker Dump) began playing bass with the band, forming the trio that continues to make up the band today. According to McNew,

The band recorded &quot;May I Sing with Me&quot; in Boston with Holder producing and Lou Giordano engineering. The album was released on Alias Records in 1992. Three of the album&#x27;s eleven songs (&quot;Swing for Life&quot;, &quot;Out the Window&quot; and &quot;Five-Cornered Drone&quot;) were carried over from the &quot;That Is Yo La Tengo&quot; EP and feature Holder on bass. The &quot;Upside-Down&quot; EP was released on CD in support of the album, rounding out the band&#x27;s releases on Alias.

===Early Matador period, 1993–2000===
In 1993, Yo La Tengo began their partnership with Matador Records, releasing a 7&quot; and CD5 of the song &quot;Shaker&quot; which the band recorded with John Siket in New Jersey. The following LP, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Painful&quot;, was also the beginning of the band&#x27;s fruitful creative partnership with producer Roger Moutenot, who has produced all of their subsequent albums up until 2013&#x27;s &quot;Fade&quot;, which was produced by John McEntire. &quot;Painful&quot; is the first Yo La Tengo album to feature James McNew on every song. Ira Kaplan explains:

Rob Sheffield, writing in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; remarked that McNew &quot;became an essential part of the sound on &quot;Painful&quot;, the 1993 album that kept every promise Yo La Tengo ever made and blew their previous highlights away.&quot; Critical reaction was quite positive, with reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine calling it &quot;a subtly addicting album.&quot; Robert Christgau also praised the group once again, writing in his review that Yo La Tengo is &quot;always friendly. This is not the forbidding experimentation of an aspiring vanguard. This is the fooling around of folks who like to go out on Saturday night and make some noise—and then go home humming it.&quot; The band released &quot;Electr-O-Pura&quot; in 1995 to similar acclaim. For the first time, all songs were credited to the band as a whole rather than individual members; this became the norm for all future releases.

In 1996 the band had a role in the movie I Shot Andy Warhol as an anonymous version of the Velvet Underground, a Warhol-associated band to whom Yo La Tengo were often compared in their early years.

The band&#x27;s 1997 LP &quot;I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One&quot; synthesized the group&#x27;s eclectic combination of folk, punk rock, shoegazing, long instrumental noise-jams, and electronic music into a sprawling, multi-faceted style. Critical reaction was extremely positive; Pitchfork awarded the album a 9.7 out of 10, and AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that it was &quot;arguably Yo La Tengo&#x27;s finest and most coherent album to date.&quot; Kaplan recalled a turning point in the band&#x27;s musical progression:

With their critical reputation higher than ever before, the band toured extensively and their fan base continued to grow. In 1998, they collaborated with Jad Fair and released the album &quot;Strange but True&quot; to mixed reviews. Yo La Tengo had a cameo role as a Salvation Army band in the 1998 Hal Hartley film &quot;The Book of Life&quot;, and feature on its 1999 soundtrack release. The band entered the studio again in late 1999 to record their ninth LP. &quot;And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out&quot; was released in February 2000 to a warm reception. The album features some intimate songs with hushed, varied instrumentation and includes the 17-minute meditation &quot;Night Falls On Hoboken&quot;.

===Continued acclaim and soundtrack work, 2001–present===
In 2001, Yo La Tengo recorded an instrumental score for eight short undersea documentaries by Jean Painlevé, entitled &quot;The Sounds of the Sounds of Science&quot;. The program debuted at the San Francisco Film Festival and has been performed live approximately twelve times. The band also released an EP with covers of Sun Ra&#x27;s &quot;Nuclear War&quot; in late 2002.

The band&#x27;s tenth LP, &quot;Summer Sun&quot;, was released in 2003. Although the album received generally favorable reviews, some critics found the album&#x27;s quiet atmosphere &quot;underwhelming.&quot; Others criticized the band for a perceived lack of invention. When asked about the album&#x27;s quiet nature, Kaplan stated,

Yo La Tengo collaborated with Yoko Ono on the 2003 charity album &quot;Wig in a Box: Songs from and Inspired by Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; in support of the Harvey Milk High School. The band put together their first &quot;best of&quot; compilation entitled &quot;Prisoners of Love: A Smattering of Scintillating Senescent Songs: 1985–2003&quot; which was released in 2005. They composed scores for four more films, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Junebug&quot; and &quot;Game 6&quot;, and 2006&#x27;s &quot;Shortbus&quot; and &quot;Old Joy&quot;. Their scores for these four films were collected on the 2008 compilation &quot;They Shoot, We Score&quot;.

Their eleventh LP, &quot;I Am Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Ass&quot;, was released in 2006 to universal acclaim. Informed by their soundtrack work, the arrangements included more strings and horns than any of the band&#x27;s previous albums. Kaplan told an interviewer: &quot;I think we gained an element of comfort with using that kind of instrumentation, and it became something we could draw on for our other songs.&quot; In addition, the album was book-ended with two guitar jams lasting over ten minutes each.

In 2006, the band released &quot;Yo La Tengo Is Murdering the Classics&quot;, a compilation of their live impromptu cover-song performances on the New Jersey freeform radio station, WFMU. As part of the station&#x27;s annual fundraising marathon, listeners who called in to pledge money to the station could request a favorite which the band then performed on the spot. In late 2007, the band began performing acoustically for &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Yo La Tengo&quot; tour. Audiences were encouraged to request songs and ask questions which, Kaplan stated, the band tried to answer &quot;in a strategic manner so that the answers to the questions will lead to the next song.&quot;

In March 2008, Yo La Tengo performed under the alias &quot;Condo Fucks&quot; at Brooklyn&#x27;s Magnetic Field. As Condo Fucks, the band released an album of cover songs, &quot;Fuckbook&quot;, on Matador in March 2009.

&quot;Popular Songs&quot;, the band&#x27;s 12th album, was released on September 8, 2009. The album was recorded in the band&#x27;s rehearsal space in New Jersey and features two songs with elaborate string sections (composed by jazz composer Richard Evans). It entered the Billboard chart at No. 58, the highest entry of the band&#x27;s career thus far.

In 2009, Yo La Tengo contributed to &quot;&quot;, a tribute album for New Zealand rock and roll musician Chris Knox who suffered a stroke in June 2009. Yo La Tengo covered Knox&#x27;s song &quot;Coloured&quot;. All proceeds from the album went towards Knox&#x27;s recovery. Also in 2009, Yo La Tengo contributed a cover of the song &quot;Gentle Hour&quot; to the AIDS benefit album, Dark Was the Night, produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Preceding their album &quot;Popular Songs&quot;, Yo La Tengo released an EP titled &quot;Here to Fall Remixes&quot; in the summer of 2010. Remixes of their single “Here to Fall” were done by De La Soul, RJD2, and Pete Rock. This was Yo La Tengo&#x27;s third out-of-the-box remix EP in 14 years, following the &quot;Autumn Sweater Remix&quot; and &quot;Danelectro Remix&quot; EPs.

In 2012 Yo La Tengo recorded a cover of Todd Rundgren&#x27;s &quot;I Saw the Light&quot; for a fund raising CD titled &quot;Super Hits Of The Seventies&quot; for radio station WFMU. In August 2012 they announced the release of an EP in September 2012, to be followed by an album in January 2013. The EP includes three versions of the song &quot;Stupid Things&quot;: the single version, a remix by EYƎ, and the original 12-minute instrumental version.

The following album, &quot;Fade&quot;, was released on January 15, 2013.

In 2014 they toured and performed live onstage as film maker Sam Green live narrated an evolving version of his new film The Love Song of R. Buckminster Fuller in Austin, Burlington, Detroit, Ithaca, Portland, New Orleans and Vancouver.

In 2014, they played an Indiana-based Night Ranger cover band &quot;Bobby Night Ranger&quot; in the final episode of season 6 of the television series Parks and Recreation.

On August 28, 2015, Yo La Tengo released &quot;Stuff Like That There&quot;, an album (and &quot;a sequel of sorts to Fakebook&quot;) of re-recorded versions of some of their old songs as well as covers, including songs by The Cure, Hank Williams, and Sun Ra.

In 2016, the band released &quot;Murder in the Second Degree&quot;, a second compilation of their live impromptu cover-song performances on the New Jersey freeform radio station, WFMU.

In 2017, the band played two dates in New York City with Robyn Hitchcock. The performances included the Hitchcock album &quot;Black Snake Diamond Role&quot; in its entirety, as well as collections of classic Hitchcock songs and covers of other artists.

In 2018, Yo La Tengo released their 15th studio album, &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Going On&quot;, which Pitchfork decided &#x27;reflects the group&#x27;s greatest and most instantly recognizable strengths&#x27;.
In 2020, Yo La Tengo released &quot;We Have Amnesia Sometimes&quot; which was recorded over a 10-day period from late April to early May amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The album consists of five instrumental, ambient compositions which were recorded with one microphone in the room and the band spread out adhering to social distance protocols laid out by Governor Murphy of New Jersey.

On February 10, 2023, the band released their seventeenth studio album &quot;This Stupid World&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==
AllMusic describes Yo La Tengo&#x27;s style as diverse, incorporating &quot;noisy&quot; guitar work and &quot;dreamy&quot; melodies that are &quot;infused with an understated sweetness that made even their noisiest freakouts feel accessible and their extended jams compelling in their exploration&quot;. They have cited the Kinks, the Velvet Underground and My Bloody Valentine as influences.

<doc id="174839" wikidata="Q3305766" url="?curid=174839" title="Austin City Limits">
<text>Austin City Limits is an American live music television program recorded and produced by Austin PBS. The show helped Austin become widely known in the United States as the &quot;Live Music Capital of the World&quot;, and is the only television show to receive the National Medal of Arts, which it was awarded in 2003. It also won a rare institutional Peabody Award in 2011 &quot;for its more than three decades of presenting and preserving eclectic American musical genres&quot;. &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; is produced by Austin PBS under the Capital of Texas Public Telecommunications Council. The show was created in 1974 by Bill Arhos, Bruce Scafe, and Paul Bosner.

Beginning in season 15 (1990), &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; began broadcasting in Dolby Surround, and continued until season 24 (1999). From 1976 to 2004 (seasons 1-29), the show was broadcast in NTSC. From 2004 to 2007 (seasons 30-32), the show was broadcast in HDTV 720p. Beginning in season 33 (2007–2008), the show began broadcasting in widescreen 1080i.

==Format==
Each episode begins with a preview of the artist as read by executive producer Terry Lickona, which leads into an opening credit sequence. After the credits, Lickona would introduce the artist. The camera was usually positioned during the performance to permit various closeup shots. After the performance, there was an interview segment. After the interview segment, Lickona would introduce the next artist, and another interview segment, followed by the closing credits. The show consisted of two artists in a half-hour format, as well as one artist in a one hour format. Beginning in season 30 (2004–2005) and continuing to today, Lickona would ask the artist a question. Beginning in season 46, Lickona appeared on camera to introduce that night&#x27;s performance, as well as the interview segments. The show was originally taped at KLRU&#x27;s Studio 6A during the first 36 seasons (1976-2011). Beginning in season 37 (2011-2012), the show moved to its current home at the Moody Theater.

==Songwriters Special==
Beginning in season 5 (1980), &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; introduced its Songwriters Special, which remained in use until season 34 (2008–2009). The first Songwriters Special included performances by Willie Nelson, Floyd Tillman, Hank Cochran, Red Lane, Whitey Shafer, and Sonny Throckmorton.

==Television pilot==
The pilot was shot on October 17, 1974, and starred Willie Nelson. (B.W. Stevenson was actually taped the night before, but the recording was deemed unusable). The deliberate lack of production slickness plus attention to audio detail pleased even the notoriously TV-shy Nelson. Lead Marketer Ken Waggoner, and &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; creator Bill Arhos pitched the pilot to PBS as part of its 1975 pledge drive. The show&#x27;s success as a fundraiser was enough for Arhos to get &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; green-lighted as a series.

==Availability==
The show inspired the creation of the Austin City Limits Music Festival, an annual live music festival at Zilker Park in Austin.
In 1982, Bill Arhos returned to &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; as the executive producer starting in season 7, and he stayed until his retirement in season 24 (1999). In 2015, Arhos died at the age of 80. In 2014, he was inducted into the &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; Hall of Fame.
Some of the performances from &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; have been released as CDs and DVDs in the &quot;Live from Austin, TX&quot; series. Full episodes can also be viewed online at the show&#x27;s official website. There is an &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; store at the Austin Bergstrom International Airport.

On June 21, 2012, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio, announced that nearly 40 years of &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; footage would be digitally archived &quot;in perpetuity&quot; at the Museum&#x27;s new Library and Archives; recordings from more than 800 live performances will be made available to the public.

On September 9, 2018, Austin City Limits Radio was launched in Austin at 97.1 FM (utilizing a leased HD Radio subchannel of KGSR (93.3-HD2)), with an eclectic playlist representative of the television show&#x27;s history.

==Syndication==
In 1981, &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; began syndicating to local stations under the moniker &quot;Austin City Limits Encore&quot;. MTV Live (formerly Palladia HD) acquired rerun rights to the series in 2016 under the moniker &quot;Best of Austin City Limits&quot;. From 2002 to 2003, CMT (formerly Country Music Television) repackaged several country music-themed episodes under the moniker &quot;Best of Austin City Limits&quot;. When &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; aired on CMT, episodes ran for 42 minutes to make room for commercials, and began with an introduction by Charlie Robison and Tara McNamara. From 1992 to 1993, TNN repackaged older &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; performers under the moniker &quot;Austin Encore&quot;. The program also aired on CMT Canada from 1998 to 2002.

==Production==

Joe Gracey was talent coordinator during season 1. 
Executive producer Dick Peterson joined KLRU in 1984 and was promoted to Executive producer of Austin City Limits in 2000. Executive producer Terry Lickona joined the program in 1979 during season 4 as a producer and followed Peterson after Peterson&#x27;s retirement in 2009. The first director of &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; was Bruce Scafe, who was the director for the show&#x27;s first two seasons in 1976 and 1977; Charles Vaughn took over as producer-director in season 3 (1978); Clark Santee took over as director in season 4 (1979); Allan Muir took over as director in season 5 (1980), and he continued until season 7 (1982); Gary Menotti replaced Allan Muir as the show&#x27;s current director starting in season 8 (1983). The boom crane used throughout the show&#x27;s tenure at studio 6B was the original boom crane used in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

==Venues==

For the first 36 seasons, &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; was taped at Studio 6A in the Communications Building B on the University of Texas at Austin campus, on a stage featuring a mock skyline of Austin in the background, which was introduced in season 7 (1982). The studio had a seating capacity of approximately 800, but due to limited access to fire exits the audience size was limited to 300. In 2010, the show and its original studio were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A plaque near the entrance to Communications Building B commemorating the occasion proclaims &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; as the &quot;longest running music show in the history of American television&quot;. On February 26, 2011, &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; held its first taping in its new purpose-built Austin City Limits Live at The Moody Theater in downtown Austin&#x27;s Block 21. The additional seating capacity of 2,750 is used for an estimated 100 concerts and 100 private events per year at the venue.

==40th season==
On December 2, 2014, in celebration of Austin City Limits&#x27; 40th season, a DVD titled &quot;Austin City Limits Celebrates 40 Years&quot; was released.

<text>Sidney Simien (April 9, 1938 – February 25, 1998), known professionally as Rockin&#x27; Sidney, was an American R&amp;B, zydeco, and soul musician who began recording in the late 1950s and continued performing until his death. He is best known for his 1985 single &quot;My Toot-Toot&quot;, which reached top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts and earned him a Grammy Award.

==Biography==
Sidney Simien was born on April 9, 1938, in Lebeau, Louisiana. He was born into a Creole French-speaking family and was a descendant of Antoine—of Marseille, France—and Marie Simien (who was a free woman of color and a plantation owner). Sidney himself was born in the tiny farming community of Lebeau, St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, United States. Sidney took up the guitar at an early age. He started his musical career at age 14 or 15 playing harmonica and guitar. His first gig was as backup for his uncle Frank Simien. By Sidney&#x27;s late teens, he was leading his own band as Sidney Simien and His All Stars, which included several members of his family. In 1957, at the age of 18, he recorded his first side, &quot;Make Me Understand,&quot; on the short-lived Carl label. &quot;No Good Woman&quot; became a small hit in Louisiana in 1962, while the flip side, &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Nothing But Fine&quot; brought him his first national attention as a songwriter. The Fabulous Thunderbirds recorded the song on their debut album. After that, Sidney recorded &quot;She&#x27;s My Morning Coffee&quot; / &quot;Calling You&quot; on the Jin label.

Although his real success came from zydeco, Sidney did not start out playing the accordion or Cajun music. Heavily influenced by local musicians such as Slim Harpo and Cookie and his Cupcakes, Sidney made R&amp;B-styled recordings briefly on the Louisiana record label, Fame, during the late 1950s. He was often backed by George Lewis on harmonica and Katie Webster on piano. Floyd Soileau&#x27;s Jin Records label released nine Rockin&#x27; Sidney singles between 1957–1964. Sidney also recorded on Rod Records. In 1963 his single &quot;No Good Woman&quot; on the Ville Platte label sold well in South Louisiana and East Texas and was well received by music critics, but just missed the national Top 100.

In 1965, he and his band The Dukes signed with Eddie Shuler&#x27;s Louisiana-based Goldband Records. He took to wearing a turban and was known as &quot;Count Rockin&#x27; Sidney&quot;. During this period he cut well over a dozen R&amp;B, soul, and blues singles such as &quot;Something Working Baby&quot; and &quot;Soul Christmas&quot;, without much success. Between the mid-1960s and the late 1970s, Sidney cut well over 50 singles for the Louisiana-based Goldband label, working in a variety of contemporary blues, soul and R&amp;B modes; none proved successful.

===Zydeco===
In the late 1970s Sidney was performing solo organ gigs at Lake Charles hotels and lounges when he recognized zydeco&#x27;s growing popularity. Floyd Soileau takes partial credit, saying &quot;I suppose it was the mid-&#x27;70s when I suggested that he pick up the accordion and start doing zydeco which was then making a comeback.&quot; Sidney quickly added the instrument to his repertoire and made that traditional folk music of Louisiana his focus. Zydeco was long familiar to him, from his Creole heritage. His Clifton Chenier and Buckwheat Zydeco parodies became one of his performance highlights. For Chenier, Sidney dressed up as the zydeco monarch, complete with a crown, cape and gold tooth. The Buckwheat bit was done with a ventriloquist dummy. His first zydeco album, &quot;Give Me a Good Time Woman&quot; was released in 1982 on the Maison de Soul label. 
&quot;He already knew keyboards and that was half the battle,&quot; said Soileau. In the late 1970s, Sidney was recording for a new label, Bally Hoo, and started his own publishing company, Sid Sim Publishing. His zydeco talents were immediately recognized and he had another hit with &quot;Louisiana Creole Man.&quot; He also signed a lease agreement with Floyd Soileau to distribute his recordings on Soileau&#x27;s Maison de Soul Records label, giving Soileau&#x27;s Flat Town Music Company a share of the profits. By the early 1980s, Sidney had recorded two successful albums for Maison de Soul, &quot;Give Me A Good Time Woman&quot; and &quot;Boogie, Blues &#x27;N&#x27; Zydeco&quot;.

===&quot;My Toot Toot&quot;===

His big moment came in 1984 when &quot;My Toot Toot&quot; made him internationally known. Sidney wrote the song, and released it on the Maison de Soul Records label in Ville Platte, Louisiana. In October 1984, he included the tune on his third album, &quot;My Zydeco Shoes Got the Zydeco Blues&quot;. He recorded the entire album at his home studio in Lake Charles, and played all the instruments himself. In January 1985, &quot;My Toot Toot&quot; was released as a single in Louisiana and Texas, and became his first true regional hit. Thanks to Cleon Floyd, manager of R&amp;B singer (and uncle to) King Floyd, it became a huge New Orleans hit. Floyd first heard the crowd&#x27;s reaction to the song at a bill headlined by Solomon Burke. Cleon was also the president of the Orleans Street Jocks Association and took 20 copies of the record back to the city; he quickly had to order more. By Mardi Gras, it was a jukebox and record hop smash.

Huey Meaux got the original leased to Epic Records (a division of Columbia Records), who released it nationally, and for a brief moment Rockin&#x27; Sidney made musical history. Epic managed to get Rockin&#x27; Sidney into the country Top 40 where it stayed for 18 weeks. Later that year, &quot;My Toot Toot&quot; was certified platinum and won a Grammy Award. &quot;My Toot Toot&quot; became a national and international million-selling phenomenon.

Sidney was featured in &quot;People&quot; magazine, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Music City News&quot; and appeared on numerous national TV shows, including &quot;Nashville Now&quot;, Church Street Station, &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, John Fogerty&#x27;s Showtime Special, New Country and Charlie Daniels Jam. He was also a guest celebrity on &quot;You Can Be a Star&quot;. &quot;My Toot Toot&quot; was played in the motion pictures &quot;Hard Luck&quot;, &quot;One Good Cop&quot;, and &quot;The Big Easy&quot;.

&quot;My Toot Toot&quot; has been covered by many artists including Fats Domino, Rosie Ledet, Jean Knight, Terrance Simien, Doug Kershaw, Denise LaSalle, Jimmy C. Newman and John Fogerty. A Spanish version by La Sonora Dinamita titled &quot;Mi Cucu&quot; sold over a million copies in Mexico, Central America, and South America. A German beer company licensed it to use in their radio and television commercials. The German cover version &quot;Mein Tuut Tuut&quot; by Leinemann reached no. 15 on the German charts in 1985. Over 20 years after &quot;My Toot Toot&quot; debuted, it continued to draw royalties from commercial use in Europe, and cover versions in several languages by dozens of musicians.

===Later years===
Sidney used royalties from &quot;My Toot Toot&quot; to purchase radio station KAOK in Lake Charles. He also bought Festival City, a entertainment complex in Lake Charles, and started a record label, ZBC Records. After the success of &quot;My Toot Toot,&quot; Sidney toured the United States and Europe and continued to record, characteristically playing all parts. Although nothing before or after ever matched the career-defining success of &quot;My Toot Toot,&quot; several of his songs such as &quot;If It&#x27;s Good for the Gander,&quot; &quot;My Zydeco Shoes,&quot; &quot;Jalapeño Lena&quot;, and &quot;Ann Cayenne&quot; have become zydeco staples and are played regularly by other bands.

After a long bout with throat cancer, Rockin&#x27; Sidney Simien succumbed to the disease in 1998, leaving his legacy to his wife, three sons, and four grandchildren. He was funeralized at his hometown church, Immaculate Conception in Lebeau, and buried in the church cemetery.

<doc id="174843" wikidata="Q999968" url="?curid=174843" title="Buckwheat Zydeco">
<text>Stanley Dural Jr. (November 14, 1947 – September 24, 2016), better known by his stage name Buckwheat Zydeco, was an American accordionist and zydeco musician. He was one of the few zydeco artists to achieve mainstream success. His music group was formally billed as Buckwheat Zydeco and Ils Sont Partis Band (&quot;Ils Sont Partis&quot; being French for &quot;They have left,&quot; or a race announcer&#x27;s &quot;And they&#x27;re off!&quot;), but they often performed as merely Buckwheat Zydeco.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;Stanley &#x27;Buckwheat&#x27; Dural leads one of the best bands in America. A down-home and high-powered celebration, meaty and muscular with a fine-tuned sense of dynamics…propulsive rhythms, incendiary performances.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; called him &quot;a zydeco trailblazer.&quot;
Buckwheat Zydeco performed with famous musicians such as Eric Clapton (with whom he also recorded), U2 and the Boston Pops. The band performed at the closing ceremonies of the 1996 Summer Olympics to a worldwide audience of three billion people. Buckwheat performed for President Clinton twice, celebrating both of his inaugurations. The band appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;CNN&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;MTV&quot;, &quot;NBC News&quot;, &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;, National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Mountain Stage&quot;, and &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

==Early life==
Dural was born in Lafayette, Louisiana. He was one of 13 children; he had six brothers and six sisters. As a five-year-old boy, he worked on a farm picking cotton. He also worked as a delivery boy and cared for chickens. He acquired his nickname as a youth, because, with his braided hair, he looked like the character Buckwheat from &quot;Our Gang/The Little Rascals&quot; movies. His father, a farmer, was an accomplished amateur traditional Creole accordion player, but young Dural preferred listening to and playing rhythm and blues.

==Career==
Dural became proficient at the organ, and by the late 1950s he was backing Joe Tex, Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown and many others. As a teenager, he played piano for Little Richard, Fats Domino, and Ray Charles. Two Lafayette-based bands that he played in during his teens and twenties were Sammy and the Untouchables and Lil&#x27; Buck and the Top Cats. 

In 1971, he founded Buckwheat &amp; the Hitchhikers, a funk band that he led for five years before switching to zydeco. They were a local sensation and found success with the single, &quot;It&#x27;s Hard To Get&quot;, recorded for a local Louisiana-based label.

He began backing Clifton Chenier, one of the most legendary zydeco performers. Though not a traditional zydeco fan when growing up, Buckwheat accepted an invitation in 1976 to join Clifton Chenier&#x27;s Red Hot Louisiana Band as organist. He quickly discovered the popularity of zydeco music, and noted the effect the music had on the audience. &quot;Everywhere, people young and old just loved zydeco music,&quot; Dural says. &quot;I had so much fun playing that first night with Clifton. We played for four hours and I wasn&#x27;t ready to quit.&quot;

Dural&#x27;s relationship with Chenier led him to take up the accordion in 1978. After practicing for a year, he felt ready to start his own band under the name Buckwheat Zydeco. They debuted with &quot;One for the Road&quot; in 1979 on the Blues Unlimited label and then recorded for New Orleans&#x27; Black Top label. In 1983, they were nominated for a Grammy Award for &quot;Turning Point&quot; and in 1985 for &quot;Waitin&#x27; For My Ya Ya&quot; after switching to the Rounder Records label. Scott Billington of Rounder wrote that Buckwheat &quot;played the large piano accordion, like Clifton, but delivered his music with the flair of a rhythm and blues star like Joe Tex, and with the precision of James Brown. He performed Creole dance music, but it was also Southern soul music and Louisiana funk, with a Caribbean edge, all in one package.&quot;

The band then signed to Island Records, becoming the first zydeco act on a major label, and released &quot;On a Night Like This&quot;, a critically acclaimed album that was nominated for a Grammy as well. 

In 1988, Eric Clapton invited the band to open his North American tour as well as his 12-night stand at London’s Royal Albert Hall. Buckwheat subsequently shared stages and/or recording with Keith Richards, Robert Plant, Willie Nelson, Mavis Staples, David Hidalgo, Dwight Yoakam, Paul Simon, Ry Cooder, the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies and many others, including indie music band Yo La Tengo on the soundtrack of the Bob Dylan bio-pic, &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;. His music has been featured in films including &quot;The Waterboy&quot;, &quot;The Big Easy&quot;, &quot;Fletch Lives&quot; and &quot;Hard Target&quot;. BET&#x27;s show &quot;Comic View&quot; used his live version of “What You Gonna Do?” as theme music for the program&#x27;s 10th anniversary &quot;Pardi Gras&quot; season. He also wrote and performed the theme music for the PBS television series &quot;Pierre Franey&#x27;s Cooking In America&quot;. Buckwheat won an Emmy for his music in the CBS TV movie, &quot;Pistol Pete: The Life and Times of Pete Maravich&quot;.

Buckwheat Zydeco played many major music festivals, including the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival (numerous times), Chicago Blues Festival, Newport Folk Festival, Summerfest, San Diego Street Scene, Bumbershoot, Montreux Jazz Festival, the Voodoo Experience, and countless others.

During the 1990s and early 2000s Buckwheat recorded for his own Tomorrow Recordings label and maintained an extensive touring schedule. Buckwheat Zydeco&#x27;s last album, &quot;Lay Your Burden Down&quot;, was released on May 5, 2009 on the Alligator Records label. It was produced by Steve Berlin of Los Lobos and included guest appearances by guitarists Warren Haynes and Sonny Landreth, Trombone Shorty, JJ Grey and Berlin himself. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award. &quot;Sonicboomers.com&quot; says, &quot;The CD is a vastly entertaining and appealingly diverse package. Bandleader Dural remains an ever-engaging vocalist and a whiz on any keyboard he touches. So, for Buckwheat Zydeco fans, &quot;Lay Your Burden Down&quot; finds the maestro and his group near the top of their form. For listeners with less interest in the ol&#x27; accordion get-down, the collection supplies enough interesting wrinkles to get the good times rolling.&quot;

Buckwheat Zydeco&#x27;s version of the classic &quot;Cryin&#x27; in the Streets&quot; appears on the benefit album for Hurricane Katrina recovery, &quot;Our New Orleans: A Benefit Album for the Gulf Coast&quot;. His version of Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy&#x27;s &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; appeared on 2011&#x27;s Alligator Records 40th Anniversary Collection. It originally appeared on the 2009 Buckwheat Zydeco album &quot;Lay Your Burden Down&quot;.

==Death==
Dural died of lung cancer at age 68 on September 24, 2016, at Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center. He was funeralized at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Lafayette.

<doc id="174844" wikidata="Q104692" url="?curid=174844" title="Actinolite">
<text>Actinolite is an amphibole silicate mineral with the chemical formula .

==Etymology==
The name &quot;actinolite&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;aktis&quot; (), meaning &quot;beam&quot; or &quot;ray&quot;, because of the mineral&#x27;s fibrous nature.

==Mineralogy==
Actinolite is an intermediate member in a solid-solution series between magnesium-rich tremolite, , and iron-rich ferro-actinolite, . Mg and Fe ions can be freely exchanged in the crystal structure. Like tremolite, asbestiform actinolite is regulated as asbestos.

==Occurrence==
Actinolite is commonly found in metamorphic rocks, such as contact aureoles surrounding cooled intrusive igneous rocks. It also occurs as a product of metamorphism of magnesium-rich limestones.

The old mineral name &quot;uralite&quot; is at times applied to an alteration product of primary pyroxene by a mixture composed largely of actinolite. The metamorphosed gabbro or diabase rock bodies, referred to as epidiorite, contain a considerable amount of this &quot;uralitic&quot; alteration.

Fibrous actinolite is one of the six recognised types of asbestos, the fibres being so small that they can enter the lungs and damage the alveoli. Actinolite asbestos was once mined along Jones Creek at Gundagai, Australia.

==Gemology==
Some forms of actinolite are used as gemstones. One is nephrite, one of the two types of jade (the other being jadeite, a variety of pyroxene).

Another gem variety is the chatoyant form known as &quot;cat&#x27;s-eye actinolite&quot;. This stone is translucent to opaque, and green to yellowish green color. This variety has had the misnomer &quot;jade cat&#x27;s-eye&quot;. Transparent actinolite is rare and is faceted for gem collectors. Major sources for these forms of actinolite are Taiwan and Canada. Other sources are Madagascar, Tanzania, and the United States.

<text>Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial, or, a Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns lately found in Norfolk is a work by Sir Thomas Browne, published in 1658 as the first part of a two-part work that concludes with &quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot;.

The title is Greek for &quot;urn burial&quot;: A hydria (ὑδρία) is a large Greek pot, and &quot;taphos&quot; (τάφος) means &quot;tomb&quot;.

Its nominal subject was the discovery of some 40 to 50 Anglo-Saxon pots in Norfolk. The discovery of these remains prompts Browne to deliver, first, a description of the antiquities found, and then a survey of most of the burial and funerary customs, ancient and current, of which his era was aware.

The most famous part of the work is the apotheosis of the fifth chapter, where Browne declaims:
George Saintsbury, in the &quot;Cambridge History of English Literature&quot; (1911), calls the totality of Chapter V &quot;the longest piece, perhaps, of absolutely sublime rhetoric to be found in the prose literature of the world.&quot;

==Influence==
&quot;Urn Burial&quot; has been admired by Charles Lamb, Samuel Johnson, John Cowper Powys, James Joyce, and Herman Melville, while Ralph Waldo Emerson said that it &quot;smells in every word of the sepulchre&quot;.

Browne&#x27;s text is discussed in W. G. Sebald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot;.

The English composer William Alwyn wrote his Symphony No. 5, subtitled &quot;Hydriotaphia&quot;, in homage to Browne&#x27;s imagery and rhythmic prose.

The American composer Douglas J. Cuomo&#x27;s &quot;The Fate of His Ashes: Requiem for Victims of Power&quot; for chorus and organ takes its text from &quot;Urn Burial.&quot;

Eric Ambler excerpts a passage from chapter 5 (&quot;But the iniquity of oblivion blindely scattereth her poppy...&quot;) as the epigram for the novel &quot;The Mask of Dimitrios&quot;.

Derek Walcott uses an excerpt as the epigraph to his poem &quot;Ruins of a Great House&quot;, while Edgar Allan Poe quotes the &quot;Urn Burial&quot; in the epigraph of &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;.

Kevin Powers uses an excerpt from the fifth chapter (&quot;To be ignorant of evils to come, and forgetfull of evils past...&quot;) as one of the epigraphs for his novel &quot;The Yellow Birds&quot;.

Alain de Botton references the work in his book &quot;Status Anxiety&quot;.

Borges refers to it in the final line of his short story &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;.

It also appears in the novel &quot;Sanshirō&quot;, written by Natsume Sōseki; Hirota-sensei lent the book to Sanshirō.

The British mystery writer Reginald Hill uses quotes from &quot;Urn Burial&quot; as chapter headings for his novel &quot;Urn Burial&quot; (1975), also known as &quot;Beyond the Bone&quot; written under the name Patrick Ruell.

American nonfiction writer Colin Dickey compares some of Browne&#x27;s writing on death in Urn Burial to the fate of Browne&#x27;s skull in his book &quot;Cranioklepty: Grave Robbing and the Search for Genius&quot;.

<text>Cocteau Twins were a Scottish rock band active from 1979 to 1997. They were formed in Grangemouth on the Firth of Forth by Robin Guthrie (guitars, drum machine) and Will Heggie (bass), adding Elizabeth Fraser (vocals) in 1981. In 1983, Heggie was replaced with multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde. The group earned critical praise for their ethereal, effects-laden sound and the soprano vocals of Fraser, whose lyrics often eschew any recognisable language. They pioneered the 1980s alternative subgenre of dream pop and helped define what would become shoegaze.

In 1982, the band signed with the record label 4AD and released their debut album &quot;Garlands&quot;. The addition of Raymonde in 1983 solidified their best-known lineup, which soon produced the No. 29 UK hit &quot;Pearly-Dewdrops&#x27; Drops&quot;, their highest-charting UK single. The trio crystallised their &quot;swelling, euphoric&quot; dream pop style on the 1984 album &quot;Treasure&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s first UK Top 40 album. In 1988, Cocteau Twins signed with Capitol Records in the United States, distributing their fifth album &quot;Blue Bell Knoll&quot; through a major label in the country. After the 1990 release of their most commercially successful album, &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot;, the band left 4AD for Fontana Records, where they released their final two albums. &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; has since been included on several &quot;best album&quot; lists, including &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 Albums.

After nearly 20 years together, the group disbanded in 1997 in part due to issues stemming from the disintegration of Fraser and Guthrie&#x27;s romantic relationship. In 2005 the band announced that they would reunite to headline Coachella Festival and embark on a world tour but the reunion was cancelled a month later after Fraser &quot;couldn’t bring herself to work with Guthrie&quot;. In a 2021 interview, Raymonde claimed that Cocteau Twins &quot;will never reform&quot;.

==History==
===1979–1983: Early years===
Guthrie and Heggie, both from Grangemouth, Scotland, formed the band in 1979. They met the 17-year-old Fraser in 1981 at a local disco, The Hotel International, where Guthrie was DJing, and she became the group&#x27;s vocalist.

Prior to releasing their debut album, the band recorded a four track session for John Peel in June 1982, including &quot;Wax and Wane&quot; and &quot;Garlands&quot;. Their debut LP &quot;Garlands&quot;, released through 4AD in July 1982, was a sales success, peaking at number 14 in the indie albums chart in the UK. &quot;Sounds&quot; wrote that the style of the band was &quot;mixing strong Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division influences&quot;. &quot;NME&quot;″s Don Watson compared it to gothic rock bands such as Gene Loves Jezebel and Xmal Deutschland, while &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sue Cummings compared it in 1986 to Siouxsie and the Banshees and Bauhaus. It was followed by the EP &quot;Lullabies&quot; in October. In April 1983 the band released a second EP, &quot;Peppermint Pig&quot;.

A European tour supporting Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark followed, but after a gig in Hamburg the band left the tour and parted ways with bassist Will Heggie, leaving Guthrie and Fraser unsure how they would continue. The pair returned to Scotland, settling to re-think their whole approach and write new songs for an album. 

Cocteau Twins&#x27; sound on their first three recordings relied on the combination of Heggie&#x27;s rhythmic basslines, Guthrie&#x27;s minimalist guitar melodies, and Fraser&#x27;s voice. The band&#x27;s next full-length LP record, &quot;Head over Heels&quot;, relied solely on the latter two, following Heggie&#x27;s departure (he would later join Lowlife). This led to the characteristic Cocteau Twins sound: Fraser&#x27;s voice, by turns ethereal and operatic, combined with increasingly effects-heavy guitar playing by Guthrie (who has often said that he is far more interested in the way the guitar is recorded than in the actual notes being played; he later said that his reliance on effects and layering was initially due to his own technical limitations). Guthrie has cited Phil Spector&#x27;s wall of sound as &quot;an obvious influence&quot; on his sound.

In 1983 the band participated in 4AD&#x27;s This Mortal Coil project, which spawned a cover version of Tim Buckley&#x27;s &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; (performed by Guthrie and Fraser). Despite appearing under the &quot;This Mortal Coil&quot; name, the cover has subsequently become one of the best-known Cocteau Twins tracks. While working on &quot;This Mortal Coil&quot;, Guthrie and Fraser became acquainted with another project contributor, multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde (formerly a member of Drowning Craze), who joined Cocteau Twins later that year.

===1984–1989: Rise to fame===
With Raymonde, the band released a series of albums and EPs that explored their new style. These included &quot;The Spangle Maker&quot; (1984), &quot;Treasure&quot; (1984), &quot;Aikea-Guinea&quot; (1985), &quot;Tiny Dynamine&quot; (1985), &quot;Echoes in a Shallow Bay&quot; (1985), and &quot;Love&#x27;s Easy Tears&quot; (1986). From &quot;The Spangle Maker&quot;, &quot;Pearly Dewdrops Drops&quot; was a hit single, reaching no. 29 on the UK Singles Chart in April 1984 and No. 1 on the UK Indie Chart. Raymonde, who was called in to work on the second album by This Mortal Coil, did not participate in the recording of the fourth Cocteau Twins LP, &quot;Victorialand&quot; (1986), a predominantly acoustic record which featured only Guthrie and Fraser. Raymonde returned to the group for &quot;The Moon and the Melodies&quot; (1986), a collaboration with ambient composer Harold Budd, which was not released under the Cocteau Twins name, instead being credited to all four participating musicians alphabetically.

In 1985 4AD signed an agreement with Relativity Records for distribution of Cocteau Twins releases in the US and other territories. To commemorate the event, the compilation &quot;The Pink Opaque&quot; (1985) was released as a way of introducing the new, broader audience to the band&#x27;s back catalogue.

While remaining a 4AD band, Cocteau Twins signed a major-label contract with Capitol Records in 1988 for distribution in the United States, and released their fifth album, &quot;Blue Bell Knoll&quot;, that September. The US promotional only single &quot;Carolyn&#x27;s Fingers&quot; was heavily played on the U.S. radio stations, peaking at No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Alternative Songs chart.

===1990–1994: Mainstream success===
The group released &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; in early 1990. The most commercially successful of their many recordings, the album reached number seven in the UK Albums Chart immediately after its release. Despite the success of the record and the subsequent concert tours, not everything was well with the band. They parted ways with 4AD following &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; partly because of conflicts with the label&#x27;s founder Ivo Watts-Russell, and were close to breaking up over internal problems due in large part to Guthrie&#x27;s substance abuse. &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; has been described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;the band’s most accessible and immediate – one could almost say radio-friendly – album to date&quot;. Their reasons ranged from Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;cut back layers of guitar and reverb&quot;, &quot;Fraser’s singing being more comprehensible&quot;, and &quot;both Raymonde’s bass work and the ever-present drum machine&quot;. Album tracks &quot;Cherry Coloured Funk&quot; and &quot;Iceblink Luck&quot; were acknowledged as becoming immediate favourites amongst fans of the band following the albums release.

The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and was voted number 218 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it at No. 245 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album was voted 18th of &quot;Scotland’s 100 Best Rock and Pop Albums&quot; in 2003 and was the focus of a BBC Scotland programme, &quot;Classic Scottish Albums&quot; in 2007.

While on their international tour supporting &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot;, the group signed a new recording contract with Mercury Records subsidiary Fontana for the UK and elsewhere, while retaining their US relationship with Capitol. They added several live musicians to their touring band during this era, to better replicate the layered sound of their studio albums. In 1991 4AD and Capitol released a box set that compiled the band&#x27;s EPs from 1982 to 1990, and also included a bonus disc of rare and previously unreleased material.

Fraser and Guthrie had a daughter, Lucy Belle, born in 1989. The couple ended their 13-year relationship in 1993. The band&#x27;s seventh LP, &quot;Four-Calendar Café&quot;, their first since Fraser and Guthrie&#x27;s separation, was released in late 1993. The band explained that &quot;Four-Calendar Café&quot; was a response to the turmoil that had engulfed them in the intervening years, with Guthrie entering rehab and quitting alcohol and drugs, and Fraser undergoing psychotherapy. The band made their debut appearance on television in the United States for a performance of &quot;Bluebeard&quot; on the &quot;Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; in 1993.

===1995–1997: &quot;Milk &amp; Kisses&quot; and break-up===
In 1995, the band released two new extended plays (EP) – &quot;Twinlights&quot; and &quot;Otherness&quot;. Some of the tracks on &quot;Twinlights&quot; and &quot;Otherness&quot; were versions of songs from the band&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Milk &amp; Kisses&quot; (1996). The record saw the return of more heavily layered guitars, and Fraser began once again to obscure her lyrics, though not entirely. Two singles were taken from the album: &quot;Tishbite&quot; and &quot;Violaine&quot;; both exist in two CD versions, with different B-sides included on each. Raymonde said on the recording of the album that it &quot;all happened so fast&quot;, further claiming that &quot;Robin and I would write a song and then not have to wait around forever the muse to visit Liz&quot;. Guthrie described making the album as &quot;a very joyous experience&quot;, stating that &quot;Simon [Raymonde] used to come into the studio in the daytime to do his thing, then I would come in at night to do mine, and then Liz would come in when neither one of us was around&quot;. Fraser explained that when talking to a friend, they expressed their desire to &quot;take the poison out and replace it with milk and kisses&quot;, which Fraser later described as &quot;really brilliant&quot;, and that she &quot;kept hearing it and feeling so good about it&quot; with it &quot;seeming right to use it&quot;.

The band, augmented by an extra guitarist and a drummer, toured extensively to support the album, their last for Mercury/Fontana. A new song, &quot;Touch Upon Touch&quot;, which debuted during the live shows and was recorded later in 1996 was also one of the two songs written and arranged by Fraser, Guthrie and Raymonde for Chinese pop singer Faye Wong for her Mandarin album &quot;Fuzao&quot; released in June 1996, the other being &quot;Tranquil Eye&quot; from &quot;Violaine&quot; released in October 1996.

In 1997 while recording what was to have been their ninth LP, the trio disbanded over irreconcilable differences in part related to the breakup of Guthrie and Fraser. Some songs were partially recorded and possibly completed, but the band has stated that they will likely never be finished or released in any form.

===1998–present: Post-breakup===
In 1999 Bella Union, the record label founded by Guthrie and Raymonde, released a double-CD Cocteau Twins compilation entitled &quot;BBC Sessions&quot;. The collection is a complete record of the band&#x27;s appearances on UK radio programs from 1982 to 1996, with rare and unreleased material included. In 2000 4AD released &quot;Stars and Topsoil&quot;, a compilation chosen by the band members that had been released during their years with 4AD; all recordings had been digitally remastered by Guthrie. In 2003 4AD released digitally remastered versions of the first six Cocteau Twins LPs.

In January 2005 Cocteau Twins announced that they would be reforming to perform at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on 30 April, and later indicated that additional tour dates would be added. On 16 March, the reunion was cancelled after Fraser announced that she would not take part. In a 2009 interview Fraser said she could not go through the pain of sharing the stage with her former lover Guthrie, the issue behind the band&#x27;s 1997 breakup. Raymonde revealed that the band had also booked a 55-date world tour, which would have paid him £1.5 million. 

In 2005 4AD released a limited edition of 10,000 compilation box set titled &quot;Lullabies to Violaine&quot;, a 4-disc set that includes every single and EP released from 1982 to 1996. This was shortly followed up by two 2-disc sets of the same names, known as Volume 1 and Volume 2. In 2012, “Cherry-Coloured Funk,” “Pitch the Baby,” and “Frou-Frou Foxes in Midsummer Fires&quot; which featured on &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; (1990), were performed live by lead singer Elizabeth Fraser during her Meltdown Festival solo performances. Each of the three songs featured new musical arrangements during Fraser&#x27;s performances at the festival.

Since March 2007 the band has started podcasts of exclusive material. On 6 October 2008 Cocteau Twins were awarded the Q Awards Inspiration Award, which they accepted in a rare collective live appearance.

In 2022 Fraser, Guthrie and Raymonde were awarded with the Visionary Award by The Ivors Academy. Fraser and Guthrie attended the award ceremony in London in May 2022. In 2023, Guthrie remastered the albums &quot;Four-Calendar Café&quot; and &quot;Milk &amp; Kisses&quot;, which was later re-released under an exclusive license by their former record label, 4AD, in 2024 on vinyl, compact disc, and digital formats.

==Solo work==
The former members of Cocteau Twins have remained active musically in the years since the band&#x27;s demise. In addition to forming Bella Union, Guthrie and Raymonde have produced releases from new bands signed to that label.

Raymonde released the solo album &quot;Blame Someone Else&quot; as the first release on Bella Union. He also co-produced the posthumous album by Billy Mackenzie from the Associates, then went on to produce several Domino Records artists like James Yorkston, Archie Bronson Outfit (whom he later managed) and Clearlake. More recently he has produced the UK band the Duke Spirit, London-based duo Helene, former Golden Virgins frontman Lucas Renney and has mixed the Mercury Prize nominated album &quot;The End of History&quot; by Fionn Regan. In his role running Bella Union, he has discovered such artists as Laura Veirs, Fleet Foxes, Midlake, Lift to Experience, the Low Anthem, I Break Horses, the Czars and John Grant. Raymonde picked up the Independent Record Company of the Year award at the Music Week Awards (as voted by UK independent retailers) in 2010, 2012 and 2014.

Guthrie has released six solo albums – &quot;Imperial&quot;, &quot;Continental&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;Emeralds&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, and &quot;Pearldiving&quot;– and eight EPs. He toured extensively with his band Violet Indiana, which included ex-Cocteau Twins guitarist Mitsuo Tate. He has also scored the music for three movies — Gregg Araki&#x27;s &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot; (in collaboration with Harold Budd), Dany Saadia&#x27;s &quot;3:19 Nada Es Casualidad&quot; (a Mexican/Spanish production), and again with Gregg Araki and Harold Budd on the score and the soundtrack of &quot;White Bird in a Blizzard&quot;. He reunited with Budd to collaborate on two companion albums, &quot;Before the Day Breaks&quot; and &quot;After the Night Falls&quot;, and the albums &quot;Bordeaux&quot;, &quot;Winter Garden&quot; (a collaboration that included Italian electronica artist Eraldo Bernocchi), and &quot;Another Flower&quot;, which was released after Budd&#x27;s death in 2020. In 2006 Guthrie produced three songs on Mahogany&#x27;s &quot;Connectivity&quot;. He also produced and played guitar on Apollo Heights debut album, &quot;White Music for Black People&quot;.

Fraser provided guest vocals on the Future Sound of London&#x27;s single &quot;Lifeforms&quot; (1993), vocals for three songs on Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;Mezzanine&quot; in 1998 (as well as touring with them several times), and for other musical projects and groups. She wrote the lyrics and sang the vocals for &quot;Teardrop&quot; by Massive Attack which was released as a single in 1998 and reached number 10 in the UK singles chart. Fraser provided the vocals for &quot;Lament for Gandalf&quot; on &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; soundtrack. In 2000 she sang with Peter Gabriel on &quot;Ovo (The Millennium Show)&quot;. In 2005 she worked with Breton musician Yann Tiersen on two songs for his album &quot;Les retrouvailles&quot;. In 2009 she released the single &quot;Moses&quot; on Rough Trade.

==Musical style, influences, and legacy==

Cocteau Twins&#x27; early recordings were classified in the gothic rock and post-punk genres. The band&#x27;s influences at the time they formed included The Birthday Party (drummer Phill Calvert encouraged the group to sign to 4AD), Sex Pistols, Kate Bush and Siouxsie and the Banshees (Fraser had Siouxsie tattoos on her arms for several years). The band was named after the early Simple Minds song &quot;The Cocteau Twins&quot; (later rewritten as &quot;No Cure&quot;). As the band&#x27;s sound developed, their subsequent music was classified as dream pop, and darkwave. Fraser&#x27;s vocals included invented or unknown words, sometimes ones she found in foreign language books, adding to the band&#x27;s dreamy ambience.

Cocteau Twins&#x27; music has influenced numerous artists in different genres, including Slowdive, Ride, Cigarettes After Sex, Quicksand, Deftones, the Weeknd, Napalm Death, John Grant, and Prince.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; described their music as &quot;the gold standard for enigmatic, ethereal indie-pop&quot;, citing their ability to &quot;emerge fully formed from the post-punk shadows&quot;.

<text>Tikal National Park is a national park located in Guatemala, in the northern region of the Petén Department. Stretching across 57,600 hectares (220 sq mi), it contains the ancient Mayan city of Tikal and the surrounding tropical forests, savannas, and wetlands. In 1979, Tikal National Park was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, because of the outstanding Mesoamerican ruins at Tikal and the unique ecology of the surrounding landscape.

==History==
&quot;Project Tikal&quot;, as it was named at the time, was first proposed by the University of Pennsylvania in 1949. Founded on May 26, 1955, Tikal National Park was established under government decree by the Ministry of Education, via the Instituto de Antropología e Historia, advised by Dr. Adolfo Molina Orantes and under the government of Carlos Castillo Armas. Once established, the University of Pennsylvania played a role in the park&#x27;s cleaning, maintenance, excavation and restoration of the site from 1956 to 1969.

Today, Tikal National Park&#x27;s main tourist attraction is the classical, Mayan city Tikal, which is surrounded by a dense, lush forest.

==Ecology==
Tikal National Park makes up part of the global Man and the Biosphere Programme, within the Maya Biosphere Reserve. Because of its lush and varied ecosystem, many species of plants and animals thrive within the park boundaries. Five species of cats reside within the park, including the jaguar and puma, along with several species of monkeys and anteaters. In addition, more than 300 species of birds are found in the park, including the crane hawk and the ocellated turkey.

<text>Andalusite is an aluminium nesosilicate mineral with the chemical formula Al2SiO5. This mineral was called andalousite by Delamétherie, who thought it came from Andalusia, Spain. It soon became clear that it was a locality error, and that the specimens studied were actually from El Cardoso de la Sierra, in the Spanish province of Guadalajara, not Andalusia.

Andalusite is trimorphic with kyanite and sillimanite, being the lower pressure mid temperature polymorph. At higher temperatures and pressures, andalusite may convert to sillimanite. Thus, as with its other polymorphs, andalusite is an aluminosilicate index mineral, providing clues to depth and pressures involved in producing the host rock.

==Varieties==
The variety chiastolite commonly contains dark inclusions of carbon or clay which form a cruciform pattern when shown in cross-section. This stone was known at least from the sixteenth century, being taken to many European countries, as a souvenir, by pilgrims returning from Santiago de Compostela.

Viridine is a green variety of andalusite in which manganese 3+ substitutes for aluminium, the same change is also responsible for the colour. Kanonaite is a greenish-black mineral related to andalusite and having the approximate composition .

A clear variety found in Brazil and Sri-Lanka can be cut into a gemstone. Faceted andalusite stones give a play of red, green, and yellow colors that resembles a muted form of iridescence, although the colors are actually the result of unusually strong pleochroism.

== Occurrence ==
Andalusite is a common metamorphic mineral which forms under low pressure and low to high temperatures. The minerals kyanite and sillimanite are polymorphs of andalusite, each occurring under different temperature-pressure regimes and are therefore rarely found together in the same rock. Because of this the three minerals are a useful tool to help identify the pressure-temperature paths of the host rock in which they are found. It is particularly associated with pelitic metamorphic rocks such as mica schist.

The world&#x27;s highest concentration of andalusite is found in the Glomel mine in Côtes-d&#x27;Armor (France) which accounts for 25% of the global production of this mineral. South Africa possesses the largest portion of the world&#x27;s known andalusite deposits.

== Uses ==
Andalusite is used as a refractory in furnaces, kilns and other industrial processes.

<text>A waterway is any navigable body of water. Broad distinctions are useful to avoid ambiguity, and disambiguation will be of varying importance depending on the nuance of the equivalent word in other ways. A first distinction is necessary between maritime shipping routes and waterways used by inland water craft. Maritime shipping routes cross oceans and seas, and some lakes, where navigability is assumed, and no engineering is required, except to provide the draft for deep-sea shipping to approach seaports (channels), or to provide a short cut across an isthmus; this is the function of ship canals. Dredged channels in the sea are not usually described as waterways. There is an exception to this initial distinction, essentially for legal purposes, see under international waters.

Where seaports are located inland, they are approached through a waterway that could be termed &quot;inland&quot; but in practice is generally referred to as a &quot;maritime waterway&quot; (examples Seine Maritime, Loire Maritime, Seeschiffahrtsstraße Elbe). The term &quot;inland waterway&quot; refers to navigable rivers and canals designed to be used by inland waterway craft only, implicitly of much smaller dimensions than seagoing ships.

In order for a waterway to be navigable, it must meet several criteria:

* it must be deep enough to accommodate vessels loading to the design draft;
* it must be wide enough to allow passage of the vessels with the design width or beam;
* it must be free of obstacles to navigation such as waterfalls and rapids, or offer a way around them (such as canal locks or boat lifts);
* its current must be mild enough to allow vessels to make headway upstream without undue difficulty;
* the wave height (on lakes) must not exceed the value for which the class of vessel is designed.

Vessels using waterways vary from small animal-drawn barges to immense ocean tankers and ocean liners, such as cruise ships.

In order to increase the importance of inland waterway transport, the European Commission presented a 35-point action plan in June 2021. The main goals are to increase the amount of goods moved through Europe&#x27;s rivers and canals and to speed up the switch to zero-emission barges by 2050. This is in accordance with the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and the European Green Deal, which set the target of boosting inland canal and short-sea shipping by 25% by 2030 and by 50% by 2050.

==History==
Waterways have been an important part of human activity since prehistoric times and navigability has allowed watercraft and canals to pass through every body of water. The Grand Canal (China), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the oldest known waterway system in the world, is considered to be one of the world&#x27;s largest and most extensive project of engineering.

==Example of classification of inland waterways==

The European Conference of Ministers of Transport established in 1953 a classification of waterways that was later expanded to take into account the development of push-towing. Europe is a continent with a great variety of waterway characteristics, which makes this classification valuable to appreciate the different classes in waterway. There is also a remarkable variety of waterway characteristics in many countries of Asia, but there has not been any equivalent international drive for uniformity. This classification is provided by the UN Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport. A low resolution version of that map is shown here.

<doc id="174853" wikidata="Q467673" url="?curid=174853" title="W.A.S.P. (band)">
<text>W.A.S.P. is an American heavy metal band formed in 1982. They emerged from the early 1980s Los Angeles heavy metal scene. The band&#x27;s popularity peaked that decade, yet they continue to record and tour. W.A.S.P. gained notoriety for their shock rock-themed image, lyrics and live performances. They have sold over twelve million records worldwide, with their first two albums, &quot;W.A.S.P.&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Last Command&quot; (1985), being certified as gold by the RIAA.

W.A.S.P. was a target in the mid-1980s of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), an organization that pushed for warning labels on recorded music. The band immortalized its fight with the PMRC on the song &quot;Harder, Faster&quot; from their 1987 live album, &quot;Live... in the Raw&quot;. Their most well-known songs include &quot;Animal (F**k Like a Beast)&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be Somebody&quot;, &quot;L.O.V.E. Machine&quot;, &quot;Wild Child&quot;, &quot;Blind in Texas&quot;, &quot;Forever Free&quot;, &quot;The Headless Children&quot;, &quot;Chainsaw Charlie (Murders in the New Morgue)&quot; and &quot;The Idol&quot;, as well as their cover versions of Ray Charles&#x27; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need No Doctor&quot; and The Who&#x27;s &quot;The Real Me&quot;. The band&#x27;s most recent studio album, &quot;Golgotha&quot;, was released in 2015 and they are currently working on new material.

==History==
===Early years and rise to fame (1982–1985)===

W.A.S.P. began following the demise of Circus Circus, a Los Angeles-based band featuring Blackie Lawless and Randy Piper. The original lineup of W.A.S.P. was formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1982 by Lawless, Piper, Rik Fox, and Tony Richards. The band became notorious for its raunchy and, at times, shocking live shows. Lawless was known to tie semi-naked models to a torture rack, and to also hurl raw meat into the audience. The band&#x27;s debut single, entitled &quot;Animal (F**k Like a Beast)&quot;, and its cover were equally controversial.

The first lineup did not last for long, as Fox was let go and went on to join the band Steeler with vocalist Ron Keel and a then-unknown guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen. He was replaced by Don Costa, the bassist in Richards&#x27; former band, Dante Fox (which later evolved into Great White). Shortly afterward, Costa also left the band and his position on the bass was filled by Brayden Parker. At the same time, guitarist Chris Holmes joined the band.

W.A.S.P. signed to Capitol Records for their debut album, &quot;W.A.S.P.&quot;, released on August 17, 1984. The debut was at one time planned for release with the title &quot;Winged Assassins&quot;. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Animal (F**k Like a Beast)&quot;, was omitted from the album in the United States to prevent it from being banned from major chain stores. &quot;W.A.S.P.&quot; was accompanied by the band&#x27;s first world tour, performing with numerous bands such as Kiss, Iron Maiden, Dokken, Krokus, Helix, Quiet Riot, Armored Saint, and a then-relatively unknown Metallica.

Shortly afterwards, the band made an appearance in the 1984 film &quot;The Dungeonmaster&quot; and on the soundtrack to &quot;Ghost Warrior&quot; with the song &quot;Tormentor&quot;.

&quot;L.O.V.E. Machine&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Somebody&quot; helped the album sell, and set the band up for &quot;Blind in Texas&quot;, a song written in St. Paul, Minnesota, by Lawless. The song was included on their next album &quot;The Last Command&quot;, which was released in September 1985. &quot;The Last Command&quot; remains W.A.S.P.&#x27;s highest-charting album, peaking at No. 47 on the Billboard album chart. &quot;Blind in Texas&quot; is perhaps their best known song, more than three decades after its release. &quot;The Last Command&quot; was also the first album with new drummer Steve Riley (formerly of Keel), who had replaced Richards at the beginning of the 1984-1985 tour. W.A.S.P. supported the album by participating in two arena tours, opening for Kiss on their &quot;Asylum&quot; tour, and, along with a then-unknown Anthrax, they supported Black Sabbath on their &quot;Seventh Star&quot; tour.

After &quot;The Last Command&quot; tour, Piper departed the band. Former King Kobra bassist Johnny Rod joined W.A.S.P. as Lawless went back to playing rhythm guitar. Around this time, W.A.S.P. became a very prominent target of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), an organization led by Tipper Gore and dedicated to opposing music with lyrics deemed violent or overtly sexual in content. This lowered the band&#x27;s reputation to such a degree that concert halls were getting bomb threats, band members were receiving death threats by the hundreds, and Lawless was shot at twice (though not hit). The controversy generated valuable publicity for the band.

===Mainstream success (1986–1989)===
With the lineup changes made, they recorded their third album, titled &quot;Inside the Electric Circus&quot;. It was released in October 1986, and a near year-long world tour in support of the album followed, including supporting Iron Maiden on their &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; tour in Europe, and a headlining North American tour with Slayer, Raven and Saxon. &quot;Inside the Electric Circus&quot; received a mixed reaction from the music press: it was considered a big hit with W.A.S.P. fans, while critics, on the other hand, dismissed it as &quot;7th-grader rock&quot;. Songs like &quot;Shoot From The Hip&quot; and the minor hit single &quot;95-N.A.S.T.Y.&quot; helped the band live up to the reputation of one of the possible meanings of their band name, &quot;We Are Sexual Perverts&quot;. However, Blackie Lawless himself, known to be a harsh critic of his own work, cited in the album&#x27;s re-release liner notes that &quot;Inside the Electric Circus&quot; was &quot;[a] tired record by a tired band.&quot; Ultimately it was an unfavorable critical review of the single &quot;95-N.A.S.T.Y.&quot; that convinced Lawless to take some time off and reconsider the band&#x27;s creative direction.

In 1987, W.A.S.P. had their song &quot;Scream Until You Like It&quot; included on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Ghoulies 2&quot;. The same year, a few dates during the &quot;Inside the Electric Circus&quot; tour were recorded and on November 27, 1987, the Long Beach arena concert was released as the &quot;Live... in the Raw&quot; album. By this time, Riley had left W.A.S.P. to join L.A. Guns, and was replaced by local drummer Chad Nelson. Then-eighteen-year-old Glenn Soderling, who had recorded an album in 1983 with the band Pandemonium, then joined the band, but did not play any shows due to Holmes&#x27; illness. Soderling left during rehearsals and was replaced by Kelly Martella for their Donington appearance and a &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performance of &quot;Scream Until You Like It&quot; on the BBC. Martella went on to join the band Silent Rage (Simmons Records) in 1988. Soderling later surfaced under the name &quot;Tripp Holland&quot; in the band Engines of Aggression with former Tomorrow&#x27;s Child members Rik Schaffer and Craig Dollinger, and is currently making music for TV shows as staff writer with Supersonic Noise.

W.A.S.P.&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;The Headless Children&quot;, was released in April 1989, and was their first album without any overtly sexually explicit songs. The album reached the band&#x27;s highest chart position with No. 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 before falling off the charts in 13 weeks. However, it was W.A.S.P.&#x27;s most critically acclaimed work up to that point and, according to a recent Lawless interview, it is now the highest-selling W.A.S.P. album to date. The drumming duties for the album were handled by former Quiet Riot drummer Frankie Banali. It features two of the band&#x27;s most highly acclaimed songs, the power ballad &quot;Forever Free&quot; and a cover of The Who&#x27;s &quot;The Real Me&quot;. W.A.S.P. went on tour in the United States with Accept and Metal Church to support &quot;The Headless Children&quot;, playing at smaller venues such as clubs and theaters, as opposed to the arenas and stadiums that had propelled the band into success.

===Post-Chris Holmes period (1989–1995)===

Chris Holmes left the band in August 1989, stating that he wanted to &quot;have fun, you know.&quot; Lawless responded with a caustic remark about the fact that &quot;some guys want to stay at home and wear aprons,&quot; hinting at the nature of Chris Holmes&#x27; relationship with his new wife Lita Ford. The band effectively disbanded a few months later, with Blackie Lawless embarking on a short lived solo career. Lawless was originally slated to play the T-1000 terminator in the movie &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, but was later replaced by Robert Patrick after Arnold Schwarzenegger deemed Lawless &quot;too tall&quot; (1.93m). Blackie commenced work on his solo project, but under pressure from both promoters and fans, he released it as a W.A.S.P. album. Ironically, many critics feel that the resulting concept album, &quot;The Crimson Idol&quot;, has been the best W.A.S.P. output so far.

The follow-up to &quot;The Crimson Idol&quot; was &quot;Still Not Black Enough&quot; (1995), a collection of dark, introspective tunes that extended the &quot;Crimson Idol&quot; mythology. This time, rather than &quot;hiding behind&quot; alter ego Jonathan Steele, Lawless spoke directly to the audience about his own feelings (as stated in the liner notes). While the album lacked the cohesiveness of its predecessor, the lyrics still explored similar topics to &quot;Crimson Idol&quot;: being an outcast and misfit, the pressures of fame and society, and the search for love. &quot;Still Not Black Enough&quot; also included cover songs as &quot;bonus tracks&quot;. The initial European edition included a different track listing from the American version and a subsequent American re-issue featured yet a different track listing. No version to date includes all the various tracks on one disc.

===Reunion with Chris Holmes (1996–2001)===
Chris Holmes returned to W.A.S.P. in 1996 and together they released &quot;Kill.Fuck.Die&quot; (1997) and &quot;Helldorado&quot; (1999). They also recorded two live albums from these tours, &quot;Double Live Assassins&quot; and &quot;The Sting&quot; respectively. &quot;The Sting&quot; CD and DVD were taken directly from an experimental webcast that Lawless claims to have had no control over. This release angered him as he was unhappy with the sound and picture quality.

The band continued with the album &quot;Unholy Terror&quot; in 2001. Holmes left the band once again that year, stating that he wanted to &quot;play the blues&quot;. He hooked up with fellow ex-W.A.S.P. member Randy Piper&#x27;s band Animal, but soon dropped out of that project also. Holmes, for his part, has claimed he never played on &quot;Unholy Terror&quot;.

===&quot;Dying for the World&quot; and the &quot;Neon God&quot; albums (2002–2005)===
&quot;Dying for the World&quot;, released in 2002, was written and recorded in less than a year which is very fast by Lawless&#x27; perfectionist standards. Its liner notes feature one of Lawless&#x27; strongest statements about political correctness, inspired by the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

In April 2004, W.A.S.P. released the first part of &quot;The Neon God&quot;, subtitled &quot;The Rise&quot;, a conceptual album about an abused and orphaned boy who finds that he has the ability to read and manipulate people. The second part, &quot;The Demise&quot;, was released in September 2004.

In 2005, W.A.S.P. headlined American Metal Blast. A video shoot for the track &quot;Never Say Die&quot; was planned with Ward Boult, a fetish photographer, directing. To this day, there has been no news as to whether the shoot resulted in anything concrete. It would have been the first W.A.S.P. promo video in ten years, the last being 1995&#x27;s &quot;Black Forever&quot;.

===&quot;Dominator&quot; and &quot;Babylon&quot; (2006–2014)===

Early 2006 saw the seemingly stable lineup fall apart. Long-time session and tour drummer Stet Howland left first (on amicable terms), promising more specific information about the reasons for the split to be posted on his website. Larry Howe of Vicious Rumors was considered as a replacement. In May, the departure of guitarist Darrell Roberts, who went on to join the band Five Finger Death Punch, was announced and new guitar player Mark Zavon was brought in several days before the first tour date. The same press release confirmed Mike Dupke, and not Howe, would be the new drummer. Furthermore, two days later, Zavon was out of the picture as well, seeing Doug Blair step in on guitar.

A new album, &quot;Dominator&quot; was planned for release in October 2006, according to a statement made by Blackie Lawless at a tour stop in Kavarna. He then went on to play a new song from the album, entitled &quot;Mercy&quot;. A few weeks later, the release of the album was postponed until April 2007, with the band recording two news songs and dropping two cover songs, to be used instead as bonus tracks. In October 2007, W.A.S.P. embarked on The Crimson Idol Tour, to celebrate that album&#x27;s 15th anniversary. It was the first time that the album, often regarded to be among the band&#x27;s finest work, was performed in full from start to finish. The tour kicked off in Greece, in Thessaloniki at the Principal Club Theater on October 26, 2007.

The release of the &quot;Dominator&quot; album was finalized for April 16 in the UK, April 20 in Scandinavia with the rest of mainland Europe following on April 27. The release dates for South America and Russia followed in early May.

&quot;Dominator&quot; reached No. 72 on the charts in Germany.

W.A.S.P. canceled their North American tour due to their record label&#x27;s loss of a distributor. They were going to finish up their shows in Europe and then reschedule their shows in the United States. They were unable to finish the shows in Europe because of a &quot;family illness that needed immediate attention&quot; which forced the band to return to Los Angeles right away. They were originally going to perform at Rocklahoma. As the tour was canceled, W.A.S.P. was not able to perform at Rocklahoma and was replaced by Queensrÿche.

W.A.S.P. announced a European tour which included dates in Scotland, England and other places throughout Europe in late October 2007.

W.A.S.P. released their fourteenth studio album, entitled &quot;Babylon&quot; in late 2009, via Demolition Records.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Babylon&quot;, Blackie Lawless declared that he was never going to play the song &quot;Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)&quot; live again, due to his religious beliefs. These beliefs are what have allegedly been behind Blackie Lawless&#x27; self-censorship of his own lyrics during the &quot;Babylon World Tour&quot;, most notably during the performance of &quot;Chainsaw Charlie (Murders In The New Morgue)&quot;.

On The Beast of Babylon Tour, Blackie canceled two shows within a week of each other. The first cancellation came about at the Gramercy Theater in New York City after the band discovered that the venue had been selling V.I.P. meet and greet tickets for twice the amount of the general admission price. The band made a statement claiming, &quot;We have never charged a fan for an autograph and will never charge any fans for an autograph.&quot; The second cancellation occurred when the Crocodile Rock venue in Allentown, Pennsylvania wanted 50% of all of the band&#x27;s profit, according to Lawless.

On September 21, 2012, the band celebrated the 30th anniversary of their first ever live show by kicking off a world tour at The Forum in London. The set for the tour was split into three sections: songs from the first four albums, a cut-down rendition of the Crimson Idol performance and a final segment for newer material.

===&quot;Golgotha&quot;, 25th anniversary of &quot;The Crimson Idol&quot; and next album (2015–present)===
W.A.S.P.&#x27;s fifteenth studio album, &quot;Golgotha&quot;, was released on October 2, 2015. The album took four years to materialize.

W.A.S.P. toured in 2017 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the release of &quot;The Crimson Idol&quot;. To coincide with this anniversary, the band released &quot;Reidolized (The Soundtrack to the Crimson Idol)&quot; on February 2, 2018, which came with the original &quot;The Crimson Idol&quot; movie on DVD and Blu-ray, and includes six tracks that were originally intended to be part of the original version of the album.

In December 2017, it was reported that W.A.S.P. had been working on new material for the follow-up to &quot;Golgotha&quot;. No news on the album had surfaced for more than three years, until December 2020 when &quot;Loudwire&quot; listed it as one of the 88 &quot;Most Anticipated Rock + Metal Albums&quot; of 2021. Progress on a new album had continued to be slow by January 2022, when frontman Blackie Lawless stated in an interview with Eddie Trunk that the band has &quot;quite a bit of material that [they&#x27;ve] been working on diligently actually.&quot; He reiterated the album&#x27;s slow progress in July 2024.

Former W.A.S.P. drummer Frankie Banali died of pancreatic cancer on August 20, 2020, making him the second deceased member of &quot;The Crimson Idol&quot;-era lineup, following Bob Kulick who had died three months earlier.

The band embarked on their first North American tour in over a decade from October to December 2022, with support from Armored Saint, and on selected dates, Michael Schenker. While on their North American tour, Lawless stated that he and the band use backing tracks in their live performances during a Q&amp;A session. Additional tours, including in Europe and North America, were rescheduled to spring 2023 and again to 2024 due to the pandemic situation in Europe as well as Lawless&#x27; &quot;extensive back injuries&quot;.

Don Costa, who was bassist in 1982, died on May 29, 2024, aged 65.

==Band name meaning==
There has been much speculation over the origin of the band&#x27;s name, and whether it actually stands for anything, since it is written as an acronym. One possible interpretation is &quot;White Anglo-Saxon Protestants&quot;, being the original meaning of the acronym. The original U.S. release of the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;W.A.S.P.&quot; had the words &quot;We Are Sexual Perverts&quot; inscribed on both sides around the label in the center, while &quot;Winged Assassins&quot; is inscribed on the spine of the first vinyl pressing. When asked about the band&#x27;s name, Lawless has avoided giving a straight answer. In one interview he answered, &quot;We Ain&#x27;t Sure, Pal.&quot;

In a February 2010 interview, Lawless stated the main reason for the name was the periods. He claimed no band had ever used them before and, in essence, the periods created a &quot;question mark of uncertainty&quot; to make W.A.S.P. stand out more. He then went on to say, &quot;Look where we are: it did!&quot;

In an interview published on YouTube in 2020, former bassist Rik Fox explained that the name came about after an incident outside Lawless&#x27; home, in which Fox happened across a hornet and tried to kill it before it could sting him. The sight of the insect&#x27;s throbbing stinger brought to mind the image of the Green Hornet logo. According to Fox, this happened while the band was still under the moniker of &quot;Sister&quot; and Lawless was looking for a new name. When Fox explained what happened to Lawless, the band&#x27;s leader liked the idea and ultimately adopted it. Fox&#x27;s story has been corroborated by former guitarist Randy Piper, who while agreeing with him, did acknowledge Lawless as being the one who came up with the idea of the band&#x27;s name being written as an acronym.

<doc id="174855" wikidata="Q1415915" url="?curid=174855" title="Null-move heuristic">
<text>In computer chess programs, the null-move heuristic is a heuristic technique used to enhance the speed of the alpha–beta pruning algorithm.

== Rationale ==

Alpha–beta pruning speeds the minimax algorithm by identifying &quot;cutoffs&quot;, points in the game tree where the current position is so good for the side to move that best play by the other side would have avoided it. Since such positions could not have resulted from best play, they and all branches of the game tree stemming from them can be ignored. The faster the program produces cutoffs, the faster the search runs. The null-move heuristic is designed to guess cutoffs with less effort than would otherwise be required, whilst retaining a reasonable level of accuracy.

The null-move heuristic is based on the fact that most reasonable chess moves improve the position for the side that played them. So, if the player whose turn it is to move can forfeit the right to move (or make a null move – an illegal action in chess) and still have a position strong enough to produce a cutoff, then the current position would almost certainly produce a cutoff if the current player actually moved.

== Implementation ==

In employing the null-move heuristic, the computer program first forfeits the turn of the side whose turn it is to move, and then performs an alpha–beta search on the resulting position to a shallower depth than it would have searched the current position had it not used the null move heuristic. If this shallow search produces a cutoff, it assumes the full-depth search in the absence of a forfeited turn would also have produced a cutoff. Because a shallow search is faster than deeper search, the cutoff is found faster, accelerating the computer chess program. If the shallow search fails to produce a cutoff, then the program must make the full-depth search.

This approach makes two assumptions. First, it assumes that the disadvantage of forfeiting one&#x27;s turn is greater than the disadvantage of performing a shallower search. Provided the shallower search is not too much shallower (in practical implementation, the null-move search is usually 2 or 3 plies shallower than the full search would have been), this is usually true. Second, it assumes that the null-move search will produce a cutoff frequently enough to justify the time spent performing null-move searches instead of full searches. In practice, this is also usually true.

== Problems with the null-move heuristic ==

There are a class of chess positions where employing the null-move heuristic can result in severe tactical blunders. In these &quot;zugzwang&quot; (German for &quot;forced to move&quot;) positions, the player whose turn it is to move has only bad moves as their legal choices, and so would actually be better off if allowed to forfeit the right to move. In these positions, the null-move heuristic may produce a cutoff where a full search would not have found one, causing the program to assume the position is very good for a side when it may in fact be very bad for them.

To avoid using the null-move heuristic in zugzwang positions, most chess-playing programs that use the null-move heuristic put restrictions on its use. Such restrictions often include not using the null-move heuristic if
* the side to move is in check
* the side to move has only its king and pawns remaining
* the side to move has a small number of pieces remaining
* the previous move in the search was also a null move.

== Verified null-move pruning ==

Another heuristic for dealing with the zugzwang problem is Omid David and Nathan Netanyahu&#x27;s verified null-move pruning. In verified null-move pruning, whenever the shallow null-move search indicates a fail-high, instead of cutting off the search from the current node, the search is continued with reduced depth.

<text>Valeriy Nikolayevich Brumel (; 14 April 1942 – 26 January 2003) was a Soviet-Russian high jumper. The 1964 Olympic champion and multiple world record holder, he is regarded as one of the greatest athletes ever to compete in the high jump. His international career was ended by a motorcycle crash in 1965.

==Early life and education==
Brumel was born in a far eastern Siberian village to a family of geologists exploring the region. They later moved to Luhansk and taught at a local university.

==Athletic career==
Brumel took up the high jump at age 12 in Lugansk, coached by P. S. Shtein. Aged 16 he cleared using the then dominant straight-leg straddle technique. He improved his skills under the coaching of V. M. Dyachkov in Moscow. In 1960 he broke the USSR record, , and was selected to the Olympic team. At the 1960 Summer Olympics, he cleared the same height as the winner Robert Shavlakadze, but made more attempts and thus was awarded a silver medal.
In 1961–1963 he broke his own world record in the high jump six times, improving it from to . He also won the high jump at the 1961 and 1963 Universiade, 1962 European Championships, the 1964 Summer Olympics and the USSR Championships of 1961–1963.

After going undefeated during the 1965 season, Brumel suffered a multiple fracture in his right foot in a motorcycle crash, and faced an amputation. He was operated on successfully by professor Gavriil Ilizarov with a new leg-lengthening procedure using his external fixator. Yet even after 29 surgeries, he could not fully recover. He retired in 1970 after jumping at local competitions.

==Retirement from athletics==
In retirement Brumel turned to acting and writing. He starred in the film &quot;Sport, Sport, Sport&quot; (1970) and wrote the script for &quot;Pravo na pryzhok&quot; (&quot;The right on a jump&quot;, 1973). He also wrote numerous novels and plays, including the novel &quot;Don&#x27;t Change Yourself&quot; (1979), which was translated into seven languages, and the libretto to Rauf Hajiyev&#x27;s operetta &quot;Golden Caravel&quot; (Золотая каравелла).

==Personal life==
Brumel had two brothers, Oleg (1944–2005) and Igor, a Russian politician born in 1952 in Rostov. Brumel was married three times. His first wife, Marina, was a gymnastics instructor. She left him with a son in 1965, when Brumel was recovering from his motorcycle crash. In 1973 Brumel married Yelena Petushkova, an equestrian and 1972 Olympic champion in dressage. The couple divorced 18 months later, citing irreconcilable differences. They had a daughter, Vlada Petushkova, born in 1974, who was raised by her mother. In 1992 Brumel married Svetlana Belousova, who later founded and managed the Valeriy Brumel Fund. They had a son Viktor.

<doc id="174857" wikidata="Q182890" url="?curid=174857" title="Def Leppard">
<text>Def Leppard are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 1976. Since 1992, the band has consisted of Rick Savage (bass, backing vocals), Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Allen (drums), Phil Collen (guitar, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitar, backing vocals). They established themselves as part of the new wave of British heavy metal of the early 1980s. Their greatest commercial success came between the early 1980s and mid–1990s.

With a line-up of Savage, Elliott, Allen and guitarists Steve Clark and Pete Willis, the band&#x27;s first album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;On Through the Night&quot;, reached the Top 15 in the UK but received little notice elsewhere. Their second album, 1981&#x27;s &quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry&quot;, was produced by Mutt Lange, who helped them to define their melodic hard rock style. The album&#x27;s most popular track &quot;Bringin&#x27; On the Heartbreak&quot; became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982, but the album reached only the Top 30 and 40 in the UK and US. Willis was replaced by Collen in 1982. Their next studio album, &quot;Pyromania&quot;, was released in January 1983, with &quot;Photograph&quot; and &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; both topping the US Rock Tracks chart and reaching the top 20 of the Hot 100. Reaching No. 2 on the US album chart, &quot;Pyromania&quot; was certified Diamond in the US. It reached the top 20 in the UK but did not sell much elsewhere. The band&#x27;s fourth album, the more pop-oriented &quot;Hysteria&quot; (1987), topped the UK, US, Canadian and Australian charts, and remained on the charts for over two years, from 1987 to 1989. It has been certified 12× platinum for sales in the US, selling over 30 million copies worldwide to date, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time, and the highest selling glam rock album to date. It spawned six Top 20 US singles, including the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 1 &quot;Love Bites&quot;. Singles also included &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot; (US No. 2), &quot;Hysteria&quot;, &quot;Armageddon It&quot; (US No. 3), &quot;Animal&quot; (at No. 6, the biggest UK hit), and &quot;Rocket&quot; (a Top 15 hit in many countries).

Clark died in 1991, with the band recording their next studio album, &quot;Adrenalize&quot;, as a four-piece. The album reached No. 1 on the UK, US and Australian charts in 1992. It contained several hits, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart-topper &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Rocked&quot;, which became their biggest hit in several countries, including No. 2 in the UK. The third single, &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad&quot;, was a Top 10 song in the US, UK and Canada. &quot;Adrenalize&quot; went on to sell over eight million copies worldwide. Campbell joined the band soon after the album&#x27;s completion. Their 1993 album, &quot;Retro Active&quot;, contained the acoustic Top 5 hit &quot;Two Steps Behind&quot;. Their greatest-hits album &quot;&quot;, released in 1995, featured the UK No. 2 hit &quot;When Love &amp; Hate Collide&quot; and reached the Top 10 in several countries, going 5× platinum in the US. Beginning with &quot;Slang&quot;, Def Leppard released five albums between 1996 and 2008, with most usually reaching the Top 15 in several countries, including the UK, US and Canada. Their self-titled album, released in 2015, reached the Top 10 in several countries. Their newest studio album, &quot;Diamond Star Halos&quot;, was released in May 2022 and reached the Top 10 in the US, UK and Australia, and soon became the band&#x27;s highest rated and best-selling album since &quot;Adrenalize&quot; in 1992.

As one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists, Def Leppard have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, and have two albums with RIAA diamond certification: &quot;Pyromania&quot; and &quot;Hysteria&quot;, making them one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling more than 10 million copies in the US. The band were ranked No. 31 in VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; and No. 70 in &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.

== History ==
=== Atomic Mass and formation (1976–1979) ===
Rick Savage, Tony Kenning, and Pete Doubleday, all students at Tapton School in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, formed a band called Atomic Mass in 1976. Pete Willis joined in 1977, departing briefly but returning full time. The band originally consisted of Doubleday (and later Willis) on guitar, Savage on bass guitar after briefly playing guitar, Kenning on drums, Andy Nicholas on bass and Nick Mackley on lead vocals. Other members to come and go were Paul Holland (vocals), Melanie Davis (guitars, keyboards, violin, bass), Paul Hampshire (lead guitar) and Nick Hawnt (vocals). Only 18 at the time, Joe Elliott tried out for the band as a guitarist following a chance meeting with Willis after missing a bus in November 1977. During his audition it was decided that he was better suited to be the lead singer. The band&#x27;s initial rehearsals took place at Portland Works, and their first gig was in the dining hall in A Block in Westfield School in Mosborough, Sheffield.

Elliott proposed the name &quot;Deaf Leopard&quot; which was originally a band name he thought of while designing band posters in art class. At Kenning&#x27;s suggestion, the spelling was slightly modified in order to make the name seem less like that of a punk band. In January 1978, Steve Clark joined the band. According to Elliott, he successfully auditioned for the band by playing Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Free Bird&quot; in its entirety.

In November, just prior to recording sessions for a three-song release known as &quot;The Def Leppard E.P.&quot;, Kenning abruptly left the band; he later formed the band Cairo. He was replaced for those sessions by Frank Noon. By the end of the month, Rick Allen, then only 15 years old, had joined the band as its full-time drummer. Sales of the EP soared after the track &quot;Getcha Rocks Off&quot; was given extensive airtime by BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, considered at the time to be a champion of punk rock and new wave music.

Throughout 1979, the band developed a loyal following among British hard rock and heavy metal fans and were considered among the leaders of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. Their growing popularity led to a record deal with the major label Phonogram/Vertigo (Mercury Records in the US). Def Leppard&#x27;s original management, MSB, a local duo consisting of Pete Martin and Frank Stuart-Brown, were fired after Martin and Joe Elliott got into a fistfight over an incident on the road. The band approached Peter Mensch of Leber-Krebs management, who had booked them on a tour of the UK supporting AC/DC. Mensch, who admitted that he had had his eye on the band, became their manager.

=== &quot;On Through the Night&quot; and &quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry&quot; (1980–1981) ===
Def Leppard&#x27;s debut album, &quot;On Through the Night&quot;, was released on 14 March 1980. Although the album hit the Top 15 in the UK, many early fans were turned off by the perception that the band was trying too hard to appeal to American audiences by recording songs such as &quot;Hello America&quot; and touring more in the US (supporting Pat Travers, AC/DC, and Ted Nugent); a performance at the Reading Festival in August was marred when audience members expressed their displeasure by pelting the band with beer cans and bottles filled with urine. This incident was partially blamed on a cover story in &quot;Sounds&quot; music newspaper by the journalist Geoff Barton titled, &quot;Has the Leppard changed its spots?&quot;, accusing the band of selling out to the American market. In a documentary on the band recorded for BBC 2, Barton recalls feelings of guilt over the story and having a &quot;stand-up row&quot; with the band&#x27;s manager, Mensch, backstage at the show. In the documentary series &quot;Metal Evolution&quot;, Joe Elliott says that the media had exaggerated the event and all bands on the day had experienced &#x27;abuse&#x27; from the crowd.

The band had by then caught the attention of AC/DC producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, who agreed to work on their second album, &quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry&quot;, released on 6July 1981. Lange&#x27;s meticulous approach in the studio helped them begin to define their sound. Despite the album&#x27;s unimpressive sales figures (it only peaked at number 26 in the UK and 38 in the US), the band&#x27;s video for &quot;Bringin&#x27; On the Heartbreak&quot; became one of the first metal videos played on MTV in 1982, bringing the band increased visibility in the US. The band continued to use the up-and-coming music television industry to reach fans over the years with their unique videos and the extravagance of their concerts. After the album&#x27;s release, European and American tours followed. The band opened for Ozzy Osbourne and Blackfoot.

=== Lineup changes and &quot;Pyromania&quot; (1982–1983) ===
On 11 July 1982, Pete Willis was fired due to excessive alcohol consumption on the job and was replaced by Phil Collen of Girl the next day. This personnel change took place during the recording of their third album, &quot;Pyromania&quot;, which was released on 20 January 1983 and also produced by Lange. The cover artwork depicted a cartoon image of a huge flame emerging from the top floor of a skyscraper, with a bullseye aimed at the flame. The lead single, &quot;Photograph&quot;, turned Def Leppard into a household name, supplanting Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Beat It&quot; as the most requested video on MTV and becoming a staple of rock radio (holding the number 1 position on the US Album Rock Track Chart for six weeks), and sparked a headline tour across the US. The second single, &#x27;Rock of Ages, also reached number 1 on the Rock Tracks chart, with both singles reaching the Top 20 of the Hot 100 (&quot;Photograph&quot; number 12 and &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; number 16), unusual for hard rock songs.

Fuelled by &quot;Photograph&quot;, &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, and the third single &quot;Foolin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Pyromania&quot; went on to sell six million copies in 1983 (more than 100,000 copies every week in that year) and was held from the top of the US charts only by Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. With the album&#x27;s massive success, &quot;Pyromania&quot; was the catalyst for the 1980s pop-metal movement. In 2004, &quot;Pyromania&quot; was certified Diamond having sold over 10 million copies in the US; it was also certified 7× platinum in Canada, where it had peaked at number 4, its second highest certification. With their music videos becoming a staple of MTV &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named them among the artists of the Second British Invasion. The &quot;Pyromania&quot; tour began in England at the Marquee Club on Wardour Street, Soho, London in February 1983. Def Leppard&#x27;s US tour in support of the album began in March opening for Billy Squier and ended with a headlining performance before an audience of 55,000 at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, California in September. As a testament to the band&#x27;s popularity at the time, a US Gallup poll in 1984 saw Def Leppard voted as favourite rock band over the Rolling Stones, AC/DC, and Journey. &quot;Pyromania&quot; was not as successful in their native UK where it reached number 18 on the album chart.

=== Rick Allen car accident (1984) ===

Following their breakthrough, the band moved to Dublin in February 1984 for tax purposes to begin writing the follow-up to &quot;Pyromania&quot;. Mutt Lange initially joined in on the songwriting sessions but then suddenly declined to return as producer due to exhaustion. Jim Steinman of Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; was brought in. However, Steinman worked only briefly with the band, and the recording work was not released.

On the afternoon of 31 December 1984, drummer Rick Allen was involved in a car accident on the A57 road in the countryside a few miles west of Sheffield. While trying to pass another car at a high speed, he lost control of his Corvette C4, which hit a dry stone wall and entered a field; his left arm was severed. Doctors initially reattached the arm, but it was later amputated due to an infection.

=== &quot;Hysteria&quot; (1985–1989) ===
Despite the severity of the accident, Rick Allen was committed to continuing his role as Def Leppard&#x27;s drummer. Soon after, Allen realised that he could use his legs to do some of the drumming work previously done with his arms. He then worked with Simmons to design a custom electronic drum kit. The other members of the band supported Allen&#x27;s recovery and never sought a replacement. Allen was placed in a separate studio to practice his new drums. After a few months, Allen gathered the band together and performed the intro to the Led Zeppelin version of &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; to showcase his progress to the band. Joe Elliott reports this as being a &quot;very emotional moment&quot;. During this period, Mutt Lange returned as producer. Def Leppard brought in Jeff Rich in August 1986 to play alongside Allen during Def Leppard&#x27;s warm-up mini tour of Ireland. When Rich turned up late for a gig, he and the band realised Allen could drum alone. Allen&#x27;s comeback was sealed at the 1986 Monsters of Rock festival in England, with an emotionally charged ovation after his introduction by Joe Elliott.

After over three years of recording, Def Leppard&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Hysteria&quot;, was released on 3August 1987. One of the first singles from the album, &quot;Animal&quot;, became the band&#x27;s first Top 10 hit in the UK, reaching No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Animal&quot; also started their run of ten consecutive US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Top 40 singles. The next single off &quot;Hysteria&quot;, its mid-tempo title track, became the band&#x27;s first Top 10 single in the US, and, peaking at number 13, their highest-charting song in Canada to that date. &quot;Hysteria&quot; topped the UK Album Charts in its first week of release, and spent 105 weeks on the chart. Initial US album sales were relatively slow (compared to &quot;Pyromania&quot;) until the release of the fourth single, &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot;. The song hit No. 2, on the Hot 100 and &quot;Hysteria&quot; finally reached the top of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in July 1988. Although &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot; was not initially a big hit in other countries (number 18 in the UK, number 22 in Canada, and number 26 in Australia), it has come to be regarded as the band&#x27;s signature song, and was ranked No. 2 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the 80s&quot; in 2006. &quot;Hysteria&quot; also topped the album charts in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Norway, at No. 10, was their first album to chart in Germany, and was eventually certified Diamond in sales in the US and 13× Platinum in Canada.

The band&#x27;s UK success saw them nominated for the 1988 Brit Award for Best British Group. In October 1988, the power ballad &quot;Love Bites&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. About reaching No. 1 with &quot;Love Bites&quot;, Elliot reflected: &quot;It&#x27;s strange because we’d been to No. 1 with the album. So now we wanted a No. 1 single because we&#x27;d never had one. So it was like, &#x27;come on! come on!&#x27; When we got there, it was, as you can imagine, a &#x27;yes!&#x27; moment.&quot; It was a Top 10 hit in several other countries, including reaching number six in Canada. In January 1989, the band scored another US Top five hit with &quot;Armageddon It&quot;, and by spring of 1989 the final single &quot;Rocket&quot; was in the Top 15 in the US and several other countries. Wanting to give fans something new after the massive radio and video airplay for not only the seven singles but also the album tracks that radio DJs were playing off the album, the band performed &quot;Tear It Down&quot;, a Hysteria B-side at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards.

&quot;Hysteria&quot; is one of only a handful of albums that has charted seven singles or more on the US Hot 100: &quot;Women&quot; (#80), &quot;Animal&quot; (#19), &quot;Hysteria&quot; (#10), &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot; (#2), &quot;Love Bites (#1), &quot;Armageddon It&quot; (#3), and &quot;Rocket&quot; (#12). Aside from &quot;Women&quot;, these same songs all made the Top 25 on the UK Singles chart. It remained on the charts for three years and has sold over 25 million copies worldwide. Equally successful was the accompanying 16-month &quot;Hysteria&quot; tour, in which the band performed in the round. This concept proved wildly popular with fans (as seen in the videos for &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot; and &quot;Armageddon It&quot;) and was used again for the &quot;Adrenalize&quot; tour.

At the 1989 Brit Awards held at the Royal Albert Hall in London, Def Leppard were again a nominee for Best British Group, and the band performed &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot; at the ceremony. At the 1989 American Music Awards, Def Leppard won Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Artist, as well as Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Album (for &quot;Hysteria&quot;).

=== &quot;Adrenalize&quot;, &quot;Retro Active&quot;, and &quot;Slang&quot; (1990–1996) ===
Following &quot;Hysteria&quot;, the band quickly set out to work on their fifth album, hoping to avoid another lengthy gap. Steve Clark&#x27;s alcoholism worsened to the point that he was constantly in and out of rehab. Recording sessions suffered from this distraction, and in mid-1990, Clark was granted a six-month leave of absence from the band. Clark died from a mix of prescription drugs and alcohol on 8January 1991, in his London home. The remaining band members decided to carry on and recorded the album as a four-piece, with Collen mimicking Clark&#x27;s style on his intended guitar parts.

Def Leppard&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Adrenalize&quot;, was finally released on 31 March 1992. The album simultaneously entered at number one on both the UK and US album charts, staying number one on the latter for five weeks, while also reaching the summit on the Canadian and Australian charts and hitting No. 8 in Germany. The first single, the anthemic &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Rocked&quot;, was an instant hit and remains the band&#x27;s highest-charting song ever in several countries, including the UK (No. 2), Canada (No. 3), Australia (No. 6) and Germany (No. 22), while reaching No. 1 on the US Rock Tracks chart and No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The band performed the song at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards where it was nominated for Best Video of the Year. Like with &quot;Hysteria&quot;, several singles were released off &quot;Adrenalize&quot;, including the rocker &quot;Make Love Like a Man&quot;, the ballad &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad&quot; and the mid-tempo &quot;Heaven Is&quot;, each of which made the Top 15 in the UK, with &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad&quot; being the most successful track in Canada (No. 7) and on the US Hot 100 (No. 12) . Another single, the mid-tempo &quot;Stand Up (Kick Love into Motion)&quot;, was a hit in Canada, peaking at No. 11, and also reached No. 1 on the US Rock Tracks chart, edging out &quot;Make Love Like a Man&quot; (No. 3) as the second most successful track off the album on US rock radio.
In a period between late-1991 and early 1992, auditions for another guitarist commenced. Among the guitarists who auditioned included Adrian Smith, John Sykes, and Gary Hoey. Ultimately, the band chose Vivian Campbell in 1992, formerly of Dio and Whitesnake. In April 1992, Def Leppard appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium, London, performing a three-song set of &quot;Animal&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Rocked&quot; and Queen&#x27;s &quot;Now I&#x27;m Here&quot; with guitarist Brian May. Joe Elliott later performed &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; with the remaining members of Queen and Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash. Another world tour followed but the band&#x27;s fortunes began to be affected by the rise of alternative rock, including grunge. Amidst the increasing popularity of alternative rock, the band decided to balance their original image as rebellious rock stars with a slightly friendlier energy, combining heavy metal with melodies and hooks more reminiscent of pop music. On 6June 1993, Def Leppard performed the first ever rock concert at the Don Valley Stadium in their home city of Sheffield before an audience of over 50,000.

A collection of B-sides and unreleased tracks recorded between 1984 and 1993, called &quot;Retro Active&quot;, was released in October 1993, preceded by the success of the acoustic ballad &quot;Two Steps Behind&quot; (from the Arnold Schwarzenegger film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;). The song charted in many countries, reaching Top 5 in Canada and peaking at No. 12 in the US, where it was their last significant hit song. Another single from &quot;Retro Active&quot;, &quot;Miss You in a Heartbeat&quot;, was also successful in Canada (No. 19) while a cover of &quot;Sweet&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Action&quot; was popular in the UK, reaching No. 14. &quot;Retro Active&quot; made the Top 10 in the UK, US, and Canada and has sold 3 million copies worldwide to date. In 1995, Def Leppard issued their first greatest hits collection, &quot;&quot;, which reached number3 in the UK, Top 10 in several other countries, and eventually sold over 5 million copies in the US. Alternate track listings of the album were issued for North America, the UK, and Japan. The compilation included a new track, the power ballad &quot;When Love &amp; Hate Collide&quot;, which became their biggest ever hit in the UK, hitting No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, while also hitting No. 6 in Canada., their last major hit single in both countries, but barely charted in the US.

On 23 October 1995, the band entered the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; by performing three concerts on three continents in one day (Tangiers, Morocco; Sheffield, England; and Vancouver, Canada). &quot;Slang&quot;, released in May 1996, marked a drastic musical departure for the band by featuring darker lyrics and a stripped-down alternative rock edge. The band rehearsed and played the songs together in the studio instead of recording parts separately, resulting in a much more live-sounding album. The US audience reception for &quot;Slang&quot; and its subsequent tour was a major drop-off from a decade earlier, although &quot;Q Magazine&quot; nonetheless listed &quot;Slang&quot; as one of their Top Ten Albums of 1996. The album only reached No. 14 on the US album chart, and although the track &quot;Work It Out&quot; reached No. 6 on the US Rock Tracks chart, neither it or any of the other singles released off the album charted on the Hot 100. For the first time, a Def Leppard studio album peaked higher in the UK than in the US as it hit No. 5 there, with two singles, the album&#x27;s title track (No. 17), and &quot;Work It Out&quot; (No. 22) performing well on the UK singles chart. In Canada, &quot;Work It Out&quot; was a Top 10 single and while the album only peaked at No. 12, it eventually still went double platinum in sales.

===&quot;Euphoria&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;Yeah!&quot; (1997–2007)===
VH1 revived the band&#x27;s fortunes in the US in 1998 by featuring them on one of the first episodes of &quot;Behind the Music&quot;. Re-runs of the episode yielded some of the series&#x27; highest ratings and brought the band&#x27;s music back into the public consciousness (following years of burial by the alternative rock climate). The episode was even parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In an effort to capitalise on this new momentum, Def Leppard returned to its classic sound with the 1999 album &quot;Euphoria&quot;. The first single, &quot;Promises&quot;, reunited the band with Mutt Lange and hit the US Mainstream Rock Track charts at No. 1 for three weeks although it did not receive much play on Top 40 radio; it was also a moderate hit in the UK and Canada. &quot;Euphoria&quot; peaked at No. 11 in both the UK and US, and at No 14 in Germany, although it was less successful in Canada and Australia.
On 5 September 2000, Def Leppard were inducted into Hollywood&#x27;s RockWalk on Sunset Boulevard by their friend Brian May of Queen. In 2001, VH1 produced and aired &quot;Hysteria – The Def Leppard Story&quot;, a biopic that included Anthony Michael Hall as Mutt Lange and Amber Valletta as Lorelei Shellist (Steve Clark&#x27;s girlfriend). The docudrama covered the band&#x27;s history between 1977 through 1986, recounting the trials and triumphs of Rick Allen and Steve Clark.

Def Leppard&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;X&quot;, saw the band&#x27;s musical direction moving more towards pop and further away from the band&#x27;s hard rock roots. &quot;X&quot; ultimately became the band&#x27;s least successful release, peaking at No. 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. No. 14 on the UK Albums Chart, No. 12 in Canada, and No. 19 in Germany. Its first single, &quot;Now&quot;, reached the Top 30 in the UK and Canada but missed the US Hot 100, only reaching No. 26 on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

An expanded and updated best-of collection, &quot;Best Of&quot;, was released internationally in October 2004. The North America-only version, &quot;Rock of Ages—The Definitive Collection&quot;, was released the following May. Def Leppard participated at the Live 8 show in Philadelphia and toured in the summer with Bryan Adams. In 2005, the band left their long-time management team, Q-Prime, and signed with HK Management.

On 23 May 2006, Def Leppard released an all-covers album titled &quot;Yeah!&quot;. The disc pays homage to classic rock songs of their childhood, originally recorded by Blondie, The Kinks, Sweet, ELO, and Badfinger among others. It debuted at No. 16 in the US, their tenth consecutive Top 20 album. The band toured to promote the album with Journey from June through November 2006 in Europe, the UK, and the US.

The band, along with Queen, Kiss, and Judas Priest, were the inaugural inductees of VH1 Rock Honors on 31 May 2006. During the show, The All-American Rejects paid homage to the band with a cover of &quot;Photograph&quot;. Soon afterwards, they embarked on a US tour with Journey. That October, &quot;Hysteria&quot; was re-released in a two-disc deluxe edition format, which combined the original remastered album with B-sides, remixes, and bonus tracks from single releases. Def Leppard began their Downstage Thrust Tour, on 27 June, which took them across the US and into Canada.

=== &quot;Songs from the Sparkle Lounge&quot; (2008–2010) ===
On 25 April 2008, Def Leppard released their first album of new studio material in six years, &quot;Songs from the Sparkle Lounge&quot;. The album debuted at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US. The first single was entitled &quot;Nine Lives&quot; and featured country singer Tim McGraw, who co-wrote the song with Joe Elliott, Phil Collen, and Rick Savage.
A tour in support of the album began on 27 March 2008 in Greensboro, North Carolina, with Styx and REO Speedwagon. They also played several European rock festivals. An arena tour of the UK took place in June in which the band co-headlined with Whitesnake and were supported by Black Stone Cherry. The band then returned to Europe before coming back for a second leg of the UK tour in June. The first of these dates was at the Glasgow SECC on 17 June. Again they were joined by Whitesnake; however, hard rock band Thunder supported at some of these shows. Black Stone Cherry continued to support most of the dates, including some of the Thunder ones. Six shows which were cancelled during the USA/Canada leg of their world tour due to illnesses affecting Joe Elliott and Phil Collen were rescheduled and played in August of that year. On 11 June, Def Leppard announced further dates for their 2008 World Tour. The extension saw them visit Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Whitesnake continued to support Def Leppard for their Indian and Japanese dates. Def Leppard toured 41 US cities plus Toronto during mid-2009 with Poison and Cheap Trick and also headlined the Download Festival at Donington Park, England to a sell-out crowd of 83,000 with Whitesnake and ZZ Top.

In October 2008, Def Leppard played with country star Taylor Swift in a taped show in Nashville, Tennessee, in a show called CMT Crossroads: Taylor Swift and Def Leppard. This was released as a DVD on 16 June 2009 exclusively at Wal-Mart. The release was the best-selling DVD of the week, and the 10th best-selling Wal-Mart music release. In October 2009, the band announced that they would be cancelling the last leg of the 2009 North American tour, a total of 23 shows. The band cited, &quot;unforeseen personal matters&quot;, as the reason for the cancellations. At the time, the band denied rumours about a break-up, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re not splitting. Not at all. We often joke, what else would we do? You just can&#x27;t imagine doing anything else.&quot;

=== Touring, &quot;Viva! Hysteria&quot; (2011–2014) ===
After taking a year off from touring in 2010, the band announced on 22 February 2011 that they would be releasing their first live album in the summer. &quot;Mirror Ball – Live &amp; More&quot;, a two-disc live album, with three new studio tracks. It was released in parts of Europe on 3June, the rest of Europe on 6June, and on 7June in the US; it was announced at the same time that Def Leppard would perform at the Download Festival on 10 June 2011. Of the three new studio tracks, two were released as singles, the first single being &quot;Undefeated&quot; released in April 2011.
Def Leppard embarked on a two-month US tour in the summer of 2011 with Heart, as well as another seven shows in Australia in October with The Choirboys and Heart, two shows in Japan in November, and six shows in the United Kingdom in December with Steel Panther and Mötley Crüe. The next year, they toured with Poison and Lita Ford from 20 June through 15 September, dubbed the &quot;Rock Of Ages 2012 Tour&quot;.

The year after, Def Leppard played an 11-show residency at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada from 22 March through to 13 April 2013. The residency, referred to as Viva! Hysteria, featured a two-part show, with the first half featuring Def Leppard opening for themselves, under the alias &quot;Ded Flatbird&quot;, (jokingly called the best Def Leppard cover band in the world), when they played songs they very rarely play live, going back to &quot;Good Morning Freedom&quot;, a B-side from the single &quot;Hello America&quot; released in February 1980, an era usually left untouched by the band. The opening set varied each night, from playing the best hits from albums like &quot;On Through the Night&quot;, &quot;Slang&quot;, and &quot;Euphoria&quot;, to being the entire first half of &quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry&quot;. The second half, and &quot;main event&quot; was Def Leppard, as themselves playing their best-selling album, &quot;Hysteria&quot;, from start to finish. A live album, also titled &quot;Viva! Hysteria&quot; was released on 22 October 2013. This was the first time the band had played an album live from start to finish. The band has re-recorded several hits and even the entire album &quot;Hysteria&quot; in an effort to circumvent their record label from future royalties, though of these re-recordings, only &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot;, and &quot;Hysteria&quot; have been released.

On 11 February 2014, the band released a remastered deluxe edition of their 1996 album &quot;Slang&quot; after much delay. The album, still coveted by many loyal fans of the band, now features 30 tracks including demos, B-sides, and unreleased material. From 23 June 2014 to 31 August 2014, Def Leppard and Kiss toured 42 cities, with one dollar per ticket donated to such military charities as Wounded Warrior Project. Def Leppard contributed one song, &quot;Helen Wheels&quot;, to the Paul McCartney tribute album &quot;The Art of McCartney&quot; released on 18 November 2014. Joe Elliott also contributed another track, &quot;Hi, Hi, Hi&quot;. At certain recent points in time the band had projects, such as a cartoon and a documentary, in development. However, these projects seem to have been shelved indefinitely. The band had originally planned to do another residency in Las Vegas, this time in honour of &quot;Pyromania&quot; (called &quot;Viva! Pyromania&quot;), but due to the &quot;Heroes 2014&quot; tour with Kiss, and the recording of their new studio album, the project had been pushed back indefinitely. The new album was originally planned to be an EP, but the set-list increased to 15 songs by June 2014. The album was released on 30 October 2015 with a tour following.

===&quot;Def Leppard&quot;, &quot;Diamond Star Halos&quot; and &quot;Drastic Symphonies&quot; (2015–2023)===
In December 2014, the band announced a 13-date Canadian tour in April and May 2015. This was followed in February 2015 with the announcement of a 2015 US summer tour with Styx and Tesla from June to October 2015. The tour was then extended to include dates in Japan and Australia throughout November, and a tour of the UK and Ireland with Whitesnake in December. Def Leppard then returned to North America with REO Speedwagon and Tesla in early-2016.

The eleventh studio album, titled &quot;Def Leppard&quot;, was recorded in 2014 and 2015, and released on 30 October 2015. The band released the lead single from their self-titled album on 15 September 2015, titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, with a music video for the song being released on 30 October. The 14-track album debuted at number 10 in the US and number 11 in the UK.

During the break following their 2015 tour, Def Leppard led the &quot;Hysteria on the High Seas&quot; concert cruise aboard the &quot;MSC Divina&quot; in January 2016. Joe Elliott became ill with laryngitis on the night of their cruise performance. This led to the band performing without Elliott for the first time in their history. Vivian Campbell and Phil Collen sang lead vocals on two songs of the shortened seven song set in addition to two songs with vocals by Andrew Freeman and two more with Eric Martin and Kip Winger. in addition to this, Campbell and Freeman&#x27;s Last in Line bandmate Jimmy Bain, former bassist of Dio died of lung cancer aboard the ship the same night, causing Last in Line to cancel their show the following day. Back on land, Elliott struggled through the first concert of the 2016 tour, resulting in Tesla&#x27;s Jeff Keith joining Elliott on lead vocals. The following day&#x27;s concert was also postponed &quot;due to illness&quot;, with Rick Allen stating on Twitter &quot;The Doctor basically said that if Joe continues to sing without resting his throat for a month he might do permanent damage.&quot; By July 2016, the band were performing regularly again and intended to complete 48 dates. When the tour stopped at DTE Energy Music Theatre in Clarkston, Michigan, on 15 July, the show was recorded for future release. On 10 February 2017, the band released &quot;And There Will be a Next Time... Live from Detroit&quot;, a double live album and concert video. In August 2017, the band celebrated the 30th anniversary of &quot;Hysteria&quot; by releasing a collector&#x27;s edition box. The singles were also re-released on vinyl.
In January 2018, Def Leppard announced they would embark on a 58-date North American tour with Journey. The tour included ten dates in baseball stadiums, a first for the band, with special guests Cheap Trick. The tour was highly successful, as the bands played in front of more than a million fans in North America in just three months, marking the tour out as one of the most successful in 2018. In addition, the group&#x27;s discography was made available for streaming and digital download after a deal was reached between the band and Universal Music Group.

On 30 November 2018, the band released a new two-disc best of compilation, &quot;The Story So Far – The Best Of&quot;. In addition to 34 of Def Leppard&#x27;s greatest hits, the collection featured the band&#x27;s new cover of the Depeche Mode hit &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; (which was originally released in July 2018 for Spotify Singles), the new Christmas track &quot;We All Need Christmas&quot;, and the new remix of &quot;Rock On&quot;. On the same day, a new limited edition, 10-disc vinyl box set featuring all of the 7&quot; singles from the Hysteria album was released. The band finished the year off with a sell-out tour of the UK and Ireland titled Hysteria &amp; More Tour. They embarked on a world tour in 2019 beginning with the Sweden Rock Festival on 6June. In March 2019, it was announced that the band would undertake a second Las Vegas residency titled Def Leppard Hits Vegas—The Sin City Residency. The box set &quot;The Early Years 79-81&quot; was released in March 2020, featuring remastered versions of the band&#x27;s first two albums plus a variety of live recordings, B-sides, and studio outtakes from the 1979 to 1981 period.

On 4 December 2019, the band announced they would be touring with Mötley Crüe, Poison, and Joan Jett on The Stadium Tour in summer 2020, which was later rescheduled to 2021, and then to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 15 March 2022, Def Leppard announced their twelfth studio album, &quot;Diamond Star Halos&quot;. The album is named after a lyric in the Marc Bolan-penned T. Rex song &quot;Get It On&quot;. On 17 March, the band released the lead single, &quot;Kick&quot;. The album released on 27 May, receiving moderate to positive reviews, reaching Number 10 on the US Billboard 200. &#x27;Diamond Star Halos&#x27; is the band&#x27;s highest-charting album since 1992&#x27;s Adrenalize.

In January 2023, Joe Elliot was featured on a new version of Ghost&#x27;s single Spillways released as Ghost and Def Leppard.

On 16 March 2023, a teaser video was uploaded to the official Def Leppard YouTube channel, announcing an album titled &quot;Drastic Symphonies&quot;. The album was released on 19 May and featured 16 tracks from previous albums reworked, stripped, or re-recorded. All tracks feature newly composed orchestra combined with most of the original vocals, performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The album reached number 4 on the UK album chart, making this their highest chart position for many years.

===Upcoming thirteenth studio album (2024–present)===
On 13 June 2024, Def Leppard released its first song in two years, &quot;Just Like 73&quot;, featuring a guest guitar solo by Tom Morello. When asked that same month on Sirius XM&#x27;s &quot;Trunk Nation With Eddie Trunk&quot; if it is a one-off single or the seed of the band&#x27;s next album, guitarist Phil Collen said, &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s absolutely the seed of another Def Leppard record. I mean, it was a leftover from the album before, but it was also the start of a new album. So, without a doubt. [Joe and I] write all the time. We send each other things. Sav gets in on there. Just between the three of us, there&#x27;s just a lot of stuff floating around already. So we&#x27;ve, yeah, got a bunch of stuff. It&#x27;s really exciting. And it&#x27;s a great place to be. It&#x27;s never that thing where, &#x27;Well, we&#x27;ve got to sit down and write an album.&#x27; It&#x27;s, like, &#x27;Wow, I can&#x27;t wait to play this to the guys and see what the reaction is.&#x27; And we keep pushing the boat out even further.&quot; He also mentioned a possible 2025 or 2026 release date for the new album, &quot;You know how these things go. We have these tours and everything, but we&#x27;ve got a new song. So that&#x27;s really exciting. So that&#x27;ll be on the go pretty soon.&quot;

== Musical style and influences==
Def Leppard&#x27;s musical style has been described as &quot;catchy&quot; and &quot;guitar-driven&quot;, and has been categorised as glam metal (hair metal, pop metal), hard rock, heavy metal, arena rock, and power pop. Def Leppard&#x27;s music is a mixture of hard rock, AOR, pop and heavy metal elements, with its multi-layered, harmonic vocals and its melodic guitar riffs. In addition, making a concession to popular tastes of its time, &quot;Slang&quot; featured a sparser sound and alternative rock feel. Though they were often considered one of the top bands of the new wave of British heavy metal movement of the late 1970s, the band disliked the branding, stating: &quot;We didn&#x27;t agree that our music was anything like Iron Maiden&#x27;s.&quot;

In the mid-1980s, the band were associated with the growing glam metal scene, mainly due to their mainstream success and glossy production. &quot;Pyromania&quot; has been cited as the catalyst for the 1980s pop-metal movement. Def Leppard, however, expressed their dislike of the &quot;glam metal&quot; label as well, as they thought it did not accurately describe their look or musical style. By the release of the &quot;Hysteria&quot; album, the band had developed a distinctive sound featuring electronic drums and effects-laden guitar sounds overlaid with a multi-layered wall of husky, harmonised vocals. According to Joe Elliott, Def Leppard are influenced by &quot;everything from pure pop to downright hardcore rock&quot;. He has cited Ian Hunter and Mott The Hoople among the band&#x27;s early influences. Def Leppard themselves have been cited as an influence by a wide range of musical artists, including Matt Nathanson and Taylor Swift.

==Legacy==

With &quot;Pyromania&quot; and &quot;Hysteria&quot; both certified Diamond by the RIAA, Def Leppard are one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling over 10 million copies each in the US, alongside the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Van Halen. Both &quot;Pyromania&quot; and &quot;Hysteria&quot; feature in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

Def Leppard were among the most successful of the new wave of British heavy metal bands in the early 1980s. They combined the raw power of metal with a pop emphasis on melody, catchy hooks and vocal harmonies that, particularly later on, contrasted sharply with harsher contemporary metal and punk bands. Their early album &quot;On Through the Night&quot; (1980) appealed to metal fans like of Dimebag Darrell of Pantera and Jeff Hanneman of Slayer. Their hugely popular later albums, such as &quot;Hysteria&quot; (1987), were different due to their perfectionism in the studio, but appealed to a broad range of music fans.

In 2006, the band received a Sheffield Legends plaque in their hometown of Sheffield. Despite their huge commercial success, Elliott has said in an interview that he feels the band does not receive its fair share of respect from the British music press and he said the band had been barred from the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Later with Jools Holland&quot; series because they were &quot;not cool enough&quot;.

The band made a cameo appearance in the partly fictional film &quot;Bank of Dave&quot;, released in January 2023. They simulated giving a fund-raising concert at Turf Moor, Burnley.

=== Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ===
On 9 October 2018, Def Leppard received an induction nomination from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition to the 1,000 members of the Hall of Fame voting committee, the general public also had an opportunity to participate in the &quot;Fan Vote&quot;. On 13 December 2018, Def Leppard were named in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s Class of 2019. The band won the Klipsch Audio Fan Vote, beating 14 other nominees with 547,647 general public votes (119,803 and 28% more than second vote receiver Stevie Nicks).

The current line-up of the band, along with past members Pete Willis and Steve Clark, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 29 March 2019 at a ceremony at Brooklyn&#x27;s Barclays Center. Def Leppard were inducted by Queen guitarist Brian May, who said they were &quot;a magnificent rock group, in the classic tradition of what a rock group really is&quot; and &quot;a bunch of magnificent human beings&quot;.

== Side projects ==
Phil Collen played guitar, uncredited, on Sam Kinison&#x27;s &quot;Wild Thing&quot; in 1988. The video featured members of bands such as Poison, Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Ratt, and Aerosmith. Collen also produced and played on the 1991 album &quot;On the Edge&quot; by Australian band BB Steal.

Joe Elliott sang lead vocals on two tracks on Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood&#x27;s 1992 solo album, &quot;Slide on This&quot;. His then-wife Karla appeared in the videos for &quot;Always Wanted More&quot; and &quot;Somebody Else Might&quot;. Various members of Def Leppard have played on tribute records for Jeff Beck, AC/DC, and Alice Cooper.

A fan of his local football club Sheffield United F.C., Elliott performed on two tracks to the soundtrack of the 1996 Sheffield-set motion picture, &quot;When Saturday Comes&quot; (featuring fellow Sheffield native Sean Bean as a star football player), the title track and an instrumental, &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Theme&quot;. Elliott sang and co-wrote the opening track, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Down&quot; on Mick Ronson&#x27;s farewell album &quot;Heaven and Hull&quot;. A promotional video was issued for the song as well.

Cybernauts was a side project consisting of Elliott and Collen teamed with members of The Spiders From Mars (David Bowie&#x27;s former band), minus the late Mick Ronson. The group played several shows, covering Bowie&#x27;s Ziggy Stardust-era songs and released one internet-only album (since deleted).

Vivian Campbell has played with two side bands in recent years, Clock and the Riverdogs, and recorded a solo album, &quot;Two Sides of If&quot;, released in 2005. Campbell toured with Thin Lizzy in early 2011 before joining Def Leppard on their Mirrorball tour.

Collen sings lead vocals and plays guitar in a side band called Man Raze with Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook and former Girl bandmate Simon Laffy. They released their debut album &quot;Surreal&quot; in 2008 and a second album, &quot;PunkFunkRootsRock&quot;, in 2011.

Joe Elliott founded and fronts the band Down &#x27;n&#x27; Outz with members of The Quireboys. The band plays covers of Mott the Hoople and related artists such as British Lions and Ian Hunter. They have released two studio albums of covers, one of original material and one live album since their incarnation in 2009.

Following the death of Ronnie James Dio, Vivian Campbell reunited with the rest of the original Dio line-up with vocalist Andrew Freeman to form Last in Line. The band pays tribute to Dio by playing songs from their original tenure in the band and released an album titled Heavy Crown in February 2016.

Joe Elliott, along with various other musicians including Glenn Hughes, Duff McKagan, Sebastian Bach, Matt Sorum, Gilby Clarke and Steve Stevens formed a supergroup called Kings of Chaos, whose catalogue consists of songs by Deep Purple, Def Leppard, Guns N&#x27; Roses and others. In 2012, Kings of Chaos recorded their version of Deep Purple&#x27;s classic, &quot;Never Before&quot; featuring Elliott singing lead vocals. Kings of Chaos played Stone Fest in Australia along with a few dates in South America in 2013.

Phil Collen formed a blues project by the name of Delta Deep with vocalist Debbi Blackwell Cook which released an eponymous debut in 2015.

In October 2020, Joe Elliott and Phil Collen played on the Struts song, &quot;I Hate How Much I Want You&quot;, part of their &quot;Strange Days&quot; album.

<text>Steven J. Brams (born November 28, 1940, in Concord, New Hampshire) is an American game theorist and political scientist at the New York University Department of Politics. Brams is best known for using the techniques of game theory, public choice theory, and social choice theory to analyze voting systems and fair division. He is one of the independent discoverers of approval voting, as well as extensions of approval voting to multiple-winner elections to give proportional representation of different interests.

Brams was a co-discoverer, with Alan Taylor, of the first envy-free cake-cutting solution for &quot;n&quot; people.
Previous to the Brams-Taylor procedure, the cake-cutting problem had been one of the most important open problems in contemporary mathematics. He is co-inventor with Taylor of the fair-division procedure, adjusted winner, which was patented by New York University in 1999 (# 5,983,205).

Brams has applied game theory to a wide variety of strategic situations, from the Bible and theology to international relations to sports.

==Education==
Brams earned his B.S. at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Politics, Economics, and Science in 1962. In 1966, he earned his Ph.D. in Political Science at Northwestern University.

==Career==
Brams worked briefly in U.S. federal government positions and for the Institute for Defense Analyses before taking an assistant professor position at Syracuse University in 1967. He moved to New York University in 1969, where he is professor in the Department of Politics. He has been a visiting professor at the University of Rochester, the University of Michigan, the University of California, Irvine, the University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University.

In 1990–1991 he was president of the Peace Science Society (International); in 2004–2006, he was president of the Public Choice Society.
He is a Guggenheim Fellow (1986–87), an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow (1992), and was a Russell Sage Foundation Visiting Scholar (1998–99).

<text>GusGus is an electronic music band from Reykjavík, Iceland. Although initially a film and acting collective, the group is mostly known for its electronic music. The group&#x27;s discography consists of twelve studio albums.

== History ==
GusGus was initially formed in 1995 as a film and acting collective. The band&#x27;s name refers to the 1974 German film &quot;&quot; () by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, where a female character is cooking couscous for her lover, pronouncing it &quot;Gusgus&quot;. GusGus&#x27; music is eclectic, and although primarily classified as techno, trip hop, and house music, the band has experimented with other styles. They have remixed songs of popular artists such as Björk, Depeche Mode, Moloko, and Sigur Rós.

Membership in the band has varied, and included:
* Daníel Ágúst Haraldsson
* Emilíana Torrini Davíðsdóttir
* Magnús Jónsson (aka Blake)
* Hafdís Huld Þrastardóttir
* Urður Hákonardóttir (aka Earth)
* Högni Egilsson
* Birgir Þórarinsson (aka Biggi Veira or Biggo)
* Magnús Guðmundsson (aka Maggi Lego, Herb Legowitz, Hunk of a Man, Buckmaster De La Cruz, The Fox, Fuckmaster, or Herr Legowitz)
* Stephan Stephensen (aka President Bongo, Alfred More, or President Penis)
* Sigurður Kjartansson (aka Siggi Kinski)
* Stefán Árni Þorgeirsson
* Baldur Stefánsson (Director of Financial Arts, aka DJ Tekno Jörgensen)
* Ragnheiður Axel
* Páll Garðarsson

In 1997, the band performed in Toronto. They returned for a second visit as part of a tour supporting their second album, &quot;Polydistortion&quot;.

In 1998, a remix of the track &quot;Purple&quot; appeared on Paul Oakenfold&#x27;s trance compilation &quot;Tranceport&quot;.

After the group&#x27;s third album, &quot;This Is Normal&quot; (1999), the filmmaking arm of GusGus (Kjartansson and Árni Þorgeirsson) split off to form the production company Celebrator, now known as Arni &amp; Kinski, which has produced advertisements and videos.

In January 2004, they released the song &quot;Desire&quot; with Ian Brown.

As of 2011 the band had sold over 700,000 copies worldwide.

Its 2015 incarnation consists of four members (President Bongo, Biggi Veira, Urður Hákonardóttir and Daníel Ágúst Haraldsson). A few former members such as Hafdís Huld, Blake, and Daníel Ágúst have gone solo; Emilíana Torrini provided a song for the soundtrack of Peter Jackson&#x27;s film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;.

<text>Dudley Robert Herschbach (born June 18, 1932) is an American chemist at Harvard University. He won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Chemistry jointly with Yuan T. Lee and John C. Polanyi &quot;for their contributions concerning the dynamics of chemical elementary processes&quot;. Herschbach and Lee specifically worked with molecular beams, performing crossed molecular beam experiments that enabled a detailed molecular-level understanding of many elementary reaction processes. Herschbach is a member of the Board of Sponsors of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Herschbach was born in San Jose, California on June 18, 1932. The eldest of six children, he grew up in a rural area. He graduated from Campbell High School, where he played football. Offered both athletic and academic scholarships to Stanford University, Herschbach chose the academic. His freshman advisor, Harold S. Johnston, hired him as a summer research assistant, and taught him chemical kinetics in his senior year. His master&#x27;s research involved calculating Arrhenius A-factors for gas-phase reactions. Herschbach received a B.S. in mathematics in 1954 and an M.S. in chemistry in 1955 from Stanford University.

Herschbach then attended Harvard University, where he earned an A.M. in physics in 1956 and a Ph.D. in chemical physics in 1958 under the direction of Edgar Bright Wilson. At Harvard, Herschbach examined tunnel splitting in molecules, using microwave spectroscopy. He was awarded a three-year Junior Fellowship in the Society of Fellows at Harvard, lasting from 1957 to 1959.

==Research==

In 1959, Herschbach joined the University of California at Berkeley, where he was appointed an assistant professor of chemistry and became an associate professor in 1961. At Berkeley, he and graduate students George Kwei and James Norris constructed a cross-beam instrument large enough for reactive scattering experiments involve alkali and various molecular partners. His interest in studying elementary chemical processes in molecular-beam reactive collisions challenged an often-accepted belief that &quot;collisions do not occur in crossed molecular beams&quot;. The results of his studies of K + CH3I were the first to provide a detailed view of an elementary collision, demonstrating a direct rebound process in which the KI product recoiled from an incoming K atom beam. Subsequent studies of K + Br2 resulted in the discovery that the hot-wire surface ionization detector they were using was potentially contaminated by previous use, and had to be pre-treated to obtain reliable results. Changes to the instrumentation yielded reliable results, including the observation that the K + Br2 reaction involved a stripping reaction, in which the KBr product scattered forward from the incident K atom beam. As the research continued, it became possible to correlate the electronic structure of reactants and products with the reaction dynamics.

In 1963, Herschbach returned to Harvard University as a professor of chemistry. There he continued his work on molecular-beam reactive dynamics, working with graduate students Sanford Safron and Walter Miller on the reactions of alkali atoms with alkali halides. In 1967, Yuan T. Lee joined the lab as a postdoctoral student, and Herschbach, Lee, and graduate students Doug MacDonald and Pierre LeBreton began to construct a &quot;supermachine&quot; for studying collisions such as Cl + Br2 and hydrogen and halogen reactions.

His most acclaimed work, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1986 with Yuan T. Lee and John C. Polanyi, was his collaboration with Yuan T. Lee on crossed molecular beam experiments. Crossing collimated beams of gas-phase reactants allows partitioning of energy among translational, rotational, and vibrational modes of the product molecules—a vital aspect of understanding reaction dynamics. For their contributions to reaction dynamics, Herschbach and Lee are considered to have helped create a new field of research in chemistry. Herschbach is a pioneer in molecular stereodynamics, measuring and theoretically interpreting the role of angular momentum and its vector properties in chemical reaction dynamics.

In the course of his life&#x27;s work in research, Herschbach has published over 400 scientific papers. Herschbach has applied his broad expertise in both the theory and practice of chemistry and physics to diverse problems in chemical physics, including theoretical work on dimensional scaling. One of his studies demonstrated that methane is, in fact, spontaneously formed at high-pressure and high-temperature environments such as those deep in the Earth&#x27;s mantle; this finding is an exciting indication of abiogenic hydrocarbon formation, meaning that the actual amount of hydrocarbons available on Earth might be much larger than conventionally assumed under the assumption that all hydrocarbons are fossil fuels. His recent work also includes a collaboration with Steven Brams studying approval voting.

==Science and education==
Hershbach&#x27;s teaching ranges from graduate seminars on chemical kinetics to an introductory undergraduate course in general chemistry that he taught for many years at Harvard, and described as his &quot;most challenging assignment&quot;.

Herschbach has been a strong proponent of science education and science among the general public, and frequently gives lectures to students of all ages, imbuing them with his infectious enthusiasm for science and his playful spirit of discovery. Herschbach has also lent his voice to the animated television show &quot;The Simpsons&quot; for the episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror XIV&quot;, where he is seen presenting the Nobel Prize in Physics to Professor Frink.

In October 2010, Herschbach participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Lunch with a Laureate program, where middle and high school students get to engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch. He is also a member of the Festival&#x27;s advisory board. Herschbach has participated in the Distinguished Lecture Series of the Research Science Institute (RSI), a summer research program for high school students held at MIT.

Although still an active research professor at Harvard, he joined the Texas A&amp;M University faculty September 1, 2005, as a professor of physics, teaching one semester per year in the chemical physics program. As of 2010, he holds the title of professor emeritus at Harvard and remains well known for his involvement as a lecturer and mentor in the Harvard research community. He and his wife Georgene Herschbach also served for several years as the co-Masters of Currier House, where they were highly involved in undergraduate life in addition to their full-time duties.

==Public service==
He is a board member of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation and was the chairman of the board for Society for Science &amp; the Public from 1992 to 2010. Herschbach is a member of the Board of Sponsors of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.

He is also an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (DESA).

==Family==

Herschbach&#x27;s wife, Georgene Herschbach, served as the Associate Dean of Harvard College for Undergraduate Academic Programs. Prior to retirement in 2009, she chaired Harvard College&#x27;s influential Committee on Undergraduate Education.

==Awards and honors==

Herschbach is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society and the Royal Chemical Society of Great Britain. In addition to the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, he has received a wide variety of national and international awards. These include the National Medal of Science, the ACS Award in Pure Chemistry, the Linus Pauling Medal, the Irving Langmuir Award, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, and the American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal. He endowed the Herschbach Medal, which is given by the biennial Conference on Molecular Collision Dynamics, to recognize &quot;outstanding theoretical and experimental contributions to the field.&quot;

<doc id="174868" wikidata="Q610560" url="?curid=174868" title="Stridulation">
<text>Stridulation is the act of producing sound by rubbing together certain body parts. This behavior is mostly associated with insects, but other animals are known to do this as well, such as a number of species of fish, snakes and spiders. The mechanism is typically that of one structure with a well-defined lip, ridge, or nodules (the &quot;scraper&quot; or &quot;plectrum&quot;) being moved across a finely-ridged surface (the &quot;file&quot; or &quot;stridulitrum&quot;—sometimes called the &quot;pars stridens&quot;) or vice versa, and vibrating as it does so, like the dragging of a phonograph needle across a vinyl record. Sometimes it is the structure bearing the file which resonates to produce the sound, but in other cases it is the structure bearing the scraper, with both variants possible in related groups. Common onomatopoeic words for the sounds produced by stridulation include &quot;chirp&quot; and &quot;chirrup&quot;.

==Arthropod stridulation==

Insects and other arthropods stridulate by rubbing together two parts of the body. These are referred to generically as the &quot;stridulatory organs&quot;.
The mechanism is best known in crickets, mole crickets, and grasshoppers, but other insects which stridulate include Curculionidae (weevils and bark beetles), Cerambycidae (longhorned beetles), Mutillidae (&quot;velvet ants&quot;), Reduviidae (assassin bugs), Buprestidae (metallic wood-boring beetles), Hydrophilidae (water scavenger beetles), Cicindelinae (tiger beetles), Scarabaeidae (scarab beetles), Glaresidae (&quot;enigmatic scarabs&quot;), larval Lucanidae (stag beetles), Passalidae (Bessbugs), Geotrupidae (earth-boring dung beetles), Alydidae (broad-headed bugs), Largidae (bordered plant bugs), Miridae (leaf bugs), Corixidae (water boatmen, notably &quot;Micronecta scholtzi&quot;), various ants (including the Black imported fire ant, &quot;Solenopsis richteri&quot;), some stick insects such as &quot;Pterinoxylus spinulosus&quot;, and some species of Agromyzidae (leaf-mining flies). While cicadas are well-known for sound production via abdominal tymbal organs, it has been demonstrated that some species can produce sounds via stridulation, as well.

Stridulation is also known in a few tarantulas (Arachnida), certain centipedes, such as &quot;Scutigera coleoptrata&quot;, and some pill millipedes (Diplopoda, Oniscomorpha).
It is also widespread among decapod crustaceans, e.g., rock lobsters. Most spiders are silent, but some tarantula species are known to stridulate. When disturbed, &quot;Theraphosa blondi&quot;, the Goliath tarantula, can produce a rather loud hissing noise by rubbing together the bristles on its legs. This is said to be audible to a distance of up to 15 feet (4.5 m). One of the wolf spiders, &quot;Schizocosa stridulans&quot;, produces low-frequency sounds by flexing its abdomen (tremulation, rather than stridulation) or high-frequency stridulation by using the cymbia on the ends of its pedipalps. In most species of spiders, stridulation commonly occurs by males during sexual encounters. In the species &quot;Holocnemus pluchei&quot;, females also possess stridulatory organs, and both sexes engage in stridulation. In the species &quot;Steatoda nobilis,&quot; the males produce stridulation sounds during mating.

The anatomical parts used to produce sound are quite varied: the most common system is that seen in grasshoppers and many other insects, where a hind leg scraper is rubbed against the adjacent forewing (in beetles and true bugs the forewings are hardened); in crickets and katydids a file on one wing is rubbed by a scraper on the other wing; in longhorned beetles, the back edge of the pronotum scrapes against a file on the mesonotum; in various other beetles, the sound is produced by moving the head—up/down or side-to-side—while in others the abdominal tergites are rubbed against the elytra; in assassin bugs, the tip of the mouthparts scrapes along a ridged groove in the prosternum; in velvet ants the back edge of one abdominal tergite scrapes a file on the dorsal surface of the following tergite.

Stridulation in several of these examples is for attracting a mate, or as a form of territorial behaviour, but can also be a warning signal (acoustic aposematism, as in velvet ants and tarantulas). This kind of communication was first described by Slovenian biologist Ivan Regen (1868–1947).

==Vertebrate stridulation==
Some species of venomous snakes stridulate as part of a threat display. They arrange their body into a series of parallel C-shaped (counterlooped) coils that they rub together to produce a sizzling sound, rather like water on a hot plate. The best-known examples are members of the genus &quot;Echis&quot; (saw-scaled vipers), although those of the genus &quot;Cerastes&quot; (North African desert vipers) and at least one bush viper species, &quot;Atheris desaixi&quot;, do this as well. A bird species, the club-winged manakin, has a dedicated stridulation apparatus, while a species of mammal, the lowland streaked tenrec, (&quot;Hemicentetes semispinosus&quot;) produces a high-pitched noise by rubbing together specialised quills on its back.

<doc id="174870" wikidata="Q6518477" url="?curid=174870" title="Legitimacy of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia">
<text>The legitimacy under international law of the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been questioned. The UN Charter is the foundational legal document of the United Nations (UN) and is the cornerstone of the public international law governing the use of force between States. NATO members are also subject to the North Atlantic Treaty. 

Supporters of the bombing argued that the bombing brought to an end the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo&#x27;s Albanian population, and that it hastened (or caused) the downfall of Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s government, which they saw as having been responsible for the international isolation of Yugoslavia, war crimes, and human rights violations. 

Critics of the bombing have argued that the campaign violated international law. Some also argued that NATO triggered or accelerated the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo as the violence escalated once the campaign began.

==Legal justifiability of launching the war==
The laws of public international law that determine whether launching a war is legally justified are called &quot;jus ad bellum&quot;.

===NATO&#x27;s argument for the bombing&#x27;s legitimacy===
NATO described the conditions in Kosovo as posing a risk to regional stability. As such, NATO and certain governments asserted they had a legitimate interest in developments in Kosovo, due to their impact on the stability of the whole region which, they claimed, is a legitimate concern of the Organisation.

=== The UN Charter ===
The UN Charter is legally binding on all United Nations member states, including all members of NATO, because they have each signed it. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of force by UN member states to resolve disputes, but with two specific exceptions to this general prohibition: 
# The first exception is set forth in Chapter VII – the UN Security Council has the power to authorize the use of force in order to fulfill its responsibility to maintain international peace and security. In particular, Article 42 states that should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations.
# Article 51 contains the second specific exception to the prohibition on the use of force – the right to self-defence. In particular, Article 51 states that nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.

NATO did not have the backing of a Chapter VII UN Security Council resolution to use force in Yugoslavia. Nor did NATO claim the right of collective self defence. Since NATO as such is not a member state of the UN, whether the member states of NATO, the United States and the European powers that sent armed forces to attack as part of the NATO bombing campaign, violated the UN Charter by attacking a fellow UN member state: (1) in the absence of UN Security Council authorization, and (2) in the absence of an attack or a threat of imminent attack on them.

The United Nations considers NATO to be a &quot;regional arrangement&quot; under UN Article 52, which allows it to deal with matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action provided that such arrangements or agencies and their activities are consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations. However, the UN policy on military intervention by regional arrangements in UN Article 53 states the Security Council can, where appropriate, &quot;utilize such regional arrangements or agencies for enforcement action under its authority. However, no enforcement action shall be taken under regional arrangements or by regional agencies without the authorization of the Security Council.&quot;

The arguments in favour of the legality of intervention are twofold. Articles 1(3), 55,and 56 of the UN charter impose the legal obligation on UN member states to respect basic human rights. Three prior Chapter VII UN Security Council resolutions had already concluded that Yugoslavia was in violation of these basic human right. However, the use of force is not explicitly authorised in either the two Security Council resolutions resolutions nor Articles 1(3), 55,and 56 of the UN charter. Thus proponents of the legality of the invasion argue that international customary law authorises the use of force. These proponents argue that when there is overwhelming humanitarian necessity, cases such as the no fly zones over Iraq in 1991, the 1827 intervention by Britain, France and Russia to protect the Greeks, India&#x27;s intervention in Pakistan in 1971, Vietnamese intervention against the Khmer Rouge and the Tanzinian intervention in Uganda in 1979 show that intervention is legal.

=== NATO&#x27;s charter ===
Because the NATO actions in Kosovo were taken after consultation with all members, were approved by a NATO vote, and were undertaken by several NATO members, NATO contends that its actions were in accordance with its charter. Article 4, however, is silent as to the use of force and does not discuss under what circumstances force may be authorized.

Article 5 of NATO&#x27;s charter calls on NATO members to respond in mutual defense when any NATO member is attacked. It is unclear whether under the NATO charter force may be used in the absence of such an attack. Article 5 has been interpreted as restricting NATO&#x27;s use of force to situations where a NATO member has been attacked. It has been argued, therefore, that NATO&#x27;s actions were in violation of the charter of NATO.

===International criticism of NATO actions===

====Kofi Annan====
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan supported intervention in principle, saying &quot;there are times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace&quot;, but was critical of unilateral action by NATO. He argued &quot;under the [UN] Charter the Security Council has primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security - and this is explicitly acknowledged in the North Atlantic Treaty. Therefore, the Council should be involved in any decision to resort to the use of force.&quot;

====Russian attempt to end the bombing====
On the day the bombing started, Russia called for the UN Security Council to meet to consider &quot;an extremely dangerous situation caused by the unilateral military action of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&quot;. However, a draft resolution, tabled jointly by Russia, Belarus and India, to demand &quot;an immediate cessation of the use of force against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&quot; was defeated. Among the 15 UN Security Council nations, there were three votes in favour (Russia, China and Namibia) and twelve against, with no abstentions. Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, Gambia, Malaysia, and Slovenia, along with the US, Britain, France, Canada, and Netherlands voted against it.

Rejection of Russia&#x27;s condemnation amounted to political, but not legal, support of NATO&#x27;s intervention. After the war ended with the Kumanovo Treaty and the bombing stopped, some argued that the creation on 10 June 1999 of the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), by Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999), constituted a legal ratification post festum (after the event).

====Muammar Gaddafi====
One of the few countries to support the Yugoslav government fully during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia was that of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi. This friendship between Libya and Yugoslavia dates back to before the fall of the latter, as Gaddafi maintained a close relationship with Josip Broz Tito. At his 2009 speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Gaddafi strongly condemned the intervention in Yugoslavia, along with earlier U.S. interventions in Grenada and Panama. Libya&#x27;s support for Yugoslavia throughout the 1990s led to many in Serbia supporting the Gaddafi government in during the First Libyan Civil War in 2011, with many Serbs drawing parallels between the 2011 NATO intervention in Libya and Serbia&#x27;s own experience with NATO intervention.

==Humanitarian reasoning==
The bombing campaign is sometimes referred to as a &quot;humanitarian war&quot; or a case of &quot;humanitarian intervention&quot;. Part of NATO&#x27;s justification for the bombing was to end the humanitarian crisis involving the large outflow of Kosovar Albanian refugees caused by Yugoslav forces. In April 1999, the development of this humanitarian crisis as well as accusations of genocide were used by policy-makers in the United States and Europe to legally justify the campaign on the basis of &quot;humanitarian law&quot;, allowing for intervention where large scale human rights violations are occurring. Human rights organizations and individuals were divided on the campaign, given that the invocation of human rights and humanitarian law was used to initiate war. Moreover, they expressed doubts about the campaign given that it worsened the violence against Kosovar Albanians. Critics of the campaign have employed the term &quot;humanitarian bombing&quot; in an ironic manner to demonstrate their derision.

Some journalists have argued that the humanitarian situation worsened after the bombing campaign was launched, thereby questioning the stated objective as laid out by NATO. Writing for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Christopher Layne and Benjamin Schwartz opined on U.S. President Bill Clinton&#x27;s claim that the campaign stopped &quot;deliberate, systematic efforts at ..genocide&quot; by arguing that prior to the bombing the Yugoslav Army&#x27;s &quot;brutal operations&quot; were aimed at rooting out the Kosovo Liberation Army rather than expelling the Albanian population which only occurred afterwards, claiming that &quot;the U.S.-led NATO bombing precipitated the very humanitarian crisis the administration claimed it was intervening to stop&quot;. Alexander Cockburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;an alternative assessment was that NATO’s bombing was largely to blame for the expulsions and killings&quot; of Kosovars as prior to it the Yugoslav Army was &quot;behaving with the brutality typical of security forces&quot;. On the 10th anniversary of the bombing campaign, Ian Bancroft wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Though justified by apparently humanitarian considerations, NATO&#x27;s bombing of Serbia succeeded only in escalating the Kosovo crisis into a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe&quot;; citing a post-war report released by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe he concluded that it is &quot;widely acknowledged that the bulk of the ethnic cleansing and war crimes occurred after the start of [NATO]&#x27;s campaign&quot;.

==Legality of wartime conduct==
Noam Chomsky was also highly critical of the NATO campaign and its aerial bombing in particular, where public utilities were bombed in addition to military targets. Chomsky argued that the main objective of the NATO intervention was to integrate FR Yugoslavia into the Western neo-liberal social and economic system, claiming that it was the only country in the region which still defied the Western hegemony prior to 1999; this claim is disputed. He described bombing of the Radio Television of Serbia as an act of terrorism.

<doc id="174871" wikidata="Q561390" url="?curid=174871" title="Béla Fleck">
<text>Béla Anton Leoš Fleck (born July 10, 1958) is an American banjo player. An acclaimed virtuoso, he is an innovative and technically proficient pioneer and ambassador of the banjo, playing music from bluegrass, jazz, classical, rock and various world music genres. He is best known for his work with the bands New Grass Revival and Béla Fleck and the Flecktones. Fleck has won 17 Grammy Awards and been nominated 39 times.

In 2020, he was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame as a member of New Grass Revival.

==Early life and career==
A native of New York City, Fleck was named after the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók, the Austrian composer Anton Webern, and the Czech composer Leoš Janáček. He was drawn to the banjo at a young age when he heard Earl Scruggs play the theme song for &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; television show and when he heard &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot; by Eric Weissberg and Steve Mandell on the radio. At the age of 15, he received his first banjo, from his grandfather. During the train ride home, another man volunteered to tune the banjo and suggested he learn from the book &quot;How to Play the Five String Banjo&quot; by Pete Seeger. He attended High School of Music &amp; Art in New York City, playing French horn until he flunked and was transferred to the choir, though he spent most of his time on the banjo. He studied the book &quot;Bluegrass Banjo&quot; by Pete Wernick and took lessons from Erik Darling, Marc Horowitz, and Tony Trischka.

After graduating from high school, he moved to Boston and became a member of the bluegrass group Tasty Licks, with whom he recorded two albums. He released his debut solo album, &quot;Crossing the Tracks&quot; (1979), and it was chosen Best Overall Album by the readers of &quot;Frets&quot; magazine.

Fleck played on the streets of Boston with bassist Mark Schatz. Along with guitarist Glen Lawson and mandolinist Jimmy Gaudreau, they formed Spectrum in 1981. That same year, Sam Bush asked Fleck to join New Grass Revival, with whom Fleck would perform for nine years. In 1984, he played on the album &quot;Snakes Alive!&quot;, by the Dreadful Snakes (Rounder 0177), along with Jerry Douglas, Roland White and Blaine Sprouse. During this time, in 1987 Fleck recorded another solo album, &quot;Drive&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1988 for Best Bluegrass Album. During the 1980s Fleck and Bush also performed live with Doc and Merle Watson in bluegrass festivals, most notably the annual Telluride Bluegrass Festival. Bela also played with Jerry Garcia at the Hearst Greek Theatre, on August 5, 1990.

==Béla Fleck and the Flecktones==
In 1988, Fleck and Victor Wooten formed Béla Fleck and the Flecktones with keyboardist and harmonica player Howard Levy and Wooten&#x27;s brother, Roy &quot;Future Man&quot; Wooten, who played synthesizer-based percussion. They recorded numerous albums, most notably &quot;Flight of the Cosmic Hippo&quot;, their second album, which reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Contemporary Jazz Albums chart and found increased popularity among fans of jazz fusion.

Levy left the group in 1992, making the band a trio until saxophonist Jeff Coffin joined the group onstage in 1997. His first studio recording with the band was their 1998 album, &quot;Left of Cool&quot;. Coffin left the group in 2008 to replace the Dave Matthews Band&#x27;s saxophonist, the late LeRoi Moore. Levy returned to the Flecktones in 2009. Béla Fleck and the original Flecktones recorded &quot;Rocket Science&quot; and toured in 2011.

==Other music and recordings==

Fleck played banjo on &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; by the Dave Matthews Band, including the album&#x27;s debut single &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot;.

In 1989 Fleck was invited to join the supergroup Strength in Numbers, headed by Sam Bush on mandolin, with Jerry Douglas on resonator guitar (dobro), Edgar Meyer on bass, and Mark O&#x27;Connor on violin. The group recorded just one album, &quot;The Telluride Sessions&quot;, before Bush disbanded the group.

In 2001, he collaborated with Edgar Meyer on &quot;Perpetual Motion&quot;, an album of classical music played on the banjo. They were accompanied by John Williams, Evelyn Glennie, Joshua Bell, and Gary Hoffman. &quot;Perpetual Motion&quot; won Grammy Awards for Best Arrangement and Best Classical Crossover Album.

Fleck and Meyer composed a double concerto for banjo and bass and performed its debut with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra. They were commissioned by the Orchestra to compose a trio concerto, for which they invited Indian tabla player Zakir Hussain. The concerto debuted in Nashville in 2006 when it was recorded for the album &quot;The Melody of Rhythm&quot;. Fleck premiered the &quot;Concerto for Banjo&quot; in Nashville, Tennessee on September 22, 2011, performing it with the full Nashville Symphony Orchestra.

In 2005, while the Flecktones were on hiatus, Fleck undertook several new projects: recording with traditional African musicians; co-writing the documentary &quot;Bring it Home&quot; about the Flecktones; co-producing &quot;Song of the Traveling Daughter&quot;, the debut album by his wife, Abigail Washburn; forming the acoustic fusion supergroup Trio! with Jean-Luc Ponty and Stanley Clarke; and recording an album as a member of the Sparrow Quartet with Washburn, Ben Sollee, and Casey Driessen.

==Personal life==
 Fleck is married to banjo player Abigail Washburn. Washburn first met Fleck in Nashville at a square dance at which she was dancing and he was playing. Fleck produced Washburn&#x27;s first solo album. Fleck brought Washburn to the wedding of his half-brother – award-winning children&#x27;s television writer Sascha Paladino – in August 2007, and they played in a scratch band composed of wedding party members. In May 2009, the &quot;Bluegrass Intelligencer&quot; website satirized the upcoming &quot;strategic marriage&quot; of Washburn and Fleck, joking that the couple promised a &quot;male heir&quot; who will be the &quot;Holy Banjo Emperor.&quot;

Fleck and Washburn have two sons, born 2013 and 2018.

==Media appearances==
He appeared on the cover of the July/August 2013 issue of &quot;Making Music&quot; magazine.

==Festivals==
Alone and with the Flecktones, Fleck has appeared at the High Sierra Music Festival, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, Merlefest, Montreal International Jazz Festival, Toronto Jazz Festival, Newport Folk Festival, Delfest, Austin City Limits Music Festival, Shakori Hills, Bonnaroo, New Orleans Jazz Fest, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass and Rochester International Jazz Festival.

==Music documentary==
In the film &quot;Throw Down Your Heart&quot; (2008), a film crew follows Béla Fleck on his travels to Africa where he collaborates with some of the best musicians and researches the African origins of the banjo.

In a New York Times article about the film, Stephen Holden writes: &quot;At every stop on a journey that takes him from Uganda to Tanzania to Gambia and finally to Mali, Mr. Fleck plays and records with gifted local musicians. Early in the film, a Ugandan villager insists that the common perception of Africa as a continent ravaged by war and disease is &#x27;just a very small bit of what Africa is,&#x27; and &quot;Throw Down Your Heart&quot; sets out to prove him right.&quot;
