<text>Kool &amp; the Gang is an American R&amp;B, soul, and funk band formed in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1964. Its founding members include brothers Robert &quot;Kool&quot; Bell and Ronald Bell (also known as &quot;Khalis Bayyan&quot;), Dennis &quot;Dee Tee&quot; Thomas, Robert &quot;Spike&quot; Mickens, Charles Smith, George Brown, Woodrow &quot;Woody&quot; Sparrow, and Ricky Westfield. They have undergone numerous changes in personnel and have explored many musical styles throughout their history, including jazz, rhythm and blues, soul, funk, disco, rock, and pop music. The group changed their name several times. Settling on Kool &amp; the Gang, the group signed to De-Lite Records and released their debut album &quot;Kool and the Gang&quot; in 1969.

The band&#x27;s first mainstream success came with the release of their fourth album &quot;Wild and Peaceful&quot; (1973); it contained the US top-ten singles &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Swinging&quot;. The band entered a period of decline before they reached a second commercial peak between 1979 and 1986 following their partnership with Brazilian musician and producer Eumir Deodato and the addition of singer James &quot;J.T.&quot; Taylor to the line-up. Their most successful albums of the time include &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot; (1979), &quot;Celebrate!&quot; (1980), and &quot;Emergency&quot; (1984), the latter being their highest-selling album, with two million copies sold in the US. Their hit singles during the period include &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot; (1979), the US No. 1 &quot;Celebration&quot; (1980), &quot;Get Down on It&quot; (1981), &quot;Joanna&quot; (1983), &quot;Misled&quot; (1984), and &quot;Cherish&quot; (1985). The group has continued to perform worldwide, including as a supporting act for Van Halen in 2012 and their fiftieth-anniversary tour in 2014.

Kool &amp; the Gang have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, seven American Music Awards, and, in 2006, a Music Business Association Chairman&#x27;s Award for artistic achievement. The group has been inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame and been given a MOBO Award for Outstanding Achievement, the Soul Train Legend Award, the Marian Anderson Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2007, the group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. Throughout 2018, the Bells, Brown, and Taylor were also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2024.
Their discography includes 23 studio albums and nearly 70 singles. They have sold 7.5 million and 4.5 million Recording Industry Association of America-certified albums and singles, respectively, in the United States. Worldwide, they have sold over 70 million albums.

== History ==
=== 1964–1972: Formation and signing with De-Lite===
The band formed in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1964 when seven school friends decided to perform together as an instrumental jazz and soul group named the Jazziacs. Among them were Robert &quot;Kool&quot; Bell on bass, his brother Ronald Bell on keyboards, both from Youngstown, Ohio originally, Robert &quot;Spike&quot; Mickens on trumpet, Dennis &quot;Dee Tee&quot; Thomas on saxophone, Ricky West on keyboards, George Brown on drums, and Charles Smith on guitar. Except Smith, all of them attended Lincoln High School in Jersey City. Robert Bell had given himself the nickname &quot;Kool&quot; as a way of adapting to the street gangs in his neighborhood after moving from Ohio. The Bells&#x27; father Bobby and uncle Tommy were boxers. They moved to New York to train and lived in the same apartment building as Thelonious Monk, who became Robert&#x27;s godfather. Miles Davis would drop by because he wanted to be a boxer.

Their first gigs took place as the opening act to a weekly jazz night held in a local theatre every Sunday. They also played occasionally with McCoy Tyner, Pharoah Sanders, and Leon Thomas during their early years as a group. They then had several name changes, including &quot;the Soul Town Band&quot; and &quot;the New Dimensions&quot;. They played Motown covers as the backing musicians for Soul Town, a small Jersey City-based organization similar to Motown. In 1967, they became regular performers at the Blue Note Lounge in Jersey, where one of the emcees advertised them with a new name, Kool &amp; the Flames. However, since their manager, Gene Redd, advised against taking this name to avoid confusion with James Brown&#x27;s band, the Famous Flames, the band settled on Kool &amp; the Gang instead.

After selecting the new band name and line-up, Kool &amp; the Gang signed a recording deal with Redd&#x27;s new independent label, De-Lite Records. Redd wrote: &quot;I discovered these eight super talented incomparable young musicians, [...and...] I immediately realized that their potential would earn them success unknown by most musicians&quot;. The group entered the studio and recorded their debut album, the all-instrumental &quot;Kool and the Gang&quot; (1969), with Redd as a producer, arranger, conductor, and partial songwriter. It would be their only album with guitarist Woody Sparrow. The album peaked at No. 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. Around this time, the group began to develop their stage performance after they witnessed a set by Willie (Feaster) and the Mighty Magnificents which, according to Robert Bell, &quot;Blew us away[...] We thought, &#x27;Wow, if we want to be in show business, we have to change our act. We can&#x27;t just stand up there and play&#x27;.&quot; Also at this time, the group were asked to deliver songs with vocals. Despite Bell recalling the group sounding &quot;real ragged&quot; with lyrics at first, &quot;Bit by bit we gained in confidence... we kinda learnt how to sing as we went along.&quot;

The group followed their debut with two live albums: &quot;Live at the Sex Machine&quot;, recorded the year before, and &quot;Live at PJ&#x27;s&quot;, both released in 1971. These were their final albums before their amicable split with Redd. Their next album, &quot;Music Is the Message&quot;, was the first time the group self-produced one of their records. It was released in July 1972, and peaked at No. 25 on the R&amp;B chart. It was followed with &quot;Good Times&quot; in November, which featured the band backed by a string section. The elements of jazz, rock, and instrumental styles on the record made it difficult for reviewers to categorize the band by genre. Since the album failed to generate the radio exposure the group had hoped for, they began to explore how to build a following without relying on airplay.

=== 1973–1978: First commercial success and low period ===
By the spring of 1973, Kool &amp; the Gang was influenced by the growing disco music scene, driving it to create sound Robert Bell described as &quot;a much harder, funkier, tighter&quot; unit than before. He said band members mostly learned of disco culture from others, and didn&#x27;t frequent discotheques. 

With the change in musical direction came the band&#x27;s first major commercial success. Their fourth studio album, &quot;Wild and Peaceful&quot;, went to No. 33 on the album chart. The album was certified &quot;gold&quot; by RIAA for selling 500,000 copies. It also spawned the Top-40 single &quot;Funky Stuff&quot;. The album&#x27;s next two singles, &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Swinging&quot;, fared even better by entering the US top 10. This also marked the group&#x27;s breakthrough to a white audience. The latter two songs sold over one million copies and were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Their success continued with &quot;Light of Worlds&quot; (1974), which contained the hit instrumental &quot;Summer Madness&quot;. In October 1974, the group landed a spot on the national television music show &quot;Soul Train&quot;. In 1975 Kool &amp; the Gang added Larry Gittens from the Stylistics, and released &quot;Spirit of the Boogie&quot; which contained the top 40 single &quot;Spirit of the Boogie&quot;. That was followed by the part-studio part-live release &quot;Love &amp; Understanding&quot;, in 1976.

By mid-1976, however, Kool &amp; the Gang entered a period of commercial decline. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Geoff Himes wrote the fans &quot;frowned on their loose and greasy approach to dance music.&quot; Their three albums released during this time, &quot;Open Sesame&quot; (1976), &quot;The Force&quot; (1977), and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Dancin&#x27;&quot; (1978) failed to generate the same commercial or critical acclaim as their previous records. Bell later said the albums &quot;bent our style a bit, and we didn&#x27;t feel at home with it&quot;. &quot;The Force&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Dancin″&quot; displayed the group&#x27;s attempt to adopt disco elements with female vocalists and a string section, but Robert Bell later said the group got &quot;Too fancy and over-creative[...] We got away from the basic Kool &amp; the Gang sound[...] and the public didn&#x27;t like it&quot;. The change in style affected their ability to secure as many dates as before, working &quot;just off and on&quot; during this time. One review for &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Dancin″&quot; bore the headline, &quot;Kool and the Gang have gone bland.&quot; Writer Mike Duffy opined, &quot;They&#x27;ve joined the disco lemmings [...] The edge has gone. Say so long to the raw and raunchy.&quot;

During their low period, the group gained some mainstream attention with their contribution of &quot;Open Sesame&quot; to the soundtrack of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977). &quot;Summer Madness&quot; was also used in &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), but not released on its soundtrack album.

=== 1979–1988: J.T. Taylor, Deodato partnership, and commercial peak ===

By 1979, Kool &amp; the Gang changed musical direction in two distinct ways. After several years of consideration, and at the suggestion of promoter turned SOLAR Records founder Dick Griffey, they brought in a dedicated lead vocalist to become a focal point of their music. James &quot;J.T.&quot; Taylor from South Carolina was added; Taylor noted that vocals added more warmth to the songs, especially to ballads, which the group had previously avoided as no vocalist in the group could sing them properly. He recalled some resistance to his arrival from some group members and the female singers they had used on &quot;The Force&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Dancin″&quot;. The change in style developed further when the group entered a four-album association with Brazilian musician, songwriter, and arranger Eumir Deodato as their producer, who helped them move towards mainstream pop and dance-oriented music with greater emphasis on catchy hooks and chorus lines. The group&#x27;s first choice, Stevie Wonder, was too busy to work with them. Earl Toon Jr. was added to the group.

Kool &amp; the Gang&#x27;s first album with Deodato, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot;, was released in September 1979 and became their most successful album since their formation. This was helped by the hit singles &quot;Too Hot&quot; and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot;, which went to No. 5 and No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, respectively. In January 1980, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA for selling one million copies in the US. Later that year, &quot;Celebrate!&quot; became a bigger commercial success than &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot;; the lead single &quot;Celebration&quot; remains the band&#x27;s only single to reach No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. The song originated from the lyric &quot;Come on, let&#x27;s all celebrate&quot; from &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot;, which inspired Robert Bell to write &quot;an international anthem.&quot; The group developed the song on a tour bus after attending the American Music Awards. The song was used in national media coverage for the 1980 World Series, the 1981 Super Bowl, the 1981 NBA Finals, and the 1981 return of the Iran hostages.

After the release of &quot;Something Special&quot; (1981), which continued the level of success of the previous two albums, the band recorded their fourth and final album with Deodato, &quot;As One&quot; (1982). The latter struggled to reach gold certification in the US, which led to the band&#x27;s decision to end their time with Deodato as they had enough with the direction they had adopted. They then decided to produce their next album, &quot;In the Heart&quot; (1983), by themselves with Jim Bonnefond as co-producer. The album contained the US top-five single &quot;Joanna&quot;. The song was declared the most-played pop song in 1984 by Broadcast Music International. Bonnefond stayed with the group for &quot;Emergency&quot; (1984), which remains their highest selling album with over two million copies sold in the US. It spawned four US top 20 singles, including &quot;Emergency&quot;, &quot;Cherish&quot;, &quot;Fresh&quot;, and &quot;Misled&quot;. The feat made Kool &amp; the Gang the only group to have four top 20 singles from a single album in 1985.

In June 1984, Kool &amp; the Gang took time off from recording &quot;Emergency&quot; to perform at Wembley Stadium as part of a sold-out summer concert organised by Elton John. That November, during a visit to Phonogram&#x27;s offices in London, Bob Geldof arrived to pitch his idea of the multi-artist charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; to the label. Kool &amp; the Gang participated in the project. In 1985, Bell said the group retained control of their own business affairs, avoiding to hire management on a full-time basis and preferring to hire consultants and agents for each project or a single term.

The group&#x27;s seventeenth album, &quot;Forever&quot;, was released in November 1986. The album included two hit singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart: &quot;Victory&quot; (US #10, R&amp;B #2) and &quot;Stone Love&quot; (US #10, R&amp;B #4). Two further singles, &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Special Way&quot; were also released from the album; the former reached the top ten on the R&amp;B Chart, the latter hit reached No. 6 on the Adult Contemporary chart. By 1986, the group had scored 14 top 40 singles in the US since 1980, more than Michael Jackson. In July 1986, the group recorded a special version of &quot;Celebration&quot; with different vocals that was used in an advertisement for Wendy&#x27;s.

In 1987, the group completed a 50-city tour of the US. The tour included the group establishing their own public service program, devised by Robert Bell and Taylor, which encouraged school children to pursue education, giving free tickets to those with perfect attendance. The group rehearsed their stage show with a choreographer at Prince&#x27;s studio at Paisley Park. At the time of the tour&#x27;s start, the group ceased producing adverts with Schlitz beer because of their new image towards children and that they felt it had run its course. After the tour, Taylor left Kool &amp; the Gang to pursue a solo career. He returned in 1996 for their &quot;State of Affairs&quot; album.

=== 1988–present: Later career ===
In February 1988, news of Taylor&#x27;s departure from the group to pursue a solo career was reported in the press. The group had discussed pursuing solo projects during the previous year, with Thomas suggesting the band had considered splitting into twos or threes. Taylor was replaced by three vocalists: Sennie &quot;Skip&quot; Martin, Odeen Mays, and Gary Brown.

In 1989 the group&#x27;s 18th album &quot;Sweat&quot; was released. By that time Khalis Bayyan and Robert &quot;Spike&quot; Mickens also had departed the group. The album did not fare well. &quot;Unite&quot;, the group&#x27;s nineteenth studio album, was released in 1992. It marked the return of Khalis Bayyan to the group. In 1995, Taylor returned to the group for &quot;State of Affairs&quot; (1996), hailed as the group&#x27;s &quot;comeback&quot; album. All of the songs on the album were written by Khalis Bayyan and Taylor. Taylor left the group for the second time in 1999.

On their next studio album &quot;Gangland&quot; (2001), Kool &amp; the Gang pursued elements of hip hop. The album was a compilation of rappers backed by Kool and the Gang remaking some of the group&#x27;s songs. During 2003 the group was given a Mobo Award for Outstanding Achievement. In 2004 they released another album featuring remakes and some new songs. &quot;The Hits Reloaded&quot; contained collaborations with artists such as Atomic Kitten, Lisa Stansfield and Jamiroquai. The album reached No. 21 on the UK R&amp;B Albums chart. During 2007 the group released another album entitled &quot;Still Kool&quot;. The album reached No. 31 on the US Billboard Top Soul Albums chart. &quot;Still Kool&quot; has also been certified Platinum in France by the SNEP.

In 2012, Bell accepted Van Halen singer David Lee Roth&#x27;s invitation for Kool &amp; the Gang to be the opening act during their A Different Kind of Truth Tour as Roth had noticed a significant portion of their concert audience were women. Roth wanted the group after seeing their set at Glastonbury. In 2013 the group released a Christmas album &quot;Kool for the Holidays&quot;. That was the group&#x27;s 24th studio album.

In 2015, 50 years after formation, the group received their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. During that year they were also inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. 

Trombonist Clifford Alanza Adams Jr. died in January 2015 at the age of 62 after a year-long battle with cancer. Adams, who had been with Kool &amp; the Gang since 1977, had no health insurance to cover medical expenses.

In 2016, a Jersey City street was renamed the &quot;Kool and the Gang Way&quot;. During 2019, Kool and the Gang was also bestowed with the Marian Anderson Award. 

Saxophonist Ronald &quot;Khalis Bayyan&quot; Bell died suddenly in September 2020; the cause of death was not announced.

In 2021, the group released &quot;Perfect Union&quot;, their 25th studio album and first album of new material in 14 years. The album was produced by Khalis Bayyan before his 2020 death. 

Alto saxophonist Dennis &quot;D.T.&quot; Thomas died in his sleep on August 7, 2021, at the age of 70.

On November 20, 2022, the group performed a special live concert at the naming ceremony for the newly christened Carnival Celebration, notably performing “Celebration” as a nod to the newest addition to the Carnival fleet.

Drummer George “Funky” Brown died from lung cancer on November 16, 2023, at the age of 74.

Kool &amp; the Gang were selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2024. They were officially inducted by rapper Chuck D (of Public Enemy) at the ceremony in October. The band, backed by the Roots, reunited with former singer James &quot;JT&quot; Taylor at the induction ceremony and performed a medley of their hit songs including &quot;Get Down on it&quot;, &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Swinging&quot;, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot;, and &quot;Celebration&quot;

<text>Theta (, ) uppercase Θ or ; lowercase θ or ; &quot;thē̂ta&quot; ; Modern: &quot;thī́ta&quot; ) is the eighth letter of the Greek alphabet, derived from the Phoenician letter Teth 𐤈. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 9. 

==Greek==

In Ancient Greek, θ represented the aspirated voiceless dental plosive , but in Modern Greek it represents the voiceless dental fricative .

==Forms==
In its archaic form, θ was written as a cross within a circle (as in the Etruscan or ), and later, as a line or point in circle ( or ).
The cursive form was retained by Unicode as , separate from . (There is also .) For the purpose of writing Greek text, the two can be font variants of a single character, but are also used as distinct symbols in technical and mathematical contexts. Extensive lists of examples follow below at Mathematics and Science. is also common in biblical and theological usage e.g. instead of πρόθεσις (means placing in public or laying out a corpse).

==Latin==
In Latin script used for the Gaulish language, theta inspired the &quot;tau gallicum&quot; (Ꟈ ꟈ). The phonetic value of the &quot;tau gallicum&quot; is thought to have been . In addition, multiple modern languages written in Latin script use Latin theta.

==Cyrillic==
The early Cyrillic letter &quot;fita&quot; (Ѳ, ѳ) developed from θ. This letter existed in the Russian alphabet until the 1918 Russian orthography reform.

==International Phonetic Alphabet==
In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), represents the voiceless dental fricative, as in thick&quot; or thin&quot;. It does not represent the consonant in &quot;the&quot;, which is the voiced dental fricative counterpart, represented in the IPA by (cf. Eth). A similar-looking lower-case symbol, , which is called &quot;barred o&quot;, is the IPA symbol for the close-mid central rounded vowel.

==Mathematics and science==
===Lower case===
The lowercase letter θ is used as a symbol for:
*A plane angle in geometry
*Angle (bold) and angular separation in physics
*An unknown variable in trigonometry
*A special function of several complex variables θ.
*The first Chebyshev function in prime number theory
*The potential temperature in meteorology
*Dimensionless temperature in heat transport phenomena
*The score of a test taker in item response theory
*Theta Type Replication: a type of bacterial DNA replication specific to circular chromosomes
*Threshold value of an artificial neuron
*A Bayer designation letter applied to a star in a constellation; usually the eighth star so labelled but not necessarily the eighth-brightest as viewed from Earth
*The statistical parameter frequently used in writing the likelihood function
*The Watterson estimator for the population mutation rate in population genetics
*Indicates a minimum optimum integration level determined by the intersection of GG and LL schedules (The GG-LL schedules are tools used in analyzing the potential benefits of a country pegging their domestic currency to a foreign currency.)
*The reserve ratio of banks in economic models
*The ordinal collapsing function developed by Solomon Feferman
*The Heaviside step function
*In pharmacology, the fraction of ligand bound to a macromolecule based on the Hill Equation
*The angle of the incident beam during X-ray diffraction

===Upper case===
The uppercase letter Θ is used as a symbol for:
*Theta functions
*Dimension of temperature, by SI standard (in italics)
*An asymptotically tight bound in the analysis of algorithms (big O notation)
*A certain ordinal number in set theory
*Pentaquarks, exotic baryons in particle physics
*A brain signal frequency (beta, alpha, theta, delta) ranging from 4–8 Hz
*One of the variables known as &quot;Greeks&quot; in finance, representing time decay of options or the change in the intrinsic value of an option divided by the number of days until the option expires

==Symbolism==

In ancient times, Tau was used as a symbol for life or resurrection, whereas the eighth letter of the Greek alphabet (ninth in the archaic form anciently used for numeration), theta, was considered the symbol of death. A quotation attributed to the ancient Roman author Ennius (though possibly spuriously) said of it: &quot;oh, theta, a letter much unluckier than the others&quot;.

According to Porphyry of Tyros, the Egyptians used an X within a circle as a symbol of the soul; having a value of nine, it was used as a symbol for Ennead. Johannes Lydus says that the Egyptians used a symbol for Kosmos in the form of theta, with a fiery circle representing the world, and a snake spanning the middle representing &quot;Agathos Daimon&quot; (literally: &quot;good spirit&quot;).

===Abbreviation===

In classical Athens, it was used as an abbreviation for the Greek θάνατος (&quot;Thanatos&quot;, &quot;death&quot;) and as it vaguely resembles a human skull, theta was used as a warning symbol of death, in the same way that skull and crossbones are used in modern times. It survives on potsherds used by Athenians when voting for the death penalty. Petrus de Dacia in a document from 1291 relates the idea that theta was used to brand criminals as empty ciphers, and the branding rod was affixed to the crossbar spanning the circle. For this reason, the use of the number 9 was sometimes avoided where the connotation was felt to be unlucky—the mint marks of some Late Imperial Roman coins famously have the sum ΔΕ or ΕΔ (delta and epsilon, that is 4 and 5) substituted as a euphemism where a Θ (9) would otherwise be expected.

<text>A windsock (a wind cone or wind sleeve) is a conical textile tube that resembles a giant sock. It can be used as a basic indicator of wind speed and direction, or as decoration. Windsocks are typically used at airports to show the direction and strength of the wind to pilots, and at chemical plants where there is risk of gaseous leakage. They are also sometimes located alongside highways at windy locations.

At many airports, windsocks are externally or internally lit at night. Wind direction is opposite the direction in which the windsock is pointing. Wind speed is indicated by the windsock&#x27;s angle relative to the mounting polein low winds it droops; in high winds, it flies horizontally.

== History ==

Alternating stripes of high-visibility orange and white were initially used to help estimate wind speed, with each stripe adding 3 knots (5.6km/h; 3.5mph) to the estimated speed. However, some circular frame mountings cause windsocks to be held open at one end, indicating a velocity of 3 knots even when stripes are not present. A fully extended windsock suggests a wind speed of or greater.

==Standards==
Per FAA standards, a properly functioning windsock orients itself to a breeze of at least and fully extends in a wind of .

Per Transport Canada standards, a 15-knot wind fully extends the windsock; a wind raises it to 5° below the horizontal; and a wind raises it to 30° below the horizontal.

ICAO standards specify a truncated cone-shaped windsock at least long and in diameter at the large end. It should be readable from an altitude of and ideally be of a single colour. If it is necessary to use two colours, they should ideally be orange and white, arranged in five alternating bands, with the first and last darker in tone. In wind speeds of or more, they must indicate wind direction to within ±5°.

== Other related wind direction indicators ==

Wind tees and wind tetrahedrons are two other commonly used wind direction indicators in airports. Wind tees are shaped like an airplane so that they match with the heading of an aircraft ready to take off and land. Wind tetrahedrons always have their pointy ends pointing to the wind. Wind tees and tetrahedrons can swing freely and align themselves with the wind direction, but neither provides an indication wind speed, unlike a windsock. Since a wind tee or tetrahedron can also be manually set to align with the runway in use, a pilot should also look at the wind sock for wind information, if one is available.

<doc id="166763" wikidata="Q14394" url="?curid=166763" title="Zeta">
<text>Zeta (, ; uppercase Ζ, lowercase ζ; , , classical or &quot;zē̂ta&quot;; &quot;zíta&quot;) is the sixth letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 7. It was derived from the Phoenician letter zayin . Letters that arose from zeta include the Roman Z and Cyrillic З.

==Name==
Unlike the other Greek letters, this letter did not take its name from the Phoenician letter from which it was derived; it was given a new name on the pattern of beta, eta and theta.

The word &quot;zeta&quot; is the ancestor of &quot;zed&quot;, the name of the Latin letter Z in Commonwealth English. Swedish and many Romance languages (such as Italian and Spanish) do not distinguish between the Greek and Roman forms of the letter; &quot;zeta&quot; is used to refer to the Roman letter Z as well as the Greek letter.

==Uses==


===Letter ===
The letter ζ represents the voiced alveolar fricative in Modern Greek.

The sound represented by zeta in Greek before 400 BC is disputed. See Ancient Greek phonology and Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching.

Most handbooks agree on attributing to it the pronunciation (like &quot;Mazda&quot;), but some scholars believe that it was an affricate (like adze). The modern pronunciation was, in all likelihood, established in the Hellenistic age and may have already been a common practice in Classical Attic; for example, it could count as one or two consonants metrically in Attic drama.

==== Arguments for ====
# PIE *&quot;zd&quot; becomes ζ in Greek (e.g. *&quot;sísdō&quot; &gt; ). Contra: these words are rare and it is therefore more probable that *&quot;zd&quot; was absorbed by *&quot;dz&quot; (&lt; *&quot;dj&quot;, *&quot;gj&quot;, *&quot;j&quot;); further, a change from the cluster /zd/ to the affricate /dz/ is typologically more likely than the other way around (which would violate the sonority hierarchy).
# Without there would be an empty space between and in the Greek sound system (), and a voiced affricate would not have a voiceless correspondent. Contra: a) words with and are rare, and exceptions in phonological and (even more so) phonotactic patterns are in no way uncommon; b) there was in etc.; and c) there was in fact a voiceless correspondent in Archaic Greek ( &gt; Attic, Boeotian , Ionic, Doric ).
# Persian names with &quot;zd&quot; and &quot;z&quot; are transcribed with ζ and σ respectively in Classical Greek (e.g. &quot;Artavazda&quot; = ~ &quot;Zara(n)ka-&quot; = . Similarly, the Philistine city Ashdod was transcribed as .
# Some inscriptions have -ζ- written for a combination -ς + δ- resulting from separate words, e.g. θεοζοτος for θεος δοτος &quot;god-given&quot;.
# Some Attic inscriptions have -σζ- for -σδ- or -ζ-, which is thought to parallel -σστ- for -στ- and therefore to imply a pronunciation.
# ν disappears before ζ like before σ(σ), στ: e.g. * &gt; , * &gt; , * &gt; . Contra: ν may have disappeared before /dz/ if one accepts that it had the allophone in that position like /ts/ had the allophone : cf. Cretan ~ (Hinge).
# Verbs beginning with ζ have in the perfect reduplication like the verbs beginning with στ (e.g. = ). Contra: a) The most prominent example of a verb beginning with στ has in fact &lt; *&quot;se-&quot; in the perfect reduplication (); b) the words with /ts/ &gt; σ(σ) also have : Homer , Ion. .
# Alcman, Sappho, Alcaeus and Theocritus have σδ for Attic-Ionic ζ. Contra: The tradition would not have invented this special digraph for these poets if was the normal pronunciation in all Greek. Furthermore, this convention is not found in contemporary inscriptions, and the orthography of the manuscripts and papyri is Alexandrine rather than historical. Thus, indicates only a different pronunciation from Hellenistic Greek , i.e. either or .
# The grammarians Dionysius Thrax and Dionysius of Halicarnassus class ζ with the &quot;double&quot; () letters ψ, ξ and analyse it as σ + δ. Contra: The Roman grammarian Verrius Flaccus believed in the opposite sequence, δ + σ (in Velius Longus, &quot;De orthogr&quot;. 51), and Aristotle says that it was a matter of dispute (&quot;Metaph&quot;. 993a) (though Aristotle might as well be referring to a pronunciation). It is even possible that the letter sometimes and for some speakers varied in pronunciation depending upon word position, i.e., like the letter X in English, which is (usually) pronounced [z] initially but [gz] or [ks] elsewhere (cf. Xerxes).
# Some Attic transcriptions of Asia Minor toponyms (βυζζαντειον, αζζειον, etc.) show a -ζζ- for ζ; assuming that Attic value was , it may be an attempt to transcribe a dialectal pronunciation; the reverse cannot be ruled completely, but a -σδ- transcription would have been more likely in this case. This suggests that different dialects had different pronunciations. (For a similar example in the Slavic languages, cf. Serbo-Croatian &quot;(iz)među&quot;, Russian между, Polish &quot;między&quot;, and Czech &quot;mezi&quot;, &quot;between&quot;.)

==== Arguments for [dz] ====
# The Greek inscriptions almost never write ζ in words like or , so there must have been a difference between this sound and the sound of . Contra: a few inscriptions do seem to suggest that ζ was pronounced like σδ; furthermore, all words with written σδ are morphologically transparent, and written σδ may simply be echoing the morphology. (Note, for example, that we write &quot;ads&quot; where the morphology is transparent, and &quot;adze&quot; where it is not, even though the pronunciation is the same.)
# It seems improbable that Greek would invent a special symbol for the bisegmental combination , which could be represented by σδ without any problems. , on the other hand, would have the same sequence of plosive and sibilant as the double letters of the Ionic alphabet ψ and ξ , thereby avoiding a written plosive at the end of a syllable. Contra: the use of a special symbol for is no more or no less improbable than the use of ψ for and ξ for , or, for that matter, the later invention ϛ (stigma) for , which happens to be the voiceless counterpart of . Furthermore, it is not clear that ζ was pronounced when it was originally invented. Mycenean Greek had a special symbol to denote some sort of affricate or palatal consonant; ζ may have been invented for this sound, which later developed into . (For a parallel development, note that original palatal Proto-Slavic developed into in Old Church Slavonic, with similar developments having led to combinations such as зд and жд being quite common in Russian.)
# Boeotian, Elean, Laconian and Cretan &quot;δδ&quot; are more easily explained as a direct development from *&quot;dz&quot; than through an intermediary *&quot;zd&quot;. Contra: a) the sound development &quot;dz&quot; &gt; &quot;dd&quot; is improbable (Mendez Dosuna); b) ν has disappeared before ζ &gt; δδ in Laconian (Aristoph., &quot;Lys&quot;. 171, 990) and Boeotian (Sch. Lond. in Dion. Thrax 493), which suggests that these dialects have had a phase of metathesis (Teodorsson).
# Greek in South Italy has preserved until modern times. Contra: a) this may be a later development from or under the influence of Italian; b) even if it is derived from an ancient , it may be a dialectal pronunciation.
# Vulgar Latin inscriptions use the Greek letter Z for indigenous affricates (e.g. &quot;zeta&quot; = &quot;diaeta&quot;), and the Greek ζ is continued by a Romance affricate in the ending &gt; Italian. &quot;-eggiare&quot;, French &quot;-oyer&quot;. Italian, similarly, has consistently used Z for and (Lat. &quot;prandium&quot; &gt; It. &quot;pranzo&quot;, &quot;lunch&quot;). Contra: whether the pronunciation of was , or , &quot;di&quot; would probably still have been the closest native Latin sound; furthermore, the inscriptions are centuries later than the time for which is assumed.

==== Summary ====
* is attested only in the lyric poetry of the Greek isle of Lesbos and the city-state of Sparta during the Archaic Age and in Bucolic poetry from the Hellenistic Age. Most scholars would take this as an indication that the -pronunciation existed in the dialects of these authors.
* The transcriptions from Persian by Xenophon and testimony by grammarians support the pronunciation in Classical Attic.
* is attested from c. 350 BC in Attic inscriptions, and was the probable value in Koine.
* or may have existed in some other dialects in parallel.

===Numeral===
Zeta has the numerical value 7 rather than 6 because the letter digamma (ϝ, also called &#x27;stigma&#x27; as a Greek numeral) was originally in the sixth position in the alphabet.

===Mathematics and science ===
The uppercase zeta is not used, because it is normally identical to Latin Z. The lower case letter can be used to represent:
*The Riemann zeta function in mathematics
*The Hurwitz Zeta Function in mathematics
*The Weierstrass zeta-function
*The damping ratio of an oscillating system in engineering and physics
*The rotational quantity of angular jerk in physics
*The effective nuclear charge on an electron in quantum chemistry
*The electrokinetic potential in colloidal systems
*The lag angle in helicopter blade dynamics
*Relative vorticity in the atmosphere and ocean
*A number whose discrete values (eigenvalues) are the positive roots of transcendental equations, used in the series solutions for transient one-dimensional conduction equations
*The heat flux across or through a plane (industrial materials technology)
*In physical chemistry equilibrium computations (using lower case Zeta (ζ)), the extent of reaction
*The height of the surface of a fluid layer

ZETA (fusion reactor) (all uppercase) was an early fusion experiment.

<text>James William Buffett (December 25, 1946 – September 1, 2023) was an American singer-songwriter, author, and businessman. He was known for his tropical rock sound and persona, which often portrayed a lifestyle described as &quot;island escapism&quot; and promoted enjoying life and following passions. Buffett recorded many hit songs, including those known as &quot;The Big 8&quot;: &quot;Margaritaville&quot; (1977), which is ranked 234th on the Recording Industry Association of America&#x27;s list of &quot;Songs of the Century&quot;; &quot;Come Monday&quot; (1974); &quot;Fins&quot; (1979); &quot;Volcano&quot; (1979); &quot;A Pirate Looks at Forty&quot; (1974); &quot;Cheeseburger in Paradise&quot; (1978); &quot;Why Don&#x27;t We Get Drunk&quot; (1973); and &quot;Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes&quot; (1977). His other popular songs include &quot;Son of a Son of a Sailor&quot; (1978), &quot;One Particular Harbour&quot; (1983), and &quot;It&#x27;s Five O&#x27;Clock Somewhere&quot; with Alan Jackson (2003). Buffett formed the Coral Reefer Band in 1975.

Of the over 30 albums released by Buffett, eight are certified gold and nine are certified platinum or multi-platinum by the RIAA. In total, Buffett sold over 20 million certified records worldwide, placing him amongst the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists. In addition to two Grammy Award nominations, Buffett was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Musical Excellence category in 2024.

Buffett also parlayed the &quot;island escapism&quot; lifestyle of his music into several business ventures, including Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s Margaritaville restaurant chain, the now-defunct Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurant chain, and ventures in hotels, casinos, liquor, and retirement communities. With a net worth of $1 billion, Buffett was one of the world&#x27;s richest musicians and celebrities. He was also a bestselling author. His devoted fans are known as &quot;Parrotheads&quot;.

==Early life==
Buffett was born on December 25, 1946, in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and he spent part of his childhood in Mobile and Fairhope, Alabama. He was the son of Mary Lorraine (&quot;née&quot; Peets) (died September 25, 2003) and James Delaney Buffett, Jr. (died May 1, 2003), who worked for the United States Army Corps of Engineers. He has two younger sisters, Laurie (born 1948) and Lucy (born 1953).

As a child, Buffett was exposed to sailing: his grandfather, James Delaney Buffett, was a steamship captain from Newfoundland, and his father was a marine engineer and sailor—these experiences later influenced his music. Buffett was educated by Jesuits as a Catholic and served as an altar boy.

In 1961, after seeing a folk music ensemble perform in Biloxi, Mississippi, Buffett realized that he wanted to be a musician. His first performance was a month later at a hootenanny, where he played a Stella guitar.

Buffett attended St. Ignatius School, where he played the trombone in the school band at age 8 in the 1950s. Buffett graduated from McGill Institute in 1964.

Buffett enrolled at Auburn University and was taught how to play guitar by a Sigma Pi fraternity brother to &quot;garner attention from girls&quot;. Buffett failed out of Auburn after a year, in April 1966, &quot;unable to balance his newfound interests in music and girls with his college classes&quot;. In 1966, Buffett played acid rock in a band called the Upstairs Alliance that attempted to emulate the sound of Jefferson Airplane. He continued college at Pearl River Community College and the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history in 1969, where during his time there he also joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity. In college, Buffett worked in a shipyard as an electrician and welder. He avoided serving in the Vietnam War due to a college deferment and a failed physical exam.

==Music career==
After graduating in 1969, Buffett moved to New Orleans and often held street performances for tourists on Decatur Street and played for drunken crowds in the former Bayou Room nightclub on Bourbon Street. In 1970, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to further his country music career. Buffett did not have much luck with music jobs but found work as an editorial assistant for &quot;Billboard&quot;, where he was the first to report that the bluegrass duo Flatt and Scruggs had disbanded.

Buffett signed a two-album contract with Barnaby Records. He released his first album, the country-tinged folk rock record &quot;Down to Earth,&quot; in August 1970; it sold 324 copies. The masters of his second album, &quot;High Cumberland Jubilee&quot;, recorded in 1971 in Berry Hill, Tennessee, were allegedly lost by the label before the album was released, although they were found in 1976, once Buffett became popular.

In the fall of 1971, after an impromptu audition, Buffett was hired by the Exit/In, a Nashville club, as the opening act for recording artist Dianne Davidson. Unhappy with the business climate in Nashville and with his first marriage heading for divorce, Buffett took up an offer by fellow country singer Jerry Jeff Walker, whom he had met while working as a journalist in Nashville, for lodging in his house in Coconut Grove. In November 1971, they went to Key West on a busking expedition; Buffett liked it so much that he moved there in the spring of 1972. There, Buffett got involved in the literary scene, meeting writers Thomas McGuane (who married Buffett&#x27;s sister), Jim Harrison, Tom Corcoran, and Truman Capote; sex and drugs were plentiful. Buffett was hired by David Wolkowsky, playing for drinks at the Chart Room Bar in the Pier House Motel. There, Buffett met his second wife. From a connection he made there, Buffett was hired as the first mate on the yacht of industrialist Foster Talge, heir to The Rival Company, which became his day job.

In 1973, Buffett signed a recording contract with ABC/Dunhill Records, then run by Don Gant. After Jim Croce died in a plane crash in September 1973, Dunhill promoted Buffett as a replacement.

Buffett&#x27;s second release and his first release on ABC/Dunhill Records was &quot;A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean&quot;, recorded at Tompall Glaser&#x27;s Glaser Sound recording studio on Music Row and released in June 1973. The album featured the hit singles &quot;Grapefruit—Juicy Fruit&quot; and &quot;Why Don&#x27;t We Get Drunk&quot; as well as &quot;I Have Found Me a Home&quot;, written about his experiences in Key West. Buffett used the money he made from the album to buy his first boat.

&quot;Living &amp; Dying in 3/4 Time&quot;, recorded in October 1973 and released in February 1974, deviated from the island-theme of Buffett&#x27;s other albums. It included &quot;Come Monday&quot;, written for his then-girlfriend and future wife, his first single to place on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;A1A&quot;, released in December 1974, included &quot;A Pirate Looks at Forty&quot;, written about a drug smuggler.

In 1975, Buffett formed the Coral Reefer Band. He credits his future wife for cleaning up their look, replacing their ripped Levi jeans and collarless shirts. The band was the opening act for the Eagles in August 1975.
&quot;Havana Daydreamin&#x27;&quot;, produced by Don Gant, was released in January 1976. In January 1977, Buffett released &quot;Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes&quot;, which, in addition to the title track, featured his breakthrough hit song &quot;Margaritaville&quot;. Buffett claims that he wrote most of the song in six minutes. Ironically, while it attempts to negatively portray tourists in Key West, it led to an increase in tourism to the city. That year, Buffett sublet his apartment in Key West to Hunter S. Thompson.

Buffett first traveled to Saint Barthélemy in 1978 and moved there shortly thereafter, where he got the inspiration for songs and characters in his books.

In March 1978, Buffett released &quot;Son of a Son of a Sailor&quot;. In addition to the title track, it featured &quot;Cheeseburger in Paradise&quot;, which reached number 32 on the Hot 100. In August 1979, he released &quot;Volcano&quot;, which included &quot;Fins&quot; and the title track.
In 1983, Buffett filed and won a lawsuit against Chi-Chi&#x27;s for attempting to trademark &quot;Margaritaville&quot; as a drink special. In October 1985, he released the compilation album &quot;Songs You Know By Heart&quot;, which included all of the &quot;Big Eight&quot; songs and was his best selling album, selling over 7 million copies by 2005.

In 1994, Buffett dueted with Frank Sinatra on a cover of &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; on Sinatra&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;Duets II&quot;. In 1996, Buffett penned the song &quot;Jamaica Mistaica&quot; for his &quot;Banana Wind&quot; album based on a January 1996 incident in which Buffett&#x27;s Grumman HU-16 airplane named &quot;Hemisphere Dancer&quot; was shot at by Jamaican police, who believed the craft to be smuggling marijuana. The aircraft sustained minimal damage. The plane was carrying Buffett as well as Bono of U2, Bono&#x27;s wife and two children, Island Records producer Chris Blackwell, and co-pilot Bill Dindy. The Jamaican government acknowledged the mistake and apologized to Buffett.

In April 1998, Buffett released an album of songs from a musical theatre production he co-created based on Herman Wouk&#x27;s novel, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Carnival&quot;; was certified gold. After Frank Sinatra died the following month, he attended his funeral. Buffett&#x27;s song &quot;Math Suks&quot;, released in May 1999, was condemned by the U.S. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the National Education Association for its alleged negative effect on children&#x27;s education. Comedian Jon Stewart also jokingly criticized the song on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; during a segment called &quot;Math Is Quite Pleasant&quot;.

By 1999, Buffett had shifted to a more relaxed concert schedule of around 20–30 dates per year, with infrequent back-to-back nights, preferring to play only on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. This schedule provided the title of his 1999 live album.

In 2003, Buffett partnered in a partial duet with Alan Jackson for the song &quot;It&#x27;s Five O&#x27;Clock Somewhere&quot;, which spent a then record eight weeks atop the Hot Country Songs charts. This song won the 2003 Country Music Association Award for Vocal Event of the Year, Buffett&#x27;s first award in his 30-year recording career.

Buffett&#x27;s album &quot;License to Chill&quot;, released on July 13, 2004, sold 238,500 copies in its first week of release according to Nielsen Soundscan. With the album, Buffett topped the U.S. pop albums chart for the first time in his career.

In May 2005, Buffett signed an agreement with Sirius Satellite Radio to broadcast Radio Margaritaville, which, from its founding in 1998, was broadcast only online. The channel broadcasts from the Margaritaville Resort Orlando in Kissimmee, Florida.

In August 2006, Buffett released the album &quot;Take the Weather with You&quot;, which hit number 1 on the country chart. The album included &quot;Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On&quot;, written in honor of the survivors of Hurricane Katrina.

In August 2007, Buffett was nominated at the Country Music Association Awards for the Event of the Year Award for his song &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; which also features Alan Jackson and George Strait. Also in August 2007, Buffett received a star on the Mohegan Sun Walk of Fame.

In April 2010, a double CD of performances recorded during the 2008 and 2009 tours called &quot;Encores&quot; was released exclusively at Walmart, Walmart.com, and Margaritaville.com.

In 2010, Buffett was named the tenth biggest touring artist of the decade, with 4.5 million ticket sales over the previous 10 years.

Since Wyatt Durrette, co-writer of the song &quot;Knee Deep&quot;, was a fan of Buffett&#x27;s, Buffett partnered on the song with the Zac Brown Band, which was released on Brown&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;You Get What You Give&quot;. The single was certified platinum in September 2017.

In November 2011, Buffett voiced Huckleberry Finn on &quot;Mark Twain: Words &amp; Music&quot;, a benefit for the Mark Twain Boyhood Home &amp; Museum, which was released on Mailboat Records.

In August 2013, Buffett released &quot;Songs from St. Somewhere&quot;; many of the songs were recorded at Eden Rock, St Barths.

In 2020, Buffett released &quot;Songs You Don&#x27;t Know by Heart&quot;, a fan-curated collection of his lesser-known songs rerecorded on his collection of notable guitars.

Buffett performed his final full concert at Snapdragon Stadium in San Diego on May 6, 2023. He made two further concert appearances, as an unannounced guest at concerts by Coral Reefer Band members, in Amagansett, New York, on June 11 and in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, on July 2, his final live performance before his death.

&quot;Equal Strain on All Parts&quot; was released posthumously in November 2023. Buffett got the idea for the album title from his grandfather&#x27;s description of a nap.

Buffett was posthumously selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2024 in the musical excellence category.

===Musical style===

Buffett&#x27;s music combined country, rock, folk, calypso, and pop music with coastal as well as tropical lyrical themes for a sound sometimes called &quot;gulf and western,&quot; &quot;gulf rock,&quot; or tropical rock.

Buffett called his music &quot;drunken Caribbean rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;.

&quot;It&#x27;s pure escapism is all it is...I&#x27;m not the first one to do it, nor shall I probably be the last. But I think it&#x27;s really a part of the human condition that you&#x27;ve got to have some fun. You&#x27;ve got to get away from whatever you do to make a living or other parts of life that stress you out. I try to make it at least 50/50 fun to work and so far it&#x27;s worked out.&quot; -Jimmy Buffett

In 1989, a music critic in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Buffett&#x27;s music as a combination of &quot;tropical languor with country funkiness into what some [have] called the Key West sound, or Gulf-and-western.&quot; The name &quot;Gulf-and-western&quot; derives from elements in Buffett&#x27;s early music including musical influence from country, along with lyrical themes from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. It is a play on the form of &quot;Country &amp; Western&quot; and Gulf+Western is the former parent company of Paramount Pictures.

In 2020, The Associated Press described Buffett&#x27;s sound as a &quot;special Gulf Coast blend of country, pop, folk and rock, topped by Buffett&#x27;s swaying voice. Few can mix steelpans, trombones and pedal steel guitar so effortlessly.&quot;

===Musical legacy===
Musicians that have cited Buffett as a musical influence include Greg &quot;Fingers&quot; Taylor, a former member of Buffett&#x27;s Coral Reefer Band, as well as musicians that have &quot;latched on to his seaside-and-booze themes&quot; such as Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson, and Zac Brown.

===&quot;Parrot Head&quot; fans===
Parrot Head or parrothead is a commonly used nickname for Buffett fans, with &quot;parakeets&quot; or &quot;keets&quot; used for younger fans, or children of Parrotheads. At a 1985 Jimmy Buffett concert at the Timberwolf Amphitheater at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio, Buffett commented about everyone wearing Hawaiian shirts and parrot hats and how they kept coming back to see his shows, just like Deadheads. Timothy B. Schmit, then a member of the Coral Reefer Band, coined the term &quot;Parrot Head&quot; to describe them. In 1989, the first Parrothead club was founded in Atlanta. The annual Meeting of the Minds in Key West, Florida is a five-day festival held after Fantasy Fest that attracts approximately 5,000 Parrotheads. The Pikes Peak Hash House Harriers and Harriettes have an annual Parrot Head Hash weekend hosted by Yeastee Boy and Bread Box. Buffett&#x27;s fanbase is composed mostly of baby boomers. His concerts were known for tailgate parties and alcohol consumption.

==Writing==

Buffett wrote three books, all of which placed on The New York Times Best Seller list. &quot;Tales from Margaritaville&quot; and &quot;Where Is Joe Merchant?&quot; both spent over seven months on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller fiction list. His memoir &quot;A Pirate Looks at Fifty,&quot; published in 1998, went straight to number one on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller nonfiction list, making him one of the few authors to have reached number one on both the fiction and nonfiction lists.

Buffett also co-wrote two children&#x27;s books, &quot;The Jolly Mon&quot; and &quot;Trouble Dolls,&quot; with his eldest daughter, Savannah Buffett. The original hardcover release of &quot;The Jolly Mon&quot; included a cassette tape recording of the two reading the story accompanied by an original score written by Michael Utley.

Buffett&#x27;s novel &quot;A Salty Piece of Land&quot; was released on November 30, 2004, and the first edition of the book included a CD single of the song &quot;A Salty Piece of Land.&quot; The book was a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller soon after its release.

Buffett&#x27;s last title, &quot;Swine Not?&quot;, was released on May 13, 2008.

==Film and television==
===Soundtracks===
Buffett wrote the soundtrack for, co-produced, and played a role in, the 2006 film &quot;Hoot,&quot; directed by Wil Shriner and based on the book by Carl Hiaasen, which focused on issues important to Buffett, such as conservation. The film was not a critical or commercial success.

Among his other film music credits are the theme song to the short-lived 1993 CBS television series &quot;Johnny Bago&quot;; &quot;Turning Around&quot; for the 1985 film &quot;Summer Rental&quot; starring John Candy; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know (Spicoli&#x27;s Theme)&quot; for the 1982 film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;; &quot;Hello, Texas&quot; for the 1980 John Travolta film &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;; and &quot;If I&#x27;m Gonna Eat Somebody (It Might As Well Be You)&quot; for the animated film &quot;&quot;, which was sung in the film by rap artist Tone Loc.

===Cameo appearances===
Buffett made cameo appearances in &quot;Repo Man&quot;, &quot;Hook&quot;, &quot;Cobb&quot;, &quot;Hoot&quot;, &quot;Congo&quot;, and &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. He also made cameo appearances as himself in &quot;Rancho Deluxe&quot; (for which he also wrote the music) and in &quot;FM&quot;.

Buffett appeared on the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; special, &quot;Elmopalooza&quot;, singing &quot;Caribbean Amphibian&quot; with the popular Muppet, Kermit the Frog.

Buffett portrayed helicopter pilot Frank Bama in seven episodes of the 2010 reboot of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, in 2011, April 2013, March 2015, January 2017, March 2018, May 2019, and March 2020.

Buffett made a cameo in the 2015 film &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, where he is seen holding two margaritas while the dinosaurs are set loose in the park.

In 2017, Buffett was the musical guest on the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Rogue Nation&quot;, playing the song &quot;I Will Play for Gumbo&quot; in Dwayne Pride&#x27;s (Scott Bakula) newly rebuilt bar. His final TV appearance saw him busking the same tune on a New Orleans sidewalk to Beth (Amy Schumer) and her fiancée in the 2024 &quot;Life &amp; Beth&quot; episode &quot;Who Dat?&quot;

In 2019, Buffett had an extended cameo playing himself in the Harmony Korine film &quot;The Beach Bum&quot;.

Buffett portrayed both himself and a con artist by the name of Dickie Delaney, who pretended to be the famous singer in order to pull off schemes and trick unsuspecting marks on Season 12, Episode 11 of &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;.

==Theater==
In 1994, Buffett began developing a musical based on Herman Wouk&#x27;s 1965 novel, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Carnival&quot;. Buffett wrote the music and lyrics and Wouk wrote the book for the show. &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Carnival&quot; debuted in Miami, Florida, in 1997 to negative reviews from critics. The show ran only for six weeks in Miami.

&quot;Escape to Margaritaville&quot;, a musical, ran at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego from May 2017 to July 2017. The show then performed limited runs in New Orleans, Houston, and Chicago, and was well received by critics. The show features a book by Greg Garcia and Mike O&#x27;Malley and uses Buffett&#x27;s classic songs, some of which he rewrote the lyrics to in order to better fit in the context of the story. The show began previews at the Marquis Theatre on Broadway on February 16, 2018, and officially opened on March 15 under the direction of Tony winner Christopher Ashley. The Broadway production received mixed reviews from New York critics and closed on July 1 after 29 previews and 124 regular performances. A national tour launched in Providence, Rhode Island, in the fall of 2019.

==Business ventures==

Buffett took advantage of the tropical &quot;island escapism&quot; lifestyle that fans of his music sought by launching several business ventures to sell this lifestyle to his fans.

Through his Margaritaville brand, Buffett licensed hotels, casinos, cruise experiences, restaurants and bars, packaged foods, beverages, spirits, outdoor furniture, home goods, appliances, and apparel and accessories.

===Restaurants===
In 1984, Buffett and a friend opened a T-shirt shop in Gulf Shores, Alabama. After it failed, in 1985, they tried again in Key West, expanding it to what became Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s Margaritaville in 1987. The chain opened restaurants under the Margaritaville and LandShark Bar &amp; Grill names in locations including Atlantic City, New Orleans, Nashville, The Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, Las Vegas, Jamaica, Orlando, Baltimore, and the Cayman Islands. The Margaritaville cafe on the Las Vegas strip was possibly the highest grossing restaurant in the U.S.

Buffett previously owned the Cheeseburger in Paradise Restaurant chain, founded in 2002 in partnership with Bloomin&#x27; Brands; it was sold to Luby&#x27;s for $11 million in 2012 and shut down in 2020.

===Record labels===
In 1992, Buffett launched Margaritaville Records, with distribution through MCA Records. His MCA record deal ended in 1996. In 1999, he started Mailboat Records to release live albums.

===Beer===
Buffett sought and received a concert sponsorship from Corona; the partnership was credited for increasing sales of the brand. After deciding that he wanted his own beer brand, Buffett partnered with Anheuser-Busch in 2006 to brew Landshark Lager, now one of the Anheuser-Busch brands.

===Casinos===
In 2013, Buffett partnered with the Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to open the $35 million Jimmy Buffett Margaritaville-themed entertainment complex at the hotel, which included a Margaritaville Restaurant with a giant blender and tiki bar, a Landshark Bar and Grill, the 5 O&#x27;Clock Somewhere Bar, a coffee shop, a retail store, and a gaming area with 12 Margaritaville-themed table games and 160 slot machines.

The Margaritaville Casino and Restaurant in Biloxi, Mississippi, licensed the name from Buffett; it was in operation from May 2012 to September 2014. Plans to bring a Buffett-themed casino to Biloxi had been in process since 2000.

===Sports===
From May 8, 2009, through January 5, 2010, the home stadium of the Miami Dolphins, now called Hard Rock Stadium, was named LandShark Stadium pursuant to an eight-month naming rights deal. Buffett also wrote new lyrics for the team to his 1979 song &quot;Fins&quot;, which is played during Dolphins home games.

As a baseball fan, Buffett was part-owner of two minor-league teams: the Miami/Fort Myers Miracle (1989–2014) and the Madison Black Wolf (1996–2000).

===Video games===
In 2012, a &quot;Margaritaville Online&quot; game was released by THQ for Facebook. The game was discontinued two years later. In 2016, Buffett partnered with FunPlus to develop a new Margaritaville game.

===Retirement communities===
In 2017, Latitude Margaritaville, a 3,900-home $1 billion retirement village near Interstate 95 in Daytona Beach, Florida, was announced by Buffett in partnership with Minto Group. The partnership announced similar retirement communities on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, also in 2017 and in Panama City Beach, Florida, in 2021.

===Cannabis===
In September 2018, Buffett teamed with Wrigley Company heir William Wrigley Jr. II&#x27;s Surterra Holdings to license &quot;Coral Reefer&quot; brand marijuana; it launched in April 2019. The brand licensing ended in April 2023.

===Berkshire Hathaway===
In the 1980s, Buffett became friends with Warren Buffett and a shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway, increasing his stake over the years. They called each other &quot;Cousin Jimmy&quot; and &quot;Uncle Warren&quot; though they were not related.

==Charity work==
===Environmental conservation===
In 1981, the Save the Manatee Club, a 501(c)(3) organization, was founded by Buffett and former Florida governor Bob Graham. In 1986, Buffett began work to introduce the &quot;Save the Manatee&quot; license plate, featuring an image of a West Indian manatee, with proceeds going to the Save the Manatee Club. Buffett was also a major donor to the Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory.

In 1987, Buffett lobbied for the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.

===Charity performances===

Buffett enjoyed playing for U.S. troops; he played at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in 2002.

Buffett performed at several hurricane relief concerts including the Surviving the Storm hurricane relief concert in November 2004, which raised funds to support relief efforts for the four major hurricanes that year: Hurricane Charley, Hurricane Frances, Hurricane Ivan, and Hurricane Jeanne and a hurricane relief concert in November 2017 with Kenny Chesney and Toby Keith.

In January 2008, Buffett performed a concert in Hong Kong that raised funds for the Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club Charity Fund to support needy children.

On July 11, 2010, along with Jesse Winchester and Allen Toussaint, Buffett, a Gulf Coast native, performed a free concert for 35,000 people on the beach in Gulf Shores, Alabama to draw tourism to the area in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Buffett changed some of the lyrics of his songs to reference the environmental disaster.

===Disaster relief===
After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Buffett brought tents via his seaplane to donate to those that lost their homes.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, Buffett sent private planes to help ferry supplies and gave a benefit concert in Gustavia, Saint Barthélemy.

==Personal life==
Buffett married Margie Washichek in 1969; they divorced in 1972. Buffett met his second wife, Jane (née Slagsvol), then a student at the University of South Carolina, at the Chart Room bar while she was visiting Key West on spring break; she never returned to the university. They were married in 1977 in Aspen, Colorado. The Eagles, for whom Buffett was the opening act in 1975, played at their wedding. The couple had two daughters, radio personality Savannah Buffett (born 1979) and filmmaker Sarah Delaney (born 1992), and an adopted son, Cameron Marley (born 1994). They split in the early 1980s due to their partying lifestyle but reconciled in 1991 after she became sober.

Buffett resided in a waterfront estate in Sag Harbor, New York. In September 1998, he sold his properties in Key West for $900,000. In 2010, Buffett sold his house in Palm Beach, Florida, to Jon Stryker for $18.5 million; he had bought the house in 1994 for $4.4 million. At that time, he also owned a 2-unit property in the area, which he purchased in 2002 for $802,000. In 2013, Buffett purchased another house in Palm Beach, with 3,100 square feet, for $1.3 million. In April 2014, he bought a 4,322 square foot house in Beverly Hills, California for $8.25 million. In 2020, Buffett sold a 4,783-square-foot house in Palm Beach for $6.9 million; he paid $4.95 million for it in 2011. Buffett also owned a home in Saint Barthélemy, where he lived on and off in the early 1980s. There, Buffett was part owner of the Autour de Rocher hotel and restaurant. It burned down. He also owned an apartment in the Deutsche Bank Center in New York City.

Buffett was a devoted New Orleans Saints fan, having attended the team&#x27;s first game at Tulane Stadium in 1967. On April 1, 2012, he had Saints head coach Sean Payton serve as an honorary member of the Coral Reefer Band at a concert in New Orleans in protest of Payton&#x27;s suspension by the National Football League as a result of the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal.

Buffett was an avid pilot and owned a Dassault Falcon 900 jet that he often used while on concert tours and during his travels. At various points, he also owned a Boeing Stearman, Cessna Citation, Lake Amphibian, Pilatus PC-12, and Grumman Albatross. While attempting to take off on August 25, 1994, around 3:00 p.m. Eastern time, Buffett crashed his Grumman G-44 Widgeon into the waters off Nantucket, Massachusetts. The airplane nosed over, and Buffett was able to swim to safety, sustaining only minor injuries.

On February 4, 2001, Buffett was ejected from the American Airlines Arena (now the Kaseya Center) in Miami during a basketball game between the Miami Heat and the New York Knicks for cursing. The referee who ejected Buffett apparently did not know who he was, and got upset at Heat coach Pat Riley because he thought Riley—who was trying to explain to him who Buffett was—was insulting him by asking if he had ever been a &quot;Parrothead&quot;, the nickname for Buffett fans.

On October 6, 2006, Buffett was detained by French customs officials in Saint Tropez for allegedly carrying over 100 pills of ecstasy. Buffett&#x27;s luggage was searched after his Dassault Falcon 900 private jet landed at Toulon-Hyères International Airport. He paid a fine of $300 and was released. A spokesperson for Buffett stated the pills in question were prescription drugs but declined to name the drug or the health problem for which he was being treated. Buffett released a statement that the &quot;ecstasy&quot; was in fact a B-vitamin supplement known as Foltx.

At a performance by Buffett on January 26, 2011 (Australia Day) at Sydney&#x27;s Hordern Pavilion, he fell off the stage after an encore and lost consciousness. Coincidentally, Gordian Fulde, a trauma surgeon, was at the concert and close to the stage; Fulde treated Buffett at the scene. Buffett regained consciousness within a few minutes, and was then transported to St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital Emergency Centre for treatment and was discharged the next day. Buffett returned to Australia in 2012 for two shows in Brisbane and Melbourne, and made fun of the incident during those shows.

By 2017, Buffett&#x27;s diet did not include sugar or carbohydrates, except on Sundays, and he no longer smoked marijuana.
Buffett was a supporter of the Democratic Party. He sang in Florida for the Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign and again for Bill Clinton in the White House in August 2000. Buffett hosted fundraisers for Democratic politicians, including one for Obama in 2008, several for Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2018, Buffett hosted a concert to support Gwen Graham, daughter of Bob Graham, in the Democratic primary of the 2018 Florida gubernatorial election. In November 2018, he hosted a rally for Florida Democratic candidates Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson in West Palm Beach, Florida, changing the lyrics of some of his songs to disparage the policies of Rick Scott and Donald Trump. The rally faced some backlash from conservative fans.

Buffett was raised Catholic, although he did not practice the religion later in life.

===Illness and death===
In May 2023, Buffett was hospitalized to &quot;address some issues that needed immediate attention&quot; and rescheduled tour dates. In late August, he entered hospice care and had a final meeting with family and friends.

Buffett died on September 1, 2023, at age 76, at his home in Sag Harbor, New York, due to complications from Merkel-cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive skin cancer, with which he had been diagnosed four years earlier. Prior to his death, Buffett had kept his illness private and continued to tour while undergoing treatment.

President Joe Biden called Buffett a &quot;music icon&quot;. A tribute concert was held at the Hollywood Bowl in April 2024, featuring Paul McCartney, Eagles, Snoop Dogg, Harrison Ford, and Pitbull among others.

==Honors==
In 2015, Buffett spoke at the University of Miami&#x27;s graduation ceremony and received an honorary doctorate in music. Wearing aviator sunglasses, he told graduates, from a line in his song &quot;The Pascagoula Run&quot;, that &quot;it&#x27;s time to see the world, time to kiss a girl, and time to cross the wild meridian.&quot; Also in 2015, Buffett&#x27;s hometown of Pascagoula, Mississippi named a bridge after him in his honor, Buffett Bridge.

A species of crustacean discovered in 2023, &quot;Gnathia jimmybuffetti&quot;, was named after Buffett.

In 2024, the Florida legislature declared August 30 Jimmy Buffett Day, renamed State Road A1A as the Jimmy Buffett Memorial Highway, and issued a commemorative Florida and Margaritaville-themed license plate, to benefit Buffett&#x27;s charity SFC Charitable Foundation Inc., also known as Singing for Change.

The City of Hattiesburg unveiled their 57th mural in October 2024, titled &quot;Parrots in Paradise.&quot; The mural is on Hardy Street and was painted by Gulfport artist Lucinda L&#x27;Enfant.

 In 2024, Jimmy Buffett was entered into the 39th annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The honor was bestowed by musician James Taylor, who also sang Buffet&#x27;s 1974 hit &quot;Come Monday&quot; along with musician Kenny Chesney and Buffet&#x27;s long-time Coral Reefer Band member, Mac McAnally.

Beta has twice been used to name an Atlantic Basin tropical cyclone:
* Hurricane Beta, in 2005
* Tropical Storm Beta, in 2020

===Mathematics and science===

* Beta is often used to denote a variable in mathematics and physics, where it often has specific meanings for certain applications.
* β is sometimes used as a placeholder for an ordinal number if α is already used. For example, the two roots of a quadratic equation are typically labelled and .
* In regression analysis, symbolizes nonstandardized partial slope coefficients, whereas represents standardized (standard deviation-score form) coefficients; in both cases, the coefficients reflect the change in the criterion Y per one-unit change in the value of the associated predictor X.
* In spaceflight, beta angle describes the angle between the orbit plane of a spacecraft or other body and the vector from the sun.
* In physics β is used for a beta particle (an unbound energetic electron or positron).
* β is also used in biology, for instance in β-Carotene, a primary source of provitamin A, or the β cells in pancreatic islets, which produce insulin.
* The uppercase letter beta is not generally used as a symbol because it tends to be rendered identically to the uppercase Latin B.
* Dirichlet beta function

===Rock climbing terminology===
The term &quot;beta&quot; refers to advice on how to successfully complete a particular climbing route, boulder problem, or crux sequence.

=== Slang ===
&quot;Beta male&quot;, or simply &quot;beta&quot;, is a slang term for men derived from the designation for beta animals in ethology, along with its counterpart, &quot;alpha male.&quot; The term has been used as a pejorative self-identifier among members of manosphere communities, particularly incels, who do not believe they are assertive or traditionally masculine, and feel overlooked by women. It is also used to negatively describe other men who are not assertive, particularly in heterosexual relationships.

=== Statistics ===
In statistics, beta may represent type II error, or regression slope.

===Typography===
In some high-quality typesetting, especially in the French tradition, a typographic variant of the lowercase letter without a descender is used within a word for ancient Greek: is printed .

In typesetting technical literature, it is a commonly made mistake to use the German letter ß (a s–z or s–s ligature) as a replacement for β. The two letters resemble each other in some fonts, but they are unrelated.

===Videotape formats===
&quot;Beta&quot; can be used to refer to several consumer and professional videotape formats developed by Japan&#x27;s Sony Corporation. Although similarly named, they are very different in function and obsolescence.
* Betamax was the name of a domestic videotape format developed in the 1970s and 1980s. It competed with the Video Home System (VHS) format developed by the Japanese Victor Company, to which it eventually succumbed. The Betamax format was also marketed Betacord by (Sanyo); some cassettes were simply labeled &quot;Beta&quot;, and the logo was a lower-case beta. Betamax lost in the market and is an oft-used example of a technically superior solution that failed due to market forces.
* Betacam, including Beta SP and DigiBeta, is a family of professional videotape formats launched in 1982 that was the de facto standard for professional video, advertising, and television production through the 2000s. The formats outlasted analog NTSC television, and their scarcity today is because the industry has moved to HD formats.

<text>Brittany Anne Murphy-Monjack (; November 10, 1977 – December 20, 2009) was an American actress and singer, known for her work in both comedy and drama.

Born in Atlanta, Murphy moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to pursue a career in acting. Her breakthrough came when she co-starred as Tai Frasier in &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995), followed by independent films such as &quot;Freeway&quot; (1996), and her 1997 Broadway debut in a production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;. She finished the decade with supporting roles in &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; and &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; (both 1999). She voiced Luanne Platter on Fox&#x27;s &quot;King of the Hill&quot; for the entirety of its run (1997–2010).

Murphy gained critical recognition for her roles in numerous high-profile film projects during the early 2000s, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot; (2001), &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys&quot; (2001), and &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002). Other notable credits included &quot;Cherry Falls&quot; (2000), &quot;Spun&quot; (2002), &quot;Just Married&quot;, &quot;Uptown Girls&quot; (both 2003), &quot;Little Black Book&quot; (2004), &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), and &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006). 

On December 20, 2009, Murphy died at age 32 under disputed circumstances. The coroner&#x27;s verdict was pneumonia, exacerbated by anemia.

==Early life==
Brittany Anne Bertolotti was born at Georgia Baptist Hospital in Atlanta, to Sharon Kathleen Murphy and Angelo Joseph Bertolotti, who divorced when she was three years old. Murphy was raised by her mother in Edison, New Jersey. Angelo during this period was arrested on charges of drug possession, spending twelve years in prison; and he had dealings with the Italian mafia, where he operated as an entrepreneur and diplomat for organized crime families. She later stated that due to Sharon&#x27;s financial problems, she was forced to eat spaghetti every night. She also said that, on certain occasions, she had to beg her mother to buy clothes at Kmart. This would later explain Murphy&#x27;s marked social investment in homeless causes, as discussed in a February 2003 &quot;Glamour&quot; article. 

In 1991, before she started high school, the family moved to Los Angeles so that Murphy could pursue an acting career. Murphy said her mother never tried to stifle her creativity, and she considered her mother a crucial factor in her later success: &quot;When I asked my mom to move to California, she sold everything and moved out here for me. She always believed in me.&quot; Murphy&#x27;s mother is of Irish and Slovakian descent, and her father is of Italian descent. She was raised a Baptist and later became a non-denominational Christian. She had two older half-brothers and a younger half-sister.

== Acting career ==

===1990s: Child acting and first roles===
In 1982, she attended the Verne Fowler School of Dance and Theater Arts in Colonia, New Jersey. From the age of four, she trained in singing, dancing and acting until she moved to California at thirteen. In 1987, at the age of ten, she made her theatrical debut called &quot;Really Rosie&quot;, whose performance was praised by her teachers; and she also sang in a production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. She stood out for being energetic when acting. She went so far as to say that &quot;my first memories were wanting... to entertain people.&quot; She debuted in 1991 playing the role of Frank&#x27;s sister on the television show &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, however, she appeared in only one episode. She later got her first job in Hollywood at the age of thirteen, playing the role of Brenda Drexell in the series &quot;Drexell&#x27;s Class&quot;. She then went on to play Molly Morgan in the TV series &quot;Almost Home&quot;. She appeared as a guest star on several television series, including &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot;, &quot;Blossom&quot;, &quot;seaQuest 2032&quot;, &quot;Murder One&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;. She had recurring roles on &quot;Party of Five&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; and &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;.

Her breakthrough role was in her second feature film, the teen comedy &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995), directed by Amy Heckerling, which developed a cult following. Filming began in November 1994, at which time she was barely seventeen years old, making her the youngest member of the cast. Her performance in the film was praised by both the media and critics: John Menter, an acting teacher during Murphy&#x27;s childhood, said: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t until I saw her, sitting in the theater, who I felt she would be a huge star.&quot; During filming, as she could not attend high school, she had educational tutors. The film was a sleeper hit, grossing against its budget of . &quot;Clueless&quot; is a loose adaptation of the novel &quot;Emma&quot; (1815) by Jane Austen, and many of its characters have counterparts in the novel. Soon after, her mother Sharon was diagnosed with breast cancer, whom she was forced to take care of after the release of &quot;Clueless&quot;.

She made her Broadway debut in 1997 playing the role of Catherine, in a new version of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; along with actors Anthony LaPaglia and Allison Janney. She continued with roles in &quot;Freeway&quot; (1996), with Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland, and the independent comedy &quot;Bongwater&quot; (1998). In 1999, she appeared as Rivkah in the television film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Arithmetic&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by Jane Yolen and directed by Donna Deitch; filming took place in Lithuania and Canada in October 1998. Her performance was praised by &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer David Kronke, stating that she &quot;brought a strange but intriguing ethereal quality to her performance.&quot; That same year she had a supporting role in James Mangold&#x27;s &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, as a troubled psychiatric patient alongside Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie. She was nominated at the Young Artists Awards for Best Young Lead Actress in a Feature Film for &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, on March 19, 2000. She later starred as an aspiring beauty queen in &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot;. She voiced the character of Luanne Platter in the Fox animated sitcom &quot;King of the Hill&quot; for the entirety of the show from 1997 to 2009, and Joseph Gribble until the fifth season. She later said that she enjoyed doing voice-overs because they could be done at home, jokingly saying: &quot;You can do it even in your pajamas.&quot; She was nominated for an Annie Award for voice acting for the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode &quot;Movin&#x27; On Up&quot; in 2000.

===2000s: Acting success, decline and final works===

She began the 2000s playing certain roles, with Jody Marken in the thriller &quot;Cherry Falls&quot; (2000), and the lead role in &quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot; (2001) alongside Michael Douglas, whose critical reception was negative, but his performance was praised. In 2002, she played the role of Alex Latourno in the film based on the life of American rapper Eminem, &quot;8 Mile&quot;, which received critical acclaim, and was a success at the box office.

She appeared alongside Dakota Fanning in &quot;Uptown Girls&quot; (2003), playing Molly Gunn, a twenty-two-year-old girl whose deceased father was a musician. Filming lasted from July to September 2002, and was filmed at Silvercup Studios located in New York. That same year she starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Just Married&quot;. The film did well at the box office, grossing more than 100 million dollars, against a budget of 18 million, but it received negative reviews from both the press and film critics, which led to them appearing as nominees in the Razzie Awards for worst actor, worst supporting actress and worst on-screen couple for both. At that time her mother contracted breast cancer again, so she had to take care of her again. A year later she gave the Stacy Holt&#x27;s role in &quot;Little Black Book&quot; (2004), which was another critical failure, where reviewers focused on Murphy&#x27;s poor performance. The film opened at number five at the North American box office, grossing in its opening weekend behind &quot;Collateral&quot;, &quot;The Village&quot;, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; and &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;. The film finished its run with a domestic total of and an international addition of , totaling worldwide. In 2005 she appeared in &quot;Sin City&quot;, directed by Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino. Film critic Roger Ebert frequently praised Murphy&#x27;s acting talent and comic timing, giving good reviews to several of her films and comparing her to Lucille Ball:

Murphy followed with several independent films, including as &quot;Spun&quot; (2002), &quot;Neverwas&quot; (2005), and Karen Moncrieff&#x27;s &quot;The Dead Girl&quot; (2006), as well as two Edward Burns films: &quot;Sidewalks of New York&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Groomsmen&quot; (2006). She returned to voice acting with the critically acclaimed 2006 animated feature &quot;Happy Feet&quot;, as Gloria Penguin. In 2009, she was cast in the Lifetime TV movie &quot;Tribute&quot;, as the main character, Cilla. Murphy completed the thriller/drama &quot;Abandoned&quot; in June 2009 and it was released in 2010, after her death. In November 2009, Murphy left the production of &quot;The Caller&quot;, which was being filmed in Puerto Rico, and was replaced by Rachelle Lefevre. Murphy denied media reports that she had been fired from the project after being difficult on set, and cited &quot;creative differences&quot;. &quot;Something Wicked&quot;, her final film, was released in 2014.

== Music career ==
Murphy&#x27;s career also included work as a singer. She was able to learn to play an instrument in just twenty minutes of practice, and learned to play the piano and trumpet at an early age. Regarding her voice, she commented: &quot;My singing voice isn&#x27;t like my speaking voice...I&#x27;ve just always kept it a secret and never taken credit because I wanted to learn how to work behind the microphone in a recording studio, and some of the singers don&#x27;t even know it was me recording on their albums.&quot; In an interview she stated that her main musical influence was the American singer Madonna: &quot;My dreams and aspirations when I was a child for as long as I can remember was to be an entertainer. I started out in dance classes and I&#x27;ve always sang for as long as I can remember. When I was nine I started doing musical theater in the New Jersey area, where I&#x27;m from. The quickest way to entertain more people was to audition for commercials and that was the first thing available since it was right over the Hudson River. Madonna had a quote, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to change the world&#x27;–that was a huge inspiration to me so I decided I was going to be my own version of Madonna when I grew up&quot;. Plans to release a studio album were not carried out. She recorded unreleased demos that were never officially released, the song &quot;Boomlay&quot; was leaked on the Internet, it never completed and part of the recording was lost.

She was in a band called Blessed Soul with fellow actor Eric Balfour in the early 1990s. On June 6, 2006, Murphy and Paul Oakenfold released the single &quot;Faster Kill Pussycat&quot;, from the album &quot;A Lively Mind&quot;. The song became a club hit and hit number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart. It also hit number seven in Oakenfold&#x27;s native United Kingdom in June 2006.

She dabbled in music again with the release of the film &quot;Happy Feet&quot;, in which she covered Queen&#x27;s &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Wonderland&quot;. Murphy said about her character, Gloria, &quot;Oddly enough, of all the characters I&#x27;ve played, Gloria is the most like me. And she&#x27;s a penguin! George Miller always wanted one person to do both [the speaking and the singing]. I said, &#x27;I can sing,&#x27; and I asked him to give me a shot. I don&#x27;t think he took me very seriously, because most actors say they can do most things.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Relationships and friendships===
====Kutcher, Kwatinetz and Macaluso====

In late 2002, she began dating Ashton Kutcher, whom she met when they starred in &quot;Just Married&quot;. The director of the production, Shawn Levy, has commented on the relationship saying: &quot;From the minute they met, they were together, they laughed all the time, they made jokes and they looked happy&quot;. It was later revealed that they had been engaged, due to both Kutcher and Murphy wearing rings, although it was never officially confirmed. She was engaged to talent manager Jeff Kwatinetz, but their relationship only lasted four months. She was subsequently with Joe Macaluso in December 2005, a production assistant she met while working on the film &quot;Little Black Book&quot;. Four months after the filming of &quot;The Ramen Girl&quot;, which was in April 2006, they broke up.

====Winona Ryder====
In the early 2000s, she was close friends with American actress Winona Ryder, who worked with her in the drama film &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; (1999). For the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in September 2001, she was more open about her friendship with Ryder, where Murphy revealed that she called Ryder her &quot;definitive mentor&quot;. Murphy said, &quot;Before, I didn&#x27;t know how actors managed to look so pretty. They have stylists, hair and makeup. I look at old photos of the premiere of &quot;Clueless&quot; and I look like a meatball on top of another meatball&quot;. During a television interview, Murphy along with Ryder got into a Mercedes car and kissed mouth to mouth, which led theories that Murphy was a lesbian, something she rejected. For &quot;People&quot; she remarked: &quot;This was my presentation to the media, the cover of the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;&quot;. She also said that &quot;we just kissed as a joke. I didn&#x27;t know what to do because [the photographers] were in front of the car and it was either run them over or just stay there. Then I started making faces and suddenly I became Winona Ryder&#x27;s lesbian lover&quot;. After Murphy&#x27;s death, Ryder revealed to &quot;Total Film&quot; that she finds it difficult to watch the film after this event: &quot;I can&#x27;t watch the movie now. Her character commits suicide in the movie, I just can&#x27;t. I was very close to Brittany, even in the moments before her death&quot;.

====Eminem====
During the filming of &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002) she met the American rapper, singer-songwriter and actor Eminem. After the release of the film, rumors about a possible love relationship between the two of them spread. When she was asked on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; if they had dated, she responded: &quot;Yes, of course&quot; and, laughing, added: &quot;Well, it went. It came and went&quot;. Beyond speculation, it was later confirmed that the two had no relationship. In another interview with &quot;The Morning Call&quot;, she revealed that she was a big fan of Eminem: &quot;I&#x27;m a fan of him... I think that he&#x27;s very misunderstood.&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s brilliant...he&#x27;s a brilliant guy,&quot; she continued. When the interviewer asked if the rapper was nervous during recordings with her, she jokingly replied, &quot;You&#x27;d have to ask him. I don&#x27;t want to appear in some song or something like that. I&#x27;m being careful.&quot; On another occasion, when asked if they had &quot;something off screen,&quot; she responded: &quot;I&#x27;ll never tell.&quot;

Eminem later revealed on &quot;Vibe&quot; that the actress&#x27; death affected him greatly and that he was terrified of dying under similar circumstances. He also said that Murphy&#x27;s death &quot;was crazy. It&#x27;s crazy because for a while we were close and she was a very good person. It&#x27;s crazy when you see these cases, not just hers, but all the cases that have happened in Hollywood with people in music, in acting. Famous people. Famous people dying of overdoses at alarming rates and this almost sounds like advertising.&quot;

====Simon Monjack====
Months after her relationship with Macaluso, she met Simon Monjack, a British screenwriter. They met during the filming of &quot;The White Hotel&quot;, where Murphy played the role of actress and Monjack as director, however, the film was not released and its production was paused. In the 2021 documentary &quot;What Happened, Brittany Murphy?,&quot; several of Monjack&#x27;s colleagues and friends accused him of being responsible for Murphy&#x27;s physical changes and also of not letting her connect with her family. According to the testimony of his ex-fiancée, Elizabeth Ragsdale, Monjack &quot;was a disturbed individual who was used to scamming people and Brittany was one of his last victims&quot;. In the two-part miniseries, Ragsdale explained that Monjack told her that he suffered from spinal cancer and needed shark cartilage treatments to recover. It was not until he abandoned her while Ragsdale was pregnant that she contacted Monjack&#x27;s mother, Linda Monjack, and realized that the story was fake. Linda, who was interviewed, defended her son in this regard, saying he had developed extreme paranoia after the death of his own father, William Monjack, from cancer: &quot;I certainly don&#x27;t think he went out and told people he had cancer. I think he believed it.&quot; Before Monjack met Murphy, he was with filmmaker Allison Burnett at a public dinner, where he told the assembled guests that he was a multimillionaire, had dated Elle Macpherson and Madonna, had a collection of Ferraris and was dying of brain cancer until he purchased a treatment derived from shark fins that saved his life; however, these theories were revealed to be lies. As a result of this the media suspected that she had been deceived by a cheat. Actress Kathy Najimy, recalled: &quot;[People] were scared. Like, &#x27;Who is this guy and what was happening?&#x27;&quot;, &quot;She wanted to marry him, and I said, &#x27;Honey, it hasn&#x27;t been enough&#x27;.&quot; Another reporter said that her friends and family tried to split her with Monjack at one point, but her intervention failed. After that it was as if she &quot;disappeared&quot;, according to her friend Lisa Rieffel: &quot;Simon took her away. He made sure no one could get to her.&quot; The couple did not announce their engagement beforehand and rarely appeared together in public before their marriage. In May 2007 they married in a private Jewish ceremony in Los Angeles in May 2007. During the last three and a half years of her life, she, her mother, and Monjack moved in together in the same mansion that Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake had lived in, and she kept much of her old furniture.

===Health===
In the early 2000s, Murphy lost a large amount of weight, which led to rumors of a cocaine addiction or that she suffered from bulimia or anorexia. In 2005, Murphy disputed such claims to &quot;Jane&quot; magazine, saying: &quot;No, just for the record I have never tried it in my entire life.&quot; 

She appeared to smoke both in movies and in the making-ofs in which she appeared. A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist remarked that &quot;she smelled of vanilla and apricots. She had a cigarette in her hand. ... After a while, she pointed out that this was only her third cigarette of the week and that, consequently, &#x27;I don&#x27;t smoke, and I&#x27;m not smoking!&#x27; But you are smoking. &#x27;Oh, now&#x27;, she said, as if only a dullard could think otherwise. ... even though she doesn&#x27;t smoke and wasn&#x27;t smoking, she lit her fourth cigarette of the week and began smoking it avidly, passing time in the bathroom until it was yummy time for her again.&quot; She had tried to quit her addiction and was against the use of marijuana, appearing in a fifteen-minute anti-smoking campaign for young people about not smoking to more than 10,000 schools as a complement to the educational program &quot;Right Decisions, Right Now&quot;. She was also against the consumption of both marijuana and drugs. At the same time, she suffered from type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Actress Melanie Lynskey, one of her friends, expressed her opinion about Murphy&#x27;s physical changes. For &quot;InStyle&quot;, she stated: &quot;I was friends with Brittany Murphy, and the way she saw herself always broke my heart: the things she felt she had to change to be a successful actress.&quot; &quot;She was perfect as she was, but people tried to present her as &#x27;the fat one,&#x27; because when she was a very young teenager, her cheeks were a little round. People tell you that you are a particular thing, and it is very difficult to combat.&quot; The problem of her weight loss was such that she became weaker, unable to stand up on her own. The film director Trista Jordan recalled: &quot;I&#x27;ve been around thousands of actors and I&#x27;ve never seen anyone that thin. Her elbows... And to get up from a chair she looked like Bambi.&quot;

==Death==
At 8:00 a.m. on December 20, 2009, the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to &quot;a medical request&quot; at the Los Angeles home Murphy and Monjack shared. She had apparently collapsed in a bathroom. Firefighters attempted to resuscitate Murphy on the scene. She was transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she died at 10:05 a.m. after going into cardiac arrest.

An autopsy was performed the day after she died. The Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office, in a report issued February 2010, said that the manner of death was accidental and that the cause of death was pneumonia, with secondary factors of severe iron-deficiency anemia and multiple drug intoxication. The coroner found a range of over-the-counter and prescription medications in Murphy&#x27;s system, with the most likely reason being to treat a cold or respiratory infection. These included &quot;elevated levels&quot; of hydrocodone, which is a narcotic; acetaminophen, L-methamphetamine, and chlorpheniramine. Hydrocodone requires a prescription while the others are over the counter. The report observed: &quot;the possible adverse physiological effects of elevated levels of these medications cannot be discounted, especially in her weakened state.&quot;

On December 24, 2009, Murphy was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.

In January 2010, Murphy&#x27;s husband, Simon Monjack, and her mother, Sharon Murphy, claimed that she did not use alcohol or other drugs, and that drugs did not cause her death; instead, they attributed it to a heart condition, mitral valve prolapse.

On May 23, 2010, Monjack was found dead at the same Hollywood Hills residence. The coroner&#x27;s report attributed his death to acute pneumonia and severe anemia. It was reported that the Los Angeles County Department of Health had considered toxic mold in their house as a possible cause of the deaths, but this was dismissed by Los Angeles Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter, who stated that there were &quot;no indicators&quot; that mold was a factor. Sharon Murphy described the reports of mold contributing to the deaths as &quot;absurd&quot; and went on to state that inspecting the home for mold was never requested by the Health Department. In December 2011, Sharon Murphy changed her stance, announcing that toxic mold was indeed what killed her daughter and son-in-law, and filed a lawsuit against the attorneys who represented her in an earlier suit against the builders of the home where her daughter and son-in-law died.

In January 2012, Murphy&#x27;s father, Angelo Bertolotti, applied to the Superior Court of California requesting that the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office be required to hand over samples of his daughter&#x27;s hair for independent testing. The suit was dismissed seven months later, after Bertolotti failed to attend two separate hearings.

In November 2013, Bertolotti claimed that a toxicology report showed that deliberate poisoning by heavy metals, including antimony and barium, was a possible cause of his daughter&#x27;s death. Sharon Murphy described the claim as &quot;a smear&quot;.

===Brittany Murphy Foundation===
In January 2010, Murphy&#x27;s mother, Sharon, and her widower, Simon Monjack, established the Brittany Murphy Foundation, a charitable fund for children&#x27;s arts education, as well as supporting the USO and cancer research.

The Foundation was launched on February 4, 2010, at a fundraising event at the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills. After a records search revealed that the foundation&#x27;s not-for-profit status had not been filed, the foundation refunded the donations received. In an official letter on the foundation&#x27;s website, they stated that in an effort to get the foundation set up as quickly as possible, they had established it as a private foundation with plans to apply for nonprofit status later. However, they said that they had decided to wait until the foundation&#x27;s nonprofit status was approved before going any further in order to truly honor Murphy and the foundation&#x27;s charitable goals.

On November 10, 2013, the Brittany Murphy Foundation was officially relaunched by her father Angelo Bertolotti, according to a press release posted at the foundation&#x27;s website.

 the Brittany Murphy Foundation appears to be defunct. GuideStar USA, Inc., an information service specializing in reporting on US nonprofit companies, reports that the Brittany Murphy Foundation has not appeared on the IRS Business Master File in months, which may indicate that it has ceased operations.

==Legacy==
Adam White, for &quot;Dazed Digital&quot; on November 15, 2017, stated that &quot;the actress was small, but magnetic, with the rare ability to seem completely approachable and terrifying. She had a big, bawdy laugh and acted with a manic mood mixed with breathless disbelief that things had turned out so well.&quot; He went on to claim that &quot;she was the equivalent of dancing in your room to a Spice Girls song, or crying out loud at the end of a party after too many drinks&quot;, but that &quot;she died too young to establish an adequate legacy, and quietly for posthumous super stardom.&quot; He again declared that &quot;she was not pretty enough to be a female protagonist in an era in which lithe and ethereal Gwyneth Paltrow and Kirsten Dunst were the It girls of the moment.&quot;

After her death, a wide variety of friends dedicated words to her in interviews, recognizing her legacy and work within the film industry. Dakota Fanning, her co-star in the film &quot;Uptown Girls&quot; (2003) who maintained a friendship with her, said she appreciated the time they spent together both on the set of the film and at events they attended together, and that she was &quot;very grateful to have had the opportunity to work together&quot;. The song &quot;Faster Kill Pussycat&quot;, by British DJ Paul Oakenfold performed by Murphy, re-entered at number seven on the UK Dance Chart. It also entered the UK Indie Chart in the same week, peaking at number 13.

In October 2021, HBO Max aired a documentary titled &quot;What Happened, Brittany Murphy?&quot;, covering the mystery surrounding Murphy&#x27;s death. In the documentary, Murphy&#x27;s &quot;8 Mile&quot; co-star Taryn Manning remembered her as &quot;free-spirited, whimsical and full of laughter&quot;. After the documentary premiere, Daniel Fienberg wrote for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that the documentary was &quot;20 percent a reminder of Murphy&#x27;s transcendent talent, 30 percent a dead-ended investigation into the mystery of her death, and 50 percent an unenlightening examination of Murphy&#x27;s late husband&quot;, and concluded his review saying that &quot;[Murphy] deserved better than the treatment she received in the media, which probably contributed to [Monjack&#x27;s] ability to control her in the way he did.&quot;

In 2023, Alicia Silverstone, who was also her co-star in &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995) and one of her friends, commented on what it was like working with Murphy during filming:

<text>Jack in the Box, Inc. is an American fast food restaurant chain founded on February 21, 1951, by Robert O. Peterson in San Diego, California, where it is headquartered. The chain has over 2,200 locations, primarily serving the West Coast of the United States. Restaurants are also found in large urban areas outside the West Coast, as well as two in Guam. The company also formerly operated the Qdoba Mexican Grill chain until Apollo Global Management bought the chain in December 2017.

Food items include a variety of chicken tenders and french fries along with hamburger and cheeseburger sandwiches and selections of internationally themed foods such as tacos and egg rolls.

==History==

Robert O. Peterson already owned several successful restaurants when he opened Topsy&#x27;s Drive-In at 6270 El Cajon Boulevard in San Diego in 1941. Several more Topsy&#x27;s were opened. By the late 1940s, Peterson&#x27;s locations had developed a circus-like décor featuring drawings of a starry-eyed clown.
In 1947, Peterson obtained rights for the intercom ordering concept from George Manos who owned one location named Chatterbox in Anchorage, Alaska, the first known location to use the intercom concept for drive-up windows.
In 1951, Peterson converted the El Cajon Boulevard location into Jack in the Box, a hamburger stand focused on drive-through service. While the drive-through concept was not new, Jack in the Box innovated a two-way intercom system, the first major chain to use an intercom and the first to focus on drive-through.

The intercom allowed much faster service than a traditional drive-up window; while one customer was being served at the window, a second and even a third customer&#x27;s order could be taken and prepared. A giant clown projected from the roof, and a smaller clown head sat atop the intercom, where a sign said, &quot;Pull forward, Jack will speak to you.&quot; The Jack in the Box restaurant was conceived as a &quot;modern food machine,&quot; designed by La Jolla, California, master architect Russell Forester. Quick service made the new location very popular, and soon all of Oscar&#x27;s locations were redesigned with intercoms and rechristened Jack in the Box restaurants.

Peterson formed Foodmaker, Inc. as a holding company for Jack in the Box in 1960. At this time, all Jack in the Box locations—over 180, mainly in California and the Southwest—were company-owned. Location sites, food preparation, quality control, and the hiring and training of on-site managers and staff in each location were subject to rigorous screening and strict performance standards.

In 1968, Peterson sold Foodmaker to Ralston Purina Company. In the 1970s, Foodmaker led the Jack in the Box chain toward its most prolific growth (television commercials in the early 1970s featured child actor Rodney Allen Rippy) and began to franchise locations. The chain began to increasingly resemble its larger competitors, particularly industry giant McDonald&#x27;s. Jack in the Box began to struggle in the latter part of the decade; its expansion into East Coast markets was cut back, then halted. By the end of the decade, Jack in the Box restaurants were sold in increasing numbers.

Around 1980, Foodmaker dramatically altered Jack in the Box&#x27;s marketing strategy by literally blowing up the chain&#x27;s symbol, the jack-in-the-box, in television commercials with the tagline, &quot;The food is better at the Box&quot;. Jack in the Box announced that it would no longer compete for McDonald&#x27;s target customer base of families with young children. Instead, Foodmaker targeted older, more affluent &quot;yuppie&quot; customers with a higher-quality, more upscale menu and a series of whimsical television commercials featuring Dan Gilvezan, who attempted to compare the new menu items to those of McDonald&#x27;s and other fast-food chains, to no avail; hence &quot;There&#x27;s No Comparison&quot;, their slogan at the time. Jack in the Box restaurants were remodeled and redecorated with decorator pastel colors and hanging plants; the logo, containing a clown&#x27;s head in a red box with the company name in red text to or below the box (signs in front of the restaurant displayed the clown&#x27;s head only), was modified, stacking the words in a red diagonal box while still retaining the clown&#x27;s head; by about 1981 or 1982, the clown&#x27;s head was removed from the logo.

Television advertising from about 1985 onward featured minimalistic music by a small chamber-like ensemble (specifically a distinctive seven-note plucked musical signature). The menu, previously focused on hamburgers led by the flagship Jumbo Jack, became much more diverse, including salads, chicken sandwiches, finger foods, and seasoned Curly Fries (at least two new menu items were introduced per year), at a time when few fast-food operations offered more than standard hamburgers. Annual sales increased through the 1980s. Ralston Purina tried further to mature the restaurant&#x27;s image, renaming it &quot;Monterey Jack&#x27;s&quot; in late 1985. The name change was poorly received, and the Jack in the Box name was restored in early 1986.

After 18 years, Ralston Purina decided in 1985 that Foodmaker was a noncore asset and sold it to management. By 1987, sales reached $655 million, the chain boasted 897 restaurants, and Foodmaker became a publicly traded company.

At their annual meeting in July 2018, the National Jack in the Box Franchisee Association, which represented the owners of about 2,000 of the chain&#x27;s 2,240 restaurants, voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in the company&#x27;s chief executive officer, Leonard &quot;Lenny&quot; Comma, and called for him to resign. In December 2019, Comma said he would be stepping down.

On December 6, 2021, Jack in the Box announced that it was acquiring Del Taco for $12.51 per share. Del Taco had about 600 locations in 16 U.S. states. The acquisition was finalized in March 2022.

=== JBX Grill ===
JBX Grill was a line of fast casual restaurants introduced in 2004 by Jack in the Box Inc. They featured high-quality, cafe-style food, avoiding most of the cheaper fast-food items typically served at Jack in the Box. The architecture and decor maintained an upbeat, positive atmosphere, and the customer service was comparable to most dine-in restaurants. Two of the Jack in the Box restaurants in San Diego (where Jack in the Box is headquartered) were converted to JBX Grill restaurants to test the concept. (The locations in Hillcrest and Pacific Beach still retain many of the JBX elements, including an indoor/outdoor fireplace and modern architecture.) Also, restaurants were located in Bakersfield, California; Boise, Idaho; and Nampa, Idaho, but the concept later proved unsuccessful, and the last stores were reconverted to Jack in the Box in 2006.

== Products ==

Although best known for its hamburgers, Jack in the Box&#x27;s most popular product is its taco, which it has sold since the first restaurant in the 1950s. , the company sold 554 million a year manufactured in three factories in Texas and Kansas. What makes the taco unusual is that it is created with the meat and hard taco shell in the Texas and Kansas facilities, then frozen for transport and storage. At the restaurant, it is then deep-fried, then prepared with lettuce, cheese, and mild taco sauce before serving.

Besides tacos, other Americanized foods from ethnic cuisines that Jack in the Box offers include egg rolls, breakfast burritos, and jalapeño poppers. New items come in on a rotation every three to four months, including the Philly cheesesteak and the deli style pannidos (deli trio, ham and turkey, zesty turkey), which were replaced by Jack&#x27;s ciabatta burger and included the original ciabatta burger and the bacon &#x27;n&#x27; cheese ciabatta. Jack in the Box also carries seasonal items such as pumpkin pie shakes, Oreo mint shakes, and eggnog shakes during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. In some locations, local delicacies are a regular part of the menu. Locations in Hawaii, for example, include the Paniolo breakfast (Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice platter) and teriyaki chicken and rice bowl. In the Southern United States, the company offers biscuits and sweet tea. In Imperial County, California, some locations sell date shakes, reflecting the crop&#x27;s ubiquity in the region&#x27;s farms. In the spring of 2007, Jack in the Box also introduced its sirloin burger and followed this up recently with the sirloin steak melt. Its more recent foray into the deli market was the less-popular Ultimate Club Sandwich, which was initially removed in Arizona due to poor sales and has since been phased out at all locations.

The Bonus Jack, first released in 1970, has been reintroduced to Jack in the Box menus at times throughout the years, still containing &quot;Jack&#x27;s secret sauce&quot;. In November 2009, the company discontinued its popular ciabatta sandwiches/burgers. In 2012, Jack in the Box introduced a bacon milkshake as part of its &quot;Marry Bacon&quot; campaign.

The Sourdough Jack, which uses two slices of sourdough bread with a hamburger patty, has been around since 1997 (although it was first introduced in 1991 as the &quot;Sourdough Grilled Burger&quot;).

In September 2013, Jack&#x27;s Munchie Meal was introduced. The 4 original Munchie Meals were Spicy Nacho Chicken Sandwich, Sriracha Curly Fry Burger, Stacked Grilled Cheeseburger, and Chick-n-Tater Melt. Each meal also contains two tacos, halfsie fries (curly fries and french fries), and a 20 oz. drink. In 2023, the items were replaced with a new Build Your Own Munchie Meal which now include an Ultimate Cheeseburger, Jack&#x27;s Spicy Chicken Sandwich, Cluck Sandwich, and a Double Jack.

In October 2016, the &quot;Brunchfast&quot; items were introduced. Those are Bacon and Egg Chicken Sandwich, Blood Orange Fruit Cooler, Brunch Burger, Cranberry Orange Muffins, Homestyle Potatoes, and Southwest Scrambler Plate.

In January 2018, the &quot;Food Truck Series&quot; sandwiches were introduced, including the Asian Fried Chicken, Pork Belly BLT, and Prime Rib Cheesesteak.

In January 2023, Jack in the Box started selling Red Bull Infusions drinks at its locations.

In February 2023, Jack in the Box partnered with Mint Mobile and Ryan Reynolds. A minty version of the classic Oreo Shake was created and titled the &quot;Mint Mobile Shake&quot; to promote the mobile virtual network operator. A 15-second promotion video was featured on February 27, 2023, with Ryan Reynolds as the spokesperson.

The chain at various times has served a fish sandwich. The offering was returned for a limited time during the Lenten season in 2023.

==Advertising==

The restaurant rebounded in popularity in 1994 after a highly successful marketing campaign that featured the fictitious Jack in the Box chairman Jack character (formerly voiced by the campaign&#x27;s creator Rick Sittig), the mascot who has a ping pong ball-like head, a yellow clown cap, two blue eyes, a pointy black nose, and a linear red smile that changes with his emotions, and is dressed in a business suit.

Jack was reintroduced specifically to signal the new direction the company was taking to refocus and regroup after the 1993&quot; E. coli&quot; disaster, discussed below, which threatened the chain&#x27;s very existence. In the original spot that debuted in fall 1994, Jack (&quot;through the miracle of plastic surgery&quot;, he says as he confidently strides into the office building) reclaims his rightful role as founder and CEO, and apparently as revenge for being blown up in 1980, approaches the closed doors of the Jack in the Box boardroom (a fictionalized version, shown while the aforementioned minimalist theme music from the 1980s Jack in the Box commercials plays), activates a detonation device, and the boardroom explodes in a shower of smoke, wood, and paper. The spot ends with a close-up shot of a small, white, paper bag, presumably filled with Jack in the Box food, dropping forcefully onto a table; the bag is printed with the words &quot;Jack&#x27;s Back&quot; in bold red print, then another bag drops down with the Jack in the Box logo from that period. Later ads feature the first bag showing the text of the food item or offer the commercial is promoting (both bags have featured text since 1998). The Spanish ads feature an unknown voice shouting &quot;Jack!&quot; before another bag drops down.

The commercials in the &quot;Jack&#x27;s Back&quot; campaign (which has won several advertising industry awards) tend to be lightly humorous and often involve Jack making business decisions about the restaurant chain&#x27;s food products, or out in the field getting ideas for new menu items. While a series of ads claiming to ask when Burger King and McDonald&#x27;s will change their ways about making their hamburgers featured a phone number, the caller used to be a recording of Jack himself (as of 2019, the number is a sex hotline). In addition, many commercials have advertised free car antenna balls with every meal, thus increasing brand awareness. Often, different types of antenna balls were available during a holiday or major event or themed toward a sports team local to the restaurant. The antenna balls have since been discontinued due to the demise of the mast-type car antenna.


During the height of the now-defunct XFL, one of the continuing ad series involved a fictitious professional American football team owned by Jack. The team, called the Carnivores, played against teams such as the Tofu Eaters and the Vegans.

In 1997, a successful advertising campaign was launched using a fictional musical group called the Spicy Crispy Girls (a take-off of the Spice Girls, a British pop music girl group - at the time one of the most popular groups in the world), in comedic national television commercials. The commercials were used to promote the new Jack in the Box Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich (now known as Jack&#x27;s Spicy Chicken), with the girls dancing in &quot;the Jack groove.&quot; The Spicy Crispy Girls concept was used as a model for another successful advertising campaign called the &#x27;Meaty Cheesy Boys&#x27; to promote the Ultimate Cheeseburger in 1999-2001 (see below).
At the 1998 Association of Independent Commercial Producers (AICP) Show, one of the Spicy Crispy Girls commercials won the top award for humor.

The Meaty Cheesy Boys, a mock boy band to promote the Ultimate Cheeseburger, were created in 1999 during an ad campaign featuring an out-of-control advertising executive previously fired by Jack. The boy band would eventually perform their hit &quot;Ultimate Cheeseburger&quot; at the 1999 Billboard Music Awards. The same ad exec featured in a 2001 spot where a medical doctor made exaggerated claims of the benefits of fast food that it would cure baldness, help trim extra pounds, and remove wrinkles. Jack asks the ad exec incredulously, &quot;Where did you find this guy?&quot; The ad exec responds proudly, &quot;Tobacco company.&quot;

In 2000, an ad involved a man washed up on a remote island with only a Jack in the Box antenna ball as a companion. Later that year, director Robert Zemeckis, claiming the agency had appropriated elements of his Oscar-nominated film &quot;Cast Away&quot; for the ad, had his lawsuit against the ad agency thrown out.

In April 2006, Jack in the Box launched an ad campaign called Bread is Back, taking a stab at the low-carbohydrate diets of recent years.

In 2006, Jack in the Box took the use of this perception creating a commercial featuring a typical stoner who is indecisive about ordering. When faced with a decision, the Jack in the Box figurine in his car tells him to &quot;stick to the classics&quot; and order 30 tacos, implying that he has the &quot;munchies&quot;. This ad later stirred up controversy among a San Diego teen group who claimed that the ad was irresponsible showing a teenager who was under the influence of drugs. To protest, they presented the company with 2000 postcards protesting the ad, despite the fact that it had not aired since the beginning of the previous month. This commercial was redone in 2009 to feature the new logo and the new campaign.

Another ad touting the chain&#x27;s milkshakes aired in 2001 and was shot in the stilted style of a 1970s-era antidrug spot, urging kids to &quot;say no to fake shakes&quot; and featured &quot;Larry the Crime Donkey,&quot; a parody of McGruff the Crime Dog.

In 2007, Jack in the Box began a commercial campaign for their new 100% sirloin beef hamburgers, implying that they were of higher quality than the Angus beef used by Carl&#x27;s Jr., Hardee&#x27;s, Wendy&#x27;s, and Burger King. That May, CKE Restaurants, Inc., the parent company of Carl&#x27;s Jr. and Hardee&#x27;s, filed a lawsuit against Jack in the Box, Inc. CKE claimed, among other things, that the commercials tried to give the impression that Carl&#x27;s Jr./Hardee&#x27;s Angus beef hamburgers contained cow anuses by having an actor swirl his finger in the air in a circle while saying &quot;Angus&quot; in one commercial and having other people in the second commercial laugh when the word &quot;Angus&quot; was mentioned. They also attacked Jack in the Box&#x27;s claim that sirloin, a cut found on all cattle, was of higher quality than Angus beef, which is a breed of cattle.

=== Logo ===
One variation has a miniature clown hat (dating back to October 1977) with three dots in the upper left-hand corner; the clown head was removed in 1980. In October 1977, the clown head was in a red box all by itself, with the company name either below or next to the box; signs in front of the restaurants had the clown head only. The &quot;clown head&quot; can be seen on several YouTube videos depicting Jack in the Box commercials from the 1970s and 1980s. Most Jack in the Box locations opened before late 2008 had this logo, although the chain has been replacing them with the newer logo throughout the 2010s, along with general updating of their decor. Some locations continue to use this logo as their &quot;Open/Closed&quot; sign.

==Controversies==
===Mislabeled meat===
In 1981, horse meat labeled as beef was discovered at a Foodmaker plant that supplied hamburger and taco meat to Jack in the Box. The meat was originally from Profreeze of Australia, and during their checks on location, the food inspectors discovered other shipments destined for the United States which included kangaroo meat.

===1992–1993 &quot;E. coli&quot; scare and outbreak===

In 1993, Jack in the Box suffered a major corporate crisis involving &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7 bacteria. Four children died of HUS. Another 600 were reported sick after eating undercooked patties contaminated with fecal material containing the bacteria at a location in Tacoma, Washington, and other parts of the Pacific Northwest.
The chain was faced with several lawsuits, each of which was quickly settled (but left the chain nearly bankrupt and losing customers). At the time, Washington state law required that hamburgers be cooked to an internal temperature of at least , the temperature necessary to kill &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria, although the FDA requirement at that time was only , which was the temperature Jack in the Box cooked. After the incident, Jack in the Box mandated that in all nationwide locations, their hamburgers be cooked to at least .

== Locations ==

In 2005, Jack in the Box announced plans for nationwide expansion by 2010. In support of this objective, the chain began airing ads in states several hundred miles from the nearest location. The expansion strategy at that time was targeted at Colorado, Delaware, Florida, and Texas. In 2007, the first new Colorado store opened in Golden, marking an end to Jack in the Box&#x27;s 11-year-long absence from the state.

In Albuquerque, New Mexico, several locations opened in June 2009. Jack in the Box restaurants last made an appearance in the Albuquerque market about two decades prior.

In September 2010, 40 under-performing company-owned Jack in the Box restaurants located mostly in Texas and the Southeast were set to close.

In March 2011, Jack in the Box launched the Munchie Mobile in San Diego, a food truck that will serve Jack&#x27;s burgers and fries. In June 2012, Jack in the Box launched their second food truck in the southeast region of the United States. Another truck was launched for the Northern Texas area in April 2013.

In January 2012, Jack in the Box opened its first of three locations in the Indianapolis area. A few months later, the first Ohio location opened in September 2012 in West Chester.

In May 2023, Jack in the Box showed interest in re-entering the Mexican market after a failed first attempt, when it briefly operated there in the early 1990s. In February 2024, Jack in the Box returned to Mexico, opening a location in Chihuahua City.

In July 2024, Jack in the Box announced plans to open several stores in the Chicago area in 2025. The chain previously expanded in Chicago during the late 1960s until the 1980s.

==Sponsorship==

In November 2017, Jack in the Box became a sponsor of the Dallas Fuel and Team Envy, a team in the Overwatch League and a professional video game-playing team respectively.

They are also the current sponsor for the San Francisco 49ers. Certain locations (mainly in the San Francisco Bay Area) have a deal where if the 49ers score two touchdowns, customers can purchase a large drink and get a free Jumbo Jack with it the day after the game; the Los Angeles Dodgers have a similar deal in the L.A. metro area and in the Inland Empire if they can strike 10 opposing batters out. The Arizona Diamondbacks have a similar deal to the Dodgers, but in metro Phoenix, where if any Diamondbacks player hits a home run, customers can get the free Jumbo Jack with the large drink purchase.

<doc id="166781" wikidata="Q336924" url="?curid=166781" title="Ol' Dirty Bastard">
<text>Russell Tyrone Jones (November 15, 1968 – November 13, 2004), professionally known as Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard (often abbreviated as ODB), was an American rapper. He was one of the founding members of the New York rap group Wu-Tang Clan, which formed in 1992. Jones also released music as a solo artist beginning with &quot;Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version&quot; (1995). He was noted for his &quot;outrageously profane, free-associative rhymes delivered in a distinctive half-rapped, half-sung style&quot;. 

His professional success was hampered by frequent legal troubles, including incarceration. He died on November 13, 2004, of an accidental drug overdose, at age 35. He is the father of rapper Young Dirty Bastard.

==Biography==

===Early life, formation of the Wu-Tang Clan===
Russell Tyrone Jones was born on November 15, 1968, in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, New York City. He and his cousins Robert Diggs and Gary Grice shared a taste for rap music and martial arts-style movies. Jones, Diggs, and Grice (later known as Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard, RZA, and GZA respectively) formed the group Force of the Imperial Master, which became known as All in Together Now after their successful underground single of the same name. They eventually added six more members to their group, calling it the Wu-Tang Clan. The group released their debut album &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; in 1993, receiving notable commercial and critical success.

His stage name was derived from the 1980 Chinese martial arts film &quot;Ol&#x27; Dirty and the Bastard&quot; (also called &quot;An Old Kung Fu Master&quot;, starring Yuen Siu-tien). According to fellow Wu-Tang Clan member Method Man, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s name was also a reference to the unique nature of his rapping and, specifically, the fact &quot;there ain&#x27;t no father to his style.&quot;

===Music career===
Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s solo career began March 28, 1995, at the age of 26. His first solo album, &quot;Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version&quot;, spawned the hit singles &quot;Brooklyn Zoo&quot; and &quot;Shimmy Shimmy Ya&quot;, which helped propel the album to platinum status. The album&#x27;s sound was noted by several music writers as being as &quot;raw and gritty&quot; as &quot;36 Chambers&quot;, with RZA and 4th Disciple producing beats of an even more minimalist and stripped-down style than on the group&#x27;s debut album. In this same year, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard collaborated with Mariah Carey for the remix version of her single &quot;Fantasy&quot;.

It was around this time that Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard gained notoriety when, as he was being profiled for an MTV biography, he took two of his three children by limousine to a New York State welfare office to cash a $375 welfare check and receive food stamps while his latest album was still in the top 10 of the U.S. charts. The entire incident was filmed by an MTV camera crew and was broadcast nationwide. Although he had recently received a $45,000 cash advance for his first solo album and was earning a cut of the profits from the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s debut album, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard was still listed as eligible for welfare and food stamps due to the fact that he had not yet filed his taxes for the current year. His caseworker revoked his eligibility after seeing the MTV segment, and the incident was presented by critics of welfare as representative of the allegedly widespread abuse and fraud that led to the significant welfare reforms enacted in 1996.

In 1997, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard appeared on the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s second and most commercially successful work, the double album &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot;. He had fewer appearances on this album than the group&#x27;s debut, contributing to one solo track (&quot;Dog Shit&quot;), three verses (&quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;Reunited&quot;, &quot;Heaterz&quot;), one hook (&quot;As High as Wu-Tang Get&quot;), and a spoken introduction/refrain (&quot;Triumph&quot;).

In February 1998, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard witnessed a car accident from the window of his Brooklyn recording studio. He and a friend ran to the accident scene and organized about a dozen onlookers, who assisted in lifting the 1996 Ford Mustang—rescuing a 4-year-old girl from the wreckage. She was taken to a hospital with first and second-degree burns. Using a false name, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard visited the girl in the hospital frequently until he was spotted by members of the media.
The evening following the traffic accident, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard rushed on-stage unexpectedly as Shawn Colvin took the stage to give her acceptance speech for Song of the Year at the 1998 Grammy Awards, and he announced he had recently purchased expensive clothes in anticipation of winning the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album that he lost to Puff Daddy. As Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard took the stage to a round of applause, he asked the audience, &quot;Please calm down, the music and everything. It&#x27;s nice that I went and bought me an outfit today that costed a lot of money today, you know what I mean? &#x27;Cause I figured that Wu-Tang was gonna win. I don&#x27;t know how you all see it, but when it comes to the children, Wu-Tang is for the children. We teach the children. You know what I mean? Puffy is good, but Wu-Tang is the best. Okay? I want you all to know that this is ODB, and I love you all. Peace!&quot; The incident was widely covered in the media. The morning after the Grammy Awards, he appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, to discuss the incident.

In 1999, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard wrote and recorded his second studio album, &quot;Nigga Please&quot;, between jail sentences. The album received notable commercial success, although it failed to parallel the critical praise of his debut. This release included the single &quot;Got Your Money&quot;, which garnered worldwide chart success. The song was produced by The Neptunes and featured chorus vocals by R&amp;B singer Kelis.

In 1999, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard was paid $30,000 to appear on Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;The Amazing Jeckel Brothers&quot;. Completing his track in two days, his recording consisted of his &quot;rambling about bitches&quot;. Insane Clown Posse re-recorded the track and re-edited Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s vocals in order to form four rhymes out of his rambling, titling the song &quot;Bitches&quot;.

In 2001, with Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard again in jail for crack cocaine possession, his record label Elektra Records made the decision to release a greatest hits album (despite there being only two albums in his back catalog) in order to both end their contract with the artist (see below section), and to profit from the publicity generated by his legal troubles. After the contract with Elektra was terminated, the label D-3 Records released the album &quot;The Trials and Tribulations of Russell Jones&quot; in 2002, composed of tracks compiled without Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s input.

In 2003, the day he was released from prison, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard signed a contract with Roc-A-Fella Records. Living at his mother&#x27;s home under house arrest and with a court-ordered probation, he used his criminal record to title his VH1 special, &quot;Inside Out: Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard on Parole&quot;. He also managed to record his third album &quot;A Son Unique&quot;, which was originally scheduled to be released through Dame Dash Music Group in 2004; as of 2020, however, the album has never been released in physical form. In October 2004, one month before his death, his last collaboration was with Jon B. on the track &quot;Everytime&quot; from the album, &quot;Stronger Everyday&quot;. In 2005, five months after his death, he appeared posthumously on the song &quot;Blah-Blah-Blah&quot; by Brooke Valentine on her debut and only album, &quot;Chain Letter&quot;.

On July 17, 2004, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard had his second to last live performance at the Rock the Bells hip-hop festival in San Bernardino, California, with the rest of the Wu-Tang Clan.

On July 18, 2004, his final live performance was at the Gathering of the Juggalos in Garrettsville, Ohio.

In August 2017 in an interview on Hot 97, Wu-Tang Clan member RZA confirmed that the new Wu-Tang album, &quot;The Saga Continues&quot;, will contain unreleased vocals by Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard.

To celebrate Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s birthday, &quot;Intoxicated&quot; from the unreleased album &quot;A Son Unique&quot; was released as a single on November 15, 2018.

==Legal issues==
In 1993, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard was convicted of second-degree assault for an attempted robbery and in 1994, he was shot in the abdomen following an argument with another rapper. In 1997, he was arrested for failure to pay child support for three of his children. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to attempted assault on his wife and was the victim of a home invasion robbery at his girlfriend&#x27;s house. He was shot in the back and arm but the wounds were superficial.

In July 1998, only days after being shot in a push-in robbery at his girlfriend&#x27;s house in Brooklyn, he was arrested for shoplifting a pair of $50 shoes from a Sneaker Stadium store in Virginia Beach, Virginia, although he was carrying close to $500 in cash at the time. He was issued bench warrants by the Virginia Beach Sheriff&#x27;s Department to stand trial after he failed to appear in court numerous times. He was arrested for criminal threatening after a series of confrontations in Los Angeles a few weeks later, and was then re-arrested for similar charges not long after that. During a traffic stop, the details of which remain clouded in multiple versions of events, he was arrested for attempted murder and criminal weapon possession. The case was later dismissed.

On January 14, 1999, two officers from the Street Crimes Unit fired eight shots at Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard and accused him of firing at them after they stopped his car in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard was cleared by a grand jury and insisted that the officers had been scared by his cellular phone. No weapons or shell casings (besides those of the officers) were found in the vehicle or near the scene.

In February 1999, he was arrested for driving without a license and for being a convicted felon wearing a bulletproof vest. At the time, it was illegal for felons to own body armor. Back in New York weeks later, he was arrested for drug possession of crack cocaine and for traffic offenses. With multiple cases in the past and present, he was arrested with marijuana and 20 vials of crack.

In October 2000, he escaped from his court-mandated drug treatment facility and spent one month as a fugitive. During his time on the run, he met with RZA and spent some time in their recording studio. He then appeared onstage at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York drinking from a bottle at the record release party for &quot;The W&quot;, the third Wu-Tang Clan album. In late November 2000, while still a fugitive, he was arrested outside a South Philadelphia McDonald&#x27;s (at 29th and Gray&#x27;s Ferry Ave.), after he drew a crowd while signing autographs. He spent several days in a Philadelphia jail and was later extradited to New York City. A Manhattan court sentenced him to two to four years incarceration. He was released on parole on May 1, 2003.

In 2012, his FBI file was released to the public after a Freedom of Information Act request. It contains details of numerous crimes, such as alleged connections to three murders, a shootout with the New York City Police Department, and a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act investigation against the Wu-Tang Clan.

==Death==

Leading up to his death, Jones&#x27; legal troubles and eccentric behavior made him &quot;something of a folk hero&quot;, according to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; writer Michael Agger. Music writer Steve Huey wrote: &quot;it was difficult for observers to tell whether Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s wildly erratic behavior was the result of serious drug problems or genuine mental instability.&quot; According to &quot;The Atlantic&quot; contributing editor and music biographer James Parker, Jones had been diagnosed with schizophrenia around 2003.

Jones collapsed at approximately 4:35p.m. (EST) on November13, 2004, just two days before his 36th birthday, at RZA&#x27;s recording studio in New York City; he was pronounced dead at the scene. The official cause of death was a drug overdose; an autopsy found a lethal mixture of cocaine and the prescription opioid tramadol. The overdose was ruled accidental and witnesses said Jones reportedly complained of chest pain before collapsing.

Mourning the decline of Jones&#x27; mental and physical health, RZA wrote in his 2009 book &quot;The Tao of Wu&quot;:Trust me, the man who became ODB, Ason Unique, my cousin, he was a scientist and a minor prophet... People may not know this from the outrageous character he played, but ODB was a visionary. But he decayed, he lost that vision... From the time they put him in jail to all the drugs he was doing to all the stress he went through with his family, it took away his ability to see. And this night, he sat there and looked me in the eye and said, &quot;RZA, I don&#x27;t understand.&quot; ... Now, I know that right there, right when he said that—we lost him. Eight hours later, ODB was gone.

<text>A factory, manufacturing plant or production plant is an industrial facility, often a complex consisting of several buildings filled with machinery, where workers manufacture items or operate machines which process each item into another. They are a critical part of modern economic production, with the majority of the world&#x27;s goods being created or processed within factories.

Factories arose with the introduction of machinery during the Industrial Revolution, when the capital and space requirements became too great for cottage industry or workshops. Early factories that contained small amounts of machinery, such as one or two spinning mules, and fewer than a dozen workers have been called &quot;glorified workshops&quot;.

Most modern factories have large warehouses or warehouse-like facilities that contain heavy equipment used for assembly line production. Large factories tend to be located with access to multiple modes of transportation, some having rail, highway and water loading and unloading facilities. In some countries like Australia, it is common to call a factory building a &quot;Shed&quot;.

Factories may either make discrete products or some type of continuously produced material, such as chemicals, pulp and paper, or refined oil products. Factories manufacturing chemicals are often called &quot;plants&quot; and may have most of their equipment – tanks, pressure vessels, chemical reactors, pumps and piping – outdoors and operated from control rooms. Oil refineries have most of their equipment outdoors.

Discrete products may be final goods, or parts and sub-assemblies which are made into final products elsewhere. Factories may be supplied parts from elsewhere or make them from raw materials. Continuous production industries typically use heat or electricity to transform streams of raw materials into finished products.

The term &quot;mill&quot; originally referred to the milling of grain, which usually used natural resources such as water or wind power until those were displaced by steam power in the 19th century. Because many processes like spinning and weaving, iron rolling, and paper manufacturing were originally powered by water, the term survives as in &quot;steel mill&quot;, &quot;paper mill&quot;, etc.
== History ==

Max Weber considered production during ancient and medieval times as never warranting classification as factories, with methods of production and the contemporary economic situation incomparable to modern or even pre-modern developments of industry. In ancient times, the earliest production limited to the household, developed into a separate endeavor independent to the place of inhabitation with production at that time only beginning to be characteristic of industry, termed as &quot;unfree shop industry&quot;, a situation caused especially under the reign of the Egyptian pharaoh, with slave employment and no differentiation of skills within the slave group comparable to modern definitions as division of labour.

According to translations of Demosthenes and Herodotus, Naucratis was a, or the only, factory in the entirety of ancient Egypt. A source of 1983 (Hopkins), states the largest factory production in ancient times was of 120 slaves within fourth century BC Athens. An article within the New York Times article dated 13 October 2011 states:

... discovered at Blombos Cave, a cave on the south coast of South Africa where 100,000-year-old tools and ingredients were found with which early modern humans mixed an ochre-based paint.

Although The &quot;Cambridge Online Dictionary&quot; definition of factory states:

elsewhere:

The first machine is stated by one source to have been traps used to assist with the capturing of animals, corresponding to the machine as a mechanism operating independently or with very little force by interaction from a human, with a capacity for use repeatedly with operation exactly the same on every occasion of functioning. The wheel was invented , the spoked wheel . The Iron Age began approximately 1200–1000 BC. However, other sources define machinery as a means of production.

Archaeology provides a date for the earliest city as 5000 BC as Tell Brak (Ur &quot;et al.&quot; 2006), therefore a date for cooperation and factors of demand, by an increased community size and population to make something like factory level production a conceivable necessity.

Archaeologist Bonnet, unearthed the foundations of numerous workshops in the city of Kerma proving that as early as 2000 BC Kerma was a large urban capital.

The watermill was first made in the Persian Empire some time before 350 BC. In the third century BC, Philo of Byzantium describes a water-driven wheel in his technical treatises. Factories producing garum were common in the Roman Empire. The Barbegal aqueduct and mills are an industrial complex from the second century AD found in southern France. By the time of the fourth century AD, there was a water-milling installation with a capacity to grind 28 tons of grain per day, a rate sufficient to meet the needs of 80,000 persons, in the Roman Empire.

The large population increase in medieval Islamic cities, such as Baghdad&#x27;s 1.5 million population, led to the development of large-scale factory milling installations with higher productivity to feed and support the large growing population. A tenth-century grain-processing factory in the Egyptian town of Bilbays, for example, milled an estimated 300 tons of grain and flour per day. Both watermills and windmills were widely used in the Islamic world at the time.

The Venice Arsenal also provides one of the first examples of a factory in the modern sense of the word. Founded in 1104 in Venice, Republic of Venice, several hundred years before the Industrial Revolution, it mass-produced ships on assembly lines using manufactured parts. The Venice Arsenal apparently produced nearly one ship every day and, at its height, employed 16,000 people.

=== Industrial Revolution ===


One of the earliest factories was John Lombe&#x27;s water-powered silk mill at Derby, operational by 1721. By 1746, an integrated brass mill was working at Warmley near Bristol. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. Josiah Wedgwood in Staffordshire and Matthew Boulton at his Soho Manufactory were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system.

The factory system began widespread use somewhat later when cotton spinning was mechanized.

Richard Arkwright is the person credited with inventing the prototype of the modern factory. After he patented his water frame in 1769, he established Cromford Mill, in Derbyshire, England, significantly expanding the village of Cromford to accommodate the migrant workers new to the area. The factory system was a new way of organizing workforce made necessary by the development of machines which were too large to house in a worker&#x27;s cottage. Working hours were as long as they had been for the farmer, that is, from dawn to dusk, six days per week. Overall, this practice essentially reduced skilled and unskilled workers to replaceable commodities. Arkwright&#x27;s factory was the first successful cotton spinning factory in the world; it showed unequivocally the way ahead for industry and was widely copied.

Between 1770 and 1850 mechanized factories supplanted traditional artisan shops as the predominant form of manufacturing institution, because the larger-scale factories enjoyed a significant technological and supervision advantage over the small artisan shops. The earliest factories (using the factory system) developed in the cotton and wool textiles industry. Later generations of factories included mechanized shoe production and manufacturing of machinery, including machine tools. After this came factories that supplied the railroad industry included rolling mills, foundries and locomotive works, along with agricultural-equipment factories that produced cast-steel plows and reapers. Bicycles were mass-produced beginning in the 1880s.

The Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company&#x27;s Bridgewater Foundry, which began operation in 1836, was one of the earliest factories to use modern materials handling such as cranes and rail tracks through the buildings for handling heavy items.

Large scale electrification of factories began around 1900 after the development of the AC motor which was able to run at constant speed depending on the number of poles and the current electrical frequency. At first larger motors were added to line shafts, but as soon as small horsepower motors became widely available, factories switched to unit drive. Eliminating line shafts freed factories of layout constraints and allowed factory layout to be more efficient. Electrification enabled sequential automation using relay logic.

=== Assembly line ===
Henry Ford further revolutionized the factory concept in the early 20th century, with the innovation of the mass production. Highly specialized laborers situated alongside a series of rolling ramps would build up a product such as (in Ford&#x27;s case) an automobile. This concept dramatically decreased production costs for virtually all manufactured goods and brought about the age of consumerism.

In the mid - to late 20th century, industrialized countries introduced next-generation factories with two improvements:

# Advanced statistical methods of quality control, pioneered by the American mathematician William Edwards Deming, whom his home country initially ignored. Quality control turned Japanese factories into world leaders in cost-effectiveness and production quality.
# Industrial robots on the factory floor, introduced in the late 1970s. These computer-controlled welding arms and grippers could perform simple tasks such as attaching a car door quickly and flawlessly 24 hours a day. This too cut costs and improved speed.

Some speculation as to the future of the factory includes scenarios with rapid prototyping, nanotechnology, and orbital zero-gravity facilities. There is some scepticism about the development of the factories of the future if the robotic industry is not matched by a higher technological level of the people who operate it. According to some authors, the four basic pillars of the factories of the future are strategy, technology, people and habitability, which would take the form of a kind of &quot;laboratory factories&quot;, with management models that allow &quot;producing with quality while experimenting to do it better tomorrow&quot;.

== Siting the factory ==
Before the advent of mass transportation, factories&#x27; needs for ever-greater concentrations of labourers meant that they typically grew up in an urban setting or fostered their own urbanization. Industrial slums developed, and reinforced their own development through the interactions between factories, as when one factory&#x27;s output or waste-product became the raw materials of another factory (preferably nearby). Canals and railways grew as factories spread, each clustering around sources of cheap energy, available materials and/or mass markets. The exception proved the rule: even greenfield factory sites such as Bournville, founded in a rural setting, developed their own housing and profited from convenient communications systems.

Regulation curbed some of the worst excesses of industrialization&#x27;s factory-based society, labourers of Factory Acts leading the way in Britain. Trams, automobiles and town planning encouraged the separate development of industrial suburbs and residential suburbs, with labourers commuting between them.

Though factories dominated the Industrial Era, the growth in the service sector eventually began to dethrone them: the focus of labour, in general, shifted to central-city office towers or to semi-rural campus-style establishments, and many factories stood deserted in local rust belts.

The next blow to the traditional factories came from globalization. Manufacturing processes (or their logical successors, assembly plants) in the late 20th century re-focussed in many instances on Special Economic Zones in developing countries or on maquiladoras just across the national boundaries of industrialized states. Further re-location to the least industrialized nations appears possible as the benefits of out-sourcing and the lessons of flexible location apply in the future.

== Governing the factory ==
Much of management theory developed in response to the need to control factory processes. Assumptions on the hierarchies of unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled laborers and their supervisors and managers still linger on; however an example of a more contemporary approach to handle design applicable to manufacturing facilities can be found in Socio-Technical Systems (STS).

== Shadow factories ==

In Britain, a shadow factory is one of a number of manufacturing sites built in dispersed locations in times of war to reduce the risk of disruption due to enemy air-raids and often with the dual purpose of increasing manufacturing capacity. Before World War II Britain had built many shadow factories.

Production of the Supermarine Spitfire at its parent company&#x27;s base at Woolston, Southampton was vulnerable to enemy attack as a high-profile target and was well within range of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombers. Indeed, on 26 September 1940 this facility was completely destroyed by an enemy bombing raid. Supermarine had already established a plant at Castle Bromwich; this action prompted them to further disperse Spitfire production around the country with many premises being requisitioned by the British Government.

Connected to the Spitfire was production of its equally important Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, Rolls-Royce&#x27;s main aero engine facility was located at Derby, the need for increased output was met by building new factories in Crewe and Glasgow and using a purpose-built factory of Ford of Britain in Trafford Park Manchester.

<text>airBaltic, legally incorporated as AS Air Baltic Corporation, is a Latvian airline that is the flag carrier of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, colloquially known as the Baltic states. Its head office are located on the grounds of Riga International Airport in Mārupe municipality near Riga. Its main hub is Riga, and it operates bases in Tallinn, Vilnius, Tampere and a seasonal base in Las Palmas launched in 2023. It is 80% owned by the government of Latvia. It operates flights only on Airbus A220 aircraft. It operates a frequent-flyer program and a free meal menu offering food and drinks for purchase.

==History==
===Early history===

Baltic International Airlines (BIA) was a Latvian and US joint venture company owned by SIA Baltic International Airlines whose main airport was Riga International Airport. It was founded in June 1992, after the US-based private company Baltic International USA (BIUSA) failed to buy a part of the state-owned Latvian national airline Latavio. In the joint venture, the Latvian government owned 60%, while BIUSA owned 40%. After unsuccessful privatization attempts, Latavio was declared insolvent in October 1995. It was liquidated and the Government of Latvia together with Baltic International Airlines created airBaltic.

The airline was established as Air Baltic on 28 August 1995 with the signing of a joint venture between Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and the Government of Latvia. Operations started on 1 October 1995 with the first Air Baltic aircraft, a Saab 340, in Riga, and that afternoon, the plane made the first passenger flight for Air Baltic.

In 1996, the airline&#x27;s first Avro RJ70 was delivered; and Air Baltic joined the SAS frequent flier club as a partner. In 1997, a cargo department was established and, in 1998, the airline&#x27;s first Fokker 50 plane was delivered. The adopted livery was mainly white, with the name of the airline written in blue on the forward fuselage, the &#x27;B&#x27; logo being heavily stylized in blue checks. The checker blue pattern was repeated on the aircraft tailfin.

In 1999, Air Baltic became a joint stock company; it was previously a limited liability company. All of the Saab 340s were replaced by Fokker 50s. In September, the airline began operating under the European Aviation Operating Standards, or JAR ops. Air Baltic welcomed the new millennium by introducing new uniforms and opening a cargo centre at Riga&#x27;s airport.

The first Boeing 737-500 joined the fleet in 2003, and on 1 June 2004, Air Baltic launched services from the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, initially to five destinations. In October 2004, Air Baltic was rebranded as airBaltic. Its present livery consists of an all-white fuselage and lime tailfin. airBaltic.com is displayed on the forward upper fuselage, and the word &quot;Baltic&quot; is repeated in blue on the lower part of the tailfin. In December 2006, the first Boeing 737-300 joined the fleet and was configured with winglets. In July 2007, airBaltic introduced an online check-in system, the first online check-in system in the Baltic states. In the spring of 2008, two long-haul Boeing 757s were added to the fleet. In 2010, the airline began leasing De Havilland Canada Dash 8-400 aircraft, it retired these aircraft in 2023.

airBaltic had strong links with SAS, which owned 47.2% of the airline, and operated frequent flights to SAS hubs in Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm. Some of airBaltic&#x27;s products and services are still shared with SAS, including co-ordinated timetabling and shared airport lounges. airBaltic is not a member of any airline alliance but does have codeshare agreements in place with several Star Alliance member airlines and others.

airBaltic had secondary hubs at Vilnius Airport and Tallinn Airport. The majority of the routes commenced from Tallinn were cancelled shortly after opening, leading to complaints from the Estonian Consumer Protection Department.

In January 2009, SAS sold its entire stake in the company (47.2% of the airline) to Baltijas aviācijas sistēmas Ltd (BAS) for 14 million lats. BAS was wholly owned by Bertolt Flick (President and CEO) until December 2010, when 50% of BAS shares were transferred to Taurus Asset Management Fund Limited, registered in the Bahamas.

===Development since 2010===
In August 2011, airBaltic requested more than 60 million lats in capital as its losses continued to mount, and suffered speculation about its financial position and political scandals throughout 2011. In mid September 2011, the company announced plans to lay off around half its employees and cancel around 700 flights a month to avoid possible grounding. The company also announced that a mystery investor was willing to pay 9.6 million euros for an additional 59,110 shares. On 4 October 2011, the plans were annulled in order to make the necessary investments in the airline&#x27;s capital. The government of Latvia and BAS agreed to invest around 100 million lats in the airline&#x27;s share capital in proportion to their stakes in airBaltic. As part of the agreement its longtime president and CEO stepped down and Martin Gauss, former CEO of Hungarian airline Malév Hungarian Airlines, became the new CEO.

airBaltic had made an announcement on 23 September 2010 that it would establish a new secondary hub at Oulu Airport.

In early 2012, it was confirmed that Oulu hub plans were cancelled due to financial issues. The cost-cutting program, initiated by airBaltic which aimed to return to profitability in 2014, scored better than planned results in 2012, by narrowing its losses to €27.2 million, from €121.5 in 2011.

The state&#x27;s shareholding had been 99.8% since 30 November 2011, following the collapse of a bank linked with a finance package negotiated for the airline, but on 6 November 2015, it was reported that the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers had approved plans to sell 20% of airBaltic to German investor Ralf Dieter Montag-Girmes for €52 million and agreed to invest a further €80 million in the airline. The total of €132 million of fresh capital for the carrier is intended to spur its Horizon 2021 business plan and fleet modernisation. Following the closure of Air Lituanica and Estonian Air respectively in June and November 2015, and Nordica in November 2024, it is the only flag carrier in the Baltic countries.

The Bombardier CS300 delivery was much anticipated by airBaltic since this new aircraft type was originally planned to replace most of the airline&#x27;s Boeing 737-300s and Boeing 737-500s and would replace all by 2020. The delivery of the CS300 happened on 29 November 2016, at 2 am ET. On 28 November, Bombardier and airBaltic held a ceremony in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada for the first delivery of the CS300. At 1:30 am, shortly before the scheduled departure, an oil leak from an engine was spotted. It delayed the departure, but at 2:23 am ET, the aircraft was now airBaltic&#x27;s property. On board the inaugural flight, there were 18 people, including 6 pilots: 3 from Bombardier, and 3 from airBaltic. At 4:13 am ET, after a delay of over 2 hours, flight BT9801 took off en route to Stockholm. The airline received two CS300 in 2016 and expects to receive six in 2017, eight in 2018 and four more in 2020.

airBaltic was looking for opportunities to replace its Q400 turboprop fleet, and Bombardier and Embraer were viewed as potential future aircraft suppliers, with possible deliveries of 14 new aircraft beginning in 2020. On 26 September 2017, airBaltic announced it would buy at least 14 additional CSeries aircraft from Bombardier before the end of 2018; it planned to switch to an all-CSeries fleet by the early 2020s. Additional orders by airBaltic were announced by Bombardier on 28 May 2018 and included 30 CS300 with options and purchase rights for a further 30 CS300. Airbus purchased a 50.01% majority stake in the CSeries program in October 2017, with the deal closing in July 2018; the aircraft family was subsequently renamed the Airbus A220.

airBaltic temporarily suspended operations on 17 March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, and flights only restarted on a limited basis from 18 May 2020.

On 14 December 2021, airBaltic announced that its first secondary hub outside of the Baltic countries will be founded in Tampere–Pirkkala Airport in May 2022. In June 2023, airBaltic announced that it would establish a new seasonal base at Gran Canaria Airport, with two aircraft to be stationed there for the forthcoming winter season.

airBaltic began wet leasing its aircraft to other carriers in 2022, predominantly to Swiss. In 2023, it was approved for &quot;long-term and unlimited wet leasing within the Lufthansa Group.&quot; As of December 2023, airBaltic currently operates certain flights for Swiss.

After the pandemic, airBaltic unveiled a range of upgrades focused on enhancing the experience for its clients. In 2022, airBaltic debuted the Planies NFT collection, offering perks towards the airBaltic Club loyalty program. Then, in 2023, airBaltic forged a partnership with Starlink to offer unrestricted complimentary in-flight Wi-Fi in their routes, marking a pioneering move in Europe&#x27;s aviation industry. Installation of the service commenced in 2023 and will be finalised by 2025.

In November 2023, airBaltic announced that Delta Air Lines would begin codesharing 20 routes to their bases.

In January 2025, airBaltic announced that it was facing disruptions due to Pratt &amp; Whitney engine maintenance delays on its A220 fleet. The airline suspended 19 routes, reduced frequencies on 21 others and cancelled 4,670 flights, affecting 67,160 passengers. Despite these challenges and capacity constraints due to the wet-leasing of almost half of its fleet to the Lufthansa Group, airBaltic still maintains over 70 destinations.

On 29 January 2025, The Ministry of Transport of Latvia, airBaltic, and Lufthansa Group announced the signing of an agreement for Lufthansa Group to invest EUR 14 million in airBaltic for a minority stake, and Supervisory Board seat. In return for its investment, Lufthansa Group will receive a convertible share granting a 10% stake, which will be issued at a subscription price of EUR 14 million and converted into ordinary shares upon a potential IPO of airBaltic.

===Historical fleet===

 operated the following types of aircraft:
=== Livery ===
The original livery was painted on Avro RJ70s and had a white fuselage. The original airBaltic colour scheme, blue and white, was painted on the engines and the vertical stabiliser. The second generation livery also had a lime green wingtip and vertical stabiliser; however, the logo was changed to airBaltic.com, and the word airBaltic was painted on the engines, which were in their original metallic colour.

Until December 2019, the livery consisted of a white fuselage and lime green vertical stabiliser, wingtips and engines. In December 2019, the rear fuselage below the vertical stabiliser was also painted in lime green, with the tail cone remained white. The logo, stylised &#x27;airBaltic&#x27;, is painted in dark blue on the fuselage across the windows and on the underside of the aircraft. This livery is mainly used on A319, A320, A320neo and A220.

====Special liveries====
In order to represent the three Baltic states, four of the A220s have been painted in a series of national flag liveries - one each for Estonia and Lithuania, two for Latvia. In the beginning of 2024, airBaltic held a public competition where people could submit their own design for the 50th Airbus A220-300 aircraft received by airBaltic. This design will be unveiled alongside the delivery of the 50th aircraft.

Another special livery was unveiled for airBaltic&#x27;s 50th Airbus A220-300. This striking livery portrays an artistic depiction of a girl soaring through the clouds with long, flowing hair crowned by a traditional wreath and proudly featuring the Latvian flag. The design also incorporates several other elements that are inspired by the rich heritage and nature of the Baltic region – a ladybug, a swallow, and a stork. The final sketch of the design was modified and redesigned by airBaltic to meet the technical requirements of the aircraft.

==Award and recognition==
On 24 June 2024, airBaltic was voted &quot;2024&quot; &quot;Best Airline in Eastern Europe&quot; by Skytrax.

<text>Cost is the value of money that has been used up to produce something or deliver a service, and hence is not available for use anymore. In business, the cost may be one of acquisition, in which case the amount of money expended to acquire it is counted as cost. In this case, money is the input that is gone in order to acquire the thing. This acquisition cost may be the sum of the cost of production as incurred by the original producer, and further costs of transaction as incurred by the acquirer over and above the price paid to the producer. Usually, the price also includes a mark-up for profit over the cost of production.

More generalized in the field of economics, cost is a metric that is totaling up as a result of a process or as a differential for the result of a decision. Hence cost is the metric used in the standard modeling paradigm applied to economic processes.

Costs (pl.) are often further described based on their timing or their applicability.

In accounting, costs are the monetary value of expenditures for supplies, services, labor, products, equipment and other items purchased for use by a business or other accounting entity. It is the amount denoted on invoices as the price and recorded in book keeping records as an expense or asset cost basis.

Opportunity cost, also referred to as &quot;economic cost&quot; is the value of the best alternative that was not chosen in order to pursue the current endeavor—i.e., what could have been accomplished with the resources expended in the undertaking. It represents opportunities forgone.

In theoretical economics, cost used without qualification often means opportunity cost.

==Comparing private, external, and social costs==
When a transaction takes place, it typically involves both private costs and external costs.

Private costs are the costs that the buyer of a good or service pays the seller. This can also be described as the costs internal to the firm&#x27;s production function.

External costs (also called externalities), in contrast, are the costs that people other than the buyer are forced to pay as a result of the transaction. The bearers of such costs can be either particular individuals or society at large. Note that external costs are often both non-monetary and problematic to quantify for comparison with monetary values. They include things like pollution, things that society will likely have to pay for in some way or at some time in the future, even so that are not included in transaction prices.

Social costs are the sum of private costs and external costs.

For example, the manufacturing cost of a car (i.e., the costs of buying inputs, land tax rates for the car plant, overhead costs of running the plant and labor costs) reflects the &quot;private cost&quot; for the manufacturer (in some ways, normal profit can also be seen as a cost of production; see, e.g., Ison and Wall, 2007, p. 181). The polluted waters or polluted air also created as part of the process of producing the car is an &quot;external cost&quot; borne by those who are affected by the pollution or who value unpolluted air or water. Because the manufacturer does not pay for this external cost (the cost of emitting undesirable waste into the commons), and does not include this cost in the price of the car (a Kaldor–Hicks compensation), they are said to be external to the market pricing mechanism. The air pollution from driving the car is also an externality produced by the car user in the process of using his good. The driver does not compensate for the environmental damage caused by using the car.

==Cost estimation==
When developing a business plan for a new or existing company, product or project, planners typically make cost estimates in order to assess whether revenues/benefits will cover costs (see cost–benefit analysis). This is done in both business and government. Costs are often underestimated, resulting in cost overrun during execution.

&quot;Cost-plus pricing&quot; is where the price equals cost plus a percentage of overhead or profit margin. In business economics, the profitability of a trade or sales prospect relies on the ability of an enterprise to sustain market prices that cover all costs and leave a surplus for owner interest, as expressed by:

== Manufacturing costs vs. non-manufacturing costs ==
Manufacturing costs are those costs that are directly involved in manufacturing of products. Examples of manufacturing costs include raw materials costs and charges related to workers. Manufacturing cost is divided into three broad categories:

#Direct materials cost.
#Direct labor cost.
#Manufacturing overhead cost.
Non-manufacturing costs are those costs that are not directly incurred in manufacturing a product. Examples of such costs are salary of sales personnel and advertising expenses. Generally, non-manufacturing costs are further classified into two categories:

#Selling and distribution costs.
#Administrative costs.

==Other costs==
A defensive cost is an environmental expenditure to eliminate or prevent environmental damage. Defensive costs form part of the genuine progress indicator (GPI) calculations.

Labour costs would include travel time, holiday pay, training costs, working clothes, social insurance, taxes on employment &amp;c.

Path cost is a term in networking to define the worthiness of a path, see Routing.

<doc id="166791" wikidata="Q1337036" url="?curid=166791" title="Pole Position">
<text>is a 1982 racing video game developed and published by Namco for arcades. It was licensed to Atari, Inc. for US manufacture and distribution. &quot;Pole Position&quot; is considered one of the most important titles from the golden age of arcade video games. It was an evolution of Namco&#x27;s earlier arcade racing electro-mechanical games, like &quot;F-1&quot; (1976), whose designer Sho Osugi worked on &quot;Pole Position&quot;.

The game was a major commercial success in arcades. After becoming the highest-grossing arcade game of 1982 in Japan, it went on to become the most popular coin-operated arcade video game internationally in 1983. In North America, it was the highest-grossing arcade game for both 1983 and 1984 and still one of the top five in 1985.

&quot;Pole Position&quot; spawned ports, sequels, and a Saturday morning cartoon, although the cartoon has little in common with the game. The game established the conventions of the racing genre and its success inspired many imitators. &quot;Pole Position&quot; is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, and is considered to be the most influential racing game in particular. A sequel, &quot;Pole Position II&quot;, was released in 1983 with four tracks instead of one.

==Gameplay==
The player assumes the role of a Formula One race car driver who is attempting to compete in a race at the Fuji Speedway. The first objective is to complete a one-lap time trial within a specified time limit in order to qualify for the race. A successful qualification awards bonus points and sets the player&#x27;s starting position among seven computer-controlled cars, based on the lap time. The actual race consists of a set number of laps, with a set amount of time given at the start and more granted after each lap. 

During both the time trial and the race, the player can briefly lose control of the car by running through puddles on the track, colliding with other cars, or driving around curves too quickly. Running off the track and into the grass will slow the car down. Billboards placed next to the track will destroy the car if it collides with one of them, resulting in a brief delay as a new car is put into play. 

The game ends when the player either runs out of time during the qualifying lap or the race, or completes the final lap. The player earns bonus points for every car passed, and an additional bonus for any time left on the clock.

&quot;Pole Position&quot; was the first racing video game to feature a track based on a real racing circuit. It was also the first game to feature a qualifying lap, requiring the player to finish a time trial before they can compete in Grand Prix races. Once the player has qualified, they must complete the race in the time allowed, avoiding collisions with CPU-controlled opponents and billboards along the sides of the track. The game&#x27;s North American distributor, Atari, publicized the game for its &quot;unbelievable driving realism&quot; in providing a Formula 1 experience behind a racing wheel. The game&#x27;s graphics featured full-colour landscapes with scaling sprites, including race cars and other signs, and a pseudo-3D, third-person, rear perspective view of the track, with its vanishing point swaying side to side as the player approaches corners, accurately simulating forward movement into the distance. While earlier three-dimensional arcade driving games emphasized staying on the road while avoiding crashes, &quot;Pole Position&quot; gives a higher reward for passing rival cars and finishing among the leaders.

==Cabinet==
&quot;Pole Position&quot; was released in two configurations: a standard upright cabinet and an environmental/cockpit cabinet. Both versions include a steering wheel and a gear shifter for low and high gears, but the environmental/cockpit cabinet featured both an accelerator and a brake pedal, while the standard upright one only featured an accelerator pedal.

==Development==

&quot;Pole Position&quot; was created by both Shinichiro Okamoto and &quot;Galaxian&quot; designer Kazunori Sawano. Namco electro-mechanical game engineer Sho Osugi also assisted with development. Based on Namco&#x27;s experience with producing coin-operated electro-mechanical driving games in the 1970s, notably &quot;F-1&quot; (1976) designed by Sho Osugi, Sawano showed Okamoto rough sketches of his idea, who liked it enough to begin production of a video racing game. Okamoto wanted the game to be a true driving simulation game that used a 3D perspective and allowed the player to execute real-world techniques. He also chose to add the Fuji Speedway into the game to make newer players recognize it when they first played. Music was jointly composed by Nobuyuki Ohnogi and Yuriko Keino.

Development of the game lasted for three years. Okamoto recalls the most challenging part of development being to produce the hardware needed to run it, as the game was too &quot;ambitious&quot; to run on older hardware. The development team used two 16-bit processors to power the game, which Okamoto says was an unheard-of concept for arcade games at the time — for a while, it was the only video game to use a Z8000 CPU. &quot;Pac-Man&quot; creator Toru Iwatani chose the name &quot;Pole Position&quot; as he thought it sounded &quot;cool&quot; and appealing, and he shortly after filed a trademark for it. The controls also proved to be a challenge, as Okamoto wanted them to feel realistic and to match up with the gameplay — Osugi remembers Namco president Masaya Nakamura becoming frustrated with them, having difficulty keeping the car moving in a straight line.

The game&#x27;s arcade cabinet, a sit-down &quot;environmental&quot; machine, was chosen due to their popularity at the time. The development team had long fights over how fast the gear-shift should be, until it was ultimately decided to simply be either high or low speed.

==Release==
&quot;Pole Position&quot; was officially released in Japan on September 16, 1982. It was licensed out to Atari, Inc. for release in North America, where it made its debut at Chicago&#x27;s 1982 Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) show, held during November 18–20, before receiving a mass-market North American release on November 30, 1982, while Namco themselves released the game in Europe in late 1982. After its release, Osugi stated that all of Namco&#x27;s older electro-mechanical driving games were discontinued, as the company saw the future of arcade racers in the form of video games.

==Advertising==
The game is an early example of product placement in a video game, with billboards around the track advertising actual companies.

The game was also featured in a TV commercial shown only on MTV. It was part of a series of TV spots that Atari created in the 1980s exclusively for MTV.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; magazine listed &quot;Pole Position&quot; as the highest-grossing arcade game of 1982. &quot;Game Machine&quot; later listed it in their June 1, 1983 issue as the second top-grossing upright arcade unit of the month, before it returned to being the top-grossing game of the month in October 1983. Internationally, &quot;Pole Position&quot; was the most popular game in 1983. In Europe, it was a top-grossing arcade game in 1983.

In the United States, it sold over 21,000 arcade cabinets for an estimated ($ adjusted for inflation) by 1983. In addition, US coin drop earnings averaged ( adjusted for inflation) per week ($450 weekly per machine). On the US &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts, it topped the upright cabinet charts for seven months in 1983, from March through August and again in December. It also topped the US &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade charts for six consecutive months from March through August 1983, and then topped the street locations chart in November 1983. It ended the year as the highest-grossing arcade game of 1983 in North America, according to &quot;RePlay&quot; and the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA), and again became the highest-grossing arcade game of 1984 in the United States. Several years after its release, it was still one of the top five highest-grossing arcade video games of 1985.

The console version topped the UK sales charts in late 1983. In the United States between 1986 and 1990, the Atari 2600 version sold  units for , the Atari 5200 version sold  units for , and the version for Atari 8-bit computers version sold  units for , adding up to  units sold and grossed between 1986 and 1990.

===Reviews===
Upon its North American debut at AMOA 1982, it was reviewed by &quot;Video Games&quot; magazine, which listed it among the show&#x27;s top ten games. They compared it favorably with Sega&#x27;s &quot;Turbo&quot; (1981), referring to &quot;Pole Position&quot; as &quot;Turbo Deluxe&quot; in &quot;a speedway, not a cross-country race&quot;. They called &quot;Pole Position&quot; the &quot;ultimate test of driving skill&quot; for racing players. &quot;Electronic Games&quot; reviewed the arcade game in 1983, writing that it &quot;keeps the action on track from start to finish&quot; with &quot;challenging play&quot;, noting the gameplay is &quot;reasonably faithful to real life&quot; Formula One races. They also praised the sound effects and &quot;solid, realistic graphics&quot;, stating it has &quot;very rich color images&quot; and &quot;dimensional depth to the graphics&quot;. They gave it the 1983 Arcade Award for Coin-Op Game of the Year, praising the racing gameplay, &quot;beautiful graphics&quot; and &quot;breathtaking&quot; scenery as well as &quot;the two-heat format for the race itself&quot;.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewed the arcade game in 1983, writing that it &quot;is simply the most exhilarating driving simulation game on the market&quot;. They compared it favorably with &quot;Turbo&quot;, stating that, while &quot;Turbo&quot; &quot;featured better landscapes&quot;, it &quot;can&#x27;t match the speed, thrills and skill behind this new race game&quot;. They said &quot;Pole Position&quot;″s &quot;graphics are sophisticated and believable&quot;, noting that cars &quot;turning corners are shown in every graphic detail of the maneuvre&quot;. They also praised the gameplay, concluding that &quot;trying to hold a screaming curve or overtake&quot; offers &quot;thrills to compare with the real racetrack&quot;. It was considered the all-time best racing/driving game by &quot;InfoWorld&quot; in 1983 and &quot;Computer Games&quot; in early 1985.

When reviewing the Atari 8-bit version, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; called it &quot;by far the best road-race game ever thrown on a video screen&quot; with &quot;bright and brilliant&quot; graphics, and reiterated the recommendation in &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot;, but said the Commodore 64 version &quot;looks like a rush job and is far from arcade-game quality&quot;. &quot;Computer Games&quot; magazine criticized the Commodore conversions for lacking various features from the arcade original, giving the C64 version a mixed review and the VIC-20 version a negative review. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewed the Atari 2600 version, stating it is &quot;the best driving game available&quot; on the Atari VCS. When reviewing the Atari 5200 version, &quot;Hi-Res&quot; in 1984 found &quot;the playability of the game to be limited and the graphics to be the strongest aspect of the game&quot;. The magazine preferred Adventure International&#x27;s &quot;Rally Speedway&quot; to both &quot;Pole Position&quot; and Epyx&#x27;s &quot;Pitstop&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; gave it a mixed retrospective review, calling it &quot;a simulation down to the core&quot; and that those dedicated racing fans will be deterred by the game&#x27;s difficulty. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called &quot;Pole Position&quot; one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013.

===Impact===
&quot;Pole Position&quot; is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time. Bill Loguce and Matt Barton listed it as one of the 25 most influential games of all time, calling it &quot;arguably the most important racing game ever made&quot;. In 1984, &quot;Electronic Games&quot; stated that, for &quot;the first time in the amusement parlors, a first-person racing game gives a higher reward for passing cars and finishing among the leaders rather than just for keeping all four wheels on the road, thus making driving an art&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked the game 32nd on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Pole Position&quot; topped IGN&#x27;s list of The Top 10 Most Influential Racing Games Ever. They stated it had &quot;a drastically better-looking&quot; third-person &quot;chase cam view&quot; than &quot;Turbo&quot;, was &quot;the first racing game based on a real-world racing circuit (Fuji Speedway in Japan)&quot;, &quot;introduced checkpoints, and was the first to require a qualifying lap&quot;, and that its success, as &quot;the highest-grossing arcade game in North America in 1983, cemented the genre in place for decades to come and inspired a horde of other racing games&quot;.

==Legacy==

&quot; Pole Position&quot; was the most successful racing game of the classic era, spawning ports, sequels, and a Saturday morning cartoon.

The game spawned a number of clones, such as &quot;Top Racer&quot; from Commodore International, which led to a lawsuit from Namco against Commodore Japan that led to the seizure of &quot;Top Racer&quot; copies.

===Other media===

The title spawned a Saturday morning cartoon of the same name.

Parker Brothers published the &quot;Pole Position&quot; board game in 1983.

<text>In nuclear engineering, fissile material is material that can undergo nuclear fission when struck by a neutron of low energy. A self-sustaining thermal chain reaction can only be achieved with fissile material. The predominant neutron energy in a system may be typified by either slow neutrons (i.e., a thermal system) or fast neutrons. Fissile material can be used to fuel thermal-neutron reactors, fast-neutron reactors and nuclear explosives.

== Fissile vs fissionable ==

The term &quot;fissile&quot; is distinct from &quot;fissionable&quot;. A nuclide that can undergo nuclear fission (even with a low probability) after capturing a neutron of high or low energy is referred to as &quot;fissionable&quot;. A fissionable nuclide that can undergo fission with a high probability after capturing a low-energy thermal neutron is referred to as &quot;fissile&quot;. Fissionable materials include those (such as uranium-238) for which fission can be induced only by high-energy neutrons. As a result, fissile materials (such as uranium-235) are a subset of fissionable materials.

Uranium-235 fissions with low-energy thermal neutrons because the binding energy resulting from the absorption of a neutron is greater than the threshold required for fission; therefore uranium-235 is fissile. By contrast, the binding energy released by uranium-238 absorbing a thermal neutron is less than the critical energy, so the neutron must possess additional energy for fission to be possible. Consequently, uranium-238 is fissionable but not fissile.

An alternative definition defines fissile nuclides as those nuclides that can be made to undergo nuclear fission (i.e., are fissionable) and also produce neutrons from such fission that can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in the correct setting. Under this definition, the only nuclides that are fissionable but not fissile are those nuclides that can be made to undergo nuclear fission but produce insufficient neutrons, in either energy or number, to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. As such, while all fissile isotopes are fissionable, not all fissionable isotopes are fissile. In the arms control context, particularly in proposals for a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty, the term &quot;fissile&quot; is often used to describe materials that can be used in the fission primary of a nuclear weapon. These are materials that sustain an explosive fast neutron nuclear fission chain reaction.

Under all definitions above, uranium-238 () is fissionable, but not fissile. Neutrons produced by fission of have lower energies than the original neutron (they behave as in an inelastic scattering), usually below 1 MeV (i.e., a speed of about 14,000 km/s), the fission threshold to cause subsequent fission of , so fission of does not sustain a nuclear chain reaction.

Fast fission of in the secondary stage of a thermonuclear weapon, due to the production of high-energy neutrons from nuclear fusion, contributes greatly to the yield and to fallout of such weapons. Fast fission of tampers has also been evident in pure fission weapons. The fast fission of also makes a significant contribution to the power output of some fast-neutron reactors.

== Fissile nuclides ==
In general, most actinide isotopes with an odd neutron number are fissile. Most nuclear fuels have an odd atomic mass number ( = the total number of nucleons), and an even atomic number &quot;Z&quot;. This implies an odd number of neutrons. Isotopes with an odd number of neutrons gain an extra 1 to 2 MeV of energy from absorbing an extra neutron, from the pairing effect which favors even numbers of both neutrons and protons. This energy is enough to supply the needed extra energy for fission by slower neutrons, which is important for making fissionable isotopes also fissile.

More generally, nuclides with an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons, and located near a well-known curve in nuclear physics of atomic number vs. atomic mass number are more stable than others; hence, they are less likely to undergo fission. They are more likely to &quot;ignore&quot; the neutron and let it go on its way, or else to absorb the neutron but without gaining enough energy from the process to deform the nucleus enough for it to fission. These &quot;even-even&quot; isotopes are also less likely to undergo spontaneous fission, and they also have relatively much longer partial half-lives for alpha or beta decay. Examples of these isotopes are uranium-238 and thorium-232. On the other hand, other than the lightest nuclides, nuclides with an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons (odd &quot;Z&quot;, odd &quot;N&quot;) are usually short-lived (a notable exception is neptunium-236 with a half-life of 154,000 years) because they readily decay by beta-particle emission to their isobars with an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons (even &quot;Z&quot;, even &quot;N&quot;) becoming much more stable. The physical basis for this phenomenon also comes from the pairing effect in nuclear binding energy, but this time from both proton–proton and neutron–neutron pairing. The relatively short half-life of such odd-odd heavy isotopes means that they are not available in quantity and are highly radioactive.

According to the fissility rule proposed by Yigal Ronen, for a heavy element with &quot;Z&quot; between 90 and 100, an isotope is fissile if and only if } (where &quot;N&quot; = number of neutrons and &quot;Z&quot; = number of protons), with a few exceptions. This rule holds for all but fourteen nuclides – seven that satisfy the criterion but are nonfissile, and seven that are fissile but do not satisfy the criterion.

== Nuclear fuel ==

To be a useful fuel for nuclear fission chain reactions, the material must:

* Be in the region of the binding energy curve where a fission chain reaction is possible (i.e., above radium)
* Have a high probability of fission on neutron capture
* Release more than one neutron on average per neutron capture. (Enough of them on each fission, to compensate for non-fissions and absorptions in non-fuel material)
* Have a reasonably long half-life
* Be available in suitable quantities.

Fissile nuclides in nuclear fuels include:

* Uranium-233, bred from thorium-232 by neutron capture with intermediate decays steps omitted.
* Uranium-235, which occurs in natural uranium and enriched uranium
* Plutonium-239, bred from uranium-238 by neutron capture with intermediate decays steps omitted.
* Plutonium-241, bred from plutonium-240 directly by neutron capture.
Fissile nuclides do not have a 100% chance of undergoing fission on absorption of a neutron. The chance is dependent on the nuclide as well as neutron energy. For low and medium-energy neutrons, the neutron capture cross sections for fission (σF), the cross section for neutron capture with emission of a gamma ray (σγ), and the percentage of non-fissions are in the table at right.

Fertile nuclides in nuclear fuels include:

* Thorium-232, which breeds uranium-233 by neutron capture with intermediate decays steps omitted.
* Uranium-238, which breeds plutonium-239 by neutron capture with intermediate decays steps omitted.
* Plutonium-240, which breeds plutonium-241 directly by neutron capture.

<text>In photography, shutter speed or exposure time is the length of time that the film or digital sensor inside the camera is exposed to light (that is, when the camera&#x27;s shutter is open) when taking a photograph.
The amount of light that reaches the film or image sensor is proportional to the exposure time. of a second will let half as much light in as .

==Introduction==

The camera&#x27;s shutter speed, the lens&#x27;s aperture or f-stop, and the scene&#x27;s luminance together determine the amount of light that reaches the film or sensor (the exposure). Exposure value (EV) is a quantity that accounts for the shutter speed and the f-number. Once the sensitivity to light of the recording surface (either film or sensor) is set in numbers expressed in &quot;ISOs&quot; (e.g. 200 ISO, 400 ISO), the light emitted by the scene photographed can be controlled through aperture and shutter-speed to match the film or sensor sensitivity to light. This will achieve a good exposure when all the details of the scene are legible on the photograph. Too much light let into the camera results in an overly pale image (or &quot;over-exposure&quot;) while too little light will result in an overly dark image (or &quot;under-exposure&quot;).

Multiple combinations of shutter speed and f-number can give the same exposure value (E.V.). According to exposure value formula, doubling the exposure time doubles the amount of light (subtracts 1 EV). Reducing the aperture size at multiples of one over the square root of two lets half as much light into the camera, usually at a predefined scale of , , , , , , , , , , and so on. For example, lets four times more light into the camera as does. A shutter speed of  s with an aperture gives the same exposure value as a  s shutter speed with an aperture, and also the same exposure value as a  s shutter speed with an aperture, or  s at .

In addition to its effect on exposure, the shutter speed changes the way movement appears in photographs. Very short shutter speeds can be used to freeze fast-moving subjects, for example at sporting events. Very long shutter speeds are used to intentionally blur a moving subject for effect. Short exposure times are sometimes called &quot;fast&quot;, and long exposure times &quot;slow&quot;.

Adjustments to the aperture need to be compensated by changes of the shutter speed to keep the same (right) exposure.

In early days of photography, available shutter speeds were not standardized, though a typical sequence might have been  s,  s,  s,  s,  s and  s; neither were apertures or film sensitivity (at least 3 different national standards existed). Soon this problem resulted in a solution consisting in the adoption of a standardized way of choosing aperture so that each major step exactly doubled or halved the amount of light entering the camera (, , , , , , etc.), a standardized 2:1 scale was adopted for shutter speed so that opening one aperture stop and reducing the amount of time of the shutter speed by one step resulted in the identical exposure. The agreed standards for shutter speeds are: .
With this scale, each increment roughly doubles the amount of light (longer time) or halves it (shorter time).

Camera shutters often include one or two other settings for making very long exposures:
* B (for &quot;bulb&quot;) keeps the shutter open as long as the shutter release is held.
* T (for &quot;time&quot;) keeps the shutter open (once the shutter-release button had been depressed) until the shutter release is pressed again.

The ability of the photographer to take images without noticeable blurring by camera movement is an important parameter in the choice of the slowest possible shutter speed for a handheld camera. The rough guide used by most 35 mm photographers is that the slowest shutter speed that can be used easily without much blur due to camera shake is the shutter speed numerically closest to the lens focal length. For example, for handheld use of a 35 mm camera with a 50 mm normal lens, the closest shutter speed is  s (closest to &quot;50&quot;), while for a 200 mm lens it is recommended not to choose shutter speeds below  s. This rule can be augmented with knowledge of the intended application for the photograph, an image intended for significant enlargement and closeup viewing would require faster shutter speeds to avoid obvious blur. Through practice and special techniques such as bracing the camera, arms, or body to minimize camera movement, using a monopod or a tripod, slower shutter speeds can be used without blur. If a shutter speed is too slow for hand holding, a camera support, usually a tripod, must be used. Image stabilization on digital cameras or lenses can often permit the use of shutter speeds 3–4 stops slower (exposures 8–16 times longer).

Shutter priority refers to a shooting mode used in cameras. It allows the photographer to choose a shutter speed setting and allow the camera to decide the correct aperture. This is sometimes referred to as Shutter Speed Priority Auto Exposure, or TV (time value on Canon cameras) mode, S mode on Nikons and most other brands.

==Creative utility in photography==

Shutter speed is one of several methods used to control the amount of light recorded by the camera&#x27;s digital sensor or film. It is also used to manipulate the visual effects of the final image.
Slower shutter speeds are often selected to suggest the movement of an object in a still photograph.

Excessively fast shutter speeds can cause a moving subject to appear unnaturally frozen. For instance, a running person may be caught with both feet in the air with all indication of movement lost in the frozen moment.

When a slower shutter speed is selected, a longer time passes from the moment the shutter opens till the moment it closes. More time is available for movement in the subject to be recorded by the camera as a blur.

A slightly slower shutter speed will allow the photographer to introduce an element of blur, either in the subject, where, in our example, the feet, which are the fastest moving element in the frame, might be blurred while the rest remains sharp; or if the camera is panned to follow a moving subject, the background is blurred while the subject remains relatively sharp.

The exact point at which the background or subject will start to blur depends on the speed at which the object is moving, the angle that the object is moving in relation to the camera, the distance it is from the camera and the focal length of the lens in relation to the size of the digital sensor or film.

When slower shutter-speeds, in excess of about half a second, are used on running water, the water in the photo will have a ghostly white appearance reminiscent of fog. This effect can be used in landscape photography.

Zoom burst is a technique which entails the variation of the focal length of a zoom lens during a longer exposure. In the moment that the shutter is opened, the lens is zoomed in, changing the focal length during the exposure. The center of the image remains sharp, while the details away from the center form a radial blur, which causes a strong visual effect, forcing the eye into the center of the image.

The following list provides an overview of common photographic uses for standard shutter speeds.
* &quot; s and less&quot;: The fastest speed available in APS-H or APS-C format DSLR cameras (). (Canon EOS 1D, Nikon D1, Nikon 1 J2, D1X, and D1H)
* &quot; s&quot;: The fastest speed available in any 35 mm film SLR camera. (Minolta Maxxum 9xi, &quot;
* &quot; s&quot;: The fastest speed available in production SLR cameras (), also the fastest speed available in any full-frame DSLR or SLT camera (). Used to take sharp photographs of very fast subjects, such as birds or planes, under good lighting conditions, with an ISO speed of 1,000 or more and a large-aperture lens.
* &quot; s&quot;: The fastest speed available in consumer SLR cameras (); also the fastest speed available in any leaf shutter camera (such as the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX1) (). Used to take sharp photographs of fast subjects, such as athletes or vehicles, under good lighting conditions and with an ISO setting of up to 800.
* &quot; s and  s&quot;: Used to take sharp photographs of moderately fast subjects under normal lighting conditions.
* &quot; s and  s&quot;: Used to take sharp photographs of people in motion in everyday situations.  s is the fastest speed useful for panning; it also allows for a smaller aperture (up to ) in motion shots, and hence for a greater depth of field.
* &quot; s&quot;: This speed, and slower ones, are no longer useful for freezing motion.  s is used to obtain greater depth of field and overall sharpness in landscape photography, and is also often used for panning shots.
* &quot; s&quot;: Used for panning shots, for images taken under dim lighting conditions, and for available light portraits.
* &quot; s&quot;: Used for panning subjects moving slower than and for available-light photography. Images taken at this and slower speeds normally require a tripod or an image stabilized lens/camera to be sharp.
* &quot; s and  s&quot;: This and slower speeds are useful for photographs other than panning shots where motion blur is employed for deliberate effect, or for taking sharp photographs of immobile subjects under bad lighting conditions with a tripod-supported camera.
* &quot; s,  s and 1 s&quot;: Also mainly used for motion blur effects and/or low-light photography, but only practical with a tripod-supported camera.
* &quot;B (bulb)&quot; (fraction of second to several hours): Used with a mechanically fixed camera in astrophotography and for certain special effects.
==Cinematographic shutter formula==

Motion picture cameras used in traditional film cinematography employ a mechanical rotating shutter. The shutter rotation is synchronized with film being pulled through the gate, hence shutter speed is a function of the frame rate and shutter angle.

Where &quot;E&quot; = shutter speed (reciprocal of exposure time in seconds), &quot;F&quot; = frames per second, and &quot;S&quot; = shutter angle:

: formula_1, for &quot;E&quot; in reciprocal seconds

: formula_2

With a traditional shutter angle of 180°, film is exposed for second at 24 frame/s. To avoid effect of light interference when shooting under artificial lights or when shooting television screens and computer monitors,  s (172.8°) or  s (144°) shutter is often used.

Electronic video cameras do not have mechanical shutters and allow setting shutter speed directly in time units. Professional video cameras often allow selecting shutter speed in terms of shutter angle instead of time units, especially those that are capable of overcranking or undercranking.

<doc id="166810" wikidata="Q274095" url="?curid=166810" title="Rigor mortis">
<text>Rigor mortis (), or postmortem rigidity, is the fourth stage of death. It is one of the recognizable signs of death, characterized by stiffening of the limbs of the corpse caused by chemical changes in the muscles postmortem (mainly calcium). In humans, rigor mortis can occur as soon as four hours after death. Contrary to folklore and common belief, rigor mortis is not permanent and begins to pass within hours of onset. Typically, it lasts no longer than eight hours at room temperature.

== Physiology ==

After death, aerobic respiration in an organism ceases, depleting the source of oxygen used in the making of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle. When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. When the body&#x27;s glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges.

Calcium enters the cytosol after death. Calcium is released into the cytosol due to the deterioration of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Also, the breakdown of the sarcolemma causes additional calcium to enter the cytosol. The calcium activates the formation of actin-myosin cross-bridging. Once calcium is introduced into the cytosol, it binds to the troponin of thin filaments, which causes the troponin-tropomyosin complex to change shape and allow the myosin heads to bind to the active sites of actin proteins. In rigor mortis, myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex. Normal relaxation would occur by replacing ADP with ATP, which would destabilize the myosin-actin bond and break the cross-bridge. However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax.

Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs between 48 and 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death.
== Applications in meat industry ==
Rigor mortis is very important in the meat industry. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determines the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15 °C (59 °F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length. 

Cold shortening is caused by the release of stored calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle fibers, in response to the cold stimulus. The calcium ions trigger powerful muscle contraction aided by ATP molecules. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after slaughter and skinning. In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening.

== Application in forensic pathology ==

The degree of rigor mortis may be used in forensic pathology to determine the approximate time of death. A dead body holds its position as rigor mortis sets in. If the body is moved after death, but before rigor mortis begins, forensic techniques such as livor mortis can be applied. Rigor mortis is known as transient evidence, as the degree to which it affects a body degrades over time.

<doc id="166811" wikidata="Q6535129" url="?curid=166811" title="Do not resuscitate">
<text>A do-not-resuscitate order (DNR), also known as Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR), Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR), no code or allow natural death, is a medical order, written or oral depending on the jurisdiction, indicating that a person should not receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if that person&#x27;s heart stops beating. Sometimes these decisions and the relevant documents also encompass decisions around other critical or life-prolonging medical interventions. The legal status and processes surrounding DNR orders vary in different polities. Most commonly, the order is placed by a physician based on a combination of medical judgement and patient involvement.

==Basis for choice==

Interviews with 26 DNR patients and 16 full code patients in Toronto, Canada in 2006–2009 suggest that the decision to choose do-not-resuscitate status was based on personal factors including health and lifestyle; relational factors (to family or to society as a whole); and philosophical factors. Audio recordings of 19 discussions about DNR status between doctors and patients in two US hospitals (San Francisco, California and Durham, North Carolina) in 2008–2009 found that patients &quot;mentioned risks, benefits, and outcomes of CPR,&quot; and doctors &quot;explored preferences for short- versus long-term use of life-sustaining therapy.&quot; A Canadian article suggests that it is inappropriate to offer CPR when the clinician knows the patient has a terminal illness and that CPR will be futile.

===Outcomes of CPR===

When medical institutions explain DNR, they describe survival from CPR, in order to address patients&#x27; concerns about outcomes. After CPR in hospitals in 2017, 7,000 patients survived to leave the hospital alive, out of 26,000 CPR attempts, or 26%. After CPR outside hospitals in 2018, 8,000 patients survived to leave the hospital alive, out of 80,000 CPR attempts, or 10%. Success was 21% in a public setting, where someone was more likely to see the person collapse and give help than in a home. Success was 35% when bystanders used an Automated external defibrillator (AED), outside health facilities and nursing homes.

In information on DNR, medical institutions compare survival for patients with multiple chronic illnesses; patients with heart, lung or kidney disease; liver disease; widespread cancer or infection; and residents of nursing homes. Research shows that CPR survival is the same as the average CPR survival rate, or nearly so, for patients with multiple chronic illnesses, or diabetes, heart or lung diseases. Survival is about half as good as the average rate, for patients with kidney or liver disease, or widespread cancer or infection.

For people who live in nursing homes, survival after CPR is about half to three quarters of the average rate. In health facilities and nursing homes where AEDs are available and used, survival rates are twice as high as the average survival found in nursing homes overall. Few nursing homes have AEDs.

Research on 26,000 patients found similarities in the health situations of patients with and without DNRs. For each of 10 levels of illness, from healthiest to sickest, 7% to 36% of patients had DNR orders; the rest had full code.

===Risks===
As noted above, patients considering DNR mention the risks of CPR. Physical injuries, such as broken bones, affect 13% of CPR patients, and an unknown additional number have broken cartilage which can sound like breaking bones.

Mental problems affect some patients, both before and after CPR. After CPR, up to 1 more person, among each 100 survivors, is in a coma than before CPR (and most people come out of comas). Five to 10 more people, of each 100 survivors, need more help with daily life than they did before CPR. Five to 21 more people, of each 100 survivors, decline mentally, but stay independent.

===Organ donation===

Organ donation is possible after CPR, but not usually after a death with a DNR. If CPR does not revive the patient, and continues until an operating room is available, then kidneys and liver can be considered for donation. US Guidelines endorse organ donation, &quot;Patients who do not have ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation) after resuscitation efforts and who would otherwise have termination of efforts may be considered candidates for kidney or liver donation in settings where programs exist.&quot; European guidelines encourage donation, &quot;After stopping CPR, the possibility of ongoing support of the circulation and transport to a dedicated centre in perspective of organ donation should be considered.&quot; CPR revives 64% of patients in hospitals and 43% outside (ROSC), which gives families a chance to say goodbye, and all organs can be considered for donation, &quot;We recommend that all patients who are resuscitated from cardiac arrest but who subsequently progress to death or brain death be evaluated for organ donation.&quot;

1,000 organs per year in the US are transplanted from patients who had CPR. Donations can be taken from 40% of patients who have ROSC and later become brain dead, and an average of 3 organs are taken from each patient who donates organs. DNR does not usually allow organ donation.

===Less care for DNR patients===

Reductions in other care are not supposed to result from a DNAPR decision being in place. Some patients choose DNR because they prefer less care: Half of Oregon patients with DNR orders who filled out a POLST (known as a Physician Orders and Scope of Treatment, or POST, in Tennessee) wanted only comfort care, and 7% wanted full care. The rest wanted various limits on care, so blanket assumptions are not reliable. There are many doctors &quot;misinterpreting DNR preferences and thus not providing other appropriate therapeutic interventions.&quot;

Patients with DNR are less likely to get medically appropriate care for a wide range of issues such as blood transfusions, cardiac catheterizations, cardiac bypass, operations for surgical complication, blood cultures, central line placement, antibiotics and diagnostic tests. &quot;Providers intentionally apply DNR orders broadly because they either assume that patients with DNR orders would also prefer to abstain from other life-sustaining treatments or believe that other treatments would not be medically beneficial.&quot; 60% of surgeons do not offer operations with over 1% mortality to patients with DNRs. The failure to offer appropriate care to patients with DNR led to the development of emergency care and treatment plans (ECTPs), such as the Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment (ReSPECT), which aim to record recommendations concerning DNR alongside recommendations for other treatments in an emergency situation. ECTPs have prompted doctors to contextualize CPR within a broader consideration of treatment options, however ECTPs are most frequently completed for patients at risk of sudden deterioration and the focus tends to be on DNR.

Patients with DNR therefore die sooner, even from causes unrelated to CPR. A study grouped 26,300 very sick hospital patients in 2006–2010 from the sickest to the healthiest, using a detailed scale from 0 to 44. They compared survival for patients at the same level, with and without DNR orders. In the healthiest group, 69% of those without DNR survived to leave the hospital, while only 7% of equally healthy patients with DNR survived. In the next-healthiest group, 53% of those without DNR survived, and 6% of those with DNR. Among the sickest patients, 6% of those without DNR survived, and none with DNR.

Two Dartmouth College doctors note that &quot;In the 1990s ... &#x27;resuscitation&#x27; increasingly began to appear in the medical literature to describe strategies to treat people with reversible conditions, such as IV fluids for shock from bleeding or infection... the meaning of DNR became ever more confusing to health-care providers.&quot; Other researchers confirm this pattern, using &quot;resuscitative efforts&quot; to cover a range of care, from treatment of allergic reaction to surgery for a broken hip. Hospital doctors do not agree which treatments to withhold from DNR patients, and document decisions in the chart only half the time. A survey with several scenarios found doctors &quot;agreed or strongly agreed to initiate fewer interventions when a DNR order was present.

After successful CPR, hospitals often discuss putting the patient on DNR, to avoid another resuscitation. Guidelines generally call for a 72-hour wait to see what the prognosis is, but within 12 hours, US hospitals put up to 58% of survivors on DNR, and at the median hospital, 23% received DNR orders at this early stage, much earlier than the guideline. The hospitals putting fewest patients on DNR had more successful survival rates, which the researchers suggest shows their better care in general. When CPR happened outside the hospital, hospitals put up to 80% of survivors on DNR within 24 hours, with an average of 32.5%. The patients who received DNR orders had less treatment, and almost all died in the hospital. The researchers say families need to expect death if they agree to DNR in the hospital.

=== Controlled organ donation after circulatory death ===
In 2017, Critical Care Medicine (Ethics) and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Committees on Transplant Anesthesia issued a statement regarding organ donation after circulatory death (DCD). The purpose of the statement is to provide an educational tool for institutions choosing to use DCD. In 2015, nearly 9% of organ transplantations in the United States resulted from DCD, indicating it is a widely-held practice. According to the President&#x27;s Commission on Death Determination, there are two sets of criteria used to define circulatory death: irreversible absence of circulation and respiration, and irreversible absence of whole brain function. Only one criterion needs to be met for the determination of death before organ donation and both have legal standing, according to the 1980 Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA); a determination of death must be according to accepted medical standards. All states within the United States adhere to the original or modified UDDA. The dead donor role states that a patient should not be killed for or by the donation of their organs and that organs can only be procured from dead people (lungs, kidneys, and lobes of a liver may be donated by living donors in certain highly regulated situations).

The definition of irreversibility centers around an obligatory period of observation to determine that respiration and circulation have ceased and will not resume spontaneously. Clinical examination alone may be sufficient to determine irreversibility, but the urgent time constraints of CDC may require more definitive proof of cessation with confirmatory tests, such as intra-arterial monitoring or Doppler studies. In accordance with the Institute of Medicine, the obligatory period for DCD is longer than 2 minutes but no more than 5 minutes of absent circulatory function before pronouncing the patient dead, which is supported by a lack of literature indicating that spontaneous resuscitation occurs after two minutes of arrest and that ischemic damage to perfusable organs occurs within 5 minutes.

Most patients considered for DCD will have been in the intensive care unit (ICU) and are dependent on ventilatory and circulatory support. Potential DCD donors are still completing the dying process but have not yet been declared dead, so quality end-of-life care should remain the absolute top priority and must not be compromised by the DCD process. The decision to allow death to occur by withdrawing life-sustaining therapies needs to have been made in accordance to the wishes of the patient and/or their legal agent; this must happen prior to any discussions about DCD, which should ideally occur between the patient&#x27;s primary care giver and the patient&#x27;s agent after rapport has been established.

===Patient values===

The philosophical factors and preferences mentioned by patients and doctors are treated in the medical literature as strong guidelines for care, including DNR or CPR. &quot;Complex medical aspects of a patient with a critical illness must be integrated with considerations of the patient&#x27;s values and preferences&quot; and &quot;the preeminent place of patient values in determining the benefit or burden imposed by medical interventions.&quot; Patients&#x27; most common goals include talking, touch, prayer, helping others, addressing fears, and laughing. Being mentally aware was as important to patients as avoiding pain, and doctors underestimated its importance and overestimated the importance of pain. Dying at home was less important to most patients. Three quarters of patients prefer longer survival over better health.

==Advance directive, living will, POLST, medical jewellery, tattoos==

Advance directives and living wills are documents written by individuals themselves, so as to state their wishes for care, if they are no longer able to speak for themselves. In contrast, it is a physician or hospital staff member who writes a DNR &quot;physician&#x27;s order,&quot; based upon the wishes previously expressed by the individual in their advance directive or living will. Similarly, at a time when the individual is unable to express their wishes, but has previously used an advance directive to appoint an agent, then a physician can write such a DNR &quot;physician&#x27;s order&quot; at the request of that individual&#x27;s agent. These various situations are clearly enumerated in the &quot;sample&quot; DNR order presented on this page.

It should be stressed that, in the United States, an advance directive or living will is not sufficient to ensure a patient is treated under the DNR protocol, even if it is their wish, as neither an advance directive nor a living will legally binds doctors. They can be legally binding in appointing a medical representative, but not in treatment decisions.

Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) documents are the usual place where a DNR is recorded outside hospitals. A disability rights group criticizes the process, saying doctors are trained to offer very limited scenarios with no alternative treatments, and steer patients toward DNR. They also criticize that DNR orders are absolute, without variations for context. The Mayo Clinic found in 2013 that &quot;Most patients with DNR/DNI (do not intubate) orders want CPR and/or intubation in hypothetical clinical scenarios,&quot; so the patients had not had enough explanation of the DNR/DNI or did not understand the explanation.

In the UK, emergency care and treatment plans (e.g. ReSPECT) are clinical recommendations written by healthcare professionals after discussion with patients or their relatives about their priorities of care. Research has found that the involvement of patients or their family in forming ECTP recommendations is variable. In some situations (where there are limited treatment options available, or where the patient is likely to deteriorate quickly) healthcare professionals will not explore the patient&#x27;s preferences, but will instead ensure that patients or their relatives understand what treatment will or will not be offered.

=== Medical jewellery ===
Medical bracelets, medallions, and wallet cards from approved providers allow for identification of DNR patients in home or non-hospital settings. In the US each state has its own DNR policies, procedures, and accompanying paperwork for emergency medical service personnel to comply with such forms of DNR.

=== DNR tattoos ===
There is a growing trend of using DNR tattoos, commonly placed on the chest, to replace other forms of DNR, but these often cause confusion and ethical dilemmas among healthcare providers. Laws vary from place to place regarding what constitutes a valid DNR and currently do not include tattoos. End of life (EOL) care preferences are dynamic and depend on factors such as health status, age, prognosis, healthcare access, and medical advancements. DNR orders can be rescinded while tattoos are far more difficult to remove. At least one person decided to get a DNR tattoo based on a dare while under the influence of alcohol.

== Ethics and violations ==
DNR orders in certain situations have been subject to ethical debate. In many institutions it is customary for a patient going to surgery to have their DNR automatically rescinded. Though the rationale for this may be valid, as outcomes from CPR in the operating room are substantially better than general survival outcomes after CPR, the impact on patient autonomy has been debated. It is suggested that facilities engage patients or their decision makers in a &#x27;reconsideration of DNR orders&#x27; instead of automatically making a forced decision.

When a patient or family and doctors do not agree on a DNR status, it is common to ask the hospital ethics committee for help, but authors have pointed out that many members have little or no ethics training, some have little medical training, and they do have conflicts of interest by having the same employer and budget as the doctors.

In the United States there is accumulating evidence of racial differences in rates of DNR adoption. A 2014 study of end stage cancer patients found that non-Latino white patients were significantly more likely to have a DNR order (45%) than black (25%) and Latino (20%) patients. The correlation between preferences against life-prolonging care and the increased likelihood of advance care planning is consistent across ethnic groups.

There are also ethical concerns around how patients reach the decision to agree to a DNR order. One study found that patients wanted &quot;intubation&quot; in several scenarios, even when they had a Do Not Intubate (DNI) order, which raises a question whether patients with DNR orders may want CPR in some scenarios too. It is possible that providers are having a &quot;leading conversation&quot; with patients or mistakenly leaving crucial information out when discussing DNR.

One study reported that while 88% of young doctor trainees at two hospitals in California in 2013 believed they themselves would ask for a DNR order if they were terminally ill, they are flexible enough to give high intensity care to patients who have not chosen DNR.

There is also the ethical issue of discontinuation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in DNR patients in cases of medical futility. A large survey of Electrophysiology practitioners, the heart specialists who implant pacemakers and ICDs, noted that the practitioners felt that deactivating an ICD was not ethically distinct from withholding CPR thus consistent with DNR. Most felt that deactivating a pacemaker was a separate issue and could not be broadly ethically endorsed. Pacemakers were felt to be unique devices, or ethically taking a role of &quot;keeping a patient alive&quot; like dialysis.

A self-report study from 1999 conducted in Germany and Sweden found that the frequency of resuscitations performed against patients&#x27; wishes (per DNR status) was as high as 32.5% among German doctors polled.

=== Violations and suspensions ===
Medical professionals can be subjected to ramifications if they knowingly violate a DNR. Each state has established laws and rules that medical providers must follow. For example, in some states within the US, DNRs only apply within a hospital, and can be disregarded in other settings. In these states, EMTs (emergency medical technicians) can therefore administer CPR until reaching the hospital where such laws exist.

If a medical professional knows of a DNR and continues with resuscitation efforts, then they can be sued by the family of the patient. This happens often, with a recent jury awarding $400,000 to the family of a patient for &quot;Wrongful Prolongation of Life&quot; in June 2021. Physicians and their attorneys have argued in some cases that when in doubt, they often err on the side of life-saving measures because they can be potentially reversed later by disconnecting the ventilator. This was the case in 2013 when Beatrice Weisman was wrongfully resuscitated, leading to the family filing a lawsuit.

In the US, bystanders who are not healthcare professionals working in a professional setting are protected under the Good Samaritan Law in most cases. Bystanders are also protected if they begin CPR and use a AED even if there is a DNR tattoo or other evident indicator.

Instead of violating a DNR, anesthesiologists often require suspension of a DNR during palliative care surgeries, such as when a large tumor needs to be removed or a chronic pain issue is being solved. Anesthesiologists argue that the patient is in an unnatural state during surgery with medications, and anesthesiologists should be allowed to reverse this state. This suspension can occur during the pre-op, peri-op, and post-operative period. These suspensions used to be automatic and routine, but this is now viewed as unethical. The &quot;Patient Self-Determination Act&quot; also prohibits this, as automatic suspension would be a violation of this federal order. However, it is still a common practice for patients to opt for a suspension of their DNR depending on the circumstances of the surgery.

Ethical dilemmas on suspending a DNR occur when a patient with a DNR attempts suicide and the necessary treatment involves ventilation or CPR. In these cases, it has been argued that the principle of beneficence takes precedence over patient autonomy and the DNR can be revoked by the physician. Another dilemma occurs when a medical error happens to a patient with a DNR. If the error is reversible only with CPR or ventilation, there is no consensus if resuscitation should take place or not.

== Terminology ==
&quot;DNR&quot; and &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot; are common terms in the United States, Canada, and New Zealand. This may be expanded in some regions with the addition of &quot;DNI&quot; (Do Not Intubate). DNI is specific for not allowing the placement of breathing tubes. In some hospitals &quot;DNR&quot; alone will imply no intubation, though 98% of intubations are unrelated to cardiac arrest; most intubations are for pneumonia or surgery. Clinically, the vast majority of people requiring resuscitation will require intubation, making a DNI alone problematic. Hospitals sometimes use the expression &quot;no code&quot;, which refers to the jargon term &quot;code&quot;, short for &quot;Code Blue&quot;, an alert to a hospital&#x27;s resuscitation team. If a patient does want to be resuscitated, their code status may be listed as &quot;full code&quot; (the opposite of DNR). If the patient only wants to be resuscitated under certain conditions, this is termed &quot;partial code.&quot;

Some areas of the United States and the United Kingdom include the letter A, as in &quot;DNAR&quot;, to clarify &quot;Do Not &quot;Attempt&quot; Resuscitation&quot;. This alteration is so that it is not presumed by the patient or family that an attempt at resuscitation will be successful.

As noted above in Less care for DNR patients, the word &quot;resuscitation&quot; has grown to include many treatments other than CPR, so DNR has become ambiguous, and authors recommend &quot;No CPR&quot; instead. In the United Kingdom the preferred term is now &quot;DNACPR&quot;, reflecting that &quot;resuscitation&quot; is a general term which includes &quot;cardiopulmonary resuscitation&quot; as well as, for example, the administration of intravenous fluid.

Since the term DNR implies the omission of action, and therefore &quot;giving up&quot;, a few authors have advocated for these orders to be retermed &quot;Allow Natural Death&quot;. Others say AND is ambiguous whether it would allow morphine, antibiotics, hydration or other treatments as part of a natural death. New Zealand and Australia, and some hospitals in the UK, use the term &quot;NFR&quot; or &quot;Not For Resuscitation&quot;. Typically these abbreviations are not punctuated, e.g., &quot;DNR&quot; rather than &quot;D.N.R.&quot;

Resuscitation orders, or lack thereof, can also be referred to in the United States as a part of Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST), Physician&#x27;s Orders on Scope of Treatment (POST) or Transportable Physician Orders for Patient Preferences (TPOPP) orders, typically created with input from next of kin when the patient or client is not able to communicate their wishes.

Another synonymous term is &quot;not to be resuscitated&quot; (&quot;NTBR&quot;).

In 2004 the internal telephone number for cardiac arrests in all UK hospitals was standardised to &quot;2222&quot;; in 2017 the European Board of Anaesthesiology (EBA, European Resuscitation Council (ERC), and the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESAIC) issued a joint statement recommending this practice across all European hospitals. Current UK practice is for resuscitation recommendations to be standalone orders (such as DNACPR) or embedded within broader emergency care and treatment plans (ECTPs), such as the Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment (ReSPECT).

== Usage by country ==
DNR documents are widespread in some countries and unavailable in others. In countries where a DNR is unavailable, the decision to end resuscitation is made solely by physicians.

A 2016 paper reports a survey of small numbers of doctors in numerous countries, asking &quot;how often do you discuss decisions about resuscitation with patients and/or their family?&quot; and &quot;How do you communicate these decisions to other doctors in your institution?&quot; Some countries had multiple respondents, who did not always act the same, as shown below. There was also a question &quot;Does national guidance exist for making resuscitation decisions in your country?&quot; but the concept of &quot;guidance&quot; had no consistent definition. For example, in the US, four respondents said yes, and two said no.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, Do Not Resuscitate orders are covered by legislation on a state-by-state basis.

In Victoria, a Refusal of Medical Treatment certificate is a legal means to refuse medical treatments of current medical conditions. It does not apply to palliative care (reasonable pain relief; food and drink). An Advanced Care Directive legally defines the medical treatments that a person may choose to receive (or not to receive) in various defined circumstances. It can be used to refuse resuscitation, so as to avoid needless suffering.

In NSW, a Resuscitation Plan is a medically authorised order to use or withhold resuscitation measures, and which documents other aspects of treatment relevant at end of life. Such plans are only valid for patients of a doctor who is a NSW Health staff member. The plan allows for the refusal of any and all life-sustaining treatments, the advance refusal for a time of future incapacity, and the decision to move to purely palliative care.

=== Brazil ===
There is no formally recognized protocol for creating and respecting DNR orders in Brazil&#x27;s healthcare delivery system. The legality of not administering resuscitation procedures for terminally ill patients has not been clearly defined, leading many providers to practice caution around withholding CPR.

Although DNR orders have not been institutionalized in Brazil there has been a significant amount of dialogue around the ethical question of whether or not to withhold resuscitation interventions. In the past two decades the Federal Medical Board of Brazil published two resolutions, CFM 1.805/2006 and CFM 1.995/2012, which address therapeutic limitations in terminally ill patients as well as advanced directives. A recent study also showed that in Brazil&#x27;s healthcare system CPR is being withheld in scenarios of terminal illness or multiple comorbidities at rates similar to those in North America.

=== Canada ===
Do not resuscitate orders are similar to those used in the United States. In 1995, the Canadian Medical Association, Canadian Hospital Association, Canadian Nursing Association, and Catholic Health Association of Canada worked with the Canadian Bar Association to clarify and create a Joint Statement on Resuscitative Interventions guideline for use to determine when and how DNR orders are assigned. DNR orders must be discussed by doctors with the patient or patient agents or patient&#x27;s significant others. Unilateral DNR by medical professionals can only be used if the patient is in a vegetative state.

=== France ===
In 2005, France implemented its &quot;Patients&#x27; Rights and End of Life Care&quot; act. This act allows the withholding/withdrawal of life support treatment and as well as the intensified usage of certain medications that can quicken the action of death. This act also specifies the requirements of the act.

The &quot;Patients&#x27; Rights and End of Life Care&quot; Act includes three main measures. First, it prohibits the continuation of futile medical treatments. Secondly, it empowers the right to palliative care that may also include the intensification of the doses of certain medications that can result in the shortening the patient&#x27;s life span. Lastly, it strengthens the principle of patient autonomy. If the patient is unable to make a decision, the discussion, thus, goes to a trusted third party.

=== Hong Kong ===
Starting in 2000, the Medical Council of Hong Kong has taken the position that advance directives should be recognized. A Law Reform Commission consultation from 2004 to 2006 resulted in a recommendation that legislation be passed in support of advance directives. However, as of 2019 no consensus had been reached on legislation.

The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has adopted a set of forms which its doctors will recognize if properly completed. However, their recognition at private hospitals is less clear.

=== Israel ===
In Israel, it is possible to sign a DNR form as long as the patient is at least 17 years of age, dying, and aware of their actions.

=== Italy ===
In Italy DNR is included in the Italian law no. 219 of December 22, 2017, &quot;Disposizioni Anticipate di Trattamento&quot; or DAT, also called &quot;biotestamento&quot;. The law no.219 &quot;Rules on informed consent and advance treatment provisions&quot;, reaffirm the freedom of choice of the individual and make concrete the right to health protection, respecting the dignity of the person and the quality of life. The DAT are the provisions that every person of age and capable of understanding and wanting can express regarding the acceptance or rejection of certain diagnostic tests or therapeutic choices and individual health treatments, in anticipation of a possible future inability to self-determine. To be valid, the DATs must have been drawn up only after the person has acquired adequate medical information on the consequences of the choices he intends to make through the DAT. With the entry into force of law 219/2017, every person of age and capable of understanding and willing can draw up his DAT. Furthermore, the DATs must be drawn up with: public act authenticated private writing simple private deed delivered personally to the registry office of the municipality of residence or to the health structures of the regions that have regulated the DAT Due to particular physical conditions of disability, the DAT can be expressed through video recording or with devices that allow the person with disabilities to communicate. The DATs do not expire. They can be renewed, modified or revoked at any time, with the same forms in which they can be drawn up. With the DAT it is also possible to appoint a trustee, as long as he is of age and capable of understanding and willing, who is called to represent the signatory of the DAT who has become incapable in relations with the doctor and health facilities. With the Decree of 22 March 2018, the Ministry of Health established a national database for the registration of advance treatment provisions. Without the expression of any preference by the patient, Physicians must attempt to resuscitate all patients regardless of familial wishes.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, DNR orders are known as Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR). Currently, there are no laws or guidelines in place regarding DNAR orders but they are still routinely used. A request to withdraw from life support can be completed by the patient or a surrogate. In addition, it is common for Japanese doctors and nurses to be involved in the decision-making process for the DNAR form.

=== Jordan ===
DNRs are not recognized by Jordan. Physicians attempt to resuscitate all patients regardless of individual or familial wishes.

=== Nigeria ===
There is no formally accepted protocol for DNRs in Nigeria&#x27;s healthcare delivery system. Written wills may act as a good guide in many end of life scenarios, but often physicians and/or patients&#x27; families will act as the decision makers. As quoted in a 2016 article on Advanced Directives in Nigeria, &quot;everything derives from communal values, the common good, the social goals, traditional practices, cooperative virtues and social relationship. Individuals do not exist in a vacuum but within a web of social and cultural relationships.&quot; It is important to note that there are vast cultural differences and perspectives on end of life within Nigeria itself between regions and communities of different ancestry.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
In Saudi Arabia patients cannot legally sign a DNR, but a DNR can be accepted by order of the primary physician in case of terminally ill patients.

=== Taiwan ===
In Taiwan, patients sign their own DNR orders, and are required to do so to receive hospice care. However, one study looking at insights into Chinese perspectives on DNR showed that the majority of DNR orders in Taiwan were signed by surrogates. Typically doctors discuss the issue of DNR with the patients family rather than the patient themselves. In Taiwan, there are two separate types of DNR forms: DNR-P which the patient themselves sign and DNR-S in which a designated surrogate can sign. Typically, the time period between signing the DNR and death is very short, showing that signing a DNR in Taiwan is typically delayed. Two witnesses must also be present in order for a DNR to be signed.

DNR orders have been legal in Taiwan since June 2000 and were enacted by the Hospice and Palliative Regulation. Also included in the Hospice and Palliative Regulation is the requirement to inform a patient of their terminal condition, however, the requirement is not explicitly defined leading to interpretation of exact truth telling.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
The UAE have laws forcing healthcare staff to resuscitate a patient even if the patient has a DNR or does not wish to live. There are penalties for breaching the laws.

=== United Kingdom ===

==== England ====
In England, CPR is presumed in the event of a cardiac arrest unless a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; order is in place. If they have capacity as defined under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 the patient may decline resuscitation. Patients may also specify their wishes and/or devolve their decision-making to a proxy using an advance directive, which are commonly referred to as &#x27;Living Wills&#x27;, or an emergency care and treatment plan (ECTP), such as ReSPECT. Discussion between patient and doctor is integral to decisions made in advance directives and ECTPs, where resuscitation recommendations should be made within a more holistic consideration of all treatment options. Patients and relatives cannot demand treatment (including CPR) which the doctor believes is futile and in this situation, it is their doctor&#x27;s duty to act in their &#x27;best interest&#x27;, whether that means continuing or discontinuing treatment, using their clinical judgment. If the patient lacks capacity, relatives will often be asked for their opinion in order to form a &#x27;best interest&#x27; view of what the individual&#x27;s views would have been (prior to losing capacity). Evaluation of ReSPECT (an ECTP) found that resuscitation status remained a central component of conversations, and that there was variability in the discussion of other emergency treatments.
In 2020 the Care Quality Commission found that residents of care homes had been given inappropriate orders of Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) without notice to residents or their families, causing avoidable deaths. In 2021, the Mencap charity found that people with learning disabilities also had inappropriate DNACPR orders. Medical providers have said that any discussion with patients and families is not in reference to consent to resuscitation and instead should be an explanation. The UK&#x27;s regulatory body for doctors, the General Medical Council, provides clear guidance on the implementation and discussion of DNACPR decisions, and the obligation to communicate these decisions effectively was established by legal precedent in 2015.

==== Scotland ====
In Scotland, the terminology used is &quot;Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation&quot; or &quot;DNACPR&quot;. There is a single policy used across all of NHS Scotland. The legal standing is similar to that in England and Wales, in that CPR is viewed as a treatment and, although there is a general presumption that CPR will be performed in the case of cardiac arrest, this is not the case if it is viewed by the treating clinician to be futile. Patients and families cannot demand CPR to be performed if it is felt to be futile (as with any medical treatment) and a DNACPR can be issued despite disagreement, although it is good practice to involve all parties in the discussion.

As in England and Wales, inappropriate orders have been given to individuals who had no medical reason for them, such as a deaf man who received a DNACPR order in 2021 due to &quot;communication difficulties.&quot;

==== Wales ====
Wales has its own national DNACPR policy, &#x27;Sharing and Involving&#x27;. They use the term &#x27;Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation&#x27; or &#x27;DNACPR&#x27;. They also have an active public information campaigns, which includes the website &#x27;TalkCPR&#x27; 

=== United States ===
In the United States the documentation is especially complicated in that each state accepts different forms, and advance directives also known as living wills may not be accepted by EMS as legally valid forms. If a patient has a living will that specifies the patient requests DNR but does not have a properly filled out state-sponsored form that is co-signed by a physician, EMS may attempt resuscitation.

The DNR decision by patients was first litigated in 1976 in &quot;In re Quinlan&quot;. The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the right of Karen Ann Quinlan&#x27;s parents to order her removal from artificial ventilation. In 1991 Congress passed into law the Patient Self-Determination Act that mandated hospitals honor an person&#x27;s decision in their healthcare. Forty-nine states currently permit the next of kin to make medical decisions of incapacitated relatives, the exception being Missouri. Missouri has a Living Will Statute that requires two witnesses to any signed advance directive that results in a DNR/DNI code status in the hospital.

In the United States, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) will not be performed if a valid written DNR order is present. Many states do not recognize living wills or health care proxies in the prehospital setting and prehospital personnel in those areas may be required to initiate resuscitation measures unless a specific state-sponsored form is properly filled out and cosigned by a physician.

==== Legal precedent for the right to refuse medical interventions ====
There are three notable cases which set the baseline for patient&#x27;s rights to refuse medical intervention:

# Karen Quinlan, a 21-year-old woman, was in a persistent vegetative state after experiencing two 15-minute apneic periods secondary to drug use. After a year without improvement her father requested that life support be withdrawn. The hospital refused and this culminated in a court case. The trial court sided with the hospital, however the New Jersey Supreme Court reversed the decision. This was the first of multiple state level decisions pre-empting the Cruzan case which established the non-religious (there were other prior rulings regarding Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses) right to refuse care and extended that right to incapacitated patients via their guardians. It also established that court cases are not needed to terminate care when there is concordance between the stakeholders in the decision (Guardian, Clinician, Ethics Committees). It also shifted the focus from the right to seek care to the right to die. Mrs. Quinlan survived for 9 years after mechanical ventilation was discontinued.
# Nancy Cruzan was a 31-year-old woman who was in a persistent vegetative state after a motor vehicle accident that caused brain damage. Her family asked that life support be stopped after 4 years without any improvement. The hospital refused without a court order, and the family sued to obtain one. The trial court sided with the family concluding that the state could not override her wishes. This ruling was appealed to and reversed by the Missouri Supreme Court. This case was ultimately heard by the United States Supreme Court, which affirmed the right of competent individuals to refuse medical treatment and established standards for refusal of treatment for an incompetent person.
# Theresa &quot;Terri&quot; Schiavo was a 27-year-old woman who experienced cardiac arrest and was resuscitated successfully. She was in a persistent vegetative state thereafter. After 8 years in this state without recovery, her husband decided to have her feeding tube removed. Schiavo&#x27;s parents disagreed and the case that ensued ultimately was heard by the Florida Supreme Court which ruled that remaining alive would not respect her wishes. The United States Supreme Court affirmed that decision and refused to hear the case. This case affirmed the right of a patient to refuse care that is not in their best interests even when incapacitated.

<text>Spartacus is a 1960 American epic historical drama film directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Kirk Douglas in the title role, a slave and gladiator who leads a rebellion against Rome during the events of the Third Servile War. Adapted by Dalton Trumbo from Howard Fast&#x27;s 1951 novel of the same title, the film also stars Laurence Olivier as Roman general and politician Marcus Licinius Crassus, Charles Laughton as rival senator Sempronius Gracchus, Peter Ustinov as gladiatorial school owner Lentulus Batiatus, and John Gavin as Julius Caesar. Jean Simmons played Spartacus&#x27; wife Varinia, a fictional character, and Tony Curtis played the fictional slave Antoninus.

Douglas, whose company Bryna Productions was producing the film, removed original director Anthony Mann after three weeks of shooting. Kubrick, with whom Douglas had made &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; (1957), took over as director. It was the only film directed by Kubrick where he did not have complete artistic control. Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo was blacklisted at the time as one of the Hollywood Ten. Douglas publicly announced that Trumbo was the screenwriter of &quot;Spartacus&quot;, and President John F. Kennedy crossed American Legion picket lines to view the film, helping to end blacklisting; Howard Fast&#x27;s book had also been blacklisted and he had to self-publish the original edition.

The film won four Academy Awards (Best Supporting Actor for Ustinov, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design) from six nominations. It also received six nominations at the Golden Globes, including Woody Strode‘s only career Golden Globe nomination (for Best Supporting Actor), ultimately winning one (Best Motion Picture – Drama). At the time of the film’s release, it was the biggest moneymaker in Universal Studios&#x27; history, which it remained until it was surpassed by &quot;Airport&quot; (1970). In 2017, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

== Plot ==
In the first century BC, the Roman Republic has slid into corruption, its menial work done by slaves. One slave, a Thracian named Spartacus, is so uncooperative in his position in a mining pit that he is sentenced to death by starvation. By chance, he is displayed to Roman &quot;lanista&quot; (gladiatorial school manager) Lentulus Batiatus, who – impressed by his ferocity – purchases Spartacus for his school in Capua and instructs trainer Marcellus not to overdo his indoctrination, believing the slave &quot;has quality&quot;. Amid the abuse, Spartacus forms a quiet relationship with Varinia, a serving woman whom he refuses to touch when she is sent to &quot;entertain&quot; him in his cell. The two are forced to endure numerous humiliations for defying the conditions of servitude.

Batiatus receives a visit from the fabulously wealthy and powerful Roman senator Marcus Licinius Crassus, who aims to become dictator of Rome. Crassus eventually buys Varinia, and for the amusement of his companions arranges for a private show for Spartacus and others to fight to the death. When Spartacus is disarmed, his opponent, an Ethiopian named Draba, spares his life in a burst of defiance and solidarity, and instead attacks the Roman audience, only to be speared in the back by a guard and then personally killed by Crassus. The next day, with the ludus&#x27; atmosphere still tense over this episode, Batiatus sends Varinia away to Crassus&#x27; house in Rome. Spartacus kills Marcellus, who was taunting him over his affections, and their fight escalates into a riot. Batiatus flees while the gladiators overwhelm their guards and escape into the countryside.

Spartacus is elected chief of the fugitives and decides to lead them out of Italy and back to their homes. They plunder country estates as they go, collecting enough money to buy sea transport from Rome&#x27;s foes, the pirates of Cilicia. Many slaves join the group, making it as large as an army. Among the new arrivals is Varinia, who escaped while being delivered to Crassus. Another is Antoninus, a slave entertainer who also fled Crassus&#x27; service after finding out the bisexual Crassus expected Antoninus to become his sex slave. Spartacus feels inadequate because of his lack of education. However, he proves an excellent leader and organizes his diverse followers into a tough and self-sufficient community. Varinia, now his informal wife, becomes pregnant.

The Roman Senate becomes increasingly alarmed as Spartacus defeats every army sent against him. Crassus&#x27; opponent Gracchus knows that his rival will try to use the crisis as a justification for seizing control of the Roman army. To try to prevent this, Gracchus channels as much military power as possible into the hands of his own &quot;protégé&quot;, the young senator Julius Caesar. Although Caesar lacks Crassus&#x27; contempt for the lower classes of Rome, he mistakes the man&#x27;s rigid outlook for a patrician. Thus, when Gracchus reveals that he has bribed the Cilicians to get Spartacus out of Italy and rid Rome of the slave army, Caesar regards such tactics as beneath him and goes over to Crassus.

Crassus uses a bribe of his own to make the pirates abandon Spartacus and has the Roman army secretly force the rebels away from the coastline towards Rome. Amid panic that Spartacus means to sack the city, the Senate gives Crassus absolute power. Now surrounded by Roman legions, Spartacus persuades his men to die fighting. Just by rebelling and proving themselves human, he says that they have struck a blow against slavery. In the ensuing battle, most of the slave army is massacred. The Romans try to locate the rebel leader for special punishment by offering a pardon (and return to enslavement) if the men will identify Spartacus. Every surviving man responds by shouting &quot;I&#x27;m Spartacus!&quot;. Crassus has them all sentenced to death by crucifixion along the Via Appia, where the revolt began.

Meanwhile, after finding Varinia and Spartacus&#x27; newborn son, Crassus takes them prisoner. He is disturbed by the idea that Spartacus can command more love and loyalty than he can, and hopes to compensate by making Varinia as devoted to him as she was to her former husband. When she rejects him, he furiously seeks out Spartacus (whom he recognizes from having watched him at Batiatus&#x27; school) and forces him to fight Antoninus to the death. The survivor is to be crucified, along with all the other slaves. Spartacus kills Antoninus to spare him this terrible fate. The incident leaves Crassus worried about Spartacus&#x27; potential to live in legend as a martyr. In other matters, he is also worried about Caesar, who he senses will someday eclipse him.

Gracchus, having seen Rome fall into tyranny, commits suicide. Before doing so, he bribes his friend Batiatus to rescue Spartacus&#x27; family from Crassus and carry them away to freedom. On the way out of Rome, the group passes under Spartacus&#x27; cross. Varinia comforts him in his dying moments by showing him his son, who will grow up free and knowing who his father was.

== Cast ==
==Production==
===Development===
The development of &quot;Spartacus&quot; was partly instigated by Kirk Douglas&#x27;s failure to win the title role in William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959). Douglas had worked with Wyler before on &quot;Detective Story&quot; (1951), and was disappointed when Wyler chose Charlton Heston, instead. Shortly after, Edward Lewis, a vice president for Douglas&#x27;s film company, Bryna Productions (named after Douglas&#x27;s mother), had read Howard Fast&#x27;s novel, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, which had a related theme—an individual who challenges the might of the Roman Empire. Douglas was impressed enough to purchase an option on the book with his own finances. He proposed the project to Arthur B. Krim, the head of United Artists, which was set to distribute &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958), which also starred Douglas. Krim turned down the project as Yul Brynner had been developing his own &quot;Spartacus&quot; film, tentatively titled &quot;The Gladiators&quot;. Martin Ritt was set to direct, and he was incensed after learning about Douglas&#x27;s rival project. Lewis then proposed merging the two projects, with Douglas and Brynner in leading roles. Brynner declined the offer, and proceeded to film &quot;The Gladiators&quot; after Ritt had finished editing &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; (1959).

Douglas&#x27;s agent Lew Wasserman suggested he try having his film produced for Universal Studios. With Dalton Trumbo&#x27;s screenplay being completed in two weeks, Universal and Douglas pulled ahead of Brynner&#x27;s rival project. Brynner&#x27;s project was later placed on hold as the weather conditions in Europe grew unsuitable for filming. Brynner then chose to film &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960) instead. By the fall of 1958, Universal Studios eventually agreed to finance the film after Douglas persuaded Olivier, Laughton, and Ustinov to act in it. Olivier was also to direct the picture. Lewis became the producer of the film, with Douglas taking executive producer credit.

Douglas originally offered the role of Varinia to French actress Jeanne Moreau, but she did not want to leave her boyfriend in France. German actress Sabine Bethmann was then cast. The studio gave her the anglicized name of &quot;Sabina Bethman&quot; for use in the film&#x27;s publicity, but she was replaced by Jean Simmons after only days of filming.

===Writing===
Howard Fast was initially hired to adapt his own novel into a screenplay. After 60 days had passed, Kirk Douglas read Fast&#x27;s first draft, which he described as a &quot;disaster, unusable.&quot; Pressed for time, and in competition with Brynner&#x27;s rival project, Douglas turned to Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted as one of the &quot;Hollywood 10&quot;. Trumbo did not like Fast as he found him to be narrow-minded in his Marxist views, but agreed to write a treatment. Trumbo submitted his treatment, which Douglas and Edward Lewis then gave to Fast stating this was their preferred direction for the screenplay. Fast refused to follow Trumbo&#x27;s treatment, so Douglas hired Trumbo to write the final screenplay. Lewis was to serve as the front for Trumbo, with the latter receiving payments directed to his pseudonym &quot;Sam Jackson&quot;.

Douglas insisted that Trumbo be given screen credit for his work, which helped to break the blacklist. Trumbo had been jailed for contempt of Congress in 1950, after which he had survived by writing screenplays under assumed names. Douglas publicly announced that Trumbo was the screenwriter of &quot;Spartacus&quot;. Further, President John F. Kennedy publicly ignored a demonstration organized by the American Legion and went to see the film.

In his autobiography, Douglas states that this decision was motivated by a meeting that Edward Lewis, Stanley Kubrick, and he had regarding whose names to list for the screenplay in the film credits, given Trumbo&#x27;s shaky position with Hollywood executives. One idea was to credit Lewis as co-writer or sole writer, but Lewis vetoed both suggestions. Kubrick then suggested that his name be used. Douglas and Lewis found Kubrick&#x27;s eagerness to take credit for Trumbo&#x27;s work revolting, and the next day, Douglas called the gate at Universal saying, &quot;I&#x27;d like to leave a pass for Dalton Trumbo.&quot; Douglas writes, &quot;For the first time in 10 years, [Trumbo] walked on to a studio lot. He said, &#x27;Thanks, Kirk, for giving me back my name.&#x27;

In reality, the public announcement of Trumbo&#x27;s screenwriting credit for &quot;Spartacus&quot; did not come until August 1960, seven months after producer-director Otto Preminger&#x27;s January 20, 1960, announcement that he had hired Trumbo to adapt Leon Uris&#x27; novel &quot;Exodus&quot; for the screen. Douglas later successfully denied Trumbo credit for the film &quot;Town Without Pity&quot;, as he worried that his continued association with the screenwriter would hurt his career.

=== Filming ===
David Lean was offered but turned down an offer to direct &quot;Spartacus&quot;. Anthony Mann, best known for his Westerns which included &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; (1953), was instead hired. Filming started on January 27, 1959, in Death Valley, California for the opening sequence in the quarry. As filming continued, Douglas felt Mann had lost control of the film, writing in particular: &quot;He seemed scared of the scope of the picture ... He let Peter Ustinov direct his own scenes by taking every suggestion Peter made. The suggestions were good—for Peter, but not necessarily for the film.&quot; On February 13, Mann left (or was fired from) the production. Mann did not discuss the reasons for his departure until shortly before his death in 1967, in which he stated: &quot;Kirk Douglas was the producer of &quot;Spartacus&quot;: he wanted to insist on the message angle. I thought the message would go over more easily by showing physically all the horrors of slavery. A film must be visual, too much dialogue kills it ... From then, we disagreed: I left.&quot; A year later, Mann directed another epic of similar size, &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961). Principal photography ended in August 1959, although several battle scenes were filmed through October.

Large parts of the film were shot at Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, California. Parts were also filmed at nearby California Lutheran University, where an army can be seen storming off Mount Clef Ridge. Additionally, scenes set in Marcus Licinius Crassus&#x27; villa were filmed at Hearst Castle.

Stanley Kubrick, then 30 years old, was hired to take over. He had already directed four feature films (including &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, also starring Douglas). &quot;Spartacus&quot; was a bigger project by far, with a budget of $12 million (equivalent to about $million in ) and a cast of 10,500, a daunting project for such a young director. &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, his previous film, had only been budgeted at $935,000. Kubrick immediately fired Sabine Bethmann, who had only worked two days on the film. He and Douglas felt that she was not right for the role, so she was paid $3,000 to go home. Bethmann was replaced with Jean Simmons, who had been campaigning for the role. Douglas had originally chosen to cast Bethmann over Simmons because he imagined Varinia having a strikingly different accent from the aristocratic Romans, who were to be played mostly by actors with British accents. Simmons was still available and took over the role in the film with only a day&#x27;s notice.

&quot;Spartacus&quot; was filmed using the 35 mm Super 70 Technirama format and then blown up to 70 mm film. This was a change for Kubrick, who preferred using the standard spherical format. This process allowed him to achieve ultra-high definition and to capture large panoramic scenes. Kubrick had wanted to shoot the picture in Rome with cheap extras and resources, but Edward Muhl, president of Universal Pictures, wanted to make an example of the film and prove that a successful epic could be made in Hollywood itself, and &quot;stem the flood of &#x27;runaway&#x27; producers heading for Europe&quot;. A compromise was reached by filming the intimate scenes in Hollywood, and the battle scenes, at Kubrick&#x27;s request, in Spain. Kubrick found working outdoors or in real locations to be distracting, and he believed the actors would benefit more from working on a soundstage, where they could fully concentrate. To create the illusion of the large crowds that play such an essential role in the film, Kubrick&#x27;s crew used three-channel sound equipment to record 76,000 spectators at a Michigan State – Notre Dame college football game shouting &quot;Hail, Crassus!&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Spartacus!&quot;

The battle scenes were filmed on a vast plain outside Madrid. About 8,000 trained soldiers from the Spanish infantry were used to double as the Roman army. Kubrick directed the armies from the top of specially constructed towers. However, he eventually had to cut all but one of the gory battle scenes, due to negative audience reactions at test screenings. So precise was Kubrick, that even in arranging the bodies of the slaughtered slaves he had each &quot;corpse&quot; assigned with a number and instructions. Shooting locations also included the countryside near Guadalajara and Iriépal.

Disputes broke out during the filming. Cinematographer Russell Metty, a veteran with experience working in big pictures such as Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1946) and &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958) and Howard Hawks&#x27;s &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938), complained about Kubrick&#x27;s unusually precise and detailed instructions for the film&#x27;s camerawork, and disagreed with Kubrick&#x27;s use of light. On one occasion, he threatened to quit to Ed Muhl, to which Kubrick told him: &quot;You can do your job by sitting in your chair and shutting up. I&#x27;ll be the director of photography.&quot; Metty later won the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Kubrick wanted to shoot at a slow pace of two camera set-ups a day, but the studio insisted that he do 32; a compromise of eight had to be made. Kubrick and Trumbo fought constantly over the screenplay. Kubrick complained that the character of Spartacus had no faults or quirks.

Despite the film being a huge box-office success, gaining four Oscars, and being considered to rank among the very best of historical epics, Kubrick later distanced himself from it. Although his personal mark is a distinct part of the final picture, his contract did not give him complete control over the filming, the only occasion he did not exercise such control over one of his films.

=== Music ===
The original score for &quot;Spartacus&quot; was composed and conducted by six-time Academy Award-nominee Alex North. It was nominated by the American Film Institute for its list of greatest film scores. It is a textbook example of how modernist compositional styles can be adapted to the Hollywood &quot;leitmotif&quot; technique. North&#x27;s score is epic, as befits the scale of the film. After extensive research of music of that period, North gathered a collection of antique instruments, while not authentically Roman, that provided a strong dramatic effect. These instruments included a sarrusophone, Israeli recorder, Chinese oboe, lute, mandolin, Yugoslav flute, kythara, dulcimer, and bagpipes. North&#x27;s prize instrument was the ondioline, similar to an earlier version of the electronic synthesizer, which had never been used in film before. Much of the music is written without a tonal center, or flirts with tonality in ways that most film composers would not risk. One theme is used to represent both slavery and freedom but is given different values in different scenes so that it sounds like different themes. The love theme for Spartacus and Varinia is the most accessible theme in the film, and a harsh trumpet figure was created for Crassus.

A soundtrack album was released on LP in 1960, containing selections from the score totaling 41 minutes. This album was released on CD in 1990, to coincide with the film&#x27;s restoration. Soon after, Varèse Sarabande Records attempted to re-record 75 minutes of highlights from the score personally chosen by North, to be conducted by his friend and fellow film composer Jerry Goldsmith, but the project was delayed multiple times and remained unrecorded when Goldsmith died in 2004.

In 2010, Varèse Sarabande released a limited collector&#x27;s edition of 5,000 copies, containing six CDs, one DVD, and a 168-page booklet. The first disc contained all 72 minutes of the score that survived in stereo, including all music from the 1960 album. Discs two and three featured the entire score to the film, in mono. Disc four contained alternate and preliminary cues from the original recording sessions. Discs five and six contained re-recordings of the film&#x27;s iconic love theme, adapted by numerous modern film composers and other musicians. The DVD contained a documentary interviewing those same musicians about the score&#x27;s impact.

=== Political commentary, Christianity, and reception ===
The film parallels 1950s American history, specifically House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings and the civil rights movement. The HUAC hearings, where witnesses were pressured to &quot;name names&quot; of communists and communist sympathizers, mirror the climactic scene as the defeated slaves, ordered by Crassus to identify their leader from the multitude, individually stand up and proclaim, &quot;I&#x27;m Spartacus&quot;. Howard Fast, author of the original novel, had written &quot;Spartacus&quot; while in prison for refusing to name names to HUAC investigators. The fight to end segregation and to extend equality to African Americans is symbolized in the racial mixing in the gladiatorial school, as well as in the army of Spartacus, where all must battle for freedom. Another allusion to the political situation in the United States is hinted at in the beginning, when Rome is described as a republic &quot;fatally stricken with a disease called human slavery&quot;, describing Spartacus as a &quot;proud, rebellious son dreaming of the death of slavery, 2000 years before it finally would die&quot;. Thus an ethical and political vision becomes a philosophical framework for the ensuing action.

The introductory voice-over also describes Rome as destined to collapse with the rise of Christianity:

In the last century before the birth of the new faith called Christianity, which was destined to overthrow the pagan tyranny of Rome and bring about a new society, the Roman Republic stood at the very center of the civilized world. &quot;Of all things fairest&quot; sang the poet, &quot;First among cities and home of the Gods is Golden Rome.&quot; Yet even at the zenith of her pride and power, the Republic lay fatally stricken with the disease called human slavery. The age of the dictator was at hand, waiting in shadows for the event to bring it forth. In that same century, in the conquered Greek province of Thrace, an illiterate slave woman added to her master&#x27;s wealth by giving birth to a son whom she names Spartacus. A proud, rebellious son, who was sold to living death in the mines of Libya, before his 13th birthday. There, under whip and chain and sun, he lived out his youth and his young manhood, dreaming the death of slavery 2000 years before it finally would die.

Thus, Rome is described as an oppressive state suffering from its own excesses in the years before the adoption of Christian beliefs begins to end Roman oppression and slavery.

While the film&#x27;s release occasioned applause from the mainstream media, it sparked protest from right-wing and anticommunist groups such as the National Legion of Decency, which picketed theaters exhibiting the film. The controversy over its &quot;legitimacy as an expression of national aspirations&quot; continued until newly elected US President John F. Kennedy crossed a picket line set up by anti-communist organizers to attend the film.

== Release ==

The film opened to the public on October 6, 1960, at the DeMille Theatre in New York City after four days of invitational previews. It played just 188 theatres in the United States and Canada in its first year and played for over a year at the DeMille before moving to the RKO Palace and opening in the New York circuit theaters around Thanksgiving 1961.

The film was re-released in 1967, without 23 minutes that had been in the original release. For the 1991 release, the same 23 minutes were restored by Robert A. Harris, as were another five minutes that had been cut from the film before its original release.

=== 1991 restoration ===
The idea for the film&#x27;s restoration came about after the American Cinematheque asked Universal Pictures for a print of &quot;Spartacus&quot; for its three-day (October 13–15, 1989) celebratory festival honoring The Bryna Company and Kirk Douglas&#x27; executive producer accomplishments. They were later informed that the original negatives had been cut twice and the colors were badly faded. Steven Spielberg gave his backing to the restoration effort and recommended that Stanley Kubrick be informed of the project. Kubrick, who had disowned the film, gave his approval to the effort and participated by providing detailed instructions through long-distance communication via phone and fax machine from London. Kubrick&#x27;s print of the film, which was donated to the Museum of Modern Art, could not be used for the restoration because it was considered archival. The original studio black-and-white separation prints, used as a backup in 1960, were used, though the processing lab had to develop a new lens capable of printing the Technirama frame without losing fidelity. The restoration cost about $1 million.

A team of 30 archivists restored several violent battle sequences that had been left out because of the negative reaction of preview audiences. Among the deleted footage was a bath scene in which the Roman patrician and general Crassus attempts to seduce his slave Antoninus, speaking about the analogy of &quot;eating oysters&quot; and &quot;eating snails&quot; to express his opinion that sexual preference is a matter of taste rather than morality. The four-minute scene had been removed following an objection by the National Legion of Decency. When the film was restored (two years after Olivier&#x27;s death), the original dialogue recording of this scene was missing; it had to be redubbed. Tony Curtis, by then 66, was able to re-record his part, but Crassus&#x27; voice was an impersonation of Olivier by Anthony Hopkins, who had been suggested by Olivier&#x27;s widow, Joan Plowright. A talented mimic, Hopkins had been a &quot;protégé&quot; of Olivier&#x27;s during Olivier&#x27;s days as the National Theatre&#x27;s artistic director, and had portrayed Crassus in the Jeff Wayne musical album. The actors separately recorded their dialogue.

For the 1991 theatrical re-release, Universal Pictures partnered with the American Film Institute, in which the restored film premiered at the Directors Guild of America Theater in Los Angeles on April 25, with the proceeds going towards the AFI Preservation Fund and the Film Foundation. The general release began in Los Angeles, New York City, and Toronto on the following day. On May 3, the release was expanded into an additional 31 cities in the United States and Canada.

=== Home media ===
The film was first released on VHS in 1985 by MCA Home Video in a reconstructed version that reinstated most of the footage cut from subsequent reissues. The restored version was released on VHS by MCA/Universal in November 1991, and was subsequently released on LaserDisc by The Criterion Collection the following year. Criterion would later release the movie on DVD in 2001.

The film was released on Blu-ray in 2010 by Universal Pictures, but this release was panned by critics and fans alike, mainly due to the lackluster picture quality and sound. As a result, this release was highly controversial and did poorly in sales.

In 2015, for its 55th anniversary, the film went through an extensive 4K digital restoration, from a 6K scan of the 1991 reconstruction of the film, in which Robert A. Harris served as consultant. The 2015 restoration is 12 minutes longer and the original, six-channel audio track was also remixed and remastered in 7.1 surround sound. The film was re-released to Blu-ray Disc on October 6, 2015, featuring a 1080p transfer of the 2015 restoration in 2.20:1 aspect ratio and 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound. Special features include a featurette on the 2015 restoration, a 2015 interview with Kirk Douglas, and several features from the Criterion Collection DVD.

On July 21, 2020, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on UHD Blu-ray.

The 2015 restoration had originally been scheduled to have its theatrical premiere in March 2015 at the TCM Classic Film Festival, but was pulled from the festival, and from a July 2015 engagement in Chicago, because the restoration had not been completed in time. The DCP version of the restoration played at Film Forum in New York City, November 4–12, 2015.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Spartacus&quot; was a commercial success upon its release and became the highest-grossing film of 1960. In its first year from 304 dates (including 116 in 25 countries outside the US and Canada), it had grossed $17 million, including nearly $1.5 million from over half a million admission in over a year at the DeMille Theatre. By January 1963, the film had earned theatrical rentals of $14 million in the United States and Canada. The 1967 re-release increased its North American rentals to $14.6 million.

=== Critical response ===

&quot;Variety&quot; declared in a contemporaneous review, &quot;&quot;Spartacus&quot; appears to have what it takes to satisfy the multitudes ... Kubrick has out-DeMilled the old master in spectacle, without ever permitting the story or the people who are at the core of the drama to become lost in the shuffle. He demonstrates here a technical talent and comprehension of human values.&quot; John L. Scott of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the &quot;fabulous cast,&quot; Trumbo&#x27;s &quot;expert screenplay&quot; and &quot;impressive&quot; climactic battle scenes, writing, &quot;Here young director Stanley Kubrick gives notice that from now on he&#x27;s definitely to be reckoned with. His use of cameras and handling of people are very effective and skillful.&quot;

Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;achieves the unlikely triumph of being intimate on a big scale, a lengthy spectacle consistently interesting for reasons that may vary from scene to scene.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; graded the film as &quot;Very Good. A thinking man&#x27;s star-studded spectacle.&quot; Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the protagonist&#x27;s speeches &quot;sound much more like Howard Fast ... talking to himself in the nineteen-fifties than they do like an illiterate warrior of the first century before Christ. What redeems the picture is several stretches of good acting, especially by Peter Ustinov and Laurence Olivier; the intrinsic interestingness of the physical details (accurately scaled interiors of Roman houses, Roman legions marching exactly as they must have marched); and the directorial aplomb of Stanley Kubrick, who handles his crowd scenes with extraordinary grace.&quot; Stanley Kauffmann writing for &quot;The New Republic&quot; said of &quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;entertaining if mindless show, with many well-done scenes, intimate and panoramic.&quot;

Not all reviews were positive. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film a &quot;spotty, uneven drama&quot; that &quot;comes out a romantic mishmash of a strange episode in history. The performances are equally uneven. Mr Douglas sets his blunt, horse-opera style against the toga-clad precision of Mr Laughton and the Roman-nosed gentility of Sir Laurence Olivier.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; found it &quot;disappointing&quot; that &quot;in spite of enormous expenditure, technical resource and an unusually talented team, so much of &quot;Spartacus&quot; falls into the old ruts of cliché and sentiment.&quot; The review noted that Douglas &quot;probably has fewer lines than any other hero in screen history. Unhappily he does not make up for his verbal deficiencies by mobility of countenance, maintaining the same wooden grimace through more than three hours of trial and suffering.&quot; When released, the movie was attacked by both the American Legion and the Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper because of its connection with Trumbo. Hopper stated, &quot;The story was sold to Universal from a book written by a commie and the screen script was written by a commie, so don&#x27;t go to see it.&quot;

Roger Ebert, reviewing the 1991 restored version, gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, &quot;Two things stand up best over the years: the power of the battle spectacles, and the strength of certain performances – especially Olivier&#x27;s fire, Douglas&#x27; strength, and Laughton&#x27;s mild amusement at the foibles of humankind. The most entertaining performance in the movie, consistently funny, is by Ustinov, who upstages everybody when he is onscreen (he won an Oscar).&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The critical consensus states: &quot;Featuring terrific performances and epic action, Kubrick&#x27;s restored swords-and-sandals epic is a true classic.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 87 based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

== &quot;I&#x27;m Spartacus!&quot; ==

In the climactic scene, recaptured slaves are asked to identify Spartacus in exchange for leniency. Spartacus tries to identify himself, but his attempt is thwarted when each of his comrades proclaims himself to be Spartacus, thus sharing his fate. The 2007 documentary &quot;Trumbo&quot; suggests that this scene was meant to dramatize the solidarity of those accused of being Communist sympathizers during the McCarthy era, who refused to implicate others, and thus were blacklisted.

This scene is the basis for an in-joke in Kubrick&#x27;s next film, &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962), where Humbert asks Clare Quilty, &quot;Are you Quilty?&quot; to which he replies, &quot;No, I&#x27;m Spartacus. Have you come to free the slaves or something?&quot; Many subsequent films, television shows, and advertisements have referenced or parodied the iconic scene. One of these is the film &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; (1979), which reverses the situation by depicting an entire group undergoing crucifixion all claiming to be Brian, who, it has just been announced, is eligible for release (&quot;I&#x27;m Brian.&quot; &quot;No, I&#x27;m Brian.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Brian and so&#x27;s my wife.&quot;). Further examples have been documented in David Hughes&#x27; &quot;The Complete Kubrick&quot; and Jon Solomon&#x27;s &quot;The Ancient World in Cinema&quot;.

The audio of the scene was also played at the start of each The Wall Live (2010–2013) tour show as an introduction to the song &quot;In the Flesh?&quot;.
In an episode of the U.S. version of &quot;The Office&quot;, Michael Scott inadvertently reveals he does not understand the point of the &quot;I am Spartacus!&quot; moment. He says, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don&#x27;t know who the real Spartacus is&quot; which he says is what makes the film a &quot;classic whodunit.&quot;

The scene is referenced in the Starz television series, &quot;&quot; (2013), where many of Spartacus&#x27; lieutenants claim to be him while raiding separate areas of the Italian countryside. However, the purpose behind the line is different in this case, as Spartacus and his comrades are attempting to confuse their Roman adversaries about the rebel leader&#x27;s whereabouts.

In the film &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; (1996), drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) uses the catch phrase (as &quot;I am Spartacus&quot;) numerous times to identify himself. He later spontaneously names his signature jazz solo &quot;I am Spartacus&quot; in the studio and then jams to it with Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs). The jazz drum solo was composed by Tom Hanks, the film&#x27;s director.

== In other media ==
In the American TV Show &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Hawkeye and BJ play charades, in which &quot;Spartacus&quot; is referenced. However, &quot;M*A*S*H*&quot; takes place during the Korean War, which ended in 1953, a full seven years before &quot;Spartacus&quot; was released, thereby making BJ&#x27;s reference to &quot;Spartacus&quot; an historical impossibility.

<text>Livor mortis (), postmortem lividity (), hypostasis () or suggillation, is the second stage of death and one of the signs of death. It is a settling of the blood in the lower, or dependent, portion of the body postmortem, causing a purplish red discoloration of the skin. When the heart stops functioning and is no longer agitating the blood, heavy red blood cells sink through the serum by action of gravity. The blood travels faster in warmer conditions and slower in colder conditions.

Livor mortis starts within 20–30 minutes, but is usually not observable by the human eye until two hours after death. The size of the patches increases in the next three to six hours. Fixation will begin to occur during this timeframe, causing the patches to be unaltered due to movement. Maximum lividity will occur between eight and twelve hours after death. Areas of blood pooling in contact with the ground will blanch, or remain white. The blood pools into the interstitial tissues of the body. The intensity of the color depends upon the amount of reduced haemoglobin in the blood. The discoloration does not occur in the areas of the body that are in contact with the ground or another object, in which capillaries are compressed.

==Applicability==
Coroners can use the presence or absence of livor mortis as a means of determining an approximate time of death. It can also be used by forensic investigators to determine whether or not a body has been moved. For instance, if the body is found lying prone, but the pooling is present on the deceased&#x27;s back, investigators can conclude that the body was originally positioned supine. The colour of the pooling can help in determining cause of death. Carbon monoxide poisoning causes a red colouration.

Among coroners and other investigators, such as homicide and forensic detectives, livor mortis is not considered an exact way to measure time of death, but rather as a method of approximating it. Livor mortis, along with algor mortis, rigor mortis, and practices such as forensic entomology are frequently combined by investigators to more accurately pinpoint the estimated time of death.

Countries and territories using the number include Bahrain, Bangladesh, Botswana, Cook Island, Eswatini, Ghana, Guernsey, Hong Kong, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Kenya, Macau, Malaysia, Mauritius, Niue, Poland, Qatar, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Trinidad and Tobago, Seychelles, Uganda, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and Zimbabwe.

==United Kingdom==

999 is the official emergency number for the United Kingdom, but calls are also accepted on the European Union emergency number, 112. All calls are answered by 999 operators, and are always free. Approximately 35 million 999/112 calls are made in the UK each year, with 74% from mobiles and 26% from landlines in 2022.

===Emergency services===

In the United Kingdom there are four emergency services which maintain full-time emergency control centres (ECC), to which 999 emergency calls may be directly routed by emergency operators in telephone company operator assistance centres (OAC). These services are as follows, listed in the order of percentage of calls received:
* Ambulance
* Police
* Fire
* HM Coastguard

Other emergency services may also be reached through the 999 system, but do not maintain permanent emergency control centres. All of these emergency services are summoned through the ECC of one of the four principal services listed above:
* Lifeboat
* Mountain rescue
* Cave rescue
* Mine rescue
* Bomb disposal (provided by HM Armed Forces)

===History===
First introduced in the London area on 30 June 1937, the UK&#x27;s 999 number is the world&#x27;s oldest emergency call telephone service. The system was introduced following a house fire in Wimpole Street on 10 November 1935, in which five women were killed. A neighbour had tried to telephone the fire brigade and was so outraged at being held in a queue by the Welbeck telephone exchange that he wrote a letter to the editor of &quot;The Times&quot;, which prompted a government inquiry.

The initial scheme covered a radius around Oxford Circus and the public were advised only to use it in an ongoing emergency if &quot;for instance, the man in the flat next to yours is murdering his wife or you have seen a heavily masked cat burglar peering round the stack pipe of the local bank building.&quot; The first arrest – for burglary – took place a week later and the scheme was extended to major cities after World War II and then to the whole of the UK in 1976.

The 9-9-9 format was chosen based on the &#x27;button A&#x27; and &#x27;button B&#x27; design of pre-payment coin-operated public payphones in wide use (first introduced in 1925) which could be easily modified to allow free use of the 9 digit on the rotary dial in addition to the 0 digit (then used to call the operator), without allowing free use of numbers involving other digits; other combinations of free call 9 and 0 were later used for more purposes, including multiples of 9 (to access exchanges before subscriber trunk dialling came into use) as a fail-safe for attempted emergency calls, e.g. 9 or 99, reaching at least an operator.

The choice of 999 was fortunate for accessibility, because in the dark or in dense smoke 999 could be dialled by placing a finger one hole away from the dial stop (see the articles on rotary dial and GPO telephones) and rotating the dial to the full extent three times. This enables all users including the visually impaired to easily dial the emergency number. It is also the case that it is relatively easy for 111, and other low-number sequences, to be called accidentally, including when transmission wires making momentary contact produce a pulse similar to dialling (e.g. when overhead cables touch in high winds).

Hoax calls and improper use are a problem. For these reasons, there are frequent public information campaigns in the UK on the correct use of the 999 system.

Alternative three-digit numbers for non-emergency calls have also been introduced in recent years. 101 was introduced for non-urgent calls to Police in England and Wales and later extended to Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Trials of 111 as a number to access health services in the UK for urgent but not life-threatening cases began in England in 2010. The main roll-out was originally meant to be finished by April 2013 but was not completed until February 2014. In Scotland, the NHS24 service moved from 0845 424 2424 to 111 on 29 April 2014. NHS 111 Wales (formally NHS Direct Wales) can now be accessed through the 111 number. It previously used 0845 46 47 but the rollout of 111 was completed, following trials starting in 2016 

In 2008–2009, Nottinghamshire Police ran a successful pilot of &quot;Pegasus&quot;, a database containing the details of people with physical and learning disabilities or mental health problems, who have registered with the force because their disabilities make it difficult for them to give spoken details when calling the police. Those registered on the database are issued with a personal identification number (PIN) that can be used in two ways. By phone – either 999 or the force&#x27;s non-emergency 101 number can be used – once a person is put through to the control room, they only need to say &quot;Pegasus&quot; and their PIN. Their details can then be retrieved from the database and the caller can quickly get on with explaining why they have called. In person – the &quot;Pegasus&quot; PIN can be told or shown to a police officer. Pegasus is also used by the City of London Police, Dyfed Powys Police, Surrey Police &amp; Lincolnshire Police.

The use of push-button telephones can cause problems, because it is easy to push the same button repeatedly by accident, e.g. by objects in the same pocket as the telephone (termed &#x27;pocket dialling&#x27;) or by children playing with it. This problem is less of a concern with emergency numbers that use two different digits, such as 112 and 911, although on landlines 112 suffers much of the same risk of false generation as the 111 code which was considered and rejected when the original choice of 999 was made.

The pan-European 112 code was introduced in the UK in April 1995 with little publicity. It connects to existing 999 circuits. The GSM standard mandates that a user can dial 112 without unlocking the keypad, which can save time but also causes some accidental calls.

Silent solution 55 is the name given to the initiative that allows people to call 999 when they are not able to speak. If the caller does not initially respond to opening questions, the operator will then ask the caller to cough, tap their handset or make another audible sign that indicates they are in need of emergency assistance. In some instances where there is still no clear response, the call may be put through to an automated system which asks the caller to press 55 if in danger.

===Procedure===
999 or 112 is used to contact the emergency services upon witnessing or being involved in an emergency. In the United Kingdom, the numbers 999 and 112 both connect to the same service, and there is no priority or charge for either of them. Calls to 911, North America&#x27;s emergency number, may be transferred to the 999 call system if the call is made within the United Kingdom from a mobile phone.

An emergency can be:
* A person in need of immediate medical assistance, or an immediate danger to life
* Suspicion that a crime is in progress, or that an offender is in the area
* Structure on fire
* Another serious incident which needs immediate emergency service attendance

All telecoms providers operating in the UK are obliged as part of their licence agreement to provide a free of charge emergency operator service. emergency calls made on any network in the UK are handled by BT. BT operates seven call centres nationally to take 999/112 calls.

When 999 or 112 is dialled an operator will answer the call and ask, &quot;Emergency. Which service?&quot; Previously operators asked &quot;Which service do you require?&quot; (approximately up to the mid-90s).

The operator will then transfer the call to the appropriate service&#x27;s own call-taker. If the caller is unsure as to which service they require, the operator will transfer the call to the police, and if an incident requires more than one service, for instance a road traffic accident with injuries and trapped people, one service will alert the others. (The operator has to contact each service individually, whether or not the caller remains on the line.) The caller will be connected to the service which covers the area that they are (or appear to be) calling from.

On 6 October 1998, BT introduced a new system whereby all the information about the location of the calling telephone was transmitted electronically to the relevant service rather than having to be read out (with the possibility of errors). This system is called EISEC (Enhanced Information Service for Emergency Calls). Before it, the operator had to start the connection to the emergency service control room by stating their own location, then the caller&#x27;s telephone number, e.g. &quot;Bangor connecting 01248 300 000&quot;. It was common for the caller to be confused why the operator was talking to the emergency service, and frequently talked over the operator. Only around half of the emergency authorities have EISEC, although the number is ever increasing.

Although the initial response to all 999 calls is in English, callers who reply in Welsh are transferred to the Bangor control room where the call will be taken by Welsh-speaking operators.

The rooms in which operators work are called operator assistance centres (OACs). There are six BT OACs. The rooms in which emergency response operators work are called emergency control centres (ECCs) and are operated by local authorities.

In some situations there may be specific instructions on nearby signs to notify some other authority of an emergency before calling 999. For example, railway bridges may carry signs advising that if a road vehicle strikes the bridge the railway authority (usually Network Rail) should be called first on a given number. Network Rail has its own procedures to alert trains to the emergency and to stop them if necessary. The instructions on the signs state 999 should then be dialled and that the police should be requested.

Access to the 999/112 service is provided for the hearing-impaired via Textphone and use of the Text Relay service, run by BT to cover all telephone providers, and previously known as the RNID &quot;Typetalk&quot; relay service. The number is 18000.

999 is also accessible via SMS for pre-registered users. The service is open for anyone to register and works with all major providers in the UK.

===Location===
The caller&#x27;s location will not be passed onto the emergency services immediately, but it is possible to trace both landline and mobile telephone numbers with the BT operator; the former can be traced to an address. The latter can be immediately traced to a grid reference according to the transmitter being used. However, this is only accurate to a certain wide area – for more specific traces, authority must be sought and an expensive operation can be conducted to trace the mobile phone to within a few metres. A number of smartphone apps can now be downloaded that assist with caller location by using the smartphone&#x27;s satellite navigation features.

Since 2014, smartphones which implement Advanced Mobile Location will detect that an emergency call is being placed, and use any available location services (WiFi or GPS based location) to send an emergency SMS containing an identifier for the call and the phone&#x27;s location, accurate to 30 metres. This is intended to be received by the mobile operator whilst the call is in progress.

On some occasions callers will be put through to the wrong area service – this is called a &quot;misrouted nines&quot;. The most common reason for this is when a mobile phone calls 999 and is using a radio transmitter that is located in another force area; most frequently these are calls that are made within a few miles of a border. Upon establishing the incident location, the emergency service operator will relay the information to the responsible force for their dispatch. In most areas, forces will respond to incidents just beyond their border if they could get there quicker, assist, and then hand over to other forces when they arrive.

On strategic routes like almost all motorways and some major A roads in the United Kingdom, National Highways have placed blue driver location signs with the location printed on them, at approximately 500-metre intervals. Although emergency SOS phones are placed along the hard shoulder on all motorways (and in emergency refuge areas on smart motorways) which automatically send location information to the National Highways regional control centre (RCC), most people involved in a road emergency call from their mobile phones and so need another way to identify their location. These signs contain a code which can be given to the emergency operator or the RCC. For example, a sign may say &quot;M1 A 100.5&quot;. This translates as the M1 motorway, on the &quot;A&quot; carriageway, at 100.5 kilometres from the M1&#x27;s nominal start at Staples Corner. The &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; carriageways are designated by Highways England to each carriageway, dependent upon which direction it travels; these normally refer to whether the carriageway goes &quot;Away from London&quot; or &quot;Back to London&quot;. On circular motorways like the London Orbital M25 and M60 Manchester Outer Ring Road, the clockwise carriageway is the A carriageway and the anti-clockwise carriageway is the B carriageway. Letters J, K, L and M refer to slip roads at junctions. These signs are in addition to the pre-existing 100m distance marker posts alongside the carriageway.

===Abandoned and hoax calls===
An abandoned call is when a caller, intentionally or otherwise, rings 999 and then ends the call or stays silent. Abandoned calls are filtered by emergency operators BT and Cable &amp; Wireless, and are either disconnected or passed on to police.

They are normally disconnected by the operator repeating &quot;Emergency. Which service?&quot;, then if no response is given, the operator will say &quot;Do you need police, fire or ambulance?&quot;. If there is still no response, the operator will sometimes ask the caller to press the keypad or make a noise if they need assistance. If no response is given, they will confirm they are clearing the line.

For abandoned calls, if the caller requests the police and the call is routed to police and then the line is dropped, either while waiting for connection or on the line with police, they are checked by police and called back. If there is no answer, the police service are likely to attend and if the line is disconnected without the caller telling the operator which service they need, they then make a decision to filter the call to police (if suspicious background noise) or clear the line.

The most common reasons for abandoned calls include:
* Accidental dialling of 999 on mobile phones. As a GSM standard, mobile phones still allow emergency calls to be made even with the keypad locked.
* Faulty phone lines.
* Believing an urban myth that says dialling 999 charges mobile phone batteries.

==Ireland==
In Ireland, 999 (and the European and GSM standard 112) are the national emergency numbers. The 999 and 112 service is able to respond in English, Irish, Polish, French, German and Italian. 999 and 112 operators in Ireland answer the calls in under one second and say &quot;Emergency, which service?&quot;. The caller may then request the Gardaí (the Irish police), ambulance, fire service, coast guard, or cave and mountain rescue service. The caller is then transferred to the emergency dispatcher for the appropriate service.

==Gibraltar==

In 2024, Gibraltar adopted 999 as its emergency services number, for police, ambulance or fire and rescue; the Royal Gibraltar Police said this was chosen because the territory was closely aligned with the UK, with the aim in future being to have a unified control room. Previously, 199, along with 112, had been used for the police, with 190 being used for fire and ambulance services.

==Bangladesh==
In Bangladesh, 999 is the national emergency number. It officially launched on 12 December 2017. This number is toll-free. Calling this number connects the caller to an operator, who then connects the caller to the police, ambulance or fire service.

The services are provided under a national emergency help desk operated by the Bangladesh Police, which has been set up at a cost of Tk 60.50 crore. Although the &#x27;National Emergency Service 999&#x27; is operated by the Bangladesh Police, fire service and civil defense personnel and the ambulance service dispatchers of the Department of Health also work closely with the police 24/7 to ensure proper service.

In the past, dialling 100 would connect to Bangladesh Police, 101 to Rapid Action Battalion, 102 to fire services, 103 to ambulance service and 104 to the Access to Information Programme under the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office.

==Hong Kong and Macau==
999 was introduced to Hong Kong for emergency services (Police, Fire-fighting Services and Ambulance Services) during British rule and continues to be used following the transfer of sovereignty.

Macau also adopted the 999 number; it also introduced two emergency hotline numbers: 110 (mainly for tourists from mainland China) and 112 (mainly for tourists from overseas).

The worldwide emergency number for GSM mobile phones, 112, also works on all GSM networks in the territories. Calls made to this number are redirected to the 999 call centre.

==Malaysia==
The 999 emergency services in Malaysia is staffed by about 138 telephonists from Telekom Malaysia. Like Singapore, the number was inherited from British rule and continued after independence. Ongoing upgrading works are taking place to introduce the Computer-Telephony Integration (CTI) for hospital exchanges, digital mapping to track the callers&#x27; locations and Computer Assisted Despatching (CAD) for online connectivity among the agencies providing the emergency services in the country. All calls to the number are made free of charge. In the late 90s, the number 994 was adopted as a direct connection to fire stations, but use of the number has been discontinued due to cost-saving measures taken by the government. 991 connects to civil services.

The worldwide emergency number for GSM mobile phones, 112, also works on all GSM networks in the country. Calls made to this number are redirected to the 999 call centre.

==Mauritius==
Mauritius uses the 999 emergency number for police contact only. The other emergency numbers in use are 114 for emergency medical assistance and 115 for the fire service.

==Poland==
The 112 emergency number is an all-service number in Poland like in other EU states, but old numbers that were traditionally designated for emergencies are still in use parallel to 112. Those are 999 for ambulance, 998 for fire brigade and 997 for police.

==United Arab Emirates==
In the United Arab Emirates, the 999 service is used to contact the police who are also capable of forwarding the call as appropriate to the ambulance or fire services. The number 998 connects directly to the ambulance service and 997 to the fire brigade.

==Singapore==
In Singapore, the number 999 was inherited from British rule and continued after independence. The number is attributed more to requesting for the police, with the number 995, established in 1984, used for direct lines to the fire brigade and ambulance services of the Singapore Civil Defence Force. Because most of the population of Singapore is Chinese, it is likely that 995 was adopted because the Chinese pronunciation for that number (九九五, jiǔ jiǔ wǔ) sounds similar to the Chinese phrase for &#x27;Save me&#x27; (救救我, jiù jiù wǒ).

==Eswatini==
The Kingdom of Eswatini uses the 999 emergency number for police contact only, and 975 for human trafficking reports. The other emergency numbers in use are 977 for emergency medical assistance and 933 for the fire service.

==Trinidad and Tobago==
In Trinidad and Tobago, 999 is used to contact the police only. The number 811 is used for the ambulance service and 990 for the fire brigade.

==Uganda==
In Uganda, callers can call the police on either 112 or 999.

==Canada==
* In 1959, Winnipeg, Manitoba (16 municipalities) used 9-9-9 as the first North American deployment of a local unified emergency number. North America later standardised on 9-1-1, with +1-204-999-xxxx eventually reassigned as a standard mobile telephone exchange. Even in 2022, dialling 9-9-9 in certain areas of Canada, e.g., Gatineau, QC, may be transferred to the 911 call system.

<text>Mottram in Longdendale or Mottram is a village in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England. It lies west of Hadfield and east of Hyde. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, and became part of Greater Manchester in 1974. Mottram in Longdendale was an ancient parish, which covered an extensive area of north-east Cheshire until it was split into smaller parishes in the 19th century. Mottram lies in Longdendale, the valley of the River Etherow, and is close to the border with Derbyshire.

==History==
In 1795, John Aikin described Mottram as follows:
In the 18th century the River Etherow was known as the Mersey. The River Tame has been a border from the earliest times between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia. The ancient parish was the most northerly in Cheshire.

Mottram came to prominence as a transport hub. It lies on two pack horse routes used to carry salt from Cheshire to South Yorkshire over the Pennines and carry lime for soil improvement from Chapel-en-le-Frith. It was on the stagecoach route between Manchester and Sheffield. Before the Industrial Revolution, Mottram and Ashton-under-Lyne had been the most significant towns in the area. The manor and manorial court house were in Mottram, but other towns eclipsed Mottram in size and importance. Mottram was active in the early stages of industrialisation, and there were significant cotton spinning mills in Wedneshough Green and the Treacle Street areas of Mottram Moor, and printing and dyeing works on the Etherow at Broadbottom which until recently was part of the parish.
The smaller early mills in Mottram became uneconomic and harder to run. Stalling industrialisation led to social conflict and hunger during 1812 Luddite riots that led to the smashing of labour-reducing machines. The Luddites secretly drilled on Wedneshough Green. In 1842 local Chartists met on the green, and planned the closure of Stalybridge factories in the Plug Riots. By 1860 the population had peaked.

The Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway was built in the early 1840s, passing along Longdendale. Broadbottom railway station opened in 1842; it was in the township of Mottram, but at the foot of the hill, a mile south of the village centre. The station was called &#x27;Mottram&#x27; between 1845 and 1884, then &#x27;Mottram and Broadbottom&#x27; between 1884 and 1954, after which it reverted to just &#x27;Broadbottom&#x27;.

A Polish pilot, Josef Gawkowski, was killed on 19 July 1942 when his aircraft crashed near Mottram on a training flight from RAF Newton in Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque commemorating him is in Mottram Cemetery.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Mottram, at metropolitan borough level: Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council. The council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Greater Manchester. Mottram forms part of the Longdendale ward of Tameside.

===Administrative history===

Mottram in Longdendale was an ancient parish within the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. The parish was subdivided into eight townships: Godley, Hattersley, Hollingworth, Matley, Newton, Stayley, Tintwistle, and a Mottram township which covered the area around the village itself and Broadbottom to the south. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Mottram in Longdendale, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so the townships also became separate civil parishes.

A Mottram in Longdendale local government district was established in 1873, just covering the Mottram township, administered by an elected local board. Such districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

Mottram in Longdendale Urban District was abolished in 1936 to become part of the new Longdendale Urban District. In 1931 (the last census before the abolition of the urban district), Mottram in Longdendale had a population of 2,636. Longdendale Urban District was in turn abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside in Greater Manchester.

==Geography==

Mottram occupies an elevated site straddling the A57 trunk road from the end of the M67 to the junction with the A628 trunk road. It is east of Manchester, on land between 150m to 250m above mean sea level. The geology is mainly boulder clay above millstone grit, but there are small outcrops of coal at the edge of the Lancashire Coalfield. To the south and east of Mottram is the River Etherow and to the west is the Hurstclough Brook.

Mottram is classed as part of the built-up area of Hadfield (the main part of which is in Derbyshire) by the Office for National Statistics. The Ordnance Survey labels the village &#x27;Mottram in Longdendale&#x27; on its maps, but the Royal Mail uses the shorter form &#x27;Mottram&#x27; for the postal locality, which is part of the Hyde post town.

===Longdendale bypass proposal===

The A628 trunk road connects the M67 motorway from Manchester to the M1 motorway in South Yorkshire. The road is single-carriageway through Mottram, Hollingworth and Tintwistle and through the Peak District National Park, it is used by large numbers of heavy goods vehicles. It is one of the most congested A-road routes in the country, with high volumes of traffic (including HGVs) using a road which is totally unsuitable for the volume and nature of traffic it carries The A628 through Mottram carries traffic from the A57 road linking Manchester through Glossop to Sheffield over the Snake Pass, another major Trans-Pennine route. Congestion at peak times backs up through Glossop and Hadfield rendering local journeys impossible. To solve these problems the Longdendale Bypass was approved in December 2014, but has not yet been started. There is considerable local feeling that there is no viable alternative to a bypass.
==Landmarks==
St Michael and All Angels Church dates from the late 15th century. The church is a Grade II* Listed Building, built in the Perpendicular Gothic style. The interior of St. Michael&#x27;s was remodelled in 1854 but the exterior remains intact from the 15th and 16th centuries. The church stands high up on Warhill overlooking the village. In 2010, vandals destroyed the church&#x27;s windows which led to cork boards being used as replacements.

Mottram Old Hall is a country house in Old Hall Lane which dates to 1727 and was once occupied by the Hollingworth family.

==Sport==
Mottram Cricket Club plays in the Greater Manchester Cricket League. The club was founded in 1860.

==Notable people==
*Sir Edmund Shaa was a goldsmith, and Lord Mayor of London in 1482, dying there 20 April 1488. He appeared as a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot;, and a bequest was used to found Stockport Grammar School.
*Lawrence Earnshaw (c.1707–12 May 1767) was an inventor and machine-maker, who made an astronomical clock, and a machine to spin and reel cotton in one operation.

*John Chapman (1810–1877) was MP for Grimsby, High Sheriff of Cheshire, JP and Chairman of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. He lived in Broadbottom.
*The Stretford-born artist L.S. Lowry lived in Mottram from 1948 until his death in 1976. A bronze statue of him seated on a bench is located next to the junction of Hyde Road and Stalybridge Road, and there is a commemorative plaque on his former home, &quot;The Elms&quot; on Stalybridge Road.

Famous former residents also include Kathy Staff (aka Nora Batty from the sitcom &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;) and Harold Shipman, the UK&#x27;s most prolific serial killer.

<text>Substance intoxication is a transient condition of altered consciousness and behavior associated with recent use of a substance. It is often maladaptive and , but reversible. If the symptoms are severe, the term &quot;substance intoxication delirium&quot; may be used. Slang terms for the state include: getting &quot;high (generic), and being stoned, cooked, or fried&quot; (usually in reference to cannabis).

Substance intoxication may often accompany a substance use disorder (SUD); if persistent substance-related problems exist, SUD is the preferred diagnosis.

The term &quot;intoxication&quot; in common use most often refers to alcohol intoxication, or drug addiction usually opioids consisting of an overdose; resulting in death.

==Classification==
The ICD-10 &quot;Mental and Behavioural Disorders due to psychoactive substance use&quot; shows:
* F10. alcohol
* F11. opioids
* F12. cannabinoids
* F13. sedatives and hypnotics
* F14. cocaine
* F15. caffeine
* F16. hallucinogens
* F17. tobacco
* F18. volatile solvent
* F19. multiple drug use and use of other psychoactive substances

===Caffeine===
The discussion over whether the coffee (caffeine) &quot;buzz&quot; counted as intoxication or not was hotly debated during the early to mid 16th century.

=== Contact high ===

Contact high is a phenomenon that occurs in otherwise sober people who experience a drug-like effect just by coming into contact with someone who is under the influence of a psychoactive drug. In a similar way to the &quot;placebo effect&quot;, a contact high may be caused by classical conditioning as well as by the physical and social
setting.

The term is often incorrectly used to describe the high obtained from passive inhalation of marijuana.

==Slang terms==

Slang terms include: getting &quot;high&quot; (generic), being &quot;stoned&quot;, &quot;cooked&quot;, or &quot;blazed&quot; (usually in reference to cannabis), and many more specific slang terms for particular intoxicants. Alcohol intoxication is graded in intensity from &quot;buzzed&quot;, to &quot;tipsy&quot; then &quot;drunk&quot; all the way up to &quot;hammered&quot;, &quot;plastered&quot;, &quot;smashed&quot;, &quot;wasted&quot;, &quot;destroyed&quot;, &quot;shitfaced&quot; and a number of other terms. The term &quot;rolling&quot; is a common word used to describe being under the influence of MDMA and for LSD the phrases &quot;frying&quot; or &quot;tripping&quot; have been used. &quot;Tripping&quot; is a term that is considered applicable to virtually all hallucinogens which includes psychedelics, dissociatives, deliriants and possibly certain types of hypnotics.

<text>Royal Canadian Air Farce (broadcast as Air Farce Live during 2007, and Air Farce—Final Flight! in 2008), and often credited simply as Air Farce, was a Canadian sketch comedy series starring the comedy troupe Royal Canadian Air Farce, that previously starred in an eponymous show on CBC Radio, from 1973 to 1997. The top-rated television show was broadcast on CBC Television, beginning in 1993 and ending in December 2008. The &quot;Air Farce Live&quot; name was adopted in October 2007. For the show&#x27;s final season which began October 3, 2008, the series was renamed &quot;Air Farce—Final Flight!&quot;

The show was a weekly topical sketch comedy series focusing on political and cultural satire and was one of the most popular Canadian television shows. It was initially aired as a radio series beginning in 1973, and on radio, &quot;Air Farce&quot; continued for 24 seasons through 1997. In terms of the troupe&#x27;s TV career, the first Air Farce TV special aired in 1980. A short-lived &quot;Air Farce&quot; TV series was broadcast in 1981, and further TV specials aired in 1982, 1983, and 1984. After a long hiatus from TV, a 1992 New Year&#x27;s Eve special for CBC-TV was well received, and a new Air Farce TV series began in October 1993. The TV series was retitled &quot;Air Farce Live&quot; beginning with the October 6, 2007 broadcast and was the first Canadian sketch comedy series to be broadcast in HD. Despite the name change, the show was broadcast live only in the Atlantic time zone. The other time zones aired the show via tape delay.

In November 1998, original cast members Roger Abbott, Don Ferguson, Luba Goy, and John Morgan received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts.

==Cast history==
The show began as a radio show in 1973, continuing until 1997 when the troupe decided to concentrate on the TV series which began in 1993. &quot;Madly Off in All Directions&quot;, starring Lorne Elliott, replaced the Air Farce radio show on the CBC schedule. Over that time the Air Farce cast has remained relatively stable, with three of the troupe&#x27;s five founders remaining with the program for its entire run.

* Arnold Pinnock (2013), who made a guest appearance in the 2012 New Year&#x27;s Eve special, but was credited as a member for 2013

==Show history==
&quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; began in 1973 as a radio show on CBC Radio. It became one of the radio network&#x27;s most popular programs. Based in Toronto, most of their shows were recorded in CBC&#x27;s Cabbagetown studios; however, as the troupe became more popular, they frequently travelled throughout the country to record their weekly radio broadcasts, which featured a mixture of political and cultural satire.

The Farce troupe recorded a one-hour television special in 1980, which evolved into a ten-week series and two sequel specials. They continued to perform their radio series as the TV series and specials moved forward.

Many of the TV show&#x27;s sketches were actually performed as &quot;radio sketches&quot;—during filming, Air Farce cast members stood on stage in front of microphones reading from scripts, whilst sound effects technician Alex Sinclair could be seen on stage adding sound effects as needed. Other sketches, some quite elaborate, were acted out in full costume as more traditional television sketches. Despite the decent ratings for the initial special, the TV series was received with somewhat lukewarm reviews and ratings. The Air Farce left television after a special in 1984.

In the early 1980s, Air Farce&#x27;s summer radio hiatus periods were filled by another comedy troupe, The Frantics, who later moved on to their own TV series, &quot;Four on the Floor&quot;. Later summer hiatus periods, however, were filled by Ferguson and Abbott playing classic comedy recordings. In the late 1980s, CBC Radio launched another 30-minutes weekly political satire, &quot;Double Exposure&quot;. Though the programmes were never in direct competition, some found the latter show fresher and edgier.

In 1992, Air Farce took a second plunge into television with &quot;1992: Year of the Farce&quot;, a satirical New Year&#x27;s Eve special. For this and all subsequent TV appearances, the troupe abandoned the idea of performing TV sketches as &quot;radio sketches&quot;, and presented their TV work in a traditional TV sketch show format. A ratings smash, the special led the troupe to produce another weekly television series, which debuted in 1993. However, this time the move to television was permanent. The radio series continued alongside the TV show for four seasons until May 1997, when it was discontinued.

The practice of having a New Year&#x27;s Eve special continued through the show&#x27;s entire run, and such episodes were typically titled &quot;Year of the Farce&quot;. Air Farce also frequently had the honour of counting down the seconds before the New Year on CBC, and the show&#x27;s final episode was itself a New Year&#x27;s Eve special.

Recurring characters on the TV series included the slow Albertan Mike from Canmore (Morgan) and angry Scot Jock McBile (Morgan), self-righteous movie critic Gilbert Smythe Bite-Me (Abbott), and chain-smoking bingo player Brenda (Goy). Though these characters would occasionally feature in skits of their own, usually they were used at the beginning of the show to deliver a stream of one liner jokes commentating on the news of that week.

The show also featured frequent skits with politicians, who were portrayed as various extreme caricatures of their most infamous personality quirks. Notable re-occurring figures included Prime Minister Jean Chrétien (Abbott), who could barely speak a single sentence of English without committing at least a dozen outlandish pronunciation and grammatical errors, the nasally-voiced Preston Manning (Ferguson) who loved to shout &quot;REFOOOOOOORM!&quot;, a screaming, bitchy Sheila Copps (Goy), the tyrannical Lucien Bouchard, the dopey and overly-image conscious Stockwell Day, the strutting, clucking, pompous Joe Clark, and the power-hungry Paul Martin (all Ferguson). Many of the real politicians also made guest appearances on the show, often interacting directly with their parodic counterparts.

However, Colonel &quot;Teresa&quot; Stacy (Ferguson) quickly emerged as the show&#x27;s most popular character — each time he appeared, Stacy would load up the Chicken Cannon and fire rubber chickens and other assorted projectiles at whomever he deemed the most annoying public figure of the week (or year).

Morgan retired from Air Farce in 2001, and the remaining three members carried on with a rotating stable of guest stars (usually no more than one per episode). Seen frequently as &quot;special guests&quot; from 2001 to 2003 were Rochelle Wilson, Jessica Holmes, Sean Cullen, Peter Keleghan, Janet van de Graaff, James Roussel, Craig Lauzon and Elvira Kurt. Holmes&#x27; appearances became more frequent as time went by, especially by the beginning of the 2003–04 season. In December 2003, she officially joined the show, adding celebrity figures such as Paris Hilton and Liza Minnelli, and Canadian politicians such as Belinda Stronach, to the troupe&#x27;s roster of characters.

Later, in 2005, after a lockout at CBC, Air Farce gained two new cast members, who had previously appeared on the show as recurring guest stars: Alan Park and Craig Lauzon. The addition of these two newcomers brought the total number of performers in the troupe to six.

While the show was widely regarded as a Canadian institution, some critics have felt that the television show&#x27;s quality has diminished over the past few seasons, especially since the breakdown of the original four-actor quartet. However, it still continued to draw solid ratings each week. On March 30, 2007, the Air Farce celebrated their 300th episode by doing the show on live television (except in Western Canada) for one hour. Roger Abbott and Luba Goy began the show with a brief history of the show, closing with &quot;the scariest three words on television: AIR FARCE LIVE!&quot;.

After this experimental episode, CBC announced that the 15th season of the series would be aired live for the entire season, with a name change to &quot;Air Farce Live&quot;.

The final season retained its live format, but was renamed as &quot;Air Farce: Final Flight&quot;.

===End of series===

&quot;Air Farce&quot; remained popular through its radio run and initially as a TV series, but over the years interest in the show began to drop and its ratings fell.

On April 1, 2008, the CBC and Air Farce announced that &quot;Air Farce Live&quot; would end in the 2008/2009 season. Nine new shows, titled Air Farce—Final Flight! aired from October 3, 2008, to December 5, 2008, with the New Year&#x27;s Eve special as the tenth show and series finale.

A special feature of the final season of shows was &quot;Air Farce Flashback&quot;, featuring a memorable segment from the previous 15 seasons of the Air Farce series. The New Year&#x27;s Eve Grand Finale featured in the Air Farce Flashback segment highlights from several segments of Air Farce sketches over the years.

The final hour-long episode aired December 31, 2008, at 8:00 PM Eastern Time. It featured special guests Ron MacLean, Peter Mansbridge, and former Air Farce member Dave Broadfoot. The final episode was viewed by over 1.5 million viewers.

===Specials===
In December 2009, it was announced that the Air Farce would return for a New Year&#x27;s Eve 2009 special, featuring the return of most of the original staff (excluding Jessica Holmes, Gord Holtham, and Rick Olsen), guest appearances by Peter Mansbridge, &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot; winners Jamie Salé and Craig Simpson, and the Dragons of &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot;. The special also featured the successor to the Chicken Cannon, &quot;F-Bombs,&quot; which were dropped onto photographs from the top of the atrium of the Canadian Broadcasting Centre.

On December 16–17, 2010, the Royal Canadian Air Farce 2010 New Year special was taped. It aired December 31, 2010. The cast included Jessica Holmes, who returned for the 60 minute show as Yogi Gurt and Celine Dion.

Moved to New Year&#x27;s Day due to &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, the &quot;Air Farce Not the New Year&#x27;s Eve Special&quot; aired on January 1, 2012. Jessica Holmes did not return for this special due to a prior commitment. This was the first Air Farce special that did not feature the late Roger Abbott in its cast, who had died earlier in 2011.

In 2017, a Canada Day special aired, in celebration of the 150th anniversary of Confederation, as well as a year-end special. While ratings for the specials remained strong, drawing over a million viewers in 2017 and 2018, the CBC informed the troupe in May 2019 that due to budgetary constraints, the 2019 year-end special would be the final edition in the series, as a farewell show combining new material looking at 2019 in review and archival material from the troupe&#x27;s past, including clips of deceased members Roger Abbott and John Morgan.
==Sketches==

===Recurring sketches===
Some of the recurring sketches on Air Farce include:
*&quot;Ad Absurdum&quot;, where Goy remarks on the terrible commercials aired on Canadian television.
*&quot;Driving with Alan Park&quot;, a modified version of &quot;Not the Official Story&quot; where Alan Park is now shown driving in a car instead of in front of his computer.
**This show aired after the 2005 CBC Lockout
*&quot;A Canadian Moment&quot;, featuring the entire cast as regulars in a coffee shop. The sketch always ends with the characters saying their catchphrases (&quot;You got that right&quot; for Ferguson, &quot;You betcha&quot; for Morgan, &quot;Tell me about it&quot; for Goy, &quot;Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah&quot; for Abbott as he pours sugar into his coffee, and &quot;Totally&quot; for Holmes, typically in that order). This was the final sketch in the New Year&#x27;s Eve grand finale in which the coffee shop owner, played by Broadfoot, closes the donut shop permanently and kicks out the regulars at closing time.
*&quot;Brenda the Bingo Lady&quot;, where a middle-aged woman (Goy) vents her opinions about current issues while playing a game of bingo alongside her husband (Abbott). Each sketch often invariably ends with the husband, who is named Sid, winning, despite playing only one bingo card to Brenda&#x27;s numerous cards.
*&quot;B.S. 2000&quot;, where the cast of Air Farce portray various particular Canadian newspeople as they put their spin on the 2000 federal election. At the end of a sketch, they would &quot;poll&quot; the public (another cast member playing an anonymous Canadian) and give its results, the gag being that only one person was polled in the survey (and thus one leader would get 100% of the votes, but on one occasion the person abstained).
*&quot;Chicken Cannon&quot;. Although originally a sketch in the early parts of Air Farce on TV meant to satirize the Canadian military (in it, the Canadian military consists of only two people, Colonel &quot;Teresa&quot; Stacy and his assistant, played by Ferguson and Morgan), but as the popularity of the sketch grew, it became an integral part of Air Farce, spawning its own newsroom sketch titled &quot;Chicken Cannon News&quot;. Studio audience members or viewers at home nominate or vote for their favourite target along with their choice of ammunition (not necessarily a chicken). The cast picks a winner and fires the Chicken Cannon at the fan-suggested target at the end of the sketch. The fan also wins some form of Air Farce merchandise for having their choice be a Chicken Cannon target. In the &quot;Year of the Farce&quot; episodes, a special version of the Chicken Cannon has the top five targets of the year, with the first four being fired upon by a rubber chicken while the top target being fired as before. Past targets included:
**Canadian party leaders Jean Chrétien, Stockwell Day, Alexa McDonough, Gilles Duceppe, and Joe Clark, for the 2000 election
**Olympic figure skating judges, for their part in the scandal that had surrounded Jamie Salé and David Pelletier in the 2002 Winter Olympics

*&quot;Critic At Large&quot;, where Gilbert Smythe Bite-Me (Abbott), an entertainment critic, gives negative reviews, and takes regular potshots at the Women&#x27;s Television Network, describing them as &#x27;a bunch of scrotally-deprived, estrogen-sodden non-males&#x27;, and &#x27;not just because three of (his) ex-wives work there.&#x27;
*&quot;Sister Bessie&quot;. Sister Bessie (Holmes) is a Catholic nun commenting on various political topics either in the House of Commons or relating to outside sources like George W. Bush. The issues usually make her angry, causing her network Vision Television to block out any obscenities that she may say during her broadcast.
*&quot;Craig Oliver&#x27;s 3-Way&quot; (Abbott) talks recent news and events with opinions from three other panel members.
*&quot;Dave the Cabbie&quot;, where Dave (Ferguson), a cab driver, takes on a fare and proceeds to converse with them on various current events. Dave demands that the fare pay in cash and not with the Visa credit card (often with the line &quot;You pay cash, no Visa. You pay Visa I kill you.&quot;) He also pronounces the I in Visa with a hard I (v-eye-za) and not a soft I (v-ee-za) as is usually the case. The cabbie also often takes the passenger somewhere other than requested and then demands an outrageous price. For a famous celebrity&#x27;s death, Dave says &quot;It&#x27;s very sad about Mister Rogers. He imitates Rogers saying, &quot;Not a beautiful day in the neighbourhood.&quot; Although he has a thick Ukrainian accent, he claims to be originally from Regina (The &quot;flat part&quot;). Although he usually speaks the most, when the client leaves he claims that &quot;(he) thought that (the client) would &quot;never&quot; shut up.&quot;
*&quot;English as a Second Language News&quot;, hosted by Heikki Flergenpootz (Abbott, in a horned helmet) and Svetlana (Goy, in a fruit hat). The sketch is a typical newsroom sketch, often peppered with mistakes that typical ESL learners make. In later years, they typically said &quot;Goodbye&quot; at the beginning of the sketch and &quot;Hello&quot; at the end. Each sketch also included a third &quot;guest commentator&quot; portrayed by Ferguson, some of which would later get their own sketches.
*&quot;Get Stuffed&quot;, in which Jock McBile (Morgan), a Scottish-Canadian left-handed bagpipe repair man, put his spin on current events.
*&quot;I Love that Word Refoooorm&quot;, in which Preston Manning (Ferguson, although Manning himself has appeared in the sketch playing Ferguson&#x27;s role), promotes his party, with comical results. Manning was frequently accompanied by various guests (most often Morgan as Deborah Grey, deputy leader of the party, although Grey herself has been a guest) who criticize Manning on his speech. Manning ended the sketch with the phrase &quot;I love that word reform&quot;, with &quot;reform&quot; being drawn out for comedic effect.
*&quot;Knob of the Week&quot;, a sketch in the style of the Chicken Cannon &quot;honouring&quot; various acts of stupidity by various groups. It was introduced partially to replace the Chicken Cannon, which was specially reserved for the &quot;Year of the Farce&quot; show and possibly the season opener (both of which were one-hour shows compared to the regular 30-minute shows).
*&quot;Man&#x27;s World&quot; with Buck McSweeney (Ferguson). Typically, Ferguson is joined by a special guest star (most often an athlete) playing as themselves. Buck proceeds to do a typical sports interview while letting his obsession with synchronized swimming be known.
*&quot;Member for Kicking Horse Pass&quot;, in which the fictional Member of Parliament (Dave Broadfoot), reprising his original radio role, performs a solo comedy sketch (as a representative of the &quot;New Apathetic Party&quot;.)
*&quot;News From Away&quot; with Jimmy and Seamus O&#x27;Toole (Abbott and Ferguson). Another newsroom sketch where Abbott and Ferguson play newscasters from Newfoundland. There are a number of sketches-within-a-sketch interspersed throughout, common ones being:
**&quot;52 Weeks in 52 Seconds&quot;, in which Jimmy and Seamus rapid fire various one-liners based on events that occurred in the past year. It is typically a part of every &quot;Year of the Farce&quot; show.
**&quot;Point-Counterpoint&quot;, in which Jimmy and Seamus try to debate an issue from different points of view. However, one starts the argument and the other agrees on the spot.
**&quot;Seamus&#x27; Commentary&quot;, where Seamus makes a one-line commentary about one particular issue. In one sketch, he delivered his commentary in the style of a Rick Mercer streeter from &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, and Mercer himself showed up mid-sketch to correct Seamus&#x27; delivery style.
**During the show&#x27;s live 300th episode, Alan Park played the role of Seamus, because the last sketch had Don Ferguson doing his Rex Murphy impersonation, accompanied by Mary Walsh who did her famous character, &quot;Marg: Princess Warrior&quot;.
*&quot;Not the Official Story&quot;, where a newspaper editor (Alan Park) comments on current events.
*&quot;Off the Record&quot;, a sketch that itself parodies TSN&#x27;s &quot;Off The Record&quot; sports talk show, with Ferguson playing the role of host Michael Landsberg.
*&quot;Sermon from the Mount&quot;, where a prophet (Morgan) proceeds to recall current events in the style of a sermon or lines from the Bible.
*&quot;Speedvision News&quot;, a newsroom sketch (purportedly on the Speedvision television channel) where two anchors (Abbott and Ferguson) speak quickly while recalling current events. Similar sketches also lampoon Rogers Sportsnet&#x27;s and The Score&#x27;s news programmes (&quot;Sportsnetnews&quot; and &quot;Score Tonight&quot;), where Holmes and Ferguson play the roles of the anchors (Holmes plays either Jody Vance or Martine Gaillard, while it is unclear which sportscaster Ferguson is playing).
*&quot;Liberal and PC&quot; a spoof of the &quot;Get a Mac&quot; ad, Park plays a Liberal (parody of the Mac) and Lauzon plays a &quot;PC&quot; (Progressive Conservative) and follows the outline of the Mac ad.
*&quot;Billy Two Willies&quot;, played by Abbott, a representative of First Nations, asserting their right to sell tax-free cigarettes and run casinos.

===Individual sketches===
Some of Air Farce&#x27;s famous individual sketches include:

====Politically correct version of &quot;O Canada&quot;====

In response to criticisms from different groups about O Canada&#x27;s lyrics, Air Farce had guest star Seán Cullen sing an edited, politically correct version of the anthem. The skit was performed on October 5, 2001.

The following is the lyrics of the edited &quot;O Canada&quot;.

: &quot;O Canada, our living quarters and aboriginals persons, including Inuit, Métis, and First Nations land&quot;
: &quot;True patriot love, implying affection, but not in a sexual way, in all thy gender non-specific spouse offspring&#x27;s suggestion&quot;
: &quot;With glowing hearts, we get horny, the true North strong and free&quot;
: &quot;From far and weight-challenged, O Canada, we stand or sit on guard for thee&quot;
: &quot;Non-denominational, gender-unspecified supreme being keep our land, glorious and free&quot;
: &quot;O Canada, we stand ready to sit down and discuss our differences in a civilized manner for thee&quot;
: &quot;O Canada, we stand ready to sit down and discuss our differences in a civilized manner for thee&quot;

==Guests==
Air Farce has its share of guests, including those who portray themselves. The show generally features Canadian guest stars, or people whose careers are primarily Canadian, such as athletes Doug Flutie and Carlos Delgado.
* Jann Arden – Arden was a guest who largely disliked her appearance on Air Farce. She was repeatedly interrupted when she was about to sing by Colonel Stacy, in the midst of preparing to fire the &quot;Chicken Cannon&quot;. Although she got to fire the cannon, her experience on Air Farce, as she described it, was not a pleasant one.
* Margaret Atwood – Atwood appeared at the final episode (New Year&#x27;s Eve 2008) at the beginning of the show.
* Mike Bullard – appeared on an episode of Gilbert Smythe Bite-Me.
* Brent Butt
* Jeffrey Buttle – Figure skater, after he won the world championship in March 2008.
* Jean Charest appeared during the 1998 Year of the Farce in the sketch, &#x27;Ottawa Confidencial.&#x27; According to the PI character played by Morgan, Charest had all the characteristics to become Prime Minister of Canada except that he was not born by a virgin.
* Don Cherry – Appeared for a video message to the show&#x27;s live 300th episode.
* Jean Chrétien – Chrétien had one appearance on Air Farce, in which he claimed that Abbot&#x27;s impersonation sounded more like Preston Manning.
* Joe Clark – Pays a visit to Jean Chrétien (Abbott) to offer some advice, former Prime Minister to current Prime Minister; the gag is that everything Joe says has a word that rhymes with &quot;right&quot;, since he is a Conservative while Chrétien is a Liberal.
* Sheila Copps – During a New Year&#x27;s Eve Special, the at-the-time Deputy Prime Minister interrupted the parody sketch &quot;RoboCopps.&quot;
* David Cronenberg – Appeared during an episode of Gilbert Smythe-Bite Me.
* John Crosbie
* Seán Cullen – Cullen has appeared several times on the show, initially as the leader of Corky and the Juice Pigs for a musical number comparing the 1993 Federal election to Gilligan&#x27;s Island; he also appeared as &quot;Quint&quot; in a spoof of the movie &quot;Jaws&quot;.
* Stockwell Day
* Gill Deacon – Both she and George Stroumboulopoulos beat up Craig Lauzon.
* Fred Ewanuick – In character as Hank Yarbo From &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, appeared on the live 300th episode.
* Joe Flaherty – From SCTV, made an appearance in 2002.
* Megan Follows – Best known for her role as &quot;Anne Shirley&quot; in &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;; introduced Air Farce Live on December 7, 2007, and played the role of &quot;Sue Johanson&quot; in &quot;The Canadian View&quot; skit.
* Red Green – Steve Smith appeared as Red Green doing a Handyman&#x27;s Corner segment where he showed how to make an angel to top off a Christmas tree.
* Deborah Grey – Grey appeared in one sketch on Air Farce, in which she was a guest on Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;I Love That Word Refooooorm&quot; sketch. In the final moments of the sketch, she, along with Ferguson (as Preston Manning), sang &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;, forgetting most of the lyrics partway through.
* Paul Gross – the star of &quot;Due South&quot; reprises his role in a &quot;lost episode&quot; in which he falls for Rita MacNeil (Goy).
* Sitara Hewitt – From &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot; and &quot;You Bet Your Ass&quot;, appeared on the live 300th episode.
* Mel Hurtig – First political guest on the TV show; as leader of the newly formed and almost unheard of &quot;National Party of Canada&quot;, he appeared in a game show where the contestants couldn&#x27;t identify the man, even after he tells them who he is.
* Sue Johanson – The host of &quot;Sunday Night Sex Show&quot; appeared during a New Year&#x27;s Eve special. Luba Goy, who was parodying Johanson, got up to retrieve a book. Johanson herself returned, book in hand, exclaiming &quot;Found it.&quot;
* Flora MacDonald
* Ron MacLean – the host of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; has appeared on Air Farce in several sketches, most notably one in which he portrays himself alongside Goy (as the Queen who is impersonating Don Cherry). He was also involved in a sketch where an airline passenger Onex CEO Gerry Schwartz is mistaken for him. Later in the sketch, Schwartz and MacLean (both guest stars portraying themselves), switch seats, and the passenger mistakes MacLean for Schwartz. Another memorable sketch had MacLean impersonate Cherry while Ferguson played the role of MacLean. MacLean also appeared for a video message to the show&#x27;s live 300th episode. He also appeared in the final program of the series to fire the Chicken Cannon.
* Shaun Majumder – Made an appearance in 2002, before his newscasting role on &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;.
* John Manley – Manley appeared in a &quot;Man&#x27;s World&quot; sketch (a rarity since he is a politician and not an athlete) shortly after his remarks on how Canada should abandon the monarchy. Most memorable in this sketch was Buck McSweeney&#x27;s reaction to Manley&#x27;s indifference towards synchronized swimming: &quot;... and you call yourself Manley!&quot;
* Preston Manning – largely considered to be the first guest star on Air Farce, Manning has appeared in many sketches, including a &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; parody. In some appearances, he also pronounced &quot;Reform&quot; in the same manner as Ferguson, who normally portrayed him in sketches.
* Peter Mansbridge – Mansbridge has appeared on several Air Farce sketches, most notably a &quot;Man to Mansbridge&quot; sketch in which he is interviewed by Abbot (also as Mansbridge). In another memorable show, there was a running gag was where Mansbridge, in his role as anchor for &quot;The National&quot;, finds himself appointed as the head of CBC while announcing a new series of appointments by the prime minister. Mansbridge also appeared for a video message to the show&#x27;s live 300th episode.
* Paul Martin – Appeared on a spoof of &quot;Venture&quot; when he was Minister of Finance, and threatened to audit the host, Robert Scully (Ferguson) when he tries to hand deliver his tax return to save on postage.
* Sheila McCarthy – From &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot;, appeared on the live 300th episode.
* Patrick McKenna – McKenna has appeared in various Air Farce sketches, most notably one in which he appears as &quot;Marty Stephens&quot;, his character from &quot;Traders&quot;, but with the voice and mannerisms of his &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; character, &quot;Harold Green&quot;.
* Rick Mercer – Mercer appeared on &quot;Air Farce&quot; in a sketch where Ferguson, as Seamus O&#x27;Toole, parodied his trademark &quot;Screener&quot; sketch from &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. Mercer would first confront O&#x27;Toole, then later show him how it&#x27;s done.
* Colin Mochrie – Mochrie has appeared in various Air Farce sketches, most notably as an associate to Colonel Stacy on the &quot;Chicken Cannon&quot;.
* Ben Mulroney
* Rex Murphy – Rex Murphy guest starred as himself, interviewing Samuel De Champlain.
* Anne Murray – Murray appeared in one sketch titled &quot;Murray and the Queen&quot;, where the two shared their surprisingly similar New Year&#x27;s resolutions.
* Russell Peters – Appeared in an episode in 2005 and the 2015 New Year&#x27;s Eve special as Dr. Malcolm Sidwell.
* Bob Rae
* Lloyd Robertson – Robertson, who had once stated that it was an honor to appear on Air Farce to parody himself, appeared in several Air Farce sketches, most notably in one where he, as the CTV news anchor, asks a correspondent, &quot;Do you think I&#x27;m as handsome as Peter Mansbridge? What about Peter Kent? He&#x27;s very good looking.&quot;
* Carlo Rota – From &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot;, appeared on the live 300th episode.
* Sonja Smits – From the TV series &quot;Traders&quot;, made two appearances in 2001.
* Evan Solomon – Beat up Craig Lauzon.
* Elvis Stojko
* Trish Stratus – Stratus appeared in one Air Farce show, although she was a part of several sketches, most notably one where she portrayed a stripper in a sketch lampooning the Judy Sgro &quot;strippergate&quot; scandal. (This can also be a spoof of Trish herself, since she has refused several offers to appear in Playboy)
* George Stroumboulopoulos – He and fellow CBC personality Gill Deacon beat up Craig Lauzon over Lauzon&#x27;s impersonations of Stroumboulopoulos.
* The Canadian Tire Couple (Ted Simonett and Gloria Slade) – They appeared in a sketch made to look like one of their regular ads, where they promoted the &quot;Baby Power Washer&quot;.
* Pamela Wallin – Wallin has made several appearances on Air Farce, including one in which Goy portrays herself as the Canadian host of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; while Wallin, as Catherine Zeta-Jones, appears as a celebrity contestant.
* Mary Walsh – Creator of &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, appeared on the live 300th episode.
* Brian Williams – then-&quot;CBC Sports&quot; anchor who has made several appearances on Air Farce, most memorably in which he portrays himself locked in his studio at the conclusion of the 2000 Olympic Games.
* David Suzuki – Suzuki&#x27;s appearance on Air Farce is memorable, as he appeared nude in the sketch (although the nudity was covered by a briefcase and later a desk), a parody of an ad campaign Suzuki participated in for his show The Nature of Things. In his sketch, he is interviewed, where the interviewer (Goy), aware of his nudity, is taken aback by Suzuki&#x27;s apparent use of double entendres, and later faints when Suzuki asks her if she wanted to see his &quot;genetically altered banana&quot;. Suzuki, clueless to the ordeal, then produces a slightly larger-than-normal banana.
* Former premier of New Brunswick, Bernard Lord once appeared in an episode taped in Saint John.

<text>Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) is an American multinational pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical technologies corporation headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Its common stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the company is ranked No. 40 on the 2023 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations. In 2023, the company was ranked 40th in the Forbes Global 2000. Johnson &amp; Johnson has a global workforce of approximately 130,000 employees who are led by the company&#x27;s current chairman and chief executive officer, Joaquin Duato.

Johnson &amp; Johnson was founded in 1886 by three brothers, Robert Wood Johnson, James Wood Johnson, and Edward Mead Johnson, selling ready-to-use sterile surgical dressings. In 2023, the company split-off its consumer healthcare business sector into a new publicly traded company, Kenvue. The company is exclusively focused on developing and producing pharmaceutical prescription drugs and medical device technologies.

Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the world&#x27;s most valuable companies and is one of only two U.S.-based companies that has a prime credit rating of AAA.

== History ==
=== 1873–1885: Before Johnson &amp; Johnson ===
Robert Wood Johnson began his professional training at age 16 as a pharmaceutical apprentice at an apothecary run by his mother&#x27;s cousin, James G. Wood, in Poughkeepsie, New York. Johnson co-founded his own company with George Seabury in 1873. The New York-based Seabury &amp; Johnson became known for its medicated plasters. Robert Wood Johnson represented the company at the 1876 World&#x27;s Fair. There he heard Joseph Lister&#x27;s explanation of a new procedure: antiseptic surgery. Johnson parted ways with his business partner Seabury in 1885.

=== 1886: Founding of Johnson &amp; Johnson ===

Robert Wood Johnson joined his brothers, James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson, and created a line of ready-to-use sterile surgical dressings in 1886. They founded Johnson &amp; Johnson in 1886 with 14 employees, eight women and six men. Johnson &amp; Johnson opened its first factory building in the old Janeway and Carpenter factory on Neilson Street in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
They manufactured sterile surgical supplies, household products, and medical guides. Those products initially featured a logo that resembled the signature of James Wood Johnson. Robert Wood Johnson served as the first president of the company.

=== 1887–1942: Early history ===
The company sold medicated plasters such as Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Black Perfect Taffeta Court Plaster and also manufactured the world&#x27;s first sterile surgical products, including sutures, absorbent cotton, and gauze. The company published &quot;Modern Methods of Antiseptic Wound Treatment&quot;, a guide on how to do sterile surgery using its products, and in 1888, distributed 85,000 copies to doctors and pharmacists across the United States. The manual was translated into three languages and distributed worldwide. The first commercial first aid kit was designed in 1888 to support railroad construction workers, who were often hundreds of miles from medical care. The kits included antiseptic emergency supplies and directions for field use. In 1901, the company published the &quot;Handbook of First Aid&quot;, a guide on applying first aid.

In 1889, the company hired pharmacist Fred Kilmer as its first scientific director, who led its scientific research and wrote educational manuals. Kilmer&#x27;s first achievement as scientific director was developing the industrial sterilization process. He was employed at the company until 1934.

Johnson &amp; Johnson had more than 400 employees and 14 buildings by 1894. In 1894, the company began producing Johnson&#x27;s Baby Powder, the company&#x27;s first baby product.

The company introduced the world&#x27;s first maternity kit in 1894 to aid at-home births, called Dr. Simpson&#x27;s Maternity Packet, presumably after Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson. The kit included a washcloth; safety pins; sterile sutures, sponges, and gauze; antiseptic soap; an obstetric sheet and ligatures; flannel to wrap the baby in; and a chart for keeping birth records. The products were later marketed separately, including &quot;Lister&#x27;s Towels&quot;, the world&#x27;s first mass-produced sanitary napkins. Kilmer wrote &quot;Hygiene in Maternity&quot;, an instructional guide for mothers before and after delivery. In 1904, the company expanded its baby care products with &quot;Lister&#x27;s Sanitary Diapers&quot;, a diaper product for infants.

During the Spanish–American War, Johnson &amp; Johnson developed and donated 300,000 packaged compressed surgical dressings for soldiers in the field and created a trauma stretcher for field medics. The company donated its products in disaster relief efforts of the 1900 Galveston hurricane and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccinated all of its employees against smallpox during the 1901 smallpox epidemic. The firm employed more than 1,200 people by 1910. Women accounted for half of the company&#x27;s workforce and led a quarter of its departments.

Robert Wood Johnson died in 1910, and he was succeeded as president of the company by his brother James Wood Johnson.

During World War I, Johnson &amp; Johnson factories increased production to meet wartime demands for sterile surgical products. In 1916, the company acquired Chicopee Manufacturing Company in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts, to meet demand. Near the end of World War I, the 1918 flu pandemic broke out. The company invented and distributed an epidemic mask that helped prevent the spread of the flu.

In 1919, Johnson &amp; Johnson opened the Gilmour Plant near Montreal, its first factory outside the United States, which produced surgical products for international customers. In 1924 the company&#x27;s first overseas manufacturing facility was opened in Slough, England.

In 1920, Earle Dickson combined two Johnson &amp; Johnson products, adhesive tape and gauze, to create the first commercial adhesive bandage. Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages began sales the following year. In 1921, the company released Johnson&#x27;s Baby Soap. Named after its Massachusetts facility, Johnson &amp; Johnson built a textile mill and company town, Chicopee, outside Gainesville, Georgia. In the 1930s, the company expanded operations to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa. In 1931, Johnson &amp; Johnson introduced the first prescription contraceptive gel marketed as Ortho-Gynol.

Robert Wood Johnson II became president of the company in 1932.

During The Great Depression Johnson &amp; Johnson kept all its workers employed and raised wages by 5%. In 1933, Robert Wood Johnson II wrote a letter to Franklin D. Roosevelt, calling for a federal law to increase wages and reduce hours for all American workers. The company also opened a new facility in Chicago during that period. Johnson wrote and distributed &quot;Try Reality: A Discussion of Hours, Wages, and The Industrial Future&quot; to persuade business leaders to follow his lead, advocating that business is more than profit and that companies have responsibilities to consumers, employees, and society. In &quot;Try Reality&quot;, the section titled &quot;An Industrial Philosophy&quot; would later become the company&#x27;s credo.

In 1935, Johnson&#x27;s Baby Oil was added to its line of baby products. Both male and female Johnson &amp; Johnson employees were drafted and enlisted during World War II. The company ensured no one would lose their job when they returned home. Robert Wood Johnson II was appointed head of the Smaller War Plants Corporation in Washington, D.C. His work ensured U.S. factories with under 500 employees were awarded government contracts.

=== 1943: Credo and going public ===
In 1943, as the company was preparing for its initial public offering (IPO), Robert Wood Johnson wrote what the company would call, &quot;Our Credo&quot;, a defining document that has been used to guide the company&#x27;s decisions over the years. The company completed its IPO and became a public company in 1944.

In 1943, Vesta Stoudt identified a need for waterproof tape for ammunition boxes in World War Two. She wrote to Franklin D. Roosevelt with the idea; the president commissioned Revolite, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson at the time, to develop and manufacture a cloth-based adhesive tape.

=== 1944–1999: Acquisitions and international expansion ===

In 1944, the company began selling Johnson&#x27;s Baby Lotion. The same year, the company established Ethicon Suture Laboratories. In 1947, G. F. Merson Ltd. was acquired to expand the company&#x27;s suture business in the United Kingdom. The company was rebranded and absorbed into Ethicon.

During Burke&#x27;s tenure, he managed the 1982 Tylenol tampering incident. It became a case study on crisis management. Under his leadership, the company recalled 31 million bottles of Tylenol, relaunched the product with a triple tamper-evident seal, and urged consumers not to use if tampered with. These practices became the pharmaceutical and packaged food industry norm.

Johnson &amp; Johnson opened operating companies in China and Egypt in 1985. In 1987, Acuvue contact lenses became the first disposable contact lenses available to consumers. The lenses lasted up to one week, reducing the cost of contact lenses. In the same year, the company launched One Touch, a blood glucose monitoring system. In 1989, Ralph S.

In 2019, Johnson &amp; Johnson announced the release of photochromic contact lenses. The lenses adjust to sunlight and help eyes recover from bright light exposure faster. The lenses contain a photochromic additive that adapts visible light amounts filtered to the eyes and are the first to use such additives.

In November 2020, Johnson &amp; Johnson acquired Momenta Pharmaceuticals for $6.5 billion.

In January 2022, Joaquin Duato became CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson.

In December 2022, Johnson &amp; Johnson acquired cardiovascular medical technology company Abiomed Inc. for $16.6 billion.

Johnson &amp; Johnson began the separation of their consumer healthcare business sector in November 2021.

==== Coronavirus (COVID-19) response ====
Johnson &amp; Johnson committed over $1 billion toward the development of a not-for-profit COVID-19 vaccine in partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Paul Stoffels of Johnson &amp; Johnson said, &quot;In order to go fast, the people of Johnson &amp; Johnson are committed to do this and all together we say we&#x27;re going to do this not for profit. That&#x27;s the fastest and the best way to find all the collaborations in the world to make this happen so we commit to bring this at a not-for-profit level.&quot;

Janssen Vaccines, in partnership with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), is responsible for developing the vaccine candidate, based on the same technology used to make its Ebola vaccine. The vaccine candidate is expected to enter phase 1 human clinical study in September 2020.

Demand for the product Tylenol surged two to four times normal levels in March 2020. In response, the company increased production globally. For example, the Tylenol plant in Puerto Rico ran 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

In response to the shortage of ventilators, Ethicon, with Prisma Health, made and distributed the VESper Ventilator Expansion Splitter, which uses 3D printing technology, to allow one ventilator to support two patients.

==== Janssen COVID-19 vaccine ====

In June 2020, Johnson &amp; Johnson and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) confirmed its intention to start a clinical trials of J&amp;J&#x27;s vaccine in September 2020, with the possibility of Phase 1/2a human clinical trials starting at an accelerated pace in the second half of July.

On August 5, 2020, the US government agreed to pay more than $1 billion to Johnson &amp; Johnson (medical device company) for the production of 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. As part of the agreed-upon deal, the U.S. can order up to 200 million additional doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

In September 2020, Johnson &amp; Johnson started its 60,000-person phase 3 adenovirus-based vaccine trial. The trial was paused on October 12, 2020, because a volunteer became ill, but the company said it found no evidence that the vaccine had caused the illness and announced on October 23, 2020, that it would resume the trial.

In April 2021, the company reported that its COVID-19 vaccine achieved $100 million sales in the first quarter, accounting for less than 1% of its total revenue.

As a member of the national Green Power Partnership, Johnson &amp; Johnson operates the largest solar power generator in Pennsylvania at its site in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.

== Recalls and litigation ==
=== 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders ===

On September 29, 1982, a &quot;Tylenol scare&quot; began when the first of seven individuals died in Chicago metropolitan area, after ingesting Extra Strength Tylenol that had been deliberately laced with cyanide. Within a week, the company pulled 31 million bottles of capsules back from retailers, making it one of the first major recalls in American history. The incident led to reforms in the packaging of over-the-counter substances and to federal anti-tampering laws. The case remains unsolved and no suspects have been charged. Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s quick response, including a nationwide recall, was widely praised by public relations experts and the media and was the gold standard for corporate crisis management.

=== 2010 children&#x27;s product recall ===

On April 30, 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, voluntarily recalled 43 over-the-counter children&#x27;s medicines, including Tylenol, Tylenol Plus, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl. The recall was conducted after a routine inspection at a manufacturing facility in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, United States, revealed that some &quot;products may not fully meet the required manufacturing specifications&quot;. Affected products may contain a &quot;higher concentration of active ingredients&quot; or exhibit other manufacturing defects. Products shipped to Canada, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Fiji were included in the recall. In a statement, Johnson &amp; Johnson said &quot;a comprehensive quality assessment across its manufacturing operations&quot; was underway. A dedicated website was established by the company listing affected products and other consumer information.

=== 2010 hip-replacement recall ===

On August 24, 2010, DePuy, a subsidiary of American giant Johnson &amp; Johnson, recalled its ASR (articular surface replacement) hip prostheses from the market. DePuy said the recall was due to unpublished National Joint Registry data showing a 12% revision rate for resurfacing at five years and an ASR XL revision rate of 13%. All hip prostheses fail in some patients, but it is expected that the rate will be about 1% a year.
Pathologically, the failing prosthesis had several effects. Metal debris from wear of the implant led to a reaction that destroyed the soft tissues surrounding the joint, leaving some patients with long term disability. Ions of cobalt and chromiumthe metals from which the implant was madewere also released into the blood and cerebral spinal fluid in some patients.

In March 2013, a jury in Los Angeles ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay more than $8.3million in damages to a Montana man in the first of more than 10,000 lawsuits pending against the company in connection with the now-recalled DePuy hip.

Some lawyers and industry analysts have estimated that the suits ultimately will cost Johnson &amp; Johnson billions of dollars to resolve.

=== 2010 Tylenol recall ===
In 2010 and 2011, Johnson &amp; Johnson voluntarily recalled some over-the-counter products, including Tylenol, due to an odor caused by tribromoanisole. In this case, 2,4,6-tribromophenol was used to treat wooden pallets on which product packaging materials were transported and stored.

=== Shareholders lawsuit ===
In 2010 a group of shareholders sued the board for allegedly failing to take action to prevent serious failings and illegalities since the 1990s, including manufacturing problems, bribing officials, covering up adverse effects and misleading marketing for unapproved uses. The judge initially dismissed the case in September 2011, but allowed the plaintiffs opportunity to refile at a later time. In 2012 Johnson and Johnson proposed a settlement with the shareholders, whereby the company would institute new oversight, quality and compliance procedures binding for five years.

=== Illegal marketing of Risperdal ===
Juries in several US states have found J&amp;J guilty of concealing the adverse effects of Janssen Pharmaceuticals&#x27; antipsychotic medication Risperdal, produced by its unit, to promote it to doctors and patients as better than cheaper generics, and of falsely marketing it for treating patients with dementia. States that have awarded damages include Texas ($158million), South Carolina ($327million), Louisiana ($258million), and most notably Arkansas ($1.2billion).

In 2010, the United States Department of Justice joined a whistleblowers suit accusing the company of illegally marketing Risperdal through Omnicare, the largest company supplying pharmaceuticals to nursing homes. The allegations include that J&amp;J were warned by the FDA to not promote Risperdal as effective and safe for elderly patients, but they did so, and that they paid Omnicare to promote the drug to care home physicians. The settlement was finalized on November 4, 2013, with J&amp;J agreeing to pay a penalty of around $2.2billion, &quot;including criminal fines and forfeiture totaling $485million and civil settlements with the federal government and states totaling $1.72billion&quot;.

Johnson &amp; Johnson has also been subject to congressional investigations related to payments given to psychiatrists to promote its products and ghost write articles, notably Joseph Biederman and his pediatric bipolar disorder research unit.

=== Foreign bribery ===
In 2011, J&amp;J settled litigation brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and paid around $70M in disgorgement and fines. J&amp;J&#x27;s employees had given kickbacks and bribes to doctors in Greece, Poland, and Romania to obtain business selling drugs and medical devices and had bribed officials in Iraq to win contracts under the Oil for Food program. J&amp;J fully cooperated with the investigation once the problems came to light.

=== Consumer fraud settlements ===
In May 2017, J&amp;J reached an agreement to pay $33million to several states to settle consumer fraud allegations in some of the company&#x27;s over-the-counter drugs.

=== Use of the Red Cross symbol ===

Johnson &amp; Johnson registered the Red Cross as a U.S. trademark for &quot;medicinal and surgical plasters&quot; in 1905 and has used the design since 1887. The Geneva Conventions, which reserved the Red Cross emblem for specific uses, were first approved in 1864 and ratified by the United States in 1882. However, the emblem was not protected by U.S. law for the use of the American Red Cross (ARC) and the U.S. military until after Johnson &amp; Johnson had obtained its trademark. A clause in this law (now 18 U.S.C. 706) permits this pre-existing use of the Red Cross to continue.
A declaration made by the U.S. upon its ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions includes a reservation that pre-1905 U.S. domestic uses of the Red Cross, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s, would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on &quot;aircraft, vessels, vehicles, buildings or other structures, or upon the ground&quot;, i.e., uses which could be confused with its military uses. This means that the U.S. did not agree to any interpretation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that would overrule Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s trademark. The American Red Cross continues to recognize the validity of Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s trademark.

In August 2007, Johnson &amp; Johnson filed a lawsuit against the ARC, demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public, though the company takes no issue with the charity&#x27;s use of the mark for nonprofit purposes. In May 2008, the judge in the case dismissed most of Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s claims, and a month later the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached in which both parties would continue to use the symbol.

=== Boston Scientific lawsuits ===
Since 2003, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Boston Scientific have both claimed that the other had infringed on their patents covering heart stent medical devices. The litigation was settled when Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716million to Johnson &amp; Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73billion in February 2010. Their dispute was renewed in 2014, now on the grounds of a contract dispute.

=== Patent-infringement case against Abbott ===
In 2007, Johnson &amp; Johnson sued Abbott Laboratories over the development and sale of the arthritis drug Humira, claiming Abbott used technology licensed exclusively to Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Centocor division. Johnson &amp; Johnson won the court case, and in 2009 Abbott was ordered to pay Johnson &amp; Johnson $1.17billion in lost revenues and $504million in royalties. The judge also added $175.6million in interest to bring the total to $1.84billion. This was the largest patent-infringement award in U.S. history until the 2013 decision against Teva in favor of Takeda and Pfizer for over $2.1billion. In 2010 Abbott appealed the verdict and in 2011 won the appeal.

=== Vaginal mesh implants ===
Tens of thousands of women worldwide have taken legal action against Johnson &amp; Johnson after suffering serious complications following a vaginal mesh implant procedure. In Australia, more than 700 women began a class action against the company in the Federal Court of Australia in 2017, telling the court they &quot;suffered irreparable, debilitating pain after the devices began to erode into surrounding tissue and organs, causing infections and complications&quot;. The class action alleged that Johnson &amp; Johnson, which &quot;aggressively marketed&quot; the implants &quot;failed to properly warn patients and surgeons of the risk, or test the devices adequately&quot;. Emails between executives show the company was aware of the risks in 2005 but still went ahead and made the product available. In November 2019 the Federal Court of Australia found Johnson &amp; Johnson negligent. The judgment was appealed, with the appeals court upholding all findings of Justice Anna Katzman. Ethicon then sought a High Court decision but this was not permitted by the High Court of Australia. Subsequently (September 2022) a A$300,000,000 compensation agreement was reached between Shine Lawyers and J&amp;J but this agreement remains subject to approval by the Federal Court of Australia.

In the US in 2016 the U.S. states of California and Washington filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of deception. In October 2019, the company and its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. reached a settlement with 41 states and the District of Columbia, with no admission of liability, in a suit alleging deceptive marketing of transvaginal surgical-mesh devices. The suit also alleges that the company failed to disclose risks associated with the product, which J&amp;J pulled from the US market in 2012. The amount settled in the suit was about $117million.

=== Baby powder ===
J&amp;J has been the subject of over 60,000 lawsuits claiming that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer. The lawsuits focus on claims that the talc-based powder is contaminated with asbestos, a known carcinogen commonly found in places where talc is mined.

In 2016, J&amp;J was ordered to pay $72million in damages to the family of Jacqueline Fox, a 62-year-old woman who died of ovarian cancer in 2015. The company said it would appeal. A year later, over 1,000 U.S. women had sued J&amp;J for covering up the possible cancer risk from its Baby Powder product. The company says that 70% of its Baby Powder is used by adults. Later that year, a California jury ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay $417million to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using the company&#x27;s talc-based products like Johnson&#x27;s Baby Powder for feminine hygiene. The verdict included $70million in compensatory damages and $347million in punitive damages. J&amp;J said they would appeal the verdict. The Missouri Eastern District appeals court later negated a $72million jury verdict in the Jacqueline Fox lawsuit, ruling it lacked jurisdiction in Missouri because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that imposed limits on where injury lawsuit can be filed. Subsequently, this ruling killed three other recent St. Louis jury verdicts of more than $200million combined. Fox, 62, of Birmingham, Alabama, died in 2015, about four months before her trial was held in St. Louis Circuit Court. She was among 65 plaintiffs, of whom only two were from Missouri.

A St. Louis jury awarded nearly $4.7billion in damages to 22 women and their families in 2018 after they claimed that asbestos in Johnson &amp; Johnson talcum powder caused their ovarian cancer. In August, J&amp;J said that it removed several chemicals from baby powder products and re-engineered them to make consumers more confident that products were safer for children. The company was forced to release internal documents with 11,700 people suing J&amp;J over cancers allegedly caused by baby powder. The documents showed that the company had known about asbestos contamination since at least as early as 1971 and had spent decades finding ways to conceal the evidence from the public.

The company lost its request to reverse a jury verdict that ruled in favor of the accusers, which required the company to pay $4.14billion in punitive damages and $550million in compensatory damages. A large study performed in 2003 found that ovarian cancer risk increased from a baseline of 0.0121% to 0.0161% in people who reported regularly using talc in the genital area. Two more studies over the next twelve years, which also relied on self-reporting, had similar results; however, none of the three studies showed a relationship between how long someone used talc and how much their cancer risk increased, which is expected in experiments with carcinogens and other toxic substances (see dose–response relationship).

Conversely, a St. Louis jury ruled in favor of Johnson &amp; Johnson in the case of a single plaintiff who had used the company&#x27;s talc-containing baby powder for thirty years with a similar claim. The company&#x27;s CEO, Alex Gorsky, declined to appear at a United States congressional hearing on the safety of J&amp;J&#x27;s Baby Powder and other talc-based cosmetics. J&amp;J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said that the subcommittee had rejected the company&#x27;s offers to send a talc testing expert or a J&amp;J executive in charge of consumer products. In response to declining demand, J&amp;J announced it would discontinue the sale of talc-based baby powder in the United States and Canada in 2020, but would continue to sell it in other markets. In a statement, the company said that the existing retail inventory of the talc-based powder will sell until it runs out, while the company&#x27;s cornstarch-based baby powder will continue to sell in the United States and Canada.

The Supreme Court of Missouri refused to consider J&amp;J&#x27;s appeal of a $2.12 billion damages award to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on its talc-based products.

The Supreme Court of the United States also refused to consider an appeal from J&amp;J, leaving in place a judgment from a state appeal court that had cut the original award to $2.1 billion. Two of the justices had to recuse: Samuel Alito because either he and/or his wife owning or recently owning stock in J&amp;J, and Brett Kavanaugh, whose father led an industry group lobbying against safety warnings on talc products. Representing the affected women during the trial, Mark Lanier remarked that the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision sent &quot;a clear message to the rich and powerful: You will be held to account when you cause grievous harm under our system of equal justice under law.&quot; J&amp;J had argued that the combined claims in the St. Louis trial were too different, yet the short jury deliberation and identical payouts were, therefore, a violation of the company&#x27;s due process and also that the high punitive award was unconstitutional.

In 2021, Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary LTL Management LLC, using a process called a Texas divisional merger, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in North Carolina. The process allowed by Texas law lets a company create a separate subsidiary to take over liabilities, with the existing company operating normally. The new company, with a different name, can locate in a state such as North Carolina where bankruptcy laws are different, and then declare bankruptcy, paying less than the original company would have. In the case of LTL, a $2 billion trust will be created, compared to $25 billion if Johnson &amp; Johnson had declared bankruptcy. According to the filing, a company known as Old JJCI took on the baby powder related liabilities in 1979, while Johnson &amp; Johnson remained a defendant. LTL and New JJCI were created with LTL taking the baby powder related liabilities and some assets, and New JJCI taking the remaining assets. Johnson &amp; Johnson says LTL is now based in New Jersey.

The company announced that it would stop making talc-based powder by 2023 and replace it with cornstarch-based powders. The company says the talc-based powder is safe to use and does not contain asbestos.

In 2023, the number of lawsuits regarding talc-based baby powder exceeded 40,000 as more claimants came forward to say that the company&#x27;s product caused them to have cancer. Johnson &amp; Johnson offered $9 billion to settle all the lawsuits against the company, up from the previous figure of $2 billion.

In February 2025, as the number of talc-based powder related lawsuits sits at over 62,000, Johnson &amp; Johnson offered a settlement of $10 billion to end litigation, funded by a subsidiary&#x27;s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, reliant on the approval from Houston bankruptcy judge, Judge Christopher Lopez. While the proposal showed significantly more support compared to their last bankruptcy attempts, there are accusations of the company pushing against negative votes, and widely accepting positive ones. Adam Silverstein, an attorney representing plaintiffs rejecting the proposal, branded the move as a &quot;blatant double standard&quot; in a statement to Lopez.

=== Opioid epidemic ===

By 2018, the company had become embroiled in the opioid epidemic in the United States and had become a target of lawsuits. Over 500 opioid-related cases have been filed as of May 2018 against J&amp;J and its competitors. In Idaho, J&amp;J is part of a lawsuit accusing the company for being partially to blame for opioid-related overdose deaths. The first major trial began in Oklahoma in May 2019. On August 26, 2019, the Oklahoma judge ordered J&amp;J to pay $572million for their part in the opioid crisis, and in October J&amp;J paid $20.4million to two Ohio counties fighting the opioid epidemic. In January 2022, Johnson &amp; Johnson agreed to pay up to $5 billion as part of a $26 billion settlement which included McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, and Cardinal Health. Had the states gone to court, the companies could have faced up to $95 billion in penalties.

==== Northeastern Ohio Settlement ====
In October 2019, the company agreed to a settlement of $20.4million with northeastern Ohio&#x27;s most populous counties of Cuyahoga (containing Cleveland) and Summit (Akron). The settlement allows the company avoidance of a trial accusing J&amp;J and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers of helping to spark the US opioid epidemic. The trial was thought to be an indicator for thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against many drug manufacturers. The arrangement, which contains no admission of liability by the company, provides the counties $10million in cash, $5million for legal expenses and $5.4million in contributions to opioid-related nonprofit organizations in the counties.

<doc id="166829" wikidata="Q19275831" url="?curid=166829" title="Choking">
<text>Choking, also known as foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO), is a phenomenon that occurs when breathing is impeded by a blockage inside of the respiratory tract. An obstruction that prevents oxygen from entering the lungs results in oxygen deprivation. Although oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops, choking often leads to death.

Around 4,500 to 5,000 choking-related deaths occur in the United States every year. Deaths from choking most often occur in the very young (children under three years old) and in the elderly (adults over 75 years). Foods that can adapt their shape to that of the pharynx (such as bananas, marshmallows, or gelatinous candies) are more dangerous. Various forms of specific first aid are used to address and resolve choking.

Choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional injury death in the United States. Many episodes go unreported because they are brief and resolve without needing medical attention. Of the reported events, 80% occur in people under 15 years of age, and 20% occur in people older than 15 years of age. Worldwide, choking on a foreign object resulted in 162,000 deaths (2.5 per 100,000) in 2013, compared with 140,000 deaths (2.9 per 100,000) in 1990.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Choking victims may present very subtly, especially in the setting of long term foreign body aspiration. Cough is seen in 80% of foreign body aspiration cases, and shortness of breath is seen in 25%. People may be unable to speak, attempt to use hand signals to indicate they are choking, attempt to force vomiting, or clutch at their throat.

=== History of episode ===
An observed or recalled episode of choking, with sudden onset of any of the below respiratory and skin signs and symptoms while eating or handling small objects, is seen in around 90% of choking episodes. Initial episodes typically last seconds to several minutes, but can be followed by symptom improvement that can be mistaken as resolution.

=== Respiratory ===
Initial respiratory symptoms can include involuntary cough, gurgling, gagging, shortness of breath, labored breathing, or wheezing. Children often present with excessive drooling and stridor (high pitched breathing sounds). Classic triad of choking symptoms in children is coughing, wheezing, and diminished breath sounds, however, a 10-year review showed that this grouping of symptoms was present together in only about 60% of patients.

Loss of consciousness may occur if breathing is not restored. In the setting of lower airway aspiration, patients may develop pneumonia like symptoms such as fever, chest pain, foul smelling sputum, or blood in sputum (hemoptysis). In the case of long term foreign body aspiration, patients may present with signs of lobar pneumonia or pleural effusion.

The time a choking victim is still alive without brain damage can vary, but typically brain damage can occur when the patient remains without air for approximately three minutes (it is variable). Death can occur if breathing is not restored in six to ten minutes (varies depending on the person). However, life can be extended by using cardiopulmonary resuscitation for unconscious victims of choking (see more details further below).

=== Skin ===
The face could turn blue (cyanosis) from lack of oxygen if breathing is not restored. Cyanosis may also be seen on the fingertips. In a healthy child or adult, this sign is highly sensitive, but is only observed in 15-20% of choking episodes.

==Causes==

Choking occurs when a foreign body blocks the airway. This obstruction can be located in the pharynx, the larynx, trachea, or lower respiratory tract. The blockage can be either partial (insufficient air passes through to the lungs) or complete (complete blockage of airflow).

Foods that are small, round, or hard pose a high risk of choking. Examples include hard candy, chunks of cheese or hot dogs, nuts, grapes, marshmallows, and popcorn.

Among children, the most common causes of choking are food, coins, toys, and balloons. In one study, peanuts were the most common object found in the airway of children evaluated for suspected foreign body aspiration. Small, round non-food objects such as balls, marbles, toys, and toy parts are also associated with a high risk of choking death because of the potential to completely block a child&#x27;s airway. Children younger than age three are especially at risk of choking due to lack of fully developed chewing habits, and the tendency to insert object in their mouth as they explore the environment. Because a child&#x27;s airway is smaller in diameter than that of an adult&#x27;s, smaller objects can more often cause airway obstruction in children. Additionally, infants and young children generate a less forceful cough than adults, so coughing may not be as effective in relieving airway obstruction.

Risk factors of foreign body airway obstruction for people of any age include the use of alcohol or sedatives, procedures involving the oral cavity or pharynx, oral appliances, or medical conditions that cause difficulty swallowing or impair the cough reflex. Conditions that can cause difficulty swallowing and/or impaired coughing include neurological conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, or Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In older adults, risk factors also include living alone, wearing dentures, and having difficulty swallowing. Children and adults with neurological, cognitive, or psychiatric disorders are at an increased risk of choking and may experience a delay in diagnosis because there may not be a known history of a foreign body entering the airway.

Choking on food is only one type of airway obstruction; others include blockage due to tumors, swelling and inflammation of the airway tissues (from organic foreign bodies or another reason), and compression of the laryngopharynx, larynx, or vertebrate trachea in strangulation. Foreign bodies can also enter the reparatory tract through the chest wall, such as in the setting of a gunshot injury.

== Diagnosis ==
Recognition and diagnosis of choking primarily involves identification of the signs and symptoms like coughing and wheezing (see Signs and Symptoms). Immediate recognition of the symptoms is important, but based on the short length of some episodes, diagnosis during the first 24 hours only occurs in 50–60% of cases.

After the initial episode, choking can lead to an obstruction of the airway that prompts further diagnostic steps. For choking episodes that require emergent evaluation by a doctor, several tools can be used for diagnosis, each with their advantages and drawbacks.

=== Imaging and visualization methods ===
; Bronchoscopy
: According to the American Heart Association, bronchoscopy is a reliable method used to visualize the cause of choking when not resolved via oxygen and supportive care. Bronchoscopy also is a crucial tool in foreign body removal after supportive care has been provided and the person who is choking is stable. However, bronchoscopy is an invasive form of imaging and intervention in comparison to the below diagnostic tools, and requires sedation to perform.
; X-ray
: An X-ray uses high-frequency electromagnetic radiation to visualize the human body. In the case of choking, a chest X-ray is obtained to visualize the lungs and upper airway. However, many objects do not show up on X-ray (radiolucent). About 10% objects are radio-opaque and can be visualized using X-ray. X-rays are more accessible than other imaging modalities but expose a person to radiation. In cases where X-ray is inconclusive, fluoroscopy may be able to demonstrate radiolucent or smaller foreign bodies. Chest fluoroscopy is a real-time X-ray image (sometimes referred to as an X-ray movie) to view breathing and coughing.
; Computerized tomography (CT)
: A CT scan uses a tube with multiple X-ray machines to build a 3D image from 2D X-ray images of multiple cross-sections. Radiolucent objects can be better captured on CT than X-ray. Additionally, modern imaging analysis software allows for airway reconstruction following a chest CT, creating a model of the airway network in the lungs that can better visualize the exast location of a foreign body. Since a CT is multiple X-rays, the exposure to radiation is significantly greater.
; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
: An MRI scan uses radio-frequency pulse under a magnetic field to create a high-resolution image of the body. MRIs can detect foreign bodies with higher accuracy than X-ray or CT. MRI does not expose the person to radiation. Drawbacks of MRI include claustrophobia and high cost. For children, sedation may be required to undergo MRI imaging, which is an increased risk when the airway is already potentially compromised.

==Treatment==
Airway management is used to restore a person&#x27;s ventilation which consists of severity assessment, procedural planning, and may consist of multiple treatment modalities to restore airway.

Treatments will vary based on severity and stage of airway blockage. In basic airway management, treatment generally consists of anti-choking first aid techniques, such as the Heimlich maneuver. In advanced airway management, complex clinical methods are used.

=== Basic treatment (first aid) ===
Basic treatment of choking includes several non-invasive techniques to help remove foreign bodies from the airways.

==== General strategy: &quot;five and five&quot; ====
For a conscious choking victim, most institutions such as the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross and the NHS, recommend the same general protocol of first-aid: encouraging the victim to cough, followed by hard back slaps (as described forward). If these attempts are not effective, the procedure continues with abdominal thrusts (the Heimlich maneuver) or chest thrusts if the victim cannot receive abdominal pressure (as described forward).

If none of these techniques are effective, protocol by various institutions recommend alternating the series of back slaps and series of thrusts (these on the abdomen or chest, depending on the victim), 5 times of each technique and repeat (&quot;five and five&quot;). Some anti-choking devices can also be used to solve choking.

This procedure has modifications for infants (babies under 1 year-old), for the people with problems in the belly as the pregnant or too much obese people, for the disabled victims in wheelchair, for the victims that lay on the bed but are unable to sit up, and for the victims that lay on the floor but are unable to sit up.

In scenarios when the first aid procedures are not resolving the choking, it is necessary to call to emergency medical services, but administration of first aid should be continued until they arrive.

Choking can change the colour in the victim&#x27;s faces due to lack of oxygen. If they lose consciousness and fall to the ground, it is recommended to avoid panic and begin the appropriate anti-choking resuscitation for unconscious victims or unconscious babies (under 1 year-old).

Each one of the techniques in the first aid protocol against choking are detailed below:

==== Cough ====
If the choking victim is conscious and can cough, the American Red Cross and the Mayo Clinic recommend encouraging them to stay calm and continue coughing freely.

==== Back blows (back slaps) ====
Many associations, including the American Red Cross and the Mayo Clinic, recommend the use of back blows (back slaps) to aid a choking victim. This technique is performed by bending the choking victim forward as much as possible, even trying to place their head lower than the chest, to avoid the blows driving the object deeper into the person&#x27;s throat (a rare complication, but possible). The bending is in the back, while the neck should not be excessively bent. It is convenient that one hand supports the victim&#x27;s chest. Then the back blows are performed by delivering forceful slaps with the heel of the hand on the victim&#x27;s back, between the shoulder blades.

The back slaps push behind the blockage to expel the foreign object out. In some cases, the physical vibration of the action may cause enough movement to clear the airway.

==== Abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) ====

Abdominal thrusts are performed with the rescuer embracing the belly of the choking victim from behind. Then, the rescuer closes their own dominant hand, grasps it with the other hand, and presses forcefully with them on the area located between the chest and the belly button of the victim, in a direction of in-and-up. This method tries to create enough pressure upwards to expel the object that obstructs the airway. The strength is not focused directly against the ribs, to avoid breaking them. If the first thrust does not solve the choking, it can be repeated several times.

The use of abdominal thrusts is not recommended for infants under 1 year of age due to risk of causing injury, so there are adaptations for babies (see more details further below), but a child that is too big for the babies&#x27; adaptations would require normal abdominal thrusts (according to the size of the body). Besides, abdominal thrusts should not be used when the victim&#x27;s abdomen presents problems to receive them, such as pregnancy or excessive size; in these cases, chest thrusts are advised (see more details further below).

Although it is a well known method for choking intervention, the Heimlich Maneuver is backed by limited evidence and unclear guidelines. The use of the maneuver has saved many lives but can produce deleterious consequences if not performed correctly. This includes rib fracture, perforation of the jejunum, diaphragmatic herniation, among others.

==== Chest thrusts ====
When abdominal thrusts cannot be performed on the victim (serious injuries, pregnancy, or belly size that is too large for the rescuer to effectively perform abdominal thrust technique), chest thrusts are advised instead.

Chest thrusts are performed with the rescuer embracing the chest of the choking victim from behind. Then, the rescuer closes the own dominant hand and grasps it with the other hand. This can produce several kinds of fists, but any of them can be valid if it can be placed on the victim&#x27;s chest without sinking a knuckle too painfully. Keeping the fist with both hands, the rescuer uses it to press forcefully inwards on the lower half of the chest bone (sternum). The pressure is not focused on the very endpoint (named xiphoid process) to avoid breaking it. When the victim is a woman, the zone of the pressure of the chest thrusts would normally be above the level of the breasts. If the first thrust does not solve the choking, it can be repeated several times.

==== Anti-choking devices ====
Since 2015, several anti-choking devices were developed and released to the market. They are based on a mechanical vacuum effect, without a power source. Most use an attached mask to make a vacuum from the patient&#x27;s nose and mouth. The current models of anti-choking devices are quite similar: a direct plunger tool (LifeVac and Willnice) and a vacuum syringe (backward syringe) that also keeps the tongue in place by inserting a tube in the mouth (Dechoker). All three of them have received certification, and they have been reported to be effective in real cases. Other mechanical models are in development, such as Lifewand, which creates a vacuum by direct pressure against the patient&#x27;s face. However, these products have not been well-studied in clinical trials or pre-hospital settings and literature is relatively sparse given the challenges in trial design.
A 2020 systematic review of the effectiveness of the three devices listed discovered &quot;a more detailed review of the studies demonstrated a very low certainty of evidence for its use&quot;, and concluded that &quot;there are many weaknesses in the available data and few unbiased trials that test the effectiveness of anti-choking suction devices resulting in insufficient evidence to support or discourage their use. Practitioners should continue to adhere to guidelines authored by local resuscitation authorities which align with ILCOR recommendations.&quot;

As of October 22, 2024, The American Red Cross has updated its guidelines to include antichoking devices which highlighted the LifeVac for its effectiveness in clearing the airway passages. The scientific analyses of the LifeVac revealed a dislodgement rate of 94% during the first attempt, 99.6% on the second attempt, and a 100% success rate on the third attempt. There has so far been no known side effects due to the LifeVac device according to these studies. According to the findings, the evaluation on PubMed records from September 2019 through March 2023 which identified nearly 4,000 documents relating to the study which was significantly lead by the document &quot;LifeVac: A Novel Apparatus to Resuscitate a Choking Victim&quot; which were evaluated by the Journal of the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council (American Red Cross).

Some anti-choking devices like Act Fast Anti Choking Trainer are used as training devices by healthcare providers as well as schools in CPR training courses.

==== Unconscious victims ====

A choking victim who becomes unconscious must be gently caught before falling and placed lying face-up on a surface. That surface should be firm enough (it is recommended placing a layer of something on the floor and laying the victim above).

A rescuer can then ask for any of the known anti-choking devices that is available, and use it on the unconscious victim. After that, the obstruction would be dislodged, but it could remain into the mouth, which needs a manual removal. If the unconscious victim cannot breath then, or stays in a cardiac arrest, it will require to perform a normal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), as described below, but only alternating the 30 compressions and the two rescue breaths.

Emergency medical services must be called, if this has not already been done.

It can be also convenient that any rescuer asks for a defibrillator around (an AED, as those devices are very common today), just in case it can be necessary to treat the victim&#x27;s heart.

Anyway, a choking victim that is already unconscious needs to receive (even with no more delay) an anti-choking cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for unconscious adults and children. It is not valid for infants less than one year old, who require a special adaptated CPR for unconscious babies (described further below). 

The anti-choking cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for unconscious adults and children is quite similar to any other CPR, but with some modifications:

In a first step, a series of 30 &quot;chest&quot; &quot;compressions&quot; are applied on the lower half of the sternum (the bone that is along the middle of the chest from the neck to the belly) at an approximate rhythm of nearly 2 per second.

After that series, the rescuer looks for the obstructing object and, if it is already visible, the rescuer makes a &quot;try to extract&quot; it, usually by using a finger sweeping (hopefully from the mouth). Normally, the object would be a food bolus (and not the epiglottis, a cartilaginous flap of the throat). It is also possible to try to extract it when it is deeper and not visible, always carefully: using the fingers to take it, or lifting the victim&#x27;s chin to form a straight way to the throat while the victim is face up (face down in case of the victim&#x27;s tongue obstructs too much, or on a side with a base under the head) and then grasping or sweeping the stuck object with tools: thin kitchen tweezers, scissors (these used with care), forks and spoons (in a reverse position: introducing their handle) or even a toothpick (if other instruments were too much big for the case); but, anyway, the current protocols do not recommend extracting the obstructing object if it is not visible (a blind extraction), because of the risk to sink it deeper by accident, and because the compressions could move the object outside by themselves (in some cases). Moreover, if any removal is tried and is taking too much time, it may require alternating it with the chest compressions at some moments, without hindering to the extraction. And, whether the object has been found and removed in this step or not, the CPR procedure must pass to the next step and continue until the victims can breathe by themselves or emergency medical services arrive.

In the next step of the CPR, the rescuer applies &quot;a&quot; &quot;rescue breath&quot;, pinching the victim&#x27;s nose and puffing air inside of the mouth. Rescue breaths would usually fail while the obstructing object is blocking the entrance of air. Anyway, it is recommended, additionally, &quot;tilting the victim&#x27;s head&quot; up and down, to reposition it trying to open an entrance for the air, and then giving &quot;another rescue breath&quot;. After the rescue breaths, this resuscitation returns to the 30 initial compressions, in a cycle that repeats continually, until the victim regains consciousness and breathes, or until the object is extracted but a defibrillation is needed to solve a cardiac arrest (read below).

&quot;Defibrillation&quot; can also be needed, because an unconscious victim of choking can suffer a cardiac arrest at any moment, due to several possible causes. So it is convenient to ask around for a defibrillator (AED device), for trying a defibrillation on a victim that remains in cardiac arrest after having extracted the stuck object (if it has been extracted, and only after that). Those defibrillators are easy to use, as they emit their instructions with voice messages.

===== Finger sweeping =====
It is crucial to avoid blindingly sweeping the airway unless there is direct visualization of the airway – in fact, these procedures are advised only to be performed in more controlled environments such as an operating room. In unconscious choking victims, the American Medical Association has previously advocated sweeping the fingers across the back of the throat to attempt to dislodge airway obstructions. Many modern protocols suggest other treatment modalities are superior. Red Cross procedures also advise rescuers not to perform a finger sweep unless an object can be clearly seen in the victim&#x27;s mouth to prevent driving the obstruction deeper into the victim&#x27;s airway. Other protocols suggest that if the patient is conscious they will be able to remove the foreign object themselves, or if they are unconscious, the rescuer should place them in the recovery position to allow the drainage of fluids out of the mouth instead of down the trachea due to gravity. There is also a risk of causing further damage (inducing vomiting, for instance) by using a finger sweep technique. There are no studies that have examined the usefulness of the finger sweep technique when there is no visible object in the airway. Recommendations for the use of the finger sweep have been based on anecdotal evidence.

===Particular cases===

==== Infants (babies under 1 year-old) ====
The majority of choking injuries and fatalities occurs in children aged 0–4, highlighting the importance for widespread dissemination of the appropriate anti-choking techniques for these age groups. In fact, it has been shown that increased parental education may decrease choking rates among children.

For infants under 1 year-old, the American Heart Association recommends adapted procedures. The size of the children&#x27;s body is the most important aspect in determining the correct anti-choking technique. So the normal first aid techniques against choking would be tried in children who are too large for the babies&#x27; procedures (or they would be tried as a less appropriated attempt if the rescuer is unable to perform the techniques for babies).

First aid for choking infants alternates a cycle of special back blows (five back slaps) followed by special chest thrusts (five adapted chest compressions). In the &quot;back blows maneuver&quot;, the rescuer slaps on the baby&#x27;s back. It is recommended that the baby receive them being slightly leaned upside-down on an inclination. There exist several ways to achieve this:

According to a widely propagated modality: the rescuer sits down on a seat with the baby, and supports the baby with a forearm and its respective hand. The baby&#x27;s head must be carefully held with that hand (approximately by the face), and kept in a normal position, facing forward, not inclinated. Then the baby&#x27;s body can be leaned forward upside-down along the rescuer&#x27;s thighs, and receive the slaps.

As an easier alternative: the rescuer can sit on a bed or sofa, or even the floor, carrying the baby. Next, the rescuer should support the baby&#x27;s body on the own lap, to lean the baby a bit upside-down at the right or the left of the lap. The baby&#x27;s head must be in a normal position, facing forward, frontally, and not inclinated. It is always convenient that the baby&#x27;s chest is supported against something. Then the rescuer would slap the back of the baby.

If the rescuer cannot sit down: at least it is possible to attempt the manoeuver at a low height and over a soft surface. Then the rescuer would support the baby with a forearm and the hand of that side, holding carefully the baby&#x27;s head with that hand (approximately by the face, but always trying that the baby&#x27;s head keeps in a normal position, facing forward, not inclinated). The baby&#x27;s body would be leaned upside-down in that position to receive the slaps. In situations with rescuers who cannot do all of that (as rescuers with disabilities and others), they can still try the normal back blows, supporting the baby&#x27;s chest with one hand, bending the baby&#x27;s body, and then giving firm slaps with the other hand.

In the &quot;chest thrusts manoeuver&quot;, the baby&#x27;s body is placed lying face up on a surface (it can be the rescuer&#x27;s thighs, lap or forearm). Then, the rescuer does the compressions pressing with only two fingers on the lower half of the bone that is along the middle of the chest from the neck to the belly (on the chest bone, named sternum, on its part that is the nearest to the belly). Abdominal thrusts are not recommended in children less than one year old because they can cause liver damage.

The back blows and chest thrusts are &quot;alternated in cycles&quot; of five back blows and five chest compressions until the object comes out of the infant&#x27;s airway or until the infant becomes unconscious.

If choking is unresolved despite these rescue attempts, it is vital that somebody calls to the emergency medical services and continue first aid until they arrive. An infant can fall unconscious soon, then an anti-choking resuscitation for infants is required (read next).

===== Unconscious infants =====
An &quot;unconscious&quot; infant has to be placed face-up on a firm and horizontal surface (as the floor). The baby&#x27;s head must be in a straight position, facing frontally, because tilting it too much backwards can close the access to the trachea in infants.

A rescuer can then ask for any of the known anti-choking devices, and try it on the unconscious baby. There can be difficulties because of the little size of the infant. The obstruction can be dislodged, but remaining into the mouth, which would need a manual removal. If the baby cannot breath then, or stays in a cardiac arrest, the rescuer must perform a normal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), as it is described below, but only alternating the 30 compressions and the 2 rescue breaths.

Emergency medical services must be called, if this has not been done yet.

It can be also convenient that any rescuer asks for a defibrillator near (an AED, as those devices are very common today), just in case it is necessary to treat the baby&#x27;s heart.

Until emergency services arrive, the American Heart Association recommends starting (even with no more delay) an anti-choking cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) adaptive to infants less than one year old (described below). It is a cycle of resuscitation that alternates compressions and rescue breaths, like in a normal CPR, but with some differences: 
The rescuer begins by making 30 &quot;compressions,&quot; pressing with only two fingers on the lower half of the bone that crosses the middle of the chest from the neck to the belly (on the chest bone, named sternum, on its part that is the nearest to the belly), at an approximate rhythm of nearly 2 per second.

At the end of the round of compressions, the rescuer looks into the mouth for the obstructing object. And, if it is already visible, the rescuer makes a &quot;try to extract it&quot; (usually using a finger sweep). The rescuer must not confuse a foreign object with the epiglottis: a cartilaginous flap of the throat. It is possible to try to extract the object without seeing it, always carefully: taking it with the fingers, or using a toothpick (maybe, because almost any other tool would be too wide for a baby), but the current protocols do not recommend extracting the object if it is not visible (a blind extraction), because of the risk to sink it deeper by accident, and because the compressions could move the object outside by themselves (in some cases). A rescuer that already knows that the choking object is a bag (or similar) does not need to see the object before trying to extract it (because there is no risk of sinking it much deeper, and it is easy to detect by using the touch carefully). Anyway, if any removal is tried and takes too much time, it may require alternating it with the chest compressions at some moments, without hindering to the extraction. And, being the object extracted or not in this step, this CPR procedure must pass to the next action and continue until the babies can breathe by themselves or emergency medical services arrive.

In the next step of the CPR, the rescuer makes &quot;a rescue breath&quot;, covering the baby&#x27;s mouth and nose simultaneously with the own mouth, and puffing air inside a first time. After that first rescue breath, it is recommended &quot;tilting the baby&#x27;s head&quot; up and down, trying to open a space for the air in that manner, but leaving it approximately straight again, and then giving &quot;an additional rescue breath&quot;, for the second time&quot;.&quot; The rescue breaths usually fail while the object is still blocking, but then the rescuer has only to continue with the next step. Anyway, they can enter and reach the lungs, and then the chest of the baby would be seen rising. If a rescue breath arrived there, it is because the object has been moved to an unknown position that leaves some open space, so it can be useful making the next rescue breaths more softly to avoid moving the object to a new blocking position again, and, in case of those soft rescue breaths are not successful, increasing the strength of blowing in the next ones. The bodies of the babies are delicate, and, when the airway is not clogged, only a little strength in blowing is enough to fill their lungs. The baby&#x27;s colour would improve after some successful rescue breaths. After the rescue breaths, the rescuer has to return to the 30 initial compressions, repeating the same resuscitation cycle again, continually, until the choking baby regains consciousness and breathe normally, or until the object is extracted but a defibrillation is needed to solve a cardiac arrest (read below).

&quot;Defibrillation&quot; can also be needed, because a choking infant that is already unconscious can suffer a cardiac arrest at any moment, due to several possible causes. So it is convenient to ask around for a defibrillator (AED device), for trying a defibrillation on a baby that remains in cardiac arrest after having extracted the stuck object (only if the object has been extracted). Those defibrillators are easy to use, as they emit their instructions with voice messages. One of the pads of the defribrillator (any of them) is attached to the baby&#x27;s chest, and the other pad to the baby&#x27;s back.

==== Pregnant or obese people ====
Some choking victims cannot receive pressure on their bellies. Then, the American Heart Associated recommends substituting the abdominal thrusts for chest thrusts.

These victims can include: patients with serious injuries in the abdomen, pregnant women, and obese patients; however, in the case of the obese victims, if the rescuer is capable enough to effectively wrap their arms around the circumference of the victim&#x27;s abdomen, it is possible to apply the normal first aid against choking, with abdominal thrusts (see details further above).

Chest thrusts are performed in a similar way to the abdominal thrusts, but with the fist placed on the lower half of the vertical bone that is along the middle of the chest (the chest bone, named sternum), rather than on the abdomen. As a reference, in women, the zone of pressure of the chest thrusts would be normally higher than the breasts. It is convenient to avoid placing the knuckles too painfully. Finally, strong inward thrusts are then applied.

The rest of the first aid protocol is the same, starting with asking the victim to cough freely, and then, if the victim cannot cough, the series of chest thrust are alternated with series of slaps on the back. Those back slaps are applied normally: bending forward the back of the victims and supporting their chest with one hand.

If choking remains unresolved, calling to emergency medical services is vital, but first aid should be continued until they arrive.

When the victims with abdominal problems become unconscious, they need the same anti-choking cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedure that is employed for other unconscious choking victims (see details further above).

Preventively, if a person with abdominal problems (as injury, pregnancy, or too much obesity) is present, placing an anti-choking device nearby can be useful.

====In wheelchair-using victims====
If the choking victim is a wheelchair-using person, the procedure is similar to how it is for other victims. The main difference is in trying to apply the techniques directly, while the victim is using the wheelchair.

&quot;Coughing&quot; should be encouraged first before applying the techniques. When the victim cannot cough, it is recommended alternating series of back blows and thrusts, as in other cases.

&quot;Back blows&quot; (back slaps) can be used after substantially bending forward the back of the victim, and supporting the victim&#x27;s chest with the other hand.

&quot;Abdominal and chest thrusts&quot; can also be used. To perform the abdominal thrusts, the rescuer must get behind the wheelchair. Then, the rescuer can embrace the victim&#x27;s abdomen from behind and above, leaning over the top of the wheelchair&#x27;s backrest. If this is too difficult, the rescuer can get down and embrace from behind the victim&#x27;s abdomen and the wheelchair&#x27;s backrest all together. In narrow spaces that cannot be opened, the position can be achieved by turning the victim to one side. Finally, the rescuer would grasp the own hand with the other, place them between the chest and the belly button of the victim, and apply sudden pressures with them on that zone, in a direction of in-and-up. If the victim cannot receive abdominal thrusts (in cases as having serious injuries in the belly, pregnancy, and others), chest thrusts must be used instead. They are applied while the victim is using the wheelchair too, but making sudden inward pressures on the lower half of the breast bone (sternum), which is placed vertically along the middle of the chest. If the space is too narrow and impossible to widen, the abdominal or chest thrusts can be tried by turning the victim to one side.

Rescuers should &quot;alternate between back slaps and chest thrusts repeatedly&quot; until the choking is solved, as in other victims.

If choking remains unresolved, calling to emergency medical services is vital, but first aid should be continued until they arrive.

If a wheelchair-using victim of choking becomes &quot;unconscious&quot;, anti-choking cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be performed, which is the same method also used for able-bodied victims of choking. That said, it can be noted that the victim needs to be removed from the wheelchair and laid face-up on an appropriated surface (not too hard or too soft, and it is possible to put a layer of something between the floor and the victim). While they are on their way, the rescuer should apply anti-choking cardiopulmonary resuscitation for unconscious victims (see details further above).

As a &quot;preventive&quot; measure, it is convenient to avoid placing patients with disabilities in a narrow and encased spaces at mealtimes, as more open spaces allow easier access for rescuers. Besides, placing an anti-choking device nearby is a common safety measure in environments.

==== On the bed but unable to sit up ====
If the choking victim is lying in bed, but is conscious and unable to sit up (such as in patients with disabilities or injuries), &quot;the first aid would be the same, but performed by sitting the patient on the edge of the bed.&quot;

Before adjusting the patient&#x27;s position, the rescuer encourages the victim to cough freely and as forcefully as they can manage. The victim would do it better by turning to one side. When coughing is too difficult or impossible, the rescuer would sit the victim on the bed&#x27;s edge, to make coughing easier or to apply the anti-choking manoeuvers (these are required if the victim cannot cough).

This can be achieved grasping the victim by the legs (behind of the knees, or by the calves or ankles) and rotating them until they are out of the bed. Next, the rescuer would sit the victim up on the edge, pulling the shoulders or arms (in the forearms or wrists). Then it is possible to apply the anti-choking manoeuvers from behind: series of back slaps (after leaning the victim forward, and supporting the chest with one hand) and series of abdominal thrusts (sudden compressions on the part of the victim&#x27;s belly that is between the chest and the belly button, in a direction of in-and-up). When the victim cannot receive abdominal thrusts (in cases as having serious injuries in the belly, pregnancy, and others), the rescuer needs to change them for chest thrusts (sudden pressures inward on the lower half of the breast bone, which is placed vertically along the middle of the chest, from the neck to the belly).

When a rescuer cannot sit the victim up, it is possible to perform chest or abdominal thrusts frontally while the victim is lying on the bed (despite they would be less effective in that horizontal position). They are made by putting one hand on the top of the other and making with both of them strong pressures downwards on the lower half of the breast bone (the sternum), or in a downward-and-frontward direction between the chest and the belly button.

If choking remains unresolved, calling to emergency medical services is vital, but first aid should be continued until they arrive.

When the victims of choking in bed become unconscious, they need the same anti-choking cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedure that is employed for other unconscious choking victims (see details further above).

&quot;Preventively&quot;, it is important to know that eating while laying in bed increases the risk of choking. When a person with a disability or injury is present, a common measure of prevention is placing an anti-choking device at reach.

==== On the floor but unable to sit up ====
It is possible, though rare, that a choking victim would be laying on the floor but conscious. For example, someone having a disability that makes impossible to sit up and to keep standing up on the feet. If this is the case, &quot;the first aid is&quot; &quot;the same, but after sitting the victim on the floor&quot;.

Before adjusting the patient&#x27;s position, the rescuer asks the victim to cough freely and with strength. The victim would cough better by turning to a side. If coughing is too difficult or impossible, the rescuer would sit the victim up, to make it easier or to apply anti-choking maneuvers (these are needed when the victim cannot cough).

A rescuer would sit the victim up by pulling the shoulders or arms (in the forearms or wrists). When the victim is sitting up, the rescuer can sit behind to apply the anti-choking manoeuvers: back slaps (after bending very much the back of the victim, and supporting the chest with one hand) and abdominal thrusts (sudden compressions in a direction of in-and-up, on the part of the victim&#x27;s belly that is between the chest and the belly button). When victims cannot receive abdominal thrusts properly (as the seriously injured in the belly, and the pregnant women), the rescuer needs to change them for chest thrusts (sudden pressures inward on the lower half of the breast bone, which is placed vertically along the middle of the chest, from the neck to the belly).

In some situations it is impossible to sit the victim up, and then the rescuer can try one of the thrusts techniques to the front of their abdomen and chest (even though this is less effective, it could be the only option and therefore worth a try). Anyway, they can be made by putting one hand on the top of the other and using them to make strong pressures downwards on the lower half of the breast bone (the sternum), or downwards-and-frontwards on the abdomen (between the chest and the belly button).

If choking remains unresolved, calling to emergency medical services is vital, but first aid should be continued until they arrive.

If the victim is unconscious, it is needed the same anti-choking cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedure that is used in other unconscious choking victims (see details further above).

In the &quot;prevention&quot; of choking, it can be remembered the practice of placing an anti-choking device around people with disabilities.

==== Seizing victim ====
Seizing can occur for a multitude of reasons, but is common in those diagnosed with epilepsy. During a seizure, victims may experience strangulation or throat constriction during consciousness. The victim will not have control of their bodily functions and will need someone to create a safe area for them. One should clear a space where the victim can lay down and remove or loosen anything that is around their neck. Then one should turn them on their side as to help them breathe and to avoid potential choking on the saliva.

=== Self-treatment ===

First aid anti-choking techniques can be applied on oneself if others are not around to perform general first aid. This can include carrying an approved anti-choking device nearby (see above) or conducting first aid techniques on oneself, mainly by hand:

The most widely recommended manoeuver consists of positioning ones own abdomen over the border of an object: usually a chairback, but it could work on an armchair, railing or countertop, and then &quot;driving the abdomen upon the border&quot;, making sharp thrusts in an inwards-an-upwards direction. It is possible to &quot;place a fist or both fists between the chosen border and the belly&quot;, to increase the pressure of the manoeuver and make it easier (depending on the situation). It is also possible trying to fall on the edge, aiming to achieve more pressure in that way. Other variation of this consists in pressing one&#x27;s own belly with an appropriated object, in an inwards-and-upwards direction.

Additionally, &quot;abdominal thrusts can be self-applied&quot; only with the hands. This is achieved by making a fist, grasping it with the other hand, and placing them on the area located between the chest and the belly button. Then the body is bent forward and the hands make strong compressions pressing in an inwards-an-upwards direction. One study concluded that the self-administered abdominal thrusts were as effective as those performed by another person.

When certain scenarios make it impossible for self treatment with abdominal thrust (serious injuries, pregnancy, or obesity), the &quot;self application of chest thrusts&quot; is recommended, although more difficult. This would be achieved by leaning the body forward, making a fist, grasping it with the other hand, and doing strong compressions inwards with both of them on the lower half of the chest bone (the sternum, the bone that crosses vertically the middle of the chest). It is convenient to relax the chest for a better reception. Other variation of this is the use of an appropriated object to press inwards in the same point, being equally convenient to receive the compressions when the chest is relaxed.
Making attempts to cough, when it is possible, can also aid in clearing the airway.

Alternatively, multiple sources of evidence suggest applying the head-down (inverse) position. is a promising self treatment. To perform this manoeuver, put your hands on the floor and then place the knees on an upper seat (as on a bed, a sofa, or an armchair). Additional movements up or down can be attempted in this position.

=== Advanced treatment ===
There are many advanced medical treatments available to relieve choking or airway obstruction, including the removal of a foreign object with the help of a laryngoscope or bronchoscope. The use of any commercial approved anti-choking device, if it is available nearby, may be a more abrupt solution, but brief.

A cricothyrotomy may be performed as an emergency procedure when the stuck object cannot be removed. This is an intervention that involves severing a little opening in the patient&#x27;s neck (between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage, until reaching the trachea) and inserting there a tube to introduce air through it, bypassing the upper airways. Usually, this procedure is only performed by someone with knowledge about it and surgical skills, when the patient is already unconscious.

== Prevention ==
The time to react to choking is quite brief, and choking can be lethal in the worst cases. For these reasons, it is convenient to prevent it, so that it does not happen.

=== General prevention ===
Choking usually happens by swallowing mouthfuls that are too large or too abundant, and have been badly chewed. To reduce this risk, food is split into pieces of a moderate size, and chewed thoroughly before swallowing. Whenever a food can be chewed, it must be chewed, no matter whatever it is, even if it is very soft or gelatinous (such as creams, jellies and soft desserts).

The most dangerous foods for choking are the dry ones, the doughy ones, and the elongated ones. It is useful to have some liquid near, so it can be drunk and help to finish swallowing (before choking has happened and is already complete).

To swallow correctly, it is recommended that the neck be in a normal position, with the head looking forward, and being sitting down or standing up (not lying down or too reclined).

Distractions and being absent-minded increase the risk of choking, as when one laughs or does an activity at the same time. For this reason, eating while under the effects of sleep (not completely awake) also increases the possibilities of choking. The danger also increases in the case of being under the influence of alcohol, drugs or some medications that affect to perception or reaction capabilities. Eating in mouthfuls require some care.

It is convenient to place anti-choking devices in public sites, events, risk areas and homes, to solve the cases of swallowing that can happen there.

=== Prevention for babies and children ===
All young children require care in eating, and they must learn to chew their food completely to avoid choking. Feeding them while they are running, playing, laughing, etc. increases the risk of choking. Caregivers must supervise children while eating or playing.

Pediatricians and dentists can provide information on various age groups to parents and caregivers about which food and toys are appropriate to prevent choking. 

It is recommended waiting until 6 months of age before introducing solid foods to infants (according to the American Academy of Pediatricians). Caregivers should avoid giving children younger than 5 years-old foods that pose a high risk of choking, such as hot dog pieces, bananas, cheese sticks, cheese chunks, hard candy, nuts, grapes, marshmallows, or popcorn. Later, when they are accustomed to these foods, it is recommended to serve them split into small pieces. Some foods as hot dogs, bananas, or grapes are usually split lengthwise, sliced, or both (being the cut into slices the main part for safety in many long-shaped foods).

Children readily put small objects into their mouths (deflated balloons, marbles, small pieces, buttons, coins, button batteries, etc.), which can lead to choking. A complicated obstruction for babies is choking on deflated balloons (including preservatives) or plastic bags. This also includes the nappy sacks, used for wrapping the dirty diapers, which are sometimes dangerously placed near the babies. To prevent children from swallowing things, precautions should be taken in the environment to keep dangerous objects out of their reach. Small children must be supervised closely and taught to avoid putting things into their mouths. Toys and games may indicate on their packages the ages for which they are safe. In the US, children&#x27;s toy and product manufacturers are required by law to apply appropriate warning labels to their packaging, but toys that are resold may not have them. Caregivers can try to prevent choking by considering the features of a toy (such as size, shape, consistency and small parts) before giving it to a child. Children&#x27;s products that are found to pose a choking risk can be taken off the market.

Parents, teachers, and other caregivers for children are advised to be trained in choking first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

==== Anticipatory guidance from pediatricians ====
As a part of well-visits, pediatricians provide education to parents and their children regarding their development. Included in these visits is anticipatory guidance, which provides advice to parents and children as primary prevention of disease and illness including choking. For example, for a child that is 7–9 months old, children start to develop a pincer grasp allowing them to reach for objects. The ability to place these objects in their mouths significantly increases choking risk.

Example anticipatory guidance for children 7–9 months old:

* Infants should avoid moving when feeding like riding in a car or stroller. Infants should be sitting upright and remain still. 
* Infants should be supervised when feeding including children younger than 3 years old 
* Infants will try to feed themselves. Avoid foods such as grapes, popcorn, carrots, nuts, and hard candies. Difficult to swallow foods like peanut butter and marshmallows should be given with caution.
* Specifically, toys like marbles, balls, balloons should not be given including children younger than 3 years old.

====Regulations for children in the United States====

Several laws and commissions are aimed at preventing choking hazards in children. Formed in 1972, alongside the passing of the Consumer Products Safety Act, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) regulates consumer projects that may pose &quot;unreasonable risk&quot; of injury to its users. The Consumer Products Safety Act allowed the CPSC to ban or place warnings on objects that could harm consumers. A Small Parts Test Fixture (SPTF) is a cylinder measuring 2.25 inches long by 1.25 inches wide determines whether a choking hazarding warning will be placed on the product. Furthermore, in 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement requires any advertisements or websites regarding sale of a product to display choking hazard warnings.  

According to a 1991 study, warning labels are an effective preventive measure against choking accidents. Items that contain many parts may include pieces that are considered choking hazards. Labels on children&#x27;s toys may state recommended age ranges, and other items may carry a warning to parents to keep them out of the reach of children. Warning labels are clearly placed and written, usually including an obvious image.

While products are protected, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations regarding food choking hazards.

=== Prevention for other groups at risk ===
Some population groups have a higher risk of choking, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities (physically or mentally), people under the effects of alcohol or drugs, people who have taken medications that reduce the ability to salivate or react, patients with difficulties in swallowing (dysphagia), suicidal individuals, people with epilepsy, and people on the autism spectrum. They may require more assistance to feed themselves, and it may be necessary to supervise them while they eat.

As the ability to eat is deteriorating, some problematic foods (such as hot dogs, sausages, bananas, or grapes) can be split into slices and, additionally, lengthwise (being the cut into slices the main part for safety in many long-shaped foods). People who are unable to chew properly should not be served hard food. In cases where a person is unable to safely eat, food can be given by feeding syringes.

People who have taken any medication that reduces saliva should not eat solid food until their salivation is restored.

<doc id="166830" wikidata="Q2673235" url="?curid=166830" title="Sylvia Anderson">
<text>Sylvia Beatrice Anderson (; 25 March 1927 – 15 March 2016) was an English television and film producer, writer, voice actress and costume designer, best known for her collaborations with Gerry Anderson, her husband between 1960 and 1981. In addition to serving as co-creator and co-writer on their TV series during the 1960s and early 1970s, Anderson&#x27;s primary contribution was character development and costume design. She regularly directed the fortnightly voice recording sessions, and provided the voices of many female and child characters. She also helped develop the shows and characters, in particular creating the iconic characters of Lady Penelope and Parker in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in Camberwell, London, England on 25 March 1927. Her father, Sidney Thomas, was a champion boxer, and her mother, Beatrice (), a dressmaker.

After graduating from the London School of Economics with a degree in sociology and political science, she became a social worker. She emigrated to the United States to live with her first husband, Jack Brooks, an American golfer. While in America she worked as a journalist.

==Career==
Anderson returned to the United Kingdom in 1955 with her daughter. She joined the newly founded and short-lived Polytechnic Films as an office assistant in 1957. There, she met Gerry Anderson, an editor and director. That year, when Anderson and Arthur Provis created AP Films following Polytechnic&#x27;s collapse, she joined them on the board of directors of the new company, alongside their colleagues John Read and Reg Hill.

===Collaboration with Gerry Anderson===
In 1957 AP Films was commissioned by writer Roberta Leigh to produce films based on her children&#x27;s stories, including &quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot; and &quot;Torchy the Battery Boy&quot;. Sylvia Anderson worked on these projects as a production assistant. In late 1960 the couple married, and she developed a wider role in production duties.

The couple worked together as a team, co-writing and co-creating the first episode of a series then sharing the work according to their strengths. Gerry tended to specialise in special effects and hardware, and Sylvia in character, voices, costume, dialogue and plotlines.

In this way, Anderson contributed plot development and voice work for a series of half-hour shows including &quot;Supercar&quot;, &quot;Stingray&quot; and &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;. The &quot;Supercar&quot; end titles credit her (as Sylvia Thamm) as the dialogue director, a task which she would also handle in other projects. However, she felt the half-hour format was insufficient to fully develop characters and stories, and she persuaded the team&#x27;s TV producer Lew Grade to extend their shows to a full hour.

In the early 1960s, the Andersons co-created the series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, and Sylvia created the characters. She was aware that Grade intended to sell the show to American TV networks and wanted to make the show appealing to American audiences, hence she introduced the &quot;British aristocrat&quot; character of Lady Penelope, and Parker her &quot;Cockney chauffeur&quot;.

Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, an aristocratic fashionista who was an undercover agent, was to become one of her most popular characters; Anderson both created the character and provided her voice. AP Films puppet designer Mary Turner used Anderson as the template for the creation of the Lady Penelope puppets, a decision of which Anderson was not immediately aware. Interviewed by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in 1968, Turner commented: &quot;we wanted a glamorous blonde and [Anderson] was the obvious choice.&quot; In 1966 and 1968, Anderson produced two feature-length films based on the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; story, &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; and &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot;.

She was co-creator with Gerry Anderson for the series &quot;UFO&quot; (1969–1970) on which she co-produced, was responsible for fashions on the show and did the majority of the casting.

The Andersons&#x27; creative partnership ended when their marriage broke down during the production of the first series of &quot;&quot; in 1975. Gerry announced his intention to separate on the evening of the wrap party, following which Sylvia ceased her involvement with the company, which by this time had twice been renamed and was now called Group Three.

===Talent scout and writing===
In 1983 she published a novel titled &quot;Love and Hisses&quot; and in 1994 she reprised her voice role as Lady Penelope for an episode of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. She worked as a London-based talent scout for HBO for 30 years.

Her autobiography, &quot;Yes M&#x27;Lady&quot;, was first published in 1991; in 2007, it was re-published as &quot;My FAB Years&quot; with new material to bring it up to date with the latest developments in her life, such as her role as a production consultant for the 2004 live-action film adaptation of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

Of the film, Anderson commented, &quot;I&#x27;m personally thrilled that the production team have paid us the great compliment of bringing to life our original concept for the big screen. If we had made it ourselves (and we have had over 30 years to do it!) we could not have improved on this new version. It is a great tribute to the original creative team who inspired the movie all those years ago. It was a personal thrill for me to see my characters come to life on the big screen.&quot; &quot;My FAB Years&quot; was re-released as a spoken CD, narrated by Anderson, in 2010.

===Late career and charity work===
In 2013, Anderson worked with her daughter Dee, a jazz singer, on a concept for a new TV series named &quot;The Last Station&quot;.

In 2015, Anderson briefly returned to the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; universe, when she guest-starred in an episode of the reboot TV series, &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot;, as Great Aunt Sylvia, a relative of Lady Penelope.

Anderson was also known for her charity work, particularly in support of Breast Cancer Care and Barnardo&#x27;s.

===Recognition===
In 1966, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; received the Royal Television Society Silver Medal.

In 2015, Anderson travelled to Italy to receive a Pulcinella Award in recognition of her career in television production.

==Personal life==
In 1946, Anderson married Jack Brooks, with whom she had a daughter, Dee. The marriage ended in divorce and in 1952 she married George Thamm, this marriage also ending in divorce. Her third marriage, in 1960, was to Gerry Anderson, with whom she had a son, Dr. Gerry Anderson Jr. (1967–2023), before divorcing Anderson in 1981.

Anderson died from an intracerebral haemorrhage at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough on 15 March 2016, aged 88.

<text>Gerald Alexander Anderson (; 14 April 1929 – 26 December 2012) was an English television and film producer, director, writer and occasional voice artist, who is known for his futuristic television programmes, especially his 1960s productions filmed with &quot;Supermarionation&quot; (marionette puppets containing electric moving parts).

Anderson&#x27;s first television production was the 1957 Roberta Leigh children&#x27;s series &quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot; (1957–58). &quot;Torchy the Battery Boy&quot; (1960), and &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot; (1960) followed. &quot;Supercar&quot; (1961–62) and &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; (1962–63) came next, both series breaking into the U.S. television market in the early 1960s. In the mid-1960s Anderson produced his most successful series, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. Other television productions of the period included &quot;Stingray&quot;, &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; and &quot;Joe 90&quot;.

Anderson also wrote and produced several feature films, including &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; (aka &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot;, 1969). Following a shift towards live-action productions in the 1970s, he had a long and successful association with media impresario Lew Grade and Grade&#x27;s company ITC, continuing until the second series of &quot;&quot;.

After a lull in which a number of new series failed to materialise, Anderson began a new phase in his career the early 1980s, when nostalgia for his earlier Supermarionation series, prompted by Saturday morning re-runs in Britain and Australia, led to new commissions. Later projects included a 2005 CG remake of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; titled &quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot;. Anderson died in 2012.

==Early life==
Gerald Alexander Abrahams was born in the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Obstetric Hospital in Bloomsbury, London, and spent the early years of his life in Kilburn, and Neasden, London. He was educated at Kingsgate Infants School in Kilburn and Braintcroft Junior and Senior schools in Neasden, prior to winning a scholarship to Willesden County Grammar School. His parents were Deborah (&quot;née&quot; Leonoff) and Joseph Abrahams.

At the start of the Second World War, Gerry Anderson&#x27;s elder brother, Lionel, volunteered for service in the Royal Air Force (RAF); he was stationed in the United States for advanced training. Lionel often wrote letters to his family, and in one letter described a US Army Air Forces air base called Thunderbird Field, the name of which stayed in his younger brother&#x27;s memory. Lionel was killed in action on 27 April 1944 when his de Havilland Mosquito was shot down over the Netherlands.

On 16 October 1952, Anderson married Betty Wrightman (1929–2021). They had two daughters.

==Television, film and military career==
Anderson began his career in photography, earning a traineeship with the British Colonial Film Unit after the war. He developed an interest in film editing and moved on to Gainsborough Pictures, where he gained further experience. In 1947, he was conscripted for national service with the RAF, and was based at RAF Manston, an airfield near Margate. He served part of his time in air-traffic control.

Two incidents in his final year with the RAF had a profound effect on Anderson. The first occurred during an aircraft display on 18 September 1948 commemorating the Battle of Britain, when a Mosquito aircraft crashed on a road crowded with occupied cars; reports on the death toll ranged between twelve and 20 people. On another occasion, a Spitfire was coming in to land. It was only about above the ground before the runway controller alerted the pilot to the fact the plane&#x27;s undercarriage hadn&#x27;t lowered. The pilot opened up the throttle and climbed away. As this was a moment Anderson always remembered, he found it all too easy to write about aircraft when he devised stories for &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. After completing his military service, he returned to Gainsborough, where he worked until the studio was closed in 1950. He then worked freelance on a series of feature films.

In the mid-1950s, Anderson joined the independent television production company Polytechnic Studios as a director, where he met cameraman Arthur Provis. After Polytechnic collapsed, Anderson, Provis, Reg Hill and John Read formed Pentagon Films in 1955. Pentagon was wound up soon after and Anderson and Provis formed a new company, AP Films, for Anderson-Provis Films, with Hill and Read as their partners. Anderson continued his freelance directing work to obtain funds to maintain the fledgling company.

AP Films&#x27; first television venture was produced for Granada Television. Created by Roberta Leigh, &quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot; (1957–1958) was a series for young children about a doll with the ability to &#x27;twizzle&#x27; his arms and legs to greater lengths. It was Anderson&#x27;s first work with puppets, and the start of his long and successful collaborations with puppeteer Christine Glanville, special effects technician Derek Meddings and composer/arranger Barry Gray. It was Anderson&#x27;s desire to move into live-action television.

&quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot; was followed by another low-budget puppet series with Leigh, &quot;Torchy the Battery Boy&quot; (1958–1959). Although the APF puppet productions made the Andersons world-famous, Anderson was always unhappy about working with puppets. He used them primarily to get attention from and a good reputation with TV networks, hoping to have them serve as a stepping stone to his goal of making live-action film and TV drama.

===Supermarionation===
During the production of &quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot;, Anderson started an affair with secretary Sylvia Thamm. Following his divorce from his first wife, Anderson married Thamm in November 1960.

AP Films&#x27; third series was the children&#x27;s western fantasy-adventure series &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot; (1959–60). Provis left the partnership, but the company retained the name AP Films for several more years. &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot; was the first Anderson series to use an early version of the so-called &quot;Supermarionation&quot; process, though this term had yet to be used.

Despite APF&#x27;s success with &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, Granada did not commission another series from them, so Anderson took up the offer to direct a film for Anglo-Amalgamated Studios. &quot;Crossroads to Crime&quot; was a low-budget B-grade crime thriller, and although Anderson hoped that its success might enable him to move into mainstream film-making, it failed at the box office.

By this time, APF was in financial trouble and the company was struggling to find a buyer for their new puppet series. They were rescued by a fortuitous meeting with Lew Grade, the Associated Television (ATV) boss who offered to buy the show. This began a long friendship and a very successful professional association between the two men.

The new series, &quot;Supercar&quot;, (1960–61) was developed by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and Reg Hill based on a story written by Sylvia Anderson and marked several important advances for APF. Sylvia took on a larger role and became a partner in the company. The series was also the official debut of Supermarionation, the electronic system that made the marionettes more lifelike and convincing on screen. The system used the audio signal from pre-recorded tapes of the actors&#x27; voices to trigger solenoids installed in the heads of the puppets, making their lips move in synchronisation with the voices of the actors, and actresses.
One of Anderson&#x27;s most successful ventures was inaugurated during the production of &quot;Supercar&quot;. The establishment of AP Films (Merchandising) Ltd, a separate company set up to handle the licensing of merchandising rights for APF properties, was headed by Keith Shackleton (not the wildlife artist and TV presenter of the same name), a longtime friend of Anderson&#x27;s from their National Service days.

The next series by APF was the futuristic space adventure &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; (1962). At the time it was the company&#x27;s biggest success, garnering the honour of being the only Anderson series sold to an American TV network, NBC. Around this time, Anderson also saw his Supermarionation style attract imitators—most notably &quot;Space Patrol (US title: Planet Patrol)&quot; which used similar techniques and was made by several former employees and associates of Anderson, including Arthur Provis and Roberta Leigh.

After the completion of &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, Lew Grade offered to buy AP Films. Although Anderson was initially reluctant, the deal eventually went ahead, with Grade becoming the managing director, and the Andersons, Hill, and Read becoming directors of the company.

Shortly after the buy-out, APF began production on a new marionette series, &quot;Stingray&quot; (1964), the first Supermarionation-based British TV series to be filmed in colour. For the new production APF moved to new studios in Slough. The new and bigger facilities allowed them to make major improvements in special effects, notably in the underwater sequences, as well as advances in marionette technology, with the use of a variety of interchangeable heads for each character to convey different expressions.

===&quot;Thunderbirds&quot;===

APF&#x27;s next project for ATV was inspired by a mining disaster that occurred in West Germany in October 1963. This real-life drama inspired Anderson to create a new programme format about a rescue organisation, which eventually became his most famous and popular series, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; (1965–1966). The dramatic title was inspired by the letter Anderson&#x27;s older brother Lionel had written to his family during World War II.

Grade was very enthusiastic about the concept and agreed to back a series of 25-minute episodes (the same length as &quot;Stingray&quot;), so the Andersons scripted a pilot episode, &quot;Trapped in the Sky&quot;, and began production. Anderson initially wanted actress Fenella Fielding to perform the voice of Lady Penelope, but Sylvia convinced her husband that she herself ought to play the role. &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; also marked the start of a long professional association with actor Shane Rimmer, who voiced Scott Tracy.

Production on &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; had been under way for several months when Grade saw the completed 25-minute version of &quot;Trapped in the Sky&quot;. He was so excited by the result that he insisted that the episodes be extended to fifty minutes. With a substantial increase in budget, the production was restructured to expand episodes already filmed or in pre-production, and create new 50-minute scripts for the remainder. Grade and others were so convinced that &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; would be a success that a feature-film version of the series was proposed even before the pilot episode went to air. At this approximate time, APF was renamed Century 21 Productions.

After APF was renamed Century 21 Productions, it enjoyed its greatest success with &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, and the series made the Andersons world famous. However, it was cancelled midway through the second series because Grade was unable to sell the show to an American network. Despite being wildly popular in the UK and abroad, Grade felt that without an American buyer, a full second series would fail to recoup its cost. It would later find moderate success in the United States through syndication.

During the production of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; the Andersons&#x27; marriage began to come under increasing strain, and the company also had a setback when the feature film &quot;Thunderbirds Are GO&quot; surprisingly flopped. In later interviews, Anderson said that he considered divorce, but this was halted when Sylvia announced that she was pregnant. Their son, Gerry Anderson Jr., was born in July 1967.

By that time, production had started on a new series, &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; (1967), which saw the advent of more realistic marionette characters which, thanks to improvements in electronics which allowed miniaturisation of the lip-sync mechanisms, could now be built closer to normal human proportions.

Century 21&#x27;s second feature film, &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot;, was also unsuccessful, and the problems were compounded by their next (and penultimate) Supermarionation series, &quot;Joe 90&quot; (1968). This series returned to more &#x27;kid-friendly&#x27; territory, depicting the adventures of a young boy who is also a secret agent and whose scientist father uses a supercomputer called &#x27;BIG RAT&#x27; which can &#x27;program&#x27; Joe with special knowledge and abilities for his missions. Its relatively poor reception made it the last of the classic Anderson marionette shows.

===Live-action work===
Anderson&#x27;s next project took the special effects expertise built up over previous TV projects and combined it with live action. Century 21&#x27;s third feature film, &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; (1969) (released internationally as &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot;) was a dark, &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;-style sci-fi project about an astronaut who travels to a newly discovered planet on the opposite side of the sun, which proves to be an exact mirror-image of Earth, starring American actor Roy Thinnes. Although it was not a major commercial success, &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for its special effects.

Century 21&#x27;s return to television was the abortive series &quot;The Secret Service&quot;, which this time mixed live action with Supermarionation. The series was inspired by Anderson&#x27;s love of British comedian Stanley Unwin, who was known for his nonsense language, &#x27;Unwinese&#x27;, which he created and used on radio, in film and most famously on the 1968 Small Faces LP &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot;. Despite Anderson&#x27;s track record and Unwin&#x27;s popularity, the series was cancelled before its first screening; Lew Grade considered that it would be incomprehensible to American audiences, and thus unsellable.

In 1969 the Andersons began production of a new TV series, &quot;UFO&quot;, Century 21&#x27;s first full live-action television series. This sci-fi action-adventure series starred American-born actor Ed Bishop (who had also provided the voice of Captain Blue in &quot;Captain Scarlet &amp; The Mysterons&quot;) as Commander Edward Straker, head of the secret defence organisation SHADO, set up to counter an alien invasion. &quot;UFO&quot; was more adult in tone than any of Anderson&#x27;s puppet series, and mixed Century 21&#x27;s signature futuristic action-adventure and special effects with serious dramatic elements. &quot;UFO&quot; was the last series made under the Century 21 Productions banner.

During production of &quot;UFO,&quot; Anderson was approached directly by Harry Saltzman (at the time co-producer of the James Bond film series with Albert &quot;Cubby&quot; Broccoli), and was invited to write and produce the next film in the series, which was to be &quot;Moonraker.&quot; Collaborating with Tony Barwick to provide the characterisation, whilst he himself focused on the action sequences, Anderson wrote and delivered a treatment to Saltzman. Nothing ultimately came of it, and Broccoli and Saltzman proceeded to make &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971) and &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973) and, after co-producing 1974&#x27;s Bond film, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, the Saltzman-Broccoli partnership dissolved. Offered £20,000 for the treatment, Anderson refused, fearing that if he accepted he would not be at the helm when it was made; the next Bond film to be made was 1977&#x27;s &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me.&quot; (This film used only the title of the actual Ian Fleming novel.) Anderson started legal proceedings against Broccoli for plagiarism of story elements but withdrew the action shortly after, nervous of the legal might lined up against him. He relinquished the treatment, and received £3,000 in compensation. A film version of &quot;Moonraker&quot; was eventually produced in 1979, but did not involve any of Anderson&#x27;s material.

By the time &quot;UFO&quot; concluded, the relationship between the Andersons had deteriorated. Although produced under the aegis of a new company, Group Three Productions (the three being both of the Andersons and Reg Hill), Anderson decided not to work with his wife on his next project, the ITC action series &quot;The Protectors&quot;. It was one of Anderson&#x27;s few non-original projects. Lew Grade himself was heavily involved in the programme, and cast both the lead actors, Robert Vaughn and Nyree Dawn Porter. The production was difficult for Anderson, who clashed with the famously difficult Vaughn. There were also many logistical problems arising from the Europe-wide filming of the show, but it was very successful in both the UK and America and its theme song &quot;Avenues and Alleyways&quot; became a hit record in the UK for singer Tony Christie. It was also the first live-action series produced by Anderson to survive to a second season.

===&quot;Space: 1999&quot;===
Following &quot;The Protectors&quot;, Anderson worked on several new projects, none of which he was able to take into production. A proposed second series of &quot;UFO&quot; was not undertaken, and a return to marionettes in the television pilot for a series called &quot;The Investigator&quot; failed to find a buyer. Elements of the abandoned second series of &quot;UFO&quot; were eventually turned into what became the most expensive television series ever made at that time, &quot;&quot;.

Another futuristic science-fiction adventure, it was based on the premise that a huge thermonuclear explosion on the Moon&#x27;s surface (caused by the storage of nuclear waste there) projected the Moon out of orbit and into interplanetary space. The series starred the American husband-and-wife actors Martin Landau and Barbara Bain, who had gained international fame in the TV series &quot;&quot;. They were cast at the insistence of Grade, and against Sylvia Anderson&#x27;s strenuous objections.

The Andersons&#x27; marriage broke down during the first series of &quot;Space: 1999&quot; in 1975; Gerry announced his intention to separate on the evening of the wrap party. Sylvia severed her ties with Group Three, and, to alleviate his financial plight, Anderson sold his share of the profits from the APF/Century 21 shows and their holiday home in Portugal to Lew Grade.

Between making the two series of &quot;Space: 1999&quot;, Anderson produced a one-off television special, &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; (also known as &quot;Into Infinity&quot;), about two spacefaring families en route to Alpha Centauri, for an NBC series of programmes illustrating current scientific theory for popular consumption. While making this project, Anderson met Mary Robins (b. 1949), a secretary working at the studios; they began a relationship and were married on 11 April 1981.

&quot;Space: 1999&quot; was successful enough that a second (and final) series went into production in 1976 with American producer Fred Freiberger brought in to replace Sylvia Anderson. Freiberger was known for producing the final season of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Under Freiberger the series underwent a number of cast and cosmetic changes. &quot;Space: 1999&quot; marked the end of Anderson&#x27;s association with ATV.

By the late 1970s, Anderson&#x27;s life and career were at a low point: he was in financial difficulty, found it hard to get work, and he experienced family difficulties.

===1980s===
By December 1980, Gerry and Sylvia&#x27;s marriage was officially over, and they divorced. In 1981, episodes of many of Anderson&#x27;s Supermarionation series were edited together as films, aired as &quot;Super Space Theatre&quot;. A number of similarly reedited feature-length productions were also syndicated and released on home video, such as &quot;Destination: Moonbase Alpha&quot;, a reedited version of a two-part &quot;Space: 1999&quot; storyline. Some of these films were marketed in the US as part of a series of action-adventure videos featuring specially shot introductions by actress Sybil Danning.

In the early 1980s, Anderson formed a new partnership, Anderson Burr Pictures Ltd, with businessman Christopher Burr. The new company&#x27;s first production was based on an unrealised concept devised by Anderson in the late 1970s for a Japanese cartoon series. &quot;Terrahawks&quot; marked Anderson&#x27;s return to working with puppets, but rather than marionettes this series used a new system dubbed &#x27;Supermacromation&#x27; which used highly sophisticated glove puppets—an approach inspired by the advances in this form of marionation made by Jim Henson and his colleagues.

It featured another reuse of the &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;/&quot;UFO&quot; formula of a secret organisation defending against aliens. &quot;Terrahawks&quot; ran successfully from 1983 to 1986 in the UK but fell short of a four-year American syndication deal by one season when the show was cancelled. &quot;Terrahawks&quot; retains a cult following to this day. Anderson had claimed on record that he would rather forget the show.

Anderson hoped to continue his renewed success with a series called &quot;Space Police&quot;, a new show mixing live action and puppets. The &quot;Space Police&quot; name had already been registered by another company, so Anderson&#x27;s programme eventually emerged in 1995 as &quot;Space Precinct&quot;. A pilot film had previously been made with Shane Rimmer, but it took almost ten years to get the concept to the screen. In the meantime, Anderson and Burr produced the cult stop-motion animated series &quot;Dick Spanner&quot;, which enjoyed many showings on the British Channel 4 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was the final project completed by Anderson Burr. Anderson then joined the Moving Picture Company as a commercials director, and provided special effects direction for the musical comedy &quot;Return to the Forbidden Planet&quot;.

===1990s===
The cult appeal of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and the other Supermarionation series grew steadily over the years and was celebrated by comedy and stage productions such as the hit two-man stage revue &quot;Thunderbirds FAB&quot;. In the early 1990s, ITC began releasing home video versions of the Supermarionation shows, and the profile of the shows was further enhanced by productions such as the Dire Straits music video for their single &quot;Calling Elvis&quot;, which was made as an affectionate &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; pastiche (with Anderson co-producing), and by Lady Penelope and Parker appearing in a series of UK advertisements for Swinton Insurance.

In 1991 Gerry asked journalist and author Simon Archer to write his biography, following an interview by the latter for a series of articles for &quot;Century 21&quot; magazine. In September that year in the UK, BBC2 began a repeat showing of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, which rivalled the success of its original run a generation before. This was also surprisingly the series&#x27; network television premiere, having never been shown nationally by ITV. It became so popular in Britain that toy manufacturers Matchbox were unable to keep up with the demand for the Tracy Island playset, leading children&#x27;s show &quot;Blue Peter&quot; to broadcast a segment showing children how to construct their own for a second time, the first being during the original run. The fan base for the Anderson shows was now worldwide and growing steadily, and Anderson found himself in demand for personal and media appearances.

In response to this greater demand Anderson performed a successful one-man show in 1992, which Archer had written and constructed. Entitled &quot;An Evening with Gerry Anderson&quot;, it took the form of an illustrated lecture in which he talked about his career, and his most popular shows. He also made numerous media and personal appearances to tie in with revivals and video cassette releases of &quot;Stingray&quot;, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; and &quot;Joe 90&quot;.

Anderson was interviewed for the BBC&#x27;s 1993 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; documentary, &quot;Thirty Years in the TARDIS&quot;. He joked that, despite his career of making children&#x27;s programming, the &quot;real tragedy of my life&quot; was that his own son Jamie (appearing with him) was a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fanatic.

By 1993 Archer published the trivia book &quot;Gerry Anderson&#x27;s FAB Facts&quot;. Archer was killed in a car crash on London&#x27;s orbital M25 motorway on his way to the publishers to collect one of the first print run to present to Anderson, and the book later had to be withdrawn from sale and thousands of copies destroyed as a result of a copyright dispute with ITC America.

The renewed interest enabled Anderson to return to television production, but several projects including &quot;GFI&quot; (an animated update of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;) did not make it into production. Finally, in 1994, Anderson was able to get &quot;Space Precinct&quot; into production. It was followed by &quot;Lavender Castle&quot;, a children&#x27;s sci-fi fantasy series combining stop-motion animation and computer-generated imagery.

In the meantime, the biography, which had been set aside since Archer&#x27;s death, had been picked up again and was completed by Stan Nicholls from Archer&#x27;s original notes and manuscript, finally being published in 1996 shortly before &quot;Lavender Castle&quot; went into production.

Around this time Anderson was reunited with his elder son, Gerry Jr., Anderson reportedly experienced powerful feelings of animosity toward his ex-wife Sylvia at the idea she had been responsible for his enforced estrangement from his son.

===Later career===
By December 1999, Anderson was working on plans for a sequel to &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;, and he showed early test reels at a few fan conventions. These reels had the visual design and characters looking very much as they had in the original show, although the vehicle designs had been somewhat modernised. Several years after the initial tests the project evolved into the remake &quot;New Captain Scarlet,&quot; by which time the entire appearance had been significantly updated.

Anderson was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 2001 Birthday Honours for services to Animation.

Along with his business partner John Needham, Anderson created another new series entitled &quot;Firestorm&quot;, financed by Japanese investors and featured anime style animation. Other planned shows with other Japanese backers, including &quot;Eternity&quot; failed to come to fruition. &quot;Firestorm&quot; was sold throughout south-east Asia. Anderson and Needham parted company in 2003.

Anderson was originally approached to be involved in a live-action feature film adaptation of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; as far back as 1996, but he was actually turned away by the producers of the 2004 film &quot;Thunderbirds,&quot; which was directed by Jonathan Frakes, after first being invited to meet with them. He distanced himself overtly from the project, later turning down an offer of $750,000 simply to write an endorsement of the film shortly before its release; Sylvia Anderson served as a consultant on the project and received a &quot;special thanks&quot; credit in the film. The film received poor critical reviews and was unsuccessful at the US box-office. Anderson disliked the film, describing it as &quot;the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my life&quot;.

&quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot; finally premiered in the UK in February 2005. The show cost £23 million to produce and was the most expensive children&#x27;s programme ever to be made in the UK (until Ragdoll&#x27;s &quot;In the Night Garden&quot; came out 2 years later). Many companies invested in producing toys and merchandise. Broadcaster ITV incorporated episodes into &quot;Ministry of Mayhem&quot;, an existing children&#x27;s show, and showed it in two halves, separated by games and adverts. Disappointing merchandising sales followed. The accompanying comic lasted only six editions before being scrapped by its publishers. Anderson&#x27;s displeasure at ITV&#x27;s handling of the show was widely reported. The series was subsequently released on DVD.

2005 also saw the 40th anniversary of &quot;Thunderbirds,&quot; and a wide range of merchandise was produced to celebrate the event. In 2006, ITV re-ran the entire series on its fledgling CITV channel, a digital service available on cable, satellite and the Freeview service. ITV4, another digital channel, also ran repeats of &quot;UFO&quot; and &quot;Space: 1999&quot; up until the end of 2009.

In March 2011, Anderson was working with Daniel Pickering and Annix Studios on a new project named &quot;Christmas Miracle&quot;, a children&#x27;s CGI animated feature.

==Death==
In June 2012 it was reported that Anderson had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Anderson died in his sleep on 26 December 2012, at the age of 83. The news was announced on his son Jamie&#x27;s website, who wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m very sad to announce the death of my father, Thunderbirds creator, Gerry Anderson. He died peacefully in his sleep at midday today (26th December 2012), having suffered with mixed dementia for the past few years. He was 83.&quot;

Voice actor Matt Zimmerman, who voiced Alan Tracy and supporting characters in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. spoke to BBC News about Anderson&#x27;s death praising his work saying &quot;it&#x27;s a big part of people&#x27;s lives&quot; saying also that &quot;people speak of the shows with such affection, and I held Gerry with that kind of affection as well. I am very pleased to have known him and I feel very sorry for Jamie and his wife Mary.&quot; David Graham who voiced Gordon Tracy, Parker, Brains and Kyrano said it was &quot;a very sad day&quot;.

Tributes from across the world of television and radio poured in, among them TV presenter Jonathan Ross, DJ Chris Evans, comedian Eddie Izzard and actors Brian Blessed and John Barrowman. Ross tweeted &quot;For men of my age his work made childhood an incredible place to be.&quot; Blessed, who worked with Anderson on &quot;Space 1999&quot; and &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; said, &quot;I think a light has gone out in the universe. He had a great sense of humour. He wasn&#x27;t childish but child-like and he had a tremendous love of the universe and astronomy and scientists.&quot;

Fanderson chairman Nick Williams paid tribute to Anderson by saying &quot;To those who met him Gerry was a quiet, unassuming but determined man. His desire to make the best films he could drove him and his talented teams to innovate, take risks, and do everything necessary to produce quite inspirational works. Gerry&#x27;s legacy is that he inspired so many people and continues to bring so much joy to so many millions of people around the world.&quot;

The Humanist funeral was announced for Friday 11 January 2013 at Reading crematorium. His son Jamie went on to say that his father expressed his desire to let fans of the shows attend his funeral, alongside friends, family and cast members. Jamie also spoke about the number of messages sent by fans, saying, &quot;We have been so touched by the outpouring of sympathy from all over the world. We have had messages from India, Uganda, Australia – and from people aged between seven to 70. It is so nice to know how my father touched people&#x27;s lives across all the continents.&quot; Jamie went on to add, &quot;But I&#x27;m proudest of him for the contribution he made to the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society. He was so torn apart by his illness. But his involvement with the charity raised £1 million in just a year.&quot;

Anderson was cremated, following a ceremony that brought together hundreds of colleagues, family and fans. Anderson&#x27;s coffin was decorated with a floral Thunderbird 2 as his body was taken into the service, where musical scores of the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; theme tune and &quot;Aqua Marina&quot; from &quot;Stingray&quot; were played. Amongst the hundreds in attendance was car owner Melvin Jarvis, who drove to the service in a full-scale replica of Lady Penelope&#x27;s Rolls-Royce FAB1. Also in attendance was Shane Rimmer, who voiced Scott Tracy in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;; he spoke about his time on the show, saying, &quot;It was a truly unique experience. Gerry&#x27;s office was like the Oval Office at The White House at times, such was the mystique of the place. &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; really broke a mould as it was one of the first TV shows that had appeal on both sides of the Atlantic.&quot;

The first episode of &quot;Strange Hill High&quot;, &quot;King Mitchell&quot;, was dedicated to his memory.

===Legacy===
On 25 March 2013, in an announcement on the official Gerry Anderson website, Anderson&#x27;s younger son Jamie announced that a number of projects that Anderson had been unable to finish during his lifetime were being developed by his company Anderson Entertainment and would be financed primarily through Kickstarter crowdfunding. On 27 July 2013 the name of the first Gerry Anderson legacy project was announced on the official Gerry Anderson website as a trilogy of novels entitled &quot;Gemini Force One&quot;. The first novel, &quot;Black Orchid&quot;, was published in 2014. In 2019 a pilot episode for a new puppet-based science fiction series based upon concepts developed by Anderson, &quot;Firestorm&quot;, was released on YouTube by Anderson Entertainment. It uses a combination of hand- and electronically controlled puppets and green screen effects in an updated form of Supermarionation dubbed &quot;Ultramarionation&quot;. Production of a full-length series was scheduled to begin in 2019.

<doc id="166836" wikidata="Q387736" url="?curid=166836" title="River Don, Aberdeenshire">
<text>The River Don () is a river in north-east Scotland. It rises in the Grampians and flows eastwards, through Aberdeenshire, to the North Sea at Aberdeen. The Don passes through Alford, Kemnay, Inverurie, Kintore, and Dyce. Its main tributary, the River Ury, joins at Inverurie.

==Course of the river==
The Don rises in the peat flat beneath &quot;Druim na Feithe&quot;, and in the shadow of Glen Avon, before flowing quietly past the ice-age moraine and down to Cock Bridge, below the picturesque site of the recently demolished Delnadamph Lodge. Several streams, the Dhiver, Feith Bhait, Meoir Veannaich, Cock Burn and the Allt nan Aighean merge to form the embryonic Don. Water from the north of Brown Cow Hill () drains into the Don, while water from the west side runs into the River Spey and that from the south side into the Dee. The Don follows a circuitous route eastwards past Corgarff Castle, through Strathdon and the Howe of Alford before entering the North Sea just north of Old Aberdeen.

The chief tributaries are Conrie Water, Ernan Water, Water of Carvie, Water of Nochty, Deskry Water, Water of Buchat, Kindy Burn, Bucks Burn, Mossat Burn, Leochel Burn and the River Ury.

==History==
The river was recorded by the 2nd century AD cosmographer Ptolemy of Alexandria (d. &quot;c&quot; 168) as Δηουανα &quot;Devona&quot;, meaning &#x27;goddess&#x27;, an indication the river was once a sacred one. Near Kintore, not distant from the Don, is the Deers Den Roman Camp. In 1750 the Don&#x27;s lower reaches were channelled towards the sea, moving its confluence with the sea northwards.

==Hydrology==

River levels and flows have been measured along the course of the Don at a number of gauging stations since 1969. The lowest of these is the gauge at Parkhill near Dyce, with a mean flow of . The station measures 97% of the total catchment of the river.

Prior to 2016 the maximum levels and flows were recorded during the floods of November 2002, with peak levels on the 22nd of that month reaching at Haughton near Inverurie, and at Parkhill. These were exceeded in January 2016 during the 2015–16 floods, when levels at Haughton reached , whilst those at Parkhill were over a metre higher than previously at . The resultant flooding forced residents along the river to evacuate their homes, in some cases with the help of local rescue teams. Areas affected included Port Elphinstone, Kintore, and Donside in Aberdeen where a number of residential care homes were evacuated as a precaution.

==Economy==
Strathdon attracts visitors for salmon and trout fishing as well as its castles and scenery. A 100kW hydro scheme at Tillydrone is on the former site of the Donside Papermill.

<doc id="166837" wikidata="Q1570197" url="?curid=166837" title="River Don, Yorkshire">
<text>The River Don (also called River Dun in some stretches) is a river in South Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It rises in the Pennines, west of Dunford Bridge, and flows for eastwards, through the Don Valley, via Penistone, Sheffield, Rotherham, Mexborough, Conisbrough, Doncaster and Stainforth. It originally joined the Trent, but was re-engineered by Cornelius Vermuyden as the Dutch River in the 1620s, and now joins the River Ouse at Goole. Don Valley is a UK parliamentary constituency near the Doncaster stretch of the river.

==Etymology==
The probable origin of the name was Brittonic &quot;Dānā&quot;, from a root &quot;dān-&quot;, meaning &quot;water&quot; or &quot;river&quot;. The name Dôn (or Danu), a Celtic mother goddess, has the same origin.

The river gave its name to the Don River, one of the principal rivers of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

==Geography==
The Don can be divided into sections by the different types of structures built to restrict its passage. The upper reaches, and those of several of its tributaries, are defined by dams built to provide a public water supply. The middle section contains many weirs, which were built to supply mills, foundries and factories with water power, while the lower section contains weirs and locks, designed to maintain water levels for navigation.
The Don&#x27;s major tributaries are the Loxley, the Rivelin, the Sheaf, the Rother and the Dearne.

Along the Sheffield–Rotherham stretch of the river are five weirs that punctuate a local walking and cycling route, the Five Weirs Walk. A further walk, the Upper Don Walk, is being developed that will make it possible to walk or cycle from Sheffield city centre up to Oughtibridge.

==History==
Below Doncaster, the main channel of the lower Don originally meandered in a north-easterly direction across the marshland of Hatfield Chase to enter the Trent just above its junction with the Ouse. A second channel flowed to the north, along a Roman channel called Turnbridgedike. The eastern channel formed the boundary between Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.

In the Hatfield Level drainage project which started in 1626, the Dutch civil engineer Cornelius Vermuyden diverted the Don northwards along Turnbridgedike. He constructed Dikesmarsh bank some distance to the east of the channel, so that the intervening land could be used as washlands. The main work was completed by 1628, but after flooding in 1629, a &quot;Great Sluice&quot; was constructed at the junction between the river and the Aire, with 17 openings which were , probably by Hugo Spiering, who had assisted Vermuyden on the main project. The washlands had insufficient capacity, and in 1632 work started on a new channel, which would run for from Newbridge, near Thorne, eastwards to enter the Ouse at the site of Goole, upstream of the Trent. Water levels here were between lower than at Turnbridge. This new channel was called the &quot;Dutch River&quot;, and was finished in 1635, at a cost of £33,000. It ended in a sluice at Goole, and was never intended to be navigable, as boats could access the Aire at Turnbridge. The sluice was later swept away in a flood and never replaced.

The Dutch River was difficult to navigate, made more hazardous by shoals, three awkward bridges, and low water levels at neap tides. With the opening of the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in 1802, from the Don at Stainforth to the Trent at Keadby, most traffic for the Trent used that in preference to the Dutch River and the route around Trent Falls, where the Trent joins the Humber. Construction of a railway from Doncaster to Goole in 1869 reduced traffic on the river, but the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company was formed in 1889, to buy back the River Don Navigation, the Sheffield Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal from railway ownership, to keep them competitive. They acquired the waterways in 1895, but failed to raise sufficient capital for the major improvements they had planned. However, they succeeded in constructing the New Junction Canal from Stainforth to the Aire and Calder Navigation (Knottingley and Goole Canal) west of Goole, which was jointly funded by the Aire and Calder, and opened in 1905. The Dutch River reverted almost entirely to its original drainage function, and Stainforth lock, which connected it to the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, was closed in 1939.

===Navigation===

Navigation to Sheffield was made possible by the construction of weirs, locks and canal cuttings to avoid circuitous and unnavigable sections of the Don downstream of Tinsley, and then by a canal from Tinsley to Sheffield. The first serious attempts at improvements were authorised by an act of Parliament, the River Dun Navigation Act 1725 (12 Geo. 1. c. 38) obtained in 1726 by Sheffield&#x27;s Company of Cutlers to make the river navigable from Holmstile in Doncaster to Tinsley, on the edge of Sheffield, and another obtained by the Corporation of Doncaster in 1727 to improve the river below Holmstile, as far as Wilsick House in Barnby Dun. An act of Parliament of 1733, the River Dun Navigation Act 1732 (6 Geo. 2. c. 9), created &quot;The Company of the Proprietors of the Navigation of the River Don&quot;, and authorised further cuts above Rotherham, while a further bill of 1740 sought powers to improve the river from Barnby Dun to Fishlake Ferry, to avoid the shallows at Stainforth and Bramwith. The river was navigable to Rotherham in 1740, and to Tinsley by 1751.

Stainforth was connected to the River Trent by the opening on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in 1802 and to the Aire and Calder Navigation by the New Junction Canal, opened in 1905. There were plans to use compartment boats to carry coal on the navigation, but although some locks were lengthened around 1910, Long Sandall lock was not, and it was not until 1959 that it was extended to and trains of 17 compartment boats could work through to Doncaster. The navigation was the subject of one of the last major attempts in the UK to attract commercial freight to the waterways. In 1983, it was upgraded to the 700-tonne Eurobarge standard by deepening the channels and enlarging the locks as far as Rotherham. The expected rise in freight traffic did not occur, however.

The cuts and navigable river sections, with the Stainforth and Keadby and the New Junction canals constitute the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation. Locks on the Bramwith to Rotherham section can accommodate boats which are , but above that, boats are restricted to by the short Rotherham lock.

===Flooding===
On the night of 26 October 1536, a sudden rise in the level of the River Don prevented the forces of the Pilgrimage of Grace from crossing the river at Doncaster, forcing them to enter into negotiations with Henry VIII&#x27;s forces. The Great Sheffield Flood, which occurred on 11 March 1864 following the collapse of the Dale Dike Dam on a tributary of the River Loxley, destroyed 800 houses, destroyed or damaged most of the Don bridges upstream of Lady&#x27;s Bridge (see &quot;Bridges over River Don&quot; section below) and killed 270 people.

The Don was also one of the rivers that flooded during the 2007 United Kingdom floods. Following high levels of rainfall, some 80 million cubic metres of rain fell on South Yorkshire on 25 June 2007. The river burst its banks in the late afternoon, flooding areas of Sheffield from Hillsborough to Meadowhall, and two people died after being swept away by the water. Parts of Rotherham and Doncaster were flooded for the second time in 10 days. Two days later, the army were called in to assist at Barnby Dun after the river flooded large areas near Thorpe Marsh Power Station.

The Don also burst its banks in November 2019, flooding villages along its course, notably Fishlake.

===Catchment===
The River Don catchment was the subject of extensive research investigations in the early 2000s, led primarily by the Catchment Science Centre, based at the University of Sheffield. A comprehensive summary of the river catchment was completed in 2008, describing the key social, economic and environmental characteristics of this historically important urban river and its main tributaries.

==Hydrology==
The River Don, together with its main tributaries, the River Rother and the River Dearne, form a river system with a catchment of , which held a population of around 1.4 million in 1997. Much of the region is underlain by Carboniferous age Coal Measures rocks, and pollution of the river system has arisen where the coal has been mined. The headwaters rise on the moorlands of the Pennines, where the rocks are largely Millstone Grit, while the lower reaches pass through areas of alluvial and glacial material, up to thick, which overlies Magnesian Limestone strata and rocks assigned to the Sherwood Sandstone Group.

The impacts of human habitation, particularly the inadequate treatment of sewage effluent, and the growth of mining in the upper reaches and the processing of metals in the Sheffield area have resulted in serious pollution of the river, and the depletion of fish stocks, to the extent that large parts of the Don contained no fish until the mid-1980s. Concerted efforts have been made to improve the water quality, by reducing the concentration of metals, the ammonia content, and the biological oxygen demand (BOD), which is a measure of the amount of oxygen that is needed by organisms to break down organic matter in the water. Sewage treatment works on the Don, notably those at Cheesebottom, on the west bank of the river at Thurgoland and Blackburn Meadows at Tinsley, have been upgraded, as has that at Darton on the River Dearne. This has led to a great improvement in ammonia levels and BOD, further aided by the construction of biological treatment facilities for the processing of industrial effluent in the Doncaster area, while the decline in the steel industry in Sheffield has reduced the discharge of metals into the river.

Mining presents a different problem, as the mines have been abandoned, but the pollution continues. Near Penistone, ochre discharged into the river from old ganister mine workings, giving it an orange colour for about six miles, eventually remedied, while at Beeley Wood, the ochre comes from a pile of waste metal on the river bank. A nearby paper mill has also been a significant polluter of the river. Some of the problem has been mitigated by the construction of lagoons, into which mine discharges have been diverted. Water quality on the Dearne and the Rother has not improved as much as on the Don, and pollution of the lower reaches is compounded by the fact that the pollutants, which include dioxins, are locked up in the river bed sediments. Despite the steady improvement in water quality, restocking of the river with fish, attempted on several occasions between 1981 and 1994, was largely ineffective, caused by intermittent discharges of pollutants. In November 2011, the Environment Agency announced that they had recently re-stocked the Don with 1,000 barbel. A spokesman said that the fish in the river were now at a sustainable level with a breeding population and these would be the last fish added as part of a 10-year programme to help the Don recover from an industrial heritage that had depleted fish stocks.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Don was as follows in 2019.

Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

==Settlements on the River Don==
These are the settlements on the River Don from the source to the mouth. The largest city on the river is Sheffield. Settlements with a population of over 10,000 according to the 2001 census are shown in bold. The river&#x27;s source, tributaries and mouth are in &quot;italics&quot;.

==Course==

The River Don rises in the Peak District, on Great Grains Moss, a millstone grit moorland area between above sea level. A series of small streams, including Great Grains and Black Grough join up, and within enter Winscar Reservoir. Reaps Dyke rises within of the source, and flows in a semicircle to the north, through Snailsden reservoir and Harden reservoir, to flow into another arm of Winscar reservoir. Just from the source, Withens Brook rises, but flows westwards, to supply the reservoirs of Longdendale and the people of Manchester. To the south of Winscar reservoir, other streams supply Upper Windleden and Lower Windleden reservoirs.

All of these reservoirs were built in the late 19th century for the Dewsbury and Heckmondwike
Waterworks Board. Lower Windleden was the first to be completed in 1872, with Upper Windleden following in 1890. Winscar, Snailsden and Harden were all completed in 1899, although Winscar was called Dunford Bridge at the time. A new dam was built at Winscar between 1972 and 1975, and replaced the earlier earth dam. To fit it in, without destroying the village of Dunford Bridge, the dam is built of rock fill, which allows the faces to be much steeper than those of an earth dam, and the inner face is covered with two layers of asphaltic concrete, the first such use of this material on a dam in Britain. The dam is high and contains around of rock fill. Another innovation in its construction was the use of a hydraulic jump pool at the foot of the overflow chute, which dissipates the energy of the cascading water. The reservoir supplies drinking water to the Calder Valley, some to the north, and is also the base for Pennine Sailing Club, who offer basic training in sailing skills, on courses certified by the Royal Yachting Association.

The Don flows from the foot of Winscar Dam, close to the eastern portal of the Woodhead Tunnel, through the Hamlet of Dunford Bridge, and continues, first east and then south-east, on its way to Sheffield. Near Penistone, the river is joined by Scout Dike, which flows from the Ingbirchworth, Royd Moor and Scout Dike reservoirs. The Little Don River or River Porter, on which there are three more reservoirs, joins the Don near Deepcar, while at Wharncliffe Side, the Ewden Beck joins, after flowing through Broomhead and More Hall reservoirs. By the time it reaches Oughtibridge, the river is below the contour.

===Industrial sites===

Below Oughtibridge, the course of the river is marked by a series of weirs, which were used to impound water, so that it could be used to power mills, hammers and grinding wheels. The gradient of the river bed is less than that of most of the Don&#x27;s tributaries, which required the weirs to be spaced further apart, to prevent water from one mill backing up and preventing the next mill upstream from operating. The river falls by between Oughtibridge and Brightside, a distance of , and by 1600, there were sufficient weirs that no new ones were built subsequently, although there were cases where additional mills were built, which used water from an existing weir. Most of the mill buildings have long since gone, but the weirs remain. All of the weirs on this section of the Don followed a similar pattern, with a weir built at an angle across the river, and a goit or channel leading from the lower edge to a reservoir or dam running parallel to the river. After the works, a tail goit returned water to the river. Water supply to the dam was controlled by shuttles which could be raised to allow water to enter the head goit.

The weir by Station Lane, Oughtibridge served the Upper Middlewood forge, described as a tilt in the sources, as it had a tilt hammer which was raised up and allowed to drop to shape the metal. The weir is in good order, although much of the original structure has been replaced by concrete steps. Next came Middlewood Works, which was a rolling mill and slitting mill, splitting bars of iron into thin strips for the manufacture of nails. Four water wheels were recorded in the 1820s, and water power was still being uses in 1900. The site was cleared after 1985, but the stone weir, with its nine bays, remains. Beeley Wood or Nova Scotia Tilts was a sizeable operation, with eight water wheels operating in the 1830s, four wheels driving two forges, another two driving the bellows for the forges, and the final two driving two tilt hammers. The works was recorded as derelict by 1895. In February 2016 the Environment Agency removed the middle two-thirds of Beeley Wood Lower Weir as part of a scheme to allow the free migration of fish and let the river return to a more natural form. The next works was Hawksley or Clay Wheels which employed 54 men in 1794, and was still using water power in 1895. The site was used to make scythes until after 1941, when a film, which can be seen at the Kelham Island Museum, was made of its activity. The weir has five bays, but is deteriorating.

Wadsley weir supplied a series of works which were situated to the east of the river channel. Wadsley Bridge paper mill was operational by 1709, and a tilt was also working by 1806. The wheel was in diameter and wide when it was surveyed in 1855, by which time the works had become Niagara Works. It was recorded as a forge which was still using water power in 1907. The weir remains, together with the shuttles which controlled the flow into the head goit, although the channel itself has been built over. Wadsley Bridge corn mill, which became a forge around 1800, originally took its water supply from the head goit of the paper mill, but was later connected to the tail goit. Wadsley Furnace was also located in this area. It was built for the Earl of Shrewsbury by 1583, but the blast furnace is thought to have been defunct by the 1670s. The final works in this section was Wadsley Forge or Wardsend Steel Works, which was operational from 1581 to the late 19th century, although the precise function varied. In 1819, there were two wheels supplying power to 69 troughs, where blades were ground. By 1849, it was described as a forge, and a high pressure steam engine was operational in 1855, to supplement the water wheel. The dams were out of use by 1892, and parts of the site are now occupied by Hillsborough Football Stadium.

Near the tail goit of the Wadsley works, the Don was joined by a small tributary, on which was located Rawsons Mill or Bark Mill. The mill building was separated from its dam by the building of the railway. The mill housed grinding wheels in 1862, but was used for milling corn in 1934. The dam remains full, overflowing through a culvert which passes beneath the railway. Owlerton Rolling Mill was next, located on the west bank, but was destroyed by fire around 1883. It had been reconstructed by 1907, when steam power assisted the water wheels, and was demolished in 1936. Only a small part of the weir remains. The next weir supplied Old Park corn mill, which was built around 1673. In 1807 a lease was issued to a group of 32 tenants, which included a miller, grinders, cutlers, a button maker, a scissorsmith and an ivory turner. In the early 20th century, it was known as Old Park Forge, and so had presumably changed its use. Old Park paper, silver or rolling mill followed. In 1795 it had a undershot wheel for rolling copper plates, and another of for rolling silver. The River Loxley joins the Don opposite the mill site, and the building was badly damaged by the great flood of 1864. The tenant claimed £1,932 in compensation, and received £1,720. A steam engine replaced the large water wheel in 1875, and the rest of the works was electrified in 1920. Sheffield Steel Rolling Co. continued to work the site until 1980.

Sandbed wheel was built in 1723, and by 1794, there were three water wheels supplying 52 grinding troughs. A steam engine was supplementing the wheels by 1886, but the wheels remained in use until at least 1907. The weir and the shuttles controlling the flow in the head goit remain. Below this, Morton wheels are known to have existed in 1581. The works became the Philadelphia Works around 1807, and a claim for £6,204 was made and received for damage caused by the 1864 flood. Next came Kelham Wheel, which was used as a cutlers wheel, a silk mill, and a cotton mill. Following fires in 1792 and 1810, the mill was rebuilt to use steam power, and became the Britannia Corn Mills after 1864. The buildings were demolished in 1975, but the weir remains in good order, and is one of the largest in Sheffield. Below this were the Town Corn Mill and wheel, which was water powered until 1877, and was the subject of an archaeological investigation in 1999, which uncovered the remains of the wheel pits.

Wicker Tilts and wheel was really two works, a grinding wheel known to have been working in 1581, and a tilt forge built in the 1740s. A second tilt was added near Lady&#x27;s Bridge by 1752. The grinding wheel, which supplied 36 troughs, was replaced by a wire mill in the 1870s, and was still using water power in 1895, by which time the tilts were using steam power. The weir was close to Lady&#x27;s Bridge, and the head goit flowed through one of the arches of the bridge. It is thought that there are several goits in culverts near Blonk Street, but their exact extent is unknown. The culverted Porter Brook joins the River Sheaf, which is also culverted, below Sheffield Railway Station, and the combined flows join the Don between Lady&#x27;s Bridge and Blonk Street bridge.

===Five Weirs Walk===
The section of the river from Lady&#x27;s Bridge to Meadowhall and the junction of the river with the Sheffield Canal has been designated as the Five Weirs Walk, by the creation of a footpath which closely follows its course. It contains the final five weirs before the navigable section is reached.

Walk Mill weir supplied the Upper and Nether Walk mills and wheels. The Nether Walk mill is thought to have been the site of a fulling mill mentioned in 1332, and was still operating as a fulling mill in 1760, when there were also two cutlers wheels at the lower site and one at the upper. The use of water wheels ceased in 1853, and both sites were recorded as the Albion Iron and Steel Works in 1864. Burton Weir supplied Royds mill and wheels, which also operated on two sites, and included a corn mill and cutlers wheels. Steam power was used from 1860, although a redundant water wheel remained in situ until 1950.

Sanderson&#x27;s weir provided water for the Upper Hammer, on the south side of the river, which was converted into the Attercliffe slitting mill in 1746. By 1802 it was described as being in a decayed state, and the dam and goit were filled in by 1818. The weir also supplied the Nether Hammer on the north side of the river, which was first recorded in the 1580s. The forge was sold in 1869, one part to the Midland Railway, and the other to Sandersons, who had six water wheels in 1895, but the works was running on steam power by 1907. In addition to the weir, the head goit is still visible, passing under the railway twice, to disappear into a culverted drain.

Brightside weir supplied a corn mill from before 1383 until 1690. Two cutlers wheels were added in 1706, and the works had become a forge by 1789. Four wheels were recorded in 1895, and a set of tilt hammers from the site were rescued and moved to Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet. Hadfields Weir is the final weir on this stretch, which supplied Parker Wheel initially, and then a paper mill from the 1750s. At various times there were two flour mills, two forges and then a rolling mill. The precise location of the works is difficult to trace, as the river has been straightened below the weir, but the weir itself can be seen from Meadowhall Shopping Centre.

==Bridges==
This section provides details of some of the many bridges crossing the River Don, in west-to-east (river source to river mouth) order.

===Bridges in Upper Don area===
This area stretches from the source of the River Don down to and including Oughtibridge. There are many minor crossings of the Don in this area, so only a selection of bridges is covered in this section.

====Dunford Bridge====
The road bridge at the small hamlet of Dunford Bridge carries the unclassified Windle Edge Road across the River Don. The source of the Don is about to the west and the retaining dam of Winscar Reservoir is to the west. The road bridge is below the surface level of the water in the reservoir.

====Thurlstone Leapings Lane footbridge====
One of many footpath crossings of the Don in the upper part of its course. This path links the A628 (near St Saviour&#x27;s Church) with Leapings Lane. There is a ford by the side of the footbridge and this can be easily crossed by road vehicles for most of the year.

====Penistone Viaduct====
This is a curving 29-arch viaduct which is long and high where it crosses the River Don. It is used by passenger services on the route from Sheffield to Huddersfield (&quot;The Penistone Line&quot;). It was built in 1850 by Sir John Fowler for the Huddersfield &amp; Sheffield Junction Railway (later the Great Central Railway). The viaduct suffered a partial collapse in 1916. The viaduct crosses the B6462 Thurgoland to Penistone road as well as the River Don.

====Oxspring Viaduct====
This is a seven-arch viaduct, built around 1855, which crosses the B6462 Thurgoland to Penistone road as well as the River Don. The railway that it conveys started off as a local colliery line of the South Yorkshire Railway Company and later became part of a trunk freight route which reached its traffic peak in the early 1950s. From 1983 the line has been used for local passenger services between Sheffield and Huddersfield via Barnsley.

====Oxspring Willow Footbridge====
Built about 1734, this narrow stone bridge conveyed the packhorse trail from Leeds to Cheshire. It now forms part of the Trans Pennine Trail. It is listed Grade II by English Heritage.

====Romtickle Viaduct====
This substantial viaduct conveys the long-distance Trans Pennine Trail across the River Don and its valley which is narrow at this point. The name of the viaduct varies. Barnsley Council sign-boards call this Romticle Viaduct, local newspapers call it Rumtickle Viaduct and 1940s LNER plans call it Romptickle Viaduct. Built in 1844 from local stone, it formed part of the Sheffield to Manchester Railway which opened in 1845. Trains ceased on this section of the line in May 1983.

====Wortley Footbridge====
This footbridge is on the Barnsley Boundary Walk, upstream of Tin Mill Dam. It provides a drier alternative to the adjacent set of stepping stones when the river level is high. The bridge has an above-deck truss design and is constructed largely of tubular steel. It was manufactured by Tubewrights Ltd of Newport (Monmouthshire). This was a company that specialised in the fabrication of tubular steel structures. It had other factories in London, Liverpool and Glasgow and was in business from 1899 until 1981. In 1961, the company employed 1,200 people. This pre-fabricated design of footbridge was popular in the years immediately after World War II and examples can be found all over Britain.

====Oughtibridge Station Lane Bridge====
Station Lane bridge carries the unclassified road from Oughtibridge to Grenoside over the River Don. The station referred to is the &quot;Oughty Bridge Station&quot; (east of the road bridge) on the former Great Central Railway Company&#x27;s Sheffield to Manchester route. It opened in 1845 and closed to passengers in 1959.
Like most of the upper Don, the river at Oughtibridge appears fairly benign, with it having a small flow and being easily fordable below the weir to the south of the bridge. However, as discussed in the Flooding section above, its wide catchment area and the sometimes-extreme weather in the Pennines makes the river susceptible to occasional flooding. The two photographs illustrate the contrast.

===Bridges in Hillsborough area===

====Rocher Bridge====
This footbridge over the River Don is the only crossing in the 4 km between Station Lane Bridge in Oughtibridge and Leppings Lane, Hillsborough. It was originally erected to allow workmen across the river to work in the ganister mines of Beeley Wood and the factories in the Clay Wheels Lane area of Sheffield. This is another benign-looking stretch of the upper Don. However, during the 2007 floods, the retaining wall of the A6102 Middlewood Road North was washed away just north of Rocher Bridge. It was over a year before the damage could be repaired and the road re-opened.

====Leppings Lane bridge====
This carries the A6102 over the River Don. Leppings Lane was originally Leapings Lane which got its name from some nearby stepping stones over the river.

====Hillsborough Stadium footbridge====
 This footbridge connects Parkside Road with the main entrance to the football stadium. The bridge was built as part of the major £7 million re-development for the Euro 1996 international competition. As regards the stadium itself, the first match played was on 2 September 1899 and in 1966 the stadium was selected as one of the venues for the Football World Cup. Very close to the footbridge is a memorial to the 97 fans that lost their lives at Hillsborough in 1989, during the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. In June 2007, the River Don burst its banks during a period of severe weather in the area and the whole ground was flooded with several feet of water. As part of the abortive plans for England staging the 2018 World Cup, a new bridge had been planned across the River Don for entry to the West Stand and would have been slightly upstream of the main entrance footbridge.

====Penistone Road North bridge====
This carries the A61 dual carriageway across the River Don. This part of the A61, which fronts the football ground, was widened in time for the 1966 World Cup matches and still features the flagpoles for the event.

====Cadbury&#x27;s works bridges====
 There are two private bridges that connect the Cadbury&#x27;s works on either side of the Don. There is a public footpath along the northern bank of the Don which goes under the two bridges. The footpath will eventually form part of the Upper Don Walk The Cadbury&#x27;s, previously Bassett&#x27;s, works is one of the major employers in the area. The George Bassett &amp; Co. Ltd sweet factory is one of the longest serving of local firms, known for its manufacture of Liquorice Allsorts. The firm was established in Sheffield in 1842 but did not come to Owlerton until 1934 when Bassett&#x27;s son-in-law, Samuel Meggit Johnson, built a large factory on Beulah Road on the south side of the Don. The factory was enlarged in the inter-war period as new products, such as Jelly Babies, Wine Gums and Liquorice Novelties, were added to the range. 
In 1989 Bassetts was purchased by the Cadbury Schweppes group and became part of its confectionery subsidiary Cadbury Trebor Bassett. In 2010, Cadbury&#x27;s was taken over by Kraft.

====Wardsend Bridge====
This bridge in Hillsborough carries Livesey Street over the Don to Club Mill Road. The previous bridge was a two-arched stone bridge, built in the 18th century to provide access to Wardsend Cemetery, and was destroyed by the floods on 25 June 2007. It was rebuilt as a single-span integral bridge at an estimated cost of £673,000 and re-opened in early 2009.

===Bridges in Sheffield area===

====Hillfoot Bridge====
 This bridge carries Neepsend Lane (B6074) over the River Don. On 11 March 1864, the previous wooden bridge was swept away by the Great Sheffield Flood, caused by the collapse of Dale Dike Dam. The bridge was replaced by a three-arched stone structure in 1885. Alterations made in 1912 included rounded approaches, and lighting was provided by cast-iron gas lamps, contributed by the Neepsend Gasworks, which was located nearby.

====Rutland Road Bridge====
 This bridge carries Rutland Road (B6070) over the River Don. In the 1800s, this bridge was commonly known as Neepsend Bridge. In the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864, the Neepsend bridge managed to withstand the onslaught although a large amount of debris was piled up against it. The three elliptical arches were built in 1854, although the parapet is slightly later, as it had to be rebuilt following damage sustained during the flood.

====Ball Street Bridge====
 This road bridge carries Ball Street over the River Don. The original footbridge at this point was destroyed in the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864. Samuel Harrison writes: &quot;The Ball Street foot bridge, adjoining Mr. Mills&#x27;s tannery, was destroyed. Although it was constructed of iron, it was torn down by the force of the water, and bent about as though it were only a piece of pasteboard. A large portion of it might be seen long afterwards lying in the river in a sloping position, and not entirely disconnected from its original position at one end.&quot; It was rebuilt in 1865, with three cast-iron spans which were manufactured at the Milton Iron Works in Elsecar. It features pierced Gothic parapets. The spans are carried on stone piers, and the bridge was widened in 1900. Kelham Weir (also known as Ball Street Weir) is just downstream of the bridge.

====Borough Bridge====

Borough bridge and Corporation Street, which crosses it, were laid out as part of the same development, and named to celebrate the incorporation of Sheffield as a borough. Samual Worth and Samual Furness Holmes were responsible for its design, and the foundation stone carries the date 12 March 1853. The bridge is built of stone, has three segmental arches, and was completed in 1856. It is a grade II listed structure. During the Great Flood, large quantities of debris built up behind it, and then caused the iron bridge below it to be swept away. Corporation Street is now part of the A61, and the bridge forms the west side of the inner relief road roundabout.

====Iron Footbridge====
The iron footbridge in the middle of the roundabout on the A61 inner ring road was first built as a wooden bridge around 1726. It was important, as it enabled people to reach an old road which ran to Leeds and Barnsley, passing through Pitsmoor. In 1795 it was replaced by one of the earliest iron bridges, made by Samual Walker, an ironmaster from Rotherham and was depicted by an unknown artist, circa 1840. The famous iron bridge at Coalbrookdale had been built only 15 years earlier, and there were only 7 or 8 other iron bridges in the world. It was swept away in 1864, and replaced by a new iron bridge, built at the Milton Ironworks near Elsecar. It was partially rebuilt in 1921, and the iron balustrade is marked &quot;J Butler &amp; Co Ltd, Stanningley Ironworks, Leeds 1921&quot;. Its function was replaced by Borough bridge when Sheffield Rolling Mills and Forge built over the path which ran from it to Millsands and Bridge Street, but it remains in place because it also carries a large water main over the river. This bridge has recently been adopted by a &#x27;Friends Group&#x27; and has received a substantial &#x27;make-over&#x27;. Various &#x27;street art&#x27; installations enhance its historical interest.

====A61 Roundabout east side bridge====
This road bridge carries the A61 inner relief road over the river. It was built as part of a £65 million scheme to divert traffic away from the city centre, which included of dual carriageway running from Penistone Road to the Wicker. The road was opened on 22 November 2007 by Rosie Winterton MP.
====Nursery Street Footbridge====
This footbridge connects the re-development of the former Exchange Brewery site on the west side of the River Don with Nursery Street on the east. The bridge was built around 2005.

====Lady&#x27;s Bridge====
 This bridge carries the A6135 over the River Don and connects Sheffield city centre with The Wicker. Lady&#x27;s Bridge is the oldest bridge crossing the Don within Sheffield, its five arches being constructed in 1485. It was widened on the south-east side in the late 19th century, was restored in the late 20th century, and is a Grade II listed structure. Wicker Weir is just upstream of Lady&#x27;s Bridge.

====Blonk Street Bridge====
The culverted River Sheaf joins the Don beside Blonk Street bridge, named after Benjamin Blonk, who was the tenant of Castle Orchards Wheel from the 1750s to the 1770s. The three-arched bridge was built by Woodhead and Hurst between 1827 and 1828. It was altered in 1913 and has cast iron balustrades.

====Willey Street footbridge====
To link The Wicker with Furnival Road, a new steel footbridge was erected on 14 July 2010. The bridge was funded by the Environment Agency, Yorkshire Forward and the European Regional Development Fund as part of a multimillion-pound scheme to regenerate The Wicker and surrounding area. Original plans were for a bridge crossing the river at an angle, but the more direct route was eventually adopted. It is part of some flood defence improvements, and includes a trap for floating debris beneath it. The design is based on butterfly wings, and the project also included a new link to the Five Weirs Walk and the installation of footway lighting.

====Derek Dooley Way Bridge====
This bridge takes the Sheffield Inner Ring Road over the River Don. This part of the ring road was finished in 2000 as Cutlers Gate and was subsequently renamed in 2008 as Derek Dooley Way, in honour of the late Sheffielder who played football for Sheffield Wednesday before breaking his leg and going on to perform various backroom roles across the city at Sheffield United. The Derek Dooley Way named section of the ring road runs from the Parkway to the Wicker.

====Wicker Viaduct====
 The Wicker Arches are a railway viaduct, designed by the architects Weightman, Hadfield and Goldie to a specification by the engineer Sir John Fowler in 1848. They were built by Miller, Blackie and Shortedge, and carried the Great Central Railway to Manchester across the canal, roads and the River Don at The Wicker. The 27 southern arches are wider than the 12 to the north of the Wicker, as Sheffield Victoria railway station was built on them. The arch that takes the railway over the Don has stone abutments and a lattice girder span which was made in the late 19th century. The Cobweb Bridge is suspended from this span.

====Cobweb Bridge====
The Cobweb Bridge was completed in 2002. Its design was the solution to the difficult problem of how to pass the Five Weirs Walk, a waymarked cycle path and walkway which follows the river from Lady&#x27;s Bridge to Meadowhall, under the massive Wicker Arches Viaduct and at the same time link one bank of the River Don to the other. Without the bridge, the footpath would have had to make a detour. Designed by Sheffield City Council&#x27;s Structures Section, the entire bridge is suspended on a web of steel cables secured to the underside of the viaduct, and it is this feature which gives it its name.

====Bailey Bridge====
 This is part of a section of the Five Weirs Walk that crosses the river from Effingham Road to Attercliffe Road. The bridge here makes use of an historic second world war Bailey bridge. The bridge was placed here on 15 October 2006, was constructed in 1945, was built probably for the D-Day landings and was chosen deliberately to celebrate the world-beating engineering design. The unique features of the invention were that a bridge capable of carrying tanks could be erected in a matter of hours from standard lightweight modules with little more than human muscle power and hand tools.

====Midland Railway Viaduct====
 This viaduct carries the railway from Sheffield to Meadowhall Interchange and the rest of Yorkshire. The railway was opened by the Midland Railway in 1870, at the same time as the current Sheffield Station on Pond Street replaced the Sheffield Wicker railway station. Under the north-most arch of the 4-arch viaduct is suspended a metal walkway, which is part of the Five Weirs Walk.

====Norfolk Bridge====
This 3-arch bridge was built in 1856 and carries Leveson Street (B6071) over the river. It was named after Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk. He was a British Conservative politician and philanthropist. He served as Postmaster General between 1895 and 1900, but is best remembered for his philanthropical work, which concentrated on Roman Catholic causes and the city of Sheffield. In July 1897 he was appointed the first Lord Mayor of Sheffield. He was made an honorary Freeman of the City of Sheffield in 1900. He also donated funds for the building of the University of Sheffield and was its initial Chancellor between 1905 and 1917. Burton Weir is immediately downstream of Norfolk Bridge.

===Bridges in Attercliffe / Brightside area===

====Washford Bridge====
This carries the A6178 Attercliffe Road over the River Don. Washford or Westforth bridge, at the Sheffield end of Attercliffe, was first recorded in a will of 1535. It was rebuilt in wood in 1608 and 1647, then in stone in 1672, 1789 and 1794. In 1940 an air raid badly damaged Washford Bridge and the adjoining pub, The Bridge.

====East Coast Road Bridge====
 This bridge carries East Coast Road over the River Don and connects Brightside Lane with Attercliffe Road. The bridge is of metal construction with a central pier. Sanderson&#x27;s Weir is downstream of this bridge.

====Scrapyard railway bridge====
This bridge carries a railway siding leading to the metal scrap yard on East Coast Road. Currently operated by European Metal Recycling, the scrapyard was previously known as Cooper&#x27;s Metals and Marple &amp; Gillott and is a specialist in dismantling railway vehicles.

====Stevenson Road Bridge====
This bridge carries Stevenson Road over the River Don and connects Brightside Lane with Attercliffe Road. It was named after one of the owners of the Attercliffe Steam Corn Mill. The bridge was strengthened in 2004, so that HGV vehicles could continue to use it.

====Newhall Road Bridge====
 This bridge carries Newhall Road (B6083) over the River Don and connects Brightside Lane with Attercliffe Road. In the 17th century, Newhall Road Bridge was a packhouse bridge in a very rural setting. The road takes its name from &quot;a handsome red-brick house known as Newhall, which stood where in later years Newhall School was built&quot;. The house was inhabited by the Fell family. The Fells were a family of wealthy iron masters, dating from the 17th century. They were known to have gained their wealth and position from the oldest iron works in Sheffield, named the Attercliffe Forge.

====Amberley Street footbridge====
This bridge enables the Five Weirs Walk to cross the River Don. To the west of the bridge, the walk follows the banks of the Don for several miles, while to the east, it goes on a lengthy diversion along roads away from the river to avoid the Sheffield Forgemasters steelworks which occupy the land on both sides of the Don. There is some debate about whether the original wooden Abyssinia Bridge (see section below) crossed the river at the same place as the current Amberley Street footbridge.

====Abyssinia Bridge====
This bridge carries the A6102 Sheffield Outer Ring Road dual carriageway (Hawke Street / Jansen Street) over the River Don. The bridge got its name from the 1868 invasion of Abyssinia by British troops. The first Abyssinia Bridge was built of wood in 1868. It was later replaced by a metal bridge which remained the footpath link between Attercliffe and Brightside until Hawke Street and Jansen Street were joined by a road bridge in 1908. There is some debate about whether the original wooden Abyssinia Bridge crossed the river at the same place as the current Amberley Street footbridge.

====Forgemaster works bridges====
There are three bridges (two road and one pipe) in that section of the Don between Abyssinia Bridge and Brightside Weir which is inaccessible to the public. They are used to connect the Sheffield Forgemasters steelworks which occupy the land on both sides of the Don.

====Weedon Street Bridge====
Also known as Brightside Bridge, this carries Weedon Street, which links Brightside Lane with Attercliffe Common. This bridge is downstream of Brightside Weir. The bridge is mentioned in the records of the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864 as follows: &quot;The watchman on duty near Brightside Bridge had a very narrow escape. When passing the bridge he was startled by a singular sound as though the steam from a distant engine had suddenly been let off, and immediately after the flood came rushing down. The water rose rapidly over the bridge and the road. To escape he mounted the wall, intending to walk along it to some place of safety; but in another moment he felt the wall tremble beneath him. He then jumped off it, and rushed through the waters nearly breast high towards the Midland railway, which he succeeded in reaching, and down which he walked to Sheffield&quot;.

===Bridges in Meadowhall / Tinsley area===

====Sheffield District Railway bridge====
 This single-span metal bridge carried the Sheffield District Railway over the River Don. It was opened in 1900, was integrated into the LNER in 1923 and, in British Rail days, it connected Tinsley Marshalling Yard with the Midland Main Line at Brightside Junction. The railway lines were lifted in 1999, but the bridge was still intact in 2013.

====Meadowhall Way (SW) bridge====
This was opened at the same time as the Meadowhall Shopping Centre.

====Meadowhall works bridge====
This bridge provides a pedestrian route between Meadowhall Road and that part of the Five Weirs Walk that skirts the Meadowhall Shopping Centre. Erected by Newton Chambers &amp; Co Ltd, Thorncliffe Ironworks, the bridge originally provided access to one of the works (Dunford Hadfields, Shardlows or Arthur Lees) that used to occupy the shopping centre site. This bridge is just downstream of Hadfield&#x27;s Weir.

====Meadowhall Interchange footbridge====
 This cable-stayed enclosed footbridge connects Meadowhall Interchange with the Meadowhall Shopping Centre. It provides pedestrian access to Meadowhall from the Wincobank area of Sheffield, the railway station, the tram station and the bus station. The footbridge crosses the A6109 Meadowhall Road and the Five Weirs Walk, as well as the River Don.

====Meadowhall Way (N) bridge====
These two bridges were opened at the same time as the Meadowhall Shopping Centre.

====Meadowhall Coach Park bridges====
These two bridges (foot and road) were opened at the same time as the Meadowhall Shopping Centre. They connect the coach park and overflow car park to the shopping centre.

====Supertram Bridge====
 This bridge carries the Sheffield Supertram line over the River Don. The Fitzalan Square to Meadowhall section of the tram network was opened on 21 March 1994.

====South Yorkshire Railway bridge====
This bridge carries the Sheffield to Rotherham freight-only railway line. The railway was originally part of the South Yorkshire Railway, which later became part of the Great Central Railway.

====M1 Tinsley Viaduct====
Tinsley Viaduct carries the M1 London to Leeds motorway and the A631 road over the River Don. This two-tier viaduct is over long and was opened in 1968, at a cost of £6 million. It was strengthened in 1983 and again in 2006. The 2006 refurbishment involved the addition of 2,500 tonnes of steel and 3,500 tonnes of reinforced concrete, took three years to complete and cost £81 million.

====Blackburn Meadows bridge====
This works bridge may once have provided road access to Blackburn Meadows Power Station. The area around this bridge would have been affected by the Halfpenny Link Road development proposed in 2005.

====Halfpenny Bridge====

 This bridge carries the Trans-Pennine Trail over the final non-navigable section of the River Don. The Sheffield Canal joins the Don immediately downstream of this footbridge. A century ago it would have cost half a penny for anyone to use the ferry crossing the Tinsley waterway. But 70 years ago, the ferry – and the charge – was scrapped with the building of a bridge. On 15 October 2001, the current bridge was opened to replace the older unsafe bridge. The current bridge is still named Halfpenny Bridge, but cost half a million pounds. The bridge is of steel bowstring construction, with a span. The Sheffield Halfpenny Bridge is not to be confused with the Halfpenny Bridge near Lechlade in Gloucestershire, which marks the start of the navigable River Thames.

==Flora and fauna==
Fig trees grow on a stretch of the river bank in Sheffield. The seeds do not normally germinate in the English climate, but the use of river water for quenching hot metal in some of the foundries resulted in water temperatures rising above 20 deg C. At these temperatures, germination occurred. Most of the trees are over 50 years old, and the demise of such industry along the river has reduced water temperatures, so that there is no evidence of new trees growing.

The industrial nature of the region led to a severe pollution problem for the river, but efforts to improve the water quality and habitat have met with some success, as salmon have been reported in the river near Doncaster. In 2013 a fish pass was built at a weir on the Don at Meadowhall. The weir had been a barrier to the passage of fish for 150 years prior to the construction of the fish pass. It was also planned to construct a fish pass at Sprotbrough weir. Grayling, barble, chub and dace, as well as salmon are expected to benefit from the construction of a series of wiers. In 2020 a fish pass was built at Masbrough Weir, Forge Island, in Rotherham. It is the last of 18 obstructions along the River Don to be made passable by salmon, enabling them to swim to their spawning grounds in Sheffield. The completion of the Masbrough Weir fish pass and a fish pass at Sanderson&#x27;s Weir, in Sheffield means the fish have a route from the North Sea to Sheffield. The project to open-up the river to salmon took 20 years to complete.

<doc id="166838" wikidata="Q1540574" url="?curid=166838" title="River Goyt">
<text>The River Goyt is a tributary of the River Mersey in North West England.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Goyt&quot; may be derived from the Middle English &quot;gote&quot;, meaning &quot;a watercourse, a stream&quot;. Derivation from the Welsh &quot;gwyth&quot; meaning &quot;vein&quot; has been suggested, but described as &quot;doubtful&quot;.

==Course==
The Goyt rises on the moors of Axe Edge, near the River Dane and the Cat and Fiddle Inn. The area is known as the Upper Goyt Valley. The old Cat and Fiddle Road from Buxton to Macclesfield crosses the river just as it turns northwards to flow down its well-known valley. The river then flows under Derbyshire Bridge, which was the old boundary between Derbyshire and Cheshire. Later it reaches an old packhorse bridge that was moved when Errwood reservoir was built in the 1960s (see photo below). Further downstream there is another reservoir, the Fernilee Reservoir, built in 1938. The original line of the Cromford and High Peak Railway can be seen near this point.

The Goyt then passes through Taxal and Horwich End where it is joined by the Todd Brook. Thereafter it passes through Whaley Bridge, New Mills (where it is joined by the River Sett) and Marple Bridge. Having been joined by the River Etherow, the Goyt joins the River Tame at Stockport, forming the River Mersey.

The section of the Goyt valley between Etherow Country Park and Whaley Bridge is followed by the Goyt Way, a walking route and part of the longer Midshires Way.

The River Goyt is reputedly haunted by the ghost of a girl whose Royalist lover drowned in the river.

== Pollution ==
The river&#x27;s Environment Agency pollution classification changed from moderate to poor in its lower section from the Etherow to the Mersey in 2016, and in 2015 for the New Mills to Whaley Bridge length. Otherwise the quality is moderate.

<text>Heimlich maneuver, also known as Abdominal thrusts or Heimlich manoeuvre, is a first-aid procedure used to treat upper-airway obstructions (or choking) by foreign objects. American doctor Henry Heimlich is often credited for its discovery. To perform a Heimlich maneuver, a rescuer stands behind a choking victim and uses their hands to apply pressure to the bottom of the victim&#x27;s diaphragm. This compresses the lungs and exerts pressure on the object lodged in the trachea in an effort to expel it.

Most modern protocols, including those of the American Heart Association, American Red Cross, and European Resuscitation Council, recommend that treatment of airway obstructions be performed in several stages designed to apply increasing levels of pressure. Most protocols recommend encouraging the victim to cough, followed by hard back slaps, and finally abdominal thrusts or chest thrusts as a final resort. Some guidelines also recommend alternating between abdominal thrusts and back slaps.

== History ==
Thoracic surgeon and medical researcher Henry Heimlich, noted for promulgating abdominal thrusts, claimed that back slaps were proven to cause death by lodging foreign objects into the windpipe. A 1982 Yale study by Day, DuBois, and Crelin that persuaded the American Heart Association to stop recommending back blows for dealing with choking was partially funded by Heimlich&#x27;s own foundation. According to Dr. Roger White of the Mayo Clinic and American Heart Association (AHA), &quot;There was never any science here. Heimlich overpowered science all along the way with his slick tactics and intimidation, and everyone, including us at the AHA, caved in.&quot;

Henry Heimlich also promoted abdominal thrusts as a treatment for drowning and asthma attacks. The Red Cross now contests those claims. The Heimlich Institute has stopped advocating on their website for the Heimlich maneuver to be used as a first aid measure for drowning victims. Heimlich&#x27;s son, Peter M. Heimlich, alleges that in August 1974 his father published the first of a series of fraudulent case reports in order to promote the use of abdominal thrusts for near-drowning rescue. The 2005 drowning rescue guidelines of the American Heart Association did not include citations of Heimlich&#x27;s work, and warned against the use of the Heimlich maneuver for drowning rescue as unproven and dangerous, due to its risk of vomiting leading to aspiration.

In May 2016, Henry Heimlich, then age 96, claimed to have personally used the maneuver to save the life of a fellow resident at his retirement home in Cincinnati. It was alleged to be either the first or second time Heimlich himself used his namesake maneuver to save the life of someone in a non-simulated choking situation. According to Heimlich&#x27;s son, Peter M. Heimlich, &quot;both &#x27;rescues&#x27; were bogus.&quot;

==Universal sign of choking==
A choking victim is usually unable to speak, and may not be able to make much sound. A universal sign of choking has been designated as a silent indication from a person who is unable to breathe, and consists of placing both hands on one&#x27;s own throat while trying to attract the attention of others who might help.
== Technique ==
Both the American Red Cross and UK National Health Service (NHS) advise that for a first attempt, a rescuer should encourage the patient to expel the obstruction by coughing. As a second measure, the rescuer should deliver five slaps to the back after bending the patient forward. Abdominal thrusts are recommended only if these methods fail.
The American Red Cross, the NHS, the European Resuscitation Council and the Mayo Clinic recommend a repeating cycle of five back slaps and five abdominal thrusts. They are not recommended on children below the age of one. In contrast to the prevailing American and European advice, the Australian Resuscitation Council recommends chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts.

To perform a Heimlich maneuver, a rescuer stands behind an upright patient, using the hands to exert forceful pressure on the bottom of the diaphragm. As an example, WebMD recommends making a fist with one hand and grasping the fist with the other in order to press with both just above the patient&#x27;s navel. This compresses the lungs and exerts pressure on any object lodged in the trachea in an effort to expel it. The pressure amounts to an artificially induced cough. To assist a larger person, more force may be needed. The Mayo Clinic recommends the same placement of fist and hand, with upward thrusts as if the rescuer is attempting to lift the victim.

If the victim cannot receive pressure on the abdomen (for example, in case of pregnancy or excessive obesity), chest thrusts are advised. These are applied on the lower half of the chest bone, but not in the very endpoint (the xiphoid process, which could be broken).

For victims who are not in an upright position, The American National Institutes of Health recommends positioning the victim on the back, then straddling the torso and employing chest thrusts.

It is possible for conscious choking victims to perform the procedure on themselves, without assistance.

Because of the forceful nature of the procedure, even when performed correctly, abdominal thrusts can injure the victim. Bruising to the abdomen is highly likely and more serious injuries can occur, including fracture of the xiphoid process or ribs. The NHS recommends that victims subjected to abdominal thrusts should seek medical attention after the event.

Researchers at Royal Brompton Hospital have demonstrated that levels of intrathoracic pressures (50–60 cmH2O) exerted by inward abdominal thrusts are similar to those produced when the force is directed both inward and upward. The researchers argue that this may be easier to perform with less concern for injury to the rib cage or upper abdominal organs. Self-administered abdominal thrusts by study participants produced similar pressures to those generated by administers of first aid. The highest pressures were produced by participants performing an abdominal thrust by pressing onto the back of a chair (115 cmH2O).
