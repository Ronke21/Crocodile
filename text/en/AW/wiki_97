<text>In particle physics, a magnetic monopole is a hypothetical elementary particle that is an isolated magnet with only one magnetic pole (a north pole without a south pole or vice versa). A magnetic monopole would have a net north or south &quot;magnetic charge&quot;. Modern interest in the concept stems from particle theories, notably the grand unified and superstring theories, which predict their existence. The known elementary particles that have electric charge are electric monopoles.

Magnetism in bar magnets and electromagnets is not caused by magnetic monopoles, and indeed, there is no known experimental or observational evidence that magnetic monopoles exist.

Some condensed matter systems contain effective (non-isolated) magnetic monopole quasi-particles, or contain phenomena that are mathematically analogous to magnetic monopoles.

== Historical background ==

=== Early science and classical physics ===

Many early scientists attributed the magnetism of lodestones to two different &quot;magnetic fluids&quot; (&quot;effluvia&quot;), a north-pole fluid at one end and a south-pole fluid at the other, which attracted and repelled each other in analogy to positive and negative electric charge. However, an improved understanding of electromagnetism in the nineteenth century showed that the magnetism of lodestones was properly explained not by magnetic monopole fluids, but rather by a combination of electric currents, the electron magnetic moment, and the magnetic moments of other particles. Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism, one of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist. Nevertheless, Pierre Curie pointed out in 1894 that magnetic monopoles &quot;could&quot; conceivably exist, despite not having been seen so far.

=== Quantum mechanics ===

The quantum theory of magnetic charge started with a paper by the physicist Paul Dirac in 1931. In this paper, Dirac showed that if &quot;any&quot; magnetic monopoles exist in the universe, then all electric charge in the universe must be quantized (Dirac quantization condition). The electric charge &quot;is&quot;, in fact, quantized, which is consistent with (but does not prove) the existence of monopoles.

Since Dirac&#x27;s paper, several systematic monopole searches have been performed. Experiments in 1975 and 1982 produced candidate events that were initially interpreted as monopoles, but are now regarded as inconclusive. Therefore, whether monopoles exist remains an open question. Further advances in theoretical particle physics, particularly developments in grand unified theories and quantum gravity, have led to more compelling arguments (detailed below) that monopoles do exist. Joseph Polchinski, a string theorist, described the existence of monopoles as &quot;one of the safest bets that one can make about physics not yet seen&quot;. These theories are not necessarily inconsistent with the experimental evidence. In some theoretical models, magnetic monopoles are unlikely to be observed, because they are too massive to create in particle accelerators (see below), and also too rare in the Universe to enter a particle detector with much probability.

Some condensed matter systems propose a structure superficially similar to a magnetic monopole, known as a flux tube. The ends of a flux tube form a magnetic dipole, but since they move independently, they can be treated for many purposes as independent magnetic monopole quasiparticles. Since 2009, numerous news reports from the popular media have incorrectly described these systems as the long-awaited discovery of the magnetic monopoles, but the two phenomena are only superficially related to one another. These condensed-matter systems remain an area of active research. (See &quot;&quot; below.)

== Poles and magnetism in ordinary matter ==

All matter isolated to date, including every atom on the periodic table and every particle in the Standard Model, has zero magnetic monopole charge. Therefore, the ordinary phenomena of magnetism and magnets do not derive from magnetic monopoles.

Instead, magnetism in ordinary matter is due to two sources. First, electric currents create magnetic fields according to Ampère&#x27;s law. Second, many elementary particles have an &quot;intrinsic&quot; magnetic moment, the most important of which is the electron magnetic dipole moment, which is related to its quantum-mechanical spin.

Mathematically, the magnetic field of an object is often described in terms of a multipole expansion. This is an expression of the field as the sum of component fields with specific mathematical forms. The first term in the expansion is called the &quot;monopole&quot; term, the second is called &quot;dipole&quot;, then &quot;quadrupole&quot;, then &quot;octupole&quot;, and so on. Any of these terms can be present in the multipole expansion of an electric field, for example. However, in the multipole expansion of a &quot;magnetic&quot; field, the &quot;monopole&quot; term is always exactly zero (for ordinary matter). A magnetic monopole, if it exists, would have the defining property of producing a magnetic field whose &quot;monopole&quot; term is non-zero.

A magnetic dipole is something whose magnetic field is predominantly or exactly described by the magnetic dipole term of the multipole expansion. The term &quot;dipole&quot; means &quot;two poles&quot;, corresponding to the fact that a dipole magnet typically contains a &quot;north pole&quot; on one side and a &quot;south pole&quot; on the other side. This is analogous to an electric dipole, which has positive charge on one side and negative charge on the other. However, an electric dipole and magnetic dipole are fundamentally quite different. In an electric dipole made of ordinary matter, the positive charge is made of protons and the negative charge is made of electrons, but a magnetic dipole does &quot;not&quot; have different types of matter creating the north pole and south pole. Instead, the two magnetic poles arise simultaneously from the aggregate effect of all the currents and intrinsic moments throughout the magnet. Because of this, the two poles of a magnetic dipole must always have equal and opposite strength, and the two poles cannot be separated from each other.

== Maxwell&#x27;s equations ==
Maxwell&#x27;s equations of electromagnetism relate the electric and magnetic fields to each other and to the distribution of electric charge and current. The standard equations provide for electric charge, but they posit zero magnetic charge and current. Except for this constraint, the equations are symmetric under the interchange of the electric and magnetic fields. Maxwell&#x27;s equations are symmetric when the charge and electric current density are zero everywhere, as in vacuum.

Maxwell&#x27;s equations can also be written in a fully symmetric form if one allows for &quot;magnetic charge&quot; analogous to electric charge. With the inclusion of a variable for the density of magnetic charge, say , there is also a &quot;magnetic current density&quot; variable in the equations, .

If magnetic charge does not exist – or if it exists but is absent in a region of space – then the new terms in Maxwell&#x27;s equations are all zero, and the extended equations reduce to the conventional equations of electromagnetism such as (where is the divergence operator and is the magnetic flux density).

=== In Gaussian cgs units ===
The extended Maxwell&#x27;s equations are as follows, in CGS-Gaussian units:

In these equations is the &quot;magnetic charge density&quot;, is the &quot;magnetic current density&quot;, and is the &quot;magnetic charge&quot; of a test particle, all defined analogously to the related quantities of electric charge and current; is the particle&#x27;s velocity and is the speed of light. For all other definitions and details, see Maxwell&#x27;s equations. For the equations in nondimensionalized form, remove the factors of .

=== In SI units ===
In the International System of Quantities used with the SI, there are two conventions for defining magnetic charge , each with different units: weber (Wb) and ampere-meter (A⋅m). The conversion between them is , since the units are , where H is the henry – the SI unit of inductance.

Maxwell&#x27;s equations then take the following forms (using the same notation above):
=== Potential formulation ===
Maxwell&#x27;s equations can also be expressed in terms of potentials as follows:

where
: formula_1

where:
* The signature of the Minkowski metric is .
* The electromagnetic tensor and its Hodge dual are antisymmetric tensors:
*: formula_2

The generalized equations are:

Alternatively,

where the {{math|&quot;ε&quot;&quot;αβμν&quot;}} is the Levi-Civita symbol.

=== Duality transformation ===
The generalized Maxwell&#x27;s equations possess a certain symmetry, called a &quot;duality transformation&quot;. One can choose any real angle {{math|&quot;ξ&quot;}}, and simultaneously change the fields and charges everywhere in the universe as follows (in Gaussian units):

where the primed quantities are the charges and fields before the transformation, and the unprimed quantities are after the transformation. The fields and charges after this transformation still obey the same Maxwell&#x27;s equations. 

Because of the duality transformation, one cannot uniquely decide whether a particle has an electric charge, a magnetic charge, or both, just by observing its behavior and comparing that to Maxwell&#x27;s equations. For example, it is merely a convention, not a requirement of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, that electrons have electric charge but not magnetic charge; after a {{math|&quot;ξ&quot; {{=}} {{pi}}/2}} transformation, it would be the other way around. The key empirical fact is that all particles ever observed have the same ratio of magnetic charge to electric charge. Duality transformations can change the ratio to any arbitrary numerical value, but cannot change that all particles have the same ratio. Since this is the case, a duality transformation can be made that sets this ratio at zero, so that all particles have no magnetic charge. This choice underlies the &quot;conventional&quot; definitions of electricity and magnetism.

== Dirac&#x27;s quantization ==
One of the defining advances in quantum theory was Paul Dirac&#x27;s work on developing a relativistic quantum electromagnetism. Before his formulation, the presence of electric charge was simply inserted into the equations of quantum mechanics (QM), but in 1931 Dirac showed that a discrete charge is implied by QM. That is to say, we can maintain the form of Maxwell&#x27;s equations and still have magnetic charges.

Consider a system consisting of a single stationary electric monopole (an electron, say) and a single stationary magnetic monopole, which would not exert any forces on each other. Classically, the electromagnetic field surrounding them has a momentum density given by the Poynting vector, and it also has a total angular momentum, which is proportional to the product {{math|&quot;q&quot;e&quot;q&quot;m}}, and is independent of the distance between them.

Quantum mechanics dictates, however, that angular momentum is quantized as a multiple of {{math|&quot;ħ&quot;}}, so therefore the product {{math|&quot;q&quot;e&quot;q&quot;m}} must also be quantized. This means that if even a single magnetic monopole existed in the universe, and the form of Maxwell&#x27;s equations is valid, all electric charges would then be quantized.

Although it would be possible simply to integrate over all space to find the total angular momentum in the above example, Dirac took a different approach. This led him to new ideas. He considered a point-like magnetic charge whose magnetic field behaves as {{math|{{sfrac|&quot;q&quot;m|&quot;r&quot; 2}}}} and is directed in the radial direction, located at the origin. Because the divergence of {{math|B}} is equal to zero everywhere except for the locus of the magnetic monopole at {{math|&quot;r&quot; {{=}} 0}}, one can locally define the vector potential such that the curl of the vector potential {{math|A}} equals the magnetic field {{math|B}}.

However, the vector potential cannot be defined globally precisely because the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the Dirac delta function at the origin. We must define one set of functions for the vector potential on the &quot;northern hemisphere&quot; (the half-space {{math|&quot;z&quot; &gt; 0}} above the particle), and another set of functions for the &quot;southern hemisphere&quot;. These two vector potentials are matched at the &quot;equator&quot; (the plane {{math|&quot;z&quot; {{=}} 0}} through the particle), and they differ by a gauge transformation. The wave function of an electrically charged particle (a &quot;probe charge&quot;) that orbits the &quot;equator&quot; generally changes by a phase, much like in the Aharonov–Bohm effect. This phase is proportional to the electric charge {{math|&quot;q&quot;e}} of the probe, as well as to the magnetic charge {{math|&quot;q&quot;m}} of the source. Dirac was originally considering an electron whose wave function is described by the Dirac equation.

Because the electron returns to the same point after the full trip around the equator, the phase {{math|&quot;φ&quot;}} of its wave function {{math|&quot;eiφ&quot;}} must be unchanged, which implies that the phase {{math|&quot;φ&quot;}} added to the wave function must be a multiple of {{math|2{{pi}}}}. This is known as the Dirac quantization condition. In various units, this condition can be expressed as:
where {{math|&quot;ε&quot;0}} is the vacuum permittivity, {{math|&quot;ħ&quot; {{=}} &quot;h&quot;/2{{pi}}}} is the reduced Planck constant, {{math|&quot;c&quot;}} is the speed of light, and formula_3 is the set of integers.

The hypothetical existence of a magnetic monopole would imply that the electric charge must be quantized in certain units; also, the existence of the electric charges implies that the magnetic charges of the hypothetical magnetic monopoles, if they exist, must be quantized in units inversely proportional to the elementary electric charge.

At the time it was not clear if such a thing existed, or even had to. After all, another theory could come along that would explain charge quantization without need for the monopole. The concept remained something of a curiosity. However, in the time since the publication of this seminal work, no other widely accepted explanation of charge quantization has appeared. (The concept of local gauge invariance—see &quot;Gauge theory&quot;—provides a natural explanation of charge quantization, without invoking the need for magnetic monopoles; but only if the U(1) gauge group is compact, in which case we have magnetic monopoles anyway.)

If we maximally extend the definition of the vector potential for the southern hemisphere, it is defined everywhere except for a semi-infinite line stretched from the origin in the direction towards the northern pole. This semi-infinite line is called the Dirac string and its effect on the wave function is analogous to the effect of the solenoid in the Aharonov–Bohm effect. The quantization condition comes from the requirement that the phases around the Dirac string are trivial, which means that the Dirac string must be unphysical. The Dirac string is merely an artifact of the coordinate chart used and should not be taken seriously.

The Dirac monopole is a singular solution of Maxwell&#x27;s equation (because it requires removing the worldline from spacetime); in more sophisticated theories, it is superseded by a smooth solution such as the &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopole.

== Topological interpretation ==

=== Dirac string ===
{{Main|Dirac string}}
A gauge theory like electromagnetism is defined by a gauge field, which associates a group element to each path in space time. For infinitesimal paths, the group element is close to the identity, while for longer paths the group element is the successive product of the infinitesimal group elements along the way.

In electrodynamics, the group is U(1), unit complex numbers under multiplication. For infinitesimal paths, the group element is {{math|1 + &quot;iA&quot;&quot;μ&quot;&quot;dx&quot;&quot;μ&quot;}} which implies that for finite paths parametrized by {{math|&quot;s&quot;}}, the group element is:
{{block indent|1=formula_4}}

The map from paths to group elements is called the Wilson loop or the holonomy, and for a U(1) gauge group it is the phase factor which the wavefunction of a charged particle acquires as it traverses the path. For a loop:

{{block indent|1=formula_5}}

So that the phase a charged particle gets when going in a loop is the magnetic flux through the loop. When a small solenoid has a magnetic flux, there are interference fringes for charged particles which go around the solenoid, or around different sides of the solenoid, which reveal its presence.

But if all particle charges are integer multiples of {{math|&quot;e&quot;}}, solenoids with a flux of {{math|2{{pi}}/&quot;e&quot;}} have no interference fringes, because the phase factor for any charged particle is {{math|1=exp(2{{pi}}&quot;i&quot;) = 1}}. Such a solenoid, if thin enough, is quantum-mechanically invisible. If such a solenoid were to carry a flux of {{math|2{{pi}}/&quot;e&quot;}}, when the flux leaked out from one of its ends it would be indistinguishable from a monopole.

Dirac&#x27;s monopole solution in fact describes an infinitesimal line solenoid ending at a point, and the location of the solenoid is the singular part of the solution, the Dirac string. Dirac strings link monopoles and antimonopoles of opposite magnetic charge, although in Dirac&#x27;s version, the string just goes off to infinity. The string is unobservable, so you can put it anywhere, and by using two coordinate patches, the field in each patch can be made nonsingular by sliding the string to where it cannot be seen.

=== Grand unified theories ===
{{main|&#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopole}}
In a U(1) gauge group with quantized charge, the group is a circle of radius {{math|2{{pi}}/&quot;e&quot;}}. Such a U(1) gauge group is called compact. Any U(1) that comes from a grand unified theory (GUT) is compact – because only compact higher gauge groups make sense. The size of the gauge group is a measure of the inverse coupling constant, so that in the limit of a large-volume gauge group, the interaction of any fixed representation goes to zero.

The case of the U(1) gauge group is a special case because all its irreducible representations are of the same size – the charge is bigger by an integer amount, but the field is still just a complex number – so that in U(1) gauge field theory it is possible to take the decompactified limit with no contradiction. The quantum of charge becomes small, but each charged particle has a huge number of charge quanta so its charge stays finite. In a non-compact U(1) gauge group theory, the charges of particles are generically not integer multiples of a single unit. Since charge quantization is an experimental certainty, it is clear that the U(1) gauge group of electromagnetism is compact.

GUTs lead to compact U(1) gauge groups, so they explain charge quantization in a way that seems logically independent from magnetic monopoles. However, the explanation is essentially the same, because in any GUT that breaks down into a U(1) gauge group at long distances, there are magnetic monopoles.

The argument is topological:
# The holonomy of a gauge field maps loops to elements of the gauge group. Infinitesimal loops are mapped to group elements infinitesimally close to the identity.
# If you imagine a big sphere in space, you can deform an infinitesimal loop that starts and ends at the north pole as follows: stretch out the loop over the western hemisphere until it becomes a great circle (which still starts and ends at the north pole) then let it shrink back to a little loop while going over the eastern hemisphere. This is called &quot;lassoing the sphere&quot;.
# Lassoing is a sequence of loops, so the holonomy maps it to a sequence of group elements, a continuous path in the gauge group. Since the loop at the beginning of the lassoing is the same as the loop at the end, the path in the group is closed.
# If the group path associated to the lassoing procedure winds around the U(1), the sphere contains magnetic charge. During the lassoing, the holonomy changes by the amount of magnetic flux through the sphere.
# Since the holonomy at the beginning and at the end is the identity, the total magnetic flux is quantized. The magnetic charge is proportional to the number of windings {{math|&quot;N&quot;}}, the magnetic flux through the sphere is equal to {{math|2{{pi}}&quot;N&quot;/&quot;e&quot;}}. This is the Dirac quantization condition, and it is a topological condition that demands that the long distance U(1) gauge field configurations be consistent.
# When the U(1) gauge group comes from breaking a compact Lie group, the path that winds around the U(1) group enough times is topologically trivial in the big group. In a non-U(1) compact Lie group, the covering space is a Lie group with the same Lie algebra, but where all closed loops are contractible. Lie groups are homogeneous, so that any cycle in the group can be moved around so that it starts at the identity, then its lift to the covering group ends at {{math|&quot;P&quot;}}, which is a lift of the identity. Going around the loop twice gets you to {{math|&quot;P&quot;2}}, three times to {{math|&quot;P&quot;3}}, all lifts of the identity. But there are only finitely many lifts of the identity, because the lifts can&#x27;t accumulate. This number of times one has to traverse the loop to make it contractible is small, for example if the GUT group is SO(3), the covering group is SU(2), and going around any loop twice is enough.
# This means that there is a continuous gauge-field configuration in the GUT group allows the U(1) monopole configuration to unwind itself at short distances, at the cost of not staying in the U(1). To do this with as little energy as possible, you should leave only the U(1) gauge group in the neighborhood of one point, which is called the core of the monopole. Outside the core, the monopole has only magnetic field energy.

Hence, the Dirac monopole is a topological defect in a compact U(1) gauge theory. When there is no GUT, the defect is a singularity – the core shrinks to a point. But when there is some sort of short-distance regulator on spacetime, the monopoles have a finite mass. Monopoles occur in lattice U(1), and there the core size is the lattice size. In general, they are expected to occur whenever there is a short-distance regulator.

=== String theory ===
In the universe, quantum gravity provides the regulator. When gravity is included, the monopole singularity can be a black hole, and for large magnetic charge and mass, the black hole mass is equal to the black hole charge, so that the mass of the magnetic black hole is not infinite. If the black hole can decay completely by Hawking radiation, the lightest charged particles cannot be too heavy. The lightest monopole should have a mass less than or comparable to its charge in natural units.

So in a consistent holographic theory, of which string theory is the only known example, there are always finite-mass monopoles. For ordinary electromagnetism, the upper mass bound is not very useful because it is about same size as the Planck mass.

=== Mathematical formulation ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2021}}
In mathematics, a (classical) gauge field is defined as a connection over a principal G-bundle over spacetime. {{math|G}} is the gauge group, and it acts on each fiber of the bundle separately.

A &quot;connection&quot; on a {{math|G}}-bundle tells you how to glue fibers together at nearby points of {{math|M}}. It starts with a continuous symmetry group {{math|G}} that acts on the fiber {{math|F}}, and then it associates a group element with each infinitesimal path. Group multiplication along any path tells you how to move from one point on the bundle to another, by having the {{math|G}} element associated to a path act on the fiber {{math|F}}.

In mathematics, the definition of bundle is designed to emphasize topology, so the notion of connection is added on as an afterthought. In physics, the connection is the fundamental physical object. One of the fundamental observations in the theory of characteristic classes in algebraic topology is that many homotopical structures of nontrivial principal bundles may be expressed as an integral of some polynomial over &quot;any&quot; connection over it. Note that a connection over a trivial bundle can never give us a nontrivial principal bundle.

If spacetime is formula_6 the space of all possible connections of the {{math|G}}-bundle is connected. But consider what happens when we remove a timelike worldline from spacetime. The resulting spacetime is homotopically equivalent to the topological sphere {{math|&quot;S&quot;2}}.

A principal {{math|G}}-bundle over {{math|&quot;S&quot;2}} is defined by covering {{math|&quot;S&quot;2}} by two charts, each homeomorphic to the open 2-ball such that their intersection is homeomorphic to the strip {{math|&quot;S&quot;1×&quot;I&quot;}}. 2-balls are homotopically trivial and the strip is homotopically equivalent to the circle {{math|&quot;S&quot;1}}. So a topological classification of the possible connections is reduced to classifying the transition functions. The transition function maps the strip to {{math|G}}, and the different ways of mapping a strip into {{math|G}} are given by the first homotopy group of {{math|G}}.

So in the {{math|G}}-bundle formulation, a gauge theory admits Dirac monopoles provided {{math|G}} is not simply connected, whenever there are paths that go around the group that cannot be deformed to a constant path (a path whose image consists of a single point). U(1), which has quantized charges, is not simply connected and can have Dirac monopoles while formula_7, its universal covering group, &quot;is&quot; simply connected, doesn&#x27;t have quantized charges and does not admit Dirac monopoles. The mathematical definition is equivalent to the physics definition provided that—following Dirac—gauge fields are allowed that are defined only patch-wise, and the gauge field on different patches are glued after a gauge transformation.

The total magnetic flux is none other than the first Chern number of the principal bundle, and depends only upon the choice of the principal bundle, and not the specific connection over it. In other words, it is a topological invariant.

This argument for monopoles is a restatement of the lasso argument for a pure U(1) theory. It generalizes to {{math|&quot;d&quot; + 1}} dimensions with {{math|&quot;d&quot; ≥ 2}} in several ways. One way is to extend everything into the extra dimensions, so that U(1) monopoles become sheets of dimension {{math|&quot;d&quot; − 3}}. Another way is to examine the type of topological singularity at a point with the homotopy group {{math|{{pi}}&quot;d&quot;−2(G)}}.

== Grand unified theories ==
In more recent years, a new class of theories has also suggested the existence of magnetic monopoles.

During the early 1970s, the successes of quantum field theory and gauge theory in the development of electroweak theory and the mathematics of the strong nuclear force led many theorists to move on to attempt to combine them in a single theory known as a Grand Unified Theory (GUT). Several GUTs were proposed, most of which implied the presence of a real magnetic monopole particle. More accurately, GUTs predicted a range of particles known as dyons, of which the most basic state was a monopole. The charge on magnetic monopoles predicted by GUTs is either 1 or 2 &quot;gD&quot;, depending on the theory.

The majority of particles appearing in any quantum field theory are unstable, and they decay into other particles in a variety of reactions that must satisfy various conservation laws. Stable particles are stable because there are no lighter particles into which they can decay and still satisfy the conservation laws. For instance, the electron has a lepton number of one and an electric charge of one, and there are no lighter particles that conserve these values. On the other hand, the muon, essentially a heavy electron, can decay into the electron plus two quanta of energy, and hence it is not stable.

The dyons in these GUTs are also stable, but for an entirely different reason. The dyons are expected to exist as a side effect of the &quot;freezing out&quot; of the conditions of the early universe, or a symmetry breaking. In this scenario, the dyons arise due to the configuration of the vacuum in a particular area of the universe, according to the original Dirac theory. They remain stable not because of a conservation condition, but because there is no simpler &quot;topological&quot; state into which they can decay.

The length scale over which this special vacuum configuration exists is called the &quot;correlation length&quot; of the system. A correlation length cannot be larger than causality would allow, therefore the correlation length for making magnetic monopoles must be at least as big as the horizon size determined by the metric of the expanding universe. According to that logic, there should be at least one magnetic monopole per horizon volume as it was when the symmetry breaking took place.

Cosmological models of the events following the Big Bang make predictions about what the horizon volume was, which lead to predictions about present-day monopole density. Early models predicted an enormous density of monopoles, in clear contradiction to the experimental evidence. This was called the &quot;monopole problem&quot;. Its widely accepted resolution was not a change in the particle-physics prediction of monopoles, but rather in the cosmological models used to infer their present-day density. Specifically, more recent theories of cosmic inflation drastically reduce the predicted number of magnetic monopoles, to a density small enough to make it unsurprising that humans have never seen one. This resolution of the &quot;monopole problem&quot; was regarded as a success of cosmic inflation theory. (However, of course, it is only a noteworthy success if the particle-physics monopole prediction is correct.) For these reasons, monopoles became a major interest in the 1970s and 80s, along with the other &quot;approachable&quot; predictions of GUTs such as proton decay.

Many of the other particles predicted by these GUTs were beyond the abilities of current experiments to detect. For instance, a wide class of particles known as the X and Y bosons are predicted to mediate the coupling of the electroweak and strong forces, but these particles are extremely heavy and well beyond the capabilities of any reasonable particle accelerator to create.

== Searches for magnetic monopoles ==
Experimental searches for magnetic monopoles can be placed in one of two categories: those that try to detect preexisting magnetic monopoles and those that try to create and detect new magnetic monopoles.

Passing a magnetic monopole through a coil of wire induces a net current in the coil. This is not the case for a magnetic dipole or higher order magnetic pole, for which the net induced current is zero, and hence the effect can be used as an unambiguous test for the presence of magnetic monopoles. In a wire with finite resistance, the induced current quickly dissipates its energy as heat, but in a superconducting loop the induced current is long-lived. By using a highly sensitive &quot;superconducting quantum interference device&quot; (SQUID) one can, in principle, detect even a single magnetic monopole.

According to standard inflationary cosmology, magnetic monopoles produced before inflation would have been diluted to an extremely low density today. Magnetic monopoles may also have been produced thermally after inflation, during the period of reheating. However, the current bounds on the reheating temperature span 18 orders of magnitude and as a consequence the density of magnetic monopoles today is not well constrained by theory.

There have been many searches for preexisting magnetic monopoles. Although there has been one tantalizing event recorded, by Blas Cabrera Navarro on the night of February 14, 1982 (thus, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day Monopole&quot;), there has never been reproducible evidence for the existence of magnetic monopoles. The lack of such events places an upper limit on the number of monopoles of about one monopole per 1029 nucleons.

Another experiment in 1975 resulted in the announcement of the detection of a moving magnetic monopole in cosmic rays by the team led by P. Buford Price. Price later retracted his claim, and a possible alternative explanation was offered by Luis Walter Alvarez. In his paper it was demonstrated that the path of the cosmic ray event that was claimed due to a magnetic monopole could be reproduced by the path followed by a platinum nucleus decaying first to osmium, and then to tantalum.

High-energy particle colliders have been used to try to create magnetic monopoles. Due to the conservation of magnetic charge, magnetic monopoles must be created in pairs, one north and one south. Due to conservation of energy, only magnetic monopoles with masses less than half of the center of mass energy of the colliding particles can be produced. Beyond this, very little is known theoretically about the creation of magnetic monopoles in high-energy particle collisions. This is due to their large magnetic charge, which invalidates all the usual calculational techniques. As a consequence, collider-based searches for magnetic monopoles cannot, as yet, provide lower bounds on the mass of magnetic monopoles. They can however provide upper bounds on the probability (or cross section) of pair production, as a function of energy.

The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider currently has the most stringent cross section limits for magnetic monopoles of 1 and 2 Dirac charges, produced through Drell–Yan pair production. A team led by Wendy Taylor searches for these particles based on theories that define them as long lived (they do not quickly decay), as well as being highly ionizing (their interaction with matter is predominantly ionizing). In 2019 the search for magnetic monopoles in the ATLAS detector reported its first results from data collected from the LHC Run 2 collisions at center of mass energy of 13 TeV, which at 34.4 fb−1 is the largest dataset analyzed to date.

The MoEDAL experiment, installed at the Large Hadron Collider, is currently searching for magnetic monopoles and large supersymmetric particles using nuclear track detectors and aluminum bars around LHCb&#x27;s VELO detector. The particles it is looking for damage the plastic sheets that comprise the nuclear track detectors along their path, with various identifying features. Further, the aluminum bars can trap sufficiently slowly moving magnetic monopoles. The bars can then be analyzed by passing them through a SQUID.

== &quot;Monopoles&quot; in condensed-matter systems ==

Since around 2003, various condensed-matter physics groups have used the term &quot;magnetic monopole&quot; to describe a different and largely unrelated phenomenon.

A true magnetic monopole would be a new elementary particle, and would violate Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism {{math|∇⋅B {{=}} 0}}. A monopole of this kind, which would help to explain the law of charge quantization as formulated by Paul Dirac in 1931, has never been observed in experiments.

The monopoles studied by condensed-matter groups have none of these properties. They are not a new elementary particle, but rather are an emergent phenomenon in systems of everyday particles (protons, neutrons, electrons, photons); in other words, they are quasi-particles. They are not sources for the {{math|B}}-field (i.e., they do not violate {{math|∇⋅B {{=}} 0}}); instead, they are sources for other fields, for example the {{math|H}}-field, the &quot;{{math|B*}}-field&quot; (related to superfluid vorticity), or various other quantum fields. They are not directly relevant to grand unified theories or other aspects of particle physics, and do not help explain charge quantization—except insofar as studies of analogous situations can help confirm that the mathematical analyses involved are sound.

There are a number of examples in condensed-matter physics where collective behavior leads to emergent phenomena that resemble magnetic monopoles in certain respects, including most prominently the spin ice materials. While these should not be confused with hypothetical elementary monopoles existing in the vacuum, they nonetheless have similar properties and can be probed using similar techniques.

Some researchers use the term magnetricity to describe the manipulation of magnetic monopole quasiparticles in spin ice, in analogy to the word &quot;electricity&quot;.

One example of the work on magnetic monopole quasiparticles is a paper published in the journal &quot;Science&quot; in September 2009, in which researchers described the observation of quasiparticles resembling magnetic monopoles. A single crystal of the spin ice material dysprosium titanate was cooled to a temperature between 0.6 kelvin and 2.0 kelvin. Using observations of neutron scattering, the magnetic moments were shown to align into interwoven tubelike bundles resembling Dirac strings. At the defect formed by the end of each tube, the magnetic field looks like that of a monopole. Using an applied magnetic field to break the symmetry of the system, the researchers were able to control the density and orientation of these strings. A contribution to the heat capacity of the system from an effective gas of these quasiparticles was also described.
This research went on to win the 2012 Europhysics Prize for condensed matter physics.

In another example, a paper in the February 11, 2011 issue of &quot;Nature Physics&quot; describes creation and measurement of long-lived magnetic monopole quasiparticle currents in spin ice. By applying a magnetic-field pulse to crystal of dysprosium titanate at 0.36 K, the authors created a relaxing magnetic current that lasted for several minutes. They measured the current by means of the electromotive force it induced in a solenoid coupled to a sensitive amplifier, and quantitatively described it using a chemical kinetic model of point-like charges obeying the Onsager–Wien mechanism of carrier dissociation and recombination. They thus derived the microscopic parameters of monopole motion in spin ice and identified the distinct roles of free and bound magnetic charges.

In superfluids, there is a field {{math|B*}}, related to superfluid vorticity, which is mathematically analogous to the magnetic {{math|B}}-field. Because of the similarity, the field {{math|B*}} is called a &quot;synthetic magnetic field&quot;. In January 2014, it was reported that monopole quasiparticles for the {{math|B*}} field were created and studied in a spinor Bose–Einstein condensate. This constitutes the first example of a quasi-magnetic monopole observed within a system governed by quantum field theory.

Updates to the theoretical and experimental searches in matter can be found in the reports by G. Giacomelli (2000) and by S. Balestra (2011) in the Bibliography section.

<doc id="175472" wikidata="Q1910347" url="?curid=175472" title="Tokyo Rose">
<text>Tokyo Rose (alternative spelling Tokio Rose) was a name given by Allied troops in the South Pacific during World War II to all female English-speaking radio broadcasters of Japanese propaganda. The programs were broadcast in the South Pacific and North America to demoralize Allied forces abroad and their families at home by emphasizing troops&#x27; wartime difficulties and military losses. Several female broadcasters operated using different aliases and in different cities throughout the territories occupied by the Japanese Empire, including Tokyo, Manila, and Shanghai. The name &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot; was never actually used by any Japanese broadcaster, but it first appeared in U.S. newspapers in the context of these radio programs during 1943.

During the war, Tokyo Rose was not any one individual, but rather a group of largely unassociated women working for the same propagandist effort throughout the Japanese Empire. In the years soon after the war, the character &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot; – whom the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) now avers to be &quot;mythical&quot; – became an important symbol of Japanese villainy for the United States. American cartoons, movies, and propaganda videos between 1945 and 1960 tend to portray her as sexualized, manipulative, and deadly to American interests in the South Pacific, particularly by revealing intelligence of American losses in radio broadcasts. Similar accusations concern the propaganda broadcasts of Lord Haw-Haw and Axis Sally, and in 1949 the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; described Tokyo Rose as the &quot;Mata Hari of radio&quot;.

Tokyo Rose ceased to be merely a symbol in September 1945 when Iva Toguri D&#x27;Aquino, a Japanese-American disc jockey for a propagandist radio program, attempted to return to the United States. Toguri was accused of being the &quot;real&quot; Tokyo Rose, and arrested, tried, and became the seventh person in U.S. history to be convicted of treason. Toguri was eventually paroled from prison in 1956, but it was more than twenty years later that she received an official presidential pardon for her role in the war.

==Iva Toguri and &quot;The Zero Hour&quot;==

Although she broadcast using the name &quot;Orphan Ann&quot;, Iva Toguri has been known as &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot; since her return to the United States in 1945. An American citizen and the daughter of Japanese immigrants, Toguri traveled to Japan to tend to a sick aunt just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Unable to leave the country when war began with the United States, unable to stay with her aunt&#x27;s family as an American citizen, and unable to receive any aid from her parents who were placed in internment camps in Arizona, Toguri eventually accepted a job as a part-time typist at Radio Tokyo (NHK). She was quickly recruited as a broadcaster for the 75-minute propagandist program &quot;The Zero Hour&quot;, which consisted of skits, news reports, and popular American music.

According to studies conducted during 1968, of the 94 men who were interviewed and who recalled listening to &quot;The Zero Hour&quot; while serving in the Pacific, 89% recognized it as &quot;propaganda&quot;, and less than 10% felt &quot;demoralized&quot; by it. 84% of the men listened because the program had &quot;good entertainment,&quot; and one G.I. remarked, &quot;[l]ots of us thought she was on our side all along.&quot;

After World War II ended in 1945, the U.S. military detained Toguri for a year before releasing her due to lack of evidence. Department of Justice officials agreed that her broadcasts were &quot;innocuous&quot;. But when Toguri tried to return to the United States, an uproar ensued because Walter Winchell (a powerful broadcasting personality) and the American Legion lobbied relentlessly for a trial, prompting the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to renew its investigation of Toguri&#x27;s wartime activities. Her 1949 trial resulted in a conviction on one of eight counts of treason.

In 1974, investigative journalists found that important witnesses had asserted that they were forced to lie during testimony. They stated that FBI and US occupation police had coached them for more than two months about what they should say on the stand, and that they had been threatened with treason trials themselves if they did not cooperate. U.S. President Gerald Ford pardoned Toguri in 1977 based on these revelations and earlier issues with the indictment.

==Tokyo Mose==
Walter Kaner (May 5, 1920 – June 26, 2005) was a journalist and radio personality who broadcast using the name &quot;Tokyo Mose&quot; during and after World War II. Kaner broadcast on U.S. Army Radio, at first to offer comic rejoinders to the propaganda broadcasts of Tokyo Rose and then as a parody to entertain U.S. troops abroad. In U.S.-occupied Japan, his &quot;Moshi, Moshi Ano-ne&quot; jingle was sung to the tune of &quot;London Bridge is Falling Down&quot; and became so popular with Japanese children and G.I.s that the U.S. military&#x27;s &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; newspaper called it &quot;the Japanese occupation theme song.&quot; In 1946, Elsa Maxwell referred to Kaner as &quot;the breath of home to unknown thousands of our young men when they were lonely.&quot;

<text>A pedestrian is a person traveling on foot, whether walking or running. In modern times, the term usually refers to someone walking on a road or pavement (US: sidewalk), but this was not the case historically. Pedestrians may also be wheelchair users or other disabled people who use mobility aids.

==Etymology==

The meaning of pedestrian is displayed with the morphemes &quot;ped-&quot; (&#x27;foot&#x27;) and &quot;-ian&quot; (&#x27;characteristic of&#x27;). This word is derived from the Latin term &quot;pedester&quot; (&#x27;going on foot&#x27;) and was first used (in the English language) during the 18th century. It was originally used, and can still be used today, as an adjective meaning plain or dull. However, in this article it takes on its noun form and refers to someone who walks.

The word pedestrian may have been used in middle French in the &quot;Recueil des Croniques et Anchiennes Istories de la Grant Bretaigne&quot;.

==History==

Walking has always been the primary means of human locomotion. The first humans to migrate from Africa, about 60,000 years ago, walked. They walked along the coast of India to reach Australia. They walked across Asia to reach the Americas, and from Central Asia into Europe.

With the advent of the cars at the beginning of the 20th century, the main story is that the cars took over, and &quot;people chose the car&quot;, but there were many groups and movements that held on to walking as their preferred means of daily transport and some who organised to promote walking, and to counterbalance the widely-held view that often favoured cars, e.g. as related by Peter Norton.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, pedestrianism (walking) was non a popular spectator sport, just as equestrianism (riding) still is in places. One of the most famous pedestrians of that period was Captain Robert Barclay Allardice, known as &quot;The Celebrated Pedestrian&quot;, of Stonehaven in Scotland. His most impressive feat was to walk every hour for 1000 hours, which he achieved between 1 June and 12 July 1809. This feat captured many people&#x27;s imagination, and around 10,000 people came to watch over the course of the event. During the rest of the 19th century, many people tried to repeat this feat, including Ada Anderson who developed it further and walked a half-mile (800 m) each quarter-hour over the 1000 hours.

Since the 20th century, interest in walking as a sport has dropped. Racewalking is still an Olympic sport, but fails to catch public attention as it did. However major walking feats are still performed, such as the Land&#x27;s End to John o&#x27; Groats walk in the United Kingdom, and the traversal of North America from coast to coast. The first person to walk around the world was Dave Kunst who started his walk traveling east from Waseca, Minnesota on 20 June 1970 and completed his journey on 5 October 1974, when he re-entered the town from the west. These feats are often tied to charitable fundraising and are undertaken, among others, by celebrities such as Sir Jimmy Savile and Ian Botham.

==Footpaths and roads==

===Outdoor pedestrian networks===

Roads often have a designated footpath for pedestrian traffic, called the &quot;sidewalk&quot; in North American English, the &quot;pavement&quot; in British English, and the &quot;footpath&quot; in Australian and New Zealand English. There are also footpaths not associated with a road; these include urban short cuts and also rural paths used mainly by ramblers, hikers, or hill-walkers. Footpaths in mountainous or forested areas may also be called &quot;trails&quot;. Pedestrians share some footpaths with horses and bicycles: these paths may be known as bridleways. Other byways used by walkers are also accessible to vehicles. There are also many roads with no footpath. Some modern towns (such as the new suburbs of Peterborough in England) are designed with the network of footpaths and cycle paths almost entirely separate from the road network.

The term &quot;trail&quot; is also used by the authorities in some countries to mean any footpath that is not attached to a road or street. If such footpaths are in urban environments and are meant for both pedestrians and pedal cyclists, they can be called &quot;shared use paths&quot; or &quot;multi-use paths&quot; in general and official usage.

Some shopping streets are for pedestrians only. Some roads have special pedestrian crossings. A bridge solely for pedestrians is a footbridge.

In Britain, regardless of whether there is a footpath, pedestrians have the legal right to use most public roads, excluding motorways and some toll tunnels and bridges such as the Blackwall Tunnel and the Dartford Crossing — although sometimes it may endanger the pedestrian and other road users. The UK Highway Code advises that pedestrians should walk in the opposite direction to oncoming traffic on a road with no footpath.

===Indoor pedestrian networks===
Indoor pedestrian networks connect the different rooms or spaces of a building. Airports, museums, campuses, hospitals and shopping centres might have tools allowing for the computation of the shortest paths between two destinations. Their increasing availability is due to the complexity of path finding in these facilities. Different mapping tools, such as OpenStreetMap, are extending to indoor spaces.

==Pedestrianisation==

Pedestrianisation might be considered as a process of removing vehicular traffic from city streets or restricting vehicular access to streets for use by pedestrians, to improve the environment and safety.

Efforts are under way by pedestrian advocacy groups to restore pedestrian access to new developments, especially to counteract newer developments, 20% to 30% of which in the United States do not include footpaths. Some activists advocate large pedestrian zones where only pedestrians, or pedestrians and some non-motorised vehicles, are allowed. Many urbanists have extolled the virtues of pedestrian streets in urban areas. In the US the proportion of households without a car is 8%, but a notable exception is New York City, the only locality in the United States where more than half of all households do not own a car (the figure is even higher in Manhattan, over 75%).

The use of cars for short journeys is officially discouraged in many parts of the world, and construction or separation of dedicated walking routes in city centres receives a high priority in many large cities in Western Europe, often in conjunction with public transport enhancements. In Copenhagen, the world&#x27;s longest pedestrian shopping area, Strøget, has been developed over the last 40 years, principally due to the work of Danish architect Jan Gehl, a principle of urban design known as &quot;copenhagenisation&quot;.

==Safety issues==

Safety is an important issue where cars can cross the pedestrian way. Drivers and pedestrians share some responsibility for improving safety of road users. Road traffic crashes are not inevitable; they are both predictable and preventable.

Key risks for pedestrians are well known. Among the well-documented factors are driver behaviour (including speeding and drunk driving); infrastructure missing facilities (including pavements, crossings and islands); and vehicle designs which are not forgiving to pedestrians struck by a vehicle. The Traffic Injury Research Foundation describes pedestrians as vulnerable road users because they are not protected in the same way as occupants of motor vehicles. There is an increasing focus on pedestrians versus motor vehicles in many countries.

Most pedestrian injuries occur while they are crossing a street. In the United States, 20% of pedestrian crash fatalities are linked to jaywalking, defined as improper crossing of a roadway or intersection. Most crashes involving a pedestrian occur at night. Most pedestrian fatalities are killed by a frontal impact. In such a situation, an adult pedestrian is struck by a car front (for instance, the bumper touches either the leg or knee-joint area), accelerating the lower part of the body forward while &quot;the upper body is rotated and accelerated relative to the car,&quot; at which point the pelvis and thorax are hit. Then the head hits the windscreen at the velocity of the striking car. Finally, the victim falls to the ground.

Research has shown that urban crimes, or the mere perception of crimes, severely affect the mental and physical health of pedestrians. Inter-pedestrian behaviour, without the involvement of vehicles, is also a key factor to pedestrian safety.

Some special interest groups consider pedestrian fatalities on American roads a carnage.
Five states – Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia and Texas – are the site of 46% of all pedestrian deaths in the country.
The advent of SUVs is considered a leading cause; speculation of other factors includes population growth, driver distraction with mobile phones, poor street lighting, alcohol and drugs and speeding.

Cities have had mixed results in addressing pedestrian safety with Vision zero plan: Los Angeles fails while NYC has had success. Nonetheless, in the US, some pedestrians have just 40 seconds to cross a street 10 lanes wide.

Pedestrian fatalities are much more common in accident situations in the European Union than in the United States. In the European Union countries, more than 200,000 pedestrians and cyclists are injured annually. Also, each year, more than 270 000 pedestrians lose their lives on the world&#x27;s roads. At a global level pedestrians constitute 22% of all road deaths, but might be two-thirds in some countries.
Pedestrian fatalities, in 2016, were 2.6 per million population in the Netherlands, 4.3 in Sweden, 4.5 in Wales, 5.3 in New Zealand, 6.0 in Germany; 7.1 in the whole United Kingdom, 7.5 in Australia, 8.4 in France, 8.4 in Spain, 9.4 in Italy, 11.1 in Israel, 13 in Japan, 13.8 in Greece, 18.5 in the United States, 22.9 in Poland, and 36.3 in Romania.

===Safety trends===
===Road design impact on safety===

It is well documented that a minor increase in speed might greatly increase the likelihood of a crash, and exacerbate resulting casualties. For this reason, the recommended maximum speed is or in residential and high pedestrian traffic areas, with enforced traffic rules on speed limits
and traffic-calming measures.
The design of road and streets plays a key role in pedestrian safety. Roads are too often designed for motorized vehicles, without taking into account pedestrian and bicycle needs. The non-existence of sidewalk and signals increases risk for pedestrians. This defect might more easily be observed on arterial roadways, intersections and fast-speed lanes without adequate attention to pedestrian facilities. For instance, an assessment of roads in countries from many continents shows that 84% of roads are without pedestrian footpaths, while maximum limited speed is greater than 40 km/h.

Among the factors which reduce road safety for pedestrians are wider lanes, roadway widening, and roadways designed for higher speeds and with increased numbers of traffic lanes.

For this reason, some European cities such as Freiburg (Germany) have lowered the speed limit to 30 km/h on 90% of its streets, to reduce risk for its 15 000 people. With such policy, 24% of daily trips are performed by foot, against 28% by bicycles, 20% by public transport and 28% by car. (See Zone 30.)

A similar set of policies to discourage the use of cars and increase safety for pedestrians has been implemented by the Northern European capitals of Oslo and Helsinki. In 2019, this resulted in both cities counting zero pedestrian deaths for the first time.

===Seasonality===

In Europe, pedestrian fatalities have a seasonal factor, with 6% of annual fatalities occurring in April but 13% (twice more) in December. The rationale for such a change might be complex.

==Health benefits and environment==

Regular walking is important both for human health and for the natural environment. Frequent exercise such as walking tends to reduce the chance of obesity and related medical problems. In contrast, using a car for short trips tends to contribute both to obesity and via vehicle emissions to climate change: internal combustion engines are more inefficient and highly polluting during their first minutes of operation (engine cold start). General availability of public transportation encourages walking, as it will not, in most cases, take one directly to one&#x27;s destination.

==Unicode==
In Unicode, the hexadecimal code for &quot;pedestrian&quot; is 1F6B6. In XML and HTML, the string codice_1 produces 🚶.

<doc id="175478" wikidata="Q7575158" url="?curid=175478" title="Spectra (poetry collection)">
<text>Spectra: A Book of Poetic Experiments was a small volume of poetry published in 1916 by American writers Witter Bynner, who wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Emanuel Morgan&quot;, and Arthur Davison Ficke, who wrote as &quot;Anne Knish.&quot; The book was intended as satire directed at the Imagism poetry movement.

&quot;Spectra&quot; was preceded by a brief manifesto outlining the Spectric method as a school:

*&quot;In the first place, it speaks, to the mind of that process of diffraction by which are disarticulated the several colored and other rays of which light is composed. . . .&quot;
*&quot;In its second sense, the term Spectric relates to the reflex vibrations of physical sight, and suggests the luminous appearance which is seen after the exposure of the eye to intense light, and, by analogy, the after-colors of the poets initial vision.&quot;
*&quot;In its third sense, Spectric connotes the overtones, adumbrations, or spectres which for the poet haunt all objects of both the seen and unseen world. . . .&quot;

The poems in the collection were identified by opus numbers rather than titles, and mostly take on a silly tone.

From &quot;Opus 6&quot; by Emanuel Morgan:

:&quot;If I were only dafter&quot;
::&quot;I might be making hymns&quot;
:&quot;To the liquor of your laughter&quot;
::&quot;And the lacquer of your limbs.&quot;

Anne Knish&#x27;s Opus 118:

:&quot;If bathing were a virtue, not a lust&quot;
:&quot;I would be dirtiest.&quot;

:&quot;To some, housecleaning is a holy rite.&quot;
:&quot;For myself, houses would be empty&quot;
:&quot;But for the golden motes dancing in sunbeams.&quot;

:&quot;Tax-assessors frequently overlook valuables.&quot;
:&quot;Today they noted my jade.&quot;
:&quot;But my memory of you escaped them.&quot;

&quot;Spectra&quot; was intended solely as a joke. Initially, even the publisher was fooled by the book, but he was let in on the joke before going to press. The authors assumed the ridiculousness of the work would shine through, but it was actually accepted as a legitimate poetic movement for two years. In 1918, Bynner admitted in a public speech that he had co-authored the book and explained the hoax.

Both Bynner and Ficke were accomplished poets of their time, but the &quot;Spectra&quot; poems are probably the most widely remembered of their work. Both authors admitted to the hoax having backfired to a certain extent, as it overshadowed their more serious work. Nonetheless, Ficke stated that he learned a good deal about composition while writing as Knish, adding that it actually influenced his later work.

<text>Iditarod is an abandoned town in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. 
It is presently located within the boundaries of the Flat Census Designated Place, which has no residents as of 2010.

==History==

The town of Iditarod was named after the Iditarod River. &quot;Iditarod&quot; comes from the Athabascan word &quot;Haidilatna&quot;.

On Christmas Day 1908, prospectors John Beaton and W.A. &quot;Bill&quot; Dikeman found gold on Otter Creek, a tributary to the Iditarod River. News of the find spread, and in the summer of 1909 miners arrived in the gold fields and built a small camp that was later known as Flat. People and supplies traveled to the gold fields by boat from the Yukon River, up the Innoko River, and up the Iditarod River to the current town site, a short walk from Flat.

More gold was discovered, and a massive stampede headed for Flat in 1910. The steamboat &quot;Tanana&quot; arrived June 1, 1910, and the city of Iditarod was founded as a head of navigation for all the surrounding gold fields, including Flat, Discovery, Otter, Dikeman, and Willow Creek. Iditarod quickly became a bustling boomtown, with hotels, cafés, brothels, three newspapers (only one would last the year), a Miners and Merchants Bank, a mercantile store, electricity, telephones, automobiles, and a light railway to Flat.

By 1930 the gold was gone and most of the miners had moved to Flat, taking many of the buildings with them. Iditarod is now a ghost town. Only one cabin and a handful of ruins remain, including the concrete bank vault from the Miners and Merchants Bank.

==Demographics==

Iditarod first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census as an incorporated city of just 50 residents, as the boom had already played out. In 1931, it was disincorporated, leaving just a single resident by 1940. It did not report again on the census after that. However, the area was included in the census designated place of Flat beginning in 2000, but with the departure of their remaining residents, the population is now back to zero.

<text>The dombra, also known as dombyra (), () is a long-necked musical string instrument used by the Kazakhs, Hazaras, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Nogais, Bashkirs, and Tatars in their traditional folk music. The dombra shares certain characteristics with the komuz and dutar instruments, such as its long, thin neck and oblong body shape. It is a popular instrument mostly among Turkic communities in Central Asian countries.

==Varieties==
The instrument differs slightly in different regions. The Kazakh dombyra has frets and is played by strumming with the hand or plucking each string individually, with an occasional tap on the main surface of the instrument. While the strings are traditionally made of sinew, modern dombras are usually produced using nylon strings. One of the greatest dombra players was the Kazakh folk musician and composer Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly, who had a major influence on the development of Kazakh musical culture, including music for the dombra; his musical composition &quot;Adai&quot; is popular in Kazakhstan and abroad.

In 2012, the &quot;elektrodombyra&quot; was created.

The Hazara, Turkestani, and Badakhshani , commonly found in Afghanistan, are fretless with a body and neck carved from a single block of wood, usually mulberry or apricot. The is played with much banging and scratching on the instrument to help give a percussive sound. The two strings are made of nylon (in modern times) or gut. They cross a short bridge to a pin at the other end of the body. There is a tiny sound hole in the back of the instrument, while the top is thick wood. It is not finished with any varnish, filing/sanding of any kind, and as with all other Turkic instruments there is some decoration.

A performer strikes all the strings at the same time. The upper string performs the bourdon tone and the lower string performs the melody. A is used as a solo as well as an ensemble instrument.

== History ==
The dombyra first appeared in the Middle Ages. For example, the works of Aby Nasyr Al-Farabi refer to a tambur-like musical instrument similar to the dombyra. An instrument similar to the Dombyra existed in almost every country in Central Asia. Within the last century, there have been many great composers and Dombyra players, such as Kurmangazy, Kazangap, and Tattimbet.

The importance of the dombra in the culture of Kazakhstan was marked by including it in the Intangible Heritage register. In November 2014, &quot;Dombra kuy&quot; was included in was registered as a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage. In 2018, Kazakhstan initiated the Dombra Day. The National Dombra Day is celebrated in Kazakhstan every first Sunday of July.

==Dombra in ensemble and epic performance==

The Kazakh poet Abay Qunanbayuli is often shown holding a dombra at rest and many hold it in high regard as a national symbol among the post-Soviet nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The dombra is played by Erzhan Alimbetov in the Ulytau band.

From the 12th to the 18th century, the was used by Bashkir to accompany their poetic legends and . It is mentioned in the epic poem &quot;Zayatulyak and Hiuhiliu&quot;. However, by the beginning of the 20th century, the was forgotten. The were often the main ideologists of ethnic insurrections, so when the Russian administration put down an uprising, they punished the and destroyed their . In the second half of the 20th century, several reconstructions were carried out. At present, the revivalist work continues. Among others, performer V. Shugayupov works on the revival of the . The modern wooden has a pear-shaped or an oval form.

==References in popular culture==

This instrument has become a part of an Internet phenomenon after a video clip from SuperStar KZ, the Kazakh equivalent of the Idol series, was posted on YouTube. The video includes two contestants singing and a third one singing and playing the dombra (Ernar Kaldynov), which caused the popularity. The name of the original song is Freestailo by R.Lizer, a Kazakh man.

Dombyra as an instrument is being popularized through Dombyra Parties, a flash mob-like movement of Kazakh youth organized via social media. The videos of Dombyra Party activities are shared on YouTube, Facebook etc.

==Range and tablature==
Many folk and regional tunings have existed, though below is the most accepted academic DG tuning for standard concert dombra prima of Kazakhstan.
There are different classifications of Dombyra, for example Dombyra for singing songs or has 8-9 frets, dombyra for kyus has more than 20 frets.

<text>The Royal College of Music (RCM) is a conservatoire established by royal charter in 1882, located in South Kensington, London, UK. It offers training from the undergraduate to the doctoral level in all aspects of Western Music including performance, composition, conducting, music theory and history, and has trained some of the most important figures in international music life. The RCM also conducts research in performance practice and performance science. 

The RCM has over 900 students from more than 50 countries, with professors who include many who are musicians with worldwide reputations. It is currently ranked as the worldwide number-one university for performing arts by the QS World University Rankings.

The college is one of the four conservatories of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music and a member of Conservatoires UK. Its buildings are directly opposite the Royal Albert Hall on Prince Consort Road, next to Imperial College and among the museums and cultural centres of Albertopolis.

==History==

===Background===

The Royal College of Music was founded in 1883 to replace the short-lived and unsuccessful National Training School of Music (NTSM). The idea for the NTSM was initially proposed by the Prince Consort decades before the school opened. Conservatoires to train young students for a musical career had been set up in major European cities, but in London the long-established Royal Academy of Music had not supplied suitable training for professional musicians: in 1870 it was estimated that fewer than ten per cent of instrumentalists in London orchestras had studied at the academy. 

The NTSM opened in 1876, with Arthur Sullivan as its principal. Under Sullivan, a reluctant and ineffectual principal, the NTSM failed to provide a satisfactory alternative to the Royal Academy and, by 1880, a committee of examiners comprising Charles Hallé, Sir Julius Benedict, Sir Michael Costa, Henry Leslie and Otto Goldschmidt reported that the school lacked &quot;executive cohesion&quot;. The following year Sullivan resigned and was replaced by John Stainer. The original plan was to merge the Royal Academy of Music and the National Training School of Music into a single, enhanced organisation. The NTSM agreed, but after prolonged negotiations, the Royal Academy refused to enter into the proposed scheme.

In 1881, with George Grove as a leading instigator and with the support of the Prince of Wales, a draft charter was drawn up for a successor body to the NTSM. The Royal College of Music occupied the premises previously home to the NTSM and opened there on 7 May 1883. Grove was appointed its first director. There were 50 scholars elected by competition and 42 fee-paying students.

===Early years===
Grove, a close friend of Sullivan, loyally maintained that the new college was a natural evolution from the NTSM. In reality, his aims were radically different from Sullivan&#x27;s. In his determination that the new institution should succeed as a training ground for orchestral players, Grove had two principal allies: the violinist Henry Holmes and the composer and conductor Charles Villiers Stanford. They believed that a capable college orchestra would not only benefit instrumental students, but would give students of composition the essential chance to experience the sound of their music. The college&#x27;s first intake of scholarship students included 28 who studied an orchestral instrument. The potential strength of the college orchestra, including fee-paying instrumental students, was 33 violins, five violas, six cellos, one double bass, one flute, one oboe and two horns. Grove appointed 12 professors of orchestral instruments, in addition to distinguished teachers in other musical disciplines including Jenny Lind (singing), Hubert Parry (composition), Ernst Pauer (piano), Arabella Goddard (piano) and Walter Parratt (organ).

The old premises proved restrictive and a new building was commissioned in the early 1890s on a new site in Prince Consort Road, South Kensington. The building was designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield in Flemish Mannerist style in red brick dressed with buff-coloured Welden stone. Construction began in 1892 and the building opened in May 1894. The building was largely paid for by two large donations from Samson Fox, a Yorkshire industrialist, whose statue, along with that of the Prince of Wales, stands in the entrance hall.

Grove retired at the end of 1894 and was succeeded as director by Hubert Parry.

===Later history===
Parry died in 1918 and was succeeded as director by Sir Hugh Allen (1919–37), Sir George Dyson (1938–52), Sir Ernest Bullock (1953–59), Sir Keith Falkner (1960–74), Sir David Willcocks (1974–84), Michael Gough Matthews(1985–93), Dame Janet Ritterman (1993–2005) and Professor Colin Lawson (2005-2024). The College&#x27;s current Director is James Williams, whose tenure began in September 2024.

The College&#x27;s teaching professoriate numbers over 200 musicians, including internationally known figures like Dmitri Alexeev, Martyn Brabbins, Natalie Clein, Danny Driver, Martin Gatt, Chen Jiafeng, Jakob Lindberg, Mike Lovatt, Patricia Rozario, Brindley Sherratt, Ashley Solomon, Mark-Anthony Turnage, Maxim Vengerov, Roger Vignoles, Raphael Wallfisch and Errollyn Wallen as well as principals of the major London orchestras including the London Symphony, BBC Symphony, London Philharmonic and the Philharmonia.

Since its founding in 1882, the college has been linked with the British royal family and its Patron is His Majesty King Charles III. For 40 years Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother was president; in 1993 Charles III (then Prince of Wales) became president.

Opened in 2016, the Royal College of Music’s hall of residence, Prince Consort Village, provides accommodation for more than 400 students and with acoustically treated bedrooms and dedicated practise rooms. 

The college is a registered charity under English law.

==Curriculum==
The college teaches all aspects of Western classical music from undergraduate to doctoral level. There is a junior department, where 300 children aged 8 to 18 are educated on Saturdays.

==Partnership==
Since August 2011, RCM has been collaborating with Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Singapore, and now offers both undergraduate and taught postgraduate degree programmes, jointly conferred by both institutions.

==Performance venues==
The RCM has a wide variety of concert venues including the Amaryllis Fleming Concert Hall, a 468-seat barrel-vaulted concert hall designed by Blomfield, built in 1901 and extensively restored in 2008–09. The Britten Theatre seats 400, and was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986 and is used for opera, ballet, music and theatre. There is also a 150-seat recital hall dating from 1965, as well as several smaller recital rooms, including three organ-equipped Parry Rooms.

A £40 million development was completed in 2021 and the estate’s footprint was almost doubled. This included the creation of two new performance spaces: the Performance Hall which seats 140 people, and the Performance Studio which was enhanced in 2023 following a £1.89 million investment from the Arts and Humanities Research Council to incorporate state-of-the-art acoustic and visual performance simulation technologies.

== Royal College of Music Collections==

The Royal College of Music Museum houses over 14,000 items, representing a range of music-making activities over a period of more than five centuries. Amongst instruments housed in the museum is a clavicytherium, thought to be the world&#x27;s oldest surviving keyboard instrument, and the earliest known guitar. Following a £3.6 million investment from Heritage Lottery Fund, the Museum underwent a major redevelopment in 2020–21.

Owing partly to the vision of its founders, particularly Grove, the RCM now holds significant Collection Materials, dating from the fifteenth century onwards. These include autograph manuscripts such as Anne Boleyn&#x27;s Music Book, Chopin&#x27;s Minute Waltz, Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto, Haydn&#x27;s String Quartet No. 48 Op. 64/1 and Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 24 in C Minor K491. More extensive collections feature the music of Herbert Howells and Frank Bridge and film scores by Stanley Myers. Among more than 300 original portraits are John Cawse&#x27;s 1826 painting of Weber (the last of the composer), Haydn by Thomas Hardy (1791) and Bartolommeo Nazari&#x27;s painting of Farinelli at the height of his fame. A recent addition to the collection is a portrait of the Russian composer Alfred Schnittke by Reginald Gray. 10,000 prints and photographs constitute the most substantial archive of images of musicians in the UK. The RCM&#x27;s 600,000 concert programmes document concert life from 1730 to the present day. There are also more than 800 musical instruments and accessories from circa 1480 to the present.

==Alumni ==
Since opening in 1882, the college has had a distinguished list of teachers and alumni, including most of the composers who brought about the &quot;English Musical Renaissance&quot; of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Students in the time of Stanford and Parry included Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and John Ireland. Later alumni include Louise Alder, Sir Thomas Allen, Stanley Bate, Benjamin Britten, Dame Sarah Connolly, Colin Davis, Sir James Galway, Peggy Glanville-Hicks, Gwyneth Jones, Rowland Lee, Neville Marriner, Anna Meredith, Hugh McLean, Tarik O&#x27;Regan, Gervase de Peyer, Trevor Pinnock, Anna Russell, Dame Joan Sutherland, Mark-Anthony Turnage, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Julian Lloyd Webber, James Horner, Sir Reginald Thatcher, Michael Tippett and the guitarist John Williams.

<text>Max Erik Tegmark (born 5 May 1967) is a Swedish-American physicist, machine learning researcher and author. He is best known for his book &quot;Life 3.0&quot; about what the world might look like as artificial intelligence continues to improve. Tegmark is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the president of the Future of Life Institute.

==Early life==
Tegmark was born in Sweden to Karin Tegmark and American-born professor of mathematics Harold S. Shapiro. While in high school, he and a friend created and sold a word processor written in pure machine code for the Swedish eight-bit computer ABC 80, and a 3D Tetris-like game called Frac.

Tegmark left Sweden in 1990 after receiving his M.S.E in engineering physics from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology and a B.A. in economics the previous year at the Stockholm School of Economics. His first academic venture beyond Scandinavia brought him to California, where he studied physics at the University of California, Berkeley, earning his M.A. in 1992, and Ph.D. in 1994 under the supervision of Joseph Silk.

Tegmark was an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving tenure in 2003. In 2004, he joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s department of physics.

==Career==
His research focuses on machine learning after an earlier phase focused on cosmology, combining theoretical work with new measurements to place constraints on cosmological models and their free parameters, often in collaboration with experimentalists. He has over 300 publications, of which nine have been cited over 500 times. He has developed data analysis tools based on information theory and applied them to cosmic microwave background experiments such as COBE, QMAP, and WMAP, and to galaxy redshift surveys such as the Las Campanas Redshift Survey, the 2dF Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

With Daniel Eisenstein and Wayne Hu, he introduced the idea of using baryon acoustic oscillations as a standard ruler. With Angelica de Oliveira-Costa and Andrew Hamilton, he discovered the anomalous multipole alignment in the WMAP data sometimes referred to as the &quot;axis of evil&quot;. With Anthony Aguirre, he developed the cosmological interpretation of quantum mechanics. His 2000 paper on quantum decoherence of neurons
concluded that decoherence seems too rapid for Roger Penrose&#x27;s &quot;quantum microtubule&quot; model of consciousness to be viable.

Tegmark has also formulated the &quot;mathematical universe hypothesis&quot;, whose only postulate is that &quot;all structures that exist mathematically exist also physically&quot;. In 2014, Tegmark published the book &quot;Our Mathematical Universe&quot;, which presents his idea at greater length. Tegmark suggests that the theory is simple in having no free parameters at all, and that in those structures complex enough to contain self-aware substructures (SASs), these SASs will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically &quot;real&quot; world. The &quot;mathematical universe&quot; hypothesis has been criticized by some other scientists as being both overly speculative and unscientific in nature. For example, mathematical physicist Edward Frenkel characterized it as closer to &quot;science fiction and mysticism&quot; than &quot;the realm of science.&quot;

Tegmark was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2012 for, according to the citation, &quot;his contributions to cosmology, including precision measurements from cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering data, tests of inflation and gravitation theories, and the development of a new technology for low-frequency radio interferometry&quot;.

He was awarded the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Science&#x27;s Gold Medal in 2019 for, according to the citation, &quot;his contributions to our understanding of humanity’s place in the cosmos and the opportunities and risks associated with artificial intelligence. He has courageously tackled these existential questions in his research and, in a commendable way, succeeded in communicating the issues to a wider public.&quot;

Tegmark is interviewed in the 2018 documentary on artificial intelligence &quot;Do You Trust This Computer?&quot; From 2020 onward, Tegmark led a research team-turned-nonprofit at MIT that developed an AI-driven news aggregator known as &quot;Improving the News&quot;. &quot;Improve the News&quot; was rebranded to &quot;Verity News&quot; in 2023. 

==Personal life==
He married astrophysicist Angelica de Oliveira-Costa in 1997, and divorced in 2009. They have two sons. On August 5, 2012, Tegmark married Meia Chita.

==In the media==
* In 2006, Tegmark was one of fifty scientists interviewed by &quot;New Scientist&quot; about their predictions for the future. His prediction: &quot;In 50 years, you may be able to buy T-shirts on which are printed equations describing the unified laws of our universes.&quot;
* Tegmark appears in the 2007 documentary &quot;Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives&quot; in which he is interviewed by Mark Oliver Everett, son of the founder of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, Hugh Everett.
* Tegmark also appears in &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of a Big Black Hole?&quot;, &quot;What Time is It?&quot;, &quot;To Infinity and Beyond&quot;, &quot;Is Everything We Know About The Universe Wrong?&quot;, &quot;What is Reality?&quot; and &quot;Which Universe Are We In?&quot;, all part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Horizon&quot; scientific series of programmes.
* He appears in several episodes of &quot;Sci Fi Science: Physics of the Impossible&quot;, an American documentary television series on science which first aired in the United States on December 1, 2009. The series is hosted by theoretical physicist Michio Kaku.
* Tegmark was interviewed by Morgan Freeman in seasons 2 and 3 of &quot;Through the Wormhole&quot; in 2011–2012.
* Tegmark participated in the episode &quot;Zooming Out&quot; of BBC World Service&#x27;s &quot;The Forum&quot;, which first aired on BBC Radio 4 on 26 April 2014.
* In 2014, Tegmark co-authored an op-ed in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; with Stephen Hawking, Frank Wilczek and Stuart Russell on the movie &quot;Transcendence&quot;.
* In 2014, &quot;The Perpetual Earth Program,&quot; a play based on Tegmark&#x27;s book &quot;Our Mathematical Universe&quot;, was mounted in New York City as part of the Planet Connections Theatre Festival.
* In 2014, he featured in &quot;The Principle&quot;, a documentary examining the Copernican Principle.
* In 2015, Tegmark participated in an episode of Sam Harris&#x27; the Waking Up podcast entitled &quot;The Multiverse &amp; You (&amp; You &amp; You &amp; You...)&quot; where they discussed topics such as artificial intelligence and the mathematical universe hypothesis.
* In 2017, Tegmark gave a talk entitled &quot;Effective altruism, existential risk &amp; existential hope&quot; at the world&#x27;s largest annual conference of the effective altruism movement.
* In 2017, Tegmark participated in an episode of Sam Harris&#x27; the Waking Up podcast entitled &quot;The Future of Intelligence&quot; where they discussed topics such as artificial intelligence and definitions of life.
* In 2018, Tegmark took part in a conversation with AI researcher Lex Fridman about Artificial General Intelligence as part of a MIT course on AGI. He was the first guest on the Lex Fridman podcast. He was interviewed again on the Lex Fridman podcast in 2021 and in 2023.
* In 2023, Tegmark drew controversy in the media when reports surfaced that he had signed off on behalf of the Future of Life Institute on a $100,000 grant to far-right media outlet Nya Dagbladet. He later said that the Future of Life Institute &quot;ultimately decided to reject it because of what our subsequent due diligence uncovered&quot;, that they rejected it long before the media became involved, and that the institute &quot;finds Nazi, neo-Nazi or pro-Nazi groups or ideologies despicable and would never knowingly support them&quot;. An official statement from the Future of Life Institute further expands on this: &quot;FLI finds groups or ideologies espousing antisemitism, white supremacy, or racism despicable and would never knowingly support any such group&quot;.
* In 2023, &quot;Time&quot; named Tegmark one of the 100 most influential people in AI.

<doc id="175507" wikidata="Q561323" url="?curid=175507" title="Emergency Alert System">
<text>The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is a national warning system in the United States designed to allow authorized officials to broadcast emergency alerts and warning messages to the public via cable, satellite and broadcast television and AM, FM and satellite radio. Informally, &quot;Emergency Alert System&quot; is sometimes conflated with its mobile phone counterpart Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), a different but related system. However, both the EAS and WEA, among other systems, are coordinated under the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS). The EAS, and more broadly IPAWS, allows federal, state, and local authorities to efficiently broadcast emergency alert and warning messages across multiple channels. The EAS became operational on January 1, 1997, after being approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in November 1994, replacing the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS), and largely supplanted Local Access Alert systems, though Local Access Alert systems are still used from time to time. Its main improvement over the EBS, and perhaps its most distinctive feature, is its application of a digitally encoded audio signal known as Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME), which is responsible for the characteristic &quot;screeching&quot; or &quot;chirping&quot; sounds at the start and end of each message. The first signal is the &quot;header&quot; which encodes, among other information, the alert type and locations, or the &quot;specific area&quot; that should receive the message. The last short burst marks the end-of-message. These signals are read by specialized encoder-decoder equipment. This design allows for automated station-to-station relay of alerts to only the area the alert was intended for.

Like the Emergency Broadcast System, the system is primarily designed to allow the president of the United States to address the country via all radio and television stations in the event of a national emergency. Despite this, neither the system nor its predecessors have been used in this manner. The ubiquity of news coverage in these situations, such as during the September 11 attacks, has been credited to making usage of the system unnecessary or redundant. In practice, it is used at a regional scale to distribute information regarding imminent threats to public safety, such as severe weather situations (including flash floods and tornadoes), AMBER Alerts, and other civil emergencies.

It is jointly coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The EAS regulations and standards are governed by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau of the FCC. All broadcast television, broadcast and satellite radio stations, as well as multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), are required to participate in the system.

==Technical concept==

Messages in the EAS are composed of four parts: a digitally encoded Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) header, an attention signal, an audio announcement, and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker.
The is the most critical part of the EAS design. It contains information about who originated the alert (the president, state or local authorities, the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS), or the broadcaster), a short, general description of the event (tornado, flood, severe thunderstorm), the areas affected (up to 32 counties or states), the expected duration of the event (in minutes), the date and time it was issued (in UTC), and an identification of the originating station.

There are 79 radio stations designated as National Primary Stations in the Primary Entry Point (PEP) System to distribute presidential messages to other broadcast stations and cable systems.

The National Emergency Message (formerly known as the Emergency Action Notification) is the notice to broadcasters that the president of the United States or their designee will deliver a message over the EAS via the PEP system. The government has stated that the system would allow a president to speak during a national emergency within 10 minutes.

===Primary Entry Point stations===
The National Public Warning System, also known as the Primary Entry Point (PEP) stations, is a network of 77 radio stations that are, in coordination with FEMA, used to originate emergency alert and warning information to the public before, during, and after incidents and disasters. PEP stations are equipped with additional and backup communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event.

Beginning with WJR Detroit and WLW Cincinnati in 2016, FEMA began the process of constructing transportable studio shelters at the transmitters of 33 PEP stations, which feature broadcasting equipment, emergency provisions, a rest area, and an air filtration system. NPWS project manager Manny Centeno explained that these shelters were designed to &quot;[expand] the survivability of these stations to include an all hazards platform, which means chemical, biological, radiological air protection and protection from electromagnetic pulse.&quot;

===Communication links===
The FEMA National Radio System (FNARS) &quot;Provides Primary Entry Point service to the Emergency Alert System&quot;, and acts as an emergency presidential link into the EAS. The FNARS net control station is located at the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center.

Once an EAN is received by an EAS participant from a PEP station (or any other participant) the message then &quot;daisy chains through the network of participants. &quot;Daisy chains&quot; form when one station receives a message from multiple other stations and the station then forwards that message to multiple other stations. This process creates many redundant paths through which the message may flow increasing the likelihood that the message will be received by all participants and adding to the survivability of the system. Each EAS participant is required to monitor at least two other participants.

===EAS header===
Because the header lacks error detection codes, it is repeated three times for redundancy. EAS decoders compare the received headers against one another, looking for an exact match between any two, eliminating most errors which can cause an activation to fail. The decoder then decides whether to ignore the message or to relay it on the air if the message applies to the local area served by the station (following parameters set by the broadcaster).

The SAME header bursts are followed by an EAS attention tone, which lasts between 8 and 25 seconds, depending on the originating station. The tone is on a NOAA Weather Radio station. On commercial broadcast stations, a attention signal of 853 Hz and 960 Hz sine waves is used instead, the same signal used by the older Emergency Broadcast System. These tones have become infamous, and can be considered both frightening and annoying by listeners; in fact, the two tones, which form approximately the interval of a just major second at an unusually high pitch, were chosen specifically for their ability to draw attention, due to their unpleasantness on the human ear. The SAME header is equally known for its shrillness, which many have found to be startling. The &quot;two-tone&quot; system is no longer required as of 1998, and is to be used only for audio alerts before EAS messages. Like the EBS, the attention signal is followed by a voice message describing the details of the alert.

The message ends with 3 bursts of the AFSK &quot;EOM&quot;, or End of Message, which is the text codice_1, preceded each time by the binary 10101011 calibration.

=== IPAWS ===

Under a 2006 executive order issued by George W. Bush, the U.S. government was instructed to create &quot;an effective, reliable, integrated, flexible, and comprehensive&quot; public warning system. This was accomplished via expansions to the aforementioned PEP network, and the development of the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS)—a national aggregator and distributor of alert information using the XML-based Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) and an internet network. IPAWS can be used to distribute alert information to EAS participants, supported mobile phones (Wireless Emergency Alerts), and other platforms. IPAWS also allows the audio portion of an EAS message to utilize higher quality digital audio, rather than needing to carry the audio off-air from the originating station.

Under an FCC report and order issued in 2007, EAS participants would be required to migrate to digital equipment supporting CAP within 180 days of the specification&#x27;s adoption by FEMA. This was originally scheduled for September 30, 2010, but the deadline was later delayed to June 30, 2012 at the request of broadcasters.

The FCC has established that IPAWS is not a full substitute for the SAME protocol, as it is vulnerable to situations that may make internet connectivity unavailable. Therefore, as a backup distribution path, broadcasters must also convert CAP messages to SAME headers to enable backwards compatibility with the existing &quot;daisy chain&quot; method of EAS distribution.

In December 2021, the FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking to prioritize the display of alert audio and text from CAP messages, in order to provide higher quality alert audio, improve parity between the visual display and audio for the benefit of the hearing impaired, and to reduce the amount of technical jargon contained within the visual display. The rules were enacted in September 2022, with a deadline of December 12, 2023, for compliance; the FCC later granted an extension to some broadcasters due to a delay in the release of associated software updates by EAS decoder vendor Sage.

==Station requirements==
The FCC requires all broadcast stations and multichannel video programming distributors (MVPD), hereafter &quot;EAS participants&quot;, to install and maintain FCC-certified EAS decoders and encoders at their control points or headends. These decoders continuously monitor the signals from other nearby broadcast stations for EAS messages. For reliability, at least two source stations must be monitored, one of which must be a designated &quot;local primary&quot;. Participants are to retain the latest version of the EAS handbook.

EAS participants are required by federal law to relay National Emergency Messages (EAN, formerly Emergency Action Notification) immediately (47 CFR Part 11.54). Broadcasters traditionally have been allowed to opt out of relaying other alerts such as severe weather, and child abduction emergencies (AMBER Alerts) if they so choose. In practice, television stations with local news departments will usually interrupt regularly-scheduled programming during newsworthy situations (such as severe weather) to provide extended coverage.

If possible, EAS participants must transmit the audio, and (where applicable) a visual display containing the extended text, from the associated CAP message. 

EAS participants are required to keep logs of all received messages. Logs may be kept by hand but are usually kept automatically by a small receipt printer in the encoder/decoder unit. Logs may also be kept electronically inside the unit as long as there is access to an external printer or method to transfer them to a computer.
==System tests==

All EAS equipment must be tested on a weekly basis. The required weekly test (RWT) consists, at a minimum, of the header and end-of-message tones. Though an RWT does not need an audio or graphic message announcing the test, many stations provide them as a courtesy to the public. In addition, television stations are not required to transmit a video message for weekly tests. RWTs are scheduled by the station on random days and times, (though quite often during late night or early afternoon hours), and are generally not relayed.
Required monthly tests (RMTs) are generally originated by the local or state primary station, a state emergency management agency, or by the National Weather Service and are then relayed by broadcast stations and cable channels. RMTs must be performed between 8:30 a.m. and local sunset during odd numbered months, and between local sunset and 8:30 a.m. during even numbered months. Received monthly tests must be retransmitted within 60 minutes of receipt. Additionally, an RMT should not be scheduled or conducted during an event of great importance such as a pre-announced presidential speech, coverage of a national/local election, major local or national news coverage outside regularly scheduled newscast hours or a major national sporting event such as the Super Bowl or World Series, with other events such as the Indianapolis 500 and Olympic Games mentioned in individual EAS state plans.

An RWT is not required during a calendar week in which an RMT is scheduled. No testing has to be done during a calendar week in which all parts of the EAS (header burst, attention signal, audio message, and end of message burst) have been legitimately activated.

In July 2018, in response to the aftermath of the false missile alert in Hawaii earlier in the year (which was caused by operator error during an internal drill protocol), the FCC announced that it would take steps to promote public awareness and improve efficiency of the system, including requiring safeguards to prevent distribution of false alarms, the ability to authorize &quot;live code&quot; tests—which would simulate the process and response to an actual emergency, and authorizations to use the EAS tones in public service announcements that promote awareness of the system.

===Nationwide tests===
On February 3, 2011, the FCC announced plans and procedures for national EAS tests, which involve all television and radio stations connected to the EAS, as well as all cable and satellite services in the United States. They are not relayed on the NOAA Weather Radio (NOAA/NWS) network as it is an initiation-only network and does not receive messages from the PEP network. The national test would transmit and relay an Emergency Action Notification on November 9, 2011 at 2:00 p.m. EST.

The Federal Communications Commission found that only half of the participants received the message via Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, and some &quot;failed to receive or retransmit alerts due to erroneous equipment configuration, equipment readiness and upkeep issues, and confusion regarding EAS rules and technical requirements&quot;, and that participation among low-power broadcasters was low. Many reported visuals or audio missing, and in the case of DirecTV, hearing Lady Gaga music instead. To reduce viewer confusion, the FCC stated that future national tests would be delivered under the new event code &quot;National Periodic Test&quot; (&quot;NPT&quot;), and list &quot;United States&quot; as its location. 

A second national test, the first classified as an NPT, occurred on September 28, 2016 as part of National Preparedness Month. A third national periodic test occurred on September 27, 2017.

The fourth NPT occurred on October 3, 2018 (delayed from September 20, 2018, due to Hurricane Florence). It was preceded by the first mandatory wireless emergency alert test.

The fifth NPT occurred on August 7, 2019, and moved up from past years to prevent it from occurring during the heart of the Atlantic hurricane season. The test focused exclusively on distribution to broadcast outlets and television providers via the primary entry point network to gauge the efficiency of alert distribution in the event the internet cannot be used.

The sixth NPT was postponed to 2021 amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic &quot;out of consideration for the unusual circumstances and working conditions for those in the broadcast and cable industry.&quot;
The sixth test occurred on August 11, 2021, at 2:20 pm EDT. This test involved the WEA system alongside television and radio.

As of 2022, as part of a clarification and streamlining of terminology used in messages, further NPTs will now be referred to in the test message as a &quot;Nationwide Test of the Emergency Alert System&quot; issued by the United States Government. On May 3, 2022, it was announced that the seventh NPT would not take place during 2022, and instead occur in early 2023.

On August 3, 2023, FEMA and the FCC announced that the seventh NPT would occur October 4, 2023 with a backup date of October 11, 2023. The test commenced just before 2:20 pm ET, and consisted of an alert on TV/radio as well as a WEA on all cell phones.

==Additions and proposals==

The number of event types in the national system has grown to eighty. At first, all but three of the events (civil emergency message, immediate evacuation, and emergency action notification [national emergency]) were weather-related (such as a tornado warning). Since then, several classes of non-weather emergencies have been added, including, in most states, the AMBER Alert System for child abduction emergencies. In 2016, three additional weather alert codes were authorized for use in relation to hurricane events, including Extreme Wind Warning (EWW), Storm Surge Warning (SSW) and Storm Surge Watch (SSA).

In 2004, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) seeking comment on whether EAS in its present form is the most effective mechanism for warning the American public of an emergency and, if not, on how EAS can be improved, such as mandatory text messages to cellphones, regardless of subscription. As noted above, rules implemented by the FCC on July 12, 2007 provisionally endorse incorporating CAP with the SAME protocol.

In November 2020, Congress passed the Reliable Emergency Alert Distribution Improvement (READI) Act. First sponsored by Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz in response to the Hawaii false missile alert, it amends the Warning, Alert, and Response Network (WARN) Act to require distribution of wireless alerts issued by the administrator of FEMA, and commands the FCC to establish a means of reporting false alerts, encourage the establishment of State Emergency Communications Committees (SECC) that would meet annually to evaluate their EAS plans, require the repetition of alerts surrounding &quot;emergencies of national significance&quot;, and open an inquiry into the feasibility of implementing the EAS on internet-related services.

==Limitations==
The EAS can only be used to relay audio messages that preempt all programming; as the intent of an Emergency Action Notification is to serve as a &quot;last-ditch effort to get a message out if the president cannot get to the media&quot;, it can easily be made redundant by the immediate and constant coverage that major weather events and other newsworthy situations—such as, most prominently, the September 11 attacks in 2001—receive from television broadcasters and news channels. Following the attacks, then-FCC chairman Michael K. Powell cited &quot;the ubiquitous media environment&quot; as justification for not using the EAS in their immediate aftermath. Glenn Collins of &quot;The New York Times&quot; acknowledged these limitations, noting that &quot;no president has ever used the current [EAS] system or its technical predecessors in the last 50 years, despite the Soviet missile crisis, a presidential assassination, the Oklahoma City bombing, major earthquakes and three recent high-alert terrorist warnings&quot;, and that using it would have actually hindered the availability of live coverage from media outlets.

Following the tornado outbreak of March 3, 2019, Birmingham, Alabama NWS meteorologist Kevin Laws told CNN that he, personally, wished that alerts could be updated in real-time in order to reflect the unpredictable nature of weather events, noting that the storm system&#x27;s unexpected change in trajectory towards Lee County resulted in only a nine-minute warning (the resulting tornado would kill 23 people).

The trend of cord cutting has led to concerns that viewers&#x27; lessened use of broadcast media in favor of streaming video services would inhibit their ability to receive emergency information (notwithstanding availability of alerts on mobile phones). The READI Act called for an inquiry into the distribution of alerts via internet platforms.

==Incidents==
=== False alarms ===
* On February 20th, 1971, an Emergency Action Notification (now National Emergency Message) was accidentally sent out because the wrong message was played. This originally was supposed to be a simple test of the then-used Emergency Broadcast System. They announced that this was a false alarm. The amount of stations affected is not entirely known, however recordings of WOWO-AM and WCCO-AM activating the EAN are available to be listened to online. The WOWO recording features the station playing standby music while they try to get more information, which would waste valuable time during an actual emergency, while in the WCCO recording, the station immediately realized the wrong tape had been played, and listeners were told to disregard; the recording also contains the usage of the terms &quot;CONELRAD Advisory&quot; (CONELRAD being the Emergency Broadcast System&#x27;s predecessor), and &quot;Emergency Alert System&quot; (the term being used erroneously, as the actual EAS was still 26 years away).
* On April 21, 1997, several television and radio stations in Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, and Ohio mistakenly received a false Emergency Action Notification. Early indications pointed to a human error at the National Emergency Coordination Center in Virginia that routed a test requested by a relay for the Chicago Metropolitan Area to test out one radio station&#x27;s then-new EAS equipment as part of the EBS/EAS transition. 
* On February 1, 2005 in Connecticut, an alert was mistakenly issued calling for the immediate evacuation of the entire state. The alert contained no specific detail on why it had been issued. The message was broadcast due to operator error while conducting an unannounced, but scheduled statewide test. A study conducted following the incident reported that at least 11% of residents actually saw the warning live, and that 63% of those surveyed were &quot;a little or not at all concerned&quot;—citing a suspicious lack of detail in the message, which a legitimate alert would include. Only 1% of those surveyed actually attempted to leave the state. Connecticut State Police did not receive any calls related to the incident.
* On June 26, 2007 at 7:35 a.m. CDT, an Emergency Action Notification was accidentally issued in Illinois, when a new satellite receiver at the state&#x27;s EOC was accidentally connected to a live system before final internal testing of the new delivery path had been completed. The alert was followed by dead air, and then audio from designated station 720 WGN in Chicago being simulcast across almost every television and radio station in the Chicago area and throughout much of Illinois. A confused Spike O&#x27;Dell, host of the station&#x27;s morning show at the time, was heard on-air wondering &quot;what that beeping was all about&quot;.
* On May 19, 2010, NOAA Weather Radio and CSEPP tone alert radios in the Hermiston, Oregon area, near the Umatilla Chemical Depot, were activated with an EAS alert shortly after 5 p.m. The message transmitted was for a severe thunderstorm warning, issued by the National Weather Service in Pendleton, but the transmission broadcast instead was a long period of silence, followed by a few words in Spanish. Umatilla County Emergency Management has stressed there was no emergency at the depot.
* On September 3, 2016, in the wake of Tropical Storm Hermine, an alert was displayed on television calling for the immediate evacuation of the entirety of Suffolk County, abruptly ending with the incomplete sentence &quot;This is an emergency message from&quot;. About 15 minutes after the original message was sent, the alert was re-issued with an addendum clarifying that the alert was actually calling for a voluntary evacuation of Fire Island—a barrier island of Long Island. Officials cited an error in the county&#x27;s Code Red system; while the correct message was entered into the system, an error processing an abbreviated message for television resulted in the error.
* On May 23, 2017, at around 8:55 p.m. EDT, a Nuclear Power Plant Warning was issued for the Hope Creek and Salem Nuclear Power Plants. The alert was issued for Salem and Cumberland counties in New Jersey. In a statement by the New Jersey State Police, it was a test message, intended for a small group of emergency management personnel who were participating in the test. Due to a coding error, the message was publicly broadcast. This would happen again, in July 2022.
* On August 15, 2017 at approximately 12:25 a.m. ChST, Guam stations KTWG and KSTO transmitted a civil danger warning for the island; Guam Homeland Security described the message, which interrupted programming on the stations, and was received on television by some viewers, as being an &quot;unauthorized test&quot; of the EAS. The incident&#x27;s impact was strengthened, as North Korea had threatened the launch of ballistic missiles towards Guam only a few days beforehand. Numerous calls to 911 operators and the Department of Homeland Security were made following the broadcast.

* On January 13, 2018 at approximately 8:07 a.m. HST, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA) mistakenly issued an emergency alert warning of a ballistic missile inbound threatening the region, which was claimed to be not a drill. 38 minutes later, it was announced by HI-EMA and the Honolulu Police Department that the alert was a false alarm. The incident came amidst heightened concern over the possibility that Hawaii could be targeted by North Korean missiles (in December 2017, Hawaii tested its missile sirens for the first time since the Cold War). HI-EMA administrator Vern Miyagi stated that the incident was a &quot;mistake made during a standard procedure at the change over of a shift&quot;.
* On August 31, 2022, amid wildfires, an immediate evacuation notice was mistakenly issued by the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management for Los Angeles, the Eastern North Pacific Ocean, and Port Conception to Guadalupe; the alert text repeatedly listed &quot;Eastern North Pacific Ocean&quot; or &quot;Eastern North Pacific&quot; twelve different times. The Ventura County Sheriff&#x27;s Office stated that the alert had been issued in error.

=== Cybersecurity breaches ===
EAS equipment has been the subject of various cyberattacks, caused primarily by participants using insecure or factory default passwords on their encoders and decoders, and outdated software containing unpatched vulnerabilities. On multiple occasions, federal government departments have warned that failure to employ secure passwords and keep software updated made EAS equipment vulnerable to such attacks, which could result in disruptions such as false alerts.

* In February 2013, the EAS equipment of several stations in Great Falls, Montana and Marquette, Michigan were breached to play a false alert allegedly warning of a zombie apocalypse, using the lines &quot;Civil authorities in your area have reported that the bodies of the dead are rising from the graves and attacking the living&quot;. It was identified that the attack had come from an &quot;overseas&quot; source. Furthermore, the broadcasters had neglected to change the factory default logins or passwords on their equipment. Because of this, the FCC, FEMA, equipment manufacturers, as well as trade groups, including the Michigan Association of Broadcasters, urged broadcasters to change their passwords and to recheck their security measures.
** In a related incident, WIZM-FM in La Crosse, Wisconsin accidentally triggered the EAS on television station WKBT-DT by airing a recording of the false message during its morning show. The relayed audio included the hosts&#x27; reactions and laughter to the clip.
* On February 28, 2017, WZZY in Winchester, Indiana was hijacked in a nearly identical manner, playing the same &quot;dead bodies&quot; audio from the February 2013 incidents. The incident prompted a public response from the Randolph County Sheriff&#x27;s Department clarifying that there was no actual emergency.
* In January 2020, &quot;Security Ledger&quot; published an investigation finding that at least 50 EAS decoders by Digital Alert Systems had not been patched for a security vulnerability (use of a shared SSH key) found by IOActive in 2013.
* On February 20, 2020, the EAS equipment of Washington-based provider Wave Broadband was hijacked, causing approximately 3,000 customers in Jefferson County to receive several false alerts (including a &quot;Radiological Hazard Warning&quot;), which contained irrelevant and comedic messages (including one suggesting that the provider change its passwords) and alert audio referencing internet memes and Twitch streamer Vinesauce (who was unaffiliated with this breach). On March 2 and 3, 2020, a legitimate Required Monthly Test was displayed with a message (&quot;AIGHT IM DONE U CAN REST NOW. MR GERDE WAS HERE&quot;) that had also appeared in the hijack: a company official stated that this was a remnant of the attack that had not yet been removed.

=== Tone usage outside of alerts ===
To protect the integrity of the system, and prevent false activations, the FCC prohibits the use of actual or simulated EAS/WEA tones and attention signals outside of genuine alerts, tests, or authorized public service announcements, especially when they are used &quot;to capture audience attention during advertisements; dramatic, entertainment, and educational programs&quot; (even if the footage is documentation of an event where an actual alert was issued). Broadcasters who misuse the tones may be sanctioned (including being required to partake in compliance measures) and fined. 
* Tones from the EAS were used in the trailer for the 2013 film &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot;; cable providers were fined $1.9 million by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on March 3, 2014 for misuse of EAS tones. An event similar to this previously occurred in November 2013, when TBS was fined $25,000 for the use of EAS tones in a &quot;Conan&quot; advertisement.
* During the October 24, 2014 episode of the syndicated radio show &quot;The Bobby Bones Show&quot;, host Bobby Bones played audio from the 2011 national test as part of a rant about a genuine test from Nashville&#x27;s Fox affiliate, WZTV, that interrupted Game 2 of the 2014 World Series on October 22. The errant Emergency Action Notification was relayed to some broadcasters and cable systems—particularly those not configured to reject EAN messages that did not match the current date. On May 19, 2015, iHeartMedia, who distributes the show and owns its flagship station WSIX-FM, was fined $1 million for the incident. The company was also ordered to implement a three-year compliance plan to avoid any further incidents, including removing all EAS tones or similar-sounding noises from its audio production libraries. 
* From August 4 to 6, 2016, Tegna, Inc.-owned NBC affiliate WTLV in Jacksonville, Florida aired an ad several times during NBC&#x27;s primetime coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics produced by the marketing department of the National Football League&#x27;s Jacksonville Jaguars featuring out-of-sequence EAS tones over Jaguars training camp footage and a voiceover noting &quot;this is not a test, this is an emergency broadcast transmission...seek shelter immediately&quot;, along with the on-screen text &quot;the storm is coming&quot;. The ad aired four times before station compliance authorities pulled the advertisement after the local news industry blog FTVLive criticized the station for carrying it, especially during the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. FTVLive&#x27;s piece would be noted by the FCC in their decision against WTLV rendered on May 30, 2017, when it was given a $55,000 fine for carrying the offending Jaguars ad.
* The FCC issued several fines relating to EAS tone usage in August 2019, including ABC being fined $395,000 for using wireless emergency alert tones multiple times during a &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; sketch, AMC Networks being fined $104,000 for using the tones in &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; episode &quot;Omega&quot;, Discovery Inc. being fined $68,000 for including footage of an actual WEA activation during a &quot;Lone Star Law&quot; episode filmed during Hurricane Harvey, and Meruelo Group was fined $61,000 for including an EAS-like tone during a radio advertisement for KDAY and KDEY-FM&#x27;s morning show.
* On September 9, 2019, the FCC proposed a $272,000 fine against CBS for using simulated EAS tones in the &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; episode, &quot;A Mother, A Child, and a Blue Man&#x27;s Backside&quot;. CBS defended the statement, saying that the tones&#x27; usage was a &quot;dramatic portrayal&quot;, and that it was an &quot;integral part of the storyline about a family&#x27;s visceral reaction to a life-threatening emergency&quot;. The show&#x27;s sound editors achieved the effect by downloading EAS tones from YouTube and modifying the volume of the tone. CBS passed the edited tone through three quality rooms equipped with EAS decoders and pre-screened the episode to make sure it did not trigger an actual alert. Also, the show&#x27;s dialogue was used to obscure some elements of the alert. However, the FCC insisted that the modified tone still sounded like a normal EAS tone, despite the volume being lowered and the tone being cut short in duration. It also said that the pre-screening process did not excuse an unauthorized usage of the EAS tones. 
* On April 7, 2020, the FCC proposed a $20,000 fine against New York City radio station WNEW-FM, for using the attention signal during its morning show on October 3, 2018 as part of a skit discussing the National Periodic Test held later that day.
* In January 2023, the FCC proposed a $504,000 fine against Fox Corporation for using EAS tones during a promo broadcast on &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; in November 2021.
* On October 17, 2024, the FCC proposed a $146,976 fine against ESPN for misusing the EAS tones during a promotional segment for the start of the 2023–24 NBA season that aired during the week of October 20–24, 2023.

In an opposite move, in 2013 the FCC granted a one-year waiver for a PSA pertaining to the Wireless Emergency Alerts system, with assurance that the tones used in the PSA contained a different set of codes designed not to activate EAS receivers.

=== Testing errors ===
* On October 19, 2008, KWVE-FM in San Clemente, California accidentally initiated a Required Monthly Test when it meant to conduct a Required Weekly Test. Furthermore, an operator aborted the test mid-way through the broadcast (failing to broadcast the end-of-message tone), causing all area outlets to broadcast KWVE-FM&#x27;s programming until those stations took their equipment offline. On September 15, 2009, the FCC fined the station&#x27;s owner, Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa, $5,000. After the fine was levied, various state broadcast associations in the United States submitted joint letters to the FCC, protesting against the fine, saying that the commission could have handled the matter better. On November 13, 2009, the FCC rescinded its fine against KWVE-FM, but had still admonished the station for broadcasting an unauthorized RMT, as well as omitting the code to end the test.
* On September 28, 2016, an emergency alert was broadcast by WKTV in Utica, New York that contained a Hazardous Materials Warning for the entire United States. The message contained a non-sequitur quote from the Dr. Seuss book &quot;Green Eggs and Ham,&quot; &quot;Would you. Could you. On a train?&quot; WKTV apologized and stated that the alert was &quot;an automated test [from FEMA] which was not intended for public display.&quot; A FEMA representative stated that its decoders had been mistakenly &quot;configured to poll a test and development message aggregator instead of or in addition to the production message aggregator&quot;, with the test server having used the &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; quote as placeholder text. The error was also connected to conspiracy theories surrounding a train crash in New Jersey that occurred the next day, which claimed that the alert was a forewarning of the incident.
* On September 21, 2017, a technical glitch in another scheduled test by KWVE caused the end-of-message tone to be omitted, causing regional participants (particularly Charter and Cox Cable systems in Orange County) to simulcast a portion of Chuck Swindoll&#x27;s &quot;Insight for Living&quot; program. Some viewers speculated that the system had been hijacked, as the portion of the program relayed (where Swindoll was discussing the Bible verse 2 Timothy 3:1, and stated, &quot;Realize this, extremely violent times will come.&quot;) could be insinuated out of context as discussing an impending apocalypse.

<text>Escheat (from the Latin &quot;excidere&quot; for &quot;fall away&quot;) is a common law doctrine that transfers the real property of a person who has died without heirs to the crown or state. It serves to ensure that property is not left in &quot;limbo&quot; without recognized ownership. It originally applied to a number of situations where a legal interest in land was destroyed by operation of law, so that the ownership of the land reverted to the immediately superior feudal lord.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;escheat&quot; derives ultimately from the Latin &quot;ex-cadere&quot;, to &quot;fall-out&quot;, via mediaeval French &quot;escheoir&quot;. The sense is of a feudal estate in land falling-out of the possession by a tenant into the possession of the lord.

==Origins in feudalism==
In feudal England, escheat referred to the situation where the tenant of a fee (or &quot;fief&quot;) died without an heir or committed a felony. In the case of such demise of a tenant-in-chief, the fee reverted to the King&#x27;s demesne permanently, when it became once again a mere tenantless plot of land, but could be re-created as a fee by enfeoffment to another of the king&#x27;s followers. Where the deceased had been subinfeudated by a tenant-in-chief, the fee reverted temporarily to the crown for one year and one day by right of &quot;primer seisin&quot; after which it escheated to the over-lord who had granted it to the deceased by enfeoffment. From the time of Henry III, the monarchy took particular interest in escheat as a source of revenue.

===Background===
At the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, all the land of England was claimed as the personal possession of William the Conqueror under allodial title. The monarch thus became the sole &quot;owner&quot; of all the land in the kingdom, a position which persists to the present day. He then granted it out to his favoured followers, who thereby became tenants-in-chief, under various contracts of feudal land tenure. Such tenures, even the highest one of &quot;feudal barony&quot;, never conferred ownership of land but merely ownership of rights over it, that is to say ownership of an estate in land. Such persons are therefore correctly termed &quot;land-holders&quot; or &quot;tenants&quot; (from Latin &quot;teneo&quot; to hold), not owners. If held freely, that is to say by freehold, such holdings were heritable by the holder&#x27;s legal heir. On the payment of a premium termed feudal relief to the treasury, such heir was entitled to demand re-enfeoffment by the king with the fee concerned.

Where no legal heir existed, the logic of the situation was that the fief had ceased to exist as a legal entity, since being tenantless no one was living who had been enfeoffed with the land, and the land was thus technically owned by either the crown or the immediate overlord (where the fee had been subinfeudated by the tenant-in-chief to a mesne lord, and perhaps the process of subinfeudation had been continued by a lower series of mesne-lords) as &quot;ultimus haeres&quot;. Logically therefore it was in the occupation of the crown alone, that is to say in the royal demesne. This was the basic operation of an escheat (&#x27;excadere&#x27;), a failure of heirs.

Escheat could also take place if a tenant was outlawed or convicted of a felony, when the King could exercise the ancient right of wasting the criminal&#x27;s land for a year and a day, after which the land would revert to the overlord. (However, one guilty of treason (rather than mere felony) forfeited all lands to the King. John and his heirs frequently insisted on seizing as &quot;terrae Normannorum&quot; (i.e. &quot;lands of the Normans&quot;) the English lands of those lords with holdings in Normandy who preferred to be Normans rather than Englishmen, when the victories of Philip II of France forced them to make a proclamation of allegiance to France.) Since disavowal of a feudal bond was a felony, lords could escheat land from those who refused to perform their feudal services. On the other hand, there were also tenants who were merely sluggish in performing their duties, while not being outright rebellious against the lord. Remedies in the courts against this sort of thing, even in Bracton&#x27;s day, were available, but were considered laborious and were frequently ineffectual in compelling the desired performance. The most common mechanism was distraint, also known as distress (districtio), whereby the lord would seize chattels or goods belonging to the tenant, to hold until performance was achieved. This practice had been addressed in the 1267 Statute of Marlborough. Even so, it remained the most common extrajudicial method applied by overlords at the time of &quot;Quia Emptores&quot;.

Thus, under English common law, there were two main ways an escheat could happen:
# A person&#x27;s lands escheated to the immediate overlord if he was convicted of a felony (but not treason, in that event the land was forfeited to the Crown). If the person was executed for felony, his heirs were attainted, i.e. were ineligible to inherit. In most common-law jurisdictions, this type of escheat has been abolished outright, for example in the United States under Article 3 § 3 of the United States Constitution, which states that attainders for treason do not give rise to posthumous forfeiture, or &quot;corruption of blood&quot;.
# If a person had no heir to receive his lands under his will, or under the laws of intestacy, then any land he owned at death would escheat. This rule has been replaced in most common-law jurisdictions by &quot;bona vacantia&quot; or a similar concept.

==Procedure==
From the 12th century onward, the Crown appointed &quot;escheators&quot; to manage escheats and report to the Exchequer, with one escheator per county established by the middle of the 14th century. Upon the death of a tenant-in-chief, the escheator would be instructed by a writ of &quot;diem clausit extremum&quot; (&quot;he has closed his last day&quot;, i.e. he is dead) issued by the king&#x27;s chancery, to empanel a jury to hold an &quot;inquisition &quot;post mortem&quot;&quot; to ascertain who the legal heir was, if any, and what was the extent of the land held. Thus it would be revealed whether the king had any rights to the land. It was also important for the king to know who the heir was, and to assess his personal qualities, since he would thenceforth form a constituent part of the royal army, if he held under military tenure. If there was any doubt, the escheator would seize the land and refer the case to the king&#x27;s court where it would be settled, ensuring that not one day&#x27;s revenue would be lost. This would be a source of concern with land-holders when there were delays from the court.

==Current operation==
Most common-law jurisdictions have abolished the concept of feudal land tenure of property, and so the concept of escheat has lost something of its meaning. In England and Wales, the possibility of escheat of a deceased person&#x27;s property to the feudal overlord was abolished by the Administration of Estates Act 1925; however, the concept of &quot;bona vacantia&quot; means that the Crown (or Duchy of Cornwall or Duchy of Lancaster) can still receive such property if no-one else can be found who is eligible to inherit it.

The term is often now applied to the transfer of the title to a person&#x27;s property to the state when the person dies intestate without any other person capable of taking the property as heir. For example, a common-law jurisdiction&#x27;s intestacy statute might provide that when someone dies without a will, and is not survived by a spouse, descendants, parents, grandparents, descendants of parents, children or grandchildren of grandparents, or great-grandchildren of grandparents, then the person&#x27;s estate will escheat to the state.

Similarly, under Napoleonic law, if someone dies intestate without natural heirs then, after all creditors are paid, any remaining real and personal goods are inherited by the State.

In some jurisdictions, escheat can also occur when an entity, typically a bank, credit union or other financial institution, holds money or property which appears to be unclaimed, for instance due to a lack of activity on the account by way of deposits, withdrawals or any other transactions for a lengthy time in a cash account. In many jurisdictions, if the owner cannot be located, such property can be revocably escheated to the state.

In commerce, it is the process of reassigning legal title in unclaimed or abandoned payroll checks, insurance payouts, or stocks and shares whose owners cannot be traced, to a state authority (in the United States). A company is required to file unclaimed property reports with its state annually and, in some jurisdictions, to make a good-faith effort to find the owners of their dormant accounts. The escheating criteria are set by individual state regulations.

====Bankruptcies and liquidations====
Escheat can still occur in England and Wales, if a person is made bankrupt or a corporation is liquidated. Usually this means that all the property held by that person is &#x27;vested in&#x27; (transferred to) the Official Receiver or Trustee in Bankruptcy. However, it is open to the Receiver or Trustee to refuse to accept that property by disclaiming it. It is relatively common for a trustee in bankruptcy to disclaim freehold property which may give rise to a liability, for example the common parts of a block of flats owned by the bankrupt would ordinarily pass to the trustee to be realised in order to pay his debts, but the property may give the landlord an obligation to spend money for the benefit of lessees of the flats. The bankruptcy of the original owner means that the freehold is no longer the bankrupt&#x27;s legal property, and the disclaimer destroys the freehold estate, so that the land ceases to be owned by anyone and effectively escheats to become land held by the Crown in demesne. This situation affects a few hundred properties each year.

Although such escheated property is owned by the Crown, it is not part of the Crown Estate, unless the Crown (through the Crown Estate Commissioners) &#x27;completes&#x27; the escheat, by taking steps to exert rights as owner. However, usually, in the example given above, the tenants of the flats, or their mortgagees would exercise their rights given by the Insolvency Act 1986 to have the freehold property transferred to them. This is the main difference between escheat and &quot;bona vacantia&quot;, as in the latter, a grant takes place automatically, with no need to &#x27;complete&#x27; the transaction.

====Registration of Crown land====

One consequence of the Land Registration Act 1925 was that only estates in land (freehold or leasehold) could be registered. Crown land, i.e., land held directly by the Crown – also known as property in the &quot;royal demesne&quot; – is not held under any residual feudal tenure (the Crown has no historical overlord other than, for brief periods, the papacy), and there is therefore no estate to register. This had the consequence that freeholds which escheated to the Crown ceased to be registrable. This created a slow drain of property out of registration, amounting to some hundreds of freehold titles in each year.

The problem was noted by the Law Commission in their report &quot;Land Registration for the Twenty-First Century&quot;. The Land Registration Act 2002 was passed in response to that report. It provides that land held in demesne by the Crown may be registered.

==== Transfer agents and escheatment ====
Escheatment is the process of returning lost or unclaimed property to the government of a state, for safekeeping until the owner is identified. Geographic jurisdiction of the state is determined by the last known address of the original owner. Each state has laws regulating escheatment, with holding periods typically ranging around five years. The legal principle behind escheatment is that all property has a legally recognized owner. Therefore, if the original owner cannot be found within a specified time, the government is presumed to be the owner.

Escheats are performed on a revocable basis. Thus, if property has escheated to a state but the original owner subsequently is found, escheatment is revoked and ownership of the property reverts to that original owner.

==== Lost shareholders ====
According to SEC Rule 17 CFR 240.17f-1: Transfer agents are obligated by the SEC to report to the commission (specifically to its designee; the SEC&#x27;s Securities Information System) anytime a certificate is known to be lost or missing for at least two days. Transfer Agents must search for the holder&#x27;s SSN or EIN utilizing an information database system, or if not available, exercise their best effort to match the holder&#x27;s name and address through these systems. All transfer agents must report all lost or missing certificates/shareholders on their own annual filings.

<doc id="175531" wikidata="Q469882" url="?curid=175531" title="Robert G. Ingersoll">
<text>Robert Green Ingersoll (; August 11, 1833 – July 21, 1899), nicknamed &quot;the Great Agnostic&quot;, was an American lawyer, writer, and orator during the Golden Age of Free Thought, who campaigned in defense of agnosticism.

==Personal life==
Robert Ingersoll was born in Dresden, New York. His father, John Ingersoll, was an abolitionist-sympathizing Congregationalist preacher, whose radical opinions caused him and his family to relocate frequently. For a time, Rev. John Ingersoll substituted as preacher for American revivalist Charles G. Finney while Finney was on a tour of Europe. Upon Finney&#x27;s return, Rev. Ingersoll remained for a few months as co-pastor/associate pastor with Finney. The elder Ingersoll&#x27;s later pastoral experiences influenced young Robert negatively, however, as The Elmira Telegram described in 1890:

Though for many years the most noted of American infidels, Colonel Ingersoll was born and reared in a devoutly Christian household. His father, John Ingersoll, was a Congregationalist minister and a man of mark in his time, a deep thinker, a logical and eloquent speaker, broad minded and generously tolerant of the views of others. The popular impression which credits Ingersoll&#x27;s infidelity in the main to his father&#x27;s severe orthodoxy and the austere and gloomy surroundings in which his boyhood was spent is wholly wrong. On the contrary, the elder Ingersoll&#x27;s liberal views were a source of constant trouble between him and his parishioners. They caused him to frequently change his charges, and several times made him the defendant in church trials. His ministerial career was, in fact, substantially brought to a close by a church trial which occurred while he was pastor of the Congregational Church at Madison, Ohio, and at which his third wife appeared as the prosecutor. Upon this occasion, he was charged with prevarication and unministerial conduct. The evidence adduced – the trial is one of the abiding traditions of the dull little town of Madison – was of the most trivial and ridiculous character, but the committee which heard it decided that, though he had done &quot;nothing inconsistent with his Christian character,&quot; he was &quot;inconsistent with his ministerial character,&quot; and forbade him to preach in the future. Elder John went before the higher church authorities and was permitted to continue his clerical labors. However, he soon removed to Wisconsin, going from there to Illinois, where he died. The Madison trial occurred when young Robert was nine years old, and it was the unjust and bigoted treatment his father received which made him the enemy, first of Calvinism, and later of Christianity in its other forms.

During 1853, &quot;Bob&quot; Ingersoll taught a term of school in Metropolis, Illinois, where he let one of his students, the future Judge Angus M. L. McBane, do the &quot;greater part of the teaching, while Latin and history occupied his own attention&quot;. At some time prior to his Metropolis position, Ingersoll had also taught school in Mount Vernon, Illinois.

Ingersoll was married, February 13, 1862, to Eva Amelia Parker (1841–1923). They had two daughters. The elder daughter, Eva Ingersoll-Brown, was a renowned feminist and suffragist.

==Lawyer==
Later that year, the family settled in Marion, Illinois, where Robert and his brother Ebon Clarke Ingersoll were admitted to the bar in 1854. A county historian writing 22 years later noted that local residents considered the Ingersolls as a &quot;very intellectual family; but, being Abolitionists, and the boys being deists, rendered obnoxious to our people in that respect.&quot;

While in Marion, he learned law from Judge Willis Allen and served as deputy clerk for John M. Cunningham, Williamson County&#x27;s County Clerk and Circuit Clerk. In 1855, after Cunningham was named registrar for the federal land office in southeastern Illinois at Shawneetown, Illinois, Ingersoll followed him to the riverfront city along the Ohio River. After a brief time there, he accepted the deputy clerk position with John E. Hall, the county clerk and circuit clerk of Gallatin County, and also a son-in-law of John Hart Crenshaw. On November 11, 1856, Ingersoll caught Hall in his arms when the son of a political opponent assassinated his employer in their office.

When he relocated to Shawneetown, he continued to read law with Judge William G. Bowman who had a large library of both law and the classics. In addition to his job as a clerk, he and his brother began their law practice using the name &quot;E.C. and R.G. Ingersoll&quot;. During this time they also had an office in Raleigh, Illinois, then the county seat of neighboring Saline County. As attorneys following the court circuit he often practiced alongside Cunningham&#x27;s soon-to-be son-in-law, John A. Logan, the state&#x27;s attorney and political ally to Hall.

With his earlier mentor Cunningham having moved back to Marion after the land office&#x27;s closing in 1856, and Logan&#x27;s relocation to Benton, Illinois, after his marriage that autumn, Ingersoll and his brother moved to Peoria, Illinois, where they finally settled in 1857.

Ingersoll was involved with several major trials as an attorney, notably the Star Route trials, a major political scandal in which his clients were acquitted. He also defended a New Jersey man charged with blasphemy. Although he did not win the acquittal, his vigorous defense is considered to have discredited blasphemy laws and few other prosecutions followed.

For a time, Ingersoll represented con artist James Reavis, the &quot;Baron of Arizona&quot;, pronouncing his Peralta Land Grant claim valid.

== Civil war ==
With the beginning of the American Civil War, he raised the 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry of the Union Army and assumed command. The regiment fought in the Battle of Shiloh. Ingersoll was later captured in a skirmish with the Confederates near Lexington, Tennessee on December 18, 1862, then paroled – i.e. released on his oath that he would not fight again against the Confederate States of America until formally exchanged for a captured Confederate soldier or officer of like rank (who was often under parole himself, making the practice a matter of honor and formality, which could be extended to individuals or even entire regiments &quot;en masse&quot;). This was an old practice which was still commonly observed early in the war, until the Dix–Hill Cartel broke down under political distress. Unable to perform his duties under his officer&#x27;s commission while paroled, he tendered his resignation as commanding officer on June 30, 1863.

==Entry into politics==
After the war, he served as Illinois Attorney General. He was a prominent member of the Republican Party and, though he never held elected office, he was nonetheless an active participant in politics. According to Robert Nisbet, Ingersoll was a &quot;staunch Republican.&quot; His speech nominating James G. Blaine for the 1876 presidential election was unsuccessful, as Rutherford B. Hayes received the Republican nomination, but the speech itself, known as the &quot;Plumed Knight&quot; speech, was considered a model of political oratory. His opinions on slavery, woman&#x27;s suffrage, and other issues of the time would sometimes become part of the mainstream, but his atheism/agnosticism effectively prevented him from ever pursuing or holding political offices higher than that of state attorney general. Illinois Republicans tried to persuade him to campaign for governor on the condition that Ingersoll conceal his agnosticism during the campaign, which he refused to do.

==Oratory and free thought==
On October 30, 1880, Ingersoll was introduced as &quot;the Great Agnostic&quot; by Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, before a political speech delivered to a large audience at the Academy of Music in Brooklyn. In an unpublished 1881 lecture entitled &quot;The Great Infidels&quot;, he attacked the doctrine of Hell: &quot;All the meanness, all the revenge, all the selfishness, all the cruelty, all the hatred, all the infamy of which the heart of man is capable, grew, blossomed, and bore fruit in this one word – Hell.&quot;
He opposed the Chinese Exclusion Act and supported a more lenient policy toward Chinese workers coming to the United States. Ingersoll defended women’s rights and opposed racial discrimination and capital punishment.

==Membership of The Lambs==
Ingersoll was elected to The Lambs Theatre Club in 1889 and gave an address to their first public &quot;gambol&quot; at the Broadway Theatre on March 3, 1891; his address &quot;brought many laughs&quot;.

==Death==
Ingersoll died from congestive heart failure at the age of 65. Soon after his death, his brother-in-law, Clinton P. Farrell, collected copies of Ingersoll&#x27;s speeches for publication. The 12-volume &quot;Dresden Editions&quot; kept interest in Ingersoll&#x27;s ideas alive and preserved his speeches for future generations. Ingersoll&#x27;s ashes are interred in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Susan Jacoby credits Ingersoll for the revival of Thomas Paine&#x27;s reputation in American intellectual history, which had decreased after the publication of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; published during 1794–95. Paine postulated that men, not God, had written the Bible, and Ingersoll included this work in his lectures on freethinking. As the only freethinker of his time with a wide audience outside of the unbelieving circle, he reintroduced Paine&#x27;s ideas to a new generation.

In 2005, a popular edition of Ingersoll&#x27;s work was published by Steerforth Press. Edited by the Pulitzer Prize-winning music critic Tim Page, &quot;What&#x27;s God Got to Do With It: Robert Ingersoll on Free Speech, Honest Talk and the Separation of Church and State&quot; brought Ingersoll&#x27;s thinking to a new audience.

There are two streets in the City of Madison, Wisconsin that are named after him: North Ingersoll Street and South Ingersoll Street.

==Friendship with Walt Whitman==
Ingersoll enjoyed a friendship with the poet Walt Whitman, who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. &quot;It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is &#x27;Leaves of Grass&#x27; ... He lives, embodies, the individuality, I preach. I see in Bob [Ingersoll] the noblest specimen – American-flavored – pure out of the soil, spreading, giving, demanding light.&quot;

The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman&#x27;s death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet&#x27;s funeral. The eulogy was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric.

==In popular culture==

* The community of Redwater, Texas was founded in the mid-1870s as Ingersoll in honor of Robert Ingersoll; it was changed to its current name following an 1886 revival meeting that yielded 110 conversions, the townspeople no longer wishing to honor the agnostic.
* The Ingersoll Gender Center in Seattle WA is named after him. 
* Colonel Bob Mountain in Washington state was named for Robert Ingersoll.
* His birthplace, known as the Robert Ingersoll Birthplace, or Robert Green Ingersoll Birthplace Museum, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.
* A mine near Keystone, SD is named after him.
* Ingersoll&#x27;s type of agnosticism was labelled &quot;Ingersollism&quot; by his intellectual contemporaries, including Congregationalist Lyman Abbott, Congregationalist minister John P. Sanderson, Illinois scholar and lawyer George Reuben Wendling and others (such as a collection of refutations of Ingersollism published in 1879 by Chicago publishers Rhodes and McClure).
* In July 2016 Ingersoll&#x27;s statue in Peoria, Illinois was restored thanks to a successful fundraising effort by the Freedom From Religion Foundation.
* In Lewis Grassic Gibbon&#x27;s modernist novel &quot;Sunset Song&quot; (1932), the character of Long Rob reads &quot;the books of a coarse creature Ingersoll that made watches and didn&#x27;t believe in God&quot; and &quot;God knows if the creature&#x27;s logic was as poor as his watches&quot; and &quot;fair caution him and his Ingersoll that could neither make watches nor sense&quot;. The author&#x27;s running joke intentionally confuses Robert G. Ingersoll with the watch-making company of the same name.
* In Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;, the &quot;freethinker&quot; Jim Lefferts throws a volume of Ingersoll&#x27;s work at Gantry following an argument over his recent conversion; Gantry, struggling to write a speech for a revival meeting, takes a paragraph from Ingersoll out of context and builds his sermon on it.

<doc id="175534" wikidata="Q580850" url="?curid=175534" title="Techno-thriller">
<text>A techno-thriller or technothriller is a hybrid genre drawing from science fiction, thrillers, spy fiction, action, and war novels. They include a disproportionate amount (relative to other genres) of technical details on their subject matter (typically military technology); only hard science fiction tends towards a comparable level of supporting detail on the technical side. The inner workings of technology and the mechanics of various disciplines (espionage, martial arts, politics) are thoroughly explored, and the plot often turns on the particulars of that exploration. This genre began to exist and establish itself in the early 20th century with further developments and focus on the genre in the mid 20th century.

== History ==
The genre dates back to early in the 20th century. &quot;Invasion of the Sea&quot; by Jules Verne (1905) has been called an early techno-thriller. Many techno-thrillers are comparable to science fiction—and several modes within science-fiction. The popularity of the genre has maintained itself and evolved over the years.

One of the earliest techno-thrillers is thought to be &quot;The Satan Bug&quot; (1962) by Alistair MacLean, while much of what counted for science fiction in the pre-war and early post-war Soviet Union were essentially techno-thrillers, full of technical details and featuring complex spy-rich plots, one of the most enduring example being the Grigory Adamov&#x27;s &quot;The Mystery of the Two Oceans&quot; (1939). Michael Crichton and Tom Clancy are considered to be the fathers of the &quot;modern techno-thriller&quot;; Crichton&#x27;s book &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; and Clancy&#x27;s book &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; set out the type example which defined the genre, although many authors had been writing similar material earlier, such as Craig Thomas, whom BBC News also credits as an early innovator.

== Style ==
Techno-thrillers focus strongly on details, especially on the technology, which is frequently of military origin. Techno-thrillers tend to have a broad scope in the narrative, and can often be regarded as contemporary speculative fiction; world wars are a common topic. Techno-thrillers often overlap, as far as the genre goes, with near-future science fiction, military fiction, and espionage fiction. To the extent that technology is now a dominant aspect of modern global culture, most modern thrillers are &quot;techno-thrillers&quot; in broad sense, and the genre is somewhat diffuse. Techno-thrillers blur smoothly into the category of hard science fiction; the defining characteristics of techno-thriller are an emphasis on real-world or plausible near-future technology. There is often a focus on military or military-political action. Techno-thrillers also overlap with conspiracy fiction and apocalyptic fiction. While techno-thrillers borrow concepts and ideas from other forms and styles of other genres, notably science-fiction and its subcategories, it is a fresh and still developing style with it being more of a hybrid genre, more closely related to thrillers and technology. Since technology is always changing, that brings a fresh take on techno thrillers with advancement always on the scope.

== Varieties ==
Techno-thrillers have at least five varieties within the genre. These are military techno-thrillers, spy techno-thrillers, crypto-techno-thrillers, disaster techno-thrillers, and science-fiction techno-thrillers.

* Military techno-thrillers: These techno-thrillers focus mainly on military issues and problems. They have to do with military centralism in the story and are focused on martial technology. Tom Clancy is credited with having huge success within this category.
* Spy techno-thrillers: These techno-thrillers are similar to traditional techno-thrillers while remaining true to the pace and they borrow from spy-fi as well. The main aim of this category is to write about espionage as well as tradecraft. They have to do with defeating a rival enemy or enemies and stopping them from achieving their goals.
* Crypto-techno-thrillers: These techno-thrillers are the kind that has the story and the drama unfold most of the time online.
* Disaster techno-thrillers: These techno-thrillers usually have to do with terrible things happening such as an earthquake or any natural disaster, war and nuclear wars, apocalypse, and the end of the world themes are also prevalent. Most times, the problem is grand and affects a worldwide level instead of a local one. The goal of the protagonist is to survive instead of fixing the crisis. A prominent modern day writer to this subgenre is Boyd Morrison, author of &quot;Typhoon Fury&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller.
* Science-fiction techno-thrillers: Are heavily reliant on science fiction and are often set in the future. Techno-thrillers borrow concepts from science fiction. An example of this techno-thriller would be the science behind &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

<text>Netflix is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service. The service primarily distributes original and acquired films and television shows from various genres, and it is available internationally in multiple languages.

Launched in 2007, nearly a decade after Netflix, Inc. began its pioneering DVD-by-mail movie rental service, Netflix is the most-subscribed video on demand streaming media service, with 301.6 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries as of 2025. By 2022, &quot;Netflix Original&quot; productions accounted for half of its library in the United States and the namesake company had ventured into other categories, such as video game publishing of mobile games through its flagship service. As of 2023, Netflix is the 23rd most-visited website in the world, with 23.66% of its traffic coming from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom at 5.84%, and Brazil at 5.64%.

== History ==


=== Launch as a mail-based rental business (1997–2006) ===

Netflix was founded by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, was a co-founder of Pure Software, which was acquired by Rational Software that year for $750 million, the then biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. Randolph had worked as a marketing director for Pure Software after Pure Atria acquired a company where Randolph worked. He was previously a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company, as well as vice president of marketing for Borland.

Hastings and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while carpooling between their homes in Santa Cruz, California, and Pure Atria&#x27;s headquarters in Sunnyvale. Patty McCord, later head of human resources at Netflix, was also in the carpool group. Randolph admired Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected selling and renting VHS as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States in early 1997, they tested the concept of online DVD rental or sales by mail, by mailing a compact disc to Hastings&#x27;s house in Santa Cruz. When the CD arrived intact, they decided to enter the $16 billion Home-video sales and rental industry. (Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for returning late a copy of &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, but Randolph later said that Hastings invented the anecdote. Blockbuster reportedly ordered Hastings in the mid-2000s to stop telling the story, after it could not find such a transaction in its records.) Hastings invested $2.5 million into Netflix from the sale of Pure Atria. Netflix launched as the first DVD rental and sales website with 30 employees and 925 titles available—nearly all DVDs published. Randolph and Hastings met with Jeff Bezos, whose Amazon offered to acquire Netflix for between $14 and $16 million. Fearing competition from Amazon, Randolph thought the offer was fair, but Hastings, who owned 70% of the company, turned it down on the plane ride home.

Not restricted to the size of a retail store, Netflix could offer hundreds of thousands of DVDs to customers in a long tail business model. Early employee Cindy Holland compared the company acquiring DVDs to &quot;shoveling coal in the side door of the house&quot;. Initially, Netflix offered a per-rental model for each DVD but introduced a monthly subscription concept in September 1999. The per-rental model was dropped by early 2000, allowing the company to focus on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees. While customers enjoyed the convenience, more important to Netflix was that it did not have to store or ship those DVDs; subscribers&#x27; homes acted as warehouses. The company secretly slowed deliveries to heavy users (&quot;pigs&quot;), to discourage them from quickly returning DVDs.

In September 2000, during the dot-com bubble, while Netflix was suffering losses, Hastings and Randolph offered to sell the company to Blockbuster for $50 million. John Antioco, CEO of Blockbuster, thought the offer was a joke and declined, saying, &quot;The dot-com hysteria is completely overblown.&quot; While Netflix experienced fast growth in early 2001, the continued effects of the dot-com bubble collapse and the September 11 attacks caused the company to hold off plans for its initial public offering (IPO) and to lay off one-third of its 120 employees.
DVD players were a popular gift for holiday sales in late 2001, and demand for DVD subscription services were &quot;growing like crazy&quot;, according to chief talent officer McCord. The company went public on May 23, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at US$15.00 per share. In 2003, Netflix was issued a patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to cover its subscription rental service and several extensions. The company posted its first profit in 2003, earning $6.5 million on revenues of $272 million; by 2004, profit had increased to $49 million on over $500 million in revenues. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.

In 2004, Blockbuster introduced a DVD rental service, which not only allowed users to check out titles through online sites but allowed for them to return them at brick and-mortar stores. By 2006, Blockbuster&#x27;s service reached two million users, and while trailing Netflix&#x27;s subscriber count, was drawing business away from Netflix. Netflix lowered fees in 2007. While it was an urban legend that Netflix ultimately &quot;killed&quot; Blockbuster in the DVD rental market, Blockbuster&#x27;s debt load and internal disagreements hurt the company.

On April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a patent infringement lawsuit in which it demanded a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Blockbuster&#x27;s online DVD rental subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first cause of action alleged Blockbuster&#x27;s infringement of copying the &quot;dynamic queue&quot; of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix&#x27;s method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix&#x27;s method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered. The second cause of action alleged infringement of the subscription rental service as well as Netflix&#x27;s methods of communication and delivery. The companies settled their dispute on June 25, 2007; terms were not disclosed.

On October 1, 2006, Netflix announced the Netflix Prize, $1,000,000 to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%. On September 21, 2009, it awarded the $1,000,000 prize to team &quot;BellKor&#x27;s Pragmatic Chaos&quot;. Cinematch, launched in 2000, was a system that recommended movies to its users, many of which might have been entirely new to the user.

Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as &quot;Born into Brothels&quot; and &quot;Sherrybaby&quot;. In late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters. Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008.

=== Transition to streaming services (2007–2012) ===
Hastings reportedly told Mynette Louie in the late 1990s that his goal was always streaming media, and that Netflix rented DVDs only to grow its customer base for streaming. By the mid-2000s data speeds and bandwidth costs improved sufficiently to allow customers to download movies from the internet. The original idea was a &quot;Netflix box&quot; that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, Netflix had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service. But after witnessing how popular streaming services such as YouTube were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept. In January 2007, the company launched a streaming media service, introducing video on demand via the Internet. However, at that time it only had 1,000 films available for streaming, compared to 70,000 available on DVD. The service, then called &quot;Watch Now&quot;, at first required Internet Explorer on a computer. Hollywood studios licensed second-run content to the service, and did not expect it to threaten their existing lucrative relationships with cable television.

In February 2007, Netflix delivered its billionth DVD, a copy of &quot;Babel&quot; to a customer in Texas. In April 2007, Netflix recruited ReplayTV founder Anthony Wood, to build a &quot;Netflix Player&quot; that would allow streaming content to be played directly on a television rather than a desktop or laptop. Hastings eventually shut down the project to help encourage other hardware manufacturers to include built-in Netflix support, which would be spun off as the digital media player product Roku.

In January 2008, all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost. This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple&#x27;s new video-rental services. In August 2008, the Netflix database was corrupted and the company was not able to ship DVDs to customers for 3 days, leading the company to move all its data to the Amazon Web Services cloud. In November 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-ray and discontinued its sale of used DVDs. In 2009, Netflix streams overtook DVD shipments.

On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals to 28 days after the DVDs became available for sale, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, and similar deals involving Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9. In July 2010, Netflix signed a deal to stream movies of Relativity Media. In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix&#x27;s annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009. On September 22, 2010, Netflix launched in Canada, its first international market. In November 2010, Netflix began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.

In 2010, Netflix acquired the rights to &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, produced by Sony Pictures Television, after the show&#x27;s third season, at a point where original broadcaster AMC had expressed the possibility of cancelling the show. Sony pushed Netflix to release &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; in time for the fourth season, which as a result, greatly expanded the show&#x27;s audience on AMC due to new viewers bingeing on the Netflix past episodes, and doubling the viewership by the time of the fifth season. &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; is considered the first such show to have this &quot;Netflix effect&quot;.

In January 2011, Netflix announced agreements with several manufacturers to include branded Netflix buttons on the remote controls of devices compatible with the service, such as Blu-ray players. By May 2011, Netflix had become the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America, accounting for 30% of traffic during peak hours.

On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services. The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. On September 11, 2011, Netflix expanded to countries in Latin America. On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services. On September 26, 2011, Netflix announced a content deal with DreamWorks Animation. On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together, citing customer dissatisfaction with the split.

In October 2011. Netflix and The CW signed a multi-year output deal for its television shows. On January 9, 2012, Netflix started its expansion to Europe, launching in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In February 2012, Netflix reached a multi-year agreement with The Weinstein Company. In March 2012, Netflix acquired the domain name DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name &quot;DVD.com, A Netflix Company&quot;. In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC. Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers tweeted that the intent was to &quot;engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA&quot;. In June 2012, Netflix signed a deal with Open Road Films.

On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films. In September 2012, Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films came to Netflix 90 days after premiering on Epix. These included films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.

On October 18, 2012, Netflix launched in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. On December 4, 2012, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios&#x27; animated and live-action films, with classics such as &quot;Dumbo&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Pocahontas&quot; available immediately and others available on Netflix beginning in 2016. Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.

On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner&#x27;s Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT&#x27;s &quot;Dallas&quot;, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs were given to Netflix shortly after deals with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. Channel programs expired.

For cost reasons, Netflix stated that it would limit its expansion in 2013, adding only one new market—the Netherlands—in September of that year. This expanded its availability to 40 territories.

=== Development of original programming and distribution expansion (2013–2017) ===

Netflix had long closely analyzed its customers&#x27; preferences. Watch Now gave the company real-time data on their behavior, such as scenes that customers replayed or skipped, or when they stopped watching a show. In 2011, Netflix began its efforts into original content development. In March, it made a straight-to-series order from MRC for the political drama &quot;House of Cards&quot;, led by Kevin Spacey, outbidding U.S. cable networks. This marked the first instance of a first-run television series being specifically commissioned by the service. Netflix executives said that its customers&#x27; love of films by Spacey and show director David Fincher caused the company to acquire the show. Customers&#x27; tendency to binge watch many episodes without stopping caused it to release all 13 episodes of the show&#x27;s first season at the same time. In November the same year, Netflix added two more significant productions to its roster: the comedy-drama &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;, adapted from Piper Kerman&#x27;s memoir, and a new season of the previously cancelled Fox sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. Netflix acquired the U.S. rights to the Norwegian drama &quot;Lilyhammer&quot; after its television premiere on Norway&#x27;s NRK1 on January 25, 2012. Notably departing from the traditional broadcast television model of weekly episode premieres, Netflix chose to release the entire first season on February 8 of the same year.

&quot;House of Cards&quot; was released by Netflix on February 1, 2013, marketed as the first &quot;Netflix Original&quot; production. Later that month, Netflix announced an agreement with DreamWorks Animation to commission children&#x27;s television series based on its properties, beginning with &quot;Turbo: F.A.S.T.&quot;, a spin-off of its film &quot;Turbo.&quot; &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; would premiere in July 2013; Netflix stated that &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; had been its most-watched original series so far, with all of them having &quot;an audience comparable with successful shows on cable and broadcast TV.&quot;

On March 13, 2013, Netflix added a Facebook sharing feature, letting United States subscribers access &quot;Watched by your friends&quot; and &quot;Friends&#x27; Favorites&quot; by agreeing. This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act was modified in early 2013. On August 1, 2013, Netflix reintroduced the &quot;Profiles&quot; feature that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles.

In November 2013, Marvel Television and ABC Studios announced Netflix had ordered a slate of four television series based on the Marvel Comics characters Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. Each of the four series received an initial order of 13 episodes, and Netflix also ordered a Defenders miniseries that would tie them together. &quot;Daredevil&quot; and &quot;Jessica Jones&quot; premiered in 2015. The &quot;Luke Cage&quot; series premiered on September 30, 2016, followed by &quot;Iron Fist&quot; on March 17, 2017, and &quot;The Defenders&quot; on August 18, 2017. Marvel owner Disney later entered into other content agreements with Netflix, including acquiring its animated &quot;Star Wars&quot; series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, and a new sixth season.

In February 2014, Netflix began to enter into agreements with U.S. internet service providers, beginning with Comcast (whose customers had repeatedly complained of frequent buffering when streaming Netflix), in order to provide the service a direct connection to their networks. In April 2014, Netflix signed &quot;Arrested Development&quot; creator Mitchell Hurwitz and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service. In May 2014, Netflix &amp; Sony Pictures Animation had a major multi-deal to acquired streaming rights to produce films. It also began to introduce an updated logo, with a flatter appearance and updated typography.

In September 2014, Netflix expanded into six new European markets, including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. On September 10, 2014, Netflix participated in Internet Slowdown Day by deliberately slowing down its speed in support of net neutrality regulations in the United States. In October 2014, Netflix announced a four-film deal with Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison Productions.

In April 2015, following the launch of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, Netflix director of content operations Tracy Wright announced that Netflix had added support for audio description, and had begun to work with its partners to add descriptions to its other original series over time. The following year, as part of a settlement with the American Council of the Blind, Netflix agreed to provide descriptions for its original series within 30 days of their premiere, and add screen reader support and the ability to browse content by availability of descriptions.

In March 2015, Netflix expanded to Australia and New Zealand. In September 2015, Netflix launched in Japan, its first country in Asia. In October 2015, Netflix launched in Italy, Portugal, and Spain.

In January 2016, at the Consumer Electronics Show, Netflix announced a major international expansion of its service into 130 additional countries. It then had become available worldwide except China, Syria, North Korea, Kosovo and Crimea. In May 2016, Netflix created a tool called Fast.com to determine the speed of an Internet connection. It received praise for being &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;easy to use&quot;, and does not include online advertising, unlike competitors. On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing offline, without an Internet connection.

In 2016, Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films, more than any network or cable channel. In April 2016, Hastings stated that the company planned to expand its in-house, Los Angeles-based Netflix Studios to grow its output; Hastings ruled out any potential acquisitions of existing studios.

In February 2017, Netflix signed a music publishing deal with BMG Rights Management, whereby BMG will oversee rights outside of the United States for music associated with Netflix original content. Netflix continues to handle these tasks in-house in the United States. On April 25, 2017, Netflix signed a licensing deal with IQIYI, a Chinese video streaming platform owned by Baidu, to allow selected Netflix original content to be distributed in China on the platform.

On August 7, 2017, Netflix acquired Millarworld, the creator-owned publishing company of comic book writer Mark Millar. The purchase marked the first corporate acquisition to have been made by Netflix. On August 14, 2017, Netflix entered into an exclusive development deal with Shonda Rhimes and her production company Shondaland.

In September 2017, Netflix announced it would offer its low-broadband mobile technology to airlines to provide better in-flight Wi-Fi so that passengers can watch movies on Netflix while on planes.

In September 2017, Minister of Heritage Mélanie Joly announced that Netflix had agreed to make a (US$400 million) investment over the next five years in producing content in Canada. The company denied that the deal was intended to result in a tax break. Netflix realized this goal by December 2018.

In October 2017, Netflix iterated a goal of having half of its library consist of original content by 2019, announcing a plan to invest $8 billion on original content in 2018. In October 2017, Netflix introduced the &quot;Skip Intro&quot; feature which allows customers to skip the intros to shows on its platform through a variety of techniques including manual reviewing, audio tagging, and machine learning.

In November 2017, Netflix signed an exclusive multi-year deal with &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; creator Jenji Kohan. In November 2017, Netflix withdrew from co-hosting a party at the 75th Golden Globe Awards with The Weinstein Company due to the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases.

=== Expansion into international productions and new productions (2017–2020) ===

In November 2017, Netflix announced that it would be making its first original Colombian series, to be executive produced by Ciro Guerra. In December 2017, Netflix signed &quot;Stranger Things&quot; director-producer Shawn Levy and his production company 21 Laps Entertainment to what sources say is a four-year deal. In 2017, Netflix invested in distributing exclusive stand-up comedy specials from Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Chris Rock, Jim Gaffigan, Bill Burr and Jerry Seinfeld.

In February 2018, Netflix acquired the rights to &quot;The Cloverfield Paradox&quot; from Paramount Pictures for $50 million and launched on its service on February 4, 2018, shortly after airing its first trailer during Super Bowl LII. Analysts believed that Netflix&#x27;s purchase of the film helped to make the film instantly profitable for Paramount compared to a more traditional theatrical release, while Netflix benefited from the surprise reveal. Other films acquired by Netflix include international distribution for Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Annihilation&quot; and Universal&#x27;s &quot;News of the World&quot; and worldwide distribution of Universal&#x27;s &quot;Extinction&quot;, Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;&quot;, Paramount&#x27;s &quot;The Lovebirds&quot; and 20th Century Studios&#x27; &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot;. In March, the service ordered &quot;Formula 1: Drive to Survive&quot;, a racing docuseries following teams in the Formula One world championship.

In March 2018, Sky UK announced an agreement with Netflix to integrate Netflix&#x27;s subscription VOD offering into its pay-TV service. Customers with its high-end Sky Q set-top box and service will be able to see Netflix titles alongside their regular Sky channels. In October 2022, Netflix revealed that its annual revenue from the UK subscribers in 2021 was £1.4bn.

In April 2018, Netflix pulled out of the Cannes Film Festival, in response to new rules requiring competition films to have been released in French theaters. The Cannes premiere of &quot;Okja&quot; in 2017 was controversial, and led to discussions over the appropriateness of films with simultaneous digital releases being screened at an event showcasing theatrical film; audience members also booed the Netflix production logo at the screening. Netflix&#x27;s attempts to negotiate to allow a limited release in France were curtailed by organizers, as well as French cultural exception law—where theatrically screened films are legally forbidden from being made available via video-on-demand services until at least 36 months after their release. Besides traditional Hollywood markets as well as from partners like the BBC, Sarandos said the company also looking to expand investments in non-traditional foreign markets due to the growth of viewers outside of North America. At the time, this included programs such as &quot;Dark&quot; from Germany, &quot;Ingobernable&quot; from Mexico and &quot;3%&quot; from Brazil.

On May 22, 2018, former president, Barack Obama, and his wife, Michelle Obama, signed a deal to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for Netflix under the Obamas&#x27; newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions.

In June 2018, Netflix announced a partnership with Telltale Games to port its adventure games to the service in a streaming video format, allowing simple controls through a television remote. The first game, &quot;&quot;, was released in November 2018. In July 2018, Netflix earned the most Emmy nominations of any network for the first time with 112 nods. On August 27, 2018, the company signed a five-year exclusive overall deal with international best–selling author Harlan Coben. On the same day, the company signed an overall deal with &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; creator Alex Hirsch. In October 2018, Netflix paid under $30 million to acquire Albuquerque Studios (ABQ Studios), a $91 million film and TV production facility with eight sound stages in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for its first U.S. production hub, pledging to spend over $1 billion over the next decade to create one of the largest film studios in North America. In November 2018, Paramount Pictures signed a multi-picture film deal with Netflix, making Paramount the first major film studio to sign a deal with Netflix. A sequel to AwesomenessTV&#x27;s &quot;To All the Boys I&#x27;ve Loved Before&quot; was released on Netflix under the title &quot;To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You&quot; as part of the agreement. In December 2018, the company announced a partnership with ESPN Films on a television documentary chronicling Michael Jordan and the 1997–98 Chicago Bulls season titled &quot;The Last Dance&quot;. It was released internationally on Netflix and became available for streaming in the United States three months after a broadcast airing on ESPN.

In January 2019, &quot;Sex Education&quot; made its debut as a Netflix original series, receiving much critical acclaim. On January 22, 2019, Netflix sought and was approved for membership into the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), making it the first streaming service to join the association. In February 2019, &quot;The Haunting&quot; creator Mike Flanagan joined frequent collaborator Trevor Macy as a partner in Intrepid Pictures and the duo signed an exclusive overall deal with Netflix to produce television content. On May 9, 2019, Netflix contracted with Dark Horse Entertainment to make television series and films based on comics from Dark Horse Comics. In July 2019, Netflix announced that it would be opening a hub at Shepperton Studios as part of a deal with Pinewood Group. In early-August 2019, Netflix negotiated an exclusive multi-year film and television deal with &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; creators and showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. The first Netflix production created by Benioff and Weiss was planned as an adaptation of Liu Cixin&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, part of the &quot;Remembrance of Earth&#x27;s Past&quot; trilogy. On September 30, 2019, in addition to renewing &quot;Stranger Things&quot; for a fourth season, Netflix signed The Duffer Brothers to an overall deal covering future film and television projects for the service.

== Availability and access ==

=== Global availability ===
Netflix is available in every country and territory except for China, North Korea, Syria, and Russia.

In January 2016, Netflix announced it would begin VPN blocking since it can be used to watch videos from a country where they are unavailable. The result of the VPN block is that people can only watch videos available worldwide and other videos are hidden from search results. Variety is present on Netflix. Hebrew and right-to-left interface orientation, which is a common localization strategy in many markets, are what define the Israeli user interface&#x27;s localization, and in some regions, Netflix offers a more affordable mobile-only subscription.

===Subscriptions===
Customers can subscribe to one of three plans; the difference in plans relates to video resolution, the number of simultaneous streams, and the number of devices to which content can be downloaded.

At the end of Q1 2022, Netflix estimated that 100 million households globally were sharing passwords to their account with others. In March 2022, Netflix began to charge a fee for additional users in Chile, Peru, and Costa Rica to attempt to control account sharing. On July 18, 2022, Netflix announced that it would test the account sharing feature in more countries, including Argentina, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. On October 17, Netflix launched Profile Transfer to help end account sharing.

On July 13, 2022, Netflix announced plans to launch an advertising-supported subscription option. Netflix&#x27;s planned advertising tier would not allow subscribers to download content like the existing ad-free platform. On July 20, 2022, it was announced that the advertising-supported tier would be coming to Netflix in 2023 but it would not feature the full library of content. In October, the launch date was announced as November 3, 2022, and was launched in 12 countries: United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, Japan and South Korea. The ad-supported plan was called &quot;Basic with Ads&quot; and it cost $6.99 per month in the United States at launch.

On February 24, 2023, Netflix cut subscription prices in more than 30 countries around the world to attract more subscribers from those countries. Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Croatia, Venezuela, Kenya, and Iran are on the list of countries where the cost for a subscription will be reduced. In the same month stronger anti-password-sharing rules were expanded to Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain. In May 2023, these measures were further expanded to United States and Brazil subscribers.

In July 2023, Netflix added 5.9 million subscribers for the second quarter of the year for a total of 238.39 million subscribers overall. The United States and Canada accounted for 1.2 million subscribers which was the largest regional quarterly gain since 2021.

Netflix announced in February that it was going to enforce stricter regulations for password sharing. In May 2023, Netflix began cracking down on password-sharing in the US, UK, and Australia. Under these new rules, multiple people can use and share one account, but they have to be under the same household. Netflix defines a household as people who live in the same location as the owner of the account. Users are asked to set a primary location based on the device&#x27;s IP address.

Netflix reported 8.05 million new subscribers in Q2 2024, up from 5.9 million subscribers added in Q2 2023.

In July 2024, Netflix started phasing out its cheapest subscription plan for users in France and the US, a year after the plan was removed for Canada and the UK. Members in these countries have the option to sign up for either the standard ad-free plan or the ad plan.

=== Device support ===
Netflix can be accessed via a web browser, while Netflix apps are available on various platforms, including Blu-ray players, tablet computers, mobile phones, smart TVs, digital media players, and video game consoles. Currently supported game consoles include:
* Microsoft Xbox 360, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S
* Sony PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5

Several older devices no longer support Netflix. For home gaming consoles, this includes the PlayStation 2, PlayStation TV, Wii and Wii U. For handheld gaming consoles, this includes the Nintendo 3DS family of systems and the PlayStation Vita. The second and third generation Apple TV previously supported Netflix with an ad-free plan, but the app was automatically removed on these devices on July 31, 2024.

In addition, a growing number of multichannel television providers, including cable television and IPTV services, have added Netflix apps accessible within their own set-top boxes, sometimes with the ability for its content (along with those of other online video services) to be presented within a unified search interface alongside linear television programming as an &quot;all-in-one&quot; solution.

The maximum video resolution supported on computers is dependent on the DRM systems available on a particular operating system and web browser.

== Content ==
=== Original programming ===

&quot;Netflix Originals&quot; are content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed exclusively by Netflix. Netflix funds its original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series. It keeps licensing rights, which normally give production companies future revenue opportunities from syndication, merchandising, etc.

Over the years, Netflix output ballooned to a level unmatched by any television network or streaming service. According to &quot;Variety Insight&quot;, Netflix produced a total of 240 new original shows and movies in 2018, then climbed to 371 in 2019, a figure &quot;greater than the number of original series that the entire U.S. TV industry released in 2005.&quot; The Netflix budget allocated to production increased annually, reaching $13.6 billion in 2021 and projected to hit $18.9 billion by 2025, a figure that once again overshadowed any of its competitors. As of August 2022, original productions made up 50% of Netflix&#x27;s overall library in the United States.

=== Film and television deals ===
Netflix has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms.

Distributors that have licensed content to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment and previously The Walt Disney Studios. Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Walt Disney Television, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, PBS, Warner Bros. Television and Paramount Global Content Distribution, along with titles from other companies such as ABS-CBN Studios, GMA Pictures, Cignal Entertainment, MQ Studios, Regal Entertainment, Viva Films, MNC Media, Screenplay Films, Soraya Intercine Films, , , Rapi Films, , CJ ENM, JTBC, Kakao Entertainment, TBS, TV Asahi, Fuji TV, Mediacorp, Primeworks Studios, GMM Grammy, Public Television Service, Gala Television, ITV Studios, Hasbro Entertainment and StudioCanal. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to select television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution, Sony Pictures Television and 20th Century Fox Television.

Netflix negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as &quot;The Lorax&quot;, &quot;ParaNorman&quot;, and &quot;Minions&quot;.

Netflix holds exclusive streaming rights to the film library of Studio Ghibli (except &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;) worldwide except in the U.S. and Japan as part of an agreement signed with Ghibli&#x27;s international sales holder Wild Bunch in 2020.

=== Netflix Games ===
In July 2021, Netflix hired Mike Verdu, a former executive from Electronic Arts and Facebook, as vice president of game development, along with plans to add video games by 2022. Netflix announced plans to release mobile games that would be included in subscribers&#x27; service plans. Trial offerings were first launched for Netflix users in Poland in August 2021, offering premium mobile games based on &quot;Stranger Things&quot; including &quot;Stranger Things 3: The Game&quot;, for free to subscribers through the Netflix mobile app.

Netflix officially launched mobile games on November 2, 2021, for Android users around the world. Through the app, subscribers had free access to five games, including two previously made &quot;Stranger Things&quot; titles. Netflix intends to add more games to this service over time. On November 9, the collection launched for iOS. Verdu said in October 2022 that besides continuing to expand their portfolio of games, they were also interested in cloud gaming options.

To support the games effort, Netflix began acquiring and forming a number of studios. The company acquired Night School Studio, an independent video game developer, in September 2021. Netflix announced plans to acquire Next Games in March 2022 for as part of Netflix&#x27;s expansions into gaming. Next Games had developed the mobile title &quot;Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales&quot; as well as two &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; mobile games. Later in the month, Netflix also acquired the Texas-based mobile game developer, Boss Fight Entertainment, for an undisclosed sum. Netflix opened a mobile game studio in Helsinki, Finland in September 2022, and a new studio, their fifth overall, in southern California in October 2022, alongside the acquisition of Spry Fox in Seattle.

In June 2024, Verdu was moved into a new role focusing on &quot;innovation in game development.&quot; The next month, Netflix hired Alain Tascan, vice president of game development at Epic Games, to head up Netflix Games. As of July 2024, Netflix has over 80 games in development, releasing at least one game each month to attract fans. The company shut down its Southern California &quot;Team Blue&quot; AAA gaming studio in October 2024, leading to the departure of developers like &quot;Overwatch&quot; producer Chacko Sonny, &quot;Halo&quot; veteran Joseph Staten and &quot;God of War&quot; art director Rafael Grassetti. Netflix indicated that it maintains a commitment to grow its gaming business despite the changes. In late October, Netflix announced several games based on hit series including Netflix Stories: Outer Banks, Netflix Stories: A Perfect Couple, Netflix Stories: A Virgin River Christmas, and The Ultimatum: Choices, as well as a new daily word game in partnership with TED Talks, TED Tumblewords.

== Technology ==
=== Content delivery ===
Netflix freely peers with Internet service providers (ISPs) directly and at common Internet exchange points. In June 2012, a custom content delivery network, Open Connect, was announced. For larger ISPs with over 100,000 subscribers, Netflix offers free &quot;Netflix Open Connect&quot; computer appliances that cache their content within the ISPs&#x27; data centers or networks to further reduce Internet transit costs. By August 2016, Netflix closed its last physical data center, but continued to develop its Open Connect technology. A 2016 study at the University of London detected 233 individual Open Connect locations on over six continents, with the largest amount of traffic in the US, followed by Mexico.

As of July 2017, Netflix series and movies accounted for more than a third of all prime-time download Internet traffic in North America.

=== API ===
On October 1, 2008, Netflix offered access to its service via a public application programming interface (API). It allowed access to data for all Netflix titles, and allows users to manage their movie queues. The API was free and allowed commercial use. In June 2012, Netflix began to restrict the availability of its public API. Netflix instead focused on a small number of known partners using private interfaces, since most traffic came from those private interfaces. In November 2014, Netflix retired the public API. Netflix then partnered with the developers of eight services deemed the most valuable, including Instant Watcher, Fanhattan, Yidio and Nextguide.

=== Recommendations and thumbnails ===

Netflix presents viewers with recommendations based on interactions with the service, such as previous viewing history and ratings of viewed content. These are often grouped into genres and formats, or feature the platform&#x27;s highest-rated content. Each title is presented with a thumbnail. Before around 2015, these were the same key art for everyone, but since then has been customized. Netflix may select a specific key art for a thumbnail based on viewing history, such as an actor or scene type based on genre preferences. Some thumbnails are generated from video stills.

The Netflix recommendation system is a vital part of the streaming platform&#x27;s success, enabling personalized content suggestions for hundreds of millions of subscribers worldwide. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, Netflix analyzes user interactions, including viewing history, searches, and ratings, to deliver personalized recommendations for movies and TV shows.

The recommendation system considers individual user preferences, similarities with other users with comparable tastes, specific title attributes (genre, release year, etc.), device usage patterns, and viewing time. As users interact with the platform and provide feedback with their viewing habits, the recommendation system is able to adapt and refine its suggestions over time. Netflix uses a two-tiered ranking system, using the presentation of titles on the homepage for easy navigation to maximize user engagement. This is done by organizing content into rows and ranking the titles within each row based on how much the user would be interested in it. Netflix also uses A/B testing to determine what causes the biggest interest and engagement related to options concerning movie suggestions and how titles are organized.

Tags like &quot;bittersweet&quot;, &quot;sitcom&quot;, or &quot;intimate&quot; are assigned to each title by Netflix employees. Netflix also uses the tags to create recommendation micro-genres like &quot;Goofy TV Shows&quot; or &quot;Girls Night In&quot;.

== Awards ==
On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Awards nominations for original streaming programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its series, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, &quot;Hemlock Grove&quot; and &quot;House of Cards&quot;, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for &quot;House of Cards&quot;, three for &quot;Arrested Development&quot; and two for &quot;Hemlock Grove&quot;). The &quot;House of Cards&quot; episode &quot;Chapter 1&quot; received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first episode of a streaming television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination. With its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, &quot;Chapter 1&quot; became the first episode from a streaming service to be awarded an Emmy. David Fincher&#x27;s win for Directing for a Drama Series for &quot;House of Cards&quot; made the episode the first from a streaming service to win a Primetime Emmy.

On November 6, 2013, Netflix earned its first Grammy nomination when You&#x27;ve Got Time by Regina Spektor—the main title theme song for &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;—was nominated for Best Song Written for Visual Media.

On December 12, 2013, the network earned six nominations for Golden Globe Awards, including four for &quot;House of Cards&quot;. Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for a streaming television series.

Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew, and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba&#x27;s recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show&#x27;s second season).

Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy Award nominations, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable. The 16 Netflix nominees were: &quot;House of Cards&quot; with Kevin Spacey, &quot;A Very Murray Christmas&quot; with Bill Murray, &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot;, &quot;Master of None&quot;, and &quot;Bloodline&quot;.

At the 90th Academy Awards, held on March 4, 2018, the film &quot;Icarus&quot;, distributed by Netflix, won its first Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film. During his remarks backstage, director and writer Bryan Fogel remarked that Netflix had &quot;single-handedly changed the documentary world.&quot; &quot;Icarus&quot; had its premiere at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and was bought by Netflix for $5 million, one of the biggest deals ever for a non-fiction film. Netflix became the network whose programs received more nomination at the 2018 Primetime and Creative Arts Emmy Awards with 112 nominations, therefore breaking HBO&#x27;s 17-years record as a network whose programs received more nomination at the Emmys, which received 108 nominations.

On January 22, 2019, films distributed by Netflix scored 15 nominations for the 91st Academy Awards, including Academy Award for Best Picture for Alfonso Cuarón&#x27;s &quot;Roma&quot;, which was nominated for 10 awards. The 15 nominations equal the total nominations films distributed by Netflix had received in previous years.

In 2020, Netflix received 20 TV nominations and films distributed by Netflix also got 22 film nominations at the 78th Golden Globe Awards. It secured three out of the five nominations for best drama TV series for &quot;The Crown&quot;, &quot;Ozark&quot; and &quot;Ratched&quot; and four of the five nominations for best actress in a TV series: Olivia Colman, Emma Corrin, Laura Linney and Sarah Paulson.

In 2020, Netflix earned 24 Academy Award nominations, marking the first time a streaming service led all studios.

At the 50th International Emmy Awards, Netflix original &quot;Sex Education&quot; won Best Comedy Series. Later that year, Netflix received 26 Emmy Awards including six for &quot;Squid Game&quot;. The &quot;Squid Game&quot; wins for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series were the first-ever for a non-English language series in those categories.

In March 2023, Netflix won six Academy Awards including four for &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; which was the most awarded Netflix film in its history. &quot;Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s Pinocchio&quot; was the first streaming film to named Best Animated Feature and &quot;The Elephant Whisperers&quot; was the first Indian-produced film to receive Best Documentary Short Film.

== Criticism ==
Netflix has been subject to criticism from various groups and individuals as its popularity and market reach increased in the 2010s.

Customers have complained about price increases in Netflix offerings dating back to the company&#x27;s decision to separate its DVD rental and streaming services, which was quickly reversed. As Netflix increased its streaming output, it has faced calls to limit accessibility to graphic violence and include viewer advisories for issues such as sensationalism and promotion of pseudoscience. Netflix&#x27;s content has also been criticized by disability rights movement advocates for lack of closed captioning quality.

Some media organizations and competitors have criticized Netflix for selectively releasing ratings and viewer numbers of its original programming. The company has made claims boasting about viewership records without providing data to substantiate its successes or using problematic estimation methods. In March 2020, some government agencies called for Netflix and other streamers to limit services due to increased broadband and energy consumption as use of the platform increased. In response, the company announced it would reduce bit rate across all streams in Europe, thus decreasing Netflix traffic on European networks by around 25 percent. These same steps were later taken in India.

In May 2022, Netflix&#x27;s shareholder Imperium Irrevocable Trust filed a lawsuit against the company for violating the U.S. securities laws. In January 2024, a federal judge dismissed the suit, stating that shareholders failed to provide instances of Netflix lying about subscriber growth.

In May 2023, Netflix officially banned the use of password sharing between individuals of different households, meaning sharing an account was only available to those living in the same house. After reporting a record number of new subscribers in Q4 2024, Netflix raised prices
in early 2025.

<doc id="175541" wikidata="Q202570" url="?curid=175541" title="Ferris wheel">
<text>A Ferris wheel (also called a big wheel, giant wheel or an observation wheel) is an amusement ride consisting of a rotating upright wheel with multiple passenger-carrying components (commonly referred to as passenger cars, cabins, tubs, gondolas, capsules, or pods) attached to the rim in such a way that as the wheel turns, they are kept upright, usually by gravity. Some of the largest modern Ferris wheels have cars mounted on the outside of the rim, with electric motors to independently rotate each car to keep it upright. These cars are often referred to as capsules or pods.

The original Ferris Wheel was designed and constructed by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. as a landmark for the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago; although much smaller wooden wheels of similar idea predate Ferris&#x27;s wheel, dating perhaps to the 1500s. The generic term &quot;Ferris wheel&quot;, now used in American English for all such structures, has become the very common type of amusement ride at amusement parks, state fairs, and other fairs or carnivals in the United States.

The tallest Ferris wheel is the Ain Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, which opened in October 2021.

==Terminology and design==

The term &quot;Ferris wheel&quot; comes from the maker of one of the first examples constructed for Chicago&#x27;s World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. in 1893.

Modern versions have been called &quot;observation wheels&quot;. In 1892, when the incorporation papers for the Ferris Wheel Company (constructors of the original 1893 Chicago Ferris Wheel) were filed, the purpose of the company was stated as: [construction and operation of] &quot;wheels of the Ferris or other types for the purpose of observation or amusement&quot;.

Design variations include single- (cantilevered) or twin-sided support for the wheel, and whether the cars or capsules are oriented upright by gravity or by electric motors. The most prevalent design is the use of twin-sided support and gravity-oriented capsules.

==Early history==


&quot;Pleasure wheels&quot;, whose passengers rode in chairs suspended from large wooden rings turned by strong men, may have originated in 17th-century Bulgaria.

&quot;The Travels of Peter Mundy in Europe and Asia, 1608–1667&quot; describes and illustrates &quot;severall Sorts of Swinginge used in their Publique rejoyceings att their Feast of Biram&quot; on 17 May 1620 at Philippopolis (now Plovdiv) in the Ottoman Balkans. Among means &quot;lesse dangerous and troublesome&quot; was one: 

Five years earlier, in 1615, Pietro Della Valle, a Roman traveller who sent letters from Constantinople, Persia, and India, attended a Ramadan festival in Constantinople. He describes the fireworks, floats, and great swings, then comments on riding the Great Wheel:

Similar wheels also appeared in England in the 17th century, and subsequently elsewhere around the world, including India, Romania, and Siberia.

A Frenchman, Antonio Manguino, introduced the idea to America in 1848, when he constructed a wooden pleasure wheel to attract visitors to his start-up fair in Walton Spring, Georgia.

===Somers&#x27; Wheel===

In 1892, William Somers installed three fifty-foot wooden wheels at Asbury Park, New Jersey; Atlantic City, New Jersey; and Coney Island, New York. The following year he was granted the first U.S. patent for a &quot;Roundabout&quot;. George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. rode on Somers&#x27; wheel in Atlantic City prior to designing his wheel for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. In 1893 Somers filed a lawsuit against Ferris for patent infringement; however, Ferris and his lawyers successfully argued that the Ferris Wheel and its technology differed greatly from Somers&#x27; wheel, and the case was dismissed.

===The original Ferris Wheel===
The original Ferris wheel, sometimes referred to as the Chicago Wheel, was designed and constructed by Ferris Jr. and opened in 1893; however, an earlier wheel was created for the New York State fair in 1854, created by two Erie Canal workers.

With a height of , it was the tallest attraction at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois, where it opened to the public on June 21, 1893. It was intended to rival the Eiffel Tower, the centerpiece of the 1889 Paris Exposition.

Ferris was a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, bridge-builder. He began his career in the railroad industry and then pursued an interest in bridge building. Ferris understood the growing need for structural steel and founded G.W.G. Ferris &amp; Co. in Pittsburgh, a firm that tested and inspected metals for railroads and bridge builders.

The wheel rotated on a 71-ton, axle comprising what was at that time the world&#x27;s largest hollow forging, manufactured in Pittsburgh by the Bethlehem Iron Company and weighing , together with two cast-iron spiders weighing .

There were 36 cars, each fitted with 40 revolving chairs and able to accommodate up to 60 people, giving a total capacity of 2,160. The wheel carried some 38,000 passengers daily and took 20 minutes to complete two revolutions, the first involving six stops to allow passengers to exit and enter and the second a nine-minute non-stop rotation, for which the ticket holder paid 50 cents.

The Exposition ended in October 1893, and the wheel closed in April 1894 and was dismantled and stored until the following year. It was then rebuilt on Chicago&#x27;s North Side, near the high-income enclave of Lincoln Park. William D. Boyce, then a local resident, filed a Circuit Court action against the owners of the wheel to have it removed, but without success. It operated there from October 1895 until 1903, when it was again dismantled, then transported by rail to St. Louis for the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair and finally destroyed by controlled demolition using dynamite on May 11, 1906.

===Antique Ferris wheels===
The Wiener Riesenrad (German for &quot;Viennese Giant Wheel&quot;) is a surviving example of 19th-century Ferris wheels. Erected in 1897 in the Wurstelprater section of Prater public park in the Leopoldstadt district of Vienna, Austria, to celebrate Emperor Franz Josef I&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, it has a height of and originally had 30 passenger cars. A demolition permit for the Riesenrad was issued in 1916, but due to a lack of funds with which to carry out the destruction, it survived.

Following the demolition of the Grande Roue de Paris in 1920, the Riesenrad became the world&#x27;s tallest extant Ferris wheel. In 1944 it burnt down, but was rebuilt the following year with 15 passenger cars, and remained the world&#x27;s tallest extant wheel until its 97th year, when the Technocosmos was constructed for Expo &#x27;85, at Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.

Still in operation today, it is one of Vienna&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions, and over the years has featured in numerous films (including &quot;Madame Solange d`Atalide&quot; (1914), &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; (1948), &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987), &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; (1995) and novels.

==World&#x27;s tallest Ferris wheels==

Chronology of world&#x27;s tallest wheels

* 1893: the original Ferris Wheel was tall. Built for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois, it was moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1904 for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and demolished there in 1906.
* 1895: the Great Wheel was built for the Empire of India Exhibition at Earls Court, London, UK, and was tall. Construction began in March 1894 and it opened to the public on July 17, 1895. It stayed in service until 1906 and was demolished in 1907, having carried over 2.5 million passengers.
* 1900: the Grande Roue de Paris was built for the Exposition Universelle, a world&#x27;s fair held in Paris, France. It was demolished in 1920, but its height was not surpassed until almost 90 years after its construction.

Timeline

===Future wheels===
Following the huge success of the London Eye since it opened in 2000, giant Ferris wheels have been proposed for many other cities; however, a large number of these projects have stalled or failed.

====Construction in progress====

*Isfahan Eye, a Ferris wheel in Mount Soffeh, Iran, under development by the city&#x27;s municipality. It will be built with a financed 1000 billion toman.
* The Nanjing OCT Funland Ferris Wheel has passed national inspections in early 2023 and is about to open to the public.

====Abandoned projects====

* The Skyvue Las Vegas Super Wheel (or SkyVue—the official website uses both) was announced as being tall, and later reported as and . It was approved by Clark County Commission in March 2011, and announced at a groundbreaking ceremony in May 2011 that &quot;We expect it to be up and running in time for New Year&#x27;s 2012&quot;. The completion date for its construction on the Las Vegas Strip was subsequently put back several times. , construction had stalled. The project was eventually canceled due to lack of funding and the property was put up for sale in 2020, and again in 2022.
* The New York Wheel was first reported in June 2012 and officially announced by mayor Michael Bloomberg in September 2012. Construction at Staten Island, New York City, alongside the planned Empire Outlets retail complex, was originally planned to begin early in 2014, and completion was originally expected to be in 2015. In October 2014 it was reported that construction would not begin until 2015, with completion delayed until 2017. This was subsequently further pushed back to April 2018, and then delayed indefinitely after developer NY Wheel fired lead contractor Mammoet-Starneth LLC in July 2017 amid a legal dispute over missed design and construction deadlines. In May 2018, the developers of the New York Wheel were given a last chance to obtain funding for the project. As per a ruling in Delaware bankruptcy court, the developers had 120 days, or until September 5, to find funding; however, on September 7, 2018, it was announced that the New York Wheel would not receive $140 million in city funding. The delays caused concern among EB-5 visa investors, who would lose their visas if the project was not constructed. An amendment to the bankruptcy court&#x27;s ruling gave the developers a final 120-day extension to look for funding. If the developers did not get funding by January 2019, the project would be canceled and no further funding extensions would be given. On September 21, 2018, mayor Bill de Blasio said that the now-$900-million project would not receive a bailout from the city because it was too risky to support the project with bonds. As such, the city would not support tax free status for a $380 million bond sale to complete the project. Investors refused to proceed with construction without city support, and stated that it would allow the parts for the Ferris wheel to be auctioned off if the city did not provide funding. Subsequently, investors decided to cancel the project. At this point, investors had spent $450 million on the project.

====Quiescent proposals====

Incomplete, delayed, stalled, cancelled, failed, or abandoned proposals:
* The Moscow View, proposed in 2011, was to have featured 48 monorail-mounted passenger capsules, each able to carry 48 passengers, travelling around a centreless non-rotating rim. At that time the timeframe for its construction was unknown and its site within Moscow had yet to be selected, though candidates were said to include the All-Russia Exhibition Centre, Gorky Park, Prospekt Vernadskogo, and Sparrow Hills. In December 2011 the project was reported to be stalled due to lack of City Hall approval.
* The Beijing Great Wheel was originally due to begin construction in 2007 and to open in 2008, but went into receivership in 2010. It was one of at least five Great Wheel Corporation giant Ferris wheel projects which failed between 2007 and 2010.
* The Baghdad Eye was proposed for Baghdad, Iraq, in August 2008. At that time, three possible locations had been identified, but no estimates of cost or completion date were given. In October 2008, it was reported that Al-Zawraa Park was expected to be the site, and a wheel was installed there in March 2011.
* The Great Dubai Wheel proposed for Dubailand, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was granted planning permission in 2006 and expected to open in 2009, but it was subsequently confirmed that it would not be built. It was one of at least five Great Wheel Corporation giant Ferris wheel projects which failed between 2007 and 2010.
* The Voyager was proposed several times for Las Vegas, Nevada.
* The Bangkok Eye, to be located near the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, Thailand, was announced by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration on October 13, 2010, at which time the actual site and means of funding the 30-billion baht project had yet to be determined.

* The Great Berlin Wheel was originally planned to open in 2008 but the project encountered financial obstacles. It was one of at least five Great Wheel Corporation giant Ferris wheel projects which failed between 2007 and 2010.
* The Jeddah Eye was proposed in 2008, as part of a development scheduled to open in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Construction was to have begun in 2009, but there were no subsequent announcements. It was one of at least five Great Wheel Corporation giant Ferris wheel projects which failed between 2007 and 2010.
* A Ferris wheel project involving Tussauds was considered for New York City&#x27;s South Street Seaport in 2004, but was never built.
* The Great Orlando Wheel was announced in June 2008 but then suspended in early 2009 after losing its funding. It was one of at least five Great Wheel Corporation giant Ferris wheel projects which failed between 2007 and 2010.
* The Kolkata Eye was first proposed in 2011 for construction on the banks of Hooghly River in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. Favoured by Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal, the project was originally valued at 100 crore rupees. This had risen to 300 crore rupees by May 2014 when Banerjee tweeted is expected to be ready in a year&#x27;s time&quot;. In January 2015 &quot;The Times of India&quot; reported that the project was &quot;still a pipe dream&quot;.
* A wheel for Manchester, England, was proposed by Manchester City Council in 2010 as a replacement for the transportable Wheel of Manchester installation, with Piccadilly Gardens the possible site and completion expected by Christmas 2011.
* The Eye on Malaysia, a Chinese-manufactured wheel with 54 passenger gondolas, was scheduled to begin operating in April 2013 at Malacca Island, Malaysia. In November 2012, Chief Minister of the state of Malacca Datuk Seri Mohd Ali Rustam stated that the installation of piles had brought the RM40 million wheel to 15 per cent of completion, and that &quot;the installation of the wheel structure will begin in February [2013].&quot; Mohd Ali Rustam had previously announced the Malaysia Eye, which conflicting reports stated would be or tall, also to be sourced from China and located at Malacca Island, and to have 54 air-conditioned gondolas, each able to carry six people. It was scheduled to open on December 1, 2011, but was never built.
* A wheel planned for Manchester, England, for 2008, was never constructed.
* The Pepsi Globe was proposed for the planned Meadowlands complex in New Jersey in February 2008 and originally due to open in 2009, then put on hold until 2010. It has since been further delayed, and construction of the host complex, originally due to be completed in 2007, has been stalled since 2009 due to financing problems.
Nippon Moon, described as a &quot;giant observation wheel&quot; by its designers, was reported in September 2013 to be &quot;currently in development&quot;. At that time, its height was &quot;currently undisclosed&quot;, but &quot;almost twice the scale of the wheel in London&quot;. Its location, an unspecified Japanese city, was &quot;currently under wraps&quot;, and its funding had &quot;yet to be entirely secured&quot;. Commissioned by Ferris Wheel Investment Co., Ltd., and designed by UNStudio in collaboration with Arup, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Experientia, it was expected to have 32 individually themed capsules and take 40 minutes to rotate once.

The Shanghai Star, initially planned as a tall wheel to be built by 2005, was revised to , with a completion date set in 2007, but then cancelled in 2006 due to &quot;political incorrectness&quot;. An earlier proposal for a structure, the Shanghai Kiss, with capsules ascending and descending a pair of towers which met at their peaks instead of a wheel, was deemed too expensive at £100m.

Rus-3000, a wheel planned to open in 2004 in Moscow, has since been reported cancelled. Subsequently, an approximately wheel was considered for Gorky Central Park of Culture and Leisure, and a wheel proposed for location near Sparrow Hills. Another giant wheel planned for Prospekt Vernadskogo for 2002 was also never built.
==Variants==
=== Indoor Ferris wheels ===

At some malls and amusement parks indoor Ferris wheels were realized. The largest of its kind has a diameter of and is situated in the high Alem Cultural and Entertainment Center in Ashgabat.

=== Motorised capsules ===

Wheels with passenger cars mounted external to the rim and independently rotated by electric motors, as opposed to wheels with cars suspended from the rim and kept upright by gravity, are uncommon. Typically they are called &#x27;Observation wheels&#x27; but there is no standardised terminology.

Only a few Ferris wheels with motorised capsules have been built.
* The Bay Glory is China&#x27;s first giant observation wheel with motorised capsules.
* The Ain Dubai, world&#x27;s current tallest observation wheel.
* The High Roller, world&#x27;s tallest from 2014 to 2021, has externally mounted motorised capsules of a transparent spherical design, and is described as both a Ferris wheel and an observation wheel by the media.
* The Singapore Flyer has cylindrical externally mounted motorised capsules and is described as an observation wheel by its operators, but was also credited as &quot;world&#x27;s largest Ferris wheel&quot; by the media when it opened in 2008.
* The London Eye, typically described as a &quot;giant Ferris wheel&quot; by the media, has ovoidal externally mounted motorised capsules and is the &quot;world&#x27;s tallest cantilevered observation wheel&quot; according to its operator.
* The Melbourne Star (previously the Southern Star) in Australia has ovoidal externally mounted motorised capsules and is described by its operators as &quot;the only observation wheel in the southern hemisphere&quot;, but also as a Ferris wheel by the media.
* The Nanjing OCT Funland Ferris Wheel is China&#x27;s second giant observation wheel with motorised capsules which has passed national inspections in early 2023 and is about to open to the public.

Official conceptual renderings of the proposed New York Wheel also show a wheel equipped with externally mounted motorised capsules.

===Centreless wheels===

In the centreless (sometimes called hubless or spokeless) wheel design, there is no central hub and the rim of the wheel stays fixed in place. Instead, each car travels around the circumference of the rim. The first centreless wheel built was the Big O at Tokyo Dome City in Japan. Its height has since been surpassed by the high Bailang River Bridge Ferris Wheel on the upper deck of the Bailang River Bridge in Shandong Province, China, which opened in 2017.

The first centreless wheel in North America opened in January 2019 at the indoor Méga Parc in Quebec City, Canada. The wheel at Méga Parc was designed and manufactured by Larson International.

===Transportable wheels===
Transportable Ferris wheels are designed to be operated at multiple locations, as opposed to fixed wheels which are usually intended for permanent installation. Small transportable designs may be permanently mounted on trailers, and can be moved intact. Larger transportable wheels are designed to be repeatedly dismantled and rebuilt, some using water ballast instead of the permanent foundations of their fixed counterparts. Larger transportable wheels were designed with a self erecting mechanism in the absent of mobile cranes reaching high enough since 1958 in Europe. Spokes must be stiff beeing able to carry their own weight for assembling the wheel without auxillary scaffolding.
Fixed wheels are also sometimes dismantled and relocated. Larger examples include the original Ferris Wheel, which operated at two sites in Chicago, Illinois, and a third in St. Louis, Missouri; Technocosmos/Technostar, which moved to Expoland, Osaka, after Expo &#x27;85, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, for which it was built, ended; and Cosmo Clock 21, which added onto its original height when erected for the second time at Minato Mirai 21, Yokohama, in 1999.

The world&#x27;s tallest transportable wheel is the Bussink Design R80XL.
One of the most famous transportable wheels is the Roue de Paris, originally installed on the Place de la Concorde in Paris for the 2000 millennium celebrations. Roue de Paris left France in 2002 and in 2003–04 operated in Birmingham and Manchester, England. In 2005 it visited first Geleen then Amsterdam, Netherlands, before returning to England to operate at Gateshead. In 2006 it was erected at the Suan Lum Night Bazaar in Bangkok, Thailand, and by 2008 had made its way to Antwerp, Belgium.

Roue de Paris is a Ronald Bussink series R60 design using of water ballast to provide a stable base. The R60 weighs , and can be erected in 72 hours and dismantled in 60 hours by a specialist team. Transport requires seven 20-foot container lorries, ten open trailer lorries, and one closed trailer lorry. Its 42-passenger cars can be loaded either 3 or 6 at a time, and each car can carry 8 people. Bussink R60 wheels have operated in Australia (Brisbane), Canada (Niagara Falls), France (Paris), Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur &amp; Malacca), México (Puebla), UK (Belfast, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield), US (Atlanta, Myrtle Beach), and elsewhere.

Other notable transportable wheels include the Steiger Ferris Wheel, which was the world&#x27;s tallest transportable wheel when it began operating in 1980. It has 42 passenger cars, and weighs 450 tons. On October 11, 2010, it collapsed at the Kramermarkt in Oldenburg, Germany, during deconstruction.


===Double and triple wheels===
A double Ferris wheel designed to include a horizontal turntable was patented in 1939 by John F. Courtney, working for Velare &amp; Courtney. In Courtney&#x27;s design, there were two independent Ferris wheels, each rotating at either end of a cantilever arm. The cantilever arm was supported in the middle by a tall vertical support, and the cantilever arm itself rotated around its middle pivot point. The design was similar to the earlier Aeriocycle, but the double wheel patented by Courtney allowed the cantilever arm to make a complete rotation, while the Aeriocycle was limited to a seesaw motion. Courtney continued to file additional patents on improved designs through the 1950s to make them more portable, and at about the same time, the Velare brothers patented the &quot;Space Wheel&quot;, a side-by-side double with four total Ferris wheels.

The design was later sold to the Allan Herschell Company in 1959 and marketed as the &quot;Sky Wheel&quot;; the first sale as the Sky Wheel was to 20th Century Rides in October 1960. The Sky Wheel seated up to 32 riders in 16 two-person cars, with 8 cars per wheel, and riders reached a peak of approximately . The height and popularity of the Sky Wheel was eclipsed by larger single wheels in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and it has since largely disappeared from common use. , there are four known Sky Wheels that remain in operation.

In March 1966, Thomas Glen Robinson and Ralph G. Robinson received a patent for a Planetary Amusement Ride, which was a distinct double wheel design. In the Robinsons&#x27; patent, the cantilever arm was bent at a slightly obtuse angle, and the cars were carried on a spoked &quot;spider&quot; rotating structure at each end of the cantilever. With the obtuse-angle cantilever, one spider could be lowered to the ground in a horizontal plane so that all the cars on that spider could be unloaded and loaded simultaneously, while the spider on the other end of the cantilever would continue to rotate in a near-vertical plane.

Robinson sold two of these rides – Astrowheel, which operated at the former Six Flags AstroWorld in Houston, Texas, and Galaxy, which operated at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. Both were manufactured by Astron International Corporation. Astrowheel was part of the original lineup of rides when Astroworld opened in 1968; it was removed in 1981 to make way for the Warp 10 ride. Astrowheel had an eight-spoked spider at the end of each arm, and each tip had a separate car for eight cars in total on each end. In contrast, Galaxy had double the capacity with a four-spoked spider at the end of each arm; each tip bore an independent four-spoked sub-spider for sixteen cars in total on each end. Like Astrowheel, Galaxy was part of the lineup at Magic Mountain when the park opened in 1971, and was removed in 1980 when Six Flags took over ownership of both parks.
Swiss broker Intamin marketed a similar series of double wheels manufactured by Waagner-Biro, comprising a vertical column supporting a straight cantilever arm, with each end of the cantilever arm ending in a spoked Ferris wheel. The first Intamin produced was Giant Wheel at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania, which operated from 1973 to 2004. Other double wheels made by Waagner-Biro/Intamin include Zodiac (Kings Island, Mason, Ohio; 1975–86; moved to Wonderland Sydney and operated 1989–2004), Scorpion (Parque de la Ciudad, Buenos Aires, Argentina; 1982–2003), and Double Wheel (Kuwait Entertainment City, Kuwait City, Kuwait; 1984–91).

A triple variant was custom designed for the Marriott Corporation and debuted at both Marriott&#x27;s Great America parks (now Six Flags Great America, Gurnee, Illinois, and California&#x27;s Great America, Santa Clara) in 1976 as Sky Whirl. Each ride had three main components: the three spiders/wheels with their passenger cars; the triple-spoked supporting arm; and the single central supporting column. Each wheel rotated about one of the three ends of the supporting arm. The supporting arm would in turn rotate around its central hub as a single unit about the top of the supporting column. The axis about which the supporting arm turned was offset from vertical (i.e., the plane of rotation was not horizontal), so that as the supporting arm rotated, each wheel was raised and lowered. When lowered, one wheel was horizontal at ground level. At the same time, the other wheels remained raised and continued to rotate in a near-vertical plane at considerable height. The lowered horizontal wheel was brought to a standstill for simultaneous loading and unloading of all its passenger cars.

The Sky Whirl was also known as a triple Ferris wheel, Triple Giant Wheel, or Triple Tree Wheel; it was in height. The Sky Whirl in Santa Clara was filmed for a memorable rescue scene in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; (renamed to &quot;The Spider&quot; for the film). The Santa Clara ride, renamed Triple Wheel in post-Marriott years, closed on September 1, 1997. The Gurnee ride closed in 2000. Two triple wheels were built for Asian clients: Tree Triple Wheel at Seibu-en (Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan; 1985–2004) and Hydra at Lotte World (Seoul, South Korea; 1989–97).

===Eccentric wheels===
An eccentric wheel (sometimes called a sliding wheel or coaster wheel) differs from a conventional Ferris wheel in that some or all of its passenger cars are not fixed directly to the rim of the wheel, but instead slide on rails between the rim and the hub as the wheel rotates.

The two most famous eccentric wheels are Wonder Wheel, at Deno&#x27;s Wonder Wheel Amusement Park, Coney Island, US, and Pixar Pal-A-Round (previously Sun Wheel and Mickey&#x27;s Fun Wheel), at Disney California Adventure, US. The latter is a replica of the former. There is a second replica in Yokohama Dreamland, Japan.

Pixar Pal-A-Round is tall and has 24 fully enclosed passenger cars, each able to carry six passengers. Each passenger car is decorated with the face of a Pixar character. Sixteen slide inward and outward as the wheel rotates, the remainder are fixed to the rim. There are separate boarding queues for sliding and fixed cars, so that passengers may choose between the two. Inspired by Coney Island&#x27;s 1920 Wonder Wheel, it was designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and Waagner Biro, completed in 2001 as the Sun Wheel, later refurbished and reopened in 2009 as Mickey&#x27;s Fun Wheel, and again rethemed as Pixar Pal-A-Round in 2018.

Wonder Wheel was built in 1920, is tall, and can carry 144 people.

<text>The Dilberito was a vegetarian microwave burrito introduced in 1999 by Scott Adams Foods, Inc. and named after the comic strip character Dilbert. The product went out of production in 2003.

First announced in &quot;The Dilbert Future&quot; and introduced in 1999, the Dilberito came in flavors of Mexican, Indian, Barbecue, and Garlic &amp; Herb. It was sold through some health food stores.

== Concept ==

Scott Adams&#x27; inspiration for the product was that &quot;diet is the number one cause of health-related problems in the world. I figured I could put a dent in that problem and make some money at the same time.&quot; His aim was to create a healthy food product that also had mass appeal, a concept he called &quot;the blue jeans of food&quot;.

== Promotion ==

A Flash game titled &quot;Dilberito&quot; was developed and published by Blam! Video Game Development in 2000 for Scott Adams Foods, Inc.

==Reception==
The product failed to catch on in the market, leading Adams &quot;several years and several million dollars later&quot; to sell off his intellectual property and exit the business. Adams himself noted, &quot;[t]he mineral fortification was hard to disguise, and because of the veggie and legume content, three bites of the Dilberito made you fart so hard your intestines formed a tail.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted the burrito &quot;could have been designed only by a food technologist or by someone who eats lunch without much thought to taste.&quot;

<doc id="175544" wikidata="Q717985" url="?curid=175544" title="Medgar Evers">
<text>Medgar Wiley Evers (; July 2, 1925June 12, 1963) was an American civil rights activist and soldier who was the NAACP&#x27;s first field secretary in Mississippi. Evers, a United States Army veteran who served in World War II, was engaged in efforts to overturn racial segregation at the University of Mississippi, end the segregation of public facilities, and expand opportunities for African Americans, including the enforcement of voting rights when he was assassinated by Byron De La Beckwith.

After college, Evers became active in the civil rights movement in the 1950s. Following the 1954 ruling of the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, Evers challenged the segregation of the state-supported public University of Mississippi. He applied to law school there, as the state had no public law school for African Americans. He also worked for voting rights, economic opportunity, access to public facilities, and other changes in the segregated society. In 1963 Evers was awarded the NAACP Spingarn Medal.

Evers was murdered in 1963 at his home in Jackson, Mississippi, now the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home National Monument, by Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the White Citizens&#x27; Council in Jackson. 

His murder and the resulting trials inspired civil rights protests. His life and death have inspired numerous works of art, music, and film. Although all-white juries failed to reach verdicts in the first two trials of De La Beckwith in the 1960s, he was convicted in 1994 based on new evidence. Evers&#x27; widow, Myrlie Evers, became a noted activist in her own right, and served as national chair of the NAACP. In 1969, after passage of civil rights legislation and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medgar&#x27;s brother Charles Evers was elected as mayor of Fayette, Mississippi. He was the first African American to be elected mayor of a Mississippi city in the post-Reconstruction era.

==Early life and education==
Medgar Wiley Evers was born on July 2, 1925, in Decatur, Mississippi, the third of five children (including elder brother Charles Evers) of Jesse (Wright) and James Evers. The family included Jesse&#x27;s two children from a previous marriage. The Evers family owned a small farm and James also worked at a sawmill. Evers and his siblings walked a day to attend racially segregated schools; eventually Medgar earned his high school diploma.

In 1943, Evers enlisted in the United States Army at the age of 17; he was prompted to do so by the racism he experienced at home and Charles&#x27; prior enlistment in the Army. Evers served in the 657th Port Company, a segregated unit of the Army&#x27;s Transportation Corps, participating in the Normandy landings on June 1944. In France, Evers&#x27; unit was part of the Red Ball Express, which delivered supplies to Allied troops fighting on the frontlines. During his time in the Army, Evers was angered by the segregation and mistreatment endured by African-American troops. Witnessing Black soldiers of the Free French Forces being treated as the equals of white troops, he once told Charles that &quot;When we get out of the Army, we’re going to straighten this thing out!&quot; 

In 1946, Evers was discharged from the Army at the rank of technician fifth grade, having earned the Good Conduct Medal, European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and World War II Victory Medal. After returning to Decatur, Evers enrolled at the historically black Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College in 1948, majoring in business administration. He also competed on the debate, football, and track teams, sang in the choir, and was elected as junior class president. Evers earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1952. On December 24, 1951, Evers married classmate Myrlie Beasley. Together they had three children: Darrell Kenyatta, Reena Denise, and James Van Dyke Evers.

==Activism==
The couple moved to Mound Bayou, Mississippi, a town developed by African Americans after the Civil War. Evers became a salesman for T. R. M. Howard&#x27;s Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company. 

Becoming active in the civil rights movement, he served as president of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership (RCNL), which began to organize actions to end segregation; Evers helped organize the RCNL&#x27;s boycott of those gasoline stations that denied blacks the use of the stations&#x27; restrooms. He and his brother, Charles, attended the RCNL&#x27;s annual conferences in Mound Bayou between 1952 and 1954, which drew crowds of 10,000 or more.

In 1954, following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, Evers applied to the state-supported University of Mississippi Law School to challenge that practice in the state. His application was rejected due to his race, as the flagship school had long been segregated. Evers submitted his application as part of a test case by the NAACP.

On November 24, 1954, Evers was named as the NAACP&#x27;s first field secretary for Mississippi. In this position, he helped organize boycotts and set up new local chapters of the NAACP. Evers was also involved with James Meredith&#x27;s efforts to enroll in the University of Mississippi in the early 1960s.

Evers also encouraged Dr. Gilbert Mason Sr. in his organizing of the Biloxi wade-ins from 1959 to 1963, protests against segregation of the city&#x27;s public beaches on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Evers conducted actions to help integrate Jackson&#x27;s privately owned buses and tried to integrate the public parks. Evers led voter registration drives and used boycotts to integrate Leake County schools and the Mississippi State Fair.

Evers&#x27; civil rights leadership, along with his investigative work, made him a target of white supremacists. Following the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision, local whites founded the White Citizens&#x27; Council in Mississippi, and numerous local chapters were started, to resist the integration of schools and facilities. In the weeks before Evers was killed, he encountered new levels of hostility. Evers&#x27; public investigations into the 1955 lynching of Chicago teenager Emmett Till in Mississippi, and his vocal support of Clyde Kennard, had made Evers a prominent black leader. On May 28, 1963, a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the carport of his home. On June 7, 1963, Evers was nearly run down by a car after he came out of the NAACP office in Jackson, Mississippi.

==Death==
Evers lived with the constant threat of death. A large white supremacist population and the Ku Klux Klan were present in Jackson and its suburbs. The risk was so high that before his death, Evers and his wife, Myrlie, had trained their children on what to do in case of a shooting, bombing, or other kind of attack on their lives. Evers, who was regularly followed home by at least two FBI cars and a police car, arrived at his home on the morning of his death without an escort. None of his usual protection was present, for reasons unspecified by the FBI or local police. There has been speculation that many members of the police force at the time were members of the Klan.

In the early morning of Wednesday, June 12, 1963, just hours after President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s nationally televised Civil Rights Address, Evers pulled into his driveway after returning from a meeting with NAACP lawyers. His family had worried for his safety that day, and Evers himself had warned his wife that he felt in greater danger than usual.

Emerging from his car and carrying NAACP T-shirts that read &quot;Jim Crow Must Go&quot;, Evers was struck in the back with a bullet fired from an Eddystone Enfield 1917 rifle; the bullet passed through his heart. Initially thrown to the ground by the impact of the shot, Evers rose and staggered before collapsing outside his front door. His wife, Myrlie, was the first to find him.

Evers was taken to the local hospital in Jackson, where he was initially refused entry because of his race. Evers&#x27; family explained who he was, and he was admitted; Evers died in the hospital 50 minutes later, three weeks before his 38th birthday. Evers was the first black man to be admitted to an all-white hospital in Mississippi. Mourned nationally, Evers was buried on June 19 in Arlington National Cemetery, where he received full military honors before a crowd of more than 3,000 people.

=== Aftermath ===
After Evers was assassinated, an estimated 5,000 people marched from the Masonic Temple on Lynch Street to the Collins Funeral Home on North Farish Street in Jackson. Allen Johnson, Martin Luther King Jr., and other civil rights leaders led the procession. The Mississippi police came to the non-violent protest armed with riot gear and rifles. While tensions were initially high in the stand-off between police and marchers, both in Jackson and in many similar marches around the state, leaders of the movement maintained non-violence among their followers.

===Trials===
On June 21, 1963, Byron De La Beckwith, a fertilizer salesman and member of the Citizens&#x27; Council (and later of the Ku Klux Klan), was arrested for Evers&#x27; murder. District Attorney and future governor Bill Waller prosecuted De La Beckwith. All-white juries in February and April 1964 deadlocked on De La Beckwith&#x27;s guilt and failed to reach a verdict. At the time, most black people were still disenfranchised by Mississippi&#x27;s constitution and voter registration practices; this meant they were also excluded from juries, which were drawn from the pool of registered voters.

Myrlie Evers did not give up the fight for the conviction of her husband&#x27;s killer. She waited until a new judge had been assigned in the county to take her case against De La Beckwith back into the courtroom. In 1994, De La Beckwith was prosecuted by the state based on new evidence. Bobby DeLaughter was the prosecutor. During the trial, the body of Evers was exhumed for an autopsy. His body was embalmed, and was in such good condition that his son was allowed to view his father&#x27;s remains for the first time in 30 years.

De La Beckwith was convicted of murder on February 5, 1994 and sentenced to life in prison, having lived as a free man for much of the three decades following the killing. He had been imprisoned from 1977 to 1980 for conspiring to murder A. I. Botnick. In 1997, De La Beckwith appealed his conviction in the Evers case but the Mississippi Supreme Court upheld it and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear it. He died at the age of 80 in prison on January 21, 2001.

==Legacy==

Evers was memorialized by leading Mississippi and national authors James Baldwin, Margaret Walker, Eudora Welty, and Anne Moody. In 1963, Evers was posthumously awarded the Spingarn Medal by the NAACP. In 1969, Medgar Evers College was established in Brooklyn, New York, as part of the City University of New York.

Evers&#x27; widow, Myrlie Evers, co-wrote the 1967 book &quot;For Us, the Living&quot; with William Peters. In 1983, a television movie was made based on the book. Celebrating Evers&#x27;s life and career, it starred Howard Rollins Jr. and Irene Cara as Medgar and Myrlie Evers, airing on PBS. The film won the Writers Guild of America award for Best Adapted Drama.

In 1969, a community pool in the Central District neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, was named after Evers, honoring his life.

On June 28, 1992, the city of Jackson, Mississippi, erected a statue in honor of Evers. All of Delta Drive (part of U.S. Highway 49) in Jackson was renamed in his honor. In December 2004, the Jackson City Council changed the name of the city&#x27;s airport to Jackson–Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport in Evers&#x27; honor.

Evers&#x27; widow, Myrlie Evers, became a noted activist in her own right, eventually serving as national chairperson of the NAACP. Myrlie also founded the Medgar Evers Institute in 1998, with the initial goal of preserving and advancing the legacy of her husband&#x27;s life&#x27;s work. Anticipating the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Medgar Evers and recognizing the international leadership role of Myrlie Evers, the Institute&#x27;s board of directors changed the organization&#x27;s name to the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Institute.

Evers&#x27; brother, Charles Evers, returned to Jackson in July 1963, and served briefly with the NAACP in his brother&#x27;s place. Charles remained involved in Mississippi civil rights activities for many years, and in 1969, was the first African-American mayor elected in the state. He died on July 22, 2020, at the age of 97, in nearby Brandon.

On the 40th anniversary of Evers&#x27; assassination, hundreds of civil rights veterans, government officials, and students from across the country gathered around his grave site at Arlington National Cemetery to celebrate his life and legacy. Barry Bradford and three students—Sharmistha Dev, Jajah Wu, and Debra Siegel, formerly of Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois—planned and hosted the commemoration in his honor. Evers was the subject of the students&#x27; research project.

In October 2009, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, a former Mississippi governor, announced that , a , would be named in the activist&#x27;s honor. The ship was christened by Myrlie Evers-Williams on November 12, 2011.

In June 2013, a statue of Evers was erected at his alma mater, Alcorn State University, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Evers&#x27; death. Alumni and guests from around the world gathered to recognize his contributions to American society.

Evers was also honored in a tribute at Arlington National Cemetery on the 50th anniversary of his death. Former President Bill Clinton, Attorney General Eric Holder, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, Senator Roger Wicker, and NAACP President Benjamin Jealous all spoke commemorating Evers. Evers&#x27;s widow, Myrlie Evers-Williams, spoke of his contributions to the advancement of civil rights:

Medgar was a man who never wanted adoration, who never wanted to be in the limelight. He was a man who saw a job that needed to be done and he answered the call and the fight for freedom, dignity and justice not just for his people but all people.

Evers was identified as a Freedom hero by The My Hero Project.

In 2017, the Medgar and Myrlie Evers House was named as a National Historic Landmark. In 2019, the site was designated a National Monument.

The Route 3 Bridge over the Hackensack River is dedicated to Evers.

In 2024, Evers was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden.

== In popular culture ==
=== Music ===
Musician Bob Dylan wrote his song &quot;Only a Pawn in Their Game&quot; about the assassination on July 2, 1963, on what would have been Evers&#x27; 38th birthday. Nina Simone wrote and sang &quot;Mississippi Goddam&quot; about the Evers case. Phil Ochs referred to Evers in the song &quot;Love Me, I&#x27;m a Liberal&quot; and wrote the songs &quot;Another Country&quot; and &quot;Too Many Martyrs&quot; (also titled &quot;The Ballad of Medgar Evers&quot;) in response to the killing. Malvina Reynolds referenced Evers&#x27;s murder in her song, &quot;It Isn&#x27;t Nice&quot;. Matthew Jones and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Freedom Singers recorded a version of the latter song. Wadada Leo Smith&#x27;s album &quot;Ten Freedom Summers&quot; contains a track called &quot;Medgar Evers: A Love-Voice of a Thousand Years&#x27; Journey for Liberty and Justice&quot;. Jackson C. Frank&#x27;s self-titled debut album, released in 1965, also includes a reference to Medgar Evers in the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;.

=== Essays and books ===
Eudora Welty&#x27;s short story, &quot;Where Is the Voice Coming From?&quot;, in which the speaker is the imagined assassin of Medgar Evers, was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in July 1963.

Attorney Bobby DeLaughter wrote a first-person narrative article entitled &quot;Mississippi Justice&quot; published in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; about his experiences as state prosecutor in the murder trial. He added to this account in a book, &quot;Never Too Late: A Prosecutor&#x27;s Story of Justice in the Medgar Evers Case&quot; (2001).

In &quot;Remembering Medgar Evers: Writing the Long Civil Rights Movement&quot;, Minrose Gwin, then the Kenan Eminent Professor of English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and coeditor of &quot;The Literature of the American South&quot; and the &quot;Southern Literary Journal&quot;, looked at the body of artistic work inspired by Evers&#x27; life and death—fiction, poetry, memoir, drama, and songs from James Baldwin, Margaret Walker, Eudora Welty, Lucille Clifton, Bob Dylan, and Willie Morris, among others.

=== Film ===
Evers was portrayed by Howard Rollins in the 1983 television film &quot;For Us the Living: The Medgar Evers Story&quot;.

The 1996 film &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot;, directed by Rob Reiner, explores the 1994 trial of De La Beckwith in which prosecutor DeLaughter of the Hinds County District Attorney&#x27;s office secured a conviction in state court. Beckwith and DeLaughter were played by James Woods and Alec Baldwin, respectively, with Whoopi Goldberg as Myrlie Evers. Medgar was portrayed by James Pickens Jr. The film was based on a book of the same name.

In the documentary film &quot;I Am Not Your Negro&quot; (2016), Evers is one of three Black activists (the other two are Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X) who are the focus of reminiscences by author James Baldwin, who recounts the circumstances of and his reaction to Evers&#x27; assassination.

In the 2011 film &quot;The Help&quot;, a clip of Evers speaking for civil rights is shown on TV, quickly followed by news of his assassination, and a glimpse of an article by his widow published in &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

The 2020 documentary film &quot;The Evers&quot; features interviews with his surviving family members.

The 2022 film &quot;Till&quot; depicts Evers (played by Tosin Cole) assisting Mamie Till-Bradley (Danielle Deadwyler) seek justice for the murder of her son, Emmett Till (Jalyn Hall).

A 2021 episode of Extra History from &quot;Extra Credits&quot; talks about Evers, his activism, and assassination.

<text>Red Storm Rising is a war novel, written by Tom Clancy and Larry Bond, and released on August 7, 1986. Set in the mid-1980s, it features a Third World War between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact forces, and is notable for depicting the conflict as being fought exclusively with conventional weapons, rather than escalating to the use of weapons of mass destruction or nuclear warfare. It is one of two Clancy novels, along with &quot;SSN&quot; (1996), that are not set in the Ryanverse.

The book debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. It eventually lent its name to game development company Red Storm Entertainment, which Clancy co-founded in 1997.

==Plot==
Muslim militants from Soviet Azerbaijan destroy an oil production refinery in Nizhnevartovsk, threatening to cripple the Soviet Union&#x27;s economy due to oil shortages. After much deliberation, the Soviet Politburo decides to seize the Persian Gulf by military force in order to recoup the country&#x27;s oil losses. Knowing that the United States had pledged to defend the oil-producing countries in the Persian Gulf, the Soviets decide that neutralizing NATO is a necessary first step before its military operation can take place. If West Germany were to be neutralized and occupied, the Soviets believe that the United States would not move to rescue the Arab states since it could meet its oil needs from the Western Hemisphere alone.

To divert attention from the impending operation, the Politburo embarks upon an elaborate &quot;maskirovka&quot; to disguise both their predicament and their intentions. The Soviets publicly declare their arms reduction proposal to scrap their obsolete nuclear missile submarines. The KGB then carries out a false flag operation involving a bomb being detonated in a Kremlin building, framing a KGB sleeper agent as a West German intelligence spy involved in the incident. The Politburo publicly denounces the West German government and calls for retaliation.

Even though a planned attack on a NATO communications facility in Lammersdorf was compromised when a Spetsnaz officer was arrested, the Soviet Army pushes through with their advance operations in Germany. They suffer reverses on the first night of the war, however, when NATO stealth and fighter-bomber aircraft achieve air superiority over Central Europe by eliminating Soviet fighter and AEW&amp;C aircraft, and destroying key bridges that much of the Soviet Army has yet to cross.

Nevertheless, the Soviet Navy achieves a decisive early victory by launching a bold amphibious landing on Iceland, taking control of the NATO airbase in Keflavík. This is followed up by a substantial air attack against a combined American-French carrier battle group that was originally sent to reinforce Iceland with several landing ships full of US Marines. The battle results in the loss of several ships including the French carrier &quot;Foch&quot; and the landing ship USS &quot;Saipan&quot;. Damage was also done to other ships like the US carrier USS &quot;Nimitz&quot;, forcing her to drydock in Britain to undergo repairs. This leaves the Soviets in control of the strategically important GIUK gap.

NATO and Soviet air and ground forces continue to battle ferociously in Germany, with both sides taking heavy losses. General-Colonel Pavel Alekseyev, the de-facto Soviet senior commander on the ground, scores a breakthrough in a tank battle at Alfeld, opening the possibility of a Soviet advance beyond the Weser River with far less opposition from NATO forces. Meanwhile, a naval attack on Soviet bomber bases with cruise missiles launched by US Navy submarines opens a window for an amphibious assault on Iceland, retaking the island and effectively closing the Atlantic to Soviet forces. Among the action, a Soviet prisoner captured during the retaking of Iceland reveals the true cause of the war, and a NATO air offensive swiftly destroys much of the Soviet military&#x27;s readily-available fuel supplies.

With Iceland re-taken, the United States is able to resupply the rest of NATO via the reopened sea lanes. By this point Soviet tank and strategic bomber formations have taken punishing losses, forcing them to further cede the initiative as NATO prepares to mount a decisive counteroffensive. The Soviet leadership begins to realize that they face the possibility of outright defeat—either through a NATO military breakthrough or a war of attrition which, given their desperate lack of oil supplies, would amount to the same result. The General Secretary considers using nuclear weapons to force a favorable end to the war. This infuriates Alekseyev, who had been mobilizing for a final counterattack on Germany but faces execution by the Soviet government for its slow timetable. The KGB chief organizes a coup along with Alekseyev and other members of the Politburo. The new Soviet government then negotiates for a ceasefire with NATO and a return to &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;, ending the war.

==Themes==
&quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; depicts a future Third World War, chiefly between the United States and the Soviet Union. It follows the &quot;future war&quot; genre first popularized by the 1871 novella &quot;The Battle of Dorking&quot; by George Tomkyns Chesney as well as the science fiction novel &quot;The War in the Air&quot; (1908) by H.G. Wells. &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; is unusual among Cold War examples of the genre in that it presented a war fought entirely using conventional weapons rather than one with nuclear weaponry or chemical weaponry. For instance, &quot;The Third World War: August 1985&quot; describes a conflict based on fairly similar assumptions, but involving heavy use of chemical weaponry and with limited use of strategic nuclear weapons at the conclusion of the conflict.

According to a document released by the UK National Archives in December 2015, U.S. President Ronald Reagan had recommended &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; to UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher shortly after the Reykjavík Summit in 1986 between him and Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev so as to gain an understanding of the Soviet Union&#x27;s intentions and strategy. Some of the advanced weapons systems described in the novel were deployed four years later in the Gulf War.

==Development==
Tom Clancy met Larry Bond in 1982. The two discussed &quot;Convoy-84&quot;, a wargame Bond had been working on at the time that featured a new Battle of the North Atlantic. The idea became the basis for &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;. &quot;We plotted out the book together, then, while I researched the military issues, Tom wrote the book,&quot; Bond said. &quot;I&#x27;m listed as co-author, but I wrote like 1 percent of the book,&quot; Bond stated in a 2013 interview. For research on the Politburo scenes, Clancy and Bond interviewed Soviet defector Arkady Shevchenko.

Clancy had purchased Bond&#x27;s wargame &quot;Harpoon&quot; as a primary source for his future novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1984). Clancy and Bond used the board game&#x27;s second edition miniature rules to test key battle sequences, notably the Soviet operation to seize Iceland and the attack on the carrier battle group in the &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot; chapter.

=== Dance of the Vampires ===
This refers to the chapter where the Soviets lure a NATO carrier group into a trap and almost manages to wipe it out.

The game sessions typically involved several players on each side (Clancy among them) acting in various roles. with Bond refereeing. The games did not influence the outcome - the chapter&#x27;s ending was already decided - but they gave Clancy and Bond a &quot;better understanding of what factors drove each side&#x27;s thinking&quot;.

This attention to detail made Vice consider Red Storm Rising a &quot;great example of fictional military history.&quot;

The collected and annotated notes on the three Dance of the Vampires scenario playthroughs would later be published by Bond.

==Publication==
In 1987, the book was published in French as &quot;Tempête Rouge&quot; (Red Storm), translated by France-Marie Watkins, with the collaboration of Jean Sabbagh.

==Reception==
Like its predecessor, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, the book received critical acclaim for its accurate military narrative. Publishers Weekly praised it as &quot;fascinating and totally credible story, told with authenticity and great suspense&quot;. Kirkus Reviews hailed it as &quot;an informative, readable, sometimes dazzling speculation on superpower war&quot;.

==Game adaptations==
In December 1988, MicroProse released a &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; computer game, in which the player commanded an American submarine against Soviet forces. The player had the option of choosing between both single missions or campaign and which era to play in; modern missions offered the player more advanced submarines and weapons, but also a more technologically advanced adversary as well.

In 1989, TSR, Inc. released the &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; board game designed by Douglas Niles, based on the book. The game won the Origins Award for Best Modern-Day Boardgame and Best Graphic Presentation of a Boardgame in 1989.

<doc id="175549" wikidata="Q585169" url="?curid=175549" title="Dilbert principle">
<text>The Dilbert principle is a satirical concept of management developed by Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip &quot;Dilbert&quot;, which states that companies tend to promote incompetent employees to management to minimize their ability to harm productivity. The Dilbert principle is inspired by the Peter principle, which is that employees are promoted based on success until they attain their &quot;level of incompetence&quot; and are no longer successful. By the Dilbert principle, employees who were never competent are promoted to management to limit the damage they can do. Adams first explained the principle in a 1995 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article, and elaborated upon it in his humorous 1996 book &quot;The Dilbert Principle&quot;.

==Definition==
In the &quot;Dilbert&quot; comic strip of February 5, 1995, Dogbert says that &quot;leadership is nature&#x27;s way of removing morons from the productive flow&quot;. Adams himself explained,

I wrote &quot;The Dilbert Principle&quot; around the concept that in many cases the least competent, least smart people are promoted, simply because they’re the ones you don&#x27;t want doing actual work. You want them ordering the doughnuts and yelling at people for not doing their assignments—you know, the easy work. Your heart surgeons and your computer programmers—your smart people—aren&#x27;t in management. That principle was literally happening everywhere.
Adams explained the principle in a 1995 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article. Adams then elaborated his study of the Dilbert principle in his 1996 book &quot;The Dilbert Principle&quot;, which is required or recommended reading at some management and business programs. In the book, Adams writes that, in terms of effectiveness, use of the Dilbert principle is akin to a band of gorillas choosing an alpha-squirrel to manage them by an incredibly convoluted process. The book has sold more than a million copies and was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for 43 weeks.

==Comparative principles==
The Dilbert principle can be compared to the Peter principle. As opposed to the Dilbert principle, the Peter principle assumes that people are promoted because they are competent, and that the tasks higher in the hierarchy require skills or talents they do not possess. It concludes that due to this, a competent employee will eventually be promoted to, and then likely remain at, a job at which he or she is incompetent. In his book, &quot;The Peter Principle&quot;, Laurence J. Peter explains &quot;percussive sublimation&quot;, the act of &quot;kicking a person upstairs&quot; (i.e., promoting him to management) to reduce his interference with productive employees.

The Dilbert principle, by contrast, assumes that hierarchy just serves as a means for removing the incompetent to &quot;higher&quot; positions where they will be unable to cause damage to the workflow, assuming that the upper echelons of an organization have little relevance to its actual production, and that the majority of real, productive work in a company is done by people who rank lower. Unlike the Peter principle, the promoted individuals were not particularly good at any job they previously had, so awarding them a supervisory position is a way to remove them from the workforce without actually dismissing them, rather than a reward for meritorious service. An earlier formulation of this effect was known as Putt&#x27;s Law (1981), credited to the pseudonymous author Archibald Putt (&quot;Technology is dominated by two types of people, those who understand what they do not manage and those who manage what they do not understand.&quot;).

<text>The original Ferris Wheel, sometimes also referred to as the Chicago Wheel, was designed and built by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. as the centerpiece of the Midway at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.
Since its construction, many other Ferris wheels have been constructed that were patterned after it.

Intended as a keystone attraction similar to that of the 1889 Paris Exposition&#x27;s Eiffel Tower, the Ferris Wheel was the Columbian Exposition&#x27;s tallest attraction, with a height of .

The Ferris Wheel was dismantled and then rebuilt in Lincoln Park, Chicago, in 1895, and dismantled and rebuilt a third and final time for the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair in St. Louis, Missouri. It was ultimately demolished in 1906. In 2007, the wheel&#x27;s 45 foot, 70-ton axle was reportedly discovered buried near where it was demolished.

== Early history ==
Before the Ferris wheel, the Eiffel tower stood as a new centerpiece in Paris and an idea that was thought to be needed in the States. Gustave Eiffel himself amongst other inventors had many ideas as to how they could bring this tower over to the states, but ultimately, Daniel Burnham thought up the idea of a monumental wheel. When he presented his ideas to a team of metal workers – George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. and his team – he thought the idea to be unsafe and unable to be done. Ferris kept on with the wheel ideas and proposed a bigger and taller tower, to stand as its own centerpiece at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. Once Burnham was off the project, Ferris&#x27;s team brought the project to life and was able to give this new attraction to 1.4 million people in June of 1893.

==Design and construction==
The Ferris Wheel was designed and constructed by Ferris, a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania bridge-builder. Ferris began his career in the railroad industry before pursuing an interest in bridge building. He understood the growing need for structural steel and founded G.W.G. Ferris &amp; Co. in Pittsburgh, a firm that tested and inspected metals for railroads and bridge builders.

The wheel was constructed in Jackson Park during the winter of 1892–93. To create a foundation for the wheel, dynamite was used to break through three feet of frozen ground. Piles of timber were driven thirty-two feet into the ground, on top of which was laid a grillage of steel that was then filled with concrete. Jets of steam were used by workers to thaw dirt and prevent the poured concrete from freezing. With the foundation in place, the wheel was then constructed.

The completed wheel rotated on a 71-ton, 45.5 foot (13.9 meter) long axle that was at that time the world&#x27;s largest hollow forging. It was manufactured in Pittsburgh by the Bethlehem Iron Company and weighed , together with two cast-iron spiders weighing .
There were 36 passenger cars, each fitted with 40 revolving chairs and able to accommodate up to 60 people, giving a total capacity of 2,160.

On June 9, 1893, the wheel was primed for a test run with great anticipation and a good deal of anxiety. The engine that would activate the wheel was fueled by steam boilers whose underground mains rushed steam to propel the pistons of its thousand-horsepower engines. Upon first seeing the wheel which towered over everything in its vicinity, Julian Hawthorne, son of the author Nathaniel, was amazed that anything of such a size &quot;continues to keep itself erect ... it has no visible means of support – none that appear adequate. The spokes look like cobwebs; they are after the fashion of those on the newest make of bicycles&quot;. Ferris modeled his invention after the structural principles of a waterwheel near his childhood home in Nevada and modeled after the structural principles of a bicycle wheel. The Ferris wheel was supported by an enormous axle and powered by a one-thousand-horsepower steam engine. Correspondents made repeated requests for drawings and information, but Ferris would not release the details. As a consequence, no copies of the original plans or calculations have survived.

Both Ferris and his associate W. F. Gronau also recognized the engineering marvel the wheel represented, as a giant wheel that would turn slowly and smoothly without structural failure had never before been attempted.

For its inaugural run, no cars had yet been attached. The workmen however, climbed the structure and settled themselves on the spokes to the accompaniment of cheers from an audience of fair employees who had gathered to watch the momentous event. After the wheel had completed its first rotation, Gronau deemed the test a success. &quot;I could have yelled out loud for joy&quot;.

The wheel was erected at a cost of $385,000.

==Operation==
The Ferris Wheel took 20 minutes to make two revolutions, the first involving six stops to allow passengers to exit and enter and the second a nine-minute non-stop rotation, for which the ticket holder paid 50 cents ().

The Ferris Wheel first opened to the public as the centerpiece of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition at Midway Plaisance in Chicago on June 21, 1893, and continued to operate there until after the exposition ended in October 1893.

Almost 1.5 million paid to ride on the wheel, generating a profit of $395,000.

==After the Columbian Exposition==

The wheel itself closed in April 1894 and was then dismantled and stored until the following year, when it was rebuilt in the Lincoln Park, Chicago, neighborhood. The amusement park was located at 2619 to 2665 N. Clark, which is now the location of a McDonald&#x27;s and a high-rise residential building. The original plan was to include a beer garden and vaudeville show, but the liquor license was not granted. William D. Boyce, then a local resident, filed a Circuit Court action against the owners of the wheel to have it removed, but without success.

In 1896, Alexandre Promio created a short film for the Lumière Brothers (catalogue number 338) at the intersection of Wrightwood and Clark that included the Ferris wheel. It is one of the first films of Chicago.

The wheel operated at Clark St. from October 1895 until 1903, when it was purchased at auction by the Chicago House Wrecking Company (CHWC) for $8,150 ().
It was then dismantled for a second time and transported by rail to St. Louis for the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair, where it earned the CHWC about $215,000 ().

==Demolition and disposition==
After the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair closed on December 1, 1904, no purchasers were found who would pay for the relocation of the great Ferris Wheel, despite many efforts. It was finally destroyed by controlled demolition using dynamite on May 11, 1906 (18 months after the fair closed), to be sold for scrap. This was necessary because the contract with the city of St. Louis required the &quot;restoration of Forest Park.&quot;

In 2007, a magnetic survey using a cesium magnetometer indicated that a long, steel or iron object (presumed to be the axle) was buried under a major street roughly from where the wheel was demolished. It has not yet been excavated.

Since 2000, other published documents and research into original papers (from the Chicago House Wrecking Company, c.1904–1906) indicate that the axle was taken back to Chicago, where it was eventually cut up for scrap when oxy-acetylene torches improved sufficiently to cut the hardened steel axle up for scrap. These references include Norman Anderson&#x27;s book &quot;Ferris Wheels: An Illustrated History&quot;, several unpublished CHWC letters and documents, an article by Leo Harris (grandson of the CHWC&#x27;s Treasurer) who wrote that &quot;...the giant axle of the wheel was returned to the yards of the CHWC, where it remained until it was cut up for its steel content at the beginning of World War I&quot;, and an article published on February 1, 1907, in the &quot;Clinton&quot; (IL) &quot;Register&quot;, indicating, &quot;The last of the Ferris Wheel has been taken away... It was found necessary to blow off the flanges from the axle ... before it could be loaded on a (railroad) car&quot;.

== Lasting legacy ==
Although the original Ferris Wheel was demolished, a new wheel lives on in Chicago at Navy Pier, with structural similarities and inspiration from Ferris&#x27;s original wheel. Similar to the Chicago wheel, this Ferris wheel gives participants a 10–20 minute ride in an enclosed cart at a similar height to the original.

The original Chicago Navy Pier Ferris Wheel was modeled off of the Chicago Ferris Wheel and set on July 1, 1995, with 40 cars fitting six passengers in each one. The now Centennial wheel has enclosed cars at an elevated height closer to the original Chicago Wheel.

<text>José Canseco Capas Jr. (born July 2, 1964) is a Cuban-American former professional baseball outfielder and designated hitter who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). During his time with the Oakland Athletics, he established himself as one of the premier power hitters in the game. He won the Rookie of the Year (1986), and Most Valuable Player award (1988), and was a six-time All-Star. Canseco is a two-time World Series champion with the Oakland Athletics (1989) and the New York Yankees (2000).

In 1988, Canseco became the first player in MLB history to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in one season. He won the Silver Slugger Award four times: three as an American League (AL) outfielder (1988, 1990, 1991), and once as a designated hitter (1998). He ranks fourth all-time in Athletics history with 254 home runs and is one of 14 players in MLB history with 400 home runs and 200 stolen bases. Despite many injuries during the later part of his career, Canseco averaged 40 home runs, 120 runs batted in, and 102 runs scored every 162 games, playing a total of 1,887 games in 17 seasons with seven different teams. His 462 career home runs are the 12th-highest total in AL history and the 2nd most in MLB history for a player with less than 2,000 games played.

Canseco admitted using performance-enhancing drugs during his major-league playing career, and in 2005 wrote a tell-all book, &quot;&quot;, in which he said that the vast majority of MLB players use steroids. After retiring from MLB, he also competed in boxing and mixed martial arts.

==Early life==
Canseco was born in Havana, Cuba, the son of José Sr. and Barbara Canseco. He has a twin brother, Ozzie Canseco, who is also a former major league player. When Fidel Castro came into power in 1959, José Sr., a territory manager for the oil and gasoline corporation Esso as well as a part-time English teacher, lost his job and eventually his home. The family was allowed to leave Cuba in 1965, when the twins were barely one year old, and settled in the Miami area, where José Sr. became a territory manager for another oil and gasoline concern, Amoco.

Canseco played baseball at Miami Coral Park High School, where he failed to make the varsity team until his senior year. He was named Most Valuable Player of the junior varsity team in his junior year and of the varsity team the following year. He graduated in 1982.

==Baseball career==
===Minor League Baseball (1982–1985)===
The Oakland Athletics drafted Canseco in the 15th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball draft. He made his professional baseball debut with the Miami Marlins of the Florida State League and also played Minor League Baseball with the Medford A&#x27;s, Madison Muskies, Idaho Falls A&#x27;s, Modesto A&#x27;s, and Tacoma Tigers. Canseco started the 1985 season with the Class-AA Huntsville Stars and became known as &quot;Parkway José&quot; for his long home runs (25 in half a season) that went close to the Memorial Parkway behind Joe Davis Stadium. Canseco was nicknamed &quot;The Natural&quot;, with some analysts saying he was the best prospect since Willie Mays. Oakland A&#x27;s hitting coach Bob Watson said that Canseco was a mixture of Roberto Clemente, Dale Murphy, and Reggie Jackson. Others touted Canseco as the next Mickey Mantle.

===Major League Baseball (1985–2001)===
====Oakland Athletics (1985–1992)====
In 1985, Canseco won the Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year Award, and was a late &quot;September call-up&quot; for the Oakland Athletics. He made his Major League debut on September 2, striking out in his one at-bat against the Baltimore Orioles. His first hit was off Ron Guidry of the New York Yankees on September 7, and his first home run was off Jeff Russell of the Texas Rangers on September 9. He played in 29 games in the major leagues in 1985, batting .302 with 5 home runs and 13 RBIs in 96 at-bats. He was named Player of the Week from September 23 to 29 with a .481 BA (13 for 27), 3 HRs, and 7 RBIs in 7 games. He played both left and right field in 26 games and made 3 errors in 61 chances, with 56 putouts, 2 assists, and 1 double play. On September 26, he played 3 innings in center field, in his only career appearance in that position. For the entire 1985 year (AA, AAA, and Major League level combined), Canseco had a .330 batting average with 41 home runs, 140 runs batted in, 73 extra base hits, 336 total bases, and a .622 slugging percentage.

After being named Minor League Baseball Player of the Year and a good September call-up the prior year, Canseco was the favorite to win the American League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year Award in 1986. He batted either fifth or third in the lineup and he established himself that year in his first full season as the starting left fielder for the Athletics. By the All-Star break he was leading the American League in home runs (23) and runs batted in (78) and was selected as a backup outfielder for the All-Star Game by manager Dick Howser, although he did not see any playing time in the game. An 0-for-34 batting slump in August prevented him from winning the RBI crown, finishing with 117, four fewer than league leader Joe Carter. He led the league in outfielder errors with 14 and was third with 175 strikeouts. 
Nonetheless, his 33 home runs (4th in the AL), 117 RBIs, 29 doubles, and 15 stolen bases helped him win the American League Rookie of the Year award, defeating California Angels first baseman Wally Joyner. He also finished 20th in the American League MVP ballot.

In 1987, first baseman Mark McGwire joined Canseco on the Athletics, as an everyday player. In that roster the A&#x27;s also had veteran slugger Reggie Jackson, Canseco&#x27;s childhood hero, playing in his last MLB season. McGwire hit 49 home runs that year and was also named the American League Rookie of the Year. Together, Canseco and McGwire formed a fearsome offensive tandem, later known as the &quot;Bash Brothers&quot;. Canseco followed his rookie season with a similar offensive performance in 1987. He improved his batting average from .240 in 1986 to .257 in 1987, hitting 31 home runs, 113 runs batted in (6th in the AL), and 35 doubles (10th) in 691 at-bats (9th), while missing only 3 games the entire season. He was also 5th in the league in strikeouts, with 157. In the outfield, Canseco improved his performance compared to 1986. Playing left field the entire year, he was among the league leaders in this position with a .976 fielding average (3rd), 267 putouts (2nd), 12 assists (3rd), and 3 double plays (1st). He only committed 7 errors, half of what he made the previous year. He finished 23rd in the MVP ballot. Canseco combined with McGwire for a total of 80 home runs and 236 runs batted in, making the young pair (Canseco was 22 years old and McGwire 23) the most spectacular batting duo in the upcoming years, drawing comparisons to the likes of Mickey Mantle/Roger Maris, Willie Mays/Willie McCovey, and Hank Aaron/Eddie Mathews.
During the preseason of 1988, Canseco guaranteed he would hit at least 40 home runs and steal at least 40 bases in the upcoming season. The Athletics lineup featured established players with a lot of experience like former MVPs Dave Parker and Don Baylor, as well as outfielder Dave Henderson, and third baseman Carney Lansford, that complemented McGwire and Canseco in the middle of the batting order. After alternating between batting second and third in the lineup for the first 10 games of the season, he was inserted in the number 3 spot for the rest of the season. He also moved from left to right field. Canseco hit a home run on Opening Day against the Seattle Mariners and had his first stolen base of the season. During the first 40 games of the season, he hit for a .300 batting average with 10 home runs and 15 stolen bases. His first multi-home run game was on July 3 against the Toronto Blue Jays at Exhibition Stadium during a 16-inning contest in which Canseco had a 3-for-7 performance, with 3 home runs and 6 runs batted in. By the All-Star break, he had 24 home runs (1st in the American League), 22 stolen bases, and 67 RBIs (2nd in the AL). He was selected by fans to the All-Star Game as one of the starting outfielders, batting fourth in the lineup. On July 31, he had his second and last multi-home run game of the year against the Seattle Mariners, hitting 2 homers. On September 18, he hit his 40th home run of the year against the Kansas City Royals in front of the Oakland crowd. Five days later against the Milwaukee Brewers, Canseco stole 2 bases, the second one coming after his first bunt of the season, to become the first 40-40 player in Major League history. With a .393/.446/.753 slash line, 8 home runs, and 24 RBIs in 24 games for the month, he was named the American League&#x27;s Player of the Month for September. A well-rounded team with lots of power, great starting and relief pitching, and a sound defense, the Oakland Athletics finished the season with a major league-best 104 wins and swept the Boston Red Sox in 4 games in the ALCS. For the series, Canseco had a .313 batting average and hit home runs in games one, two, and four, and all of them either tied the game or gave the Athletics the lead, but the ALCS MVP Award went to reliver Dennis Eckersley who had 4 saves in 4 chances. The A&#x27;s met the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series, a matchup that featured the leading candidate to win the American League MVP Award facing the eventual National League Cy Young Award winner, Orel Hershiser. The Dodgers prevailed, upsetting the A&#x27;s in five games. Canseco hit a grand slam in Game 1 during his first official World Series at-bat (though his second plate appearance, after he was hit by a pitch in the first inning), tying Gene Tenace for the Athletics’ franchise record of most home runs in a single postseason with 4, but it would be his only hit in the Series. He was unanimously named the American League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in 1988 (making him the seventh player in league history to win the award unanimously) with a .307 batting average, 120 runs scored (second in the league), and 347 total bases (2nd), and leading the major leagues with 76 extra-base hits, 124 RBIs, 42 home runs, a .569 slugging percentage, and a 14.5 home run per at-bat ratio. His 40 stolen bases were the fourth highest in the league. 27 of his 42 home runs of the season either tied the game or gave the Athletics the lead. He also won his first Silver Slugger Award. He was exclusively a right fielder during the year, playing in 144 games on defense, committing 7 errors in 322 chances, and had 304 putouts for a .978 fielding percentage. He was third in the league in outfielder assists with 11.

In 1989, Canseco missed the first 88 games of the regular season because of a broken wrist during the preseason. Despite not playing a single game in the first half of the year, he was voted as one of the starting outfielders for the American League All-Star team. Unable to play he was replaced in the lineup by Rangers outfielder Rubén Sierra. Canseco returned immediately after the All-Star break, hitting an opposite-field home run against the Toronto Blue Jays in his first game of the season. He hit 5 home runs in his first 35 at bats (10 games), but only 2 in the following 20 games. After finding his rhythm at the plate, Canseco finished the season strong, hitting .286 with 10 home runs, 33 hits, and 33 RBIs in his last 30 games of the year. He managed to hit 17 home runs with 57 RBIs in barely 65 games played for the entire season, a pace equal to 40+ home runs and 130+ RBIs had he played a full season. The Athletics won the AL West and their first World Series since 1974, beating the San Francisco Giants in four games. Canseco had a solid postseason, batting .323 and hitting 2 home runs including one in the ALCS against the Blue Jays that reached the upper deck of the SkyDome. Against the Giants, in the World Series, he hit for a .357 average with a home run in Game 3. The 1989 Series was interrupted before Game 3 by a major earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area.

As the reigning World Series Champs, the Oakland Athletics were favorites to repeat, and they were hopeful that Canseco would remain healthy throughout the 1990 season. In May, he was named the American League&#x27;s Player of the Month for the second time in his career, after hitting .353 in 27 games with 13 home runs and 35 runs batted in. Canseco started to have back problems, an issue that would become recurrent in his career. Despite missing over 20 games due to injury during the first part of the season, he received a then-record 5-year, $23.5-million dollar contract, making him the highest paid player in Major League history and the first ever to make at least $4 million in a year, averaging $4.7 million per season. On May 22, Canseco hit his first regular-season grand slam of his career against the Toronto Blue Jays. By the All-Star break, he had played in only 64 games, hitting .293 with 22 home runs (6 behind the American League leader Cecil Fielder). Canseco was selected to start in the All-Star Game for the third consecutive year, this time with the most fan votes in the American League. On July 18, his twin brother Ozzie Canseco made his major league debut. During a July 24 game against the California Angels, both José and Ozzie had line drive hits to left field off pitcher Jim Abbott and both were thrown out at second base by left fielder Max Venable, trying to extend a single in to a double. Although he hit 15 home runs in 69 games during the second half, Canseco was not as productive as the first part of the year. He missed another 11 games late in the season, and at times he was coming off the bench as a pinch hitter. From August 1 until the end of the regular season, he hit .220 with 5 homers, 24 RBIs, and 60 strikeouts in 47 games, while battling with a back injury. He finished 3rd in the league with 37 home runs, behind Fielder (51) and teammate Mark McGwire (39). In 131 games, he had 101 runs batted in and 19 stolen bases. It was the fourth time in 5 years that he had 100+ RBIs. For the season, he played in 43 games as the designated hitter and only 88 in right field, making only one error in 189 chances during the year. The Oakland A&#x27;s won their division with a league-best 103 wins and were the favorites to win the World Series. Canseco had a discreet ALCS, hitting .182 (2-for-11) with 5 strikeouts, but the A&#x27;s swept the Boston Red Sox 4 games to 0, and moved on to play in their third World Series in a row, this time against the Cincinnati Reds. Canseco struggled both at the plate and in the outfield, missing on two key plays in Game 2. In the same game, he had his only hit of the series, a 2-run home run against Danny Jackson, to set a franchise record with the 7th postseason home run of his career. After going 0 for 4 in Game 3, and 1 for 11 in the series, Canseco was benched in Game 4. Manager Tony LaRussa cited Canseco&#x27;s sore back and injured middle finger as the reasons for taking him out of the lineup, but there was speculation that his own teammates requested LaRussa to bench Canseco due to his poor outfield performance and struggles at the plate. Down 2 runs to 1 and facing elimination in Game 4, Canseco entered as a pinch hitter in the bottom of the 9th, but he grounded out to third for the second out of the inning. One batter later, the Reds completed the sweep over a heavily favored Oakland team. At the end of the year, Canseco won his second Silver Slugger Award and finished 12th in the AL MVP ballot.

Canseco continued to be productive the following year and for the first time since 1988, completely healthy. By the All-Star break of the 1991 season, he was leading the league with 21 home runs (tied with Cecil Fielder) and had 63 RBIs, but inexplicably did not receive All-Star Game consideration by either the fans or as a reserve player, as his own A&#x27;s skipper Tony LaRussa, managing the AL for the 3rd straight year, did not select him as a substitute. Fans instead voted Athletics outfielder Dave Henderson, who had far lesser offensive numbers than Canseco, and LaRussa selected Kirby Puckett, Joe Carter, and Rubén Sierra as the reserve outfielders. Canseco not being selected by his own manager despite leading the league in home runs, led many to believe that the relationship between Canseco and LaRussa had started to deteriorate. His best month that season was July, hitting 10 home runs in 27 games (1 every 11.1 at-bats) with a .315 batting average. He finished the 1991 season batting .266 with 44 home runs, earning the second home run crown of his career (tied with Detroit&#x27;s Cecil Fielder), 122 RBIs, 26 stolen bases, and a .556 slugging percentage. He led the AL with a home run every 13.0 at bats, while finishing 4th in the MVP ballot. He won his third Silver Slugger Award in four years. Towards the end of the season, there were mixed opinions from the Oakland fans in regards to Canseco; some would boo him but others showed support by cheering in games at the Oakland Coliseum. During a home game on September 20, and after rumors that he was on his way out of Oakland, he received a standing ovation by the fans. Canseco responded with his 42nd home run of the season against the Toronto Blue Jays, tying his career-best. The Athletics, however, missed the playoffs for the first time in three years, finishing 4th in the AL West.

The Athletics returned to contention in 1992, and despite missing 24 of the A&#x27;s games in the first half, Canseco hit 18 home runs (in 249 at-bats) by the All-Star break, and he was voted to start his 4th All-Star Game in 5 years, though he was unable to play due to a sore right shoulder and was replaced with Joe Carter.

At this point during his tenure with the A&#x27;s, from 1986 to 1992, and despite missing roughly 120 games between 1989 and 1990 and about 20 more during the first half of the 1992 season, Canseco averaged 32 home runs a year and hit 100+ RBIs five times. He also averaged 40 home runs, 125 RBIs, and 22 stolen bases per every 162 games played; captured AL Rookie of the Year honors, two home run titles, an MVP award, three Silver Slugger Awards, three American League Pennants, and a World Series ring. He was selected to five All-Star Games in his first 7 full Major League seasons. In the six years between 1986 and 1991, he finished in the top four in the American League home run leaderboard 4 times. He hit 231 home runs from 1985 to 1992 for the A&#x27;s, putting him 2nd all-time behind Reggie Jackson since the Athletics moved to Oakland in 1968. His 7 career postseason home runs and 18 runs batted in are both the all-time record for the franchise (1901–2024).

====Texas Rangers (1992–1994)====
On August 31, 1992, in the bottom of the first inning of a game vs the Baltimore Orioles, and while Canseco was in the on-deck circle, the A&#x27;s traded him to the Texas Rangers for Rubén Sierra, Jeff Russell, Bobby Witt, and cash. At the moment of the trade, Canseco was batting .243 with 22 home runs and 72 RBIs in 97 games, and the A&#x27;s were leading the American League West Division by 6.5 games. The Oakland front office was looking to fortify their pitching down the stretch. A&#x27;s general manager Sandy Alderson announced the trade while the Athletics were still playing the Orioles that night. The trade caught Canseco, the fans, the media, and people throughout Major League Baseball all by surprise, as Canseco was considered at the time the best player in baseball, but was also the most scrutinized. From 1986 until the date of the trade, no other player had hit more home runs (226) in the major leagues. In Texas, Canseco joined Latino stars Rafael Palmeiro, Juan González, and Iván Rodríguez. He had a good start with the Rangers, hitting .367 (11-for-30) with 3 home runs and 11 RBIs in his first 8 games, but had only 6 hits and one home run in his last 43 at-bats, averaging .140. Despite missing nearly 50 games to injuries and the trade to the Rangers, Canseco managed to hit 26 home runs (9th in the AL) and had 87 runs batted in, playing 115 games in 1992 for the Athletics and the Rangers. From 1985, the year he debuted with the A&#x27;s, until the end of 1992, Canseco&#x27;s 235 home runs were the most by any major league player. At the end of the 1992 season, the Oakland A&#x27;s would go on to lose the American League Championship Series to the Toronto Blue Jays 4 games to 2. Since winning the 1990 ALCS, the A&#x27;s would not win a playoff series for another 16 seasons.

Canseco started the 1993 season relatively healthy, playing in all of the Rangers&#x27; games in the first quarter of the season (45 games). Although hitting for a low average (.254) he had 17 RBIs in the first 17 games. On April 25, he became the first player since Ted Williams in 1947 to reach 750 RBIs in less than 1,000 games played. On May 26, 1993, during a game against the Cleveland Indians, Carlos Martínez hit a fly ball that Canseco lost sight of as he was crossing the warning track. The ball hit him on the head and bounced over the wall for a home run. The cap Canseco was wearing on that play, which &quot;This Week in Baseball&quot; rated in 1998 as the greatest blooper of the show&#x27;s first 21 years, is in the collection of ESPN journalist Keith Olbermann. Three days later, on May 29, Canseco asked his manager, Kevin Kennedy, to let him pitch the eighth inning of a runaway loss to the Boston Red Sox. In his inning-long pitching appearance, he injured his arm. He was out of the lineup from May 31 until June 10. He played in another 15 games after pitching against the Red Sox but he was shut down on June 23 due to arm discomfort, requiring Tommy John surgery and missing the remainder of the season. He finished the 1993 season hitting .256 with 10 home runs and 46 RBIs in 60 games.

In the strike-shortened 1994 season, Canseco again returned to his former status as a power hitter. Throughout the season, he was amongst the American League leaders in home runs, while playing exclusively as a designated hitter. On April 20, he hit the 250th home run of his career, making him the 16th player with that total before age 30. From June 3 to the 13th, he batted .559 (19-for-34) with 8 home runs and 20 runs batted in. In the last game of that span, he set career-highs for a single game with 5 hits, 8 RBIs, and 3 home runs (tying a career-high), including a grand slam against the Seattle Mariners. During Kenny Rogers&#x27; perfect game on July 28, Canseco went 2-for-4 with 2 solo home runs in the 4–0 victory over the California Angels. He finished the season with 31 home runs (4th in the AL), 90 RBIs (7th), a .552 Slugging Percentage (7), and hitting a home run every 13.8 at-bats (5th) while playing in 111 of the Rangers&#x27; 114 games. He also stole 15 bases, posted a .282 batting average, led the league with 20 GIDP (ground into double-play), and was second in the league with 114 strikeouts. Canseco was on pace to set career highs in home runs (45), runs batted in (130) and runs scored (127) when the players&#x27; strike started on August 12. He was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Comeback Player of the Year and finished in 11th place in the AL MVP voting.

Playing for the Texas Rangers, Canseco hit 45 home runs (averaging 37 per every 162 games played), 136 runs batted in, 23 stolen bases, 118 runs scored, and 180 hits in 171 games played, for a .273/.360/.515 slash line and 197 strikeouts.

====Boston Red Sox (1995–1996)====
After playing with the Rangers for a little over two years, Canseco was traded on December 9 to the Boston Red Sox for Otis Nixon and Luis Ortiz, where he joined 1986 AL MVP Roger Clemens and eventual 1995 MVP Mo Vaughn. He once again battled injuries, missing 50 games during the first half of the year. However, from July 1 until the end of the season, he had a .387 batting average (122-for-315) with 21 home runs and 66 RBIs in 79 games. From August 27 to September 15, he had the longest hitting streak of his career, hitting safely in 17 games (he had a hit in 24 of his last 28 games of the year). At the end of the regular season, he had 24 home runs with a .306 batting average, his highest since 1988. His last home run of the 1995 season against Jesse Orosco was the 300th of his career. The Red Sox captured the AL East Division title to advance to the ALDS, making it Canseco&#x27;s first postseason in five years. The Red Sox were swept by the Cleveland Indians in the American League Division Series 3 games to 0. In Game 2, Canseco once again faced pitcher Orel Hershiser, going 0-for-3 with a strikeout. Dating back to the 1988 World Series, Canseco was 0-for-11 lifetime with 3 strikeouts against Hershiser in 3 postseason matchups. After playing the entire 1994 season and all but one game in the 1995 season as a designated hitter, Canseco was the starting right fielder during Game 3 of the American League Division Series. 1995 was the last year of the five-year contract he signed with the Athletics in 1990. According to the Baseball-Reference website, Canseco had the highest yearly salary of his career, making a total of $5.8 million for the 1995 season.

Canseco had a great first half of the 1996 season, hitting 26 home runs by the All-Star break (3rd in the league at that point). Between May 18 and June 29, he had a .306 BA with 19 home runs, and 44 RBIs in only 39 games. He was sidelined on July 25 once again due to injury, missing nearly 50 games. He returned to the lineup on September 17 but hit only 2 home runs the rest of the season. He finished the year with a .289/.400/.589 slash line with 28 home runs, 82 runs batted in, and 22 doubles in 96 games. He played in the outfield in 12 games. After the 1996 season, the Red Sox fired manager Kevin Kennedy and Canseco requested a trade out of Boston.

Although productive when he was in the lineup, Canseco missed over 120 games during his 2-year tenure with Boston, playing in only 102 and 96 games in 1995 and 1996. He averaged 184 hits, 43 home runs, 134 RBIs, 108 runs, 39 doubles, a .289 batting average, and a slugging percentage of .571 per every 162 games played with the Red Sox.

====Return to Oakland (1997)====
In January 1997, he was traded to the Oakland Athletics for pitcher John Wasdin. The day after the news of his return to Oakland, the A&#x27;s front office informed him that ticket sales for the day were the highest in over three years, mainly because of the Bash Brothers reunion. Regarding his health, Canseco had a promising first half of the season, playing in 83 of Oakland&#x27;s 89 games, with more than half of those as an outfielder. He had 18 home runs and 57 RBIs by the All-Star break (on pace for 35 homers and 110 RBIs for the entire season), but he suffered a back injury yet again, keeping him on the disabled list and missing 15 games in July and August. He returned to action on August 20, but with the Athletics organization wanting to focus on developing young talent, and with the Bash Brothers reunion losing its appeal with the trade of Mark McGwire to the St. Louis Cardinals at the trade deadline, Canseco ended his season on August 26, missing the last 30 games of the season. In Canseco&#x27;s eyes, he was shut down by the front office to prevent him from getting the minimum plate appearances that would trigger the renewal of his contract for the following year. He finished the season with a .235 average, the lowest of his career, but with 23 home runs and 74 runs batted in in 388 at-bats. His home run against the Red Sox on August 8 gave him a career total of 254 in an Athletics uniform, placing him 4th all-time behind Reggie Jackson (269), Jimmie Foxx (302), and McGwire (363). After three seasons of playing exclusively as a DH, Canseco saw considerably more action in the outfield, playing 46 of his 108 games in left or right field.

====Toronto Blue Jays (1998)====
In 1998, Canseco signed a $2.1 million contract on February 4 with the Toronto Blue Jays. He continued to have more action in the outfield, playing a total of 76 games in both left and right field and finishing the season with a .960 fielding average, committing 5 errors in 126 chances. At the plate, Canseco had a productive season again, finishing the first half of the season with 24 home runs, 21 stolen bases, and 48 RBIs. For the first time in his career, he was issued a jersey number other than 33, wearing number 44 for the first part of the season. (After Ed Sprague was traded to Oakland, Canseco switched back to number 33). During the second half of the season, the Blue Jays instructed Canseco to reduce his attempts to steal bases, causing him to finish one steal shy of another 30–30 season. On July 19, he hit home runs number 25 and 26 against the Yankees and Andy Pettitte, including the sixth grand slam of his career. He finished the season having played 151 games, his highest in 6 years, with a career-high 46 home runs (third in the AL), 107 RBIs, 29 stolen bases, and 98 runs scored, but a .237 batting average. He also led the league with 159 strikeouts. He earned his fourth career Silver Slugger Award, his first as a designated hitter. The Blue Jays made a small effort to retain Canseco after the season, offering him a one-year contract worth just over a million dollars for the following season. Canseco declined the offer and became a free agent on October 22.

====Final seasons (1999–2001)====
Despite hitting a career-high 46 home runs in 1998, the 33-year-old Canseco drew minimal attention in the free agent market. In 1999, he signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays worth $3.3 million with incentives to be their Designated Hitter. According to Canseco, the contract included a clause stating that if he was elected to the Hall of Fame, he would be depicted as a member of the Devil Rays. That year, he came out of the gate swinging, hitting a home run on Opening Day and reaching a total of 10 home runs by the end of April. On April 14 he hit home run number 400 of his career against Toronto&#x27;s Kelvim Escobar. From May 16 to 21, he hit a home run in five consecutive games, the second-longest streak in Tampa Bay history. In his first 60 games played, he hit 25 home runs, batting .306 with a .690 slugging percentage. On pace for a 60+ home run season, he was voted to the All-Star team as the starting DH for the American League (Tampa Bay&#x27;s first position player ever to be selected to the All-Star Game), making it his first selection in seven years. By the All-Star break, Canseco was leading the American League with 31 home runs, while playing in 82 games during the first half of the season, and became the 14th player in MLB history to hit 30+ home runs before the All-Star break. However, he injured his back days before the mid-summer classic and missed the game, and was replaced by Rafael Palmeiro. He also missed the Home Run Derby at Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park and the chance to compete against Bash Brother Mark McGwire. He had back surgery and was expected to miss the rest of the season. With a remarkable recovery, he came back into action on August 20, less than a month and a half after his back operation. After his return, Canseco was hitting .315 with only 2 home runs but had 18 RBIs and 23 hits in his first 20 games back. Although he only hit 3 more home runs in 115 at-bats after his injury, he had a .287 batting average with 26 RBIs and 33 hits in his last 31 games of the year. He finished the season with 34 home runs and 95 RBIs with a .276 batting average and was ninth in the league with a .563 slugging percentage.

Despite missing around 350 games since 1990, mostly due to injuries, by the end of 1999, Canseco had a total of 303 home runs in 1,145 games, which placed him eighth in the majors during the 1990s. In 5 seasons during the 90&#x27;s, he was in the Top-10 list for home run hitters in the American League.

In February 2000, before the start of spring training for the following MLB season, Canseco played in the MLBPA-organized &quot;Big League Challenge&quot; home run derby in Las Vegas at Cashman Field. He competed against a field of 12 that included notable sluggers such as Mark McGwire, Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, and Mike Piazza. Canseco won the tournament, defeating Rafael Palmeiro in the final.

The Devil Rays re-signed Canseco for the 2000 season on a $3-million contract. The Devil Rays traded for third baseman Vinny Castilla and signed Greg Vaughn as a free agent to complement Fred McGriff and Canseco in the lineup. However, injuries caused the Tampa Bay front office to disband the quartet after the trade deadline. The first half of the season was one of the most difficult in Canseco&#x27;s career. Bothered by a foot injury, he missed 41 of the team&#x27;s 85 games up to the All-Star break. Canseco ended his Tampa Bay tenure on August 7 when he was claimed off waivers by the New York Yankees. In one and a half seasons with the Devil Rays, Canseco had a slash line of .272/.373/.525 with 43 home runs, 33 doubles, 125 runs batted in, and 176 hits on 174 games. At the time of the waivers&#x27; claim, Canseco&#x27;s 440 career home runs were the most ever for any player acquired by the Yankees. The move to the Yankees caught many, including Yankees manager Joe Torre, off guard, as the Yankees had other players at the time who fulfilled similar roles, such as Dave Justice and Glenallen Hill. Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman made the claim to prevent the Athletics, Red Sox, and Blue Jays, who were in a close race with the Yankees, from acquiring Canseco.

On August 10, during his first game in the starting lineup with the Yankees, batting fourth as the DH, Canseco went 2-for-2 with a walk, a home run, 2 sacrifice flies, and 3 RBIs. He hit .243 with 6 home runs and 19 RBIs in 37 games for the Yankees, splitting duties as a DH, outfielder, and pinch hitter. For the entire season, he had 15 home runs and 49 RBIs in 329 at-bats. The Yankees won the AL East, but Canseco was not on the team&#x27;s roster for the Division Series or the ALCS. He was, however, included in the final roster for the World Series against the New York Mets. During the sixth inning of Game 4 of the World Series, manager Joe Torre noticed that no right-handed pitcher was warming up in the Mets bullpen, and with pitcher David Cone next to bat, Torre sent Canseco to the plate to face left-handed Glendon Rusch as a pinch hitter (his most recent World Series at-bat was also as a pinch hitter in Game 4 of the 1990 World Series, 10 years prior). The game was the first in which Canseco had played in 24 days, and he struck out. The Yankees won the series 4 games to 1 and Canseco earned his second World Series ring. Canseco later called his Yankees tenure &quot;the worst time of [his] life&quot; due to receiving limited playing time. His short stint with the Yankees marked the third time he was Roger Clemens&#x27; teammate, a fact later magnified by the media due to the steroid controversy, the Mitchell Report, and the infamous pool party at Canseco&#x27;s house two years prior while both played with the Blue Jays. In November, the Yankees declined Canseco&#x27;s $5-million option and paid the $500,000 buyout, with Canseco becoming a free agent.

On January 16, 2001, the Anaheim Angels signed Canseco to an incentive-laden deal heavily based on plate appearances. After only 39 spring training at-bats, in which he hit .231 and no home runs, the Angels cut Canseco. He lost the Anaheim DH spot to Glenallen Hill, with whom he shared at-bats for the Yankees the year prior. (Hill was released by the Angels in June, after hitting .136 with 1 home run in 16 games for the 2001 season, his last in the majors). Canseco spent half of the season with the Newark Bears of the independent Atlantic League, alongside his twin brother Ozzie Canseco, before joining the Chicago White Sox on June 21 to replace Frank Thomas as the every day designated hitter. Wearing jersey number 31 during his first game back in the majors since the 2000 World Series, he went 1-for-5 with a double as the DH, hitting fifth in the lineup. He had 3 RBIs in his second game of the season. His first home run came on June 26 against the Minnesota Twins. During the season he had two 2-homer games, one on July 8 and another on August 1. He finished the season playing in 76 games, hitting 16 home runs and 49 RBIs in only 256 at-bats, a pace of 30+ home runs and 100+ RBIs had he played the entire season. His last home run of the season was the 462nd for his career, and came against Mike Mussina of the New York Yankees, putting Canseco just 38 home runs away from reaching the 500-home run milestone, at age 37.

In the spring of 2002, Canseco was signed to a minor league contract by the Montreal Expos, who were at the time owned by Major League Baseball, had Omar Minaya as general manager and Frank Robinson as manager. Despite making only 13 appearances in the outfield in the previous three years, he was expected to be the Expos&#x27; left fielder, and the designated hitter during inter-league play, in what would have been Canseco&#x27;s first time playing for a National League club. He played 14 preseason games, batting .200 with 3 home runs (tied for the team lead) and 5 RBIs. However, he was again released prior to the regular season start, this time four days before Opening Day. The Expos invited Canseco to be part of their Triple-A team, but he declined the offer. With Opening Day scheduled for March 31, Canseco did not find a team looking for a DH and signed a minor league contract with a White Sox affiliate, the Charlotte Knights, for whom he hit .172 with 5 home runs in 18 minor league games. 
Only 38 home runs shy of 500 for his career, Canseco officially announced his retirement from Major League Baseball on May 13, 2002. At the time of his retirement, Canseco had 1,942 career strikeouts, second all time only to Reggie Jackson. By the end of the 2024 season, he is 10th on the all-time list for hitters with the most strikeouts.

At 39 years old he made a brief comeback attempt in 2004, attending an open tryout with the Los Angeles Dodgers, but was not offered a spot with the team nor with any of their minor league affiliates.

===Independent League career (2006–2018)===

On June 29, 2006, the independent Golden Baseball League announced that Canseco had agreed to a contract to play with the San Diego Surf Dawgs. After playing one game for the Surf Dawgs, Canseco was traded to the Long Beach Armada on July 5, 2006. He requested the trade due to &quot;family obligations.&quot; On July 31, 2006, Canseco won the Golden Baseball League&#x27;s Home Run Derby.

Canseco signed a short team deal with the Laredo Broncos of the United Baseball League on August 14, 2010. He served as bench coach and designated hitter.

On April 11, 2011, Canseco signed a deal as a player/manager for the Yuma Scorpions of the North American League. At the age of 46, he played 64 out of 88 games and batted .258 with 8 home runs and 46 RBIs. He was not the oldest player on the team: his twin brother Ozzie appeared in 12 games, mostly as a designated hitter, and 52-year-old Tony Phillips appeared in 24 games, mostly as a third baseman. Canseco joined the Quintana Roo Tigres of the Mexican League in 2012, but was reportedly banned for using testosterone. During his tryout, he went 4 for 11 with a home run, 4 RBI and 3 walks. After the series, he gave himself the nickname &quot;El Cubano Cañonero&quot; (&quot;the Cuban Cannon&quot;).
On April 20, 2012, the Worcester Tornadoes of the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball announced that they had signed Canseco to a one-season contract for a salary of one thousand dollars a month. In the beginning of August 2012, Canseco left the Tornadoes due to concerns of not receiving his salary, a conflict which led him to sue the team. Canseco quickly signed with the Rio Grande Valley WhiteWings of the North American League. However, his debut was delayed due to a family emergency.

In early 2013 Canseco played in the Texas Winter League but was only 3-for-16 at the plate. He signed with the Fort Worth Cats of the United League to start the 2013 season.

In 2015, 2016, and 2017, Canseco had short playing stints in the Pacific Association, mostly with the Pittsburg Diamonds. Although he has not played Major League Baseball since 2001, Canseco has played for numerous minor-league teams over the years, most recently in 2018, when he was 53 years of age, for the Normal CornBelters of the Independent Frontier League. In recent years, he has usually played just a few games per season, but in 2011, he played 64 out of 88 games for the Yuma Scorpions of the North American League. Canseco played 30 seasons of professional baseball over a span of 36 years between 1982 and 2018.

===Amateur Adult Baseball (2011 and 2016)===
In March 2011, Canseco played a few games with the Valley Rays in the Pacific Coast Baseball League in Los Angeles.

In May 2016, Canseco made an appearance for the SoCal Glory in the 35+ MSBL Las Vegas Open – National Tournament.

In 2005, Canseco admitted to using anabolic steroids with Jorge Delgado, Damaso Moreno, and Manuel Collado in a tell-all book, &quot;&quot;. Canseco also claimed that up to 85% of major league players took steroids, a figure disputed by many in the game. In the book, Canseco specifically identified former teammates Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, Jason Giambi, Iván Rodríguez, and Juan González as fellow steroid users, and admitted that he injected them. Most of the players named in the book initially denied steroid use, though Giambi admitted to steroid use in testimony before a grand jury investigating the BALCO case and on January 11, 2010, McGwire admitted publicly to using steroids.

At a Congressional hearing on the subject of steroids in sports, Palmeiro categorically denied using performance-enhancing drugs, while McGwire repeatedly refused to answer questions on his own suspected use, saying he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to talk about the past&quot;. Canseco&#x27;s book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. On August 1, 2005, Palmeiro was suspended for 10 days by Major League Baseball after testing positive for steroids.

On December 13, 2007, Canseco and Jorge Delgado were cited in the Mitchell Report (&quot;The Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball)&quot;. On December 20, 2007, Canseco was also named in Jason Grimsley&#x27;s unsealed affidavit as a user of steroids. Canseco and Grimsley were teammates on the 2000 New York Yankees.

On December 30, 2007, it was announced that Canseco had reached a deal for his sequel to &quot;&quot;. The sequel is titled &quot;Vindicated&quot;, which hit bookstores by Opening Day 2008. This book has information on Alex Rodriguez and Albert Belle, as suggested by Canseco. Canseco said the book was a &quot;clarification&quot; of names that should have been mentioned in the Mitchell Report.

In 2010, Canseco spoke out against PEDs advocating baseball&#x27;s youth to not try them, and criticized their effectiveness overall:

&quot;These kids don&#x27;t need steroids to become players...we overemphasize the steroids and not the athletic ability and skills of these people. We&#x27;re taking away the hard work the athlete puts in and saying he became great just because of steroids. Let me give you a perfect example. I have an identical twin brother, Ozzie. He is the closest thing to me genetically. And in my prime, I was a super athlete.&quot; &quot;My twin brother used the same chemicals, same workouts, the same nutrition. Why didn&#x27;t he make it in the big leagues? That is the perfect example that we are giving steroids way too much credit. If steroids are that great, it would have made him a superstar.&quot;

In a 2012 Sportsnet Interview article, Canseco said one of his only seasons without performance-enhancing drugs was in 1998 with the Toronto Blue Jays because he was in the process of a divorce and &quot;didn&#x27;t want to use steroids while handling breakup-induced depression&quot;.

==Outside baseball==
While still a player, he was a guest star on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot; and &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. Since his retirement, Canseco has appeared on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch&quot;, &quot;Boomer and Carton&quot;, &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, &quot;CMI: The Chris Myers Interview&quot;, and &quot;Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List&quot;. In 2003, he was featured in the reality-TV special &quot;Stripper&#x27;s Ball: Jenna Jameson&quot; with Dennis Rodman and Magic Johnson. He was a cast member in Season 5 of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; with Janice Dickinson, Pepa of Salt-N-Pepa, Bronson Pinchot, Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, Caprice Bourret, and Carey Hart. Canseco has a film cameo playing himself in the 2017 basketball drama &quot;Slamma Jamma&quot; as a judge in a slam dunk competition.

In 2007, he received 6 Hall of Fame votes. This accounted for 1.1% of the ballots, failing to reach the 5% threshold necessary to stay on the ballot for another year. However, he can be elected to the Hall of Fame by the Committee of Baseball Veterans.

In 2008, Philadelphia sportscaster and former NFL football player Vai Sikahema accepted a challenge from Canseco. The fight took place on July 12 in Atlantic City at the Bernie Robbins stadium. The Sikahema knocked out the Canseco in the first round. Canseco earned $35,000 for the fight.

On January 24, 2009, Canseco fought radio personality and former child actor Danny Bonaduce in Aston Township, Pennsylvania; the three-round match ended in a majority draw.

Canseco claims to hold black belts in karate and taekwondo, and to practice Muay Thai, as well as describing himself as &quot;an expert with nunchakus&quot;. He made his mixed martial arts debut at Dream 9 on May 26, 2009, where he fought kickboxer Hong-man Choi as part of Dream&#x27;s Super Hulk Tournament. Canseco would lose the fight after slipping, and tapping out to Choi&#x27;s ground and pound.

On November 6, 2009, Canseco defeated Todd Poulton in a Celebrity Boxing Federation bout in Springfield, Massachusetts. As of December 2010, he had launched a Twitter campaign in hopes of getting invited to spring training by Mets GM Sandy Alderson.

Beginning March 6, 2011, Canseco was a contestant on &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. He quit the show on April 3, 2011, citing his father&#x27;s ailing health. Canseco later announced on Twitter that his father died shortly after he left the show. Canseco did earn $25,000 for his charity, the Baseball Assistance Team.

In 2012, Canseco accepted a home run derby challenge by Canadian semi-pro baseball player Evan Malamud, father of 3 boys on the autism spectrum, as part of a fundraiser for an initiative called Home Runs For Autism. Canseco still remains active with the charity as their spokesperson.

He is also a columnist for &quot;Vice&quot; magazine.

Lane Patorti and Edward Stoney Landon finished a reality show concept based on former professional athletes being placed into small-town sports leagues. TMZ reported Canseco was in talks to star in the show, &quot;A League of His Own&quot;.

In May 2013, Canseco provided the foreword to the novel &quot;Air Force Gator 2: Scales of Justice&quot; by Dan Ryckert. In it, he claims the book about the alcoholic alligator pilot is a &quot;weakly veiled&quot; metaphor for his own life.

On October 28, 2014, Canseco accidentally shot himself on his left hand and injured one of his fingers while attempting to clean his gun at home in Las Vegas. During surgery, doctors were able reattach his finger with a piece of bone from his hip.

Canseco was also portrayed by Andy Samberg in &quot;The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience&quot; alongside Mark McGwire (portrayed by Akiva Schaffer). The visual poem describes the two baseball players&#x27; careers and rampant steroid use in the 1980s.

On October 26, 2019, Canseco opened up his own car wash in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he signs autographs every Wednesday.

On February 5, 2021, Canseco fought Billy Football from Barstool Sports in a boxing match, and was knocked out in the first round.

In August 2024, Canseco was inducted into the Oakland Athletics Hall of Fame.

==Legal issues and controversies==
On February 10, 1989, Canseco was arrested in Florida for reckless driving after allegedly leading an officer on a 15-mile chase. He was found guilty and fined $500.

On April 11, 1989, Canseco was arrested in California for carrying a loaded semi-automatic pistol in his car. He was released on $2,500 bail and pleaded no contest.

On February 13, 1992, Canseco was charged with aggravated battery for ramming his Porsche into a BMW driven by his then-wife Esther Canseco after a verbal altercation. On March 19, 1992, Canseco pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated assault and later underwent counseling and fulfilled a community-service requirement.

In November 1997, Canseco was arrested for beating his then-wife Jessica Canseco. In January 1998, he pleaded no contest and was sentenced to one year of probation and required to attend counseling.

In October 2001, Canseco and his brother, Ozzie, got into a fight with two men at a Miami Beach nightclub that left one man with a broken nose and another needing 20 stitches in his lip; both were charged with two counts of aggravated battery. The brothers both pleaded guilty and received both probation and community service.

Following his retirement in May 2002, Canseco speculated about having been &quot;blackballed&quot; from Major League Baseball; it was then he announced he was writing a tell-all book about his baseball career and the increasing usage of anabolic steroids in baseball.

In March 2003, Canseco missed a court appearance while in California working out a custody dispute over his 6-year-old child. The judge revoked his probation and sentenced him to two years under house arrest followed by three years&#x27; probation.

In June 2003, Canseco was arrested at his home for probation violation after he tested positive for steroids. Canseco spent a month in jail without bail.

In May 2008, Canseco revealed that he had lost his house in Encino, California, to foreclosure saying his two divorces had cost him $7 to $8 million each.

On October 10, 2008, Canseco was detained by immigration officials at a San Diego border crossing as he tried to bring a fertility drug from Mexico. He stated the drug was to help with his hormone replacement therapy, needed due to his use of steroids. On November 4, 2008, Canseco pleaded guilty in Federal court and was sentenced to 12 months&#x27; unsupervised probation by U.S. Magistrate Judge Ruben B. Brooks.

The 2008 A&amp;E Network documentary &quot;Jose Canseco: Last Shot&quot; chronicles Canseco&#x27;s attempts to end his steroid use. In it, he also regrets ever writing his tell-all books and naming former teammates as steroid users, as he was never given the opportunity to participate in MLB-affiliated baseball events. Since then, he has tried unsuccessfully to reach out to former Bash Brother Mark McGwire and other ex-teammates. In 2014, he returned to the Oakland Coliseum to take part in the reunion celebrating the 25th anniversary of the 1989 World Series championship team; this marked the first time Canseco took part in an official Major League Baseball event in almost 13 years. Mark McGwire, at the time coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers, did not attend the event.

On May 22, 2013, Canseco was named as a suspect in a rape allegation in Las Vegas. He broke the news himself on Twitter, denying the allegations by posting pictures and information about his accuser, and accusing her of lying. On June 7, 2013, the case against Canseco was closed following an investigation, and he was not charged.

<text>WWKB (1520 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Buffalo, New York. It broadcasts a sports gambling format and is one of two sports radio stations owned and operated by Audacy, Inc. in the Buffalo market. WWKB&#x27;s Buffalo sister station WGR primarily broadcasts local sports programming. The studios are on Corporate Parkway in Amherst, New York. The station used the WKBW callsign from its founding in 1926 until 1986, and during various periods, previously carried pop-rock music and talk radio.

WWKB broadcasts with a power of 50,000 watts, the maximum permitted for AM stations in the U.S. It is one of two 50,000 watt AM stations in Western New York, along with WHAM in Rochester. WWKB is a clear channel station, sharing its Class A status on 1520 kHz with KOKC in Oklahoma City. WWKB uses a directional antenna with a three-tower array. Its transmitter site is shared with WGR on Big Tree Road in Blasdell, New York.

WWKB&#x27;s primary daytime signal covers all of Western New York, including Rochester, as well as the Southern Tier. It provides secondary coverage to much of Southern Ontario, including Toronto, and can be heard as far east as Kingston.

At night, to mutually protect KOKC from interference, it must direct its signal eastward. Thus, while WWKB can be heard across most of the eastern half of North America at night, its signal is spotty only 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Buffalo. Local residents remain largely unaware that the antenna array is internationally famous for sending WWKB&#x27;s nighttime signal to all over Nordic countries on a regular basis. The directional nighttime signal has resulted the station being commonly heard in parts of Finland and Sweden using special DX equipment during winter months. A group of Scandinavian radio reception enthusiasts visited for conference at a Camp Road motel, to view the transmitter array, apparently to photograph and measure it.

==Programming==
Most programming comes from the co-owned BetQL Network, with some shows from Infinity Sports Network. Audacy uses WWKB as an overflow station for WGR&#x27;s sports coverage. When two teams to which WGR owns the rights are playing at the same time, the more important event usually airs on WGR, with the lesser event on WWKB.

===Sports coverage===
* Buffalo Bills professional football home games
* National Football League on Westwood One (in season, overflow from WGR when WGR does Bills games)
* Select Buffalo Sabres professional National Hockey League preseason and prospect tournament games
* Buffalo Bandits lacrosse (in season)
* Buffalo Bisons minor league baseball (in season)
* Buffalo Bulls football and basketball (University at Buffalo, beginning 2014)

WWKB&#x27;s 50,000 watt signal makes it a desirable outlet for the Buffalo&#x27;s second-tier sports teams: the Buffalo Bandits have aired on the station since the 2006 season (moving from WGR where it took the place of the locked-out Sabres in 2005), Buffalo Bulls football and basketball, and, on and off, the Buffalo Bisons, who moved back to the station in April 2008.

WWKB&#x27;s Bills home games are broadcast live, without a broadcast delay, primarily for the benefit of listeners inside Highmark Stadium. The Buffalo Bills Radio Network broadcast airs on WGR. The use of WWKB as a de facto co-flagship would also allow the Bills&#x27; home team broadcast to be heard across the East Coast if they were to reach the Super Bowl.

==History==
===Early years===
The station began operations, as WKBW, in late October 1926. It was originally licensed to Coatsworth &amp; Diebold, but ownership was soon changed to the Churchill Evangelistic Association. Founder Clinton Churchill&#x27;s application to the Department of Commerce for a station license reportedly requested assignment of the call letters &quot;WAY&quot;; however, this call sign was already in use by a ship, the &quot;Admiral Dewey&quot;, so the station was instead randomly assigned &quot;WKBW&quot; from a sequential list of available call signs. Churchill adopted a slogan of &quot;Well Known Bible Witness&quot; based on the call letters, and later usage referred to the middle letters &quot;KB&quot; as standing for &quot;King of Buffalo&quot;, reflecting its 50,000-watt transmitting power.

WKBW was founded during a period when the U.S. government had temporarily lost its authority to assign transmitting frequencies. There were immediate complaints from the region that WKBW, on its self-assigned frequency, was badly interfering with the reception of multiple other stations. At the end of 1926 the station was reported transmitting on a non-standard frequency of 827 kHz.

The Federal Radio Commission (FRC) was formed in early 1927, which restored the U.S. government authority to assign station frequencies. This resulted in a series of frequency shifts that year for WKBW, including reassignments to 980, 1010 and finally 1380 kHz. On November 11, 1928, as a result of the FRC&#x27;s General Order 40, WKBW changed to 1470 kHz, a &quot;high power regional&quot; frequency, and raised its power to 5,000 watts—the first Buffalo station to increase to that level. In early 1930 WKBW, along with KFJF in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was reassigned to 1480 kHz, another &quot;high power regional&quot; frequency.

In March 1941 WKBW inaugurated a new transmitter plant south of Buffalo in the town of Hamburg, increased power to 50,000 watts around the clock and shifted to its current &quot;clear channel&quot; frequency of 1520 kHz as a result of North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, with the provision that as &quot;Class I-B&quot; stations, it and its Oklahoma City counterpart, now KOMA, had to maintain directional antennas at night to mutually protect each other from interference.

During the 1930s, WKBW shared a CBS affiliation with then-sister station WGR, and in the 1940s, was affiliated with the NBC Blue network and its corporate successor ABC, running as a conventional full service network affiliated station also offering local news and music programming. The station later broadcast a wide variety of ethnic, country and western and religious programming when not carrying network offerings, including pioneer rock and roll and rhythm and blues shows launched in the 1950s by disk jockey George &quot;Hounddog&quot; Lorenz, later founder of pioneer FM urban station WBLK. Stan Barron served as the station&#x27;s sports director in this era.

===Top 40 era===
On July 4, 1958, a few months before companion station WKBW-TV (channel 7) was launched, WKBW radio abandoned its adult approach and was converted into a personality-driven full service Top 40 music radio station, featuring foreground personalities, a tight playlist of current hits and an aggressive local news department, which it continued to program with great success for over 20 years. It was one of the first stations to present traffic reports in cooperation with police and state and local authorities. Churchill sold WKBW-AM-TV to Capital Cities Broadcasting in 1961, earning a handsome return on his original investment of 35 years earlier.

During the exclusive Monkees &quot;Sleepy Jean&quot;/&quot;Daydream Believer&quot; broadcast in 1967, a recording was made in Sidi Yahia, Morocco. On Halloween Night 1968, writer Dan Kriegler and then-program director Jefferson Kaye (later the voice of WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, co-owned with WKBW-TV in 1971) commemorated the 30th anniversary of Orson Welles&#x27; 1938 &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; by re-making the infamous broadcast, updating the storyline and changing locations to make it significant to Buffalo listeners. Kaye (the voice of NFL Films) did another equally well-received remake of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; in 1972 using a revised script and some new cast members including Jackson Armstrong and newsmen Jim McLaughlin and Joe Downey. Both versions have been recorded and collected by aficionados of classic radio programming.

During the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, WKBW became a major force in pop radio over the East Coast. KB had a 50,000-watt transmitter (the maximum power allowed) at their transmitter site in Hamburg. This high power blanketed the entire eastern U.S. with Top 40 music every night, and the station actually had a better signal at night in the western Boston suburbs than Boston&#x27;s own Top 40 station, WMEX, located at 1510, right next door to WKBW. Disk jockeys included future &quot;Price Is Right&quot; announcer Rod Roddy, Dick Biondi, Danny Neaverth, Jack Armstrong, Joey Reynolds, Steve Mitchell, Bud Ballou, Norm Marshall, Tom Shannon, and the Amazin&#x27; Jim Quinn. Art Wander served as news director from 1956 to 1958, followed by Irv Weinstein from 1958 to 1964; Stan Barron, a holdover from the pre-rock and roll era, handled sports until his departure in 1965. Mike Joseph, later creator of the Hot Hits format, was a major off-air contributor to the station&#x27;s approach to the &quot;futuresonic&quot; Top-40 format.

Beginning in the late 1960s, WKBW devoted a nightly hour of programming to underground music with its &quot;Mixed Bag&quot; block, one of the few commercial AM stations to embrace the freeform format; it was highly unusual for a 50,000-watt AM station to embrace the format that had theretofore been largely an FM and noncommercial phenomenon. In 1969, WKBW became the first radio station to air cuts from The Beatles&#x27; unreleased &quot;Get Back&quot; album. The recordings had been compiled from material The Beatles recorded in London in January 1969, the same sessions that would be used in The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be album&quot;, released in May 1970. Although WKBW was the first station to air the &quot;Get Back&quot; tapes, WBCN in Boston would be better known for playing them, as its broadcast of the tapes was preserved on a high-quality reel, which spawned several widely circulated bootlegs of The Beatles.

A recreated example of WKBW as an early 1960s-era pop radio station can be found on Ron Jacobs&#x27; &quot;Cruisin&#x27; 1960&quot; (Increase Records INCR 5–2005). This recreation features Dick Biondi and includes several classic rock and pop songs of that era, contemporary commercials, and DJ patter.

===The 1980s and 1990s===
The station continued with the Top 40 format until 1981, when, facing the emergence of FM competition, the station evolved to more of an adult contemporary format. By 1983, they leaned toward rock and roll oldies while still playing AC songs. They also added talk radio shows in the evenings by 1984. On June 15 of that year, the station began broadcasting in AM stereo using the C-QUAM system.

In 1986, the WKBW stations were broken up as a result of Capital Cities&#x27; purchase of the American Broadcasting Company. WKBW radio was sold to Price Communications, who subsequently changed the station&#x27;s call letters to the current WWKB on January 3, mainly to keep the long-standing &quot;KB&quot; slogan (which was necessitated due to an FCC regulation in effect then that forbade TV and radio stations in the same city, but with different owners from sharing the same call letters; the former calls remained on now-former sister station WKBW-TV, which Capital Cities/ABC sold to Queen City Broadcasting). In 1987, the station moved to a full service oldies format and on June 18, 1988, the station dropped live programming and switched to satellite-fed oldies. On March 6, 1989, WWKB flipped to business talk as part of the &quot;Business Radio Network&quot;. It flipped to hot talk in 1993. WWKB aired J. R. Gach from WGR as the afternoon drive show and established syndicated hot talkers The Howard Stern Show (by this time now almost exclusively on the FM dial), G. Gordon Liddy, Laura Schlessinger, The Fabulous Sports Babe, Tom Leykis and (briefly, before Gach&#x27;s arrival) Don and Mike. John Otto hosted a late night program in this era. Stern&#x27;s and Gach&#x27;s presence was not enough to revive KB&#x27;s ratings in what was then a three way news-talk battle also involving market-leading WBEN and contender WGR, which itself later switched to its current format of sports talk and play by play.

By 1996, the format was flipped again to country music as &quot;Real Country 1520 KB&quot; (this despite there being three other country stations in Buffalo, WYRK, 107.7 and WXRL). Following that in 1998, was an all sports format using the now-defunct mono-only One on One Sports network, which moved to 107.7 after two years. On January 29, 2000, WWKB flipped to a simulcast of sister station WKSE. This lasted until June of that year, when it returned to business talk, a low-cost, albeit unpopular format.

Price Communications presided over the collapse of its entire radio portfolio including WWKB and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1992. After reorganization, WWKB was sold to Keymarket Communications in 1994. Around the same time, Keymarket acquired one of WWKB&#x27;s longtime rivals, WBEN, from locally based owners at a premium price. Keymarket then sold both WWKB and WBEN to St. Louis-based River City Broadcasting in 1995. Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired WWKB and WBEN in 1996 through its purchase of River City. A year later, Sinclair bought WGR, bringing three of Buffalo&#x27;s heritage AM stations under its portfolio. In 1999, Sinclair decided to divest its radio stations, selling most of them, including WWKB, WBEN and WGR, to Entercom Communications.

===The Legend returns===
On January 27, 2003, WWKB returned to music, playing oldies from the station&#x27;s heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, featuring artists such as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Frankie Lymon, The Four Seasons, The Who, The Four Tops, The Everly Brothers, Fats Domino, Ricky Nelson, Lovin Spoonful, and many others. The oldies format was an attempt to recreate the station&#x27;s history as a popular music station (and was part of a nationwide fad of &quot;real oldies&quot; formats on AM radio stations in the early 2000s). While it maintained the official WWKB calls for station identification, it also played the original &quot;WKBW Buffalo&quot; jingles and featured many of the classic WKBW jocks including Armstrong and Neaverth. While not performing as well in Arbitron ratings as it had in its golden past, the revived &quot;WKBW&quot; earned the best ratings for the station since the 1990s, with approximately a 2 share, and was beginning to grow.

===Progressive talk era===
Personality oldies has been a successful format in many markets, and Entercom salesman Buddy Shula would indeed find success with essentially the same format (including, for a time, Danny Neaverth and Tom Donahue) on WECK several years later. Nevertheless, Entercom found the personality oldies format too expensive to maintain in Buffalo for only a 2 share, and so on February 6, 2006, WWKB ended a three-year run as an oldies station with a format change to predominantly syndicated progressive talk. A syndicated overnight show hosted by former WKBW personality Joey Reynolds survived the format change. WWKB maintained their liberal talk format for another seven years. On April 16, 2008, the station started airing Randi Rhodes of the Nova-M Radio network, who had been fired from Air America.

The classic &quot;WKBW&quot; was honored by XM Satellite Radio on November 30, 2007, in a five-hour &quot;Sonic Sound Salute&quot; on The 60s on 6.

On July 3, 2008, ForgottenBuffalo.com celebrated the 50th anniversary of KB&#x27;s format switch to Top 40 with a sidewalk sock hop. The event was held in front of the original studios located at 1430 Main Street in Buffalo. KB alumni Danny Neaverth, Stan Roberts and Tom Donahue attended. A limited edition poster commemorating the anniversary was produced.

As late as 2010 there were ongoing reports alleging that Entercom had cut back WWKB&#x27;s power to 10,000 watts, to reduce electrical costs. However, Entercom did not file with the Federal Communications Commission to do so, and such a reduction was unconfirmed; indications are that the station&#x27;s signal and range remained normal.

===ESPN 1520===
On September 5, 2013, WWKB flipped to sports radio under the brand &quot;ESPN 1520AM&quot;. The ESPN Radio affiliation had previously been on WGR from the network&#x27;s launch in 1992 until 2013; WGR&#x27;s increased emphasis on local programming (and, since &quot;The Phil Hendrie Show&quot; moved to an earlier time slot, a lack of progressive talk programs to air in the overnight hours) prompted Entercom to move the ESPN affiliation to a full-time signal. The local sports broadcasts and brokered weekend programs that WWKB carried under its previous format continue under the ESPN affiliation; the station launched with a broadcast of the Buffalo Sabres&#x27; participation in the Traverse City Prospects Tournament.

The station was primarily a straight simulcast of the ESPN Radio feed, with the exception of The Jim Rome Show, at the time part of what was then known as CBS Sports Radio. Rome had previously aired on WGR for over a decade prior before the station opted to rearrange its local programming and move the somewhat lower-rated (and less locally relevant) Rome to WWKB.

===The Bet 1520===
On September 13, 2021, WWKB flipped to sports gambling, branded as &quot;The Bet Buffalo&quot;. Affiliations with &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot; and the station&#x27;s existing live sports programming remained unchanged.

<text>William Stuart Baring-Gould (1913 – 10 August 1967) was a noted Sherlock Holmes scholar, best known as the author of the influential 1962 fictional biography &quot;Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street: A Life of the World&#x27;s First Consulting Detective&quot;.

==Biography==

He was the son of William Drake Baring-Gould (1878–1921), a grandson of Sabine Baring-Gould and a descendant of John Baring. 

He married Lucile &quot;Ceil&quot; Marguerite Moody (1914–2010) in 1936. They had a son William (d. 1966) and a daughter Judy.

He was creative director of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s circulation and corporate education departments from 1937 until his death.

==Writing==
In 1955, Baring-Gould privately published &quot;The Chronological Holmes&quot;, an attempt to lay out, in chronological order, all the events alluded to in the Sherlock Holmes stories. Three years later, Baring-Gould wrote &quot;The Annotated Mother Goose: Nursery Rhymes Old and New, Arranged and Explained&quot; with his wife, Lucile &quot;Ceil&quot; Baring-Gould. The book provides a wealth of information about nursery rhymes and includes often-banned bawdy rhymes. In 1967, Baring-Gould published &quot;The Annotated Sherlock Holmes&quot;, an annotated edition of the Sherlock Holmes canon. Baring-Gould also wrote &quot;The Lure of the Limerick&quot;, a study of the history and allure of limericks, published in 1967; it included a collection of limericks, arranged alphabetically, and a bibliography. In 1969 was published posthumously &quot;Nero Wolfe of West Thirty-fifth Street: The Life and Times of America&#x27;s Largest Private Detective&quot;, a fictional biography of Rex Stout&#x27;s detective character Nero Wolfe; in this book, Baring-Gould popularised the theory that Wolfe was the son of Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler.

<doc id="175560" wikidata="Q1589480" url="?curid=175560" title="Ciphertext">
<text>In cryptography, ciphertext or cyphertext is the result of encryption performed on plaintext using an algorithm, called a cipher. Ciphertext is also known as encrypted or encoded information because it contains a form of the original plaintext that is unreadable by a human or computer without the proper cipher to decrypt it. This process prevents the loss of sensitive information via hacking. Decryption, the inverse of encryption, is the process of turning ciphertext into readable plaintext. Ciphertext is not to be confused with codetext because the latter is a result of a code, not a cipher.

== Conceptual underpinnings ==
Let formula_1 be the plaintext message that Alice wants to secretly transmit to Bob and let formula_2 be the encryption cipher, where formula_3 is a cryptographic key. Alice must first transform the plaintext into ciphertext, formula_4, in order to securely send the message to Bob, as follows:

: formula_5

In a symmetric-key system, Bob knows Alice&#x27;s encryption key. Once the message is encrypted, Alice can safely transmit it to Bob (assuming no one else knows the key). In order to read Alice&#x27;s message, Bob must decrypt the ciphertext using formula_6 which is known as the decryption cipher, formula_7

: formula_8

Alternatively, in a non-symmetric key system, everyone, not just Alice and Bob, knows the encryption key; but the decryption key cannot be inferred from the encryption key. Only Bob knows the decryption key formula_9 and decryption proceeds as

:formula_10

== Types of ciphers ==

The history of cryptography began thousands of years ago. Cryptography uses a variety of different types of encryption. Earlier algorithms were performed by hand and are substantially different from modern algorithms, which are generally executed by a machine.

=== Historical ciphers ===
Historical pen and paper ciphers used in the past are sometimes known as classical ciphers. They include:

* Substitution cipher: the units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext (e.g., Caesar cipher and one-time pad)
** Polyalphabetic substitution cipher: a substitution cipher using multiple substitution alphabets (e.g., Vigenère cipher and Enigma machine)
** Polygraphic substitution cipher: the unit of substitution is a sequence of two or more letters rather than just one (e.g., Playfair cipher)
* Transposition cipher: the ciphertext is a permutation of the plaintext (e.g., rail fence cipher)

Historical ciphers are not generally used as a standalone encryption technique because they are quite easy to crack. Many of the classical ciphers, with the exception of the one-time pad, can be cracked using brute force.

=== Modern ciphers ===
Modern ciphers are more secure than classical ciphers and are designed to withstand a wide range of attacks. An attacker should not be able to find the key used in a modern cipher, even if they know any specifics about the plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext. Modern encryption methods can be divided into the following categories:

* Private-key cryptography (symmetric key algorithm): one shared key is used for encryption and decryption
* Public-key cryptography (asymmetric key algorithm): two different keys are used for encryption and decryption

In a symmetric key algorithm (e.g., DES, AES), the sender and receiver have a shared key established in advance: the sender uses the shared key to perform encryption; the receiver uses the shared key to perform decryption. Symmetric key algorithms can either be block ciphers or stream ciphers. Block ciphers operate on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks, with an unvarying transformation. Stream ciphers encrypt plaintext digits one at a time on a continuous stream of data, with the transformation of successive digits varying during the encryption process.

In an asymmetric key algorithm (e.g., RSA), there are two different keys: a &quot;public key&quot; and a &quot;private key.&quot; The &quot;public key&quot; is published, thereby allowing any sender to perform encryption. The &quot;private key&quot; is kept secret by the receiver, thereby allowing only the receiver to correctly perform decryption.

== Cryptanalysis ==
Cryptanalysis (also referred to as codebreaking or cracking the code) is the study of applying various methodologies to obtain the meaning of encrypted information, without having access to the cipher required to correctly decrypt the information. This typically involves gaining an understanding of the system design and determining the cipher. 

Cryptanalysts can follow one or more attack models to crack a cipher, depending upon what information is available and the type of cipher being analyzed. Ciphertext is generally the most easily obtained part of a cryptosystem and therefore is an important part of cryptanalysis. 

=== Attack models ===
* Ciphertext-only: the cryptanalyst has access only to a collection of ciphertexts or code texts. This is the weakest attack model because the cryptanalyst has limited information. Modern ciphers rarely fail under this attack.
* Known-plaintext: the attacker has a set of ciphertexts to which they know the corresponding plaintext
* Chosen-plaintext attack: the attacker can obtain the ciphertexts corresponding to an arbitrary set of plaintexts of their own choosing
** Batch chosen-plaintext attack: where the cryptanalyst chooses all plaintexts before any of them are encrypted. This is often the meaning of an unqualified use of &quot;chosen-plaintext attack&quot;.
** Adaptive chosen-plaintext attack: where the cryptanalyst makes a series of interactive queries, choosing subsequent plaintexts based on the information from the previous encryptions.
* Chosen-ciphertext attack: the attacker can obtain the plaintexts corresponding to an arbitrary set of ciphertexts of their own choosing
** Adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack
** Indifferent chosen-ciphertext attack
* Related-key attack: similar to a chosen-plaintext attack, except the attacker can obtain ciphertexts encrypted under two different keys. The keys are unknown, but the relationship between them is known (e.g., two keys that differ in the one bit).

* The Shugborough inscription

<doc id="175562" wikidata="Q7743722" url="?curid=175562" title="The Joy of Work">
<text>The Joy of Work (1998) by Scott Adams is a two-part book. The first part offers recommendations as to how office workers can find happiness at their cubicle desks and the second part is a formula for creating humor, based on the author&#x27;s experience penning the &quot;Dilbert&quot; comic strip.

==Synopsis==
The title is a comic reference to the 1972 sex manual &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot;. The first part of the book explains &quot;how to find happiness at the expense of your co-workers&quot;, including how to deal with superiors, meetings and co-workers and how to avoid work while having fun; an entire chapter is devoted to office pranks. The second part is an analysis of humor and how to write funny material. Adams writes, &quot;The third part of the book is made entirely out of invisible pages. If the book seems heavier than it looks, that&#x27;s why.&quot;

The book includes a response to Norman Solomon, who attempted to depict Scott Adams as a proponent of downsizing in his 1997 book, &quot;The Trouble with Dilbert&quot;. People who were offended by certain Dilbert strips are also addressed, with Adams concluding that it is the &quot;proximity&quot; of sensitive subjects to negative concepts that causes &quot;people who are angry for no good reason (nuts)&quot; to take offense.

<text>Bhakti (; Pali: &quot;bhatti&quot;) is a term common in Indian religions which means attachment, fondness for, devotion to, trust, homage, worship, piety, faith, or love. In Indian religions, it may refer to loving devotion for a personal God (like Krishna or Devi), a formless ultimate reality (like Nirguna Brahman or the Sikh God) or for an enlightened being (like a Buddha, a bodhisattva, or a guru). Bhakti is often a deeply emotional devotion based on a relationship between a devotee and the object of devotion.

One of the earliest appearances of the term is found in the early Buddhist &quot;Theragatha&quot; (&quot;Verses of the Elders&quot;). In ancient texts such as the &quot;Shvetashvatara Upanishad&quot;, the term simply means participation, devotion and love for any endeavor, while in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, it connotes one of the possible paths of spirituality and towards moksha, as in &quot;bhakti marga&quot;.

Bhakti ideas have inspired many popular texts and saint-poets in India. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, for example, is a Krishna-related text associated with the Bhakti movement in Hinduism. Bhakti is also found in other religions practiced in India, and it has influenced interactions between Christianity and Hinduism in the modern era. &quot;Nirguni bhakti&quot; (devotion to the divine without attributes) is found in Sikhism, as well as Hinduism. Outside India, emotional devotion is found in some Southeast Asian and East Asian Buddhist traditions.

The term also refers to a movement, pioneered by the Tamil Alvars and Nayanars, that developed around the gods Vishnu (Vaishnavism), Shiva (Shaivism) and Devi (Shaktism) in the second half of the 1st millennium CE.

Devotional elements similar to bhakti have been part of various world religions throughout human history. Devotional practices are found in Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Judaism.

== Terminology ==
The Sanskrit word &quot;bhakti&quot; is derived from the verb root &quot;bhaj-&quot;, which means &quot;to worship, have recourse to, betake onself to&quot; or &quot;bhañj-,&quot; which means &quot;to break.&quot; The word also means &quot;attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation&quot;.

The meaning of the term &quot;Bhakti&quot; is analogous to but different from Kama. Kama connotes emotional connection, sometimes with sensual devotion and erotic love. Bhakti, in contrast, is spiritual, a love and devotion to religious concepts or principles, that engages both emotion and intellection. Karen Pechelis states that the word Bhakti should not be understood as uncritical emotion, but as committed engagement. She adds that, in the concept of &quot;bhakti&quot; in Hinduism, the engagement involves a simultaneous tension between emotion and intellection, &quot;emotion to reaffirm the social context and temporal freedom, intellection to ground the experience in a thoughtful, conscious approach&quot;. One who practices &quot;bhakti&quot; is called a &quot;bhakta&quot;.

The term bhakti, in Vedic Sanskrit literature, has a general meaning of &quot;mutual attachment, devotion, fondness for, devotion to&quot; such as in human relationships, most often between beloved-lover, friend-friend, king-subject, parent-child. It may refer to devotion towards a spiritual teacher (Guru) as &quot;guru-bhakti&quot;, or to a personal God, or for spirituality without form (nirguna).

According to the Sri Lankan Buddhist scholar Sanath Nanayakkara, there is no single term in English that adequately translates or represents the concept of &quot;bhakti&quot; in Indian religions. Terms such as &quot;devotion, faith, devotional faith&quot; represent certain aspects of &quot;bhakti&quot;, but it means much more. The concept includes a sense of deep affection, attachment, but not wish because &quot;wish is selfish, affection is unselfish&quot;. Some scholars, states Nanayakkara, associate it with &quot;saddha&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;Sraddha&quot;) which means &quot;faith, trust or confidence&quot;. However, &quot;bhakti&quot; can connote an end in itself, or a path to spiritual wisdom.

The term &quot;Bhakti&quot; refers to one of several alternate spiritual paths to moksha (spiritual freedom, liberation, salvation) in Hinduism, and it is referred to as &quot;bhakti marga&quot; or &quot;bhakti yoga&quot;. The other paths are &quot;Jnana marga&quot; (path of knowledge), &quot;Karma marga&quot; (path of works), &quot;Rāja marga&quot; (path of contemplation and meditation).

The term &quot;bhakti&quot; has been usually translated as &quot;devotion&quot; in Orientalist literature. The colonial era authors variously described &quot;Bhakti&quot; as a form of mysticism or &quot;primitive&quot; religious devotion of lay people with monotheistic parallels. However, modern scholars state &quot;devotion&quot; is a misleading and incomplete translation of &quot;bhakti&quot;.

Many contemporary scholars have questioned this terminology, and most now trace the term &quot;bhakti&quot; as one of the several spiritual perspectives that emerged from reflections on the Vedic context and Hindu way of life. Bhakti in Indian religions is not a ritualistic devotion to a God or to religion, but participation in a path that includes behavior, ethics, mores and spirituality. It involves, among other things, refining one&#x27;s state of mind, knowing God, participating in God, and internalizing God. Increasingly, instead of &quot;devotion&quot;, the term &quot;participation&quot; is appearing in scholarly literature as a gloss for the term &quot;bhakti&quot;.

&quot;Bhakti&quot; is an important term in Sikhism and Hinduism. They both share numerous concepts and core spiritual ideas, but &quot;bhakti&quot; of &quot;nirguni&quot; (devotion to divine without attributes) is particularly significant in Sikhism. In Hinduism, diverse ideas continue, where both &quot;saguni&quot; and &quot;nirguni&quot; bhakti (devotion to divine with or without attributes) or alternate paths to spirituality are among the options left to the choice of a Hindu.

== History of Hindu bhakti ==
=== The Upanishads ===
The last of three epilogue verses of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (6.23), dated to be from 1st millennium BCE, uses the word &quot;Bhakti&quot; as follows:

This verse is one of the earliest use of the word &quot;Bhakti&quot; in ancient Indian literature, and has been translated as &quot;the love of God&quot;. Scholars have debated whether this phrase is authentic or later insertion into the Upanishad, and whether the terms &quot;Bhakti&quot; and &quot;Deva&quot; meant the same in this ancient text as they do in the modern era. Max Muller states that the word &quot;Bhakti&quot; appears only once in this Upanishad, that too in one last verse of the epilogue, could have been a later addition and may not be theistic as the word was later used in much later &quot;Sandilya Sutras&quot;. Grierson as well as Carus note that the first epilogue verse 6.21 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad is also notable for its use of the word &quot;Deva Prasada&quot; (देवप्रसाद, grace or gift of God), but add that &quot;Deva&quot; in the epilogue of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad refers to &quot;pantheistic Brahman&quot; and the closing credit to sage Shvetashvatara in verse 6.21 can mean &quot;gift or grace of his Soul&quot;.

===Post-Vedic movement===
Scholarly consensus sees &quot;bhakti&quot; as a post-Vedic movement that developed primarily during the Hindu Epics and Puranas era of Indian history (late first mill. BCE-early first mill. CE).

The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; is the first text to explicitly use the word &quot;bhakti&quot; to designate a religious path, using it as a term for one of three possible religious approaches or yogas (i.e. bhakti yoga).

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; (which focuses on Krishna bhakti) develops the idea more elaborately, while the &quot;Shvetashvatara Upanishad&quot; presents evidence of &quot;guru-bhakti&quot; (devotion to one&#x27;s spiritual teacher).

=== Bhakti movement ===

The &quot;Bhakti Movement&quot; was a rapid growth of bhakti, first starting in the later part of 1st millennium CE, from Tamil Nadu in southern India with the Shaiva Nayanars and the Vaishnava Alvars. Their ideas and practices inspired bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India over the 12th-18th century CE. The Alvars (&quot;those immersed in God&quot;) were Vaishnava poet-saints who wandered from temple to temple, singing the praises of Vishnu. They hailed the divine abodes of Vishnu and converted many people to Vaishnavism.

Like the Alvars, the Shaiva Nayanar poets were influential. The &quot;Tirumurai&quot;, a compilation of hymns by sixty-three Nayanar poets, is still of great importance in South India. Hymns by three of the most prominent poets, Appar (7th century CE), Campantar (7th century) and Sundarar (9th century), were compiled into the &quot;Tevaram&quot;, the first volumes of the &quot;Tirumurai&quot;. The poets&#x27; itinerant lifestyle helped create temple and pilgrimage sites and spread devotion to Shiva. Early Tamil-Shiva bhakti poets quoted the Krishna Yajurveda. The Alvars and Nayanars were instrumental in propagating the Bhakti tradition. The Bhagavata Purana&#x27;s references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on &quot;bhakti&quot;, have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that &quot;bhakti&quot; movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.

Scholars state that the &quot;bhakti&quot; movement focused on Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti and other deities, that developed and spread in India, was in response to the arrival of Islam in India about 8th century CE, and subsequent religious violence. This view is contested by other scholars.

The Bhakti movement swept over east and north India from the fifteenth-century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE. According to Patton Burchett, the four key features of this early modern bhakti movement in north India were:First and foremost, these communities were united by a distinctive focus on personal devotion to the Divine, as opposed to other traditional pillars of Indic religiosity such as knowledge, ritual, or the practice of yoga or asceticism. This devotion took place in the context of an intimate, loving relationship with the Divine in which caste, class, or gender typically were said to have no place. This was a bhakti that found its most characteristic expression in (a) the context of spiritual fellowship (satsaṅg) with other devotees (bhaktas), (b) the medium of song, (c) the idiom of passionate love (śṛṅgāra/mādhurya) or painful separation (viraha), and (d) the remembrance—in meditation, recitation, chant, and song—of the name(s) of God. Second, these new devotional communities of Mughal India were alike in their production and performance of devotional works, composed in vernacular languages, remembering the deeds of God (especially Kṛṣṇa and Rām) and exemplary bhaktas. Third, important in all these communities was the performance and collection of songs attributed to renowned bhakti poet-saints like Kabīr, Raidās, and Sūrdās. Finally, despite their many differences, the vast majority of bhakti authors and sectarian communities in early modern North India came together in articulating a devotional sensibility distinct from—and often explicitly positioned in opposition to—certain tantric paradigms of religiosity.Bhakti poetry and ideas influenced many aspects of Hindu culture, religious and secular, and became an integral part of Indian society. It extended its influence to Sufism, Christianity, and Jainism. Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak in the 15th century, during the bhakti movement period, and scholars have identified it as drawing from many Bhakti traditions and ideas.

Saints such as Mirabai, Soordas, Narsinh Mehta composed several bhajans that were a path towards Bhakti for many, that are universally sung even today. A modern age saint, Shri Devendra Ghia (Kaka) has composed about 10,000 hymns. These hymns are related to bhakti, knowledge, devotion, faith, introspection and honesty.

The movement has traditionally been considered as an influential social reformation in Hinduism, and provided an individual-focused alternative path to spirituality regardless of one&#x27;s birth caste or gender. Postmodern scholars question this traditional view and whether the Bhakti movement were ever a social reform or rebellion of any kind. They suggest Bhakti movement was a revival, reworking and recontextualization of ancient Vedic traditions.

== Types and classifications ==
=== Bhakti Yoga ===

The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; introduces bhakti yoga in combination with &quot;karma yoga&quot; and &quot;jnana yoga&quot;, while the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; expands on bhakti yoga, offering nine specific activities for the bhakti yogi. Bhakti in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; offered an alternative to two dominant practices of religion at the time: the isolation of the sannyasin and the practice of religious ritual. &quot;Bhakti Yoga&quot; is described by Swami Vivekananda as &quot;the path of systematized devotion for the attainment of union with the Absolute&quot;. In various chapters, including the twelfth chapter of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, Krishna describes &quot;bhakti yoga&quot; as one of the paths to the highest spiritual attainments. In the sixth chapter, for example, the Gita states the following about bhakti yogi:
The &quot;Shandilya Bhakti Sutra&quot; and &quot;Narada Bhakti Sutra&quot; define devotion, emphasize its importance and superiority, and classify its forms.

According to Ramana Maharishi, bhakti is a &quot;surrender to the divine with one&#x27;s heart&quot;. It can be practiced as an adjunct to self-inquiry, and in one of four ways:
# Atma-Bhakti: devotion to the one&#x27;s &quot;atma&quot; (Supreme Self)
# Ishvara-Bhakti: devotion to a formless being (God, Cosmic Lord)
# Ishta Devata-Bhakti: devotion to a personal God or goddess
# Guru-Bhakti: devotion to Guru

=== Nine forms of Bhakti ===
The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; (verse 7.5.23) teaches nine forms of bhakti:
The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; describes many examples of bhakti, such as those exhibited by Prahlada and the gopis. The behavior of the gopis in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; exemplifies the essence of bhakti. When separated from Krishna, the gopis practiced devotion by listening to his stories (&quot;śravaṇa&quot;), praising his glorious deeds (&quot;kīrtana&quot;), and other acts to keep him in their thoughts.

=== Bhavas ===
Traditional Hinduism speaks of five different &quot;bhāvas&quot; or &quot;affective essences&quot;. In this sense, &quot;bhāvas&quot; are different attitudes that a devotee takes according to his individual temperament to express his devotion towards God in some form. The different &quot;bhāvas&quot; are:
# &quot;śānta&quot;, placid love for God;
# &quot;dāsya&quot;, the attitude of a servant;
# &quot;sakhya&quot;, the attitude of a friend;
# &quot;vātsalya&quot;, the attitude of a mother towards her child;
# &quot;madhurya&quot;, the attitude of a woman towards her lover.

Several saints are known to have practiced these &quot;bhavas&quot;. The nineteenth century mystic, Ramakrishna is said to have practiced these five &quot;bhavas&quot;. The attitude of Hanuman towards the god Rama is considered to be of &quot;dasya bhava&quot;. The approach of Arjuna and the cowherd boys of Vrindavan with the god Krishna is regarded as &quot;sakhya bhava&quot;. Radha&#x27;s love towards Krishna is &quot;madhurya bhava&quot;. The attitude of Krishna&#x27;s foster-mother Yashoda towards him exemplifies &quot;vatsalya bhava&quot;. The &quot;Chaitanya Charitamrita&quot; mentions that Chaitanya came to distribute the four spiritual sentiments of Vraja loka: dasya, sakhya, vatsalya, and sringara. Sringara is the relationship of the intimate love.

=== Murti ===
In &quot;bhakti&quot; worship, rituals are primarily directed towards physical images. The terms &quot;murti&quot; and &quot;vigraham&quot; are commonly used in Hinduism to describe these images. A &quot;murti&quot; denotes an object with a distinct form that symbolizes the shape or manifestation of a particular deity, either a god or goddess. A ritual called &quot;pranapratishta&quot; is performed before worshipping a murti, establishing &quot;prana&quot; (life force) into the image and inviting the god or goddess to reside in the murti.

== In other religions ==
=== Buddhism ===


Bhakti (&quot;bhatti&quot; in Pali) has always been a common aspect of Buddhism, where offerings, prostrations, chants, and individual or group prayers are made to the Buddha and &quot;bodhisattvas&quot;, or to other Buddhist deities. According to Karel Werner Buddhist bhakti &quot;had its beginnings in the earliest days&quot;. Perhaps the earliest mention of the term bhatti in all Indic literature appears in the early Buddhist &quot;Theragatha&quot; (&quot;Verses of the Elders&quot;). As such, Har Dayal writes that, bhakti &quot;was an integral part of the Buddhist ideal from the earliest times&quot;. John S. Strong writes that the central meaning of Indian Buddhist bhakti was &quot;recollection of the Buddha&quot; (Sanskrit: buddhanusmrti).

One of the earliest form of Buddhist devotional practice was the early Buddhist tradition of worshiping the Buddha through the means of stupas and bodily relics (sarira). Later (after about the third century CE), devotion using Buddha images also became a very popular form of Buddha bhakti.

Sri Lankan scholar Indumathie Karunaratna notes that the meaning of &quot;bhatti&quot; changed throughout Buddhist history. In early Buddhist sources like the &quot;Theragāthā&quot;, &quot;bhatti&quot; had the meaning of &#x27;faithful adherence to the [Buddhist] religion&#x27;, and was accompanied with knowledge. Later on, however, the term developed the meaning of an advanced form of emotional devotion. This sense of devotion was thus different than the early Buddhist view of faith.

According to Sanath Nanayakkara, early Buddhist refuge and devotion, meant taking the Buddha as an ideal to live by, rather than the later sense of self-surrender. But already in the Commentary to the Abhidhamma text &quot;Puggalapaññatti&quot;, it is mentioned that the Buddhist devotee should develop his &quot;saddhā&quot; until it becomes &quot;bhaddi&quot;, a sense not mentioned in earlier texts and probably influenced by the Hindu idea of &quot;bhakti&quot;. There are instances where commentator Buddhaghosa mentions taking refuge in the Buddha in the sense of mere adoration, indicating a historical shift in meaning. Similar developments in Buddhist devotion took place with regards to worshipping the Buddha&#x27;s relics and Buddha images.

The Mahāsāṃghika school of early Buddhism seems to have promoted devotional practice and bhakti to a high status and to have anchored this practice in the purity and radiance of the Buddha. The &quot;Mahāvastu&quot;, one of the few surviving Mahāsāṃghika texts, states:The purity of the Buddha is so great that the worship of the Exalted One is sufficient for the attainment of Nirvāna, and that one already acquires endless merit by merely walking round a stupa and worshipping it by means of floral offerings...from the Buddha’s smile, there radiate beams which illuminate the entire buddhafields. 

In later faith-oriented literature, such as the &quot;Avadānas,&quot; faith is given an important role in Buddhist doctrine. Nevertheless, faith (&quot;śraddhā&quot;) is discussed in different contexts than devotion (&quot;bhakti&quot;). &quot;Bhakti&quot; is often used disparagingly to describe acts of worship to deities, often seen as ineffective and improper for a Buddhist. Also, &quot;bhakti&quot; is clearly connected with a person as an object, whereas &quot;śraddhā&quot; is less connected with a person, and is more connected with truthfulness and truth. Śraddhā focuses on ideas such as the working of karma and merit transfer. One source for Indian Buddhist devotion is the &quot;Divyāvadāna&quot;, which focuses on the vast amount of merit (&quot;&quot;) that is generated by making offerings to Buddhas, stupas and other Buddhist holy sites.

This text contrasts faith in the Buddha with bhakti for mundane deities (such as Hindu gods), and in this case, it sees bhakti as something for those who are less developed spiritually. However, in other passages, the term is used positively, and in one story, the sage Upagupta says to the demon Mara:Even a very small bit of bhakti [toward the Buddha] offers nirvana to the wise as a result. In short, the wicked things that you [Māra] did here to the Sage, when your mind was blind with delusion, all of these have been washed away by the copious waters of śraddhā that have entered your heart.

- &quot;Divyāvadāna&quot; 360.1–4 [&quot;Aśokāvadana&quot; 22.7-9] In the 11th century, the Bengali Buddhist scholar Rāmancandra Kavibhārati composed a work on Buddhist bhakti called the &quot;Bhakti Śataka.&quot;

Today, affective devotion remains an important part of Buddhist practice, even in Theravada Buddhism. According to Winston King, a scholar on Theravāda in Myanmar, &quot;warm, personalized, emotional&quot; &quot;bhakti&quot; has been a part of the Burmese Buddhist tradition apart from the monastic and lay intellectuals. The Buddha is treasured by the everyday devout Buddhists, just like Catholics treasure Jesus. The orthodox teachers tend to restrain the devotion to the Buddha, but to the devout Buddhist populace, &quot;a very deeply devotional quality&quot; was and remains a part of the actual practice. This is observable, states King, in &quot;multitudes of Pagoda worshippers of the Buddha images&quot; and the offerings they make before the image and nowhere else.

==== In Mahayana Buddhism ====



A rich devotionalism developed in Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism and it can be found in the veneration of the transcendent Buddha Amitabha of Pure Land Buddhism and of bodhisattvas like Mañjusri, Avalokiteshvara (known as Guanyin in East Asia and Chenrezig in Tibetan) and the goddess Tara. Mahayana sources like the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; describe the Buddha as the loving father of all beings, and exhorts all Buddhists to worship him.

Mahayana bhakti also led to the rise of temples which were focused on housing a central Buddha image, something which became the norm during the Gupta period. Gupta era Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism stressed bhakti towards the Buddha as a central virtue and liberally made use of Buddha images, which are often accompanied by attendant bodhisattvas.

These new developments in Buddhist bhakti may have been influenced by the pan-Indian bhakti movement, and indeed, many Gupta monarchs, who were devoted to the Vaishnava Bhagavata religion also supported Buddhist temples and founded monasteries (including great ones like Nalanda). Buddhists were in competition with the Hindu religions of the time, like the Bhagavatas and Shaivas, and they developed Buddhist bhakti focused on the Buddhas and bodhisattvas in this religious environment.

Mahāyāna interprets Buddhahood as a transcendent and eternal state (as found in the &quot;Lotus Suta&quot;) and is also equated with the ultimate reality (Dharmakaya). Bodhisattvas were also considered to be extremely powerful divinities that could grant boons and rescue people from danger. This shift towards devotion to a transcendent being in later Buddhism has been seen as being similar to theistic forms of Hindu bhakti. Mahayana Buddhist bhakti was also sometimes aimed at a Mahayana sutra, such as the &quot;Prajñaparamita sutra&quot; and the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;.

Some sources, like the &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūhasūtra&quot;, even state that through devotion to the Buddha Amitabha one can attain rebirth in his Pure Land and here one can be purified of all negative karma and eventually attain Buddhahood. As such, they make Buddha bhakti a central element of their soteriology. Bhakti in these sutras supersedes the making of good karma and cultivation of the path in favor of devotion to the Buddha Amitabha who can lead one to liberation in the Pure Land. This eventually came to be seen as its own path to liberation, its own &quot;mārga&quot;, often called the &quot;easy path&quot;. A text attributed to Nagarjuna, the *&quot;Dasabhumikavibhāsā&quot; (Chinese: &quot;Shí zhù pípóshā lùn&quot; 十住毘婆沙論, T.1521) teaches the &quot;easy practice&quot; which is simply being constantly mindful of the Buddhas.

All of these ideas became the foundation for the later development of East Asian Pure Land Buddhism.

Mahayana Buddhist bhakti is grounded in the Mahayana ideals of the bodhisattva, bodhicitta (the mind aimed at awakening for the benefit of all beings) and skillful means (upaya). Mahayana bhakti practices include various forms of ritual pujas and prayers. The Mahayana form of the practice of Buddhānusmṛti (remembering the Buddha) could include visualization practices and recitation of the names of a Buddha or bodhisattva (as in &quot;nianfo&quot;) was also a common method of devotional practice taught in numerous Indian sources.

One common puja and prayer format in Indian Mahayana was the &quot;seven part worship&quot; (&quot;saptāṇgapūjā&quot; or &quot;saptavidhā anuttarapūjā&quot;). This often included various offerings of flowers, food, scents, and music. This ritual form is visible in the works of Shantideva (8th century) and includes:

* &quot;Vandana&quot; (obeisance, bowing)
* &quot;Puja&quot; (ritual worship with offerings etc.)
* &quot;Sarana-gamana&quot; (going for refuge)
* &quot;Papadesana&quot; (confession of bad deeds)
* &quot;Punyanumodana&quot; (rejoicing in merit of the good deeds of oneself and others)
* &quot;Adhyesana&quot; (prayer, entreaty) and &quot;yacana&quot; (supplication) – request to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to continue preaching Dharma
* &quot;Atmabhavadi-parityagah&quot; (surrender) and &quot;pariṇāmanā&quot; (the transfer of one&#x27;s Merit to the welfare of others)

Devotion to the Buddhas and bodhisattvas continued to be a major part of the later Vajrayana Buddhist traditions of tantra. Vajrayana Buddhism also added another form of bhakti to their teachings: guru bhakti (i.e. guru yoga), devotion towards the tantric guru. In India, various forms of devotion were practiced, including tantric songs of realization called &quot;Charyagitis.&quot; These first arose in the so called called &quot;Charyapadas&quot; of medieval Bengali Sahajiya Buddhism&quot;.&quot;

As such, both in Tibetan Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism, there remains a strong tradition of devotional veneration of various Buddhas and bodhisattvas (which includes making offerings and chanting their names or mantras), and this is one of the most popular forms of lay Buddhist practice.

=== Jainism ===
Bhakti has been a prevalent ancient practice in various Jaina sects, wherein learned Tirthankara (&quot;Jina&quot;) and human &quot;gurus&quot; have been venerated with offerings, songs and Āratī prayers.

Jainism participated in the Bhakti school of medieval India, and has a rich tradition of bhakti literature (&quot;stavan&quot;) though these have been less studied than those of the Hindu tradition. The &quot;Avasyaka sutra&quot; of Jains includes, among ethical duties for the devotee, the recitation of &quot;hymns of praise to the Tirthankaras&quot; as the second Obligatory Action. It explains this &quot;bhakti&quot; as one of the means to destroy negative karma. According to Paul Dundas, such textual references to devotional activity suggests that &quot;bhakti&quot; was a necessary part of Jainism from an early period.

According to Jeffery D. Long, along with its strong focus on ethics and ascetic practices, the religiosity in Jainism has had a strong tradition of &quot;bhakti&quot; or devotion just like their Hindu counterparts. The Jain community built ornate temples and prided in public devotion for its fordmakers, saints and teachers. &quot;Abhisekha&quot;, festival prayers, community recitals and &quot;Murti puja&quot; (rituals before an image) are examples of integrated bhakti in Jain practice. Some Jain monks, however, reject Bhakti.

<doc id="175568" wikidata="Q2914617" url="?curid=175568" title="Bhakti movement">
<text>The Bhakti movement was a significant religious movement in medieval Hinduism that sought to bring religious reforms to all strata of society by adopting the method of devotion to achieve salvation. Originating in Tamilakam during 6th century CE, it gained prominence through the poems and teachings of the Vaishnava Alvars and Shaiva Nayanars in early medieval South India, before spreading northwards. It swept over east and north India from the 15th century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE.

The Bhakti movement regionally developed around different Hindu gods and goddesses, and some sub-sects were Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva), Shaktism (Shakti goddesses), and Smartism. The Bhakti movement preached using the local languages so that the message reached the masses. The movement was inspired by many poet-saints, who championed a wide range of philosophical positions ranging from theistic dualism of Dvaita to absolute monism of Advaita Vedanta.

The movement has traditionally been considered an influential social reformation in Hinduism, as it provided an individual-focused alternative path to spirituality, regardless of one&#x27;s birth or gender. Contemporary scholars question whether the Bhakti movement was ever a reform or rebellion of any kind. They suggest that the Bhakti movement was a revival, reworking, and recontextualisation of ancient Vedic traditions.

== Terminology ==
The Sanskrit word &quot;bhakti&quot; is derived from the root , which means &quot;divide, share, partake, participate, to belong to&quot;. The word also means &quot;attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation&quot;.

Bhakti, in contrast, is spiritual, a love and devotion to religious concepts or principles, that engages both emotion and intellection. The connotation of love in this context is not one of uncritical emotion but committed engagement. The Bhakti movement in Hinduism refers to ideas and engagement that emerged in the medieval era on love and devotion to religious concepts built around one or more gods and goddesses. The Bhakti movement preached against the caste system and used local languages and so the message reached the masses. One who practices &quot;bhakti&quot; is called a &quot;bhakta&quot;.

== Textual roots ==
Ancient Indian texts, dated to the 1st millennium BCE, such as the &quot;Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad&quot;, the &quot;Kaṭha Upaniṣad&quot;, and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; mention Bhakti.

=== &quot;Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad&quot; ===

The last of three epilogue verses of the &quot;Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad&quot;, 6.23, uses the word Bhakti as follows,

This verse is notable for the use of the word &quot;Bhakti&quot;, and has been widely cited as among the earliest mentions of &quot;the love of God&quot;. Scholars have debated whether this phrase is authentic or later insertion into the Upanishad, and whether the terms &quot;Bhakti&quot; and &quot;God&quot; meant the same in this ancient text as they do in the medieval and modern era Bhakti traditions found in India. Max Muller states that the word &quot;Bhakti&quot; appears in only one verse of the epilogue at its end, may have been a later insertion and may not be theistic as the word was later used in much &quot;Sandilya Sutras&quot;. 

Grierson, as well as Carus, note that the first epilogue verse 6.21 is also notable for its use of the word &quot;Deva Prasada&quot; (देवप्रसाद, grace or gift of God), but add that &quot;Deva&quot; in the epilogue of the &quot;Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad&quot; refers to &quot;pantheistic Brahman&quot; and the closing credit to sage Śvetāśvatara in verse 6.21 can mean &quot;gift or grace of his Soul&quot;.

Doris Srinivasan states that the Upanishad is a treatise on theism, but it creatively embeds a variety of divine images, an inclusive language that allows &quot;three Vedic definitions for a personal deity&quot;. The Upanishad includes verses wherein God can be identified with the Supreme (Brahman-Atman, Self, Soul) in Vedanta monistic theosophy, verses that support the dualistic view of Samkhya doctrines, as well as the synthetic novelty of triple Brahman where a triune exists as the divine soul (Isvara, theistic God), individual soul (self) and nature (Prakrti, matter). 

Tsuchida writes that the Upanishad syncretically combines monistic ideas of the Upanishads and the self-development ideas of Yoga with personification of the deity Rudra. Hiriyanna interprets the text to be introducing &quot;personal theism&quot; in the form of Shiva Bhakti, with a shift to monotheism but in the henotheistic context where the individual is encouraged to discover his own definition and sense of God.

=== &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; ===

The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, a post-Vedic scripture composed in 5th to 2nd century BCE, introduces &quot;bhakti marga&quot; (the path of faith/devotion) as one of three ways to spiritual freedom and release, the other two being &quot;karma marga&quot; (the path of works) and &quot;jnana marga&quot; (the path of knowledge). 

In verses 6.31 through 6.47 of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, Krishna describes bhakti yoga and loving devotion as one of the several paths to the highest spiritual attainments.

=== &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; ===
The &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; embodies Bhakti through three stories about the goddess Devi. In these narratives, bhakti is vividly portrayed as the gods turn to Devi in times of crisis, emphasizing bhakti&#x27;s central role in seeking divine aid and protection. The text prescribes rituals like recitation and worship to honour Devi, emphasizing that her &quot;Mahatmya&quot; should be recited &quot;with Bhakti&quot; on specific days of each lunar fortnight and especially during the annual &quot;great offering&quot; (maha-puja) held in autumn, known today as Durga puja (&quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; 12.4, 12.12).

== History ==
===Initial development in Tamil lands===

The Bhakti movement originated in Tamilakam during the seventh to eighth century CE, and remained influential in South India for some time. In the second millennium, a second wave of bhakti spread northwards through Karnataka (c. 12th century) and gained wide acceptance in fifteenth-century Assam, Bengal and northern India. 

According to Brockington, the initial Tamil bhakti movement was characterized by &quot;a personal relationship between the deity and the devotee&quot;, and &quot;fervent emotional experience in response to divine grace&quot;. The Bhakti movement in Tamil Nadu was composed of two main parallel groups: Shaivas (who also worshipped local deities like Shiva or his son Murugan/Kartikeya) and Vaishnavas (who also worshipped local deities like Tirumāl). The Vaishnava Alvars and Shaiva Nayanars and, who lived between 5th and 9th century CE. They promoted love of a personal God first and foremost which is also expressed by love of one&#x27;s fellow human beings. They also wrote and sang hymns of praise to their God, and came from numerous social classes, even shudras. These poet saints became the backbone of the Sri Vaishnava and Shaiva Siddhanta traditions.

The Alvars, which literally means &quot;those immersed in God&quot;, were Vaishnava poet-saints who sang praises of Vishnu as they traveled from one place to another. They established temple sites such as Srirangam, and spread ideas about Vaishnavism. Various poems were compiled as Alvar Arulicheyalgal or Divya Prabandham, developed into an influential scripture for the Vaishnavas. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;&#x27;s references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on &quot;bhakti&quot;, have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins though some scholars question whether that evidence excludes the possibility that Bhakti movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.

Like the Alvars, the Shaiva Nayanars were Bhakti poet saints. The &quot;Tirumurai&quot;, a compilation of hymns on Shiva by sixty-three Nayanar poet-saints, developed into an influential scripture in Shaivism. The poets&#x27; itinerant lifestyle helped create temple and pilgrimage sites and spread spiritual ideas built around Shiva. Early Tamil-Shiva Bhakti poets influenced Hindu texts that came to be revered all over India.

=== Spread throughout India in the 2nd millennium ===

The influence of the Tamil bhakti saints and those of later northern Bhakti leaders ultimately helped spread &quot;bhakti&quot; poetry and ideas throughout all the Indian subcontinent by the 18th century CE. However, outside of the Tamil speaking regions, the bhakti movement arrived much later, mostly in the second millennium. 

For example, in Kannada-speaking regions (roughly modern Karnataka), the Bhakti movement arrived in the 12th century, with the emergence of Basava and his Shaivite Lingayatism, which were known for their total rejection of caste distinctions and the authority of the Vedas, their promotion of the religious equality of women, and their focus on worshipping a small lingam, which they always carried around their necks, as opposed to images in temples run by elite priesthoods. Another important Kannada figure in the bhakti movement was Madhvacharya (c. 12-13th centuries), a great and prolific scholar of Vedanta, who promoted the theology of dualism (Dvaita Vedanta).

Similarly, the Bhakti movement in Odisha (known as Jñanamisrita bhakti or Dadhya Bhakti) also began in the 12th century. It included various scholars including Jayadeva (the 12th-century author of the &quot;Gita Govinda&quot;), and it had become a mass movement by the 14th century. Figures like Balarama Dasa, Achyutananda, Jasobanta Dasa, Ananta Dasa and Jagannatha Dasa preached Bhakti through public sankirtans across Odisha. Jagannath was and remains the center of the Odisha Bhakti movement.

The Bhakti movements also spread to the north later, particularly during the flowering of northern Bhakti yoga of the 15th and the 16th centuries. Perhaps the earliest of the northern bhakti figures was Nimbārkāchārya (c. 12th century), a Brahmin from Andhra Pradesh who moved to Vrindavan. He defended a similar theology to Ramanuja, which he called Bhedābheda (difference and non-difference). Other important northern bhaktas include Nāmdev (c. 1270-1350), Rāmānanda, and Eknath (c. 1533-99). 

Another important development was the rise of the Sant Mat movement, which drew from Islam, Nath tradition and Vaishnavism from which the famous 15th-century Kabir arose. Kabir was a saint known for Hindi poetry that expressed a rejection of external religion in favor of inner experience. After his death, his followers founded the Kabir panth. A similar movement sharing the same Sant Mat Bhakti background that drew on both Hinduism and Islam, was founded by the Guru Nānak (1469-1539), the first Guru of Sikhism.

In Bengal, the most famous composer of Vaishnava devotional songs was Candīdās (1339–1399). He was celebrated in the popular Bengali Vaishnava-Sahajiya movement. One the most influential of the northern Hindu Bhakti traditions was the Krishnaite Gaudiya Vaishnavism of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1534) in Bengal. Chaitanya eventually came to be seen by the Bengali Vaishnavas as an avatara of Krishna himself. Another important leader of northern Vaishnava Bhakti was Vallabhacharya Mahaprabhu (1479–1531 CE) who founded the Pushtimarg tradition in Braj (Vraja).

Some scholars state that the Bhakti movement&#x27;s rapid spread in India in the 2nd millennium was in part a response to the arrival of Islam and subsequent Islamic rule in India and Hindu-Muslim conflicts. That view is contested by some scholars, with Rekha Pande stating that singing ecstatic Bhakti hymns in local language had been a tradition in South India before Muhammad was born. According to Pande, the psychological impact of Muslim conquests may have initially contributed to community-style Bhakti by Hindus. However, other scholars state that Muslim invasions, the conquests of Hindu Bhakti temples in South India and the seizure and the melting of musical instruments such as cymbals from local people were part responsible for the later relocation or demise of singing Bhakti traditions in the 18th century.

According to Wendy Doniger, the nature of the Bhakti movement may have been affected by the daily practices to &quot;surrender to God&quot; of Islam when it arrived in India. In turn, that influenced devotional practices in Islam such as Sufism, and other religions in India from the 15th century onwards, such as Sikhism, Christianity, and Jainism.

Klaus Witz, in contrast, traces the history and nature of the Bhakti movement to the Upanishadic and the Vedanta foundations of Hinduism. He writes that in virtually every Bhakti movement poet, &quot;the Upanishadic teachings form an all-pervasive substratum, if not a basis. We have here a state of affairs that has no parallel in the West. Supreme Wisdom, which can be taken as basically non-theistic and as an independent wisdom tradition (not dependent on the Vedas), appears fused with the highest level of bhakti and with the highest level of God-realization&quot;é

=== Key figures ===
The Bhakti movement witnessed a surge in Hindu literature in regional languages, particularly in the form of devotional poems and music. This literature includes the writings of the Alvars and Nayanars, poems of Andal, Basava, Bhagat Pipa, Allama Prabhu, Akka Mahadevi, Kabir, Guru Nanak (founder of Sikhism), Tulsidas, Nabha Dass, Gusainji, Ghananand, Ramananda (founder of Ramanandi Sampradaya), Ravidass, Sripadaraja, Vyasatirtha, Purandara Dasa, Kanakadasa, Vijaya Dasa, Six Goswamis of Vrindavan, Raskhan, Ravidas, Jayadeva Goswami, Namdev, Eknath, Tukaram, Mirabai, Ramprasad Sen, Sankardev, Vallabha Acharya, Narsinh Mehta, Gangasati and the teachings of saints like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

The writings of Sankaradeva in Assam, however, included an emphasis on the regional language and also led to the development of an artificial literary language called &quot;Brajavali&quot;. &quot;Brajavali&quot; is, to an extent, a combination of medieval Maithili and Assamese. The language was easily understood by the local populace, in line with the Bhakti movement&#x27;s call for inclusion, but also retained its literary style. A similar language, called &quot;Brajabuli&quot; was popularised by Vidyapati, which was adopted by several writers in Odisha in the medieval times, and in Bengal during its renaissance.

The earliest writers from the 7th to 10th centuries who are known to have influenced the poet-saints driven movements include Sambandar, Tirunavukkarasar, Sundarar, Nammalvar, Adi Shankara, Manikkavacakar and Nathamuni. Several 11th- and 12th-century writers developed different philosophies within the Vedanta school of Hinduism that were influential to the Bhakti tradition in medieval India, and they include Ramanuja, Madhva, Vallabha and Nimbarka. These writers championed a spectrum of philosophical positions ranging from theistic dualism, qualified nondualism and absolute monism.

The Bhakti movement also witnessed several works getting translated into various Indian languages. &quot;Saundarya Lahari&quot; was written in Sanskrit by Adi Shankara and was translated into Tamil in the 12th century by Virai Kaviraja Pandithar, who titled the book &quot;Abhirami Paadal&quot;. Similarly, the first translation of the Ramayana into an &quot;Indo-Aryan language&#x27; was by Madhava Kandali, who translated it into Assamese as the &quot;Saptakanda Ramayana&quot;.

Shandilya and Narada are credited with two Bhakti texts, &quot;Shandilya Bhakti Sutra&quot; and &quot;Narada Bhakti Sutra&quot;, but both have been dated to the 12th century by modern scholars.

== Theology ==
The Bhakti movement of Hinduism saw two ways of imaging the nature of the divine (Brahman): &quot;Nirguna&quot; and &quot;Saguna&quot;. &quot;Nirguna&quot; Brahman was the concept of the ultimate reality as formless and without attributes or quality. &quot;Saguna&quot; Brahman, in contrast, was envisioned and developed as with form, attributes and quality. 

Both views had parallels in the ancient pantheistic formless and theistic traditions, respectively, and are traceable to a dialogue in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. These two may be considered to be the same Brahman, as viewed from two perspectives: a formless mode focused on wisdom (&quot;jñana&quot;) and a form mode, focused on love. &quot;Nirguna&quot; Bhakti poetry is more focused on &quot;jñana&quot;, and &quot;Saguna&quot; bhakti poetry focuses on love (&quot;prema&quot;). In Bhakti, the emphasis is reciprocal love and devotion in which the devotee loves God, and God loves the devotee.

Jeaneane Fowler states that the concepts of &quot;Nirguna&quot; and &quot;Saguna Brahman&quot;, which is at the root of Bhakti theology, underwent more profound developments with the ideas of the Vedanta schools, particularly those of Adi Shankara&#x27;s 8th-century &quot;Advaita Vedanta&quot; (absolute nondualism / monism), Ramanuja&#x27;s 12th-century Vishishtadvaita Vedanta (a qualified nondualism that posits unity and diversity), and Madhvacharya&#x27;s (c. 12th-13th century) Dvaita Vedanta (which posits a true dualism between God and the Ātman). 

According to David Lorenzen, the idea of bhakti for a &quot;Nirguna&quot; Brahman has been a baffling one to scholars since it offers &quot;heart-felt devotion to a God without attributes, without even any definable personality&quot;. However, given the &quot;mountains of &quot;Nirguni&quot; bhakti literature&quot;, Bhakti for &quot;Nirguna Brahman&quot; has been a part of the reality of the Hindu tradition along with the Bhakti for &quot;Saguna Brahman&quot;. Thus, these were two alternate ways of imagining God even in the bhakti movement.

The Nirguna and Saguna forms of Bhakti may be found in two 12th-century treatises on bhakti: the &quot;Sandilya Bhakti Sutra&quot; and &quot;Narada Bhakti Sutra&quot;. &quot;Sandilya&quot; leans towards Nirguna Bhakti, and &quot;Narada&quot; leans towards Saguna Bhakti.

=== Salvation ===
According to J. L. Brockington, the Sri Vaishnavas had split into two subsects in the 14th century:the dispute was over the question of human effort versus divine grace in achieving salvation, a controversy often and not unreasonably compared to the Arminian and Calvinist standpoints within Protestantism. The Northern school held that the worshipper had to make some effort to win the grace of the Lord and emphasised the performance of karma, a position commonly summed up as being ‘on the analogy of the monkey and its young’, for as the monkey carries her young which cling to her body so Visnu saves the worship per who himself makes an effort. The Southern school held that the Lord’s grace itself conferred salvation, a position ‘on the analogy of the cat and its kittens’, for just as the cat picks up her kittens in her mouth and carries them off willy-nilly, so Visnu saves whom he wills, without effort on their part. 

== Social impact ==
The Bhakti movement led to devotional transformation of medieval Hindu society, and Vedic rituals or alternatively ascetic monklike lifestyle for moksha gave way to individualistic loving relationship with a personally-defined god. Salvation, which had been considered attainable only by men of the Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya castes, became available to everyone. Most scholars state that Bhakti movement provided women and members of the Shudra and untouchable communities an inclusive path to spiritual salvation. Some scholars disagree that the Bhakti movement was premised on such social inequalities.

Poet-saints grew in popularity, and literature on devotional songs in regional languages became profuse. These poet-saints championed a wide range of philosophical positions within their society, ranging from the theistic dualism of Dvaita to the absolute monism of Advaita Vedanta. Kabir, a poet-saint, for example, wrote in Upanishadic style, the state of knowing truth:

The early-15th-century Bhakti poet-Sant Pipa stated:

The Bhakti movement also led to the prominence of the concept of female devotion, poet-saints such as Andal coming to occupy the popular imagination of the common people along with her male counterparts. Andal went a step further by composing hymns in praise of God in vernacular Tamil, rather than Sanskrit, in verses known as the Nachiyar Tirumoli, or the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Sacred Verses&quot;:


The impact of the Bhakti movement in India was similar to that of the Protestant Reformation of Christianity in Europe. It evoked shared religiosity, direct emotional and intellection of the divine and the pursuit of spiritual ideas without the overhead of institutional superstructures. Practices emerged bringing new forms of spiritual leadership and social cohesion among the medieval Hindus such as community singing, the chanting together of deity names; festivals; pilgrimages; and rituals relating to Saivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism. Many of these regional practices have survived into the modern era.

=== &quot;Seva&quot;, &quot;dāna&quot;, and community kitchens ===

The Bhakti movement introduced new forms of voluntary social giving such as &quot;Seva&quot; (service, for example to a temple or &quot;guru&quot; school or community construction), &quot;dāna&quot; (charity), and community kitchens with free shared food. Of community kitchen concepts, the vegetarian Guru ka Langar, which was introduced by Nanak, became a well-established institution over time, started with northwest India, and expanded to everywhere Sikh communities are found. Other saints such as Dadu Dayal championed the similar social movement, a community that believed in the concepts of ahimsa (non-violence) towards all living beings, social equality, a vegetarian kitchen and mutual social service. Bhakti temples and matha (Hindu monasteries) of India adopted social functions such as relief to victims after a natural disaster, helping the poor and marginal farmers, providing community labor, feeding houses for the poor, free hostels for poor children and promoting folk culture.

== In other Indian religions ==
=== Jainism ===
Bhakti has been a prevalent practice in various Jaina sects in which learned Tirthankara (&quot;Jina&quot;) and human &quot;gurus&quot; are considered superior beings and venerated with offerings, songs and &quot;Arti&quot; prayers. John Cort suggests that the &quot;bhakti&quot; movement in later Hinduism and Jainism may share roots in &quot;vandal&quot; and &quot;puja&quot; concepts of the Jaina tradition.

=== Buddhism ===
Medieval-era Bhakti traditions among non-theistic Indian traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism have been reported by scholars in which the devotion and prayer ceremonies were dedicated to an enlightened guru, primarily Buddha and Jina Mahavira, respectively, as well as others. Karel Werner notes that &quot;Bhatti&quot; (Bhakti in Pali) has been a significant practice in Theravada Buddhism, and states that &quot;there can be no doubt that deep devotion or &quot;bhakti / Bhatti&quot; does exist in Buddhism and that it had its beginnings in the earliest days&quot;.

=== Sikhism ===
Some scholars call Sikhism a Bhakti sect of Indian traditions. In Sikhism, &quot;nirguni Bhakti&quot; is emphasised: devotion to a divine without Gunas (qualities or form), but it accepts both nirguni and saguni forms of the divine.

The &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;, the scripture of the Sikhs, contains the hymns of the Sikh gurus, 13 Sikh gurus or Hindu bhagats and two Muslim bhagats. Some of the bhagats whose hymns were included in the Guru Granth Sahib, were Bhakti poets who taught their ideas before the birth of Guru Nanak, the first Sikh guru. The thirteen Hindu bhagats or Sikh gurus whose hymns were entered into the text were poet saints of the Bhakti movement, and included Namdev, Pipa, Ravidas, Beni, Bhikhan, Dhanna, Jayadeva, Parmanand, Sadhana, Sain, Surdas and Trilochan, and the two Muslim bhagats were Kabir and Sufi saint Baba Farid. 

Most of the 5,894 hymns in the Sikh scripture came from the Sikh gurus, the rest from the Bhagats. The three highest contributions in the Sikh scripture of non-Sikh bhagats were from Bhagat Kabir (292 hymns), Bhagat Farid (134 hymns) and Bhagat Namdev (60 hymns).

Sikhism was influenced by Bhakti movement, and incorporated hymns from the Bhakti poet-saints, it was not simply an extension of the Bhakti movement. but it disagreed, for instance, with some of the views of the Bhakti sants Kabir and Ravidas.

Guru Nanak, the first Sikh Guru and the founder of Sikhism, was a Bhakti saint. He taught, states Jon Mayled, that the most important form of worship is Bhakti. &quot;Nam-simran&quot; – the realisation of God – is an important Bhakti practice in Sikhism. Guru Arjan, in his &quot;Sukhmani Sahib&quot;, recommended the true religion is one of loving devotion to God. The Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib includes suggestions for a Sikh to perform constant Bhakti. The Bhakti themes in Sikhism also incorporate Shakti (power) ideas.

Some Sikh sects outside Punjab, such as those found in Maharashtra and Bihar, practice &quot;Arti&quot; with lamps in a gurdwara. Arti and devotional prayer ceremonies are also found in Ravidassia sect

== Debates in contemporary scholarship ==
Contemporary scholars question whether the 19th- and early 20th-century theories about the Bhakti movement in India, its origin, nature and history are accurate. Pechilis in her book on the Bhakti movement, for example, states:

Madeleine Biardeau states, like Jeanine Miller, that the Bhakti movement was neither reform nor a sudden innovation but the continuation and expression of ideas to be found in Vedas, Bhakti Marga teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, the Katha Upanishad and the Shvetashvatara Upanishad.

John Stratton Hawley describes recent scholarship that questions the old theory of the Bhakti movement&#x27;s origin and story of irt coming from the south and moveing north&quot;. He states that the movement had multiple origins by mentioning Brindavan in North India as another centre. Hawley describes the controversy and disagreements between Indian scholars and quotes Hegde&#x27;s concern of Bhakti movement being a reform a theory that has been supported by &quot;cherry-picking particular songs from a large corpus of Bhakti literature&quot;. He states that if the entirety of the literature by any single author like &quot;Basava&quot; is considered along with its historical context, there is neither reform nor a need for reform. 

Sheldon Pollock writes that the Bhakti movement was neither a rebellion against Brahmins and the upper castes nor a rebellion against Sanskrit since many of the prominent thinkers and earliest champions of the Bhakti movement were Brahmins or from other upper castes. Also, early and later Bhakti poetry and other literature werre in Sanskrit. Further, Pollock considers that evidence of Bhakti trends in ancient Southeast Asian Hinduism in the 1st millennium CE, such as those in Cambodia and Indonesia, where the Vedic period was unknown, and upper-caste Tamil Hindu nobles and merchants introduced Bhakti ideas of Hinduism, suggest that the roots and the nature of the Bhakti movement were primarily spiritual and political quests, rather than the rebellion of some form.

John Guy states that the evidence of Hindu temples and Chinese inscriptions from the 8th century CE about Tamil merchants presents Bhakti motifs in Chinese trading towns, particularly Quanzhou&#x27;s Kaiyuan Temple. They show that Saivite, Vaishnavite and Hindu Brahmin monasteries revered Bhakti themes in China.

Scholars increasingly drop, according to Karen Pechilis, the old premises and the language of &quot;radical otherness, monotheism and reform of orthodoxy&quot; for the Bhakti movement. Many scholars now characterise the emergence of Bhakti in medieval India as a revival, reworking and recontextualization of the central themes of Vedic traditions.

<doc id="175569" wikidata="Q4994490" url="?curid=175569" title="Footrot Flats">
<text>Footrot Flats, a comic strip by New Zealand cartoonist Murray Ball, ran from 1976 to 1994 in newspapers (unpublished strips continued to appear in book form until 2000). Altogether there are 27 numbered books (collecting the newspaper strips, with additional material), a further 8 books collecting the Sunday newspaper strips, and 5 smaller &quot;pocket&quot; books of original material, plus various related publications. The strips inspired a stage musical, an animated feature film called &quot;Footrot Flats: the Dog&#x27;s Tail Tale&quot;, and the Footrot Flats Fun Park in Auckland, New Zealand. The strip reached its peak of popularity in the mid-1980s, with the books selling millions of copies in Australasia. 

The comic&#x27;s protagonist is a border-collie sheepdog known as &quot;the Dog&quot;, owned by Wal Footrot, who runs a sheep and cattle farm called Footrot Flats near the fictional rural town of Raupo in New Zealand. The comic depicts the trials and tribulations of Wal, the Dog and other characters, human and animal, which they encounter. The Dog&#x27;s thoughts are voiced in thought bubbles, though he is clearly &quot;just a dog&quot;, unlike the heavily anthropomorphised creatures of some other comics or animation. The humour draws on the foibles of the characters, which many farmers found easy to recognise around them. There was much &quot;humour in adversity&quot;, making fun of the daily struggle that permeates farming life. The depictions of the animals are quite realistic and detailed, with a dose of comic anthropomorphism superimposed without spoiling the farming realism.

==History==
&quot;Footrot Flats&quot; was initially rejected for syndication by both &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; and &quot;The Auckland Star&quot;. It was first accepted in 1976 by Mike Robson, editor of Wellington&#x27;s &quot;The Evening Post&quot;. The strip appeared in hundreds of newspapers in Australasia and also gained an international following, especially in Denmark.

The strip&#x27;s leading human character, Wal Footrot, is based on Murray Ball&#x27;s cousin Arthur Waugh, who was a sheep shearer around the time of the strip&#x27;s inception and went on to own a 2,100-hectare farm situated east of Pahiatua in the southeastern North Island of New Zealand. 

Ball cited different reasons for quitting the strip, including the death of his own dog, and his displeasure with the direction of New Zealand politics.

Among the strip&#x27;s fans were Peanuts creator Charles Schulz and Garfield creator Jim Davis.

The Gisborne Museum &amp; Arts Centre created an exhibition for Footrot Flats, which was exhibited at the Auckland War Memorial Museum in September 1991.

A statue of Wal and the Dog created by Wētā Workshop was installed in Gisborne in 2016. It was initially placed in front of the Lawson Field Theatre before being installed in front of the H. B. Williams Memorial Library. The concept for the sculpture arose from discussions between Murray and Pam Ball and Gisborne Mayor Meng Foon in 2009.

In the Australian TV series, Bluey, the character MacKenzie is a reference to the comic series. This is evident from him being a Border Collie and having a distinct Kiwi accent.

==Main characters==

; &quot;The Dog&quot; : The main character of the series, a Border Collie, he considers himself tough and brave, but is quite soft and sometimes cowardly. His real name, chosen by Wal&#x27;s Aunt Dolly, has never been revealed. He despises this &quot;refined, aristocratic name&quot; and goes to great lengths to censor it. Wal always calls him &quot;Dog&quot;, gaining his loyal devotion. The Dog was born on October 13 at Aunt Dolly&#x27;s holiday home for cats and raised by a Persian cat named Ninky Poo—which caused him, when he was a pup, to act more like a cat than a dog—before being given to Wal, who raised him to act more like a normal dog. He is a competent sheepdog and is often put to work to guard things or get rid of rats or pigs, but has a considerable independent streak. He is fond of rabbits, afraid of hares and dislikes seeing trees being cut down. He has several alter egos: &quot;The Scarlet Manuka&quot; who attempts to &#x27;liberate&#x27; cricket balls, &quot;Mitey Iron Paw&quot;, and &quot;the Grey Ghost of The Forest&quot;. The Dog has claimed to have the following commendations: V.C. (Very Cute), D.S.O. (Doesn&#x27;t Steal Offal), and B.A.R (What Sheep Do), along with the alias of &#x27;00Dog&#x27; (Licensed to be kind but fair). He usually attempts to act as a &#x27;chaperone&#x27; on Wal&#x27;s dates with &quot;Cheeky&quot; Hobson, leading to disaster for Wal.

; Wallace Cadwallader &quot;Wal&quot; Footrot : Wallace Footrot was born on 26 January in Northern Manawatu. He was educated at Apiti Primary School and later Foxton Agricultural High, where he excelled at tractor reversing and rooster imitations. Wallace established an outstanding relationship with muscovy ducks, but unfortunately failed completely with geese. Indeed, he seemed to have an uncanny knack of irritating them. Wallace took a full part in all school activities. He displayed a promising right cross during his time in the front row of the 2nd XV, but was unable to transfer this ability to the boxing ring. He rather let the side down during the inter-school championships by throwing in the sponge, which knocked the referee&#x27;s glasses crooked. He was disqualified. On leaving school, he acquired of swamp between the Ureweras and the sea. He is unmarried, although he has an interest in Darlene &quot;Cheeky&quot; Hobson, who works as a hairdresser in Raupo. Wal plays rugby union for Raupo, where he is a hooker and dreams of representing New Zealand&#x27;s national team, the All Blacks. The Raupo XV often play against the Mill team, whose star player is Wal&#x27;s sleazy neighbour, &#x27;Spit&#x27; Murphy, who also competes for Cheeky&#x27;s affections.

; Socrates &quot;Cooch&quot; Windgrass : Wal&#x27;s neighbour and best friend. Cooch has compassion for all living creatures and nature, and thus has a natural affinity with animals. But he is no vegetarian. His family owns 1,000 acres of swamp, tussock, scrub, forest and mudflat. A cabbage tree grows through his verandah floor, while a pūriri tree has pushed his house crooked. Cooch owns the Dog&#x27;s girlfriend Jess and a pet magpie called Pew. Cooch never drives a tractor, preferring to plod along on his Clydesdales. He helps Wal with fencing, shearing and other farm jobs. He is unmarried but has a crush on his cousin Kathy. Murray Ball describes Cooch as &#x27;eccentric, NOT an idiot!&#x27;, having based the character on two people he knows.

; Dolores Monrovia Godwit &quot;Aunt Dolly&quot; Footrot: Wal&#x27;s aunt (by marriage). She was born in Cambridge, Waikato, and was the second daughter of Englishman Edward George Bogg and New Zealander Fiona Godwit Symington. She was educated at Lady Hinema Sacks-Grenville School for Young Ladies and was a prefect, captain of hockey, lacrosse, and boxing. She married beneath her station to Arch&#x27; &quot;Toey&quot; Footrot, a barber and unlicensed bookie, who was Wal&#x27;s father&#x27;s older brother. Unfortunately, Toey ran off to Australia with &quot;a dumb but decorative darts stall owner with masses of black hair&quot;. Aunt Dolly&#x27;s first cat was Archibald II. She owns a cat home (where Dog was born) on Prince Phillip Drive in Tauranga. She is conservative, reveres the British monarchy, always addresses people by their proper names, and she disapproves of Wal&#x27;s relationship with Cheeky Hobson. Beneath her strictness she has a kind heart and takes to mothering abandoned lambs in the winter. Dog despises her for giving him his name.

; Darlene &quot;Cheeky&quot; Hobson : Wal&#x27;s girlfriend. She is the proprietor of La Parisienne Hairdressing Salon in Raupo. Cheeky is despised by the Dog, who is always looking for ways to come between her and Wal. She has two younger sisters, Belinda (Book 10) and Avril (Books 14 and 24), also both disliked by the Dog. Near the end of the strip&#x27;s run, Cheeky and Wal become engaged, much to the dismay of the Dog and Aunt Dolly, but at the last minute Cheeky dumps Wal to move to Los Angeles with a male stripper. She is first mentioned in Wal&#x27;s mini biography at the start of Book 1 (September 1978) but does not appear until Book 2 (August 1979).

; Horse: A large, fierce and practically invulnerable tomcat, based on a cat that lived on Murray Ball&#x27;s farm. He is a menace to the Dog and the other characters, resisting attempts to be tamed. He has a girlfriend (Fred, first mentioned in Book 9, first appears in Book 11) who has tattooed ears, lives with a biker gang and loves leather. He occasionally fathers kittens. Horse &quot;spoke&quot; infrequently in the earlier comics, but subsequently communicated via actions and yowls. Horse has saved the Dog and Jess from the local rat population at the Murphy farm. Book 7 is dedicated to the real Horse and begins with an elegy, followed by a eulogy penned by Murray Ball to commemorate the irascible cat&#x27;s passing. First appearance: Book 2 (August 1979).

; Janice &quot;Pongo&quot; Footrot : Wal&#x27;s niece, daughter of Rex Footrot. She ages during the books. She starts off as a stereotypical little girl, dressing up the Dog, putting him in a pram and playing dolls; however, she slowly turns into a strong feminist. Despite being a &quot;town&quot; girl and attending boarding school, she is unafraid of wildlife and assists with mustering and other farm work. She insists her nickname Pongo derives from her ping pong skills, not because she ponged (stunk) as a baby. First appearance: Book 3 (July 1980).

; Prince Charles: A very spoiled Welsh Corgi owned by Aunt Dolly. Has a higher view on life from listening to Aunt Dolly and living indoors. Often there are &quot;class&quot; clashes between him and Dog. He sometimes lusts after Jess but is even more fond of fine canine cuisine. In Book 12, he is asked to &quot;service&quot; a female corgi named Penelope Penrose IV, but fails to rise to the occasion, leaving Major to do the job at night. The Dog usually has to explain to Prince Charles the rougher aspects of farm life, like livestock mating and maggots eating mutton without gravy. Prince Charles is territorial when on his own turf. First appearance: Book 4 (April 1981).

; Rangi Wiremu Waka Jones : A local boy who often appears on the farm to give Wal a hand, he also plays with Pongo when she visits during holidays. Despite his short stature, he is a skilled rugby player, often getting the better of Wal. Rangi&#x27;s father is an abattoir slaughterman and his mother teaches at Raupo School. In his first appearance, Rangi considers skinning the Dog to make a fur coat. As a testimony to Murray Ball&#x27;s skill as an artist, the character of Rangi grew up over the years, appearing slightly older in each book from being a little kid to a teenager. First appearance: Book 4 (April 1981).

The characters are invariably known by their nicknames, such as Cooch, Pongo, Rangi, and Aunt Dolly. However, Aunt Dolly never uses the nicknames and always addresses them by their proper names.

==Minor characters==

; Jess : Cooch&#x27;s dog. She is the Dog&#x27;s girlfriend and co-parent. Despite frequently being confined to the &quot;Bitch&#x27;s Box&quot; when &quot;on heat&quot;, she has had several litters of puppies with the Dog. &quot;The Dog&#x27;s Tail Tale&quot; contains the story of their meeting as puppies, although Jess&#x27;s letter at the start of Book 5 gives a different account of the first time they saw each other. First appearance: Book 1 (September 1978).
; Major: Wal&#x27;s first dog. A pig-hunting dog, he is stern and tough. He has some fondness for Dog, saving him from the Murphys&#x27; dogs. First appearance: Book 1.
; Cecil the Ram : An aged stud ram, who lacks zest for the task of servicing Wal&#x27;s ewes. He soon rediscovers his libido when Wal sharpens the butchery knife. As the books progress, Cecil&#x27;s appearance becomes increasingly decrepit. First appearance: Book 2 (August 1979).
; Rex &quot;Chicken&quot; Footrot : Wal&#x27;s younger brother and Pongo&#x27;s father, he lives in town and is a potter. He has a young son named Mad Mick, who rarely visits the farm. Rex is better than Wal at just about every sport, much to Wal&#x27;s annoyance. He owns Boobsie, the Dog&#x27;s mum, and also owned Flash, the Dog&#x27;s father, whose death was announced in Book 14. First appearance: Book 3 (July 1980).
; Pew : Cooch&#x27;s pet magpie. Orphaned when Wal cut down his parents&#x27; macrocarpa tree; socially confused and always seeking revenge on Wal. Wal gave Pew to Cooch as a birthday present - the first time Wal ever remembered it - to get rid of him, but Pew&#x27;s revenge continues. Cooch became a surrogate mother for Pew, coaching him in the way of birds as best he can. In Book 14, Pew falls in love with and abducts Cheeky Hobson&#x27;s pet budgerigar, Little Twinkle, which is then eaten by Horse. First appearance: Book 4 (April 1981).
; Puti Puti : Rangi&#x27;s cousin. A city slicker from Porirua, she often carries a boombox on her shoulder and invariably suffers culture shock when visiting the farm. In Book 25, she brings her pit bull terrier, Terror, to the farm. First appearance: Book 10 (September 1985).
; Kathy : An occasional visitor to Cooch&#x27;s farm. Her face remains a mystery, as she is almost always drawn facing away from the reader – except once in Book 27, when she is only partially obscured by Spit Murphy&#x27;s arm. Kathy is beautiful and a free spirit, sometimes going casually nude outdoors. She is loved by everyone, including the Dog, and especially Cooch; much to his heartbreak, as they are cousins. In the final book of the series, Kathy tells Cooch that she loves him and gives him a passionate kiss. First appearance: Book 8 (September 1983).
; Stewart &quot;Irish&quot; Murphy : Wal&#x27;s other neighbour; a brutish man who does not welcome visitors and shoots any dog that strays onto his property, Blackwater Station, or mercifully hangs them by their hind legs on a fence. Once he did this to Prince Charles and lived to regret it when Aunt Dolly found out. Always filthy (&quot;health warning: do not approach this man downwind&quot;), probably due to farming numerous pigs, which cause Wal plenty of grief. He has two loutish sons, Spit and Hunk. He is first mentioned in Cooch&#x27;s introduction to Book 3, his pigs first appear in the same book, but he and his sons do not appear until Book 9 (October 1984).
; Elvis &quot;Spit&quot; Murphy : The brighter of Irish Murphy&#x27;s two sons, Spit is described by the Dog as &quot;a sort of rural John Travolta with smaller lips and bigger jeans&quot;. He is Wal&#x27;s rival in rugby and romance. He is also interested in Cooch&#x27;s cousin Kathy.
; Ronald &quot;Hunk&quot; Murphy : Irish Murphy&#x27;s large, slow-witted and aggressive son. He is described by the Dog as &quot;fat, pink and smelly&quot;. His nephew Lex Murphy (first appearance: Book 11) sometimes fights with Rangi.
; &quot;Irish&quot; Murphy&#x27;s pigs : A fearsome gang of three to six enormous beasts. Often lurking in the nearby river, causing consternation to unsuspecting fishermen and dogs. Always ravenous, they once defeated and ate some large sharks that swam up the estuary.
; Tiger, Wolf and Creampuff, &quot;Irish&quot; Murphy&#x27;s pig-dogs : They often terrorize the Dog, who seeks help from Wal, Horse or Major. Now and then, the Dog tries to take on all three of them at once. Creampuff is a bull terrier.
; Hermit Ram &quot;The Buffalo&quot; : This long unshorn ram has left the mob and lives in the farm&#x27;s wild scrub. He sometimes shows interest in the ewes, and Dog is sent to pursue him, but without success. First appearance: Book 11.
; The Goat: One of the toughest animals on the farm, the Goat is usually tethered to a chain in Wal&#x27;s garden. Wal bought him to keep the grass down, but the Goat prefers eating fruit trees and footy socks, and chasing the Dog and Wal. At one point, Wal tries in vain to sell the Goat and then decides to kill it, but cannot, exclaiming &quot;Dammit, I know this goat!&quot;. First appearance: Book 1.
; The Goose : Another character introduced in the first &quot;Footrot Flats&quot; book, the goose occasionally stalks Wal and pecks his posterior whenever possible. In the film &quot;The Dog&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the goose attempts to peck Wal and finally gets his chance when Wal rescues Irish Murphy from a river.
; Cooch&#x27;s goats : A cunning pack of goats that uses gang tactics to annoy Wal. For example, if Wal plants trees behind a fence, Cooch&#x27;s goats will stand on each other to get over and eat them. The Dog hates mustering Cooch&#x27;s goats.
; Other hostile animals : In the early books, the Dog&#x27;s main tormentors were the turkey, goat and pigs (Boris and Dolores). In one strip in Book 4, the goose is chasing Wal and the turkey is chasing the Dog, but Wal kicks the turkey and the Dog jumps on the goose&#x27;s neck, then Wal and the Dog celebrate their partnership.

== Sport ==
Sport plays a major part in Footrot Flats. Wal plays all sorts of sports including cricket, golf, fishing, rugby union, tennis and snooker. The Dog often plays with Wal, sometimes helping him, sometimes embarrassing him and sometimes being exploited. Wal can never beat his younger brother Rex in any sport.

Wal plays for the Raupo rugby club as a hooker and is often seen playing and training in the strip. At one point Wal was replaced by a younger man as he was getting too old, but the younger player wasn&#x27;t as good. The final few strips ever drawn involve an unlikely chain of events which culminate in Wal somehow scoring a try against a touring international rugby side. Wal also coaches the Raupo School rugby team, with Rangi being one of its more prominent members and the Dog serving as mascot (a duty he takes seriously, often blaming himself if the team loses).

In the cricket season, Wal plays for an unnamed team as an all-rounder, although he is sometimes pictured as the wicket keeper. Cooch often plays cricket with Wal and so does the Dog, usually fielding in the slips or in the covers (wherein the Dog&#x27;s alias of &#x27;The Scarlet Manuka&#x27; sometimes comes into play, stealing cricket balls to &#x27;rescue&#x27; them from persecution).

Cooch also plays golf with Wal, who has a homemade course on his farm. Cooch is better than Wal at golf, even though the course is very hard (the first hole is a par 14). When they do play on a real course, Cooch usually wins. Wal claims the trees are on Cooch&#x27;s side. Wal and Cooch also play snooker on a small table in Cooch&#x27;s house, where a tree hampers play.

Wal also occasionally plays tennis with Cheeky Hobson and fights for her affections with Nigel Erskine, another member of the tennis club. The Dog is usually the ball boy.

Wal and Cooch frequently fish in various ways: whitebaiting, long line fishing, and most often floundering.

Other sports seen in Footrot Flats are boxing, polo, soccer, squash, badminton and shooting.

<text>Bloom County is an American comic strip by Berkeley Breathed which originally ran from December 8, 1980, until August 6, 1989. It examined events in politics and culture through the viewpoint of a fanciful small town in Middle America, where children often have adult personalities and vocabularies and where animals can talk.

On July 12, 2015, Breathed started drawing &quot;Bloom County&quot; again. The first revived strip was published via Facebook on July 13, 2015.

Breathed won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 1987, making him only the second (and so far last) comic strip artist to win a Pulitzer; the other was Garry Trudeau, whose work has influenced Breathed.

==Publication history and production==

&quot;Bloom County&quot; originated from a comic strip known as &quot;The Academia Waltz&quot;, which Breathed produced for &quot;The Daily Texan&quot;, the student newspaper of the University of Texas. The comic strip attracted the notice of the editors of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, who recruited him to do a nationally syndicated strip. On December 8, 1980, &quot;Bloom County&quot;, syndicated by The Washington Post Writers Group, made its debut and featured some of the characters from &quot;Academia Waltz,&quot; including former frat-boy Steve Dallas and the paraplegic Vietnam War veteran Cutter John.

Breathed set &quot;Bloom County&quot; in a small town. Breathed said he made the choice because he had followed a girlfriend to Iowa City, Iowa; Breathed commented, &quot;You draw—literally—from your life if you’re going to write anything with some juice to it. I did just that.&quot;

Breathed&#x27;s hand-printed signature on his strips was usually presented in mirror image, i.e. right to left.

Breathed&#x27;s award of the Pulitzer Prize in editorial cartooning in 1987 for &quot;Bloom County&quot; was controversial. Because the cartoon appeared on the comics page, and not on the editorial page, the win was disapproved of by many members of Association of American Editorial Cartoonists.

Breathed cited the controversy over the release of &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot; as the factor that led him to resume &quot;Bloom County&quot;.

==Characters==

===Core characters===

At the very beginning of the strip (December 1980), the central setting was the Bloom boarding house run by the grandparents of Milo Bloom. As the strip continued, various boarders (and/or pets) moved into the boarding house. In the order the characters debuted:

*Milo Bloom, introduced in December 1980, is a 10-year-old newspaper reporter and probably the most worldly-wise of the bunch. Milo was the original protagonist of &quot;Bloom County&quot;, and much of the strip&#x27;s action during its first year takes place at the boarding house owned by his family. Initially presented as an innocent-yet-precocious ten-year-old grappling bizarrely with the hallmarks of his impending puberty (to the extent of developing an intense infatuation with Betty Crocker), Milo&#x27;s &#x27;offscreen&#x27; appointment to a journalist position for the local Bloom Beacon newspaper in January 1982 gradually modified his role to that of a &#x27;straight man&#x27;, with a number of his more absurdist earlier traits re-allocated to then-ascendant protagonist Opus. In the very earliest strips, Milo&#x27;s grandfather (&quot;The Major&quot;) was a central character; after the first year, the Major&#x27;s role diminished and he eventually ceased to appear as a regular at the end of 1982, vanishing altogether after his final appearance in a July 1983 Sunday strip. 
*Steve Dallas, introduced in May 1981, was (like Cutter John) originally a featured character in &quot;The Academia Waltz&quot;. Steve is Bloom County&#x27;s sole defense attorney. A machoistic and irresponsible chain smoker and former &quot;frat boy&quot;, Dallas spends most of his free time either trying to seduce women or concocting get-rich-quick schemes, including forming and managing a heavy metal band, Billy and the Boingers (previously known as Deathtöngue). While initially introduced as a foil to Bobbi Harlow, the latter&#x27;s eventual hookup with Cutter John increasingly expanded the flexibility of Dallas&#x27;s role, rendering him the strip&#x27;s sole major adult human character by the mid-80s. 
*Michael Binkley was also introduced in May 1981. Binkley was a schoolmate of Milo&#x27;s who lived with his father, Tom Binkley, rather than in the boarding house. Binkley is wishy-washy and overly reflective (in the mold of Charlie Brown), when not contemplating the lives of famous figures in pop culture, often at his father&#x27;s bedside in the middle of the night. His &quot;anxiety closet&quot;, first appearing in January 1983, has been a staple of many story lines.
*Opus is a large-nosed penguin (occasionally mistaken for a puffin) with a herring addiction who lost track of his mother during the Falklands War (they were later reunited in a closing story line at the end of the strip&#x27;s first incarnation). He was originally introduced as the more realistically designed pet penguin of Michael Binkley (&quot;A boy and his penguin!&quot; &quot;A penguin and his boy!&quot;) in June 1981, although he was only seen in three strips that month. He was re-introduced as a full-time cast member in January 1982; by mid-1982, Opus had ceased to be Binkley&#x27;s pet and he eventually became a boarder at the Bloom house, with his design likewise evolving into its more stylized trademark form (thus identifying him less strongly as a penguin) by the end of 1983. Opus&#x27; hopeless naïveté and optimism made him a fan favorite, and he quickly became the center of the strip, as well as the subject of two &quot;sequel&quot; strips (&quot;Outland&quot; and &quot;Opus&quot;), three children&#x27;s books, and a television special entitled &quot;A Wish for Wings That Work&quot;.
*Cutter John, introduced in November 1981, is a wheelchair-using Vietnam War veteran, noted for indulging in &quot;Star Trek&quot; fantasies with the meadow animals (Hodge-Podge, Portnoy and Opus), as well as anti-war protests. He is not a womanizer like Steve Dallas, but he is more popular with the ladies. His visage is nearly identical to that of Breathed himself. The character had previously appeared in Breathed&#x27;s earlier comic strip, &quot;The Academia Waltz&quot;, where he had been known as &#x27;Saigon John&#x27;.
*Bill the Cat is a filthy, scraggly, flea-bitten, orange tabby cat, introduced in June 1982 as a parody of the comic character Garfield. The humor of the character was the antithesis of Garfield: whereas the famous fat-cat was a marketing bonanza, &quot;Bloom County&quot; humorously tried desperately to present Bill in the same manner, despite his disgusting and unappealing appearance. After serving over a year as a relatively minor character largely existing &#x27;outside&#x27; of the strip&#x27;s main continuity and cast of characters (beyond sporadic appearances and background references to his merchandise), Breathed temporarily retired the character via alluding to his &#x27;offscreen&#x27; death in September 1983 (allegedly from acne); following his resurrection in July of the following year, Bill rapidly increased in prominence to the point of assuming an ironically central role in numerous major story lines, thus solidifying him as one of the strip&#x27;s most widely-known figures (alongside Opus). Following his resurrection, Bill&#x27;s low intelligence and inability to articulate himself beyond his trademark responses, &quot;Ack&quot; and &quot;Pbthhh&quot; led to him becoming something of a blank slate around which various increasingly-absurd plots revolved. He has been a cult member (&quot;Bhagwan Bill&quot;), televangelist (&quot;Fundamentally Oral Bill&quot;), perennial Presidential candidate (for the National Radical Meadow Party), heavy metal rock star (&quot;Wild Bill Catt&quot;), nuclear power plant operator at Chernobyl, and, in the last months of the series, had his brain surgically replaced with Donald Trump&#x27;s, alongside allegedly conducting affairs with Jeane Kirkpatrick, Princess Diana and Socks the cat. He has been known to speak on occasion, most notably during the Communist witch-hunt trials of which he has been a subject, when he remarked on January 13, 1986, &quot;Say, you don&#x27;t suppose the &#x27;Jury Box&#x27; is anything like a litter box, do you?&quot;. Numerous strips indicated that his persistent near-catatonic state was the result of drug use or brain damage resulting from once being legally dead and then revived after too long a period. In the Christmas special &quot;A Wish for Wings That Work&quot;, implicitly set in a differing continuity from the strip, Opus alternately recounts having rescued Bill from a university science lab where they had replaced his brains with Tater Tots.
* is a rabbit (name unknown until April 1984) who is best friends with Portnoy and Cutter John. He is politically conservative and fanatical about various issues, despite the fact that he is extremely ignorant about those same issues. Both Hodge-Podge and Portnoy (below) started off in April 1982 as unnamed minor characters, and their roles gradually increased as the strip continued, coalescing into their final forms around 1984.
*Portnoy is a groundhog, although his species was a mystery until October 1983. Before the revelation that he was a groundhog, he was portrayed as a squirrel, gopher, porcupine and possum, with his finalized groundhog design first emerging in March 1983. Portnoy was the grouchiest and most bigoted character by far and (in a few strips) was a bully to Opus.
*Oliver Wendell Jones is a schoolmate of Milo and Binkley, introduced in September 1983. He is a young computer hacker and gifted scientist. He once tried to bring an end to the Cold War by introducing onto the front page of &quot;Pravda&quot; the headline, &quot;Gorbachev Urges Disarmament: Total! Unilateral!&quot;, but faulty translation caused the headline to read, &quot;Gorbachev Sings Tractors: Turnip! Buttocks!&quot; He has a fairly extensive criminal record as a result of his numerous computer pranks. Oliver is African-American. His mother has dressed her son to resemble Michael Jackson, much to Oliver&#x27;s chagrin.

===Other characters===
*Bobbi Harlow is the feminist schoolteacher of Milo and Binkley and the love interest of both Steve and Cutter. She was a major character from her introduction in April 1981 until mid-1982, in which her role largely dissipates into that of Cutter John&#x27;s sporadically appearing girlfriend, thus catalyzing her eventual disappearance by July 1983. She appears only once in the strip&#x27;s later years, when Opus learns she has joined the crew of &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;. In August 1981, her parents visited, and met Steve, whom they disliked.
*Quiche Lorraine, cousin of Bobbi Harlow and one-time girlfriend of Steve Dallas circa 1982. She was only dating Steve because of his body and dumped him after an accident left him in a full-body cast.
*Cozy Fillerup, single mother and love interest to Cutter John. She was introduced in the 2015 revival of the strip when Cutter John and crew ran over her with his wheelchair, the &quot;Aluminium Falcon&quot;.
*Abby Fillerup, Cozy&#x27;s sole daughter. She was introduced in the 2015 revival of the strip. She practices yoga, acupuncture, and other New Age beliefs. As her introduction is quite recent, her importance and involvement with the future of the strip is unknown. She has been seen to participate in the gang&#x27;s pop culture fantasies, and is often seen engaging in antics with the main cast.
*Tom Binkley, Binkley&#x27;s father, usually distraught over his son&#x27;s behavior, his own divorce or mid-life crisis.
*Frank Jones, Oliver&#x27;s father, who funds his son&#x27;s scientific endeavors, particularly his cure for baldness made from cat-sweat nicknamed &quot;Scalp Tonic&quot;.
*Eleanor Jones, Oliver&#x27;s mother, distrustful of technology and science, usually with good reason.
*Lola Granola, a free-spirited and gentle hippie who experiments with green politics and vegetarianism. She and Opus had a long engagement, but were married only seconds before Opus was knocked unconscious while clumsily trying to kiss her and had a nightmare of his future which caused him to annul the marriage the instant he woke up.
*Milquetoast the Cockroach: an eloquent yet disgusting cockroach living in the boarding house, he secretly uses subliminal messaging (usually in the form of whispering in the tenants&#x27; ears as they sleep) to convince them to spare his life and bring him food.
*Rosebud the Basselope, a basset hound with antlers (in a play on jackalope). As the last basselope on Earth (the second-to-last having been hunted and killed for sport by Donald Trump), Rosebud is somewhat gullible, naive, and easily shocked. Long after her introduction, it was determined that Rosebud was actually female, in a parody of the use of female dogs to portray the ostensibly male canine beer mascot Spuds McKenzie. The rebooted &quot;Bloom County&quot; gave her the ability to fly when her antlers were inflated with &quot;dandelion gas&quot;.
*Ronald-Ann Smith is a young, innocent African-American girl from &quot;the wrong side of the tracks&quot; who lives in poverty. Her frequent efforts to make the best of the little she has often make the rest of the cast feel selfish and uncomfortable. Her best friend is Reynalda, a headless doll. At the end of the first series of &quot;Bloom County,&quot; she shows Opus the way to Outland, presented as a magical imaginary world she created to escape her harsh reality.
* The Banana Jr. 6000 Computer (a blatant parody of the Apple Macintosh) is presented as an almost robot-like companion of Oliver, though he is quick to dispose of it if a newer model has even the slightest superficial upgrade.

==Notable story lines==
&quot;For detailed summaries of all story lines, see the entries for the individual books.&quot;
* Opus was originally intended to have a run of just two weeks, but his status was cemented with a memorable Sunday strip involving a Hare Krishna asking for money. Opus continued to misunderstand the Krishna&#x27;s request for money before finally misinterpreting &quot;Prayer temples for Hare Krishnas&quot; as &quot;Pear pimples for hairy fishnuts!&quot; Breathed wrote in one of the &quot;Bloom County&quot; books that the reaction was so overwhelmingly strong he made Opus a permanent member of the cast.
*In 1984 the American Meadow Party ran Bill the Cat as its presidential candidate opposing Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale, with Opus as the vice presidential candidate. Their campaign slogan was, &quot;This Time, Why Not The Worst?&quot; The sequence parodied the entire campaign season and the lengths some parties would go to, with Opus becoming near suicidal when told he is running behind pickled prunes in popularity polls. It did lead to the slogan of disaffected voters everywhere, &quot;Don&#x27;t blame me. I voted for Bill and Opus.&quot; 
* Steve forms a heavy metal band with Opus, Hodge Podge, and Bill, initially called &quot;Deathtöngue&quot;. Steve is forced to rename the band &quot;Billy and the Boingers&quot; after he is brought before a congressional hearing investigating the effect of heavy metal music on youth, similar to the Parents Music Resource Center.
* Opus decides to reunite with his long-lost mother for Christmas in Antarctica, only to discover that his mother supposedly died saving soldiers in the Falklands war. Her gravestone reads, &#x27;The Falklands Martyr: She Loved her Boy&#x27;. She is later revealed to be alive.
* The cast of Bloom County goes on strike. W. A. Thornhump refuses to concede to any of their demands and attempts to have his office staff fill in. Things get ugly when Steve Dallas crosses the picket line and Thornhump hires strike-breakers to play Opus, Bill, and Oliver. In the end, the strikers are defeated, although Opus still throws eggs at Steve, saying &quot;Here comes breakfast from Aunt Opus!!&quot;
*Oliver invents Dr. Oliver&#x27;s Scalp Tonic using Bill the Cat&#x27;s perspiration motivated from the thought of Dan Quayle becoming US president. The tonic miraculously will restore hair on anyone, but has the side effect of users producing &quot;ack&quot; noises. The US government bans it, but the gang decide to continue producing it illegally after discovering that desperate customers are willing to buy it at exorbitant prices. In a parody of the war on drugs, the gang is extremely successful while thwarting the ineffectual government attempts to stop the illegal trade. As violent crime arises from the trade, the tonic operation is fatally undermined when the government legalizes it. The effects are later to be shown as temporary, leaving Oliver&#x27;s father totally bald.
*Oliver learns of the Apartheid system in South Africa. He invents a &quot;pigmentizer&quot;, which will temporarily turn a white person black. Cutter John and Opus are dispatched to Washington to zap the South African ambassador, but their balloon-powered wheelchair crashes into the Atlantic Ocean and they disappear. Though officially listed as &quot;Eaten By Squid&quot;, Opus reappears some time later, suffering from such strong amnesia that he initially has no idea he is even a penguin. Eventually the fake news of a secret wedding between Eddie Murphy and Diane Sawyer, Opus&#x27; longtime crush, shocks him into recalling what happened. After drifting for a while between lost islands, using the wheelchair as a raft, Cutter John and Opus were rescued by a Soviet submarine and arrested as spies. In order to rescue him, Steve Dallas meets with Russian envoys to trade Cutter John in for the one thing they want from Bloom County: Bill the Cat.
*Donald Trump is accidentally and fatally injured by the anchor of his own yacht. Incredibly, surgeons turn to Bill the Cat as a donor body in which to insert Trump&#x27;s still-living brain. Trapped in Bill&#x27;s body, Trump finds himself disinherited from his financial empire and estranged from his wife Ivana. With nowhere else to turn, he takes Bill&#x27;s place in the Bloom County boarding house, making unsuccessful attempts to start from scratch and occasionally being given equally unsuccessful lessons on the value of life by Opus. This eventually culminates in Trump regaining power and using it to buy out Bloom County, firing the entire staff of characters in the process.

==End and spinoff strips==
Breathed decided to end the strip in 1989. In keeping with the continuity of the Bill the Cat/Donald Trump story line, Trump &quot;buys out&quot; the comic strip and fires all of the cast. In the strip&#x27;s final weeks the cast found new &quot;jobs&quot; with other comic strips. A &quot;goodbye party&quot; was held over the course of the week where characters talked about joining new strips. Portnoy and Hodge Podge get jobs as janitors behind the scenes at &quot;Marmaduke&quot;; Steve Dallas joins the cast of &quot;Cathy&quot; and attempts to pitch himself as a new superhero, but is quickly fired from both jobs; Michael Binkley becomes a wild boar skinner for &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;. Lola Granola says that she has been invited to pose for &quot;Playboy&quot;, which Opus dislikes. Milo Bloom is seen with a snake swallowing him head first and informing Opus he would be appearing Tuesdays in &quot;The Far Side&quot;. Oliver Wendell Jones is seen with the distinct features of &quot;Family Circus&quot; characters. He informs Opus he is being &quot;bussed in&quot; to the strip as part of a court order. Once &quot;Bloom County&quot; characters are scattered, only Opus is left as part of a plot to transition to Breathed&#x27;s next strip in &quot;Bloom County&quot;&#x27;s final week.

Shortly after &quot;Bloom County&quot; ended, Breathed started a Sunday-only strip called &quot;Outland&quot; with original characters and situations introduced in &quot;Bloom County&quot;&#x27;s final days. However, Opus, Bill and other characters eventually reappeared and slowly took over the strip. &quot;Outland&quot; ran from September 3, 1989, to March 26, 1995. Another Sunday-only spinoff strip called &quot;Opus&quot; ran from November 23, 2003, to November 2, 2008.

==Return==
On July 12, 2015, Breathed posted to his Facebook page a photo with the caption &quot;A return after 25 years. Feels like going home.&quot; The photo showed him drawing a comic strip with the title &quot;Bloom County 2015&quot; with Opus pictured in the first frame. A fan asked in the comments on the picture if this was in response to Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign; Breathed responded, &quot;This creator can&#x27;t precisely deny that the chap you mention had nothing to do with it.&quot; The next day, July 13, 2015, the first comic of the revived strip was officially posted online, also to Breathed&#x27;s Facebook page. The strip was relaunched under the &quot;Bloom County 2015&quot; title, only to be renamed simply as &quot;Bloom County&quot; at the start of 2016.

On the return of the strips Breathed stated:
 Breathed originally had no plans of publishing the new strips outside of his Facebook page, commenting that “Newspapers need deadlines, alas. Like my departed friend Douglas Adams used to say, the only part of deadlines I enjoyed was the whooshing sound as they sped by.” An archive of the new strips has started at GoComics since then. A new book was announced in June 2016; &quot;Bloom County Episode XI: A New Hope&quot; was a compilation of strips from 2015 and 2016. Two more books followed in 2017 and 2018, respectively. No more books have been published since. 

On April 11, 2022, Breathed posted a new strip on Facebook labeled &quot;Season 33, Episode 3&quot; in the title panel. It featured Steve Dallas and Opus in a satire of the MeToo Movement.

New installments of the strip have been released far more sporadically in recent years. In 2023, Breathed only created seven daily strips released between July 23rd and August 13th and has yet to release any at all for 2024. 

=== Incorporating Calvin and Hobbes ===
Starting from 2016, Breathed took on, with permission, the characters from &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; in an occasional series of strips.

==Influence==
&quot;Bloom County&quot; has had an influence on other cartoonists, particularly cartoonists who have an irreverent bent or tackle political topics in their work.

For example, Scott Kurtz, creator of the webcomic &quot;PvP&quot;, acknowledged Breathed&#x27;s contributions at one point with a strip expressing the opinion that &quot;so many webcomics. ..are nothing but &quot;Bloom County&quot; ripoffs&quot;, then lampooning itself by mimicking Breathed&#x27;s art and dialogue style in the final panel.

Aaron McGruder, creator of the comic and later animated series &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, has paid tribute to Breathed&#x27;s work as well, with a few aspects of the strip bearing more than a passing resemblance to important &quot;Bloom County&quot; features (including at least a couple of artistic similarities), and an episode of the animated series wherein the character Uncle Ruckus calls Breathed &quot;Master Penguin Draw&#x27;er&quot;.

The series was adapted into the 1991 animated Christmas special entitled &quot;A Wish for Wings That Work&quot;, which is now available on DVD.

==Bloom County location ==
The fictional setting of &quot;Bloom County&quot; served as a recurring backdrop for the comic and its sequels, although the nature of the setting was frequently altered.

In the comics, the county is presented as a stereotypical American midwestern small town. The small town setting was frequently contrasted with the increasing globalization taking place in the rest of the world; though Bloom County contained the likes of farmers and wilderness creatures by default, it was frequented by Hare Krishnas, feminists, and rock stars.

While the location of Bloom County is never explicitly mentioned, there have been some clues in the strip. When Oliver Jones identified Bloom County as the place where Halley&#x27;s Comet would crash into Earth, a sign was seen saying that it was at 35.05 N 146.55 E. This would place it in the Pacific Ocean, about 300 miles off the coast of Japan. Oliver&#x27;s previous calculation was 39.43 N 105.01 W, which would place it just south of Denver, Colorado. In an early strip, Milo gives his address as &quot;Box 163, Bloom County, N.I., 12460&quot;, the zip code for which would place it about 30 miles southwest of Albany, New York. Another strip has Opus trying to make airline reservations to Des Moines, Iowa. He balks at the outrageously high quoted price for a ticket stating that &quot;Des Moines is just 94 miles from Bloom County&quot;. Geographically, this would place Bloom County in either Iowa or the far north-central tier of counties of Missouri, but likely referring to the distance from Iowa City, where the strip was produced, to Des Moines . Also, in a Sunday strip with L.H. Puttgrass, he is holding a King Soopers bag, which would place the comic in Colorado. On January 29, 2016, Berkeley Breathed posted on Facebook that &quot;The Bloom County boarding house still sits in beautiful hayseedless Iowa City, home for this cartoonist for four years.&quot;

The county was home to the Bloom Boarding House, Steve Dallas&#x27; law offices, the &quot;Bloom Beacon&quot; and &quot;Bloom Picayune&quot; newspapers, at least one pond, and Milo&#x27;s Meadow. In the comic&#x27;s later years, the county contained what appeared to be a big-city ghetto (&quot;the wrong side of the tracks&quot;, as it was known).

The geographical profile of the county was fluid as the artistic style of the strip evolved. During most of &quot;Bloom County&quot;&#x27;s run, the rural meadow setting was presented realistically, while in its later years it became increasingly more abstract.

The &quot;Outland&quot; setting of the strip was originally set apart from the county by way of a magical doorway. By &quot;Outland&quot;&#x27;s end, the Outland appeared to be a part of Bloom County itself.

The final &quot;Outland&quot; strip listed the characters as living at &quot;555 Hairybutt St., Bloom County, Outland&quot;.

&quot;Opus&quot; also takes place in Bloom County.

===Real-world references===

Breathed lived in Iowa City, Iowa during the early years of the strip, and the setting of &quot;Bloom County&quot; resembles Iowa City in several ways. The Bloom Boarding House, which appeared as a high contrast photo within the strip, is modeled after the Linsay House located at 935 East College Street. Another Iowa City landmark, The Prairie Lights Bookstore, was referred to in the strip as the &quot;Prairie Lights Newsstand&quot;; original &quot;Bloom County&quot; artwork from Breathed now hangs in the bookstore. Another original &quot;Bloom County&quot; strip hangs in the Iowa City Public Library. Breathed used the call letters KRNA to refer to &quot;Bloom County&quot;&#x27;s rock radio station featuring &quot;Rockin&#x27; Charmin&#x27; Harmin&quot;. The call letters belong to an actual Iowa City rock station which featured a disc jockey named &quot;Charmin&#x27;&quot; Jeff Harmon in the 1980s. Several Iowa City local news items also directly inspired &quot;Bloom County&quot; story lines. For example, a fictional Ronald Reagan sexist gaffe, referring to women as &quot;little dumplin&#x27;s&quot;, was lifted from University of Iowa football coach Hayden Fry&#x27;s comment, infuriating feminists at the university.

== Animated series ==
On February 15, 2022, it was announced that a &quot;Bloom County&quot; television series is in development at Fox, with Berkeley Breathed as executive producer and co-writer. Bento Box will serve as the animation studio on the project. Fox&#x27;s animation company, Bento Box Entertainment, Miramax, Spyglass Media Group and Project X Entertainment are all working on it as an animated series. In September 2022, it was announced &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writer Tim Long joined the series as showrunner.

==&quot;Bloom County&quot; books==
Like many other popular comic strips, &quot;Bloom County&quot; has been republished in various collections. By 2004, the comic strip was reprinted in 11 books, the first having been published in 1983 and the last in that year. None of the reprints contained complete runs of the strip, although &quot;Bloom County Babylon&quot; contained many of the strips that preceded &quot;Loose Tails&quot;. All of the daily strips have been reprinted in &quot;Comics Revue&quot; magazine.

IDW Publishing published &quot;The Bloom County Library&quot;, a five volume hardback collection of all &quot;Bloom County&quot; strips, beginning in October 2009. This series is part of their &quot;Library of American Comics&quot; series. It is a complete reprint of the strip, including side notes about cultural and political references made in the strip, &quot;Headlines&quot; breaks to identify the top stories of the day, and commentary from Breathed. Each volume has three separate releases: a standard edition, a signed edition, and a signed, remarked edition. Breathed said that the reason why the strips printed in &quot;The Bloom County Library&quot; were not published in previous collections was that the publisher would not let Breathed publish 400 pages each year, so Breathed had to reduce the content in each book. Breathed also said that he believes that, &quot;I just closed my eyes and dropped a dart on the ones to be included.&quot; He felt relieved the publishers did not &quot;have to ask ... to do this again.&quot;

On October 25, 2017, IDW published &quot;Bloom County: Real, Classy, &amp; Compleat: 1980-1989&quot;, collecting the complete run of &quot;Bloom County&quot; in two volumes. An &quot;Ultimate Collectors Set&quot; was also released, including the original art from a daily strip featuring Opus, a page from Breathed&#x27;s sketchbooks, and a personalized sketch of Opus on the slipcover.

<text>Amusement rides, sometimes called carnival rides, are mechanical devices or structures that move people to create fun and enjoyment.

Rides are often perceived by many as being scary or more dangerous than they actually are. This could be due to the design, having acrophobia, or from hearing about accidents involving rides that are similar. For some, the adrenaline associated with riding amusement rides is part of the experience.

They are common at most annual events such as fairs, traveling carnivals, and circuses around the world. Sometimes music festivals and concerts also host amusement park rides.

== Types of rides ==

* Flat rides are usually those that move their passengers on a plane generally parallel to the ground, such as rides that spin around a vertical axis, like carousels and twists; and ground-level rides such as bumper cars.
* In gravity rides, gravity is responsible for all or some of the movement where any vertical movement is not about a fixed point, such as roller coasters, water slides and drop towers.
* Vertical rides usually move their passengers in a vertical plane and around a fixed point, such as Ferris wheels, Enterprise and Skydiver.
* As of the 2010s, some rides employ virtual reality.

=== Specific themes ===
* Dark ride
* Bumper cars
* Haunted house
* Funhouse
* Pendulum ride
* Rollercoaster
* Ferris wheel

<doc id="175573" wikidata="Q5575683" url="?curid=175573" title="God's Debris">
<text>God&#x27;s Debris: A Thought Experiment is a 2001 novella by &quot;Dilbert&quot; creator Scott Adams. The introduction disclaims any personal views held by the author, &quot;The opinions and philosophies expressed by the characters are not my own, except by coincidence in a few spots not worth mentioning.&quot;

&quot;God&#x27;s Debris&quot; espouses a philosophy based on the idea that the simplest explanation tends to be the best. The book proposes a form of pandeism and monism, postulating that an omnipotent God annihilated Itself in the Big Bang, because an omniscient entity would already know everything possible except Its own lack of existence, and exists now as the smallest units of matter and the law of probability, or &quot;God&#x27;s debris&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The main character, the Avatar, defines God as primordial matter (like quarks and leptons) and the law of probability. He offers recommendations on everything from an alternative theory for planetary motion to successful recipes for relationships under his system. He proposes that God is currently reassembling himself through the continuing formation of a collective intelligence in the form of the human race, modern examples of which include the development of the internet; this is related to the idea of the Omega Point. In the introduction, Adams describes &quot;God&#x27;s Debris&quot; as a thought experiment, challenging readers to differentiate its scientifically accepted theories from &quot;creative baloney designed to sound true&quot; and to &quot;[t]ry to figure out what&#x27;s wrong with the simplest explanation&quot;.

=== Levels of consciousness ===
The chapter &quot;Fifth Level&quot; (p. 124) describes five levels of human awareness, or consciousness.
* Level 1: Consciousness at birth: pure innocence, self-awareness.
* Level 2: Awareness of others, and acceptance of authority (a belief system).
* Level 3: Awareness that some beliefs may be wrong, but not sure which ones.
* Level 4: Skepticism and adoption of the scientific method.
* Level 5: Avatar level, understanding that the human mind is a delusion-generating machine, and that science is another belief system, albeit a useful one.

== Philosophical roots ==
The book subscribes to the Lakoffian point of view, in that the mind is viewed as a &quot;delusion generator&quot; rather than a window to true understanding. As George Lakoff said: &quot;Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature.&quot; The particular philosophy espoused has been identified as a form of pandeism, the concept that a god created the universe by becoming the universe.

== Publication ==
Given Adams&#x27; fame as the author of the &quot;Dilbert&quot; comics, publishers were wary of publishing any book by Adams without &quot;Dilbert&quot; content. The book was therefore released initially as an e-book in 2001, with comparatively small &quot;publishing&quot; costs. It was released in hard-cover format in 2004. In 2023, Adams announced in a pinned tweet that he had re-published the book for free for his subscribers, and would shortly publish an AI-voiced audiobook version.
