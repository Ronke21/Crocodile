==History and culture==
===Whakaahurangi===
The Māori name for Stratford is Whakaahurangi, meaning to look to the sky. The name is taken from a story of the Ngāti Ruanui chieftainess/Puhi Ariki named Rua-pū-tahanga who fled her husband Whatihua from Waikato, travelling the track known as Te ara tapu o Ruaputahanga which stretches from Urenui down through Tariki, and ends near Patea. Here she stopped at the side of the Kahouri river near a fresh water spring. It is said she sat distraught and cried into the spring, naming it Te Puna Roimata o Ruaputahanga (The spring of Rua-pū-tahanga&#x27;s tears), then camped overnight east of the current town. Being a clear night, Rua-pū-tahanga lay contemplating the stars when slumber overtook her. Withdrawing in respect, her followers observed that their chieftainess slept &quot;with her face to the sky&quot;. The site continued to be used as a camping place for Māori, the track she followed linking the south Taranaki tribes to those in north Taranaki, and further north to Kawhia. Each travelling party would recollect the story of Rua-pū-tahanga sleeping with her face to the sky.

Whakaahurangi Marae, a &quot;marae&quot; (meeting ground) of the Ngāti Ruanui tribe and its Ahitahi sub-tribe, is located in Stratford. It includes a &quot;wharenui&quot; (meeting house), known as Te Whetū o Marama.

===Surveying===
There is no record of Māori settlement in the vicinity of Stratford. Before British settlement the area was covered in dense forest and swamp. The Vogel schemes of the 1870s provided the necessary impetus to lead to the construction of a railway line south of New Plymouth, and the creation of road access at the same time, to open up access to the rich soils under the mountain.

In 1876, Taranaki Waste Lands Board assistant surveyor Edwin Stanley Brookes, Jnr. cut a meridian line from Waitara to the site of Stratford, and oversaw the subdivision of a block between the Manganui River and the Pātea River. The surveying of a new site for a town on the banks of the Pātea River was authorised on 11 June 1877, and the northern half of the town (above the Pātea River) was laid out by William Skinner in July. More lots were laid out by Peter Cheal in 1879, and in 1880 Skinner was directed to survey the southern half of the town.

===Naming===

On 3 December 1877, the name Stratford-upon-Patea was adopted, on the motion of William Crompton of the Taranaki Waste Lands Board. The town was named after Stratford-upon-Avon due to similarities of the Patea River and the River Avon in Warwickshire. The connection to William Shakespeare&#x27;s hometown led to the naming of 67 streets after Shakespearian characters from 27 of his plays.

Today New Zealand&#x27;s only glockenspiel clock tower plays the balcony scene from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; three times a day. The spoken words are provided via external loudspeakers - there is no carillon (multiple bells) as would be more typical for glockenspiels in towers.

===Settlement and growth===
Stratford was formally classified as a town in June 1878, and on 31 August 1878 an auction of 455 sections saw the first sections sold. By 1881 the population was 97, comprising 56 males and 41 females, with 22 houses. By 1891 this had grown to a population of 342 and by 1896 1,256. This growth continued steadily until the mid-late 20th century, and has since fluctuated between 5229 (2001) and 5664 (1996), numbering 5,337 at the last census.

===Institutional history===
The first Stratford Town Board was formed in 1882. The Stratford County Council was formed in 1890, and the Stratford Borough Council was formed on 22 July 1898. In the same year, Stratford became the third town in New Zealand to have electric street lighting, on the initiative of inventor and entrepreneur Alexander Walker Reid. The county and borough councils amalgamated on 1 April 1989 to form the Stratford District Council, which was reconstituted on 1 November 1989 as part of the nationwide restructure in local government.

<doc id="171990" wikidata="Q1077902" url="?curid=171990" title="Street Angel (1928 film)">
<text>Street Angel is a 1928 American synchronized sound drama film. While the film has no audible dialog, it was released with a synchronized musical score with sound effects using the sound-on-film movietone process. The film was directed by Frank Borzage, adapted by Harry H. Caldwell (titles), Katherine Hilliker (titles), Philip Klein, Marion Orth and Henry Roberts Symonds from the play &quot;Lady Cristilinda&quot; by Monckton Hoffe. As one of the early, transitional sound film releases, it did not include recorded dialogue, but used intertitles along with recorded sound effects and musical selections.

&quot;Street Angel&quot; was one of three movies for which Janet Gaynor received the first Academy Award for Best Actress in 1929; the others were F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Borzage&#x27;s &quot;7th Heaven&quot;.

The movie received two further Academy Award nominations in 1930, for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography, making it one of two English-language films to receive Oscar nominations in separate years. The other was &quot;The Quiet One&quot;, nominated in 1949 for Documentary Feature and 1950 for Story and Screenplay.

&quot;Street Angel&quot; entered the public domain in the United States in 2024.

==Plot==

A spirited young woman (Gaynor) tries to prostitute herself and, failing in that, to steal money, to pay for her seriously ill mother&#x27;s medicine. She is caught in the act and convicted but escapes from her guards, only to find her mother dead. Fleeing the pursuing police, she joins a traveling carnival, where she meets a vagabond painter (Farrell). Though they fall in love, her past will not leave her alone.

<text>In mathematics, the&quot;n&quot;th cyclotomic polynomial, for any positive integer &quot;n&quot;, is the unique irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients that is a divisor of formula_1 and is not a divisor of formula_2 for any Its roots are all &quot;n&quot;th primitive roots of unity 
formula_3, where &quot;k&quot; runs over the positive integers less than &quot;n&quot; and coprime to &quot;n&quot; (and &quot;i&quot; is the imaginary unit). In other words, the &quot;n&quot;th cyclotomic polynomial is equal to
:formula_4

It may also be defined as the monic polynomial with integer coefficients that is the minimal polynomial over the field of the rational numbers of any primitive &quot;n&quot;th-root of unity (formula_5 is an example of such a root).

An important relation linking cyclotomic polynomials and primitive roots of unity is
:formula_6
showing that formula_7 is a root of formula_8 if and only if it is a &quot;d&quot;th primitive root of unity for some &quot;d&quot; that divides &quot;n&quot;.

==Examples==

If &quot;n&quot; is a prime number, then 
:formula_9
If &quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;p&quot; where &quot;p&quot; is a prime number other than 2, then
:formula_10

For &quot;n&quot; up to 30, the cyclotomic polynomials are:

:formula_11

The case of the 105th cyclotomic polynomial is interesting because 105 is the least positive integer that is the product of three distinct odd prime numbers (3×5×7) and this polynomial is the first one that has a coefficient other than 1, 0, or −1:

:formula_12

==Properties==

===Fundamental tools===

The cyclotomic polynomials are monic polynomials with integer coefficients that are irreducible over the field of the rational numbers. Except for &quot;n&quot; equal to 1 or 2, they are palindromes of even degree.

The degree of formula_13, or in other words the number of &quot;n&quot;th primitive roots of unity, is formula_14, where formula_15 is Euler&#x27;s totient function.

The fact that formula_13 is an irreducible polynomial of degree formula_14 in the ring formula_18 is a nontrivial result due to Gauss. Depending on the chosen definition, it is either the value of the degree or the irreducibility which is a nontrivial result. The case of prime &quot;n&quot; is easier to prove than the general case, thanks to Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion.

A fundamental relation involving cyclotomic polynomials is 

:formula_19

which means that each &quot;n&quot;-th root of unity is a primitive &quot;d&quot;-th root of unity for a unique &quot;d&quot; dividing &quot;n&quot;.

The Möbius inversion formula allows formula_20 to be expressed as an explicit rational fraction:

:formula_21

where formula_22 is the Möbius function.

This provides a recursive formula for the cyclotomic polynomial formula_23, which may be computed by dividing formula_1 by the cyclotomic polynomials formula_25 for the proper divisors &quot;d&quot; dividing &quot;n&quot;, starting from formula_26:

:formula_27

This gives an algorithm for computing any formula_20, provided integer factorization and division of polynomials are available. Many computer algebra systems, such as SageMath, Maple, Mathematica, and PARI/GP, have a built-in function to compute the cyclotomic polynomials.

===Easy cases for computation===
As noted above, if is a prime number, then

:formula_29

If &quot;n&quot; is an odd integer greater than one, then 

:formula_30

In particular, if is twice an odd prime, then (as noted above)

:formula_31

If is a prime power (where &quot;p&quot; is prime), then

:formula_32

More generally, if with relatively prime to , then 

:formula_33

These formulas may be applied repeatedly to get a simple expression for any cyclotomic polynomial formula_20 in terms of a cyclotomic polynomial of square free index: If is the product of the prime divisors of (its radical), then

:formula_35

This allows formulas to be given for the th cyclotomic polynomial when has at most one odd prime factor: If is an odd prime number, and and are positive integers, then
:formula_36
:formula_37
:formula_38

For other values of , the computation of the th cyclotomic polynomial is similarly reduced to that of formula_39 where is the product of the distinct odd prime divisors of . To deal with this case, one has that, for prime and not dividing ,

:formula_40

===Integers appearing as coefficients===

The problem of bounding the magnitude of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomials has been the object of a number of research papers.
If &quot;n&quot; has at most two distinct odd prime factors, then Migotti showed that the coefficients of formula_13 are all in the set {1, −1, 0}.

The first cyclotomic polynomial for a product of three different odd prime factors is formula_42 it has a coefficient −2 (see above). The converse is not true: formula_43 only has coefficients in {1, −1, 0}.

If &quot;n&quot; is a product of more different odd prime factors, the coefficients may increase to very high values. E.g., formula_44 has coefficients running from −22 to 23; also formula_45, the smallest &quot;n&quot; with 6 different odd primes, has coefficients of magnitude up to 532.

Let &quot;A&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) denote the maximum absolute value of the coefficients of formula_23. It is known that for any positive &quot;k&quot;, the number of &quot;n&quot; up to &quot;x&quot; with &quot;A&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &gt; &quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot; is at least &quot;c&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)⋅&quot;x&quot; for a positive &quot;c&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) depending on &quot;k&quot; and &quot;x&quot; sufficiently large. In the opposite direction, for any function ψ(&quot;n&quot;) tending to infinity with &quot;n&quot; we have &quot;A&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) bounded above by &quot;n&quot;ψ(&quot;n&quot;) for almost all &quot;n&quot;.

A combination of theorems of Bateman and Vaughan states that on the one hand, for every formula_47, we have
:formula_48
for all sufficiently large positive integers formula_49, and on the other hand, we have
:formula_50
for infinitely many positive integers formula_49. This implies in particular that univariate polynomials (concretely formula_1 for infinitely many positive integers formula_49) can have factors (like formula_13) whose coefficients are superpolynomially larger than the original coefficients. This is not too far from the general Landau-Mignotte bound.

===Gauss&#x27;s formula===

Let &quot;n&quot; be odd, square-free, and greater than 3. Then:

:formula_55

for certain polynomials &quot;An&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) and &quot;Bn&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) with integer coefficients, &quot;An&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) of degree &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)/2, and &quot;Bn&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) of degree &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)/2 − 2. Furthermore, &quot;An&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is palindromic when its degree is even; if its degree is odd it is antipalindromic. Similarly, &quot;Bn&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is palindromic unless &quot;n&quot; is composite and &quot;n&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4), in which case it is antipalindromic.

The first few cases are

:formula_56

===Lucas&#x27;s formula===

Let &quot;n&quot; be odd, square-free and greater than 3. Then

:formula_57

for certain polynomials &quot;Un&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) and &quot;Vn&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) with integer coefficients, &quot;Un&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) of degree &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)/2, and &quot;Vn&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) of degree &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)/2 − 1. This can also be written

:formula_58

If &quot;n&quot; is even, square-free and greater than 2 (this forces &quot;n&quot;/2 to be odd),

:formula_59

for &quot;Cn&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) and &quot;Dn&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) with integer coefficients, &quot;Cn&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) of degree &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), and &quot;Dn&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) of degree &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) − 1. &quot;Cn&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) and &quot;Dn&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) are both palindromic.

The first few cases are:

:formula_60

===Sister Beiter conjecture===

The Sister Beiter conjecture is concerned with the maximal size (in absolute value) formula_61 of coefficients of &quot;ternary cyclotomic polynomials&quot; formula_62 where formula_63 are three odd primes.

== Cyclotomic polynomials over a finite field and over the -adic integers ==

Over a finite field with a prime number of elements, for any integer that is not a multiple of , the cyclotomic polynomial formula_13 factorizes into formula_65 irreducible polynomials of degree , where formula_14 is Euler&#x27;s totient function and is the multiplicative order of modulo . In particular, formula_13 is irreducible if and only if is a primitive root modulo, that is, does not divide , and its multiplicative order modulo is formula_68, the degree of formula_13.

These results are also true over the -adic integers, since Hensel&#x27;s lemma allows lifting a factorization over the field with elements to a factorization over the -adic integers.

==Polynomial values==
If takes any real value, then formula_70 for every (this follows from the fact that the roots of a cyclotomic polynomial are all non-real, for ).

For studying the values that a cyclotomic polynomial may take when is given an integer value, it suffices to consider only the case , as the cases and are trivial (one has formula_71 and formula_72). 

For , one has

:formula_73
:formula_74 if is not a prime power,
:formula_75 if formula_76 is a prime power with .

The values that a cyclotomic polynomial formula_20 may take for other integer values of is strongly related with the multiplicative order modulo a prime number. 

More precisely, given a prime number and an integer coprime with , the multiplicative order of modulo , is the smallest positive integer such that is a divisor of formula_78 For , the multiplicative order of modulo is also the shortest period of the representation of in the numeral base (see Unique prime; this explains the notation choice). 

The definition of the multiplicative order implies that, if is the multiplicative order of modulo , then is a divisor of formula_79 The converse is not true, but one has the following.

If is a positive integer and is an integer, then (see below for a proof)
:formula_80
where 
* is a non-negative integer, always equal to 0 when is even. (In fact, if is neither 1 nor 2, then is either 0 or 1. Besides, if is not a power of 2, then is always equal to 0)
* is 1 or the largest odd prime factor of .
* is odd, coprime with , and its prime factors are exactly the odd primes such that is the multiplicative order of modulo .

This implies that, if is an odd prime divisor of formula_81 then either is a divisor of or is a divisor of . In the latter case, formula_82 does not divide formula_79

Zsigmondy&#x27;s theorem implies that the only cases where and are

:formula_84 

It follows from above factorization that the odd prime factors of

:formula_85

are exactly the odd primes such that is the multiplicative order of modulo . This fraction may be even only when is odd. In this case, the multiplicative order of modulo is always .

There are many pairs with such that formula_86 is prime. In fact, Bunyakovsky conjecture implies that, for every , there are infinitely many such that formula_86 is prime. See for the list of the smallest such that formula_86 is prime (the smallest such that formula_86 is prime is about formula_90, where formula_91 is Euler–Mascheroni constant, and formula_15 is Euler&#x27;s totient function). See also for the list of the smallest primes of the form formula_86 with and , and, more generally, , for the smallest positive integers of this form.

* &quot;Values of&quot; formula_94 If formula_95 is a prime power, then 
::formula_96 
:If is not a prime power, let formula_97 we have formula_98 and is the product of the formula_99 for dividing and different of . If is a prime divisor of multiplicity in , then formula_100 divide , and their values at are factors equal to of formula_101 As is the multiplicity of in , cannot divide the value at of the other factors of formula_102 Thus there is no prime that divides formula_94

*&quot;If&quot; &quot;is the multiplicative order of&quot; &quot;modulo&quot; , &quot;then&quot; formula_104 By definition, formula_105 If formula_106 then would divide another factor formula_107 of formula_108 and would thus divide formula_109 showing that, if there would be the case, would not be the multiplicative order of modulo .

*&quot;The other prime divisors of&quot; formula_86 &quot;are divisors of&quot; . Let be a prime divisor of formula_86 such that is not be the multiplicative order of modulo . If is the multiplicative order of modulo , then divides both formula_86 and formula_113 The resultant of formula_20 and formula_99 may be written formula_116 where and are polynomials. Thus divides this resultant. As divides , and the resultant of two polynomials divides the discriminant of any common multiple of these polynomials, divides also the discriminant formula_117 of formula_118 Thus divides .

* &quot;and&quot; &quot;are coprime&quot;. In other words, if is a prime common divisor of and formula_81 then is not the multiplicative order of modulo . By Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, the multiplicative order of is a divisor of , and thus smaller than .

* &quot;is square-free&quot;. In other words, if is a prime common divisor of and formula_81 then formula_82 does not divide formula_79 Let . It suffices to prove that formula_82 does not divide for some polynomial , which is a multiple of formula_124 We take 
::formula_125 
:The multiplicative order of modulo divides , which is a divisor of . Thus is a multiple of . Now, 
::formula_126 
:As is prime and greater than 2, all the terms but the first one are multiples of formula_127 This proves that formula_128

==Applications==

Using formula_13, one can give an elementary proof for the infinitude of primes congruent to 1 modulo &quot;n&quot;, which is a special case of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions.

Suppose formula_130 is a finite list of primes congruent to formula_131 modulo formula_132 Let formula_133 and consider formula_134. Let formula_135 be a prime factor of formula_134 (to see that formula_137 decompose it into linear factors and note that 1 is the closest root of unity to formula_138). Since formula_139 we know that formula_135 is a new prime not in the list. We will show that formula_141

Let formula_142 be the order of formula_138 modulo formula_144 Since formula_145 we have formula_146. Thus formula_147. We will show that formula_148.

Assume for contradiction that formula_149. Since 

:formula_150 

we have 

:formula_151 

for some formula_152. Then formula_138 is a double root of 

:formula_154

Thus formula_138 must be a root of the derivative so 

:formula_156

But formula_157 and therefore formula_158 This is a contradiction so formula_148. The order of formula_160 which is formula_49, must divide formula_162. Thus formula_141
=== Periodic recursive sequences ===

The constant-coefficient linear recurrences which are periodic are precisely the power series coefficients of rational functions whose denominators are products of cyclotomic polynomials. 

In the theory of combinatorial generating functions, the denominator of a rational function determines a linear recurrence for its power series coefficients. For example, the Fibonacci sequence has generating function formula_164and equating coefficients on both sides of formula_165 gives formula_166 for formula_167. 

Any rational function whose denominator is a divisor of formula_8 has a recursive sequence of coefficients which is periodic with period at most &quot;n&quot;. For example, formula_169 has coefficients defined by the recurrence formula_170 for formula_167, starting from formula_172. But formula_173, so we may write formula_174which means formula_175 for formula_176, and the sequence has period 6 with initial values given by the coefficients of the numerator.

<doc id="171993" wikidata="Q229232" url="?curid=171993" title="Gloria Swanson">
<text>Gloria Josephine Mae Swanson (March 27, 1899April 4, 1983) was an American actress. She first achieved fame acting in dozens of silent films in the 1920s and was nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Actress, most famously for her 1950 turn in Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, which earned her a Golden Globe Award.

Swanson was born in Chicago and raised in a military family that moved from base to base. Her infatuation with Essanay Studios actor Francis X. Bushman led to her aunt taking her to tour the actor&#x27;s Chicago studio. The 15-year-old Swanson was offered a brief walk-on for one film and eventually a stock-players contract, beginning her life&#x27;s career in front of the cameras. Swanson left school, and was soon hired to work in California for Mack Sennett&#x27;s Keystone Studios comedy shorts opposite Bobby Vernon. 

She was eventually recruited by Famous Players–Lasky/Paramount Pictures, where she was put under contract for seven years and became a global superstar. She starred in a series of films about society, directed by Cecil B. DeMille, including &quot;Male and Female&quot; (1919). She continued as a successful movie star in &quot;The Affairs of Anatol&quot; (1921) and &quot;Beyond the Rocks&quot; (1922). She also starred in critically acclaimed performances such as &quot;Zaza&quot; (1923) and &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot; (1925).

In 1925, Swanson joined United Artists as one of the film industry&#x27;s pioneering women filmmakers. She produced and starred in the 1928 film &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot;, earning a nomination for Best Actress at the first annual Academy Awards. Her sound film debut performance in 1929&#x27;s &quot;The Trespasser&quot; earned her a second Academy Award nomination. &quot;Queen Kelly&quot; (1928–29) was a box-office disaster, but is remembered as a silent classic. After almost two decades in front of the cameras, her film success waned during the 1930s. Swanson received renewed praise for her return to the screen in her role as Norma Desmond in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950). She made only three more films, but guest-starred on several television shows, and acted in road productions of stage plays.

== Early life ==
Swanson was born in a small house in Chicago in 1899, the only child of Adelaide (née Klanowski) and Joseph Theodore Swanson (né Svensson), a soldier. She was raised in the Lutheran faith. Her father was a Swedish American and her mother was of German, French, and Polish ancestry. Because of her father&#x27;s attachment to the U.S. Army, the family moved frequently. She spent some of her childhood in Key West, Florida, where she was enrolled in a Catholic convent school, and in Puerto Rico, where she saw her first motion pictures.

==Career==

===1914–1918: Essanay/Keystone/Triangle===

Her family once again residing in Chicago, the adolescent Gloria developed a crush on actor Francis X. Bushman and knew he was employed by Essanay Studios in the city. Swanson later recalled that her Aunt Inga brought her at the age of 15 to visit Bushman&#x27;s studio, where she was discovered by a tour guide. Other accounts have the star-struck Swanson herself talking her way into the business. In either version, she was soon hired as an extra.

The movie industry was still in its infancy, churning out short subjects, without the advantage of today&#x27;s casting agencies and talent agents promoting their latest find. A willing extra was often a valuable asset. Her first role was a brief walk-on with actress Gerda Holmes, that paid an enormous (in those days) $3.25. The studio soon offered her steady work at $13.25 () per week. Swanson left school to work full-time at the studio. In 1915, she co-starred in &quot;Sweedie Goes to College&quot; with her future first husband Wallace Beery.
Swanson&#x27;s mother accompanied her to California in 1916 for her roles in Mack Sennett&#x27;s Keystone Studios comedy shorts opposite Bobby Vernon and directed by Clarence G. Badger. They were met at the train station by Beery, who was pursuing his own career ambitions at Keystone. Vernon and Swanson projected a great screen chemistry that proved popular with audiences. Director Charley Chase recalled that Swanson was &quot;frightened to death&quot; of Vernon&#x27;s dangerous stunts. Surviving movies in which they appear together include &quot;The Danger Girl&quot; (1916), &quot;The Sultan&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1917), and &quot;Teddy at the Throttle&quot; (1917). Badger was sufficiently impressed by Swanson to recommend her to the director Jack Conway for &quot;Her Decision&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Believe Everything&quot; in 1918. Triangle had never put Swanson under contract, but did increase her pay to $15 a week. When she was approached by Famous Players–Lasky to work for Cecil B. DeMille, the resulting legal dispute obligated her to Triangle for several more months. Soon afterward, Triangle was in a financial bind and loaned Swanson to DeMille for the comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Change Your Husband&quot;.
===1919–1926: Famous Players–Lasky/Paramount Pictures===

At the behest of DeMille, Swanson signed a contract with Famous Players–Lasky on December 30, 1918, for $150 a week, to be raised to $200 a week, and eventually $350 a week. Her first picture under her new contract was DeMille&#x27;s World War I romantic drama &quot;For Better, for Worse&quot;. She made six pictures under the direction of DeMille, including &quot;Male and Female&quot; (1919), in which she posed with a lion as &quot;Lion&#x27;s Bride&quot;. While she and her father were dining out one evening, the man who would become her second husband, Equity Pictures president Herbert K. Somborn, introduced himself, by inviting her to meet one of her personal idols, actress Clara Kimball Young.
&quot;Why Change Your Wife?&quot;, &quot;Something to Think About&quot; (both 1920), and &quot;The Affairs of Anatol&quot; (1921) soon followed. She next appeared in 10 films directed by Sam Wood, starting with &quot;The Great Moment&quot; (1921) and including &quot;Beyond the Rocks&quot; in 1922 with her longtime friend Rudolph Valentino. Valentino had become a star in 1921 for his appearance in &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;, but Swanson had known him since his days as an aspiring actor getting small parts, with no apparent hope for his professional future. She was impressed by his shy, well-mannered personality, the complete opposite of what his public image would become.

After her films with Wood, she appeared in &quot;Zaza&quot; (1923) directed by Allan Dwan. During her time at Famous Players–Lasky, seven more of her films were directed by Dwan. 

In 1925, Swanson starred in the French-American comedy &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot;, directed by Léonce Perret. Filming was allowed for the first time at many of the historic sites relating to Napoleon. While it was well received at the time, no prints are known to exist and it is considered to be a lost film. Swanson appeared in a 1925 short produced by Lee de Forest in his Phonofilm sound-on-film process. She made a number of films for Paramount, including &quot;The Coast of Folly&quot; (1925), &quot;Stage Struck&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Untamed Lady&quot; (1926). Before she could produce films with United Artists, she completed &quot;Fine Manners&quot; with Paramount and turned down an offer to make &quot;The King of Kings&quot; with DeMille.

===1925–1933: United Artists===

She turned down a one-million-dollar-a-year () contract with Paramount in favor of joining the newly created United Artists partnership on June 25, 1925, accepting a six-picture distribution offer from president Joseph Schenck. At the time, Swanson was considered the most bankable star of her era. United Artists had its own Art Cinema Corporation subsidiary to advance financial loans for the productions of individual partners. The partnership agreement included her commitment to a buy-in of $100,000 of preferred stock subscription.

====Swanson Producing Corporation====
The Swanson Producing Corporation was set up as the umbrella organization for her agreement with United Artists. Under that name, she produced &quot;The Love of Sunya&quot; with herself in the title role. The film, co-starring John Boles, was directed by Albert Parker, based on the play &quot;The Eyes of Youth&quot; by Max Marcin and Charles Guernon. The production was a disaster, with Parker being indecisive and the actors not experienced enough to deliver the performances he wanted. The film fell behind in its schedule and, by the time of its release, the end product had not lived up to Swanson&#x27;s expectations. While it did not lose money, it was a financial wash, breaking even on the production costs.

====Gloria Swanson Productions====

She engaged the services of director Raoul Walsh in 1927 and together they conceived of making a film based on W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s short story &quot;Miss Thompson&quot;. Gloria Swanson Productions proposed to film the controversial &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot; about the travails of a prostitute living in American Samoa, a project that initially pleased United Artists president Joseph Schenck. As she moved forward with the project, association members urged Schenck to halt the production due to its subject matter. The members took further steps by registering their discontent with Will H. Hays, Chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America. Walsh previously had his own battles with the Hays office, having managed to skirt around censorship issues with &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; By bringing him to the table, literally over breakfast in her home, Hays and Swanson developed a working relationship for the film. Hays was enthusiastic about the basic story, but did have specific issues that were dealt with before the film&#x27;s release. The project was filmed on Santa Catalina Island, just off the coast of Long Beach, California. Gross receipts slightly exceeded $850,000 (). At the first annual Academy Awards, Swanson received a nomination for Best Actress for her performance, and the film&#x27;s cinematographer George Barnes was also nominated.

==== Gloria Productions ====

By the end of 1927, Swanson was in dire financial straits, with only $65 in the bank. Her two productions had generated income, but too slowly to offset her production loan debts to Art Cinema Corporation. Swanson had also not made good on her $100,000 subscription for preferred United Artists shared stock. She had received financial proposals from United Artists studio head Joseph Schenck, as well as from Bank of America, prior to engaging the services of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. as her financial advisor. He proposed to personally bankroll her next picture and conducted a thorough examination of her financial records. Kennedy advised her to shut down Swanson Producing Corporation. She agreed to his plan for a fresh start under the dummy corporate name of Gloria Productions, headquartered in Delaware. Upon his advice, she fired most of her staff and sold her rights for &quot;The Love of Sunya&quot; and &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot; to Art Cinema Corporation. Kennedy then created the position of &quot;European director of Pathé&quot; to put her third husband Henry de La Falaise on the payroll.

Sound films were already becoming popular with audiences, most notably the films of singer Al Jolson, who had success with &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; released in 1927 and &quot;The Singing Fool&quot; in 1928. Kennedy, however, advised her to hire Erich von Stroheim to direct another silent film, &quot;The Swamp&quot;, subsequently retitled &quot;Queen Kelly&quot;. She was hesitant to hire Stroheim, who was known for being difficult to deal with and who was unwilling to work within any budget. Kennedy, nevertheless, was insistent and was able to get Stroheim released from contractual obligations to producer Pat Powers. Stroheim worked for several months on writing the basic script. Filming of &quot;Queen Kelly&quot; began in November. His filming was slow, albeit meticulous, and the cast and crew suffered from long hours. Shooting was shut down in January, and Stroheim fired, after complaints by Swanson about him and about the general direction the film was taking. Swanson and Kennedy tried to salvage it with an alternative ending shot on November 24, 1931, directed by Swanson and photographed by Gregg Toland.

Only two other films were made under Gloria Productions. &quot;The Trespasser&quot; in 1929 was a sound production, and garnered Swanson her second Oscar nomination. Written by Edmund Goulding, with Laura Hope Crews fine-tuning the dialogue, Kennedy approved funding for the go-ahead on the production. The film was a melodrama, complete with musical numbers sung by Swanson and completed in 21 days. The world premiere was held in London, the first American sound production to do so. Swanson was mobbed by adoring fans. Before leaving London, she sang at a concert carried over the BBC. &quot;What a Widow!&quot; in 1930 was the final film for Gloria Productions.

====United Artists stars on the radio====
Mary Pickford and her husband Douglas Fairbanks hosted the March 29, 1928, episode of the &quot;Dodge Hour&quot; radio program, originating from Pickford&#x27;s private bungalow at United Artists, and broadcast to audiences in American movie theaters. The brainchild of Joseph Schenck, it was a promotional come-on to attract audiences into movie theaters to hear the voices of their favorite actors, as sound productions became the future of commercial films. On hand were Swanson, Charlie Chaplin, Norma Talmadge, John Barrymore, Dolores del Río, and D. W. Griffith.

====Gloria Swanson British Productions Ltd.====
Before she began filming &quot;Perfect Understanding&quot; as Gloria Swanson British Productions Ltd., she finished a two-film package production for Art Cinema, which included &quot;Indiscreet&quot; and &quot;Tonight or Never&quot; (1931). &quot;Perfect Understanding&quot;, a 1933 sound production comedy, was the only film produced by this company. Made entirely at Ealing Studios, it co-starred Laurence Olivier as Swanson&#x27;s on-screen husband. United Artists bought back all of her stock with them, in order to provide her financing to make this film, and thereby ending her relationship with the partnership. The film was panned by the critics upon its release and failed at the box office.

===1938–1950: Creating new paths===
When she made the transition to sound films as her career simultaneously began to decline, Swanson moved permanently to New York City in 1938. Swanson starred in &quot;Father Takes a Wife&quot; for RKO in 1941. She began appearing in stage productions and starred in &quot;The Gloria Swanson Hour&quot; on WPIX-TV in 1948. Swanson threw herself into painting and sculpting and, in 1954, published &quot;Gloria Swanson&#x27;s Diary&quot;, a general newsletter. She toured in summer stock, engaged in political activism, designed and marketed clothing and accessories, and made personal appearances on radio and in movie theaters.

===1950–1977: Later career===

====&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;====
The film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; was conceived by director Billy Wilder and screenwriter Charles Brackett, and came to include writer D. M. Marshman Jr. They bandied about the name of Mae West, whose public persona even in her senior years was as a sex symbol, but she objected to playing a has-been. Mary Pickford was also considered for the lead role of Norma Desmond. It was director George Cukor who suggested Swanson, noting that she was once such a valuable asset to her studio that she was &quot;carried in a sedan chair from her dressing room to the set&quot;.

The storyline of the film follows a faded silent movie actress Norma Desmond (Swanson), in love with a failed screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden). She lives at the mansion with her former-husband-director-turned-butler Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim), who personally disliked the role and only agreed to it out of financial need. A clip from &quot;Queen Kelly&quot; was used for the scene where Joe and Norma are watching one of her silent films, and she declares, &quot;... we didn&#x27;t need dialogue, we had &quot;faces&quot;&quot;. Norma plays a card game of bridge with a group of actors also known as &quot;the Waxworks&quot;. They included Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. During the scene leading up to Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s cameo, where Max chauffeurs Joe and Norma to the studio, her Isotta Fraschini luxury automobile was towed from behind the camera, because Stroheim had never learned how to drive. Norma&#x27;s dreams of a comeback are subverted, and when Gillis tries to break up with her, she threatens to kill herself, but instead kills him. She becomes delusional by the time the police and news media arrive. Max sets up the studio lighting towards her on the staircase and directs her down towards the waiting police and news cameras, where she says, &quot;All right, Mr. DeMille, I&#x27;m ready for my close-up.&quot;

Although Swanson had objected to enduring a screen test for the film, she had been glad to be making much more money than she had been in television and on stage. She found the overall experience of making the movie a pleasure, and later stated, &quot;I hated to have the picture end ... When Mr. Wilder called ‘Print it!’ I burst into tears...” She was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award, but lost to Judy Holliday.

====Final films====
Swanson received several acting offers following the release of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, but turned most of them down, saying they tended to be pale imitations of Norma Desmond. Her last major Hollywood motion picture role was also her first color film, the poorly received &quot;3 for Bedroom C&quot; in 1952. 
Nationally syndicated columnist Suzy called it &quot;one of the worst movies ever made.&quot; In 1956, Swanson made &quot;Nero&#x27;s Mistress&quot;, an Italian film shot in Rome, which starred Alberto Sordi, Vittorio de Sica and Brigitte Bardot. Her final screen appearance, in 1974, was as herself in &quot;Airport 1975&quot;.

==== Television and theatre ====

Swanson hosted &quot;The Gloria Swanson Hour&quot;, one of the first live television series in 1948 in which she invited friends and others to be guests. Swanson later hosted &quot;Crown Theatre with Gloria Swanson&quot;, a television anthology series in which she occasionally acted.

Through the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s, Swanson appeared on many different talk and variety shows such as &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; to recollect her movies and to lampoon them as well. On &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; in 1973, Swanson reprised her impersonation of Charlie Chaplin from both &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; and &quot;Manhandled&quot;. She was the &quot;mystery guest&quot; on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;. She acted in &quot;Behind the Locked Door&quot; on &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; in 1964 and, in the same year, she was nominated for a Golden Globe award for her performance in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;. She made a guest appearance on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in the summer of 1970; a guest on the same show as Janis Joplin. She made a notable appearance in a 1966 episode of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, in which she plays herself. In the episode, the Clampetts mistakenly believe Swanson is destitute and decide to finance a comeback movie for her – in a silent film.

After near-retirement from movies, Swanson appeared in many plays throughout her later life, beginning in the 1940s. Actor and playwright Harold J. Kennedy, who had learned the ropes at Yale and with Orson Welles&#x27; Mercury Theatre, suggested Swanson do a road tour of &quot;Reflected Glory&quot;, a comedy that had run on the Broadway stage with Tallulah Bankhead as its star. Kennedy wrote the script for the play &quot;A Goose for the Gander&quot;, which began its road tour in Chicago in August 1944.

Swanson also toured with &quot;Let Us Be Gay&quot;. After her success with &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, she starred on Broadway in a revival of &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; with José Ferrer, and in &quot;Nina&quot; with David Niven. Her last major stage role was in the 1971 Broadway production of &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot; at the Booth Theatre. Kevin Brownlow and David Gill interviewed her for &quot;Hollywood&quot;, a television history of the silent era.

== Personal life ==
Swanson was a vegetarian and an early health food advocate who was known for bringing her own meals to public functions in a tin box.

She was known for her love of fragrances and was often portrayed among her wide collection of bottles. For the promotion of &quot;Tonight or Never&quot; in 1931, given that the movie title was inspired by the Offenthal fragrance name, an unprecedented tie-in advertising campaign was conceived to promote both the movie and the fragrance.

She was a pupil of the yoga guru Indra Devi and was photographed performing a series of yoga poses, reportedly looking much younger than her age, for Devi to use in her book &quot;Forever Young, Forever Healthy&quot;; but the publisher Prentice-Hall decided to use the photographs for Swanson&#x27;s book, not Devi&#x27;s. In return, Swanson, who normally didn&#x27;t do publicity events, helped to launch Devi&#x27;s book at the Waldorf-Astoria in 1953.

As a Republican she supported the 1940 and 1944 campaigns for president of Wendell Willkie and Thomas E. Dewey respectively, and the 1964 presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater. In 1980, she chaired the New York chapter of &quot;Seniors for Reagan-Bush&quot;.

In 1964, Swanson spoke at a &quot;Project Prayer&quot; rally attended by 2,500 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. The gathering, which was hosted by Anthony Eisley, a star of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; series, sought to flood the United States Congress with letters in support of mandatory school prayer, following two decisions in 1962 and 1963 of the United States Supreme Court, which struck down mandatory prayer as conflicting with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Joining Swanson and Eisley at the Project Prayer rally were Walter Brennan, Lloyd Nolan, Rhonda Fleming, Pat Boone, and Dale Evans. Swanson declared &quot;Under God we became the freest, strongest, wealthiest nation on earth. Should we change that?&quot;

In 1975, Swanson traveled the United States and helped to promote the book &quot;Sugar Blues&quot; written by her husband, William Dufty. He also ghostwrote Swanson&#x27;s 1981 autobiography &quot;Swanson on Swanson&quot;, which became a commercial success. The same year, she designed a stamp cachet for the United Nations Decade for Women, which was her last creative project.

=== Marriages and relationships ===

====Wallace Beery====
Wallace Beery and Swanson married on her 17th birthday on March 27, 1916, but by her wedding night she felt she had made a mistake and saw no way out of it. She did not like his home or his family and was repulsed by him as a lover. After becoming pregnant, she saw her husband with other women and learned he had been fired from Keystone. Taking medication given to her by Beery, purported to be for morning sickness, she miscarried the fetus and was taken unconscious to the hospital. Soon afterwards, she filed for divorce, which was finalized on December 12, 1918. Under California law in that era, after a divorce was granted, there was a one-year waiting period before it became finalized so that neither of the parties could remarry.

====Herbert K. Somborn====
She married Herbert K. Somborn on December 20, 1919. He was at that time president of Equity Pictures Corporation and later the owner of the Brown Derby restaurant. Their daughter, Gloria Swanson Somborn, was born on October 7, 1920. In 1923, she adopted one-year-old Sonny Smith, whom she renamed Joseph Patrick Swanson after her father. During their divorce proceedings, Somborn accused her of adultery with 13 men, including Cecil B. DeMille and Marshall Neilan. The public sensationalism led to Swanson having a &quot;morals clause&quot; added to her studio contract. Somborn was granted a divorce in Los Angeles, on September 19, 1923.

====Henri de la Falaise====

During the production of &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot;, Swanson met her third husband, Henri, Marquis de la Falaise (commonly known as Henri de la Falaise), who had been hired to be her translator during the film&#x27;s production. Though Henri was a Marquis and related to the famous Hennessy cognac family, he had no personal wealth. She had conceived a child with him before her divorce from Somborn was final, a situation that would have led to a public scandal and possible end of her film career. She had an abortion, which she later regretted. They married on January 28, 1925, after the Somborn divorce was finalized. Following a four-month recuperation from her abortion, they returned to the United States as European nobility. Swanson now held the title of Marquise. She received a huge welcome home with parades in both New York and Los Angeles. He became a film executive representing Pathé (USA) in France. This marriage ended in divorce in 1930.

In spite of the divorce they remained close, and Falaise became a partner in her World War II efforts to aid potential scientist refugees fleeing from behind Nazi lines. Swanson described herself as a &quot;mental vampire&quot;, someone with a searching curiosity about how things worked, and who pursued the possibilities of turning those ideas into reality. In 1939, she created Multiprises, an inventions and patents company; Henri de la Falaise provided a transitional Paris office for the scientists and gave written documentation to authorities guaranteeing jobs for them. Viennese electronics engineer Richard Kobler, chemist Leopold Karniol, metallurgist Anton Kratky, and acoustical engineer Leopold Neumann, were brought to New York and headquartered in Rockefeller Center. The group nicknamed her &quot;Big Chief&quot;.

====Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.====
While still married to Henri, Swanson had a lengthy affair with the married Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., father of future President John F. Kennedy. He became her business partner, and their relationship was an open secret in Hollywood. He took over all of her personal and business affairs and was supposed to make her millions. Kennedy left her after the disastrous &quot;Queen Kelly&quot;.

====Michael Farmer====
After the marriage to Henri and her affair with Kennedy was over, Swanson became acquainted with Michael Farmer, the man who would become her fourth husband. They met by chance in Paris when Swanson was being fitted by Coco Chanel for her 1931 film &quot;Tonight or Never&quot;. Farmer was a man of independent financial means who seemed not to have been employed. Rumors were that he was a gigolo. Swanson began spending time with him, during which she discovered a breast lump and also became pregnant, but was not yet divorced from Henri. She was not interested in marrying Farmer, but he did not want to break off the relationship. When Farmer found out she was pregnant, he threatened to go public with the news unless she agreed to marry him, something she did not want to do. Her friends, some of whom openly disliked him, thought she was making a mistake. They married on August 16, 1931, and separated 2 years later.

Because of the possibility that Swanson&#x27;s divorce from La Falaise had not been finalized at the time of the wedding, she was forced to remarry Farmer the following November, by which time she was four months pregnant with Michelle Bridget Farmer, who was born on April 5, 1932.

====Herbert Marshall====
Swanson and Farmer divorced in 1934 after she became involved with married British actor Herbert Marshall. The media reported widely on her affair with Marshall. After almost three years with the actor, Swanson left him once she became convinced he would never divorce his wife Edna Best, for her. In an early manuscript of her autobiography written in her own hand decades later, Swanson recalled &quot;I was never so convincingly and thoroughly loved as I was by Herbert Marshall.&quot;

====William M. Davey====

Davey was a wealthy investment broker whom Swanson met in October 1944 while she was appearing in &quot;A Goose for the Gander&quot;. They married January 29, 1945. Swanson had initially thought she was going to be able to retire from acting, but the marriage was troubled from the start by Davey&#x27;s alcoholism. Erratic behavior and acrimonious recriminations followed. Swanson and her daughter Michelle Farmer visited an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and gathered AA pamphlets, which they placed around the apartment. Davey moved out. In the subsequent legal separation proceedings, the judge ordered him to pay Swanson alimony. In an effort to avoid the payments, Davey unsuccessfully filed for divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty. He died within a year, not having paid anything to Swanson, and left the bulk of his estate to the Damon Runyon Cancer Memorial Fund.

====William Dufty====
Swanson&#x27;s final marriage occurred in 1976 and lasted until her death. Her sixth husband William Dufty was a writer who worked for many years at the &quot;New York Post,&quot; where he was assistant to the editor from 1951 to 1960. He was the co-author (ghostwriter) of Billie Holiday&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Lady Sings the Blues,&quot; the author of &quot;Sugar Blues&quot;, a 1975 best-selling health book still in print, and the author of the English version of Georges Ohsawa&#x27;s &quot;You Are All Sanpaku.&quot; They met in the mid-1960s and moved in together. Swanson shared her husband&#x27;s enthusiasm for macrobiotic diets, and they traveled widely together to speak about nutrition. Swanson and her husband first got to know John Lennon and Yoko Ono because they were fans of Dufty&#x27;s work. Swanson testified on Lennon&#x27;s behalf at his immigration hearing in New York City, which led to his becoming a permanent US resident. Besides her Fifth Avenue apartment, she and Dufty spent time at their homes in Beverly Hills, California; Colares, Portugal; Croton-on-Hudson, New York; and Palm Springs, California. After Swanson&#x27;s death, Dufty returned to his former home in Birmingham, Michigan. He died of cancer in 2002.

=== Death ===
Swanson died of a heart ailment at the New York Hospital on April 4, 1983, having recently returned from her home on the Portuguese Riviera. Her body was cremated and her ashes interred at the Church of the Heavenly Rest on Fifth Avenue in New York City, attended by a small number of family members.

After Swanson&#x27;s death, there was a series of auctions from August to September 1983 at William Doyle Galleries in New York. Collectors bought her furniture and decorations, jewelry, clothing, and memorabilia from her personal life and career.

== Honors and legacy ==
In 1960, Gloria Swanson was honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for motion pictures at 6750 Hollywood Boulevard, and another for television at 6301 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1955 and 1957, Swanson was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film, and in 1966, the museum honored her with a career film retrospective, titled &quot;A Tribute to Gloria Swanson&quot;, which screened several of her movies. In 1974, Swanson was one of the honorees of the first Telluride Film Festival. A parking lot by Sims Park in downtown New Port Richey, Florida, is named after the star, who is said to have owned property along the Cotee River.

In 1982, a year before her death, Swanson sold her archives of over 600 boxes for an undisclosed sum, including photographs, artwork, copies of films and private papers, including correspondence, contracts, and financial dealings, to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Upon her death in 1983, much of the remainder of her holdings was purchased by at an auction held at the Doyle New York gallery. An undisclosed amount of memorabilia was also gifted to the HRC Center between 1983 and 1988.

In 1989, the Library of Congress chose &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, along with 24 other films, &quot;to be preserved in the permanent collection of the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as culturally, historically, and aesthetically important&quot;.

<text>Sir Peter Brian Medawar (; 28 February 1915 – 2 October 1987) was a British biologist and writer, whose works on graft rejection and the discovery of acquired immune tolerance have been fundamental to the medical practice of tissue and organ transplants. For his scientific works, he is regarded as the &quot;father of transplantation&quot;. He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings. Richard Dawkins referred to him as &quot;the wittiest of all scientific writers&quot;; Stephen Jay Gould as &quot;the cleverest man I have ever known&quot;.

Medawar was the youngest child of a Lebanese father and a British mother, and was both a Brazilian and British citizen by birth. He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford, and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London. Until he was partially disabled by a cerebral infarction, he was Director of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill. With his doctoral student Leslie Brent and postdoctoral fellow Rupert E. Billingham, he demonstrated the principle of acquired immunological tolerance (the phenomenon of unresponsiveness of the immune system to certain molecules), which was theoretically predicted by Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet. This became the foundation of tissue and organ transplantation. He and Burnet shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Medawar was born in Petrópolis, a town 40 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where his parents were living. He was the third child of Lebanese Nicholas Agnatius Medawar, born in the village of Jounieh, north of Beirut, Lebanon, and British mother Edith Muriel (née Dowling). He had a brother Philip and a sister Pamela. (Pamela was later married to Sir David Hunt, who served as Private Secretary to prime ministers Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill.) His father, a Christian Maronite, became a naturalised British citizen and worked for a British dental supplies manufacturer that sent him to Brazil as an agent. (He later described his father&#x27;s profession as selling &quot;false teeth in South America&quot;.) His status as a British citizen was acquired at birth, as he said, &quot;My birth was registered at the British Consulate in good time to acquire the status of &#x27;natural-born British subject&#x27;.&quot;

Medawar left Brazil with his family for England at the end of World War I, in 1918 and he lived there for the rest of his life. According to other accounts, he moved to England when he was 13 (i.e., 1928–1929) or 14 (i.e., 1929–1930). He was also a Brazilian citizen by birth, as dictated by the Brazilian nationality law (jus soli). At 18 years, when he was of age to be drafted in the Brazilian Army, he applied for exemption of military conscription to Joaquim Pedro Salgado Filho, his godfather and the then Minister of Aviation. His application was denied by General Eurico Gaspar Dutra, and he had to renounce his Brazilian citizenship.

In 1928, Medawar went to Marlborough College in Marlborough, Wiltshire. He hated the college because &quot;they were critical and querulous at the same time, wondering what kind of person a Lebanese was—something foreign you can be sure&quot;, and also because of its preference for sports, in which he was weak. An experience of bullying and racism made him feel the rest of his life &quot;resentful and disgusted at the manners and mores of [Marlborough&#x27;s] essentially tribal institution,&quot; and likened it to the training schools for the Nazi SS as all &quot;founded upon the twin pillars of sex and sadism.&quot; His proudest moments at the college were with his teacher Ashley Gordon Lowndes, to whom he credited the beginning of his career in biology. He recognised Lowndes as barely literate but &quot;a very, very good biology teacher&quot;. Lowndes had taught eminent biologists including John Z. Young and Richard Julius Pumphrey. Yet Medawar was inherently weak in dissection and was constantly irked by their dictum: &quot;Bloody foolish is the boy whose drawing of his dissection differs in any way whatsoever from the diagram in the textbook.&quot;

In 1932, he went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with a first-class honours degree in zoology in 1935. Medawar was appointed Christopher Welch scholar and senior demy of Magdalen in 1935. He also worked at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology supervised by Howard Florey (later Nobel laureate, and who inspired him to take up immunology) and completed his doctoral thesis in 1941. In 1938, he became Fellow of Magdalen through an examination, the position he held until 1944. It was there that he started working with J. Z. Young on the regeneration of nerves. His invention of a nerve glue proved useful in surgical operations of severed nerves during World War II.

The University of Oxford approved his Doctor of Philosophy thesis titled &quot;Growth promoting and growth inhibiting factors in normal and abnormal development&quot; in 1941, but because of the prohibitive cost of supplication (the process by which the degree is officially conferred), he spent the money on his urgent appendicectomy instead. The University of Oxford later awarded him a Doctor of Science degree in 1947.

==Career and research==
After completing his PhD, Medawar was appointed a Rolleston Prizeman in 1942, senior research fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, in 1944, and a university demonstrator in zoology and comparative anatomy, also in 1944. He was re-elected fellow of Magdalen from 1946 to 1947. In 1947, he became Mason Professor of Zoology at the University of Birmingham and worked there until 1951. He transferred to University College London in 1951 as Jodrell Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy.

In 1962, he was appointed director of the National Institute for Medical Research. His predecessor Sir Charles Harrington was an able administrator such that taking over his post was, as he described, &quot;[N]o more strenuous than ... sliding over into the driving-seat of a Rolls-Royce&quot;. He was head of the transplantation section of the Medical Research Council&#x27;s clinical research centre at Harrow from 1971 to 1986. He became professor of experimental medicine at the Royal Institution (1977–1983), and president of the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (1981–1987).

=== Immunology ===

Medawar&#x27;s first scientific research was on the effect of malt on the development of connective tissue cells (mesenchyme) in chicken. Reading the draft of the manuscript, Howard Florey commented that it was more philosophical than scientific. It was published in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Experimental Physiology&quot; in 1937.

Medawar&#x27;s involvement with what became transplant research began during World War II, when he investigated possible improvements in skin grafts. His first publication on the subject was &quot;Sheets of Pure Epidermal Epithelium from Human Skin&quot;, which was published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1941. His studies particularly concerned solution for skin wounds among soldiers in the war. In 1947, he moved to the University of Birmingham, taking along with him his PhD student Leslie Brent and postdoctoral fellow Rupert Billingham. His research became more focused in 1949, when Australian biologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet, at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, advanced the hypothesis that during embryonic life and immediately after birth, cells gradually acquire the ability to distinguish between their own tissue substances on the one hand and unwanted cells and foreign material on the other.

With Billingham, he published a seminal paper in 1951 on grafting technique. Santa J. Ono, the American immunologist, has described the enduring impact of this paper to modern science. Based on this technique of grafting, Medawar&#x27;s team devised a method to test Burnet&#x27;s hypothesis. They extracted cells from young mouse embryos and injected them into another mouse of different strains. When the mouse developed into adult and skin grafting from that of the original strain was performed, there was no tissue rejection. The mouse had tolerated the foreign tissue, which would normally be rejected. Their experimental proof of Burnet&#x27;s hypothesis was first published in a brief article in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1953, followed by a series of papers, and a comprehensive description in &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B&quot; in 1956, giving the name &quot;actively acquired tolerance&quot;.

==== Research outcomes ====
Medawar was awarded his Nobel Prize in 1960 with Burnet for their work in tissue grafting which is the basis of organ transplants, and their discovery of acquired immunological tolerance. This work was used in dealing with skin grafts required after burns. Medawar&#x27;s work resulted in a shift of emphasis in the science of immunology from one that attempts to deal with the fully developed immunity mechanism to one that attempts to alter the immunity mechanism itself, as in the attempt to suppress the body&#x27;s rejection of organ transplants. It directly laid the foundation for the first successful organ transplantation in humans, specifically kidney transplantation, carried out by an American physician Joseph Murray, who eventually received the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

=== Theory of senescence ===
Medawar&#x27;s 1951 lecture &quot;An Unsolved Problem of Biology&quot; (published 1952) addressed ageing and senescence, and he begins by defining both terms as follows:

He then tackles the question of why evolution has permitted organisms to senesce, even though (1) senescence lowers individual fitness, and (2) there is no obvious necessity for senescence. In answering this question, Medawar provides two fundamental and interrelated insights. First, there is an inexorable decline in probability of an organism&#x27;s existence, and, therefore, in what he terms &quot;reproductive value.&quot; He suggests that it therefore follows that the force of natural selection weakens progressively with age late in life (because the fecundity of younger age-groups is overwhelmingly more significant in producing the next generation). What happens to an organism after reproduction is only weakly reflected in natural selection by the effect on its younger relatives. He pointed out that likelihood of death at various times of life, as judged by life tables, was an indirect measure of fitness, that is, the capacity of an organism to propagate its genes. Life tables for humans show, for example that the lowest likelihood of death in human females comes at about age 14, which in primitive societies would likely be an age of peak reproduction. This has served as the basis for all three modern theories for the evolution of senescence.

=== Theory on endocrine evolution ===
Medawar presented a talk on viviparity in animals (the phenomenon by which some animals give live birth) at a meeting on evolution at Oxford in July 1952. Later published in 1953, he introduced an aphorism:

Endocrine evolution is not an evolution of hormones but an evolution of the uses to which they are put; an evolution not, to put it crudely, of chemical formulae but of reactivities, reaction patterns and tissue competences.

The notion that evolution and diversity of endocrine function in animals are due to different uses of each hormone rather than different hormones themselves became an established fact. The paper is also regarded as a pioneer in the field of reproductive immunology.

== Personal life ==
Medawar never knew the exact meaning of his surname, an Arabic word, he was told, for &quot;to make round&quot;; but which a friend explained to him as &quot;little round fat man&quot;.

Medawar married Jean Shinglewood Taylor on 27 February 1937. They met while in graduate class at Oxford, he at Magdalen and Taylor at Somerville College. Taylor approached him for the meaning of &quot;heuristic&quot;, which she had to ask twice, and he had to finally offer lessons in philosophy. Medawar described her as &quot;the most beautiful woman in Oxford&quot;; but Taylor&#x27;s impression was he looked &quot;mildly diabolical.&quot; Taylor&#x27;s family objected to their marriage as Medawar had &quot;no background, and no money.&quot; Her mother was explicitly afraid of having &quot;black&quot; grandchildren; her aunt disinherited her. The couple had two sons, Charles and Alexander, and two daughters, Caroline and Louise.

Medawar was interested in a wide range of subjects including opera, philosophy and cricket. He was exceptionally tall, 6 ft 5 inches (196 cm), physically robust, with a big voice noted particularly during his lectures. He was renowned for wit and humour, which he claimed he inherited from his &quot;raucous&quot; mother. As he completed his PhD research in 1941, he did not receive the degree as he could not afford the requisite £25, to which he commented:

I&#x27;m an impostor. I am a doctor, but not a PhD... Morally I&#x27;m a PhD, in the sense I could have had one if I&#x27;d been able to afford it. Anyway it was unfashionable in my day. John Young [probably referring to John Zachary Young] was not a PhD either. A PhD was regarded then as a newfangled German importation, as bizarre and undesirable as having German bands playing on streetcorners.

He was regarded as the philosopher Karl Popper&#x27;s best-known disciple in science.

Medawar was the maternal grandfather of the screenwriter and director Alex Garland.

=== Views on religion ===
Medawar declared:

Although he normally sympathised with Christianity especially on moral teachings, he found the Biblical stories unethical and was &quot;shocked by the way in which [Biblical] characters deceived and defrauded each other.&quot; He even asked his wife &quot;to make sure that such a book did not fall into the hands of [their] children.&quot;

Nonetheless, he also said the following, which suggests that although religion has good value for humans in aggregate, it does not help them all equally:

== Later life and death ==
In 1959 Medawar was invited by the BBC to present the broadcaster&#x27;s annual Reith Lectures—following in the footsteps of his colleague, J. Z. Young, who was Reith Lecturer in 1950. For his own series of six radio broadcasts, titled &quot;The Future of Man&quot;, Medawar examined how the human race might continue to evolve.

While attending the annual British Association meeting in 1969, Medawar suffered a stroke when reading the lesson at Exeter Cathedral, a duty which falls on every new President of the British Association. It was, as he said, &quot;monstrous bad luck because Jim Whyte Black had not yet devised beta-blockers, which slow the heart-beat and could have preserved my health and my career&quot;. Medawar&#x27;s failing health may have had repercussions for medical science and the relations between the scientific community and government. Before the stroke, Medawar was one of Britain&#x27;s most influential scientists, especially in the biomedical field.

After the impairment of his speech and movement, Medawar, with his wife&#x27;s help, reorganised his life and continued to write and do research though on a greatly restricted scale. However, he suffered further strokes and in 1987 he died in the Royal Free Hospital, London. He is interred with his wife Jean (1913–2005) in the graveyard of St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Alfriston in East Sussex.

==Awards and honours==
Medawar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1949. With Frank Macfarlane Burnet he shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance&quot;. The British government conferred him a CBE in 1958, knighted him in 1965, and appointed him to the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1972, and Order of Merit in 1981. He was elected an EMBO Member in 1964 and received the Royal Medal in 1959, and the Copley Medal in 1969 both from the Royal Society. He was President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science during 1968–1969. He was awarded the UNESCO Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science in 1985. He was awarded a Honorary Doctor of Science Degree in 1961 by the University of Birmingham. He was elected a member of the American Society of Immunologists in 1971, and elected foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959, the American Philosophical Society in 1961, and the US National Academy of Sciences in 1965.

Medawar was elected President of the Royal Society for the term 1970–1975, but a severe stroke in 1969 prohibited him from taking up the office.

Medawar was awarded the 1987 Michael Faraday Prize &quot;for the contribution his books had made in presenting to the public, and to scientists themselves, the intellectual nature and the essential humanity of pursuing science at the highest level and the part it played in our modern culture&quot;.

Medawar has three awards named after him:

# The Royal Society created the Medawar Lecture in 1986 in a subject relating to the history of science, philosophy of science or the social function of science. Since 2007, the lecture has been merged with two older ones honouring John Wilkins and John Desmond Bernal, and became Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar Lecture and the accompanying award, Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar Medal.
# Medawar Medal, awarded by the British Transplant Society in recognition of significant research in organ transplantation.
# Peter Brian Medawar Medal, awarded by the State Medical Academy of Rio de Janeiro.

The University of Oxford has established a research consortium named the Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research.

The Department of Science and Technology Studies of the University College London has STS Peter Medawar Prize for undergraduate students.

The University of Birmingham Public Engagement with Research (PER) Team established an annual Light of Understanding Award to individuals and groups who accomplished public engagement with research work.

== Publications ==
Medawar was recognised as a brilliant author. Richard Dawkins called him &quot;the wittiest of all scientific writers&quot;, and &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine&#x27;s obituary called him &quot;perhaps the best science writer of his generation&quot;.

One of his best-known essays is his 1961 criticism of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin&#x27;s &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot;, of which he said: &quot;Its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself&quot;.

Apart from his books on science and philosophy, he wrote a short feature article on &quot;Some Meistersinger Records&quot; in the issue of &quot;The Gramophone&quot; for November 1930. The author was a P. B. Medawar. The evidence that this was indeed the future Sir Peter Medawar—then a schoolboy of 15—was discussed in &quot;Gramophone&quot; in 1995 (&quot;&#x27;Gramophone&#x27;, &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; and immunology&quot;, by John E. Havard, December 1995).

<text>Sadie Thompson is a 1928 American silent drama film that tells the story of a &quot;fallen woman&quot; who comes to Pago Pago to start a new life, but encounters a zealous missionary who wants to force her back to her former life in San Francisco. The film stars Gloria Swanson, Lionel Barrymore, and Raoul Walsh, and it is one of Swanson&#x27;s more successful films. Due to the public&#x27;s apathy towards silent films, a sound version was prepared in the latter half of 1928. While the sound version has no audible dialog, it features a synchronized musical score with sound effects along with a theme song.

Due to the subject matter, the making of the film was extremely controversial. However, it was a financial and critical success for Swanson. The film was based on the 1921 short story &quot;Rain&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham and the 1922 play, based on the story, by John Colton and Clemence Randolph, starring Jeanne Eagels.

==Plot==
A smoking, drinking, jazz listening, young prostitute named Sadie Thompson (Gloria Swanson) arrives at Pago Pago (American Samoa), on her way to a job with a shipping line on another island. At the same time, &#x27;moralists&#x27; arrive, including Mr. and Mrs. Davidson (Lionel Barrymore and Blanche Friderici). They all end up staying in the same hotel, where the Davidsons plot to teach the natives about sin and Sadie entertains a bunch of Marines.

Sadie begins to fall in love with Sergeant Timothy O&#x27;Hara (Raoul Walsh), who is not fazed by her past. He tells her that he has a best friend who married a former prostitute, and the couple now lives happily in Australia.

Davidson sets about trying to redeem Sadie, much to her disgust. He tricks her into telling him about her past in San Francisco, and once she refuses to repent, he declares that he will go to the governor and have her deported. Sadie is terrified of the threat, but O&#x27;Hara assures her that it will not happen. He tells her he wishes she would go to Australia and wait for his term of service to finish, after which they can get married. She agrees.

Davidson gets his way, however, and Sadie is livid. She and O&#x27;Hara go to the governor, begging him to let her go to Australia instead of back to San Francisco. Davidson has managed to get O&#x27;Hara punished for being immoral, but Sadie will be able to go to Australia if Davidson approves. Sadie pleads with him, but to no avail. She eventually confesses that, if she goes back to San Francisco, there is &quot;a man there who won&#x27;t let her go straight&quot;, which is what she wants to do. Davidson figures out this statement means that there is a warrant for her arrest back in San Francisco. Sadie claims that she was framed and she is innocent, but will go to prison if she is sent back.

Davidson still refuses, saying she must atone for her past. Sadie pleads and pleads and eventually offers to repent. Davidson, however, says that the only way to fully repent is for her to go to prison. Sadie runs to her room, crying out for Davidson. Davidson returns, and Sadie confesses she is afraid. Davidson then tells her that, if she repents, there will be nothing to fear and he begins to pray with her. Sadie converts to Christianity.

Sadie prays for three whole days. She has put away her old things and has become a modest woman. O&#x27;Hara returns and finds Davidson is gone, apparently &quot;trying to stop the locals from dancing on the beach&quot;. O&#x27;Hara tells Sadie that he has a fishing boat waiting to take her and her things to a ship that will then take her to Australia, where they can marry and be free. Sadie is extremely afraid and refuses to go, saying that the &quot;old Sadie is dead&quot; and she must go to San Francisco and prison to repent.

O&#x27;Hara does everything he can, including forcibly taking her from the room, but Davidson is waiting outside. O&#x27;Hara tries to attack him, but Sadie asks him to stop. O&#x27;Hara, extremely upset, leaves and Sadie pleads with Davidson not to get him in trouble, for &quot;it was all her fault&quot;.

Later that night, Sadie is asleep, and everyone else is heading to bed. Davidson can not sleep and goes out for a walk in the rain. (It has rained almost continuously.) His wife says he cannot sleep for &quot;the unpleasant dreams he&#x27;s been having about Miss Thompson&quot;. A fellow boarder suspects they are not &quot;all that unpleasant&quot;. Outside, Davidson struggles with himself and realizes that he is sexually attracted to Sadie and that he is unable to handle it. He looks into her window and eventually returns to his room.

Sadie, frightened because she heard noises, is waiting in Davidson&#x27;s room. Davidson is shocked and sends her back to her room.

The last reel of the film is missing, but the story as originally filmed was that the fishermen find Davidson&#x27;s body. He has committed suicide. Sadie and O&#x27;Hara reconcile and head for Australia.

==Production==

In 1927, Swanson released &quot;The Love of Sunya&quot; her first independent film for United Artists, which was filmed on her terms in New York City, and it was the opening night film of the Roxy Theatre. The production had been a disaster, and Swanson felt it would receive a mediocre reception at best. On the advice of Joseph Schenck, she relented and returned to Hollywood to prepare for a new picture. Feeling she would never have as much artistic freedom and independence as she had at that moment, Swanson decided she &quot;wanted to make my &quot;Gold Rush&quot;,&quot; referring to a recent film by Charlie Chaplin, which became perhaps his most celebrated work. Schenck pleaded with her to do a commercially successful film like &quot;The Last of Mrs. Cheyney&quot;. Swanson felt it too formulaic and decided to call upon director Raoul Walsh, who was signed with Fox Film Corporation at the time.

Walsh had been known for bringing controversial material to film. At their first meeting, Swanson suggested a film based on the John Colton and Clemence Randolph play &quot;Rain&quot; (1923), which in turn was based on the story by W. Somerset Maugham titled &quot;Miss Thompson&quot; (1921). Swanson had seen Jeanne Eagels perform the role on stage twice and enjoyed it.

However, because of its content, the play was on the &#x27;unofficial blacklist&#x27; and had quietly been banned from being made into a film a year earlier. To try to avoid issues with the code, Swanson and Walsh decided to leave out profanity, rename &#x27;Reverend Davidson&#x27; to &#x27;Mr. Davidson&#x27;, and claim it was for the sake of morality to produce the picture, as Irving Thalberg had produced &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1926) at MGM.

Swanson invited Will Hays for lunch and summarized the plot, naming the author and the sticking points. According to Swanson, Hays made a verbal promise that he would have no problem with the making of such a film. Swanson set about getting the rights to the play by having Schenck pretend to buy it in the name of United Artists, never to be used. Thus they were able to get the story rights for $60,000 instead of the original $100,000. When news broke as to just what was intended with the play, the three authors threatened to sue. Swanson later contacted Maugham requesting that he write an original story that served as a sequel. The sequel would involve following what became of Sadie in Australia. Maugham agreed to write a new story (for $100,000) but a sequel never was made.

Swanson and Walsh set about writing the script, and discreetly placed an ad announcing the film, thinking no one noticed, as Charles Lindbergh had just made his historic flight. However, the press picked up on it and sensationalized the story. United Artists received a threatening two-page telegram from the MPAA, signed by all its members including Fox (Walsh&#x27;s studio) and Hays himself. In addition, the rest of the signers owned several thousand movies houses and if they refused to screen the film, it could be a financial disaster. It was the first time Swanson had heard the name of Joseph P. Kennedy, with whom she later had an affair and who financed her next few pictures, including &quot;Queen Kelly&quot; (1929).

Swanson was angered by the response, as she felt those very studios had produced &quot;questionable&quot; films themselves and were jealous at not having the chance to produce &quot;Rain&quot;. After another threatening telegram, she decided to first appeal to MPAA and then the newspapers. She only heard back from Marcus Loew, who promised to appeal on her behalf, and his owning a chain of theatres eased some of her concerns. Figuring the silence meant the matter had been dropped, Swanson began filming on &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot;, which already had $250,000 invested in it.

Before casting began, 17-year-old Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. wanted to audition for the role of Handsome O&#x27;Hara. However, Swanson felt he was too young and not right for the role. Lionel Barrymore, picked first to play Davidson, was thought to be too ill at the time but ended up winning the role. Barrymore wore the same outfit for an entire week, aggravating Swanson. She asked some of the crew to tell him to change and wash, which he did. Swanson was happy with his performance. Walsh had not acted in front of a camera in eight years and feared he would not be able both to direct and to act at the same time. However, two days into filming, his fears were quelled.

Filming took place on Santa Catalina Island, near Long Beach, California. Swanson took ill shortly after and met a doctor who started her lifelong love of macrobiotic diets. A week into shooting, Sam Goldwyn called cameraman George Barnes away. Swanson was furious, but the loan contract allowed Goldwyn to call him away as he pleased. Not wanting to let a hundred extras sit around for days, Swanson and Walsh tried to hire two other cameramen, but both were unsatisfactory. Mary Pickford offered the services of Charles Rosher, her favorite cameraman, but despite doing a decent job, he could not match Barnes&#x27; work. Through Loew, MGM loaned Oliver Marsh, who completed the picture.

The entire cameraman problem was extremely costly to the production, yet the picture continued. With the picture half-finished, it was already way over budget, and Schenck was wary, as Swanson&#x27;s first picture also had been over budget and underperformed. Swanson talked with her advisers and sold her farm at Croton-on-Hudson, and she offered to sell her New York penthouse as well.

Despite reports that dirty words can be read on the characters&#x27; lips, Swanson claims the censors went over everything meticulously. However, Swanson admitted one line while she was shouting at Davidson went &quot;You&#x27;d rip the wings off of a butterfly, you son of a bitch!, when recounting a conversation with Walsh later in life. If the word &quot;rain&quot; was used in a title card, the censors asked that it be removed. They also wanted to change Davidson&#x27;s name to something else, but Swanson and Walsh refused.

It was the first time Raoul Walsh had acted in 15 years, and it was his last appearance before the camera. He directed and was to star in his next project &quot;In Old Arizona&quot;. While on location for that film a jackrabbit jumped through the windshield of his car, and he lost his right eye in the resulting crash. He gave up acting and went on to an illustrious career as a director.

==Release and reception==

Upon its release, critics praised the movie and Swanson&#x27;s performance. Contemporary film critics have cited Swanson&#x27;s performance as one of her best.

The film was a financial and critical success, and it was the only silent, independent film of Swanson&#x27;s to do well at the box office. In fact, it was one of her financially successful films, along with the sound films &quot;The Trespasser&quot; and &quot;Sunset Blvd&quot;. It made $1 million in the United States and $7 million internationally. However, at Kennedy&#x27;s advice, Swanson had sold her distribution rights for the film to Schenck because Kennedy felt it would be a commercial failure. He also did not care for the image Swanson portrayed in the film. By this point, &quot;Queen Kelly&quot; had been a disaster, and Swanson regretted it.

The film made the top 10 best pictures of the year list as well.

==Awards and honors==
Swanson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, and George Barnes for Best Cinematography at the 1st Academy Awards for this film, &quot;The Devil Dancer&quot; and &quot;The Magic Flame&quot;. Swanson did not attend the ceremony, and always felt it was like &quot;comparing apples to oranges.&quot;

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – Nominated

==Restoration and home media==
The film was thought to have been lost for years. After Swanson&#x27;s death in 1983, the sole known surviving print of the film was discovered by her estate; it had been stored in Mary Pickford&#x27;s personal archive. By that time, the final reel had become damaged. The film was bought by Kino International, which hired Dennis Doros to reconstruct the final reel. Doros used the original title sequences, still photos and footage from the 1932 adaptation (which cinematographer Oliver T. Marsh also shot) to substitute for the lost footage. A new score by Joseph Turrin was composed for the film.

Kino&#x27;s version has been issued on DVD and online via Netflix, as well as shown on Turner Classic Movies.

<doc id="172006" wikidata="Q7810216" url="?curid=172006" title="Tītokowaru">
<text>Riwha Tītokowaru (born Riwha, 1823– 18 August 1888) was a Taranaki Māori rangatira, military commander, general and religious leader. He is considered to be one of the most capable and influential military strategists in New Zealand history. He waged a war against invading settlers and Crown forces which became known as Tītokowaru&#x27;s War. His reputation has stayed largely the same for 150 years; James Belich has described him as &quot;perhaps the greatest war leader either of New Zealand’s peoples has ever produced&quot;. 

After the period of warfare he again became an advocate for peace and made diplomatic efforts between Māori, colonial settlers and the government. He was arrested and jailed after a peaceful occupation of land near Manaia in 1886 and he died two years later in 1888.

== Early life ==
Riwha was a subtribal leader, having succeeded his father Tītokowaru the Elder (died 22 February 1848) of the Ngāti Ruanui and Ngāruahine iwi in South Taranaki. A lot of what was accomplished by his father had been wrongly attributed to the son; being events of intertribal warring during his time of preadolescence. There is some mystery about his early life, but he is known to have become a Methodist in 1842 having been baptised and given the name of Hohepa Otene (named after the missionary). He joined the &quot;King Movement&quot; and fought in the First Taranaki War in 1860 and 1861. 

In 1865 and 1866, British troops conducted a punitive campaign throughout Taranaki, though they were unable to force a decisive result. 

In 1867, the year was declared by Tītokowaru to be a year of peace, &quot;the year of the daughters...the year of the lamb&quot;, and he led over 100 of his followers on a peace march during the winter of 1867 from Waihi, near Hawera, down to Patea and Whanganui and ending at Pipiriki on the upper Whanganui River.

However, continuing disputes with settlers proved intolerable and in 1868 Tītokowaru went to war.

== Tītokowaru&#x27;s War (1868–69) ==

In June 1868 Tītokowaru&#x27;s forces destroyed a colonist blockhouse at Turuturumokai, inland of Hāwera. The colonial response was to send a large contingent to destroy Tītokowaru&#x27;s stronghold. On 7 September 1868 the colonial forces were defeated with heavy casualties. The stronghold was then abandoned. Amongst the dead was the famous Prussian adventurer Gustavus von Tempsky. Turuturumokai was, previous to becoming a Pākehā garrison, a small Māori encampment, which had been found to be abandoned. Later after careful surveying, it was also discovered that, contrary to appearances, Turuturumokai was not as inconquerable as thought by British troops. The Māori decision to leave Turuturumokai was a strategic move.

Tītokowaru then advanced southward and defeated a second colonial force at Moturoa. He then stopped at Tauranga Ika and proceeded to build another fortress pā. This diamond-shaped fortress is considered the strongest ever constructed in New Zealand according to James Belich. It had numerous underground bunkers and tunnels, which could withstand heavy bombardment. There were three types of firing positions: trenches, loopholed palisades and European-style bastions from which fire could be directed along the frontages of the diamond. On the north-west corner was a tall lookout tower. At 5 am, on 2 February 1869, the advance party moved to within a few hundred meters of the stronghold and artillery opened fire. Māori returned rifle fire from within. Under cover of darkness, the colonial force closed the fort to within shouting distance. Both sides shouted and sang to encourage themselves until at 3 am the fighting reached a peak, gradually dying away until daybreak. At dawn, the army noticed the pā had gone very quiet. Three men approached the pa with great caution and found it deserted.

== Later life ==

His later understanding of the needed union of two peoples (Māori and settler) was incomparable. He advocated peace and diplomacy between the British and Māoridom. He practised his own message, demonstrating great tolerance that was noted by many settlers and authority figures of his time.

In 1886, he was part of a peaceful occupation of land near Manaia. Tītokowaru and nine others were taken to Wellington and, after being held in jail for two and a half months, were tried and sentenced to jail. He died on 18 August 1888 at his home in Ōkaiawai.

Hailed as a war leader, prophet and peacemaker, Tītokowaru&#x27;s story lapsed into obscurity before being popularised by New Zealand historian James Belich in his works on the New Zealand Wars. He is also the subject of a Maurice Shadbolt novel &quot;Monday&#x27;s Warriors&quot;. The character, Te Kaipo, in the 2005 film &quot;River Queen&quot;, played by Temuera Morrison, is closely based on Tītokowaru.

<text>Maurice Francis Richard Shadbolt (4 June 1932 – 10 October 2004) was a New Zealand writer and occasional playwright.

==Biography==
Shadbolt was born in Auckland, and was the eldest of three children. He had a younger brother and sister, Peter and Julia. Shadbolt was educated at Te Kuiti High School, Avondale College and Auckland University College. Shadbolt began writing for local West Auckland community newspapers. In the 1960s, he moved to Titirangi with his family, buying a house that overlooked Little Muddy Creek, where he spent the next 42 years writing.

In total, Shadbolt wrote 11 novels, four collections of short stories, two autobiographies, a war history, and a volume of journalism, as well as plays. He won the Katherine Mansfield Memorial Award for a short story three times: in 1963, 1967 and 1995. His first collection of short stories, &quot;The New Zealanders&quot;, was published in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. His most famous book is probably &quot;Season of the Jew&quot; (1987), which recounts the story of Te Kooti.

In the 1989 New Year Honours, Shadbolt was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to literature.

Shadbolt suffered from what was thought to be Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which during his autopsy was found to be Lewy body dementia. He died on 10 October 2004 in a Taumarunui rest home, surrounded by his children. Shadbolt had five children: Sean, Brendan and twins Tui and Daniel from his first marriage to journalist and author Gillian Heming, and Brigid from his second marriage to television presenter Barbara Magner. Shadbolt was also married to actress Bridget Armstrong. His cousin Tim Shadbolt was Mayor of Invercargill for nearly 20 years until 2022.

<text>Coquette is a 1929 American pre-Code drama film, starring Mary Pickford. The film was a box office success. For her role, Pickford won the second Academy Award for Best Actress.

==Plot==

Norma Besant, daughter of a Southern doctor, is an incorrigible flirt and has many suitors. Her father Dr. Besant (John St. Polis) favors Stanley (Matt Moore), who is taken with Norma. However Norma has met a simple man named Michael Jeffrey (Johnny Mack Brown) who she has fallen madly in love with. Dr. Besant disapproves of Michael and orders Norma to never see him again. Norma gives him their word, then promptly plans to marry Michael in 6 months, when he&#x27;s made &#x27;good in the hills&#x27; so he can buy her a home in the valley.

A few months pass and Michael sneaks down from the hills to see Norma at a Country Club dance. Wanting more time alone they sneak off to Michael&#x27;s mother&#x27;s cabin. According to Norma they made coffee and talked all night about the future. She returns home the next day at 4am. However someone has spotted the couple and begun to spread rumors around town destroying Norma&#x27;s reputation. Michael is furious and vows he will ask her father for her hand in marriage immediately.

Dr. Besant is furious and a heated verbal exchange takes place with Michael leaving, vowing to run away with Norma as soon as possible. Dr. Besant orders Norma to her room and leaves, pistol in hand. As Norma&#x27;s brother tries to distract her Stanley arrives, telling Norma that Michael was fatally wounded by her father.

Norma runs to Michael&#x27;s cabin where he dies in her arms. Dr. Besant&#x27;s lawyer friend arrives begging Norma to lie to the police to save her father&#x27;s life. Norma refuses, but later as the trial wears on she changes her mind. She takes the stand and lies about Michael, trying to save her father. Norma breaks down under cross examination and her father comes to comfort her on the witness stand. As he tells her she does not have to lie anymore, he spots the gun on the evidence table.

After comforting Norma, Dr. Besant approaches the bench and confesses his guilt, saying he has done wrong and is willing to pay the price. He then takes the gun and kills himself in front of the court. Later we see Stanley waiting for Norma, who has been in the judge&#x27;s chambers. He offers to walk her home, but Norma refuses, saying she would like to walk home alone.

== Production background ==
The film stars silent star Mary Pickford in her first talkie, Johnny Mack Brown in one of his earliest roles, John St. Polis, Matt Moore (Pickford&#x27;s ex brother in law), and Louise Beavers.

The film was adapted for the screen by John Grey, Allen McNeil and Sam Taylor from the play by George Abbott and Ann Preston Bridgers, and was directed by Sam Taylor. The play was based on real events in Richmond County, North Carolina and some dialog was used verbatim from court testimony. The play originally opened in New York City on November 8, 1927, with Helen Hayes in the title role.

Though a product of pre-Code Hollywood, the film was severely censored during scripting. In the play, the leading lady is pregnant and the story hinges on the fact that she carries the child of the man killed by her father. Her father murdered the man because he asked to marry the girl. But to save her father from disgrace when her pregnancy becomes apparent, she preemptively kills herself. Wrote Ernst and Lorentz, &quot;the censor conscious producer would not allow the movie to show the girl &quot;enceinte&quot;, thus destroying the whole plot.&quot;

William Cameron Menzies provided set decoration, or production design, with the film crediting him for &quot;settings&quot;. Cinematography was by Karl Struss.

The song &quot;Coquette&quot;, written by Johnny Green and Carmen Lombardo, has since become a jazz standard.

==Place in Pickford&#x27;s career==
Pickford had been one of the most popular stars in silent film. Her popularity had been steady since her debut in 1909. In 1916, she founded her own production company, taking control of every detail of her films. In 1919 along with Charlie Chaplin, her husband Douglas Fairbanks, and D. W. Griffith she founded United Artists, giving her complete control over her films.

Known for little-girl type roles such as &quot;Pollyanna&quot; (one of her highest-grossing films ever) Pickford had been trying to escape typecasting since 1923 with roles such as &quot;Rosita&quot;. However these films did not do as well as her child roles (though they were still successful at the box office), and Pickford had reverted to making films like &quot;Little Annie Rooney&quot; in 1925 and &quot;Sparrows&quot; in 1926. She tried an older role with her final silent film, &quot;My Best Girl&quot; in 1927 and, following the death of her mother in 1928, cut off her world-famous curls.

With the arrival of talkies Pickford immediately took to the new medium, being one of the first major stars to do so. At her Pickfair Studios she installed a sound stage in 1928, and began preparing for her first talkie. She bought the rights to &quot;Coquette&quot;, a play that Helen Hayes had made popular on the stage. &quot;Coquette&quot; is the story of a flirtatious southern girl who chooses to stand behind her father after he kills the man that she loves. Much like &quot;My Best Girl&quot; the role was adult, with Pickford portraying a flapper type for the first time. Sound technology was extremely touchy at the time, with footsteps or rattling jewelry ruining takes. Cameras could barely move, and were hidden behind glass so as to not interfere with the sound recording. Pickford employed the best technology possible, resulting in a film that had more natural movement and acting than other early talkies.

Despite Pickford&#x27;s embrace of the new medium it seems she was as concerned as everyone else about how her voice would record, despite the fact she had a stage career before entering film. After reviewing her first sound test she reportedly remarked, &quot;Why that sounds like a little pipsqueak voice!&quot; She immediately began intensive vocal lessons, hoping to accomplish a realistic Southern accent for the role.

Pickford became nervous during preparation, firing her sound man when a take wasn&#x27;t ready for her review on time. On set during an emotional scene, she notoriously fired her longtime cameraman and friend, Charles Rosher, when he yelled &quot;Cut!&quot; in the middle of one of her lines. She didn&#x27;t know at the time that a shadow had fallen across her face, as she was simply annoyed at being interrupted. Slightly embarrassed by her behavior and realizing she had been wrong, she wrote him a letter saying, &quot;Tragedy is an ugly mask. I don&#x27;t want to look like something on a candy box or a valentine.&quot;

==Release==

The film premiered in New York on April 5, 1929, at the Rivoli Theatre. A fuse blew rendering the film silent. It was rewound and shown again, this time with intermittent, bad sound. Finally technicians were able to fix the problem and the film began again for a third time.

Contemporary reviews were polite and warm. It was a box office success grossing $1.4 million. &quot;Coquette&quot; launched Pickford as a competent talkie star.

Complete prints of the film still exist. In the 1990s it was restored by the Library of Congress and The Mary Pickford Institute. Pickford&#x27;s estate no longer owns the rights as MGM (ironically parent company of UA) bought the film for a never-made remake. &quot;Coquette&quot; was released on home video by MGM/UA Home Video in the 1990s. It is one of two United Artists&#x27; films owned by Turner Entertainment as part of MGM&#x27;s pre-1986 library and distributed by Warner Bros., and has been released on DVD via Warner Archive Collection.

Pickford was a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, of which her husband would be the first president. She was one of only three female founding members.

The first Academy Awards were held in 1929, without any nominations for Pickford. She was nominated for Best Actress in 1930 for the 2nd Academy Awards. Many have accused Pickford of unfairly winning, using her clout and standing in the industry for an award of which she was unworthy. 
Pickford did lobby hard for the Oscar, inviting the judges over for tea at her home Pickfair. However her performance was critically and publicly acclaimed. Pickford would receive another Oscar in 1976, an honorary lifetime achievement award.

In 2008, a legal battle ensued between The and Buddy Rogers&#x27; heirs over the sale of the &quot;Coquette&quot; Oscar. The heirs were trying to sell the award for charity, as stipulated in Rogers&#x27;s second wife&#x27;s will. The insisted that the Award must be offered back to them for $1, to comply with a rule made long after Pickford won her Oscar. They claimed that when she won her honorary Oscar in the 1970s she signed a contract covering the &quot;Coquette&quot; statuette as well. The heirs argued that it might not have even been her signature, as Pickford was frail at the end of her life.

The won the legal battle, but announced they were willing to pursue a private agreement with the heirs. The outcome of this agreement is unknown.

<text>Monona Terrace (officially the Monona Terrace Community and Convention Center) is a convention center on the shores of Lake Monona in Madison, Wisconsin.

==Controversy==

The building was originally designed and proposed by Wisconsin native Frank Lloyd Wright in 1938. The county board rejected the plan by a single vote. Wright would continue to seek support for the plan (and alter its design) until his death in 1959.

For the next four decades, various proposals for a convention center on the Monona Terrace land would be considered and rejected. Several times, it appeared that supporters of the project would be able to secure the public financing to complete the project, but various forces (such as the start of World War II) inevitably sidelined the plan. In 1990, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin resurrected Wright&#x27;s proposal. Among the arguments against its construction, opponents argued that it was not a genuine Wright building, that the costs were too steep for the tax payers to bear and that the construction would adversely affect the environment, specifically destroying the view of Lake Monona from street level on the south side of the Capitol Square. Additionally, the site of the land stands on historic Ho-Chunk Nation burial mounds. The proposed construction was put to a public referendum in 1992 and it passed. Construction began two years later.

In 1997, nearly sixty years after Wright&#x27;s original conception, Monona Terrace Community and Convention Center opened its doors.

==Location==
Monona Terrace is located two blocks from the Wisconsin State Capitol building in downtown Madison.

From the roof of Monona Terrace, one can see views of downtown Madison, including the Capitol and a panoramic view of Lake Monona.

==Development==

Wright made several alterations to the design of Monona Terrace during his lifetime. Although the exterior design is Wright&#x27;s, the interior as executed was designed by former Wright apprentice Anthony Puttnam of Taliesin Associated Architects.

The building was constructed by J.H. Findorff and Son Inc., a southern Wisconsin contractor.

==Facilities==

The facility hosts over 600 conventions, meetings and weddings each year that result in an average of $52 million in economic activity for the region. Monona Terrace also runs free community programs that serve approximately 56,000 people each year. Monona Terrace also offers guided tours, a gift shop, a rooftop cafe (warm weather months only), and serves as the home for some of the community&#x27;s events including the national radio variety show Michael Feldman&#x27;s Whad&#x27;Ya Know?, Dane Dances, Ironman Wisconsin, and U.S. Bank Eve.

<doc id="172010" wikidata="Q7441899" url="?curid=172010" title="Season of the Jew">
<text>Season of the Jew is an historical novel by Maurice Shadbolt, published in 1987. Set in mid-nineteenth-century New Zealand, it is a semi-fictionalized account of the story of the Māori leader Te Kooti, told from the perspective of one of his pursuers, an officer in the colonial army.

==Explanation of the title==
The brief preface quotes Shakespeare&#x27;s Shylock: “If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his suffrance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me I will execute; and it shall go hard, but I will better the instruction.” This lays the moral ground for the resistance of the band of New Zealand natives under their leader Te Kooti, who synthesized a new religion from Christian and Māori traditions combined with his study of the Old Testament. His unique contribution was to declare his followers the latter-day embodiment of the Israelites escaping from Egypt. In the novel the rebels are often simply referred to as “the Jews.” The religion Te Kooti created, the Ringatu Church, still claims around 15,000 adherents in New Zealand today.

==Plot summary==
In this story of New Zealand and Te Kooti&#x27;s War during the year beginning November 10, 1868, the narrative coalesces around the development of its protagonist, George Fairweather, who in Shadbolt&#x27;s historical epilogue is described as “A composite character ... yet still far from fictional.” Fairweather is a competent but cynical former British officer in his early forties, who leaves the service under a cloud, turns landscape painter and cultivates an air of worldly detachment. Yet he finds himself drawn by love and humanity back into the world of colonial New Zealand and the maelstrom of the New Zealand Wars, is not altogether disagreeable, as he finds to his surprise.

Pursuing Te Kooti as an officer and commander in the colonial militia, while perfecting his ability to destroy Te Kooti&#x27;s rebellious “Jews” Fairweather paradoxically finds his feelings of humanity expanding to include Englishmen, colonials and Māoris, coupled with a growing resentment of racism and injustice. In the end, he almost throws his future away by struggling to save a Māori boy, Hamiora, who, like Melville&#x27;s Billy Budd, was unjustly charged with treason.

With the hanging of Hamiora, November 10, 1869, and the conclusion of Fairweather&#x27;s desperate attempts first to prevent and then to mitigate it, the book ends. The problem of Te Kooti is not resolved, except in the brief epilogue, further revealing the depths of Fairweather&#x27;s (and Shadbolt&#x27;s) ambivalence about the historical figure of Te Kooti, Fairweather&#x27;s hated and admired nemesis and one-time friend.

==Awards and nominations==
In 1987, the book received the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Award, a now-defunct national New Zealand book award, and forerunner of the current Montana New Zealand Book Awards.

<doc id="172011" wikidata="Q287713" url="?curid=172011" title="Ruth Chatterton">
<text>Ruth Chatterton (December 24, 1892 – November 24, 1961) was an American stage, film, and television actress, aviator and novelist. She was at her most popular in the early to mid-1930s, and in the same era gained prominence as an aviator, one of the few female pilots in the United States at the time. In the late 1930s, Chatterton retired from film acting but continued her career on the stage. She had several TV roles beginning in the late 1940s and became a successful novelist in the 1950s. 

==Early life==
Chatterton was born in New York City on December 24, 1892 to Walter, an architect, and Lillian (née Reed) Chatterton. She was of English and French extraction. Her parents separated while she was young. Chatterton attended Mrs. Hagen&#x27;s School in Pelham, New York.

In 1908, Chatterton and her friends were attending a play in Washington, D.C. Chatterton later criticized the acting of the lead actress to her friends, who challenged her to become a stage actress herself or &quot;shut up&quot;. Chatterton accepted the challenge, and a few days later, joined the chorus of the stage show. She soon dropped out of school to pursue a stage career. Aged 16, Chatterton joined the Friend Stock Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she remained for six months.

==Career==

In 1911, Chatterton made her Broadway stage debut in &quot;The Great Name&quot;. Her greatest success onstage came in 1914, when she starred in the play &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot;, adapted from the novel by Jean Webster.

Chatterton married her first husband, actor Ralph Forbes, on December 19, 1924, in Manhattan. They moved to Los Angeles. With the help of Emil Jannings, she was cast in her first film role in &quot;Sins of the Fathers&quot; in 1928. That same year, she was signed to a contract by Paramount Pictures. Chatterton&#x27;s first film for Paramount was also her first sound film, &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Secret&quot;, released in 1929. Chatterton was able to make the transition from silents to sound because of her stage experience.

Later in 1929, Chatterton was loaned to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where she starred in &quot;Madame X&quot;. The film was a critical and box-office success, and effectively launched Chatterton&#x27;s career. For her work in the film, Chatterton received her first nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. The following year, she starred in &quot;Sarah and Son&quot;, portraying an impoverished housewife who rises to fame and fortune as an opera singer. The film was another critical and financial success, and Chatterton received a second Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Later that year, Chatterton was voted the second female star of the year, behind only Norma Shearer, in a poll conducted by the West Coast film exhibitors.
In 1933, Chatterton starred in the successful Pre-Code comedy-drama &quot;Female&quot;, in which she plays the head of an automobile factory who uses handsome men in her employ for sex and then drops them. When she left Paramount Pictures, her initial home studio, for Warner Bros., along with Kay Francis and William Powell, the brothers Warner were said to then need an infusion of &quot;class&quot;. Chatterton&#x27;s last picture for Warner Brothers was the 1934 drama &quot;Journal of a Crime&quot;, co-starring Adolphe Menjou and Claire Dodd. In this late pre-Coder, Chatterton plays a jealous wife who murders her husband&#x27;s mistress. Chatterton is well-remembered for the types of roles that came to an end with implementation of the Production Code in July 1934, but she went on to co-star in the film &quot;Dodsworth&quot; (1936), for Samuel Goldwyn. This is widely regarded as her finest film, with what many considered an Oscar-worthy performance, although she was not nominated. Due to her age and the studios&#x27; focus on younger, more bankable stars, she moved to England and made only two more pictures, ending with &quot;A Royal Divorce&quot; (1938). She came back in 1948 to do television until 1953.

==Later years==
By 1938, Chatterton had tired of motion picture acting and retired from films. She moved back to the Eastern United States, where she lived with her third husband, Barry Thomson. In 1940 she returned to the Broadway stage to star in John Van Druten&#x27;s &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot;. She continued acting in Broadway productions and appeared in the London production of &quot;The Constant Wife&quot;, for which she received good reviews. Chatterton also raised French poodles and began a successful writing career. Her first novel, &quot;Homeward Borne&quot;, was published in 1950 and became a best seller. She went on to write three more novels: &quot;The Betrayers&quot; (1953), &quot;The Pride of the Peacock&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Southern Wild&quot; (1958).

In 1947 she narrated a four-sided 78 rpm disc set, &quot;The Revolt of the Alphabet&quot;, written by John Byrne, with music by Vladimir Selinsky.

Chatterton came out of retirement in the 1950s, and appeared on U.S. television in several plays, including a TV adaptation of &quot;Dodsworth&quot; on &quot;Prudential Playhouse&quot;, alongside Mary Astor and Walter Huston. Her last television appearance was as Gertrude in a 1953 adaptation of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, with Maurice Evans in the title role, on the anthology series &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;.

==Personal life==

===Flying===
Chatterton was one of the few woman aviators of her era, and was good friends with Amelia Earhart. She flew solo across the U.S. several times, and served as sponsor of the Sportsman Pilot Mixed Air Derby and the annual Ruth Chatterton Air Derby during the 1930s; she also opened the National Air Races in Los Angeles in 1936.
She taught British film and stage actor Brian Aherne to fly, an experience he described at length in his 1969 autobiography &quot;A Proper Job&quot;.

===Marriages===
Chatterton was married three times and had no children. In 1924, she married British actor Ralph Forbes, who starred opposite her that same year in &quot;The Magnolia Lady&quot;, a musical version of the A.E. Thomas and Alice Duer Miller hit &quot;Come Out of the Kitchen&quot;. Their divorce was finalized on August 12, 1932. The following day, August 13, Chatterton married George Brent, her &quot;The Rich Are Always with Us&quot; and &quot;The Crash&quot; co-star, in Harrison, New York. The couple separated in March 1934 and were divorced in October 1934.

Chatterton married actor Barry Thomson in 1942. They remained married until his death in 1960.

==Death==

After the death of her third husband in 1960, Chatterton lived alone in the home they shared in Redding, Connecticut. On November 21, 1961, she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while friends were visiting her home. She was taken to Norwalk Hospital in Norwalk, Connecticut, where she died on November 24, aged 68. She was cremated and is interred in a niche in the Lugar Mausoleum (Section 11, Lot 303) at Beechwoods Cemetery in New Rochelle, New York.

==Honors==
For her contribution to the motion-picture industry, Ruth Chatterton has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6263 Hollywood Blvd. She is also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.

<doc id="172013" wikidata="Q315647" url="?curid=172013" title="David Alfaro Siqueiros">
<text>David Alfaro Siqueiros (born José de Jesús Alfaro Siqueiros; December 29, 1896 – January 6, 1974) was a Mexican social realist painter, best known for his large public murals using the latest in equipment, materials and technique. Along with Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, he was one of the most famous of the &quot;Mexican muralists&quot;. 

Siqueiros was a member of the Mexican Communist Party. Although he went to Spain to support the Spanish Republic against the forces of Francisco Franco with his art, he volunteered and served in frontline combat as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army of the Republic through 1938 before returning to Mexico City. In 1940, he led a failed assassination attempt on Leon Trotsky in which Trotsky&#x27;s 14-year-old grandson was shot and American communist Robert Sheldon Harte was executed. After spending several months on the run from Mexican authorities disguised as a peasant, Siqueiros was eventually apprehended in Jalisco, although he would never be brought to trial and was freed shortly.

By accordance with Spanish naming customs, his surname would normally have been &quot;Alfaro&quot;; however, like Picasso (Pablo Ruiz y Picasso) and Lorca (Federico García Lorca), Siqueiros used his mother&#x27;s surname. It was long believed that he was born in Camargo in Chihuahua state, but in 2003 it was proven that he was born in the city of Chihuahua after the discovery of his birth certificate, but grew up in Irapuato, Guanajuato, at least from the age of six. According to Victor Mendoza Magallanes, he was born in Santa Rosalia in modern-day Camargo, Chihuahua. One source says that the discovery of his birth certificate in 2003 was who was renowned as the leading authority on Mexican Muralism and who had been a close acquaintance of Siqueiros, although there hasn&#x27;t been any evidence to prove this. Siqueiros changed his given name to &quot;David&quot; after his first wife called him by it in allusion to Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;.

==Early life==
Many details of Siqueiros&#x27;s childhood, including birth date, birthplace, first name and where he grew up, were misstated during his life and long after his death, in some cases by himself. Multiple sources have stated he was born in Santa Rosalia in modern day Camargo, Chihuahua and Mexico City, but it has been confirmed in 2003 he was born in the Chihuahua City with the discovery of his birth certificate. 

Siqueiros was born in 1896, the second of three children. He was baptized José de Jesús Alfaro Siqueiros. His father, Cipriano Alfaro, originally from Irapuato, was well-off. His mother was Teresa Siqueiros. Siqueiros had two siblings: a sister, Luz, three years elder, and a brother &quot;Chucho&quot; (Jesús), a year younger. David&#x27;s mother died when he was four and their father sent the children to live with their paternal grandparents. David&#x27;s grandfather, nicknamed &quot;Siete Filos&quot; (&#x27;seven knife-edges&#x27;), had an especially strong role in his upbringing. In 1902, Siqueiros started school in Irapuato, Guanajuato.

He credits his first rebellious influence to his sister, who had resisted their father&#x27;s religious orthodoxy. Around this time, Siqueiros was also exposed to new political ideas, mainly along the lines of anarcho-syndicalism. One such political theorist was Dr. Atl, who published a manifesto in 1906 calling for Mexican artists to develop a national art and look to ancient indigenous cultures for inspiration. In 1911, at the age of fifteen, Siqueiros was involved in a student strike at the Academy of San Carlos of the National Academy of Fine Arts that protested the school&#x27;s teaching methodology and urged the impeachment of the school&#x27;s director. Their protests eventually led to the establishment of an &quot;open-air academy&quot; in .

At the age of eighteen, Siqueiros and several of his colleagues from the School of Fine Arts joined Venustiano Carranza&#x27;s Constitutional Army fighting the government of President Victoriano Huerta. When Huerta fell in 1914, Siqueiros became enmeshed in the &quot;post-revolutionary&quot; infighting, as the Constitutional Army battled the diverse political factions of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata for control. His military travels around the country exposed him to Mexican culture and the raw, everyday struggles of the working and rural poor classes. After Carranza&#x27;s forces had gained control, Siqueiros briefly returned to Mexico City to paint before traveling to Europe in 1919. First in Paris, he absorbed the influence of cubism, intrigued particularly with Paul Cézanne and the use of large blocks of intense color. While there, he also met Diego Rivera, another Mexican painter of &quot;the Big Three&quot; on the brink of a legendary career in muralism, and he traveled to Italy to study the great fresco painters of the Renaissance. In Barcelona he published a magazine, La vida Americana, in which he issued a manifesto to the artists of America to reject the decadent influence of Europe and create a new form of public art with the latest tools and technology.

==Early art and politics==
Although many have said that Siqueiros&#x27; artistic ventures were frequently &quot;interrupted&quot; by political ones, Siqueiros himself believed the two were intricately intertwined. By 1921, when he wrote his manifesto in &quot;Vida Americana&quot;, Siqueiros had already been exposed to Marxism and seen the life of the working and rural poor while traveling with the Constitutional Army. In &quot;A New Direction for the New Generation of American Painters and Sculptors&quot;, he called for a &quot;spiritual renewal&quot; to simultaneously bring back the virtues of classical painting while infusing this style with &quot;new values&quot; that acknowledged the &quot;modern machine&quot; and the &quot;contemporary aspects of daily life&quot;. The manifesto also claimed that a &quot;constructive spirit&quot; is essential to meaningful art, which rises above mere decoration or false, fantastical themes. Through this style, Siqueiros hoped to create a style that would bridge national and universal art. In his work, as well as his writing, Siqueiros sought a social realism that hailed the proletariat peoples of Mexico and the world, even as it attempted to avoid the widespread clichés of &quot;Primitivism&quot; and &quot;Indianism&quot;.
In 1922, Siqueiros returned to Mexico City to work as a muralist for Álvaro Obregón&#x27;s revolutionary government. The then Secretary of Public Education, José Vasconcelos, made a mission of educating the masses through public art, and hired scores of artists and writers to build a modern Mexican culture. Siqueiros, Rivera and Orozco worked together under Vasconcelos, who supported the muralist movement by commissioning murals for prominent buildings in Mexico City. Still, the artists working at the Preparatoria realized that many of their early works lacked the &quot;public&quot; nature envisioned in their ideology. In 1923 Siqueiros helped found the Syndicate of Revolutionary Mexican Painters, Sculptors and Engravers, which addressed the problem of public access to art through its paper, &quot;El Machete&quot;. That year Siqueiros helped author a manifesto in the newspaper &quot;for the proletariat of the world&quot;. It addressed the necessity of &quot;collective&quot; art, which would serve as &quot;ideological propaganda&quot; to educate the masses and overcome bourgeois, individualist art.

Soon after, Siqueiros painted his famous mural &quot;Burial of a Worker&quot; (1923) in the stairwell of the Colegio Chico. The fresco features a group of pre-Conquest style workers in a funeral procession that are carrying a giant coffin, decorated with a hammer and sickle. The mural was never finished and was vandalized by students at the school who did not agree with the work&#x27;s overtly political subject matter. Eventually, the entire mural was whitewashed by the new Minister of Education who succeeded Vasconcelos. The Syndicate became ever more critical of the revolutionary government, due to the State&#x27;s failure to deliver on promised reforms. As a result, its members faced new threats to cut funding for their art and the newspaper. A feud within the Syndicate—regarding a choice between publishing &quot;El Machete&quot; or losing financial support for mural projects—led to Siqueiros moving to the forefront of the organization, when Rivera left in protest over the decision to prioritize politics over art. Despite being dismissed from a post at the Department of Education in 1925, Siqueiros remained deeply involved in labor activities, in the Syndicate as well as the Mexican Communist Party, until he was jailed and eventually exiled in the early 1930s.
After spending many years in Mexico and being heavily involved in radical political activities, Siqueiros went to Los Angeles, California in 1932 to continue his career as a muralist. Working in a collective unit that experimented with new painting techniques using modern devices such as airbrushes, spray guns and projectors, Siqueiros and his team of collaborators painted two major murals. The first, entitled &quot;Street Meeting&quot;, was commissioned for the Chouinard School of Art. It depicts a group of workers of mixed ethnicities listening to an angry labor agitator&#x27;s speech during a break in the workday. The mural was washed over within a year of its unveilingdue to weather-related issues, and perhaps the Communist content of the work. Siqueiros&#x27; other significant Los Angeles mural, &quot;Tropical America&quot; (full name: &quot;América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos&quot;, or &quot;Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism&quot;), was commissioned shortly after the unveiling of &quot;Street Meeting&quot;, and was to be painted on the exterior wall of the Plaza Art Center that faced the busy Olvera Street. &quot;Tropical America&quot; depicts American imperialism in Latin America, a much more radical theme than was intended for the work. Although it received generally favorable criticism, some viewed it as Communist propaganda, which led to a partial covering in 1934 and a total whitewash in 1938. Eighty years later, the Getty Conservation Institute performed restoration work on the mural. As no color photographs of &quot;Tropical America&quot; are known to exist, conservators used scientific analysis and best practices to get at the artist&#x27;s vision of the mural. It became accessible to the public on its 80th anniversary, October 9, 2012. The América Tropical Interpretive Center that opened nearby is dedicated to the life and legacy of David Alfaro Siqueiros.

==Artistic career==
In the early 1930s, including his time spent in Lecumberri Prison, Siqueiros produced a series of politically themed lithographs, many of which were exhibited in the United States. His lithograph &quot;Head&quot; was shown at the 1930 exhibition &quot;Mexican Artists and Artists of the Mexican School&quot; at The Delphic Studios in New York City. In 1932, he led an exhibition and conference entitled &quot;Rectifications on Mexican Muralism&quot; at the gallery of the Spanish Casino in Taxco, Guerrero. Shortly after, he traveled to New York, where he participated in the Weyhe Gallery&#x27;s &quot;Mexican Graphic Art&quot; exhibition. Also in 1932, Nelbert Chouinard invited Siqueiros to Los Angeles to conduct mural workshops. It was at this time that, with a team of students, he also completed &quot;Tropical America&quot; in 1932, at the Italian Hall at Olvera Street in Los Angeles. Painting fresco on an outside wall – visible to passersby as well as intentional viewers – forced Siqueiros to reconsider his methodology as a muralist. He wanted the image – an Indian peon being crucified by American oppression – to be accessible from multiple angles. Instead of just constructing &quot;an enlarged easel painting&quot;, he realized that the mural &quot;must conform to the normal transit of a spectator.&quot; Eventually, Siqueiros would develop a mural technique that involved tracing figures onto a wall with an electric projector, photographing early wall sketches to improve perspective, and new paints, spray guns, and other tools to accommodate the surface of modern buildings and the outdoor conditions. He was unceremoniously deported from the United States for political activity the same year.
Back in New York in 1936, he was the guest of honor at the &quot;Contemporary Arts&quot; exhibition at the St. Regis gallery. There he also ran a political art workshop in preparation for the 1936 General Strike for Peace and May Day parade. The young Jackson Pollock attended the workshop and helped build floats for the parade. In fact, Siquieros has been credited with teaching drip and pour techniques to Pollock that later resulted in his all-over paintings, made from 1947 to 1950, and which constitute Pollock&#x27;s greatest achievement. In addition to floats, the Siqueiros Experimental Workshop produced a variety of posters and other ephemeral works for the CPUSA and other anti-fascist organizations in New York. These ephemeral works possessed the ability to reach the masses in a way different from mural painting because they were accessible to a wide audience outside of an institution or gallery. The Siqueiros Experimental Workshop only lasted for a little over a year until Siqueiros went to fight in the Spanish Civil War in April 1937, but their floats were featured in both the 1936 and 1937 May Day Parades in Manhattan&#x27;s garment district.

Continuing to produce several works throughout the late 1930s – such as &quot;Echo of a Scream&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Sob&quot; (1939), both now at the Museum of Modern Art in New York . Although he went to Spain to support the Spanish Republic against the fascist forces of Francisco Franco with his art, he volunteered and served in frontline combat as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army of the Republic through 1938 before returning to Mexico City. After his return, in a stairwell of the &quot;Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas&quot;, Siqueiros collaborated with Spanish refugee Josep Renau and the International Team of Plastic Artists to develop one of his most famous works, &quot;Portrait of the Bourgeoisie&quot;, warning against the dual foes of capitalism and fascism. The original mural, painted in the stairwell of the electrical worker&#x27;s union, incorporated cameras, photomontage, spray guns, airbrushes, stencils and the latest paints. It shows a giant generator using the opposition of fascist and capitalist democracies to generate imperialism and war. An armed, brave-faced revolutionary, of unnamable class or ethnicity, confronts the machine, and a blue sky on the ceiling flanked by electrical towers displays hope for the proletariat in technological and industrial advances.

American-born poet and eventual fellow Spanish Civil War participant Edwin Rolfe was a great admirer of Siqueiros&#x27;s &quot;ability to function&quot; as &quot;artist and revolutionary&quot;. His 1934 poem &quot;Room with Revolutionists&quot; is based on a conversation between ″New Masses″ editor, poet, and Left journalist Joseph Freeman (1897–1965) and Siqueiros; in it, Siqueiros is described as &quot;a revolutionist / a painter of great areas, editor / of fiery and terrifying words, leader / of the poor who plant, the poor who burrow / under the earth in field and mine. / His life&#x27;s an always upward-delving battle in / an old torn sweater, the pockets always empty.&quot;

==Attempted assassination of Leon Trotsky==
Before the mural&#x27;s completion in 1940, however, Siqueiros was forced into hiding and later exiled for his direct involvement in an attempt to assassinate Leon Trotsky, then in exile in Mexico City from the Soviet Union:

President Lázaro Cárdenas had given Leon Trotsky and his wife, Natalia Sedova, political asylum after fleeing Stalinist persecution. They were able to enter the country thanks to the request that Ana Brenner made to Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo to intervene on their behalf. Trotsky&#x27;s arrival in Mexico as a political asylee infuriated the Spanish Republicans, allies of the Soviet Union, who complained to the Mexican fighters--among them Siqueiros--about their government&#x27;s decision to accept Trotsky.

 Trotsky&#x27;s 14-year-old grandson was shot, yet survived. Following the attack, police found a shallow grave on the road to the Desierto de los Leones with the body of New York Communist Robert Sheldon Harte, executed by one shot to the head. He had been one of Trotsky&#x27;s bodyguards. The theory that Sheldon was a Soviet agent who had infiltrated Trotsky&#x27;s entourage, aiding in Siqueiros&#x27; attack by allowing the hit squad to enter Trotsky&#x27;s compound, was discounted by Trotsky and later historians. Siqueiros&#x27;s colleague Josep Renau completed the SME mural, transforming the generator into a machine that converts the blood of workers into coins.

Siqueiros was located by the police in a property supposedly rented by Angelica and Luis Arenal (Siqueiros&#x27;s wife and brother-in-law respectively) in the outskirts of the capital. Siqueiros fled to Guadalajara, hiding in the house of his old friend José Guadalupe Zuno and from there he moved to the mountain town of Hostotipaquillo. Together with Angélia Arenal, he hid disguised as a peasant under the name of Macario Huízar. The Jalisco police apprehended Siqueiros and he was taken back Mexico City. He was formally processed and declared prisoner in the Lecumberri Preventive Prison. Siqueiros was charged for attempted homicide, criminal association, improper use of uniform, usurpation of functions, breaking and entering, firing a firearm and robbery.

Despite Siqueiros&#x27;s participation in these events, he never stood trial and was given permission to leave the country to paint a mural in Chile, arranged by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. In a school library in the town of Chillán, he organized a team of artists to paint a mural which combined the heroic figures of Mexico and Chile in &quot;Death to the Invader.&quot;

Hoping to revisit the United States and contribute to the struggle against fascism, he was denied entry and went to Cuba where he painted three murals, &quot;Allegory of Racial Equality and Fraternity in Cuba,&quot; &quot;New Day of the Democracies&quot; and &quot;Two Mountains of America, Marti and Lincoln.&quot;

==Later life and works==

In 1948, Siqueiros was invited to teach a course on mural painting at an art academy in San Miguel Allende. Although he was barred from the United States, most of the students were American GIs who were being paid to study under him. Practicing his idea of learning art by working with a master artist on a mural project, he planned a mural in a colonial building recognizing the legacy of Miguel Allende, one of Mexico&#x27;s leaders of the struggle for independence. The mural was never completed, due to legal procedures against the owner of the art academy. Based on this experience, he later wrote a book titled &quot;Como se pinta un mural&quot;.

Siqueiros participated in the first ever Mexican contingent at the XXV Venice Biennale exhibition with Orozco, Rivera and Tamayo in 1950, and he received the second prize for all exhibitors, which recognized the international status of Mexican art. Yet by the 1950s, Siqueiros returned to accepting commissions from what he considered a &quot;progressive&quot; Mexican state, rather than painting for galleries or private patrons. He constructed an outdoor mural entitled &quot;The People to the University, the University to the People&quot; at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City in 1952. It was a combination of mural painting, bas-relief sculpture and Italian mosaic. In 1957 he began work on government commission for Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City; &quot;Del porfirismo a la Revolución&quot; was his biggest mural yet. (The painting is known in English as &quot;From the Dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz to the Revolution&quot; or &quot;The Revolution Against the Porfirian Dictatorship&quot;.)

In the lobby of the Hospital de la Raza in Mexico City, he created a revolutionary multi-angular mural using new materials and techniques, &quot;For the Social Welfare of all Mexicans&quot;. After painting &quot;Man the Master and Not the Slave of Technology&quot; on a concave aluminum panel in the lobby of the Polytechnic Institute, he painted &quot;The Apology for the Future Victory of Science over Cancer&quot; on panels that wrap around the lobby of the cancer center.

Yet near the end of the decade, his outspoken communist views alienated him from the government. Under pressure from the government, the National Actors&#x27; Association, which had commissioned a mural on the theater in Mexico suspended his work on &quot;The History of Theater in Mexico&quot; at the Jorge Negrete Theater and sued him for breach of contract in 1958.

Siqueiros was eventually arrested in 1960 for openly criticizing the President of Mexico, Adolfo López Mateos, and leading protests against the arrests of striking workers and teachers, though the charges were commonly known to be false. Numerous protests ensued, even including an appeal advertisement by well-known artists and writers in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1961. Unjustly imprisoned, Siqueiros continued to paint, and his works continued to sell. During that stay, he would make numerous sketches for the project of decorating the Hotel Casino de la Selva, owned by Manuel Suarez y Suarez. After international pressure was put on the Mexican authorities, Siqueiros was finally pardoned and released in the spring of 1964. He immediately resumed working on his suspended murals in the Actors&#x27; Union and Chapultepec Castle.

When the mural planned for the Hotel de la Selva in Cuernavaca was moved to Mexico City and expanded, he assembled a team of national and international artists to work on the panels in his workshop in Cuernavaca. This project, his last major mural, is the largest mural ever painted, an integrated structure combining architecture, in which the building was designed as a mural, with mural painting and polychromed sculpture. Known as the Polyforum Siqueiros, the exterior consists of 12 panels of sculpture and painting while the walls and ceiling of the interior are covered with &quot;The March of Humanity on Earth and Toward the Cosmos&quot;. Completed in 1971 after years of extension and delay, the mural broke from some previous stylistic mandates, if only by its complex message. Known for making art that was easily read by the public, especially the lower classes, Siqueiros&#x27; message in &quot;The March&quot; is more difficult to decipher, though it seems to fuse two visions of human progress, one international and one based in Mexican heritage. The mural&#x27;s placement at a ritzy hotel and commission by its millionaire owner also seems to challenge Siqueiros&#x27; anti-capitalist ideology.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Death ==
Siqueiros died in Cuernavaca, Morelos, on January 6, 1974, in the company of Angélica Arenal Bastar, who had been his partner since the Spanish civil war. His remains were interred at the Rotunda of Illustrious Persons. A few days before his death, he donated his house in Polanco to the Mexican state; since 1969, it had been used for Public Art Rooms and a Museum of Mural Painting Composition.

==Style==
As a muralist and an artist, Siqueiros believed art should be public, educational, and ideological. He painted mostly murals and other portraits of the revolution – its goals, its past, and the current oppression of the working classes. Because he was painting a story of human struggle to overcome authoritarianism, capitalist rule, he painted the everyday people ideally involved in this struggle. Though his pieces sometimes include landscapes or figures of Mexican history and mythology, these elements often appear as mere accessories to the story of a revolutionary hero or heroes (several works depict the revolutionary &quot;masses&quot;, such as the mural at Chapultepec).

His interest in the human form developed at the Academy in Mexico City. His accentuation of the angles of the body, its muscles and joints, can be seen throughout his career in his portrayal of the strong revolutionary body. In addition, many works, especially in the 1930s, prominently feature hands, which could be interpreted as another heroic symbol of proletarian strength through work: his self-portrait in prison (&quot;El Coronelazo&quot;, 1945, Museum of Modern Art, Mexico City), &quot;Our Present Image&quot; (1947, Museum of Modern Art, Mexico), &quot;New Democracy&quot; (1944, Palace of Fine Arts, Mexico City), and even his series on working class women, such as &quot;The Sob&quot;.

<doc id="172015" wikidata="Q1146214" url="?curid=172015" title="Tánaiste">
<text>The Tánaiste ( , ) is the second-ranking member of the government of Ireland and the holder of its second-most senior office. It is the equivalent of the deputy prime minister in other parliamentary systems.

The Tánaiste is appointed by the President of Ireland on the advice of the Taoiseach. The current office holder is Simon Harris, TD, who was appointed on 23 January 2025.

==History==
Under the Gaelic system of tanistry, the word (plural , , ) had been used for the heir of the chief () or king (). The word was adopted in the 1937 Constitution of Ireland as the title for a member of the government nominated by the Taoiseach to act in their place as needed during periods of the Taoiseach&#x27;s temporary absence. Tánaiste is the official title of the deputy head of government in both English and Irish, and is not used for other countries&#x27; deputy prime ministers, who are referred to in Irish by the generic term , , . The longer Irish form, , is sometimes used in English instead of &quot;the Tánaiste&quot;.

==Overview==
The office was created in 1937 under the new Constitution of Ireland and replaced the previous office of Vice-President of the Executive Council, which had existed under the Constitution of the Irish Free State, and which was first held by Kevin O&#x27;Higgins of Cumann na nGaedheal from 1922 to 1927.

The Taoiseach nominates one member of the Government to the office who is required to be a member of Dáil Éireann. The nominee then receives their seal of office from the President of Ireland in recognition of the appointment. The Tánaiste acts in the place of the Taoiseach during a temporary absence. In the event of the Taoiseach&#x27;s death or permanent incapacitation, the Tánaiste acts as Taoiseach until another is appointed. The Tánaiste is, , a member of the Council of State. The Tánaiste chairs meetings of the government in the absence of the Taoiseach and may take questions on their behalf in the Dáil or Seanad.

Aside from those duties, the title is largely honorific as the Constitution does not confer any additional powers on the office holder over and above the other members of the Government. In theory, the Tánaiste could be a minister without portfolio, but every Tánaiste has in parallel held a ministerial portfolio as head of a Department of State. The Department of the Taoiseach is a Department of State, but there is no equivalent for the Tánaiste. Dick Spring in the Rainbow Coalition (1994–1997) had an official &quot;Office of the Tánaiste&quot;, but other parties have not used that nomenclature. Under Spring, Eithne Fitzgerald was &quot;Minister of State at the Office of the Tánaiste&quot;, with responsibility for co-ordinating Labour policy in the coalition.

Under a coalition government, the Tánaiste is typically the leader of the second-largest coalition partner, just as the Taoiseach is usually leader of the coalition&#x27;s senior partner. However, during the coalition governments in 1989–1992 and 2007–2011, the position was held by Fianna Fáil&#x27;s deputy leader, rather than the leader of a junior partner. As part of a rotating Taoiseach agreement since 2020, the role of Tánaiste gained increased prominence and responsibility in coordinating and Government policy as it was held by Leo Varadkar for the first half of the Government&#x27;s term in office prior to his appointment as Taoiseach and Micheál Martin in the second half.

The office of Tánaiste is as yet the highest government rank attained by a woman Minister.

Four Tánaistí later held the office of Taoiseach: Seán Lemass, Bertie Ahern, Brian Cowen, and Leo Varadkar (his second term as Taoiseach). Varadkar is also one of three Tánaistí, with Micheál Martin and Simon Harris, to have previously held the office of Taoiseach before becoming Tánaiste. Two Tánaistí were later elected as President of Ireland: Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly and Erskine H. Childers.

This is a graphical lifespan timeline of Tánaistí. They are listed in order of office (Lemass, Norton, and Spring are shown in order of their first terms).

She is the younger daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah, Duchess of York. She is a niece of King Charles III. At birth, she was 6th in the line of succession to the British throne and is now 12th. She is the younger sister of Princess Beatrice.

Born in Portland Hospital, London, Eugenie attended St George&#x27;s School and Marlborough College before studying at Newcastle University, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English Literature and History of Art. She joined the auction house Paddle8 before taking a directing position at art gallery Hauser &amp; Wirth. Eugenie also works privately with a number of charitable organisations, including Children in Crisis and Anti-Slavery International.

Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank, a British marketing executive, were married in 2018. The couple have two sons, August and Ernest.

==Early life==
Eugenie was born by Caesarean section at Portland Hospital in the West End of London on 23 March 1990, the second child of the Duke and Duchess of York, and sixth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

She was baptised Eugenie Victoria Helena at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, by Peter Nott, Bishop of Norwich, on 23 December 1990. She was the first royal baby to have a public christening and the only one of the Queen&#x27;s grandchildren not to be baptised in the Lily Font.

Eugenie&#x27;s parents divorced when she was six years old. The Duke and Duchess of York had agreed to joint custody of their two children. After the divorce, the Queen provided her parents with £1.4 million to set up a trust fund for her and Beatrice. Eugenie and her sister frequently travelled abroad with one or both of their parents.

In October 2002, the 12-year-old Eugenie underwent back surgery at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in London to correct scoliosis; two titanium rods were put in her back. After the operation the princess was not required to undergo any further spinal surgeries.

==Education and career==
Eugenie began her schooling at Winkfield Montessori from 1992 to 1993. From there, she joined her sister at Upton House School in Windsor until 1995. She attended Coworth Park School (now Coworth Flexlands School) from 1995 to 2001, and then St George&#x27;s School, near Windsor Castle until 2003. For the next five years, Eugenie boarded at Marlborough College in Wiltshire. She achieved three A-Levels: an &#x27;A&#x27; in Art, an &#x27;A&#x27; in English Literature, and a &#x27;B&#x27; in History of Art. She undertook a gap year before continuing her education in 2009.

Eugenie began studying at Newcastle University in September 2009. She graduated in 2012 with a 2:1 degree in English Literature and History of Art.

In 2013, she moved to New York City for one year to work for the online auction firm Paddle8 as a benefit auctions manager. In July 2015, she moved back to London to work for the Hauser &amp; Wirth art gallery as an associate director and was promoted to director in 2017.

Speaking on Channel 5 documentary &quot;Beatrice and Eugenie: Pampered Princesses&quot;, royal commentator Richard Kay claimed Eugenie enjoyed taxpayer-funded security when she travelled the world during her gap year. In January 2022, it was reported that Eugenie had lost her taxpayer-funded police security in 2011, supposedly after her uncle Charles III (then Prince of Wales) intervened.

In July 2023, Eugenie joined the advisory board of Goals House, a community aimed at making progress towards UN&#x27;s sustainable development goals.

==Marriage and family==

The Duke of York&#x27;s Office at Buckingham Palace announced the engagement of Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank on 22 January 2018. The couple had been dating for seven years, and were introduced by friends in a ski break in Verbier, Switzerland, where Brooksbank was working. They were engaged on vacation in Nicaragua. In April 2018, the couple moved from St James&#x27;s Palace and took up residence in Ivy Cottage at Kensington Palace. The wedding took place at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 12 October 2018. The wedding dress was designed by the British fashion designer Peter Pilotto and Belgian Christopher de Vos of British-based label Peter Pilotto, and was designed to display her surgical scar. Eugenie chose to show her scar to honour those that helped her, and to inspire others with the condition of scoliosis.

The Brooksbanks have two sons. The first, August Philip Hawke Brooksbank, was born on 9 February 2021 at the Portland Hospital in London, born by caesarean section due to his mother&#x27;s childhood scoliosis operation. At birth, he was eleventh in line to the throne and is now thirteenth. He is named after his great-grandfather Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and two of his five-times great-grandfathers: Reverend Edward Hawke Brooksbank, and Prince Albert, whose given names included &quot;Augustus&quot;. August was christened at the Royal Chapel of All Saints, Windsor Park, on 21 November 2021, alongside his second cousin, Lucas Tindall. Eugenie gave birth to a second son, Ernest George Ronnie Brooksbank, on 30 May 2023. He is named after his great-great-great-grandfather George V, whose third given name was Ernest, his grandfather George Brooksbank and his great-grandfather Major Ronald Ferguson. Ernest was born thirteenth in line to the throne and is now fourteenth.

From November 2020 to May 2022, the couple&#x27;s main residence was Frogmore Cottage, which was leased to Eugenie&#x27;s cousin Prince Harry. In May 2022, it was reported they had moved to Portugal, where Brooksbank works for Michael Meldman, and that they would once again stay at Ivy Cottage while in the UK.

==Activities==
Eugenie receives no allowance from the Privy Purse. She does, however, undertake occasional public engagements, which are usually connected with the charities she supports, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and Children in Crisis. In 2018, Children in Crisis merged with Street Child, a children&#x27;s charity active in multiple countries, with Eugenie still serving as an ambassador.

Eugenie and her sister represented their father at a service of thanksgiving for her aunt, Diana, Princess of Wales, in 2007. In 2008, she performed her first solo public engagement, opening a Teenage Cancer Trust&#x27;s unit for young cancer patients in Leeds.

On 2 June 2011, Eugenie visited the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) with her father as one of her first official engagements. In April 2012 she agreed to be patron for the hospital&#x27;s Redevelopment Appeal, which was her first patronage. In 2014, Eugenie re-opened the children&#x27;s unit at the RNOH. In 2014, she partnered with Daisy London Jewellery to create a limited edition charity bracelet to benefit the RNOH&#x27;s Appeal. Eugenie became patron of the RNOH Charity in March 2019. In the same year she was named patron of Horatio&#x27;s Garden, a charity that creates gardens for patients in NHS spinal injury centres.
In January 2013, Eugenie and her sister promoted Britain overseas in Germany. In 2016, Eugenie, along with her mother and sister, collaborated with British contemporary artist Teddy McDonald. The painting on canvas, titled Royal Love, was painted at Royal Lodge and exhibited in London prior to being sold with all proceeds from the sale of the painting donated by McDonald to the charity Children in Crisis. Eugenie and her sister became Patrons of the Teenage Cancer Trust in June 2016. She is also Patron of the Coronet Theatre, the European School of Osteopathy, the Tate Young Patrons and, alongside her mother, the Elephant Family, of which her uncle and aunt, the King and Queen, are joint presidents. In 2016, Eugenie visited a safe house run by The Salvation Army and met with victims of sexual abuse and modern slavery.

In 2017, Eugenie became the ambassador for the Artemis Council of the New Museum, a by-invitation membership initiative focused solely on supporting female artists. Eugenie also became an ambassador of Project 0 in 2018, a charity which in partnership with Sky Ocean Rescue, focuses on protecting the ocean from plastic pollution. In July 2018, in her capacity as co-founder and director of the Anti-Slavery Collective, Eugenie spoke at the NEXUS Global Summit at the UN headquarters in New York to discuss ending modern slavery. She and Julia de Boinville founded the collective in 2017 after a trip to Kolkata in 2012, where they first became familiar with the subject. In September 2018, she travelled to Serbia to visit ASTRA and ATINA, two grantees of the UN Trust Fund which fight against the issues of human trafficking and violence against women. In August 2019, it was announced that she would launch a podcast, the first member of the royal family to do so. Together with Julia de Boinville, co-founder of the Anti-Slavery Collective, they highlighted and discussed issues related to modern slavery. The first episode of the podcast, titled &quot;Floodlight&quot;, was released in April 2022. In July 2019, Princess Eugenie, with the help of the University of Hull&#x27;s Wilberforce Institute, hosted an event at Westminster Abbey to understand the scale of the plight of modern slavery. In October 2019, Eugenie became patron of Anti-Slavery International. In April 2019, Eugenie accompanied her grandmother to the Royal Maundy service at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

In May 2020, it was revealed that Eugenie and her husband were helping The Salvation Army with packing foods amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2020, Eugenie became patron of the Scoliosis Association UK. In June 2021, Princess Eugenie became an ambassador for the Blue Marine Foundation, and met with environmentalists at Somerset House. In October 2021, Princess Eugenie visited The Salvation Army&#x27;s outreach hub as part of her work with the Anti-Slavery Collective. She took part in an art therapy class alongside modern slavery survivors. In June 2022, Eugenie launched the &quot;Ocean Advocate Series&quot;, which features conversations with ocean advocates and experts on how to preserve the seas and the environment.

On 17 September 2022, during the period of official mourning for Queen Elizabeth II, Eugenie joined her sister and six cousins to mount a 15-minute vigil around the coffin of the late Queen, as it lay in state at Westminster Hall. On 19 September, she joined other family members at the state funeral.

<doc id="172019" wikidata="Q23362" url="?curid=172019" title="James Scullin">
<text>James Henry Scullin (18 September 1876 – 28 January 1953) was an Australian politician and trade unionist who served as the ninth prime minister of Australia from 1929 to 1932. He held office as the leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), having briefly served as treasurer of Australia during his time in office from 1930 to 1931. His time in office was primarily categorised by the Wall Street crash of 1929 which transpired just two days after his swearing in, thus heralding the beginning of the Great Depression in Australia. Scullin remained a leading figure in the Labor movement throughout his lifetime, and was an &quot;éminence grise&quot; in various capacities for the party until his retirement from federal parliament in 1949. He was the first Catholic, as well as the first Irish-Australian, to serve as prime minister.

The son of working-class Irish-immigrants, Scullin spent much of his early life as a laborer and grocer in Ballarat. An autodidact and passionate debater, Scullin made the most of Ballarat&#x27;s facilities – the public library and South Street Debating Society. He joined the Australian Labor Party in 1903, beginning a career spanning five decades. He was a political organizer and newspaper editor for the party, and was elected to the Australian House of Representatives first in 1910 and then again in 1922 until 1949. Scullin quickly established himself as a leading voice in parliament, rapidly rising to become deputy leader of the party in 1927 and then Leader of the Opposition in 1928.

After Scullin won a landslide election in 1929, events took a dramatic change with the crisis on Wall Street and the rapid onset of the Great Depression around the world, which hit heavily indebted Australia hard. Scullin and his Treasurer Ted Theodore responded by developing several plans during 1930 and 1931 to repay foreign debt, provide relief to farmers and create economic stimulus to curb unemployment based on deficit spending and expansionary monetary policy. Although the Keynesian Revolution would see these ideas adopted by most Western nations by the end of the decade, in 1931 such ideas were considered radical and the plans were bitterly opposed by many who feared hyperinflation and economic ruin. The still opposition-dominated Australian Senate, and the conservative-dominated boards of the Commonwealth Bank and Loan Council, repeatedly blocked the plans.

With the prospect of bankruptcy facing the government, Scullin backed down and instead advanced the Premiers&#x27; Plan, a far more conservative measure that met the crisis with severe cutbacks in government spending. Pensioners and other core Labor constituencies were severely affected by the cuts, leading to a widespread revolt and multiple defections in parliament. After several months of infighting the government collapsed, and was resoundingly defeated by the newly formed United Australia Party at the subsequent 1931 election.

Scullin would remain party leader for four more years, losing the 1934 election but the party split would not be healed until after Scullin&#x27;s return to the backbenches in 1935. Scullin became a respected elder voice within the party and leading authority on taxation and government finance, and would eventually play a significant role in reforming both when Labor returned to government in 1941. Although disappointed with his own term of office, he nonetheless lived long enough to see many of his government&#x27;s ideas implemented by subsequent governments before his death in 1953.

==Early life==

Scullin was born in Trawalla, Victoria on 18 September 1876. His parents, John and Ann (née Logan) Scullin, were both Irish Catholics from County Londonderry. His father was a railway labourer, who emigrated to Australia in his 20s. His mother joined her husband in Australia later. James was the fourth of eight children, and grew up in a tight-knit and devoutly Catholic home. James attended the Trawalla State School from 1881 to 1887 and earned an early reputation as an active and quick-witted boy, though never physically robust. These characteristics would remain with him for life.

The family moved to Mount Rowan, Ballarat, in 1887, and the young James attended school at Mount Rowan State School until 12. Thereafter he held various manual odd-jobs in the Ballarat district until about 1900, and for ten years from 1900 he ran a grocer&#x27;s shop in Ballarat. In his mid-20s he attended night school, was a voracious reader and became somewhat of an autodidact. He joined a number of societies and was active in the Australian Natives&#x27; Association and the Catholic Young Men&#x27;s Society, eventually becoming president of the latter. He was also a skilled debater, participating in local competitions and having an association with the Ballarat South Street debating society for nearly 30 years, which would prove formative to his interest and talent in politics. Scullin was a devout Roman Catholic, a non-drinker and a non-smoker all his life.

Scullin became active in politics during his years in Ballarat, being influenced by the ideas of Tom Mann and the growing labour movement in Victoria, as were many of his later ministerial colleagues such as Frank Anstey, John Curtin and Frank Brennan. He became a foundation member of his local Political Labor Council in 1903 and was active in local politics thereafter. He was a campaigner and political organizer for the Australian Workers&#x27; Union, the union movement with which he would remain most closely associated throughout his career. He spoke often around Ballarat on political issues and helped with Labor campaigns at state and federal level. At the 1906 federal election he was selected as the Labor candidate for the Division of Ballaarat against then Prime Minister Alfred Deakin. Although a race in which Labor had virtually no chance of winning, Scullin ran a spirited campaign and impressed those within the movement for his efforts.

On 11 November 1907 he married Sarah Maria McNamara, a dressmaker from Ballarat. The marriage was childless. Due to Scullin&#x27;s frequent and often serious bouts of illness over his long career, Sarah served the role as her husband&#x27;s protector and was a crucial source of support and care for her husband, particularly in his final years. She was frequently called to assist or stand in for her husband at social occasions when her husband&#x27;s illness prevented him from attending personally. She was an active member of the Labor Party herself, and would remain well-informed on politics. Very unusually among Australian political spouses (and even more so during the period of her husband&#x27;s career), Sarah would often attend parliamentary sessions, and would even be present during the debate and vote that brought her husband&#x27;s government down.

==Political career==

In 1910 Scullin won his first election as the Labor candidate in Corangamite, in a year when Labor&#x27;s Andrew Fisher surged in the polls and formed Australia&#x27;s first majority government. Scullin had done much to personally build the grass-roots organisation of the Labor movement in this seat in the years prior to the election, although its rural character meant it was not considered a seat naturally sympathetic to Labor. His campaign focused on increasing the powers of the Federal parliament and issues such as defending a white Australia, higher import duties and the introduction of a land tax. In federal parliament, Scullin quickly earned a reputation as an impressive and formidable parliamentary debater. He spoke on a wide range of issues over the three years of his term, but concentrated especially on matters relating to taxation and the powers of the Commonwealth, both of which would become signature issues for Scullin throughout his career. By the end of his first year in parliament he had a reputation as &quot;one of the most ardent land-taxers in the Labor party&quot; and had spoken frequently on breaking up &quot;the land monopoly which has for so many years retarded the growth of this young country.&quot; Scullin enthusiastically supported Fisher&#x27;s referendum questions in expand Commonwealth power over in 1911 and again in 1913, though in both cases all amendment proposals were rejected by comfortable majorities. Although he was well regarded in his district and hard-working and ardent, it was not enough to shield him from Joseph Cook&#x27;s resurgent and now united Commonwealth Liberal Party in the election of 1913, and Scullin suffered the fate of many Labor members in rural districts at that year&#x27;s election. He tried and failed to reacquire the seat at the 1918 Corangamite by-election.

After defeat Scullin was appointed as editor of the &quot;Evening Echo&quot;, a daily newspaper owned by the Australian Workers Union in Ballarat. He would hold this position for the next nine years, which solidified his position within the Victorian Labor movement and made him an influential voice within its ranks, being elected president of the Victorian state branch of Labor in 1918. He and his paper became leading voices against conscription in Victoria during World War I, and a forceful intellectual contributor to the party during the Billy Hughes years. At the special Labor conference on conscription in 1916, Scullin moved for the expulsion of the conscriptionists, including Prime Minister Hughes and former prime minister Chris Watson. During these years Scullin earned a reputation as a socialist on the left-wing of the party and had radicalised in some of his opinions, particularly his sentiments against imperial domination from London. Scullin was fiercely patriotic and critical of the war, particularly Britain&#x27;s leadership of the dominions within it. In the early 1920s Scullin was prominent in the push for the party to adopt economic socialisation policies as part of its platform.

The death of federal Labor leader Frank Tudor left a vacancy in the very safe urban seat of the Division of Yarra in Melbourne. Scullin handily won Labor preselection over several other candidates, and in February 1922 he took the seat at the ensuing 1922 Yarra by-election with more than three-quarters of the vote. With his win, he and his family relocated to Richmond, away from his long-time home of Ballarat, and to an electorate completely different in character to his earlier seat of Corangamite. However his new proximity to the Federal parliament (still located in Melbourne) and representation of a safe seat afforded many more political opportunities and freedoms, and soon Scullin was a prominent figure on the Labor campaign trail and appearing at events around the country. In these years Scullin&#x27;s renown increased considerably within the party and the nation at large. He became one of the leading lights of the parliamentary opposition, and was quickly elevated to the Australian Labor Party National Executive in February 1923.

During his years as an opposition backbencher, Scullin spoke frequently and passionately. He was an able debater and parliamentary performer, but also carved out a niche as a leading voice on several issues, particularly taxation and economic policy. Some of Scullin&#x27;s charges on land-tax avoidance by wealthy pastoralists were so damning that the Bruce government called a Royal Commission specifically to investigate his claims. Scullin&#x27;s competence on financial matters proved useful to the government as well, and several of his suggestions from the opposition bench made their way into government legislation. In March 1927 Scullin became the parliamentary ALP&#x27;s deputy leader.

==Leader of the Opposition==

As Deputy Leader, Scullin excelled in taking the case to the government. Throughout 1927 Scullin earned particular acclaim in keeping the ageing Bruce government to account on economic and financial matters. A series of speeches by Scullin that year on the Government&#x27;s mishandling of the economy, and the generally dangerous trajectory of Commonwealth financial policy, predicted catastrophe. He accused the government of spending too much, borrowing too much from overseas sources, and not rectifying a worrying excess of imports over exports: a three-part recipe for disaster. This alarming analysis of the Australian economy would prove to be correct within three years, however relatively few paid attention to Scullin&#x27;s warning at the time, nor the prescient 1927 volume &quot;The Boom of 1890 – And Now&quot; by E.O.G. Shann, on which Scullin based many of his arguments.

In March 1928, Matthew Charlton resigned as federal Labor leader and was replaced by Scullin in a unanimous motion, although some had their eye on newcomer Ted Theodore as a more promising replacement. The ensuing contest over the position of Deputy Leader saw Theodore denied once again in a close vote, foreshadowing some of the future controversy he would stir up within the party under Scullin.

Scullin led Labor at the 1928 election. He visited widely around the country, and made especial focus on Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland – states where the Labor party&#x27;s fortunes had greatly declined in previous years. Scullin was well received and made ground in these areas, as well as in rural districts to counteract the increasingly urban nature of Labor. Labor managed to take eight seats, significantly reducing the Coalition&#x27;s previously large majority. This was due to a swing against the government rather than a swing towards Labor, but was still enough to put Labor within striking distance of winning the next election. Although Labor came up well short of forming government, the campaign was viewed as a success and Scullin&#x27;s reputation remained intact as leader.

1929 was dogged by industrial disputes, the worst of which occurred within the waterfront, timber and coalmining sectors. The Bruce government struggled to manage these episodes – its proposal by referendum for greater Commonwealth industrial powers had been rejected in 1926. After months of deadlock and protests over decisions of the Federal Arbitration Court, Bruce reversed course entirely by proposing that the Commonwealth dismantle federal arbitration and hand industrial matters back entirely to the states. The proposal was a radical departure from one of the pillars of the so-called &quot;Australian settlement&quot;, and several MPs, led by former PM Billy Hughes, ultimately voted against the government and forced Bruce to seek an additional mandate from the people, at the 1929 election. Crucially, it would be a House-only election as the 1925 Senate term had not expired. Just 9 months after the previous campaign, Australia was in campaign mode once more. Amidst a background of industrial strife and heavy handed government proposals to deal with it, Scullin, who preached conciliation and negotiation between the parties, seemed the moderate choice, despite the more radical stances otherwise held by Labor. Fighting on their home territory and in favour of what was a still popular status-quo in industrial relations law, Scullin and Labor romped home in the polls, winning 46 seats in the 75 seat chamber, the most they had ever won at the time. Labor even managed to oust Bruce in his own seat. The party was jubilant and Scullin enthusiastically accepted commission to become prime minister. He was to be Australia&#x27;s first Catholic prime minister.

==Prime minister==

Scullin came to Canberra amid rapturous applause from his supporters and the largest majority that Labor had ever won at the time. However, the party had many diverse interests and factions within it, ranging from metropolitan socialist radicals to rural professional politicians. The Scullin government immediately rolled back several of the Bruce government&#x27;s measures deemed to be anti-labor – including changes made to industrial arbitration and competition, and the immediate abolition of compulsory military training. Scullin also chose not to take residence in The Lodge, which had only been completed two years prior, citing its unnecessary extravagance and cost to the taxpayer. In 1929, the Scullin government established the Canberra University College.

But the government&#x27;s attention would soon shift to the economy. On the very day Scullin arrived in Canberra after the 1929 election, The Sydney Morning Herald announced large losses on Wall Street. On 24 October, two days after Scullin&#x27;s cabinet was sworn in, news of Black Thursday reached Australia and the government. The effect these developments would have on the Australian economy were not yet known, as economic conditions were already agreed to be poor, but the portents of future disaster were there. Three of the last four Commonwealth budgets had been in substantial arrears funded by overseas borrowing, and the value of Australian debt had been steadily declining in foreign markets. Sluggish years for the agricultural and manufacturing sectors were compounding the problem, but the most worrying statistic was unemployment, which was just over 13% at the end of 1929. A further problem was the decline in Australian trade. Price for wool and wheat – Australia&#x27;s two principal exports – had fallen by almost a third during 1929. With debts rising and the ability to repay diminishing, Australia was faced with a seriously troubled financial outlook when Scullin took office.

Scullin&#x27;s government faced significant limitations on its power to implement its response to the economic crisis. There had been no half-Senate election in 1929, meaning that the Nationalist majority elected at the 1928 election was still in place. The conservative Senate proved hostile to much of Labor&#x27;s economic program. Scullin also had to contend with a financial establishment in Australia (most notably Commonwealth Bank Board chairman Sir Robert Gibson) and in the United Kingdom (such as Bank of England representative Sir Otto Niemeyer) that was firmly opposed to any deviation from orthodox economics in responding to the Great Depression. On the contrary, there was much disagreement with Scullin&#x27;s parliamentary party as to how to respond to the crisis, and a great many were sympathetic to the then radical ideas of inflationary finance and other proto-Keynesian approaches. Furthermore, Scullin and his Treasurer Ted Theodore were vehemently opposed to suggestions from the Opposition and Commonwealth Bank to reduce the deficit by cutting Federal welfare emoluments. Thus began two-years of clashes between the government and its opponents, which would prove to be some of the most turbulent in Australian political history.

===Crisis and deadlock===
Ongoing industrial disputes on the coalfields of the Hunter Valley and Newcastle dragged on throughout Scullin&#x27;s government, the Commonwealth lacking the power to coerce a solution and numerous negotiations between owners and workers collapsed. As a Labor Prime Minister, expectations ran high that Scullin would force the mine owners to submit to worker demands. Scullin was sympathetic, but refused to go beyond negotiations and inducements to end the disputes. Many within the New South Wales Labor branch were infuriated and felt they had been betrayed, catalysing a beginning of a separation between the state branch (led by fiery demagogue Jack Lang) and the federal party led by Scullin.

Heavily indebted and with conditions worsening, Scullin and Theodore took many novel steps in an attempt to turn the economy around. Appeals were made, both to the Australian public and on overseas markets, to bolster confidence and boost government bond subscriptions. A &quot;Grow More Wheat&quot; campaign was launched in 1930 to encourage farmers to plant a record crop and attempt to improve Australia&#x27;s serious trade deficit, although ultimately Scullin was unsuccessful in convincing the Senate or the Commonwealth Bank to support this program through price guarantees. At the same time unemployment had hit a record high of 14.6% in the March quarter of 1930. Scullin&#x27;s election promise of unemployment insurance was discussed in this period, but with dire predictions for government finance the promise was continually stalled. Scullin made major proposals to change the constitutional amendment process; expand Commonwealth powers over commerce, trade and industry; and to break apart the Commonwealth Bank to separate out its reserve bank and trading bank functions. The Senate blocked them all, or made amendments which rendered them unrecognisable. A double dissolution was threatened, though for various reasons both practical and political, Scullin never took this step. In June 1930 the government suffered a heavy loss when Theodore was forced to resign after he was criticised by a Royal Commission enquiring into a scandal known as the Mungana affair, claims of corrupt deals dating back to Theodore&#x27;s time as Premier of Queensland. Scullin took over the Treasury portfolio in the interim while Theodore went to Queensland to face charges, and was compelled to bring down the 1930 budget personally.
Tarred with the political scandal, the budget, which raised taxes, cut spending and still did not deliver a surplus, was very unpopular with all sections of the community. What is more, the budget proved overly optimistic as Australian revenues continued to plunge and the deficit rose. By August 1930, crisis meetings were held in which Sir Robert Gibson and Sir Otto Niemeyer were demanding further economies in Commonwealth spending. Niemeyer, a representative of the Bank of England, had arrived in Australia to inspect financial conditions on behalf of creditors and had a grim report – that &quot;Australian credit is at a low ebb...lower than that of any of the other dominions&quot; and that without drastic steps default and financial collapse was assured. Gibson agreed, and as Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board had the power to deny the Australian government loans to finance the budget unless more cuts were made by both the national and state governments. After meeting with Scullin and state premiers, the &#x27;Melbourne Agreement&#x27; was reluctantly struck in which further major spending cuts were agreed to, although opposed by a significant minority of Scullin&#x27;s party.

In the heat of this crisis, matters were made worse still by Scullin&#x27;s decision to travel to London on 25 August 1930 to seek an emergency loan and to attend the Imperial Conference. While in London, Scullin succeeded in gaining loans for Australia at reduced interest. He also succeeded in having King George V appoint Sir Isaac Isaacs as the first Australian-born Governor-General of Australia, despite the King&#x27;s personal opposition and the strong objections of both the British establishment and the conservative opposition in Australia, who attacked the appointment as tantamount to republicanism. However a leadership vacuum was left behind, with Scullin out of the country for the whole second half of 1930, James Fenton (as acting prime minister) and Joseph Lyons (as acting Treasurer) were left in charge. They insisted on pursuing deflationary policies and orthodox solutions to degrading Commonwealth budgetary position, arousing great opposition in the Labor caucus. In regular contact with Fenton and Lyons in London through the awkward means of cables, Scullin felt he had no choice but to agree to the recommendations of economic advisers, supported by Lyons and Fenton, that government spending be heavily cut, despite the suffering this caused and the disillusionment of the Labor party&#x27;s base, whom were most affected by these cuts. Party unity began to crumble, and the gulf between the moderate and radical wings of the party began to grow.

===Internal divisions and the Theodore Plan===

Returning to Australia on 6 January 1931, Scullin was faced with a party now deeply divided over how to respond to the Depression. Jack Lang had won election as Premier of New South Wales and had become a leading alternative voice within Labor, advocating radical measures including repudiation of interest on debts to Britain and printing money to pay for public works programs to relieve unemployment and inflate the currency. The NSW contingent in Federal parliament was sympathetic to Lang&#x27;s views and had become disillusioned with Scullin&#x27;s leadership and his compromises with conservative interests. At the first meeting of cabinet upon his return, Scullin made things worse by reappointing Theodore as treasurer, despite his name not having been yet cleared over the Mungana Affair. Although arguably Theodore was the most competent man available to implement Scullin&#x27;s economic program, Lyons and Fenton (as well as several others) were strongly opposed and resigned from the cabinet in protest. Making matters worse, Theodore had become a fierce personal rival of Lang within the New South Wales branch, and his return as treasurer further isolated radical elements of the party. At the same time, the economy had continued to decline and unemployment had soared, with most of the government measures designed to combat the crisis still in limbo due to opposition either from the Senate or refusal of funding by the Commonwealth Bank.

In February Scullin and Theodore presented a comprehensive plan at a conference of the state premiers that attempted to straddle both orthodox and radical approaches. While maintaining heavy budgetary cuts, it also planned to provide economic stimulus to help the unemployed and farmers, as well as repaying short-term debts and overdrafts held by British banks. This would require substantial further funds to be advanced by the Commonwealth Bank, however Gibson soon made it clear he would not do so unless significant cuts to social spending (particularly pensions) was also implemented. Scullin refused, instead planning to pay for the plan through the expanding the note issue. This &#x27;Theodore Plan&#x27; was approved by narrow majorities of the state premiers and then the parliamentary party. However, Jack Lang rejected the plan, stating instead that Australia should default on its British debts until more equitable repayment terms were agreed to. Lyons and the conservatives within the party were horrified, as were the Opposition, seeing note issue as a sure path to hyperinflation and complete economic ruin.
In March matters came to a head. The 1931 East Sydney by-election saw Eddie Ward elected on a specifically pro-Lang platform, and the bitter campaign within the seat saw federal Labor and NSW Labor mutually expel each other from the party. Scullin and the Federal party refused to admit Ward to the caucus, and subsequently Jack Beasley led five others out of the party room to sit on the cross-benches as &quot;Lang Labor&quot;. With chaos in Labor ranks and parliament facing a highly controversial plan for economic rehabilitation, the Opposition presented a motion of no confidence. Lyons, Fenton and four others on the conservative wing resigned from Labor and crossed over to the opposition benches. Scullin was reduced to a minority government of just 35 members, depending on the Lang faction to stay in power. Having built a large and popular following among the public, Lyons and his ex-Labor followers joined the Nationalists and the erstwhile followers of Hughes in United Australia Party, with Lyons becoming the new Leader of the Opposition. With a possible default by the Commonwealth looming in June, Scullin&#x27;s minority government attempted to push through the Theodore Plan. Although under pressure given the prospect of bankruptcy, the Senate and Gibson did not relent, and nearly all the bills needed to implement the Theodore Plan were rejected. Nationwide opinion was divided on the government plan, however many were extremely concerned about the prospect of excessive inflation should the government start printing money to pay its bills.

===Premiers&#x27; Plan and downfall===

Now May, with unemployment at 27.6% widespread suffering across much of the population, Scullin called another conference of the state premiers to try and forge a new deal, now resigned to the fact that compromise with the Opposition was inevitable if any plan could be implemented. A new orthodox plan calling for 20% reductions in spending across the board for all governments was struck, and such cuts to also apply to social welfare spending. Combined with a mass loan conversion that would reduce the interest rates paid on government bonds by 22.5%, Australia now had a consensus as to how to reduce the annual deficit from some £41.08m to £14.65m. Although he had finally secured parliamentary and state approval for a plan, Scullin now faced a revolt from his own party. Cuts to pensions and the poor were particularly hard for Scullin, and many core Labor supporters felt deeply betrayed by this compromise of society&#x27;s most vulnerable groups. Scullin ardently defend the program, but Lang&#x27;s influence as an alternative opinion leader of Labor was growing, now with state branches in Victoria and South Australia rebelling against the Premiers&#x27; Plan.
Traumatic as it was, the government finally now was implementing an economic plan, and things began to improve. Domestic confidence, and confidence in the British loan market, began to recover and default was averted. Voluntary acceptance of lower bond rates on government debt had been extremely successful in a patriotic campaign, wool and wheat prices finally began to rise, and government finances at both Commonwealth and state level were largely under control by October. But with unemployment still rising (it would not peak until 1932), Scullin still faced disillusionment from many within his party, and further gains in ground by Lang. Lang felt threatened by the apparent success of the Premier&#x27;s Plan though, and renewed talks of unity between the factions had appeared with the improvement of economic conditions. Lang Labor subsequently forced a showdown with the Scullin government in November. With allegations arising that Theodore had abused his position as treasurer to buy support in New South Wales away from the Lang faction, Beasley and his followers called for a royal commission into the charges. Scullin refused. To the surprise of many observers, the Beasley group crossed the floor to join the Opposition, thereby defeating the government. A snap poll, the 1931 election, was called. Scullin for the first time in Australian politics made heavy use of the radio to reach voters. The campaign was one of the shortest in history, but with open warfare between pro-Lang and pro-Scullin forces in Victoria and New South Wales, and much of the country still facing hardship and grievances against the government, a Labor defeat was virtually assured. Labor was defeated in a massive landslide. The official Labor Party was reduced to a mere 14 seats (Lang Labor won another 4), and Lyons became prime minister. However, Scullin was not held responsible for the debacle and stayed on as Labor leader. To date, it is the last time that a sitting Australian government has been defeated after a single term.

==Later career==
The heavy task of leading the country through the brunt of the depression, beset as he was by many enemies and few friends, left deep marks on Scullin&#x27;s character. As one Country Party parliamentarian observed, &quot;the great burden that was imposed upon him then almost killed him&quot;. Scullin won much praise for his performance as Opposition Leader, as he had before coming prime minister. His grasp of economic and trade matters was still formidable, and on several matters he succeeded in forcing changes to government policy or banding with the Country Party to force amendments to government legislation. However failure to reunite the party and dislodge Lang as the alternative voice of the party failed in the lead-up to the 1934 election left the party at a distinct disadvantage. Ultimately, Scullin and his Commonwealth supporters&#x27; implementation of the Premiers&#x27; Plan was too much of a betrayal for many to accept, and opposing Lang and Scullin Labor factions continued to plague NSW and Victorian state politics for years. The election proved to be a dispiriting defeat for Scullin. Despite an admirable and vigorous term as opposition leader, Scullin&#x27;s Labor gained just four seats and actually suffered a small swing against it, with Labor and the UAP losing ground to Lang Labor, which gained 5 seats on a swing of almost 4%.

Scullin markedly declined in vigor for his role as Opposition Leader after he was reconfirmed in it after the 1934 election. Tired of the infighting, he took little part in the renewed conciliation talks between the opposition party wings, which in the event failed to resolve the now entrenched divide between Lang and anti-Lang forces. Scullin at many points had stated his resolve to remain leader until such time that he could be sure he would not be succeeded by Lang forces at the federal level, but fate intervened and Scullin&#x27;s health, always middling, declined significantly in 1935. Bedridden several times, Scullin tendered his resignation on 23 September 1935, citing a physical inability to continue as leader. By the time of Scullin&#x27;s resignation Australia&#x27;s economy had recovered significantly and business confidence had returned to a large extent. The belligerent actions of Japan in China, and then Germany in Europe, began to overtake the economy as the predominant concern of Australian politics. James Scullin was succeeded by John Curtin, who proved a necessary salve to Labor wounds. Under Curtin&#x27;s leadership, most of the Lang Labor faction returned to the mainline Labor fold, though Lang and some supporters remained obdurate. During these years Scullin was far quieter in the backbenches, only occasionally taking an active role in parliament, though still an active local member in his seat of Yarra. He was a passionate advocate for Australian arts, and with the Fellowship of Australian Writers, was responsible for a dramatic boost to the Commonwealth Literary Fund&#x27;s budget in 1939.
Curtin became prime minister in 1941 after two independents joined Labor in voting down the government&#x27;s budget. Curtin came to rely on Scullin greatly for his counsel. Scullin took no portfolio nor played any part in military strategy or much of the overall war effort, except where finance was concerned. However, he was given the office between Curtin and Treasurer Ben Chifley&#x27;s, and his advice would have significant bearing upon the policy and political tactics of the Curtin government. Scullin was a leading voice in caucus in support of the new PM, urging it to give Curtin the powers to run his own government without the caucus interference Scullin himself had so frequently fallen afoul of a decade earlier. To Scullin&#x27;s delight, rafts of social and economic policies, so long out of reach for Labor governments, finally became law during the wartime government. Scullin continued to be a leading voice in the movement in favour of further social welfare plans and was influential within the party in the nature and direction these took. Another of Scullin&#x27;s long held ambitions – eradication of the Federal structure in favour of a unified state – was advanced when he was appointed as one of three on a committee to recommend means of implementing uniform taxation. That committee soon proposed eliminating state governments&#x27; ability to levy income tax, a proposal which Curtin accepted and greatly weakened the Federal system by making states fiscally dependent on the Commonwealth. Scullin&#x27;s committee work shone out again in 1944, where he led the charge to change the tax code to operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, which was accepted and implemented by the Curtin government.

Ill-health continued to return in bouts, but Scullin remained active if subdued in parliament after Curtin&#x27;s death and Chifley&#x27;s succession in 1945. He continued to be influential in fiscal and taxation matters, and the impact of his experience was still occasionally felt in Chifley-era legislation. However his health declined significantly in 1947, and he did not appear in parliament again after June of that year, announcing he would retire at the 1949 election.

===Death and funeral===

Scullin was frequently bedridden in these last 18 months, and unable to attend many gatherings. His condition deteriorated further after retirement, suffering cardio-renal failure in 1951 and becoming almost permanently bedridden and under the care of his wife.

Scullin died in his sleep on 28 January 1953 in Hawthorn, Melbourne from complications arising from pulmonary edema. He was accorded a state funeral in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne with a Requiem Mass presided over by Archbishop Daniel Mannix. He was buried in the Catholic section of Melbourne General Cemetery. Over his grave the federal Labor executive and the ACTU erected a monument on behalf of the Labor movement of Australia. The inscription reads: &quot;Justice and humanity demand interference whenever the weak are being crushed by the strong.&quot; Scullin&#x27;s wife, Sarah, was interred with him in 1962. Labor stalwarts Arthur Calwell, Esmond Kiernan, Herbert Cremean and Edward Grayndler are all buried adjacent to the Scullin plot.

==Legacy==

Scullin had defended his record in government throughout his later career, and took pride in having been prime minister in times which might have broken a lesser figure. However he lived long enough to see many of his economic ideas vindicated by history, particularly inflationary financing, which was quite radical by the standards of his times but an accepted pillar of Keynesian economics adopted by Australia and most other Western governments in the late 1930s and 1940s. Indeed, John Maynard Keynes himself would state of Scullin&#x27;s Premier&#x27;s Plan which caused him so much woe and electoral unpopularity that it &quot;saved the economic structure of Australia&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; admitted after the 1931 election that Scullin &quot;had already done much to place Australia on the high road to recovery&quot;.

Several measures which had been proposed and defeated by the UAP opposition (particularly on gold shipments for loan repayments) were subsequently reintroduced and passed by the UAP once in government, giving Scullin some satisfaction. Furthermore, Scullin consoled himself with the fact that the Depression destroyed most of the political careers of those who occupied government through it – only one Australian premier won re-election from 1927 to 1935, and Scullin&#x27;s foreign contemporaries Herbert Hoover (in the United States of America), Ramsay MacDonald (United Kingdom), Richard Bennett (Canada) and George Forbes (New Zealand) all suffered similarly devastating elections in the wake of the depression. In 1951, 114 manufacturers in Melbourne donated to a fund for Scullin&#x27;s retirement. Having not forgotten his advocacy of tariffs during their height of unpopularity in the depression, several companies went as far to state that Scullin&#x27;s efforts had &quot;commenced a new era in the secondary industry field in Australia&quot; and that the success of Australia&#x27;s wartime industry was due to Scullin&#x27;s protection of industry during its most vulnerable period a decade earlier.

Scullin&#x27;s years following his term of government also proved fruitful – he exerted a surprising amount of influence over government policy as Opposition Leader. Scullin was for decades the foremost expert in the Australian parliament on taxation and a variety of other fiscal matters, a fact which rendered his advice very influential within the Curtin government and many of his ideas, having been denied during his own term of government, would eventually be enshrined in the wave of sweeping reforms made by the Curtin/Chifley governments. Scullin was a well-respected figure in politics. Although the target of much bile and disagreement over his policies, he was personally extremely well regarded and had a reputation as a fearless and stoic leader of great personal integrity and fortitude. His resignation as leader in 1935 caused even longtime critic Jack Beasley to admit that Scullin was &quot;a fearless fighter in the exposition of what he believes to be the right course&quot;.

Scullin, Australian Capital Territory, a suburb of Canberra, is named after him, as is the Division of Scullin, a House of Representatives electorate. The Scullin monolith in Antarctica was also named in his honour.

<text>Marlborough College is a public school (English private boarding school) for pupils aged 13 to 18 in Marlborough, Wiltshire, England. It was founded as Marlborough School in 1843 by the Dean of Manchester, George Hull Bowers, for the education of the sons of Church of England clergy. It is one of the oldest boarding schools in the UK, and now adopts a co-educational model. In 2023 there were around 1000 pupils, approximately 45% of whom were female.

In 2024, the school was included in The Schools Index as one of the 150 best private schools in the world and among the top 30 senior schools in the UK. Fees for boarding pupils in 2024/2025 are £50,985 per year.

==History==
Marlborough was, in 1968, the first major British independent boys&#x27; school to allow girls into the sixth form, setting a trend that many other schools followed. The school became fully co-educational in 1989, and made a major contribution to the School Mathematics Project (from 1961) alongside initiating the teaching of its Business Studies programme (from 1968). In 1963 a group of boys, led by the future political biographer Ben Pimlott, wrote a book, &quot;Marlborough, an open examination written by the boys&quot;, describing life at the boarding institute. The writer and television critic T. C. Worsley wrote about predatory old masters at the school in his critically acclaimed autobiography &quot;Flannelled Fool: A Slice of a Life in the Thirties&quot;.

In 2005, the school was one of fifty of the country&#x27;s most prestigious independent schools which were found by the Office of Fair Trading to have run an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by &quot;The Times&quot;, which had allowed them to drive up fees for thousands of parents. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000, and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, &quot;They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.&quot;

The school is a member of the G20 Schools group. Marlborough College Malaysia, a sister school, opened in Johor in 2012.

== Buildings ==
The college is built beside the Mound, at the site of a former Norman castle. No remains of the castle can be seen today, though the radiocarbon dating of core samples in the early 2010s indicated that the origins of the Mound date from 2400 BC. This is close to the dates established for Silbury Hill.

The main focus of the college is the Court, which is surrounded by buildings in a number of architectural styles. At the south end is the back of an early 18th-century mansion, later converted to a coaching inn, which was bought as the first building for the school. The main block of what now forms C House, it was built by Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset and is a Grade I listed building. Next to it are the old stables, now converted into boarding houses. The west side consists of the 1959 red brick dining hall, and a Victorian boarding house now converted to other purposes. The north west corner is dominated by its Victorian Gothic style chapel by the architects George Frederick Bodley and Thomas Garner, which has a collection of pre-Raphaelite style paintings by John Roddam Spencer Stanhope and stained glass by Old Marlburian William Morris.

The rest of the Court is surrounded by buildings in styles ranging from &quot;Jacobethan&quot; (a name coined by Old Marlburian Sir John Betjeman) to classical Georgian and Victorian. The latter, B house (now called B1), was (along with the College Chapel) designed by the Victorian architect Edward Blore, whose other works included the facade of Buckingham Palace (since remodelled) and the Vorontsovsky Palace in Alupka, Ukraine.

On the other side of the Mound is the science laboratory, built in 1933. It is an early example of shuttered concrete construction and was listed as a building of architectural significance in 1970.

==Houses==
Pupils are assigned to one of the 16 houses upon entering the school, where they make their home for the duration of their studies, and compete against other houses in sporting olympiads.

The houses are divided between on-campus heritage sites – mostly gathered around the central court – and sites around the western side of Marlborough town. The older on-campus heritage houses are referred to by an alphanumeric title. Newer houses have been given names reflecting their location or commemorating a figure from the school&#x27;s past.

===House names===
When the college became fully co-educational in 1989, three girls&#x27; houses were opened – Morris, Elmhurst and Mill Mead; New Court was opened in 1991. Morris was moved in 1995 from A house to Field House, which had previously been occupied by B3 and C2. New houses were built to accommodate C3, which had previously shared C house with C1 (in 1989) and C2 (in 1992). In 2012, the college acquired the Ivy House Hotel in Marlborough High Street which opened as a girls&#x27; house in the autumn of that year.

==Railway locomotive==
In 1933, the school lent its name to one of the steam locomotives in the Southern Railway&#x27;s Schools class, which were named after English public schools. The locomotive bearing the school&#x27;s name (no. 922, later 30922) was withdrawn in 1961.

Fred Again, fashion moguls Amanda Harlech and Stella Tennant, and convicted human trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rab Butler, Home Secretary Henry Brooke, Baron Brooke of Cumnor, Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher, Olivia Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster, and individuals from the British monarchy including Catherine, Princess of Wales and Princess Eugenie are also Old Marlburians.

See List of Old Marlburians for other notable former pupils. Societies for former pupils include the Marlburian Club.

==Terms==
There are three academic terms in the year:
*The Michaelmas Term, from early September to mid December (new boys, girls and lower-sixth candidates are now usually only admitted at the start of the Michaelmas Half);
*The Lent Term, from mid January to late March;
*The Summer Term, from late April to late June or early July.

==Facilities==
===The Memorial Hall===

The Memorial Hall was built to commemorate the 749 Old Marlburians who were killed in World War I. Following World War II, the names of those killed in that war were added to a memorial panel in the entrance hall.

The hall is a semi-circular auditorium of stepped seats. There is a stage at the front. Below the seats with access from the outside rear are a number of music practice rooms. The façade of the hall towards the forecourt and road has two entrance lobbies linked together by eight stone columns. The forecourt is paved with stone.

The Hall holds about 800 people so can no longer be used for assemblies of the entire school. It is now most often used for concerts and theatrical productions where the whole school is not expected to attend.

===The Chapel===
The current Chapel is the second to be built at the school. The first was opened in 1848 but by 1880 the school numbers had outgrown its space. After consideration of expanding the existing building, it was demolished in 1884 and a new Chapel was designed and built.

The new Chapel, designed in the Late Decorated Gothic style, was dedicated to St Michael and All Angels and was consecrated in 1886. The original colour scheme of greens and browns was much loved by Sir John Betjeman and there are twelve large Pre-Raphaelite murals by Spencer Stanhope which depict various Biblical scenes involving angels. Those on the north side show scenes from the Old Testament while the six on the south side are from the New Testament.

Two other artistic features are the Scholars&#x27; Window on the Chapel&#x27;s south side. The work&#x27;s creation was supervised in 1875 by Old Marlburian William Morris and designed by Edward Burne-Jones. Initially displayed in the original Chapel, the work was reinstated in the new Chapel . A sculpture of &quot;The Virgin and Child&quot; by Eric Gill is near the west door. Sir Frank Brangwyn, who had been trained by Morris, produced murals for the school chapel of Christ&#x27;s Hospital (1912-1923) and visited Marlborough College, particularly its Chapel, on several occasions to deliver lectures and practical workshops to members of the Marlborough College community. Brangwyn and Walthamstow Borough Council signed a trust deed in 1935 to set up the William Morris Gallery and ‘The William Morris Gallery and Brangwyn Gift’ opened to the public in October 1950.

In 2010, the Marlborough College Chapel was closed owing to structural defects. After being repaired, it was declared safe to use.

===Music facilities and performance areas===
All music halls and performance areas are fitted with soundproof windows which prevent sound from escaping, even while open, as well as walls engineered to prevent sound crossing at right angles. The floors of the centres also float on a bed of air, so as to maintain good soundproofing.

===The Blackett Observatory===

The Blackett Observatory houses a 10-inch-aperture Cooke refractor on a motorised equatorial mount. The telescope dates from 1860 and was used professionally at the Radcliffe Observatory at Oxford University. When the Observatory was relocated to South Africa in the 1930s, Sir Basil Blackett, a president of the Marlburian Club, raised the funds to purchase it and have the observatory built on the playing fields of the college.

In 1997 a restoration effort was started which was finished in 2002 when the telescope was reopened for use. It is currently used to teach astronomy and is also open to local astronomers from outside the college.

===Sports history and facilities===
A fully operational army-only CCF detachment operates at the college under the supervision of a resident SSI (school staff instructor). Weekly parades take place at the parade ground adjacent to the armoury, with occasional off-campus activities, such as range-days or overnight exercises.

Next to the CCF parade ground is a six-lane .22 rifle range. Rifle shooting has had a long history at the college, with teams representing the school since 1862. By the 1890s, the &quot;difficulty&quot; of finding a replacement sport during the Easter term led to hockey matches being regularly played against Clifton College, with the sport consequently becoming popular with other public schools and sporting communities.

While fighting alongside government forces against the Hauhau in 1865, he was accused of spying. Exiled to the Chatham Islands without trial along with captured Hauhau, he experienced visions and became a religious leader. In 1868 he led the escape of 168 prisoners, seizing the schooner &quot;Rifleman&quot; and sailing back to the North Island where he began a series of raids. A resultant military reprisal campaign became known as Te Kooti&#x27;s War. He was pardoned in 1883 but continued to be active in spreading the Ringatū message of peace and reclaiming land from Pakeha.

==Early life==
Te Kooti&#x27;s early years are obscure. He was born at Te Pā-o-Kahu in the Gisborne region as a son of Hōne Rangipātahi (father) and Hine Turākau (mother), of the Rongowhakaata tribe (iwi). Their sub-tribe (hapū) was Ngāti Maru, whose villages were situated near the Awapuni lagoon, where the Waipaoa River runs into the ocean. Arikirangi is thought to be the original name of Te Kooti. His birth date is thought to be approximately 1832.

Toiroa Ikariki (Ikarihi), a matakite (visionary) of Nukutaurua on Māhia Peninsula, prophesied the birth of Te Kooti (as well as the coming of white people, the Pākehā):
The song is dated 1766. The &quot;Pakerewhā&quot; were strangers with red or white skin and Arikirangi was a grandchild of Toiroa, still to be born.

&quot;Te Kooti&quot; is understood to be his Christian baptismal name.

Te Kooti was apparently a very troublesome boy to his father, who tried to kill him. In 1852, he became notorious as one of a group of young Māori causing trouble in the Gisborne district. He took on the role of a &quot;social bandit&quot;, breaking into settlers&#x27; homes and stealing goods as part of a plunder party. He was sent to the Mission School at Whakatō, near Manutūkē. In 1846–1847 he was taught by Samuel Williams. Samuel and his uncle, William Williams &quot;helped the boy to find a new world in the Bible&quot;.

But his reputation was still suffering, also after contacts with the Reverend Thomas Samuel Grace, who was to replace William Williams for a few years (1850–1853). Local chiefs were asked by settlers to work with the local runanga (Māori council) to solve problems with Te Kooti but Te Kooti&#x27;s men persisted in taking pigs, horses, cattle and alcohol, angering the runanga run by senior chiefs. As a result, Te Kooti&#x27;s pā was attacked by Te Aitanga-a-Māhaki. Many prisoners were taken but Te Kooti escaped.

He had to leave home and went to sea on different ships that traded along the coasts of the North Island.

==Exile==
In 1865 while fighting with government forces to suppress the Pai Marire (or Hauhau cult), he was arrested as a spy while trying to contact his brother who was fighting with the Hauhau, and exiled to the Chatham Islands, together with the rebels he had been fighting against. He was never tried and took every opportunity to demand a trial. Some say he got his name from this, &quot;Kooti&quot; (pronounced [] like &quot;Courty&quot;), others that it was a Māori version of the last name &quot;Coates&quot;. If he did supply the Pai Marire with guns as is alleged, he also took part in a battle against them. There are allegations he fired blanks on this occasion.

While on the Chatham Islands Te Kooti experienced visions and became a religious leader. Te Kooti was referred to by other prisoners as Tawhaki, the twice born, after his unexpected survival from tuberculosis. He also performed some sleight of hand, such as using matchheads to set his hand on fire above the altar during a church service. These tricks swayed the Māori prisoners on Chatham Islands, and when some of the chiefs present on the island were sent back to the mainland, Te Kooti took advantage of the situation to become the local leader. Only Te Kooti&#x27;s uncle was not impressed by these tricks, which he saw right through. Nevertheless, Te Kooti established a faith named Ringatū (&quot;upraised hand&quot;) which gained many followers, and is still present in New Zealand society today.

During this time on the Chatham Islands, Te Kooti (or Te Koti as he signed in the documents) was married in a civil marriage to Maata Te Owai on 27 July 1867. The marriage documents reveal that he was born in 1832.

==Escape==
In 1868, expecting a resupply boat, Te Kooti prophesied that two boats would soon arrive to take them off the island. Normally the prisoners worked on a farm but using the excuse of rain a number of convicts were able to enter the redoubt. There were actually only 6 guards on the whole Island as the majority had been removed in April to Hokitika where a Fenian uprising was feared. On 4 July 1868, Te Kooti led an escape, and with 168 other prisoners seized the schooner &quot;Rifleman&quot;, with supplies and rifles, scuttled another vessel the &quot;Florence&quot; so that the alarm could not be raised and set off back to the North Island. One Chatham Island sergeant was killed because of a personal grievance. The Pākehā sailors were allowed to live and set sail for the coast of New Zealand with help from the Māori hijackers. The sailors attempted to sail towards Wellington, but with Te Kooti&#x27;s expertise at sailing were caught and told they would be thrown overboard if they did not keep a course for the East Coast. On the fourth day at sea, the ship was becalmed and Te Kooti declared that a sacrifice was needed. Te Kooti had his uncle, Te Warihi Otini, thrown overboard and soon afterwards the ship made headway again.

Upon their arrival at Whareongaonga in Poverty Bay, Te Kooti asked the Māori King Movement and the Tuhoe tribes for refuge but was rejected. He also sought dialogue with the colonial government but was rebuffed. He sent a statement to the effect that if the government wanted a war, he would give it to them in November.

==At war==
On 10 November 1868, Te Kooti and his followers attacked the township of Matawhero on the outskirts of Gisborne. Some 54 people were slaughtered, including women and children. The dead included 22 local Māori as well as European settlers. This was probably a revenge attack, motivated by Te Kooti&#x27;s imprisonment as a spy.

Te Kooti was then pursued by colonial and sympathetic Māori forces. His community was surrounded at Ngatapa and besieged, but Te Kooti and his warriors managed to escape.

From there, Te Kooti was chased to Te Pōrere where he set up a &quot;pā&quot;. He was defeated at the subsequent Battle of Te Pōrere. While Te Kooti escaped, he left many dead and wounded. Te Kooti himself was shot in the finger on his escape.

From there, Te Kooti escaped into the Urewera and made an alliance with the Tuhoe leadership.

From 1869 to 1872, Te Kooti and his followers raided throughout the central North Island while being pursued by their colonial and Māori enemies. His power was only broken once his Tuhoe allies were systematically conquered by his enemies. But once again Te Kooti managed to escape, this time to the King Country where he spent the next decade under the protection of the Māori King. Te Kooti used this time to develop his religion.

==Pardon and later life==
In 1878 Te Kooti was thrown out of a hui at Hikurangi, which had been called by the government, because he had broken the ban on alcohol that was enforced by King Tāwhiao. Te Kooti stormed out of the meeting and went into a wild rage. In the morning he returned covered in albatross feathers, shuffling and bent over, having taken on the persona of a shuffling old man. Te Kooti is portrayed in this narrative as Tawhaki, the twice born. He threw off his disguise and lightning flashed from his armpits. The feathers were to show divinely inspired peace, according to the story.

In 1883, Te Kooti was pardoned by the government and began to travel New Zealand. His followers grew and he decided to return to his old home. However, his past violence had not been forgotten and the local magistrate arrested him and imprisoned him, citing an anticipatory breach of the peace. Te Kooti was released on the condition that he never again try to return to his old home. Te Kooti appealed this decision, and was initially successful, but in 1890 the Court of Appeal ruled that the terror and alarm that Te Kooti&#x27;s reappearance would have entailed justified the magistrate&#x27;s decision.

<text>Betty Compson (born Eleanor Luicime Compson; March 19, 1897 – April 18, 1974) was an American actress and film producer who got her start during Hollywood&#x27;s silent era. She is best known for her performances in &quot;The Docks of New York&quot; and &quot;The Barker&quot;, the latter of which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

==Early life==
Compson was born on March 19, 1897, the daughter of Virgil and Mary ( Rauscher) Compson, in Beaver, Utah, at a mining camp. Her father was a mining engineer, a gold prospector, and a grocery store proprietor, and her mother was a maid in homes and in a hotel.

Compson graduated from Salt Lake High School. Her father died when she was young, and she obtained employment as a violinist at 16 at a theater in Salt Lake City.

==Career==
Playing in vaudeville sketches with touring circuits, Compson was noticed by Hollywood producers. While touring, she was discovered by comedic producer Al Christie and signed a contract with him. Her first silent film, &quot;Wanted, a Leading Lady&quot;, was in November 1915.

She made 25 films in 1916 alone, although all of them were shorts for Christie with the exception of one feature, &quot;Almost a Widow&quot;. She continued this pace of making numerous short films well into the middle of 1918 when after a long apprenticeship with Christie, she started making features exclusively. Compson&#x27;s star began to rise with the release of the 1919 feature &quot;The Miracle Man&quot; (1919) for George Loane Tucker. Paramount signed Compson to a five-year contract with the help of Tucker.

Her popularity allowed her to establish her own production company, which provided her creative control over screenplays and financing. Her first movie as producer was &quot;Prisoners of Love&quot; (1921). She played the role of Blanche Davis, a girl born to wealth and cursed by her inheritance of physical beauty. Compson selected Art Rosson to direct the feature. The story was chosen from a work by actress and writer Catherine Henry.

After completing &quot;The Woman With Four Faces&quot; (1923), Paramount refused to offer her a raise (her salary was $2,500 per week), and she refused to sign without one. Instead, she signed with a motion picture company in London. There she starred in a series of four films directed by Graham Cutts, a well-known English filmmaker.

The first of these was a movie version of an English play called &quot;Woman to Woman&quot; (1923), the screenplay for which was co-written by Cutts and Alfred Hitchcock. Part of &quot;The White Shadow&quot; (in which she played a dual role), another Cutts/Hitchcock collaboration. &quot;Woman to Woman&quot; proved to be popular enough for Jesse Lasky to offer top dollar to return to Paramount.

Back in Hollywood, she starred in &quot;The Enemy Sex&quot;, directed by James Cruze, as well as the sound film &quot;The Great Gabbo&quot; in 1929, with Eric von Stroheim--his first sound picture. Compson and Cruze were married in 1925; they divorced in 1929. Her contract with Paramount was not renewed, and she decided to freelance, working with lower-budget studios such as Columbia in &quot;The Belle of Broadway&quot; and Chadwick in &quot;The Ladybird&quot;. During this time, she was suggested as a replacement for difficult Greta Garbo in the MGM feature &quot;Flesh and the Devil&quot; opposite John Gilbert. She eventually worked for the studio with former &quot;The Miracle Man&quot; co-star Lon Chaney in &quot;The Big City&quot;.

In 1928, she appeared in a First National Pictures part-talkie, &quot;The Barker&quot;. Her performance as manipulative carnival girl Carrie garnered her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, although she lost to Mary Pickford in &quot;Coquette&quot;. In &quot;Court-Martial&quot;, a 1928 silent film, she became the first actress to portray Old West outlaw Belle Starr on film. In the same year, she appeared in the acclaimed Josef von Sternberg film &quot;The Docks of New York&quot; in a sympathetic portrayal of a suicidal prostitute.

These films caused Compson&#x27;s popularity to re-emerge, and she became a busy actress in the new talking cinema. In fact, Chaney offered her the female lead in his first talkie &quot;The Unholy Three&quot;, but she was too busy and instead suggested friend Lila Lee. Unlike a number of other female stars of silent film, it was felt that her voice recorded exceptionally well. Although she was not a singer, she appeared in a number of early musicals in which her singing voice was dubbed.

===Later career===
Now divorced from Cruze, Compson&#x27;s career continued to flourish, starring in nine films in 1930 alone. However, her last hit proved to be in &quot;The Spoilers&quot;, alongside Gary Cooper. She was unable to score a success and only secured roles in &quot;poverty row&quot; studios.

One major film in which she did not appear was &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;; although she shot a Technicolor screen test for the role of Belle Watling, she was not cast in the role. In 1941, Compson appeared in a small role in an Alfred Hitchcock film, &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;. Most of her later films were low-budget efforts. Compson&#x27;s last film was 1948&#x27;s &quot;Here Comes Trouble&quot;; after retiring from the screen, she began a cosmetic line and helped her husband run a business called Ashtrays Unlimited.

==Personal life==

After her marriage with Cruze ended, Compson married two more times. Her marriage to agent/producer Irving Weinberg ended in divorce, and her marriage to Silvius Gall ended with Gall&#x27;s death in 1962. She had no children.

==Death==
Compson died April 18, 1974, of a heart attack at her home in Glendale, California, aged 77. She was interred in San Fernando Mission Cemetery in San Fernando, California. For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Compson has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1751 Vine Street.

<text>A chapel (from , a diminutive of &quot;cappa&quot;, meaning &quot;little cape&quot;) is a Christian place of prayer and worship that is usually relatively small. The term has several meanings. First, smaller spaces inside a church that have their own altar are often called chapels; the Lady chapel is a common type of these. Second, a chapel is a place of worship, sometimes interfaith, that is part of a building, complex, or vessel with some other main purpose, such as a school, college, hospital, palace or large aristocratic house, castle, barracks, prison, funeral home, hotel, airport, or a military or commercial ship. Third, chapels are small places of worship, built as satellite sites by a church or monastery, for example in remote areas; these are often called a chapel of ease. A feature of all these types is that often no clergy were permanently resident or specifically attached to the chapel.

For historical reasons, &quot;chapel&quot; is also often the term used by independent or nonconformist denominations for their places of worship in England and especially in Wales, even where they are large and in practice they operate as a parish church.

The earliest Christian places of worship are now often referred to as chapels, as they were not dedicated buildings but rather a dedicated chamber within a building. Most larger churches had one or more secondary altars which, if they occupied a distinct space, would often be called a chapel. In Russian Orthodox tradition, the chapels were built underneath city gates, where most people could visit them; a famous example is the Iberian Chapel.

Although chapels frequently refer to Christian places of worship, they are also found in Jewish synagogues and do not necessarily denote a specific denomination. In England—where the Church of England is established by law—interdenominational or interfaith chapels in such institutions may be consecrated by the local Anglican bishop. Chapels that are not affiliated with a particular denomination are commonly encountered as part of a non-religious institution such as a hospital, airport, university or prison. Many military installations have chapels for the use of military personnel, normally under the leadership of a military chaplain.

==History==

The earliest Christian places of worship were not dedicated buildings but rather a dedicated chamber within a building, such as a room in an individual&#x27;s home. Here, one or two people could pray without being part of a communion or congregation. People who like to use chapels may find it peaceful and relaxing to be away from the stress of life, without other people moving around them.
The word &quot;chapel&quot;, like the associated word &quot;chaplain&quot;, is ultimately derived from Latin. More specifically, the word is derived from a relic of Saint Martin of Tours: traditional stories about Martin relate that while he was still a soldier, he cut his military cloak in half to give part to a beggar in need. The other half he wore over his shoulders as a &quot;small cape&quot; (). The beggar, the stories claim, was Christ in disguise, and Martin experienced a conversion of heart, becoming first a monk, then abbot, then bishop. This cape came into the possession of the Frankish kings, and they kept the relic with them as they did battle. The tent which kept the cape was called the &quot;capella&quot; and the priests who said daily Mass in the tent were known as the &quot;capellani&quot;. From these words, via Old French, we get the names &quot;chapel&quot; and &quot;chaplain&quot;.

The word also appears in the Irish language (Gaelic) in the Middle Ages, as Welsh people came with the Norman and Old English invaders to the island of Ireland. While the traditional Irish word for church was (derived from &quot;&quot;), a new word, &quot;séipéal&quot; (from &quot;cappella&quot;), came into usage.

In British history, &quot;chapel&quot; or &quot;meeting house&quot; were formerly the standard designations for church buildings belonging to independent or Nonconformist religious societies and their members. They were particularly associated with the pre-eminence of independent religious practice in rural parts of England and Wales, the northern industrial towns of the late 18th and 19th centuries, and centres of population close to but outside the City of London. As a result, &quot;chapel&quot; is sometimes used as an adjective in England and Wales to describe members of such churches: for example in the sentence, &quot;I&#x27;m Chapel.&quot;

===Types of chapel===

*A bridge chapel is a small place of Christian worship, built either on, or immediately adjacent to, a road bridge; they were commonly established during pre-Reformation mediaeval era in Europe.
*A castle chapel, in European architecture, is a chapel built within a castle.
*A parecclesion or parakklesion is a type of side chapel found in Byzantine architecture.
*A capilla posa (Posa chapel) is an architectural feature of the monastery-ensembles of Mexico in the 16th century, consisting of four vaulted quadrangular buildings located at the ends of the atrium outside them.
*A capilla abierta (open chapel) is one of the most distinct Mexican church construction forms, mostly built in the 16th century during the early colonial period.
*A proprietary chapel is one that originally belonged to a private individual. In the 19th century they were common, often being built to cope with urbanisation. Frequently they were established by evangelical philanthropists with a vision of spreading Christianity in cities whose needs could no longer be met by the parishes. Some functioned more privately, with a wealthy person building a chapel so that they could invite their favorite preachers. They are anomalies in the English ecclesiastical law, having no parish area, but being permitted to have an Anglican clergyman licensed there. Historically many Anglican churches were proprietary chapels. Over the years they have often been converted into normal parishes.
*A court chapel is a chapel as a musical ensemble associated with a royal or noble court. Most of these are royal (court) chapels, but when the ruler of the court is not a king, the more generic &quot;court chapel&quot; is used, for instance for an imperial court.
* A royal chapel is a chapel associated with a monarch, a royal court, or in a royal palace.

==Modern usage==

While the word &quot;chapel&quot; is not exclusively limited to Christian terminology, it is most often found in that context. Nonetheless, the word&#x27;s meaning can vary by denomination, and non-denominational chapels (sometimes called &quot;meditation rooms&quot;) can be found in many hospitals, airports, and even the United Nations headquarters. Chapels can also be found for worship in Judaism.

&quot;Chapel&quot; is in particularly common usage in the United Kingdom, and especially in Wales, for Nonconformist places of worship; and in Scotland and Ireland for Roman Catholic churches. In England and Wales, due to the rise in Nonconformist chapels during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, by the time of the 1851 census, more people attended the independent chapels than attended the state religion&#x27;s Anglican churches. (The Anglican Church does not function as the established church in Scotland.)

In Roman Catholic Church canon law, a chapel, technically called an &quot;oratory&quot;, is a building or part thereof dedicated to the celebration of services, particularly the Mass, which is not a parish church. This may be a private chapel, for the use of one person or a select group (a bishop&#x27;s private chapel, or the chapel of a convent, for instance); a semi-public oratory, which is partially available to the general public (a seminary chapel that welcomes visitors to services, for instance); or a public oratory (for instance, a hospital or university chapel).

Chapels that are built as part of a larger church are holy areas set aside for some specific use or purpose: for instance, many cathedrals and large churches have a &quot;Lady chapel&quot; in the apse, dedicated to the Virgin Mary; parish churches may have such a Lady chapel in a side aisle or a &quot;chapel of Reservation&quot; or &quot;Blessed Sacrament chapel&quot; where the consecrated bread of the Eucharist is kept in reserve between services, for the purpose of taking Holy Communion to the sick and housebound and, in some Christian traditions, for devotional purposes.

== Types ==
Common uses of the word chapel today include:

*Ambassador&#x27;s chapel – originally created to allow ambassadors from Catholic countries to worship whilst on duty in Protestant countries.
*Bishop&#x27;s chapel – in Anglican and Roman Catholic canon law, bishops have the right to have a chapel in their own home, even when travelling (such personal chapels may be granted only as a favor to other priests)
* Cappella gentilizia - a type of private mortuary chapel used for burials; commonly found in the cemeteries of Italy.
* Cemetery chapel also known as a &quot;Memorial chapel&quot; - an indoor venue in a cemetery where families, friends and clergy gather for funeral services including music, eulogies, pastoral prayers and meditation. It additionally protects them from rain, summertime heat or cold wintry weather. 
*Chapel of ease – constructed in large parishes to allow parishioners easy access to a church or chapel.
*Chapel of rest – not a place of worship as such, but a comfortably decorated room in a funeral director&#x27;s premises, where family and friends can view the deceased before a funeral.
*College chapel - located on college or university campuses that are or were once affiliated with a religion
*Family chapel - private chapel for royal families are other wealthy families.
*Funeral chapel – a venue for funerals or memorial services/celebrations of life/services of remembrance at a funeral home. In the case of cremation services, families and visitors would gather in a crematorium (&quot;crematory&quot; in the United States and Canada).
*Hospital chapel – location for praying for the sick or recently deceased.
*Lady chapel – really a form of side chapel, but notable separately as such chapels are common in the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion. They are dedicated to the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
*Mausoleum chapel also known as a Chapel mausoleum - an indoor venue designated within an urban cemetery featuring mausoleums where families, friends and clergy gather for funeral services including eulogies, pastoral prayers and meditation, but not music. It additionally keeps them from enduring weather conditions of summertime heat, cold wintry weather or rain. 
*Military chapel – U.S. military bases often have chapels designated for use by varying denominations. As no specific denomination or faith is the &quot;owner&quot;, such a site is commonly referred to as a chapel instead of a church, mosque, or synagogue. Service members can often receive services for nondenominational Christian, Roman Catholic, Islamic, and Jewish faiths, as well as information for other services in the local area.
*Multifaith chapel – found within hospitals, airports and universities, etc.; often converted from being exclusively Christian.
*Side-chapel – a chapel within a cathedral or larger church building.
*Summer chapel – a small church in a resort area that functions only during the summer when vacationers are present.
*Wayside chapel or country chapel – small chapels in the countryside
*Wedding chapel – a venue for weddings.

The first airport chapel was created in 1951 in Boston for airport workers but grew to include travelers. It was originally Catholic, but chapels today are often multifaith.

<text>Monday&#x27;s Warriors is a 1990 historical novel by New Zealand author Maurice Shadbolt. It is part two of his New Zealand Wars trilogy.

Set in mid-nineteenth century New Zealand, the story is a semi-fictionalized account of Titokowaru&#x27;s War, told from the perspective of Kimball Bent. Bent was an historical individual born in the United States, but had enlisted in the British army, where he was eventually posted to the Taranaki region of colonial New Zealand. Bent deserted and joined up with a local Māori chief of the Ngā Ruahine &quot;iwi&quot;, where he became accepted as a member of the local tribe. In 1867, Bent joined other Ngāti Ruanui led by Tītokowaru in their war against the colonists in Taranaki.

<text>So Long, Astoria is the fourth studio album by American rock band The Ataris, released on March 4, 2003. The album&#x27;s title song alludes to the 1985 film &quot;The Goonies&quot;, which is set in Astoria, Oregon.

==Background==
In February 2001, The Ataris released their third album &quot;End Is Forever&quot; through independent label Kung Fu Records. In May, vocalist/guitarist Kris Roe revealed that the group would start writing for their next album later in the year. In June, guitarist Marco Peña left the group due to creative and personal differences. He was replaced by their guitar tech John Collura, formerly of the band Beefcake. Roe said Collura &quot;definitely brought us back to [being the] best of friends&quot;, as well making them &quot;realize that this band has got a lot of life in it&quot;. Also in June, the group contributed a new track to the Warped Tour 2001 compilation, &quot;Looking Back on Today&quot;. The band signed with major label Columbia Records in July. Roe explained: &quot;We wanted to go somewhere where we knew that even if our record didn&#x27;t do well, that we would have a career still as a band&quot;.

Later in July, Roe revealed that the group would be releasing their next album in mid-2002 and that it would be in the musical style of their second album &quot;Blue Skies, Broken Hearts...Next 12 Exits&quot; (1999). In October, Roe said the album was tentatively titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Ever Compromise What You Believe&quot;. In December, the group said they had 13 songs that they were working on, and were planning to record in March 2002. In January 2002, the group contributed a new song to the &quot;Orange County&quot; soundtrack. In April, Roe said the group were expected to begin recording in May. When looking for producers, bassist Mike Davenport said a few names came up: &quot;Lou [Giordano] was always my choice. Ric Ocasek said [&#x27;]I don&#x27;t get it.&#x27; Mark Trombino told us to keep writing.&quot; Davenport pushed for Giordano, &quot;and the minute [Roe and Giordano] spoke, it worked.&quot; In early July, Roe said the album would be titled &quot;So Long, Astoria&quot;. Later that month, Giordano was enlisted as the album&#x27;s producer and that recording would finally occur in August.

==Recording==
Demos were initially tracked at drummer Chris Knapp&#x27;s house in Hollywood, California. Roe said they &quot;never got anything done&quot; and subsequently went to Orange Whip Recording in Santa Barbara, California to record more demos. With the aid of Angus Cooke and Thom Flowers, demos were recorded live-in-the-studio with minimal overdubs. Roe said they spent &quot;a lot of time fine tuning&quot; the songs before the album sessions. He added that the demos &quot;capture[d] a certain honesty&quot; and toyed with releasing the demos in lieu of recording a proper album. The group went into pre-production with Giordano, despite him thinking that the songs were &quot;already pretty complete &#x27;&quot;as is&#x27;&quot;, according to Roe. Recording began on August 19 and ended on November 1. Sessions took place at Ocean Studios in Burbank, California, Grandmaster Recorders in Hollywood, California and Orange Whip Recording.

Giordano produced all of the songs except for &quot;Looking Back on Today&quot;, which was produced by Thom Flowers, Elissa Meihsner and Eric Palmquist. Bradley Cooke, Andrew Alekel and Flowers acted as engineers with assistance from Jason Nelson, Dean Cupp and Dave Ashton. Giordano mixed all of the songs, except for &quot;The Saddest Song&quot; and &quot;My Reply&quot;, at Larrabee Studios in Hollywood, California. &quot;The Saddest Song&quot; and &quot;My Reply&quot; were mixed by Jack Joseph Puig. Additional tracking was done by Angus Cooke and Meihsner at Orange Whip Recording, while additional tracking was done by Ashton at Larrabee Studios. Several other people contributed to the album: James Muhawi (piano on &quot;The Saddest Song&quot;), Angus Cooke (cello), Jonathan Cox (programming), and Glen Phillips of Toad the Wet Sprocket, Mike Herrera of MxPx and Tim Pagnotta of Sugarcult (backing vocals).

==Composition==
Early in the writing process for the record, Roe found a book that gave him the theme for the album. The book, which was &quot;Go Now&quot; by Richard Hell, contained a chapter &quot;where he had a quote that said memories are better than life ... I wanted this record to portray, that life is only as good as the memories we make.&quot; Roe said the group &quot;focus[ed] on writing good songs [and] straightforward rock songs&quot;. Musically, the album&#x27;s sound has been described as pop punk, pop rock, punk rock and rock, drawing comparison to Blink-182, Green Day, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, Lit and A, with Roe sounding like A frontman Jason Perry. All of the songs were written by Roe, except for &quot;The Hero Dies in This One&quot; and &quot;All You Can Ever Learn Is What You Already Know&quot; by Roe, Collura, Davenport and Knapp, and &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; by Don Henley and Michael Campbell.

&quot;So Long, Astoria&quot; is about Roe writing songs in his bedroom in Anderson, Indiana. The track was reminiscent of Matchbox Twenty; its name is a reference to the town Astoria, Oregon in the film &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985). &quot;Takeoffs and Landings&quot; deals with saying goodbye to a long-distance partner. &quot;In This Diary&quot;, alongside &quot;Summer &#x27;79&quot; talk about nights out in town and pulling pranks. Discussing &quot;In This Diary&quot;, Roe said he attempted to &quot;encapsulate one of the most fun summers we’ve had&quot;. Roe wrote &quot;My Reply&quot; about a fan who was in a hospital and close to death. &quot;Unopened Letter to the World&quot; details the life of American poet Emily Dickinson. &quot;The Saddest Song&quot; is about Roe&#x27;s relationship with his estranged daughter and his upbringing without a father.

&quot;Summer &#x27;79&quot; sees Roe reminiscing on days when spent as a teenager sneaking into drive-in theatres and listening to Queen. &quot;The Hero Dies in This One&quot; refers to past girlfriends that had been left behind. Collura said &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; was included due to Roe&#x27;s nostalgia for it, and &quot;it just kind of fit into the rest of the record.&quot; He altered one line, switching a reference from Deadhead to Black Flag. &quot;Radio #2&quot; was indebted to &quot;Radio&quot; by Teenage Fanclub. Roe wrote &quot;Looking Back on Today&quot; about his wife, and called it the sole relationship-centric song on the album. Roe said &quot;Eight of Nine&quot; is about a number of &quot;really close calls that we&#x27;ve had with death.&quot;

==Release==
In October 2002, it was announced that &quot;So Long, Astoria&quot; would be released in March 2003. On January 12, the group posted the songs &quot;Takeoffs and Landings&quot; and &quot;In This Diary&quot; online. &quot;In This Diary&quot; was released to radio on February 11. &quot;So Long, Astoria&quot; was released on March 4 through Columbia Records. The Japanese version included the bonus tracks &quot;A Beautiful Mistake&quot; and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Spend Another Night Alone&quot;, an acoustic version of &quot;The Saddest Song&quot;, and a cover of the Ramones song &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll High School&quot;. A music video for &quot;In This Diary&quot; was posted online on March 3, directed by Steven Murashige. Roe said the video was mainly crowd-focused as the group wanted to channel their stage performance and energy. On May 19, &quot;In This Diary&quot; was released as a CD single. It featured &quot;A Beautiful Mistake&quot;, a demo of &quot;Eight of Nine&quot;, a live version of &quot;In This Diary&quot;, and &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll High School&quot; as B-sides.

&quot;My Reply&quot; was set to be the group&#x27;s next single, but &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; was released to radio on June 3 instead. This was a result of the K-Rock and KROQ radio stations playing the track, with others following shortly after. Collura said the group did not want to release the track as a single. He added that they were naïve to assume it would be released as such, since it wasn&#x27;t promoted as one, &quot;That was all American radio doing that on its own&quot;. Roe revealed Columbia Records had warned the band about including the track on the album in the first place as there would be &quot;a chance that somebody&#x27;s going to put it out as a single&quot;. The video treatment for the song&#x27;s music video, which was directed by Murashige, was initially intended for &quot;My Reply&quot; until it was adjusted for &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;. Roe said the video was about &quot;the story of a darker summer&quot; and features &quot;a girl trying to let go of a lot of the things she had in the summer.&quot;

The Ataris released their first video album &quot;Live at Capitol Milling&quot; in July 2003, which featured the music video for &quot;In This Diary&quot; (directed by Marc Smerling), the making-of video, and live performances taken from music video shoot. In August, Davenport revealed a music video had been filmed for &quot;My Reply&quot;, but was &quot;so far from coming out&quot;. He added, &quot;It&#x27;s animated, and it&#x27;s like A-ha meets White Stripes.&quot; On September 8, &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; was released as a CD single. It featured live versions of &quot;Takeoffs and Landings&quot; and &quot;Unopened Letter to the World&quot;, &quot;A Beautiful Mistake&quot; and an acoustic version of &quot;In This Diary&quot; as B-sides. &quot;The Saddest Song&quot; was released to radio on September 9. In February 2004, the band released the live album &quot;Live at the Metro&quot;, which had been recorded the previous October. In addition to the show, it featured acoustic renditions, one of which was from &quot;So Long, Astoria&quot;.

==Touring==
In November and December 2002, the group went on a US tour with Sugarcult, Autopilot Off and Rufio. During the tour, the group premiered material from &quot;So Long, Astoria&quot;. In late December and January 2003, the group embarked on the Australian leg of the Kung Fu Records Tour with the Vandals. The day following the album&#x27;s release, an in-store performance was held at a record store in Tempe, Arizona. However, due to 1,000 people showing up, the performance was moved to the Arizona State University campus. In mid-March, the band appeared on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Following this, they toured with the Juliana Theory and Further Seems Forever on a two-month tour of the US. On May 8, the band appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. In mid-June, the group performed at KROQ&#x27;s Weenie Roast festival.

From June to August, the Ataris toured as part of the 2003 Warped Tour. On July 11, the group appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. The group performed at the 2003 MLB All-Star Game in late July. In August and September, the band embarked on a European tour, with Matchbook Romance. In October and November 2003, the band embarked on the VW Music Ed Tour with Vendetta Red. In November, the group went on a US tour with Planes Mistaken for Stars, Vendetta Red, Hopesfall, The Go Reflex and Squirtgun. The group appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; on December 1 and December 29, respectively. In February and March 2004, the group went on a UK tour with Planes Mistaken for Stars and Cursive. In April, the group went on a tour of Canada.

<doc id="172029" wikidata="Q263977" url="?curid=172029" title="Jeanne Eagels">
<text>Jeanne Eagels (born Eugenia Eagles; June 26, 1890 – October 3, 1929) was an American stage and film actress. Eagels appeared in many Broadway productions, and in the emerging medium of sound films. She was posthumously nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her 1929 role in &quot;The Letter&quot; after dying suddenly that year at the age of 39.

==Early life==
Eugenia Eagles was the second of six children born to Edward, of German and French Huguenot descent, and his wife Julia Eagles (née Sullivan), who was of Irish descent. Her birth year – depending on the source – is given as 1888, 1890 (official bio year), 1891, 1892, 1893 (death certificate), or 1894. Jeanne, who later changed the spelling of her surname to &quot;Eagels&quot;, would later claim that her father was a Spanish architect and she was born in Boston. In reality, she was born in Kansas City, Missouri and her father was a carpenter. 

Eagels attended St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School and Morris Public School. She quit school shortly after her First Communion to work as a cash girl in a department store.

==Career==
Eagels began her acting career at a young age in Kansas City, appearing in a variety of small venues. She left Kansas City around the age of 15 and toured the midwestern U.S. with the Dubinsky Brothers&#x27; traveling theater show as a dancer. She later played the leading lady in several comedies and dramas put on by the Dubinskys, who later founded AMC Theatres. As a teenager, she married Maurice Dubinsky, who frequently played a villain.
Around 1911, she moved to New York City and worked in chorus lines. Her hair was brown, but she bleached it when she went to New York. During this period, one of her acting coaches was Beverley Sitgreaves. She was in the supporting cast of &quot;Mind the Paint Girl&quot; at the Lyceum Theatre in September 1912. Eagels played opposite George Arliss in three plays in 1916 and 1917.
In 1915, she appeared in her first motion picture. She also made three films for Thanhouser Film Corporation in 1916–17. In 1918, she appeared in &quot;Daddies&quot;, a David Belasco production. She quit this show due to illness and subsequently traveled to Europe. She appeared in several other Broadway shows between 1919 and 1921.

In 1922, she had her first starring role, in the play &quot;Rain&quot; by John Colton and Clemence Randolph, based on a short story by Somerset Maugham. In this, her favorite role, Eagels played Sadie Thompson, a free-wheeling and promiscuous spirit who confronts a fire-and-brimstone preacher on a South Pacific island. She went on tour with &quot;Rain&quot; for two more seasons and returned to Broadway to give a farewell performance in 1926.

In 1926, Eagels was offered the part of Roxie Hart in Maurine Dallas Watkins&#x27;s play &quot;Chicago&quot;, but she walked out during rehearsals. She next appeared in the comedy &quot;Her Cardboard Lover&quot; (1927) with Leslie Howard, touring for several months. After missing a few performances due to ptomaine poisoning, Eagels returned to the cast in July 1927 for an Empire Theater show.

After a season on Broadway, she took a break to make a movie. She appeared opposite John Gilbert in the MGM film &quot;Man, Woman and Sin&quot; (1927), directed by Monta Bell. In 1928, after failing to appear for a performance of &quot;Her Cardboard Lover&quot; in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Eagels was banned from the stage for 18 months by Actors Equity. The ban did not stop Eagels from working in film, and she made two sound films for Paramount Pictures, &quot;The Letter&quot; and &quot;Jealousy&quot;, both released in 1929.

==Personal life==
Eagels was married twice. Her first marriage was to actor Maurice Dubinsky whom she married when she was a teenager. The couple reportedly had a son who either died (causing Eagels to have a nervous breakdown) or who was placed for adoption after the couple separated. Eagels and Dubinsky eventually divorced. In August 1925, Eagels married Edward Harris &quot;Ted&quot; Coy, a former football star at Yale University who became a stockbroker. They had no children and divorced in July 1928.

==Death and legacy==
During the peak of her success, Eagels began abusing drugs and alcohol and eventually developed an addiction. She went to several sanatoriums in an effort to kick her dependency. By the mid-1920s, she had begun using heroin. When she entered her 30s, Eagels began suffering from bouts of ill health that were exacerbated by her excessive substance abuse.

In September 1929, Eagels underwent eye surgery at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in New York City. At the time, she was also suffering from breathing problems and neuritis. After a ten-day stay, Eagels returned to her apartment on Park Avenue. On October 3, 1929, Eagels and her secretary walked to the Park Avenue Hospital where Eagels had an appointment. While talking to the doctor, she began having convulsions and died shortly thereafter. The assistant chief medical examiner who performed Eagels&#x27; autopsy concluded that she died of &quot;alcoholic psychosis&quot;. The medical examiner stated that while Eagels had not consumed alcohol in the two days preceding her death, she had been &quot;acting strangely&quot; and suffering from hallucinations three or four days before she died. Toxicology reports revealed that Eagels still had alcohol in her organs when she died in addition to heroin and chloral hydrate (a sedative that Eagels regularly took to sleep). Her death was attributed to an overdose of the chloral hydrate.

After services in New York at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, Eagels received a second funeral service when her body was returned to Kansas City on October 7, where she was buried in Calvary Cemetery. She was survived by her mother Julia Eagles and several brothers and sisters.

Eagles was nominated posthumously for Best Actress for her role in &quot;The Letter&quot; at the 2nd Academy Awards in 1930. She was the first performer to be nominated by the Academy after her death, though hers, like all the nominations at the 2nd Academy Awards, was unofficial, being among several actresses &quot;under consideration&quot; by a board of judges.
In 1957, a mostly fictionalized film biography entitled &quot;Jeanne Eagels&quot; was made by Columbia Pictures, with Eagels portrayed by Kim Novak. Eagels&#x27; family sued Columbia over the way Eagels had been depicted in the movie.

<doc id="172030" wikidata="Q2070525" url="?curid=172030" title="Joe Cornish">
<text>Joseph Murray Cornish (born 20 December 1968) is an English comedian and filmmaker. With Adam Buxton, he forms the comedy duo Adam and Joe. In 2011, Cornish released his directorial debut &quot;Attack the Block&quot;. He also co-wrote &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with Steven Moffat and Edgar Wright, and &quot;Ant-Man&quot;, with Wright, Adam McKay, and Paul Rudd.

==Early life==
Cornish was educated at the independent Westminster School in central London, where he became friends with both Adam Buxton and Louis Theroux. At age 18, he went on to study at the Bournemouth Film School.

==Career==
===&quot;The Adam and Joe Show&quot;===

&quot;The Adam and Joe Show&quot; was an ironic pop culture sketch show written, presented and directed by the duo. The show found cult success during its four series between 1996 and 2001. The best-known segments featured hit feature films recreated with stuffed toys, British television shows parodied using &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figures, and Vinyl Justice, in which the pair invaded rock stars&#x27; homes and searched their record collections for embarrassing records.

Since the end of &quot;The Adam and Joe Show&quot;, Cornish has continued to work in British television and radio as a presenter, writer and director, both with and without Buxton. He wrote and presented the BBC Radio 4 film programme &quot;Back Row&quot; between 2002 and 2003.

In 2001, he fronted the topical discussion show &quot;This Week Only&quot;, alongside Nick Frost and Lauren Laverne.

In 2007, he and Buxton began presenting &quot;Adam and Joe&quot;, a radio show on BBC Radio 6 Music. This was put on hold during 2010 while Cornish directed &quot;Attack the Block&quot;; a new series began on Saturday 2 April 2011.

===Film and TV===
Cornish has made a number of behind the scenes documentaries/video diaries. They include Cornish following the making of &quot;Little Britain&quot; series 2, which was screened on BBC Three and is included on the &quot;Little Britain&quot; Series 2 DVD; a video diary of his brief cameo as a zombie, which appears on the UK &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; DVD; and &quot;Hot Fuzz: The Fuzzball Rally&quot;, where he followed his friends and collaborators, Edgar Wright, Nick Frost and Simon Pegg on the US press tour for their film &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;. There have been two cuts of the &quot;Fuzzball Rally&quot;: a 28-minute version was included on the &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; HD DVD (UK/US) and a 71-minute version was included on both the 3-Disc Collectors Edition DVD (US) and the Blu-ray Disc (US/UK) of &quot;Fuzz&quot;. The documentary caused the latter&#x27;s certification to be changed from a 15 certificate to an 18 certificate, due to the very strong language the documentary contains.

He made a brief appearance in &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; as a white suited and bemasked Scenes-of-Crime Officer named &quot;Bob&quot;. In 2017, he made a cameo in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; alongside Wright, where both played Resistance fighters.

In 2006, he was announced as co-writer on a feature film adaptation of the Marvel Comics comic book character &quot;Ant-Man&quot;, with &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; director Edgar Wright. Both Wright and Cornish received story by and screenplay credit on the finished film, after Wright&#x27;s departure from the project in 2014. Wright and Cornish also rewrote Steven Moffat&#x27;s script for &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; co-starring Simon Pegg, for Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson. In November 2013, Cornish was tipped to be J. J. Abrams&#x27; lead choice for director of the upcoming &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;. However, Roberto Orci was ultimately chosen to direct, before leaving the project in late 2014.

In December 2020, the thriller series &quot;Lockwood &amp; Co.&quot; was announced to be going to Netflix, adapted by Cornish.

Cornish has continued his work in television comedy, directing parts of the pilot of &quot;Modern Toss&quot;, and the pilot to Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Blunder&quot;. According to an interview in &quot;Word Magazine&quot;, he pulled out of directing the series of &quot;Blunder&quot; due to creative differences with Channel 4 and the production company. In early 2007, he directed the video for Charlotte Hatherley&#x27;s single &quot;I Want You to Know&quot;.

====&quot;Attack the Block&quot;====
On 13 May 2011, Optimum Releasing released &quot;Attack the Block&quot;, Cornish&#x27;s directorial debut, which was executive produced by his friend and collaborator, Edgar Wright, and produced by Film4, Big Talk Pictures, the UK Film Council and Optimum&#x27;s French parent company StudioCanal (which would later rebrand Optimum under their name four months after the film&#x27;s British release). The film is a science fiction action horror comedy set in South London that pitches a gang of youths against an alien invasion. The film initially had no US distributor, but after the reaction of the press and attendees at the SXSW premiere, the US rights were purchased by Screen Gems for theatrical release on 29 July 2011.

<doc id="172031" wikidata="Q1168233" url="?curid=172031" title="The Letter (1940 film)">
<text>The Letter is a 1940 American crime film noir melodrama directed by William Wyler, and starring Bette Davis, Herbert Marshall and James Stephenson. The screenplay by Howard E. Koch is based on the 1927 play of the same name by W. Somerset Maugham derived from his own short story. The play was first filmed in 1929, by director Jean de Limur. The story was inspired by a real-life scandal involving the Eurasian wife of the headmaster of a school in Kuala Lumpur who was convicted in a murder trial after shooting dead a male friend in April 1911. She was pardoned by the local sultan after a public furor.

==Plot==
Leslie Crosbie, the wife of a British rubber plantation manager in Malaya, shoots dead Geoffrey Hammond, a well-known member of the expatriate community. Leslie tells the servant to send for the new district officer and her husband Robert, who is loading rubber for shipment. Crosbie returns, delivered by his attorney, a close family friend. Leslie claims that she killed Hammond to save her honor.
She is placed under arrest, jailed in Singapore, and charged with murder. Her eventual acquittal seems a foregone conclusion, as the White community not only believes her story but feels she had acted heroically. Only the attorney, Howard Joyce, harbors suspicion. His clerk, Ong Chi Seng, tells him a letter exists that Leslie wrote to Hammond the day of the shooting, imploring him to come that night while Robert was away.

Ong tells Joyce that the original is in the possession of Hammond&#x27;s widow, a Eurasian woman who lives in the Chinese quarter. He shows Joyce a copy, revealing Leslie&#x27;s clear culpability in her ex-lover&#x27;s murder, and conveys that the original is for sale, at a staggering price. Joyce then confronts Leslie, who first denies then breaks down and confesses to having written it. She manipulates him into agreeing to buy it back despite the risk to his career.

Joyce tells Robert about the letter without divulging its content or true price, which will exhaust nearly all of Robert&#x27;s savings. Ong informs Joyce that Hammond&#x27;s widow demands Leslie come personally to make the payoff, so Joyce arranges for the court to have her released into his custody to &quot;regain her health&quot;.

In the Chinese quarter Leslie obtains the letter from the angry widow. She is acquitted.

In the aftermath of the trial Robert announces to Leslie and Joyce that he plans to buy a rubber plantation in Sumatra to give him and Leslie a fresh start. It will require all his savings, plus a mortgage, but he can hardly contain his excitement. Joyce informs him of the true cost of the letter, which Robert insists on reading. He is devastated to learn that Leslie had lied about the killing and had been unfaithful with Hammond for years.

As a party celebrating the acquittal gets underway, Leslie discovers a dagger on her porch which she recognizes from the shop where she retrieved the letter. Immediately aware of the implication, she nevertheless joins the party before retreating to her room to lose herself in her lacework. Robert brags to his friends about his Sumatran fantasy, but collapses in gin and misery.

Robert offers to forgive Leslie if she can swear her love to him. She does, but then abruptly confesses that she still loves Hammond.

Robert rushes from the room. Opening the door to the garden, Leslie sees the dagger is now gone. She recognizes the inevitability of her fate, and ghosts down the garden path toward it. Outside the gate, Leslie is grabbed from behind and held by her own manservant while Hammond&#x27;s widow stabs her with the dagger.

The two murderers attempt to slip away, but are stopped within steps by the flashlight of a policeman, who leads them silently away.

* James Stephenson as Howard Joyce
* Frieda Inescort as Dorothy Joyce
* Gale Sondergaard as Mrs. Hammond
* Bruce Lester as John Withers
* Elizabeth Earl as Adele Ainsworth

==Production==
The Production Code Administration rejected the original story adaptation that Warner Bros. submitted on the grounds that it contained adultery and unpunished murder, so a new final scene was added in which the widow Hammond takes her revenge. The character of Mrs. Hammond was also changed from Hammond&#x27;s Chinese mistress to his Eurasian wife to placate the Hays code.

Director William Wyler and star Bette Davis, who had previously worked together on &quot;Jezebel&quot;, disagreed about the climactic scene in which Leslie admits to her husband she still loves the man she murdered. Davis felt no woman could look at her husband when she admits such a thing. Wyler disagreed, and Davis walked off the set. She later returned and did it Wyler&#x27;s way, but ever after, Davis insisted her approach would have been better.

Wyler also argued with Warner Bros. head Jack L. Warner over the casting of British actor James Stephenson as attorney Howard Joyce. Warner originally had suggested Stephenson for the role, but after Wyler cast him, the studio head had second thoughts and thought the role was too important to cast an unknown in it. Wyler stood firm, and Stephenson&#x27;s performance earned him an Oscar nomination.

Herbert Marshall also appeared in the 1929 version, in which he plays the lover who is killed by Leslie. The 1940 film begins with the shooting. The 1929 version opens with the confrontation between Leslie and Geoff that preceded it.

==Reception==
The film was a huge hit with the public, and received seven Academy Award nominations (for Outstanding Production, Best Director, Best Actress (Davis), Best Supporting Actor (Stephenson), Best Cinematography – Black and White, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Score, but failed to win any.

===Critical response===
In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther observed, &quot;The ultimate credit for as taut and insinuating a melodrama as has come along this year — a film which extenuates tension like a grim inquisitor&#x27;s rack—must be given to Mr. Wyler. His hand is patent throughout . . . Miss Davis is a strangely cool and calculating killer who conducts herself with reserve and yet implies a deep confusion of emotions . . . Only the end of &quot;The Letter&quot; is weak — and that is because of the postscript which the Hays Office has compelled&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Never has [the W. Somerset Maugham play] been done with greater production values, a better all-around cast or finer direction. Its defect is its grimness. Director William Wyler, however, sets himself a tempo which is in rhythm with the Malay locale . . . Davis&#x27; frigidity at times seems to go even beyond the characterization. On the other hand, Marshall never falters. Virtually stealing these honors in the pic, however, is Stephenson as the attorney, while Sondergaard is the perfect mask-like threat&quot;.

&quot;Time Out London&quot; said in 2012, &quot;A superbly crafted melodrama, even if it never manages to top the moody montage with which it opens - moon scudding behind clouds, rubber dripping from a tree, coolies dozing in the compound, a startled cockatoo - as a shot rings out, a man staggers out onto the verandah, and Davis follows to empty her gun grimly into his body . . . [The] camerawork, almost worthy of Sternberg in its evocation of sultry Singapore nights and cool gin slings, is not matched by natural sounds (on the soundtrack Max Steiner&#x27;s score does a lot of busy underlining).

The film holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 8.40/10.

===Accolades===

<doc id="172033" wikidata="Q365664" url="?curid=172033" title="John Dickson Carr">
<text>John Dickson Carr (November 30, 1906 – February 27, 1977) was an American author of detective stories, who also published using the pseudonyms Carter Dickson, Carr Dickson, and Roger Fairbairn.

He lived in England for a number of years, and is often grouped among &quot;British-style&quot; mystery writers. Most (though not all) of his novels had English settings, especially country villages and estates, and English characters. His two best-known fictional detectives (Dr. Gideon Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale) were both English.

Carr is generally regarded as one of the greatest writers of so-called &quot;Golden Age&quot; mysteries; complex, plot-driven stories in which the puzzle is paramount. He was influenced in this regard by the works of Gaston Leroux and by the Father Brown stories of G. K. Chesterton. He was a master of the so-called locked room mystery, in which a detective solves apparently impossible crimes. The Dr. Fell mystery &quot;The Hollow Man&quot; (1935), usually considered Carr&#x27;s masterpiece, was selected in 1981 as the best locked-room mystery of all time by a panel of 17 mystery authors and reviewers. He also wrote a number of historical mysteries.

The son of Wooda Nicholas Carr, a U.S. congressman from Pennsylvania, Carr graduated from The Hill School in Pottstown in 1925 and Haverford College in 1929. During the early 1930s, he moved to England, where he married Clarice Cleaves, an Englishwoman. He began his mystery-writing career there, returning to the United States as an internationally known author in 1948.

In 1950, his biography of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle earned Carr the first of his two Special Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America; the second was awarded in 1970, in recognition of his 40-year career as a mystery writer. He was also presented the MWA&#x27;s Grand Master award in 1963. Carr was one of only two Americans ever admitted to the British Detection Club.

In early spring 1963, while living in Mamaroneck, New York, Carr suffered a stroke, which paralyzed his left side. He continued to write using one hand, and for several years contributed a regular column of mystery and detective book reviews, &quot;The Jury Box&quot;, to &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. Carr eventually relocated to Greenville, South Carolina, and died there of lung cancer on February 28, 1977.

==Dr. Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale==
Carr&#x27;s two major detective characters, Dr. Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale, are superficially quite similar. Both are large, upper-class, eccentric Englishmen somewhere between middle-aged and elderly. Dr. Fell, who is fat and walks only with the aid of two canes, was clearly modeled on the British writer G. K. Chesterton and is at all times civil and genial. He has a great mass of untidy hair that is often covered by a &quot;shovel hat&quot; and he generally wears a cape. He lives in a modest cottage and does not have any official association with public authorities.

Henry Merrivale or &quot;H.M.&quot;, on the other hand, although stout and with a majestic &quot;corporation&quot;, is active physically and is feared for his ill-temper and noisy rages. In a 1949 novel, &quot;A Graveyard To Let&quot;, for example, he demonstrates an unexpected talent for hitting baseballs improbable distances. A wealthy descendant of the &quot;oldest baronetcy&quot; in England, he is part of the Establishment (even though he frequently rails against it) and in the earlier novels is the director of the British Secret Service. In &quot;The Plague Court Murders&quot; he is said to be qualified as both a barrister and a medical doctor. Even in the earliest books the bald, bespectacled, and scowling H.M. is clearly a Churchillian figure and in the later novels this similarity is somewhat more consciously evoked. Many of the Merrivale novels, written using the Carter Dickson byline, rank with Carr&#x27;s best work, including the much-praised &quot;The Judas Window&quot; (1938).

Many of the Fell novels feature two or more different impossible crimes, including &quot;He Who Whispers&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Case of the Constant Suicides&quot; (1941). The novel &quot;The Crooked Hinge&quot; (1938) combines a seemingly impossible throat-slashing, witchcraft, a survivor of the ship &quot;Titanic&quot;, an eerie automaton modeled on Wolfgang von Kempelen&#x27;s chess player, and a case similar to that of the Tichborne Claimant into what is often cited as one of the greatest classics of detective fiction. But even Carr&#x27;s biographer, Douglas G. Greene, notes that the explanation, like many of Carr&#x27;s in other books, seriously stretches plausibility and the reader&#x27;s credulity.

Dr. Fell&#x27;s own discourse on locked room mysteries in chapter 17 of &quot;The Hollow Man&quot; is acclaimed critically and is sometimes printed as a stand-alone essay in its own right.

==Other works==
Besides Dr. Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale, Carr mysteries feature two other series detectives: Henri Bencolin and Colonel March.

A few of his novels do not feature a series detective. The most famous of these, &quot;The Burning Court&quot; (1937), involves witchcraft, poisoning, and a body that disappears from a sealed crypt in suburban Philadelphia; it was the basis for the French movie &quot;La chambre ardente&quot; (1962).

Carr wrote in the short story format as well. Julian Symons, in &quot;Bloody Murder: From the Detective Story to the Crime Novel: A History&quot; (1972), said: &quot;Most of Carr&#x27;s stories are compressed versions of his locked-room novels, and at times they benefit from the compression. Probably the best of them are in the Carter Dickson book, &quot;The Department of Queer Complaints&quot; (1940), although this does not include the brilliantly clever H.M. story &quot;The House in Goblin Wood&quot; or a successful pastiche which introduces Edgar Allan Poe as a detective.&quot;

During 1950, Carr wrote the novel, &quot;The Bride of Newgate&quot;, set during 1815 at the close of the Napoleonic Wars, &quot;one of the earliest historical mystery novels.&quot; &quot;The Devil in Velvet&quot; and &quot;Fire, Burn!&quot; are the two historical novels (involving also Time travel) with which he said he himself was most pleased. With Adrian Conan Doyle, the youngest son of Arthur Conan Doyle, Carr wrote Sherlock Holmes stories that were published in the 1954 collection &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. He was also honored by the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle by being asked to write the biography for the legendary author. The book, &quot;The Life of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&quot;, was published during 1949 and received generally favorable reviews for its vigor and entertaining style.

==Critical appraisal==
Dr. Fell has generally been considered to be Carr&#x27;s major creation. The British novelist Kingsley Amis, for instance, writes in his essay, &quot;My Favorite Sleuths&quot;, that Dr. Fell is one of the three great successors to Sherlock Holmes (the other two are Father Brown and Nero Wolfe) and that H.M., &quot;according to me is an old bore.&quot; This may be in part because in the Merrivale novels written after World War II, H.M. frequently became a comic caricature of himself, especially in the physical misadventures in which he found himself at least once in every novel. Humorous as these episodes were intended to be, they also tended to have the effect of decreasing the mystique of the character. Earlier, however, H.M. had been regarded more favorably by a number of critics. Howard Haycraft, author of the seminal &quot;Murder for Pleasure: The Life and Times of the Detective Story&quot;, wrote during 1941 that H.M. or &quot;The Old Man&quot; was &quot;the present writer&#x27;s admitted favorite among contemporary fictional sleuths&quot;. During 1938 the British mystery writer R. Philmore wrote in an article called &quot;Inquest on Detective Stories&quot; that Sir Henry was &quot;the most amusing of detectives&quot;. And further: &quot;Of course, H.M. is so much the best detective that, once having invented him, his creator could get away with any plot.&quot;

There is a book-length critical study by S. T. Joshi, &quot;John Dickson Carr: A Critical Study&quot; (1990) () and a chapter on Carr in Joshi&#x27;s book &quot;Varieties of Crime Fiction&quot; (2019) .

The definitive biography of Carr is by Douglas G. Greene, &quot;John Dickson Carr: The Man Who Explained Miracles&quot; (1995) (). From an obituary published in Greenville, South Carolina, Carr allegedly also published using the name of Fenton Carter, but no works by anyone of this name have yet been identified.

==Radio plays==
Carr also wrote many radio scripts, particularly for the &quot;Suspense&quot; radio anthology series in America and for its UK equivalent &quot;Appointment With Fear&quot; introduced by Valentine Dyall, as well as many other dramas for the BBC, and some screenplays. His 1943 half-hour radio play &quot;Cabin B-13&quot; was expanded into a series on CBS during 1948–49 for which Carr wrote all 23 scripts, basing some on earlier works or re-presenting devices that Chesterton had used. The 1943 play &quot;Cabin B-13&quot; was also expanded into the script for the 1953 movie &quot;Dangerous Crossing&quot;, directed by Joseph M. Newman and featuring Michael Rennie and Jeanne Crain. Carr worked extensively for BBC Radio during World War II, writing both mystery stories and propaganda scripts. During the late 1940s he hosted &quot;Murder by Experts&quot; transmitted by Mutual radio. He introduced works by other mystery writers who were the week&#x27;s guest writers. The show originated from Mutual&#x27;s main station WOR in New York City. Many of these shows are available for free listening or downloading at the Internet Archive.

==Film and television==
Carr&#x27;s works were the basis for several movies, including &quot;The Man With a Cloak&quot; (1951) and &quot;Dangerous Crossing&quot; (1953). &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Snuffbox&quot; was filmed as &quot;That Woman Opposite&quot; (1957), and &quot;La Chambre Ardente&quot; (1962) was a loose adaptation of &quot;The Burning Court&quot;.

Various Carr stories formed the basis for episodes of television series, particularly those without recurring characters such as &quot;General Motors Presents&quot;. Starting in 1954 the television series Colonel March of Scotland Yard, featuring Boris Karloff as Colonel March, based on Carr&#x27;s character and his stories, and was broadcast in the US for 26 episodes. It premiered in the UK the following year.

<text>Donald Serrell Thomas (18 July 1934 – 20 January 2022) was a British crime writer. His work primarily included Victorian-era historical, crime and detective fiction, as well as books on factual crime and criminals, in particular several academic books on the history of crime in London. He wrote a number of biographies, two volumes of poetry, and also edited volumes of poetry by John Dryden and the Pre-Raphaelites. He also wrote under the pseudonym Richard Manton.

==Biography==
Donald Thomas was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset on 18 July 1934. He was educated at Queen&#x27;s College, Taunton, before completing his National Service in the Royal Air Force (1953–1955) and then going up to Balliol College, Oxford (1955–1958). He held a personal chair as Professor Emeritus of English Literature at Cardiff University.

===Early works===
Thomas&#x27;s earliest works seem to have been in the area of legal and historical fact, notably revised texts of Thomas Bayly Howell&#x27;s collection of state trials, originally collected at the behest of William Cobbett and published between 1809 and 1826. Among his earliest forays into the world of fiction was &quot;Sergeant Verity and the Cracksman&quot;, 1974, published under the pseudonym Francis Selwyn. By the early 1980s, however, he had largely shed the Selwyn pseudonym (returning to it briefly in the late 1980s for some non-fiction works, and once in 2000, for another &quot;Verity&quot; novel), and began writing under his own name, Donald (S.) Thomas, switching from academic study and biography to Sherlockiana and crime fiction, all underpinned with his deep knowledge of the times and cultures of which he writes.

===Biographies and fact===
He wrote a number of books, mostly novels, on a variety of subjects predominantly set in Victorian England. He also wrote a small number of non-fiction works dealing with similar subjects/settings, among them a study of the Victorian underworld, and biographies of Robert Browning, the Marquis de Sade, Henry Fielding, and Lewis Carroll.

His 1978 (rev. ed. 2001) biography of Admiral Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald highlights the characteristics of that individual which served in large part as inspiration both for C. S. Forester&#x27;s Horatio Hornblower, and for Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Jack Aubrey. In 1994, his &quot;Hanged in Error?&quot; provided an overview/investigation as to the likely guilt of seven individuals all hanged in the UK before its abolition as a means of capital punishment in 1965. The book dealt with the cases of Timothy Evans, John Williams (alias George MacKay, hanged in 1913 for the fatal shooting of Inspector Arthur Walls in Eastbourne during a burglary attempt), Edith Thompson, Robert Hoolhouse, Neville Heath, Charles Jenkins (hanged in 1947 together with Christopher Geraghty for fatally shooting Alec de Antiquis following a botched London jewel robbery), and James Hanratty. (N.B. This is not the same as the similarly titled 1961 book &quot;Hanged in Error&quot; by Leslie Hale, which contains a different set of case histories.)

In academic circles, he is especially well known for his studies of the criminal underworld of London from Victorian times, through World War II to the Kray twins. He wrote seven biographies and a handful of other biographical studies, as well as fictionalised biographies of individuals such as Bonnie Prince Charlie. His biography of Lewis Carroll is recommended by &quot;Representative Poetry Online&quot;, and his other biographical works can be found on many academic reading lists.

He edited volumes of Everyman&#x27;s Library on poets ranging from John Dryden to the Post-Romantics, and also offered a translation of Michel Millot and Jean L&#x27;Ange&#x27;s bawdy 17th century novel &quot;L&#x27;École des filles&quot;, which is described as &quot;both an uninhibited manual of sexual technique and an erotic masterpiece of the first order&quot; on its back cover.

===Fiction===
In fiction terms, he is perhaps best known for his more recent works, in particular a series of Sherlock Holmes pastiches, beginning with 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Cases of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. He has also written a number of other titles, and three series featuring the main characters of:
:&quot;Alfred Swain&quot;, an inspector of Scotland Yard.
:&quot;Sonny Tarrant&quot;, a &quot;gangland capo&quot;, and
:&quot;Sgt. William Clarence Verity&quot;, a &quot;Sergeant in Scotland Yard&#x27;s &#x27;Private Clothes Detail&#x27;&quot; who investigates the Victorian criminal underground of London, c.1850.
(Verity was created under the pseudonym Francis Selwyn.) His other novels include &quot;The Raising of Lizzie Meek&quot;, &quot;based on the scandals surrounding the Victorian miracle-worker Father Ignatius of Capel-y-ffin&quot;. Thomas is represented by Bill Hamilton of A.M. Heath &amp; Company, Ltd.

===Later life and death===
Having retired from Cardiff University, he remained affiliated there, as an Associate Research Professor in the School of English, Communication and Philosophy. In 2005, as Personal Chair in the School of English, Communication and Philosophy at Cardiff University, he &quot;donated a selection of his personal archive of research papers, used in writing his series of acclaimed books on the Underworld in Victorian and World War II eras to the University [of Cardiff]&#x27;s Special Collections and Archives.&quot;

Some of his last works included a study on censorship in modern Britain, reviewed as &quot;provocative, timely and disturbing&quot; by Iain Finlayson in &quot;The Times&quot;.

Thomas died on 20 January 2022, at the age of 87.

==Awards and nominations==

As a poet, Thomas won the Eric Gregory Award in 1962 for his collection &quot;Points of Contact&quot;.
His biography of Robert Browning &quot;A Life Within Life&quot; was a runner-up for the Whitbread Prize, and his &quot;Victorian Underworld&quot; was shortlisted for the Gold Dagger Award.

<text>Larry Millett (born 1947 in Minneapolis, Minnesota) is an American journalist and author. He is the former (retired 2002) architectural critic for the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot;, a daily newspaper in Saint Paul, Minnesota and the author of several books on the history of architecture in Minnesota. He has also written a series of Sherlock Holmes mysteries set in the United States and Minnesota in the 1890s. The books feature the character Shadwell Rafferty who assists Holmes in his American investigations.

==Education==
Millett graduated from St. John&#x27;s University in Collegeville, Minnesota with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1969. He received a master&#x27;s degree in English in 1970 from the University of Chicago.

==Career==
Millett worked at the &quot;Pioneer Press&quot; from 1972 until 1984 when he had an opportunity to study architecture at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. When he returned to St. Paul in 1985, he became the newspaper&#x27;s first architecture critic. He has written articles for several historical and architectural magazines in the Midwest, mostly focusing on works by Prairie School architects including Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright.

Millett&#x27;s &quot;Lost Twin Cities&quot; is probably the best known of his works in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region largely because KTCA, a local public television station, created a video documentary by the same name which covered a few of the buildings in the book. The video was narrated by Dave Moore, a noted area TV journalist, and is often replayed when the station is running a pledge drive. In 2014, Millet was interviewed by Peter Shea for the Institute for Advanced Study at the University of Minnesota in the Twin Cities. Millett has also been interviewed twice on the Northern Lights Minnesota Author Interview TV Series.

<text>Laurie R. King (born September 19, 1952) is an American author best known for her detective fiction.

==Life and career==

Born in Oakland, California, King earned a degree in comparative religion from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1977 and a masters in theology from the Graduate Theological Union in 1984, where her thesis was on &quot;Feminine Aspects of Yahweh&quot;. She later received an honorary doctorate from the Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, California.

Among King&#x27;s books are the Mary Russell series of historical mysteries, featuring Sherlock Holmes as her mentor and later partner, and a series featuring Kate Martinelli, a lesbian police officer in San Francisco. Using the pseudonym &quot;Leigh Richards&quot;, she has published a science fiction novel, &quot;Califia&#x27;s Daughters&quot; (2004). Across those genres, she explores several humanist themes including the effects of war on soldiers as they attempt to find their place when returning home. This is seen in several of the Mary Russell novels and has been described in a comparison of the detectives in &quot;Keeping Watch&quot; (2003) and &quot;Touchstone&quot; (2007).
She lives in Watsonville, California, in the hills above Monterey Bay, southeast of Santa Cruz. From 1977 until his death in early 2009, she was married to the historian Noel Quinton King. They are the parents of two children.

==Awards==
King&#x27;s first book, &quot;A Grave Talent&quot; (1993), received the 1994 Edgar Award for Best First Novel and a 1995 John Creasey Memorial Award. This was followed by the 1996 Nero Award, for &quot;A Monstrous Regiment of Women&quot;, the 2002 Macavity Award for Best Novel, for &quot;Folly&quot;, the 2007 Lambda Award for Best Lesbian Mystery, for &quot;The Art of Detection,&quot; and the 2015 Agatha Award for Best Historical Novel, for &quot;Dreaming Spies&quot;. She has also been nominated for two Anthonys, a Barry, two additional Edgars, another Macavity, an Orange Prize, and four RT Reviewers&#x27; Choice Awards. In 2022, she won the Edgar Award&#x27;s &#x27;Grand Master&#x27; for her work.

She was inducted into membership of The Baker Street Irregulars in 2010.

<text>Alfred Emanuel Smith (December 30, 1873 – October 4, 1944) was the 42nd governor of New York, serving from 1919 to 1920 and again from 1923 to 1928. He was the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nominee in the 1928 presidential election, losing to Herbert Hoover of the Republican Party in a landslide.

The son of an Irish-American mother and a Civil War–veteran Italian-American father, true surname Ferraro, Smith was raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan near the Brooklyn Bridge. He resided in that neighborhood for his entire life. Although Smith remained personally untarnished by corruption, he—like many other New York Democrats—was linked to the notorious Tammany Hall political machine that controlled New York City politics during his era. Smith served in the New York State Assembly from 1904 to 1915 and held the position of Speaker of the Assembly in 1913. Smith also served as sheriff of New York County from 1916 to 1917. He was first elected governor of New York in 1918, lost his 1920 bid for re-election, and was elected governor again in 1922, 1924, and 1926. Smith was the foremost urban leader of the efficiency movement in the United States and was noted for achieving a wide range of reforms as the New York governor in the 1920s.

Smith was the first Roman Catholic to be nominated for president of the United States by a major party. His 1928 presidential candidacy mobilized both Catholic and anti-Catholic voters. Many Protestants (including German Lutherans and Southern Baptists) feared his candidacy, believing that the Pope in Rome would dictate his policies. Smith was also a committed &quot;wet&quot; (i.e., an opponent of Prohibition); as New York governor, he had repealed the state&#x27;s prohibition law. As a &quot;wet&quot;, Smith attracted voters who wanted beer, wine, and liquor and did not like dealing with criminal bootleggers, along with voters who were outraged that new criminal gangs had taken over the streets in most large and medium-sized cities. Incumbent Republican Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover was aided by national prosperity, the absence of American involvement in war, and anti-Catholic bigotry, and he defeated Smith in a landslide in 1928.

Smith then entered business in New York City, and became involved in the construction and promotion of the Empire State Building. He sought the 1932 Democratic presidential nomination but was defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt, his former ally and successor as governor of New York. During the Roosevelt presidency, Smith became an increasingly vocal opponent of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal.

==Early life==
Smith was born at 174 South Street and raised in the Fourth Ward on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1873; he resided there for his entire life. His mother, Catherine (née Mulvihill), was the daughter of Maria Marsh and Thomas Mulvihill, who were immigrants from County Westmeath, Ireland. His father, baptised Joseph Alfred Smith in 1839, was the son of Emanuel Smith, an Italian &quot;marinaro&quot; (sailor). The elder Alfred Smith (Anglicized name for Alfredo Emanuele Ferraro) was the son of Italian and German immigrants. He served with the 11th New York Fire Zouaves in the opening months of the Civil War.

Smith grew up with his family struggling financially in the Gilded Age; New York City matured and completed major infrastructure projects. The Brooklyn Bridge was being constructed nearby. &quot;The Brooklyn Bridge and I grew up together&quot;, Smith would later recall. His four grandparents were of ethnic German, Irish as well as Italian ancestry, but Smith identified more with the Irish-American community and became its leading spokesman in the 1920s.

His father Alfred owned a small trucking firm, but died when Smith was 13. Aged 14, Smith had to drop out of St. James parochial school to help support the family, and worked at a fish market for seven years. Prior to dropping out of school, he served as an altar boy, and was strongly influenced by the Catholic priests he worked with. He never attended high school or college, and claimed he learned about people by studying them at the Fulton Fish Market, where he worked for $12 per week. His acting skills made him a success on the amateur theater circuit. He became widely known, and developed the smooth oratorical style that characterized his political career. On May 6, 1900, Al Smith married Catherine Ann Dunn, with whom he had five children.

==Political career==

In his political career, Smith built on his working-class beginnings, identifying himself with immigrants and campaigning as a man of the people. Although indebted to the Tammany Hall political machine (and particularly to its boss, &quot;Silent&quot; Charlie Murphy), he remained untarnished by corruption and worked for the passage of progressive legislation. It was during his early unofficial jobs with Tammany Hall that he gained renown as an orator. Smith&#x27;s first political job was in 1895, as an investigator in the office of the Commissioner of Jurors as appointed by Tammany Hall.

During his time as the Governor of New York, Smith became known as a progressive; David Farber wrote that &quot;Smith became a strong and effective advocate of worker safety laws and championed, then and for years after, legislation aimed at giving workers more rights and protections against economic exploitation.&quot; He staunchly supported labor unions and pressed for protective legislation for the workers, stressing the need to expand the rights of working women in particular. A “New Era Progressive”, Smith advocated local governnment funded facilities and services such as hospitals, parks and schools in poor and working-class areas. Speaking of the role of the state in 1927, Smith said: &quot;The State is a living force. It must have the ability to clothe itself with human understanding of the daily, living needs of those whom it is created to serve.&quot; However, Smith envisioned a progressive vision based on state and local intervention, and decentralizing power to specific locales and communities. He was ambivalent with regard to federal economic intervention, which eventually led him to oppose the New Deal legislation.

===State legislature===

Smith was first elected to the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 2nd D.) in 1904, and was repeatedly elected to office, serving through 1915. After being approached by Frances Perkins, an activist to improve labor practices, Smith sought to improve the conditions of factory workers.

Smith served as vice chairman of the state commission appointed to investigate factory conditions after 146 workers died in the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Meeting the families of the deceased Triangle factory workers left a strong impression on him. Together with Perkins and Robert F. Wagner, Smith crusaded against dangerous and unhealthy workplace conditions and championed corrective legislation.

The Commission, chaired by State Senator Robert F. Wagner, held a series of widely publicized investigations around the state, interviewing 222 witnesses and taking 3,500 pages of testimony. They hired field agents to do on-site inspections of factories. Starting with the issue of fire safety, they studied broader issues of the risks of injury in the factory environment. Their findings led to thirty-eight new laws regulating labor in New York State, and gave each of them a reputation as leading progressive reformers working on behalf of the working class. In the process, they changed Tammany&#x27;s reputation from mere corruption to progressive endeavors to help the workers. New York City&#x27;s Fire Chief John Kenlon told the investigators that his department had identified more than 200 factories where conditions resulted in risk of a fire like that at the Triangle Factory.

The State Commission&#x27;s reports led to the modernization of the state&#x27;s labor laws, making New York State &quot;one of the most progressive states in terms of labor reform.&quot; New laws mandated better building access and egress, fireproofing requirements, the availability of fire extinguishers, the installation of alarm systems and automatic sprinklers, better eating and toilet facilities for workers, and limited the number of hours that women and children could work. In the years from 1911 to 1913, sixty of the sixty-four new laws recommended by the Commission were legislated with the support of Governor William Sulzer.

In 1911, the Democrats obtained a majority of seats in the State Assembly, and Smith became Majority Leader and Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. The following year, following the loss of the majority, he became the Minority Leader. When the Democrats reclaimed the majority after the next election, he was elected Speaker for the 1913 session. He became Minority Leader again in 1914 and 1915. In November 1915, he was elected Sheriff of New York County, New York. By now he was a leader of the Progressive movement in New York City and state. His campaign manager and top aide was Belle Moskowitz, a daughter of Jewish immigrants.

===Governor (1919–1920, 1923–1928)===
After serving in the patronage-rich job of sheriff of New York County beginning in 1916, Smith was elected governor of New York in 1918 with the help of Tammany Boss Charles F. Murphy and James A. Farley, who brought Smith the upstate vote.

In 1919, Smith gave the famous speech &quot;A man as low and mean as I can picture&quot;, making a drastic break with publisher William Randolph Hearst. Hearst, known for his notoriously sensationalist and largely left-wing position in the state Democratic Party, was the leader of its populist wing in the city. He had combined with Tammany Hall in electing the local administration, and had attacked Smith for starving children by not reducing the cost of milk.

Smith lost his bid for re-election in the 1920 New York gubernatorial election, but was again elected governor in 1922, 1924 and 1926, with Farley managing his campaign. In his 1922 re-election, he embraced his position as an anti-prohibitionist. Smith offered alcohol to guests at the Executive Mansion in Albany, and repealed the state&#x27;s Prohibition enforcement statute, the Mullan-Gage law.

As governor, Smith became known nationally as a progressive who sought to make government more efficient and more effective in meeting social needs. Smith&#x27;s young assistant Robert Moses built the nation&#x27;s first state park system and reformed the civil service, later gaining appointment as Secretary of State of New York. During Smith&#x27;s time in office, New York strengthened laws governing workers&#x27; compensation, women&#x27;s pensions and children and women&#x27;s labor with the help of Frances Perkins, soon to be President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Labor Secretary.

===1924 presidential election===

In 1924, Smith unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for president, advancing the cause of civil liberty by decrying lynching and racial violence. Roosevelt delivered the nominating speech for Smith at the 1924 Democratic National Convention in which he saluted Smith as &quot;the Happy Warrior of the political battlefield.&quot; Smith represented the urban, east coast wing of the party as an anti-prohibition &quot;wet&quot; candidate, while his main rival for the nomination, President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s son-in-law William Gibbs McAdoo, a former Secretary of the Treasury, stood for the more rural tradition and prohibition &quot;dry&quot; candidacy. The party was hopelessly split between the two. An increasingly chaotic convention balloted 100 times before both men accepted that neither would be able to win the required two-thirds of the votes, and so each withdrew. On the 103rd ballot, the exhausted party nominated the little-known candidate John W. Davis of West Virginia, a former congressman and United States Ambassador to Great Britain who had been a dark horse presidential candidate in 1920. Davis lost the election by a landslide to the Republican Calvin Coolidge, who won in part because of the prosperous times.

Undeterred, Smith returned to fight a determined campaign for the party&#x27;s nomination in 1928. He was aided by the endorsement of Philip La Follette, son of 1924 Progressive Party presidential candidate Robert M. La Follette, who died in 1925 seven months after receiving 16.62 percent of the popular vote—the fifth-highest proportion for any third-party presidential candidate.

===1928 presidential election===

Reporter Frederick William Wile made the oft-repeated observation that Smith was defeated by &quot;the three P&#x27;s: Prohibition, Prejudice and Prosperity&quot;. The Republican Party was still benefiting from an economic boom, as well as a failure to reapportion Congress and the electoral college following the 1920 census, which had registered a 15 percent increase in the urban population. The party was biased toward small-town and rural areas. Its presidential candidate Herbert Hoover, who headed the Census of 1920, did little to alter this state of affairs.

Historians agree that prosperity, along with widespread anti-Catholic sentiment against Smith, made Hoover&#x27;s election inevitable. He defeated Smith by a landslide in the 1928 United States presidential election, carrying five Southern states via crossover voting by conservative white Democrats.

The fact that Smith was Catholic and the descendant of Catholic immigrants was instrumental in his loss of the election of 1928. Historical hostilities between Protestants and Catholics had been carried by national groups to the United States by immigrants, and centuries of Protestant domination allowed myths and superstitions about Catholicism to flourish. Long-established Protestants had viewed the waves of Catholic immigrants from Ireland, Italy and Eastern Europe since the mid-19th century with suspicion. In addition, many Protestants carried old fears related to extravagant claims of one religion against the other which dated back to the European wars of religion. They feared that Smith would answer to the Pope rather than the United States Constitution.

Scott Farris notes that the anti-Catholicism of the American society was the sole reason behind Smith&#x27;s defeat, as even contemporary Prohibition activists would admit that their main problem with the Democratic candidate was his faith and not any political view. Bob Jones Sr., a prominent Protestant pastor in South Carolina, said: A Methodist newspaper in Georgia called Catholicism &quot;a degenerate type of Christianity,&quot; while Southern Baptist newspapers ordered their readers to vote against Smith, claiming that he would close down Protestant churches, end freedom of worship and prohibit reading the Bible. Charles Hillman Fountain, a Protestant writer, insisted that Catholics should be barred from holding any office. Farris states that &quot;More disturbing than the ridiculous and the dangerous was the respectable anti-Catholicism&quot;, as contemporary newspapers and Protestant churches tried to mask their anti-Catholicism as genuine concern. Protestant activists insisted that Catholicism represents an alien culture and medieval mentality, claiming that Catholicism is incompatible with American democracy and institutions.

Catholics were portrayed as reactionary despite being more left-wing than mainstream American Protestant congregations at the time. William Allen White, a renowned newspaper editor, warned that Catholicism would erode the moral standards of America, saying that &quot;the whole Puritan civilization which has built a sturdy, orderly nation is threatened by Smith.&quot; While Herbert Hoover avoided raising the issue of Catholicism on the campaign trail, he defended the Protestant actions in a private letter:

White rural conservatives in the South also believed that Smith&#x27;s close association with Tammany Hall, the Democratic machine in Manhattan, showed that he tolerated corruption in government, while they overlooked their own brands of it. Another major controversial issue was the continuation of Prohibition, the enforcement of which was widely considered problematic. Smith personally favored the relaxation or repeal of Prohibition laws because they had given rise to more criminality. The Democratic Party split North and South on the issue, with the more rural South continuing to favor Prohibition. During the campaign, Smith tried to duck the issue with non-committal statements.

Smith was an articulate proponent of good government and efficiency, as was Hoover. Smith swept the entire Catholic vote, which in 1920 and 1924 had been split between the parties; he attracted millions of Catholics, generally ethnic whites, to the polls for the first time, especially women, who were first allowed to vote in 1920. He lost important Democratic constituencies in the rural North as well as in Southern cities and suburbs. Smith did retain the loyalty of the Deep South, thanks in part to the appeal of his running mate, Senator Joseph Robinson from Arkansas, but lost five states of the Rim South to Hoover. Smith carried the popular vote in each of America&#x27;s ten most populous cities, an indication of the rising power of the urban areas and their new demographics.

Smith was not a very good campaigner. His campaign theme song, &quot;The Sidewalks of New York&quot;, had little appeal among rural Americans, who also found his &#x27;city&#x27; accent slightly foreign when heard on radio. Smith narrowly lost his home state; New York&#x27;s electors were biased in favor of rural upstate and largely Protestant districts. However, in 1928 his fellow Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt (a Protestant of Dutch old-line stock) was elected to replace him as governor of New York. Farley left Smith&#x27;s camp to run Roosevelt&#x27;s successful campaign for governor in 1928, and then Roosevelt&#x27;s successful campaigns for the Presidency in 1932 and 1936.

====Voter realignment====
Some political scientists believe that the 1928 election started a voter realignment that helped develop Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal coalition. One political scientist said, &quot;...not until 1928, with the nomination of Al Smith, a northeastern reformer, did Democrats make gains among the urban, blue-collar and Catholic voters who were later to become core components of the New Deal coalition and break the pattern of minimal class polarization that had characterized the Fourth Party System.&quot; However, historian Allan Lichtman&#x27;s quantitative analysis suggests that the 1928 results were based largely on religion and are not a useful barometer of the voting patterns of the New Deal era.

Lichtman notes that the sole defining issue of the election was anti-Catholicism, which radically realigned states&#x27; voting patterns. States that had never voted Republican after Reconstruction such as Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia voted for Hoover, while Smith carried Massachusetts and Rhode Island—states that had never voted Democratic before save for 1912. Lichtman further proves this by pointing out that Smith and Hoover had very similar political views save for religion and Prohibition, and yet the 1928 election had a turnout of 57%, despite previous 1920s American elections having their turnouts below 50%.

Christopher M. Finan (2003) says Smith is an underestimated symbol of the changing nature of American politics in the first half of the last century. He represented the rising ambitions of urban, industrial America at a time when the hegemony of rural, agrarian America was in decline, although many states had legislatures and congressional delegations biased toward rural areas because of lack of redistricting after censuses. Smith was connected to the hopes and aspirations of immigrants, especially Catholics and Jews from eastern and southern Europe. Smith was a devout Catholic, but his struggles against religious bigotry were often misinterpreted when he fought the religiously inspired Protestant morality imposed by prohibitionists.

The 1928 election initiated a complete voter realignment of African-Americans, who overwhelmingly supported the Republican Party prior to 1928. Hoover sought &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; for the election, and sided with the segregationist lily-white Republicans at the expense of the pro-civil rights black and tans. Prominent African Americans were removed from positions of leadership in the Republican Party and replaced with lily-white Republicans in order to appeal to the segregationist South, and Hoover&#x27;s spokesmen in the South spoke of his commitment to white supremacy. Allan Lichtman wrote that Hoover &quot;sought a permanent reorganization of southern Republicanism under the leadership of white racists.&quot; This action was taken to exploit the unpopularity of Smith in the South, as Hoover and his cabinet were &quot;convinced that white Southern votes were more essential to a Hoover win than black ones&quot;. Hoover assured Southern voters that he &quot;had no intention of appointing colored men&quot; and pledged that he had &quot;no intention—party platform notwithstanding—of foisting off an anti-lynch law on the white South&quot;; at the same time, Hoover heavily emphasized &quot;his rural-Protestant roots&quot; and appealed to the white voters&#x27; anti-urban and anti-Catholic sentiments, while also portraying Smith as a pro-civil rights candidate. According to &quot;Phylon&quot;, apart from the Catholics&#x27; perceived allegiance to the Pope over the United States, American anti-Catholicism was also racially motivated, as Southern Protestants &quot;strongly opposed the church&#x27;s liberal policies—particularly its uncompromising position against social and political segregation.&quot;

Al Smith was supportive of racial equality and appointed African Americans to the New York City school system and civil service commission. Major black newspapers throughout the United States such as &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;, &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot; and &quot;Norfolk Journal and Guide&quot; endorsed Smith for president, and prominent members of the NAACP supported Smith, with Walter Francis White writing that &quot;Governor Smith is by far the best man available for the Presidency&quot; and arguing that Smith&#x27;s &quot;nomination and election would be the greatest blow at bigotry that has ever been struck.&quot; Smith attracted the attention of disheartened African-American voters, as he was unpopular in the South, faced prejudice as a Roman Catholic, and had a reputation of a &quot;spokesman for ethnic minorities in Northern cities&quot;. As such, Smith&#x27;s candidacy, coupled with Hoover&#x27;s Southern concession, initiated abandonment of loyalty to the Republicans and embrace of the Democratic Party by African-American voters. Samuel O&#x27;Dell wrote in &quot;Phylon&quot; that 1928 black voters &quot;bolted to the Democratic party in unprecedented numbers.&quot;

Smith was also known as an economic progressive, and championed progressive reforms such as a shorter workweek, workers&#x27; compensation laws, as well as health and workplace safety reforms. Many of his reforms later inspired the New Deal, even though Smith himself came to oppose the New Deal legislation. A hallmark of Smith&#x27;s progressivism was his support for and extensive ties to New York labor unions; Smith believed that workers need to be protected from economic exploitation, and became known for legislation that expanded the power of labor unions, enhanced safety regulations, and provided essential services such as healthcare and education to impoverished neighbourhoods and working-class communities. However, Smith said little about his economic progressivism on the 1928 campaign trail, as the public was largely supportive of the conservative economic vision that the incumbent Republican administration pursued, crediting it with the economic prosperity at the time.

===Opposition to Roosevelt and the New Deal===
Smith felt slighted by Roosevelt during the latter&#x27;s governorship. They became rivals in the 1932 Democratic Party presidential primaries after Smith decided to run for the nomination against Roosevelt, the presumed favorite. At the convention, Smith&#x27;s animosity toward Roosevelt was so great that he put aside longstanding rivalries to work with McAdoo and Hearst to block Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination for several ballots. That coalition fell apart when Smith refused to work on finding a compromise candidate; instead, he maneuvered to become the nominee. After losing the nomination, Smith eventually campaigned for Roosevelt in 1932, giving a particularly important speech on behalf of the Democratic nominee at Boston on October 27 in which he &quot;pulled out all the stops&quot;.

Smith became highly critical of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies, which he deemed a betrayal of good-government progressive ideals and ran counter to the goal of close cooperation with business. Smith joined the American Liberty League, an organization founded by conservative Democrats who disapproved of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal measures and tried to rally public opinion against the New Deal. The League published pamphlets and sponsored radio programs, arguing that the New Deal was destroying personal liberty; however, the League failed to gain support in the 1934 or 1936 elections and rapidly declined in influence. It was officially dissolved in 1940. Smith&#x27;s antipathy to Roosevelt and his policies was so great that he supported Republican presidential nominees Alf Landon in the 1936 election and Wendell Willkie in the 1940 election.

According to Jonathan Alter, the reasons for Smith&#x27;s opposition to Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal were principally personal rather than ideological. Roosevelt wronged Smith in 1931 by opposing the proposal for an unequivocal stand for repeal of Prohibition postulated by Smith and his Northern progressive wing of the party. Moreover, many of Smith&#x27;s proposals and policies from his time as governor of New York were expanded and turned into federal legislation within the New Deal, leading Smith to believe that Roosevelt stole his ideas and was taking credit for them at his expense. Speaking of Roosevelt in 1932, Smith proclaimed: &quot;Frank Roosevelt just threw me out of a window.&quot; Smith later abandoned his criticism of the New Deal once Roosevelt arranged for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to rent space in the Empire State Building, which eased Smith&#x27;s financial problems. Shortly before his death in 1944, Smith changed his view of Roosevelt completely, speaking to a reporter: &quot;He [Roosevelt] was the kindest man who ever lived, but don&#x27;t get in his way.&quot;

Although personal resentment was one factor in Smith&#x27;s break with Roosevelt and the New Deal, Christopher Finan (2003) argues that Smith was consistent in his beliefs and politics—suggesting that Smith always believed in social mobility, economic opportunity, religious tolerance, and individualism. Historian David Farber argues that while Smith was always a &quot;firm believer in the use of government to right wrongs&quot;, his vision was ultimately based on decentralizing power to the states and local communities, which would have pursued public ownership and economic interventionism on local and regional level. Smith was also far less supportive of direct federal intervention, on which &quot;he was ambivalent, even uncertain.&quot; Despite the break between the men, Smith and Eleanor Roosevelt remained close. In 1936, while Smith was in Washington, D.C., making a vehement radio attack on the President, she invited him to stay at the White House. To avoid embarrassing the Roosevelts, he declined. Historian Robert Slayton observes that Smith and Roosevelt did not reconcile until a brief meeting in June 1941, and he also suggests that during the early 1940s the antipathy which Smith held toward his former ally had waned. Upon the death of Smith&#x27;s wife Katie in May 1944, Roosevelt sent Smith a note of personal condolence. Smith&#x27;s grandchildren later recalled that he was greatly touched by it.

==Business life and later years==

After the 1928 election, Smith became the president of Empire State, Inc., the corporation that built and operated the Empire State Building. Construction for the building symbolically began on March 17, 1930, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, per Smith&#x27;s instructions. Smith&#x27;s grandchildren cut the ribbon when the world&#x27;s tallest skyscraper opened on May 1, 1931, which was May Day, an international labor celebration. Its construction had been completed in only 13 months, a record for such a large project.

As with the Brooklyn Bridge, which Smith had seen being built from his Lower East Side boyhood home, the Empire State Building was both a vision and an achievement that had been constructed by combining the interests of all, rather than being divided by the interests of a few. Smith continued to promote the Empire State Building, which was derided as the &quot;Empty State Building&quot; due to a lack of tenants, in the years following its construction.

In 1929, Smith was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, considered the most prestigious award for American Catholics.
In 1929 Smith was elected President of the Board of Trustees of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. Knowing his fondness for animals, in 1934 Robert Moses made Al Smith the Honorary Night Zookeeper of the newly renovated Central Park Zoo. Though a ceremonial title, Smith was given keys to the zoo and often took guests to see the animals after hours.

Smith was an early and vocal critic of the Nazi regime in Germany. He supported the Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933 and addressed a mass-meeting at Madison Square Garden against Nazism that March. His speech was included in the 1934 anthology &quot;Nazism: An Assault on Civilization&quot;. In 1938, Smith took to the airwaves to denounce Nazi brutality in the wake of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. His words were published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; article &quot;Text of the Catholic Protest Broadcast&quot; of November 17, 1938.

Like most New York City businessmen, Smith enthusiastically supported American military involvement in World War II. Although he was not asked by Roosevelt to play any role in the war effort, Smith was an active and vocal proponent of FDR&#x27;s attempts to amend the Neutrality Act in order to allow &quot;Cash and Carry&quot; sales of war equipment to be made to the British. Smith spoke on behalf of the policy in October 1939, to which FDR responded directly: &quot;Very many thanks. You were grand.&quot;

In 1939 Smith was appointed a Papal Chamberlain of the Sword and Cape, one of the highest honors which the Papacy bestowed on a layman.

Smith died at the Rockefeller Institute Hospital on October 4, 1944, of a heart attack, at the age of 70. He had been broken-hearted over the death of his wife from cancer five months earlier, on May 4, 1944. He is interred at Calvary Cemetery.

===Popular culture and commemorations===
* Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt were filmed by Lee de Forest in his DeForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process during the 1924 Democratic National Convention, which ran from June 21 to July 9. This film is now in the Maurice Zouary collection at the Library of Congress.
* In Sinclair Lewis&#x27; 1928 novel &quot;The Man Who Knew Coolidge&quot;, Smith is cited as an example of the opportunities &quot;in this new and increasingly practical America for any bright fellow today!&quot; 
* A song entitled &quot;He&#x27;s Our Al&quot; was dedicated for Smith in 1928, written by A. Seymour Brown and Albert Von Tilzer.
* The Al Smith Dinner, first held in 1945 by the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation, is an annual dinner to raise funds for Catholic charities in New York. It was typically attended by presidential candidates for much of the 20th century, however has become less influential in modern times.
* In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s alternate history &quot;Southern Victory&quot; series, in which the Confederate States of America wins the American Civil War in 1862, Al Smith is elected President of the United States in 1936 on the Socialist Party ticket, defeating Democratic incumbent Herbert Hoover. As per the Richmond Agreement with Confederate President Jake Featherston, he allowed plebiscites to be held in the states of Kentucky, Sequoyah and Houston on re-admittance to the Confederacy; the rejection of readmittance in Sequoyah serves as a casus belli for the Second Great War in North America (1941–1944). Smith serves until 1942, when he is killed in a bombing raid on the Powel House in Philadelphia and is succeeded by his Vice President Charles W. La Follette (the fictional son of Robert M. La Follette).
* Smith was portrayed by Alan Bunce in the 1960 film &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot;, and by Wilbur Fitzgerald in HBO&#x27;s 2005 TV-movie &quot;Warm Springs&quot;. Both of these movies focus on Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s struggle with polio.

<text>Chelsea Quinn Yarbro (born September 15, 1942) is an American writer. She is known for her series of historical horror novels about the vampire Count Saint-Germain.

==Biography==
Yarbro was born in Berkeley, California. She attended Berkeley schools through high school followed by three years at San Francisco State College (now University).

In November 1969 she married Donald Simpson and divorced in February 1982. She has no children.

Writing for over 45 years, Yarbro has worked in a wide variety of genres, from science fiction to westerns, from young adult adventure to historical horror. She is the author of over 70 novels and numerous short stories. In addition to the Count Saint-Germain novels, she also has published numerous volumes in a popular series of channeled wisdom from the entity Michael in the Messages from Michael series.

Yarbro&#x27;s contribution to the horror genre has been recognised in a variety of ways: she was named a Grand Master at the World Horror Convention in 2003, and in 2005 the International Horror Guild named her a &quot;Living Legend&quot;. She has received the Knightly Order of the Brasov Citadel from the Transylvanian Society of Dracula. In 2009 the Horror Writers&#x27; Association presented Yarbro with the Bram Stoker Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2014, she was honored with the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement. Additionally, two of her novels, &quot;The Palace&quot; (1979) and &quot;Ariosto&quot; (1980) were nominated for the World Fantasy Award, neither winning.

In 2016, she reported that on average, she wrote three to four books and one or two short stories and/or essays a year. She wrote six hours per day, six days per week except when traveling. Five days a week she spent three to four hours doing research.

Aside from writing, she has worked as a cartographer, has read tarot cards and palms, and has composed music, all of which she continues to do. Over the years she has studied seven instruments, voice, and musical theory: composition, voice, and piano have continued to be active interests for her. The newsletter, &quot;Yclept Yarbro&quot;, about her and her writings has been published since 1995 by Lindig Hall Harris. She played a major role in popularizing &quot;The Eye of Argon&quot;, a novella that became part of widespread science fiction convention reading game.

* Trystam Kith, for the two volume &quot;Trouble in the Forest&quot; historical fantasy series featuring vampire antagonists 
* Terry Nelson Bonner, for the fifth volume of &quot;The Making of Australia&quot; series
* T. C. F. Hopkins, for historical nonfiction
* Camille Gabor, for the high fantasy series, &quot;The Vildecaz Talents&quot;
* Vanessa Pryor, for the romance novel &quot;Taste of Wine&quot;

== The Michael teachings ==
&quot;Messages from Michael&quot; is the first in a series of four books recounting three-decade-long &quot;conversation&quot; between a group of friends centered around Sarah Chambers (1937≠1998) with a channeled entity and spiritual teacher that has come to be known as Michael. As of September 2013 this conversation continues, as the Michael group continues to conduct closed sessions in the San Francisco Bay Area. A core concept of the teachings is &quot;all choices made are equally valid.&quot;

Yarbro&#x27;s book presented a heavily fictionalized version of Sarah Chambers&#x27; group, which gave Chambers the alias of &quot;Jessica Lansing&quot;. The three subsequent books more contain edited channeling transcripts, along with background material.

<doc id="172045" wikidata="Q1579140" url="?curid=172045" title="The Letter (1929 film)">
<text>The Letter is an American pre-Code drama film directed by Jean de Limur and released by Paramount Pictures. It was the first full-sound feature shot at Astoria Studios in Queens, New York City. A silent version of the film was also released. The film stars stage actress Jeanne Eagels in her penultimate role and O.P. Heggie. The film was adapted by Garrett Fort from the 1927 play &quot;The Letter&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham. The film marks the acting debut of Reginald Owen, who played Robert Crosbie in the film.

The plot of the film follows Leslie Crosbie, a young woman living on a rubber plantation in the East Indies of Singapore, who falls in love with a man named Geoffrey Hammond, as she no longer finds any affection for her current husband, Robert Crosbie. However, Geoffrey falls in love with a Chinese woman named Li-Ti, and Leslie shoots him dead. Placed on trial for her life, Leslie perjures herself on the stand and claims that she killed Geoffrey in defense of her honor. However, a letter written by Leslie prior to the shooting that&#x27;s currently owned by Li-Ti has enough evidence for the court to find her guilty of murder, therefore Leslie must try to buy the letter off Li-Ti and get rid of it to avoid it being released to the jury.

&quot;The Letter&quot; was long out of circulation. In June 2011, a restored edition of the film was released on home video by Warner Bros. as part of its Warner Archive Collection as a made-on-demand DVD.

The film&#x27;s lobby cards and its other forms of advertising entered the public domain on January 1, 2025, as they were works published in 1929. However, the film itself was already in the public domain beforehand, since its copyright was never renewed. 

==Plot==

Bored and lonely living on her husband&#x27;s rubber plantation down in Singapore, Leslie Crosbie, takes a lover, Geoffrey Hammond, but he eventually tires of her and takes a Chinese mistress, Li-Ti. When Leslie learns of Geoffrey&#x27;s new mistress, she insists on seeing him while her husband is away and tries to rekindle his love. However, Geoffrey is not moved and informs Leslie that he prefers Li-Ti. Leslie becomes enraged and shoots Geoffrey repeatedly.

At the murder trial, Leslie perjures herself on the stand, claiming that she had little to do with Hammond and that she shot him when he tried to rape her. Meanwhile, Li-Ti&#x27;s emissary provides Joyce, Leslie&#x27;s attorney, with a copy of a letter in which Leslie begged Hammond to visit her. Li-Ti is ready to sell it for $10,000, provided Leslie makes the exchange. On Joyce&#x27;s advice, Leslie agrees. Li-Ti humiliates her but eventually accepts the money. Leslie is found not guilty.

Joyce presents his bill to Leslie&#x27;s husband Robert, who demands to know why the expenses total $10,000. Joyce relates the story of Li-Ti&#x27;s blackmail and gives Robert the damning letter. Robert confronts Leslie and forces her to admit everything. As punishment, Robert keeps her on the plantation even though he no longer has any money. Leslie proclaims that she still loves Geoffrey despite killing him.

==Cast==

* Jeanne Eagels as Leslie Crosbie
* Reginald Owen as Robert Crosbie
* Herbert Marshall as Geoffrey Hammond
* Irene Browne as Mrs. Joyce
* O.P. Heggie as Mr. Joyce
* Lady Tsen Mei as Li-Ti
* Tamaki Yoshiwara as Ong Chi Seng

==Production==
The story was inspired by a real-life scandal involving the Eurasian wife of the headmaster of a school in Kuala Lumpur who was convicted in a murder trial after shooting dead a male friend in April 1911. She was eventually pardoned by the local sultan after a public furor.

Very little is known about the film&#x27;s production. The film was shot at Astoria Studios in Queens, New York City. The film consisted of 5,778ft, with at least six reels. In 1931, Paramount Pictures released versions of the film dubbed in the Spanish, German, French and Italian languages.

==Reception==
The film was a hit upon release, earning $8,900,000 domestically. The New York Times praised the film and considered it &quot;an important piece of theater and film history.&quot; They also claimed Eagels was a &quot;brilliant, eccentric and spectacularly self-destructive actress.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
Jeanne Eagels, who died just months after the film was completed, was posthumously nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She was the first performer to be nominated by the Academy after her death, although all nominations at the 2nd Academy Awards were unofficial, and she was listed among several actresses &quot;under consideration&quot; by a board of judges.

&quot;The Letter&quot; was included in the Top Ten Films list of 1929 by the National Board of Review.

==Preservation==

Due to it being long out of circulation, the film was speculated by many to be lost. However on April 3rd 2011, a workprint of the film was found and given to the Library of Congress and The Film Foundation, who restored the film in June 2011. The film was then released on home video by Warner Bros. Pictures as part of its Warner Archive Collection as a made-on-demand DVD. It is one of two surviving sound films starring Jeanne Eagels.

The film&#x27;s lobby cards and its other forms of advertising entered the public domain on January 1, 2025, as they were works published in 1929. However, the film itself was already in the public domain beforehand, since its copyright was never renewed.

==Remake==
Herbert Marshall, who plays Leslie&#x27;s lover in the film, also appears as her husband in William Wyler&#x27;s 1940 Warner Bros. remake. Bette Davis received an Oscar nomination for the role of Leslie Crosbie in the 1940 version.

<text>Kimball Bent (24 August 1837 – 22 May 1916), also known as Kimble Bent, was a soldier and adventurer, who deserted from the British Army during the New Zealand Wars and lived for several years among the Māori people of New Zealand.

==Biography==
Bent was born in Eastport, Maine USA. He ran away to sea at 17 and spent three years travelling the Atlantic seaboard as a sailor/ gunner in the US Navy. He returned to Eastport but was restless and sailed to Liverpool, England. Penniless and seeking adventure on 18 October 1859 he enlisted in the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot in the British Army. He served in India and his unit was posted to New Zealand in 1861. His record was dubious, and he was repeatedly disciplined for various military infractions including disobedience and drunkenness. This discipline included a prison sentence in Wellington, and receiving lashes in front of his company. Bent accordingly decided to desert in June 1865 while serving in Taranaki.

Bent was found by a local Māori chief of the Ngāti Ruanui iwi in South Taranaki and eventually became accepted as a part of the local tribe. He fell in with Tītokowaru&#x27;s followers in 1867 and fought with them against the colonists in what has become known as Tītokowaru&#x27;s War until their eventual defeat in 1869.

Bent then went into hiding first in the backblocks of Taranaki and later in Wairau, Blenheim. He spent his remaining years working in several trades including as a builder, fisherman, horticulturist, tattooist, traditional healer using Māori medicine and even a confectioner. He remained a wanted deserter with a reward on his head for many years, but eventually the authorities stopped looking for him. In 1903 he was rediscovered, and a book was written about his life by James Cowan. Entitled &quot;The adventures of Kimble Bent: a story of wild life in the New Zealand bush&quot;, it was something of sensation at the time.

He died in Wairau Hospital on 22 May 1916. and was buried in an unmarked grave in the Omaka Cemetery. The location of his grave in this cemetery is only known to descendants of the family whom he lived with in his final years.

More recently, his tale has been fictionalised by New Zealand author Maurice Shadbolt in his 1990 historical novel &quot;Monday&#x27;s Warriors&quot; and in the 2011 graphic novel, &quot;Kimble Bent Malcontent: The Wild Adventures of a Runaway Soldier in Old-Time New Zealand&quot; by Chris Grosz.

<doc id="172047" wikidata="Q1338897" url="?curid=172047" title="Classful network">
<text>A classful network is an obsolete network addressing architecture used in the Internet from 1981 until the introduction of Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) in 1993. The method divides the IP address space for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) into five address classes based on the leading four address bits. Classes A, B, and C provide unicast addresses for networks of three different network sizes. Class D is for multicast networking and the class E address range is reserved for future or experimental purposes.

Since its discontinuation, remnants of classful network concepts have remained in practice only in limited scope in the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components, most notably in the default configuration of subnet masks.

==Background==
In the original address definition, the most significant eight bits of the 32-bit IPv4 address was the &quot;network number&quot; field which specified the particular network a host was attached to. The remaining 24 bits specified the local address, also called &quot;rest field&quot; (the rest of the address), which uniquely identified a host connected to that network. This format was sufficient at a time when only a few large networks existed, such as the ARPANET (network number 10), and before the wide proliferation of local area networks (LANs). As a consequence of this architecture, the address space supported only a low number (254) of independent networks.

Before the introduction of address classes, the only address blocks available were these large blocks which later became known as Class A networks. As a result, some organizations involved in the early development of the Internet received very large address space allocations (16,777,216 IP addresses each).

==Introduction of address classes==
Expansion of the network had to ensure compatibility with the existing address space and the IPv4 packet structure, and avoid the renumbering of the existing networks. The solution was to expand the definition of the network number field to include more bits, allowing more networks to be designated, each potentially having fewer hosts. Since all existing network numbers at the time were smaller than 64, they had only used the 6 least-significant bits of the network number field. Thus it was possible to use the most-significant bits of an address to introduce a set of address classes while preserving the existing network numbers in the first of these classes.

The new addressing architecture was introduced by in 1981 as a part of the specification of the Internet Protocol. It divided the address space into primarily three address formats, henceforth called address &quot;classes&quot;, and left a fourth range reserved to be defined later.

The first class, designated as &quot;Class A&quot;, contained all addresses in which the most significant bit is zero. The network number for this class is given by the next 7 bits, therefore accommodating 128 networks in total, including the zero network, and including the IP networks already allocated. A &quot;Class B&quot; network was a network in which all addresses had the two most-significant bits set to 1 and 0 respectively. For these networks, the network address was given by the next 14 bits of the address, thus leaving 16 bits for numbering host on the network for a total of addresses per network. &quot;Class C&quot; was defined with the 3 high-order bits set to 1, 1, and 0, and designating the next 21 bits to number the networks, leaving each network with 256 local addresses.

The leading bit sequence &quot;111&quot; designated an at-the-time unspecified addressing mode (&quot;escape to extended addressing mode&quot;), which was later subdivided as Class D (&quot;1110&quot;) for multicast addressing, while leaving as reserved for future use the &quot;1111&quot; block designated as Class E.

This architecture change extended the addressing capacity of the Internet but did not prevent IP address exhaustion. The problem was that many sites needed larger address blocks than a Class C network provided, and therefore they received a Class B block, which was in most cases much larger than required. Due to the rapid growth of the Internet, the pool of unassigned Class B addresses (214, or about 16,000) was rapidly being depleted. Starting in 1993, classful networking was replaced by Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), in an attempt to solve this problem.

==Classful addressing definition==
Under classful network addressing, the 32-bit IPv4 address space was partitioned into five classes (A-E) as shown in the following tables.
;Classes
;Bit-wise representation
In the following bit-wise representation,
* &quot;n&quot; indicates a bit used for the network ID.
* &quot;H&quot; indicates a bit used for the host ID.
* &quot;X&quot; indicates a bit without a specified purpose.

The number of addresses usable for addressing specific hosts in each network is always , where N is the number of rest field bits, and the subtraction of 2 adjusts for the use of the all-bits-zero host value to represent the network address and the all-bits-one host value for use as a broadcast address. Thus, for a Class C address with 8 bits available in the host field, the maximum number of hosts is 254.

Today, IP addresses are associated with a subnet mask. This was not required in a classful network because the mask was implied by the address itself; any network device would inspect the first few bits of the IP address to determine the class of the address and thus its netmask.

The blocks numerically at the start and end of classes A, B and C were originally reserved for special addressing or future features, i.e., and are reserved in former class A; and were reserved in former class B but are now available for assignment; and are reserved in former class C. While the network is a Class A network, it is designated for loopback and cannot be assigned to a network.

Class D is reserved for multicast and cannot be used for regular unicast traffic. Class E is reserved and cannot be used on the public Internet. Many older routers will not accept using it in any context.

<text>In abstract algebra, a partially ordered group is a group (&quot;G&quot;, +) equipped with a partial order &quot;≤&quot; that is &quot;translation-invariant&quot;; in other words, &quot;≤&quot; has the property that, for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; then &quot;a&quot; + &quot;g&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; + &quot;g&quot; and &quot;g&quot; +&quot; a&quot; ≤ &quot;g&quot; +&quot; b&quot;.

An element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;G&quot; is called positive if 0 ≤ &quot;x&quot;. The set of elements 0 ≤ &quot;x&quot; is often denoted with &quot;G&quot;+, and is called the positive cone of &quot;G&quot;.

By translation invariance, we have &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; if and only if 0 ≤ -&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;.
So we can reduce the partial order to a monadic property: if and only if 

For the general group &quot;G&quot;, the existence of a positive cone specifies an order on &quot;G&quot;. A group &quot;G&quot; is a partially orderable group if and only if there exists a subset &quot;H&quot; (which is &quot;G&quot;+) of &quot;G&quot; such that:
* 0 ∈ &quot;H&quot;
* if &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot; then &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot;
* if &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot; then -&quot;x&quot; + &quot;a&quot; + &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot; for each &quot;x&quot; of &quot;G&quot;
* if &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot; and -&quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot; then &quot;a&quot; = 0

A partially ordered group &quot;G&quot; with positive cone &quot;G&quot;+ is said to be unperforated if &quot;n&quot; · &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;+ for some positive integer &quot;n&quot; implies &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;+. Being unperforated means there is no &quot;gap&quot; in the positive cone &quot;G&quot;+.

If the order on the group is a linear order, then it is said to be a linearly ordered group.
If the order on the group is a lattice order, i.e. any two elements have a least upper bound, then it is a lattice-ordered group (shortly l-group, though usually typeset with a script l: ℓ-group).

A [[Frigyes Riesz|Riesz]] group is an unperforated partially ordered group with a property slightly weaker than being a lattice-ordered group. Namely, a Riesz group satisfies the Riesz interpolation property: if &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;y&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;2 are elements of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;xi&quot; ≤ &quot;yj&quot;, then there exists &quot;z&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot; such that &quot;xi&quot; ≤ &quot;z&quot; ≤ &quot;yj&quot;.

If &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are two partially ordered groups, a map from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;H&quot; is a &quot;morphism of partially ordered groups&quot; if it is both a group homomorphism and a monotonic function. The partially ordered groups, together with this notion of morphism, form a category.

Partially ordered groups are used in the definition of valuations of fields.

== Examples ==

* The integers with their usual order
* An ordered vector space is a partially ordered group
* A Riesz space is a lattice-ordered group
* A typical example of a partially ordered group is Z&quot;n&quot;, where the group operation is componentwise addition, and we write (&quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;) ≤ (&quot;b&quot;1...,&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;) if and only if &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot; (in the usual order of integers) for all &quot;i&quot; = 1..., &quot;n&quot;.
* More generally, if &quot;G&quot; is a partially ordered group and &quot;X&quot; is some set, then the set of all functions from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;G&quot; is again a partially ordered group: all operations are performed componentwise. Furthermore, every subgroup of &quot;G&quot; is a partially ordered group: it inherits the order from &quot;G&quot;.
* If &quot;A&quot; is an approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebra, or more generally, if &quot;A&quot; is a stably finite unital C*-algebra, then K0(&quot;A&quot;) is a partially ordered abelian group. (Elliott, 1976)

==Properties==

=== Archimedean ===
The Archimedean property of the real numbers can be generalized to partially ordered groups.

:Property: A partially ordered group formula_1 is called Archimedean when for any formula_2, if formula_3 and formula_4 for all formula_5 then formula_6. Equivalently, when formula_7, then for any formula_8, there is some formula_9 such that formula_10.

=== Integrally closed ===
A partially ordered group &quot;G&quot; is called integrally closed if for all elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, if &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; for all natural &quot;n&quot; then &quot;a&quot; ≤ 1.

This property is somewhat stronger than the fact that a partially ordered group is Archimedean, though for a lattice-ordered group to be integrally closed and to be Archimedean is equivalent.
There is a theorem that every integrally closed directed group is already abelian. This has to do with the fact that a directed group is embeddable into a complete lattice-ordered group if and only if it is integrally closed.

<text>Adrian Malcolm Conan Doyle (19 November 19103 June 1970) was the youngest son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his second wife Jean, Lady Doyle or Lady Conan Doyle. He had two siblings, sister Jean Conan Doyle and brother Denis, as well as two half-siblings, sister Mary and brother Kingsley.
Adrian has been depicted as a racing car driver, big-game hunter, explorer, and writer. Biographer Andrew Lycett calls him a &quot;spendthrift playboy&quot; who (with his brother Denis) &quot;used the Conan Doyle estate as a milch-cow&quot;.

He married Danish-born Anna Andersen, and was his father&#x27;s literary executor after his mother died in 1940. He founded the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Foundation in Switzerland in 1965. On his death, his sister Jean took over as their father&#x27;s literary executor.

==Additional Sherlock Holmes stories==
Adrian Conan Doyle produced additional Sherlock Holmes stories, some with the assistance of John Dickson Carr. The basis of his production was to complete those tales referenced in his father&#x27;s stories, which his father had never written. (Carr had published an &quot;authorized&quot; biography of Sir Arthur in 1949.) These additional Sherlock Holmes tales were written in 1952 and 1953, and a hardcover collection of the stories was published as &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in 1954. They have been reissued subsequently, while other authors have also written Sherlock Holmes stories based on the same references within the original tales.

==Discovery of unpublished Holmes story==
On 12 September 1942, the Associated Press announced that an authentic, unpublished Sherlock Holmes story had been found by Adrian Conan Doyle. Supposedly written in his father&#x27;s distinctive neat handwriting, the story was buried in a chest that contained family documents. (Actually, Jon Lellenberg reported in 1990, the manuscript was not in Sir Arthur&#x27;s handwriting but typewritten.) Sir Arthur&#x27;s daughter Jean said she knew the manuscript was not written by her father. Adrian Conan Doyle refused to publish it. A month later, the Baker Street Irregulars wrote a letter to the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot;, insisting that the story be published.

In the United States, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine obtained it and published it in their August 1948 issue under the uncharacteristic title &quot;The Case of the Man who was Wanted&quot;. It was also published in London&#x27;s
&quot;Sunday Dispatch&quot; magazine the following January. Sherlock Holmes expert Vincent Starrett doubted that the story was written by the elder Doyle and suggested that Adrian was the author.

In September 1945, a letter was sent to Hesketh Pearson, one of Sir Arthur&#x27;s biographers. It stated, &quot;My pride is not unduly hurt by your remark that &#x27;The Man who was Wanted&#x27; is certainly not up to scratch for the sting is much mitigated by your going on to remark that it carries the authentic trade-mark! This, I feel, is a great compliment to my one and only effort at plagiarism.&quot; The letter was written by an architect named Arthur Whitaker who had sent the story to Arthur Conan Doyle in 1911, suggesting that they publish it as a joint collaboration. Doyle refused, but sent Whitaker a &quot;cheque for ten guineas&quot; in payment for the story. 

After seeing it attributed to Sir Arthur in the &quot;Sunday Dispatch&quot;, Whitaker wrote a letter to Denis Conan Doyle stating that he was the true author. Denis forwarded the letter to his brother Adrian, who became angry, demanded proof, and threatened legal action. Whitaker had retained a carbon copy, and, after seeing this and listening to people who had read it in 1911, the Doyles admitted in 1949, that Whitaker was the author. The story that many people had accepted as the work of Sir Arthur has since been published as &quot;The Adventure of the Sheffield Banker&quot; in the collection &quot;The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

==Works about his father==
Sir Arthur&#x27;s widow, Jean, chose a spiritualist, the Rev. John Lamond, to write an authorised biography, &quot;Arthur Conan Doyle: A Memoir&quot; (John Murray, 1931). The memoir, which emphasised his paranormal interests, was not what readers wanted, so after their mother&#x27;s death, Adrian and Denis grudgingly allowed Hesketh Pearson to write &quot;Conan Doyle: His Life and Art&quot; (Methuen, 1943). However, Pearson&#x27;s book offended Adrian and Denis by saying that the secret of their father&#x27;s success was that he was the &quot;common man&quot;. Adrian threatened criminal proceedings against Pearson&#x27;s &quot;fakeography&quot;, wrote an article in protest, and later, a book: &quot;The True Conan Doyle&quot; (John Murray, 1945). 

According to Lycett, &quot;When the BBC commissioned an anniversary talk from Hesketh Pearson, Adrian announced that if it went ahead it would never broadcast another Sherlock Holmes story. The Corporation caved in.&quot;

<text>Hasselt (, , ) is the capital and largest city of the province of Limburg in the Flemish Region of Belgium.

As of 1 August 2023, Hasselt had a total population of 80,846. The old town of Hasselt is surrounded by a number of satellite hamlets including Kiewit, Runkst, Banneuxwijk, Godsheide and Rapertingen. Further away are several sub-municipalities which were once within independent municipalities, including Kermt, Kuringen, Sint-Lambrechts-Herk, Spalbeek, Stevoort, Stokrooie, and Wimmertingen.

Geographically, Hasselt is located between the Campine region, north of the Demer river, and the Hesbaye region, to the south. Both the Demer river and the Albert Canal run through the municipality.

In terms of economic regions, Hasselt is within the transnational Meuse-Rhine Euroregion, connecting neighbouring regions in Wallonia, the Netherlands and Germany.

==History==

Hasselt was founded in approximately the 7th century on the Helbeek, a tributary of the Demer river. During the Middle Ages it became one of the free cities of the county of Loon (which had borders approximately the same as the current province of Limburg). It was first named in a document in 1165. In 1232 Arnold IV, Count of Loon gave the city the same freedoms as those enjoyed in Liège. Hasselt became the biggest city in present-day Limburg thanks to its favourable setting, and the proximity of the count&#x27;s castle at Herkenrode in Kuringen. In 1366 the county of Loon came under the direct rule of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège and remained so until the annexation by France in 1794.

During the First French Empire, the city of Maastricht became the capital of the French Department of the Lower Meuse. This comprised not only the area of the modern province of Limburg in Belgium, but also what is now the province of Limburg in the Netherlands. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, all of what is now Belgium became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. During this time, it was King William I who re-named the Lower Meuse department after the medieval Duchy of Limburg. This Duchy was in fact named after Limbourg on the Vesdre river, now in the Liège province of Belgium, which had never encompassed Hasselt or Maastricht. Belgium split from the Netherlands in 1830, but the status of Limburg was only resolved nine years later in 1839, with the division of Limburg into Belgian and Dutch parts. Hasselt became the provisional capital of the Belgian province of Limburg. In ecclesiastical terms, Belgian Limburg became an independent entity from the Diocese of Liège only in 1967, and Hasselt became the seat of the new Diocese of Hasselt.

In 1977, Hasselt merged with several surrounding municipalities attaching the current sub-municipalities of Kermt, Kuringen, Sint-Lambrechts-Herk, Stevoort and Wimmertingen.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, many urban renewal projects have taken place in the city, including the construction of the Two Towers (TT) neighborhood. From 1 January 2025, the neighboring village of Kortessem will merge into Hasselt, becoming a new sub-municipality.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Hasselt&quot; is derived from the Germanic word &quot;Hasaluth&quot; which refers to the common hazel.

==Town centre==
The centre is mostly car-free and contains a number of historical buildings. Among the oldest buildings in the town centre are the St. Quentin&#x27;s Cathedral (11th to 18th centuries) and the Refuge of Herkenrode Abbey, the city&#x27;s oldest civic building (1542). The &quot;Grote Markt&quot; (Grand Market) and the nearby streets are lined with restaurants brasseries, cafes and taverns.

The Demerstraat and the Koning Albertstraat are the most important shopping streets, while the Kapelstraat and Hoogstraat house upscale shops and brands. Another major religious building besides the cathedral is the Virga Jesse Basilica. The churches must cede domination of the skyline of the city to the modern twin towers of the &quot;TT-wijk&quot; (TT Quarter), however. In 2003, the renovation of this complex, now including a shopping mall and a hotel, gave the centre a new boost. In 2004, Hasselt was the first city to receive the title &quot;most sociable city in Flanders&quot;.

==Demographics==
In 1977, the merger of Hasselt with several surrounding municipalities added 22.309 inhabitants at the time to its own population of 40.446 inhabitants. As of 1 October 2024, Hasselt had a total population of 81.708 (40.070 men and 41.638 women).

===Languages===
* Dutch in Hasselt is often spoken with a distinctive Limburgish accent and vocabulary, which should not be confused with the Limburgish language.
* Limburgish (or &quot;Limburgian&quot;) is the overlapping term for the tonal dialects spoken in the Belgian and Dutch provinces of Limburg. The Hasselt dialect is only one of many variants of Limburgish. Limburgish is a language, and not the same as the regional variation of Dutch spoken in Dutch Limburg and Belgian Limburg. Since Limburgish is still the mother tongue of many inhabitants, Limburgish grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation can however have a significant impact on the way locals speak Dutch in public life.
*French was historically spoken by some of the city population within living memory.

=== Religion ===
Hasselt is the main seat of the Catholic diocese of Hasselt, which covers the entire Belgian province of Limburg. The main church is St. Quentin&#x27;s Cathedral. Hasselt also consists of about 30 parishes. Next to the Catholic Church, Hasselt houses both a Moroccan and Turkish mosque as both communities are well-established in the city and the surrounding municipalities.

== Gastronomy ==
Hasselt brands itself as the &quot;Capital of Taste&quot;, owing to its local distilleries of Jenever, the Hasselt Jenever Festival, Hasselt speculaas, and chocolate production.

=== Hasseltse Jenever (Hasselt gin) ===

Hasselt is famous for its gin, locally known as Jenever. Even though the spirit is produced across the entire country of Belgium, Hasselt Jenever became famous when the city escaped the 1601 ban on the sale and production of the beverage imposed by Albert VII, Archduke of Austria and Isabella Clara Eugenia, both Archduke and Archduchess of the Habsburg Netherlands, because it belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. Dutch troops stationed in the city from 1675 to 1681 ensured that Hasselt Jenever, more than any other Belgian jenever, carried aromas of herbs and berries.

At the end of the 19th century, dire living conditions among the working population and cheap Jenever prepared from sugar beet molasses led to the annual consumption of 9.5 litres of Jenever (50% vol) per inhabitant of Belgium. Jenever production was the most important industry in Limburg in the 19th century with most distilleries being located in Hasselt. However, increase in excise duty, competition from cheap industrial alcohol, the confiscation of copper stills by the Germans during World War I, and the Vandervelde law against alcohol abuse caused most distilleries in Hasselt to disappear or to be taken over by larger competitors.

By the early 21st century, Hasselt only housed two distilleries (known as &#x27;stokerij&#x27; in Dutch): the National Jenever Museum and Stokerij Wissels, which was later bought by the larger Stokerij Fryns, based in Ghent, which resumed Jenever production on the former Wissels grounds under the Fryns name. Today, three Jenever distilleries operate in Hasselt: the National Jenever Museum, Stokerij Fryns, and Stokerij Vanderlinden, founded in 2017. 
==== Hasselt Jenever Festival====
Every year during the third weekend of October, the two-day Hasselt Jenever Festival takes place. It includes, among other elements, musical, dance, and street theatre performances, the &quot;Borrelmanneke&quot; fountain on Maastricherstraat being transformed from a water fountain into a Jenever fountain for the day and a Waiters&#x27; Race through the city center.

=== Hasselt speculaas ===

Hasselt speculaas is a type of speculaas originating from and only produced in Hasselt. It differs from the type of speculaas eaten in the rest of Belgium in its greater thickness, its smaller reliance on spices - which gives it a milder taste -, and in its structure, with a crispy crust and soft, doughy insides.

Speculaas was baked in Hasselt as early as the 14th century. According to tradition, Hasselt speculaas was eaten with chilled Jenever. The early 19th century saw the introduction of the &quot;Spéculation de Hasselt&quot; - the Hasselt speculaas -, which was soon exported to Brussels and to Liège, among others. Until the Second World War, Hasselt speculaas was only baked around Saint Nicholas Day, since then it has been sold throughout the entire year.

== Branding ==
Since the early 2000s, Hasselt has been known within Flanders for its distinctive and sometimes outspoken branding as a city. In 2002, former mayor, Steve Stevaert, introduced the catchphrase &quot;Hasselt Capital of Taste&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Hasselt Hoofdstad van de Smaak&quot;), creating a well-known brand image across the Flemish region to promote its touristic attractions, stores and local industries.

After 15 years the city decided to rebrand to &quot;Hasselt has it&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Hasselt heeft het&quot;). However, the city&#x27;s old branding remained in use by its citizens and beyond. Five years later, due to this brand recognition, the city decided to reverse to the original catchphrase in spoken communication, and use &quot;Hasselt Smaakmaker Spraakmaker&quot; in written communication and visuals.

In 2023, a dating platform had selected Hasselt as the Belgian city with the most eligible singles. The city developed a tourism campaign based on this claim, showing diverse couples throughout the city within promotional videos and posters, while also strategically highlighting the claims of the dating platform. The campaign saw the use of a new catchphrase &quot;Hasselt tastes like more&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Hasselt smaakt naar meer&quot;), building further on their earlier catchphrase &quot;Hasselt Capital of Taste&quot;.

== Economy ==

With 3,000 employees, the Jessa Hospital in Hasselt is the city&#x27;s biggest employer with two health care campuses and one logistical campus. Cegeka Group, a European provider of IT solutions, services, and consultancy is also one of the city&#x27;s largest employers, generating a turnover of €744 million. The city also provides an ecosystem for start-ups, scale-ups, and major companies through its Corda Campus, surrounded by government organizations and research institutions. Currently, 5,000 people work in 250 companies over a land area of 9 acres, formerly being occupied by Philips. By 2030, an investment of €150 million at the site is planned to generate employment for 7,500 people in 350 companies on an area of 14 acres.

=== Inventions ===
The Compact Cassette and Cassette Recorder were invented by a team of Belgian and Dutch engineers, led by the Lou Ottens, at Philips&#x27; Hasselt site in 1963. In 1983, a team of engineers developed one of the first compact disc (CD) devices at Philips Hasselt.

==Transport==
===Road===

Hasselt lies at the junction of important traffic arteries from several directions. The most important motorways are the European route E313 (Antwerp-Liège) and the European route E314 (Brussels-Aachen). The old town of Hasselt is enclosed by 2 ring roads. The outer ring road serves to keep traffic out of the city center and main residential areas. The inner ring road, the &quot;Green Boulevard&quot;, serves to keep traffic out of the commercial center, which is almost entirely a pedestrian area. There are also important traffic arteries to Tongeren, Sint-Truiden, Genk, and Diest.

=== Nearby airports ===
The city lies within approximately an hour&#x27;s drive from the airports of Brussels, Liège, Antwerp, Charleroi, Eindhoven, Maastricht, Cologne/Bonn, and Düsseldorf. Within a three-hour radius, the major hubs of Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt can be reached. Small private aircraft can land in Hasselt itself, on the airfield of Kiewit. Some of these airports have direct public transport links via either train or intercity bus lines, like Flixbus.

===Bus===

Hasselt introduced a zero-fare policy for all public buses in 1997. By 2006, the usage of public transport had increased by 800–900% compared to pre-zero-fare numbers. In 2013, bus subsidies were reduced, resulting in the reintroduction of fares (60 cents per ride).

 The city&#x27;s official website records passenger growth as follows:
A Belgian website describes Hasselt identity cards as becoming &quot;like gold in value&quot;, because of free bus travel.

In 2013, Hasselt cancelled free public transportation due to financial reasons. The operator increased its claim towards the city, which the city could not pay. Now persons up to the age of 19 travel for free.

===Rail===
Hasselt railway station, run by NMBS, is located near the city centre, outside the innermost ring road. InterCity trains link the city to major Belgian centres such as Brussels, Antwerp, Liège, and Leuven, as well as to Brussels Airport.

==== Reopening of rail line 20 Hasselt - Maastricht ====
In February 2007, a plan was launched for the construction of an international light rail connection between Hasselt and Maastricht (Hasselt – Maastricht tramway). Agreements between the relevant governments were reached in June 2008 and December 2011. The line was planned to reduce the current travel time of 61 minutes by bus to only 36 minutes. Construction should have started in 2014, with the line expected to go into service in 2017. The construction eventually was delayed several times due to problems with the Wilhelminabrug in Maastricht, concerns about the profitability and the numbers of passengers making use of the planned line as well as opposition from the Hasselt city council regarding the planned route through the city. The Flemish government eventually stopped the project, with various Dutch governments reporting to have spent more than €20 million without any major construction happening. The line has now been proposed to be replaced by a so-called electric &quot;trambus&quot; system. However, concerns were raised too as the new alternative might not fulfill the cross-border high-quality public transport needs of the Dutch and Belgian provinces of Limburg. 

Since end 2024, the reopening of rail line 20 between Hasselt and Maastricht is being reconsidered within Flanders, after the Dutch Government unveiled plans to demolish a vital railway bridge over the Meuse river in Maastricht.

== Climate ==
== Education ==

Hasselt has two university colleges: University College PXL and University Colleges Leuven-Limburg (UCLL). These offer courses in healthcare, social work, art, commercial sciences, and teacher training, among others.

Hasselt University, established in 1971, operates campuses in the city and in the neighbouring town of Diepenbeek and, as of 2023, has more than 7,000 students and 1,700 academic, administrative, and technical staff. The university houses 7 faculties, 4 research institutes, 3 research centres, and 3 doctoral schools. In the Times Higher Education ranking of the world&#x27;s best universities under 50, Hasselt University is ranked 35th out of 605.
==Sports==
Hasselt is home to Limburg United, one of the Belgium&#x27;s top professional basketball teams. The team plays its home games at &quot;Sporthal Alverberg&quot;. The city&#x27;s largest football club is Sporting Hasselt, which plays its home games at &quot;Stedelijk Sportstadion Hasselt&quot;. The city&#x27;s rugby club is RC Hasselt.

<doc id="172051" wikidata="Q979131" url="?curid=172051" title="Louis Theroux">
<text>Louis Sebastian Theroux (; born 20 May 1970) is a British-American documentarian, journalist, broadcaster, and author. He has received three British Academy Television Awards and a Royal Television Society Television Award.

After graduating from Magdalen College, Oxford, Theroux moved to the United States and worked as a journalist for &quot;Metro Silicon Valley&quot; and &quot;Spy&quot;. He moved into television as the presenter of offbeat segments on Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;TV Nation&quot; series.

Theroux is known for his numerous documentaries with the BBC, beginning with &quot;Louis Theroux&#x27;s Weird Weekends&quot; (1998–2000), followed by &quot;When Louis Met...&quot; (2000–2002) and 50 BBC Two specials (2003–present). His work includes studies of unusual and taboo subcultures, crime and the justice system, and celebrities. The majority of his documentaries are set in the United States, but he has also studied cultures in South Africa, Israel, Nigeria, and the UK. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described Theroux&#x27;s work as &quot;a piercingly humane, slyly funny guide through the funkier passages of American culture&quot;.

==Early life==
Louis Sebastian Theroux was born in Singapore on 20 May 1970, the son of English mother Anne (née Castle) and American father Paul Theroux, a noted travel writer and novelist. His paternal grandmother, Anne Dittami, was an Italian-American grammar school teacher, while his paternal grandfather, Albert Eugène Theroux, was a French-Canadian salesman for the American Leather Oak company. Theroux holds dual British and American citizenship. He is the nephew of novelist Alexander Theroux and writer Peter Theroux. His older brother, Marcel, is a writer and television presenter. His cousin, Justin, is an actor and screenwriter.

Theroux moved with his family to England when he was one year old, and was raised in the Catford area of south London. He went from primary school to Tower House School in East Sheen in 1979 or 1980 and then to Westminster School, a public school within the precincts of Westminster Abbey. There, he befriended comedians Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish, and future Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he travelled to America. He also performed in a number of school theatre productions including &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; as Looney Bergonzi, &quot;Ritual for Dolls&quot; as the Army Officer, and &quot;The Splendour Falls&quot; as the Minstrel. He read Modern History at Magdalen College, Oxford (1988–1991), graduating with first-class honours.

==Career==
===Early career===
Theroux&#x27;s first employment as a journalist was in the United States with &quot;Metro Silicon Valley&quot;, an alternative free weekly newspaper in San Jose, California. In 1992, he was hired as a writer for &quot;Spy.&quot; He also worked as a correspondent on Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;TV Nation&quot; series, for which he provided segments on offbeat cultural subjects, including selling Avon to women in the Amazon Rainforest, the Jerusalem syndrome, and attempts by the Ku Klux Klan to rebrand itself as a civil rights group for white people.

When &quot;TV Nation&quot; ended, Theroux signed a development deal with the BBC, where he developed &quot;Louis Theroux&#x27;s Weird Weekends&quot;. He has written for a number of publications, including &quot;Hip Hop Connection&quot; and &quot;The Idler&quot;.

===Documentaries===
====&quot;Louis Theroux&#x27;s Weird Weekends&quot;====
In &quot;Weird Weekends&quot; (1998–2000), Theroux followed marginal (mostly American) subcultures such as survivalists, black nationalists, white supremacists, and porn stars, often by living among or close to the people who were involved in them. His documentary method subtly exposes the contradictions or farcical elements of his subjects&#x27; seriously held beliefs. He described the aim of Weird Weekends as:

====&quot;When Louis Met...&quot;====
In the series &quot;When Louis Met...&quot; (2000–02), Theroux accompanied a different British celebrity in each programme in their daily lives, interviewing them as they go. His episode about British entertainer Jimmy Savile, entitled &quot;When Louis Met Jimmy&quot;, was voted one of the top documentaries of all time in a 2005 survey by Britain&#x27;s Channel 4. Some years after the episode was filmed, the NSPCC described Savile as one of the most prolific sex offenders in Great Britain.

In an interview in 2015, Theroux expressed his intention to produce a follow-up documentary about Savile for the BBC to explore how the late entertainer had continued his abuse for so long, to meet people he knew closely, and examine his own reflections on his inability to dig more deeply into the first case. This follow-up documentary, with the title &quot;Savile&quot;, aired on BBC Two on Sunday, 2 October 2016, and lasted 1 hour, 15 minutes.

In &quot;When Louis Met the Hamiltons&quot;, the former Conservative MP Neil Hamilton and his wife Christine were arrested during the course of filming, due to false allegations of indecent assault.

In &quot;When Louis Met Max Clifford&quot;, Max Clifford tried to set up Theroux, but he was caught lying as the crew recorded his live microphone during the conversations.

After this series concluded, a retrospective called &quot;Life with Louis&quot; was released. Theroux made a documentary called &quot;Louis, Martin &amp; Michael&quot; about his quest to get an interview with Michael Jackson to which he lost out to Martin Bashir who went on to make the documentary Living With Michael Jackson. Selected episodes of &quot;When Louis Met...&quot; were included as bonus content on a Best-Of collection of &quot;Weird Weekends&quot;.

====BBC Two specials====
In these special programmes, beginning in 2003, Theroux returned to American themes, working at feature-length and in a more natural way. In March 2006, he signed a new deal with the BBC to make 10 films over the course of three years. Subjects for the specials include criminal gangs in Lagos, Neo-Nazis in America, ultra-Zionists in Israel. He also explores child psychiatry, and the prison systems in California and Florida. A 2007 special, &quot;The Most Hated Family in America&quot;, received strong critical praise from the international media.

====&quot;My Scientology Movie&quot;====

In October 2016, Theroux premiered a feature-length documentary, &quot;My Scientology Movie&quot;. Produced by Simon Chinn—a school friend of Theroux&#x27;s—and directed by John Dower, the film covers Theroux attempting to gain access to the secretive Church of Scientology. It premiered at the London Film Festival in 2015 and was released in cinemas in the UK on 7 October 2016.

====&quot;Forbidden America&quot;====
&quot;Forbidden America&quot; is a three-part series focusing on social media use in the United States among several groups, including the alt-right, rappers and pornographic film actors. On the &quot;Extreme and Online&quot; Louis meets the latest incarnation of the American far right: a political movement born out of the internet and increasingly making its presence felt on the political stage. Theroux interviews Nick Fuentes and Baked Alaska.

====Interviews====
In 2022, the BBC announced a series of interviews conducted by Theroux under the title &quot;Louis Theroux Interviews&quot;, in which he meets and talks to celebrities from stage, screen and music about their successful careers and their personal lives. The first series started airing weekly on BBC Two on 25 October 2022 and features interviews from rapper Stormzy, actress Dame Judi Dench, musician YUNGBLUD, adventurer Bear Grylls, comedian Katherine Ryan and singer Rita Ora. The second series of &quot;Louis Theroux Interviews&quot; started airing on 7 November 2023 and includes interviews from boxer Anthony Joshua, musician Pete Doherty, actress Joan Collins, singer Raye, activist Chelsea Manning and actor Ashley Walters.

===Books===
Theroux published his first book, &quot;The Call of the Weird: Travels in American Subcultures&quot;, in Britain in 2005. In it, he recounts his return to the United States to learn about the lives of some of the people he had featured in his television programmes.

Theroux released a memoir, &quot;Gotta Get Theroux This&quot;, in September 2019. He released his third book, &quot;Theroux the Keyhole&quot;, a diary recorded during the UK COVID-19 lockdowns, in November 2021.

=== Podcasts ===
In April 2020, during a COVID-19 lockdown, Theroux started the BBC Radio 4 podcast &quot;Grounded with Louis Theroux&quot; from his home, in which he interviews well-known people he finds particularly fascinating and to whom he would not necessarily have had a chance to speak before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Beginning on 6 June 2023, he started hosting &quot;The Louis Theroux Podcast&quot; as part of an exclusive deal with Spotify.

===Other appearances===
Theroux makes a few appearances on &quot;The Adam and Joe Show&quot; DVD and has been a guest many times on Adam &amp; Joe&#x27;s radio shows, as well as on &quot;The Adam Buxton Podcast&quot;.

As part of the &quot;Weird Weekends&quot; episode &quot;Porn&quot;, Theroux agreed to film a cameo in the 1997 gay pornography film &quot;Take a Peak&quot;. He did not perform sexual acts in the film, but made a brief appearance as a park ranger in search of a criminal. In the &quot;Weird Weekends&quot; episode &quot;Infomercials&quot;, he featured as a live salesman for an at-home paper shredder for the Home Shopping Network.

In December 2015, Theroux captained the team representing Magdalen College, Oxford on BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;Christmas University Challenge&quot;. In their first-round match, the team beat the University of Exeter&#x27;s team by 220 to 130 and went on to win the tournament.

In April 2022, Theroux went viral after a clip of him on the YouTube show &quot;Chicken Shop Date&quot;in which he performed a short rap he had originally written and performed in the &quot;Weird Weekends&quot; episode &quot;Gangsta Rap&quot; 22 years earlierwas autotuned by a TikTok user and turned into a reusable audio track with backing music. The trend saw users lip-syncing to the sound and performing an accompanying dance. It has led to more footage of Theroux&#x27;s rapping ability being unearthed, leading the BBC to publish an article listing seven times he &quot;proved he was a massive hip hop head&quot;. In May, Theroux released &quot;Jiggle Jiggle&quot;, a full version of the rap which he created alongside Manchester DJ duo Duke &amp; Jones.

==Personal life==
Theroux&#x27;s first marriage was to Susanna Kleeman until they divorced in 2002; he later told Sathnam Sanghera of the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;What happened was that my girlfriend was living with me in New York. She was having trouble finding work ... legally. So we got married, to make it easier for her. We never really considered ourselves married in the full sense – there were no wedding photos or anything like that. It was really a marriage of convenience.&quot;

Theroux married his long-time girlfriend, Nancy Strang, on 13 July 2012. They have three sons together. In a 2012 masterclass, he spoke of the challenges of combining family life with the need to work on projects. They lived in the Harlesden area of London until temporarily moving to Los Angeles in early 2013, allowing him more time to focus on his &quot;LA Stories&quot; series. In 2017, they relocated to Los Angeles. Theroux and his family spent COVID-19 lockdowns at their home in North-West London.

Theroux is an atheist. He dabbled with cannabis at 17 and later said that, while he acknowledges that cannabis is an intoxicant and can trigger certain mental health issues, he supports its legalisation. He has also revealed that he has a fear of flying. In 2023, he announced that he suffers from alopecia that has caused facial hair loss.

In 2018, Theroux&#x27;s Twitter account was hacked by cybersecurity firm Insinia as part of their attempt to highlight a longstanding security flaw in Twitter&#x27;s system.

Theroux is a supporter of West London football club Queens Park Rangers.

<doc id="172052" wikidata="Q1015690" url="?curid=172052" title="Hastings, New Zealand">
<text>Hastings (; ) is an inland city of New Zealand and is one of the two major urban areas in Hawke&#x27;s Bay, on the east coast of the North Island. The population of Hastings (including Flaxmere) is (as of with a further people in Havelock North and in Clive. Hastings is about 18 kilometres inland of the coastal city of Napier. These two neighbouring cities are often called &quot;The Bay Cities&quot; or &quot;The Twin Cities&quot;.

The city is the administrative centre of the Hastings District. Since the merger of the surrounding and satellite settlements, Hastings has grown to become one of the largest urban areas in Hawke&#x27;s Bay.

Hastings District is a food production region. The fertile Heretaunga Plains surrounding the city produce stone fruits, pome fruit, kiwifruit and vegetables, and the area is one of New Zealand&#x27;s major red wine producers. Associated business include food processing, agricultural services, rural finance and freight. Hastings is the major service centre for the surrounding inland pastoral communities and tourism.

==History==
===Māori history===
Near the fourteenth century CE, Māori arrived in Heretaunga or Hawke&#x27;s Bay, settling in the river valleys and along the coast where food was plentiful. It is believed that Māori arrived at Heretaunga by canoe, travelling down the coast from the north, landing at Wairoa, Portland Island, the Ahuriri Lagoon at Westshore, and at Waimārama. Their culture flourished, causing gradual deforestation of the land. The forest was replaced by bracken, making this one of the few regions of New Zealand where sheep could be brought in by later European settlers without felling the bush first. In the sixteenth century, Taraia, great-grandson of the great and prolific chief Kahungunu, established the large tribe of Ngāti Kahungunu, which eventually colonised the eastern side of the North Island from Poverty Bay to Wairarapa. They were one of the first Māori tribes to come in contact with European settlers.

===European settlers&#x27; history===
The Māori owners leased approximately seventy square kilometres on the Heretaunga Plains to Thomas Tanner in 1867; Tanner had been trying to purchase the land since 1864. In 1870, twelve people, known as the &quot;12 apostles&quot;, formed a syndicate to purchase the land for around £1 10s an acre (£371 per km2). Many local people firmly believe that Hastings was originally named Hicksville, after Francis Hicks, who bought a block of land, which now contains the centre of Hastings, from Thomas Tanner. However, this story is apocryphal. The original name of the location which was to become the town centre was Karamu.

In 1870, Colonial Treasurer Julius Vogel launched the most ambitious development programme in New Zealand’s history. He proposed to borrow huge sums from Britain to revitalise and accelerate New Zealand development. One of the leading projects was the building of a national railway linking all main centres. Hawkes Bay development involved building a railway south from Napier and eventually to Palmerston North where it would connect to the proposed main trunk line. The decision on the route out of Napier was based largely on two reports by Charles Weber, the provincial engineer and surveyor in charge of the railways. Francis Hicks owned land in the central in the Heretaunga Plains and offered to donate land for a railway station. The offer was accepted and in 1873 Francis Hicks subdivided 100 acres into residential and suburban sections. On 7 June 1873, the &quot;Hawke&#x27;s Bay Herald&quot; reported: &quot;The name of the new town is to be Hastings. We hear it now for the first time.&quot; Exactly who chose the name has been disputed, although Thomas Tanner claimed that it was him (see &quot;Hawke&#x27;s Bay Herald&quot; report 1 February 1884) and that the choice was inspired by his reading the trial of Warren Hastings. In any event, the name fitted well with other place names in the district (Napier, Havelock and Clive), which were also named after prominent figures in the history of British India. In 1874, the first train took the twelve-mile (19 km) trip from Napier to Hastings, opening up Hastings as an export centre, through Port Ahuriri. 
Another big jump in the local economy occurred when Edward Newbigin opened a brewery in 1881. By the next year, there were 195 freeholders of land in the town of around six hundred people. The town was incorporated as a borough on 20 October 1886.

Hastings first received power in 1912, followed by Napier in 1915.

In 1918, nearly 300 people died of a flu epidemic that swept Hawke&#x27;s Bay.

===1931 Earthquake===
On 3 February 1931, at 10:47 am, most of Hastings (and nearby Napier) was levelled by an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter Scale. In Hastings, the ground subsided roughly 1 metre. The collapse of buildings and the ensuing fires killed 258 people, of which 93 were in Hastings. The centre of Hastings was destroyed in the earthquake, and was subsequently rebuilt in the Art Deco and Spanish Mission styles, which were both popular at that time. Due to quick thinking by residents and the Local Fire Department, Hastings did not suffer the extent of fire damage that Napier did. Most deaths were attributed to collapsing buildings, namely Roaches&#x27; Department Store in Heretaunga Street where 17 people died.

The Hastings Clock Tower was commissioned in 1934 by the Hastings Borough Council as a symbol of triumph over the adversity to celebrate the rebuild of Hastings. The design was by competition, which was won by local architect Sydney Chaplin. In 1995 the Hastings District Council added two memorial plaques to the base of tower in memory of those who died in the earthquake.

===1932 to 1999===


During World War II, Allied troops were billeted at the Army, Navy and Air Force (ANA) Club, and in private homes. One hundred and fifty members belonging to sixteen different local clubs packed supplies to be sent to Allied soldiers. In 1954, Hastings was the first city in New Zealand to introduce fluoridation of its water supply. The intention was to compare the effect on tooth decay with that in the unfluoridated city of Napier over a ten-year period. The study was criticised for its methodology and results, and remains controversial.

On 10 September 1960, the Hastings Blossom Parade (at the time a significant national event) was cancelled at 11 am for the first time in its history due to rain. Parade attendees drank in bars for several hours and when, subsequently, an &#x27;impromptu&#x27; parade began at 2 pm, a riot started as police tried to arrest those intoxicated in public. This was considered a significant event in New Zealand society, with modern youth rebellion culture being labelled antisocial, and was subsequently much publicised with the national election later that year.

Hastings grew rapidly throughout the 1960s and 1970s (Hastings at this time was the fastest growing city in New Zealand), and there was a major issue dealing with encroachment of suburban expansion on highly productive land. Flaxmere was established as a satellite suburb to absorb rapid growth and was built upon the stony, arid soils of the abandoned course of the Ngaruroro River. Although the land seemed worthless back then, it has subsequently proved highly valued for grape growing, and now is a prized region of red wine varietals in the world-famous Gimblett Gravels wine-growing region. Starting with economic decline nationally in the late 1970s, coupled with agricultural subsidy reforms in the early 1980s, Hastings went into recession with more unemployment and low economic growth. It was not until the mid-1990s that the economy of Hastings began to turn around.

During the 1989 local government reforms Hastings City amalgamated with the Havelock North Borough and Hawke&#x27;s Bay County to form the modern Hastings District. The County Council offices in Napier were closed in favour of Hastings, and the new Hastings District Council offices were built on two sites. The Napier City boundary was expanded to include Bay View and Meeanee. However, unlike largely urban Napier (population density 540.0 per km2), much of the newly formed Hastings District is rural and sparsely populated (population density 14.0 per km2), the Hastings District has approximately residents.

Because of their proximity to each other and their relatively small populations, Hastings and Napier are often seen as candidates for further amalgamation. This was attempted with the 1999 Amalgamation Referendum, where 75% of Napier residents opposed, and 64% of Hastings residents were in support.

===2000 to today===
At 11.25 pm on 25 August 2008, the city was hit by an earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale. The epicentre was based only 10 km south of the city, near Mt Erin, at a depth of 32 km. The earthquake caused minor damage to shops, where stock was shaken off shelves. Power outages were also reported. This was the most powerful earthquake to hit the region since the 5.8 Hastings earthquake in October 2001.

In 2010, the city, together with New Plymouth became one of the two walking and cycling &quot;model communities&quot;, qualifying for further co-funding by the national government to improve its walking paths and cycleways, and encourage people to use active forms of transport.

In August–September 2016, 5,200 people after the local water supply in Havelock North tested positive for the pathogen &quot;Campylobacter jejeuni&quot;. One death in a nursing home was suspected to be due to the outbreak. It is suspected that after heavy rain fell on 5–6 August, water contamination from flooding caused the outbreak, although this is the subject of a government Inquiry. It is the largest outbreak of waterborne disease ever to occur in New Zealand. All schools in Havelock North closed for two weeks, with the Hastings District Council advising an urgent notice to boil water for at least one minute before consumption. This notice was lifted on September the 3rd, with the outbreak officially under control.

Chlorination of the Havelock North water supply started on Friday the 12th, and 9 water tankers were brought in containing water from the Hastings water supply. One of these trucks again tested positive for E-Coli contamination, prompting the Hastings District Council to chlorinate the water supply of both Hastings and Flaxmere as a precautionary measure.

In November 2017, Sandra Hazlehurst, formerly Councilor for Hastings-Havelock North Ward, became the first woman Mayor of Hastings. Hazlehurst was elected as a result of a by-election triggered by the formal resignation of Mayor Lawrence Yule in June.

==Geography and climate==
Located on New Zealand&#x27;s east coast, to the east of the Central Plateau and the rain shadow of the Kaweka Ranges, Hastings is situated on the fertile alluvial Heretaunga Plains. The plains were originally covered in swamp and mangroves, but have since been drained for agriculture. The local area is very productive, with orchards, farms and vineyards, and lies upon New Zealand&#x27;s most economically valuable aquifer. Hastings lies roughly 250 km north-east of the nation&#x27;s capital Wellington (294 km by road) and 350 km south-east of the largest city, Auckland (429 km by road).

Hastings enjoys an oceanic climate (according to Köppen climate classification). Sunshine hours rank over 2200 annually while rainfall averages less than 800 mm (31.5 in). It is one of the country&#x27;s warmest urban areas annually. Because of its location inland, the sea breeze does not tend to have the same effect on Hastings&#x27; climate as it does on Napier. It is not uncommon for the temperature to be in the low 30 °C&#x27;s (90 °F) on summer days, while in winter, days of 15 °C+ (60 °F) are frequent, occasionally exceeding 20 °C (68 °F) with north-west winds. Winters tend to be quite still and crisp with frequent frosts, followed by bright, sunny days.

==Demographics==
Due to restrictions on encroachment of land, satellite suburbs have absorbed the residential expansion of the city. Compared to other cities of similar size, Hastings has grown relatively quickly since it was settled in 1864 (over 150 years ago). Hastings is known for its gridiron city planning system, crisscrossed by the railway line running northeast–southwest and the main southeast–northwest artery, Heretaunga Street, which also links the city with its suburban centres of Havelock North and Flaxmere.

Many Hastings residents work in the city, and the area is populated by middle-to-upper income families, particularly in Havelock North and then middle-to-lower income families in other areas, namely Camberley and the north end of Flaxmere.

The Hastings urban area had a usual resident population of 44,940 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 5,019 people (12.6%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 5,724 people (14.6%) since the 2006 census. There were 21,804 males and 23,136 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.94 males per female. Of the total population, 10,593 people (23.6%) were aged up to 15 years, 9,528 (21.2%) were 15 to 29, 18,210 (40.5%) were 30 to 64, and 6,603 (14.7%) were 65 or older.

In terms of ethnicity, 60.2% of the population identified as European (Pākehā), 35.4% as Māori, 12.2% as Pacific peoples, 8.1% as Asian, and 1.4% as other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).

===Redevelopment===
Architecturally speaking, Hastings suffered similarly to Napier in the 1931 Hawke&#x27;s Bay earthquake. However, because of the lesser damage by fire, Hastings maintained more pre earthquake buildings. Both towns gained a legacy from the disaster by rebuilding in the then-fashionable and highly distinctive Art Deco style, similar to that of Miami, Florida, USA. Hastings also possesses a large amount of Spanish Mission architecture (popular as with Art Deco in the early 1930s). However, Hastings succumbed to rapid redevelopment in the 1960s and 70s, which saw many 1930s buildings replaced.

By the end of the twentieth century, Hastings, along with most of New Zealand, was suffering from the recent economic downturn with industries and freezing works closing due to the agricultural subsidy reforms in the early 1980s. However, after multimillion-dollar regeneration projects and the employment of artists, Hastings has seen a change in its aesthetics. A CBD strategy was enforced to revitalise the central retail core, while promoting Havelock North as a &#x27;luxury boutique&#x27; destination. The strategy proved extremely successful, and Hastings vacancy rates hit an all-time low in 2005. The current goal of the council is to continue developing Hastings CBD to attract additional national chains, while attracting more cafes and entertainment venues is currently active in the eastern blocks of Heretaunga St.

The Hastings District Council has recently relocated and consequently rebuilt the Hastings Sports Park at a new facility on the edge of the Hastings urban area to make way for a large megacentre, also known as &quot;large format stores&quot;. A comprehensive study was conducted before the sale, concluding that retaining big box development within the CBD will help boutique stores prosper as opposed to locating the development on a greenfield site. Charter Hall, the developers behind &#x27;The Park&#x27; megacentre, had confirmed as of August 2010, the major anchors of the development will be the relocation of Hawkes Bay&#x27;s largest &#x27;The Warehouse&#x27; and the relocation of the cities&#x27; Mitre 10 Mega. The new sports park is proposed as a regional facility and includes a velodrome, all-weather athletics track and sports grounds for most other sporting codes represented in NZ sport. Since its completion, the Hastings sports park now hosts multiple tennis courts, netball courts and an internationally recognised hockey turf.

==Horse of the Year show==
Hawkes Bay A&amp;P Showgrounds in Hastings is the home to the annual NZ Horse of the Year show, held in March. It is one of the biggest sporting events in the Southern Hemisphere, and attracts 2500 horse and rider combinations competing in 19 disciplines including Dressage, Showhunter, Eventing, Showjumping, polocrosse and many breed classes. It has a budget of around NZ$3 million, and attracts over 70,000 visitors from over NZ and internationally over the five-day show.

==Suburbs==
City suburbs:
* Hastings Ward: Akina, Camberley, Frimley, Hastings Central, Mahora, Mayfair, Parkvale, Raureka, St Leonards, Stortford Lodge, Tomoana, Waipatu, Whakatu
* Havelock North Ward: Havelock North Central, Anderson Park, Iona, Te Mata, Te Mata Hills,

Outlying communities: Bridge Pa, Karamu, Longlands, Mangateretere, Maraekakaho, Omahu/Fernhill, Pakipaki, Pukahu, Twyford.

==Transport==
===Road===
Hastings is served by State Highway 2, which connects Hastings with Napier, Wairoa and Gisborne to the north and (via Dannevirke) Wellington, Masterton and Palmerston North to the south. SH 2 used to run through Hastings. Due to the road layout of Hastings, SH 2&#x27;s northern and southern sections did not meet up. There once was a point in SH 2&#x27;s continuation where there was a gap. SH 2 now connects Hastings to Napier through the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Expressway, and provides a more direct link between the two cities and to both Hawke&#x27;s Bay Airport and Port of Napier for heavy-vehicle traffic coming from Hastings. The former designation of SH 2 is now State Highway 51. SH 51 enters and exits Hastings in a north-east direction. Heading north-east, it passes through residential Hastings, then follows the Clive River through the towns of Whakatu and Clive, bridges across the Clive, Tutaekuri and Ngaruroro Rivers before following the coast into Napier.

State Highway 50 begins at a junction just north of Takapau, and connects Hastings and Hawke&#x27;s Bay to the Ruataniwha Valley and western Hawke&#x27;s Bay. It provides an alternative, quieter and (in terms of distance) shorter route into Hawke&#x27;s Bay. It also connects Hastings to many of Hawke&#x27;s Bay&#x27;s wineries, for which the region is known internationally. It makes up part of the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Wine Trail.

==== Buses ====
Go Bus operates 9 &quot;Go Bay&quot; routes in Hastings, with funding from Regional Council. Bee Cards replaced goBay cards on 24 August 2020.

===Rail===

The Palmerston North–Gisborne Line (PNGL) is a secondary main line railway that runs through the centre of Hastings (a planned feature unique to the city) and joins the North Island Main Trunk railway near Palmerston North. The railway divides Hastings from southwest to northeast and cuts off many of the main streets in the centre of the city, many being labelled as east or west depending on what side of the railway they originate from. Passenger services ran to Hastings until it was closed in 2001, and the Hastings railway station is now a major centre for freight services along the PNGL and provides the Port of Napier with many of its freight exports.

==Infrastructure and services==
===Utilities===
The Hastings Borough Council established the city&#x27;s first public electricity supply in 1912, with electricity generated by two diesel engines in Eastbourne Street. Originally, electricity was supplied using a 230/460-volt three-wire DC system, converting to the now-standard 230/400-volt three-phase AC system in the 1920s. Hastings was connected to the Mangahao hydroelectric scheme in 1927, and the Waikaremoana hydroelectric scheme in 1929. The Hawke&#x27;s Bay Electric Power Board took over from the borough council in 1935.

The 1998 electricity sector reforms saw the electric power board (then named Hawke&#x27;s Bay Power) sell its retail base to Contact Energy, with the remaining lines business renamed Hawke&#x27;s Bay Networks and later Unison Networks. Today, Unison Networks continues to own and operate the local electricity distribution network servicing the city, with electricity fed into it primarily from the Transpower substations at Fernhill and Whakatu.

Natural gas arrived in Napier and Hastings in 1983, with the completion of the high-pressure pipeline from Palmerston North to Hastings. The high-pressure transmission pipelines supplying the city are now owned and operated by First Gas, with Powerco owning and operating the local natural gas distribution network. In February 2004, the city and wider Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region lost natural gas supply for six days after a flood washed away a bridge near Ashhurst supporting the high-pressure pipeline to the region.

<text>Nigel Edward Buxton (29 May 1924 – 30 November 2015) was a British travel writer and wine critic, also known for appearing as  in the Channel 4 comedy series &quot;The Adam and Joe Show&quot;.

==Early life==

Buxton was born at Cowfold, Sussex, where his father, Gordon Offord Buxton, worked as a &#x27;general factotum&#x27; at Brook Hill House, owned by Lt-Col Edward William (&#x27;Robert&#x27;) Hermon of the 1st King Edward&#x27;s Horse, to whom the elder Buxton had been a servant since 1908, accompanying him as his batman during World War I.

==Career==

===Travel writer===

After education at Collyer&#x27;s Grammar School, Horsham and the Imperial Service College, Windsor, followed by the University of Glasgow and Worcester College, Oxford, at the latter of which he read Modern History, graduating in 1954, Buxton became travel columnist – later travel editor – of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; in 1961.

===BaaadDad===

In the 1990s, Buxton appeared as &quot;BaaadDad&quot; on &quot;The Adam and Joe Show&quot; on Channel 4, which was written and presented by his son Adam Buxton along with Adam&#x27;s friend Joe Cornish. The comedy behind the character of BaaadDad was the juxtaposition of the fact that he was clearly an elderly and upper middle class man with the topics that he discusses, which relate to youth culture – clubbing, drug use, and so on. As this character, he featured in the video for Frank Black&#x27;s single &quot;Dog Gone&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

During the Second World War, having been commissioned in the Royal Artillery in 1943, Buxton served in France and Germany. Prior to his journalistic career, Buxton also served as assistant adjutant in India during the last days of the British Raj. With his wife, Valerie (née Birrell), Buxton had a daughter and two sons.

Buxton wrote several books, including &quot;A Penguin Guide to Travel in Europe&quot;, published by Penguin in 1965, &quot;Travel &#x27;67&quot;, published by Follett in 1967, and &quot;Walking in Wine Country&quot;, published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in 1993.

Buxton died from complications arising from lung cancer at his son Adam Buxton&#x27;s Norfolk home on 30 November 2015.

<text>Corinne Griffith (née Griffin; November 21, 1894 – July 13, 1979) was an American film actress, producer, author and businesswoman. Dubbed &quot;The Orchid Lady of the Screen,&quot; she was widely regarded as one of the most beautiful actresses of the silent film era. In addition to her beauty, Griffith achieved critical recognition for her performance in Frank Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Lady&quot; (1929), which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Originally from Texas, Griffith pursued a film career after winning a beauty contest in Southern California. In 1916, she signed a contract with Vitagraph Studios, appearing in numerous films for the studio through the remainder of the decade. In 1920, she began making films for First National Pictures and became one of the studio&#x27;s bigger stars. In the mid-1920s, she began executive-producing features and served as a producer on 1925&#x27;s &quot;Déclassée&quot; and &quot;Classified&quot;, in both of which she starred.

In the latter part of the 1920s, Griffith&#x27;s film career slowed, though she had lead performances in &quot;Outcast&quot; (1928) and the drama &quot;The Garden of Eden&quot; (also 1928). The following year, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;The Divine Lady&quot;. She starred in &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot;, a remake of the 1924 film in which she had also starred. Her following film, &quot;Back Pay&quot; (1930), was promoted as Griffith&#x27;s final screen appearance before her retirement. She did, however, appear as the lead in &quot;Lily Christine&quot; (1932) two years later.

After 1932, Griffith retired from acting and became a successful author and businesswoman, writing numerous fiction and non-fiction books, as well as venturing into real estate, in which she had begun investing in the 1920s. She married her third husband, Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall, in 1936, and remained married to him until 1958. She made her final film appearance with a minor role in &quot;Paradise Alley&quot; (1962), which marked her first screen appearance in 28 years. A biographical film about Griffith was released in 1963 titled &quot;Papa&#x27;s Delicate Condition&quot;, based on her 1952 memoir and focusing on the relationship between her and her father. After suffering a stroke in July 1979, Griffith was hospitalized in Santa Monica, California, where she died shortly after of a heart attack. She left behind a reported estate of $150 million, making her one of the wealthier women in the world at that time.

==Biography==
===1894–1932: Early life and Vitagraph films===
Griffith was born Corinne Griffin on November 21, 1894 in Waco, Texas, one of two daughters born to John Lewis &quot;Jack&quot; Griffin, a Methodist minister and train conductor of the Texas &amp; Pacific railway, and Amboline Ghio. Griffith&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Antonio Ghio, was an Italian immigrant who became a successful businessman in Texas and was a three-time mayor of Texarkana; her maternal grandmother, Maria Anthes, also an immigrant, was a native of Darmstadt, Germany. At the time of Griffith&#x27;s birth, her mother Amboline was in her early 20s, while her father, John, was nearly 40. Griffith&#x27;s parents had married in 1887, and the wedding was a celebrated event among local high society.

Griffith and her sister were raised Catholic. Her early years were spent in Waco before the family moved to Texarkana, Texas, where Griffith lived until age 10; she moved to New Orleans, Louisiana to attend the Sacred Heart Convent school. Her father died in Mineral Wells, Texas on March 20, 1912. After completing her primary education, Griffin enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin for the 1912–1913 semester year. She also worked as a dancer before she began her acting career.

Accounts of Griffith&#x27;s entry into the film industry vary. At some point after her father&#x27;s death, Griffith left Texas and relocated with her mother and sister, Augusta, to Southern California. Some sources claim she was urged by Vitagraph Studios director Rollin S. Sturgeon to pursue an acting career after winning a beauty contest in Santa Monica, California, in which Sturgeon was a judge. According to another account, Griffith met Sturgeon at a high-society event in Crescent City, California, and he offered her a film contract on the spot. In a 1919 newspaper article, Griffith said she was approached by Sturgeon in New Orleans after she won a pageant during the Mardi Gras festival. According to Griffith, Sturgeon suggested she become an actress, and several months later she traveled to California to meet with executives at Vitagraph.

In 1916, she signed a $15-weekly contract with Vitagraph and took the stage name Corinne Griffith. She made her screen debut in a short film titled &quot;La Paloma&quot;, opposite Earle Williams. She appeared in a series of short films for the studio before becoming a leading lady. On April 22, 1920, Griffith married her first husband, Webster Campbell, in a private ceremony in Oceanside, California.

Griffith&#x27;s performance in one of her later films for Vitagraph, &quot;The Broadway Bubble&quot; (1920), was described by a critic of the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; as the &quot;strongest and most fascinating role in her notable career&quot; and lauded it as her &quot;crowning achievement.&quot;

===1923–1932: First National contract===

In 1923, after three years of marriage, Griffith divorced Campbell, whom she claimed was an abusive alcoholic. The same year, Griffith left Vitagraph Studios, signing a more lucrative contract of $10,000 a week with First National, where she became one of their most popular stars. Her first film for the studio was Frank Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Black Oxen&quot; (1923), a drama in which she portrayed a mysterious Austrian countess. The film, in which Griffith co-starred with Conway Tearle and Clara Bow, became a hit.

Griffith married producer Walter Morosco in February, 1924. The same year, she starred in and executive-produced three pictures: &quot;Single Wives&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Wilderness&quot;, and &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot;. All three of the films were box-office hits. By 1927, Griffith had begun investing her film income in real estate and owned approximately $500,000 worth of properties.

In 1928, she had the starring role in &quot;The Garden of Eden&quot; for United Artists which, though critically praised, was not a box-office hit. Disappointed by the film&#x27;s lackluster dividends, Griffith returned to First National to appear in Frank Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Lady&quot; (1929), a sound film featuring synchronized music, but no audible dialogue. Griffith earned critical accolades for her performance, including a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Griffith&#x27;s first full sound film was &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot;, a remake of her 1924 silent film in the same role. Griffith&#x27;s voice, which was regarded as nasal, did not record well (&quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that she &quot;talked through her nose&quot;), and the film was a box office flop. The following year, she starred in the drama &quot;Back Pay&quot; (1930), based on a story by Fannie Hurst, which was promoted as her final screen appearance. After a two-year hiatus, Griffith starred in the British film &quot;Lily Christine&quot; (1932) and then left the public eye completely.

===1933–1964: Post-film career===
After her retirement from film, Griffith divorced Morosco in 1934. Two years later, she married businessman and Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall. In December 1941, the couple adopted two daughters, Pamela and Cynthia. In the early years of her marriage to Marshall, she wrote the lyrics to the truly racist original fight song, &quot;Hail to the Redskins&quot;.

In the 1940s, Griffith began investing in real estate in the Los Angeles area. She funded the construction of four commercial buildings on all four corners of the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and South Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills, California. The construction of the buildings, each named after her, proved lucrative, and she turned down an offer of $2.5 million for them in 1950. The same year, she spoke at the inaugural National Association of Real Estate Boards convention in Florida. &quot;I liked the vacant business lots I saw in Beverly Hills with the For Sale signs on them,&quot; she recalled. &quot;They were so near the beautiful homes there in that section and I couldn&#x27;t help but feel that someday the business section would grow up to the great buying power of these wealthy estates.&quot;
In addition to her real estate ventures, beginning in the 1950s, Griffith became a vocal supporter of repealing the 16th Amendment, which authorized income tax. Over the ensuing decade, she gave approximately 500 speeches on the subject. Commenting on her dedication to the topic, she stated: &quot;We have no substitute of other taxes because we have no substitute for waste, graft and corruption. If the federal government will eliminate only part of its waste, just 40 billions of dollars a year of its waste...  I can prove to you in dollars and cents that the government does not need the income tax.&quot; Griffith also spoke in support of women seeking their own financial autonomy: &quot;I got my money without the help of any man. Women wise enough to earn their own money will get a broader understanding of life, a new respect from their husbands and a bank account which they can use without resorting to the old tricks that sicken every wife at heart.&quot;

Griffith was also an accomplished writer who published eleven books, including two best-sellers, &quot;My Life with the Redskins&quot; (1947), and the memoir &quot;Papa&#x27;s Delicate Condition&quot; (1952), which chronicled her upbringing and family life in Texarkana. Her third publication, 1955&#x27;s &quot;Eggs I Have Known&quot;, was a recipe book with gossipy anecdotes interspersed. In 1958, Griffith divorced Marshall (who she referred to in print as &quot;The Marshall &quot;without&quot; a plan&quot;). In 1960, she was honored for her contributions to the motion picture industry with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street. She later published her fourth book, &quot;Antiques I Have Known&quot;, a non-fiction book about her interest in antiques. Griffith returned to the screen in 1962 in the low-budget melodrama &quot;Paradise Alley&quot;, which received scant release and marked her final film role. Also in 1962, she published two books: &quot;Hollywood Stories&quot;, a selection of short fiction, and &quot;Taxation Without Representation—or, Your Money Went That-a-Way&quot;, which argued against the income tax. The following year, her memoir &quot;Papa&#x27;s Delicate Condition&quot; was made into a biographical feature film of the same name starring Jackie Gleason.

===1965–1979: Claims about identity and final years===
In February 1965, she married her fourth husband, Broadway actor Danny Scholl in Alexandria, Virginia. Scholl was 44 years old, more than 25 years younger than Griffith. The couple separated after two months of marriage. Within the year, Griffith filed for a divorce after a judge denied her motion for an annulment; she contended that the marriage had not been consummated. Pending trial, she was ordered to pay Scholl alimony of $200 per month beginning in December 1964.

During the divorce court proceedings in May 1966, Griffith testified that she was actually not Corinne Griffith. She instead claimed that she was Corinne&#x27;s younger sister, who, although twenty years younger, had taken Corinne&#x27;s place when she died in 1924. She also denied having married her former two husbands, Webster Campbell and Walter Morosco. In court, Scholl&#x27;s attorney proposed that Griffith had falsified her age in the couple&#x27;s marriage documents as well as failed to disclose her previous two marriages. Upon being questioned about her age, Griffith refused to comment, stating that her religion, Christian Science, prevented her from publicly disclosing it. She also claimed not to have kept record of her age since she was 13 years old. Actresses Betty Blythe and Claire Windsor, who had both known Griffith since the 1920s, contradicted her testimony, but did not shake her story, and she continued to claim that she was in fact Corinne&#x27;s sister.

In a subsequent interview, Griffith further complicated her story, claiming to be Corinne&#x27;s twin named Mary, rather than her younger sister: 
In the same interview, she stated that Corinne had been buried in an unmarked grave in Mexico.

Following the publicity surrounding her divorce and identity claims, Griffith spent the remainder of her years writing. In 1969, she published &quot;Not for Men Only – but Almost&quot;, a non-fiction book detailing the appeal of sports to men and its lack of appeal for most women. She published another collection of personal non-fiction stories titled &quot;This You Won&#x27;t Believe&quot; in 1972. Her final book &quot;I&#x27;m Lucky at Cards&quot; (1974) was a book of her essays.

==Screen and public image==
Griffith was lauded by numerous publications for her beauty. Valeria Beletti, a secretary of Samuel Goldwyn, described Griffith as &quot;the most beautiful of all the silent stars, talented or otherwise,&quot; despite the fact that she personally found Griffith abrasive: &quot;very haughty and disdainful. She looks at no one but her dogs, and is generally disliked by all.&quot; According to biographer Anthony Slide, the common phrase &quot;the camera loves her&quot; was coined for Griffith.

In addition to her appearance, Griffith took efforts to maintain a decorous and healthful image, claiming never to have smoked or drunk alcohol. She also avoided swearing and refrained from wearing make-up when not appearing on film. Columnist Adela Rogers St. Johns once referred to Griffith as &quot;innocence personified.&quot;

==Death==
Griffith suffered a stroke in early July 1979, brought on by cerebral arteriosclerosis, and was hospitalized at Saint John&#x27;s Hospital in Santa Monica, California. She died there shortly after of a heart attack on July 13, aged 84. Her sister Augusta, from whom she had been estranged, had died only weeks earlier. Griffith&#x27;s remains were cremated by the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles and buried at sea in the Pacific Ocean. At the time of her death, Griffith&#x27;s estate was valued at $150 million, principally real estate.

They generally have a long shaft and taper at their end, but they are not nearly as sharp as sewing needles. Their purpose is two-fold. The long shaft &quot;holds&quot; the active (unsecured) stitches of the fabric, to prevent them from unravelling, whereas the tapered ends are used to &quot;form new stitches&quot;. Most commonly, a new stitch is formed by inserting the tapered end through an active stitch, catching a loop (also called a bight) of fresh yarn and drawing it through the stitch; this secures the initial stitch and forms a new active stitch in its place. In specialized forms of knitting the needle may be passed between active stitches being held on another needle, or indeed between/through inactive stitches that have been knit previously.

The size of a needle is described first by its diameter and secondly by its length. The size of the new stitch is determined in large part by the diameter of the knitting needle used to form it, because that affects the length of the yarn-loop drawn through the previous stitch. Thus, large stitches can be made with large needles, whereas fine knitting requires fine needles. In most cases, the knitting needles being used in hand-knitting are of the same diameter; however, in uneven knitting, needles of different sizes may be used. Larger stitches may also be made by wrapping the yarn more than once around the needles with every stitch. The length of a needle determines how many stitches it can hold at once; for example, very large projects such as a shawl with hundreds of stitches might require a longer needle than a small project such as a scarf or bootie. Various sizing systems for needles are in common use.

==Types==

===Single-pointed needles===

The most widely recognized form of needle is the single-pointed needle. It is a slender, straight stick tapered to a point at one end, with a knob at the other end to prevent stitches from slipping off. Such needles are always used in pairs and are usually 10-16 inches (25.4–40.6 cm) long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider. The knitting of new stitches occurs only at the tapered ends. Fictional depictions of knitting in movies, television programs, animation, and comic strips almost always show knitting done on straight needles. Both Wallace and Gromit and Monty Python, for example, show this type of knitting.
=== Flexible single-pointed needles ===
Flexible single-pointed needles are used as single-pointed needles.

Flexible single-pointed needles have a rigid needle part, a plastic cable and a stopper at the end of the cable.

Flexible single-pointed needles can be bought readymade, or it is possible to make them yourself, if you have a set of interchangeable circular knitting needles and cables and stoppers.

===Double-pointed needles===

The oldest type of needle is the straight double-pointed needle. Double-pointed needles are tapered at both ends, which allows them to be knit from either end. They are typically used (and sold) in sets of four or five, and are commonly used for circular knitting. Since the invention of the circular needle, they have been most commonly used to knit smaller tube-shaped pieces, such as sleeves, collars, and socks. Usually two needles are active while the others hold the remaining stitches. Double-pointed needles are somewhat shorter than single-pointed or circular needles and are usually used in the 13–20 cm length range, although they are also made longer.

Double-pointed needles are depicted in a number of 14th-century oil paintings, typically called &quot;Knitting Madonnas&quot;, depicting Mary knitting with double-pointed needles (Rutt, 2003).
A cable needle is a special type of double-pointed needle that is typically very short and used to hold a very small number of stitches temporarily while the knitter is forming a cable pattern. They are often U-shaped, or have a U-shaped bend, to keep the held stitches from falling off while the primary needle is being used.

===Circular needles===

The first US patent for a circular needle was issued in 1918, although in Europe they may have been used a little earlier. Circulars are composed of two pointed, straight tips connected by a flexible cable and may be used for both knitting flat or knitting in the round. The two tapered ends, typically 4–5 inches (10.5–13 cm) long, are rigid, allowing for easy knitting, and are connected by the flexible strand (usually made of nylon or coated wire). The tips may be permanently connected to the cable and made in overall lengths from to or composed of cables and interchangeable tips. This allows various lengths and diameters to be combined into many different sizes of needles, allowing for a great variety of needs to be met by a relatively few component pieces. The ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting.

In using circulars to knit flat pieces of fabric the two ends are used just as two separate needles would be. The knitter holds one tip in each hand and knits straight across the width of the fabric, turns the work, and knits or purls back the other way. Using circular needles has some advantages, for example, the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed, therefore less taxing, on the arms and wrists of the knitter and, the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the knitter rather than extending straight out past the arms.

The lack of a purl row in stockinette stitch, since in the round (commonly referred to as ITR) knitting is all done using the knit stitch, is often perceived to be one of the greatest benefits of ITR. Knitting ITR with circulars is done in a spiral, the same way as using double-pointed needles (usually called DPNs). Additionally, circulars eliminate the need to continually switch from one needle to the next, and there is no possibility of stitches falling off the back end of the needles, as may happen when using DPNs. Much larger tubes may be knit ITR, too, helping items to be completed more quickly. Construction of garments such as sweaters may be greatly simplified when knitting ITR, since the finishing steps of sewing a back, two fronts, and two sleeves of a sweater together may be almost entirely eliminated in neck down ITR knitting.

Knitting educator and authority Elizabeth Zimmermann helped popularize knitting ITR specifically with circular needles.

 Numerous techniques have been devised for the production of narrow tubular knitting on circular needles. One common method is to use two needles in place of the four or five double-pointed needles traditionally used, while a newer technique is to use one circular needle that is significantly longer than the circumference of the item being knitted. This technique is known as Magic Loop and has recently become a popular method of producing tubular knitting, as only one needle is required.

==The Guinness World Record for knitting with the largest knitting needles==
The current holder of this title is Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Bond who is a British art student and creator of the world&#x27;s largest knitting needles, which are 14 feet long. To achieve the world record in 2018, Bond needed to knit at least 10 stitches and 10 rows of yarn with her needles. The yarn she used for the feat was made of 35 pounds of machine knitted, hand-twisted cotton material.

She beats Julia Hopson of Penzance in Cornwall. Julia had knitted a tension square of ten stitches and ten rows in stocking stitch using knitting needles that were 6.5 cm in diameter and 3.5 metres long.

==Needle materials==
In addition to common wood and metal needles, antique knitting needles were sometimes made from tortoiseshell, ivory and walrus tusks; these materials are now banned due to their impact on endangered species, and needles made from them are virtually impossible to find.

There are, however, a now vintage style of needle which appears to be tortoiseshell, but is actually made from a celluloid, sometimes known as shellonite. These needles were made in Australia, but are no longer manufactured.

Modern knitting needles are made of bamboo, aluminium, steel, wood, plastic, glass, casein and carbon fibers.

==Needle storage==

A tall, cylindrical container with padding on the bottom to keep the points sharp can store straight needles neatly. Fabric or plastic cases similar to cosmetic bags or a chef&#x27;s knife bag allow straight needles to be stored together yet separated by size, then rolled to maximize space. Circular needles may be stored with the cables coiled in cases made specifically for this purpose or hung dangling from a hanger device with cables straight. If older circulars with the nylon or plastic cables are coiled for storage it may be necessary to soak them in hot water for a few minutes to get them to uncoil and relax for ease of use. Most recently manufactured cables eliminate this problem and may be stored coiled without any difficulty. Care must be taken not to kink the metal cables of older circulars, as these kinks will not come out and may damage or snag yarn as it is knit.
==Needle gauge==
A needle gauge makes it possible to determine the size of a knitting needle. Some may also be used to gauge the size of crochet hooks. Most needles come with the size written on them, but with use and time, the label often wears off, and many needles (like double-pointed needles) tend not to be labelled.

Needle gauges can be made of any material, but are often made of metal and plastic. They tend to be about 3 by 5 inches. There are holes of various sizes through which the needles are passed to determine which hole they fit best, and often a ruler along the edge for determining the tension (also called gauge) of a sample.

==Needle sizes and conversions==

In the UK, the metric system is used. Previously, needles &#x27;numbers&#x27; were the Standard Wire Gauge designation of the wire from which metal needles were made. The origin of the numbering system is uncertain but it is thought that needle numbers were based on the number of increasingly fine dies that the wire had to be drawn through. This meant thinner needles had a larger number.

In the current US system, things are opposite, that is, smaller numbers indicate smaller needles. There is an &quot;old US system&quot; that is divided into standard and steel needles, the latter being fine lace needles. Occasionally, older lace patterns will refer to these smaller needles in the old measurement system. Finally, there was a system used in continental Europe that predated the metric system. It is largely obsolete, but some older or reprinted patterns call for pins in these sizes.

<text>The Divine Lady is a 1928 American pre-Code Synchronized sound film. While the film has no audible dialog, it was released with a synchronized musical score with sound effects using the sound-on-disc Vitaphone process. It stars Corinne Griffith and tells the story of the love affair between Horatio Nelson and Emma Hamilton. It featured the theme song &quot;Lady Divine&quot;, with lyrics by Richard Kountz and music by Nathaniel Shilkret, which became a popular hit in 1929 and was recorded by numerous artists, such as Shilkret, Frank Munn, Ben Selvin (as the Cavaliers), Smith Ballew, Adrian Schubert, Sam Lanin, and Bob Haring.

The film was adapted by Harry Carr, Forrest Halsey, Agnes Christine Johnston, and Edwin Justus Mayer from the novel &quot;The Divine Lady: A Romance of Nelson and Emma Hamilton&quot; by E. Barrington. It was directed by Frank Lloyd.

The film won the Academy Award for Best Director and was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Corinne Griffith) and Best Cinematography. It is the only film to be awarded Best Director without a Best Picture nomination (one year earlier, &quot;Two Arabian Knights&quot; was awarded for Best Director of a Comedy Picture without being nominated for Best Picture).

==Plot==
In the late 18th century, Lady Hamilton has had a somewhat turbulent relationship with the British people, especially the aristocracy. Born Emma Hart from a very humble background (she being the daughter of a cook), she was seen as being vulgar by the rich, but equally captivating for her beauty. In a move to protect his inheritance, Honorable Charles Greville, Emma&#x27;s then lover and her mother&#x27;s employer, sent Emma to Naples under false pretenses to live with his uncle, Sir William Hamilton, where she would study to become a lady.

Surprisingly to Greville whose deception Emma would eventually discover, Emma ended up becoming Hamilton&#x27;s wife in a marriage of convenience. But it is Emma&#x27;s eventual relationship with Horatio Nelson of the British navy that would cause the largest issue. A move by Lady Hamilton helped Nelson&#x27;s armada defeat Napoleon&#x27;s fleet in naval battles, which Nelson would have ultimately lost without Lady Hamilton&#x27;s help. Beyond the dangers of war, Lady Hamilton and Nelson&#x27;s relationship is ultimately threatened by the court of public opinion as both are married to other people.

==Cast==
* Corinne Griffith as Emma Hart
* Victor Varconi as Horatio Nelson
* H. B. Warner as Sir William Hamilton
* Ian Keith as Honorable Charles Greville
* Marie Dressler as Mrs. Hart
* Montagu Love as Captain Hardy
* William Conklin as Romney
* Dorothy Cumming as Queen Maria Carolina
* Michael Vavitch as King Ferdinand
* Evelyn Hall as Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire
* Helen Jerome Eddy as Lady Nelson

==Music==
The film featured a theme song entitled “Lady Divine,” by Richard Kountz (words) and Nathaniel Shilkret (music). The song is sung off screen on the soundtrack by Frank Munn both solo and as a duet with Helen Clark. Also featured on the soundtrack is a song entitled “Pearl Of Mine” by Percy Fletcher.

==Preservation status==
The film still survives intact along with its Vitaphone soundtrack. This film was a joint preservation project of the UCLA Film and Television Archive and the Museum of Modern Art Department of Film in cooperation with the Czechoslovak Film Archive. It was restored in conjunction with the project American Moviemakers: The Dawn of Sound.

==Home media==
In 2009, the film was released on manufactured-on-demand DVD by the Warner Archive Collection.

<doc id="172063" wikidata="Q3092323" url="?curid=172063" title="Ribena">
<text>Ribena ( ) is a brand of blackcurrant-based soft drink (both uncarbonated and carbonated), and fruit drink concentrate designed to be mixed with water. It is available in bottles, cans and multi-packs. Originally of English origin, it was produced by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) until 2013, when the brand was sold to Japanese beverage conglomerate Suntory.

The brand originally had a strong reputation as a healthy product for children, stemming from its distribution to children as a vitamin C supplement during World War II by the British government. Beecham, a company that has been part of GSK since 2000, bought the brand in 1955 and developed many soft drink versions. A series of scandals in the 2000s, concerning vitamin C levels, sugar levels, and the amounts of actual fruit in some of the brands, damaged its reputation as a healthy product, and by 2013, the brand was widely regarded as a soft drink.

In 2013, annual worldwide sales were around £500 million. That year, GSK sold Ribena and another consumer line, Lucozade, to the Japanese multinational Suntory for £1.35 billion (equivalent to £ in ). In April 2018, in the United Kingdom, Ribena&#x27;s longstanding recipe was changed by the addition of artificial sweeteners in response to the introduction of a sugary drinks tax by the UK government.

== History ==
=== Development ===
Ribena was originally manufactured in England by the Bristol-based food and drink company HW Carter as a blackcurrant squash. Development research into pure fruit syrups for the manufacture of milkshakes had been done at the Long Ashton Agriculture and Horticulture Research Station in North Somerset using a pectinase enzyme process; Ribena was developed by biochemist Audrey Green and Vernon Charley, a scientist at the University of Bristol in 1933. The blackcurrant variety was found to contain high levels of vitamin C. The drink was named Ribena (from the botanical name of the blackcurrant, &quot;Ribes nigrum&quot;), by Mr S. M. Lennox of Bristol in 1938.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, other fruits rich in vitamin C, like oranges, became very difficult to obtain in the United Kingdom, due to German submarine attacks on cargo ships. Blackcurrant cultivation was encouraged by the government, and the yield of the nation&#x27;s crop increased significantly. Rose hips were also collected to make syrup.

The government started the Vitamin Welfare Scheme in December 1941. This provided blackcurrant syrup and cod liver oil free of charge to children under the age of two. In April 1942, the blackcurrant syrup was replaced by orange juice which was then provided by the US Lend-Lease program.

===Post-war===
Production moved to the new Royal Forest Factory at Coleford in the Forest of Dean in late 1947, where production takes place today.

Carters was bought out by the Beecham Group in 1955. In 1989, Beecham and SmithKline Beckman merged to form SmithKline Beecham, and in 2000, SmithKline Beecham and GlaxoWellcome merged to form GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

Through the years GSK and its predecessors developed many soft drink versions of Ribena but it retained an image as a &quot;healthy food&quot; in the UK and other Commonwealth countries.

In 2001, a formulation of the diluted Ribena cordial, sold as Ribena Toothkind (and endorsed by the British Dental Association as being less damaging to teeth than other soft drinks), was judged by the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority to have been advertised in a misleading manner, and claims that the drink did not encourage tooth decay should be removed from the packaging. The opinion was upheld by a hearing in the High Court. In 2003, the Food Commission in the United Kingdom criticised the sugar levels in regular Ribena as contributing to childhood obesity.

In 2004, Jenny Suo and a classmate in a New Zealand secondary school conducted a science experiment to determine the vitamin C levels of their favourite fruit drinks. They discovered that the &quot;Ready to Drink Ribena&quot; product they tested had undetectable levels of vitamin C, contrary to the brand&#x27;s reputation and advertisements which said that &quot;the blackcurrants in Ribena contain four times the vitamin C of oranges&quot;. The television consumer affairs show &quot;Fair Go&quot; broadcast the story nationwide in October 2004. Following further testing, in March 2007, the New Zealand Commerce Commission brought 15 charges in the Auckland District Court against GlaxoSmithKline under the Fair Trading Act. In March 2007, GSK pleaded guilty and was fined NZ$217,500 () by Auckland District Court for misleading consumers, and were ordered to run a series of corrective advertisements and place a statement on its website. GSK maintained the issue only affects Australia and New Zealand, and Ribena products sold in other markets, such as the United Kingdom, contain the levels of vitamin C stated on the product label.
In January 2007, a study conducted by the Australian Consumers&#x27; Association for &quot;Choice&quot; magazine reported that blackcurrant juice (from concentrate) only constituted 5% of the Ribena fruit drink product.

By 2013, the brand had annual worldwide sales of about £500 million. In April 2013, GSK put Ribena, along with Lucozade, up for sale to focus on its pharmaceutical business. The eventual sale to Japanese company Suntory for £1.35 billion was announced in September 2013.

A sparkling version released in 2011 but discontinued in 2014. It was brought back to supermarket shelves in 2020, launching in two flavours, blackcurrant and raspberry. This was in response to growth in the flavoured carbonate market that year.

In 2022, as part of a promotion with Hasbro, a Ribena themed Monopoly edition was created. This set was distributed to 10,000 customers through an online competition.

<text>Paul Edward Theroux (; born April 10, 1941) is an American novelist and travel writer who has written numerous books, including the travelogue &quot;The Great Railway Bazaar&quot; (1975). Some of his works of fiction have been adapted as feature films. He was awarded the 1981 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel &quot;The Mosquito Coast,&quot; which was adapted for the 1986 movie of the same name and the 2021 television series of the same name.

He is the father of English-American authors and documentary filmmakers Marcel and Louis Theroux, the brother of authors Alexander Theroux and Peter Theroux, and uncle of the American actor and screenwriter Justin Theroux.

==Early life==
Paul Theroux was born in Medford, Massachusetts, the third of seven children, and son of Catholic parents; his mother, Anne (née Dittami), was Italian American, and his father, Albert Eugene Theroux, was of French-Canadian descent. His mother was a former grammar school teacher and painter, and his father was a shoe factory leather salesman for the American Leather Oak company. Theroux was a Boy Scout and ultimately achieved the rank of Eagle Scout.

His brothers are Eugene, Alexander, Joseph and Peter. His sisters are Ann Marie and Mary.

Theroux was educated at Medford High School, followed by the University of Maine, in Orono (1959–60), and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he obtained a B.A. in English in 1963.

According to his older brother Alexander, Paul affects a &quot;fake British accent&quot; despite growing up in a working-class Boston suburb.

==Career==

After finishing his university education, Theroux joined the Peace Corps in 1963 as a teacher in Malawi. In a later life interview, he described himself as an &quot;angry and agitated young man&quot; who felt he had to escape the confines of Massachusetts and a hostile U.S. foreign policy. At the time, the Peace Corps was relatively new, having sent its first volunteers overseas in 1961. Theroux helped a political opponent of Prime Minister Hastings Banda escape to Uganda. For this, Theroux was expelled from Malawi and thrown out of the Peace Corps in 1965. He was declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; by Banda in Malawi for sympathizing with Yatuta Chisiza. As a consequence, his later novel &quot;Jungle Lovers&quot;, which concerns an attempted coup in the country, was banned in Malawi for many years.

He moved to Uganda in 1965 to teach English at Makerere University, where he also wrote for the magazine &quot;Transition&quot;. While at Makerere, Theroux began his friendship with Rajat Neogy, founder of &quot;Transition Magazine&quot;, and novelist V.S. Naipaul, then a visiting scholar at the university. During his time in Uganda, an angry mob at a demonstration threatened to overturn the car in which his pregnant wife was riding, and Theroux decided to leave Africa.

In November 1968, the couple moved with their son Marcel to Singapore, where a second son, Louis, was born. After two years of teaching at the National University of Singapore, Theroux and his family settled in England in November 1971. They lived first in Dorset, and then in south London. When his marriage ended, early in 1990, Theroux returned to the United States, where he has since settled.

Theroux&#x27;s sometimes caustic portrait of Nobel Laureate V. S. Naipaul in his memoir &quot;Sir Vidia&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1998) contrasts sharply with his earlier, admiring portrait of the same author in &quot;V. S. Naipaul: An Introduction to his Work&quot; (1972). They had a long friendship, but Theroux said that events during the 26 years between the two books colored his perspective in the later book. The two authors attempted a reconciliation in 2011 after a chance meeting at the Hay Literary Festival, an episode described in postscript to the subsequent paperback edition of &quot;Sir Vidia’s Shadow&quot;, and remained close friends until the death of Naipaul in 2018.

His novel &quot;Saint Jack&quot; (1973) was banned by the government of Singapore for 30 years, for casting the country in an unfavorable light. All Theroux&#x27;s books were banned by the apartheid government in South Africa, but in 1995 after South Africa&#x27;s transition to democracy, under the presidency of Nelson Mandela, the South African Department of Education made Theroux&#x27;s &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; required reading as a set book for 12th-grade students sitting their final (&quot;Matric&quot;) exam.

In 2001, prior to his 60th birthday, Theroux returned to Africa to retrace his footsteps and &quot;[take] the pulse of the continent&quot;. Despite undergoing various hardships during the trip, he came away with a positive impression of Africa and African people and optimistic views of its future. However, his experiences soured his attitudes towards foreign tourists and activists. He wrote about this journey in the book &quot;Dark Star Safari&quot;.

Theroux has criticized celebrity activists like Bono, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as &quot;mythomaniacs, people who wish to convince the world of their worth.&quot; He has said that &quot;the impression that Africa is fatally troubled and can be saved only by outside help—not to mention celebrities and charity concerts—is a destructive and misleading conceit&quot;.

In a 2009 interview, he stated that he now has &quot;the disposition of a hobbit&quot; and has become more optimistic than in his youth. He further commented that he &quot;need[s] happiness to write well.&quot;

In an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on October 22, 2016, Theroux recommended that President Obama pardon John Walker Lindh. In the article, he compared his association with rebel ministers and own unwitting involvement, while a Peace Corps volunteer, in a plot to assassinate President Hastings Banda of Malawi (noted above) to the complexities in the case of the convicted American citizen who fought with the Taliban in Afghanistan.

==Literary work==

Theroux published his first novel, &quot;Waldo&quot; (1967), during his time in Uganda; it was moderately successful. He published several more novels over the next few years, including &quot;Fong and the Indians&quot;, &quot;Jungle Lovers&quot;, and &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot;. On his return to Malawi many years later, he found that &quot;Jungle Lovers&quot;, which was set in that country, was still banned. He recounted that in his book &quot;Dark Star Safari&quot; (2002).

After moving to London in 1972, Theroux set off on an epic journey by train from Great Britain to Japan and back. His account of this journey was published as &quot;The Great Railway Bazaar&quot;, his first major success as a travel writer and now a classic in the genre. The Nigerian reviewer Noo Saro-Wiwa wrote: &quot;Theroux&#x27;s book &quot;The Great Railway Bazaar&quot; (1975) sold 1.5 million copies and is often credited with launching the travel-writing boom of the late twentieth century.&quot;

He has since written a number of travel books, including about traveling by train from Boston to Argentina (&quot;The Old Patagonian Express&quot;), walking around the United Kingdom (&quot;The Kingdom by the Sea&quot;), kayaking in the South Pacific (&quot;The Happy Isles of Oceania&quot;), visiting China (&quot;Riding the Iron Rooster&quot;), and traveling from Cairo to Cape Town across Africa (&quot;Dark Star Safari&quot;). In 2015, he published &quot;Deep South&quot; detailing four road trips through the southern states of the United States. In 2019, he published &quot;On the Plain of Snakes&quot;, his account of his extensive travels in his own car throughout Mexico. He is noted for his rich descriptions of people and places, laced with a heavy streak of irony, or even misanthropy. Nonfiction by Theroux includes &quot;Sir Vidia&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, an account of his personal and professional friendship with Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul, which ended abruptly after 30 years.

Theroux has worked extensively with the celebrated photographer Steve McCurry. Their book &quot;The Imperial Way&quot; appeared in 1987, and McCurry&#x27;s photographs are included in Theroux&#x27;s &quot;Deep South&quot; and &quot;On the Plain of Snakes&quot;. Magazines such as &quot;Smithsonian&quot; and &quot;The National Geographic&quot; have paired Theroux and McCurry on assignments.

A number of Theroux&#x27;s books have been made into movies. His 1972 novel &quot;Saint Jack&quot; was filmed by Peter Bogdanovich in 1979, and starred Ben Gazzara. His novella &quot;Doctor Slaughter&quot; was filmed as &quot;Half Moon Street&quot;, in 1986, with Michael Caine and Sigourney Weaver. Peter Weir&#x27;s film &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; (1986) had Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren and River Phoenix in the cast. Theroux&#x27;s set of short stories &quot;The London Embassy&quot; became a six-part TV series on British television in 1987. &quot;Christmas Snow&quot;, a 1986 TV movie starring Sid Caesar, was adapted from Theroux&#x27;s novel &quot;London Snow&quot;. Theroux wrote the Hong Kong story on which the Wayne Wang film &quot;Chinese Box&quot; (1997) was based. In 2019, Apple Films announced that &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; was in production as a 10-part series that was broadcast in 2021.

==Personal life==
Theroux&#x27;s 2017 semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Mother Land&quot; (and earlier related short story in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, set in Puerto Rico) refer to an older son born in Puerto Rico in 1961 with his college girlfriend and he had travelled for the birth, giving the baby up for adoption; later, Theroux&#x27;s son returned into his life.

When Theroux was in Uganda, his friends found him a teaching position at Makerere University in Kampala. There he met Anne Castle, an English graduate student teaching at an upcountry girls&#x27; secondary school in Kenya, via Voluntary Service Overseas. They married in 1967. After leaving Asia and Dorset, they moved to South London in 1971, because it was cheaper than the United States. They had two sons: Marcel and Louis, both of whom are writers and documentarians. Theroux and Castle divorced in 1993.

Theroux married a second time to Sheila Donnelly, on November 18, 1995. His wife runs a luxury travel/hotel PR agency. They reside in Hawaii and Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Theroux also has a stepson, Brendan Donnelly.

<doc id="172065" wikidata="Q9322" url="?curid=172065" title="Deutsche Bahn">
<text> (, ; abbreviated as DB or DB AG ) is the national railway company of Germany, and a state-owned enterprise under the control of the German government. Headquartered in the Bahntower in Berlin, it is a joint-stock company (AG) and the largest railway company in the world.

DB was founded after the merger between Deutsche Bundesbahn and the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1994 after the unification of Germany and has been operating ever since. is the second-largest transport company in Germany, after the German postal and logistics company / DHL. DB provides both long-distance and regional transport, serving around 132 million long distance passengers and 1.6 billion regional passengers in 2022. In 2022, DB transported 222 million tons of cargo.

==Company profile==

The group is divided into several companies, including &quot;DB Fernverkehr&quot; (long-distance passenger), &quot;DB Regio&quot; (local passenger services) and &quot;DB Cargo&quot; (rail freight). The Group subsidiary &quot;DB InfraGO&quot; also operates large parts of the German railway infrastructure, making it the largest rail network in Europe.

The company generates about half of its total revenue from operating rail transport, with the other half of the business comprising further transport and logistics businesses, as well as various service providers. The company generates further revenue through public transport contracts and support services for infrastructure maintenance and expansion. The Deutsche Bahn Group is divided into various organizational units that perform their tasks with subsidiaries.

==Rail transport==
DB Personenverkehr is the unit that manages passenger travel within Germany. Originally called &quot;&quot; (&quot;English&quot;: Travel and Tourism), this group is responsible for the managing, servicing and running of German passenger services. This group is divided into and .

===DB Fernverkehr===

 is a semi-independent division of that operates long-distance passenger trains in Germany. It was founded in 1999 in the second stage of the privatisation of German Federal Railways under the name of and renamed in 2003.

 operates all Intercity Express and Intercity trains in Germany as well as in some neighboring countries and several EuroCity and EuroCityExpress trains throughout Europe. Unlike its sister companies and , still holds a monopoly in its segment of the market as it operates hundreds of trains per day, while all competitors&#x27; long-distance services combined amount to no more than 10–15 trains per day.

Additionally operated a few long-distance coach services throughout Germany, called &quot;&quot;, which since have been terminated.

===DB Regio===

DB Regio AG is the subsidiary of that operates passenger trains on short and medium distances in Germany. Unlike its long-distance counterpart, , it does not operate trains on its own account. Traffic is ordered and paid for by the (states) or their respective regional train operation supervisors.

Some states have awarded long-term contracts to (usually 10 to 15 years), in others, DB Regio&#x27;s operations are decreasing, in North Rhine-Westphalia, their market share is expected to be lower than 50%. rail services are divided into several regional companies:

* for Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, Bremen
* for Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
* for North Rhine-Westphalia
* for Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia
* for Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, Hesse and parts of Baden-Württemberg
* for the rest of Baden-Württemberg
* for Bavaria
*
* (small, independent networks, like Erzgebirgsbahn, Gäubodenbahn, Kurhessenbahn, Oberweißbacher Bergbahn, Südostbayernbahn, Westfrankenbahn for easier organisation)

The bus services consist of 25 bus companies, which have subsidiary companies themselves.

== Logistics ==
The Transport and Logistics division acted in the market with the business units DB Schenker and DB Cargo, which were combined under the umbrella of DB Schenker, and the Intermodal division, which operates in combined transport. In 2016, rail freight transport was separated from logistics and &quot;DB Schenker Rail&quot; was renamed DB Cargo.

In cooperation with the logistics provider , DB also offers the transport of shipments weighing up to 20 kg on its EC/IC/ICE trains.

== Infrastructure ==
=== DB InfraGO ===
The infrastructure division was divided into the &quot;DB Netz&quot; (rail infrastructure), DB Station&amp;Service (stations and services) and &quot;DB Energie&quot; (Energy) business units. At the end of December 2023, DB Netz merged with DB Station&amp;Service to create DB InfraGO AG. The new company is intended to reduce poor communication between the two previously separate infrastructure firms and to be more &#x27;oriented towards the common good.&#x27; In fact, that is what the GO in InfraGO stands for in German: &#x27;Gemeinwohlorientierte.&#x27; 

=== DB Engineering &amp; Consulting ===
DB Engineering &amp; Consulting, which is responsible for construction supervision, construction planning and maintenance, is also assigned to this department without being part of a business area. Via its subsidiary DB Engineering &amp; Consulting, DB signed a memorandum of understanding with Iranian rail operator Bonyad Eastern Railways (BonRail) in May 2017 and shortly after a consulting contract with Islamic Republic of Iran Railways; both projects were abandoned after the United States imposed new sanctions against Iran and said firms doing business with Iran would be barred from doing business with the United States.

The California High-Speed Rail Authority&#x27;s (CHSRA) board approved on 15 November 2017 an early train operator contract with DB Engineering &amp; Consulting USA. The firm is the U.S. arm of Deutsche Bahn AG. As early train operator, DB Engineering &amp; Consulting will assist CHSRA with planning, designing and implementing the state&#x27;s high-speed rail program.

== Foreign ventures ==
===Arriva===
Deutsche Bahn purchased Arriva in August 2010 off the London Stock Exchange. To satisfy the European Commission, Arriva&#x27;s German operations were rebranded Netinera and sold. As of July 2022, Arriva operated 15,700 buses and 800 railway vehicles in 14 European countries, mainly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 2019, Deutsche Bahn unsuccessfully tried to sell the business. In October 2023, Deutsche Bahn agreed on terms to sell Arriva to I Squared Capital, with the transaction scheduled to be completed in 2024. The sale was completed on 4 June 2024 at a reported price of £1.4bn.

===DB Cargo UK===
DB also has interests abroad, owning the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest rail freight operator, DB Cargo UK, which also operates the British Royal Train and also has interests in Eastern Europe. It is possible to obtain train times for any journey in Europe from &#x27;s website.

===Trans-Eurasia Logistics===
Trans-Eurasia Logistics is a joint venture with Russian Railways (RŽD) that operates container freight trains between Germany and China via Russia.

== History ==
=== Background: the Deutsche Reichsbahn ===

The railway network in Germany dates back to 1835 when the first tracks were laid on a route between Nuremberg and . The Deutsche Reichsbahn operated from 1920 through the Weimar and Nazi eras until 1949, when it was split between East and West Germany into two successor entities, Deutsche Reichsbahn and Deutsche Bundesbahn, respectively. They remained separate throughout the Cold War era division of Germany, and joined after the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall, and German reunification in 1990. On 1 January 1994 and were merged to form one company, , the successor organisation to the Reichsbahn. At the same time, adopted its current logo and &quot;DB&quot; abbreviation. Kurt Weidemann modernised the logo and typographer designed a new corporate font known as &quot;DB Type&quot;. When Deutsche Bahn was formed in January 1994, it became a joint stock-company, and was designed to operate the railways of both the former East and West Germany after unification in October 1990 as a single, uniform, and private company. There are three main periods of development in this unified German railway: its formation, its early years (1994–1999), and the period from 1999 to the present.

Originally, DBAG had its headquarters in but moved to in central Berlin in 1996, where it occupies a 26-storey office tower designed by at the eastern end of the Sony Centre and named . As the lease was to expire in 2010, DB had announced plans to relocate to , and in 2007 a proposal for a new headquarters by 3XN Architects won an architectural competition which also included Foster + Partners, and . However, these plans were put on hold due to the financial crisis of 2008, and the lease was extended. Construction of the new headquarters building was started in 2017 under the title &quot;Cube Berlin&quot; according to the designs by 3XN. Finished in February 2020, the Cube will house the legal offices of Deutsche Bahn, but not become the main headquarters.

=== 1999 to present ===
The second step of the (railway reform) was carried out in 1999. All rolling stock, track, personnel, and real assets were divided between the subsidiaries of DBAG: (long-distance passenger service, later renamed (operating the stations)). This new organisational scheme was introduced not least to implement European Community directive 91/440/EEC that requires open access operations on railway lines by companies other than those that own the rail infrastructure.

In December 2007, DB reorganised again, bringing all passenger services into its arm, logistics under and infrastructure and operations under .

The DB is owned by the Federal Republic. By the Constitution, the Federal Republic is required to retain (directly or indirectly) a majority of the infrastructure (the present ) stocks.

In 2008, it was agreed to &quot;float&quot; a portion of the business, meaning an end to the 100% share the German Federal Republic had in it, with a plan that 25% of the overall share would be sold to the private sector. However the onset of the financial crisis of 2007–08 saw this cancelled.

In 2014, the Jewish community of Thessaloniki demanded that the , which is the successor of the , should reimburse the heirs of Greek Holocaust victims of Thessaloniki for train fares that they were forced to pay for their deportation from Thessaloniki to and Treblinka between March and August 1943.

In June 2018 controversy grew in the United Kingdom over widespread cancellations of railway services and numerous delayed services operated by Deutsche Bahn in Britain, under its Northern brand. This resulted in Britain&#x27;s Minister of Transport, Chris Grayling, setting up an enquiry into whether the Deutsche Bahn subsidiary had breached its contractual agreement to provide railway services in the north of England. 

The rail carrier reported a €1 billion half year net loss stemming from investments to repair its rail network, strikes and bad weather in July of 2024. As a result, Deutsche Bahn announced that they would shed 30,000 administrative jobs, roughly equal to 9% of their workforce.

In September 2024, the company came to an agreement with DSV of Denmark, a logistics company; in the agreement, DSV will acquire Schenker from Deutsche Bahn for $15.84 billion.

== Train categories ==
Trains in Germany are classified by their stopping pattern, average speed and level of comfort provided:

===Long-distance trains===
*ICE (&quot;Intercity-Express&quot;) for high-speed long-distance train services between major cities and regions. Certain routes also cross European borders into the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland and Austria.
*EC (EuroCity) for intercity trains that cross borders, and connect Germany with other countries. Can also be operated by foreign state railways.
*IC (&quot;InterCity&quot;) for long-distance semi-high-speed services that connect regions and cities. IC services are slightly lower in class than ICE services, with trains reaching lower speeds (average around 160 – 220 km/h) and with more frequent stops. On some IC routes the trains use legacy railway lines instead of the high-speed lines the ICE takes. International IC services are usually operated as &quot;EuroCity&quot;.

Just as ICE, EC and (few) IC cross European borders, train categories of other operators cross into Germany and are operated in cooperation with Deutsche Bahn:
*ECE for international high-speed rail services in cooperation with SBB. Currently two routes (Frankfurt-Milan and Munich-Zurich).
*TGV in cooperation with SNCF from France to Frankfurt and Munich via Stuttgart.
*Railjet from Austria to Munich and Frankfurt in cooperation with ÖBB and from Prague to Berlin in cooperation with ČD.

===Regional trains===
* IRE () are longer distance RE trains that connect regions and cities. On most routes they serve as slower IC trains. IRE trains only exist in Baden-Württemberg and formerly on the Hamburg–Berlin route.
* RE () serve regions and connects cities, and do not stop at every station on the route.
* RB () stop at all stations on the route (except where S-Bahn is available) and are often the most basic train service available.
* S () is a type of rapid transit for larger cities and stop at all stations. operate high-frequency services and are usually characterised by crossing through the city centre with dense station spacing.

There are several other operators in Germany which sometimes offer other categories, also, a local transport authority or tariff associations might brand the trains in a different way than DB does. For example, in the Nuremberg region, RE and RB trains are not differentiated, but called R instead. In some regions, such as , private operators do use the RE and RB labels, in others, such as Saxony, they do not. In online and print information systems of DB, private trains officially labelled RB and RE by their operators, might get a different label, for example &quot;ABR&quot; for trains operated by Abellio, though on platforms, trains and maps or timetables issued by the local transport authority overseeing regional train services, these abbreviations usually do not appear.

===Former categories===
* D ( or , abbreviated from ) was the express train category and used to be the highest train category. It was replaced by IC and the even faster ICE. The trains of the car shuttle service connecting the island of Sylt with the mainland are still officially referred to as D trains
* E () was the semi-fast service offering faster journeys than normal passenger trains but not at such long distances and speed as D trains, though there were some quite long running E trains. No direct successor, would be located between RE and IC.
* IR (), set between RE and IC was meant to connect cities and regions at a lower price, but also be used for local traffic. Replaced partly by IC, RE and IRE.
* MET (&quot;Metropolitan&quot;) was a luxury train service between Hamburg and Cologne. The two special MET train sets are now used for IC and ICE services, and does still have a comfort level above the regular IC and ICE coaches.
* N (), the most basic form of train service stopping at all stations. When all local train services were , i.e. operating at a fixed interval (mostly one train per hour), they were rebranded as RB.
* SE () operated as a mixture of RE and RB: trains skipped many stations in urban areas but made all stops in the countryside. Rebranded as RE and RB. In some regions, such as Rhine-Main (Frankfurt, ), the local transit authority advertised trains as SE. Internally, DB classified them as either RE or RB, but even DB trains display &quot;SE&quot; on their destination boards. This ceased in December 2016.

== Tickets ==

DB offers two different pricing models for single or return tickets for routes that include long-distance trains:
* The &quot;Flexpreis&quot; (originally &quot;Normalpreis&quot;): gives full flexibility, i.e., all trains on the given date can be used on the chosen route. This price is independent of the time of purchase for a given route and tickets are reimbursable prior to the day of departure. 
* The &quot;Sparpreis&quot; and &quot;Super-Sparpreis&quot; are generally cheaper tickets that must be purchased in advance and are only valid for a specific connection.

Ticket prices generally rise degressively over distance, particularly for Sparpreise and Supersparpreise. Seat reservations are included only for first class tickets and seating capacity is not always assured, even for tickets valid on one particular connection only.
Local trains (S, RB, RE, IRE) also accept tickets issued by local transport associations, which can also be used on buses, trams, and U-Bahn trains.

DB offers concessionary fares with the &quot;BahnCard&quot; discount cards, which are available as &quot;BahnCard 25&quot; (25% discount on Flexpreis and Sparpreis), &quot;BahnCard 50&quot; (50% discount on Flexpreis and 25% discount on Sparpreis), and &quot;BahnCard 100&quot; (unlimited travel on all Deutsche Bahn trains, a few private train companies and also in many local transport associations).

Other special tickets, such as the &quot;Länder-Tickets&quot; (&quot;state tickets&quot;), which give unlimited journeys on local trains and in many transport associations within a state, and Interrail are also available. These Länder-Tickets offer group tickets, where up to five people can travel on a single ticket.

== Sponsorship ==
Deutsche Bahn has sponsored the German football club Hertha BSC between 2006 and 2015.

== Incidents ==
* 2025 Hamburg train accident
* Bad Aibling rail accident
* Brühl train derailment
* Eschede train disaster
* Garmisch-Partenkirchen train derailment
* Hordorf train collision
* 2012 Stuttgart derailments

<doc id="172067" wikidata="Q154545" url="?curid=172067" title="Léopold Sédar Senghor">
<text>Léopold Sédar Senghor ( , ; 9 October 1906 – 20 December 2001) was a Senegalese politician, cultural theorist and poet who served as the first president of Senegal from 1960 to 1980.

Ideologically an African socialist, Senghor was one of the major theoreticians of Négritude. He was a proponent of African culture, black identity, and African empowerment within the framework of French-African ties. He advocated for the extension of full civil and political rights for France&#x27;s African territories while arguing that French Africans would be better off within a federal French structure than as independent nation-states.

Senghor became the first president of independent Senegal. He fell out with his long-standing associate Mamadou Dia, who was the prime minister of Senegal, arresting him on suspicion of fomenting a coup and imprisoning him for 12 years. Senghor established an authoritarian one-party state in Senegal, where all rival political parties were prohibited.

Senghor was the founder of the Senegalese Democratic Bloc party in 1948. He was the first African elected as a member of the &quot;Académie française&quot; and won the 1985 International Nonino Prize in Italy. Senghor is regarded by many as one of the most important African intellectuals of the 20th century.

==Early years: 1906–28==
Léopold Sédar Senghor was born on 9 October 1906 in the city of Joal, some 110 kilometres south of Dakar, the capital of Senegal. His father, Basile Diogoye Senghor (pronounced: Basile Jogoy Senghor), was a wealthy peanut merchant belonging to the bourgeois Serer people. Basile Senghor was said to be a man of great means and owned thousands of cattle and vast lands, some of which were given to him by his cousin the king of Sine. Gnilane Ndiémé Bakhoum (1861–1948), Senghor&#x27;s mother, the third wife of his father, a Muslim with Fula origin who belonged to the Tabor tribe, was born near Djilor to a Christian family. She gave birth to six children, including two sons. Senghor&#x27;s birth certificate states that he was born on 9 October 1906; however, there is a discrepancy with his certificate of baptism, which states it occurred on 9 August 1906. His Serer middle name &quot;Sédar&quot; comes from the Serer language, meaning &quot;one that shall not be humiliated&quot; or &quot;the one you cannot humiliate&quot;. His surname &quot;Senghor&quot; is a combination of the Serer words &quot;Sène&quot; (a Serer surname and the name of the Supreme Deity in Serer religion called &quot;Rog Sene&quot;) and &quot;gor&quot; or &quot;ghor&quot;, the etymology of which is &quot;kor&quot; in the Serer language, meaning male or man. Tukura Badiar Senghor, the prince of Sine and a figure from whom Léopold Sédar Senghor has been reported to trace descent, was a Serer noble.

At the age of eight, Senghor began his studies in Senegal in the Ngasobil boarding school of the Fathers of the Holy Spirit. In 1922, he entered a seminary in Dakar. After being told that religious life was not for him, he attended a secular institution. By then, he was already passionate about French literature. He won distinctions in French, Latin, Greek and Algebra. With his Baccalaureate completed, he was awarded a scholarship to continue his studies in France.

==&quot;Sixteen years of wandering&quot;: 1928–1944==
In 1928, Senghor sailed from Senegal for France, beginning, in his words, &quot;sixteen years of wandering&quot;. Starting his post-secondary studies at the Sorbonne, he quit and went on to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand to finish his preparatory course for entrance to the &quot;École Normale Supérieure&quot;, a &quot;grande école&quot;. Henri Queffélec, Robert Verdier and Georges Pompidou were also studying at this elite institution. After failing the entrance exam, Senghor prepared for his grammar &quot;Agrégation&quot;. He was granted his &quot;agrégation&quot; in 1935 at his second attempt.

===Academic career===
Senghor graduated from the University of Paris, where he received the Agrégation in French Grammar. Subsequently, he was designated professor at the universities of Tours and Paris, where he taught during the period 1935–45.

Senghor started his teaching years at the lycée René-Descartes in Tours; he also taught at the lycée Marcelin-Berthelot in Saint-Maur-des-Fosses near Paris. He also studied linguistics taught by Lilias Homburger at the &quot;École pratique des hautes études&quot;. He studied with prominent social scientists such as Marcel Cohen, Marcel Mauss and Paul Rivet (director of the Institut d&#x27;ethnologie de Paris). Senghor, along with other intellectuals of the African diaspora who had come to study in the colonial capital, coined the term and conceived the notion of &quot;négritude&quot;, which was a response to the racism still prevalent in France. It turned the racial slur &quot;nègre&quot; into a positively connoted celebration of African culture and character. The idea of &quot;négritude&quot; informed not only Senghor&#x27;s cultural criticism and literary work, but also became a guiding principle for his political thought in his career as a statesman.

===Military service===
In 1939, Senghor was enlisted in the 3rd Colonial Infantry Regiment of the French army with the rank of private (&quot;2e Classe&quot;) despite his higher education. A year later in June 1940, the invading Germans took him prisoner in la Charité-sur-Loire or Villabon. He was interned in a succession of camps, and finally at Front Stalag 230, in Poitiers. Front Stalag 230 was reserved for colonial troops captured during the war. According to Senghor, German soldiers wanted to execute him and the others on the day they were captured, but they escaped this fate by yelling &quot;Vive la France, vive l&#x27;Afrique noire!&quot; (&quot;Long live France, long live Black Africa!&quot;). A French officer told the soldiers that executing the African prisoners would dishonour the Aryan race and the German Army. In total, Senghor spent two years in different prison camps, where he spent most of his time writing poems and learning enough German to read Goethe&#x27;s poetry in the original. In 1942, he was released for medical reasons.

He resumed his teaching career while remaining involved in the resistance during the Nazi occupation.

==Political career: 1945–1982==
===Colonial France===
Senghor advocated for African integration within the French Empire, arguing that independence for small, weak territories would lead to the perpetuation of oppression, whereas African empowerment within a federal French Empire could transform it for the better.

Once the war was over, Senghor was selected as Dean of the Linguistics Department with the &quot;École nationale de la France d&#x27;Outre-Mer&quot;, a position he would hold until Senegal&#x27;s independence in 1960. While travelling on a research trip for his poetry, he met the local socialist leader, Lamine Guèye, who suggested that Senghor run for election as a member of the Assemblée nationale française. Senghor accepted and became &quot;député&quot; for the riding of Sénégal-Mauritanie, when colonies were granted the right to be represented by elected individuals. They took different positions when the train conductors on the Dakar-Niger line went on strike. Guèye voted against the strike, arguing the movement would paralyse the colony, while Senghor supported the workers, which gained him great support among Senegalese.

During the negotiations to write the French Constitution of 1946, Senghor pushed for the extension of French citizenship to all French territories. Four Senegalese communes had citizenship since 1916 – Senghor argued that this should be extended to the rest of France&#x27;s territory. Senghor argued for a federal model whereby each African territory would govern its own internal affairs, and this federation would be part of a larger French confederation that run foreign affairs, defence and development policies. Senghor opposed indigenous nationalism, arguing that African territories would develop more successfully within a federal model where each territory had its &quot;negro-African personality&quot; along with French experience and resources.

===Political changes===
In 1947, Senghor left the African Division of the French Section of the Workers International (SFIO), which had given enormous financial support to the social movement. With Mamadou Dia, he founded the &quot;Bloc démocratique sénégalais&quot; (1948). They won the legislative elections of 1951, and Guèye lost his seat. Senghor was involved in the negotiations and drafting of the Fourth Republic&#x27;s constitution.

Re-elected deputy in 1951 as an independent overseas member, Senghor was appointed state secretary to the council&#x27;s president in Edgar Faure&#x27;s government from 1 March 1955 to 1 February 1956. He became mayor of the city of Thiès, Senegal in November 1956 and then advisory minister in the Michel Debré&#x27;s government from 23 July 1959 to 19 May 1961. He was also a member of the commission responsible for drafting the Fifth Republic&#x27;s constitution, general councillor for Senegal, member of the &quot;Grand Conseil de l&#x27;Afrique Occidentale Francaise&quot; and member of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe.

In 1964, Senghor published the first volume of a series of five, titled &quot;Liberté&quot;. The book contains a variety of speeches, essays and prefaces.

===Senegal===
Senghor supported federalism for newly independent African states, a type of &quot;French Commonwealth&quot;, while retaining a degree of French involvement:
Since federalism was not favoured by the African countries, he decided to form, along with Modibo Keita, the Mali Federation with former French Sudan (present-day Mali). Senghor was president of the Federal Assembly until it failed in 1960.
Afterwards, Senghor became the first President of the Republic of Senegal, elected on 5 September 1960. He is the author of the Senegalese national anthem. The prime minister, Mamadou Dia, was in charge of executing Senegal&#x27;s long-term development plan, while Senghor was in charge of foreign relations. The two men quickly disagreed. In December 1962, Mamadou Dia was arrested under suspicion of fomenting a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. He was held in prison for 12 years. Following this, Senghor established an authoritarian presidential regime where all rival political parties were suppressed. Senghor tightly circumscribed press freedom in Senegal and founded the state-run newspaper &quot;Le Soleil&quot; in 1970.

On 22 March 1967, Senghor survived an assassination attempt. The suspect, Moustapha Lô, pointed his pistol towards the President after he had participated in the sermon of Tabaski, but the gun did not fire. Lô was sentenced to death for treason and executed on 15 June 1967, even though it remained unclear if he had actually wanted to kill Senghor.

Following an announcement at the beginning of December 1980, Senghor resigned his position at the end of the year, before the end of his fifth term. Abdou Diouf replaced him as the head of the country. Under Senghor&#x27;s presidency, Senegal adopted a multi-party system (limited to three: socialist, communist and liberal). He created a performing education system. Despite the end of official colonialism, the value of Senegalese currency continued to be fixed by France, the language of learning remained French, and Senghor ruled the country with French political advisors.

===Francophonie===
He supported the creation of la Francophonie and was elected vice-president of the High Council of the Francophonie. In 1982, he was one of the founders of the Association France and developing countries whose objectives were to bring attention to the problems of developing countries, in the wake of the changes affecting the latter.

==Global policy==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

==&quot;Académie française&quot;: 1983–2001==
Senghor was elected a member of the &quot;Académie française&quot; on 2 June 1983, at the 16th seat where he succeeded Antoine de Lévis Mirepoix. He was the first African to sit at the Académie. The entrance ceremony in his honour took place on 29 March 1984, in presence of French President François Mitterrand. This was considered a further step towards greater openness in the Académie, after the previous election of a woman, Marguerite Yourcenar. In 1993, the last and fifth book of the &quot;Liberté&quot; series was published: &quot;Liberté 5: le dialogue des cultures.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Senghor&#x27;s first marriage was to Ginette Éboué (1 March 1923 – 1992), daughter of Félix Éboué. They married on 9 September 1946 and divorced in 1955. They had two sons, Francis in 1947 and Guy in 1948. His second wife, Colette Hubert [fr] (20 November 1925 – 18 November 2019), who was from France, became Senegal&#x27;s first First Lady upon independence in 1960. Senghor had three sons between his two marriages. 
Senghor spent the last years of his life with his wife in Verson, near the city of Caen in Normandy, where he died on 20 December 2001. His funeral was held on 29 December 2001 in Dakar. Officials attending the ceremony included Raymond Forni, president of the Assemblée nationale and Charles Josselin, state secretary for the minister of foreign affairs, in charge of the Francophonie. Jacques Chirac (who said, upon hearing of Senghor&#x27;s death: &quot;Poetry has lost one of its masters, Senegal a statesman, Africa a visionary and France a friend&quot;) and Lionel Jospin, respectively president of the French Republic and the prime minister, did not attend. Their failure to attend Senghor&#x27;s funeral made waves as it was deemed a lack of acknowledgement for what the politician had been in his life. The analogy was made with the Senegalese Tirailleurs who, after having contributed to the liberation of France, had to wait more than forty years to receive an equal pension (in terms of buying power) to their French counterparts. The scholar Érik Orsenna wrote in the newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; an editorial entitled &quot;J&#x27;ai honte&quot; (I am ashamed).

==Legacy==
Although a socialist, Senghor avoided the Marxist and anti-Western ideology that had become popular in post-colonial Africa, favouring the maintenance of close ties with France and the Western world. Senghor&#x27;s tenure as president was characterised by the development of African socialism, which was created as an indigenous alternative to Marxism, drawing heavily from the &quot;négritude&quot; philosophy. In developing this, he was assisted by Ousmane Tanor Dieng. On 31 December 1980, he retired in favour of his prime minister, Abdou Diouf. Politically, Senghor&#x27;s stamp can also be identified today. With regards to Senegal in particular, his willful abdication of power to his successor, Abdou Diouf, led to Diouf&#x27;s peaceful leave from office as well. Senegal&#x27;s special relationship with France and economic legacy are more highly contested, but Senghor&#x27;s impact on democracy remains nonetheless. Senghor managed to retain his identity as both a poet and a politician even throughout his busy careers as both, living by his philosophy of achieving equilibrium between competing forces. Whether it was France and Africa, poetics and politics, or other disparate parts of his identity, Senghor balanced the two.

Literarily, Senghor&#x27;s influence on political thought and poetic form are wide-reaching even through to our modern day. Senghor&#x27;s poetry endures as the &quot;record of an individual sensibility at a particular moment in history,&quot; capturing the spirit of the Négritude movement at its peak, but also marks a definitive place in literary history. Senghor&#x27;s thoughts were exceedingly radical for this time, arguing that Africans could only progress if they developed a culture distinct and separate from the colonial powers that oppressed them, pushing against popular thought at the time. Senghor was deeply influenced by poets from the US such as Langston Hughes. Seat number 16 of the Académie was vacant after the Senegalese poet&#x27;s death. He was ultimately replaced by another former president, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing.

==Honours and awards==

Senghor received several honours in the course of his life. He was made Grand-Croix of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, Grand-Croix of the l&#x27;Ordre national du Mérite, commander of arts and letters. He also received academic palms and the Grand Cross of the National Order of the Lion. His war exploits earned him the Reconnaissance Franco-alliée Medal of 1939–1945 and the Combattant Cross of 1939–1945. He received honorary doctorates from thirty-seven universities.

Senghor received the Commemorative Medal of the 2500th Anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire on 14 October 1971.

On 13 November 1978, he was created a Knight of the Collar of the Order of Isabella the Catholic of Spain. Members of the order at the rank of Knight and above enjoy personal nobility and have the privilege of adding a golden heraldic mantle to their coats of arms. Those at the rank of the Collar also receive the official style &quot;His or Her Most Excellent Lord&quot;.

That same year, Senghor received an honoris causa from the University of Salamanca.

In 1983, he was awarded the Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize by the University of Tübingen.

The Senghor French Language International University, named after him was officially opened in Alexandria in 1990.

In 1994, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the African Studies Association; however, there was controversy about whether he met the standard of contributing &quot;a lifetime record of outstanding scholarship in African studies and service to the Africanist community.&quot; Michael Mbabuike, president of the New York African Studies Association (NYASA), said that the award also honours those who have worked &quot;to make the world a better place for mankind.&quot;

The airport of Dakar was renamed &quot;Aéroport International Léopold Sédar Senghor&quot; in 1996, on his 90th birthday.

The Passerelle Solférino in Paris was renamed after him in 2006, on the centenary of his birth.

==Poetry==

His poetry was widely acclaimed, and in 1978 he was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca.
His poem &quot;A l&#x27;appel de la race de Saba&quot;, published in 1936, was inspired by the entry of Italian troops in Addis Ababa.
In 1948, Senghor compiled and edited a volume of Francophone poetry called &quot;Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache&quot; for which Jean-Paul Sartre wrote an introduction, entitled &quot;Orphée Noir&quot; (Black Orpheus).

For his epitaph was a poem he had written, namely:

:&quot;Quand je serai mort, mes amis, couchez-moi sous Joal-l&#x27;Ombreuse.&quot;
:&quot;Sur la colline au bord du Mamanguedy, près l&#x27;oreille du sanctuaire des Serpents.&quot;
:&quot;Mais entre le Lion couchez-moi et l&#x27;aïeule Tening-Ndyae.&quot;
:&quot;Quand je serai mort mes amis, couchez-moi sous Joal-la-Portugaise.&quot;
:&quot;Des pierres du Fort vous ferez ma tombe, et les canons garderont le silence.&quot;
:&quot;Deux lauriers roses-blanc et rose-embaumeront la Signare.&quot;

:&quot;When I&#x27;m dead, my friends, place me below Shadowy Joal,&quot;
:&quot;On the hill, by the bank of the Mamanguedy, near the ear of Serpents&#x27; Sanctuary.&quot;
:&quot;But place me between the Lion and ancestral Tening-Ndyae.&quot;
:&quot;When I&#x27;m dead, my friends, place me beneath Portuguese Joal.&quot;
:&quot;Of stones from the Fort build my tomb, and cannons will keep quiet.&quot;
:&quot;Two oleanders – white and pink – will perfume the Signare.&quot;

==Négritude==


With Aimé Césaire and Léon Damas, Senghor created the concept of &quot;Négritude&quot;, an important intellectual movement that sought to assert and valorise what they believed to be distinctive African characteristics, values, and aesthetics. One of these African characteristics that Senghor theorised was asserted when he wrote &quot;the Negro has reactions that are more &quot;lived,&quot; in the sense that they are more direct and concrete expressions of the sensation and of the stimulus, and so of the object itself with all its original qualities and power.&quot; This was a reaction against the too-strong dominance of French culture in the colonies, and against the perception that Africa did not have a culture developed enough to stand alongside that of Europe. In that respect &quot;négritude&quot; owes significantly to the pioneering work of Leo Frobenius.

Building upon historical research identifying ancient Egypt with black Africa, Senghor argued that sub-Saharan Africa and Europe are in fact part of the same cultural continuum, reaching from Egypt to classical Greece, through Rome to the European colonial powers of the modern age. Négritude was by no means—as it has in many quarters been perceived—an anti-white racism, but rather emphasised the importance of dialogue and exchange among different cultures (e.g., European, African, Arab, etc.).

A related concept later developed in Mobutu&#x27;s Zaire is that of &quot;authenticité&quot; or Authenticity.

===Décalage===
In colloquial French, the term décalage is used to describe jetlag, lag or a general discrepancy between two things. However, Senghor uses the term to describe the unevenness in the African Diaspora. The complete phrase he uses is &quot;Il s&#x27;agit, en réalité, d&#x27;un simple décalage—dans le temps et dans l&#x27;espace&quot;, meaning that between Black Africans and African Americans there exists an inconsistency, both temporally and spatially. The time element points to the advancing or delaying of a schedule or agenda, while the space aspect designates the displacing and shifting of an object. The term points to &quot;a bias that refuses to pass over when one crosses the water&quot;. He asks, how can we expect any sort of solidarity or intimacy from two populations that diverged more than 500 years ago?

<text>In statistics, the logit ( ) function is the quantile function associated with the standard logistic distribution. It has many uses in data analysis and machine learning, especially in data transformations.

Mathematically, the logit is the inverse of the standard logistic function formula_1, so the logit is defined as
: formula_2

Because of this, the logit is also called the log-odds since it is equal to the logarithm of the odds formula_3 where is a probability. Thus, the logit is a type of function that maps probability values from formula_4 to real numbers in formula_5, akin to the probit function.

== Definition ==
If is a probability, then is the corresponding odds; the of the probability is the logarithm of the odds, i.e.:
: formula_6

The base of the logarithm function used is of little importance in the present article, as long as it is greater than 1, but the natural logarithm with base is the one most often used. The choice of base corresponds to the choice of logarithmic unit for the value: base 2 corresponds to a shannon, base  to a nat, and base 10 to a hartley; these units are particularly used in information-theoretic interpretations. For each choice of base, the logit function takes values between negative and positive infinity.

The “logistic” function of any number formula_7 is given by the inverse-:
: formula_8

The difference between the s of two probabilities is the logarithm of the odds ratio (), thus providing a shorthand for writing the correct combination of odds ratios only by adding and subtracting:
: formula_9

The Taylor series for the logit function is given by:
:formula_10

== History ==
Several approaches have been explored to adapt linear regression methods to a domain where the output is a probability value formula_4, instead of any real number formula_5. In many cases, such efforts have focused on modeling this problem by mapping the range formula_4 to formula_5 and then running the linear regression on these transformed values.

In 1934, Chester Ittner Bliss used the cumulative normal distribution function to perform this mapping and called his model probit, an abbreviation for &quot;probability unit&quot;. This is, however, computationally more expensive.

In 1944, Joseph Berkson used log of odds and called this function &quot;logit&quot;, an abbreviation for &quot;logistic unit&quot;, following the analogy for probit:
Log odds was used extensively by Charles Sanders Peirce (late 19th century). G. A. Barnard in 1949 coined the commonly used term &quot;log-odds&quot;; the log-odds of an event is the logit of the probability of the event. Barnard also coined the term &quot;lods&quot; as an abstract form of &quot;log-odds&quot;, but suggested that &quot;in practice the term &#x27;odds&#x27; should normally be used, since this is more familiar in everyday life&quot;.

== Uses and properties ==
* The logit in logistic regression is a special case of a link function in a generalized linear model: it is the canonical link function for the Bernoulli distribution.
* More abstractly, the logit is the natural parameter for the binomial distribution; see .
* The logit function is the negative of the derivative of the binary entropy function.
* The logit is also central to the probabilistic Rasch model for measurement, which has applications in psychological and educational assessment, among other areas.
* The inverse-logit function (i.e., the logistic function) is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;expit&quot; function.
* In plant disease epidemiology, the logistic, Gompertz, and monomolecular models are collectively known as the Richards family models.
* The log-odds function of probabilities is often used in state estimation algorithms because of its numerical advantages in the case of small probabilities. Instead of multiplying very small floating point numbers, log-odds probabilities can just be summed up to calculate the (log-odds) joint probability.

== Comparison with probit ==
Closely related to the function (and logit model) are the probit function and probit model. The and are both sigmoid functions with a domain between 0 and 1, which makes them both quantile functions – i.e., inverses of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a probability distribution. In fact, the is the quantile function of the logistic distribution, while the is the quantile function of the normal distribution. The function is denoted formula_15, where formula_16 is the CDF of the standard normal distribution, as just mentioned:
: formula_17

As shown in the graph on the right, the and functions are extremely similar when the function is scaled, so that its slope at matches the slope of the . As a result, probit models are sometimes used in place of logit models because for certain applications (e.g., in item response theory) the implementation is easier.

<text>In probability theory, odds provide a measure of the probability of a particular outcome. Odds are commonly used in gambling and statistics. For example for an event that is 40% probable, one could say that the odds are or 

When gambling, odds are often given as the ratio of the possible net profit &quot;to&quot; the possible net loss. However in many situations, you pay the possible loss (&quot;stake&quot; or &quot;wager&quot;) up front and, if you win, you are paid the net win plus you also get your stake returned. So wagering 2 at , pays out , which is called When Moneyline odds are quoted as a positive number , it means that a wager pays When Moneyline odds are quoted as a negative number , it means that a wager pays 

Odds have a simple relationship with probability. When probability is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, the relationships between probability and odds are as follows. Note that if probability is to be expressed as a percentage these probability values should be multiplied by 100%.
*&quot; in &quot; means that the probability is .
*&quot; to in favor&quot; means that the probability is .
*&quot; to against&quot; means that the probability is .
*&quot;pays to &quot; means that the bet is a fair bet if the probability is .
*&quot;pays for &quot; means that the bet is a fair bet if the probability is .
*&quot;pays &quot; (moneyline odds) means that the bet is fair if the probability is .
*&quot;pays &quot; (moneyline odds) means that the bet is fair if the probability is .

The numbers for odds can be scaled. If is any positive number then is the same as and similarly if &quot;to&quot; is replaced with &quot;in&quot; or &quot;for&quot;. For example, is the same as both and 

When the value of the probability (between 0 and 1; not a percentage) can be written as a fraction then the odds can be said to be or and these can be scaled to equivalent odds. Similarly, fair betting odds can be expressed as or 

==History==
The language of odds, such as the use of phrases like &quot;ten to one&quot; for intuitively estimated risks, is found in the sixteenth century, well before the development of probability theory. Shakespeare wrote:

The sixteenth-century polymath Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes. Implied by this definition is the fact that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

==Statistical usage==

In statistics, odds are an expression of relative probabilities, generally quoted as the odds &quot;in favor&quot;. The odds (in favor) of an event or a proposition is the ratio of the probability that the event will happen to the probability that the event will not happen. Mathematically, this is a Bernoulli trial, as it has exactly two outcomes. In case of a finite sample space of equally probable outcomes, this is the ratio of the number of outcomes where the event occurs to the number of outcomes where the event does not occur; these can be represented as &quot;W&quot; and &quot;L&quot; (for Wins and Losses) or &quot;S&quot; and &quot;F&quot; (for Success and Failure). For example, the odds that a randomly chosen day of the week is during a weekend are two to five (2:5), as days of the week form a sample space of seven outcomes, and the event occurs for two of the outcomes (Saturday and Sunday), and not for the other five. Conversely, given odds as a ratio of integers, this can be represented by a probability space of a finite number of equally probable outcomes. These definitions are equivalent, since dividing both terms in the ratio by the number of outcomes yields the probabilities: formula_1 Conversely, the odds against is the opposite ratio. For example, the odds against a random day of the week being during a weekend are 5:2.

Odds and probability can be expressed in prose via the prepositions &quot;to&quot; and &quot;in:&quot; &quot;odds of so many &quot;to&quot; so many on (or against) [some event]&quot; refers to &quot;odds&quot;—the ratio of numbers of (equally probable) outcomes in favor and against (or vice versa); &quot;chances of so many [outcomes], &quot;in&quot; so many [outcomes]&quot; refers to &quot;probability&quot;—the number of (equally probable) outcomes in favour relative to the number for and against combined. For example, &quot;odds of a weekend are 2 &quot;to&quot; 5&quot;, while &quot;chances of a weekend are 2 &quot;in&quot; 7&quot;. In casual use, the words &quot;odds&quot; and &quot;chances&quot; (or &quot;chance&quot;) are often used interchangeably to vaguely indicate some measure of odds or probability, though the intended meaning can be deduced by noting whether the preposition between the two numbers is &quot;to&quot; or &quot;in&quot;.

===Mathematical relations===
Odds can be expressed as a ratio of two numbers, in which case it is not unique—scaling both terms by the same factor does not change the proportions: 1:1 odds and 100:100 odds are the same (even odds). Odds can also be expressed as a number, by dividing the terms in the ratio—in this case it is unique (different fractions can represent the same rational number). Odds as a ratio, odds as a number, and probability (also a number) are related by simple formulas, and similarly odds in favor and odds against, and probability of success and probability of failure have simple relations. Odds range from 0 to infinity, while probabilities range from 0 to 1, and hence are often represented as a percentage between 0% and 100%: reversing the ratio switches odds for with odds against, and similarly probability of success with probability of failure.

Given odds (in favor) as the ratio W:L (number of outcomes that are wins:number of outcomes that are losses), the odds in favor (as a number) formula_2 and odds against (as a number) formula_3 can be computed by simply dividing, and are multiplicative inverses:
:formula_4

Analogously, given odds as a ratio, the probability of success or failure can be computed by dividing, and the probability of success and probability of failure sum to unity (one), as they are the only possible outcomes. In case of a finite number of equally probable outcomes, this can be interpreted as the number of outcomes where the event occurs divided by the total number of events:
:formula_5

Given a probability &quot;p,&quot; the odds as a ratio is formula_6 (probability of success to probability of failure), and the odds as numbers can be computed by dividing:
:formula_7

Conversely, given the odds as a number formula_8 this can be represented as the ratio formula_9 or conversely formula_10 from which the probability of success or failure can be computed:
:formula_11
Thus if expressed as a fraction with a numerator of 1, probability and odds differ by exactly 1 in the denominator: a probability of 1 &quot;in&quot; 100 (1/100 = 1%) is the same as odds of 1 &quot;to&quot; 99 (1/99 = 0.0101... = 0.), while odds of 1 &quot;to&quot; 100 (1/100 = 0.01) is the same as a probability of 1 &quot;in&quot; 101 (1/101 = 0.00990099... = 0.). This is a minor difference if the probability is small (close to zero, or &quot;long odds&quot;), but is a major difference if the probability is large (close to one).

These are worked out for some simple odds:
These transforms have certain special geometric properties: the conversions between odds for and odds against (resp. probability of success with probability of failure) and between odds and probability are all Möbius transformations (fractional linear transformations). They are thus specified by three points (sharply 3-transitive). Swapping odds for and odds against swaps 0 and infinity, fixing 1, while swapping probability of success with probability of failure swaps 0 and 1, fixing .5; these are both order 2, hence circular transforms. Converting odds to probability fixes 0, sends infinity to 1, and sends 1 to .5 (even odds are 50% probable), and conversely; this is a parabolic transform.

===Applications===
In probability theory and statistics, odds and similar ratios may be more natural or more convenient than probabilities. In some cases the log-odds are used, which is the logit of the probability. Most simply, odds are frequently multiplied or divided, and log converts multiplication to addition and division to subtractions. This is particularly important in the logistic model, in which the log-odds of the target variable are a linear combination of the observed variables.

Similar ratios are used elsewhere in statistics; of central importance is the likelihood ratio in likelihoodist statistics, which is used in Bayesian statistics as the Bayes factor.

Odds are particularly useful in problems of sequential decision making, as for instance in problems of how to stop (online) on a last specific event which is solved by the odds algorithm.

The odds are a ratio of probabilities; an odds ratio is a ratio of odds, that is, a ratio of ratios of probabilities. Odds-ratios are often used in analysis of clinical trials. While they have useful mathematical properties, they can produce counter-intuitive results: an event with an 80% probability of occurring is four times &quot;more probable&quot; to happen than an event with a 20% probability, but the &quot;odds&quot; are 16 times higher on the less probable event (4–1 &quot;against&quot;, or 4) than on the more probable one (1–4, or 4–1 &quot;on&quot;, or 0.25).

;Example #1: There are 5 pink marbles, 2 blue marbles, and 8 purple marbles. What are the odds in favor of picking a blue marble?

Answer: The odds in favour of a blue marble are 2:13. One can equivalently say that the odds are 13:2 &quot;against&quot;. There are 2 out of 15 chances in favour of blue, 13 out of 15 against blue.

In probability theory and statistics, where the variable &quot;p&quot; is the probability in favor of a binary event, and the probability against the event is therefore 1-&quot;p&quot;, &quot;the odds&quot; of the event are the quotient of the two, or formula_12. That value may be regarded as the relative probability the event will happen, expressed as a fraction (if it is less than 1), or a multiple (if it is equal to or greater than one) of the likelihood that the event will not happen.

;Example #2:
In the first example at top, saying the odds of a Sunday are &quot;one to six&quot; or, less commonly, &quot;one-sixth&quot; means the probability of picking a Sunday randomly is one-sixth the probability of not picking a Sunday. While the mathematical probability of an event has a value in the range from zero to one, &quot;the odds&quot; in favor of that same event lie between zero and infinity. The odds against the event with probability given as &quot;p&quot; are formula_13. The odds against Sunday are 6:1 or 6/1 = 6. It is 6 times as probable that a random day is not a Sunday.

==Gambling usage==

On a coin toss or a match race between two evenly matched horses, it is reasonable for two people to wager level stakes. However, in more variable situations, such as a multi-runner horse race or a football match between two unequally matched teams, betting &quot;at odds&quot; provides the possibility to take the respective likelihoods of the possible outcomes into account. The use of odds in gambling facilitates betting on events where the probabilities of different outcomes vary. 

In the modern era, most fixed-odd betting takes place between a betting organisation, such as a bookmaker, and an individual, rather than between individuals. Different traditions have grown up in how to express odds to customers.

===Fractional odds===
Favoured by bookmakers in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and also common in horse racing, fractional odds quote the net total that will be paid out to the bettor, should they win, relative to the stake. Odds of 4/1 would imply that the bettor stands to make a £400 profit on a £100 stake. If the odds are 1/4, the bettor will make £25 on a £100 stake. In either case, having won, the bettor always receives the original stake back; so if the odds are 4/1 the bettor receives a total of £500 (£400 plus the original £100). Odds of 1/1 are known as &quot;evens&quot; or &quot;even money&quot;.

The numerator and denominator of fractional odds are often integers, thus if the bookmaker&#x27;s payout was to be £1.25 for every £1 stake, this would be equivalent to £5 for every £4 staked, and the odds would therefore be expressed as 5/4. However, not all fractional odds are traditionally read using the lowest common denominator. For example, given that there is a pattern of odds of 5/4, 7/4, 9/4 and so on, odds which are mathematically 3/2 are more easily compared if expressed in the equivalent form 6/4.

Fractional odds are also known as &quot;British odds,&quot; &quot;UK odds,&quot; or, in that country, &quot;traditional odds&quot;. They are typically represented with a &quot;/&quot; but can also be represented with a &quot;-&quot;, e.g. 4/1 or 4–1. Odds with a denominator of 1 are often presented in listings as the numerator only.

A variation of fractional odds is known as &quot;Hong Kong&quot; odds. Fractional and Hong Kong odds are actually exchangeable. The only difference is that the UK odds are presented as a fractional notation (e.g. 6/5) whilst the Hong Kong odds are decimal (e.g. 1.2). Both exhibit the net return.

===Decimal odds===

The European odds also represent the potential winnings (net returns), but in addition they factor in the stake (e.g. 6/5 or 1.2 plus 1 = 2.2).

Favoured in continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Singapore, decimal odds quote the ratio of the payout amount, &quot;including&quot; the original stake, to the stake itself. Therefore, the decimal odds of an outcome are equivalent to the decimal value of the fractional odds plus one. Thus even odds 1/1 are quoted in decimal odds as 2.00. The 4/1 fractional odds discussed above are quoted as 5.00, while the 1/4 odds are quoted as 1.25. This is considered to be ideal for parlay betting, because the odds to be paid out are simply the product of the odds for each outcome wagered on. When looking at decimal odds in betting terms, the underdog has the higher of the two decimals, while the favorite has the lower of the two. To calculate decimal odds, you can use the equation &quot;Payout = Initial Wager × Decimal Value&quot;&quot;.&quot; For example, if you bet €100 on Liverpool to beat Manchester City at 2.00 odds the payout, including your stake, would be €200 (€100 × 2.00). Decimal odds are favoured by betting exchanges because they are the easiest to work with for trading, as they reflect the inverse of the probability of an outcome. For example, a quoted odds of 5.00 equals to a probability of 1 / 5.00, that is 0.20 or 20%.

Decimal odds are also known as &quot;European odds&quot;, &quot;digital odds&quot; or &quot;continental odds.&quot;

===Moneyline odds===

Moneyline odds are favoured by American bookmakers. The figure quoted is either positive or negative.
* When moneyline odds are positive, the figure indicates the net winnings for a $100 wager (this is done for an outcome that is considered less probable to happen than not). For example, net winnings of 4/1 would be quoted as +400.
* When moneyline odds are negative, the figure indicates how much money must be wagered to for a net winning of $100 (this is done for an outcome that is considered more probable to happen than not). For example, net winnings of 1/4 would be quoted as −400.

Moneyline odds are often referred to as &quot;American odds&quot;. A &quot;moneyline&quot; wager refers to odds on the straight-up outcome of a game with no consideration to a point spread. In most cases, the favorite will have negative moneyline odds (less payoff for a safer bet) and the underdog will have positive moneyline odds (more payoff for a risky bet). However, if the teams are evenly matched, &quot;both&quot; teams can have a negative line at the same time (e.g. −110 −110 or −105 −115), due to house take.

===Wholesale odds===
Wholesale odds are the &quot;real odds&quot; or 100% probability of an event occurring. This 100% book is displayed without any bookmaker&#x27;s profit margin, often referred to as a bookmaker&#x27;s &quot;overround&quot; built in.

A &quot;wholesale odds&quot; index is an index of all the prices in a probabilistic market operating at 100% competitiveness and displayed without any profit margin factored for market participants.

==Gambling odds vis-à-vis probabilities==
In gambling, the odds on display do not represent the true chances (as imagined by the bookmaker) that the event will or will not occur, but are the amount that the bookmaker will pay out on a winning bet, together with the required stake. In formulating the odds to display the bookmaker will have included a profit margin which effectively means that the payout to a successful bettor is less than that represented by the true chance of the event occurring. This profit is known as the &#x27;overround&#x27; on the &#x27;book&#x27; (the &#x27;book&#x27; refers to the old-fashioned ledger in which wagers were recorded, and is the derivation of the term &#x27;bookmaker&#x27;) and relates to the sum of the &#x27;odds&#x27; in the following way:

In a 3-horse race, for example, the true probabilities of each of the horses winning based on their relative abilities may be 50%, 40% and 10%. The total of these three percentages is 100%, thus representing a fair &#x27;book&#x27;. The true odds against winning for each of the three horses are 1–1, 3–2 and 9–1, respectively.

In order to generate a profit on the wagers accepted, the bookmaker may decide to increase the values to 60%, 50% and 20% for the three horses, respectively. This represents the odds against each, which are 4–6, 1–1 and 4–1, in order. These values now total 130%, meaning that the book has an overround of 30 (130−100). This value of 30 represents the amount of profit for the bookmaker if he gets bets in good proportions on each of the horses. For example, if he takes £60, £50, and £20 of stakes, respectively, for the three horses, he receives £130 in wagers but only pays £100 back (including stakes), whichever horse wins. And the expected value of his profit is positive even if everybody bets on the same horse. The art of bookmaking is in setting the odds low enough so as to have a positive expected value of profit while keeping the odds high enough to attract customers, and at the same time attracting enough bets for each outcome to reduce his risk exposure.

A study on soccer betting found that the probability for the home team to win was generally about 3.4% less than the value calculated from the odds (for example, 46.6% for even odds). It was about 3.7% less for wins by the visitors, and 5.7% less for draws.

To understand roulette probabilities and calculate them, you need to know the formula. You take the numbers your bet is on and divide them by the total number of numbers in roulette (depending on your version of the game). Then you multiply by 100.

Making a profit in gambling involves predicting the relationship of the true probabilities to the payout odds. Sports information services are often used by professional and semi-professional sports bettors to help achieve this goal.

The odds or amounts the bookmaker will pay are determined by the total amount that has been bet on all of the possible events. They reflect the balance of wagers on either side of the event, and include the deduction of a bookmaker&#x27;s brokerage fee (&quot;vig&quot; or vigorish).

Also, depending on how the betting is affected by jurisdiction, taxes may be involved for the bookmaker and/or the winning player. This may be taken into account when offering the odds and/or may reduce the amount won by a player.

<text>An adaptive filter is a system with a linear filter that has a transfer function controlled by variable parameters and a means to adjust those parameters according to an optimization algorithm. Because of the complexity of the optimization algorithms, almost all adaptive filters are digital filters. Adaptive filters are required for some applications because some parameters of the desired processing operation (for instance, the locations of reflective surfaces in a reverberant space) are not known in advance or are changing. The closed loop adaptive filter uses feedback in the form of an error signal to refine its transfer function.

Generally speaking, the closed loop adaptive process involves the use of a cost function, which is a criterion for optimum performance of the filter, to feed an algorithm, which determines how to modify filter transfer function to minimize the cost on the next iteration. The most common cost function is the mean square of the error signal.

As the power of digital signal processors has increased, adaptive filters have become much more common and are now routinely used in devices such as mobile phones and other communication devices, camcorders and digital cameras, and medical monitoring equipment.

==Example application==
The recording of a heart beat (an ECG), may be corrupted by noise from the AC mains. The exact frequency of the power and its harmonics may vary from moment to moment.

One way to remove the noise is to filter the signal with a notch filter at the mains frequency and its vicinity, but this could excessively degrade the quality of the ECG since the heart beat would also likely have frequency components in the rejected range.

To circumvent this potential loss of information, an adaptive filter could be used. The adaptive filter would take input both from the patient and from the mains and would thus be able to track the actual frequency of the noise as it fluctuates and subtract the noise from the recording. Such an adaptive technique generally allows for a filter with a smaller rejection range, which means, in this case, that the quality of the output signal is more accurate for medical purposes.

==Block diagram==
The idea behind a closed loop adaptive filter is that a variable filter is adjusted until the error (the difference between the filter output and the desired signal) is minimized. The Least Mean Squares (LMS) filter and the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) filter are types of adaptive filter.


There are two input signals to the adaptive filter: formula_1 and formula_2 which are sometimes called the &quot;primary input&quot; and the &quot;reference input&quot; respectively. The adaptation algorithm attempts to filter the reference input into a replica of the desired input by minimizing the residual signal, formula_3. When the adaptation is successful, the output of the filter formula_4 is effectively an estimate of the desired signal.

:formula_1 which includes the desired signal plus undesired interference and
:formula_2 which includes the signals that are correlated to some of the undesired interference in formula_1.
:k represents the discrete sample number.

The filter is controlled by a set of L+1 coefficients or weights.
:formula_8 represents the set or vector of weights, which control the filter at sample time k. 
::where formula_9 refers to the formula_10&#x27;th weight at k&#x27;th time.
:formula_11 represents the change in the weights that occurs as a result of adjustments computed at sample time k. 
::These changes will be applied after sample time k and before they are used at sample time k+1.

The output is usually formula_3 but it could be formula_4 or it could even be the filter coefficients.(Widrow)

The input signals are defined as follows:

:formula_14

:formula_15
:where:
::&quot;g&quot; = the desired signal,
::&quot;g″&quot; = a signal that is correlated with the desired signal &quot;g &quot;,
::&quot;u&quot; = an undesired signal that is added to &quot;g &quot;, but not correlated with &quot;g&quot; or &quot;g″&quot;
::&quot;u″&quot; = a signal that is correlated with the undesired signal &quot;u&quot;, but not correlated with &quot;g&quot; or &quot;g″&quot;,
::&quot;v&quot; = an undesired signal (typically random noise) not correlated with &quot;g&quot;, &quot;g″&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;u″&quot; or &quot;v″&quot;,
::&quot;v″&quot; = an undesired signal (typically random noise) not correlated with &quot;g&quot;, &quot;g″&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;u″&quot; or &quot;v&quot;.

The output signals are defined as follows:
:formula_16
:formula_17. 
:where:
::formula_18 = the output of the filter if the input was only &quot;g″&quot;,
::formula_19 = the output of the filter if the input was only &quot;u″&quot;,
::formula_20 = the output of the filter if the input was only &quot;v″&quot;.

===Tapped delay line FIR filter===
If the variable filter has a tapped delay line Finite Impulse Response (FIR) structure, then the impulse response is equal to the filter coefficients. The output of the filter is given by

:formula_21
::where formula_9 refers to the formula_10&#x27;th weight at k&#x27;th time.

===Ideal case===
In the ideal case formula_24. All the undesired signals in formula_1 are represented by formula_26. formula_27 consists entirely of a signal correlated with the undesired signal in formula_26.

The output of the variable filter in the ideal case is
:formula_29 .

The error signal or cost function is the difference between formula_1 and formula_4
:formula_32. The desired signal &quot;g&quot;k passes through without being changed.

The error signal formula_3 is minimized in the mean square sense when formula_34 is minimized. In other words, formula_35 is the best mean square estimate of formula_26. In the ideal case, formula_37 and formula_38, and all that is left after the subtraction is formula_39 which is the unchanged desired signal with all undesired signals removed.

===Signal components in the reference input===

In some situations, the reference input formula_40 includes components of the desired signal. This means g&#x27; ≠ 0.

Perfect cancelation of the undesired interference is not possible in the case, but improvement of the signal to interference ratio is possible. The output will be
:formula_41. The desired signal will be modified (usually decreased).

The output signal to interference ratio has a simple formula referred to as &quot;power inversion&quot;.
: formula_42.
::where 
:::formula_43 = output signal to interference ratio.
:::formula_44 = reference signal to interference ratio.
:::formula_45 = frequency in the z-domain.

This formula means that the output signal to interference ratio at a particular frequency is the reciprocal of the reference signal to interference ratio.

Example: A fast food restaurant has a drive-up window. Before getting to the window, customers place their order by speaking into a microphone. The microphone also picks up noise from the engine and the environment. This microphone provides the primary signal. The signal power from the customer&#x27;s voice and the noise power from the engine are equal. It is difficult for the employees in the restaurant to understand the customer. To reduce the amount of interference in the primary microphone, a second microphone is located where it is intended to pick up sounds from the engine. It also picks up the customer&#x27;s voice. This microphone is the source of the reference signal. In this case, the engine noise is 50 times more powerful than the customer&#x27;s voice. Once the canceler has converged, the primary signal to interference ratio will be improved from 1:1 to 50:1.

===Adaptive Linear Combiner===

The adaptive linear combiner (ALC) resembles the adaptive tapped delay line FIR filter except that there is no assumed relationship between the X values. If the X values were from the outputs of a tapped delay line, then the combination of tapped delay line and ALC would comprise an adaptive filter. However, the X values could be the values of an array of pixels. Or they could be the outputs of multiple tapped delay lines. The ALC finds use as an adaptive beam former for arrays of hydrophones or antennas.

:formula_46 
::where formula_9 refers to the formula_10&#x27;th weight at k&#x27;th time.

===LMS algorithm===

If the variable filter has a tapped delay line FIR structure, then the LMS update algorithm is especially simple. Typically, after each sample, the coefficients of the FIR filter are adjusted as follows:

: for formula_49

:formula_50 
:::μ is called the &quot;convergence factor&quot;.

The LMS algorithm does not require that the X values have any particular relationship; therefore it can be used to adapt a linear combiner as well as an FIR filter. In this case the update formula is written as:

:formula_51

The effect of the LMS algorithm is at each time, k, to make a small change in each weight. The direction of the change is such that it would decrease the error if it had been applied at time k. The magnitude of the change in each weight depends on μ, the associated X value and the error at time k. The weights making the largest contribution to the output, formula_4, are changed the most. If the error is zero, then there should be no change in the weights. If the associated value of X is zero, then changing the weight makes no difference, so it is not changed.

====Convergence====

μ controls how fast and how well the algorithm converges to the optimum filter coefficients. If μ is too large, the algorithm will not converge. If μ is too small the algorithm converges slowly and may not be able to track changing conditions. If μ is large but not too large to prevent convergence, the algorithm reaches steady state rapidly but continuously overshoots the optimum weight vector. Sometimes, μ is made large at first for rapid convergence and then decreased to minimize overshoot.

Widrow and Stearns state in 1985 that they have no knowledge of a proof that the LMS algorithm will converge in all cases.

However under certain assumptions about stationarity and independence it can be shown that the algorithm will converge if

:formula_53

::where 
:::formula_54 = sum of all input power

:::formula_55 is the RMS value of the formula_56&#x27;th input

In the case of the tapped delay line filter, each input has the same RMS value because they are simply the same values delayed. In this case the total power is
:formula_57

::where 
:::formula_58 is the RMS value of formula_40, the input stream.

This leads to a normalized LMS algorithm:

:formula_60 in which case the convergence criteria becomes: formula_61.

===Nonlinear Adaptive Filters===
The goal of nonlinear filters is to overcome limitation of linear models. There are some commonly used approaches: Volterra LMS, Kernel adaptive filter, Spline Adaptive Filter and Urysohn Adaptive Filter. Many authors include also Neural networks into this list. The general idea behind Volterra LMS and Kernel LMS is to replace data samples by different nonlinear algebraic expressions. For Volterra LMS this expression is Volterra series. In Spline Adaptive Filter the model is a cascade of linear dynamic block and static non-linearity, which is approximated by splines.
In Urysohn Adaptive Filter the linear terms in a model

:formula_62 

are replaced by piecewise linear functions

:formula_63 

which are identified from data samples.
