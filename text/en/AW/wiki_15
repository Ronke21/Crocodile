<text>The Independent Irish Party (IIP) was the designation chosen by the 48 Members of the United Kingdom Parliament returned from Ireland with the endorsement of the Tenant Right League in the 1852 general election. The League had secured their promise to offer an independent opposition (refusing all government favour and office) to the dominant landlord interest, and to advance an agrarian reform programme popularly summarised as the &quot;three F&#x27;s&quot;: fair rent, fixed tenure and free sale.

The unity of the grouping was compromised by the priority the majority gave to repealing the Ecclesiastical Titles Act, legislation passed by the Liberal government of Lord John Russell to hamper the restoration in the United Kingdom of a Catholic episcopate, and their independence by the defection of two their leading members to a new Whig-Peelite government. 

After further defections, thirteen independents survived the elections in 1857, but then split 1859 on the question of supporting a new Liberal ministry which, in 1860, made the first halting attempt to regulate Irish land tenure.

==Formation and early disunity==
The Tenant Right League joined tenant rights associations in largely Presbyterian districts in Ulster with tenant protection societies (often guided by local Catholic clergy) in the south. It was formed in 1850 at a tenant right convention called in Dublin by Charles Gavan Duffy, editor of the revived Young Irelander weekly &quot;The Nation&quot;; James MacKnight editor of the &quot;Londonderry Sentinel&quot;; Frederick Lucas, founder of the international Catholic weekly, &quot;The Tablet&quot;; and John Gray, owner of the leading nationalist paper, the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot;. Against the background of the distress caused by the Great Famine and by a fall in agricultural prices, Duffy believed that the demand for tenant rights could serve as the basis for a new all-Ireland movement and for a (potentially abstentionist) national party.

The Westminster elections of July 1852 returned 48 MPs, including Duffy from New Ross, pledged to the tenant cause. But what Duffy had projected as a &quot;League of North and South&quot; failed to deliver in Ulster. William Kirk from the border town of Newry was province&#x27;s only tenant-right representative. In Monaghan, the Rev. David Bell was to find that of his 100 Presbyterian congregants who had signed the requisition asking John Gray to stand in their constituency only 11 voted for him. In County Down, William Sharman Crawford, who as MP for Rochdale in England had been the author of a tenant right bill, had his meetings broken up by Orange vigilantes.

An early difficulty in appealing to Protestant tenants and voters in the north was the declared intention of many League-endorsed candidates to repeal the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851. Together with the presence among them of so many sitting Repeal Association MPs, their determination to remove the Act&#x27;s restrictions on a restored Catholic Church hierarchy heightened the suspicion that the League was being used for political purposes beyond its declared agenda. In this, the prominent County Down tenant-righter, Julius McCullagh, argued the 1851 Act worked its purpose: to &quot;afresh old grudges and differences - to divide a people now happily uniting&quot;. It was the case as well that landowners in the north threatened to withdraw their consent for the existing Ulster Custom if their Conservative nominees were not elected.

In November 1852, Lord Derby&#x27;s short-lived Conservative ministry introduced a land bill to compensate Irish tenants on eviction for improvements they had made to the land. The Tenant Compensation Bill passed in the House of Commons in 1853 and 1854, but failed in the House of Lords. The bills had little impressed the League and its MPs as landlords would have been left free to pass on the costs of compensation through their still unrestricted freedom to raise rents.

Holding the balance of power in the House of Commons, the Independent Irish MPs voted to bring down the government. But in the process two of the leading members, John Sadleir and William Keogh, broke their pledges of independent opposition and accepted positions in a new Whig-Peelite ministry of Lord Aberdeen. Twenty others followed as reliable supporters. While Aberdeen opposed to the Ecclesiastical Titles Act, his government gave no undertakings in regard to tenant-right policy Significantly in a League debate in February 1853 MacKnight, wary of any sign of Irish separatism, did not support Duffy in condemning these desertions. Rather, he protested the increasingly strident nationalism of southern League spokesman.

==Split and dissolution==
The Catholic Primate, Archbishop Paul Cullen, who had been sceptical of the independent opposition policy from the outset, sought to rein in clerical support for the remaining IIP in the constituencies. This was accompanied by the defection from the League of the Catholic Defence Association (to their detractors, &quot;the Pope&#x27;s Brass Band&quot;). Lucas&#x27;s decision to take a complaint against Cullen to Rome further alienated clerical support.

To Duffy the cause of the Irish tenants, and indeed of Ireland generally, seemed more hopeless than ever. In 1855 he published a farewell address to his constituency, declaring that he had resolved to retire from parliament, as it was no longer possible to accomplish the task for which he had solicited their votes. To John Dillon he wrote that an Ireland where McKeogh typified patriotism and Cullen the church was an Ireland in which he could no longer live. In 1856 Duffy and his family emigrated to Australia.

In the 1857 general election, with a recovery in agricultural prices blunting the enthusiasm of farmers for agitation, those presenting themselves as Independent Irish managed to hold on to 13 seats. One seat was won in the north on a platform of the three F&#x27;s. Samuel MacCurdy Greer was returned for Londonderry City. But Greer identified with the pro-Union British Radicals not with the IIP. The Independent Irish MPs had been under the notional leadership of George Henry Moore. Within the Catholic Church, Moore had retained sufficient support from Cullen&#x27;s rival, Archbishop John MacHale of Tuam, for his reelection in 1857 to overturned in the House of Commons on the grounds of &quot;obtrusive&quot; and &quot;unseemly&quot; clerical influence. 

The IIP never developed the organisation and leadership to get out their full vote in the Commons or to collect, when the opportunity arose, the support of other MPs. In a vote of confidence in the Lord Derby&#x27;s second Conservative government on 31 March 1859 the rump of the party split seven against six on whether join Whig and Radical factions in bringing in a new Liberal ministry under Lord Palmerston. This marked the end of any pretence to coherence, although as a faction in Irish politics the Independent Oppositionists endured until 1874. 

In the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment (Ireland) Act 1860 the new Palmerston government did no more than confirm contract law as the basis for tenancies. Legislation of the three F&#x27;s awaited the Land War of the 1880s, agitation conducted by the new Irish National Land League in alliance with the home-rule Irish Parliamentary Party.

== Legacy ==
Historian F. S. L. Lyons concludes that when, in 1858, the Conservatives returned to office with a stable majority, &quot;the hollowness of the independent party&#x27;s pledge&quot; was exposed. The &quot;temptation to trade Irish votes for Irish concessions&quot; proved in the end &quot;irresistible&quot;. Nothing had been achieved, a failure, he argues, that &quot;killed for nearly a generation any belief in the value of parliamentary pressure&quot;.

In the Long Depression of the 1870s there was an intensified Land War. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action Irish National Land League, led by the southern Protestant Charles Stewart Parnell, but from which tenant-righters in the north stood largely aloof. In 1880, Parnell began to coin electoral gains from the struggle. Sixty-four Home Rulers were elected, twenty-seven of whom were his supporters. In the 1885 election, with the size of the Irish electorate tripled by the Representation of the People Act 1884, Parnell marshalled an Irish Parliamentary Party of 85 Members. But the Independent Irish Party was &quot;in no way an ancestor&quot;. Parnell&#x27;s policy was explicitly, and to mind of many British parliamentarians, cynically, of trading, Irish votes for Irish concessions backed, when these were not forthcoming, of obstructionism.

<doc id="167859" wikidata="Q157259" url="?curid=167859" title="John Russell, 1st Earl Russell">
<text>John Russell, 1st Earl Russell (18 August 1792 – 28 May 1878), known as Lord John Russell before 1861, was a British Whig and Liberal statesman who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1846 to 1852 and again from 1865 to 1866.

The third son of the 6th Duke of Bedford, Russell was educated first by private tutors due to his fragile health and later at Westminster School and Edinburgh University before entering Parliament in 1813. In 1828 he took a leading role in the repeal of the Test Acts which discriminated against Catholics and Protestant dissenters. He was one of the principal architects of the Reform Act 1832, which was the first major reform of Parliament since the Restoration, and a significant early step on the road to democracy and away from rule by the aristocracy and landed gentry. He favoured expanding the right to vote to the middle classes and enfranchising Britain&#x27;s growing industrial towns and cities, but he never advocated universal suffrage and he opposed the secret ballot. Russell was outspoken on many issues over the course of his career, advocating Catholic emancipation in the 1820s, calling for the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1845, denouncing Pope Pius IX&#x27;s revival of Catholic bishoprics in 1850, and supporting Italian unification during the 1860s.

Russell&#x27;s ministerial career spanned four decades. In addition to his two terms as prime minister, between 1831 and 1865 he served in the cabinets of Earl Grey, Viscount Melbourne, the Earl of Aberdeen, and Viscount Palmerston. His support of liberal policies influenced the Whigs Party&#x27;s transition into the Liberal Party in 1859. Following the Corn Laws crisis of 1846, the Whigs returned to power and Russell was appointed prime minister and formed the &quot;last pure Whig administration&quot;. Domestically he passed and supported significant social reforms such as extending state support for schools, poor law reform and public health reforms. His government&#x27;s handling of the Irish Famine was widely criticised despite attempts to alleviate the situations and was rocked by the Revolutions of 1848 that took place in Europe. Russell&#x27;s relationship with his Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston was often stormy and contributed to bringing down Russell&#x27;s first government in 1852 and Palmerston&#x27;s first government in 1858. However, their renewed alliance from 1859 was one of the foundations of the united Liberal Party, which would go on to dominate British politics in the following decades.

While Russell was an energetic and effective minister during the 1830s and helped to commit the Whigs to a reform agenda, he proved less successful as prime minister. During his two periods as prime minister he often suffered from a disunited cabinet and weak support in the House of Commons, meaning he was unable to carry out much of his agenda. During his first premiership, his government failed to deal effectively with the Irish Famine, a disaster that saw the loss of a quarter of Ireland&#x27;s population through death and emigration. During his second premiership, he split his party by pressing for further parliamentary reform and was forced from office only to watch Derby and Disraeli carry a more ambitious Reform Bill. It has been said that Russell&#x27;s ministry of 1846–1852 was the ruin of the old Whig party and that his ministry of 1865–1866 was very nearly the ruin of the Liberal Party that took its place.

== Background and early life ==
Russell was born on 18 August 1792 into the highest echelons of the British aristocracy, being the third son of John Russell, later 6th Duke of Bedford, and Georgiana Byng, daughter of George Byng, 4th Viscount Torrington. The Russell family had been one of the principal Whig dynasties in England since the 17th century, and were among the richest handful of aristocratic landowning families in the country, but as a younger son of the 6th Duke of Bedford, he was not expected to inherit the family estates. As a younger son of a duke, he bore the courtesy title &quot;Lord John Russell&quot;, but he was not a peer in his own right. He was, therefore, able to sit in the House of Commons until he was made an earl in 1861 and was elevated to the House of Lords.

Russell was born two months premature and was small and sickly as a child (even in adulthood he remained under in height, and his small stature was frequently the butt of jokes by political opponents and caricaturists). In 1801 at the age of nine he was sent away to school. Shortly thereafter his mother died. After being withdrawn from Westminster School in 1804 due to ill health, Russell was educated by tutors, including Edmund Cartwright. In 1806 Russell&#x27;s father was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the short-lived Ministry of All the Talents and it was during this time that the young Russell met Charles James Fox. Fox was Russell&#x27;s formative political hero and would remain an inspiration throughout his life. Russell attended the University of Edinburgh from 1809 to 1812, lodging with Professor John Playfair, who oversaw his studies. He did not take a degree. Although often in poor health, he travelled widely in Britain and in Continental Europe, and held commission as captain in the Bedfordshire Militia in 1810. During his continental travels, Russell visited Spain where his brother was serving as aide-de-camp to Lord Wellington in the Peninsular War. The following year, Russell had a 90-minute meeting with Napoleon in December 1814, during the former emperor&#x27;s exile at Elba.

== Early political career ==
===Backbench MP: 1813–1830===
Russell entered the House of Commons as a Whig in 1813 at the age of 20. The future reformer gained his seat by virtue of his father, the Duke of Bedford, instructing the 30 or so electors of Tavistock to return him as an MP even though at the time Russell was abroad and under age. Russell&#x27;s maiden speech in Parliament was in opposition to then Lord Liverpool&#x27;s government&#x27;s stance on the union of Norway and Sweden. Though overlooked by Parliamentary reporters and now forgotten, his second speech, summarised in Hansard, reflected his commitment to liberty.

Russell&#x27;s maiden speech was delivered on 14 July 1814, which was in time for opposition to the second reading of the Alien Acts, a measure that nevertheless became law. Russell concisely criticised the act, stating what he considered &quot;the Act to be one which was very liable to abuse. The present time was that which least called for it; and Ministers, in bringing forward the measure now because it had been necessary before, reminded him of the unfortunate wag mentioned in &#x27;Joe Miller,’ who was so fond of rehearsing a joke that he always repeated it at the wrong time&quot;. During his early months in Parliament, Russell became a member of Grillion&#x27;s Club, founded a year earlier in Bond Street This unique club brought together prominent Whigs and Tories for social purposes, strictly forbidding political debate and fostering only camaraderie and the &quot;amenities of life&quot;. In later years, the club became a cherished retreat for Russell and other notable politicians, offering a respite from the pressures of Westminster.

That year, Russell&#x27;s health saw a recovery and abled him to travel abroad. He first went to Italy by sea and arrived at Livorno in the opening days of December. He further traveled in Eastern Europe even when Parliament reassembled, and on the Christmas Eve of that year, Russell was able to enjoy a memorable interview with the recently exiled Emperor of the French Napoleon Bonaparte. Russell entered Parliament more out of a sense of duty and family tradition than out of serious political ambition. With the exception the 1806-1807 coalition government in which Russell&#x27;s father had served, the Whigs had been out of power since 1783, and Russell could have had no certain expectation of a ministerial career. In June 1815, Russell denounced the Bourbon Restoration and Britain&#x27;s declaration of war against the recently returned Napoleon by arguing in the House of Commons that foreign powers had no right to dictate France&#x27;s form of government.

In 1817, tired of the prospect of perpetual opposition, Russell resigned from Parliament. After spending a year out of politics and travelling on the continent, he changed his mind and re-entered Parliament for Tavistock at the 1818 general election. In 1819, Russell embraced the cause of parliamentary reform and he led the more reformist wing of the Whigs throughout the 1820s. In 1828, while still an opposition backbencher, Russell introduced a Sacramental Test bill with the aim of abolishing the prohibitions on Catholics and Protestant dissenters being elected to local government and from holding civil and military offices. The bill gained the backing of the Tory Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel and was passed into law.

===Minister under Grey and Melbourne: 1830–1841===
When the Whigs came to power in 1830, Russell entered Earl Grey&#x27;s government as Paymaster of the Forces. Despite being a relatively junior minister, as a vocal advocate for Parliamentary reform for over a decade, Russell became a principal leader in the fight for the Reform Act 1832. He was one of the committee of four tasked by Grey with drafting the reform bill, alongside cabinet ministers Lord Durham, Lord Duncannon and Sir James Graham. Despite not yet being in the Cabinet, Russell was chosen to introduce the bill in March 1831 and over the following year he successfully steered the Reform Act&#x27;s difficult progress through the Commons.

Russell earned the nickname &quot;Finality Jack&quot; from his pronouncing the Act a final measure but in later years he would go on to push for further reform of Parliament. In May 1834, Russell made a speech on the Irish Tithes bill, in which he argued that the revenue generated by tithes was more than was justified by the size of the established Protestant church in Ireland. Russell argued that a proportion the tithe revenue should instead be appropriated for the education of the Irish poor, regardless of denomination.

The speech was seen by its opponents as an attack on the established church in Ireland and it cemented a split within Grey&#x27;s government over the issue of Irish tithes. The following month four members of the Cabinet resigned over the issue, weakening the government&#x27;s hold on Parliament. Sensing that his position was now hopeless, Grey offered his resignation to the King in July, and was replaced by Viscount Melbourne at the head of the government.
In November 1834, when the leader of the Commons, Lord Althorp, succeeded to the peerage as Earl Spencer, Russell became the leader of the Whigs in the Commons. Russell&#x27;s appointment prompted King William IV to terminate Melbourne&#x27;s government, in part because the King objected to Russell&#x27;s views on the Irish Church. This remains the last time in British history that a monarch has dismissed a government. The subsequent minority Conservative government lasted less than five months before resigning in April 1835. Russell then returned to office as Home Secretary in Melbourne&#x27;s second government, before serving as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1839 to 1841. Soon after the formation of the new cabinet, the Melbourne called a general election, in which Russell suffered the loss of his home constituency in Devonshire but a new seat was found for him in the seat of Stroud and in May he was back in Parliament. Through this period, he continued to lead the more reformist wing of the Whig party.

Russell&#x27;s first major act as Home Secretary was introducing the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which based on commission established by Lord Grey. It abolished outdated privileges granted to corporate cities, abolished dominance of freemen cliques, corrected widespread abuses, and placed municipal governance in the hands of taxpayers. Despite resistance from the Opposition and the Lords, Russell successfully guided the measure through Parliament, securing its passage in September in a modified form. As Home Secretary, Russell recommended and secured royal pardons for the Tolpuddle Martyrs and partial commutation of their sentences. In 1836, he introduced the Marriages Act, which introduced civil marriages in England and Wales and allowed Catholics and Protestant Dissenters to marry in their own churches.

In 1837, he steered a series of seven Acts through Parliament, which together reduced the number of offences carrying a sentence of death from thirty-seven to sixteen. This number was reduced further by the Substitution of Punishments of Death Act 1841. After these reforms the death penalty was rarely used in the United Kingdom for crimes other than murder. As Home Secretary Russell also introduced the public registration for births, marriages and deaths and played a large role in democratising the government of cities outside of London. Russell also introduced reforms regulating prisons and improving condition especially in the treatment of juvenile offenders. Under his instruction prisoners in Newgate Prison were transferred from metropolitan counties to the gaols in each county. Following in the steps of Sir Samuel Romilly, Russell reduced the number of capital crimes, and established reformatories for juvenile offenders.

===Opposition: 1841–1846===

In 1841 the Whigs lost the general election to the Conservatives and Russell and his colleagues returned to opposition. In November 1845, following the failure of that year&#x27;s potato harvest across Britain and Ireland, Russell came out in favour of the repeal of the Corn Laws and called upon the Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel to take urgent action to alleviate the emerging food crisis.

Peel had by this time already become convinced of the need for repeal, but he was opposed in this by the majority of his own cabinet and party. On 11 December 1845, frustrated by his party&#x27;s unwillingness to support him on repeal, Peel resigned as prime minister and Queen Victoria invited Russell to form a new government. With the Whigs a minority in the Commons however, Russell struggled to assemble the necessary support. When Lord Grey declared that he would not serve in cabinet if Lord Palmerston was made Foreign Secretary, it became clear to Russell that he could not form a viable government.

Russell declined the Queen&#x27;s invitation on 21 December and Peel agreed to stay on as prime minister. In June 1846, Peel repealed the Corn Laws with Whig support, bitterly dividing the Conservative Party in the process. Later that same night Peel&#x27;s Irish Coercion Bill was defeated after vengeful anti-repeal Tories voted with the opposition; and Peel, taking this as a vote of no confidence, resigned as prime minister. Russell accepted the Queen&#x27;s offer to form a government; this time Grey did not object to Palmerston&#x27;s appointment.

== Prime Minister: 1846–1852==

=== Appointment and cabinet ===

Russell took office as prime minister with the Whigs only a minority in the House of Commons and particularly during a time of national crisis, facing &quot;famine, fever, trade failing, and discontent growing&quot;, as described in his wife&#x27;s journal on 14 July. It was the bitter split in the Conservative Party over the Corn Laws that allowed Russell&#x27;s government to remain in power in spite of this, with Sir Robert Peel and his supporters offering tentative support to the new ministry in order to keep the protectionist Conservatives under Lord Stanley in opposition. At the general election of August 1847 the Whigs made gains at the expense of the Conservatives, but remained a minority, with Russell&#x27;s government still dependent on the votes of Peelite and Irish Repealer MPs to win divisions in the Commons.

The new cabinet inevitably included Palmerston as Foreign Secretary, Sir Charles Wood as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir George Grey as the Home Secretary, former prime minister the Earl Grey as the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, the Lord Clarendon as the President of the Board of Trade, and Lord Lansdowne as President of the council. Sir John Cam Hobhouse, Fox Maule-Ramsay, the Lord Panmure, and Mr. Thomas Macaulay held lesser roles. Sir James Graham declined the Governor-Generalship of India to pursue unfulfilled aspirations in Westminster. The Conservative Party, fractured by Peel&#x27;s disgrace and suspicion among its factions, lacked effective leadership, with Disraeli yet to be taken seriously. &quot;We are left masters of the field&quot;, Palmerston remarked, &quot;not only on account of our own merits, which, though we say it ourselves, are great, but by virtue of the absence of any efficient competitors&quot;.

===Domestic agenda===

Russell&#x27;s political agenda was frequently frustrated by his lack of a reliable Commons majority. However, his government was able to secure a number of notable social reforms. In a speech to his constituents, Russell said:

Russell introduced teachers&#x27; pensions and used Orders in Council to make grants for teacher training. Colleges were established to prepare teachers for their roles, and graduates received additional government grants alongside their salaries. Schools that passed official inspections were also eligible for government funding, ensuring accountability and raising educational standards. In 1847, Russell implemented reforms to improve primary education in Britain based on the Melbourne government&#x27;s earlier initiative of placing oversight for education grants under the Privy Council and also by addressing systemic flaws by replacing unpaid monitors with paid pupil-teachers. The Public Baths and Wash-houses Acts of 1847 and 1848 enabled local authorities to build municipal baths and washing facilities for the growing urban working classes.

Russell was instrumental in addressing social and administrative issues in country. Russell lent his support to the passage of the Factories Act 1847, which restricted the working hours of women and young persons (aged 13–18) in textile mills to 10 hours per day. The bill introduced by from notable social reformers Lord Shaftesbury and John Fielden that was well received by artisans and operatives alike. He supported reforms that provided practical relief to over 363,000 women and children employed in mills and factories, easing the burden of monotonous labor. Russell also transformed the Poor Law Commission into a ministerial department, making it accountable to Parliament through the President of the Poor Law Board which introduced regulations for workhouse management and guardian meetings, which improving control. Additionally, the growing needs of Manchester were acknowledged with the creation of the Bishopric of Manchester. In the aftermath of the political and social turmoil that took place during the Revolutions of 1848, fears grew of a similar outcome in Britain particularly in Ireland which led to the passage of the Treason Felony Act 1848 that made it illegal and punishable by penal labour speaking or writing against the Crown.

1848 saw the introduction of the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers and the Public Health Act 1848 (11 &amp; 12 Vict. c. 63), by which the state assumed responsibility for sewerage, clean water supply, refuse collection and other aspects of public health across much of England and Wales. The act was influenced by the work of Sir Edwin Chadwick and Dr. Thomas Southwood Smith, addressed the pressing sanitary issues in cities and towns, leading to improvements in public health and the general social conditions of the population. Previously, both Whigs and Tories had largely ignored such practical reforms, despite their clear connection to the community&#x27;s health and well-being.

Russell&#x27;s determination to extend free trade led to the repeal of the Navigation Acts.Following the election of Lionel de Rothschild in the 1847 general election, Russell introduced a Jewish Relief bill, which would have allowed Rothschild and other Jews to sit in the House of Commons without their having to take the explicitly Christian oath of allegiance. In 1848, the bill was passed by the House of Commons, receiving support from the Whigs and a minority of Conservatives (including future prime minister Benjamin Disraeli). However, it was twice rejected by the Tory dominated House of Lords, as was a new bill in 1851. Rothschild was re-elected in the 1852 general election following the fall of the Russell government but was unable to take his seat until the Jews Relief Act was finally passed in 1858.

===Ireland===
Russell&#x27;s government led the calamitous response to the Irish Famine. During the course of the famine, an estimated one million people died from a combination of malnutrition, disease and starvation and well over one million more emigrated from Ireland. After taking office in 1846, Russell&#x27;s ministry introduced a programme of public works that by the end of that year employed some half-a-million but proved impossible to administer. In 1846 Russell reported that in one year more than 50,000 Irish families had been &quot;turned out of their wretched dwellings without pity and without refuge...we have made it the most degraded and most miserable country in the world...all the world is crying shame upon us.&quot; In January 1847, the government abandoned this policy, realising that it had failed, and turned to a mixture of &quot;indoor&quot; and &quot;outdoor&quot; direct relief; the former administered in workhouses through the Irish Poor Laws, the latter through soup kitchens. The costs of the Poor Law fell primarily on the local landlords, some of whom in turn attempted to reduce their liability by evicting their tenants. In June 1847, the Poor Law Extension Act was passed, which embodied the principle, popular in Britain, that Irish property should support Irish poverty. Irish landlords were believed in Britain to have created the conditions that led to the famine, a view which Russell shared.

=== Chartists&#x27; movement ===
Within six years after the passage of the Great Reform Act and the accession of the Queen, the Chartist movement grew out of frustration following the Great Reform Act&#x27;s failure to give the vote beyond those who owned property and aimed to extend further political reform. In 1838, representatives of the working class amplified calls for reform in the People&#x27;s Charter of 1838 which demanded universal manhood suffrage, equal division of constituencies, vote by ballots and abolishing the qualification of owning property in order to sit in Parliament. Following the upheaval in Europe during the Revolutions of 1848, fears in Britain grew of the similar unrest despite it not being &quot;formidable&quot;. The events on the continent eventually inspired the Chartists and demand for reform increased as many in the working class began to view that their interests were disregarded. The movement was led by the Irish barrister and journalist Feargus O&#x27;Connor who entered Parliament as a follower of Daniel O&#x27;Connell and as member for Cork. The Chartists planned a protest in April and Russell was at first supportive of the demonstration to take place. He proposed that demonstration be permitted to cross the Westminster Bridge and be able to present the petition to Parliament itself with the police preventing the protesters from marching to Charing Cross and regrouping. But by 6 April, Russell&#x27;s government felt compelled to declare the demonstration illegal. On the advice of the Duke of Wellington the Bank of England, the Tower of London, and the surrounding neighbourhood of Kennington Common were protected by cavalry and infantry with the entrances to Parliament itself and Whitehall government offices were protected by artillery. On 10 April, London braced for a feared uprising as the Chartists planned a massive protest at Kennington Common, but the turnout was far smaller than expected, with many present merely out of curiosity. O’Connor abandoned the march to Parliament, and the petition boasting &quot;five million&quot; signatures contained numerous fictitious ones and was delivered quietly by cab. Heavy rain and public ridicule ultimately dispersed the crowd, ending the agitation with anticlimactic results. Russell characteristically said of the incident: &quot;London escaped the fate of Paris, Berlin, and Vienna. For my own part, I saw in these proceedings a fresh proof that the people of England were satisfied with the Government under which they had the happiness to live, did not wish to be instructed by their neighbours in the principles of freedom, and did not envy them either the liberty they had enjoyed under Robespierre, or the order which had been established among them by Napoleon the Great.&quot;

=== Foreign policy ===
Lord Palmerston as Foreign Secretary dominated and often dictated the direction of the foreign policy of the Russell government by advancing British interests often at the frustration of both the Cabinet and the Court. It was Palmerston&#x27;s belief that Britain have a duty to champion justice and liberty alongside Britain being able to ensure that its status as a great power be retained. His handling of foreign affairs came with a penchant for personal ascendancy and his policies regarding Europe, particularly in 1848, proved to perilous and led to conflicts with both Russell and the Queen. Early during Russell&#x27;s government, Palmerston&#x27;s assertive and often confronting treatment of other Cabinet colleagues led to anger among many in Parliament and Robert Peel did not conceal his view that Russell allowed Palmerston to go beyond his restrains. However, Palmerston&#x27;s position at the Foreign Office proved to be consequential and despite being in &#x27;substantial&#x27; agreement with his foreign secretary, Russell disapproved of Palmerston&#x27;s unpredictable and independent action.

Russell&#x27;s own approach to Europe and in general diplomacy was shaped by the pressing need for stability amidst a volatile political landscape. Russell believed that Britain&#x27;s interests were best served by maintaining the territorial settlements established after the Napoleonic Wars in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. However, Russell was also keenly aware that Britain should not cling to outdated alliances or strategies if more favourable alternatives were available. Russell&#x27;s diplomatic strategy was heavily influenced by pragmatism, particularly when it came to Austria&#x27;s weakening position in Italy, knowing that Austria was no longer in a position to restore its formal control over the Italian peninsula and lacked both military and financial resources to endure a prolonged conflict, especially with the likelihood of French intervention. Russell, therefore, proposed that the British delegation should exert diplomatic pressure on Vienna to relinquish Lombardy and Venice, thereby averting further escalation and preserving the balance of power in Europe.

In addition to the &quot;Italian question&quot;, Russell had a nuanced policy towards Spain and Germany. On Spain, he adopted a non-interventionist stance, arguing that Britain had no strategic interest in involving itself in Spain&#x27;s internal affairs. This approach was consistent with Russell&#x27;s philosophy of respecting the sovereignty of European nations, as long as their actions did not threaten British interests. However, Russell&#x27;s immediate attention turned to Germany, where the Schleswig–Holstein question posed a significant risk of destabilising the region. The dispute, which involved competing claims over the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, threatened to ignite war in Central Europe. In his state paper, Russell stated: &quot;It is our interest to use our influence as speedily and as generally as possible to settle the pending questions and to fix the boundaries of States. Otherwise, if war once becomes general, it will spread over Germany, reach Belgium, and finally sweep England into its vortex. Should our efforts for peace succeed, Europe may begin a new career with more or less of hope and of concord; should they fail, we must keep our sword in the scabbard as long as we can, but we cannot hope to be neutral in a great European war. England cannot be indifferent to the supremacy of France over Germany and Italy, or to the advance of Russian armies to Constantinople; still less to the incorporation of Belgium with a new French Empire.&quot;

In contrast to Russell&#x27;s cautious policy, Palmerston&#x27;s approach was characterised by a more independent and often combative stance. Palmerston was known for his willingness to go against the established norms of British and European diplomacy, even when this put him at odds with the Court and his cabinet colleagues. His interventions in foreign affairs, particularly his support for interventionist policies, often led to tensions within the government. Despite facing opposition, Palmerston remained unfazed by criticism and continued to champion his views with remarkable resilience. Unlike Russell, who sought to avoid open conflict and maintain stability through diplomacy, Palmerston was more willing to take bold if not rash action, even if they risked alienating allies or provoking international disputes. By the end of the parliamentary session in 1849, Palmerston found himself in a precarious political position. His policies had generated considerable opposition, both from within the Cabinet and from the Opposition. The growing dissatisfaction with his approach threatened his political future, as several of his colleagues and rivals sought to discredit him. In a letter to his brother, he reflected on the political turbulence of the past months and on winning the success he deserves by writing: &quot;After the trumpetings of attacks that were to demolish first one and then another of the Government: first me, then Grey, then Charles Wood; we have come triumphantly out of the debates and divisions, and end the session stronger than we began it.&quot;

=== Relations with the Roman Catholic Church ===
In the first half of his premiership Russell aimed to improve the British government&#x27;s relations with the papacy and the Catholic clergy in Ireland, which he saw as one of the keys to making Ireland a more willing part of the United Kingdom. Russell proposed to make an annual grant of £340,000 to the Catholic Church in Ireland, with the aim of ameliorating Irish Catholic opinion towards the Union. In 1847, Russell&#x27;s father-in-law the Earl of Minto was dispatched on a confidential mission to Rome to seek the Pope&#x27;s support for the grants plan. In the end, the idea had to be abandoned due to Catholic objections to what they saw as an attempt to control their clergy.

However, Russell pressed ahead with plans to re-establish formal diplomatic relations between the Court of St James&#x27;s and the Holy See, which had been severed when James II was deposed in 1688. Russell managed to pass an Act to authorise an exchange of ambassadors with Rome, but not before the bill was amended by Parliament to stipulate that the Pope&#x27;s ambassador must be a layman. The Pope refused to accept such a restriction on his choice of representative and so the exchange of ambassadors did not take place. It would not be until 1914 that formal UK-Vatican diplomatic relations were finally established.
Relations with the papacy soured badly in late 1850 after Pope Pius IX issued the bull &quot;Universalis Ecclesiae&quot;. By this bull Pius unilaterally reintroduced Catholic bishops to England and Wales for the first time since the Reformation. Anti-Catholic feelings ran high with many Protestants incensed at what they saw as impertinent foreign interference in the prerogative of the established Church of England to appoint bishops. Russell, not withstanding his long record of advocating civil liberties for Catholics, shared the traditional Whig suspicion of the Catholic hierarchy, and was angered at what he saw as a papal imposition. On 4 November 1850, in a letter to the Bishop of Durham published in &quot;The Times&quot; the same day, Russell wrote that the Pope&#x27;s actions suggested a &quot;pretension to supremacy&quot; and declared that &quot;No foreign prince or potentate will be permitted to fasten his fetters upon a nation which has so long and so nobly vindicated its right to freedom of opinion, civil, political, and religious&quot;. Russell&#x27;s &quot;Durham letter&quot; won him popular support in England but in Ireland it was viewed as an unwarranted insult to the Pope. It lost Russell the confidence of Irish Repealer MPs and the cabinet were angered that he had made such an incendiary statement without having consulting them.

The following year Russell passed the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851 with Tory support, which made it a criminal offence carrying a fine of £100 for anyone outside of the Church of England to assume an episcopal title &quot;of any city, town or place, or of any territory or district...in the United Kingdom.&quot; The Act was widely ignored without consequences and only served to further alienate Irish MPs, thereby weakening the government&#x27;s position in the Commons.

===Disagreements with Palmerston ===
Russell frequently clashed with his headstrong Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, whose belligerence and support for continental revolution he found embarrassing. In 1847 Palmerston provoked a confrontation with the French government by undermining the plans of the Spanish court to marry the young Spanish Queen and her sister into the French royal family.
He subsequently clashed with Russell over plans to increase the size of the army and the navy to defend against the perceived threat of French invasion, which subsided after the overthrow of the French king in 1848. Louis Philippe&#x27;s flight from Paris signalled a new spark of revolutionary fervour throughout Europe and next went to Austria, where a student revolt forced Austrian Chancellor Count Metternich out of the country and take up refuge in England with Emperor Ferdinand considering asylum in Tyrol. The spirit of revolution soon spread to Milan, Naples; Berlin and Switzerland.

In 1850, further tension arose between the two over Palmerston&#x27;s gunboat diplomacy in the Don Pacifico affair, in which Palmerston sought compensation from the Greek government for the ransacking and the burning of the house of David Pacifico, a Gibraltarian holder of a British passport. Russell considered the matter &quot;hardly worth the interposition of the British lion,&quot; and when Palmerston ignored some of his instructions, the Prime Minister wrote to Palmerston telling him he had informed the Queen that he &quot;thought the interests of the country required that a change should take place at the Foreign Department.&quot; However, less than a month later Lord Stanley successfully led the House of Lords into passing a motion of censure of the Government over its handling of the affair and Russell realised that he needed to align with Palmerston in order to prevent a similar motion being passed by the House of Commons, which would have obliged the Government to resign. The Government prevailed, but Palmerston came out of the affair with his popularity at new heights since he was seen as the champion of defending British subjects anywhere in the world.

=== Fall of ministry and resignation ===
In France, the ambitious rather than able Louis Napoleon, the elected President of France provoked a self-coup d&#x27;état and overthrew the National Assembly and revised the Constitution of 1848. Both the Cabinet and the Court were alarmed by the incident and felt the need to declare &quot;absolute neutrality&quot; and instructions were given to the British ambassador Lord Normanby. By the time the official communication was made, Normanby was met with news that Palmerston had met with the French ambassador and declared the coup &quot;a act of self-defence&quot;. Russell forced Palmerston to resign as Foreign Secretary after Palmerston recognised Napoleon III&#x27;s coup of 2 December 1851 without first consulting the Queen or Cabinet. Palmerston was offered the position of Viceroy of Ireland but refused out of contempt. Russell recognised that the dismissal of Palmerston have significantly weakened his government&#x27;s position and the matter only grew dire after Lord Clarendon declined the position at the Foreign Office. Russell later appointed Lord Granville as Foreign Secretary. Russell tried to strengthen his government by recruiting leading Peelites such as Sir James Graham and the Duke of Newcastle to his administration, but they declined. Out of office, Palmerston sought revenge by turning a vote on a militia bill into a vote of confidence in the Government. A majority vote in favour of an amendment proposed by Palmerston caused the downfall of Russell&#x27;s ministry on 21 February 1852. This was Palmerston&#x27;s famous &quot;tit for tat with Johnny Russell.&quot; According to his brother-in-law, the Hon. George Elliot, Russell said following his resignation that &quot;Its all fair. I dealt him a blow and he has given me one in return.&quot;

==Between premierships==
=== In opposition: February–December 1852 ===
Following Russell&#x27;s resignation, on 23 February 1852 the Earl of Derby accepted the Queen&#x27;s invitation to form a government. The new Conservative ministry were a minority in the Commons due to the continuing rift with the Peelites. Derby called a general election for July but failed to secure a majority. After the election Derby&#x27;s Conservatives held 292 out of the 662 seats in the Commons but were able to carry on in office due to divisions among the opposition. Negotiations over a Whig-Peelite coalition stalled over the question of who would lead it. Russell&#x27;s authority and popularity within the Whigs had been dented by his falling out with Palmerston, who flatly refused to serve under him again. Moreover, he had alienated many in the Peelites and the Irish Brigade, who held the balance of power in the Commons, leaving them unwilling to support another Russell-led government. Palmerston proposed Lord Lansdowne as a compromise candidate. This was acceptable to Russell but Lansdowne was reluctant to take on the burdens of leading a government. The defeat of Disraeli&#x27;s Budget in December 1852 forced the issue. Derby&#x27;s government resigned and the Queen sent for Lansdowne and the Peelite Lord Aberdeen. Lansdowne declined the Queen&#x27;s invitation, pleading ill-health and so Aberdeen was tasked with forming a government.

=== The Aberdeen coalition: 1852–1855 ===
Russell, as the leader of the Whigs, agreed to bring his party into a coalition with the Peelites, headed by Aberdeen. As the leader of the largest party in the coalition, Russell was reluctant to serve under Aberdeen in a subordinate position, but agreed to take on the role of Foreign Secretary on a temporary basis, to lend stability to the fledgling government. He resigned the role in February 1853 in favour of Clarendon, but continued to lead for the government in the Commons and attended cabinet without ministerial responsibilities. Russell was unhappy that half of Aberdeen&#x27;s cabinet was made up of Peelites, despite the fact that the Whigs contributed hundreds of MPs to the Government&#x27;s support in the Commons, and the Peelites only around 40. However, he came to admire some of his Peelite colleagues, particularly the Chancellor of the Exchequer William Gladstone, who would go on to become an important political ally in later years.

With Aberdeen&#x27;s agreement, Russell used his position as Leader of the House of Commons to push for a new Reform Act. Although Russell had promoted the Reform Act 1832 as a one-off measure to re-balance the constitution, after twenty years he had become convinced of the need for further electoral reform. In February 1854 Russell introduced his bill to the House. The property qualification was to be reduced from £10 to £6 in boroughs, and from £50 to £10 in the counties. Additionally 66 seats would be removed from undersized constituencies and redistributed. The second reading of the bill was set for March 1854, but the prospect of imminent war with Russia led to it being postponed until April. After the outbreak of war on 28 March Russell came under pressure from the cabinet to withdraw the bill entirely. Russell threatened to resign if the cabinet abandoned the reform bill, but he was convinced to stay on by Aberdeen, who promised that he would support the reform bill if Russell reintroduced it in a future session. However, with the fall of the Aberdeen government the following year, it would be 12 years before Russell had another chance to introduce a reform bill.

Together with Palmerston, Russell supported the government taking a hard line against Russian territorial ambitions in the Ottoman Empire, a policy that ultimately resulted in Britain&#x27;s entry into the Crimean War in March 1854, an outcome that the more cautious Aberdeen had hoped to avoid. In the following months Russell grew frustrated by what he saw as a lack of effective war leadership by Aberdeen and the Secretary of State for War, the Duke of Newcastle. Dispatches from the front reported that the army was suffering from supply shortages and a lack of adequate accommodation and medical facilities. In November 1854 Russell urged Aberdeen to replace Newcastle with Palmerston, who he believed would get a firmer grip on the organisation of the war, but these suggestions came to nothing. In January 1855, after a series of military setbacks, a Commons motion was brought by the radical MP John Roebuck to appoint a select committee to investigate the management of the war. Russell, not wishing to vote against an inquiry he believed was badly needed, resigned from the cabinet in order to abstain. Aberdeen viewed the Roebuck motion as a vote of no confidence in his leadership and, accordingly, when it passed by 305–148, he resigned.

In the eyes of many, including the Queen and Aberdeen, Russell&#x27;s temperamental behaviour and personal ambition had undermined the stability of the coalition. On visiting Windsor Castle to resign, Aberdeen told the Queen &quot;Had it not been for the incessant attempts of Lord John Russell to keep up party differences, it must be acknowledged that the experiment of a coalition had succeeded admirably,&quot; an assessment with which the Queen agreed. Russell accepted an invitation from the Queen to form a new government but found that he could not assemble the necessary support, with many of his colleagues having been angered by his abandonment of Aberdeen over the Roebuck motion. Palmerston became prime minister, and Russell reluctantly accepted the role of Colonial Secretary in his cabinet. Russell was sent to Vienna to negotiate peace terms with Russia, but his proposals were rejected and he resigned from the cabinet and returned to the backbenches in July 1855.

=== Return to the backbenches: 1855–1859 ===
Following his resignation Russell wrote to his father-in-law that he would not serve again under Palmerston or any other prime minister. For a time it appeared as if his career in frontbench politics might be over. Russell continued to speak out from the backbenches on the issues he most cared about – lobbying for increased government grants for education and for reduction in the property qualification for Parliamentary elections. In early 1857 Russell became a vocal critic of Palmerston&#x27;s government over the Anglo-Persian War and the Second Opium War. Russell spoke in support of a motion tabled by Richard Cobden, which criticised British military action in China and calling for a select committee inquiry. When the motion passed on 3 March, Palmerston dissolved Parliament and went to the country. In the subsequent general election Palmerston was swept back into power on a tide of patriotic feeling with an increased majority. Many of Palmerston&#x27;s critics lost their seats but Russell hung on in the City of London, after fighting off an attempt to deselect him and replace him with a pro-Palmerston Whig candidate. Palmerston&#x27;s triumph was short-lived. In February 1858 the Government rushed through a Conspiracy to Murder bill, following the attempted assassination of Napoleon III by Italian nationalist Felice Orsini – an attack planned in Britain using British-made explosives. Russell attacked the bill, which he saw as undermined traditional British political liberties to appease a foreign government. On 19 February Russell voted in favour of Thomas Milner Gibson&#x27;s motion, which criticised the government for bowing to French demands. When the motion passed by 19 votes Palmerston&#x27;s government resigned.

=== Foreign Secretary under Palmerston: 1859–1865 ===
In 1859, following another short-lived Conservative government, Palmerston and Russell made up their differences, and Russell consented to serve as Foreign Secretary in a new Palmerston cabinet, usually considered the first true Liberal cabinet. This period was a particularly eventful one in the world outside Britain, seeing the Unification of Italy (the change of British government to one sympathetic to Italian nationalism had a marked part in this process), the American Civil War, and the 1864 war over Schleswig-Holstein between Denmark and the German states. Russell arranged the London Conference of 1864, but failed to establish peace in the war. His tenure of the Foreign Office was noteworthy for the famous dispatch in which he defended Italian unification: &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Government will turn their eyes rather to the gratifying prospect of a people building up the edifice of their liberties, and consolidating the work of their independence, amid the sympathies and good wishes of Europe&quot; (27 October 1860).

=== Elevation to the peerage: 1861 ===
In 1861 Russell was elevated to the peerage as Earl Russell, of Kingston Russell in the County of Dorset, and as Viscount Amberley, of Amberley in the County of Gloucester, and of Ardsalla in the County of Meath
in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Henceforth, as a suo jure peer, rather than merely being known as &#x27;Lord&#x27; because he was the son of a Duke, he sat in the House of Lords for the remainder of his career.

== Prime Minister again: 1865–1866 ==

When Palmerston suddenly died in late 1865, Russell again became prime minister. His second premiership was short and frustrating, and Russell failed in his great ambition of expanding the franchise, a task that would be left to his Conservative successors, Derby and Benjamin Disraeli. In 1866, party disunity again brought down his government. Russell never again held any office. His last contribution to the House of Lords was on 3 August 1875.

== Personal life ==

===Marriages and children===

Russell married Adelaide, Lady Ribblesdale (widow of Thomas Lister, 2nd Baron Ribblesdale, 1790 –1832) on 11 April 1835. Together they had two daughters:
* Lady Georgiana Adelaide Russell (1836 – 25 September 1922). She married Archibald Peel (son of General Jonathan Peel) on 15 August 1867. They had seven children.
* Lady Victoria Russell (20 October 1838 – 9 May 1880). She married Henry Villiers (the son of The Honorable Henry Montagu Villiers) on 16 April 1861. They had ten children and left many descendants.

Adelaide came down with a fever following the birth of their second child and died a few days later on 1 November 1838. Following her death, Russell continued to raise his late wife&#x27;s son, Thomas, 3rd Lord Ribblesdale, and three daughters from her first marriage, as well as their two daughters.

On 20 July 1841, Russell remarried, to Lady Frances (&quot;Fanny&quot;) Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, daughter of Russell&#x27;s cabinet colleague Gilbert Elliot, 2nd Earl of Minto. Together they had four children:
* John Russell, Viscount Amberley (1842–1876). He married The Hon. Katherine Stanley on 8 November 1864. They had four children, including a stillborn daughter. Their eldest son, Frank, would succeed Lord John to the title to become the 2nd Earl Russell. Another son, the 3rd Earl, was the philosopher Bertrand Russell.
* Hon. George Gilbert William Russell (14 April 1848 – 27 January 1933).
* Hon. Francis Albert Rollo Russell (1849–1914). He married Alice Godfrey (d. 12 May 1886) on 21 April 1885. They had one son. He remarried Gertrude Joachim on 28 April 1891. They had two children.
* Lady Mary Agatha Russell (1853–1933).

In 1847, Queen Victoria granted Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park to Lord and Lady John. It remained their family home for the rest of their lives.

=== Religious views ===
Russell was religious in a simple non-dogmatic way and supported &quot;broad church&quot; stances in the Church of England. He opposed the &quot;Oxford Movement&quot; because its &quot;Tractarian&quot; members were too dogmatic and too close to Roman Catholicism. He supported Broad Churchmen or Latitudinarians by several appointments of liberal churchmen as bishops. In 1859 he reversed himself and decided to free non-Anglicans of the duty of paying rates (taxes) to the local Anglican parish. His political clumsiness and opposition to Church finance made him a target of attack and ridicule in many Church circles.

===Final years and death===

Following the death of their daughter-in-law Viscountess Amberley in 1874 and their son Viscount Amberley in 1876, Earl Russell and Countess Russell brought up their orphaned grandchildren, John (&quot;Frank&quot;) Russell, who became 2nd Earl Russell on his grandfather&#x27;s death, and Bertrand Russell who would go on to become a noted philosopher and who in later life recalled his elderly grandfather as &quot;a kindly old man in a wheelchair.&quot;

Earl Russell died at home at Pembroke Lodge on 28 May 1878. The Prime Minister, the Earl of Beaconsfield, offered a public funeral and burial at Westminster Abbey for Russell but this was declined by Countess Russell in accordance with her late husband&#x27;s wish to be buried among his family and ancestors. He is buried at the &#x27;Bedford Chapel&#x27; at St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Chenies, Buckinghamshire.

== Legacy and reputation ==
Scion of one of the most powerful aristocratic families, Russell was a leading reformer who weakened the power of the aristocracy. His great achievements, wrote A. J. P. Taylor, were based on his persistent battles in Parliament over the years on behalf of the expansion of liberty; after each loss he tried again and again, until finally, his efforts were largely successful. E. L. Woodward, however, argued that he was too much the abstract theorist:

 Nevertheless, Russell led his Whig party into support for reform; he was the principal architect of the Reform Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 45).

He was succeeded as Liberal leader by former Peelite William Gladstone, and was thus the last true Whig to serve as prime minister. Generally taken as the model for Anthony Trollope&#x27;s Mr. Mildmay, aspects of his character may also have suggested those of Plantagenet Palliser. An ideal statesman, said Trollope, should have &quot;unblemished, unextinguishable, inexhaustible love of country... But he should also be scrupulous, and, as being scrupulous, weak.&quot;

The Reform Act 1832 and extension of the franchise to British cities are partly attributed to his efforts. He also worked for emancipation, leading the attack on the Test and Corporation acts, which were repealed in 1828, as well as towards legislation limiting working hours in factories in the Factories Act 1847, and the Public Health Act 1848 (11 &amp; 12 Vict. c. 63).

His government&#x27;s approach to dealing with the Great Irish Famine is now widely condemned as counterproductive, ill-informed and disastrous. Russell himself was sympathetic to the plight of the Irish poor, and many of his relief proposals were blocked by his cabinet or by the British Parliament.

Queen Victoria&#x27;s attitude toward Russell was coloured by his role in the Aberdeen administration. On his death in 1878 her journal records that he was &quot;a man of much talent, who leaves a name behind him, kind, &amp; good, with a great knowledge of the constitution, who behaved very well, on many trying occasions; but he was impulsive, very selfish (as shown on many occasions, especially during Ld Aberdeen&#x27;s administration) vain, &amp; often reckless &amp; imprudent.&quot;

A public house in Bloomsbury, large parts of which are still owned by the Bedford Estate, is named after Russell, located on Marchmont Street.

Earl Russell Street is named after him in Aylestone, a suburb of Leicester.

Russell Road in Merton Park, a suburb of London, is named after him, adjacent to Derby, Gladstone, Palmerston and Pelham Roads, all named after former Prime Ministers.

The town of Russell in the Northland Region of New Zealand, was named in honour of him as the then Secretary of State for the Colonies.

== Literature ==

===Original works===

Russell published numerous books and essays over the course of his life, especially during periods out of office. He principally wrote on politics and history, but also turned his hand to a variety of other topics and genres. His published works include:

* &quot;The Life of William Lord Russell&quot; (1819) – a biography of his famous ancestor.

* &quot;The Nun of Arrouca: a Tale&quot; (1822) – a romantic novel set in Portugal during the Peninsular War.
* &quot;Don Carlos: or, Persecution. A tragedy, in five acts&quot; (1822) – a blank verse play on the same subject as the play of the same title by Friedrich Schiller.

* &quot;Essays on the Rise and Progress of the Christian Religion in the West of Europe, from the reign of Tiberius to the Council of Trent&quot; (1871)
* &quot;The Foreign Policy of England 1570-1870, An Historical Essay&quot; (1871)
* &quot;Recollections and Suggestions 1813-1873&quot; (1875) – Russell&#x27;s political memoir.

===As editor===

* &quot;Correspondence of John, Fourth Duke of Bedford&quot; – in three volumes, published between 1842 and 1846.
*&quot;Memoirs, Journal, and Correspondence of Thomas Moore&quot; – in eight volumes, published between 1853 and 1856. Russell was Moore&#x27;s literary executor and published his papers in accordance with his late friend&#x27;s wishes.
*&quot;Memorials and correspondence of Charles James Fox&quot; – in four volumes, published between 1853 and 1857.

===Dedications===

&quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; by Charles Dickens was dedicated to Lord John Russell, &quot;In remembrance of many public services and private kindnesses.&quot; In speech given in 1869, Dickens remarked of Russell that &quot;there is no man in England whom I respect more in his public capacity, whom I love more in his private capacity.&quot;

<text>Decebalus (; ; ), sometimes referred to as Diurpaneus, was the last Dacian king. He is famous for fighting three wars, with varying success, against the Roman Empire under two emperors. After raiding south across the Danube, he defeated a Roman invasion in the reign of Domitian, securing a period of independence during which Decebalus consolidated his rule.

When Trajan came to power, his armies invaded Dacia to weaken its threat to the Roman border territories of Moesia. Decebalus was defeated in 102 AD, and his own sister was abducted within this timeframe and forcibly wed into Roman nobility, causing some historians to infer that she was the ancestress of the usurper, Regalianus, who claimed to be a kinsman of Decebalus. He remained in power as a client king, but continued to assert his independence, leading to a final and overwhelming Roman invasion north of the Danube in 105 AD. Trajan reduced the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa to ruins in 106 AD, absorbing some of Dacia into the Empire. Decebalus died by suicide to avoid capture.

== Early life ==
After the death of Great King Burebista, Dacia split into four, then five smaller kingdoms. Nothing is known about Decebalus&#x27; youth or background. Decebalus appears to have risen to prominence in the court of the Dacian king Duras, who claimed authority over all Dacian territory. An ancient Dacian pot bearing the words “Decebalus per Scorilo” led to the suggestion that this might mean &quot;Decebalus son of Scorilo&quot;. 


According to Lucian Boia this suggestion was originally a &quot;scholarly joke&quot;, but the theory has been considered plausible by several writers. It has been suggested that &quot;Scorilo&quot; may be identical to the &quot;Coryllus&quot; or &quot;Scorillus&quot; identified by Jordanes as a Dacian king prior to Duras. Duras may have been Decebalus&#x27; uncle, having taken over the throne by agnatic right on his brother&#x27;s death.

In 85 AD the Dacian army began minor raids upon the heavily fortified Roman province of Moesia, located south of the Danube. In 86 King Duras ordered a more vigorous attack south into Moesia. Roman sources refer to the attack being led by &quot;Diurpaneus&quot; (or &quot;Dorpaneus&quot;). Many authors have taken this person to be Duras himself, and refer to him as &quot;Duras-Diurpaneus&quot;. Other scholars argue that Duras and Diurpaneus are different individuals, or that Diurpaneus is identical to Decebalus. Recent sources take the view that &quot;Diurpaneus&quot; is most likely Decebalus.

The Dacians defeated and killed Oppius Sabinus, the governor of Moesia, forcing Domitian to deploy more troops to the area. Marcus Cornelius Nigrinus replaced Sabinus. Domitian took command to deal with the problem himself, arriving with his general, prefect of the Praetorian Guards, Cornelius Fuscus.

== War against Emperor Domitian ==

Domitian pushed back the Dacians from Moesia, then returned to Rome to celebrate a Triumph, leaving Fuscus in charge of the army. Fuscus advanced into Dacia, but his four or five legions suffered a major defeat when ambushed by the forces of Decebalus (the sources say &quot;Diurpaneus&quot; was in command, which might mean Decebalus or Duras). Two Roman legions (among which was the V &quot;Alaudae&quot;) were ambushed and defeated at a mountain pass the Romans called Tapae (widely known as the Iron Gates of Transylvania). Fuscus was killed, and Decebalus was crowned king after the ageing Duras abdicated.

Dio Cassius described Decebalus as follows:
Fuscus was replaced by Tettius Julianus. In 88 Julianus commanded another Roman army under Domitian against the Dacians, defeating them in a battle near Tapae. However, elsewhere in Europe, Domitian was having to deal with revolts along the Rhine, and suffered heavy defeats at the hands of the Marcomanni, and Sarmatian tribes in the east, notably the Iazyges. Needing the troops in Moesia, Domitian agreed to peace terms with Decebalus. He agreed to pay large sums (eight million sesterces) in annual tribute to the Dacians for maintaining peace. Decebalus sent his brother Diegis to Rome to accept a diadem from the Emperor, officially recognising Decebalus&#x27;s royal status.

==Consolidation of power==
Decebalus&#x27; victory greatly increased his prestige. He proceeded to centralize power and build up his fortifications and war machines, using engineers supplied by Domitian. Decebalus&#x27;s court also became a haven for malcontents and deserters from the Roman empire becoming &quot;the nucleus for anti-Roman sentiment&quot; in the words of historian Julian Bennett. He also sought to build alliances with independent tribes, notably the Getic Bastarnae and the Sarmatian Roxolani. He failed to secure the support of the Quadi, Marcomanni and Jazyges, but ensured that they would not interfere with his plans. 
==Conflicts with Trajan==
===First Dacian war===
When Trajan came to power in 98, he immediately toured the Danube area and ordered the strengthening of fortifications along the Dacian frontier. Three years later, Trajan decided to launch an offensive against Dacia. According to Cassius Dio this was because &quot;he had taken stock of [their] previous record, resented the annual sums of money they were getting, and saw that their powers and their pride were on the increase.&quot; Trajan&#x27;s force crossed the Danube in 101 and advanced into Dacia, pushing back Dacian forces. According to Dio, Decebalus sent envoys asking for negotiations, but Trajan refused a personal meeting.

At the Second Battle of Tapae, Decebalus was defeated, but he inflicted serious losses on the Romans. Trajan chose not to pursue the war until the spring. Decebalus tried to wrongfoot Trajan by launching a surprise attack on Moesia, but he suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Adamclisi. Despite stiff resistance, the Romans closed on the Dacian capital by early 102. Decebalus was forced to concede defeat and accept Trajan&#x27;s terms, which included the loss of some territories in the vicinity of the Danube and the dismantling of his fortresses. However, Decebalus retained his throne.

=== Second Dacian war ===

Decebalus had no intention of remaining subject to Rome, or giving up his lost territory. As soon as he was able to, he took revenge on those who had supported Rome. He annexed territory from the Jazyges and violated the peace treaty by re-arming and receiving refugees and deserters from Roman territory. He also restored his fortifications. This time, Decebalus did not wait for Trajan to strike. In 105 he authorised a direct attack on the newly occupied Roman territory, probably the fortress at Banat. The attack seems to have taken Trajan and the Senate by surprise. Trajan immediately travelled north to review fortifications.

Meanwhile, Decebalus continued to disrupt Roman positions with guerrilla attacks. He also developed a plan to assassinate Trajan by using Roman auxiliaries who had defected to the Dacians to infiltrate the emperor&#x27;s camp. The plot failed. However he succeeded in capturing one of Trajan&#x27;s senior officers, Pompeius Longinus, whom he tried to use as a hostage to bargain with Trajan. Longinus took poison to avoid being so used.

Trajan, meanwhile, was building a large force for a full-scale invasion. Decebalus tried to negotiate a peace settlement, but Trajan demanded that Decebalus surrender himself, which he refused to do. Decebalus&#x27; allies among the surrounding tribes seem to have deserted him at this point. Trajan launched a direct attack on the Dacian capital, Sarmizegetusa. After a long siege of Sarmizegetusa and a few skirmishes in the nearby region, the Romans conquered the Dacian capital. Decebalus managed to escape with his family. He and his remaining supporters continued a guerrilla campaign in the Carpathian mountains. 
=== Death ===

Decebalus was hunted down and finally cornered by Roman detachments seeking his head. Rather than being captured only to be exhibited and humiliated at Rome, Decebalus committed suicide by slashing his own throat, as depicted on Trajan&#x27;s Column (spiral 22, panel b).

It is likely that he killed himself as a Roman cavalry scout named Tiberius Claudius Maximus from Legio VII Claudia was approaching. He was probably still alive when Maximus reached him, as is claimed on Maximus&#x27; funerary stele discovered at Gramini in Greece. Maximus is presumably the figure seen on Trajan&#x27;s column reaching out to Decebalus from his horse.

Decebalus&#x27; head and right hand were then taken to Trajan in &quot;Ranisstorum&quot; (an unidentified Dacian village, perhaps Piatra Craivii) by Maximus, who was decorated by the emperor. The trophy was sent to Rome where it was thrown down the Gemonian stairs. Tiberius Claudius Maximus&#x27; tomb cites two occasions where the legionary was decorated for his part in the Dacian wars, one of which being the acquisition of Decebalus&#x27; head.

== Romanian national hero ==
Decebalus is considered a national hero in Romania, and has been portrayed in numerous literary works, movies, public sculptures, and other memorials.

Decebalus began to be seen in these terms during the 19th century, when he came to be associated with Romantic ideals of national freedom and resistance to imperialism. Romanian politician Mihail Kogălniceanu gave a speech in 1843 in which he called Decebalus &quot;the greatest barbarian king of all time, more worthy to be on the throne of Rome than the rascally descendants of Augustus!&quot;

Alecu Russo compared him to the medieval hero Stephen the Great, saying &quot;The one and the other both had the same aim, the same sublime idea: the independence of their country! Both are heroes, but Stephen is a more local hero, a Moldavian hero, while Decebalus is the hero of the world.&quot; Mihai Eminescu, the Romanian national poet, wrote the historical drama &quot;Decebalus&quot;. George Coșbuc&#x27;s 1896 poem &quot; Decebal către popor&quot; (Decebalus to his People) lauds the Dacian leader&#x27;s scorn of death.

Decebalus is often paired with his enemy Trajan, with the former representing national identity and the latter the grandeur and classical values brought by Rome. Decebalus and Trajan were depicted as a pair on many Romanian banknotes.

Decebalus and Trajan were regularly invoked at the coronation of new rulers. Both featured significantly in the imagery of Ferdinand I of Romania and his wife Marie of Romania. The Romanian poet Aron Cotruș wrote a long poem &quot;Maria Doamna&quot; (&quot;Lady Marie&quot;) after Marie&#x27;s death, invoking both Decebalus and Trajan as admirers of Marie. The Dacian king, along with the Roman emperor who conquered Dacia are sometimes invoked as the fathers of the Romanian nation.

He remained a hero in the Communist era, especially in the Stalinist &quot;national Communism&quot; of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. According to Lavinia Stan and Lucian Turcescu, &quot;In a process paralleling the way modern Serbs perceive the defeat by the Ottomans in the Battle of Kosovo of 1389, Decebal&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Trajan in 101–107 CE and the resulting population mix were reclaimed as the cornerstones of Romanian ethnic identity&quot;. The nationalist model progressed further under Nicolae Ceaușescu, under whom Decebalus was listed as one of the ten great leaders of Romania.

He was depicted as a great national leader in two major epic films in this period, &quot;The Dacians&quot; (1967, directed by Sergiu Nicolaescu), and &quot;The Column&quot; (1968, directed by Mircea Drăgan). In both films he was portrayed by Amza Pellea. Several public statues of Decebalus were also set up in the Ceaușescu era, including an equestrian statue in Deva created in 1978 by the sculptor Ion Jalea, and a column topped by a bust in Drobeta-Turnu Severin, created in 1972.

He was central to the nationalist protochronism movement, which identifies Romania as the cradle of east-European civilisation, and the Dacianism movement, which directly relates Romania as descendants of the Dacians. During the 1990s, a team of sculptors carved a 40-metre-tall rock sculpture of Decebalus from a stone outcrop overlooking the Danube near the city of Orșova, Romania. It was devised and funded by Iosif Constantin Drăgan, a supporter of the protochronist and Dacianist movement. He is quoted saying, &quot;Anyone travelling towards &#x27;Decebal Rex Dragan Fecit&#x27; [King Decebalus made by Dragan] is also travelling towards the origins of east-European civilization and will discover that a United Europe represents the natural course of history&quot;.

<doc id="167866" wikidata="Q102648" url="?curid=167866" title="Wilhelm Steinitz">
<text>William Steinitz (born Wilhelm Steinitz; May 14, 1836 – August 12, 1900) was a Bohemian-Austrian, and later American, chess player. From 1886 to 1894, he was the first World Chess Champion. He was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician.

When discussing chess history from the 1850s onwards, commentators have debated whether Steinitz could be effectively considered the champion from an earlier time, perhaps as early as 1866. Steinitz lost his title to Emanuel Lasker in 1894, and lost a rematch in 1896–97.

Statistical rating systems give Steinitz a rather low ranking among world champions, mainly because he took several long breaks from competitive play. However, an analysis based on one of these rating systems shows that he was one of the most dominant players in the history of the game. Steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years, from 1862 to 1894.

Although Steinitz became &quot;world number one&quot; by winning in the all-out attacking style that was common in the 1860s, he unveiled in 1873 a new style of play, and demonstrated that it was superior to the previous style. His new style was controversial and some even branded it as &quot;cowardly&quot;, but many of Steinitz&#x27;s games showed that it could also set up attacks as ferocious as those of the old school.

Steinitz was also a prolific writer on chess, and defended his new ideas vigorously. The debate was so bitter and sometimes abusive that it became known as the &quot;Ink War&quot;. By the early 1890s, Steinitz&#x27;s approach was widely accepted, and the next generation of top players acknowledged their debt to him, most notably his successor as world champion, Emanuel Lasker.

Traditional accounts of Steinitz&#x27;s character depict him as ill-tempered and aggressive, but more recent research shows that he had long and friendly relationships with some players and chess organizations. Most notably from 1888 to 1889 he co-operated with the American Chess Congress in a project to define rules governing the conduct of future world championships. Steinitz was unskilled at managing money, and lived in poverty all his life.

==Early life==
Steinitz was born on May 14, 1836, in the Jewish ghetto of Prague (now capital of the Czech Republic; then in Bohemia, a part of the Austrian Empire). The youngest of tailor Josef-Salomon Steinitz&#x27;s thirteen sons by his first wife, he learned to play chess at age 12. After studying Talmud in his youth, he began playing serious chess in his twenties, after leaving Prague in 1857 to study mathematics at the Vienna Polytechnic. Steinitz spent two years at the university.

==Chess career (through 1881)==
Steinitz improved rapidly in chess during the late 1850s, progressing from third place in the 1859 Vienna City championship to first in 1861, with a score of 30/31. During this period he was nicknamed &quot;the Austrian Morphy&quot;. This achievement meant that he had become the strongest player in Austria.

===International debut===
Steinitz was then sent to represent Austria in the London 1862 chess tournament. He placed sixth, but his win over Augustus Mongredien was awarded the tournament&#x27;s brilliancy prize. He immediately challenged the fifth-placed contestant, the strong veteran Italian Master Serafino Dubois, to a match, which Steinitz won (five wins, one draw, three losses). This encouraged him to turn professional, and he took up residence in London. In 1862–63 Steinitz scored a crushing win in a match with Joseph Henry Blackburne, who went on to be one of the world&#x27;s top ten for 20 years, but who had only started playing chess two years earlier. Steinitz then beat some leading UK players in matches: Frederick Deacon and the aforementioned Mongredien in 1863 followed by Valentine Green in 1864. This charge up the rankings had a price: in March 1863 Steinitz apologized in a letter to Ignác Kolisch for not repaying a loan, because while Steinitz had been beating Blackburne, Daniel Harrwitz had &quot;taken over&quot; all of Steinitz&#x27;s clients at the London Chess Club, who had provided Steinitz&#x27;s main source of income.

===Match against Anderssen===

These successes established Steinitz as one of the world&#x27;s top players, and he was able to arrange a match in 1866 in London against Adolf Anderssen, who was regarded as the world&#x27;s strongest active player because he had won the 1851 and 1862 London International Tournaments and his one superior, Paul Morphy, had retired from competitive chess. Steinitz won with eight wins and six losses (there were no draws), but it was a hard fight; after 12 games the scores were level at 6–6, then Steinitz won the last two games.

As a result of this match victory, Steinitz was generally regarded as the world&#x27;s best player. The prize money for this match was £100 to the winner (Steinitz) and £20 for the loser (Anderssen). The winner&#x27;s prize was a large sum by the standards of the times, equivalent to about £57,500 in 2007&#x27;s money.

===Continued match play success===
In the years following his victory over Anderssen, Steinitz beat Henry Bird in 1866 (seven wins, five losses, five draws). He also comfortably beat Johannes Zukertort in 1872 (seven wins, four draws, one loss; Zukertort had proved himself one of the elite by beating Anderssen by a large margin in 1871).

===Gradually improves tournament results===
It took longer for Steinitz to reach the top in tournament play. In the next few years he took: third place at Paris 1867 behind Ignatz Kolisch and Simon Winawer; and second place at Dundee (1867; Gustav Neumann won), and Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament; behind Anderssen but ahead of Blackburne, Louis Paulsen and other strong players. His first victory in a strong tournament was London 1872, ahead of Blackburne and Zukertort; and the first tournament in which Steinitz finished ahead of Anderssen was the Vienna 1873 chess tournament, when Anderssen was 55 years old.

===Changes style, introduces positional school===
All of Steinitz&#x27;s successes up to 1872 were achieved in the attack-at-all-costs &quot;Romantic&quot; style exemplified by Anderssen. But in the Vienna 1873 chess tournament, Steinitz unveiled a new &quot;positional&quot; style of play which was to become the basis of modern chess. He tied for first place with Blackburne, ahead of Anderssen, Samuel Rosenthal, Paulsen and Henry Bird, and won the play-off against Blackburne. Steinitz made a shaky start, but won his last 14 games in the main tournament (including 2–0 results over Paulsen, Anderssen, and Blackburne) plus the two play-off games – this was the start of a 25-game winning streak in serious competition.

===Hiatus from competitive chess===
Between 1873 and 1882 Steinitz played no tournaments and only one match (a 7–0 win against Blackburne in 1876). His other games during this period were in simultaneous and blindfold exhibitions, which contributed an important part of a professional chess-player&#x27;s income in those days (for example in 1887 Blackburne was paid 9 guineas for two simultaneous exhibitions and a blindfold exhibition hosted by the Teesside Chess Association; this was equivalent to about £4,800 at 2007 values).

====Chess journalist====
Instead, Steinitz concentrated on his work as a chess journalist, notably for &quot;The Field&quot;, which was Britain&#x27;s leading sports magazine. Some of Steinitz&#x27;s commentaries aroused heated debates, notably from Zukertort and Leopold Hoffer in &quot;The Chess Monthly&quot; (which they founded in 1879). This &quot;Ink War&quot; escalated sharply in 1881, when Steinitz mercilessly criticized Hoffer&#x27;s annotations of games in the 1881 Berlin Congress (won by Blackburne ahead of Zukertort). Steinitz was eager to settle the analytical debates by a second match against Zukertort, whose unwillingness to play provoked scornful comments from Steinitz. In mid-1882 James Mason, a consistently strong player, challenged Steinitz to a match, and accused Steinitz of cowardice when Steinitz insisted the issue with Zukertort should be settled first. Steinitz responded by inviting Mason to name a sufficiently high stake for a match, at least £150 per player (), but Mason was unwilling to stake more than £100. Mason later agreed to play a match with Zukertort for a stake of £100 per player, but soon &quot;postponed&quot; that match, writing that &quot;circumstances having arisen that make it highly inconvenient for me to proceed ...&quot;

====Rivalry with Zukertort====
Steinitz&#x27;s long lay-off caused some commentators to suggest that Zukertort, who had scored some notable tournament victories, should be regarded as the world chess champion. As an example, The &quot;Chess Player&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; in July 1883 opined that &#x27;Steinitz was, at one time, fairly entitled to the position of champion...He has just taken an inferior place to Zukertort, in a tournament, and for the time being Zukertort, in the opinion of some, becomes champion&#x27;. Zukertort, the son of Jewish converts to Protestantism who missionized among Polish Jews, told Steinitz: &quot;You are not a chessplayer, but a Jew&quot;.

==Comeback success==
Steinitz returned to serious competitive chess in the Vienna 1882 chess tournament, which has been described as the strongest chess tournament of all time at that point. Despite a shaky start he took equal first place with Szymon Winawer, ahead of James Mason, Zukertort, George Henry Mackenzie, Blackburne, Berthold Englisch, Paulsen and Mikhail Chigorin, and drew the play-off match.

===Visits the United States===
Steinitz visited the United States, mainly the Philadelphia area, from December 1882 to May 1883. He was given an enthusiastic reception. Steinitz played several exhibitions, many casual games, and a match for stakes of £50 with a wealthy amateur. He also won three more serious matches with two New World professionals, Alexander Sellman (Steinitz won both) and the Cuban champion Celso Golmayo Zúpide. The match with Golmayo was abandoned when Steinitz was leading (eight wins, one draw, one loss). His hosts even arranged a visit to New Orleans, where Paul Morphy lived.

===Return to London===
Later in 1883, Steinitz took second place in the extremely strong London 1883 chess tournament behind Zukertort, who made a brilliant start, faded at the end but finished three points ahead. Steinitz finished 2½ points ahead of the third-placed competitor, Blackburne. Zukertort&#x27;s victory again led some commentators to suggest that Zukertort should be regarded as the world chess champion, while others said the issue could only be resolved by a match between Steinitz and Zukertort.

===Settles in United States===
In 1883, shortly after the London tournament, Steinitz decided to leave England and moved to New York City, where he lived for the rest of his life. This did not end the &quot;Ink War&quot;: his enemies persuaded some of the American press to publish anti-Steinitz articles, and in 1885 Steinitz founded the &quot;International Chess Magazine&quot;, which he edited until 1895. In his magazine he chronicled the lengthy negotiations for a match with Zukertort. He also managed to find supporters in other sections of the American press including &quot;Turf, Field and Farm&quot; and the St. Louis &quot;Globe-Democrat&quot;, both of which reported Steinitz&#x27;s offer to forgo all fees, expenses or share in the stake and make the match &quot;a benefit performance, solely for Mr Zukertort&#x27;s pecuniary profit&quot;.

===World Championship match===

Eventually it was agreed that in 1886 Steinitz and Zukertort would play a match in New York, St. Louis and New Orleans, and that the victor would be the player who first won 10 games. At Steinitz&#x27;s insistence the contract said it would be &quot;for the Championship of the World&quot;. After the five games played in New York, Zukertort led by 4–1, but in the end Steinitz won decisively by 12½–7½ (ten wins, five draws, five losses), becoming the first official world champion on March 29. The collapse by Zukertort, who won only one of the last 15 games, has been described as &quot;perhaps the most thoroughgoing reversal of fortune in the history of world championship play.&quot;

Though not yet officially an American citizen, Steinitz wanted the United States flag to be placed next to him during the match. He became a US citizen on November 23, 1888, having resided for five years in New York, and changed his first name from Wilhelm to William.

In 1887 the American Chess Congress started work on drawing up regulations for the future conduct of world championship contests. Steinitz actively supported this endeavor, as he thought he was becoming too old to remain world champion – he wrote in his own magazine &quot;I know I am not fit to be the champion, and I am not likely to bear that title for ever&quot;.

===Defeats Chigorin===

In 1888 the Havana Chess Club offered to sponsor a match between Steinitz and whomever he would select as a worthy opponent. Steinitz nominated the Russian Mikhail Chigorin, on the condition that the invitation should not be presented as a challenge from him. There is some doubt about whether this was intended to be a match for the world championship: both Steinitz&#x27;s letters and the publicity material just before the match conspicuously avoided the phrase. The proposed match was to have a maximum of 20 games, and Steinitz had said that fixed-length matches were unsuitable for world championship contests because the first player to take the lead could then play for draws; and Steinitz was at the same time supporting the American Chess Congress&#x27;s world championship project. Whatever the status of the match, it was played in Havana in January to February 1889, and won by Steinitz (ten wins, one draw, six losses).

====New York 1889 tournament====
The American Chess Congress&#x27;s final proposal was that the winner of a tournament to be held in New York in 1889 should be regarded as world champion for the time being, but must be prepared to face a challenge from the second or third placed competitor within a month. Steinitz wrote that he would not play in the tournament and would not challenge the winner unless the second and third placed competitors failed to do so. The tournament was duly played, but the outcome was not quite as planned: Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place; their play-off resulted in four draws, and Weiss then wanted to get back to his work for the Rothschild Bank, conceding the title to Chigorin. However, the third prize-winner Isidor Gunsberg was prepared to play for the title.

A Steinitz–Gunsberg match was played in New York in 1890 and ended in a 10½–8½ victory for Steinitz. The American Chess Congress&#x27;s experiment was not repeated, and Steinitz&#x27;s last three matches were private arrangements between the players.

===Wins rematch against Chigorin===

In 1891 the Saint Petersburg Chess Society and the Havana Chess Club offered to organize another Steinitz–Chigorin match for the world championship. Steinitz played against Chigorin in Havana in 1892, and won narrowly (ten wins, five draws, eight losses).

German Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch turned down an opportunity in 1892 to challenge Steinitz in a world championship match, because of the demands of his medical practice.

===Loses title to Lasker===


Around this time Steinitz publicly spoke of retiring, but changed his mind when Emanuel Lasker, 32 years younger and comparatively untested at the top level, challenged him. Lasker had been earlier that year refused a non-title challenge by fellow German, Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch, who was at the time the world&#x27;s most dominant tournament player.

Initially, Lasker wanted to play for $5,000 a side, and a match was agreed at stakes of $3,000 a side, but Steinitz agreed to a series of reductions when Lasker found it difficult to raise the money, and the final figure was $2,000 each, which was less than for some of Steinitz&#x27;s earlier matches (the final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth about $114,000 at 2016 values). Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz&#x27;s part, Steinitz may have desperately needed the money.

The match was played in 1894, at venues in New York, Philadelphia and Montreal, Canada. The 32-year age difference between the combatants was the largest in the history of world championship play, and remains so today. Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt, so it came as a shock when Lasker won the first game. Steinitz responded by winning the second, and was able to maintain the balance until the sixth. However, Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the 11th, and Steinitz asked for a one-week rest. When the match resumed, Steinitz looked in better shape and won the 13th and 14th games. Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th, and Steinitz was unable to compensate for his losses in the middle of the match. Hence Lasker won with ten wins, five losses and four draws. Some commentators thought Steinitz&#x27;s habit of playing &quot;experimental&quot; moves in serious competition was a major factor in his downfall.

====Increased tournament activity====
After losing the title, Steinitz played in tournaments more frequently than he had previously. He won at New York City 1894, and was fifth at Hastings 1895 (winning the first brilliancy prize for his game with Curt von Bardeleben). At Saint Petersburg 1895, a super-strong four player, multi-round-robin event, with Lasker, Chigorin and Pillsbury, he took second place behind Lasker. Later his results began to decline: 6th in Nuremberg 1896, 5th in Cologne 1898, 10th in London 1899.

In early 1896, Steinitz defeated the Russian Emanuel Schiffers in a match (winning 6 games, drawing 1, losing 4).

====Rematch with Lasker====
In November, 1896 to January, 1897 Steinitz played a return match with Lasker in Moscow, but won only 2 games, drawing 5, and losing 10. This was the last world chess championship match for eleven years. Shortly after the match, Steinitz had a mental breakdown and was confined for 40 days in a Moscow sanatorium, where he played chess with the inmates.

==Controversy on the beginning of Steinitz&#x27;s success==

There is a long-running debate among chess writers about whether Steinitz&#x27;s reign as World Chess Champion began in 1866, when he beat Anderssen, or in 1886, when he beat Zukertort. In April 1894 the &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot; described Steinitz as holding &quot;the chess championship of the world for 28 years&quot;. However, there is no evidence that he claimed the title for himself in 1866, although in the 1880s he claimed to have been the champion since his win over Anderssen. It has been suggested that Steinitz could not make such a claim while Paul Morphy was alive. Morphy had defeated Anderssen by a far wider margin, 8–3, in 1858, but retired from chess competition soon after he returned to the US in 1859, and died in 1884. The 1886 Steinitz vs. Zukertort match was the first that was explicitly described as being for the World Championship, but Howard Staunton and Paul Morphy had been unofficially described as &quot;World Chess Champion&quot; around the middle of the 19th century. In fact one of the organizers of the 1851 London International tournament had said the contest was for &quot;the baton of the World&#x27;s Chess Champion&quot;, and in mid-1840s Ludwig Bledow wrote a letter to Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa suggesting they should organize a world championship tournament in Germany. Some commentators described Steinitz as &quot;the champion&quot; in the years following his 1872 match victory against Zukertort. In the late 1870s and early 1880s some regarded Steinitz as the champion and others supported Johannes Zukertort, and the 1886 match was not regarded as creating the title of World Champion, but as resolving conflicting claims to the title. On the other hand George Alcock MacDonnell hailed Joseph Blackburne as &quot;World Champion&quot; for his win in the 1881 Berlin Tournament, George Henry Mackenzie as having &quot;won the Chess Championship of the World&quot; in 1887, and Isidore Gunsberg as &quot;among the champions of the world&quot; following his win at &quot;Bradford Place&quot; in 1888. However, Steinitz regarded G.A. MacDonnell as &quot;one of my bitterest and most untruthful persecutors&quot;.

==Personal life==
Steinitz lived with Caroline Golder (born 1846) in the 1860s, and their only daughter Flora was born in 1866. Flora died in 1888 at the age of 21, and Caroline died in 1892. He married his second wife a few years later, and had two children by her. In 1897 he dedicated a pamphlet to the memory of his first wife and their daughter.

In February 1897, &quot;The New York Times&quot; prematurely reported his death in a New York mental asylum. Some authors claim that he contracted syphilis, which may have been a cause of the mental breakdowns he suffered in his last years. In the months prior to his death, he spent some time in institutions as a result of his failing mental health. Before his confinement, Steinitz had been attempting to publish an essay calling for the emancipation of Austrian Jews, and Steinitz himself attributed his symptoms entirely to mental fatigue. His chess activities had not yielded any great financial rewards, and he died a pauper in the Manhattan State Hospital (Wards Island) on August 12, 1900, of a heart attack. Steinitz is buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York. His second wife and their two young children were still alive at the time of his death.
==Assessment==

The book of the Hastings 1895 chess tournament, written collectively by the players, described Steinitz as follows:
Mr. Steinitz stands high as a theoretician and as a writer; he has a powerful pen, and when he chooses can use expressive English. He evidently strives to be fair to friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he is much like many others in this respect. Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.

===Influence on the game===
Steinitz&#x27;s play up to and including 1872 was similar to that of his contemporaries: sharp, aggressive, and full of sacrificial play. This was the style in which he became &quot;world number one&quot; by beating Adolf Anderssen in 1866 and confirmed his position by beating Zukertort in 1872 and winning the 1872 London International tournament (Zukertort had claimed the rank of number two by beating Anderssen in 1871).

In 1873, however, Steinitz&#x27;s play suddenly changed, giving priority to what is now called the positional elements in chess: pawn structure, space, outposts for knights, the advantage of the two bishops, etc. Although Steinitz often accepted unnecessarily difficult defensive positions in order to demonstrate the superiority of his theories, he also showed that his methods could provide a platform for crushing attacks. Steinitz&#x27;s successor as world champion, Emanuel Lasker, summed up the new style as: &quot;In the beginning of the game ignore the search for combinations, abstain from violent moves, aim for small advantages, accumulate them, and only after having attained these ends search for the combination – and then with all the power of will and intellect, because then the combination must exist, however deeply hidden.&quot;

Although Steinitz&#x27;s play changed abruptly, he said he had been thinking along such lines for some years: Some of the games which I saw Paulsen play during the London Congress of 1862 gave a still stronger start to the modification of my own opinions, which has since developed, and I began to recognize that Chess genius is not confined to the more or less deep and brilliant finishing strokes after the original balance of power and position has been overthrown, but that it also requires the exercise of still more extraordinary powers, though perhaps of a different kind to maintain that balance or respectively to disturb it at the proper time in one&#x27;s own favor.

During his nine-year layoff from tournament play (1873–1882) and later in his career, Steinitz used his chess writings to present his theories – while in the UK he wrote for &quot;The Field&quot;; in 1885 after moving to New York he founded the &quot;International Chess Magazine&quot;, of which he was the chief editor; and in 1889 he edited the book of the great New York 1889 tournament (won by Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss), in which he did not compete as the tournament was designed to produce his successor as World Champion. Many other writers found his new approach incomprehensible, boring or even cowardly; for example Adolf Anderssen said, &quot;Kolisch is a highwayman and points the pistol at your breast. Steinitz is a pick-pocket, he steals a pawn and wins a game with it.&quot;

But when he contested the first World Championship match in 1886 against Johannes Zukertort, it became evident that Steinitz was playing on another level. Although Zukertort was at least Steinitz&#x27;s equal in spectacular attacking play, Steinitz often outmaneuvered him fairly simply by the use of positional principles.

By the time of his match in 1890–91 against Gunsberg, some commentators showed an understanding of and appreciation for Steinitz&#x27;s theories. Shortly before the 1894 match with Emanuel Lasker, even the &quot;New York Times&quot;, which had earlier published attacks on his play and character, paid tribute to his playing record, the importance of his theories, and his sportsmanship in agreeing to the most difficult match of his career despite his previous intention of retiring.

By the end of his career, Steinitz was more highly esteemed as a theoretician than as a player. The comments about him in the book of the Hastings 1895 chess tournament focus on his theories and writings, and Emanuel Lasker was more explicit: &quot;He was a thinker worthy of a seat in the halls of a University. A player, as the world believed he was, he was not; his studious temperament made that impossible; and thus he was conquered by a player ...&quot;

As a result of his play and writings Steinitz, along with Paul Morphy, is considered by many chess commentators to be the founder of modern chess.
Lasker, who took the championship from Steinitz, wrote, &quot;I who vanquished him must see to it that his great achievement, his theories should find justice, and I must avenge the wrongs he suffered.&quot;
Vladimir Kramnik emphasizes Steinitz&#x27;s importance as a pioneer in the field of chess theory: &quot;Steinitz was the first to realise that chess, despite being a complicated game, obeys some common principles. ... But as often happens the first time is just a try. ... I can&#x27;t say he was the founder of a chess theory. He was an experimenter and pointed out that chess obeys laws that should be considered.&quot;

===Writings===

Steinitz was the main chess correspondent of &quot;The Field&quot; (in London) from 1873 to 1882, and used this to present his ideas about chess strategy. In 1885 he founded the &quot;International Chess Magazine&quot; in New York City and edited it until 1891. In addition to game commentaries and blow-by-blow accounts of the negotiations leading to his 1886 match with Johann Zukertort and of the American Chess Congress&#x27;s world championship project, he wrote a long series of articles about Paul Morphy, who had died in 1884. He wrote the book of the 1889 New York tournament, in which he annotated all 432 of the games, and in 1889 he published a textbook, &quot;The Modern Chess Instructor&quot;.

Steinitz also allegedly wrote a pamphlet entitled &quot;Capital, Labor, and Charity&quot; while confined at River Crest Sanitarium in New York during the final months of his life.

===Playing strength and style===

Statistical rating systems are unkind to Steinitz. &quot;Warriors of the Mind&quot; gives him a ranking of 47th, below several obscure Soviet grandmasters; Chessmetrics places him only 15th on its all-time list. Chessmetrics penalizes players who play infrequently; opportunities for competitive chess were infrequent in Steinitz&#x27;s best years, and Steinitz had a few long absences from competitive play (1873–1876, 1876–1882, 1883–1886, 1886–1889). However, in 2005, Chessmetrics&#x27; author, Jeff Sonas, wrote an article which examined various ways of comparing the strength of &quot;world number one&quot; players, using data provided by Chessmetrics, and found that: Steinitz was further ahead of his contemporaries in the 1870s than Bobby Fischer was in his peak period (1970–1972); that Steinitz had the third-highest total number of years as the world&#x27;s top player, behind Emanuel Lasker and Garry Kasparov; and that Steinitz placed 7th in a comparison of how long players were ranked in the world&#x27;s top three. Between his victory over Anderssen (1866) and his loss to Emanuel Lasker (1894), Steinitz won all his &quot;normal&quot; matches, sometimes by wide margins; and his worst tournament performance in that 28-year period was third place in Paris (1867). (He also lost two handicap matches and a match by telegraph in 1890 against Mikhail Chigorin, where Chigorin was allowed to choose the openings in both games and won both.) The Edo rating system that covers the years from 1821 to 1937 places Steinitz 3rd in top peak rating; behind Jose Capablanca and Paul Morphy but ahead of Emanuel Lasker and Alexander Alekhine.

Initially Steinitz played in the all-out attacking style of contemporaries like Anderssen, and then changed to the positional style with which he dominated competitive chess in the 1870s and 1880s. Max Euwe wrote, &quot;Steinitz aimed at positions with clear-cut features, to which his theory was best applicable.&quot; However, he retained his capacity for brilliant attacks right to the end of his career; for example, in the 1895 Hastings tournament (when he was 59), he beat von Bardeleben in a spectacular game in which in the closing stages Steinitz deliberately exposed all his pieces to attack simultaneously (except his king, of course). His most significant weaknesses were his habits of playing &quot;experimental&quot; moves and getting into unnecessarily difficult defensive positions in top-class competitive games.

===Personality===

&quot;Traditional&quot; accounts of Steinitz describe him as having a sharp tongue and violent temper, perhaps partly because of his short stature (barely five feet) and congenital lameness. He admitted that &quot;Like the Duke of Parma, I always hold the sword in one hand and the olive branch in the other&quot;, and under severe provocation he could become abusive in published articles. He was aware of his own tendencies and said early in his career, &quot;Nothing would induce me to take charge of a chess column ...Because I should be so fair in dispensing blame as well as praise that I should be sure to give offence and make enemies.&quot; When he embarked on chess journalism, his brutally frank review of Wormald&#x27;s &quot;The Chess Openings&quot; in 1875 proved him right on both counts.

His personal correspondence, his own articles and some third-party articles, however, show that he had long and friendly relationships with many people and groups in the chess world, including Ignác Kolisch (one of his earliest sponsors), Mikhail Chigorin, Harry Nelson Pillsbury, Bernhard Horwitz, Amos Burn and the Cuban and Russian chess communities. He even co-operated with the American Chess Congress in its project to regulate future contests for the world title that he had earned.

Steinitz strove to be objective in his writings about chess competitions and games; for example, he attributed to sheer bad luck a poor tournament score by Henry Edward Bird, whom he considered no friend of his, and was generous in his praise of great play by even his bitter enemies. He could poke fun at some of his own rhetoric; for example: &quot;I remarked that I would rather die in America than live in England. ... I added that I would rather lose a match in America than win one in England. But after having carefully considered the subject in all its bearings, I have come to the conclusion that I neither mean to die yet nor to lose the match.&quot; At a joint simultaneous display in Russia around the time of the 1895–96 Saint Petersburg tournament, Emanuel Lasker and Steinitz formed an impromptu comedy double act.

Although he had a strong sense of honour about repaying debts, Steinitz was poor at managing his finances: he let a competitor &quot;poach&quot; many of his clients in 1862–63, offered to play the 1886 world title match against Johannes Zukertort for free, and died in poverty in 1900, leaving his widow to survive by running a small shop.

==Notable games==
* Steinitz vs. Augustus Mongredien, London 1862. Awarded the at the 1862 London International Tournament.
* Adolf Anderssen vs. Steinitz; 13th match game, London 1866. Emanuel Lasker regarded this well-prepared attack as a precursor of the positional approach that Steinitz later advocated.
* Johannes Zukertort vs. Steinitz, WCH (9th game of the match) 1886, Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined: Vienna. Quiet Variation (D37), . Steinitz exchanges his powerful centre to create two weak hanging pawns on White&#x27;s queenside and creates strong pressure against them. Zukertort eventually tries to slug his way out of trouble, but Steinitz wins with a sharp counterattack.
* Steinitz vs. Mikhail Chigorin, Havana WCH 1892 (16th game of the match), Ruy Lopez, . Steinitz weakens Chigorin&#x27;s pawns, gains superior mobility then forces a pawn promotion with the aid of a little combination.
* Steinitz vs. Mikhail Chigorin, Havana WCH 1892 (4th game of the match), Spanish Game: General (C65), 1–0. Positional preparation creates the opportunity for a swift attack leading to mate on the 29th move.
* Steinitz vs. Curt von Bardeleben, Hastings 1895, Italian Game: Classical Variation. Greco Gambit Traditional Line (C54), 1–0. A great attacking combination in the old 1860s style. After White&#x27;s 22nd move, all the white pieces are but Black is lost. The game won the first brilliancy prize of the tournament.

<doc id="167868" wikidata="Q2134925" url="?curid=167868" title="Rebecca Gratz">
<text>Rebecca Gratz (March 4, 1781 – August 27, 1869) was a Jewish American educator and philanthropist in 19th-century America. She was a member of the Gratz family, who settled in the United States before the Revolutionary War.

==Early life==
Rebecca Gratz was born on March 4, 1781, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. She was the seventh of twelve children born to Miriam Simon and Michael Gratz. Her mother was the daughter of Joseph Simon, a preeminent Jewish merchant of Lancaster, while her father, whose surname originally was Grätz, immigrated to America in 1752 from Langendorf, in German-speaking Silesia. Michael, who was descended from a long line of respected rabbis, and Miriam were observant Jews and active members of Philadelphia&#x27;s first synagogue, Mikveh Israel.

== Philanthropy ==
In 1801, at the age of 20, Rebecca Gratz helped establish the Female Association for the Relief of Women and Children in Reduced Circumstances, which helped women whose families were suffering after the American Revolutionary War. In 1815, after seeing the need for an institution for orphans in Philadelphia, she was among those instrumental in founding the Philadelphia Orphan Asylum. Four years later, she was elected secretary of its board. She continued to hold this office for forty years. Under Gratz&#x27; auspices, a Hebrew Sunday School, the first of its kind in America, was started in 1838. Gratz became both its superintendent and president and assisted in developing its curriculum, resigning in 1864.

Gratz was also one of the founding members of the Female Hebrew Benevolent Society of Philadelphia in 1819. The social services organization was created by a group of women from Congregation Mikveh Israel to support Philadelphia&#x27;s Jewish women who found themselves unexpectedly without a husband (whether by illness, death or greener pastures). Gratz held the secretary position in the group for close to 40 years.

In 1850, she advocated in &quot;The Occident&quot;, over the signature &quot;A Daughter of Israel&quot;, the foundation of a Jewish foster home. Her advocacy was largely instrumental in the establishment of such a home in 1855. Other organizations that came about due to her efforts were the Fuel Society and the Sewing Society.

Gratz is said to have been the model of Rebecca, the daughter of the Jewish merchant Isaac of York, who is the heroine in the novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; by Sir Walter Scott. Scott&#x27;s attention had been drawn to Gratz&#x27;s character by Washington Irving, who was a close friend of the Gratz family. The claim has been disputed, but it has also been well sustained in an article entitled &quot;The Original of Rebecca in Ivanhoe&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;, 1882, pp. 679–682.

Gratz never married. Among the marriage offers she received was one from a Gentile whom she loved but ultimately chose not to marry on account of her faith.

Her portrait was painted twice by the noted American artist Thomas Sully. One of those portraits (both are owned by the Rosenbach Museum) is on display at the National Museum of American Jewish History.

== Death ==
Gratz died on August 27, 1869, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was buried at Mikveh Israel Cemetery. Shortly after her death, her brother Hyman founded and financed Gratz College, a teachers’ college in Philadelphia, in her memory.

<doc id="167872" wikidata="Q41497113" url="?curid=167872" title="Sorbonne University">
<text>Sorbonne University () is a public research university located in Paris, France. The institution&#x27;s legacy reaches back to the Middle Ages in 1257 when Sorbonne College was established by Robert de Sorbon as a constituent college of the University of Paris, one of the first universities in Europe. Its current iteration was formed in 2018 by the merger of Paris-Sorbonne University (Paris IV) and the Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris VI).

Sorbonne University is one of the most sought after universities by students and researchers from France, Europe, and the French speaking countries. Most notably, Marie Skłodowska-Curie, who came from Poland in 1891 and joined the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Paris, was also the first woman to become a professor at the Sorbonne. Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie are considered the founders of the modern-day Faculty of Science and Engineering of Sorbonne University. As of 2021, its alumni and professors have won 33 Nobel Prizes, six Fields Medals, and one Turing Award. 

==History==

=== College of Sorbonne ===

Robert de Sorbon (1201–1274), chaplain to King Louis IX (Saint Louis), observed the difficulties experienced by poor &quot;schoolchildren&quot; in achieving the rank of doctor. In February 1257, he had a house (&quot;domus&quot;) officially established which he intended for a certain number of secular clergy who, living in common and without concern for their material existence, would be entirely occupied with study and teaching. This house was named the college of Sorbonne.

The old slogan of the establishment, &quot;Sorbonne University, creators of futures since 1257&quot;, refers to this date. The college of Sorbonne was closed along with all the other colleges of the former University of Paris in 1793.

The college of Sorbonne was located on the site of the current Sorbonne building, shared between Sorbonne University and Panthéon-Sorbonne University.

=== Faculty of Humanities of Paris, &quot;the Sorbonne&quot; ===

Based at the Sorbonne, the University of Paris Faculty of Humanities (commonly known as the &quot;Sorbonne&quot; because of its location) was created by the decree of 17 March 1808 on the organisation of the Imperial University of France. 

Under the Bourbon Restoration, the faculty welcomed an average of 1,000 to 1,500 students a year, rising to 2,000 under the July Monarchy. But the number of teaching staff remained limited: between 1809 and 1878, only 51 professors taught at the Faculty of Humanities.

Following the promulgation of laws on 28 April 1893, giving civil personality to the bodies formed by the union of several faculties of an academy, and 10 July 1896, giving the name of university to the bodies of faculties, the new University of Paris was created in 1896 through the merger of the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Humanities, the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Protestant Theology (created in 1877 and transformed into a free faculty in 1905), and the &quot;École supérieure de pharmacie&quot;. It was inaugurated on 19 November 1896 by its president, Félix Faure.

=== Faculty of Sciences of Paris ===
The Faculty of Sciences in Paris was opened in 1811 following the creation of the Imperial University of France, and was housed in the &quot;Collège du Plessis&quot;, in the Latin Quarter of Paris. 

In 1826, the faculty moved to the Sorbonne. It remained there until 1962, when it moved to the Jussieu Campus. The Jussieu campus is now the main site of the Sorbonne University Faculty of Science and Engineering. At the same time, in 1927 it opened a satellite campus at Orsay, in the south of Paris, which would later become the current Paris-Saclay University, as well as a satellite campus at Orléans in 1960.

=== Splitting of the University of Paris ===
In 1971, the University of Paris, including its humanities and science faculties, split into several interdisciplinary universities. Some, including the University of Paris-Sorbonne, retained the name &quot;Sorbonne&quot; and premises in the historic centre of the University of Paris, which had until then been mainly devoted to the faculties of Humanities and Sciences.

The University of Paris-VI, later renamed as &quot;UPMC&quot;, is created from the majority of the teaching and research units of the Faculty of Sciences of Paris (the others joining the universities of Paris-VII Denis Diderot (now Université Paris Cité), Paris-Saclay University in Orsay, Paris-XII and Paris-XIII in Villetaneuse) and part of the units of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris (the others joining the universities of Paris-V René Descartes (now Université Paris Cité), Paris-VII Denis Diderot and Paris-XIII).

=== Reunification of the University of Paris-Sorbonne and UPMC ===
In 2010, some of the direct successors of the faculties of the University of Paris created the Sorbonne Universities Association. The following universities, members of the university system, decided to merge into Sorbonne University in 2018:

*Paris-Sorbonne University (Paris IV) (1971–2017), formerly a constituent part of the faculty of humanities of the University of Paris.
*Université Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC or Paris VI) (1971–2017), formerly a constituent part of the faculty of sciences and of the school of medicine of the University of Paris.

At the same time, the Sorbonne Universities Association was renamed the Sorbonne University alliance; it includes the following institutions for academic cooperation:

* University of Technology of Compiègne (1972– )
* INSEAD
* National Museum of Natural History
* &quot;Centre international d’études pédagogiques&quot; (International Centre for Pedagogical Studies)
* &quot;Pôle supérieur d’enseignement artistique Paris Boulogne-Billancourt&quot;
* Four research institutes

As part of the reforms of French Higher Education, on 19 March 2018, the international jury called by the French Government for the &quot;Initiative d&#x27;excellence&quot; (IDEX) confirmed the definite win of Sorbonne University. Consequently, Sorbonne University won an endowment of 900 Million euros with no limit of time. This is the first higher education institution in Paris region to win such an endowment. The university was established by a decree issued 21 April 2017, taking effect 1 January 2018.

== Faculties ==
Sorbonne University has three faculties: Arts and Humanities, Science and Engineering, and Health Sciences.

=== Arts and humanities ===
The Sorbonne University Faculty of Arts and Humanities provides studies in arts, languages, letters, and human and social sciences, and is the largest in France. Fields such as history, geography, languages, linguistics, musicology, philosophy, classical and modern literature, foreign literature and civilisations, and the history of art and archaeology are part of this faculty.

=== Science and engineering ===

The Sorbonne Faculty of Science and Engineering is a major research institution in France. It can be considered the successor in direct line to the Faculty of Science of the University of Paris with the Paris-Saclay Faculty of Sciences.

It has 79 laboratories in the Paris region, most in association with the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS). Some of the most notable institutes and laboratories include the Institut Henri Poincaré (Mathematics), Institut d&#x27;astrophysique de Paris (Astrophysics), LIP6 (Informatics / Computer Science), Institut des systèmes intelligents et de robotique (Robotics), Institut de mathématiques de Jussieu – Paris Rive Gauche (foundations of Mathematics, shared with University Paris Cité) and the Laboratoire Kastler-Brossel (Quantum Physics, shared with PSL University).

=== Health sciences ===
The Sorbonne University Faculty of Health Sciences, in association with the Greater Paris University Hospitals (AP-HP), manages the AP-HP Sorbonne University Hospital Group (Hôpital Charles-Foix, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Hôpital Fondation Rothschild, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, Hôpital Tenon, Hôpital Armand-Trousseau, Hôpital de La Roche-Guyon) and the Quinze-Vingts National Ophthalmology Hospital, promoting multidisciplinary research, and training doctors and other health professionals.

== Law (external tuition) ==
There is no law school as such in Sorbonne University. In 1971, most of the law professors from the Faculty of Law and Economics of the University of Paris decided to restructure it as a university, called Panthéon-Assas University Paris (after the two main campuses of the Paris Law Faculty: &quot;place du Panthéon&quot; and &quot;rue d’Assas&quot; campuses). Panthéon-Assas now provides legal studies for Sorbonne University as an independent university. 

Another law school, the Panthéon-Sorbonne University School of Law (also a spin-off of the Faculty of Law and Economics of the University of Paris) also exists in Paris, but has no connection with Sorbonne University.

== Campuses ==

=== Main campuses ===

==== Sorbonne ====
Sorbonne University&#x27;s historical campus is in the historic central Sorbonne building, located at 47 rue des Écoles, in the historic Latin Quarter university campus. The building is the undivided property of the 13 successor universities of the University of Paris, managed by the &quot;Chancellerie des Universités de Paris&quot;. Besides the monuments of the Cour d&#x27;Honneur, the Sorbonne Chapel and the &quot;Grand Amphithéâtre&quot;, the building houses the Sorbonne University Faculty of Arts and Humanities, the Academy of Paris Rectorat, the &quot;Chancellerie des Universités de Paris&quot;, and part of the universities Panthéon-Sorbonne, Sorbonne Nouvelle, Paris Cité and the &quot;École Nationale des Chartes&quot; as well as the &quot;École Pratique des Hautes Études&quot; that are constituent schools of PSL University.

Before the 19th century, the Sorbonne occupied several buildings. The chapel was built in 1622 by the then-Provisor of the University of Paris, Cardinal Richelieu, during the reign of Louis XIII. In 1881, politician Jules Ferry decided to convert the Sorbonne into one single building. Under the supervision of Pierre Greard, Chief Officer of the Education Authority of Paris, Henri-Paul Nénot constructed the current building from 1883 to 1901 that reflects a basic architectural uniformity. The integration of the chapel into the whole was also Nénot&#x27;s work with the construction of a cour d&#x27;honneur. The Sorbonne building is generally reserved for undergraduate students in their third year and graduate students in certain academic disciplines. Only students in Semitic studies, regardless of level, take all their classes at the Sorbonne campus.

The Sorbonne Library is an inter-university library of the Panthéon-Sorbonne University, Sorbonne Nouvelle University, Sorbonne University, Paris Cité University, under the administration of Panthéon-Sorbonne. It is open exclusively to undergraduate students in their third year and graduate students. With the former archives of the now-defunct University of Paris, 2,500,000 books, 400,000 of them ancient, 2,500 historical manuscripts, 18,000 doctoral dissertation papers, 17,750 past and current French and international periodicals and 7,100 historical printing plates, the Sorbonne Library is the largest university library in Paris and was entirely refurbished in 2013.

The Sorbonne University Library&#x27;s Arts and Humanities Department (French: &quot;Pôle Lettres de la Bibliothèque de Sorbonne Université&quot;), part of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, offers its students and teaching staff access to 18 libraries and thematic collections. The catalog includes 600,000 books, 350,000 e-books, 60,000 issues of online periodicals and 165 databases.

The Sorbonne University also includes the Saint-Antoine Campus for the study of medicine ; the Cordeliers Convent, Curie and Raspail campuses for sciences studies.

=== Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi ===

An exclusive international agreement between Sorbonne and the government of Abu Dhabi was signed on 19 February 2006, starting plans to bring Sorbonne University to Abu Dhabi. Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi (SUAD) was established on 30 May 2008 on Reem Island by a decree of the ruler of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates. All programs are taught in the French language except for the Bachelor of Physics and most of the masters programmes, that are taught in English . An intensive French language programme is offered for one or two-year(s) to students who do not meet the French language requirement for registration. The establishment of the university demonstrates the keenness of Abu Dhabi to create an international hub in culture and education, having also signed a contract with the Louvre in 2007 to create the Louvre Abu Dhabi, and with New York University in 2007 to create New York University Abu Dhabi. SUAD is jointly governed by the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) and by SUAD&#x27;s board of trustees, with six members, three of whom are appointed by the home Sorbonne University and the other three appointed by the Abu Dhabi Executive Council. The president of SUAD is the president of Sorbonne University in Paris, currently Prof Nathalie Drach-Temam. Academic programmes are offered at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in the social sciences, humanities, law and sciences.

=== International partnerships ===
Sorbonne students can study abroad for a semester or a year at partner institutions such as McGill University, University of Toronto, King&#x27;s College London, and University of Warwick.

==Organization==
Members have worked on several projects to strengthen the relations between them and potentially create a new international institution. The most famous projects are :

* the &quot;Sorbonne College&quot; (Collège des Licences de la Sorbonne) for bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 
* the &quot;Sorbonne Faculty of Arts and Humanities&quot;, &quot;Sorbonne Faculty of Health&quot; and the &quot;Sorbonne Faculty of Sciences&quot; for graduate students,
* and the &quot;Sorbonne Doctoral College&quot; (Collège doctoral de la Sorbonne) for PhD students.

===The Sorbonne College===
Since 2014, the Sorbonne College for bachelor&#x27;s degrees (&quot;Collège des Licences de la Sorbonne&quot;) has been coordinating the academic projects of Sorbonne University with Panthéon-Assas University, the law school of the Sorbonne University Group which has not merged into the Sorbonne University and remained independent. It also offers cross-institutional academic courses in many fields, allowing students to graduate from both institutions. For example, some cross-institutional bachelor&#x27;s degrees (&quot;double licences&quot;) are proposed to students in :
*Science and History (Sorbonne)
*Science and Musicology (Sorbonne)
*Science and Philosophy (Sorbonne)
*Science and Chinese (Sorbonne)

As it is the case in the Anglo-American university system, Sorbonne University proposes a major-minor system, that is currently being deployed at the university.

Sorbonne University, in partnership with INSEAD, also offers all of its alumni and PhD students a professionalizing course in business management to complete their curriculum.

===The Doctoral College===

Since 2010, every PhD student is being delivered an honorary diploma labeled Sorbonne University. This diploma highlights and gathers the skills of the doctors and researchers from the institutions that form Sorbonne University.

The Sorbonne Doctoral College, created in 2013, coordinates the activities of the 26 doctoral schools. Since 2014, it has developed cross-disciplinary PhDs between the different members of the Sorbonne University Association.

Since 2011, Sorbonne University celebrates its graduates in a formal ceremony where every PhD graduate wears a scholar uniform.

===Research===
To strengthen the influence of its research infrastructures at the international level, Sorbonne University has developed several research programs aiming at reinforcing or exploring new fields of study. This innovative cross-disciplinary approach was embodied with the creation of four new academic positions gathering several establishments of the group:
*A Department of Digital Humanities, exploring the use of digital technologies in the social science
*A Department of Polychromatic Studies of Societies, associating architecture, anthropology, chemical physics, literature and art history
*A Department of Digital Health, exploring biomedical tools
*A Department of 3D Craniofacial Reconstruction

Sorbonne University has formed several partnerships enabling bilateral research programswith academic institutions such as the China Scholarship Council or the Brazilian foundation FAPERJ.

Sorbonne University is a member of the League of European Research Universities, which gathers 23 European universities such as Cambridge and Oxford.

<doc id="167873" wikidata="Q7439086" url="?curid=167873" title="Screw-pile lighthouse">
<text>A screw-pile lighthouse is a lighthouse which stands on piles that are screwed into sandy or muddy sea or river bottoms. The first screw-pile lighthouse to begin construction was built by the blind Irish engineer Alexander Mitchell. Construction began in 1838 at the mouth of the Thames and was known as the Maplin Sands lighthouse, and first lit in 1841. However, though its construction began later, the Wyre Light in Fleetwood, Lancashire, was the first to be lit (in 1840).

In the United States, several screw-pile lighthouses were constructed in the Chesapeake Bay due to its estuarial soft bottom. North Carolina&#x27;s sounds and river entrances also once had many screw-pile lights. The characteristic design is a -storey hexagonal wooden building with dormers and a cupola light room.

== History ==
Non-screwpile (straightpile) tubular skeletal tower lighthouses were built, usually of cast-iron but also of wrought-iron piles, both onshore and offshore, typically on soft bottoms such as mud, sand, and swamp. Alexander Mitchell invented the screwpile, a major improvement over the standard straightpile construction type. With his son, he patented his wrought-iron screwpile design in England in 1833. The Walde Lighthouse in northern France (Pas-de-Calais), established in 1859, was based on Mitchell&#x27;s design. Although discontinued in 1998 and shorn of its lantern, it is the only remaining screwpile lighthouse in France.

=== Screw-pile lighthouses in the United States ===
The first screwpile lighthouse type built in the United States was at Brandywine Shoal, Delaware Bay, an area served by a lightship since 1823 and an ordinary straightpile lighthouse which stood briefly there in 1828 but was destroyed by ice. Major Hartman Bache, a distinguished engineer of the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, began work in 1848 and completed the task in 1850, at a construction cost of $53,317. Alexander Mitchell served as consultant. The screwpiles were turned by a 4-foot capstan worked by 30 men. To protect the structure from ice floes an ice-breaker consisting of a pier of 30 iron screwpiles 23 feet long and five inches in diameter was screwed down into the bottom and interconnected at their heads above the water reinforcing them together. Subsequently, though, the use of caisson lighthouses proved more durable in locations subject to ice.

Screwpile lighthouses were relatively inexpensive, easy to construct, and comparatively quick to build. They became especially popular after the Civil War when the Lighthouse Board adopted a policy to replace inside (bays, sounds, and rivers) light vessels with screwpile lighthouses. Most screwpile lighthouses were made with iron piles, though a few were made with wooden piles covered with metal screw sleeves (these sleeves were probably adopted because they were less expensive and easier to insert into the bottom, plus the sleeve protected the wood from marine-boring invertebrates). The typical screwpile lighthouse was hexagonal or octagonal in plan consisting of a central pile which was set first and then the six or eight perimeter piles were screwed in place around it.
Metal screwpiles were used to form the foundation of many lighthouses built on sandy or muddy bottoms. The helicoidal or screw-like cast-iron flange at the end of the metal pile was augured into the bottom increasing the bearing capacity of the pile as well as its anchoring properties. Yet lighthouses built with these foundations were found to be vulnerable to ice floes. In areas such as the Florida Keys, where the bottom is soft coral rock, diskpile foundation lighthouses were built. Wrought iron piles were driven through a cast-iron or semi-steel disk which rested on the sea floor until a shoulder on the pile prevented further penetration. The disk distributes the weight of the tower more evenly over the bottom. In coral reef areas where sand is also prevalent, a cast-steel screw was fitted to the end of the pile to give it more anchoring ability. Cofferdams were used generally in shallow waters where it was not necessary to deeply penetrate the natural bottom. The cofferdam enabled the water inside the dam to be pumped out and the foundation built &quot;in the dry&quot;.

Perhaps as many as 100 spider-like, cottage-type (1½-storey wooden dwelling) screwpile lighthouses were built throughout the Carolina sounds, Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, along the Gulf of Mexico, at least two in Long Island Sound and one even at Maumee Bay (1855), Lake Erie, Ohio. Few survive to this day; many were replaced with caisson-type lighthouses. The tall offshore skeletal tower type was built in exposed open water at major coastal sites where visibility over ten miles was required. Six offshore skeletal towers were built in Florida; three before and three after the American Civil War, as well as one in the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana prior to the Civil War.

== Surviving examples ==

* Spit Bank Lighthouse, in Cork Harbour, Ireland was built by Alexander Mitchell between 1851 and 1853 and is still in use.
* Carysfort Reef Light, four miles east of Key Largo, Florida, was built in 1852 and was the oldest screw-pile (with disk) lighthouse still in service in the United States, until it was deactivated in 2014. Screw-pile lighthouses on the reefs in Florida are tall skeletal towers, with living and working quarters set high above the reach of storm waves.
* The Seven Foot Knoll Light was built in 1856 and is the oldest screwpile lighthouse in Maryland. It was initially installed on a shallow shoal, Seven Foot Knoll, at the mouth of the Patapsco River. The northern reach of this river is the Baltimore Inner Harbor, where the now-decommissioned lighthouse has been placed as a museum.
* The Thomas Point Shoal Light is a historic lighthouse in the Chesapeake Bay and the most recognized lighthouse in Maryland.
* The Drum Point Light originally located off Drum Point at the mouth of the Patuxent River, it is now an exhibit at the Calvert Marine Museum.
* The Hooper Strait Light originally located at the entrance to Tangier Sound, it is now an exhibit at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum.
* The Roanoke River Light was built in 1886, and has been moved twice. It is the only surviving screw-pile lighthouse in North Carolina.
* Fowey Rocks Light, built in 1878, is seven miles south of Key Biscayne, Florida. , it is the last screw-pile lighthouse still in operation on the Florida Reef. 
* American Shoal Light, completed in 1880 (deactivated in 2015), is located east of the Saddlebunch Keys, in the Florida Keys.
* Built in 1885, the Middle Bay Light in Alabama&#x27;s Mobile Bay is an example of a common screw-pile lighthouse.
* Gunfleet Lighthouse off Frinton-on-Sea in Essex was constructed in 1850 but abandoned in 1921.

== Replicas ==
*Full size replica of the Stingray Point Light that once stood off Stingray Point near the mouth of the Rappahannock River, located at Stingray Point Marina in Deltaville, Virginia
*A replica of the Roanoke Marshes Light overlooks Roanoke Sound in the village of Manteo, North Carolina on Roanoke Island

<text>Joseph Jacques Omer Plante (; January 17, 1929 – February 27, 1986) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. During a career lasting from 1947 to 1975, he was considered to be one of the most important innovators in hockey. He played for the Montreal Canadiens from 1953 to 1963; during his tenure, the team won the Stanley Cup six times, including five consecutive wins. In 2017 Plante was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

Plante retired in 1965 but was persuaded to return to the National Hockey League to play for the expansion St. Louis Blues in 1968. He was later traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1970 and to the Boston Bruins in 1973. He joined the World Hockey Association as a coach and general manager for the Quebec Nordiques in 1973–74. He then played goal for the Edmonton Oilers in 1974–75, ending his professional career with that team.

Plante was the first NHL goaltender to wear a goaltender mask in regulation play on a regular and tested many versions of the mask (including the forerunner of today&#x27;s mask/helmet combination) with the assistance of other experts. Plante was the first NHL goaltender to regularly play the puck outside his crease in support of his team&#x27;s defencemen, and he often instructed his teammates from behind the play. Plante was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1978, was chosen as the goaltender of the Canadiens&#x27; &quot;dream team&quot; in 1985, and was inducted into the Quebec Sports Pantheon in 1994. The Montreal Canadiens retired Plante&#x27;s jersey, #1, the following year. Plante ranks seventh among NHL goalies for all-time career wins with 437.

==Early life==
Plante was born on a farm near Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, in Mauricie, Quebec, the first of 11 children born to Palma and Xavier Plante. The family moved to Shawinigan Falls, where his father worked in one of the local factories. In 1932, Plante began to play hockey, skateless and with a tennis ball, using a goaltender&#x27;s hockey stick his father had carved from a tree root. When he was five years old, Plante fell off a ladder and broke his hand. The fracture failed to heal properly and affected his playing style during his early hockey career; he underwent successful corrective surgery as an adult. Plante suffered from asthma starting in early childhood. This prevented him from skating for extended periods, so he gravitated to playing goaltender. As his playing progressed, Jacques received his first regulation goaltender&#x27;s stick for Christmas of 1936. His father made Plante&#x27;s first pads by stuffing potato sacks and reinforcing them with wooden panels. As a child, Plante played hockey outdoors in the bitterly cold Quebec winters. His mother taught him how to knit his own tuques to protect him from the cold. Plante continued knitting and embroidering throughout his life and wore his hand-knitted tuques while playing and practicing until entering the National Hockey League (NHL).

Plante&#x27;s first foray into organized hockey came at age 12. He was watching his school&#x27;s team practice when the coach ordered the goaltender off the ice after a heated argument over his play, and Plante asked to replace him. The coach permitted him to play since there was no other available goaltender; it was quickly apparent that Plante could hold his own, despite the other players being many years older than he was. He impressed the coach and stayed on as the team&#x27;s number-one goaltender.

Two years later, Plante was playing for five different teams — the local factory team, and teams in the midget, juvenile, junior, and intermediate categories. Plante demanded a salary from the factory team&#x27;s coach after his father told him that the other players were being paid because they were company employees. The coach paid Plante 50 cents per game to retain him and maintain the team&#x27;s popularity. Afterwards, Plante began to receive various offers from other teams; he was offered $80 per week — a considerable sum in those days — to play for a team in England, and a similar offer to play for the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League. Plante passed them up because his parents wanted him to finish high school. He graduated with top honours in 1947. Upon graduation, he took a job as a clerk in a Shawinigan factory. A few weeks later, the Quebec Citadels offered Plante $85 per week to play for them; he accepted, marking the beginning of his professional career.

In 1949, he married Jacqueline Gagné; they had two sons, Michel and Richard.

==Playing career==
===Minor leagues===

Jacques joined the Quebec Citadelles in 1947. While playing for Quebec, Plante started to play the puck outside his crease, a technique he developed when he recognized that the team&#x27;s defense was performing poorly. Fans found Plante&#x27;s unconventional playing style to be exciting, but it angered his managers, who believed that a goaltender should stay in the net and let his players recover the puck. Plante had concluded that as long as he was in control of the puck, the opponents could not shoot it at him – this is now standard practice for goaltenders. The same season, the Citadelles beat the Montreal Junior Canadiens in the league finals, with Plante being named the most valuable player on his team. The Montreal Canadiens&#x27; general manager, Frank J. Selke, became interested in acquiring Plante as a member of the team. In 1948, Plante received an invitation to the Canadiens&#x27; training camp. On August 17, 1949, Selke offered Plante a contract. Plante played for Montreal&#x27;s affiliate Royal Montreal Hockey Club, earning $4,500 for the season, and an extra $500 for practicing with the Canadiens.

In January 1953, Plante was called up to play for the Canadiens. Bill Durnan, the goaltender who played for Montreal when Plante first began, had retired, and Gerry McNeil, their top goaltender, had fractured his jaw. Plante played three games, but in that short time, he generated controversy. Coach Dick Irvin, Sr. did not wish his players to stand out by any addition to their regular uniforms. Plante always wore one of his tuques while playing hockey, and after an argument with Irvin, all of Plante&#x27;s tuques had vanished from the Montreal locker room. Even without his good luck charm, Plante gave up only four goals in the three games he played, all of them wins.

Later during the 1952–53 NHL season, Plante played in the playoffs against the Chicago Black Hawks. He won his first playoff game with a shutout. Montreal won that series and eventually, the Stanley Cup, and Plante&#x27;s name was engraved on the Cup for the first time.

At the beginning of 1953, McNeil was still the starting goaltender for the Canadiens. Selke assigned Plante to the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League so fans in the United States would get to know him. Plante was instantly successful; Fred Hunt, the general manager of the Bisons, told Kenny Reardon, Montreal&#x27;s recruiting manager, &quot;he&#x27;s [Plante] the biggest attraction since the good old days of Terry Sawchuk.&quot;

===Montreal Canadiens===
By the end of the 1953–54 season, Plante was well-entrenched within the NHL. In the spring of 1954, he underwent surgery to correct his left hand, which he had broken in his childhood. He could not move his hand well enough to catch high shots and compensated by using the rest of his body. The operation was successful.

On February 12, 1954, Plante was called up to the Canadiens and established himself as their starting goaltender – he did not return to the minor leagues for many years. Plante was the Canadiens&#x27; number one goaltender at the beginning of the 1954–55 NHL season. On March 13, 1955, with only four games left in the season, an on-ice brawl resulted in the suspension of Montreal&#x27;s leading scorer, Maurice Richard, for the rest of the season and the playoffs. Four nights later, playing in Montreal in front of an angry crowd, Plante was witness to the riot that followed. The Canadiens subsequently lost to the Detroit Red Wings in the finals.

For the 1955–56 season, Plante was the unchallenged starting goaltender of the Canadiens; Gerry McNeil had not played the previous season and was sent to the Montreal Royals. Charlie Hodge, Plante&#x27;s backup the previous season, was sent to the Seattle Americans, a Canadiens&#x27; farm team. Later that season, Montreal won the Stanley Cup, the first of what would be five consecutive Stanley Cup championship seasons. For his part, Plante won the first of five consecutive Vezina Trophies. The next season, Plante missed most of November because of chronic bronchitis, a consequence of asthma that had affected him since childhood. During the 1957–58 NHL season, the Canadiens won their third straight Stanley Cup despite injuries to Plante and other members of the team. Plante&#x27;s asthma was getting worse. He sustained a concussion with just a few weeks left in the season and missed three games of the playoffs. In the sixth game of the Stanley Cup finals, Plante&#x27;s asthma was making him dizzy, and he was having difficulty concentrating; he collapsed at the end of the game after teammate Doug Harvey scored the series-winning goal. The Canadiens went on to win the Stanley Cup again at the close of the 1958–59 season.

====Goalie mask====

During the 1959–60 season, Plante wore a goaltender mask for the first time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in practice since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a sinusitis operation, head coach Toe Blake was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante&#x27;s nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude homemade goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3–1. During the following days, Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake&#x27;s request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3–0, and the mask returned for good the next night. That year, the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante&#x27;s last.

Plante subsequently designed his own and other goaltenders&#x27; masks. He was not the first NHL goaltender known to wear a face mask. Montreal Maroons&#x27; Clint Benedict wore a crude leather version in 1930 to protect a broken nose, but Plante introduced the mask as everyday equipment, and it is now mandatory equipment for goaltenders.

===Trade to New York and first retirement===
Hampered by terrible pain in his left knee during the 1960–61 NHL season, Plante was sent down to the minor league Montreal Royals. Torn cartilage was found in his knee, and the knee was surgically repaired during the summer of 1961. The next season, Plante became the fourth goaltender to win the Hart Memorial Trophy, while winning the Vezina Trophy for the sixth time. The 1962–63 season was unsettling for Plante. His asthma had worsened, and he missed most of the early season. His relationship with his coach, Toe Blake, continued to deteriorate because of Plante&#x27;s persistent health problems. Later, Plante was at the centre of a major controversy when he claimed that net sizes in the NHL were not uniform, thus giving a statistical advantage to goaltenders playing for the Chicago Black Hawks, Boston Bruins, and New York Rangers. His claim was later confirmed as the result of a manufacturing error.

After the Canadiens were eliminated for the third straight year in the first playoff round during the spring of 1963, there was mounting pressure for change from their fans and media. Growing tension between Plante and Blake because of Plante&#x27;s inconsistent work ethic and demeanor caused Blake to declare that for the 1963–64 season either he or Plante must go. On June 4, 1963, Plante was traded to the New York Rangers, with Phil Goyette and Don Marshall in exchange for Gump Worsley, Dave Balon, Leon Rochefort, and Len Ronson. Plante played for the Rangers for one full season and part of a second. He retired in 1965 while playing for the Rangers&#x27; AHL affiliate, the Baltimore Clippers. His wife was ill at the time, and he required surgery on his right knee.

Upon retirement, Plante took a job with Molson as a sales representative but remained active in the NHL. In 1965, Scotty Bowman asked Plante to play for the Montreal Jr. Canadiens in a game against the Soviet National Team. Honoured to represent his country, Plante agreed, and after receiving permission from both the Rangers (who owned his rights) and Molson, he began practising. The Canadiens won 2–1, and Plante was named first star of the game.

===Comeback to professional hockey===
At the beginning of the 1967–68 NHL season, Plante received a call from his ex-teammate Bert Olmstead seeking some help coaching the expansion Oakland Seals. Plante coached mainly by example, and after the three-week training camp, he returned home to Montreal. Plante also played an exhibition game with the Seals. Rumours swirled that Plante was planning a comeback.

In June 1968, Plante was selected in an intraleague draft by the St. Louis Blues and signed for $35,000 for the 1968–69 season. In his first season with the Blues, Plante split the goaltending duties with Glenn Hall. He won the Vezina Trophy that season for the seventh time, surpassing Bill Durnan&#x27;s record. While playing for the Blues in the 1969–70 playoffs against the Boston Bruins, a shot fired by Fred Stanfield and redirected by Phil Esposito hit Plante in the forehead, knocking him out and breaking his fibreglass mask. The first thing Plante said after he regained consciousness at the hospital was that the mask saved his life. That game proved to be his last for the Blues, and he was traded in the summer of 1970 to the Toronto Maple Leafs. He led the NHL with the lowest goals against average (GAA) during his first season with the Maple Leafs. That season, he also tied a Leafs franchise record, winning 9 straight games. At season&#x27;s end, he was named to the NHL&#x27;s second All-Star team, his seventh such honour. Late in the 1972–73 season, Plante was traded to the Boston Bruins. While he had two shutouts in eight regular season games, Plante struggled in the playoffs, and after conceding 10 goals in two games, he was replaced as the starter.

Plante accepted a $1 million, 10-year contract to become coach and general manager of the Quebec Nordiques of the World Hockey Association in 1973. He was highly dissatisfied with his and the team&#x27;s performance and resigned at the end of the 1973–74 season. Coming out of retirement once more, Plante played 31 games for the Edmonton Oilers of the WHA in the 1974–75 season. Plante retired during the Oilers&#x27; training camp in 1975–76 after receiving news that his youngest son had died.

==Hockey analysis and coaching==
Plante had a well-earned reputation for his ability to analyse the game of hockey. He began shouting directions to his teammates during games in his first stint in the minor leagues (the goaltender usually has the best view of the game). He kept extensive notes on opposing players and teams throughout his career. He made his debut in the broadcasting booth during his first retirement in the 1960s as a colour commentator for broadcasts of Quebec Junior League games alongside Danny Gallivan of Hockey Night in Canada fame. Radio Canada, the French language branch of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, brought Plante aboard as an on-air analyst for its television broadcasts of the 1972 Summit Series between the national team of the Soviet Union and a Canadian team made up of professional players from the NHL. Plante was one of the few North American analysts who dissented from the widely held belief in the superiority of the Canadian team.

Plante also wrote extensively on hockey. He wrote hockey columns starting early in his career and was published in &quot;La Voix de Shawinigan&quot;, &quot;Le Samedi&quot;, and &quot;Sport Magazine.&quot; He alienated local reporters by writing a column for the local paper during his time as coach of the Quebec Nordiques. His seminal work, &quot;On Goaltending&quot;, was published in 1972 in English, with the French edition (entitled &quot;Devant le filet&quot;) published in 1973. In his book, Plante outlined a program of goaltender development that included off-ice exercises, choice of equipment, styles of play, and game-day preparation. He also advised on best coaching methods for both young and advanced goaltenders. His book remained popular with coaches and players and was reprinted in both French and English in 1997, 25 years after it was first published.

Starting in 1967, Plante was one of the instructors at &quot;École moderne de hockey,&quot; a summer hockey school for young players. His reputation as a teacher spread, and he traveled to Sweden in 1972 at the invitation of the Swedish Hockey Federation, teaching the top goaltenders in the country and their coaches and trainers. During his first and second retirements, Plante also coached goaltenders and consulted for several NHL teams, including the Oakland Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, Montreal Canadiens and St. Louis Blues.

==Retirement and death==
Plante finally retired from hockey in 1975, after the death of his youngest son. He moved to Switzerland with his second wife, Raymonde Udrisard, but remained active on the North American hockey scene as an analyst, adviser, and goaltender trainer. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1978. In the fall of 1985, Plante was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. He died in a Geneva hospital in February 1986 and was buried in Sierre, Switzerland. When his coffin was carried from the church following the funeral mass, it passed under an arch of hockey sticks held high by a team of young hockey players from Quebec, visiting Switzerland for a tournament.

==Legacy==

Plante was one of the first goaltenders to skate behind the net to stop the puck. He also was one of the first to raise his arm on an icing call to let his defencemen know what was happening. He perfected a stand-up, positional style, cutting down the angles; he became one of the first goaltenders to write a how-to book about the position. He was a pioneer of stickhandling the puck; before that time, goaltenders passively stood in the net and simply deflected pucks to defencemen or backchecking forwards.

Plante was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1978, Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1981, and into the Quebec Sports Pantheon in 1994. His no. 1 jersey was retired in 1995 by the Montreal Canadiens. The Jacques Plante Memorial Trophy was established in his honour as an award to the top goaltender in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. The Jacques Plante Trophy was established in Switzerland after Plante&#x27;s death; it is given out annually to the top Swiss goaltender. The former arena in Shawinigan, where Plante grew up and played his first organized games, was renamed to Aréna Jacques Plante.

His injury and subsequent donning of a mask were depicted in an installment of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Heritage Minute&quot; series.

<text>Zalman Yanovsky (December 19, 1944 – December 13, 2002) was a Canadian folk-rock musician and restaurateur. Born in Toronto, he was the son of political cartoonist Avrom Yanovsky and teacher Nechama Yanovsky (née Gemeril), who died in 1958. He played lead guitar and sang for the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, a rock band which he founded with John Sebastian in 1964. 

In 1967 he left the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful and was replaced by Jerry Yester. Yanovsky released a solo album in 1968 titled &quot;Alive and Well in Argentina&quot;. In 1971 he retired from music and became a restaurateur, opening his own restaurant in 1979 and writing cookbooks. He continued to perform occasionally. 

Yanovsky was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1996. He was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000 as a member of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful.

==Musical career==
Mostly self-taught, Yanovsky began his musical career playing folk music coffee houses in Toronto. He lived on a kibbutz in Israel for a short time before returning to Canada. He teamed with fellow Canadian Denny Doherty in the Halifax Three. The two joined Cass Elliot in the Mugwumps, a group mentioned by Doherty&#x27;s and Cass&#x27;s later group the Mamas &amp; the Papas in the song &quot;Creeque Alley&quot;.

It was at this time that he met John Sebastian, and they formed the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful with Steve Boone and Joe Butler. According to Sebastian: &quot;He could play like Elmore James, he could play like Floyd Cramer, he could play like Chuck Berry. He could play like all these people, yet he still had his own overpowering personality. Out of this we could, I thought, craft something with real flexibility.&quot; The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful had hits such as &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot;, &quot;Summer in the City&quot;, &quot;Daydream&quot;, &quot;Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?&quot;, &quot;Darling Be Home Soon&quot;, and &quot;You Didn&#x27;t Have to Be So Nice&quot;. The group&#x27;s only number one was &quot;Summer In The City&quot; (which stayed there for 3 weeks in August 1966).

In 1966, he was arrested in the United States on a marijuana-related charge. Returning to his native Canada, he recorded the solo album &quot;Alive and Well in Argentina (and Loving Every Minute of It)&quot;. Buddah Records released the album in the U.S. in 1968, along with &quot;As Long as You&#x27;re Here&quot;, a single that did not appear on the album. The single (on which the B-side was the same track without vocals and with playback backwards) just missed the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but fared a little better in &quot;Cashbox&quot;, peaking at No. 73, and reaching No. 57 in the Canadian RPM Magazine charts. Kama Sutra Records reissued the album in 1971 with a completely different cover, and the inclusion of &quot;As Long as You&#x27;re Here&quot;.

While a member of Kris Kristofferson&#x27;s backing band at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, he had a brief reunion with John Sebastian; Sebastian had been (apparently) unaware of Yanovsky&#x27;s presence, and was made aware by a message passed through the crowd, written on a toilet roll.

He also appeared in the off-Broadway show &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Lemmings&quot; at New York&#x27;s Village Gate. Although not an original cast member, he contributed a musical number, &quot;Nirvana Banana&quot;, a Donovan parody.

In 1980 he appeared in the movie One-Trick Pony and reunited with the Lovin Spoonful. In 1996 Yanovsky was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and performed. In 2000 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, and performed alongside his former bandmates at the ceremony. The Hall of Fame performance was the last time Yanovsky performed live, and the last time the original line up of The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful performed together.

==Restaurateur==
After retiring from the music business, Yanovsky became a chef and restaurateur with his second wife, Rose Richardson; together they opened Chez Piggy in 1979, and Pan Chancho Bakery in 1994, both in Kingston, Ontario. He had worked as a chef at The Golden Apple (in Gananoque, Ontario) and, in the mid-1970s, at Dr. Bull&#x27;s (in Kingston). The success of Chez Piggy prompted the publication of a companion cookbook (&quot;The Chez Piggy Cookbook&quot;, Firefly Books, 1998) that was collected by fans. After Yanovsky&#x27;s death in December 2002, and Richardson&#x27;s death in 2005, his daughter Zoe Yanovsky (with actress Jackie Burroughs) took over the ownership of both eateries. Zoe also completed and launched another cookbook that Zal was working on, titled &quot;The Pan Chancho Cookbook&quot; (Bookmakers Press, 2006).

==Personal life==
Yanovsky met Canadian actress Jackie Burroughs in 1961 in a laundromat in Toronto, where he was sleeping in a dryer while homeless. They were married in 1967 and had one daughter, Zoe, before separating in 1968. He subsequently married Rose Richardson. His step-mother was Anna Yanovsky (née Atanas), who died in 2022.

==Death==
Yanovsky died on December 13, 2002, in Kingston, Ontario, from a heart attack, at the age of 57. A funeral service was held in Kingston, Ontario, on December 16, 2002.

<doc id="167878" wikidata="Q2642683" url="?curid=167878" title="Alexander Mitchell (engineer)">
<text>Alexander Mitchell (13 April 1780 – 25 June 1868) was an Irish engineer who from 1802 was blind. He is known as the inventor of the screw-pile lighthouse.

==Early life==
Born in Dublin, his family moved to Belfast while he was a child, and he received his formal education at Belfast Royal Academy, where he excelled in mathematics.

==Career==
Originally working in brickmaking in Belfast, he invented machines used in that trade, before patenting the screw-pile in 1833, for which he would later gain some fame. The screw-pile was used for the erection of lighthouses and other structures on mudbanks and shifting sands, including bridges and piers. Mitchell&#x27;s designs and methods were employed all over the world from Portland breakwater to Bombay bridges. Initially it was used for the construction of lighthouses on Maplin Sands in the Thames Estuary (the first light application, in 1838), the Wyre Light at Fleetwood in Lancashire (the first such beacon lit) completed, in 1839), and at Belfast Lough where his lighthouse was finished in July 1844.

In May 1851 he moved to Cobh to lay the foundation for a lighthouse on the Spit Bank; the success of these undertakings led to the use of his invention on the breakwater at Portland, the viaduct and bridges on the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway and a broad system of Indian telegraphs.

While in Cork, Mitchell became friendly with astronomer John Thomas Romney Robinson, and mathematician George Boole.

==Awards and honours==
In 1848, he was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and received the Telford Medal the same year for a paper on his invention.

==Death==
Mitchell died at Glen Devis near Belfast on 25 June 1868. His wife and daughter had predeceased him.

<text>A wet dream, sex dream, or sleep orgasm, is a spontaneous occurrence of sexual arousal during sleep that includes ejaculation (nocturnal emission) and orgasm for a male, and vaginal lubrication and/or orgasm for a female.

==Context==
Nocturnal emissions can happen after stressful dreams in REM sleep which activate the sympathetic nervous system, hence leading to ejaculation. They can also happen after sex dreams.

Nocturnal emissions can start as early as age ten, and are most common during adolescence and early young adult years, but they may happen any time after puberty. Men can wake up during a wet dream, or sleep through it, but for women, some researchers have added the requirement that they should awaken during the orgasm, and perceive that the orgasm happened before it counts as a &quot;wet dream&quot;. Vaginal lubrication alone does not mean that the woman has had an orgasm.

==Composition==
Due to the difficulty in collecting ejaculate produced during nocturnal emissions, relatively few studies have examined its composition.

In the largest study, which included nocturnal emission samples from 10 men with idiopathic anejaculation, the semen concentration was equivalent to samples obtained from the same men by penile vibratory stimulation, although the proportions of sperm which were motile, and which were of normal morphology, were higher in the nocturnal emission specimens.

==Frequency==
In a detailed study, men and women reported that roughly 8% of their everyday dreams contain some form of sexual-related activity. 4% of sex dreams among both men and women resulted in orgasms.

===In males===
The frequency of nocturnal emissions is highly variable. Some reported that it is due to being sexually inactive for 5–26 weeks, with no engagement in either intercourse or masturbation. Some males have experienced large numbers of nocturnal emissions as teenagers, while others have never experienced any. In the U.S., 83% of men experience nocturnal emissions at some time.

For males who have experienced nocturnal emissions, the mean frequency ranges from 0.36 times per week (about once every three weeks) for single 15-year-old males to 0.18 times per week for 40-year-old single males. For married males, the mean ranges from 0.23 times per week (about once per month) for 19-year-old married males to 0.15 times per week (about once every two months) for 50-year-old married males.

In Indonesia surveys have shown that 93% of men experience nocturnal emissions by the age of 24.

Some males have the emissions only at a specific age, while others have them throughout their lives following puberty. The frequency with which one has nocturnal emissions has not been conclusively linked to the frequency of masturbation. Alfred Kinsey found: 

One factor that can affect the number of nocturnal emissions males have is whether they take testosterone-based drugs. In a 1998 study by Finkelstein &quot;et al&quot;, the number of boys reporting nocturnal emissions drastically increased as their testosterone doses were increased, from 17% of subjects with no treatment to 90% of subjects at a high dose.

Thirteen percent of males experience their first ejaculation as a result of a nocturnal emission. Kinsey found that males experiencing their first ejaculation through a nocturnal emission were older than those experiencing their first ejaculation by means of masturbation. The study indicates that such a first ejaculation resulting from a nocturnal emission was delayed a year or more from what would have been developmentally possible for such males through physical stimulation.

===In females===
In 1953, sex researcher Alfred Kinsey found that nearly 40% of the women he interviewed had had one or more nocturnal orgasms or wet dreams. Those who reported experiencing these said that they usually had them several times a year and that they first occurred as early as thirteen, and usually by the age of 21. Kinsey defined female nocturnal orgasm as sexual arousal during sleep that awakens one to perceive the experience of orgasm.

Research published by Barbara L. Wells in the 1986 &quot;Journal of Sex Research&quot; indicates that as many as 85% of women have experienced nocturnal orgasm by the age of 21. This research was based on women waking up with or during orgasm.

Studies have found that males typically have more frequent spontaneous nocturnal sexual experiences than females. However, female wet dreams may also be more difficult to identify with certainty than male wet dreams because ejaculation is usually associated with male orgasm while vaginal lubrication may not indicate orgasm.

==Cultural views==

Numerous cultural and religious views have been advanced related to nocturnal emissions. Below is a limited summary of some perspectives.

===Jewish and Samaritan===

Some examples of passages under the Mosaic law of the Hebrew Bible teach that under the law of Moses, a man who had a nocturnal emission incurred ritual defilement (as with any other instance of ejaculation):

The first of these is part of a passage stating similar regulations about sexual intercourse and menstruation. Leviticus 12 makes similar regulations about childbirth.

A third passage relates more specifically to priests, requiring any &quot;of the offspring of Aaron who has ... a discharge&quot;, among other causes of ritual defilement, to abstain from eating holy offerings until after a ritual immersion in a &quot;mikveh&quot; and until the subsequent nocturnal emission.

In Judaism, the Tikkun HaKlali, also known as &quot;The General Remedy&quot;, is a set of ten Psalms designed in 1805 by Rebbe Nachman, whose recital is intended to serve as repentance for nocturnal emissions.

===Patristic Christian===
Saint Augustine held that male nocturnal emissions, unlike masturbation, did not pollute the conscience of a man, because they were not voluntary carnal acts, and were therefore not to be considered a sin.

A similar view was expressed by Aquinas, who wrote in the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; II-II-154-5: 

===Islamic===
A wet dream (, &quot;ihtilam&quot;) is not a sin in Islam. Moreover, whereas a person fasting (in Ramadan or otherwise) would normally be considered to have broken their fast by ejaculating on purpose (during either masturbation or intercourse), nocturnal emission is not such a cause. However, they are still required to bathe before undergoing some religious rituals.

Muslim scholars consider ejaculation something that makes one temporarily ritually impure, a condition known as junub, meaning that a Muslim who has had an orgasm or ejaculated must have a &quot;ghusl&quot; (consisting of ablution followed by bathing the entire body so that not a single hair remains dry on the whole body—may also require one to rub the body according to Maliki school of thought, &quot;dalk&quot; in Arabic—while showering) before they can read any verse of the Quran or perform the formal prayers. Informal supplications and prayers (du&#x27;a) do not require such a bath.

===Indian traditions===
The Hindu text suggests those who had nocturnal emissions to bathe and chant mantras praying to return their virility. Vinaya suggests masturbation is a sin, but a nocturnal emission is not. During the third Buddhist council, it was suggested that having wet dreams as an Arhat does not count as a sin.

===Medieval Europe===

In European folklore, nocturnal emissions were believed to be caused by a succubus copulating with the individual at night, an event associated with sleep paralysis and possibly night terrors.

===East Asia===
Traditional East Asian medicine considered it problematic because it was considered to be an act of evil spirits that tried to rob the life of a person. The literature suggests a &quot;cure&quot; for nocturnal emissions, which prescribes fried leek seeds three times a day.

<text>Philip Haig Nitschke (; born 8 August 1947) is an Australian humanist, author, former physician, and founder and director of the pro-euthanasia group Exit International. He campaigned successfully to have a legal euthanasia law passed in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory and assisted four people in ending their lives before the law was overturned by the Government of Australia. Nitschke was the first doctor in the world to administer a legal, voluntary, lethal injection, after which the patient activated the syringe using a computer. Nitschke states that he and his group are regularly subject to harassment by authorities. In 2015, Nitschke burned his medical practising certificate in response to what he saw as onerous conditions that violated his right to free speech, imposed on him by the Medical Board of Australia. Nitschke has been referred to in the media as &quot;Dr Death&quot; or &quot;the Elon Musk of assisted suicide&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Nitschke was born in 1947 in Ardrossan, South Australia, the son of school teachers Harold and Gweneth (Gwen) Nitschke. Nitschke studied physics at the University of Adelaide, gaining a PhD from Flinders University in laser physics in 1972.

Rejecting a career in the sciences, he instead travelled to the Northern Territory to take up work with the Aboriginal land rights activist Vincent Lingiari and the Gurindji at Wave Hill. After the hand-back of land by the prime minister, Gough Whitlam, Nitschke became a Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife ranger. However, after badly injuring his subtalar joint, which effectively finished his career as a ranger, he began studying for a medical degree. In addition to having long been interested in studying medicine he has suffered from hypochondria most of his adult life and futilely hoped with his medical studies to educate himself out of the problem.

He graduated from the University of Sydney Medical School in 1989.

==Early career==
After graduating Nitschke worked as an intern at Royal Darwin Hospital, and then as an after-hours general practitioner. When the Northern Territory branch of the Australian Medical Association publicly opposed the proposed Northern Territory legislation to provide for legal euthanasia, Nitschke and a small group of dissenting Territory doctors published a contrary opinion in the NT News under the banner &quot;Doctors for change&quot;. This put him in a position of an informal spokesperson for the proposed legislation. After the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act (ROTI Act) came into force on 1 July 1996, Nitschke assisted four terminally ill people to end their lives using the Deliverance Machine he developed. This practice was ceased when the ROTI Act was effectively nullified by the Australian Parliament&#x27;s Euthanasia Laws Act 1997.

In the 1996 Australian federal election Nitschke ran in the seat of the Northern Territory for the Australian Greens but was unsuccessful.

After the ROTI Act was nullified Nitschke began providing advice to others about how they can end their lives, leading to the formation of Exit International in 1997. A notable case of Nitschke&#x27;s was that of Nancy Crick, aged 69. On 22 May 2002, Crick, in the presence of over 20 friends and family (but not Nitschke), took a lethal dose of barbiturates, went quickly to sleep, and died within 20 minutes. Nitschke had encouraged Crick to enter palliative care, which she did for a number of days before returning home again. She had undergone multiple surgeries to treat bowel cancer and was left with multiple dense and inoperable bowel adhesions that left her in constant pain and frequently in the toilet with diarrhoea. She was not, however, terminally ill at the time of her death. Nitschke said the scar tissue from previous cancer surgery had caused her suffering. &quot;She didn&#x27;t actually want to die when she had cancer. She wanted to die after she had cancer treatment,&quot; he said.

Nitschke made headlines in New Zealand when he announced plans to accompany eight New Zealanders to Mexico where the drug Nembutal, capable of producing a fatal overdose, can be purchased legally. He also made headlines, even angering some fellow right-to-die advocates, when he presented his plan to launch a &quot;death ship&quot; that would have allowed him to circumvent local laws by euthanising people from around the world in international waters.

In the 2007 Australian federal election Nitschke ran against the Australian politician Kevin Andrews in the Victorian seat of Menzies but was unsuccessful.

In 2009 Nitschke helped to promote &quot;Dignified Departure&quot;, a 13-hour, pay-television program on doctor-assisted suicide in Hong Kong and mainland China. The program aired in October in China on the Family Health channel, run by the official China National Radio.

Organisations opposed to euthanasia, as well as some supporting euthanasia, are critical of Nitschke and his methods.

== Conflict with Medical Board of Australia ==
In February 2014 Nitschke was approached after a workshop by Nigel Brayley, 45. Brayley was facing ongoing questions about the death of his wife, which police were treating as suspected murder. Two other female friends of his had also died, one of whom is still missing. Nitschke recounts that Brayley rebuffed suggestions to seek counselling and had already obtained the drug Nembutal. Brayley then committed suicide in May 2014. Although Nitschke was unaware of the investigation at the time, he now believes that Brayley, whom he described as a &quot;serial killer&quot;, had made a rational decision to commit suicide rather than face long imprisonment. Nitschke stated that he does not believe he could have changed Brayley&#x27;s mind, that Brayley was not his patient, that Brayley was not depressed and did not seek or want Nitschke&#x27;s advice. The Medical Board of Australia (MBA) and Beyondblue said Nitschke had an obligation to refer the man to a psychologist or psychiatrist (a view dismissed by the NT Supreme Court in 2015).

On 23 July 2014, as a consequence of the Brayley case, the MBA voted to use emergency powers to suspend his practitioner&#x27;s licence immediately, on the grounds that he presented &quot;a serious risk to public health and safety&quot;. Nitschke said he would appeal the suspension, which he claimed was politically motivated, and that the Board &quot;made it clear that what they really object to is the way I think. It&#x27;s ideas they object to — namely, my belief that people should have a right to suicide, is something they think is contrary to medical practice.&quot; The MBA later clarified that the suspension was an interim measure pending the outcome of an inquiry. Nitschke said the suspension will not affect his work for Exit International and that he had not practised medicine for years.

Nitschke appealed to an MBA tribunal in Darwin to have his July 2014 suspension from practising medicine overturned. In late 2014 the appeal was rejected on the grounds that, although it was accepted that Brayley was not Nitschke&#x27;s patient, the controversial concept of rational suicide was inconsistent with the medical profession&#x27;s code of conduct and that, as a medical practitioner providing advice on suicide, he posed a serious risk because people may elect to commit suicide believing it to be a pathway sanctioned by a medical practitioner and perhaps the medical profession generally. Nitschke then appealed the tribunal&#x27;s decision to the Darwin Supreme Court.

On 6 July 2015 the Northern Territory supreme court upheld Nitschke&#x27;s appeal, finding the emergency suspension of his licence by the MBA should not have been upheld by a review tribunal. Justice Hiley&#x27;s ruling said that the tribunal and board had misconstrued the doctors’ code of conduct, which requires them to &quot;protect and promote the health of individuals&quot;, as extending to all doctors and all individuals. &quot;A doctor would constantly need to fear that any interaction with any other individual or community, including an individual who is not and never has been his or her patient, may be in breach of the (code), even if the doctor did nothing in circumstances where there was no other obligation to do something,&quot; he said. Nitschke said the MBA&#x27;s erroneous interpretation was &quot;ludicrous&quot; and flew in the face of common law. Nitschke&#x27;s lawyer will apply for costs of approximately AU$300,000, which were paid using donations, including $20,000 from Swiss euthanasia organisation Dignitas.

In October 2015 the MBA lifted Nitschke&#x27;s suspension but drew up a list of 25 conditions under which Nitschke could continue to practise. These conditions included prohibitions on giving advice or information to the public or patients about euthanasia, or Nembutal, or suicide, and forcing him to rescind his endorsement of and involvement with the &#x27;Peaceful Pill&#x27; handbook and related videos. In response Nitschke, calling the MBA&#x27;s actions &quot;a heavy-handed and clumsy attempt to restrict the free flow of information on end-of-life choice&quot;, surveyed more than 1,000 members of his advocacy group, Exit International, and received strong support for ending his medical registration. As a consequence of the MBA restrictions and the results of the member survey, Nitschke publicly burned his medical practising certificate and announced the end of his medical career, vowing to continue to promote euthanasia.

Nitschke stated that he will remain a doctor and will legitimately use the title &quot;doctor&quot; (he has a PhD), and will continue to see patients and Exit members in clinics that he runs in Australia and other countries. In the wake of this incident, Nitschke and his partner, Fiona Stewart, decided in 2015 to relocate to the more liberal politico-legal environment of Holland.

== Conflict with police ==
Nitschke states that he and his group are regularly subject to harassment by authorities, including detention and questioning at international airports, and raids on homes and the premises of Exit International.

On 2 May 2009 Nitschke was detained for nine hours by British Immigration officials at Heathrow Airport after arriving for a visit to the UK to lecture on voluntary euthanasia and end-of-life choices. Nitschke said it was a matter of free speech and that his detention said something about changes to British society which were &quot;quite troubling&quot;. Nitschke was told that he and his wife, author Fiona Stewart, were detained because the workshops may contravene British law. However, although assisting someone to commit suicide in the UK was illegal, the law did not apply to a person lecturing on the concept of euthanasia, and Nitschke was allowed to enter. Dame Joan Bakewell, the British government&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Older People&quot;, said that the current British law on assisted suicide was &quot;a mess&quot; and that Nitschke should have been made more welcome in the UK.

On 1 August 2014, after euthanasia advocate Max Bromson, 66, who suffered from terminal bone cancer, ended his life with Nembutal in a Glenelg motel room, surrounded by family members, police carried out a three-hour raid on Exit International&#x27;s Adelaide premises, interrogating Nitschke and seizing Nitschke&#x27;s phones, computers and other items. Nitschke said he felt violated by the &quot;heavy-handed and unnecessary&quot; police actions and confiscations that would cripple Exit International&#x27;s activities. In August 2016, after exactly two years of investigation, South Australian police advised that no charges would be laid against anyone over the death. In 2019, Nitschke&#x27;s phone and computer were finally returned.

In April 2016 British police, acting on an Interpol drug alert, forced entry into the home of a member of Nitschke&#x27;s organisation, retired professor Dr Avril Henry, aged 81, who was in failing health. Without knocking, police —accompanied by a psychiatrist, GP and social worker— forced their way into Dr Henry&#x27;s home by smashing her glass front door at 10pm and questioned her for six hours, confiscating a bottle of imported Nembutal, and leaving at 4am. They decided Dr Henry &quot;had capacity&quot; and would not be sectioned (detained involuntarily for mental assessment). Worried that the police would return and confiscate her remaining Nembutal, she committed suicide four days later. Dr Nitschke commented that police had made Dr Henry&#x27;s last days on earth a misery and that “police need to realise that in the UK, suicide is not a crime, and mental health authorities need to recognise that not everyone who seeks to end their life is in need of psychiatric intervention&quot;, adding that the police action was &quot;a significant abuse of power against a vulnerable elderly woman&quot;.

In May 2018 Australian Federal Police used local police force personnel in different regions of the country to conduct late night raids on the homes of elderly Exit members, demanding to know if they had bought the euthanasia drug Nembutal. 

===Operation Painter===
In October 2016 New Zealand police, in a &quot;sting&quot; operation code named &quot;Operation Painter&quot;, set up roadblocks (checkpoints) outside an Exit International meeting and took down names and addresses of all attendees. Some of the elderly members of the group were later visited at their homes by police with warrants, and searches were conducted. Computers, tablets, cameras, letters and books were seized. Nitschke said police actions were unprecedented and probably in breach of the Bill of Rights, which guaranteed freedom of association. The police operation was the subject of an Independent Police Conduct Authority investigation. Legal action against the police followed. In March 2018, the Independent Police Conduct Authority found Operation Painter to be illegal.

This coincided with another action by New Zealand police in which 76-year old Patsy McGrath, a member of Nitschke&#x27;s Exit group, had her home raided in 2016 and her store-bought helium balloon cylinder confiscated under warrant. The confiscation of the cylinder was later found to be illegal and it was returned to her in 2018.

==Views on euthanasia==
===Dying with dignity===
On 29 April 2009 Nitschke said: &quot;It seems we demand humans to live with indignity, pain and anguish whereas we are kinder to our pets when their suffering becomes too much. It simply is not logical or mature. Trouble is, we have had too many centuries of religious claptrap.&quot; He works mainly with older people from whom he gains inspiration, saying: &quot;You get quite inspired and uplifted by the elderly folk who see this as quite a practical approach&quot;.

In July 2009 Nitschke said he no longer believed voluntary euthanasia should only be available to the terminally ill, but that elderly people afraid of getting old and incapacitated should also have a choice.

Nitschke expects that a growing number of people importing their own euthanasia drugs &quot;really don&#x27;t care if the law is changed or not&quot;.

===Palliative care===
Palliative care specialists state that many requests for euthanasia arise from fear of physical or psychological distress in the patient&#x27;s last days, and that widespread and equitable availability of specialist palliative care services will reduce requests for euthanasia. Nitschke is dismissive of this argument. &quot;We have too many people who have the best palliative care in the world and they still want to know that they can put an end to things,&quot; he said. &quot;By and large, palliative care have done pretty well out of the argument over the euthanasia issue, because they are the ones that have argued that they just need better funding and then no one will ever want to die – that&#x27;s a lie.&quot;

===Younger people and suicide===
In 2010 the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine released a report into Australian deaths caused by the drug Nembutal, which Nitschke recommends as a euthanasia drug. Of the 51 deaths studied, 14 were of people between the ages of 20 and 40. Nitschke acknowledged that the information about the drug that was provided online could be accessed by people below the age of 50 who were not terminally ill, but argued that the risk was necessary in order to help the elderly and the seriously ill.

It was alleged that Joe Waterman, 25, had committed suicide after accessing Nitschke&#x27;s online euthanasia handbook, by misrepresenting his age as over 50. Waterman subsequently imported Nembutal and ended his life. In another case Lucas Taylor, 26, committed suicide in Germany by taking Nembutal after soliciting advice at an Exit International online forum (which, according to Nitschke, he accessed by claiming his age was 65).

===Individual rights argument===
Nitschke argues that an individual person has a fundamental right to control their own death just as they have a right to control their own life. He believes in having the &quot;Peaceful Pill&quot; available for every adult of sound mind.

===Opposition to nitrogen hypoxia execution technique===
In 2024, Nitschke appeared in an Alabama court as an expert witness to oppose the state&#x27;s plan to execute convicted killer Kenneth Smith using a mask-and-gas technique incorporating nitrogen. Nitschke testified that the mask-and-gas approach had been rejected decades ago because it was unreliable, and that Smith could be &quot;horribly maimed without a complete seal between mask and face&quot; leading to incomplete cerebral hypoxia and a resultant vegetative state. Nitschke said that nitrogen must be delivered correctly to work as intended. Nitschke said the Alabama nitrogen hypoxia method was &quot;quick and nasty&quot; and ignored the possibilities of vomiting and air leakage.

==Censorship==

===Internet===

On 22 May 2009 it was disclosed in the press, citing WikiLeaks, that the Australian Government had added the online &quot;Peaceful Pill Handbook&quot; to the blacklist maintained by the Australian Communications and Media Authority used to filter internet access to citizens of Australia. The Australian Communications Minister, Stephen Conroy, planned to introduce legislation just before the 2010 election to make internet service providers block a blacklist of &quot;refused classification&quot; websites. The blacklist is expected to include Exit&#x27;s websites and other similar sites. Nitschke said the proposals were the &quot;final nail in the coffin for euthanasia advocacy&quot; in Australia, where people are banned from discussing end-of-life issues over the phone, buying books about it or importing printed material on it. &quot;The one avenue we had open to us was the internet, and now it looks like it will be part of Conroy&#x27;s grand plan to provide a so-called clean feed to Australia. It&#x27;s outrageous.&quot;

In April 2010 Nitschke began holding a series of &quot;Hacking Masterclasses&quot; to teach people how to circumvent the Australian internet filter. Access to Nitschke&#x27;s online &quot;Peaceful Pill Handbook&quot; was blocked during trials of the government&#x27;s filter. A government spokeswoman said euthanasia would not be targeted by the proposed filter, but confirmed that &quot;The (website) ... for accessing an electronic version of the [Peaceful Pill Handbook] was classified as refused classification&quot; because it provided detailed instruction in &quot;crimes relating to the possession, manufacture and importation of barbiturates&quot;.

Nitschke said Exit International would investigate if it could set up its own proxy server or VPN tunnel, so its members had a safe way of accessing its information.

In January 2018, YouTube deleted Nitschke&#x27;s YouTube channel &quot;Exityourtube&quot;. The channel had been operating for 10 years. YouTube gave no reason why the account was deleted without notice.

===Television===
On 10 September 2010 Nitschke complained that the Commercials Advice self-regulator of advertising content on Australian commercial television had prevented the television screening of a paid advertisement from Exit International in which an actor depicted a dying man who requested the option of voluntary euthanasia. Commercials Advice reportedly cited Section 2.17.5 of the &quot;Commercial Television Code of Practice&quot;: Suicide. The advertisement was felt to condone the practice of suicide. Nitschke responded that the acts of Commercials Advice constitute interference with the right to free speech. Similar TV commercials, planned for use during Nitschke&#x27;s Canadian lecture tour of 2010, were likewise banned by the Television Bureau of Canada, after lobbying by anti-euthanasia pressure groups.

===Billboards===
In 2010 Nitschke planned to use billboards in Australia to feature the message &quot;85 per cent of Australians support voluntary euthanasia but our government won&#x27;t listen&quot;. In September 2010, Nitschke&#x27;s billboard advertising campaign was blocked by &quot;Billboards Australia&quot;. Billboards Australia cited section of the NSW Crimes Act that outlaws the aiding or abetting of suicide or attempted suicide. Nitschke was told to provide legal advice outlining how his billboard did not break this law, a request Nitschke described as &quot;ludicrous&quot;, pointing out that the billboards urge &quot;political change and in no way could be considered to be in breach of the crimes act&quot;. Nitschke said he had sought a legal opinion from prominent human rights lawyer Greg Barns. The lawyer was able to convince Billboards Australia to rescind its ruling, in part.

==Euthanasia techniques==

===Exit bag and CoGen===
Nitschke created devices to aid people who want euthanasia, including a product called the &quot;exit bag&quot; (a large plastic bag with a drawstring allowing it to be secured around the neck) and the &quot;CoGen&quot; (or &quot;Co-Genie&quot;) device. The CoGen device generates the deadly gas carbon monoxide, which is inhaled with a face mask.

===Euthanasia device===


In December 2008 Nitschke released details of a euthanasia machine to the media. He called it &quot;flawless&quot; and &quot;undetectable&quot;, saying the new process uses ordinary household products including a barbecue gas bottle — available from hardware stores — filled with nitrogen. Nitschke developed a process in which patients lose consciousness immediately and die a few minutes later.

Nitschke said: &quot;So it&#x27;s extremely quick and there are no drugs. Importantly this doesn&#x27;t fail – it&#x27;s reliable, peaceful, available and with the additional benefit of undetectability.&quot;

===Barbiturate testing kit===
In 2009 Nitschke made a barbiturate testing kit available, initially launched in the UK, then Australia. Nitschke said the kit was made available by Exit International in response to growing demand for something to test the Nembutal obtained from Mexico, often delivered in the post without labels. &quot;They want to be sure they have the right concentration,&quot; Nitschke said. The kits have chemicals that change colour when mixed with Nembutal. He was detained for an hour for questioning on arrival at Auckland Airport in New Zealand on a trip to hold public meetings and launch the kit.

===Pentobarbital long-storage pill===
In October 2009 Nitschke announced his intention to inform people at his workshops where to obtain a long-storage form of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal) that manufacturers say can be stored for up to fifty years without degrading. Liquid forms of pentobarbital degrade within a few years, while the solid form (a white, crystalline powder) does not. Nitschke intends to advise people on how to reconstitute the pill into liquid form for ingestion if and when it ever becomes appropriate. He said that he sees it as a way of keeping people accurately informed and allowing them to make viable choices. The provision of this information would be consistent with good medical care, in his view.

===Nitrogen canisters===

In 2012 Nitschke started a beer-brewing company (&quot;Max Dog Brewing&quot;) for the purpose of importing nitrogen canisters. Nitschke stated that the gas cylinders can be used for both brewing and, if required, to end life at a later stage in a &quot;peaceful, reliable [and] totally legal&quot; manner. Nitschke said, &quot;[nitrogen] was undetectable even by autopsy, which was important to some people&quot;.

An Australian anti-euthanasia campaigner complained to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) about the canisters. AHPRA has undertaken to investigate. The investigation is not complete.

Following a 2013 workshop showcasing Nitschke&#x27;s nitrogen gas product, the AMA&#x27;s WA branch president and general practitioner, Richard Choong, said that he was strongly opposed to it, regardless of its technical legality, since &quot;any machine that can help you kill yourself can be abused, misused and maliciously used&quot;. Nitschke responded that without such information most elderly people who want to end their lives hang themselves, which is &quot;an embarrassment and shame&quot;.

In 2014 Australians Valerie Seeger and Claire Parsons used the Max Dog brewing equipment to commit suicide. Police investigated but decided not to prosecute Nitschke after a two and a half year investigation.

===Sarco device===

In 2017 Nitschke invented the 3D-printed suicide capsule, which he named &quot;the Sarco&quot;. The Sarco consists of a detachable coffin mounted on a stand containing a nitrogen canister. In an article in December 2017 about the Sarco, Newsweek referred to Nitschke as &quot;the Elon Musk of assisted suicide&quot;.

==Comedian==
Nitschke began his comedy career at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2015 with his show &quot;Dicing with Dr Death&quot;. &quot;ThreeWeeks&quot; called it &quot;engaging and highly thought-provoking&quot;. He performed a newer Australian version of his show, retitled &quot;Practising without a License&quot;, at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in April 2016 and again in Darwin in August 2016. The &quot;Herald Sun&quot; reviewed his performance favorably: &quot;[Nitschke] &quot;presented his case with such measure, warm humour and intelligence that even his puns were excusable&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
*In 1996 Nitschke received the Rainier Foundation Humanitarian Award
*In 1998 Nitschke was recognised as the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies.
*He is a nine-time nominee for Australian of the Year (2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014) and twice a state finalist (2005 &amp; 2006)

==Books==
Nitschke is the author of three books:

===&quot;Killing Me Softly: Voluntary Euthanasia And The Road To The Peaceful Pill&quot;===
Published 2005. In reviewing the book, bioethicist Michael Cooke wrote &quot;Nitschke&#x27;s insight has been to recognise that assisted suicide is no longer about compassionate medicine, but about technology. Through his work on the web, he is gradually transforming voluntary euthanasia from a mere philosophy into an open-source internet enterprise.&quot;

===&quot;The Peaceful Pill Handbook&quot;===
The Peaceful Pill Handbook print edition was originally published in the U.S. in 2006, written by Nitschke and partner Fiona Stewart; the eHandbook version is updated six times a year. Prohibited or at limited sale in Australia and New Zealand.

In 2008 the on-line version of the handbook was launched. Called The Peaceful Pill eHandbook, it contains video clips on assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia methods such as barbiturates, over the counter drugs, gases and poisons.

* A German edition of the print book — Die Friedliche Pille — was published in 2011 and is published also online.
* A French edition — La Pilule Paisible — since re-titled Pilule Douce was published in June 2015 and is published also online.
* An Italian edition – La Pillola della Quiete was published in online format in 2017
* A Dutch edition – Handboek De Vredige Pil was published in print and online formats in 2018.

===&quot;Damned If I Do&quot;===
An autobiography (with Peter Corris); published by Melbourne University Press in 2013. Nitschke&#x27;s personal story from his early days, to his activist student days in Adelaide, to working with Aboriginal land rights groups in Australia&#x27;s Far North; to his successful campaign to have euthanasia legalised in Australia

==Film and television==
===&quot;Mademoiselle &amp; the Doctor&quot;===
A 2004 documentary film, &quot;Mademoiselle and the Doctor&quot;, focused on the quest of a retired Perth professor, Lisette Nigot, a healthy 79-year-old, to seek a successful method of voluntary euthanasia. She sought advice from Nitschke. Nigot took an overdose of medication which she had bought in the United States and died, not long before her 80th birthday. In a note to Nitschke thanking him for his support, she described him as a crusader working for a worthwhile humane cause. &quot;After 80 years of a good life, I have [had] enough of it&quot;, she wrote, &quot;I want to stop it before it gets bad.&quot;

===&quot;35 Letters&quot;===
In 2014 Nitschke featured in the documentary &quot;35 Letters&quot; about Australian woman Angelique Flowers. Angelique was a young member of Exit International. She was 30 years old when she died of bowel cancer. The film premiered at the Sydney Film Festival in 2014 where it won the Australian Foundation Award.

===&quot;Dignified Departure&quot;===
In 2009 Nitschke helped to promote &quot;Dignified Departure&quot;, a 13-hour, pay-television program on doctor-assisted suicide in Hong Kong and mainland China. The program aired in October in China on the Family Health channel, run by the official China National Radio.

<text>John Thomas Romney Robinson (23 April 1792 – 28 February 1882), usually referred to as Thomas Romney Robinson, was an Irish astronomer. He was the longtime director of the Armagh Observatory, one of the chief astronomical observatories in the UK of its time.

He is remembered as inventor of the 4-cup anemometer.

==Biography==
Robinson was born at St Anne&#x27;s in Dublin, the son of the English portrait painter Thomas Robinson (d. 1810) and his wife, Ruth Buck (d. 1826). He was educated at Belfast Academy then studied Divinity at Trinity College Dublin, where he was elected a Scholar in 1808, graduating BA in 1810 and obtaining a fellowship in 1814, at the age of 22. He was for some years a deputy professor of natural philosophy (physics) at Trinity.

Having been also ordained as an Anglican priest while at Trinity, he obtained the church livings of the Anglican Church at Enniskillen and at Carrickmacross in 1824. 

In 1823, now aged 30, he additionally gained the appointment of astronomer at the Armagh observatory. From then on he always resided at the Armagh observatory, engaged in researches connected with astronomy and physics, until his death in 1882.

During the 1840s and 1850s Robinson was a frequent visitor to the world&#x27;s most powerful telescope of that era, the so-called Leviathan of Parsonstown telescope, which had been built by Robinson&#x27;s friend and colleague William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse. Robinson was active with Parsons in interpreting the higher-resolution views of the night sky produced by Parsons&#x27; telescope, particularly with regard to the galaxies and nebulae and he published leading-edge research reports on the question. Back at his own observatory in Armagh, Robinson compiled a large catalogue of stars and wrote many related reports. In 1862 he was awarded a Royal Medal &quot;for the Armagh catalogue of 5345 stars, deduced from observations made at the Armagh Observatory, from the years 1820 up to 1854; for his papers on the construction of astronomical instruments in the memoirs of the Astronomical Society, and his paper on electromagnets in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy&quot;.

Robinson is also of note as the inventor of a device for measuring the speed of the wind, the Robinson cup-anemometer (1846).

He was president of the Royal Irish Academy from 1851 to 1856, and was a long-time active organiser in the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

Robinson was a friend of Charles Babbage, who said he was &quot;indebted&quot; for having reminded him about the first time he came up with the idea of the calculating machine.

==Family==
He married twice: firstly Eliza Isabelle Rambaut (d. 1839) and secondly Lucy Jane Edgeworth (1806–1897), the lifelong disabled daughter of the politician Richard Lovell Edgeworth. His daughter Mary Susanna Robinson married the physicist George Gabriel Stokes. Stokes frequently visited Robinson in Armagh in Robinson&#x27;s later years.

==Recognition==
On the Moon, Robinson (crater) is named in his honour.

A plant genus was named &quot;Romneya&quot; in commemoration of him by his friend Dr. Thomas Coulter c.1833. The common name of California Tree Poppy is given to the species Romneya coulteri. Source &#x27;Trees and Shrubs in the British Isles&#x27; 4th ed vol.IV. 1980

<text>The lily family, Liliaceae, consists of about 15 genera and 610 species of flowering plants within the order Liliales. They are monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, often bulbous geophytes. Plants in this family have evolved with a fair amount of morphological diversity despite genetic similarity. Common characteristics include large flowers with parts arranged in threes: with six colored or patterned petaloid tepals (undifferentiated petals and sepals) arranged in two whorls, six stamens and a superior ovary. The leaves are linear in shape, with their veins usually arranged parallel to the edges, single and arranged alternating on the stem, or in a rosette at the base. Most species are grown from bulbs, although some have rhizomes. First described in 1789, the lily family became a paraphyletic &quot;catch-all&quot; (wastebasket) group of lilioid monocots that did not fit into other families and included a great number of genera now included in other families and in some cases in other orders. Consequently, many sources and descriptions labelled &quot;Liliaceae&quot; deal with the broader sense of the family.

The family evolved approximately 68 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene epochs. Liliaceae are widely distributed, mainly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and the flowers are insect pollinated. Many Liliaceae are important ornamental plants, widely grown for their attractive flowers and involved in a major floriculture of cut flowers and dry bulbs. Some species are poisonous if eaten and can have adverse health effects in humans and household pets.

A number of Liliaceae genera are popular cultivated plants in private and public spaces. Lilies and tulips in particular have had considerable symbolic and decorative value, and appear frequently in paintings and the decorative arts. They are also an economically important product. Most of their genera, &quot;Lilium&quot; in particular, face considerable herbivory pressure from deer in some areas, both wild and domestic.

== Description ==


The diversity of characteristics complicates any description of the Liliaceae morphology, and confused taxonomic classification for centuries. The diversity is also of considerable evolutionary significance, as some members emerged from shaded areas and adapted to a more open environment (see Evolution).

=== General ===
The Liliaceae are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous in the case of Medeoleae) flowering plants with simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged (inflorescence) along the stem, developing from the base, or as a single flower at the tip of the stem, or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a mirror image. Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae. Both the petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups (whorls) of &#x27;petals&#x27;, that are often striped or multi-coloured, and produce nectar at their bases. The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is placed above the attachment of the other parts (superior). There are three fused carpels (syncarpus) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The embryo sac is of the &quot;Fritillaria&quot; type. The fruit is generally a wind dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.

=== Specific ===
; Inflorescence : Usually indeterminate (lacking terminal flower) as a raceme (&quot;Lilium&quot;); sometimes reduced to a single terminal flower (&quot;Tulipa&quot;). When pluriflor (multiple blooms), the flowers are arranged in a cluster or rarely are subumbellate (&quot;Gagea&quot;) or a thyrse (spike).

; Flowers : Hermaphroditic, actinomorphic (radially symmetric) or slightly zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetric), pedicellate (on a short secondary stem), generally large and showy but may be inconspicuous : (Medeoleae). Bracts may (bracteate) or may not (ebracteate) be present. The perianth is undifferentiated (perigonium) and biseriate (two whorled), formed from six tepals arranged into two separate whorls of three parts (trimerous) each, although &quot;Scoliopus&quot; has only three petals, free from the other parts, but overlapping. The tepals are usually petaloid (petal like) and apotepalous (free) with lines (striate) or marks in other colors or shades. The perianth is either homochlamydeous (all tepals equal, e.g. &quot;Fritillaria&quot;) or dichlamydeous (two separate and different whorls, e.g. &quot;Calochortus&quot;) and may be united into a tube. Nectar is produced in perigonal nectaries at the base of the tepals.

; Androecium : Six stamens in two trimerous whorls, with free filaments, usually epiphyllous (fused to tepals) and diplostemonous (outer whorl of stamens opposite outer tepals and the inner whorl opposite inner tepals), although &quot;Scoliopus&quot; has three stamens opposite the outer tepals. The attachment of the anthers to the filaments may be either peltate (to the surface) or pseudo-basifixed (surrounding the filament tip, but not adnate, that is not fused) and dehisce longitudinally and are extrorse (dehiscing away from center). The pollen is usually monosulcate (single groove), but may be inaperturate (lacking aperture: &quot;Clintonia&quot;, some &quot;Tulipa&quot; spp.) or operculate (lidded: &quot;Fritillaria&quot;, some &quot;Tulipa&quot; spp.), and reticulate (net patterned: &quot;Erythronium&quot;, &quot;Fritillaria&quot;, &quot;Gagea&quot;, &quot;Lilium&quot;, &quot;Tulipa&quot;).

; Gynoecium : Superior ovary (hypogynous), syncarpous (with fused carpels), with three connate (fused) carpels and is trilocular (three locules, or chambers) or unilocular (single locule, as in &quot;Scoliopus&quot; and &quot;Medeola&quot;). There is a single style and a three lobed stigma or three stigmata more or less elongated along the style. There are numerous anatropous (curved) ovules which display axile placentation (parietal in &quot;Scoliopus&quot; and &quot;Medeola&quot;), usually with an integument and thinner megasporangium. The embryo sac (megagametophyte) varies by genera, but is mainly tetrasporic (e.g. &quot;Fritillaria&quot;). Embryo sacs in which three of the four megaspores fuse to form a triploid nucleus, are referred to as &quot;Fritillaria-type&quot;, a characteristic shared by all the core Liliales.

; Fruit : A capsule that is usually loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but occasionally septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny and the lack of a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.

; Leaves : Simple, entire (smooth and even), linear, oval to filiform (thread-like), mostly with parallel veins, but occasionally net-veined. They are alternate (single and alternating direction) and spiral, but may be whorled (three or more attached at one node, e.g. &quot;Lilium, Fritillaria),&quot; cauline (arranged along the aerial stem) or sheathed in a basal rosette. They are rarely petiolate (stem attached before apex), and lack stipules. The aerial stem is unbranched.

; Genome : The Liliaceae include a species with one of the largest genome size within the angiosperms, &quot;Fritillaria assyriaca&quot; (1C=127.4 pg), while &quot;Tricyrtis macropoda&quot; is as small as 4.25 pg. Chromosome numbers vary by genus. Some genera like &quot;Calochortus&quot; (x=6-10), &quot;Prosartes&quot; (6,8,9,11), &quot;Scoliopus&quot; (7,8), &quot;Streptopus&quot; (8, 27) and &quot;Tricyrtis&quot; (12-13) have a small and variable number of chromosomes while subfamily Lilioideae have a larger and more stable chromosome number (12) as have the Medeoleae (7).

; Phytochemistry : The seeds contain saponins but no calcium oxalate raphide crystals, chelidonic acid (unlike Asparagales) or cysteine derived sulphur compounds (allyl sulphides), another distinguishing feature from the characteristic alliaceous odour of the Allioideae. &quot;Fritillaria&quot; in particular contains steroidal alkaloids of the cevanine and solanum type. Solanidine and solanthrene alkaloids have been isolated from some &quot;Fritillaria&quot; species. &quot;Tulipa &quot; contains tulipanin, an anthocyanin. (see also: Toxicology)

Characteristics often vary by habitat, between shade-dwelling genera (such as &quot;Prosartes&quot;, &quot;Tricyrtis&quot;, &quot;Cardiocrinum&quot;, &quot;Clintonia&quot;, &quot;Medeola&quot;, &quot;Prosartes&quot;, and &quot;Scoliopus&quot;) and sun loving genera. Shade-dwelling genera usually have broader leaves with smooth edges and net venation, and fleshy fruits (berries) with animal-dispersed seeds, rhizomes, and small, inconspicuous flowers while genera native to sunny habitats usually have narrow, parallel-veined leaves, capsular fruits with wind-dispersed seeds, bulbs, and large, visually conspicuous flowers. (See also &quot;Evolution&quot;).

== Taxonomy ==
The taxonomy of the Liliaceae has a very complex history. The family was first described in the eighteenth century, and over time many other genera were added until it became one of the largest of the monocotyledon families, and also extremely diverse. Modern taxonomic systems, such as the APG which is based on phylogenetic principles using molecular biology, have redistributed many of these genera resulting in the relatively small family that is currently recognised. Consequently, there are many different accounts of the Liliaceae in the literature and older uses of the term occur commonly. To distinguish between them, the Latin terms &quot;sensu lato&quot; and &quot;sensu stricto&quot; are frequently used (together with their abbreviations, &quot;s.l.&quot; and &quot;s.s.&quot;) to denote the broader or stricter sense of the circumscription respectively, e.g. Liliaceae &quot;s.s.&quot;.

=== History ===
The family Liliaceae was described by Michel Adanson in 1763 and formally named by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789. Jussieu defined this grouping as having a calyx of six equal colored parts, six stamens, a superior ovary, single style, and a trilocular (three-chambered) capsule. By 1845, John Lindley, the first English systematist, unhappily acknowledged the great diversity in the circumscription of the family, and that it had expanded vastly, with many subdivisions. As he saw it, the Liliaceae were already paraphyletic (&quot;catch-all&quot;), being all Liliales not included in the other orders, but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better. He recognized 133 genera and 1200 species. By the time of the next major British classification – that of Bentham and Hooker in 1883 (published in Latin) – several of Lindley&#x27;s other families had already been absorbed into the Liliaceae. Over time the family became increasingly broad and somewhat arbitrarily defined as all species of plants with six tepals and a superior ovary, eventually coming to encompass about 300 genera and 4,500 species within the order Liliales under the Cronquist system (1981). Cronquist merged the Liliaceae with the Amaryllidaceae, making this one of the largest monocotyledon families.

Many other botanists echoed Lindley&#x27;s earlier concerns about the phylogeny of the Liliaceae, but various schemes to divide the family gained little traction. Dahlgren (1985) suggested there were in fact forty – not one – families distributed over three orders (predominantly Liliales and Asparagales). In the context of a general review of the classification of angiosperms, the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. Considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabled a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants, as elaborated by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (1998).

=== Modern APG classification and phylogeny ===
The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) made rapid progress in establishing a modern monophyletic classification of the flowering plants by 2009. Despite establishing this relative degree of monophyly (genetic homogeneity) for the family Liliaceae, their morphology remains diverse and there exists within the Liliaceae clade or grouping, a number of subclades (subgroups). Particularly enigmatic were &quot;Clintonia&quot;, &quot;Medeola&quot;, &quot;Scoliopus&quot;, and &quot;Tricyrtis&quot;.

Of the fifteen genera within the Liliaceae, the ten genera of the Lilioideae subfamily form one morphological group that is characterised by contractile bulbs and roots, and a Fritillaria-type embryo-sac (megagametophyte with four megaspores). Within the Lilioideae, &quot;Clintonia&quot; and the closely related &quot;Medeola&quot; form a subclade, and are now considered a separate tribe (Medeoleae). The other major grouping consists of the five genera constituting the Streptopoideae (including &quot;Scoliopus&quot;) and Calochortoideae (including &quot;Tricyrtis&quot;) subfamilies characterised by creeping rhizomes, styles which are divided at their apices, and by megagametophyte development of the &quot;Polygonum&quot;-type (a simple megaspore and triploid endosperm) embryo-sac.
=== Evolution and biogeography ===
The development of a phylogenetic approach to taxonomy suggested the Liliales formed some of the earliest monocots. Molecular analysis indicates that divergence amongst the Liliales probably occurred around 82 million years ago. The closest sister family to the Liliaceae are the Smilacaceae with the Liliaceae separating 52 million years ago. Liliaceae thus arose during the late (Maastrichtian) Cretaceous to early (Paleocene) Paleogene periods. Major evolutionary clades include the Lilieae (&quot;Lilium, Fritillaria, Nomocharis, Cardiocrinum, Notholirion&quot;) from the Himalayas about 12 mya and the Tulipeae (&quot;Erythronium&quot;, &quot;Tulipa&quot;, &quot;Gagea&quot;) from East Asia at about the same time. The Medeoleae (&quot;Clintonia&quot; and &quot;Medeola&quot;) may have appeared in North America but were subsequently dispersed, as may have the Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae. Liliaceae fossils have been dated to the Paleogene and Cretaceous eras in the Antarctic.

The Liliaceae probably arose as shade plants, with subsequent evolution to open areas including deciduous forest in the more open autumnal period, but then a return of some species (e.g. &quot;Cardiocrinum&quot;). This was accompanied by a shift from rhizomes to bulbs, to more showy flowers, the production of capsular fruit and narrower parallel-veined leaves. Again, some reversal to the broader reticulate-veined leaves occurred (e.g. &quot;Cardiocrinum&quot;).

=== Subdivisions and genera ===
==== Suprageneric subdivisions ====
Due to the diversity of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae &quot;s.l.&quot;, many attempts have been made to form suprageneric classifications, e.g. subfamilies and tribes. Classifications published since the use of molecular methods in phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (Liliaceae &quot;s.s.&quot;). The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APweb) recognizes three subfamilies, one of which is divided into two tribes.

==== Genera ====

Various authorities (e.g. ITIS 16, GRIN 27, WCSP, NCBI, DELTA ) differ on the exact number of genera included in Liliaceae &quot;s.s.&quot;, but generally there are about fifteen to sixteen genera, depending on whether or not &quot;Amana&quot; is included in &quot;Tulipa&quot; and &quot;Lloydia&quot; in &quot;Gagea&quot;.

Currently the APWeb lists fifteen genera, arranged as shown in this table:

The largest genera are &quot;Gagea&quot; (200), &quot;Fritillaria&quot; (130), &quot;Lilium&quot; (110), and &quot;Tulipa&quot; (75 species), all within the tribe Lilieae.

=== Etymology and pronunciation===
The name &quot;Liliaceae&quot; () comes to international scientific vocabulary from Neo-Latin, from &quot;Lilium&quot;, the type genus, + &quot;&quot;, a standardized suffix for plant family names in modern taxonomy. The genus name comes from the Classical Latin word &quot;&quot;, &quot;lily&quot;, which in turn came from the Greek &quot;&quot; ().

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Liliaceae are widely distributed, but mainly in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The centre of diversity is from southwest Asia to China. Their distribution is diverse, mainly in plains, steppes, and alpine meadows, but also in deciduous forests, Mediterranean scrub and arctic tundra. &quot;Tulipa&quot; and &quot;Gagea&quot; provide examples of ornamental geophyte biomorphological types representing continental thermoperiodic zones (Irano-Turanian region), characterised by cessation of underground growth at high temperatures in early summer and requiring low winter temperatures for spring flowering. While some genera are shade-dwelling, such as the Medeoleae, and Streptopoideae, &quot;Tricyrtis&quot;, and &quot;Cardiocrinum&quot;, others prefer a more open habitat.

== Ecology ==
The Liliaceae are ecologically diverse. Species of Liliaceae bloom at various times from spring to late summer. The colorful flowers produce large amounts of nectar and pollen that attract insects which pollinate them (entomophily), particularly bees and wasps (hymenopterophily), butterflies (psychophily) and moths (phalaenophily). The seeds are dispersed by wind and water. Some species (e.g. &quot;Scoliopus&quot;, &quot;Erythronium and Gagea&quot;) have seeds with an aril structure that are dispersed by ants (myrmecochory).

The proliferation of deer populations in many areas, due to human factors such as the elimination of their animal predators and introduction to alien environments, is placing considerable herbivory pressure on many of the family&#x27;s species. Fences as high as 8 feet may be required to prevent them from consuming the plants, an impractical solution for most wild areas. Those of the genus &quot;Lilium&quot; are particularly palatable, while species in &quot;Fritillaria&quot; are repellant.

=== Pests and predators ===
Liliaceae are subject to a wide variety of diseases and pests, including insects, such as thrips, aphids, beetles and flies. Also fungi, viruses and vertebrate animals such as mice and deer. An important horticultural and garden pest is the scarlet lily beetle (Japanese red lily beetle, &quot;Lilioceris lilii&quot;) and other Lilioceris species which attack &quot;Fritillaria&quot; and &quot;Lilium&quot;. &quot;Lilium&quot; species may be food plants for the Cosmia trapezina moth. A major pest of Tulips is the fungus, &quot;Botrytis tulipae&quot;.

Both &quot;Lilium&quot; and &quot;Tulipa&quot; are susceptible to a group of five viruses of the family &quot;Potyviridae&quot;, specifically the potyvirus (named for &quot;potato virus Y)&quot; group, which includes the &quot;tulip-breaking virus&quot; (&quot;TBV&quot;) and the &quot;lily streak virus&quot; (lily mottle virus, &quot;LMoV&quot;) resulting in &#x27;breaking&#x27; of the color of the flowers. The viruses are transmitted by aphids. This breaking effect was of economic importance during the tulip mania of the seventeenth century, because it appeared to be producing new varieties. In modern times tulip breeders have produced varieties that mimic the effect of the virus, without being infected. One of these varieties is known as &#x27;Rembrandt&#x27;, after the Dutch artist of that name. Contemporary tulip owners commonly had Rembrandt and other artists paint their flowers to preserve them for posterity, hence the &#x27;broken&#x27; tulips were known as Rembrandt tulips at that time. Another modern variety is &#x27;Princess Irene&#x27;. One of the tulip breaking viruses is also named the &quot;Rembrandt tulip-breaking virus&quot; (ReTBV).

== Cultivation ==
=== Floriculture ===
Many species of Lilieae (in genera &quot;Tulipa&quot;, &quot;Fritillaria&quot;, &quot;Lilium&quot;, and &quot;Erythronium&quot;) and Calochortoideae (&quot;Calochortus&quot; and &quot;Tricyrtis&quot;) are grown as ornamental plants worldwide. Within these genera a wide range of cultivars have been developed by breeding and hybridisation. They are generally used in outdoor gardens and other displays, although in common with many bulbous flowering plants they are often induced to bloom indoors, particularly during the winter months. They also form a significant part of the cut flower market, in particular &quot;Tulipa&quot; and &quot;Lilium&quot;.

Tulips have been cultivated since at least the tenth century in Persia. Tulip production has two main markets: cut flowers and bulbs. The latter are used, in turn, to meet the demand for bulbs for parks, gardens, and home use and, secondly, to provide the necessary bulbs for cut flower production. International trade in cut flowers has an approximate total value of 11 billion euros, which provides an indication of the economic importance of this activity. The main producer of tulip bulbs is the Netherlands, a country that accounts for 87% of the global cultivated area, with approximately 12,000 hectares. Other leading producers include Japan, France and Poland. Approximately ten other countries produce commercial tulips, largely for the domestic market. By contrast, the Netherlands is the leading international producer, to the extent of 4 billion bulbs per annum. Of these, 53% are used for the cut flower market and the remainder for the dry bulb market. Of the cut flowers, 57% are used for the domestic market in the Netherlands and the remainder exported.

Original &quot;Tulipa&quot; species can be obtained for ornamental purposes, such as &quot;Tulipa tarda&quot; and &quot;Tulipa turkestanica&quot;. These are referred to as species, or botanical, tulips, and tend to be smaller plants but better at naturalising than the cultivated forms. Breeding programs have produced a wide range of tulip types, enabling blooming through a much longer season by creating early, mid- and late spring varieties. Fourteen distinct types are available in addition to botanical tulips, including Lily-flowered, Fringed, Viridiflora, and Rembrandt. In addition to blooming season, tulip varieties differ in shape and height, and exhibit a wide range of colours, both pure and in combination.

==== Lilies ====
The largest area of production is also the Netherlands, with 76% of the global cultivated area, followed by France, Chile, Japan, the United States, New Zealand and Australia. Approximately ten countries produce lilies commercially altogether. About half of the commercial production is for cut flowers. Many of these countries export bulbs as well as supplying the domestic market. The Netherlands produces about 2,200 million lily bulbs annually, of which 96% is used domestically and the remainder exported, principally within the European Union. One particularly important crop is the production of &quot;Lilium longiflorum&quot;, whose white flowers are associated with purity and Easter.

Although many &quot;Lilium&quot; species such as &quot;Lilium martagon&quot; and &quot;Lilium candidum&quot; can be obtained commercially, the majority of commercially available lilies represent the products of a very diverse hybridisation program, which has resulted in a separate horticultural classification, including such groupings as Asian, Oriental and Orienpet. In addition to a very wide variety of heights, lilies can be obtained in many colours and combinations of colours, and if properly selected can produce an extensive blooming season from early summer to autumn. Because of the history of Liliaceae, many species such as Watsonia (bugle lily) that were previously classified in this family bear the name &#x27;lily&#x27; but are neither part of the genus &quot;Lilium&quot;, or the family Liliaceae.

==== Other ====
A variety of &quot;Fritillaria&quot; species are used as early spring ornamental flowers. These vary from the large &quot;Fritillaria imperialis&quot; (crown imperial) available in a number of colours such as yellow or orange, to much smaller species such as &quot;Fritillaria meleagris&quot; or &quot;Fritillaria uva-vulpis&quot; with their chequered patterns. &quot;Erythronium&quot; is less common but a popular cultivar is &#x27;Pagoda&#x27; with its sulphur yellow flowers. &quot;Calochortus&quot; (mariposa lily) may be sold as a mixture or as cultivars.

=== Propagation ===
Methods of propagation include both sexual and asexual reproduction. Commercial cultivars are usually sterile.

==== Sexual reproduction ====
Seeds can be used for propagation of the plant or to create hybrids and can take five to eight years to produce flowering plants. Since interspecific cross-pollination occurs, overlapping wild populations can create natural hybrids.

==== Asexual reproduction ====
* Bulb offsets: Daughter bulbs that form on the mother bulb and can be detached.
* Micropropagation techniques including tissue culture.
* Bulbils, which are adventitious bulbs formed on the parent plant&#x27;s stem.
* Scaling and twin-scaling, used to increase production in slower-growing varieties, in which multiple whole scales are detached from a single bulb.

Bulb offsets and tissue culture produce genetic clones of the parent plant and thus maintaining genetic integrity of the cultivars. Bulb offsets usually require at least a year before flowering. Commercially, plants may be propagated in vitro and then planted out to grow into plants large enough to sell.

== Toxicology ==
While members of the Liliaceae &quot;s.s.&quot; have been used as food sources in humans, the bulbs of some species are poisonous to household pets (bulb toxicosis) if eaten and may cause serious complications, such as kidney failure in cats from Lilies, particularly &quot;Lilium longiflorum&quot; (Easter Lily). Dogs may develop less serious effects such as gastrointestinal problems and central nervous system depression. Most Fritillaria (e.g. &quot;Fritillaria imperialis&quot;, &quot;Fritillaria meleagris&quot;) bulbs contain poisonous neurotoxic alkaloids such as imperialin (peiminine), which may be deadly if ingested in quantity, while other species such as &quot;Fritillaria camschatcensis&quot; and &quot;Fritillaria affinis&quot; are edible. Tulips can cause skin irritation due to the presence of tuliposides and tulipalins, which are also found in the flowers, leaves and stems of &quot;Fritillaria&quot;. These are also toxic to a variety of animals.

== Uses ==
Fritillaria extracts are used in traditional Chinese medicine under the name &quot;chuan bei mu&quot;, and in Latin, &quot;bulbus fritillariae cirrhosae&quot;. The bulbs of &quot;Fritillaria roylei&quot; have been used as antipyretics and expectorants. &quot;Lilium&quot; bulbs, particularly Lanzhou lily (&quot;Lilium davidii&quot;) are used as food in China and other parts of Asia. During World War II, starvation conditions in the Netherlands (&quot;Hongerwinter&quot;, hunger winter 1944) led to using &quot;Tulipa&quot; bulbs as food. &quot;Calochortus&quot; bulbs were eaten by Native Americans and by the Mormon settlers in Utah during starvation. Other members of the family used for food include &quot;Clintonia&quot; (leaves), &quot;Medeola&quot; (roots), &quot;Erythronium&quot; (corms), and &quot;Fritillaria&quot; (bulbs).

== Culture ==

=== Lilies ===

The type genus, Lily (&quot;Lilium&quot;), has a long history in literature and art, and a tradition of symbolism as well as becoming a popular female name, and a floral emblem, particularly of France (fleur-de-lis). The cultivation of lilies has been described since at least the ninth century, when Charlemagne ordered it to be grown at his imperial palaces. However, the name &#x27;lily&#x27; has historically been applied to a wide variety of plants other than the genus &quot;Lilium&quot;.

The lily appears in ancient literature associated with both sovereignty and virginal innocence, and is mentioned on a number of occasions in the Bible, such as the description in Solomon&#x27;s Song of Songs (2, 1–2) &quot;&quot;I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the young women&quot; or the Gospel of Mathew (6, 28) &quot;Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin&quot;&quot; to represent beauty. Artistic representations can be found as far back as frescos from the second century BC, at Amnisos and Knossos. Early Christian churches, such as that of the Basilica of Sant&#x27; Apollinare in Classe were sometimes decorated with lilies. While predominantly depicted as white, those seen at Akrotiri are red lilies. The white lily has long been seen as a symbol of purity, coming to be associated with the Virgin Mary in the Middle Ages, from which came the name ‘Madonna lily’ (&quot;Lilium candidum&quot;). A well-known example is Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Annunciation&quot; (1472–1475) in which the archangel Gabriel bears a Madonna lily. Other symbolic meanings include glory, love and birth.

==== Fleur-de-lis ====
The stylised lily, or &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; (lily flower) has long been associated with royalty, although it may originally have been derived from the form of an iris. It has also been associated with the head of a spear. Its three parts have been associated with the three classes of mediaeval society, or alternatively faith, wisdom and chivalry. Whatever its exact derivation, it has come to be associated with France and the French monarchy since the earliest Frankish kings. Consequently, it became incorporated into not only French heraldry but also into many heraldic devices in jurisdictions where there had been historic French influence, such as Quebec and New Orleans. In modern times it appears in many forms, symbolic and decorative, and can be used on compasses to indicate the direction north, as well as the Scouting movement.

=== Tulips ===

Tulips (&quot;Tulipa&quot;) also have a long cultural tradition, particularly in the Islamic world. The Persian word for tulips, &quot;lâleh&quot; (), was borrowed into Turkish and Arabic as &quot;lale&quot;. In Arabic letters, &quot;lale&quot; is written with the same letters as &quot;Allah&quot;, and is used to denote God symbolically. Tulips became widely used in decorative motifs on tiles, fabrics, and ceramics in Islamic art and the Ottoman Empire in particular, and were revered in poetry, such as that of Omar Khayam in the twelfth century.

Tulips were an essential part of the gardens of Persia, having been cultivated from the Steppes. As the Seljuks – Oghuz-Turkic leaders originated from the steppes – moved to Persia, and then west, they took tulips with them to Turkey, where many escaped cultivation and became naturalised. Today there are a number of places in Turkey called &quot;Laleli&quot; (‘with tulips’). Tulips first appeared in the decorative arts in Turkey in the thirteenth century and flourished under the Ottomans, in particular in the royal palaces, and was adopted by the Osmans as their symbol. Further species were collected from Persia and the spreading Ottoman Empire saw to it that tulip culture also spread. By the sixteenth century it was a national symbol, hence the designation &quot;Tulip era&quot;, by which time they were becoming of economic importance.

By 1562 the tulip trade had reached Europe with the first shipment to Antwerp, where they were mistaken for vegetables, although they had been cultivated in Portugal since 1530, and first appeared in illustration in 1559, and the first tulip flowers were seen in the Netherlands in 1625. Tulips spread rapidly across Europe in the seventeenth century, and became an important trading item, initially in France before concentrating in the Netherlands. Eventually speculative trading in tulips became so intense as to cause a financial bubble which eventually collapsed, a period known as tulip mania (tulipomania), from 1634 to 1637, similar to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Tulip era.

Nevertheless, since then the tulip has become indelibly associated with the Netherlands and all things Dutch. it was during this period that the tulipiere, a ceramic vase for growing tulips indoors was devised, and the Golden Age of Dutch Painting was replete with images of tulips. Although tulip festivals are held around the world in the spring, the most famous of these is the display at Keukenhof. One of the better-known novels on tulips is &quot;The Black Tulip&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, père in 1850, dealing with a contest to grow a black tulip in late seventeenth-century Haarlem.

=== Other ===
&quot;Fritillaria&quot; are also often used as floral emblems, for instance as the county flower of Oxfordshire, UK. &quot;Calochortus nuttallii&quot;, the sego lily, is the official state flower of Utah.

<doc id="167884" wikidata="Q2349" url="?curid=167884" title="69 (sex position)">
<text>69 or sixty-nine is a sex position in which two people align themselves so that each person&#x27;s mouth is near the other&#x27;s genitals, allowing each partner to simultaneously perform oral sex on the other. The participants are thus mutually inverted like in the number 69 (), hence the code name. In this case, the numerals 6 and 9 are treated more as pictographic symbols than as numerical representations, with the bulbous part representing the heads of the performers.

The name is a translation of the original French, , which is also sometimes borrowed directly into English. The concept is that both partners can experience sexual stimulation and oral sensation simultaneously, but this can also distract those who try to focus solely on their own pleasure from giving oral sex well. The position can also be awkward for partners who are not similar in height.

==History==

The term &quot;sixty-nine&quot; or &quot;soixante-neuf&quot; for mutual simultaneous oral-genital stimulation is an English translation of the euphemistic French term, &quot;&quot;soixante-neuf&quot;.&quot; The term &quot;soixante-neuf&quot; has not been traced any earlier than the &quot;Whore&#x27;s Catechism&quot;s published in the 1790s in France, usually attributed to the early leader of the French Revolution, Mlle. Théroigne de Méricourt.

&quot;The earliest unequivocal representation of the sixty-nine appears to be that on an oil-lamp preserved in the Munich Museum (Deutsches Museum), and first reproduced in Dr. Gaston Vorberg&#x27;s ... portfolio, &quot;Die Erotik der Antiken in Kleinkunst und Keramik&quot; (Munich, 1921) plate 58, showing the woman lying on top of the man. Dr. Vorberg gives this ... to be of the period of the Roman Caesars ... . However, another oil-lamp of the same kind, showing the sixty-nine almost identically ... is more recently reproduced as a full-color plate, in Prof. Jean Marcadé&#x27;s &quot;Eros Kalos&quot; (English-language edition, Geneva : Nagel, 1965), facing page 58, in ... lamps preserved in the Heracleion Museum in Greece.&quot;

&quot;A Hindu temple-sculpture from the sacred caverns of the island of Elephanta, near Mumbai in India, showing this position with the man actually standing, and holding the woman hanging down in this from his shoulders, was ... brought to England in the late eighteenth century ... . ... this sculptured fragment ... is both discussed and illustrated in Richard Payne Knight&#x27;s &quot;A Discourse on the Worship of Priapus&quot;, privately issued for the Dilettanti Society of London in 1786 ... . The illustration in question is a detail engraving given in Payne Knight&#x27;s plate XI; and the full form of this sculptured group is ... given as plate XXIV.&quot;

The &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; mentions this sex position, albeit by a different name: &quot;When a man and woman lie down in an inverted order, i.e. with the head of the one towards the feet of the other and carry on [mouth] congress, it is called the &#x27;congress of a crow&#x27;.&quot;

=== Internet meme ===
In reference to the sex position, &quot;69&quot; has become an internet meme, where users will respond to any occurrence of the number with the word &quot;nice&quot; and draw specific attention to it. This means to sarcastically imply that the reference to the sex position was intentional. Because of its association with the sex position and resulting meme, &quot;69&quot; has become known as &quot;the sex number&quot; in these communities, similar to the number 420, which is known as &quot;the weed number.&quot;

==Variations==
Variations of the 69 position include mutual anilingus or &quot;double rimming&quot;, and digital penetration of either partner&#x27;s anus or vagina.

<doc id="167887" wikidata="Q333994" url="?curid=167887" title="Warren Hastings">
<text>Warren Hastings (6 December 1732 – 22 August 1818) was a British colonial administrator, who served as the first governor of the Presidency of Fort William (Bengal), the head of the Supreme Council of Bengal, and so the first governor-general of Bengal in 1772–1785. He and Robert Clive are credited with laying the foundation of the British Empire in India. He was an energetic organizer and reformer. In 1779–1784 he led forces of the East India Company against a coalition of native states and the French. In the end, the well-organized British side held its own, while France lost influence in India. In 1787, he was accused of corruption and impeached, but he was eventually acquitted in 1795 after a long trial. He was made a privy councillor in 1814.

==Early life and education==
Warren Hastings was born in Churchill, Oxfordshire, in 1732 to Reverend Penyston Hastings and his wife Hester (née Warren), who died soon after he was born. Within nine months of Warren&#x27;s birth, his father remarried and moved to Barbados, leaving behind Warren and his elder sister Anne. Young Warren was raised by his grandfather (also called Penyston) and attended a charity school in Daylesford, Gloucestershire. Eventually, he was taken in by his uncle, Howard Hastings, and moved with him to London in 1740.

Hastings attended Westminster School, where he coincided with the future prime ministers Lord Shelburne and the Duke of Portland and with the poet William Cowper. He quickly excelled as a top scholar but was forced to leave at sixteen, when his uncle died. He joined the British East India Company in 1750 as a writer (clerk) and sailed out to India, reaching Calcutta in August 1750. There he built up a reputation for diligence and spent his free time learning about India and mastering Urdu and Persian. His work won him promotion in 1752 when he was sent to Kasimbazar, a major trading post in Bengal, where he worked for William Watts. While there he gained further experience in the politics of East India.

British traders still relied on the whims of local rulers, so that the political turmoil in Bengal was unsettling. The elderly moderate Nawab Alivardi Khan was likely to be succeeded by his grandson Siraj ud-Daulah, but there were several other claimants. This made British trading posts throughout Bengal increasingly insecure, as Siraj ud-Daulah was known to harbour anti-European views and to be likely to launch an attack once he took power. When Alivardi Khan died in April 1756, the British traders and a small garrison at Kasimbazar were left vulnerable. On 3 June, after being surrounded by a much larger force, the British were persuaded to surrender to prevent a massacre. Hastings was imprisoned with others in the Bengali capital, Murshidabad, while the Nawab&#x27;s forces marched on Calcutta and captured it. The garrison and civilians were then locked up under appalling conditions in the Black Hole of Calcutta.
For a while, Hastings remained in Murshidabad and was even used by the Nawab as an intermediary; but, fearing for his life, he escaped to the island of Fulta, where a number of refugees from Calcutta had taken shelter. While there, he met, fell in love with, and married Mary Buchanan, the widow of Captain John Buchanan (one of the victims of the Black Hole of Calcutta). Shortly afterwards a British expedition from Madras under Robert Clive arrived to rescue them. Hastings served as a volunteer in Clive&#x27;s forces as they retook Calcutta in January 1757. After this swift defeat, the Nawab urgently sought peace and the war came to an end. Clive was impressed with Hastings when he met him and arranged for his return to Kasimbazar to resume his pre-war activities. Later in 1757, fighting resumed, leading to the Battle of Plassey, where Clive won a decisive victory over the Nawab. Siraj ud-Daulah was overthrown and replaced by his commander-in-chief Mir Jafar, who initiated policies favorable to the East India Company traders, before falling out with them and being overthrown.

==Rising status==
In 1758, Hastings became the British resident in the Bengal capital of Murshidabad – a major step forward in his career – at the instigation of Clive. His role in the city was ostensibly that of an ambassador but as Bengal came increasingly under the dominance of the East India Company he was often given the task of issuing orders to the new Nawab on behalf of Clive and the Calcutta authorities. Hastings personally sympathised with Mir Jafar and regarded many of the demands placed on him by the company as excessive. Hastings had already developed a philosophy that was grounded in trying to establish a more understanding relationship with India&#x27;s inhabitants and their rulers, and he often tried to mediate between the two sides.

During Mir Jafar&#x27;s reign, the East India Company exerted an increasingly large role in the running of the region, and effectively took over the defence of Bengal against external invaders when Bengal&#x27;s troops proved insufficient for the task. As he grew older, Mir Jafar became gradually less effective in ruling the state, and in 1760, EIC troops ousted him from power and replaced him with Mir Qasim. Hastings expressed his doubts to Calcutta over the move, believing they were honour-bound to support Mir Jafar, but his opinions were overruled. Hastings established a good relationship with the new Nawab and again had misgivings about the demands he relayed from his superiors. In 1761, he was recalled and appointed to the Calcutta council.

===Conquest of Bengal===

Hastings was personally angered when investigating trading abuses in Bengal. He alleged that some European and British-allied Indian merchants were taking advantage of the situation to enrich themselves personally. Persons travelling under the unauthorised protection of the British flag engaged in widespread fraud and illegal trading, knowing that local customs officials would be cowed into not interfering with them. Hastings felt this was bringing shame on Britain&#x27;s reputation and urged the authorities in Calcutta to put an end to it. The Council considered his report but ultimately rejected Hastings&#x27; proposals. He was fiercely criticised by other members, many of whom had themselves profited from the trade.

Ultimately, little was done to stem the abuses, and Hastings began to consider quitting his post and returning to Britain. His resignation was only delayed by the outbreak of fresh fighting in Bengal. Once on the throne Qasim proved increasingly independent in his actions, and he rebuilt Bengal&#x27;s army by hiring European instructors and mercenaries who greatly improved the standard of his forces. He gradually felt more confident, and in 1764, when a dispute broke out in the settlement of Patna, he captured its British garrison and threatened to execute them if the East India Company responded militarily. When Calcutta dispatched troops anyway, Mir Qasim executed the hostages. British forces then went on the attack and won a series of battles culminating in the decisive Battle of Buxar in October 1764. After this, Mir Qasim fled into exile in Delhi, where he died in 1777. The Treaty of Allahabad (1765) gave the East India Company the right to collect taxes in Bengal on behalf of the Mughal emperor.

Hastings resigned in December 1764 and sailed for Britain the following month. He left deeply saddened by the failure of the more moderate strategy that he had supported, but which had been rejected by the hawkish members of the Calcutta Council. Once he arrived in London, Hastings began spending far beyond his means. He stayed at fashionable addresses and had his picture painted by Joshua Reynolds even though, unlike many of his contemporaries, he had not amassed a fortune while in India. Eventually, having run up enormous debts, Hastings realised he needed to return to India to restore his finances, and applied to the East India Company for employment. His application was initially rejected as he had made many political enemies, including the powerful director Laurence Sulivan. Eventually, an appeal to Sulivan&#x27;s rival Robert Clive secured Hastings the position of deputy ruler at the city of Madras. He sailed from Dover in March 1769. On the voyage on board, the &quot;Duke of Grafton&quot; became ill, and he was cared for by the German Baroness Marian von Imhoff (1749–1837) and her husband. He fell in love with the Baroness, and they began an affair, seemingly with her husband&#x27;s consent. Hastings&#x27; first wife, Mary, had died in 1759, and he planned to marry the Baroness once she had obtained a divorce from her husband. The process took a long time and it was not until 1777 that news of the divorce came from Germany, and Hastings was finally able to marry her.

===Madras and Calcutta===
Hastings arrived in Madras shortly after the First Anglo-Mysore War of 1767–1769, when the forces of Hyder Ali had threatened the capture of the city. The Treaty of Madras (4 April 1769) ended the war but failed to settle the dispute and three further Anglo-Mysore Wars followed (1780–1799). During his time at Madras, Hastings initiated reforms of trading practices which cut out the use of middlemen and benefited both the Company and the Indian labourers, but otherwise the period was relatively uneventful for him.

By this stage, Hastings shared Clive&#x27;s view that the three major British presidencies (settlements) – Madras, Bombay and Calcutta – should be brought under single rule rather than being governed separately as they currently were. In 1772, he was appointed to be the governor of Calcutta, the most important of the presidencies. In Britain, moves were underway to reform the divided system of government and establish single rule across all of British-controlled regions in India with its capital in Kolkata (Calcutta). Hastings became the first governor general in 1773.

While governor, Hastings launched a major crackdown on bandits operating in Bengal, which proved largely successful. He also faced the severe Bengal famine, which resulted in between two and ten million deaths.

==Governor-General==
The Regulating Act 1773 brought the presidencies of Madras and Bombay under Bengal&#x27;s control. It raised Hastings from Governor to the new post of Governor-General, but limited his power by making the governor-general one member of a five-man Supreme Council. This was so confusingly structured that it was difficult to tell what constitutional position Hastings actually held.

According to William Dalrymple:

In 1774, Hastings assumed control of the East India Company&#x27;s opium monopoly. The same year, he sent Company troops to support the wazir of Oudh, Shuja-ud-Daula, in a campaign against the Rohillas, a people of Afghan origin. The Company troops were paid by the wazir for their assistance. This short campaign, while enlarging the Company&#x27;s main ally in northern India, was the first of several wars which harmed Hastings&#x27;s reputation.

===War in India===
In 1777, during the American War of Independence (1775–1783), the Americans had captured a British field army at the Battle of Saratoga during the Saratoga campaign. This emboldened the French to sign a military alliance with the new United States of America and declare war on Great Britain. The French concentrated in the Caribbean islands, and in India.

The presidencies of Madras and Bombay became involved in serious quarrels with the greatest of the native states. Madras with the formidable Hyder Ali of Mysore and with the Nizam of Hyderabad, and Bombay with the Marathas. France sent a fleet under Admiral Pierre André de Suffren. The combination meant Hastings faced a formidable challenge, with only Oudh as an ally. In six years of intense and confused fighting, from 1779 to 1784, Hastings sent one army marching across India to help Bombay, and another to Madras. His greatest achievement was in breaking up the hostile coalition. By 1782 he made peace with the Marathas. The French fleet had been repeatedly delayed. Suffren finally arrived in 1782 to discover that the Indian coalition had fallen apart, that Hastings had captured all the French ports, and Suffren could achieve nothing. When the wars ended in 1784, British rule in India had not changed, but the French position was now much weaker. The East India Company now had an efficient system in operation. However, Hastings&#x27;s multiple wartime operations needed large sums of money and London sent nothing. His methods of using the local treasuries later became the main line of attack in the impeachment brought against him.

===Bhutan and Tibet===
In 1773, Hastings responded to an appeal for help from the Raja of the princely state of Cooch Behar to the north of Bengal, whose territory had been invaded by Zhidar, the Druk Desi of Bhutan the previous year. Hastings agreed to help on the condition that Cooch Behar recognise British sovereignty. The Raja agreed and with the help of British troops they pushed the Bhutanese out of the Duars and into the foothills in 1773.

The Druk Desi returned to face civil war at home. His opponent Jigme Senge, the regent for the seven-year-old Shabdrung (the Bhutanese equivalent of the Dalai Lama), had supported popular discontent. Zhidar was unpopular for his corvee tax (he sought unreasonably to rebuild a major dzong in one year), as well as for his overtures to the Manchu emperors, who threatened Bhutanese independence. Zhidar was soon overthrown and forced to flee to Tibet, where he was imprisoned and a new Druk Desi, Kunga Rinchen, installed in his place. Meanwhile, the Sixth Panchen Lama, who had imprisoned Zhidar, interceded on behalf of the Bhutanese with a letter to Hastings, imploring him to cease hostilities in return for friendship. Hastings saw the opportunity to establish relations with both the Tibetans and the Bhutanese and wrote a letter to the Panchen Lama proposing &quot;a general treaty of amity and commerce between Tibet and Bengal&quot;.

In February 1782, news reached the headquarters of the EIC in Calcutta of the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama. Hastings proposed sending a mission to Tibet with a message of congratulation, designed to strengthen amicable relations established by Bogle on his earlier visit. With the assent of the EIC Court of Directors, Samuel Turner was appointed chief of the Tibet mission on 9 January 1783 with fellow EIC employee Samuel Davis as &quot;Draftsman &amp; Surveyor&quot;. Turner returned to the Governor-General&#x27;s camp at Patna in 1784 where he reported he had been unable to visit the Tibetan capital at Lhasa, but received a promise that merchants sent there from India would be encouraged.

Turner was instructed to obtain a pair of yaks on his travels, which he duly did. They were transported to Hasting&#x27;s menagerie in Calcutta and on the Governor-General&#x27;s return to England, the yaks went too, although only the male survived the difficult sea voyage. Noted artist George Stubbs subsequently painted the animal&#x27;s portrait as &quot;The Yak of Tartary&quot; and in 1854 it went on to appear, albeit stuffed, at The Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace in London.

Hasting&#x27;s return to England ended any further efforts to engage in diplomacy with Tibet.

==Impeachment==

In 1785, after 10 years of service, during which he helped extend and regularise the nascent British rule created by Clive of India, Hastings resigned. He was replaced by the Earl Cornwallis; Cornwallis served as Commander-in-Chief of British India and Governor of the Presidency of Fort William, also known as the Bengal Presidency.

On return to England, Hastings was impeached in the House of Commons for alleged crimes in India, notably embezzlement, extortion and coercion, and an alleged judicial killing of Maharaja Nandakumar. At first thought unlikely to succeed, the prosecution was managed by MPs including Edmund Burke, encouraged by Sir Philip Francis, whom Hastings had wounded during a duel in India, Charles James Fox and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. When the charges of the indictment were read, the 20 counts took Edmund Burke two full days to read. According to historian Mithi Mukherjee, the trial instituted debate between two radically opposed visions of empire – one based on ideas of power and conquest in pursuit of the exclusive national interests of the colonizer, and one represented by Burke, of sovereignty based on a recognition of the rights of the colonized.

Following the indictment by the House of Commons, Hastings was tried by his peers in the House of Lords; the trial started on 13 February 1788 and continued for 148 days of hearings over a period of seven years. These hearings continued at great personal cost to Hastings, who complained that he was being bankrupted by the cost of defending himself. He is rumoured once to have said that the punishment would have been less extreme had he pleaded guilty. The House of Lords acquitted him of all charges on 24 April 1795. The Company subsequently compensated him with £4,000 annually, retroactive to the date he returned to England, but did not reimburse his legal fees, which he claimed to have been £70,000. He collected the stipend for nearly 29 years. Throughout the years of the trial, Hastings lived in considerable style at his leased town house, Somerset House, Park Lane. He subsequently sold the lease at auction for £9,450.

Among many who supported him in print was the pamphleteer Ralph Broome. Others disturbed by the perceived injustice of the proceedings included Frances Burney.

Letters and journals of Jane Austen and her family, who knew Hastings, show that they followed the trial closely.

==Later life==
Hastings&#x27; supporters from the Edinburgh East India Club and a number of other gentlemen from India gave a reportedly &quot;elegant entertainment&quot; for Hastings when he visited Edinburgh. There was a toast to &quot;prosperity to our settlements in India&quot; and a wish that &quot;the virtue and talents which preserved them be ever remembered with gratitude.&quot;

In 1788, Hastings bought for £54,000 an estate at Daylesford, Gloucestershire, including the site of the Hastings family&#x27;s medieval seat. Thereafter he remodelled the house to designs by Samuel Pepys Cockerell with classical and Indian decoration and gardens landscaped by John Davenport. In 1801, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In 1816, he rebuilt the Norman church, where he was buried two years later. In spite of substantial compensation from the East India Company, Hastings was technically insolvent on his death.

==Administrative ethos and legacy==


In the last quarter of the 18th century, many senior administrators realised that to govern Indian society it was essential to learn its various religious, social, and legal customs and precedents. The importance of such knowledge to the colonial government was in Hastings&#x27; mind when he remarked in 1784, in his introduction to the English translation of the Bhagavad Gita by Wilkins:
During Hastings&#x27; term as governor-general, much administrative precedent was set, which profoundly shaped later attitudes towards the government of British India. Hastings had great respect for the ancient scripture of Hinduism and set the British position on governance as one of looking back to the earliest precedents possible. This allowed Brahmin advisors to mould the law, as no Briton thoroughly understood Sanskrit until Sir William Jones, and even then, a literal translation was of little use: it needed to be elucidated by religious commentators well versed in the lore and its application. This approach accentuated the Hindu caste system and to an extent the frameworks of other religions, which had at least in recent centuries been somewhat more flexibly applied. So British influence on the fluid social structure of India can largely be seen as a solidification of the privileges of the Hindu caste system through the influence of exclusively high-caste Hindu scholars advising the British on their laws. Where British translators or interpreters read in the Arthashastra a &quot;caste system&quot; in India, the actual wording speaks of &quot;varna&quot; and &quot;jati&quot;: skin-colour and birth, i.e. clan, and it speaks of the four societal classes, not castes: from upper-class Brahmin to lower-class Shudra.

In 1781, Hastings founded Madrasa &#x27;Aliya at Calcutta (transformed in 2007 into Aliah University by the Government of West Bengal). In 1784, he supported the foundation of the Bengal Asiatic Society, now the Asiatic Society of Bengal, by the oriental scholar Sir William Jones. This became a storehouse for information on the subcontinent and has remained in various institutional guises to the present day. Hastings&#x27; legacy as an administrator has been somewhat dualistic: as governor, he instituted reforms that would change the path India followed in subsequent years, but he retained the distinction of being also the &quot;architect of British India and the one ruler of British India to whom the creation of such an entity was anathema.&quot;

==Legacy==
The city of Hastings, New Zealand, and the Melbourne outer suburb of Hastings, Victoria, Australia, were named after him. There is also a road and the neighbourhood of Hastings, Kolkata, in India named after him.

&quot;Hastings&quot; is the name of one of the four schoolhouses in La Martiniere Calcutta (Kolkata). It is represented by the colour red. &quot;Hastings&quot; is also the name of one of the four schoolhouses in Bishop Westcott Girls&#x27; School, Ranchi, again represented by the colour red. &quot;Hastings&quot; is a senior wing house at St Paul&#x27;s School, Darjeeling, India, where all the senior wing houses are named after Anglo-Indian colonial figures.

RIMS &quot;Warren Hastings&quot; was a Royal Indian Marine troopship built by the Barrow Shipbuilding Co. and launched on 18 April 1893. The ship struck a rock and was wrecked off the coast of Réunion on the night of 14 January 1897.

==Literature==
Hastings took an interest in seeing the Bhagavad Gita translated into English. His efforts led to a first translation by Charles Wilkins appearing in 1785. He wrote the introduction to it which appeared on 4 October 1784 in Benares.

&quot;Warren Hastings and His Bull&quot;, a short story by the Indian writer Uday Prakash, was adapted for stage under the same title by the director Arvind Gaur. It presents Hastings&#x27;s interaction with traditional India in a work of socio-economic political satire.

A short story by the Hindi author Shivprasad Singh &#x27;Rudra&#x27; Kashikeya called &quot;Bahti Ganga&quot; features Chait Singh, then Raja of Banaras, in conflict with Hastings, who is imprisoned by the Raja, but escapes, though ordinary people of the city make fun of him.

The Hastings career is much discussed in the historical mystery novel, &quot;Secrets in the Stones&quot;, by Tessa Harris.

Hastings is named in Book 5 of George Eliot&#x27;s novel &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, where his greed for Daylesford is compared to the character Joshua Rigg&#x27;s greed for money.

Hastings was rumoured to be the biological father of Eliza de Feuillide, the daughter of Philadelphia Austen Hancock and a cousin of Jane Austen. Some scholars have seen parallels between Hastings and Colonel Brandon in Austen&#x27;s &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;: both left for India at age 17; both may have had illegitimate daughters named Eliza; both participated in a duel. Linda Robinson Walker argues that Hastings &quot;haunts &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; in the character of Colonel Brandon.&quot;

<text>Chocolate milk is a type of flavoured milk made by mixing cocoa solids with milk (either dairy or plant-based). It is a food pairing in which the milk&#x27;s mouthfeel masks the dietary fibres of the cocoa solids.

==Types==
The liquid carbohydrates in milks like cow milk, or oat milk, may be sufficient on its own to mask the bitterness from the theobromine. However, most often additional sweeteners are added to make the drink taste sweet.

However, the particles from cocoa solids in homemade chocolate milk will quickly sediment to the bottom. So the solution should be shaken or stirred before consumption to avoid uneven concentration. This is not a problem in some ready to drink chocolate milks.

=== Chocolate milk ===
Sugar used in commercial chocolate milk are used as preservative, and the energy from the sugar also makes it a convenience food. It can also be made at home by blending milk with cocoa powder and a sweetener (such as sugar or a sugar substitute), melted chocolate, chocolate syrup, or a pre-made powdered chocolate milk mix. Other ingredients, such as starch, salt, carrageenan, vanilla, or artificial flavoring are sometimes added. 
To add nutritional value to the product, sometimes some minerals like zinc oxide or iron are added.

In New York City, school food officials report that nearly 60 percent of the 100 million cartons served each year contain fat-free chocolate milk.

==== Negative health impact ====
Some nutritionists have criticized chocolate milk for its high sugar content and its relationship to childhood obesity. Because chocolate milk can contain twice as much sugar as plain low-fat milk from added sugars, some school districts have stopped serving the product altogether.

=== Dark chocolate milk ===
Dark chocolate milk has more cocoa solids than conventional chocolate milk. However, added sugar can still contribute to health problems.

==Source==

=== Drink mix ===
Drink mixes of cocoa powder and a sweetener can be either homemade or commercially manufactured.

===Ready to drink===
Ready to drink chocolate milk are produced by homogenization.

At or below room temperature, chocolate is a solid, which does not dissolve, but instead remains a powdered solid suspended in milk. The suspension must be stabilized, otherwise, the powder will settle. Separation can be slowed by any of the following:

* Reduce particle size, for example by tempering chocolate
* Reduce particle density, by incorporating air pockets
* Increase the viscosity of the milk, by adding thickening agents

Carrageenan is used at very low concentrations to form an imperceptible weak gel that prevents the large, dense particles of chocolate from sedimentation.

Ready to drink chocolate milk should be refrigerated like unflavored milk, except some ultra-high temperature (UHT) pasteurized drinks, which can be stored at room temperature. However, it is generally served cold. The nutritional qualities of chocolate milk are the subject of debate: while some studies criticize the high sugar content of chocolate milk, other studies suggest that chocolate milk is nutritionally superior to white.

====Disadvantage====
Ready to drink chocolate milk contains fewer antioxidants, caffeine, etc., due to oxidation from the water in the milk.

==Studies and research==

A number of studies have been issued in regard to chocolate milk nutrition. A 2005 study by the New York City Department of Education found that by removing whole milk and replacing it with low-fat or fat-free chocolate milk, students were served an estimated 5,960 fewer calories and 619 fewer grams of fat per year. However, more recent studies show that fat-free and low-fat milk may actually increase body fat and contribute to obesity. Whole milk may in fact be healthier for obese children than low-fat or non-fat milk.

An April 2007 study from Loughborough University indicated that low-fat milk was an effective rehydration drink.

A November 2009 study conducted by scientists in Barcelona, Spain, suggests that regularly consuming skimmed milk with cocoa rich in flavonoids may reduce inflammation and slow or prevent the development of atherosclerosis. The study notes that its effects are not as pronounced as seen in consumption of red wine. However, in a single serving of cocoa, other researchers found 611 milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of epicatechin equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine, and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in green tea.

A study published in 2009 compared chocolate milk to a commercial recovery beverage (matched for carbohydrate and protein content) administered to cyclists after intense workouts. The researchers found no difference in post-workout plasma creatine kinase levels and muscle soreness, nor in cycling time to exhaustion. However, since chocolate milk is usually less expensive than commercial recovery beverages, the researchers concluded that chocolate milk &quot;serves as a more convenient, cheaper ... recovery beverage option for many athletes&quot;.

A May 2010 sports nutrition study concluded that &quot;exercise recovery during short-term periods of heavy soccer training appears to be similar when isocaloric CM (Chocolate Milk) and CHO (Carbohydrate) beverages are consumed post-exercise&quot;.

Yet another study in 2011 at Kean University in New Jersey concluded similar results in male soccer players, discovering that there was an increase in time to fatigue when chocolate milk was consumed. The Kean University study also viewed chocolate milk&#x27;s effects on female soccer players undergoing morning and afternoon practices during preseason. They were either given the carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage or chocolate milk between morning and afternoon preseason practices. Following every afternoon practice, each athlete completed a shuttle run to fatigue. The study concluded that chocolate milk is just as beneficial as the carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage in promoting recovery in women.

===Calcium oxalate production===
Chocolate has oxalic acid, which reacts with the calcium in the milk producing calcium oxalate, thus preventing the calcium from being absorbed in the intestine. However, it is present in small enough amounts that the effect on calcium absorption is negligible (2–3%). As chocolate contains relatively small amounts of oxalate, it is unclear to what extent chocolate consumption affects healthy people with calcium-rich diets. 

In a 2008 study, participants who consumed one or more servings of chocolate on a daily basis had lower bone density and strength than those participants who ate a serving of chocolate six times a week or less. Researchers believe this may be due to oxalate inhibiting calcium absorption – but it could also be due to sugar content in chocolate, which may increase calcium excretion. It is clear, however, that consuming foods high in oxalate – and in turn their effect on calcium absorption – is a more significant concern for people with oxalate kidney stones, which occur when there is too much oxalate in the urine. These people especially should reduce their oxalate intake and increase their calcium intake. However, the high magnesium content in chocolate is likely to reduce the risk of stone formation, because like citrate, magnesium is also an inhibitor of urinary crystal formation.

==History==
Milk has probably been added to chocolate drinks since both ingredients were available to people. The first domesticated cattle were introduced to the Caribbean in 1493 by Christopher Columbus. Reciprocally, cocoa was introduced in Europe in the 1520s. The Natural History Museum lists Anglo-Irish botanist Hans Sloane as the inventor of drinking chocolate with milk. Sloane found the local Jamaican beverage consisting of cacao and water served to him in Jamaica unpalatable, but by adding milk to it, found it much improved. However, according to historian James Delbourgo, the Jamaicans were brewing &quot;a hot beverage brewed from shavings of freshly harvested cacao, boiled with milk and cinnamon&quot; as far back as 1494.

In the late 19th century, Swiss entrepreneur Daniel Peter developed a solid dehydrated version of chocolate milk so that it could be easily portioned, transported and conserved (fresh milk was rare in the cities). He eventually created milk chocolate in 1875.

<text>Karl Wolfskehl (17 September 1869 – 30 June 1948) was a German Jewish author and translator. He wrote poetry, prose and drama in German, and translated from French, English, Italian, Hebrew, Latin and Old/Middle High German into German.

==Biography==
Wolfskehl&#x27;s family had a long history in Germany. During the 10th century, one of his ancestors, a rabbi, had emigrated to Germany from Italy with the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II. Wolfskehl&#x27;s ancestors then settled in Mainz, where they lived for the next thousand years.

Karl Wolfskehl was born in Darmstadt, Germany, the son of the banker and politician . He studied Germanic languages and philology and a range of humanities courses in Giessen, Leipzig and Berlin. Under Otto Behaghel, he gained a PhD with a dissertation on a topic in German mythology.

In 1898 he married Hanna de Haan (1878-1946), daughter of the Dutch conductor at the Grand Ducal court theatre at Darmstadt. They had two daughters, Judith (born 1899) and Renate (born 1901).

He defined himself by pride in his German Jewish faith and heritage as well as in his roots in German literature and culture. He developed a lasting friendship with the poet Stefan George and was a leading figure in the poet&#x27;s circle of friends and followers. With the philosopher Ludwig Klages and the archaeologist Alfred Schuler, Wolfskehl formed the short-lived so-called Munich Cosmic Circle around 1900. His family&#x27;s wealth allowed Wolfskehl to pursue an independent career devoted to his literary, intellectual, and art related interests. Holding a jour fixe at his house, Wolfskehl became a central personality in the literary bohemia in Munich&#x27;s borough of Schwabing during the last two decades of the German Empire.

Amongst his friends and associates were Rainer Maria Rilke, Thomas Mann, Wassily Kandinsky, Franz Marc, Paul Klee, Alfred Kubin and Martin Buber.

In 1915, Wolfskehl bought an estate at Kiechlinsbergen an der Kaiserstuhl, in the wine country of the Grand Duchy of Baden. He and his family moved there in 1919 after he lost his family fortune due to the First World War and the ensuing inflation. He was forced to earn a living as a tutor in Italy and as an editor, cultural journalist and translator in Munich.

In 1933 appalled by Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, Wolfskehl left Germany for Switzerland the day after the Reichstag fire. Following Stefan George&#x27;s death on 3 December 1933, Wolfskehl and fellow Jewish member of the &quot;George-Kreis&quot; Ernst Morwitz were informed and attended the Master&#x27;s funeral in Minusio, Switzerland.

Wolfskehl moved on to Italy in 1934. During his years as a refugee, Karl Wolfskehl became a central figure in the anti-Nazi literary movement with German literature known as &quot;Exilliteratur&quot;.

In defiance of what Peter Hoffmann calls the Nazi Party&#x27;s &quot;absurd efforts&quot; to exclude him from the German people, Wolfskehl often said that wherever he was, there was the German &quot;Geist&quot; (&quot;Spirit&quot;). Also in 1934, Wolfskehl published a collection of poems titled, &quot;Die Stimme Spricht&quot; (&quot;A Voice Speaks&quot;), in which he affirmed his belief in Judaism and warned of the impending dangers posed by the Nazis. Some fellow members of the &quot;George-Kreis&quot;, however, feared that Wolfskehl&#x27;s denunciations of Nazism might put every other member of the Circle in very real physical danger.

In 1938, due to the rapprochement between Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, he moved to New Zealand with his partner Margot Ruben (1908–1980). There he became a staunch friend of the conductor Georg Tintner, also a refugee from Nazi Austria. He was granted New Zealand citizenship after World War II and remained there until his death in 1948.

<text>Editing is the process of selecting and preparing written, visual, audible, or cinematic material used by a person or an entity to convey a message or information. The editing process can involve correction, condensation, organization, and many other modifications performed with an intention of producing a correct, consistent, accurate and complete piece of work.

The editing process often begins with the author&#x27;s idea for the work itself, continuing as a collaboration between the author and the editor as the work is created. Editing can involve creative skills, human relations and a precise set of methods. Practicing editing can be a way to reduce language error in future literature works.
There are various editorial positions in publishing. Typically, one finds editorial assistants reporting to the senior-level editorial staff and directors who report to senior executive editors. Senior executive editors are responsible for developing a product for its final release. The smaller the publication, the more these roles overlap.

The top editor at many publications may be known as the chief editor, executive editor, or simply the editor. A frequent and highly regarded contributor to a magazine may acquire the title of editor-at-large or contributing editor. Mid-level newspaper editors often manage or help to manage sections, such as business, sports and features. In U.S. newspapers, the level below the top editor is usually the managing editor.

In the book publishing industry, editors may organize anthologies and other compilations, produce definitive editions of a classic author&#x27;s works (scholarly editor), and organize and manage contributions to a multi-author book (symposium editor or volume editor). Obtaining manuscripts or recruiting authors is the role of an &quot;acquisitions editor&quot; or a &quot;commissioning editor&quot; in a publishing house. Finding marketable ideas and presenting them to appropriate authors are the responsibilities of a sponsoring editor.

Copy editors correct spelling, grammar and align writings to house style. Changes to the publishing industry since the 1980s have resulted in nearly all copy editing of book manuscripts being outsourced to freelance copy editors.

At newspapers and wire services, press or copy editors write headlines and work on more substantive issues, such as ensuring accuracy, fairness, and taste. In some positions, they design pages and select news stories for inclusion. At British and Australian newspapers, the term is &quot;sub-editor&quot;. They may choose the layout of the publication and communicate with the printer. These editors may have the title of &quot;layout or design editor&quot; or (more so in the past) &quot;makeup editor&quot;.

In film editing, many techniques are available for use, however, using one doesn&#x27;t make your edit &#x27;better&#x27; than if it were not to be used.

==Scholarly books and journals==

Within the publishing environment, editors of scholarly books are of three main types, each with particular responsibilities:
* &quot;Acquisitions editor&quot; (or &quot;commissioning editor&quot; in Britain), who contracts with the author to produce the copy
* &quot;Project editor&quot; or &quot;production editor&quot;, who sees the copy through its stages from manuscript to bound book and usually assumes most of the budget and schedule responsibilities
* &quot;Copy editor&quot; or &quot;manuscript editor&quot;, who prepares the copy for conversion into printed form.

In the case of multi-author edited volumes, before the manuscript is delivered to the publisher it has undergone substantive and linguistic editing by the volume&#x27;s editor, who works independently of the publisher.

As for scholarly journals, where spontaneous submissions are more common than commissioned works, the position of &quot;journal editor&quot; or editor-in-chief replaces the acquisitions editor of the book publishing environment, while the roles of production editor and copy editor remain. However, another editor is sometimes involved in the creation of scholarly research articles. Called the authors&#x27; editor, this editor works with authors to get a manuscript fit for purpose before it is submitted to a scholarly journal for publication.

The primary difference between copy editing scholarly books and journals and other sorts of copy editing lies in applying the standards of the publisher to the copy. Most scholarly publishers have a preferred style that usually specifies a particular dictionary and style manual—for example, &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, the &quot;MLA Style Manual&quot; or the &quot;APA Publication Manual&quot; in the U.S., or the &quot;New Hart&#x27;s Rules&quot; in the U.K.

== Editing in the 21st century ==
Editing has a long history dating back to the earliest times of written language. Over time, editing has evolved greatly, particularly with the emergence of new forms of media and language that have led to a move towards multimodality. Today, hardcopies and print are no longer the main focus of editing as new content like film and audio require different kinds of edits.

Technical editing is now more commonly done using applications and websites on devices, which requires editors to be familiar with online platforms like Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Office, and Google Docs. The significance and intentions behind editing have also changed, moving beyond print due to the continuous advancements in technology. As a result, the grounds and values of editing have changed as well. For instance, text is often shortened and simplified online because of the preference for quick answers among this generation. Additionally, the advancement in social issues has made it possible to offer easy access to vast amounts of information.

Apart from editing written work, video editing has also evolved. Nowadays, non-linear editing is the main way of editing video clips, but in the 1900s, it was linear editing. As computer systems and software have developed, video clips are now able to be uploaded directly to the editing software, making the editing process quicker. With this evolution of editing, creativity has been sped up, editing has become easier, and there are now countless ways for writers to tell stories.

== Visual editing ==

In terms of editing visual content, the two main forms would be photo and cinematic. Photo editing has evolved considerably from humble means, dating back to the early 20th century. During the 1920s, photographers established a new discipline of creative editing by creating collages from multiple photos. By the late 1980&#x27;s, it became possible to computerize images by running physical photos through a scanner. Over time, software began to develop, aimed toward the manipulation of different qualities of a photo. Today, there are a multitude of applications to choose from to edit the content or qualities of photos; PhotoShop is a common example, as well as other applications such as Adobe Lightroom. Modern photo editing techniques include, but are not limited to linearization, white balance, noise reduction, tone reproduction and compression.

The other form of visual editing is cinematic editing. Cinematic editing entails anything that is to be used as cinematic material, mainly films. Cinematic editing dates back to the early 1900&#x27;s when American filmmaker, D.W. Griffith, produced the first films that essentially paved the way for the editing techniques that are still used today. The progression of technology brought about advancements in gear, which meant filmmakers were able to achieve new techniques in the post-production process through editing. Editors went from physically cutting and rearranging film to working on virtual timelines using software like Davinci Resolve or Premiere pro.

== Self-Editing ==
Self-editing is the process of evaluating one’s own writing and fixing errors, whether they be grammatical or difficult to understand. This does not require any specialized knowledge and simply aims to improve the overall quality of a literature work. It is an essential part of the editing process, benefiting both language learners and those writing in their native language.

Students often find learning about editing rewarding in both learning a language and improving language skills. However, the writing field currently debates whether self-editing is the best way to reduce errors in student writing. Some studies have shown that self-editing is more effective at reducing language errors in the short term than peer-editing. However, in the long term, both approaches have similar effects on students. Others have found that the collaborative dialogue provided by peer-editing may cause it to be much better at reducing language errors than self-editing.

Today, self-editing is being taught in numerous ways. Some researchers have found a significant improvement in student essays through self-editing worksheets. Others have experimented with mobile apps. Similar to the worksheets, these mobile based editing exercises have been shown to reduce error specifically in English learners’ papers. Just as applications like Google Docs and Grammarly can highlight grammatical errors, these applications may teach students to identify these mistakes, among others, by themselves.

While there hasn’t yet been a definitive answer on the best editing techniques to improve language errors, numerous studies have shown that learning to edit helps in both learning a language and improving native language skills.

==Technical editing==

Technical editing involves reviewing text written on a technical topic, identifying usage errors and ensuring adherence to a style guide. It aims to improve the clarity of the text or message from the author to the reader. Technical editing is actually the umbrella term for all the different kinds of edits that might occur.

Technical editing may include the correction of grammatical mistakes, misspellings, mistyping, incorrect punctuation, inconsistencies in usage, poorly structured sentences, wrong scientific terms, wrong units and dimensions, inconsistency in significant figures, technical ambivalence, technical disambiguation, statements conflicting with general scientific knowledge, correction of synopsis, content, index, headings and subheadings, correcting data and chart presentation in a research paper or report, and correcting errors in citations.

From basics to more critical changes, these adjustments to the text can be categorized by the different terms within technical editing. There are policy edits, integrity edits, screening edits, copy clarification edits, format edits and mechanical style edits, language edits, etc.

The two most common and broad are substantive editing and copy editing. Substantive editing is developmental because it guides the drafting process by providing essential building blocks to work off of. They work closely with the author to help supply ideas. Copy editing happens later in the drafting process and focuses on changing the text so that it&#x27;s consistent throughout in terms of accuracy, style, flow, and so on. This is usually the preferred editing for the surface-level cleaning up of work.

Large companies dedicate experienced writers to the technical editing function. Organizations that cannot afford dedicated editors typically have experienced writers peer-edit text produced by less experienced colleagues.

It helps if the technical editor is familiar with the subject being edited. The &quot;technical&quot; knowledge that an editor gains over time while working on a particular product or technology does give the editor an edge over another who has just started editing content related to that product or technology.

General essential skills include attention to detail, patience, persistence, the ability to sustain focus while working through lengthy pieces of text on complex topics, tact in dealing with writers, and excellent communication skills. Additionally, one does not need an English major to partake but language aptitude certainly helps.

==Editing services==
Editing is a growing field of work in the service industry. There is little career training offered for editors. Paid editing services may be provided by specialized editing firms or by self-employed (freelance) editors.

Editing firms may employ a team of in-house editors, rely on a network of individual contractors or both. Such firms are able to handle editing in a wide range of topics and genres, depending on the skills of individual editors. The services provided by these editors may be varied and can include proofreading, copy editing, online editing, developmental editing, editing for search engine optimization, etc.

Self-employed editors work directly for clients (e.g., authors, publishers) or offer their services through editing firms, or both. They may specialize in a type of editing (e.g., copy editing) and in a particular subject area. Those who work directly for authors and develop professional relationships with them are called authors&#x27; editors. There is hope for self-employed editors because all editing differs based on tradition, experience, education, personal style, values, etc.

<doc id="167899" wikidata="Q4492301" url="?curid=167899" title="Idiom dictionary">
<text>An idiom dictionary is a dictionary or phrase book that lists and explains idioms – distinctive words or phrases having a figurative meaning that goes beyond the original semantics of the words.

==Idioms==

An idiom is a phrase whose meaning could not be readily deduced from the meaning of its individual words. The word comes from the Greek &quot;ἰδίωμα&quot; (idioma) – the distinctive style of a particular person. The traditional example is &quot;kick the bucket&quot; which is normally understood to mean dying. The extent to which a phrase is thought idiomatic is a matter of degree and native speakers of English consider a phrase like &quot;pop the question&quot; (proposing marriage) to be less idiomatic than &quot;kick the bucket&quot;.

==Dictionary==
An idiom dictionary may be a traditional book or expressed in another medium such as a database within software for machine translation. Examples of the genre include &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot;, which explains traditional allusions and proverbs, and &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot;, which was conceived as an idiom dictionary following the completion of the &quot;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, which itself contained many idioms.
Some multilingual dictionaries of idioms are available on-line.
One of them is Babelite which is freely accessible.

The main readership and market for idiom dictionaries are deaf people and learners of English as a foreign language (EFL). The first major dictionary of idioms in American English was &quot;A Dictionary of Idioms for the Deaf&quot;; published in 1966 by the American School for the Deaf. Subsequent editions were published under the more general title of &quot;A Dictionary of American Idioms&quot;.

==Structure==
Idioms may vary considerably in their presentation. The keywords may vary – &quot;green fingers&quot; or a &quot;green thumb&quot;. The grammar may vary – &quot;turn the tables&quot; or &quot;the tables are turned&quot;. A phrase may even be recast completely, just following a pattern – &quot;a few gallons shy of a full tank&quot; or &quot;one sandwich short of a picnic&quot;. This variation makes organisation of an idiom dictionary difficult. The idioms may be organised in simple alphabetical order, as in &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Current Idiomatic English&quot;. They may be grouped by keyword, as in the &quot;Longman Dictionary of English Idioms&quot;. Or they may be grouped by domain so that, for example, all idioms based upon nautical expressions such as &quot;show him the ropes&quot; and &quot;three sheets to the wind&quot; are put together.

==Bilingual dictionaries==
Bilingual dictionaries have an additional problem when dealing with idioms – as well as explaining the idiom, they also have to translate it. In doing so, they will commonly provide both a literal translation and a free translation. For example, the phrase &quot;can be counted on the fingers of one hand&quot;, meaning few in number, may translated literally into Chinese as &quot;qu zhe ke shu&quot; and, more sensibly, as &quot;liao liao wu ji&quot; (only a handful).

<text>Merchant raiders are armed commerce raiding ships that disguise themselves as non-combatant merchant vessels.

==History==
Germany used several merchant raiders early in World War I (1914–1918), and again early in World War II (1939–1945). The captain of a German merchant raider, Felix von Luckner, used the sailing ship SMS &quot;Seeadler&quot; for his voyage (1916–1917). The Germans used a sailing ship at this stage of the war because coal-fired ships had limited access to fuel outside of territories held by the Central Powers due to international regulations concerning refueling of combat ships in neutral countries.

Germany sent out two waves of six surface raiders each during World War II. Most of these vessels were in the range. Many of these vessels had originally been refrigerator ships, used to transport fresh food from the tropics. These vessels were faster than regular merchant vessels, which was important for a warship. They were armed with six 15 cm (5.9 inch) naval guns, some smaller guns, torpedoes, reconnaissance seaplanes and some were equipped for minelaying. Several captains demonstrated great creativity in disguising their vessels to masquerade as allied or as neutral merchants.

The &quot;Kormoran&quot; fought the Australian light cruiser &quot;Sydney&quot; in a mutually destructive battle in November 1941.

Italy intended to outfit four refrigerated banana boats as merchant raiders during World War II (&quot;Ramb I&quot;, &quot;Ramb II&quot;, &quot;Ramb III&quot; and &quot;Ramb IV&quot;). Only &quot;Ramb I&quot; and &quot;Ramb II&quot; served as merchant raiders and neither ship sank enemy vessels due to naval presence in the Red Sea. The New Zealand cruiser &quot;Leander&quot; sank &quot;Ramb I&quot; off the Maldives (February 1941) while it tried to make for Japan; &quot;Ramb II&quot; did reach the Far East, where the Japanese prevented her from raiding, ultimately took her over and converted her to an auxiliary transport ship. (&quot;Ramb III&quot; served as a convoy escort until torpedoed and ended up as a German minelayer, and &quot;Ramb IV&quot; was converted for the Italian Royal Navy to a hospital ship.)

These commerce raiders carried no armour because their purpose was to attack merchantmen, not to engage warships—it would also be difficult to fit armour to a civilian vessel. Eventually most were sunk or transferred to other duties.

The British deployed Armed Merchant Cruisers (AMC) in World War I and in World War II. Generally adapted from passenger liners, they were larger than the German merchant raiders, were used as convoy escorts and did not disguise themselves. The British AMC &quot;Carmania&quot; sank the German SMS &quot;Cap Trafalgar&quot; which had been altered to look more like the &quot;Carmania&quot;.

During World War I, the British Royal Navy deployed Q-ships to combat German U-boats. Q-ships were warships posing as merchant ships so as to lure U-boats to attack them; their mission of destroying enemy warships differed significantly from the raider objective of disrupting enemy trade.

<text>A cultivar is a kind of cultivated plant that people have selected for desired traits and which retains those traits when propagated. Methods used to propagate cultivars include division, root and stem cuttings, offsets, grafting, tissue culture, or carefully controlled seed production. Most cultivars arise from deliberate human manipulation, but some originate from wild plants that have distinctive characteristics. Cultivar names are chosen according to rules of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP), and not all cultivated plants qualify as cultivars. Horticulturists generally believe the word &quot;cultivar&quot; was coined as a term meaning &quot;cultivated variety&quot;.

Popular ornamental plants like roses, camellias, daffodils, rhododendrons, and azaleas are commonly cultivars produced by breeding and selection or as sports, for floral colour or size, plant form, or other desirable characteristics. Similarly, the world&#x27;s agricultural food crops are almost exclusively cultivars that have been selected for characters such as improved yield, flavour, and resistance to disease, and since the advent of genetic engineering in the 1970&#x27;s, and its advent in crop breeding in the 1980&#x27;s, very few wild plants are used as commercial food sources. Trees used in forestry are also special selections grown for their enhanced quality and yield of timber, for example American timber company Weyerhaeuser is the leading grower of genetically modified Douglas-fir trees, one of the most commonly harvested trees.

Cultivars form a major part of Liberty Hyde Bailey&#x27;s broader group, the cultigen, which is defined as a plant whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity. A cultivar is not the same as a botanical variety, which is a taxonomic rank below subspecies, and there are differences in the rules for creating and using the names of botanical varieties and cultivars. Since the creation of the Plant Patent Act of 1930 the naming of cultivars has been complicated by the use of statutory patents for plants and recognition of plant breeders&#x27; rights.

The International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV – ) offers legal protection of plant cultivars to persons or organisations that introduce new cultivars to commerce. UPOV requires that a cultivar be &quot;distinct&quot;, &quot;uniform&quot;, and &quot;stable&quot;. To be &quot;distinct&quot;, it must have characters that easily distinguish it from any other named cultivar. To be &quot;uniform&quot; and &quot;stable&quot;, the cultivar must retain these characters in repeated propagation.

The naming of cultivars is an important aspect of cultivated plant taxonomy, and the correct naming of a cultivar is prescribed by the Rules and Recommendations of the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants&quot; (ICNCP, often called the &quot;Cultivated Plant Code&quot;). A cultivar is given a cultivar name, which consists of the scientific Latin botanical name followed by a cultivar epithet. The cultivar epithet is usually in a vernacular language, and must be so for cultivars named after 1 January 1959.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;cultivar&quot; originated from the need to distinguish between wild plants and those with characteristics that arose in cultivation, presently denominated &quot;cultigens&quot;. This distinction dates to the Greek philosopher Theophrastus (370–285 BC), the &quot;Father of Botany&quot;, who was keenly aware of this difference. Botanical historian Alan Morton noted that Theophrastus in his &quot;Historia Plantarum&quot; (&quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot;) &quot;had an inkling of the limits of culturally induced (phenotypic) changes and of the importance of genetic constitution&quot; (&quot;Historia Plantarum&quot;, Book 3, 2, 2 and &quot;Causa Plantarum&quot;, Book 1, 9, 3).

The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants uses as its starting point for modern botanical nomenclature the Latin names in Linnaeus&#x27; (1707–1778) &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; (tenth edition) and &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot; (fifth edition). In &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;, Linnaeus enumerated all plants known to him, either directly or from his extensive reading. He recognised the rank of varietas (botanical &quot;variety&quot;, a rank below that of species and subspecies) and he indicated these varieties with letters of the Greek alphabet, such as α, β, and δ, before the varietal name, rather than using the abbreviation &quot;var.&quot; as is the present convention. Most of the varieties that Linnaeus enumerated were of &quot;garden&quot; origin rather than being wild plants.

In time the need to distinguish between wild plants and those with variations that had been cultivated increased. In the nineteenth century many &quot;garden-derived&quot; plants were given horticultural names, sometimes in Latin and sometimes in a vernacular language. From &quot;circa&quot; the 1900s, cultivated plants in Europe were recognised in the Scandinavian, Germanic, and Slavic literature as &quot;stamm&quot; or &quot;sorte&quot;, but these words could not be used internationally because, by international agreement, any new denominations had to be in Latin. In the twentieth century an improved international nomenclature was proposed for cultivated plants.

Liberty Hyde Bailey of Cornell University in New York, United States created the word &quot;cultivar&quot; in 1923 when he wrote that:

In that essay, Bailey used only the rank of species for the cultigen, but it was obvious to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species, and that realisation appears to have motivated the suggestion of the new category of &quot;cultivar&quot;.

Bailey created the word &quot;cultivar&quot;. It is generally assumed to be a blend of cultivated&quot; and variety&quot; but Bailey never explicitly stated his choice of etymology, and it has been suggested that the word is actually a blend of cultigen&quot; and variety&quot;. The neologism &quot;cultivar&quot; was promoted as &quot;euphonious&quot; and &quot;free from ambiguity&quot;. The first &quot;Cultivated Plant Code&quot; of 1953 subsequently commended its use, and by 1960 it had achieved common international acceptance.

=== Cultigens ===


The words &quot;cultigen&quot; and &quot;cultivar&quot; may be confused with each other. A &quot;cultigen&quot; is any plant that is deliberately selected for or altered in cultivation, as opposed to an &quot;indigen&quot;; the &quot;Cultivated Plant Code&quot; states that cultigens are &quot;maintained as recognisable entities solely by continued propagation&quot;. Cultigens can have names at any of many taxonomic ranks, including those of grex, species, cultivar group, variety, form, and cultivar; and they may be plants that have been altered in cultivation, including by genetic modification, but have not been formally denominated. A cultigen or a component of a cultigen can be accepted as a cultivar if it is recognisable and has stable characters. Therefore, all cultivars are cultigens, because they are cultivated, but not all cultigens are cultivars, because some cultigens have not been formally distinguished and named as cultivars.

== Formal definition ==

The &quot;Cultivated Plant Code&quot; notes that the word cultivar is used in two different senses: first, as a &quot;classification category&quot; the cultivar is defined in Article 2 of the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants&quot; (2009, 8th edition) as follows: &quot;The basic category of cultivated plants whose nomenclature is governed by this Code is the cultivar.&quot; There are two other classification categories for cultigens, the grex and the group. The &quot;Code&quot; then defines a &quot;cultivar&quot; as a &quot;taxonomic unit within the classification category of cultivar&quot;. This is the sense of &quot;cultivar&quot; that is most generally understood and which is used as a general definition.

A cultivar may be given a vernacular name or a number.

== Different kinds ==

Which plants are chosen to be named as cultivars is simply a matter of convenience as the category was created to serve the practical needs of horticulture, agriculture, and forestry.

Members of a particular cultivar are not necessarily genetically identical. The &quot;Cultivated Plant Code&quot; emphasizes that different cultivated plants may be accepted as different cultivars, even if they have the same genome, while cultivated plants with different genomes may be regarded as the same cultivar. The production of cultivars generally entails considerable human involvement although in a few cases it may be as little as simply selecting variation from plants growing in the wild (whether by collecting growing tissue to propagate from or by gathering seed).

Cultivars generally occur as ornamentals and food crops: &quot;Malus&quot; &#x27;Granny Smith&#x27; and &quot;Malus&quot; &#x27;Red Delicious&#x27; are cultivars of apples propagated by cuttings or grafting, &quot;Lactuca&quot; &#x27;Red Sails&#x27; and &quot;Lactuca&quot; &#x27;Great Lakes&#x27; are lettuce cultivars propagated by seeds. Named cultivars of &quot;Hosta&quot; and &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; plants are cultivars produced by micropropagation or division.

=== Clones ===
Cultivars that are produced asexually are genetically identical and known as clones; this includes plants propagated by division, layering, cuttings, grafts, and budding. The propagating material may be taken from a particular part of the plant, such as a lateral branch, or from a particular phase of the life cycle, such as a juvenile leaf, or from aberrant growth as occurs with witch&#x27;s broom. Plants whose distinctive characters are derived from the presence of an intracellular organism may also form a cultivar provided the characters are reproduced reliably from generation to generation. Plants of the same chimera (which have mutant tissues close to normal tissue) or graft-chimeras (which have vegetative tissue from different kinds of plants and which originate by grafting) may also constitute a cultivar.

=== Seed-produced ===
Some cultivars &quot;come true from seed&quot;, retaining their distinguishing characteristics when grown from seed. Such plants are termed a &quot;variety&quot;, &quot;selection&quot;, or &quot;strain&quot; but these are ambiguous and confusing words that are best avoided. In general, asexually propagated cultivars grown from seeds produce highly variable seedling plants, and should not be labelled with, or sold under, the parent cultivar&#x27;s name.

Seed-raised cultivars may be produced by uncontrolled pollination when characteristics that are distinct, uniform and stable are passed from parents to progeny. Some are produced as &quot;lines&quot; that are produced by repeated self-fertilisation or inbreeding or &quot;multilines&quot; that are made up of several closely related lines. Sometimes they are F1 hybrids which are the result of a deliberate repeatable single cross between two pure lines. A few F2 hybrid seed cultivars also exist, such as &quot;Achillea&quot; &#x27;Summer Berries&#x27;.

Some cultivars are agamospermous plants, which retain their genetic composition and characteristics under reproduction. Occasionally cultivars are raised from seed of a specially selected provenance – for example the seed may be taken from plants that are resistant to a particular disease.

=== Genetically modified ===

Genetically modified plants with characteristics resulting from the deliberate implantation of genetic material from a different germplasm may form a cultivar. However, the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants notes, &quot;In practice such an assemblage is often marketed from one or more lines or multilines that have been genetically modified. These lines or multilines often remain in a constant state of development which makes the naming of such an assemblage as a cultivar a futile exercise.&quot; However, retired transgenic varieties such as the fish tomato, which are no longer being developed, do not run into this obstacle and can be given a cultivar name.

Cultivars may be selected because of a change in the ploidy level of a plant which may produce more desirable characteristics.

== Cultivar names ==

Every cultivar has a unique name within its denomination class (which is almost always the genus). Names of cultivars are regulated by the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants&quot;, and may be registered with an International Cultivar Registration Authority (ICRA). There are sometimes separate registration authorities for different plant types such as roses and camellias. In addition, cultivars may be associated with commercial marketing names referred to in the &quot;Cultivated Plant Code&quot; as &quot;trade designations&quot; (see below).

=== Presenting in text ===
A &quot;cultivar name&quot; consists of a botanical name (of a genus, species, infraspecific taxon, interspecific hybrid or intergeneric hybrid) followed by a cultivar epithet. The cultivar epithet is enclosed by single quotes; it should not be italicised if the botanical name is italicised; and each of the words within the epithet is capitalised (with some permitted exceptions such as conjunctions). It is permissible to place a cultivar epithet after a common name provided the common name is botanically unambiguous. Cultivar epithets published before 1 January 1959 were often given a Latin form and can be readily confused with the specific epithets in botanical names; after that date, newly coined cultivar epithets must be in a modern vernacular language to distinguish them from botanical epithets.

For example, the full cultivar name of the King Edward potato is &quot;Solanum tuberosum&quot; &#x27;King Edward&#x27;. &#x27;King Edward&#x27; is the cultivar epithet, which, according to the Rules of the &quot;Cultivated Plant Code&quot;, is bounded by single quotation marks. For patented or trademarked plant product lines developed from a given cultivar, the commercial product name is typically indicated by the symbols &quot;TM&quot; or &quot;®&quot;, or is presented in capital letters with no quotation marks, following the cultivar name, as in the following example, where &quot;Bloomerang&quot; is the commercial name and &#x27;Penda&#x27; is the cultivar epithet: &quot;Syringa&quot; &#x27;Penda&#x27; BLOOMERANG.

: Examples of correct text presentation:
:: &quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot; &#x27;Elegans&#x27;
:: &quot;Chamaecyparis lawsoniana&quot; &#x27;Aureomarginata&#x27; (pre-1959 name, Latin in form)
:: &quot;Chamaecyparis lawsoniana&quot; &#x27;Golden Wonder&#x27; (post-1959 name, English language)
:: &quot;Pinus densiflora&quot; &#x27;Akebono&#x27; (post-1959 name, Japanese language)
:: Apple &#x27;Sundown&#x27;

: Some incorrect text presentation examples:
:: &quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot; &quot;Elegans&quot; (double quotes are unacceptable)
:: &quot;Berberis thunbergii&quot; cv. &#x27;Crimson Pygmy&#x27; (this once-common usage is now unacceptable, as it is no longer correct to use &quot;cv.&quot; in this context; &quot;Berberis thunbergii&quot; &#x27;Crimson Pygmy&#x27; is correct)
:: &quot;Rosa&quot; cv. &#x27;Peace&#x27; (this is now incorrect for two reasons: firstly, the use of &quot;cv.&quot;; secondly, &quot;Peace&quot; is a trade designation or &quot;selling name&quot; for the cultivar &quot;R.&quot; &#x27;Madame A. Meilland&#x27; and should therefore be printed in a different typeface from the rest of the name, without quote marks, for example: &quot;Rosa&quot; codice_1)

Although &quot;cv.&quot; has not been permitted by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants since the 1995 edition, it is still widely used and recommended by other authorities.

== Group names ==

Where several very similar cultivars exist they can be associated into a &quot;Group&quot; (formerly &quot;Cultivar-group&quot;). As Group names are used with cultivar names it is necessary to understand their way of presentation. Group names are presented in normal type and the first letter of each word capitalised as for cultivars, but they are not placed in single quotes. When used in a name, the first letter of the word &quot;Group&quot; is itself capitalised.

=== Presenting in text ===
:: &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot; Capitata Group (the group of cultivars including all typical cabbages)
:: &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot; Botrytis Group (the group of cultivars including all typical cauliflowers)
:: &quot;Hydrangea macrophylla&quot; Groupe Hortensia (in French) = &quot;Hydrangea macrophylla&quot; Hortensia Group (in English)
: Where cited with a cultivar name the group should be enclosed in parentheses, as follows:
:: &quot;Hydrangea macrophylla&quot; (Hortensia Group) &#x27;Ayesha&#x27; 

== Legal protection of cultivars and their names ==
Since the 1990s there has been an increasing use of legal protection for newly produced cultivars. Plant breeders expect legal protection for the cultivars they produce. According to proponents of such protections, if other growers can immediately propagate and sell these cultivars as soon as they come on the market, the breeder&#x27;s benefit is largely lost.
Legal protection for cultivars is obtained through the use of Plant breeders&#x27; rights and plant Patents but the specific legislation and procedures needed to take advantage of this protection vary from country to country.

=== Controversial use of legal protection for cultivars ===
The use of legal protection for cultivars can be controversial, particularly for food crops that are staples in developing countries, or for plants selected from the wild and propagated for sale without any additional breeding work; some people consider this practice unethical.

=== Trade designations and selling names ===

The formal scientific name of a cultivar, like &quot;Solanum tuberosum&quot; &#x27;King Edward&#x27;, is a way of uniquely designating a particular kind of plant. This scientific name is in the public domain and cannot be legally protected. Plant retailers may wish to increase their share of the market, and one way of doing this is to replace the Latin scientific names on plant labels in retail outlets with appealing marketing names that are easy to use, pronounce, and remember. Marketing names lie outside the scope of the &quot;Cultivated Plant Code&quot; which refers to them as &quot;trade designations&quot;. If a retailer or wholesaler has the sole legal rights to a marketing name then that may offer a sales advantage. Plants protected by plant breeders&#x27; rights (PBR) may have a &quot;true&quot; cultivar name – the accepted scientific name in the public domain – and a &quot;commercial synonym&quot; – an additional marketing name that is legally protected. An example would be &quot;Rosa&quot; = &#x27;Poulmax&#x27;, in which &quot;Rosa&quot; is the genus, is the trade designation, and &#x27;Poulmax&#x27; is scientific cultivar name.

Because a name that is attractive in one language may have less appeal in another country, a plant may be given different selling names from country to country. Quoting the original cultivar name allows the correct identification of cultivars around the world.

The main body coordinating plant breeders&#x27; rights is the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (, UPOV) and this organisation maintains a database of new cultivars protected by PBR in all countries.

== International Cultivar Registration Authorities ==
An &quot;International Cultivar Registration Authority&quot; (ICRA) is a voluntary, non-statutory organisation appointed by the &quot;Commission for Nomenclature and Cultivar Registration&quot; of the International Society of Horticultural Science. ICRAs are generally formed by societies and institutions specializing in particular plant genera such as &quot;Dahlia&quot; or &quot;Rhododendron&quot; and are currently located in Europe, North America, China, India, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Puerto Rico.

Each ICRA produces an annual report and its reappointment is considered every four years. The main task is to maintain a register of the names within the group of interest and where possible this is published and placed in the public domain. One major aim is to prevent the duplication of cultivar and Group epithets within a genus, as well as ensuring that names are in accord with the latest edition of the &quot;Cultivated Plant Code&quot;. In this way, over the last 50 years or so, ICRAs have contributed to the stability of cultivated plant nomenclature. In recent times many ICRAs have also recorded trade designations and trademarks used in labelling plant material, to avoid confusion with established names.

New names and other relevant data are collected by and submitted to the ICRA and in most cases there is no cost. The ICRA then checks each new epithet to ensure that it has not been used before and that it conforms with the &quot;Cultivated Plant Code&quot;. Each ICRA also ensures that new names are formally established (i.e. published in hard copy, with a description in a dated publication). They record details about the plant, such as parentage, the names of those concerned with its development and introduction, and a basic description highlighting its distinctive characters. ICRAs are not responsible for assessing the distinctiveness of the plant in question. Most ICRAs can be contacted electronically and many maintain web sites for an up-to-date listing.

<text>Bahamasair Holdings Limited (stylised: bahamasaır) is an airline headquartered in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, located on the island of New Providence. It is the national airline of The Bahamas and operates scheduled services to 32 domestic and regional destinations in the Caribbean and the United States from its base at Lynden Pindling International Airport.

== History ==
===Early years===
Bahamasair was established by the Bahamas Government and started operations on 17 June 1973 by acquiring the routes of Flamingo Airlines and the operations and routes of Out Island Airways (OIA). During the early 1970s, both Flamingo Airlines and Out Island Airways were operating scheduled passenger services, Flamingo with British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets, Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops and Convair 340 and Douglas DC-3 prop aircraft while Out Island was operating Fairchild Hiller FH-227 and de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops. Out Island later operated the BAC One-Eleven jet as well.

The first Bahamasair flight was to Andros Island and the second to Freeport, Grand Bahama. The Bahamas Government purchased 51% of OIA and became the majority shareholder and part owner, then renamed the airline Bahamasair. The other owners were Edward Albury, Gil Hensler and Sherlock Hackley who had 49%. After a few years the Government had purchased the shares of Gil Hensler and Sherlock Hackley. The only Bahamian owner of OIA still maintaining some shares was Edward Albury.

Bahamasair initially encountered operating difficulties, including poor maintenance facilities, economic conditions and company structure. Those factors brought public distrust as a consequential added problem. However, jet airliners started to arrive in the shape of new BAC One-Eleven twin jets including the stretched series 500 model, followed by one brand new Boeing 737-200, and in 1973, it opened its first service to the US, from Nassau to Tampa, Florida.

Also in 1973, the government&#x27;s vision of several airlines discontinuing service to Nassau became a reality, when US carrier Pan American World Airways as well as other airlines decided to stop operating to the Bahamas. This enabled Bahamasair to capture a substantial part of the Bahamas scheduled air transport market.

Through the rest of the 1970s, Bahamasair kept adding flights to other cities in Florida and, domestically, the presence of the airline also grew rapidly. According to the February 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide (OAG), interisland flights were operated with Fairchild Hiller FH-227 and STOL capable de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops and also with one Douglas DC-3 prop aircraft. This same OAG also lists four daily round trip flights between Nassau and Freeport operated by Bahamasair with BAC One-Eleven twin jets.

=== 1980s ===

During the early 1980s, Bahamasair unsuccessfully tried to expand to the Northeast United States, opening flights to Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Newark, New Jersey. But in 1989, the airline&#x27;s directors decided that those routes were not profitable and eliminated them from the airline&#x27;s schedule. Also in 1989, the first of two Boeing 727-200s came into the fleet. That was also the year that a new livery and workers&#x27; uniform were introduced. The Boeing 727s, however, could not be kept in service long because of political favors and interference, thereby causing the company to lose vast sums of money in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, de Havilland Canada Dash 8 turboprop aircraft were purchased to replace the whole jet fleet and the Boeing 737-200s were taken out of service. According to the September 15, 1994 Official Airline Guide (OAG), most flights were being operated with Dash 8 turboprops although Short 360 turboprops and Cessna 402 prop aircraft were being operated in scheduled service as well. The Dash 8 was being flown on all scheduled services between the Bahamas and Florida at this time according to this OAG. In 1997, the Boeing 737s returned to service because key routes warranted the cargo and passenger carrying capabilities offered by these jetliners. The 737-200 was deployed to Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Orlando as well as one domestic route, being Nassau-Freeport.

===Development since the 2000s===

In November 2011, the government discussed plans to replace the Bahamasair Boeing 737-200s with more fuel efficient and cost effective aircraft. However, it was said that pre-owned 
Boeing 737-500s may serve as a replacement for the then current jet fleet. In 2012, Bahamasair confirmed it would be taking delivery of two Boeing 737-500s with a 120-passenger all-economy class layout. The first aircraft was delivered on 30 March 2012 and put into service in April 2012. The second 737-500 was delivered on 21 June 2012. Bahamasair retired its last two Boeing 737-200s in September 2012 and received a third Boeing 737-500 in March 2014.

In May 2015, it was reported that the loss-making airline was in a phase of restructuring to gain profitability as advised by the government. This included new union agreements as well as a planned renewal of the ageing fleet. Shortly after, Bahamasair ordered five new ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft to replace all of its Bombardier Dash 8s.

The airline took delivery of the first ATR 72–600 on 27 November 2015.

==Accidents and incidents==
As of 2024, Bahamasair has not suffered a fatal accident since its founding in 1973. However, three aircraft have been lost in non-fatal accidents and a weather event:

* On 31 July 1978, a Fairchild Hiller FH-227 impacted the runway of Chub Cay International Airport seconds after take-off with its gear already retracted. It skidded on the runway and came to a halt, but was damaged beyond repair. There were no fatalities.
* On 12 October 1998, a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 was damaged beyond repair by Hurricane Mitch while resting on the apron in Nassau.
* On 20 April 2007, a Bombardier Dash 8-300 suffered a failure of the left main gear while landing at Governor&#x27;s Harbour Airport, causing the aircraft to skid on the runway until coming to a halt. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and written off. None of the 48 passengers and 3 crew members were harmed.
* On 14 March 2017, an ATR 72-600 sustained substantial damage after being struck by a violent tornado at Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport, Bahamas. The left hand main landing gear collapsed.

<text>José &quot;King&quot; Roman (born December 17, 1946) is a Puerto Rican former boxer who was Puerto Rico&#x27;s first world heavyweight championship challenger. He is known as &quot;Joe King Roman.&quot; He holds notable victories over Manuel Ramos and ex-Light Heavyweight champion Vicente Rondon.

==Pro career==
In Roman&#x27;s early career, he achieved mixed results. He defeated people like Jack O&#x27;Halloran and Chuck Wepner but lost to Jack Bodell. After the Bodell loss, Roman had a win-streak, defeating O&#x27;Halloran once again and besting Manuel Ramos. He lost to Robie Harris but put together a streak of wins before fighting George Foreman.

=== Foreman Fight ===
In late August 1973, he travelled to Tokyo, Japan, to challenge world Heavyweight champion George Foreman, losing by a knockout in the first round on September 1. Roman&#x27;s corner protested that Foreman hit him while Roman was down, although no action was taken on this complaint. Photos exist that seem to corroborate Roman&#x27;s corner&#x27;s version of events. Even though he lost, he made history by becoming the first Puerto Rican to challenge for the world&#x27;s Heavyweight championship. The only fellow Puerto Ricans to challenge for the heavyweight championship are Ossie Ocasio, Fres Oquendo and John Ruiz, who later became the first Latino to hold a version of the heavyweight championship.

=== Afterwards ===
Roman held a win over former WBA world Light Heavyweight champion Vicente Rondon just after the Foreman fight, his first win afterwards. In 1975 he lost to Mike Quarry and later in the year he began a series of losses. He lost seven times, notably losing to Jimmy Young. Roman was defeated by Boone Kirkman afterwards, in 1977, but never achieved a notable fight afterwards, having a mixed record.

==Retirement==
Roman retired in 1981 with a record of 54 wins, 27 losses and 4 draws, with 27 knockout wins. He used to work at a Sweetbay Supermarket in Tampa, Florida. Ossie Ocasio and Fres Oquendo also challenged for the world&#x27;s heavyweight championship, both are also from Puerto Rico. Ruiz was born in the USA of Puerto Rican ancestry.

==Professional boxing record==

==Personal==
He has a daughter, Selina, who is an artist. There is a mural in Tampa Bay that depicts him and dr. Ferdie Pacheco, a well-known television boxing pundit.

<doc id="167918" wikidata="Q706482" url="?curid=167918" title="British Free Corps">
<text>The British Free Corps (abbr. BFC; ) was a unit of the of Nazi Germany during World War II, made up of British and Dominion prisoners of war who had been recruited by Germany. The unit was originally known as the Legion of St George. Research by British historian Adrian Weale has identified 54 men who belonged to this unit at one time or another, some for only a few days. At no time did it reach more than 27 men in strength.

==Formation==

The idea for the British Free Corps came from John Amery, a British fascist, son of the serving British Secretary of State for India, Leo Amery. John Amery travelled to Berlin in October 1942, and proposed to the Germans the formation of a British volunteer force to help fight the Bolsheviks. The British volunteer force was to be modelled after the (Legion of French Volunteers against Bolshevism), a French collaborationist force fighting with the German . In addition to touting the idea of a British volunteer force, Amery actively tried to recruit Britons. He made a series of pro-German propaganda radio broadcasts, appealing to his fellow countrymen to join the war on communism.

The first recruits to the Corps came from a group of prisoners of war (POWs) at a &#x27;holiday camp&#x27; set up by the Germans in Genshagen, a suburb of Berlin, in August 1943. In November 1943, they were moved to a requisitioned café in the Pankow district of Berlin. Recruits also came from an interrogation camp at Luckenwalde in late 1943. The Corps became a military unit on 1 January 1944, under the name &#x27;The British Free Corps&#x27;. In the first week of February 1944, the BFC moved to the St Michaeli Kloster in Hildesheim, a small town near Hanover. Uniforms were issued on 20 April 1944 (Hitler&#x27;s 55th birthday). On 11 October 1944, the Corps was moved to the Pioneer school in Dresden, to start military training for service on the Eastern Front. On 24 February 1945, they travelled from Dresden to Berlin, where they stayed in a requisitioned school on the Schönhauser Allee. On 8 March 1945, they were moved to the village of Niemegk, a few miles to the south-west of Berlin.

Recruiting for the Free Corps was done in German POW camps. In 1944, leaflets were distributed to the POWs, and the unit was mentioned in &quot;Camp&quot;, the official POW newspaper published in Berlin. The unit was promoted &quot;as a thoroughly volunteer unit, conceived and created by British subjects from all parts of the Empire who have taken up arms and pledged their lives in the common European struggle against Soviet Russia&quot;.

The attempted recruitment of POWs was done amid German fear of the Soviets; the Germans were &quot;victims of their own propaganda&quot; and thought that their enemies were as worried about the Soviets as they were. In one Dutch camp, cigarettes, fruit, and other items were lavished on the POWs while they listened to Nazi propaganda officers who described the good that the Germans were doing in Europe, then asked the men to join in fighting the real enemy, the Soviets.

==Commanders==
The BFC did not have a &quot;commander&quot; &quot;per se&quot; as it was the intention of the SS to appoint a British commander when a suitable British officer came forward. However, three German Waffen-SS officers acted as the (&quot;liaison officer&quot;) between the , which was responsible for the unit and the British volunteers, and in practice they acted as the unit commander for disciplinary purposes at least. These were:

* Hans Werner Roepke: September 1943 – November 1944
* Dr Walter Kühlich: November 1944 – April 1945
* Dr Alexander Dolezalek: April 1945

A number of sources mention the involvement of Brigadier Leonard Parrington, a British Army officer captured by the Germans in Greece in 1941. This was based on a misunderstanding by some of the British volunteers after Parrington in the summer of 1943 had visited the POW &quot;holiday camp&quot; at Genshagen, in the southern suburbs of Berlin, as representative of the Senior British POW, Major General Victor Fortune. Parrington had told the assembled prisoners that he &quot;knew the purpose of the camp&quot; and the BFC volunteers who were there took this to mean that he approved of the unit. In reality, Parrington had accepted Genshagen at face value as a rest centre for POWs.

==Members==
Leading members of the Corps included Thomas Haller Cooper (although he was actually an in the proper), Roy Courlander, Edwin Barnard Martin, Frank McLardy, Alfred Minchin and John Wilson – these men &quot;later became known among the renegades as the &#x27;Big Six&#x27;, although this was a notional elite whose membership shifted periodically as members fell into, and out of, favour.&quot;

In 2002, it was claimed that Robert Chipchase, an Australian, was by then the last surviving member of the British Free Corps. He commented that he had changed his mind about joining and refused to sign the enlistment papers, spending the rest of the war in a punishment camp.

==Preparation for active service==
In March 1945, a BFC detachment was deployed with the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland under Joachim Ziegler, which was composed largely of Scandinavian volunteers and attached to the III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps under Felix Steiner. They were first sent from Stettin to the division&#x27;s headquarters at Angermünde. &quot;From there they were sent to join the divisional armoured reconnaissance battalion () located in Grüssow [on the island of Usedom]. The battalion commander was Rudolf Saalbach ... [The BFC were allocated] to the 3rd Company, under the command of the Swedish Hans-Gösta Pehrson.&quot; The BFC contingent was commanded by (squad leader) Douglas Mardon, who used the alias &quot;Hodge&quot;. Richard W. Landwehr Jr. states &quot;The Britons were sent to a company in the detachment that was situated in the small village of Schoenburg near the west bank of the Oder River&quot;.

On 16 April 1945, the Corps was moved to Templin, where they were to join the transport company of Steiner&#x27;s HQ staff ( Steiner). When the Nordland Division left for Berlin, &quot;the transport company followed Steiner&#x27;s Headquarters to Neustrelitz and the BFC went with it.&quot; On 29 April, Steiner decided &quot;to break contact with the Russians and order his forces to head west into Anglo-American captivity.&quot; Thomas Haller Cooper and Fred Croft, the last two members of the Corps, surrendered on 2 May to the 121st Infantry Regiment (United States) in Schwerin, and were placed in the loose custody of the GHQ Liaison Regiment (known as Phantom).

==Courts-martial==
Newspapers of the period give details of the court-martial of several Commonwealth soldiers involved in the Corps. One Canadian captive, Private Edwin Barnard Martin, said he joined the Corps &quot;to wreck it&quot;. He designed the flag and banner used by the Corps, and admitted to being one of the original six or seven members of the Corps during his trial. He was given a travel warrant and a railway pass which allowed him to move around Germany without a guard. He was found guilty of two charges of aiding the enemy while a prisoner of war.

New Zealand soldier Roy Courlander claimed at his court-martial that he joined the Corps for similar reasons, to gather intelligence on the Germans, to foster a revolution behind the German lines, or to sabotage the unit if the revolution failed.

John Amery was sentenced to death in November 1945 for high treason, and hanged on 19 December 1945.

==In popular culture==
*The film &quot;Joy Division&quot; (2006) portrays a member of the BFC, Sergeant Harry Stone, among the German troops and refugees fleeing the Red Army advance into Germany. In the film it is the aggressive Stone who appears to be the only convinced Nazi remaining among the Hitler Youth with whom he is grouped. He is seen attempting to recruit British POWs before the column is attacked by Soviet aircraft.
*Jack Higgins&#x27; novel &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; portrays a BFC officer named Harvey Preston, who is patterned on Douglas Berneville-Claye. He is attached to the unit which attempts to kidnap Winston Churchill. A convinced Nazi and petty criminal, Preston is viewed with disgust by all members of the German unit.
*On TV, the British Free Corps was a subject for &quot;The Hide&quot;, the final episode of series 6 of the British TV series &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;, in which a British POW who had joined the BFC was tried for treason in Great Britain once he returned home, after surviving the firebombing of Dresden.

<doc id="167920" wikidata="Q1020014" url="?curid=167920" title="Lancing, West Sussex">
<text>Lancing is a large coastal village and civil parish in the Adur district of West Sussex, England, on the western edge of the Adur Valley. It occupies part of the narrow central section of the Sussex coastal plain between smaller Sompting to the west, larger Shoreham-by-Sea to the east, and the parish of Coombes to the north. Excluding definitive suburbs it may have the largest undivided village cluster in Britain. However, its economy is commonly analysed as integral to the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation. Its settled area beneath the South Downs National Park covers , the majority of its land.

The Lancing area is characterised by mid-rise coastal urban homes, farmland, and wildlife reserves of the northern chalk downs and River Adur estuary. There are non-religious structures that date back to the early 16th century. The population in 2002 was approximately 19,000. In the 2011 census the population for Lancing and Coombes was recorded as 18,810.

The village was a popular seaside resort in the mid-19th century. Summer tourist hallmarks are the traditional guesthouses on the A259 coast road (Brighton Road), as well as a caravan/campsite in Old Salts Farm Road, and beach chair hire and ice cream businesses.

==Location==
There is a shingle beach with good stretches of clean sand at low water. Part of the coast road does not directly adjoin the sea but instead the long and narrow Widewater, a rare brackish lagoon, and the only known location of the probably extinct Ivell&#x27;s sea anemone. Immediately north of the developed area is Lancing Ring, a Nature Reserve in the South Downs National Park. To the north of that is farmed agricultural downland connected to Lancing College Farm. On its eastern side is Shoreham Airport, the world&#x27;s oldest continually operated airport, which was an RAF base in World War II.

The village&#x27;s boundary with Sompting to the west has historically been along Boundstone Lane, named after the boundstone or boundary stone that marked the boundary. The stone is now kept at Boundstone Nursery School, Upper Boundstone Lane, having previously been kept at Boundstone Community College, which has now been closed and transformed into The Sir Robert Woodard Academy. Much of Lancing&#x27;s northern boundary with the village of Coombes runs along the Ladywell Stream, a tributary of the River Adur which runs from the South Downs near to Lancing College. The source of the Ladywell Stream, the Ladywell Spring, is believed to be an ancient holy well or sacred stream with pre-Christian significance.

==History==
In 1828, remains of what may be an Iron Age shrine and to its west a later Romano-British temple were found just west of Lancing Ring. The Romano-British temple was located within an oval temenos and seems to have been built in the 1st century AD. A track has existed since Celtic British times which ran from Chanctonbury Ring via Cissbury Ring to Lancing Ring and from then on to a probable ford across the River Adur by the modern Sussex Pad, close to the Old Tollbridge at Old Shoreham. Among this lowest lying farmland to the east of the village proper are remains of medieval salt workings. The Roman road from &quot;Noviomagus Reginorum&quot; (Chichester) to &quot;Novus Portus&quot; (probably Portslade near Brighton) also ran through modern North Lancing (along the Street) down to the ford.

===1800–1945===
Much of the land which is residential was formerly taken up by family-run market gardening businesses growing fruit or flowers for the Brighton Market or Covent Garden in London. The largest businesses were &quot;Sparks&quot; who grew fruit such as tomatoes and &quot;Young&#x27;s&quot; which produced carnations. Chrysanthemums were grown by Frank Lisher on land south of The Finches, in a house that he had built. &quot;Nash&#x27;s&quot; fruit growers produced grapes under huge glass that could be rolled into place on a rail track.

Lancing railway station opened with what is now known as the West Coastway Line in 1849. Between 1908 and 1912 the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway developed its railway wagon and carriage works in the area that is now the Lancing Business Park, closed in 1965 as part of British Rail&#x27;s Beeching Plan of 1963. The land on which the works were sited was predominantly turned over to this park, which is also known as the Churchill Industrial Estate.

Few buildings pre-dating 1820 are here, however one example is a central former farmhouse, which is now a home named Monks Farm Presbytery on North Road.

===Since 1945===
Following World War II market gardening gave way to housing as diets became more exotic and more difficult to ripen fruits such as grapes began to be imported in greater numbers; this growth was most rapid between 1945 and 1970, with more muted housing growth following on in most years. The village has a large business park, and many smaller local business establishments. In economics and transport, the suburb forms part of the linear and diverse Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation.

==Etymology==
Lancing probably means &quot;the people of Wlanc&quot; or &quot;people of Hlanc&quot;. Like many places throughout this part of Sussex, Lancing has an &quot;-ing&quot; ending, meaning &quot;people of&quot;. &quot;Wlanc&quot; seems to mean proud or imperious, while &quot;Hlanc&quot; seems to mean lank or lean. The suggestion that Lancing takes its name from the Wlencing or Wlenca, the son of the South Saxon king Ælle, has been discounted.

==Landmarks==
Shoreham Tollbridge is a Grade II* listed building which was the last toll bridge in use in Sussex. The bridge was in use for motorised traffic until the opening of the A27 flyover over the Adur in 1970. The bridge is in the east of the parish, crossing the Adur into Shoreham.

Shoreham Airport, the oldest licensed airfield in the UK, opened in 1911, is in the parish.

Lancing College, see below, has a predominantly 19th Century chapel that is the largest school chapel in the world with the largest stained-glass rose window in England (completed in 1977).

==Education==
The local senior school, The Sir Robert Woodard Academy, is located just inside the contiguous village of Sompting. It is a mixed comprehensive of around 1,400 students from ages 11–18. The site was formerly occupied by Boundstone Community College.

In the north-east of the parish on the Downs lies Lancing College, an independent school and major landmark.

There are also three primary schools. Seaside Primary (formerly Freshbrook First School and Thornberry Middle School) is on Freshbrook Road and The Globe Primary (formerly The Willows First School and Oakfield Middle School) is on Irene Avenue. These two schools were formed in 2008-9 when each of the previous middle schools joined with the nearest of the first schools in Lancing. North Lancing Primary School has always been a first and middle school.

==Literary connections==
Lancing was visited by Oscar Wilde in the 1890s when he stayed at nearby Worthing. The working title for his masterpiece &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; was &quot;Lady Lancing&quot;. Wilde&#x27;s friend and lover, the poet Lord Alfred Douglas lived in nearby Brighton and died while staying at Monk&#x27;s Farmhouse mentioned above. Lancing was also visited by another poet, Algernon Charles Swinburne, who stayed at The Terrace in the 1880s.

==Sport==
===Football===
Premier League club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion train at Mash Barn Lane, Lancing. Some of Albion&#x27;s fixtures in the Premier League Under 21 competition are played here. Nearby are situated semi-professional Worthing who play in the National League South.

Teams in the village cover all ages of adult and junior games:

Lancing F.C. is based at the Culver Road 3G Ground, owned by Sussex County FA, and also Monks Recreation Ground. Lancing F.C. is the village&#x27;s main club, formed in 1941, and is currently playing in the Isthmian League South East Division.

Lancing United FC are the second largest adult male football club in the local area and they play their matches at Croshaw Recreation Ground, Boundstone Lane. Their home pavilion was a project led by two local hero’s Glenn Souter and Joby Pannell it is currently sponsored by Middleton Estates.

Lancing F.C., Lancing United Colts F.C. and Lancing Rangers F.C. are the three local youth football clubs supporting football for all male and females aged from U6 - 18, playing their matches at a number of different football pitches found within Lancing and Sompting.

The Sussex County Football Association is based at Culver Road in the village and they share ownership of the newly built 3G pitch at Culver Road with Lancing F.C..

===Cricket===
Two clubs play, Lancing Lads Official and Lancing Manor Cricket Club who play at the ground near the junction of the A27 and Manor Road.

==People==
The writer Ted Walker was born in Lancing in 1934 and grew up at 186, Brighton Road, by the Widewater. His autobiographical work, &quot;The High Path&quot; takes its name from the footpath that ran between Brighton road and the Widewater, and which was formerly a public right of way.

As a child, heavyweight boxer Sir Henry Cooper was evacuated from London to Lancing, along with identical twin brother George.

Many well-known figures attended Lancing College, including novelists Tom Sharpe and Evelyn Waugh, lyricist Tim Rice, singer Peter Pears and comedian Adam Buxton.

<text>Tarmacadam is a concrete road surfacing material made by combining tar and macadam (crushed stone and sand), patented by Welsh inventor Edgar Purnell Hooley in 1902. It is a more durable and dust-free enhancement of simple compacted stone macadam surfaces invented by Scottish engineer John Loudon McAdam in the early 19th century. The terms &quot;tarmacadam&quot; and tarmac are also used for a variety of other materials, including tar-grouted macadam, bituminous surface treatments and modern asphalt concrete.

==Origins==
Macadam roads pioneered by Scottish engineer John Loudon McAdam in the 1820s are prone to rutting and generating dust. Methods to stabilise macadam surfaces with tar date back to at least 1834 when John Henry Cassell, operating from &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Patent Lava Stone Works&quot; in Millwall, England, patented &quot;lava stone.&quot; This method involved spreading tar on the subgrade, placing a typical macadam layer, and finally sealing the macadam with a mixture of tar and sand. Tar-grouted macadam was in use well before 1900 and involved scarifying the surface of an existing macadam pavement, spreading tar and re-compacting. Although the use of tar in road construction was known in the 19th century, it was little used and was not introduced on a large scale until the motorcar arrived on the scene in the early 20th century. Ironically, although John Loudon McAdam himself had been a supplier of coke for Britain&#x27;s first Coal-Tar factory, he never in his own lifetime advocated for the use of tar as a binding agent for his road designs, preferring free-draining materials (see the page Macadam).

In 1901, Edgar Purnell Hooley was walking in Denby, Derbyshire, when he noticed a smooth stretch of road close to an ironworks. He was informed that a barrel of tar had fallen onto the road and someone poured waste slag from the nearby furnaces to cover up the mess. Hooley noticed this unintentional resurfacing had solidified the road, and there was no rutting and no dust. Hooley&#x27;s 1902 patent for tarmac involved mechanically mixing tar and aggregate before lay-down and then compacting the mixture with a steamroller. The tar was modified by adding small amounts of Portland cement, resin and pitch. Nottingham&#x27;s Radcliffe Road became the first tarmac road in the world. In 1903 Hooley formed Tar Macadam Syndicate Ltd and registered tarmac as a trademark.

==Later developments==
As petroleum production increased, the by-product bitumen became available in greater quantities and largely supplanted coal tar. The macadam construction process quickly became obsolete because of the onerous and impractical manual labour required. The somewhat similar tar and chip method, also known as bituminous surface treatment (BST) or chipseal, remains popular.

While the specific tarmac pavement is not common in some countries today, many people use the word to refer to generic paved areas at airports, especially the apron near airport terminals, although these areas are often made of concrete. Similarly in the UK, the word &quot;tarmac&quot; is much more commonly used by the public when referring to asphalt concrete.

<text>Like Mike is a 2002 American sports comedy film directed by John Schultz and written by Michael Elliot and Jordan Moffet. Starring Lil&#x27; Bow Wow, Morris Chestnut, Jonathan Lipnicki, Brenda Song, Robert Forster, Crispin Glover, and Eugene Levy, the film follows an orphan who gets basketball talents after finding an old pair of sneakers that once belonged to Michael Jordan.

It was produced by NBA Productions, and features cameo appearances by NBA players. The film was released on July 3, 2002, by 20th Century Fox, three years after Jordan left the Chicago Bulls, one year before Jordan retired for the third (and last) time from the NBA, and during his playing career with the Washington Wizards (Jordan&#x27;s first retirement was 1993).

&quot;Like Mike&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. In later years, the film became a fan favorite among basketball fans.

This film, co-starring Brenda Song was released just 5 days after her previous film &quot;Get a Clue&quot; premiered on Disney Channel.

== Plot ==
13-year-old Calvin Cambridge and his two best friends, Murph and Reg Stevens, live in an orphanage in Los Angeles. At night, they all have to sell chocolate for the troublesome orphanage director, Stan Bittleman, at the STAPLES Center, after each home game of the NBA team, the Los Angeles Knights (a parody of the Los Angeles Clippers). Calvin meets the team&#x27;s coach, who is impressed by Calvin&#x27;s knowledge of basketball and honesty about the chocolates, and offers Calvin tickets for the next game. Inside a thrift store donation box, Calvin finds a pair of old sneakers with the initials &quot;MJ&quot; written on them; once worn by Michael Jordan. A jealous bully named Ox steals the sneakers and throws them onto an overhead power line. When Calvin tries to retrieve them that night during a rainstorm, he is shocked by a lightning bolt.
The next day, Calvin and his friends attend the game between the Knights and the Minnesota Timberwolves. During a halftime contest, Calvin&#x27;s ticket number is called and he goes one-on-one with the Knights&#x27; star player, Tracy Reynolds. He ends the contest with a slam dunk after bouncing the ball off the backboard. After a long moment of stunned silence, Calvin receives a standing ovation from his friends and the crowd, and gets signed to a one-day contract by the Knights and prepares for his first game with them, but discovers that he is not there to play. When the Knights play the San Antonio Spurs they start losing badly and Coach Wagner decides to let Calvin play in the fourth quarter. Calvin leads a comeback against the Spurs and they win, leading to Calvin getting a season contract. Calvin brings teamwork to the Knights and makes them one of the best teams in the league.

As Calvin is still a minor, Coach Wagner appoints Tracy to be his roommate and mentor, much to Tracy&#x27;s displeasure. Late one night, Tracy falls asleep behind the wheel after mistakenly taking sleeping medication, so Calvin is forced to drive the car back to the hotel to keep Tracy from being suspended for violating curfew. While Calvin gets benched for the incident as punishment for &quot;joyriding&quot;, Tracy starts warming up to him and the two begin to form a bond.

Bittleman eventually signs a contract with the Knights stating that all of Calvin&#x27;s money will go to him until Calvin comes of age, or is adopted. When the second option is about to become true, a desperate Bittleman steals Calvin&#x27;s sneakers and bets $100,000 on the Toronto Raptors to beat the Knights. After the kids convince Ox and his cohorts that Bittleman is selfish, Ox takes the shoes out of Bittleman&#x27;s safe. The kids head to the arena with Calvin&#x27;s sneakers. Bittleman escapes and sends goons after Calvin in a failed attempt to retrieve the shoes.

After the third quarter ends with Vince Carter and the Raptors routing the Knights, 80–59, Calvin makes it back to the arena with the shoes. Calvin nearly gets benched for arriving late, but Tracy and the rest of the team convinces Coach Wagner to let Calvin play, and the Knights start to make a comeback. After a pile-on towards the end of the game, Calvin&#x27;s shoes are ruined with the Knights trailing the Raptors, 103–102. Without the shoes, and wanting to go back to being a normal kid again, Calvin tells the team that, regardless of whether or not the Knights make the playoffs, this will be his last game. In the final play, Calvin manages to pump fake to get Carter to jump and pass the ball to Tracy. Tracy makes the game-winning shot at the final buzzer, and the Knights defeat the Raptors, 104–103, clinching the Knights&#x27; first playoff appearance.

After going back to the orphanage, Calvin and Murph get adopted by Tracy, and Reg by a different family, though they stay in touch. Bittleman, not having the money to pay the bet he made, goes missing (likely to avoid getting killed by the loan sharks for failing to pay, or avoid imprisonment for his treatment towards Calvin and the other orphans), and the orphanage is now sponsored by the Knights.

<text>Turkish Airlines (Turkish: &quot;Türk Hava Yolları&quot;), or legally Türk Hava Yolları Anonim Ortaklığı, is the flag carrier of Turkey. , it operates scheduled services to 352 destinations (including cargo) in Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, and the Americas. The airline serves more destinations non-stop from a single airport than any other airline in the world and flies to 131 countries, more than any other airline. With an operational fleet of 24 cargo aircraft, the airline&#x27;s cargo division Turkish Cargo serves 82 destinations. The airline also owns a low-cost subsidiary, AJet.

The airline&#x27;s corporate headquarters are on the grounds of Istanbul Atatürk Airport in Yeşilköy, Bakırköy, Istanbul. The airline&#x27;s main base is Istanbul Airport in Arnavutköy. It has been a member of the Star Alliance network since 1 April 2008.

==History==

===Early years===
Turkish Airlines was established on 20 May 1933 as &quot;Turkish State Airlines&quot; (Turkish: &quot;Devlet Hava Yolları&quot;) as a department of the Ministry of National Defense. The airline&#x27;s initial fleet consisted of two five-seat Curtiss Kingbirds, two four-seat Junkers F 13s and one ten-seat Tupolev ANT-9. In 1935, the airline was turned over to the Ministry of Public Works and was subsequently renamed &quot;General Directorate of State Airlines&quot;. Three years later, in 1938, it became part of the Ministry of Transportation.

===Postwar period===
Several Douglas DC-3s and Douglas C-47s were phased in during 1945. Being initially set up as a domestic carrier, the airline commenced international services with the inauguration of Ankara–Istanbul–Athens flights in 1947; with the DC-3s and C-47s enabling the carrier to expand its network.

Nicosia, Beirut and Cairo were soon added to the airline&#x27;s international flight destinations. However, domestic services remained the carrier&#x27;s primary focus until the early 1960s.

In 1956, the Turkish government reorganized the airline under the name &quot;Türk Hava Yolları A.O.&quot; (often abbreviated as THY). It was capitalized at TRY 60 million. The airline joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA) shortly thereafter. In 1957, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) began supplying technical support after acquiring a 6.5 percent shareholding, which it held for about 20 years.

New aircraft including Vickers Viscounts, Fokker F27s and Douglas DC-3s were added to the fleet in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Turkish Airlines began operating their first jet, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, in 1967. This was followed by the addition of three Boeing 707 jets in 1971. Other aircraft operated in the early 1970s included the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Fokker F28 which were put into service in 1972 and 1973 respectively.

===1980s and 1990s===
The airline was plagued by several issues in the 1980s and 90s. It developed a reputation for poor service compared to competitors and flight delays, with 47 out of 100 flights not departing on time. It also endured hijackings and suffered seven accidents between 1974 and 1983. The most notorious was the 1974 crash of Turkish Airlines Flight 981, when an aircraft design flaw led to a faulty cargo door breaking off in flight near Ermenonville, France, resulting in the deaths of 346 people. At the time of the accident, THY981 was the worst plane crash of all time.

A new government came to power in 1983 which recognized THY&#x27;s importance as Turkey&#x27;s gateway to the world, beginning the airline&#x27;s makeover into a modern operation. It would go on to maintain one of the youngest fleets in the world. Security was intensified, causing one shipper to compare it to Israel&#x27;s El Al, at least in terms of delays.

THY built a new, state-of-the-art technical center at Yeşilköy Airport in 1984. The airline was capable of both light and heavy maintenance on many different aircraft types. The technical staff then made up one-quarter of the airline&#x27;s 6,000 employees, according to Air Transport World. In 1984, the company&#x27;s capital was raised to 60 billion TL as it was classified as a state economic enterprise. Three years later, the capital was raised again, to 150 billion TL.

By the mid-1980s, THY had a fleet of 30 aircraft. It was flying approximately three million passengers a year to 16 domestic destinations and three dozen international ones. The airline was Turkey&#x27;s largest source of foreign currency. Turkish Airlines began operating Airbus A310s in 1985, allowing the addition of flights to Singapore in 1986. A route to New York City via Brussels was added in 1987.

The company posted losses in 1987 and 1988, largely due to high payments on its dozen new Airbus A310s, according to &quot;Air Transport World&quot;. The fleet also included 11 Boeing 727s and nine Douglas DC-9s. THY ended the decade with 8,500 employees.

The airline ordered five Airbus A340 aircraft with option for five more in 1990 to be able to fly to North American and East Asian destinations non-stop. The first A340 was delivered three years later, in 1993.

The company suffered in the global aviation crisis following the Persian Gulf War and would not break even again until 1994. However, the business was again booming in the mid-1990s, with the greatest growth coming from North American destinations. THY launched a nonstop flight to New York City in July 1994.

The company&#x27;s capital continued to be raised, reaching 10 trillion TL in 1995. During that year, the airline also converted three of its Boeing 727s to dedicated freighters. The DC-9s had been sold off. The company posted a $6 million profit on revenues of $1 billion for the year. While profitable, THY had to contend with Turkey&#x27;s exorbitant inflation, making capital improvements difficult.

The domestic market was deregulated in 1996, allowing new scheduled competition from charter airlines. At the same time, larger international carriers were providing stiff competition on routes to Western Europe. THY entered into marketing agreements with other international airlines to enhance their competitiveness. The company teamed with Japan Airlines to offer service to Osaka and Tokyo in 1997 and 1998. Other jointly operated flights soon followed with Austrian Airlines, Swissair, and Croatia Airlines. In 1997, THY began to operate flights to Chicago as its second destination in the US.

===21st century===


A new terminal opened in January 2000 at Istanbul&#x27;s Istanbul Atatürk Airport. Turkish Airlines continued to extend their international reach, forging marketing agreements with Asiana Airlines, American Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, LOT Polish Airlines, Czech Airlines and Cathay Pacific in 2000. On 29 October 2000, THY withdrew from the Swissair-led Qualiflyer alliance to help attract a strategic investor for their privatization. The airline had been part of the alliance&#x27;s frequent-flyer program since November 1998. An Antalya-Frankfurt route was added in 2001 through a code-sharing agreement with Sun Express.

Turkey underwent an economic crisis throughout most of 2001, leading to a reduction in traffic on domestic routes in particular. THY managed to survive after the September 11 attacks on the United States without a government bailout or mass layoffs, although 300 middle management positions were eliminated, 400 part-timers were laid off and wages were cut 10 percent. &quot;Turkish Daily News&quot; credited the airline&#x27;s survival to entrepreneurial management, which was quick to get rid of loss-making routes at home and abroad.

In 2003, the war in Iraq prompted Turkish Airlines to close some routes in the Persian Gulf, while flights to Asia were suspended during the SARS epidemic. However, the airline soon recovered, increasing traffic on existing routes and adding service to Delhi after an 11-year lapse.

Another fleet expansion program kicked off in 2004, helping THY maintain one of the youngest fleets in Europe. In July that year, the airline announced a massive $2.8 billion order of 36 jets from Airbus, plus an order for 15 Boeing 737s.

THY was not just ordering new planes. It was planning to spend $350 million on a new technical and training facility at Istanbul&#x27;s underutilized Sabiha Gökçen International Airport. The airline had built up a significant technical services operation, maintaining not just its aircraft but those of third parties. Turkish Technic employed 2,700 workers and was planning to hire another 2,000 by 2010. THY also had three flight simulators and offered flight training services.

The airline faced the entry of new competitors into the liberalizing Turkish aviation market. However, tourism was rising, with 20 million people expected to visit the country in 2005 versus 12 million in 2003. THY divested its 50% holding in Cyprus Turkish Airlines (&quot;Kıbrıs Türk Hava Yolları&quot;) in 2005.

Although the company was publicly traded at this time, the government-owned 98% of its shares. The privatization program was revived in 2004 with a public offering of 20% of shares on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. The Turkish government-owned 75% of shares after the offering, which raised $170 million. Currently, the Turkey Wealth Fund owns a 49.12% interest in THY, while 50.88% of shares are publicly traded.

On 1 April 2008, Turkish Airlines joined the Star Alliance after an 18-month integration process beginning in December 2006, becoming the seventh European airline in the 20-member alliance.

In December 2011, the Turkish government unveiled plans to modernize the Aden Adde International Airport in Mogadishu, Somalia, which became one of the newest flight destinations of the carrier in 2012. The rehabilitation project is part of Turkey&#x27;s broader engagement in the local post-conflict reconstruction process. Among the scheduled renovations are new airport systems and infrastructure, including a modern control tower to monitor the airspace. In March 2012, Turkish Airlines became the first international carrier to resume flights to Somalia since the start of that country&#x27;s civil war in the early 1990s.

By the end of 2013, Turkish Airlines had increased their number of flight points to 241 destinations worldwide (199 international and 42 domestic). The airline began increasing operations at Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen International Airport as it positioned it as a secondary hub.

Following the 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt, the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned flights between Turkey and the United States. This posed a particular problem for Turkish Airlines as a key component of the airline&#x27;s strategy was to deliver one-stop journeys between the US and hard-to-reach destinations in Africa, the Middle East, and India. This ban was lifted on 18 July, and Turkish Airlines resumed flights to the U.S. on 19 July after a three-day disruption.

In August 2016, Turkish Airlines announced a profit collapse to a loss of 198 million Euros for the second quarter of 2016 while expecting an overall loss of 10 million passengers for 2016. The airline already announced significant reductions in operations for the upcoming 2016–2017 schedule period with frequency cuts to 45 European and 13 intercontinental routes. Turkish Airlines also announced an overall record loss of 1.9 billion Turkish Lira ($644.4 million) for the first half of 2016.

The following year saw the airline recover, with financial results for 2017 showing an almost 35% increase in turnover, and a return to profitability.

In 2020, the airline announced its intention to withdraw from international routes at Sabiha Gökçen Airport by transferring these routes to its low-cost subsidiary, AnadoluJet.

In February 2022, Turkish Cargo, the airline&#x27;s freight subsidiary, relocated all cargo flights and operations from their former base at Istanbul Atatürk Airport to the new Istanbul Airport.

In February 2023, Turkish Airlines confirmed plans to spin off AnadoluJet from an incorporated brand name into an independent airline.

On 29 November 2024, Turkish Airlines flight TK175 successfully touched down in Sydney from Istanbul. This is the inaugural flight of the airline to the capital city of New South Wales and also the airline&#x27;s second route to Australia after Melbourne that was launched in March this year.

On 18 December 2024, the airline announced the commencement of its flights to Santiago, marking Chile as the 10th country served in the Americas and bringing its total destinations in the region to 26. The airline also announced the launch of flights to Benghazi that will commence starting 14 January 2025. Turkish Airlines last touched down at the most populous city in Libya more than a decade ago.

The airline started operations in 1933 with five aircraft, which grew to 52 in 1945 after the addition of Douglas DC-3s used in the Second World War. This made Turkish Airlines the largest carrier in the Middle East. The first jet-engined aircraft of the airline was a Douglas DC-9, which joined the fleet in 1967. The first wide-body Douglas DC-10 was added in 1972. The airline made major changes to its fleet development in the late-1980s, when the first Airbus A310 arrived, and the Airbus A340 was ordered. The first Boeing Boeing 737 arrived a few years later.

==Turkish Airlines Maintenance Center==

Turkish Airlines&#x27; maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) center, Turkish Technic, was incorporated in 2006 and is responsible for the maintenance of Turkish Airlines and other third party aircraft within eight hangars. Capabilities include airframe, landing gear, APU and other subsystems. Turkish Technic opened an engine center in partnership with Pratt &amp; Whitney called TEC (Turkish Engine Center) in January 2010 at Sabiha Gökçen International Airport (SAW). The facility provides engine MRO services to customers worldwide.

Turkish Technic was based at Istanbul Atatürk Airport within two hangars. It bought out MNG Technic along with its hangars, and the main complex moved to SAW with the building of two new hangars. Two smaller hangars are also located at Ankara Esenboğa Airport. Additional hangars are being built at the new Istanbul Airport to accommodate the operator&#x27;s growing fleet.

==Incidents and accidents==
In its history, Turkish Airlines has suffered a total of 19 incidents and accidents of which 15 were fatal. A total of 68 crew, 835 passengers and 35 people on the ground have been killed.
* On 17 February 1959, a Vickers Viscount Type 793, registration TC-SEV, operating a charter flight carrying Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and a governmental delegation to London for the signing of the London-Zürich Agreements, crashed in dense fog on approach to London Gatwick Airport. Nine of the sixteen passengers and five of the eight crew lost their lives. Adnan Menderes, who was sitting in the back part of the aircraft, survived the accident.
* On 23 September 1961, Turkish Airlines Flight 835, a Fokker F27-100 registered as TC-TAY, crashed at Karanlıktepe in Ankara Province on approach to Esenboğa Airport. All of the four crew and 24 of the 25 passengers on board were killed.

* On 26 January 1974, Turkish Airlines Flight 301, a Fokker F28-1000 registered as TC-JAO crashed shortly after takeoff from Izmir Cumaovası Airport due to atmospheric icing on the wings. The aircraft disintegrated and caught fire, killing four of the five crew and 62 of the 68 passengers on board.
* On 3 March 1974, Turkish Airlines Flight 981, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 registered as TC-JAV, crashed into Ermenonville Forest, Fontaine-Chaalis, Oise, France, due to explosive decompression, killing all 335 passengers and 11 crew on board. The main cause was a design fault on the cargo doors of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 which led to incomplete engagement of the door locking mechanism on the aircraft in question, and consequent opening of one door in flight.
* On 30 January 1975, Turkish Airlines Flight 345, a Fokker F28-1000 registration TC-JAP, crashed into the Sea of Marmara during final approach to Istanbul Yeşilköy Airport. All four crew and all 38 passengers on board the aircraft were killed.
* On 19 September 1976, a Boeing 727-200 registered as TC-JBH operating Turkish Airlines Flight 452 from Istanbul Yeşilköy Airport to Antalya Airport struck high ground in the Karatepe Mountains during an attempted landing in Isparta instead of Antalya by pilot error. All eight crew and 146 people on board the aircraft perished in the accident.
* On 23 December 1979, a Fokker F28-1000, registration TC-JAT, on a flight from Samsun-Çarşamba Airport to Esenboğa Airport, struck a hill in Kuyumcuköy village in Çubuk, Ankara, northeast of its destination airport in severe turbulence. Three of the four crew and 38 of the 41 passengers on board were killed.
* On 16 January 1983, Turkish Airlines Flight 158, a Boeing 727-200 registered as TC-JBR, landed about 50 m (160 ft) short of the runway at Esenboğa Airport in driving snow, broke up and caught fire. All of the seven crew survived; however, of the 60 passengers on board, 47 were killed.
* On 29 December 1994, Turkish Airlines Flight 278, a Boeing 737-400 registration TC-JES, crashed during its final approach to Van Ferit Melen Airport in driving snow. Five of the seven crew and 52 of the 69 passengers died.
* On 7 April 1999, Turkish Airlines Flight 5904, a Boeing 737-400 registered as TC-JEP on a repositioning flight, crashed near Ceyhan, Adana shortly after taking off from Adana Şakirpaşa Airport. There were no passengers on board, but all six crew members perished in the accident.
* On 8 January 2003, Turkish Airlines Flight 634, an Avro RJ-100 registration TC-THG, crashed on approach to Diyarbakır Airport, Turkey. Of the 80 people on board, all five crew and 70 passengers were killed.

* On 25 February 2009, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951, a Boeing 737-800 registered as TC-JGE carrying 128 passengers and a crew of 7, crashed during final approach to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands. It was determined that a faulty radar altimeter caused the aircraft to throttle the engines back to idle and that the crew subsequently failed to react properly which resulted in an unrecoverable stall and the subsequent crash. Of the 135 people on board, nine people, including the three pilots, were killed. Eighty-six more people were transported to local hospitals.
* On 3 March 2015, Turkish Airlines Flight 726 departed the runway on landing at Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu, Nepal. The Airbus A330-300 operating the flight, TC-JOC, was severely damaged when its nose gear collapsed, causing damage to the fuselage and both wings. All 227 passengers and 11 crew members on board escaped with one injury reported. The aircraft was scrapped afterwards.
* On 25 April 2015, Turkish Airlines Flight 1878, an Airbus A320-200 TC-JPE was severely damaged in a landing accident at Istanbul Atatürk Airport. All on board were successfully evacuated without any injuries reported.
* On 16 January 2017, Turkish Airlines Flight 6491, a Boeing 747-412F operated for Turkish Airlines under wet lease from ACT Airlines, crashed into a residential area upon attempting landing in Manas International Airport in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, killing all four crew members and 35 people on the ground. In response, Turkish Airlines released a statement on Twitter that neither plane nor crew were theirs, calling it an &quot;ACT Airlines accident&quot;. However, the flight was still operated under a Turkish Airlines flight number, making it a Turkish Airlines flight under IATA rules.
* On 21 November 2019, Turkish Airlines Flight 467, a Boeing 737-800, suffered a nose gear collapse while attempting to land in heavy crosswinds at Odesa International Airport in Ukraine. All passengers and crew were deplaned using emergency slides without injury. The aircraft, TC-JGZ, was declared a hull loss and scrapping was commenced in 2020.

<text>Koblenz ( , , ; Moselle Franconian: &quot;Kowelenz&quot;) is a German city on the banks of the Rhine (Middle Rhine) and the Moselle, a multinational tributary.

Koblenz was established as a Roman military post by Drusus . Its name originates from the Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;(at the) confluence&quot;. The actual confluence is today known as the &quot;German Corner&quot;, a symbol of the unification of Germany that features an equestrian statue of Emperor William I. The city celebrated its 2,000th anniversary in 1992.

The city ranks as the third-largest city by population in Rhineland-Palatinate, behind Mainz and Ludwigshafen am Rhein. Its usual-residents&#x27; population is 112,000 (). Koblenz lies in a narrow flood plain between high hill ranges, some reaching mountainous height, and is served by an express rail and autobahn network. It is part of the populous Rhineland.

==Name==
Historic spellings include &quot;Covelenz&quot;, &quot;Coblenz&quot;, and &quot;Cobelenz&quot;. In local dialect the name is as the first historic spelling indicates, in German orthography, Latscho Kowelenz.

==History==


===Ancient era===
Around 1000 BC, early fortifications were erected on the Festung Ehrenbreitstein hill on the opposite side of the Rhine. In 55 BC, Roman troops commanded by Julius Caesar reached the Rhine and built a bridge between Koblenz and Andernach. About 9 BC, the &quot;Castellum apud Confluentes&quot; was one of the military posts established by Drusus.

Remains of a large bridge built in 49 AD by the Romans are still visible. The Romans built two forts as protection for the bridge, one in 9 AD and another in the 2nd century, the latter being destroyed by the Franks in 259. North of Koblenz was a temple of Mercury and Rosmerta (a Gallo-Roman deity), which remained in use up to the 5th century.

===Middle Ages===
With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city was conquered by the Franks and became a royal seat. After the division of Charlemagne&#x27;s empire, it was included in the lands of his son Louis the Pious (814). In 837, it was assigned to Charles the Bald, and a few years later it was here that Carolingian heirs discussed what was to become the Treaty of Verdun (843), by which the city became part of Lotharingia under Lothair I. In 860 and 922, Koblenz was the scene of ecclesiastical synods. At the first synod, held in the Liebfrauenkirche, the reconciliation of Louis the German with his half-brother Charles the Bald took place. In the second, slavery was condemned, specifically it was decreed that any man that &#x27;led away a Christian man and then sold him&#x27; should be considered guilty of homicide. The city was sacked and destroyed by the Norsemen in 882. In 925, it became part of the eastern German Kingdom, later the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1018, the city was given by the emperor Henry II to the archbishop-elector of Trier after receiving a charter. It remained in the possession of his successors until the end of the 18th century, having been their main residence since the 17th century. Emperor Conrad II was elected here in 1138. In 1198, the battle between Philip of Swabia and Otto IV took place nearby. In 1216, prince-bishop Theoderich von Wied donated part of the lands of the basilica and the hospital to the Teutonic Knights, which later became the &quot;Deutsches Eck&quot;.

In 1249–1254, Koblenz was given new walls by Archbishop Arnold II of Isenburg; and it was partly to overawe the turbulent citizens that successive archbishops built and strengthened the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein that still dominates the city.

===French Revolution===

====Home of Royalist émigrés====

When the French Revolution broke out, Koblenz became a popular hub of royalist émigrés and escaping feudal lords who had fled France. It was sometime in mid-1791, after June but before October, that supporters of loyalty in Koblenz (as well as Worms and Brussels) were preparing an invasion of France that was to be supported by foreign armies, with conspirators regularly travel between Koblenz and Tuileries Palace, accepting encouragement and money from King Louis XVI, while secret committees were collecting arms and enrolling men and officers. Among the notable émigrés living at Koblenz were Charles, Count of Artois, (future Charles X), ex-minister Charles Alexandre de Calonne, and Louis, Count of Provence (future Louis XVIII). Officers and men were recruited through the Gazette de Paris (sixty livres for each recruit), and the enrolled men were then sent to Metz and afterwards to Koblenz, and in a visit by Claude Allier to Koblenz in January 1792, he stated that 60,000 men were armed and ready to take action.

====Near destruction by Royalist forces====

On July 26, 1792, the Duke of Brunswick, who commanded one of the invading armies, composed of 70,000 Prussians and 68,000 Austrians, Hessians and émigrés, began to march upon Koblenz. He published a manifesto in which he threatened to set fire to the towns that dared to defend themselves, and to exterminate their inhabitants as rebels, including Koblenz. The city&#x27;s fate was at hand. But, just as in World War 1, the torrential rains and difficult conditions of the Argonne forest halted the invaders, the roads &quot;were liquid mud,&quot; and supplies began to run out due to weather impacting supply lines. The radical revolutionary Georges Danton negotiated with the Duke of Brunswick, under unknown conditions, for his retreat, which was carried out through Grand-Pré and Verdun, then across the Rhine, and the city of Koblenz was saved.

====Participation in the Vendee uprising====

In 1793, the uprising of Catholic peasants at the Vendée aimed at the overthrow of the National Assembly, which began only after emissaries from Koblenz traveled there, bringing papal bulls, royal decrees and gold. In escaping the watchful eye of French revolutionary forces, these emissaries were aided and protected by the middle classes, the ex-slave-traders of Nantes, and the anti-sans-culottes, pro-England merchants.

====Overall influence====

Due to their experience in the French Revolution, Peter Kropotkin had termed the phrase &quot;Koblenzian&quot; to describe the type of royalist émigrés that lived in Koblenz.

===Modern era===
The city was a member of the league of the Rhenish cities which rose in the 13th century. The Teutonic Knights founded the Bailiwick of Koblenz in or around 1231. Koblenz attained great prosperity and it continued to advance until the disaster of the Thirty Years&#x27; War brought about a rapid decline. After Philip Christopher, elector of Trier, surrendered Ehrenbreitstein to the French, the city received an imperial garrison in 1632. However, this force was soon expelled by the Swedes, who in their turn handed the city over again to the French. Imperial forces finally succeeded in retaking it by storm in 1636.

In 1688, Koblenz was besieged by the French under Marshal de Boufflers, but they only succeeded in bombing the Old City (&quot;Altstadt&quot;) into ruins, destroying among other buildings the Old Merchants&#x27; Hall (&quot;Kaufhaus&quot;), which was restored in its present form in 1725. The city was the residence of the archbishop-electors of Trier from 1690 to 1801.

In 1786, the last archbishop-elector of Trier, Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, greatly assisted the extension and improvement of the city, turning the Ehrenbreitstein into a magnificent baroque palace. After the fall of the Bastille in 1789, the city became, through the invitation of the archbishop-elector&#x27;s chief minister, Ferdinand Freiherr von Duminique, one of the principal rendezvous points for French émigrés. The archbishop-elector approved of this because he was the uncle of the persecuted king of France, Louis XVI. Among the many royalist French refugees who flooded into the city were Louis XVI&#x27;s two younger brothers, the Comte de Provence and the Comte d&#x27;Artois. In addition, Louis XVI&#x27;s cousin, Prince Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, arrived and formed an army of young aristocrats willing to fight the French Revolution and restore the Ancien Régime. The &quot;Army of Condé&quot; joined with an allied army of Prussian and Austrian soldiers led by Duke Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand of Brunswick in an unsuccessful invasion of France in 1792. This drew down the wrath of the First French Republic on the archbishop-elector; in 1794, Koblenz was taken by the French Revolutionary army under Marceau (who was killed during the siege), and, after the signing of the Treaty of Lunéville (1801) it was made the capital of the new French department of Rhin-et-Moselle. In 1814, it was occupied by the Russians. The Congress of Vienna assigned the city to Prussia, and in 1822, it was made the seat of government for the Prussian Rhine Province.

After World War I, France occupied the area once again. The city was the center of the American occupation force from 1919 - 1923. In defiance of the French, the German populace of the city insisted on using the more German spelling of Koblenz after 1926. During World War II it hosted the command of German Army Group B and, like many counterparts, was heavily bombed and rebuilt afterwards. From 16 – 19 March 1945, it was the scene of heavy fighting by the U.S. 87th Infantry Division in support of Operation Lumberjack. Between 1947 and 1950, it served as the seat of government of Rhineland-Palatinate.

The Rhine Gorge was declared a World Heritage Site in 2002, with Koblenz marking the northern end. 

==Main sights==

===Fortified cities===

Its defensive works are extensive, and consist of strong forts crowning the hills encircling the city to the west, and the citadel of Ehrenbreitstein on the opposite bank of the Rhine. The old city was triangular in shape, two sides being bounded by the Rhine and Mosel and the third by a line of fortifications. The latter were razed in 1890, and the city was permitted to expand in this direction. The Koblenz Hauptbahnhof (central station) was built on a spacious site outside the former walls at the junction of the Cologne-Mainz railway and the strategic Metz-Berlin line. In April 2011 Koblenz-Stadtmitte station was opened in the inner city to coincide with the opening of the Federal Garden Show 2011. The Rhine is crossed by the Pfaffendorf Bridge, originally the location of a rail bridge, but now a road bridge and, a mile south of city, by the Horchheim Railway Bridge, consisting of two wide and lofty spans carrying the Lahntal railway, part of the Berlin railway referred to above. The Moselle is spanned by a Gothic freestone bridge of 14 arches, erected in 1344, two modern road bridges and also by two railway bridges.

Since 1890, the city has consisted of the Altstadt (old city) and the Neustadt (new city) or Klemenstadt. Of these, the Altstadt is closely built and has only a few fine streets and squares, while the Neustadt possesses numerous broad streets and a handsome frontage along the Rhine.

===Electoral palace===

In the modern part of the city lies the palace (&quot;Residenzschloss&quot;), with one front looking towards the Rhine, the other into the Neustadt. It was built in 1778–1786 by Clemens Wenceslaus, the last elector of Trier, following a design by the French architect P.M. d&#x27;Ixnard. In 1833, the palace was used as a barracks, and became a terminal post for the optical telecommunications system that originated in Potsdam. Today, the elector&#x27;s former palace is a museum. Among other exhibits, it contains some Gobelin tapestries. From it some gardens and promenades (Kaiserin Augusta Anlagen) stretch along the bank of the Rhine, and in them is a memorial to the poet Max von Schenkendorf. A statue to the empress Augusta, whose favorite residence was Koblenz, stands in the Luisenplatz.

===William I monument===
The Teutonic Knights were given an area for their Deutschherrenhaus Bailiwick right at the confluence of the Rhine and Mosel, which became known as &quot;German Corner&quot; (Deutsches Eck).

In 1897, a monument to German Emperor William I of Germany, mounted on a horse, was inaugurated there by his grandson Wilhelm II. The architect was Bruno Schmitz, who was responsible for a number of nationalistic German monuments and memorials. The &quot;German Corner&quot; is since associated with this monument, the (re) foundation of the German Empire and the German refusal of any French claims to the area, as described in the song &quot;Die Wacht am Rhein&quot; together with the &quot;Wacht am Rhein&quot; called &quot;Niederwalddenkmal&quot; some upstream.

During World War II, the statue was destroyed by US artillery. The French occupation administration intended the complete destruction of the monument and wanted to replace it with a new one.

In 1953, Bundespräsident Theodor Heuss rededicated the monument to German unity, adding the signs of the remaining western federal states as well as the ones of the lost areas in the East. A Flag of Germany has flown there since. The Saarland was added four years later after the population had voted to join Germany.

In the 1980s, a film clip of the monument was often shown on late night TV when the national anthem was played to mark the end of the day, a practice which was discontinued when nonstop broadcasting became common. On October 3, 1990, the very day the former GDR states joined, their signs were added to the monument.

As German unity was considered complete and the areas under Polish administration were ceded to Poland, the monument lost its official active purpose, now only reminding of history. In 1993, the flag was replaced by a copy of the statue, donated by a local couple. The day chosen for the reinstatement of the statue, however, caused controversy as it coincided with Sedantag (Sedan Day) (September 2, 1870) a day of celebration remembering Germany&#x27;s victory over France in the Battle of Sedan. The event was widely celebrated from the 1870s until the 1910s.

===Other sights===
In the more ancient part of Koblenz stand several buildings which have a historical interest. Prominent among these, near the point of confluence of the rivers, is the Basilica of St. Castor or &quot;Kastorkirche&quot;, dedicated to Castor of Karden, with four towers. The church was founded in 836 by Louis the Pious, but the present Romanesque building was completed in 1208, the Gothic vaulted roof dating from 1498. In front of the church of Saint Castor stands a fountain, erected by the French in 1812, with an inscription to commemorate Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia. Not long after, Russian troops occupied Koblenz; and St. Priest, their commander, added in irony these words: &quot;Vu et approuvé par nous, Commandant russe de la Ville de Coblence: Janvier 1er, 1814.&quot;

In this quarter of the city, too, is the &quot;Liebfrauenkirche&quot;, a fine church (nave 1250, choir 1404–1431) with lofty late Romanesque towers; the castle of the electors of Trier, erected in 1280, which now contains the municipal picture gallery; and the family house of the Metternichs, where Prince Metternich, the Austrian statesman, was born in 1773. Also notable is the church of St. Florian, with a two towers façade from .

The former Jesuit College is a Baroque edifice by J.C. Sebastiani (1694–1698), which now serves as the current City Hall.

Near Koblenz is the Lahneck Castle near Lahnstein, open to visitors from 1 April to 31 October.

The city is close to the Bronze Age earthworks at Goloring, a possible Urnfield calendar constructed some 3,000 years ago.

The mild climate allows fig trees, olive trees, palm trees and other Mediterranean plants to grow in the area.

<text>A republican guard, sometimes called a national guard, is a state organization of a country (often a republic, hence the name &quot;Republican&quot;) which typically serves to protect the head of state and the government, and thus is often synonymous with a presidential guard. The term is derived from the original French Gendarmerie unit. Several other countries also have adopted the term and have active guard units. Republican Guards may be purely ceremonial units providing close protection to heads of states during functions and parades or be full time protective security units.

<doc id="167933" wikidata="Q437708" url="?curid=167933" title="John Loudon McAdam">
<text>John Loudon McAdam (23 September 1756 – 26 November 1836) was a Scottish civil engineer and road-builder. He invented a new process, &quot;macadamisation&quot;, for building roads with a smooth hard surface, using controlled materials of mixed particle size and predetermined structure, that would be more durable and less muddy than soil-based tracks.

Modern road construction still reflects McAdam&#x27;s influence. Of subsequent improvements, the most significant was the introduction of tar (originally coal tar) to bind the road surface&#x27;s stones together, &quot;tarmac&quot; (for Tar Macadam.)

== Early life ==
McAdam was born in Ayr, Scotland. He was the youngest of ten children and second son of the Baron of Waterhead. He moved to Lagwine at Carsphairn when still a child to live with his grandparents. The family name was traditionally McGregor, but was changed to McAdam (claiming descent from the Biblical Adam) for political reasons in James VI&#x27;s reign.

He moved to New York in 1770 and, as a merchant and prize agent during the American Revolution, made his fortune working at his uncle William McAdam&#x27;s counting house. He returned to Scotland in 1783 and purchased an estate at Sauchrie, Ayrshire.

Besides taking part in local Ayrshire affairs, McAdam operated the Kaims Colliery. The colliery supplied coal to the British Tar Company, of Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald, and partners in the coal tar trade; McAdam ran its kilns. He further was involved in the ironworks at Muirkirk, which was a customer for the coke byproduct of the tar business. This business connection is the only direct relationship of McAdam and tar.

== Career ==

McAdam became a trustee of the Ayrshire Turnpike in 1783 and became increasingly involved with day-to-day road construction over the next 10 years. In 1802 he moved to Bristol, England and he became general surveyor for the Bristol Corporation in 1804. He put forward his ideas in evidence to Parliamentary enquiries in 1810, 1819 and 1823. In two treatises written in 1816 and 1819 (&quot;Remarks on the Present System of Road-Making&quot; and &quot;Practical Essay on the Scientific Repair and Preservation of Roads&quot;) he argued that roads needed to be raised above the surrounding ground and constructed from layered rocks and gravel in a systematic manner.

McAdam had also been appointed surveyor to the Bristol Turnpike Trust in 1816, where he decided to remake the roads under his care with crushed stone bound with gravel on a firm base of large stones. A camber, making the road slightly convex, ensured rainwater rapidly drained off the road rather than penetrate and damage the road&#x27;s foundations. This construction method, the greatest advance in road construction since Roman times, became known as &quot;macadamisation&quot;, or, more simply, &quot;macadam&quot;.
The macadam method spread very quickly across the world. The first macadam road in North America, the National Road, was completed in the 1830s and most of the main roads in Europe were subject to the McAdam process by the end of the nineteenth century.

Although McAdam was paid £5,000 for his Bristol Turnpike Trust work and made &quot;Surveyor-General of Metropolitan Roads&quot; in 1820, professional jealousy cut a £5,000 grant for expenses from the Parliament of the United Kingdom to £2,000 in 1827. His efficient road-building and management work had revealed the corruption and abuse of road tolls by unscrupulous turnpike trusts, many of which were run at a deliberate loss despite high toll receipts.

== Death and descendants ==
McAdam died in Moffat, Dumfriesshire, while returning to his home in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, from his annual summer visit to Scotland. His three sons, and in turn four grandsons, followed him into the profession and assisted with the management of turnpike trusts around the country. His second surviving son, James Nicoll McAdam, the &quot;Colossus of Roads&quot;, was knighted for managing turnpike trusts: a knighthood, it is said, previously offered to his father but declined.

<text>Guru ( ; IAST: &quot;guru&quot;) is a Sanskrit term for a &quot;mentor, guide, expert, or master&quot; of certain knowledge or field. In pan-Indian traditions, a guru is more than a teacher: traditionally, the guru is a reverential figure to the disciple (or &quot;&quot; in Sanskrit, literally &quot;seeker [of knowledge or truth&quot;]) or student, with the guru serving as a &quot;counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student&quot;. Whatever language it is written in, Judith Simmer-Brown says that a tantric spiritual text is often codified in an obscure twilight language so that it cannot be understood by anyone without the verbal explanation of a qualified teacher, the guru. A guru is also one&#x27;s spiritual guide, who helps one to discover the same potentialities that the &quot;guru&quot; has already realized.

The oldest references to the concept of &quot;guru&quot; are found in the earliest Vedic texts of Hinduism. The &quot;guru&quot;, and &quot;gurukula&quot; – a school run by &quot;guru&quot;, were an established tradition in India by the 1st millennium BCE, and these helped compose and transmit the various Vedas, the Upanishads, texts of various schools of Hindu philosophy, and post-Vedic Shastras ranging from spiritual knowledge to various arts so also specific science and technology. By about mid 1st millennium CE, archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggest numerous larger institutions of &quot;gurus&quot; existed in India, some near Hindu temples, where guru-shishya tradition helped preserve, create and transmit various fields of knowledge. These gurus led broad ranges of studies including Hindu scriptures, Buddhist texts, grammar, philosophy, martial arts, music and painting.

The tradition of the guru is also found in Jainism, referring to a spiritual preceptor, a role typically served by a Jain ascetic. In Sikhism, the &quot;guru&quot; tradition has played a key role since its founding in the 15th century, its founder is referred to as Guru Nanak, and its scripture as Guru Granth Sahib. The guru concept has thrived in Vajrayāna Buddhism, where the tantric guru is considered a figure to worship and whose instructions should never be violated.

== Definition and etymology ==

The word &quot;&quot; (Sanskrit: ), a noun, connotes &quot;teacher&quot; in Sanskrit, but in ancient Indian traditions it has contextual meanings with significance beyond what teacher means in English. The &quot;guru&quot; is more than someone who teaches a specific type of knowledge, and included in the term&#x27;s scope is someone who is also a &quot;counselor, a sort of parent of mind (&quot;Citta&quot;) and Self (&quot;Atman&quot;), who helps mold values (Yamas and Niyamas) and experiential knowledge as much as specific knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who reveals the meaning of life.&quot; The word has the same meaning in other languages derived from or borrowing words from Sanskrit, such as Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Bengali, Gujarati and Nepali. The Malayalam term Acharyan or Asan is derived from the Sanskrit word Acharya.

As a noun the word means the imparter of knowledge (&quot;jñāna&quot;; also Pali: &quot;ñāna&quot;). As an adjective, it means &#x27;heavy,&#x27; or &#x27;weighty,&#x27; in the sense of &quot;heavy with knowledge,&quot; heavy with spiritual wisdom, &quot;heavy with spiritual weight,&quot; &quot;heavy with the good qualities of scriptures and realization,&quot; or &quot;heavy with a wealth of knowledge.&quot; The word has its roots in the Sanskrit &quot;gri&quot; (to invoke, or to praise), and may have a connection to the word &quot;gur&quot;, meaning &#x27;to raise, lift up, or to make an effort&#x27;.

Sanskrit &quot;guru&quot; is cognate with Latin &quot;gravis&quot; &#x27;heavy; grave, weighty, serious&#x27; and Greek βαρύς &quot;barus&quot; &#x27;heavy&#x27;. All three derive from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*gʷerə-&quot;, specifically from the zero-grade form *&quot;gʷr̥ə-&quot;.

=== Darkness and light ===
A popular etymological theory considers the term &quot;guru&quot; to be based on the syllables &quot;gu&quot; () and &quot;ru&quot; (), which it claims stands for darkness and &quot;light that dispels it&quot;, respectively. The guru is seen as the one who &quot;dispels the darkness of ignorance.&quot;

Reender Kranenborg disagrees, stating that darkness and light have nothing to do with the word &quot;guru&quot;. He describes this as a folk etymology.

Joel Mlecko states, &quot;&quot;Gu&quot; means ignorance, and &quot;Ru&quot; means dispeller,&quot; with &quot;guru&quot; meaning the one who &quot;dispels ignorance, all kinds of ignorance&quot;, ranging from spiritual to skills such as dancing, music, sports and others. Karen Pechilis states that, in the popular parlance, the &quot;dispeller of darkness, one who points the way&quot; definition for &quot;guru&quot; is common in the Indian tradition.

In &quot;Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion&quot;, Pierre Riffard makes a distinction between &quot;occult&quot; and &quot;scientific&quot; etymologies, citing as an example of the former the etymology of &#x27;guru&#x27; in which the derivation is presented as &quot;gu&quot; (&quot;darkness&quot;) and &quot;ru&quot; (&#x27;to push away&#x27;); the latter he exemplifies by &quot;guru&quot; with the meaning of &#x27;heavy.&#x27;

== In Hinduism ==
The Guru is an ancient and central figure in the traditions of Hinduism. Ultimate liberation or &quot;moksha&quot; and inner perfection is considered achievable in Hinduism with the help of a &quot;guru&quot;. The Guru can also serve as a teacher of skills, a counselor, one who helps in the realization of one&#x27;s Self (Atma), who instills values and experiential knowledge, an exemplar, an inspiration and one who helps guide a student&#x27;s (&quot;śiṣya&quot;) spiritual development. At a social and religious level, the Guru helps continue the religion and Hindu way of life. Guru thus has a historic, reverential and an important role in the Hindu culture.

===Scriptures===
The word Guru is mentioned in the earliest layer of Vedic texts. The hymn 4.5.6 of Rigveda describes the guru as, &quot;the source and inspirer of the knowledge of the Self, the essence of reality,&quot; for one who seeks.

In chapter 4.4 within the Chandogya Upanishad, a guru is described as one whom one attains knowledge that matters, the insights that lead to Self-knowledge. Verse 1.2.8 of the Katha Upanisad declares the guru &quot;as indispensable to the acquisition of knowledge.&quot; In chapter 3 of Taittiriya Upanishad, human knowledge is described as that which connects the teacher and the student through the medium of exposition, just like a child is the connecting link between the father and the mother through the medium of procreation. In the Taittiriya Upanishad, the &quot;guru&quot; then urges a student to &quot;struggle, discover and experience the Truth, which is the source, stay and end of the universe.&quot;

The ancient tradition of reverence for the &quot;guru&quot; in Hindu scriptures is apparent in 6.23 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, which equates the need of reverence and devotion for &quot;guru&quot; to be the same as for god,

The Bhagavad Gita also exemplifies the importance of a guru within Hinduism. Arjuna when faced with the realization of having to wage war with his kin is paralyzed with grief and remorse. Overwhelmed he lays down his weapons and refuses to fight. Despite his intellectual prowess and skill in warfare he finds himself lacking in Dharmic (moral) clarity. At this moment he turns to Krishna for guidance and in essence seeks Krishna as his guru. This interaction exemplifies the importance within the Hindu tradition for a disciple to seek guidance from an experienced spiritual guru. Additionally, other references to the role of a guru in the Bhagavad Gita include verse 4.34 - those who know their subject well are eager for good students, and the student can learn from such a &quot;guru&quot; through reverence, service, effort and the process of inquiry.

===Capabilities, role and methods for helping a student===
The 8th century Hindu text &quot;Upadesasahasri&quot; of the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara discusses the role of the guru in assessing and guiding students. In Chapter 1, he states that teacher is the pilot as the student walks in the journey of knowledge, he is the raft as the student rows. The text describes the need, role and characteristics of a teacher, as follows,


Adi Shankara presents a series of examples wherein he asserts that the best way to guide a student is not to give immediate answers, but posit dialogue-driven questions that enable the student to discover and understand the answer.

=== Reverence and &quot;Guru-Bhakti&quot; ===
Reverence for the guru is a fundamental principle in Hinduism, as illustrated in the Guru Gita by the following shloka 

Other notable examples of devotion to the guru within Hinduism include the religious festival of Guru Purnima.

=== Gurukula and the guru-shishya tradition ===


Traditionally, the &quot;Guru&quot; would live a simple married life, and accept &quot;shishya&quot; (student, Sanskrit: शिष्य) where he lived. A person would begin a life of study in the Gurukula (the household of the &quot;Guru&quot;). The process of acceptance included proffering firewood and sometimes a gift to the guru, signifying that the student wants to live with, work and help the &quot;guru&quot; in maintaining the &quot;gurukul&quot;, and as an expression of a desire for education in return over several years. At the Gurukul, the working student would study the basic traditional vedic sciences and various practical skills-oriented shastras along with the religious texts contained within the Vedas and Upanishads. The education stage of a youth with a &quot;guru&quot; was referred to as Brahmacharya, and in some parts of India this followed the Upanayana or Vidyarambha rites of passage.

The gurukul would be a hut in a forest, or it was, in some cases, a monastery, called a &quot;matha&quot; or &quot;ashram&quot; or &quot;sampradaya&quot; in different parts of India. Each ashram had a lineage of gurus, who would study and focus on certain schools of Hindu philosophy or trade, also known as the &quot;guru-shishya&quot; &quot;parampara&quot; (teacher-student tradition). This &quot;guru&quot;-driven tradition included arts such as sculpture, poetry and music.

Inscriptions from 4th century CE suggest the existence of &quot;gurukuls&quot; around Hindu temples, called &quot;Ghatikas&quot; or &quot;Mathas&quot;, where the Vedas were studied. In south India, 9th century Vedic schools attached to Hindu temples were called &quot;Calai&quot; or &quot;Salai&quot;, and these provided free boarding and lodging to students and scholars. Archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggests that ancient and medieval era gurukuls near Hindu temples offered wide range of studies, ranging from Hindu scriptures to Buddhist texts, grammar, philosophy, martial arts, music and painting.

The &quot;guru-shishya parampara&quot;, occurs where knowledge is passed down through succeeding generations. It is the traditional, residential form of education, where the Shishya remains and learns with his Guru as a family member.

====Gender and caste====
The Hindu texts offer a conflicting view of whether access to &quot;guru&quot; and education was limited to men and to certain &quot;varna&quot; (castes). The Vedas and the Upanishads never mention any restrictions based either on gender or &quot;varna&quot;. The Yajurveda and Atharvaveda texts state that knowledge is for everyone, and offer examples of women and people from all segments of society who are &quot;guru&quot; and participated in vedic studies. The Upanishads assert that one&#x27;s birth does not determine one&#x27;s eligibility for spiritual knowledge, only one&#x27;s effort and sincerity matters.

The early Dharma-sutras and Dharma-sastras, such as Paraskara Grhyasutra, Gautama Smriti and Yajnavalkya smriti, state all four varnas are eligible to all fields of knowledge while verses of Manusmriti state that Vedic study is available only to men of three varnas, unavailable to Shudra and women. Kramrisch, Scharfe, and Mookerji state that the guru tradition and availability of education extended to all segments of ancient and medieval society. Lise McKean states the &quot;guru&quot; concept has been prevalent over the range of class and caste backgrounds, and the disciples a guru attracts come from both genders and a range of classes and castes. During the bhakti movement of Hinduism, which started in about mid 1st millennium CE, the &quot;gurus&quot; included women and members of all &quot;varna&quot;.

=== Attributes ===
The Advayataraka Upanishad states that the true teacher is a master in the field of knowledge, well-versed in the Vedas, is free from envy, knows yoga, lives a simple life that of a yogi, has realized the knowledge of the Atman (Self). Some scriptures and gurus have warned against false teachers, and have recommended that the spiritual seeker test the guru before accepting him. Swami Vivekananda said that there are many incompetent gurus, and that a true guru should understand the spirit of the scriptures, have a pure character and be free from sin, and should be selfless, without desire for money and fame.

According to the Indologist Georg Feuerstein, in some traditions of Hinduism, when one reaches the state of Self-knowledge, one&#x27;s own Self becomes the &quot;guru&quot;. In Tantra, states Feuerstein, the guru is the &quot;ferry who leads one across the ocean of existence.&quot; A true guru guides and counsels a student&#x27;s spiritual development because, states &quot;Yoga-Bija&quot;, endless logic and grammar leads to confusion, and not contentment. However, various Hindu texts caution prudence and diligence in finding the right guru, and avoiding the wrong ones. For example, in &quot;Kula-Arnava&quot; text states the following guidance:

A true guru is, asserts &quot;Kula-Arnava&quot;, one who lives the simple virtuous life he preaches, is stable and firm in his knowledge, master yogi with the knowledge of Self (&quot;Atma Gyaan&quot;) and Brahman (ultimate reality). The guru is one who initiates, transmits, guides, illuminates, debates and corrects a student in the journey of knowledge and of self-realization. The attribute of the successful guru is to help make the disciple into another guru, one who transcends him, and becomes a guru unto himself, driven by inner spirituality and principles.

=== In modern Hinduism ===
In modern neo-Hinduism, Kranenborg states &quot;guru&quot; may refer to entirely different concepts, such as a &quot;spiritual advisor&quot;, or someone who performs traditional rituals outside a temple, or an &quot;enlightened master&quot; in the field of tantra or yoga or eastern arts who derives his authority from his experience, or a reference by a group of devotees of a sect to someone considered a god-like Avatar by the sect.

The tradition of reverence for &quot;guru&quot; continues in several denominations within modern Hinduism, but rather than being considered as a prophet, the guru is seen as a person who points the way to spirituality, oneness of being, and meaning in life.

== In Buddhism ==

In some forms of Buddhism, states Rita Gross, the concept of Guru is of supreme importance. Guru is called as Garu in Pali. The Guru is the teacher, who teaches the spiritual and religious knowledge. Guru can be anyone who teach this knowledge and not generally need to be Acariya or Upajjhaya. Guru can also be a personal teacher. Buddha is called as Lokagaru, meaning &quot;the teacher of the world&quot;.

In Vajrayana Buddhism&#x27;s Tantric teachings, the rituals require the guidance of a guru. The guru is considered essential and to the Buddhist devotee, the guru is the &quot;enlightened teacher and ritual master&quot;, states Stephen Berkwitz. The guru is known as the &quot;vajra guru&quot; (literally &quot;diamond guru&quot;). Initiations or ritual empowerments are necessary before the student is permitted to practice a particular tantra, in Vajrayana Buddhist sects found in Tibet and South Asia. The tantras state that the guru is equivalent to Buddha, states Berkwitz, and is a figure to worship and whose instructions should never be violated.

There are Four Kinds of Lama (Guru) or spiritual teacher (Tib. lama nampa shyi) in Tibetan Buddhism:

# gangzak gyüpé lama — the individual teacher who is the holder of the lineage
# gyalwa ka yi lama — the teacher which is the word of the buddhas
# nangwa da yi lama — the symbolic teacher of all appearances
# rigpa dön gyi lama — the absolute teacher, which is rigpa, the true nature of mind

In various Buddhist traditions, there are equivalent words for &quot;guru&quot;, which include &quot;Shastri&quot; (teacher), &quot;Kalyana Mitra&quot; (friendly guide, Pali: Kalyāṇa-mittatā), &quot;Acarya&quot; (master), and &quot;Vajra-Acarya&quot; (hierophant). The &quot;guru&quot; is literally understood as &quot;weighty&quot;, states Alex Wayman, and it refers to the Buddhist tendency to increase the weight of canons and scriptures with their spiritual studies. In Mahayana Buddhism, a term for Buddha is Bhaisajya guru, which refers to &quot;medicine guru&quot;, or &quot;a doctor who cures suffering with the medicine of his teachings&quot;.

== In Jainism ==

&quot;Guru&quot; is the spiritual preceptor in Jainism, and typically a role served by Jain ascetics. The &quot;guru&quot; is one of three fundamental &quot;tattva&quot; (categories), the other two being &quot;dharma&quot; (teachings) and &quot;deva&quot; (divinity). The &quot;guru-tattva&quot; is what leads a lay person to the other two &quot;tattva&quot;. In some communities of the Śvētāmbara sect of Jainism, a traditional system of &quot;guru-disciple&quot; lineage exists.

The &quot;guru&quot; is revered in Jainism ritually with &quot;Guru-vandan&quot; or &quot;Guru-upashti&quot;, where respect and offerings are made to the &quot;guru&quot;, and the &quot;guru&quot; sprinkles a small amount of &quot;vaskep&quot; (a scented powder mixture of sandalwood, saffron, and camphor) on the devotee&#x27;s head with a mantra or blessings.
== In Sikhism ==

In Sikhism, seeking a &quot;Guru&quot; (Gurmukhi: ਗੁਰੂ &quot;gurū&quot;) is of the utmost importance, Guru Nanak writes in Ang (ਅੰਗ):751 (੫੧ of the Guru Granth Sahib:ਗਾਫਲ ਗਿਆਨ ਵਿਹੂਣਿਆ ਗੁਰ ਬਿਨੁ ਗਿਆਨੁ ਨ ਭਾਲਿ ਜੀਉ ॥

O foolish mind, without seeking a Guru, loving devotion with the Almighty is not possible.Guru Amar Das, the third Sikh Guru says knowledge will have no foundation without a Guru

The Guru is the source of all knowledge which is Almighty. In Chaupai Sahib, Guru Gobind Singh states about who is the Guru:

The Sikh gurus were fundamental to the Sikh religion, however the concept in Sikhism differs from other usages. The Punjabi word Sikh derives from the Sanskrit word &quot;shishya&quot;, or disciple and is all about the relationship between the teacher and a student. The concept of Guru in Sikhism stands on two pillars i.e. Miri-Piri (ਮੀਰੀ-ਪੀਰੀ). &#x27;Piri&#x27; means spiritual authority and &#x27;Miri&#x27; means temporal authority. Traditionally, the concept of Guru is considered central in Sikhism, and its main scripture is prefixed as a &quot;Guru&quot;, called Guru Granth Sahib, the words therein called &quot;Gurbani&quot;.

==In Western culture==
As an alternative to established religions in the West, some people in Europe and the US looked to spiritual guides and gurus from India and other countries. Gurus from many denominations traveled to Western Europe and the US and established followings.

In particular during the 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the US. According to the American sociologist David G. Bromley this was partially due to the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the US. According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things &#x27;Eastern&#x27;: the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values.

In the Western world, the term is sometimes used in a derogatory way to refer to individuals who have allegedly exploited their followers&#x27; naiveté, particularly in certain cults or groups in the fields of hippie, new religious movements, self-help, and tantra.

According to the professor in sociology Stephen A. Kent at the University of Alberta and Kranenborg (1974), one of the reasons why in the 1970s young people including hippies turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because they wanted to get &quot;high&quot; without drugs. According to Kent, another reason why this happened so often in the US then, was because some anti-Vietnam War protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of the possibilities to change society through political means, and as an alternative turned to religious means. One example of such group was the Hare Krishna movement (ISKCON) founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demanding lifestyle of bhakti yoga on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.

Some gurus and the groups they lead attract opposition from the Anti-Cult Movement. According to Kranenborg (1984), Jesus Christ fits the Hindu definition and characteristics of a guru.

Environmental activists are sometimes called &quot;gurus&quot; or &quot;prophets&quot; for embodying a moral or spiritual authority and gathering followers. Examples of environmental gurus are John Muir, Henry David Thoreau, Aldo Leopold, George Perkins Marsh, and David Attenborough. Abidin et al. wrote that environmental gurus &quot;merge the boundaries&quot; between spiritual and scientific authority.

=== Viewpoints ===
Gurus and the Guru-shishya tradition have been criticized and assessed by secular scholars, theologians, anti-cultists, skeptics, and religious philosophers.

Jiddu Krishnamurti, groomed to be a world spiritual teacher by the leadership of the Theosophical Society in the early part of the 20th century, publicly renounced this role in 1929 while also denouncing the concept of gurus, spiritual leaders, and teachers, advocating instead the unmediated and direct investigation of reality.

U. G. Krishnamurti, [no relation to Jiddu], sometimes characterized as a spiritual anarchist, denied both the value of gurus and the existence of any related worthwhile teaching.

Dr. David C. Lane proposes a checklist consisting of seven points to assess gurus in his book, &quot;Exposing Cults: When the Skeptical Mind Confronts the Mystical&quot;. One of his points is that spiritual teachers should have high standards of moral conduct and that followers of gurus should interpret the behavior of a spiritual teacher by following Ockham&#x27;s razor and by using common sense, and, should not naively use mystical explanations unnecessarily to explain immoral behavior. Another point Lane makes is that the bigger the claim a guru makes, such as the claim to be God, the bigger the chance is that the guru is unreliable. Dr. Lane&#x27;s fifth point is that self-proclaimed gurus are likely to be more unreliable than gurus with a legitimate lineage.

Highlighting what he sees as the difficulty in understanding the guru from Eastern tradition in Western society, Indologist Georg Feuerstein writes in the chapter &quot;Understanding the Guru&quot; in his book &quot;The Deeper Dimension of Yoga: Theory and practice&quot;: &quot;The traditional role of the guru, or spiritual teacher, is not widely understood in the West, even by those professing to practice Yoga or some other Eastern tradition entailing discipleship. [...] Spiritual teachers, by their very nature, swim against the stream of conventional values and pursuits. They are not interested in acquiring and accumulating material wealth or in competing in the marketplace, or in pleasing egos. They are not even about morality. Typically, their message is of a radical nature, asking that we live consciously, inspect our motives, transcend our egoic passions, overcome our intellectual blindness, live peacefully with our fellow humans, and, finally, realize the deepest core of human nature, the Spirit. For those wishing to devote their time and energy to the pursuit of conventional life, this kind of message is revolutionary, subversive, and profoundly disturbing&quot;. In his &quot;Encyclopedic Dictionary of Yoga&quot; (1990), Dr. Feuerstein writes that the importation of &quot;yoga&quot; to the West has raised questions as to the appropriateness of spiritual discipleship and the legitimacy of spiritual authority.

A British professor of psychiatry, Anthony Storr, states in his book, &quot;Feet of Clay: A Study of Gurus&quot;, that he confines the word guru (translated by him as &quot;revered teacher&quot;) to persons who have &quot;special knowledge&quot; who tell, referring to their special knowledge, how other people should lead their lives. He argues that gurus share common character traits (e.g. being loners) and that some suffer from a mild form of schizophrenia. He argues that gurus who are authoritarian, paranoid, , or who interfere in the private lives of their followers are the ones who are more likely to be unreliable and dangerous. Storr also refers to Eileen Barker&#x27;s checklist to recognize false gurus. He contends that some so-called gurus claim special spiritual insights based on personal revelation, offering new ways of spiritual development and paths to salvation. Storr&#x27;s criticism of gurus includes the possible risk that a guru may exploit his or her followers due to the authority that he or she may have over them, though Storr does acknowledge the existence of morally superior teachers who refrain from doing so. He holds the view that the idiosyncratic belief systems that some gurus promote were developed during a period of psychosis to make sense of their own minds and perceptions, and that these belief systems persist after the psychosis has gone. Storr notes that gurus generalize their experience to all people. Some of them believe that all humanity should accept their vision, while others teach that when the end of the world comes, only their followers will be saved, and the rest of the people will remain unredeemed. According to him, this ″apparently arrogant assumption″ is closely related and other characteristics of various gurus. Storr applies the term &quot;guru&quot; to figures as diverse as Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, Gurdjieff, Rudolf Steiner, Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud, Jim Jones and David Koresh. 

Rob Preece, a psychotherapist and a practicing Buddhist, writes in &quot;The Noble Imperfection&quot; that while the teacher/disciple relationship can be an invaluable and fruitful experience, the process of relating to spiritual teachers also has its hazards. He writes that these potential hazards are the result of &quot;naiveté&quot; amongst Westerners as to the nature of the guru/devotee relationship, as well as a consequence of a lack of understanding on the part of Eastern teachers as to the nature of Western psychology. Preece introduces the notion of transference to explain the manner in which the guru/disciple relationship develops from a more Western psychological perspective. He writes: &quot;In its simplest sense transference occurs when unconsciously a person endows another with an attribute that actually is projected from within themselves.&quot; In developing this concept, Preece writes that, when we transfer an inner quality onto another person, we may be giving that person a power over us as a consequence of the projection, carrying the potential for great insight and inspiration, but also the potential for great danger: &quot;In giving this power over to someone else they have a certain hold and influence over us it is hard to resist, while we become enthralled or spellbound by the power of the archetype&quot;.

The psychiatrist Alexander Deutsch performed a long-term observation of a small cult, called &quot;The Family&quot; (not to be confused with Family International), founded by an American guru called &quot;Baba&quot; or &quot;Jeff&quot; in New York in 1972, who showed increasingly schizophrenic behavior. Deutsch observed that this man&#x27;s mostly Jewish followers interpreted the guru&#x27;s pathological mood swings as expressions of different Hindu deities and interpreted his behavior as &quot;holy madness&quot;, and his cruel deeds as punishments that they had earned. After the guru dissolved the cult in 1976, his mental condition was confirmed by Jeff&#x27;s retrospective accounts to an author.

Jan van der Lans (1933–2002), a professor of the psychology of religion at the Catholic University of Nijmegen, wrote, in a book commissioned by the Netherlands-based Catholic Study Center for Mental Health, about followers of gurus and the potential dangers that exist when personal contact between the guru and the disciple is absent, such as an increased chance of idealization of the guru by the student (myth making and deification), and an increase of the chance of false mysticism. He further argues that the deification of a guru is a traditional element of Eastern spirituality but, when detached from the Eastern cultural element and copied by Westerners, the distinction between the person who is the guru and that which he symbolizes is often lost, resulting in the relationship between the guru and disciple degenerating into a boundless, uncritical personality cult.

In their 1993 book, &quot;The Guru Papers&quot;, authors Diana Alstad and Joel Kramer reject the guru-disciple tradition because of what they see as its structural defects. These defects include the authoritarian control of the guru over the disciple, which is in their view increased by the guru&#x27;s encouragement of surrender to him. Alstad and Kramer assert that gurus are likely to be hypocrites because, in order to attract and maintain followers, gurus must present themselves as purer than and superior to ordinary people and other gurus.

According to the journalist Sacha Kester, in a 2003 article in the Dutch newspaper &quot;De Volkskrant&quot;, finding a guru is a precarious matter, pointing to the many holy men in India and the case of Sathya Sai Baba whom Kester considers a swindler. In this article he also quotes the book &quot;Karma Cola&quot; describing that in this book a German economist tells author Gita Mehta, &quot;It is my opinion that quality control has to be introduced for gurus. Many of my friends have become crazy in India&quot;. She describes a comment by Suranya Chakraverti who said that some Westerners do not believe in spirituality and ridicule a true guru. Other westerners, Chakraverti said, on the other hand believe in spirituality but tend to put faith in a guru who is a swindler.

<text>Asda Stores Limited (), trading as Asda and often styled as ASDA, is a British supermarket and petrol station chain. Its headquarters are in Leeds, England. The company was incorporated as Associated Dairies and Farm Stores in 1949. It expanded into Southern England during the 1970s and 1980s, and acquired Allied Carpets, 61 large Gateway Supermarkets and other businesses, such as MFI Group. It sold these acquisitions during the 1990s to concentrate on the supermarkets. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until 1999 when it was acquired by Walmart for £6.7 billion. Asda was the second-largest supermarket chain in the United Kingdom between 2003 and 2014 by market share, at which point it fell into third place. As of January 2025 its market share in the UK is 12.6 per cent.

Besides its core supermarkets, the company also acts as a white label payment card provider offering assistance for insurance and payment services under the Asda Money brand and also has a mobile virtual network operator.

In February 2021, the Issa brothers and TDR Capital acquired Asda, with Walmart retaining &quot;an equity investment&quot; in Asda, a seat on the board and &quot;an ongoing commercial relationship&quot;. The deal came after an acquisition by Sainsbury&#x27;s was rejected by the Competition and Markets Authority. As of June 2024, the company is majority owned by TDR Capital following the sale of Zuber Issa&#x27;s 22.5 per cent holding to the company.

==History==
===Early years===
The Asquith family were butchers based in Knottingley, Wakefield, West Yorkshire. In the 1920s, they expanded their business to seven butchers shops in the area. Their sons, Peter and Fred, later became founding members of Asda.

Around the same time, a group of West Riding dairy farmers, including the Stockdale family and Craven Dairies, joined under the banner of J. W. Hindell Dairy Farmers Ltd. The company diversified in 1949 to become Associated Dairies and Farm Stores Ltd, with Arthur Stockdale as the managing director.

===1960s and 1970s===
In 1963, the Asquith brothers converted an old cinema, the Queens in Castleford, into a self-service supermarket. Another followed in the old indoor market at Edlington. Both stores traded under the name of &#x27;Queens&#x27;. Their next store was a purpose-built supermarket in South Elmsall, a town in which Asda has a distribution centre to this day.

In 1965, the Asquith brothers approached Associated Dairies to run the butchery departments within their small store chain. A merger was proposed and the Asquiths&#x27; business was joined with Noel Stockdale&#x27;s to form a new company, Asda (Asquith + Dairies) (capitalised from 1985).

By 1967, the company had set up a store in Billingham, County Durham. By 1969, Noel Stockdale bought out the Asquith brothers&#x27; stake and became chairman of the company.

Asda took advantage of the abolition of retail price maintenance to offer large-scale, low-cost supermarkets. This was aided by the decision to acquire three struggling US-owned branches in the mid-1960s of the GEM retail group. The Government Exchange Mart stores in Preston, Lancashire, Cross Gates, Leeds and West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, had accumulated losses of £320,000 and offered to sell the stores for 20% of whatever Asda could recoup as losses from the Inland Revenue. They received the whole amount back. The rent was only 10 shillings (50p) per square foot on a 20-year lease, with no rent reviews, Asda increased GEM&#x27;s £6,000 per week sales to around £60,000 per week in just six months with the new stores named as Asda.

During the 1970s, with over 30 stores in the north of England, Asda began expanding south, with the opening of new stores in the Estover area of Plymouth, Devon and Gosport, Hampshire in 1977. In 1978, Asda acquired Allied Carpets.

In 1982, the first London store opened in Park Royal, near Ealing. The Isle of Dogs and Charlton, London stores followed on rapidly thereafter.

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1984, managing director, John Hardman, made attempts to halt Asda&#x27;s decline, which included the introduction of Asda branded products. In 1985, Asda merged with MFI (Mullard Furniture Industries) and the group was renamed Asda-MFI Group plc.

Asda established its headquarters at &quot;Asda House&quot;. The site was officially opened in 1988 by the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.

By the end of the 1990s, the &#x27;Asdale&#x27;-named clothing range was replaced by the clothing ranges from the newly formed George Davies partnership with Asda.

====Near bankruptcy and merger prospects====
With stores mainly based in the North of England, the newly focused food retail group expanded further south in 1989 by purchasing the large format stores of rival Gateway Superstores for £705 million. This significantly increased Asda&#x27;s total selling area, but the company had borrowed heavily in order to fund the purchase – city estimates suggested that Asda had overpaid by around £300 million for 61 of the largest Gateway stores, two undeveloped store sites and a distribution centre. That was far above the net book value of the locations, some of which were poorly sited. (Asda has subsequently relocated or rebuilt more than 30 of the original Gateway stores since the late 1990s.) The move left the company overstretched as a result, and by 1991, it found itself in serious financial trouble with over £1 billion of debt; compounding the situation further was a declining customer base, which was mainly caused by Asda&#x27;s focus on moving upmarket resulting in prices rising to levels significantly higher than competitors.

Eventually, a combination of flagging profits, a tremendous debt and a loss of customers left Asda in such an egregious financial situation that they came very close to breaching their banking covenants; at one point, they almost entered administration. The company&#x27;s first response was to change its management; chairman John Hardman was ousted in June 1991 and was replaced by Patrick Gillam, and Archie Norman was appointed chief executive in October. Asda then completed a rights issue in November 1991 that raised £357 million and cut the company&#x27;s debts to £668 million. In May 1992, Asda reduced their prices back to their traditional level (5–7% below competitors) and announced that they would eliminate over 500 management positions. Underperforming stores were initially converted to a new discount format called &quot;Dales&quot; but this had been ended by 1998. In 1993, Asda completed a second rights issue that raised a further £347 million and began selling off some of its assets; some stores were sold to competitors, and the Allied Carpets chain was sold to Carpetland. By 1995, the company had returned to profitability and had virtually wiped out its debt – this is cited as one of the most successful turnarounds in British retail history.

Norman succeeded Gillam as chairman upon the latter&#x27;s retirement in 1996, appointing then-deputy Allan Leighton as chief executive, and began to remodel Asda&#x27;s stores along the lines of Walmart, the world&#x27;s largest retailer. Leighton travelled to Bentonville, Arkansas, to assess and photograph the systems and marketing deployed by Walmart. In 1998, following the Walmart model, Asda began opening larger &#x27;Hypermarket&#x27; (later &#x27;Supercentre&#x27;) stores as well as introducing pharmacies and cafes to its stores. At the same time, merger discussions were taking place between Asda and other retailers such as Safeway and Kingfisher plc; both collapsed without an agreement being reached, but in 1999, a second round of discussions with Kingfisher later reached an agreement for a £5.4 billion merger that would have both created the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest multi-category retailer and enabled Asda to begin operating stores throughout Europe.

===2000s and 2010s: Walmart years===
A merger deal was abandoned when Walmart outbid Kingfisher to purchase Asda for £6.7 billion, which was completed on 26 July 1999 in a move that was initially speculated by British media outlets as a potential corporate raid. Shortly after the takeover, Norman resigned as chairman and left the company to pursue his political career; he was succeeded as chairman by Leighton. As Walmart were keen on entering the British market, Bob Martin, Walmart&#x27;s president of international operations, lobbied Prime Minister Tony Blair on planning issues.

In 2005, amid reported concerns within Walmart about a slippage in market share, partially due to a resurgent Sainsbury&#x27;s, Asda&#x27;s chief executive, Tony De Nunzio left, and was replaced by Andy Bond. In 2005, Asda expanded into Northern Ireland by purchasing 12 former Safeway stores from Morrisons.

Asda&#x27;s property development arm, Gazeley Limited, was sold to Economic Zones World (EZW), a Dubai World subsidiary, in June 2008 for in excess of £300 million.

In November 2008, there were reports that Asda was to buy Irish retailer Dunnes Stores.

In August 2009, Walmart sold Asda for £6.9 billion to its Leeds-based investment subsidiary Corinth Services Limited. The deal was described as part of a &quot;group restructuring&quot; and meant Asda remained under the control of Walmart, since Corinth is itself a Walmart subsidiary.

In April 2010, Asda announced plans to open over 100 new non-food stores as part of an ambitious five-year plan. These plans were mothballed shortly after because of the recession and the reining in of spending by consumers on non-food purchases.

On 11 May 2010, Andy Clarke, the chief operating officer, was appointed as CEO. In the same month Asda bought the original Netto UK supermarket chain in a £778 million deal.

In February 2011, Asda announced the purchase of six stores from Focus DIY; five of these were converted into supermarkets later that year.

On 16 April 2012, Asda launched their Android grocery shopping app and mobile website for non-grocery items with a plan to fully integrate mobile platforms into stores. The app allowed customers to create shopping lists and scan item barcodes for more information about them.

In 2015, Asda adopted Walmart&#x27;s slogan: &quot;Save Money. Live Better&quot;. Around the same time they adopted an updated logo, with Walmart&#x27;s yellow spark surrounding the first letter. The spark was later removed.

In June 2016, it was announced that Andy Clarke, CEO since 2010, would be replaced by Sean Clarke, the head of parent company Walmart&#x27;s operations in China.

In October 2017, Asda announced that the current CEO, Sean Clarke would be replaced by Roger Burnley, the deputy CEO, from 1 January 2018, and the sixth CEO since 2000.

In November 2017, Asda recruited Jesús Lorente, from French hypermarket retailer Carrefour. He became CMO (Chief Merchandising Officer), in January 2018, and was put in charge of the fresh food and general merchandise offer within all stores. After reportedly clashing with Roger Burnley and only six months in his post, Lorente left Asda at the end of July 2018. His role was divided up between Burnley and Anthony Hemmerdinger.

====Abandoned merger with Sainsbury&#x27;s====
In April 2018, Sainsbury&#x27;s and Walmart announced negotiations about a possible merger of Sainsbury&#x27;s and Asda, creating the largest supermarket chain in the UK. Under the plans, Walmart would own 42% of the combined business, which would be led by the existing chief executive of Sainsbury&#x27;s, Mike Coupe. The group would also open branches of Argos within Asda stores. The merger underwent intense scrutiny by a cross-party group of MPs, chairing select committees for the proposed merger, along with the Competition and Markets Authority, investigating the impact of how the deal could negatively affect the retail industry by a possible reduction of consumer choice for shoppers resulting in price rises, and of how suppliers, especially smaller, family-owned companies could be squeezed by the combined group. The CMA were inundated with complaints by suppliers and other major retailers of the damage they felt would be inflicted upon them if the deal was approved. On 25 April 2019 the CMA blocked the proposed merger, suggesting that it would increase prices for consumers and make competition unfair for the other UK retailers, Sainsbury&#x27;s then announced that it was abandoning the merger.

=== 2020s ===
In October 2020, the first Asda sustainability store was opened in Middleton, Leeds, featuring refill stations, loose fruit and vegetables, and recycling stations, as well as a community zone.

In December 2024, Asda trialled the electronic labels on shelves at Manchester Oxford Road store for 12 weeks. Prices in these labels could be updated in only 15 seconds.

In February 2025, Jo Whitfield rejoined Asda as a non-executive director after 8 years. 

==== Acquisition by the Issa brothers and TDR Capital ====
In February 2021, Mohsin Issa, Zuber Issa and TDR Capital acquired Asda, which at the time was valued at £6.8 billion. Walmart retained &quot;an equity investment&quot; in Asda, a seat on the board and &quot;an ongoing commercial relationship&quot;. In the same month, Asda said that it might need to put 5,000 jobs at risk as part of reconstruction plan in the context of people shopping online.

In March 2021, Asda was involved in the &quot;largest ever sterling bond offering&quot; as part of the financing package to fund the acquisition purchase by TDR Capital and the Issa brothers.

In May 2023, it was reported that the Issa brothers and TDR Capital had together contributed just £200 million for their purchase of Asda, worth £6.8 billion; the majority of the purchase price was funded by a loan from the parent company of heavily indebted EG Group, and by disposing of Asda assets.

In October 2023, Asda completed a £2.27billion acquisition of EG Group property, this mainly consisting of 356 forecourt sites, where the existing Spar stores at these locations were rebranded to either Asda Express. The deal also included ownership of fast-food chain Leon, as well as the purchase of 462 Burger King, Greggs and Subway franchises. Asda would later collaborate with Sbarro to integrate franchises.

In June 2024, Zuber Issa announced he will sell his 22.5% stake in Asda to TDR Capital which would make them the majority owner, controlling 67.5% of the company in the third quarter of 2024. The sale was completed 5 months later, in November 2024.

In September 2024, it was announced that Lord Rose would succeeded Mohsin Issa as CEO and be supported by TDR Capital&#x27;s Rob Hattrell. Mohsin would retain his ownership stake in Asda, as well as a non-executive director role. He would return to EG Group to be its sole chief executive.

In November 2024, Allan Leighton was appointed chairman; he had been chief executive from 1996 to 2000. During that month Asda announced that they were ordering staff back to the office at least three days a week and cutting head office jobs in an attempt to halt the supermarket’s decline.

In early 2025, Asda refinanced £3.2 billion of its debts, delaying the repayment of bonds in 2026, though at a high interest rate of about 8%.

==== New brand identity ====

On 16 May 2024, Asda launched the new brand identity, with new logo, typography and colour scheme. It also features a new slogan: &quot;That&#x27;s More Like It&quot;, and new typefaces designed by Colophon: &quot;Asda Display&quot;, &quot;Asda Subline&quot; and &quot;Asda Text&quot;; in addition to fruit stickers and a new darker green colour. It also features unique features, such as a crossbar under the pence numerals.

The new brand identity has proved popular across the design community, with &quot;The Drum&quot; describing as &quot;less shiny and corporate&quot;, &quot;less American and much softer&quot; and &quot;honest, down-to-earth, playful style&quot;. However, a few people criticized the new brand identity, especially related to accessibility. In general, the new brand identity overall takes a fun, playful approach.

==== £50 million store upgrade programme ====

On 30 May 2024, Asda announced that it will be launching a £50 million store upgrade programme to refurbish its 170 stores, including 50 larger stores, by late November 2024.

The 50 larger stores would be refurbished to include new features, including seasonal and food-to-go aisles, counters, flooring and lighting, and, in some stores, new George departments.

The 120 other stores would also be refurbished to adopt the new brand identity.

==Store formats==
===Asda Supercentres===

Following the takeover by Walmart, several &quot;Asda Walmart Supercentres&quot; opened, creating some of the largest hypermarkets in the United Kingdom. Since 2006, all new Supercentres have been solely branded as &quot;Asda Supercentre&quot; without the Walmart branding. The first Supercentre with a sales area of opened in Patchway, Bristol in the summer of 2000. The first Scottish Supercentre opened in Livingston, in 2001.

The Bletchley, Milton Keynes Supercentre which opened in November 2005 is currently the largest Asda Supercentre with a net sales floor of over . This was preceded in June 2002 by the Eastlands, Manchester store which was the largest store at the time with a sales area of but is currently the second largest Asda Supercentre, and the third largest is located in Minworth, West Midlands, followed by Patchway. As of 31 January 2021, there are 32 Supercentres.

===Asda Superstores===
Asda superstores are large supermarkets with a non-food offer slightly smaller than an Asda Supercentre. As of 31 January 2021, there are 342 superstores. Most superstores have a petrol filling station and dining and refreshment facilities for shoppers such as customer cafes, and selected stores have McDonald&#x27;s franchise restaurants or &quot;Express Diners&quot;. The Old Kent Road, Scunthorpe Colindale and Brunstane stores previously trialled a Subway franchise. There are currently no plans to roll the Subway franchise out across the chain. 

===Asda Supermarket===

In May 2010, Asda announced the purchase of the 193 UK stores of Danish discount retailer Netto in a £778 million deal. But the Competition Commission made them sell off 47 of the stores to other retailers. The remaining stores continued to trade as Netto stores until early 2011, when Asda integrated the stores into its supermarkets division, designated for shops smaller than . These former Netto stores form the core of the Asda Supermarket format. As of 31 January 2021, there are 207 supermarkets.

===Asda Living===

In October 2003, Asda launched a new format called Asda Living. This is the company&#x27;s first &quot;general merchandise&quot; store, containing all its non-food ranges including clothing, home electronics, toys, homewares, health, and beauty products. With these stores they have linked up with Compass Group who operate the coffee shop Living Cafe within some of the stores. The first store with this format opened in Walsall, West Midlands. As at 31 January 2021, there are 33 stores.

===George stores===
In 2004, the George clothing brand was extended to a number of standalone George stores on the high street; the first George standalone store to open was in Preston. In 2008, all George standalone stores were closed due to high rental costs resulting in low profitability.

In 2011, Asda announced its intention to establish a small number of pilot George stores. In January 2012 Asda announced that it had agreed to terms with two franchise partners to open international George stores. Through the agreement with SandpiperCI, based in the Channel Islands, the company will be responsible for opening George franchises in both Jersey and Guernsey, and through the Azadea Group, headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon, the George franchise stores would open in the Middle East.

===Asda Essentials===
In April 2006, Asda launched a new trial format called &#x27;Asda Essentials&#x27; in Northampton, followed by another in Pontefract a month later. The stores were modelled on France&#x27;s Leader Price chain, with a smaller floorplate than Asda&#x27;s mainstream stores and with a primary focus on own-brand products, only stocking branded items that were perceived to be at the &quot;core&quot; of a family&#x27;s weekly shop with the aim being to challenge the dominance of Tesco and Sainsbury&#x27;s in the convenience store market while at the same time addressing competition from discount supermarkets such as Aldi, Lidl and Netto.

On 6 December 2006, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that further planned store openings were under review following poor sales in the existing outlets, while the range of branded products being carried was also being expanded due to customer demand. In January 2007 it was announced that the original Northampton trial store would close within a month after only 10 months of trading.

===Asda Petrol===

In 2012, Asda trialled a new standalone petrol filling station format (which means that they are not attached to or near an existing Asda store) at two locations in Sale, Greater Manchester and Leeds Bridge, which is located opposite head office. They include a small convenience store and click and collect facilities. The trial was a success and in 2014, a full roll out of this format was announced after a third site opened in Northolt, West London. In February 2015, 15 petrol filling stations were acquired from Rontec Ltd, and converted to the new format. Asda originally aimed to have at least 100 standalone forecourts by 2018. However, in October 2015, the company decided to slow the roll out down to address the problems associated with a major collapse of profits from its large store formats due to intense competition from its main rivals. But, the company is still continuing to add a combination of fully automated credit/debit card payment only petrol stations and petrol stations with traditional forecourt shops within the car parks of its existing store portfolio and to new store sites.

Asda was also the first supermarket chain in the United Kingdom to sell petrol at its old Halifax store in 1967, which at the time was located inside a converted mill in Battinson Road which burnt down during a major fire in 1982, and subsequently reopened as a purpose-built store in 1983, without the petrol station. The store moved to a different site in 2004. Back then its forecourt fuel was supplied by discount Russian supplier Nafta, because the major oil companies would not supply fuel to be sold at discount prices. From the early seventies, oil companies such as Mobil, Shell and Texaco supplied fuel to Asda as more supermarkets started to sell fuel from car park forecourts. Since the mid-1990s Asda has supplied, along with its main supermarket rivals, its own fuel delivered by its own tankers to its petrol station forecourts. As of June 2018, Asda operates 319 petrol stations in total, 18 of which are standalone and the others mostly within the car park area of its stores.

===Asda On the Move===

A petrol station convenience store format launched by EG Group in October 2020, soon after the Issa brothers&#x27; takeover of Asda. The first store opened at the Primley service station in Walsall with 150 outlets trading by April 2023. The Asda On the Move format is designed to gain more market share by entering the convenience market.

===Asda Express===

In November 2022, Asda opened its first convenience stores in the Asda Express portfolio, with the initial stores located in Sutton Coldfield and Tottenham Hale. Due to acquiring the majority of EG Group and Co-op&#x27;s forecourts, this number increased from 2 to 478, this number will increase to 778 by 2026.

==Brands and services==

===Just Essentials by Asda===
Just Essentials by Asda, formerly known as Asda Smartprice, is a no-frills private label trade name introduced in 2022, to lower food prices and help struggling customers since the cost of living crisis that began in the UK in 2021, which saw grocery inflation reach several record all-time highs; and retailers battle to retain hard-pressed customers to maintain sales.

===Chosen By You===
In 2010, Asda relaunched its mid-tier Asda own label brand. Asda announced that it would be scrapping the &quot;Chosen By You&quot; brand starting in 2016 and most food products are being moved to a &quot;by Asda&quot; brand.

===George clothing===

Asda has its own range of clothing known as George, which was created and trialled in selected stores in 1989, and officially launched and rolled out to the main superstore estate in 1990. It replaced the older Asdale/Asda clothing labels of the 1970s and 1980s. This is marketed as quality fashion clothing at affordable prices. Walmart also sells the George brand in Argentina, Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the US (and in South Korea until Walmart pulled out of that market). George clothing is also sold at four stand alone dedicated stores in Malta, the first of which opened in 2013. George is a participant in the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (SCAP), the ambition of which is to improve the sustainability of clothing throughout its life cycle by helping to reduce the impacts of carbon, water and waste across the fashion sector. The label is named after George Davies, founder of Next, who was its original chief designer. Davies himself parted company with Asda in 2000 and is no longer associated with the brand.

In 2005, Asda stated that the George range was a £1.75 billion business, including sales from Walmart stores in the United States and Germany. Mintel estimate that George is the fourth-largest retailer of clothing in the United Kingdom, after Marks &amp; Spencer, the Arcadia Group and Next.

Asda was the first supermarket to stock wedding dresses. Part of the George line, they cost £60 while adult bridesmaid dresses ranged between £30 and £35, at launch.

===Asda Mobile===

Asda also operates a mobile phone network called Asda Mobile, which was launched in April 2007. This was previously provided in partnership with EE, but then in 2021 moved to Vodafone.

===Asda Money===
Asda has a financial services brand which offers products provided by other companies. Services offered include car insurance (in partnership with Vast Visibility Limited), credit cards (issued by Jaja Finance Ltd), personal loans (issued by Aro Finance) and travel money bureaux (provided by Travelex). The financial services division of the organisation does not directly sell these services in store and instead uses the supplier of that product by telephone or online/postal application. Marketing and management of financial services is co-ordinated in house and many stores have a financial services co-ordinator, responsible for promoting the products and ensuring legal compliance. The Financial Services division is also responsible for gift cards, Christmas Saver and Business Rewards.

===Medicine===
Many larger stores have an on-site pharmacy. In July 2020, the company started an in-store virtual general practitioner service in partnership with health tech company Medicspot. It is to be launched at the Asda Supercentre in Stevenage. Real-time diagnostics – a connected stethoscope, pulse oximeter, blood pressure monitor, contactless thermometer, and a close inspection camera – will be available in the pharmacy and patients can consult a GP remotely without the need to book an appointment in advance. It was initially free, but after 4 July; a charge of £49 was introduced. The ASDA pharmacy in Chelmsley Wood joined with local GP practices to deliver flu vaccinations from a van parked outside in October 2020.

=== Asda Radio ===
Asda Radio is the in store radio station for Asda superstores.

The radio station was originally known as Asda FM, live broadcasting began on 7 September 1991, and it was operated by KVHstudios in Leeds. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, it has a captive listenership of over 18million people each week. In 2018, Asda switched the contract for Asda FM from KVHstudios to Mood Media and relaunched as Asda Radio.

=== Asda Rewards ===

Asda Rewards is a loyalty programme introduced in August 2022, through which customers can fill the &quot;Cashpot&quot; via missions, where customers can earn cashbacks, named as &quot;Asda Pounds&quot;, by spending a certain amount on items, and by using an Asda Money credit card, where customers earn 1% cashback when spending at Asda using the card and 0.3% when spending elsewhere. The app is available on App Store and Google Play Store. By April 2024, Asda Rewards had 6 million users, which they saved a total of £400 million in cashback.

Customers can turn cashback into vouchers, which these can be redeemed in store or online. These vouchers expire after 6 months.

Asda Rewards was first trialled across 16 stores in October 2021, particularly in the West Yorkshire and West Midlands and later expanded to 48 stores.

In December 2022, many Asda Rewards customers reported problems with their app that dozens of pounds of cashback is missing. From January 2023, to improve security, Asda Rewards requires a phone number to sign up, and prompted logged-in customers to enter their phone numbers.

In September 2024, Asda announced that, through Asda Rewards, it will be donating 0.5% of money spent at Asda by consumers to primary schools, up to £7.5 million in total.

In February 2025, Asda changed the reward scheme, removing the Star Products. Previously, customers could get a 10% return in money when they spend on Star Products, but it is no longer the case, citing a &quot;Rollback&quot; campaign that was about to happen. However, while some Asda customers appreciated the next &quot;Rollback&quot; campaign was a replacement, most Asda customers criticized for the change, preferring to go to other supermarkets.

==Distribution==
Asda has 25 distribution depots across the UK. Three of Asda&#x27;s distribution centres (Rochdale CDC, Doncaster GM &amp; Larne) are outsourced to Wincanton PLC.

In September 2021, it was announced that Asda would trial autonomous delivery vans in London in collaboration with Wayve, a UK-based autonomous mobility startup. The 12-month trial was agreed to take place in early 2022. The autonomous vans will operate with the supervision of a Wayve safety driver. Asda and Wayve aim to use their capabilities to bring autonomy into the online grocery space and look for ways to improve last-mile delivery with technology.

==Employee relations==
The company has featured prominently in lists of &quot;Best companies to work for&quot;, appearing in second place in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper list for 2005. It offers staff a discount of 10% on most items (exceptions include fuel, stamps, lottery, giftcards and tobacco related items).

The company was fined £850,000 in 2006 for offering 340 staff at a Dartford depot a pay rise in return for giving up a union collective bargaining agreement.
Poor relations continued as Asda management attempted to introduce new rights and working practices shortly thereafter at another centre in Washington, Tyne and Wear.

Some compromise was reached by June of that year, when a five-day strike was called off after Asda management and the GMB union reached an agreement.

Relations have improved since, with both Asda and the GMB marking the death of a worker together on Workers&#x27; Memorial Day in 2010.

In 2013, tens of thousands of Asda workers across the UK were hit with a tax complication because of an anomaly in Asda&#x27;s payroll system. Asda employees receive their pay every four weeks, which meant, according to their spokesperson, that once every 20 years they are paid 14 times a year rather than 13. Whilst most companies handle this properly, Asda&#x27;s payroll system did not, which meant that workers had, through no fault of their own, paid less tax for the year than they should have. This resulted in most full-time and a small number of part-time workers receiving a demand from HM Revenue &amp; Customs for between £72 and £160.

In 2016, Asda became involved in a protracted equal pay dispute with its lower-paid shop staff, who were supported by GMB. 44,000 employees argued that store workers were paid less because most were women, while most distribution depot staff, paid more, were men, violating the Equal Pay Act 1970 and Equality Act 2010. In March 2021 the employees won a Supreme Court case upholding an earlier court ruling. This did not itself give the claimants the right to equal pay, but enabled them to take the case to an employment tribunal to decide &quot;equal value&quot; claims. Asda stated &quot;This ruling relates to one stage of a complex case that is likely to take several years to reach a conclusion.&quot; The claim could lead to about £500 million of compensation to lower-paid employees.

==Marketing==
===Campaigns===
In the &#x27;Asda price&#x27; campaign, customers tap their trouser pocket twice, producing a &#x27;chinking&#x27; sound as the coins that Asda&#x27;s low prices have supposedly left in their pockets knock together. The pocket tap ads were launched in 1977 and over the next 30 years, a range of celebrities have been &quot;tappers&quot;, including from 1978, actors Richard Beckinsale, Paula Wilcox, James Bolam and later, Julie Walters, and football player Michael Owen. In the late 1970s, adverts also included actor Leonard Rossiter.

In 1980, &quot;Carry On&quot; actress Hattie Jacques appeared in the advert as a school crossing patrol officer. Between 1981 and 1985, Asda used the slogan &quot;All Together Better&quot; in conjunction with the &#x27;Asda Price&#x27; pocket tap campaign in TV commercials and newspaper and magazine advertisements. When the new green capitalised ASDA logo started to appear from 1985, in early 1986 onwards and until early 1989, two slogans were used. The first, &#x27;You&#x27;d be off your trolley to go anywhere else&#x27;, was replaced in 1987 by &#x27;One trip and you&#x27;re laughing&#x27;.

In 1989, and until late 1991, before the reintroduction of the pocket tap campaign, advertising for Asda had featured the Fairground Attraction song &quot;Perfect&quot; with the slogan &#x27;It &#x27;Asda be Asda&#x27;, which was based upon the lyrics of the song. When the Asda Price slogan was reintroduced in 1992, the strapline Pocket the Difference (capitalised) was added alongside it. This was replaced by &#x27;Permanently Low Prices, Forever&#x27; in 1996.

From 1990 to 1991, Asda were the sponsors of Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

In August 2005, rival supermarket chain Tesco complained to the Advertising Standards Agency about Asda&#x27;s claim that it was the cheapest supermarket in the country. The ASA upheld the complaint and ordered Asda to stop using the claim.

In 2006, Asda advertising was themed around singing children and the slogan &quot;More for you for less&quot;.

For Christmas 2007, Asda reintroduced the &quot;That&#x27;s Asda price&quot; slogan.

In 2008, the company refocused on price with a &quot;Why Pay More?&quot; campaign both on TV and in stores. Asda TV commercials in April 2009 focused on price comparisons between Asda and its rivals, using information from mySupermarket. The music being used in these adverts is the Billy Childish version of the classic &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; theme tune. The old Asda jingle is not included in these, but appeared in a 2008 Christmas advert.

In the smiley face &quot;rollback&quot; campaign, also used by Walmart, a CGI smiley face bounced from price tag to price tag, knocking them down as customers watch.

In January 2024, Asda introduced the Aldi &amp; Lidl Price Match campaign, which aimed to match the prices of hundreds of Asda products to Aldi and Lidi prices. The campaign was discontinued in January 2025.

In January 2025, Asda reintroduced the iconic &quot;Rollback&quot; campaign, which aimed to cut back prices on over 4,000 products by an average of 25%, with additional thousands over regular intervals over the year. The &#x27;Asda Price&#x27; campaign was also reintroduced again in the same month.

===Energy drinks===
In January 2018, Asda became one of the first supermarkets to ban selling energy drinks such as Red Bull to under-16s.

===Ethical trading===
Asda has signed up to the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) which respects workers&#x27; rights for freedom of association and a living wage. Implementing this initiative is difficult, however, because the concept of a living wage varies by country and the buying strategies of a major importer like Asda have an indirect impact on national minimum wages by obliging governments to set them low enough to stop businesses from going elsewhere. Industry pressure groups such as Labour Behind the Label and War on Want have argued that Asda and other budget retailers use unethical labour practices in the developing world to keep UK prices low.

The National Farmers&#x27; Union, representing UK farmers and growers, has argued that Asda and other major supermarkets have made large profits and kept consumer prices low &quot;by squeezing suppliers&#x27; margins to the point where many of them have gone out of business&quot;.

In 2009, Asda&#x27;s Valentine&#x27;s Day roses, sold at £2 for a dozen, were said to be ethically sourced by the supermarket. This claim went against research carried out by War on Want.

===Charities===
As of 2020, Asda supported the following charities through its stores:
* BBC Children in Need – appeal organised by the BBC.
* Breast Cancer Care – women&#x27;s cancer research.
* Everyman – men&#x27;s cancer research.
* Asda Foundation – supporting local causes of Asda store workers, with projects supported across the UK.

==Controversies==

=== Animal welfare ===
Asda has received media attention for the neglect and abuse of animals in its supply chain. In 2020, undercover footage captured turkeys in severely overcrowded sheds, with birds suffering acute injuries from being pecked. Farm workers were seen kicking birds over 200 times.

In 2021, it was revealed unprofitable piglets had been thumped to death at a factory farm linked to Asda. Some pigs were beaten and had their tails cut without pain relief, while others were left with untreated hernias. 

In 2022, The Independent reported that goats had been &quot;shoved and neglected&quot; on an intensive farm supplying Asda. Video taken at the farm showed animals so lame they were unable to access food or water, and dead goats dumped outdoors. Workers were seen hitting and slapping the animals.

===Dairy price fixing===
In December 2007, Asda, Sainsbury&#x27;s and other retailers and dairy firms admitted to the price fixing of dairy products between 2002 and 2003. The price operation was calculated to have cost consumers around £270 million.

Asda commented, &quot;Everyone at Asda regrets what happened, particularly as we are passionate about lowering prices. Our intention was to provide more money for dairy farmers, who were under severe financial pressure at the time.&quot; In total, Asda was fined £18.21 million by the Office of Fair Trading for its part in the cartel.

===False and misleading advertising===
In 2010, a national press ad for Asda on a double-page spread was headed &quot;The big Asda Rollback&quot; with headings stating &quot;Lower prices on everything you buy, week in week out&quot; with equal prominence to a column headed &quot;Lower prices than any other supermarket&quot;; that the arrows underneath the heading &quot;Lower prices than any other supermarket&quot; compared prices at Asda with prices at Sainsbury&#x27;s, Tesco and Morrisons. The ASA ruled that in the context in which it appeared, it was ambiguous in that it could be interpreted either as referring to price reductions that had taken place within Asda or to price comparisons with the named competitors. In addition, because the ad did not explain that the price reductions had not necessarily taken place in the week that immediately preceded the ad, they concluded that the headings which stated the number of price reductions that had taken place in each product category were misleading. The ASA also concluded that the &quot;Lower prices than any other supermarket&quot; claim in the advert was misleading.

The ASA disagreed, and referred to the claim &quot;Everything is at least half price!&quot; was likely to imply to viewers that all toys were included in the sale. As all toys were not included in the sale, and in the absence of a qualifying statement, the ad was misleading.

The ASA ruled in 2011 that a television advertisement and two national press ads did not give sufficient prominence to the fact that exclusions applied.

Another advertisement from Asda, in which it featured World Cup related products and an Asda price guarantee was misleading as the World Cup related products were exclusive to Asda and not, therefore, available at Morrisons, Tesco or Sainsbury&#x27;s.

In 2009, the ASA challenged whether a press ad which showed a large green arrow bearing down on a smaller yellow arrow with a crumpled tip and &quot;Asda 2955 products cheaper&quot; should set out how the general price claims made in the ads could be verified by consumers. Because it was not possible for consumers or competitors to check the products and prices used in the comparison using mySupermarket.co.uk, and because the ads did not set out how consumers and competitors could check that information for themselves, the ASA concluded that the ads did not satisfy the criterion of verifiability as defined in the 2006 European Court of Justice ruling, and were therefore in breach of the advertising Codes.

The ASA ruled that, due to the significant limitations and qualifications to the basis of the price comparison which were not included in the ad, or in the terms and conditions on Asda&#x27;s website, the approach taken in making the comparisons was unfair and misleading.

A press ad, which appeared on 26 September 2011, was headlined &quot;Only one supermarket is ... always 10% cheaper or we&#x27;ll give you the difference guaranteed&quot;. However, at the top of the ad there was a banner that contained the claims &quot;SALE&quot;, &quot;Half Price&quot;, &quot;Price Drop&quot;, &quot;50% off&quot;, &quot;1/2 price&quot;, &quot;cheap&quot; and that part of the headline claim &quot;... always 10% cheaper&quot; appeared in bold text in the middle of the ad. The ASA considered the banner, together with the headline was likely to be interpreted by consumers as claims that referred to the price of Asda goods. Since consumers could interpret that claim as one which guaranteed to refund the difference, should Asda not be the lowest on price, the ASA considered the presence of the claim &quot;only one supermarket is always 10% cheaper&quot; could create the impression that Asda were always 10% cheaper and would be interpreted as a &#x27;lowest price&#x27; claim. The ASA therefore concluded that the advert was misleading. It also noted the footnote explaining the APG contradicted Asda&#x27;s absolute claim that they were always the lowest on price, and that the disclaimer was also misleading.

In 2009, the ASA ruled that an advert for a proposed development in New Barnet was misleading, because it compared the floorspace of the development with the floorspace and additional buildings of a Sainsbury&#x27;s store and with an unapproved Tesco plan.

===2013 horsemeat scandal===

In February 2013, DNA tests revealed that horsemeat was present in meat supplied by many UK suppliers. Asda&#x27;s Chosen By You fresh beef bolognese sauce was the first instance found.

===LGBT support===
Despite apparent dedication to LGBT Pride, diversity, equity, and inclusion and the celebration of its diverse workforce, Asda has been accused several times of homophobic and transphobic behaviour, with a notable &quot;history of transphobia from the brand&quot;.

In 2013, a photograph of a greetings card sold by Asda attracted the attention of press for featuring the anti-trans slur tranny.

During Pride Month in June 2020, amidst the background of the COVID-19 Pandemic, ASDA claimed on Twitter that its temporary LGBT Pride branding, including the use of the Rainbow Flag, was adopted in support of the NHS, and not in support of Pride.

This led to backlash, with many complaining that this statement constituted queer erasure. ASDA later released a statement, claiming that this previous tweet was an &quot;honest mistake&quot; and reiterated that these were indeed the &quot;colours of the pride flag to show our support for the LGBTQ+ community&quot;.

In 2024, Asda was accused of ignoring incidents of transphobia perpetrated by staff towards trans customers, which included incidents of deadnaming and harassment, which &quot;did not match up with the brand&#x27;s regular appearance at, and support for, local Pride events across the country&quot;.

== Market share ==
The market share for Asda varied over time, peaking at 17.6% in 2012 and is falling since then.

<text>HMS &quot;Devonshire&quot;, pennant number 39, was a heavy cruiser of the &quot;London&quot; sub-class built for the Royal Navy in the late 1920s. The ship spent most of her pre-World War II career assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet aside from a brief tour with the China Station. She spent the first two months of the Second World War in the Mediterranean until she was transferred to the Home Fleet and became flagship of a cruiser squadron. &quot;Devonshire&quot; took part in the Norwegian Campaign in mid 1940 and evacuated much of the Norwegian Government in June. Several months later, she participated in the Battle of Dakar, a failed attempt to seize the Vichy French colony of Senegal in September. The ship remained in the South Atlantic afterwards and supported Free French efforts to take control of French Equatorial Africa in addition to searching for German commerce raiders.

&quot;Devonshire&quot; returned home in early 1941 and briefly rejoined the Home Fleet, during which time she escorted several aircraft carriers as they attacked German forces in Norway and Finland and covered the first convoy to the Soviet Union. Shortly afterwards, the ship was sent to the South Atlantic where she sank the auxiliary cruiser . &quot;Devonshire&quot; was then assigned to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean and supported the Allied invasion of Madagascar in mid-1942. She then spent the next year escorting convoys before returning home to begin a lengthy refit. After it was completed in early 1944, the ship escorted various aircraft carriers for the rest of the war as they attacked targets in Norway.

After the German surrender in May 1945, she sailed to Norway and escorted two surrendered German cruisers from Denmark to the UK. &quot;Devonshire&quot; then began ferrying British troops home from Australia for the rest of the year. In 1947, the ship was converted into a training ship for naval cadets and served until she was sold for scrap in 1954.

==Description==
&quot;Devonshire&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving four shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by eight Admiralty 3-drum boilers. &quot;Devonshire&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 784 officers and men.

The ship mounted eight 8-inch (203 mm) guns in four twin gun turrets, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Her secondary armament consisted of four QF Mk V anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts. &quot;Devonshire&quot; also mounted four single 2-pounder (40 mm) light AA guns (&quot;pom-poms&quot;). The ship was equipped with two quadruple torpedo tube above-water mounts for  torpedoes.

&quot;Devonshire&quot; was only lightly protected with little more than a single inch of plating protecting vital machinery. Her magazines were the exception and were protected by of armour. Space and weight was reserved for one aircraft catapult and its seaplane, but they were not fitted until after she was completed.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Devonshire&quot;, the fifth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy, was named for the county. The ship was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 16 March 1926 and was launched on 22 October 1927. Completed on 18 March 1929, she was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron (CS) of the Mediterranean Fleet together with her three sister ships. &quot;Devonshire&quot; spent the bulk of the interbellum period there, aside from a 1932–33 tour with the China Station.

While off the island of Skiathos in the Aegean, she suffered a serious accident on 26 July 1929 during gunnery training. There was a misfire in the left gun of &quot;X&quot; turret; when the breech block was opened the propellant charge inside the barrel detonated, which ignited the charge for the next round. The ensuing explosion killed 18 men. &quot;Devonshire&quot; returned to England for repairs in August with &quot;the turret swung &#x27;round and the guns awry&quot;. In 1929–1930 she received a High-Angle Control System, used to direct her anti-aircraft guns, and a catapult was fitted in 1931–1932. Four more single four-inch AA guns in addition to a pair of quadruple Vickers .50-calibre (12.7 mm) Mark III machine guns were added in 1936–1937.
During the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Devonshire&quot; brought a Nationalist emissary to Menorca on 7 February 1939. The following day, the Republicans surrendered the island to the Nationalists aboard the cruiser and she sailed to Marseille, France, with 452 Republican refugees on board.

===Second World War===
&quot;Devonshire&quot; was in the Mediterranean when the war began in September 1939 until she was transferred to the Home Fleet some months later. After the armed merchant cruiser was sunk by the German battleships and on 23 November, &quot;Devonshire&quot; and the battleships and sailed from the Clyde on a fruitless attempt to find the German ships. In March 1940 she became the flagship of the 1st CS, and flew the flag of the future First Sea Lord, Vice-Admiral John H. D. Cunningham. During this time the squadron was tasked to cover Scotland, the Faeroe Islands and Iceland. As part of the Allied plans to occupy parts of Norway and interdict the iron ore traffic from Narvik to Germany (Operation Wilfred and Plan R 4), &quot;Devonshire&quot; and the rest of the squadron were assigned to ferry British troops from Rosyth to Stavanger and Bergen and to be ready to sail on the morning of 8 April, but these plans were partially preempted by the German invasion that same day.

====Norwegian campaign====

The Admiralty ordered that the troops, but not their equipment, be unloaded from the cruisers on the evening of the 8th, and that the cruisers were to search forthwith for the German ships known to be at sea. This was later cancelled and the squadron was ordered to rendezvous with the main body of the Home Fleet. Later that day, German bombers attacked the British ships and &quot;Devonshire&quot; suffered a near-miss. On the 11th, the squadron was detached on an unsuccessful search for German ships in the area around Trondheim and rejoined the fleet two days later. Cunningham&#x27;s ships were then detached to Tromsø where he conducted negotiations with local officials to refuel there and to bring Norwegian troops west from Kirkenes. The squadron arrived there on the afternoon of the 15th and escorted Norwegian troopships back to Tromsø. &quot;Devonshire&quot; covered the evacuation of British and French troops from Namsos at the beginning of May and was nearly hit when the evacuation forces were attacked by German aircraft as they were withdrawing on 3 May.

&quot;Devonshire&quot; evacuated King Haakon VII, Crown Prince Olav, and Norwegian government officials, including the Prime Minister, Johan Nygaardsvold, from Tromsø on 7 June. On board were 461 passengers. The ship passed within of the action in which the aircraft carrier and two destroyers were sunk by &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. Although an enemy sighting report had been received in &quot;Devonshire&quot;, Cunningham&#x27;s orders were to get Haakon VII to safety, and the cruiser sped up and continued on her course.

====Operation Menace====
In preparation for Operation Menace, a British naval attack on Dakar, Senegal, prior to a planned landing by the Free French, the ship was detached from the Home Fleet on 28 August and was assigned to Force M, the Royal Navy component of the operation. Still Cunningham&#x27;s flagship, she departed the Clyde on the 31st, escorting the troop convoy en route to Gibraltar where they arrived on 3 September. On the 14th, Cunningham dispatched the 1st CS, augmented by the aircraft carrier , in an unsuccessful attempt to locate and turn back a Vichy French cruiser squadron bound for Dakar; by this time he had hoisted his flag in the battleship . &quot;Devonshire&quot; and her Australian sister ship engaged the French cruisers and destroyers as they manoeuvred in the harbour on the second day of the battle, with negligible effect in poor visibility. After &quot;Barham&quot; was lightly damaged during the action, Cunningham transferred back to &quot;Devonshire&quot; for the next day&#x27;s battle during which the ship fired 200 shells from her main guns without scoring a single hit against French ships obscured by smoke screens.

After the attack was abandoned, she was employed to escort a British troop convoy to Douala, French Cameroons, in early October and then blockaded the coast of Gabon when Free French forces invaded in early November. On 7 November, her Supermarine Walrus seaplane helped to sink the Vichy submarine off Gabon.

====1941====
&quot;Devonshire&quot; remained in the South Atlantic and participated in the unsuccessful hunt for the German commerce raider in January 1941. The ship subsequently transferred to the Home Fleet and was refitted in Liverpool 19 February–22 May. During this refit her single 2-pounder guns were replaced by two octuple mounts and an early-warning Type 281 radar. She escorted British carriers when they raided Kirkenes and Petsamo in Norway and Finland in late July. The following month, &quot;Devonshire&quot; provided distant cover for the first convoy to Russia, Operation Dervish, before she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet. Before her departure, the ship received a pair of Oerlikon light AA guns in September. On 2 November, the ship led a force that captured a Vichy convoy bound for French Indochina off South Africa. Twenty days later, &quot;Devonshire&quot; sank a German commerce raider, the auxiliary cruiser &quot;Atlantis&quot;, north of Ascension Island.

====1942–1943====
The ship was subsequently refitted in Norfolk, Virginia from 24 January to 7 March 1942, where she received a Type 273 gunnery radar and six more Oerlikons. After the completion of her refit, &quot;Devonshire&quot; was sent to join the 4th Cruiser Squadron of the Eastern Fleet and escorted a convoy from Charleston, South Carolina, to Freetown, Sierra Leone en route. On 25 April, the ship escorted a convoy from Durban, South Africa to Madagascar as part of Operation Ironclad, which was launched to preempt a possible Japanese occupation of the island. The Vichy French had allowed Japanese forces to use air bases in French Indochina to launch the airstrikes that sank the capital ships &quot;Repulse&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, so it was quite possible they would permit the Japanese access to military facilities on Madagascar had they requested them. During late 1942, &quot;Devonshire&quot;″s single four-inch AA guns were replaced with twin-gun mounts for Mark XVI guns of the same calibre. The ship remained in the Far East until May 1943, covering troop convoys from Suez to Australia. By this time, her quadruple .50-calibre machineguns and six single-Oerlikon mounts had been replaced by another pair of octuple two-pounder mounts and a dozen twin-Oerlikon mounts. She returned home that month and began a lengthy refit that lasted until 20 March 1944. During this refit, &#x27;X&#x27; turret and one twin Oerlikon mount were replaced by two additional octuple two-pounder mounts and eight single-Oerlikon mounts. Her radar suite was modernized with Type 281B replacing Type 281 and the full range of anti-aircraft gunnery radars were installed. To accommodate all the new equipment, her catapult was removed.

====1944–1945====

She returned to duty with the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in April 1944. From July until the end of hostilities in May 1945, &quot;Devonshire&quot; escorted the carrier raids that were mounted on shipping and other targets in Norwegian waters (Operations Mascot, Goodwood, and Hardy).

With the end of the war in Europe, &quot;Devonshire&quot;, now the flagship of Rear-Admiral James Ritchie, the future Flag Officer Norway, sailed on 12 May to Oslo. She then went to Copenhagen the next day, and from there she escorted to the UK the German cruisers and to Wilhelmshaven on 24–26 May. In June, &quot;Devonshire&quot; was again the flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron, under the command of Vice-Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor, which returned King Haakon to Norway, arriving in Oslo on 7 June. The king himself sailed in her half-sister, . Later that month, she was outfitted for use as a troopship, and she was used to transport personnel to and from Australia for the rest of the year. On 29 September, &quot;Devonshire&quot; helped to rescued the survivors of , a freighter loaded with Greek refugees bound from Port Said, Egypt, to Greece, that had caught fire.

===Post-war===
The ship was converted into a cadet training ship in 1947 and served in this role until 1954. As part of this reconstruction most of her armament was removed; by 1949 it consisted of a single eight-inch gun turret, two four-inch gun turrets and single examples of the quadruple two-pounder, single- and twin-Oerlikon mounts, plus a single Bofors light AA gun. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the coronation of Elizabeth II. &quot;Devonshire&quot; was sold for scrap on 16 June 1954 and arrived at Newport, Wales, on 12 December 1954 where she was broken up by John Cashmore Ltd.

<text>Plain language is writing designed to ensure the reader understands as quickly, easily, and completely as possible. Plain language strives to be easy to read, understand, and use. It avoids verbose, convoluted language and jargon. In many countries, laws mandate that public agencies use plain language to increase access to programs and services. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities includes plain language in its definition of &quot;communication&quot;.

==Definition==

Most literacy and communications scholars agree that plain language means:
* &quot;Plain language (also called Plain English) is communication your audience can understand the first time they read or hear it&quot; (Plainlanguage.gov)
* &quot;Clear and effective communication.&quot; (Joseph Kimble)
* &quot;The idiomatic and grammatical use of language that most effectively presents ideas to the reader.&quot; (Bryan Garner)
* &quot;Clear, straightforward expression, using only as many words as are necessary. It is language that avoids obscurity, inflated vocabulary and convoluted construction. It is not baby talk, nor is it a simplified version of ... language.&quot; (Dr Robert Eagleson)
* &quot;A literary style that is easy-to-read because it matches the reading skill of the audience.&quot; (William DuBay)
* &quot;Language that is &quot;clear, concise&quot; and &quot;correct.&quot;&quot; (Richard Wydick)
* &quot;Language that allows readers to make an informed decision about the content because it considers their literacy levels, cognitive abilities, contexts, wants, needs, attitudes and challenges.&quot; (Candice Burt)

Plain language focuses on ways of writing a text so that it is clear, concise, pertinent, efficient, and flows well for the reader. The Center for Plain Language states that: &quot;[a] document, web site or other information is in plain language if the target audience can read it, understand what they read, and confidently act on it&quot;. Writing in plain language does not mean oversimplifying the concepts, but presenting the information in a way that makes it easier to understand and use by a wider audience. Texts written in plain language are still formal, but are easier to read and inspire confidence for the reader.

Using plain language in communications ultimately improves efficiency, because there is less ambiguity for the readers, and less time is taken for clarifications and explanations. Clear communication improves the user&#x27;s experience with the organization, ultimately creating trust in the company.

==Guidelines and tips==

Writers who wish to write in plain language must first and foremost consider their target audience. This should influence what information is included in the text and how it is written. Different audiences have different needs, and require different information. When writing, it is important to consider what the target audience needs to accomplish, and what and how much information they need to complete it. The needs of the target audience will also affect the chosen vocabulary: writing for someone in the same field as the author is different from writing for someone whose native language is not English.

Provide informative headings, topic sentences, and frequent summaries to help orient the reader. For complex documents, create a comprehensive table of contents.

Organize the text logically: the most important information should be mentioned first, in the text as a whole and in every individual paragraph. Headings help the reader skim the text more rapidly to find what they&#x27;re looking for. Sentences should be kept short, and only include necessary information. A long, verbose sentence tends to present too much information at once, and blurs its main point. The text should be direct and concise, and have an easy flow to it.

The chosen vocabulary must remain simple and familiar. Everyday language should be favoured against acronyms, jargon and legal language. Plain language favours the use of the verb form of the word, instead of the noun form. To increase clarity, use the active voice, in which the subject does the action of the verb. Sentences written in plain language have a positive construction and address the reader directly.

Writing in plain language also takes into account the presentation of the text. It is important to choose a font that is easy to read, and set it to an adequate size. Sentences written in capital letters are harder to read because the letters are less distinguishable from one another. Simple design elements like leaving white spaces, using bullets, and choosing contrasting colours encourages a user to read the text and increases readability.

== Purposes ==

=== Reading comprehension ===
Proponents of plain language adoption argue that it improves reading comprehension and readability, and grants readers greater access to information. Simple language allows documents to be read and understood by a larger audience, as plain language adoption often involves rewriting very technical and field-specific documents, like legal and medical documents.

=== Accessibility ===
Some scholars promote plain language use as a means of making documents accessible, especially for disabled readers or those who lack the expertise and education to understand overly technical documents. Simpler language can decrease a reader&#x27;s cognitive load, and improve information retention in readers who normally struggle to read complex documents. Changes in font, text size, and colour can make texts more readable for individuals with impaired vision. Some scholars view plain language from a social justice perspective as a means of increasing equal access to information, especially for marginalized populations that might have decreased access to education.

=== Ethical action ===
While plain language has positive practical outcomes across many situations, it can also be understood within the framework of ethical action. While not all plain language practitioners and scholars agree that &quot;Plain language is a civil right&quot;, as the motto for the US-based Center for Plain Language declares, many practitioners agree that using plain language is part of ethical action, such as being responsive, respectful, honest, truthful and fair. On the other hand, plain language can also be used for unethical ends, such as to obscure or withhold truths. Willerton proposes the BUROC framework for identifying situations requiring the ethical action of plain language: bureaucratic, unfamiliar, rights-oriented, critical.

==Examples==

==History==

===Early history===
Cicero argued, &quot;When you wish to instruct, be brief; that men&#x27;s minds take in quickly what you say, learn its lesson, and retain it faithfully. Every word that is unnecessary only pours over the side of a brimming mind.&quot;

Shakespeare parodied the pretentious style, as in the speeches of Dogberry in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. 
The plain, or native style, was, in fact, an entire literary tradition during the English Renaissance, from John Skelton through Ben Jonson and include such poets as Barnabe Googe, George Gascoigne, Walter Raleigh, and perhaps the later work of Fulke Greville. In addition to its purely linguistic plainness, the Plain Style employed an emphatic, pre-Petrarchan prosody (each syllable either clearly stressed or clearly unstressed).

===19th century===
By the end of the 19th century, scholars began to study the features of plain language. A. L. Sherman, a professor of English literature at the University of Nebraska, wrote &quot;Analytics of Literature: A Manual for the Objective Study of English Prose and Poetry&quot; in 1893. In this work, Sherman showed that the typical English sentence has shortened over time and that spoken English is a pattern for written English.

Sherman wrote: 
Literary English, in short, will follow the forms of the standard spoken English from which it comes. No man should talk worse than he writes, no man writes better than he should talk... The oral sentence is clearest because it is the product of millions of daily efforts to be clear and strong. It represents the work of the race for thousands of years in perfecting an effective instrument of communication.
===1900 to 1950===
Two 1921 works, Harry Kitson&#x27;s &quot;The Mind of the Buyer&quot;, and Edward L. Thorndike&#x27;s &quot;The Teacher&#x27;s Word Book&quot; picked up where Sherman left off. Kitson&#x27;s work was the first to apply empirical psychology to advertising. He advised the use of short words and sentences. Thorndike&#x27;s work contained the frequency ratings of 10,000 words. He recommended using the ratings in his book to grade books not only for students in schools but also for average readers and adults learning English. Thorndike wrote:
It is commonly assumed that children and adults prefer trashy stories in large measure because they are more exciting and more stimulating in respect to sex. There is, however, reason to believe that greater ease of reading in respect to vocabulary, construction, and facts, is a very important cause of preference. A count of the vocabulary of &quot;best sellers&quot; and a summary of it in terms of our list would thus be very instructive.
The 1930s saw many studies on how to make texts more readable. In 1931, Douglas Tyler and Ralph Waples published the results of their two-year study, &quot;What People Want to Read About&quot;. In 1934, Ralph Ojemann, Edgar Dale, and Ralph Waples published two studies on writing for adults with limited reading ability. In 1935, educational psychologist William S. Gray teamed up with Bernice Leary to publish their study, &quot;What Makes a Book Readable&quot;.

George Orwell&#x27;s 1946 essay &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot; decried the pretentious diction, meaninglessness, vagueness, and worn-out idioms of political jargon. In 1979, the Plain English Campaign was founded in London to combat &quot;gobbledegook, jargon and legalese&quot;.

===1951 to 2000===
Lyman Bryson at Teachers College in Columbia University led efforts to supply average readers with more books of substance dealing with science and current events. Bryson&#x27;s students include Irving Lorge and Rudolf Flesch, who became leaders in the plain-language movement. In 1975, Flesch collaborated with J. Peter Kincaid to create the Flesch-Kincaid readability test, which uses an algorithm to produce grade level scores that predict the level of education required to read the selected text. The instrument looks at word length (number of letters) and sentence length (number of words) and produces a score that is tied to a U.S. grade school level. For example, a score of 8.0 means that an eighth grader can read the document.

Others who later led plain language and readability research include educator Edgar Dale of Ohio State, Jeanne S. Chall of the Reading Laboratory of Harvard, and George R. Klare of Ohio University. Their efforts spurred the publication of over 200 readability formulas and 1,000 published studies on readability.

Beginning in 1935, a series of literacy surveys showed that the average reader in the U.S. was an adult of limited reading ability. Today, the average adult in the U.S. reads at the 9th-grade level.

Access to health information, educational and economic development opportunities, and government programs is often referred to in a social justice context. To ensure more community members can access this information, many adult educators, legal writers, and social program developers use plain language principles when they develop public documents. The goal of plain language translation is to increase accessibility for those with lower literacy levels.

In the United States, the movement towards plain language legal writing began with the 1963 book &quot;Language of the Law&quot;, by David Mellinkoff. However, the movement was popularized by Richard Wydick&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;Plain English for Lawyers.&quot; This was followed by famous plain language promissory notes by Nationwide Mutual Insurance and Citibank in the 1970s.

Concerned about the large number of suits against its customers to collect bad debts, the bank voluntarily made the decision to implement plain language policies in 1973. That same decade, the consumer-rights movement won legislation that required plain language in contracts, insurance policies, and government regulations. American law schools began requiring students to take legal writing classes that encouraged them to use plain English as much as possible and to avoid legal jargon, except when absolutely necessary. Public outrage with the skyrocketing number of unreadable government forms led to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

In 1972, the Plain Language Movement received practical political application, when President Richard Nixon decreed that the &quot;Federal Register be written in layman&#x27;s terms&quot;. On March 23, 1978, U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed Executive Order 12044, which said that federal officials must see that each regulation is &quot;written in plain English and understandable to those who must comply with it&quot;. President Ronald Reagan rescinded these orders in 1981, but many political agencies continued to follow them. By 1991, eight states had also passed legislation related to plain language. Plain Language Association International (PLAIN) was formed in 1993 as the Plain Language Network. Its membership is international; it was incorporated as a non-profit organization in Canada in 2008. 
In June 1998, President Bill Clinton issued a memorandum that called for executive departments and agencies to use plain language in all government documents. Vice President Al Gore subsequently led a plain language initiative that formed a group called the Plain Language Action Network (PLAIN) to provide plain language training to government agencies.

===21st century===
PLAIN provided guidance to federal executive agencies when President Barack Obama signed the Plain Writing Act of 2010, which required federal executive agencies to put all new and revised covered documents into plain language. The Act&#x27;s sponsor, U.S. Representative Bruce Braley, noted upon its passage that &quot;The writing of documents in the standard vernacular English language will bolster and increase the accountability of government within America and will continue to more effectively save time and money in this country.&quot;

Plain language is also gaining traction in U.S. courts and legal aid agencies. California was the first state to adopt plain language court forms and instructions, for which it received the 2003 Burton Award for Outstanding Reform. A 2006 comparative study of plain language court forms concluded that &quot;plain language court forms and instructions are better understood, easier to use, and more economical&quot;.

The European Union provides standards for making information easy to read and understand. The rules are comparable to the rules for plain language. Based in Germany there is a dictionary for plain language called Hurraki. In France, a 2002 decision by the Constitutional Council recognized a constitutional goal of ensuring the &quot;clarity and intelligibility&quot; of French law. In 2013 the Israeli Knesset passed service accessibility regulations which mandated the use of simple language and/or language simplification (Hebrew = פישוט לשוני), which were subsequently codified in 2015 for implementation.

ISO has formed a Working Group within Technical Committee ISO/TC 37 to develop plain language standards and guidelines. Their work began officially towards the end of 2019. It has published standard ISO 24495-1 in 2023.

<doc id="167947" wikidata="Q1858034" url="?curid=167947" title="Sloan (band)">
<text>Sloan is a Canadian rock band formed in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1991. Sloan has released thirteen full-length albums and has received nine Juno Award nominations, winning one. Between 1996 and 2016, Sloan was among the top 75 best-selling Canadian artists in Canada and among the top 25 best-selling Canadian bands in Canada. The band is known for their sharing of songwriting and lead vocals from each member of the group and their unaltered line-up throughout their career. Although formed in Halifax, the band is now based out of Toronto.

==History==
===Formation (1986–1991)===
Chris Murphy was introduced to Jay Ferguson through Matt Murphy in 1986. The three played together in a band called &quot;The Deluxe Boys&quot;. The band disbanded in 1987 and Ferguson and Murphy formed the band Kearney Lake Rd. with Henri Sangalang in October of that year. In 1989, Murphy met and befriended Andrew Scott. Kearney Lake Rd. broke up in early 1990. That same year, Murphy and Scott were attending the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (NSCAD) in Halifax and began jamming together. Ferguson started jamming with Murphy and Scott and they began searching for a bass player. Murphy knew of Patrick Pentland&#x27;s vocal and guitar abilities from Pentland&#x27;s previous bands and offered him a spot in the band. Pentland accepted, and Sloan was formed in late January 1991. The band&#x27;s name comes from their friend, Jason Larsen. Larsen had been nicknamed &quot;Slow One&quot; by his boss, though it sounded more like &quot;Sloan&quot; in the boss&#x27;s French accent. The original agreement was that they could name the band after Larsen as long as he was on the cover of their first album. As a result, it is Larsen who appears on the cover of the &quot;Peppermint EP&quot;.

===Geffen Records, &quot;Peppermint&quot; EP (1991–1992)===
On February 8, 1991, Sloan played their first concert at an art show at NSCAD University. Murphy and Pentland switched roles shortly after, with Pentland now playing guitar and Murphy playing bass. Through a battle of the bands-type gig, the band earned a spot on the DTK Records compilation &quot;Here and Now&quot; and a session with local producer Terry Pulliam at his Soundmarket Studios. The band took the opportunity to record an album&#x27;s worth of songs. One of the songs recorded was &quot;Underwhelmed&quot;, which was selected for the &quot;Hear and Now &#x27;92&quot; compilation. The band attracted interest from Canadian record labels Nettwerk and MCA Canada. After attracting interest from Todd Sullivan, an A&amp;R representative at Geffen Records, a copy of Sloan&#x27;s Pulliam sessions was sent to Sullivan. After seeing Sloan perform in Vancouver, Sullivan committed to Sloan and the band signed to Geffen in the summer of 1992. That same year, Sloan released their first recording, the EP &quot;Peppermint&quot;. It was released on the band&#x27;s own label, Murderecords.

===&quot;Smeared&quot;, &quot;Twice Removed&quot; (1992-1994)===
On October 1, 1992, Sloan released their debut full-length album, &quot;Smeared&quot;, on Geffen in Canada. &quot;Smeared&quot; was released in the United States in January, 1993. The lead single from the album was a re-recorded version of &quot;Underwhelmed&quot;, which was a hit in Canada and peaked at No. 25 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. In 1993, Sloan embarked on a 10-week North American tour, which included dates opening for The Lemonheads. The band then later began recording their second album. The recordings for the album were a departure from the shoegazer-grunge style on the band&#x27;s previous album, which did not please Geffen. When Sloan refused Geffen&#x27;s request to re-record the album, Geffen pulled promotional support for it. In 1994, the band released the second album, which was titled &quot;Twice Removed&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; named the album one of the &quot;Best Albums You Didn&#x27;t Hear&quot; in 1994.

===&quot;One Chord to Another&quot; to &quot;Pretty Together&quot; (1995–2001)===
In early 1995, rumours began circulating that band was contemplating breaking up. Though they played a handful of shows in the summer of 1995, including a headlining gig at Edgefest, the band did indeed consider themselves broken up by late 1995. Even so, Sloan decided to release another album to help their Murderecords label financially and boost its profile. Though Geffen wanted to keep Sloan on the label, the band wanted to leave and Sloan was released from the label. In 1996, Sloan released &quot;One Chord to Another&quot; on Murderecords in Canada. The album featured three hit singles and would go on to sell over 80,000 copies, becoming their best-selling album in Canada to date. In 1997, the band won their first Juno Award, winning the &quot;Best Alternative Album&quot; award for &quot;One Chord to Another&quot;. In 1998, the band released &quot;Navy Blues&quot;, which was certified gold in Canada. In 1999, Sloan released their first live album, &quot;4 Nights at the Palais Royale&quot;. The live album was followed that same year by their next studio album, &quot;Between the Bridges&quot;. In 2001, Sloan signed a licensing agreement with BMG Music Canada. That same year, Sloan released their next album, &quot;Pretty Together&quot;.

===&quot;Action Pact&quot;, &quot;A Sides Win&quot; (2003–2005)===
Sloan made a concerted effort to break into the US market on their 2003 release &quot;Action Pact&quot;. Songs were recorded in Los Angeles with Tom Rothrock producing. The glossier, radio-ready sound failed to raise Sloan&#x27;s profile in the US, though they continued to be popular in Canada.

In 2005, Sloan released their first compilation album, &quot;A Sides Win: Singles 1992-2005&quot;. The album included two new songs, &quot;All Used Up&quot; and &quot;Try to Make It&quot;. The Japanese release included two additional new tracks.

===Yep Roc Records, &quot;Never Hear the End of It&quot;, &quot;Parallel Play&quot; (2006–2008)===
Now signed to Yep Roc Records for their US releases, Sloan released their eighth album, &quot;Never Hear the End of It&quot; in 2006. The album contained 30 tracks with all the members of the band contributing new songs. It was met with widespread critical acclaim and became the first Sloan album to chart in the United States. In 2008, Sloan followed up their longest album with their shortest ever release at the time, &quot;Parallel Play&quot;.

===&quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot; and &quot;B-Sides Win&quot; (2009–2010)===
In November 2009, Sloan added a digital music store to their website. To promote the store, the band released an online-only EP titled &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot;. The song &quot;Take It Upon Yourself&quot; was released as a free single. In February 2010, the band released another online exclusive, the compilation album &quot;B-Sides Win: Extras, Bonus Tracks and B-Sides 1992–2008.&quot;

===&quot;The Double Cross&quot;, &quot;Twice Removed&quot; reissue (2011–2013)===
Sloan announced plans to release a 10th album in 2011, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of their first show.

On February 22, 2011, Sloan announced that their new album would be released on May 10, 2011. The album was entitled &quot;The Double Cross&quot;, a nod to their 20th (or XX) anniversary. The album was preceded by its first single, &quot;Unkind&quot;.

In promotion of the new album, a special video series produced and directed by Catherine Stockhausen was launched on YouTube to celebrate the band&#x27;s success and renown. The videos featured interviews with musicians and celebrities such as Jason Schwartzman, Joel Plaskett, Stefan Brogren, Dave Foley, Kevin Drew, Buck 65, Sebastien Grainger, The Dears, Ian D&#x27;Sa and Benjamin Kowalewicz from Billy Talent, K-OS, and Dave Hamlin.

Following the completion of touring for &quot;The Double Cross&quot;, Sloan reissued and toured behind &quot;Twice Removed&quot; as a three-record vinyl box set containing the original album, rarities, and demos. They toured North America, where they played &quot;Twice Removed&quot; in its entirety, followed by additional sets of songs that don&#x27;t appear on the album.

On April 24, 2013, Sloan announced the release of a hardcore punk 7&quot; single, &quot;Jenny&quot; b/w &quot;It&#x27;s In You, It&#x27;s In Me&quot;. Pre-orders of the single also included a T-shirt portraying the band members circa 1985, and a bonus digital download of 12 additional hardcore covers performed by Sloan. Some of the bands covered included Minor Threat, The Descendents, Angry Samoans, 7 Seconds, Black Flag and The Nils. In 2021, Sloan compiled and released the two originals and all 12 punk covers together as part of the 12” vinyl album, &quot;This One’s an Original&quot;.

Between 2011 and 2013, Sloan also released three limited edition live &quot;bootleg&quot; LPs from their archives: &quot;Is That All I Get? (1993 September Twentieth – Recorded Live On Patrick&#x27;s Birthday)&quot; (2011), &quot;Australia 1999&quot; (2012), and &quot;Japan 2002&quot; (2013).

===&quot;Commonwealth&quot;, 20th anniversary of &quot;One Chord to Another&quot; (2013–2017)===
In 2013, the band revealed plans for a double album, with each of the four sides featuring a solo suite by a different band member. In May 2014, it was announced that the new album would be titled &quot;Commonwealth&quot; and would be released in September 2014. On July 14, 2014, the band announced the official release date for the album and the release of the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Keep Swinging (Downtown)&quot;. In 2016, Sloan released a deluxe vinyl box set of their 1996 album, &quot;One Chord To Another&quot;, which contained the original album, rarities, and demos. To mark that record&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Sloan also toured North America, where they played the &quot;OCTA&quot; album in its entirety. In November 2016, Sloan released a Christmas single on limited edition, red translucent 7&quot; vinyl, featuring two new songs, &quot;Kids Come Back Again at Christmas&quot; and &quot;December 25&quot;.

===&quot;12&quot; (2018–2020)===
On February 5, 2018, Sloan announced that their twelfth record would be called &quot;12&quot;. Advance track releases included &quot;The Day Will Be Mine&quot;, &quot;Spin Our Wheels&quot; (the album&#x27;s lead single), &quot;Right to Roam,&quot; and &quot;44 Teenagers.&quot; The album was released on April 6, 2018. The album&#x27;s debut marked Sloan&#x27;s highest ever position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart, reaching #11. The band then set off on a 30-date North American tour in support of the album.

In late 2019, Sloan released their third deluxe vinyl box set – this time for their 1998 album, &quot;Navy Blues&quot;. This release contained the original album, rarities, and demos. To celebrate the box set&#x27;s release, Sloan embarked on a tour of North America that extended into 2020, in which they performed the &quot;Navy Blues&quot; album in its entirety.

===&quot;Steady&quot; (2021–present)===
In July 2021, it was reported that Sloan was working on their thirteenth album and hoped to release it in the fall of 2022.

Sloan officially announced their new album, entitled &quot;Steady&quot;, on July 13, 2022. The band released the song &quot;Spend the Day&quot; on streaming platforms the same day. On August 17, the band released the album&#x27;s official lead single, &quot;Scratch the Surface&quot;, along with an accompanying music video. &quot;Steady&quot; was released on October 21, 2022. The band toured behind &quot;Steady&quot;, in Canada, from October 2022 to March 2023, and commenced a US leg of the tour in April 2023, and then select US dates from June 22–30, 2023.

==Songwriting, live performances==

All four members of Sloan write and sing their own songs; when they play live, they switch instruments accordingly. The band typically performs as follows: Murphy plays bass, Pentland plays lead guitar, Ferguson plays rhythm guitar, and Scott plays drums. Scott plays guitar while singing his songs, while Ferguson switches to bass and Murphy switches to drums. Prior to 2006&#x27;s &quot;Never Hear the End of It&quot;, Ferguson and Scott would also play electric piano on songs that called for it. Multi-instrumentalist Gregory Macdonald has handled all keyboard duties live and in the studio since 2006. Murphy and Pentland would be considered the two main vocalists as they sing lead on the majority of the band&#x27;s songs and contribute back-up/harmony vocals to all of them.

While Murphy has written more of the band&#x27;s songs than any of the other members, particularly on the band&#x27;s first two albums, Pentland is nonetheless responsible for having written a majority of Sloan&#x27;s most recognizable hits. Every member of the group has contributed at least one song per album, with the lone exception being 2003&#x27;s &quot;Action Pact&quot; on which Scott has no songs. According to &quot;Eye Weekly&quot;, that album&#x27;s producer, Tom Rothrock, essentially randomly selected tracks out of the band&#x27;s submissions in the interest of creating a more streamlined sound. Also, Scott&#x27;s songwriting output at that time may have been somewhat diminished because he had recently become a father.

==Honours and awards==
In 1996, a reader poll by Canadian music magazine &quot;Chart!&quot; ranked &quot;Twice Removed&quot; as the best Canadian album of all time, only two years after its release. The same poll in 2000 ranked the album third, behind Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Blue&quot; and Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Harvest&quot;. However, the 2005 poll once again ranked the album first. The band has also been nominated for several Juno Awards, winning one in 1997 for Best Alternative Album for &quot;One Chord to Another&quot;.
