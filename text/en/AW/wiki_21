<text>Audrey Faith McGraw (; born September 21, 1967), known professionally as Faith Hill, is an American country singer, songwriter, record producer and actress. She is one of the most successful country music artists of all time, having sold almost 50 million albums worldwide.

Hill&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Take Me as I Am&quot; (1993) and &quot;It Matters to Me&quot; (1995), were major successes that placed a combined three number ones on &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts, quickly establishing her as one of country music&#x27;s top acts. Next she achieved immense mainstream and crossover success with two albums, &quot;Faith&quot; (1998) and &quot;Breathe&quot; (1999). &quot;Faith&quot; produced her first international hit, &quot;This Kiss&quot;, while her album &quot;Breathe&quot; became one of the best-selling country albums of all time. The album was led by the huge crossover success of the songs &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;The Way You Love Me&quot;. &quot;Breathe&quot; saw massive sales worldwide and earned three Grammy Awards.

In 2001, Hill recorded &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be&quot; for the &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; soundtrack and it too became an international success. Nominated for an Academy Award, it remains her best-selling single in Europe. 

Hill&#x27;s next two albums, &quot;Cry&quot; (2002) and &quot;Fireflies&quot; (2005), continued her commercial successes; the former spawned another crossover single, &quot;Cry&quot;, which won Hill a Grammy, and the latter produced the singles &quot;Mississippi Girl&quot; and &quot;Like We Never Loved at All&quot;, which earned additional Grammy Awards.

Hill has won five Grammy Awards, 15 Academy of Country Music Awards, six American Music Awards, and several other awards. Her Soul2Soul II Tour 2006 with Tim McGraw became the highest-grossing country tour of all time. In 2001, she was named one of the &quot;30 Most Powerful Women in America&quot; by &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Billboard&quot; named her as the Adult Contemporary Artist of the Decade (2000s) and also as the 39th top artist overall. From 2007 to 2012, Hill was the voice of &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; intro song. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2019. Hill has been married to American singer Tim McGraw since 1996, with whom she has recorded several duets.

==Early life and career beginnings==
Audrey Faith Perry was born in Ridgeland, Mississippi, north of Jackson, Mississippi. She was adopted as an infant and named Audrey Faith Perry. She was raised in the nearby town of Star, 20 miles southeast of Jackson by her adoptive parents, Edna and Ted Perry, with their two biological sons in a devout Christians environment.

She began singing at Star Baptist Church at age 3. Hill&#x27;s vocal talent was apparent early, and she had her first public performance, at a 4-H luncheon, when she was seven. In 1976, a few days before her 9th birthday, she attended a concert by Elvis Presley at the State Fair Coliseum in Jackson, which deeply impressed her. During her teenage years, she became a member of the Steele Family gospel quartet and performed regularly with them at area churches of all denominations. At 17, Hill formed a band that played at local rodeos. She graduated from McLaurin Attendance Center in 1986, then briefly attended Hinds Junior College (now Hinds Community College) in Raymond, Mississippi. At times, she sang for prisoners at the Hinds County Jail, her song of choice being &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.

At age 19 Hill dropped out of college to move to Nashville and pursue her dream of being a country singer. In her early days in Nashville, she auditioned to be a backup singer for Reba McEntire, but failed to secure the job. A few years later in 1991, the singer who beat out Hill for the job was killed in a plane crash with 6 other members of Reba&#x27;s band.

After a stint selling T-shirts, Hill became a secretary at a music publishing firm. Hill also landed a job at a local McDonald&#x27;s restaurant franchise, which she intensely disliked. &quot;Fries, burgers, cash register–I did it all, I hated it,&quot; she has said.

In 1988, she married music publishing executive Daniel Hill (not to be confused with Canadian musician Dan Hill).

A co-worker heard Hill singing to herself one day, and soon the head of her music publishing company was encouraging her to become a demo singer for the firm. She supplemented this work by singing backup vocals for songwriter Gary Burr, who often performed his new songs at Nashville&#x27;s Bluebird Cafe. During one of those performances, Martha Sharp, an executive from Warner Bros. Records was in the audience, and, impressed with Hill&#x27;s voice, began the process of signing her to a recording contract.

In 1994, she and Daniel Hill divorced shortly after the release of her album.

==Music career==
===1993–1997: Country music success===
Faith Hill&#x27;s debut album was &quot;Take Me as I Am&quot; (1993); sales were strong, buoyed by the chart success of &quot;Wild One&quot;. Hill became the first female country singer in 30 years to hold &quot;Billboard&quot; number one position for four consecutive weeks when &quot;Wild One&quot; managed the feat in 1994. Her version of &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;, also went to the top of the country charts in 1994. The album sold a total of 3 million copies. Other singles from the album include &quot;Take Me as I Am&quot;.

The recording of Hill&#x27;s second album was delayed by surgery to repair a ruptured blood vessel on her vocal cords. &quot;It Matters to Me&quot; finally appeared in 1995 and was another success, with the title track becoming her third number-one country single. Several other top 10 singles followed, and more than 3 million copies of the album were sold. The fifth single from the album, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Do That Anymore&quot;, was written by Alan Jackson. Other singles from the album include &quot;You Can&#x27;t Lose Me&quot;, &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Vegas&quot;. During this period, Hill appeared on the acclaimed PBS music program &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;.

In spring 1996, Hill began the Spontaneous Combustion Tour with country singer Tim McGraw. At the time Hill had recently become engaged to her former producer, Scott Hendricks, and McGraw had recently broken an engagement. McGraw and Hill were quickly attracted to each other and began a relationship. After discovering that Hill was pregnant with their first child, the couple married on October 6, 1996. The couple have three daughters together: Gracie Katherine (born 1997), Maggie Elizabeth (born 1998) and Audrey Caroline (born 2001). Since their marriage, Hill and McGraw have endeavored to never be apart for more than three consecutive days.

After the release of &quot;It Matters to Me&quot;, Hill took a three-year break from recording to give herself a rest from four years of touring and to begin a family with McGraw. During her break, she joined forces with her husband for their first duet, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Love&quot;. The song stayed at number one for six weeks, and won awards from both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association. Hill has remarked that sometimes when they perform the song together, &quot;it [doesn&#x27;t] feel like anybody else was really watching.&quot;

===1998–2003: Pop music crossover and career breakthrough===
Faith Hill re-entered the music business in 1998 with her third album &quot;Faith&quot;. The album showcased her progression toward a more mainstream, pop-oriented sound, although it retained a distinct country sound. &quot;This Kiss&quot; became a number one country hit, and was the first of her singles to place on the pop charts, peaking at number seven. More than six million copies of the album were sold. The album also had several other hits including another duet with McGraw, &quot;Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me&quot;, &quot;Let Me Let Go&quot; and &quot;The Secret of Life&quot;.

Hill immediately released &quot;Breathe&quot; in November 1999 following this success; it debuted at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country and all genre charts, ahead of albums by Mariah Carey and Savage Garden. Although the album had few overt country sounds, it &quot;complement[ed] her vocal strengths&quot;. For the first time, the album consisted solely of songs about love and did not venture into the more somber territory that her previous albums had touched. The title track, &quot;Breathe&quot;, reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;The Way You Love Me&quot; hit the top 10 as well, topping out at number six on the charts. The album won Hill three Grammy Awards including Best Country Album, Best Country Collaboration With Vocals for &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot; featuring Tim McGraw and Best Country Female Vocal Performance for &quot;Breathe&quot;. It marked a step away from her girl-next-door image, as the videos and promotional pictures all portrayed a much sexier image. &quot;Breathe&quot; has sold almost 10 million copies worldwide.

2000 was a very busy year for Hill. In addition to a successful tour with her husband, Hill was featured in a CBS television special, VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, &quot;VH1 Divas 2000&quot;, and the Lifetime cable channel&#x27;s &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot; series. She signed an endorsement deal with CoverGirl makeup, performed at the Academy Awards and the Grammy Awards, appeared on the cover of numerous magazines, and performed the national anthem at Super Bowl XXXIV. Hill was also named to Mr. Blackwell&#x27;s 10-best dressed women of 2000, the only singer listed among actresses and other celebrities. Hill and McGraw also embarked on their first Soul2Soul tour, the &quot;Soul2Soul Tour 2000&quot;.

In 2000, Hill recorded a song for the movie &quot;Dr. Seuss&#x27; How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;, entitled &quot;Where Are You Christmas?&quot; (written by James Horner, Will Jennings and Mariah Carey). The song also appeared on the pop and country charts. Hill&#x27;s success on the pop charts disturbed some country music insiders, who questioned whether she was trying to dismiss her country roots and move into the pop genre. Despite the grumbling, Hill won the CMA Female Vocalist of the Year Award, and in her acceptance speech announced, &quot;I love this business, and I love this industry... and my heart is here.&quot;

In 2001, Hill recorded a song for the &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; soundtrack. The track, also titled &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be&quot;, which was originally offered to Celine Dion, has since become one of Hill&#x27;s most critically acclaimed songs. Because of the single&#x27;s international success, a compilation album &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be: The Best of Faith Hill&quot;, was released to international markets. The album featured dance mixes of &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;The Way You Love Me&quot; along with alternate versions of &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot; and &quot;Let Me Let Go&quot;. &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be&quot; was nominated for a 2002 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in a motion picture.

In 2002, Hill released her fifth studio album, &quot;Cry&quot;. The album &quot;spotlight[ed] her impressive set of pipes&quot;, and also marked the completion of her &quot;transformation into a pop diva&quot;, containing few nods to her country roots. Though the album debuted at number one on Billboard magazine&#x27;s pop and country album charts, the album&#x27;s singles received much less country radio airplay than her previous hits, instead aiming to international and adult contemporary markets. The album also won a Grammy Award and over 3.7 million copies have been sold worldwide.

An album track from the album &quot;Baby You Belong&quot;, was used as the theme song for the movie &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;. The music video featured clips from the movie as well as performance clips.

&quot;When the Lights Go Down&quot;, the official second single from the album was used to promote an NBC television special which detailed the making of &quot;Cry&quot; and also featured intimate performances of Hill&#x27;s hits.

===2005–2006: Return to country music===

In 2005, Hill returned with her new country album, &quot;Fireflies&quot;. The CD debuted on top of the Billboard Country and all genre album charts, placing her among only a handful of artists to have three consecutive albums debut at number one on both charts. The debut single, &quot;Mississippi Girl&quot;, became Hill&#x27;s highest-debuting single. The song was specifically written for her by John Rich (of Big and Rich) and Adam Shoenfield of MuzikMafia, and tells the abbreviated story of her life. Hill recorded two other songs by Rich, &quot;Sunshine and Summertime&quot; and &quot;Like We Never Loved at All&quot;, both of which became successful singles. The title track &quot;Fireflies&quot;, &quot;Stealing Kisses&quot; and &quot;If You Ask&quot; were written by artist Lori McKenna and also appear on McKenna&#x27;s albums. They appeared and performed the songs together on the Oprah Winfrey Show and an awards show. The album marked a return to Hill&#x27;s country roots and succeeded in reestablishing her place on country radio.

In 2006, after a six-year break from touring following the birth of her youngest daughter, Hill and husband Tim McGraw embarked on their Soul2Soul II Tour 2006. The tour became the highest grossing country music tour ever with a gross of $90 million. It was named &quot;Major Tour of the Year&quot; by the prestigious Pollstar, beating out such heavyweights as Madonna and the Rolling Stones.

===2007–2010: Love Will Always Win, The Hits, Joy to the World and NBC Sunday Night Football===
In 2007, Hill began work on her first domestic greatest hits package, titled &quot;The Hits&quot;, which was released on October 2. It contains two new tracks, &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Red Umbrella&quot;, as well as 13 additional tracks. The album also features hits covering her entire career from 1993 to 2005. Included with the 2-Disc Special-Edition of &quot;The Hits&quot; is a DVD of 11 of Hill&#x27;s music videos. The DVD substitutes the Tim McGraw duet &quot;Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me&quot; for their &quot;I Need You&quot; duet on the CD.

Hill is also featured on McGraw&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Let It Go&quot; where she sings two duets with him, &quot;I Need You&quot; and &quot;Shotgun Rider&quot;. Both of these songs were performed during the couple&#x27;s critically acclaimed Soul2Soul II Tour; this tour began in June 2006 and ran through to August 2007. The song &quot;I Need You&quot; was nominated for both the &quot;Best Country Collaboration with Vocals&quot; and &quot;Best Country Song&quot; awards at the 2008 Grammy Awards.

At the beginning of the 2007 NFL season, Hill replaced Pink as the signature voice of &quot;NFL on NBC&#x27;s Sunday Night Football&quot;, singing the weekly game&#x27;s introductory theme song; of which the show&#x27;s producer said:
Hill performed this opening theme until April 15, 2013.

In September 2008, Hill issued her first Christmas album, titled &quot;Joy to the World&quot;. The compilation received positive reviews, including &quot;about.com&quot;, which gave the album four and a half out of five stars, calling the album, &quot;a great collection of classic Christmas songs&quot;. She worked on the album for two years prior to its official release. The album included one original track, &quot;A Baby Changes Everything&quot;, which was released as the album&#x27;s only single in late 2008 and debuted at No. 24 on Billboard&#x27;s AC chart, quickly rising to the No. 1 position, becoming Hill&#x27;s fourth number one on that chart.

During the Super Bowl XLIII pregame show On February 1, 2009, Hill performed &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;. Other performers at the event were Jennifer Hudson and Journey, whilst Bruce Springsteen performed the Halftime show.

Celebrating the induction of ABBA into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Hill performed &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;, together with keyboardist Benny Andersson, at the event held in New York City on March 13, 2010. Hill also performed a rendition of &quot;The Long &amp; Winding Road&quot; as part of a tribute to Paul McCartney which was held at the White House on July 28, 2010. Audience members included President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.

After the performances, Hill contributed a song titled &quot;Give In to Me&quot; which appears on the &quot;Country Strong&quot; soundtrack which was released in October 2010. The film also stars Hill&#x27;s husband Tim McGraw. Further appearances followed, with Hill featuring in &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter: A Tribute To Loretta Lynn&quot;, where she performs &quot;Love Is The Foundation&quot;. Hill also contributed her vocals to the &quot;Ryan Tedder&quot; penned song &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; for the 2010 film &quot;Life As We Know It&quot;. The song was used in trailers to promote the film and appeared during the end credits of the film.

===2011–2015: Unreleased studio album and Las Vegas Residency===

Brendan O&#x27;Brien, known for producing projects for Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam, and Rage Against the Machine began working with Hill and producing her next album, originally set for release in 2011. Hill also worked with pop producer Brian Kennedy in January 2011 to complete the album.

Hill returned to the studio in March 2011 for another round of recording. &quot;I would like to have a record out,&quot; she told Billboard.com, &quot;but it hasn&#x27;t been the right thing yet. I don&#x27;t want it to be just another record. It&#x27;s a lot of work to support a record, so I just want it to be... really great. I want it to represent where I am as a woman. I don&#x27;t want it to be fake. I want it to be authentic and real.&quot; In mid-2011, Hill recorded a duet with George Strait on the song &quot;A Showman&#x27;s Life&quot; which is on Strait&#x27;s album &quot;Here for a Good Time&quot;.

During the CMA Awards held on November 9, 2011, Hill performed the potential first single for her upcoming album titled &quot;Come Home&quot;. This song is a re-working of the OneRepublic song heard on their &quot;Dreaming out Loud&quot; album.

In June 2012, Hill debuted the songs &quot;Illusion&quot; and &quot;Overrated&quot; during her set at the CMA Music Festival. Following the performance, Hill confirmed that the album was done, but made no comment about when it would be released or whether the rumored title of &quot;Illusion&quot; was official.

While a second single, titled &quot;American Heart&quot;, along with its accompanying music video, was released on October 1, 2012, no further singles have since been released while an album also remains unreleased.

Following a successful tour of Australia with their Soul2Soul tour throughout March and April 2012, Hill and McGraw began an exclusive twenty show run of the Soul2Soul show at the Venetian in Las Vegas starting December 2012. A second leg of the show ran from October 2013, through to April 2014. The show was met with critical acclaim.

During the Billboard Music Awards filmed on May 17, 2015, Hill joined Little Big Town on a performance of their single &quot;Girl Crush&quot;.

===2016–present: New music and touring===
Hill was one of 30 artists selected to perform on &quot;Forever Country&quot;, a mash-up track of the songs &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, &quot;On the Road Again&quot; and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;. The single was released September 16 and celebrates 50 years of the CMA Awards.

On October 4, 2016, during a surprise show at Nashville&#x27;s famous Ryman Auditorium, both Faith and her husband announced that they would once again be going back on the road together with the Soul2Soul The World Tour 2017. The tour began April 7, 2017, in New Orleans, and continued into Europe throughout 2018, including as part of the C2C: Country to Country festival.

Hill sent out a tweet via her official Twitter account announcing the release of a new compilation album after the announcement of the tour. The album, titled &quot;Deep Tracks&quot;, is a montage of Hill&#x27;s favorite songs that were previously included on her various albums but were not released as singles. The album also includes three previously unreleased songs entitled, &quot;Boy&quot;, &quot;Why&quot; and &quot;Come to Jesus&quot;. The album, which is Hill&#x27;s last record to be released via Warner Bros. Records, was released November 18, 2016.

It was reported on February 3, 2017, that Hill, alongside McGraw, had signed a new deal with Sony Music Nashville, also indicating that a duet album between the couple, as well as multiple solo recordings would be produced. The new record label signing also preceded the release of &quot;Speak to a Girl&quot;, the lead single from Hill and McGraw&#x27;s joint album, &quot;The Rest of Our Life&quot;, which was released on November 17, 2017. The release of the album coincided with the opening of an exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum titled &quot;Mississippi Woman, Louisiana Man&quot;, which celebrates the careers of both Hill and McGraw.

== Artistry ==
Hill has a mezzo-soprano vocal range, which Joanna Horowitz of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; described as unmistakably &quot;throaty&quot;. 

Although Hill typically does not write most of the music she performs, Horowitz noted that her music &quot;emphasize[s] personal, intimate storytelling&quot;. She co-wrote two tracks on her debut album &quot;Take Me as I Am&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve Got This Friend&quot; and &quot;Go the Distance&quot;.

==Other ventures==
===Film and television career===
In 1997, Hill guest starred in a three episode arc of popular television series &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; and its subsequent spin off series, &quot;Promised Land&quot;. This marked her acting debut.

In 2002 it was rumored that Hill had won the role of Julia Compton Moore, the wife of Hal Moore, played by Mel Gibson, in the 2002 movie &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;. The role was ultimately played by Madeleine Stowe.

Hill made her film debut in the summer of 2004, when she co-starred with Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick and Glenn Close in director Frank Oz&#x27;s remake of the 1975 thriller &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;. Although the film received mixed reviews, it went on to earn over $100 million.

In 2015, Hill appeared in the independent crime drama film &quot;Dixieland&quot;. The film was written and directed by Hank Bedford and also stars Chris Zylka, Riley Keough, Spencer Lofranco, and Steve Earle. Dixieland had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 19, 2015. The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on December 11, 2015, by IFC Films.

On October 14, 2015, it was announced that Hill would be an executive producer for a new lifestyle television program with former &quot;Oprah&quot; executive producer Lisa Erspamer. The show, called &quot;Pickler &amp; Ben&quot;, debuted in mid-2017, features Kellie Pickler and Ben Aaron as hosts and is filmed in Nashville.

In August 2021, it was announced that Hill would co-star in Paramount+&#x27;s &quot;Yellowstone&quot; prequel &quot;1883&quot;. Hill also appeared in one episode of &quot;Yellowstone&quot; season four in a flashback scene.

===Fragrance===
In October 2009, Hill released her first fragrance titled &quot;Faith Hill Parfums&quot;. The fragrance is a blend of Southern Magnolia, Jasmine and Peach Pears. In 2010, Hill released her second fragrance, titled &quot;True&quot;.

===Philanthropy===
Hill used her 1999 tour to support a national children&#x27;s book drive, The Faith Hill Family Literacy Project. The charity was inspired by Faith&#x27;s father, who faced challenges with literacy. Fans who donated books at one of her concerts were entered into a drawing to meet her personally after the show. The effort resulted in the donation of 35,000 children&#x27;s books, which were distributed to hospitals, schools, libraries, and daycare centers in 40 cities across the United States.

In the days immediately following Hurricane Katrina, Hill and her husband, Tim McGraw, who was raised in Louisiana, joined groups taking supplies to Gulfport, Mississippi. The two also hosted several charity concerts to benefit those who were displaced by the storm. Later in the year the couple established the Neighbor&#x27;s Keeper Foundation, which provides funding for community charities to assist with basic humanitarian services in the event of a natural disaster or for desperate personal circumstances. In a special gesture, the couple also donated profits from their performance in New Orleans to Hurricane Katrina relief.

In June 2010, Hill and McGraw organized Nashville Rising, a benefit concert aimed to raise $2 million for The Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee in response to the flood in early May that killed 22 people and caused $2 billion in damage.

<text>Bad Religion is an American punk rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1980. The band&#x27;s lyrics cover topics related to religion, politics, society, the media and science. Musically, they are noted for their melodic sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies. The band has experienced multiple lineup changes, with singer Greg Graffin being the band&#x27;s only constant member, though fellow founding members Jay Bentley and Brett Gurewitz have also been with the band for most of their history while guitarist Brian Baker has been a member of the group since 1994. Guitarist Mike Dimkich and drummer Jamie Miller have been members of the band since 2013 and 2015 respectively. To date, Bad Religion has released seventeen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs. They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over five million albums worldwide.

After gaining a large underground following and critical praise through their releases on Gurewitz&#x27;s label Epitaph in the 1980s and early 1990s, Bad Religion experienced mainstream success after signing to the major label Atlantic in 1993. The band pioneered the punk rock revival movement of the 1990s, establishing a formula for California-based punk bands such as Green Day and Epitaph-signed acts the Offspring, NOFX and Rancid. They are also cited as an inspiration or influence on the 1990s and 2000s pop punk, skate punk, post-hardcore, screamo and emo scenes.

Atlantic reissued the previously-released-on-Epitaph album, &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; (1993), which became commercially successful, as did its 1994 follow-up &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;. &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; included some of Bad Religion&#x27;s well-known hits, including &quot;Infected&quot;, &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;, and the re-recorded version of &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot; (the latter of which its original version appeared four years earlier on &quot;Against the Grain&quot;); the album was later certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Shortly before the release of &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;, Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis, and was replaced by Brian Baker. The band&#x27;s success had slowly dwindled by the late 1990s, and, after three more albums, they were dropped from Atlantic in 2001; this resulted in Bad Religion returning to Epitaph and Gurewitz rejoining the band. Since then, they have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with &quot;Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Is Burning&quot;, and &quot;The Devil in Stitches&quot; becoming Top 40 hits on the US charts while their sixteenth studio album, &quot;True North&quot; (2013), became Bad Religion&#x27;s first album to crack the top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart where it peaked at number 19. The band&#x27;s seventeenth studio album, &quot;Age of Unreason&quot;, was released on May 3, 2019.

==History==
===Formation and early recordings (1980–1983)===

Bad Religion was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1980 by high school students Greg Graffin, Jay Bentley, Jay Ziskrout, and Brett Gurewitz. Their first public performance was playing six or eight songs at a Fullerton, California, or Santa Ana, California, warehouse opening for Social Distortion. Their first official show was on November 11, 1980, at Joey Kills Bar in Burbank, California. Graffin has said that the name &quot;Bad Religion&quot; came about when the then-adolescent members of the band wanted to &quot;piss people off.&quot;

In 1981, the band released their initial eponymous six-song EP as a 7&quot; record on the newly formed label, Epitaph Records, which was and continues to be managed and owned by Gurewitz. Also in 1981, the band began recording their first full-length album, &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; During the recording of this album, drummer Jay Ziskrout quit the band, and was replaced by Pete Finestone. Released in 1982, &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; was also distributed by the band under the Epitaph label, and sold roughly 12,000 copies.

===&quot;Into the Unknown&quot;, &quot;Back to the Known&quot; and hiatus (1983–1985)===
In 1983, the band released &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;, a keyboard-driven progressive hard rock album with a slightly slower pace. Almost all of the albums the band produced were sold out of the warehouse they were housed in without the band&#x27;s knowledge, after which this album went out of print. This incident, as well as band members&#x27; increasingly divergent personal lives, led to the band&#x27;s temporary dissolution shortly after the album&#x27;s release.

Soon after, Graffin reassembled Bad Religion with Circle Jerks guitarist Greg Hetson replacing Gurewitz, who had gone into rehab for his drug problem. Bad Religion returned to a somewhat mellower, rock and roll version of their original sound with the &quot;Back to the Known&quot; EP. Eventually the band split toward the middle of 1985.

===Reunion, &quot;Suffer&quot;, &quot;No Control&quot;, &quot;Against the Grain&quot; and &quot;Generator&quot; (1986–1992)===
Bad Religion slowly reformed in 1986 out of the &quot;Back to the Known&quot; line-up when Graffin called Bentley and asked him to return. Bentley&#x27;s response was tentative, but after being assured that the setlist consisted mostly of tracks from &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot;, he agreed to return for one show, and ended up staying on because he had so much fun. A freshly rehabilitated Gurewitz was eventually convinced to come back aboard, and with Pete Finestone returning on drums and Greg Hetson on second guitar; Bad Religion was back. This lineup recorded the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Suffer&quot;, which was released in 1988. The album received positive reviews in the independent music press and was voted Best Album of the Year by publications such as &quot;Trust&quot;, &quot;Maximum Rocknroll&quot; and &quot;Flipside&quot;.

During the &quot;Suffer&quot; tour in 1988, Bad Religion began writing new material. In early 1989, while the band was on break from touring, they commenced work on their next album, and entered the Westbeach Recorders studio in June of that year to record it. The resulting album, &quot;No Control&quot;, was released in November 1989, and was Bad Religion&#x27;s best-selling album at the time, eventually selling more than 80,000 copies.

Bad Religion&#x27;s hardcore punk style continued with their next album, &quot;Against the Grain&quot;, which was released in 1990. While the album still did not break the band into mainstream audiences, it was the first 100,000 seller, and showed how quickly they were growing. &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot;, one of the tracks off the album, is generally regarded as the band&#x27;s most well-known song, and has been played at almost every live show.

Drummer Pete Finestone left Bad Religion again in April 1991 to focus on his other band, the Fishermen, which had signed with a major label, and Bobby Schayer joined the band as his replacement. In May 1991, Bad Religion entered the Westbeach Recorders studio to begin recording material for their sixth studio album, &quot;Generator&quot;, which was not released until March 1992. The album was recorded almost live in the studio, because, at the time, Gurewitz had moved Westbeach to larger premises, and for the first time, the entire band could play in the studio at the same time. He stated that it was &quot;time to change&quot; and the band &quot;did it in a different studio, but as far as the songwriting, it was a deliberate effort to try something different.&quot; To accompany the album, Bad Religion filmed their first music video &quot;Atomic Garden&quot;, which was also their first song to be released as a single.

To coincide with the band&#x27;s success, Bad Religion released a compilation album, &quot;80–85&quot;, in 1991. It is a repackaging of their debut album, &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot;, their two EPs, &quot;Bad Religion&quot; and &quot;Back to the Known&quot; and the band&#x27;s three track contributions to the &quot;Public Service&quot; EP. This compilation did not include &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;. &quot;80–85&quot; is now out of print and has been replaced by the 2004 re-issued version of &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; with the same track listings.

===Mainstream success and departure of Gurewitz (1993–1995)===

With alternative rock and grunge breaking into the mainstream, Bad Religion signed to Atlantic Records in 1993 and quickly re-released their seventh full-length studio album &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; on the label that same year. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the album finally broke Bad Religion into mainstream audiences and got their highest U.S. chart position to date, debuting at No. 14 on Billboard&#x27;s Heatseekers chart, with &quot;American Jesus&quot; and &quot;Struck a Nerve&quot; in particular becoming major rock radio hits at their time. During their &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; Tour, the band would support several opening acts, including then Lookout Records-signed punk band Green Day.

&quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; was followed up by Bad Religion&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;. The album met high critical reception upon its release in September 1994, and was their most successful album at the time, scoring such hits as &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;, &quot;Infected&quot;, and a re-recording of &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot;, which was originally released on &quot;Against the Grain&quot;. The band also recorded the song &quot;Leaders and Followers&quot; (which later appeared as a bonus track on the Japanese version of &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;) for the soundtrack for the Kevin Smith film, &quot;Clerks&quot;. The album was Bad Religion&#x27;s first to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; the release peaked at number 87, and was awarded gold certification on March 4, 1998, for sales of over half a million copies. With the success of that album, Bad Religion became a key member of the 1990s commercial punk rock explosion, alongside Green Day and fellow Epitaph bands such as the Offspring, Rancid, and NOFX.

Gurewitz left the band right before the release of &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;. He officially cited the reason for his departure as the increasing amount of time he was needed at Epitaph as the Offspring (who had just released &quot;Smash&quot; to unexpected success and acclaim) became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s. Gurewitz, along with many fans, accused the band of selling out for leaving Epitaph to seek greater financial success. As tensions increased, Graffin would sing alternate lyrics during concerts, such as, &quot;I want to know where Brett gets his crack&quot; or &quot;I want to know why Gurewitz cracked&quot;, on the song &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;. These barbs referred to Gurewitz&#x27;s struggles with crack, heroin, and other addictions which plagued him for years. Brett discussed his drug use in an interview on the band&#x27;s &quot;Suffer Tour&quot; documentary, &quot;Along the Way&quot;, and claimed that he was clean and sober. In response, Gurewitz recorded a song with his new band, the Daredevils, titled &quot;Hate You&quot;.

Gurewitz was replaced as guitarist by Brian Baker, a former member of the bands Minor Threat, Dag Nasty, and Junkyard; Baker declined a spot with R.E.M. to join Bad Religion. With Gurewitz gone, Graffin became Bad Religion&#x27;s primary songwriter (songwriting duties were originally split between the two).

===Post-Gurewitz period, departure of Bobby Schayer (1996–2000)===
Bad Religion continued touring and recording without Brett Gurewitz, releasing three more albums for Atlantic, starting with &quot;The Gray Race&quot; (1996), produced by former Cars frontman Ric Ocasek. Despite never garnering the amount of attention that &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; received, it scored Bad Religion a minor U.S. radio hit with the song, &quot;A Walk&quot;, as well as the European release of &quot;Punk Rock Song&quot;.
In 1998, Bad Religion released their tenth full-length album, &quot;No Substance&quot;, produced by Alex Perialas, Ronnie Kimball, and the band themselves. Although the album was anticipated by music critics and fans alike as a result of the band&#x27;s previous worldwide successes with &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; and &quot;The Gray Race&quot;, it was given mixed reviews by both critics and fans. Following the release of &quot;No Substance&quot;, the band embarked on a year-long tour.

In 1999, Gurewitz reunited with Graffin to co-write a song together called, &quot;Believe It&quot;, which would appear on their next album, &quot;The New America&quot; (2000). For this new album, Todd Rundgren, an early musical inspiration for Graffin, was brought in to produce. &quot;Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here&#x27;s a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn&#x27;t hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself.&quot; In the summer of 2000, they set out on a successful 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for Blink-182. Interest in recording the record waned due to Rundgren&#x27;s poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn&#x27;t like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol, and he was a jerk! I don&#x27;t think Todd gave a shit about anything.&quot; However, Graffin later writes in his book, &quot;Anarchy Evolution&quot;, that, although Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin remain friends to this day. Meanwhile, Bobby Schayer left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by Brooks Wackerman (Suicidal Tendencies).

===Return to Epitaph and reunion with Gurewitz (2001–2004)===
In 2001, Bad Religion departed from Atlantic Records. They returned to Epitaph, and Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band. The expanded six-piece line-up then recorded and released &quot;The Process of Belief&quot; (2002). Graffin stated, &quot;There was a little bit of disappointment on my part when he left the band, but we never had any serious acrimony between the two of us. I can&#x27;t say the same for the rest of the band. But he and I, being the songwriters from way back, we really wanted to try again.&quot;

Their next album, &quot;The Empire Strikes First&quot;, was released in June 2004. Like &quot;The Process of Belief&quot;, it was widely regarded by fans as a return to the faster punk-style songwriting that some felt was less prominent in the band&#x27;s music during their time on Atlantic.

In April 2004, the band also re-released digitally-remastered versions of all of their first six studio albums on Epitaph Records (except &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;). The &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; reissue, though reclaiming the original title of the band&#x27;s debut LP, contained all of the same material as the previously issued &quot;80–85&quot; compilation, including their first EP, the &quot;Public Service&quot; EP (with different versions of the songs Bad Religion, Slaves, and Drastic Actions than the self-titled EP) and the &quot;Back to the Known&quot; EP. To coincide with the reissues, they also released their long out-of-print live VHS, &quot;Along the Way&quot;, on DVD for the first time. &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot;, though, could not be re-issued, even though it was originally released on Epitaph, due to the fact that it had already been re-issued through Atlantic, and so problems with rights ownership made a reissue unlikely.

===&quot;New Maps of Hell&quot; (2005–2008)===

On March 7, 2006, a live DVD, &quot;Live at the Palladium&quot;, was released. This DVD featured a live show performed in late 2004 at the Hollywood Palladium as well as extensive interviews, several music videos, and a photo gallery. During one of the interview segments, guitarist Brett Gurewitz said the band&#x27;s next album would be a double-length release, but this turned out to not be the case.

Greg Graffin released his second solo album, &quot;Cold as the Clay&quot;, on July 11, 2006.

Bad Religion&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot;, was released on July 10, 2007. On June 29 of that year (Greg Hetson&#x27;s 46th birthday), Epitaph Records started selling &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot; at the Warped Tour in Pomona, California. The album was a commercial success and spawned three hit singles: &quot;Honest Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Heroes and Martyrs&quot;, and &quot;New Dark Ages&quot;. As a result, &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot; reached number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, marking Bad Religion&#x27;s highest-ever chart position. The band joined the 2007 Warped Tour to support the album.

Hetson formed a supergroup band called Black President, consisting of Charlie Paulson (from Goldfinger), Jason Christopher, Wade Youman (both from Unwritten Law), and Christian Martucci (from Dee Dee Ramone).

In early March 2008, Bad Religion played several night residences at House of Blues venues in Southern California as well as Las Vegas. They performed four European festival appearances in May and June.

On July 8, 2008, Bad Religion released their first-ever deluxe edition CD, a reissue of the then-current album, &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot;. The deluxe version included the original 16-song CD along with seven new acoustic tracks recorded by Graffin (vocals/guitars) and Gurewitz (guitars/back vocals). Three of the acoustic songs were new, written specifically for this release, while the other four tracks were acoustic versions of existing Bad Religion songs. The release also included a DVD with an hour-long live performance, music videos, and behind-the-scenes footage.

===&quot;30 Years Live&quot; and &quot;The Dissent of Man&quot; (2009–2010)===
In June 2008, Jay Bentley said in an interview at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands, that Gurewitz had already begun writing new material for the next Bad Religion album. He stated that the band was planning to return to the studio to start work on the follow-up to &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot;, planned for a June 2009 release, after Graffin teaches UCLA. However, according to a December 2008 report on the fan site, &quot;The Bad Religion Page&quot;, Bentley revealed that due to Bad Religion&#x27;s upcoming touring commitments for 2009, the band would not have a chance to record their new album until around the end of the year, for an expected 2010 release date.

In August 2009, guitarist Brett Gurewitz sent an email to a fan site mentioning he was writing new material for the next Bad Religion album.

In December 2009, Bentley revealed to the fan site that the band was expected to go into the studio on April 26, 2010, to start recording their new album. He stated that a few songs for the album had been written and, &quot;It feels like the songwriting is picking up momentum. Baker said he was going to drive up to Graffin&#x27;s, and Brooks and I are going to do some demos with Brett, so we have a pretty good jump.&quot; According to Brett&#x27;s Twitter, Bad Religion is aiming for a fall release of the new album. In January 2010, Bentley revealed that Bad Religion would record their new album at a studio in Pasadena, California, with Joe Barresi, who engineered 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Empire Strikes First&quot; and produced its 2007 follow-up, &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot;. Despite the statement made by Bentley about entering the studio in April, he noted that the recording date was now May 1.

In March and April 2010, to commemorate their 30th anniversary, Bad Religion toured Southern California&#x27;s and Nevada&#x27;s House of Blues locations, playing 30 Shows in 30 Nights with a 30-song set each night. At the House of Blues concert in Anaheim, California, on March 17, 2010, the band debuted a new song called &quot;Resist-Stance&quot; from their upcoming album. To coincide with the tour, Bad Religion announced a live album, entitled &quot;30 Years Live&quot;, which was released as a free download for those who had signed up to the mailing list at Bad Religion&#x27;s website. It consists of songs recorded during their House of Blues tour. It also included some new songs from their 15th studio album, before the new album was released. &quot;30 Years Live&quot; was mixed by Mike Fraser and was released on May 18, 2010.

On May 1, 2010, Brett posted an update on his Twitter saying, &quot;Threw me a going away [to the studio] party and all my friends hung with me tonight – thx everybody, I love you guys.&quot; This adds fuel to the possibility of the band&#x27;s new album being recorded the first week of May. On May 12, 2010 (which happened to be Brett&#x27;s 48th birthday), bassist Jay Bentley posted an update on their Facebook page regarding the recording process of the album: &quot;First week of recording at Joe&#x27;s house of compression and Brooks gets the medal for superasskicking. Brian has finished 14 basics ... a couple more to go. I started getting some good bass sounds late, late last night, the liver wins the shootout again. Brett is playing late night tracks on his birthday, some way to celebrate! happy birthday bg! quote of the day; BG &quot;what percentage of the sound is coming from the snakeskin?&quot;. haha ... working of album titles and ideas today. It&#x27;s all coming together. Joe says the corn flavored kit kats are gross, but the wasabi ones are quite delicious ... get back to work. Work work work. Will send photo&#x27;s soon.&quot;

In June 2010, the fan site reported that the new album would be released on September 28, 2010. Jay (who goes by jabberwock on the Bad Religion Page) mentioned on the site&#x27;s message board that Bad Religion had finished recording their new album and was mixing it. In an interview at the Azkena Rock Festival on June 26, 2010, the band members announced that the new album would be called &quot;The Dissent of Man&quot;. &quot;The Dissent of Man&quot; was released on September 28, 2010. The album debuted at No. 35 on the Billboard 200 chart and at No. 6 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. On August 30, 2010, the album version of the song, &quot;The Resist Stance&quot;, was released on Bad Religion&#x27;s MySpace page. The song was also made available for streaming on the page a week before the album&#x27;s release. The band had been touring throughout 2011 to support the album.

On October 18, 2010, Bad Religion released a vinyl box set of all their albums that is limited to 3000 copies, including their 1983 album, &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;, which had been out of print for over 25 years.

===&quot;True North&quot; (2011–2013)===

In an April 2011 interview with &quot;The Washington Examiner&quot;, guitarist Brian Baker was asked if Bad Religion was going to make another album after &quot;The Dissent of Man&quot;. His response was, &quot;It&#x27;s all very punk [attitude] just like it&#x27;s always been. We will record when we have enough songs. For us, it just kind of happens.&quot; During the Boston show on April 29, 2011, frontman Greg Graffin said, &quot;After this year you probably won&#x27;t be seeing much more of us. We&#x27;re going to try one more album and then all join the navy, do honest work&quot;, hinting at a possible split or hiatus. Bassist Jay Bentley mentioned an early 2012 timeframe for going back into the studio in an interview at Live 105&#x27;s BFD festival, which took place the day after the Weenie Roast. In February 2012, it was reported that Brett had written two songs for the album.

On June 25, 2011, Bad Religion performed a live set for &quot;Guitar Center Sessions&quot; on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host, Nic Harcourt.

According to a May 2012 interview with Pennywise guitarist Fletcher Dragge, Brett is writing a &quot;fast&quot; Bad Religion album. He also said that Pennywise&#x27;s then-new album, &quot;All or Nothing&quot;, inspired Brett to write a sequel to the band&#x27;s 1989 album, &quot;No Control&quot;.

On June 4, 2012, Jay Bentley told the Bad Religion fan site, &quot;The Bad Religion Page&quot;, that they were expected to begin recording their new album in July and August. He also stated that Brett and Joe Barresi are going to produce it. On July 23, the band uploaded a picture to Bad Religion&#x27;s Facebook page of all the members (except Greg Hetson, who was taking the picture) in the studio with the caption, &quot;here we go again&quot;, indicating that work on their sixteenth studio album had begun. On August 22, Brett Gurewitz tweeted that they were mixing the album, and, a month later, he tweeted that the band was finishing it. Greg Graffin later stated that the album was supposed to be out by Christmas. &quot;Fuck You&quot; was the album&#x27;s lead single and released on iTunes on November 6, which happened to be Greg Graffin&#x27;s 48th birthday.

On November 5, 2012 (Bad Religion Day), it was announced that Bad Religion&#x27;s sixteenth studio album, &quot;True North&quot;, would be released on January 22, 2013. On that same day, they premiered the new single &quot;Fuck You&quot;. &quot;True North&quot; has received mostly positive reviews and managed to reach number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, marking Bad Religion&#x27;s first ever top-20 album and highest ever peak on that chart in their entire 34-year career.

===Departures of Hetson and Wackerman, and &quot;Christmas Songs&quot; (2013–2017)===

Bad Religion played a few shows as a four-piece (without Greg Hetson and Brett Gurewitz) in mid April - May 2013—starting with their appearance at &quot;That Damn Show&quot; in Mesa, AZ, on April 20, including some high profile shows such as Groezrock in Belgium—leading fans to speculate over Greg Hetson&#x27;s continued involvement in the band.

On May 7, 2013, Jay Bentley issued a statement to the fan site, which read, &quot;Greg Hetson is dealing with some personal issues, if he wishes to make a statement we will support that, if he chooses not to we will support that. Mike Dimkich is indeed helping us out right now, and we are genuinely appreciative. Right now we are just looking forward and getting ready to play our shows.&quot; The reason Hetson had not been touring with Bad Religion was likely due to the divorce of his second wife Alia. On January 11, 2014, Bentley confirmed on &quot;thebrpage.net&quot; that Dimkich is a permanent member of the band. A few days later, Download Festival&#x27;s official website uploaded a photograph of the new lineup (without Brett Gurewitz).

Later, in 2022, Hetson appeared on the podcast Fat Mike&#x27;s Fat Mic stating he was let go due to his admitted addiction to painkillers and the behavior he exhibited due to this addiction.

On September 10, 2013, it was announced that Bad Religion would be releasing their first Christmas album, titled &quot;Christmas Songs&quot;, on October 29, 2013. It was their first album to not feature Greg Hetson since 1983&#x27;s &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;.

In a November 2013 interview, guitarist Brett Gurewitz stated that Bad Religion would start writing their seventeenth studio album in 2014, and guitarist Brian Baker said that he hoped Bad Religion would start recording the album in the fall of 2015. However, in a September 2015 interview, frontman Greg Graffin stated that he had been working on his first solo album since 2006&#x27;s &quot;Cold as the Clay&quot;, and that the band would begin writing their new album after the release of his third solo album, &quot;Millport&quot;, so a new Bad Religion album would not be released until around late 2016. Baker said, however, that the new album would not be released until 2017. Asked in a March 2017 interview about the follow-up to &quot;True North&quot;, Graffin said, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the great challenges as artist is to maintain the tradition of his or her prior work. That&#x27;s hard to do. It normally takes (Bad Religion) two years to put out an album. Why has it taken us four years to release an album after &quot;True North&quot;? Well, &quot;True North&quot; was such a great album — and we owe it to our fans to take it seriously as a great album — that to do another one is going to take a lot more work.&quot; &quot;Millport&quot; was eventually released on March 10, 2017.

From July to September 2014, Bad Religion embarked on the Summer Nationals Tour with Pennywise; their former labelmates the Offspring, the Vandals, Stiff Little Fingers, and Naked Raygun supported them on selected dates.

On October 27, 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman officially left the band in order to pursue other projects, joining Avenged Sevenfold a week later. He was replaced by Jamie Miller (...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Souls at Zero and Snot).

===&quot;Age of Unreason&quot; and follow-up album (2018–present)===

On February 14, 2018, vocalist Greg Graffin posted on Twitter a picture of himself with guitarist Brett Gurewitz in the studio, tweeting, &quot;New songs in the pipeline,&quot; indicating that they were working on Bad Religion&#x27;s seventeenth studio album. Speculations about the album resurfaced in April of that year when Gurewitz and guitarist Brian Baker posted pictures from the studio on their respective Instagram accounts. On June 20, 2018, the band released the song, &quot;The Kids Are Alt-Right&quot;, their first single in five years.

Despite earlier reports that they had been in the studio since February, up to mid 2018, and the fact that they had already released a new song, Gurewitz told &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in July 2018 that, &quot;We&#x27;re writing for a new album, recording this fall or late summer. No release date announced yet, but we should have an album&#x27;s worth of &#x27;Fuck Trump&#x27; songs pretty soon. It&#x27;s exactly what we need.&quot; On February 26, 2019, Bad Religion announced &quot;Age of Unreason&quot; as the title of their seventeenth studio album, which was released on May 3, and the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Chaos from Within&quot;, was premiered.

On August 18, 2020, &quot;Do What You Want: The Story of Bad Religion&quot;, an autobiography covering the band&#x27;s 40-year career, was released by Hachette Books.

About four months after the release of &quot;Age of Unreason&quot;, guitarist Brian Baker was asked if Bad Religion was already working on a follow-up album. His response was: &quot;No, I&#x27;m not really thinking about a new album right now because this one is still developing and there is a lot of world yet to play. 2020 is going to be a busy year for us, it&#x27;s our 40th Anniversary year. We have a book coming out at the end of the year – it&#x27;ll be our first authorized, somewhat participatory, biography of Bad Religion. So there is a lot more to do with this record. The good thing about Bad Religion is that you don&#x27;t really have to have a new product out to go work. The catalogue we have is so extensive and we are so fortunate to have the fan base that we have. So we don&#x27;t really worry about a new album cycle, those thing just sort of come when they come. The next one might take four or five years, it might take two, I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s just about whether songs have come together in a way that is respectful of the Bad Religion standard. But in the meantime, we have Brazil to rock.&quot; When asked in August 2019 about the future of the band, Bentley stated, &quot;Everything I know about everything came from being in this band and came from some conversations driving in the van for hours on end. We&#x27;re just these guys who don&#x27;t want to stop asking why. We are what we are as Bad Religion. We&#x27;re the thinking man&#x27;s punk band, and that&#x27;s kept us out of the mainstream. We&#x27;re writing smart songs, and that makes us dumb.&quot; In an August 2020 interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Graffin said, &quot;We&#x27;ve been working on some music, just as we&#x27;re socially distant from each other; each of us has home recording studios. I always write music acoustically.&quot; In November 2022, Baker confirmed that Gurewitz was &quot;starting to dust off his writing boots&quot; and expressed hope that the band&#x27;s next album will be recorded in 2023.

On April 29, 2020, Bad Religion announced on their social media accounts that they had to cancel all of their tour dates for that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a co-headlining US tour with Alkaline Trio, therefore marking 2020 as the first year the band did not perform at least one show since their inception in 1980. They subsequently also rescheduled their South American and European tour dates with Suicidal Tendencies, Millencolin, and Pulley to 2022 (originally scheduled for May and June 2021), once again due to the COVID pandemic. They also rescheduled their North American tour with Alkaline Trio, which was slated to take place in the fall of 2021.

In October 2020, Bad Religion released a new song, &quot;What Are We Standing For&quot;, on streaming platforms, which was an outtake from the &quot;Age of Unreason&quot; sessions.

On January 20, 2021, Bad Religion released a previously unreleased song called &quot;Emancipation of the Mind&quot;, which was recorded during the &quot;Age of Unreason&quot; sessions. The release of the song coincided with the inauguration of Joe Biden, and it had more hopeful themes compared to other songs that they&#x27;ve written while also being a rejection of Trumpism.

As of February, 2025, Bad Religion is in the studio to record a follow up album to &quot;Age of Unreason&quot;.
==Style and influences==
Bad Religion has been described as melodic hardcore, punk rock, skate punk, and hardcore punk. The band&#x27;s major influences stemmed from late 1970s punk acts like the Ramones, the Germs, the Sex Pistols, and the Clash, along with early 1980s American hardcore bands such as Black Flag, Minor Threat, and the Circle Jerks. Unlike many other hardcore bands of the era, they also acknowledged proto-punk bands like the New York Dolls, MC5, and the Stooges. Even more unusual for a band of the scene that spawned them, they were also informed by such new wavers as Elvis Costello, the Jam, and Nick Lowe, as well as authors like Jack Kerouac. The Beatles were also a huge influence on Bad Religion. The band had said that the Beatles were about the only band everyone in Bad Religion really liked.

Reviewers have repeatedly cited an upbeat and positive tone to both the band&#x27;s melody and lyrics, even when dealing with dark topics.

Greg Graffin called his influences, &quot;Pop-sounding rock tunes that were not necessarily commercial.&quot; Brett Gurewitz acknowledges attempting to emulate Germs singer Darby Crash early on in Bad Religion&#x27;s lyrical style. &quot;He wrote some intelligent stuff and didn&#x27;t shy away from the vocabulary, which I thought was cool.&quot; In addition to their use of unusually sophisticated vocabulary for a punk band, Bad Religion is also known for their frequent use of vocal harmonies. They took their cues from the Adolescents in the way they used three-part harmonies. Bassist Jay Bentley said, &quot;Seeing the Adolescents live, it was so brilliant. So, in a way, the Adolescents influenced us into saying we can do it too, because look, they&#x27;re doing it.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Various bands have cited Bad Religion as an influence, including Rise Against, AFI, Parkway Drive, NOFX, I Am the Avalanche, and Miss Vincent. Funeral for a Friend vocalist Matt Davies-Kreye has also mentioned Bad Religion as an influence, particularly with their &quot;Against the Grain&quot; album.

==Beliefs==
===Politics===
Many of Bad Religion&#x27;s songs are about different social ills, although they try not to ascribe the causes of these ills to any single person or group. Greg Graffin believes that the current political situation in the United States can make it difficult to voice these concerns as he does not want to feed the polarization of viewpoints.

The band contributed a song to the &quot;Rock Against Bush&quot; series organized by Fat Mike&#x27;s Punkvoter, a political activist group and website whose supporters are primarily left-liberal members of the punk subculture.

Brett Gurewitz attributed his anger towards former U.S. president George W. Bush as the major inspiration for &quot;The Empire Strikes First&quot;. &quot;Our whole album is dedicated to getting Bush out of office. I&#x27;m not a presidential scholar, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a worse president in the history of the United States. He&#x27;s probably one of the worst leaders in the history of world leaders. I just hate the guy.&quot; In a similar fashion, the album &quot;Age of Unreason&quot; was inspired by the band&#x27;s disdain for Donald Trump.

Bad Religion performed at L7&#x27;s abortion-rights benefit Rock for Choice at the Hollywood Palladium on April 30, 1993, with acts such as Stone Temple Pilots, White Zombie, Bikini Kill, King Missile, and Free Kitten with Kim Gordon. Hetson often wore a Rock for Choice T-shirt when performing, as he did when the band performed &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot; on Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien in 1994. Bentley has also worn Rock for Choice T-shirts, such as when they performed the Phoenix Festival in the United Kingdom in 1993. The band&#x27;s song, &quot;Operation Rescue&quot;, on &quot;Against the Grain&quot; is a pro-choice song (named after anti-abortion organization Operation Rescue).

===Religion===
Despite the name of the band, or the band&#x27;s logo, the members do not consider themselves antitheist. Singer Greg Graffin states that, more often than not, the band prefers to use religion as a metaphor for anything that does not allow for an individual&#x27;s freedom to think or express themselves as they choose. In this way, their songs are more about anti-conformity than anti-religion. Contrary to popular belief, Graffin identifies himself as a naturalist rather than an atheist.

Despite this, he did co-author the book &quot;Is Belief in God Good, Bad or Irrelevant?&quot;, which is based on a series of lengthy debates about science and religion between Graffin and historian Preston Jones. In 2010, Graffin released &quot;Anarchy Evolution&quot;, in which he promotes his naturalist worldview.

The band&#x27;s bassist Jay Bentley has stated that he has spiritual beliefs. Brett Gurewitz is a &quot;provisional deist&quot;.

On March 24, 2012, Bad Religion headlined the Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., sharing the stage with Eddie Izzard, Richard Dawkins, Tim Minchin and James Randi.

==Logo==

Bad Religion&#x27;s logo, a black Latin cross with a red prohibition sign over it, has been referred to by fans as the &quot;Crossbuster&quot;. It was created by guitarist Brett Gurewitz, who drew it on a piece of paper and showed it to the rest of the band.

In the live documentary, &quot;Along the Way&quot;, Greg Hetson, Greg Graffin, and Jay Bentley were all asked the question, &quot;What&#x27;s the meaning of the Bad Religion symbol?&quot;

Hetson&#x27;s answer: &quot;The meaning of the symbol? It&#x27;s—to me it&#x27;s just against any established set of rules, and the church just seemed to be the easiest target. It has a ... you know, the Christian religion has this symbol, it has a bunch of beliefs. They say, &#x27;You either believe it or not, this is the way it is,&#x27; and that&#x27;s not the way the world works. So, it was just an easy target to use, to be anti-establishment.&quot;

Graffin&#x27;s answer: &quot;Yeah. When it first came out, we all liked it, you know? We were little kids, and we thought, &#x27;Yeah, this is a great idea. It&#x27;ll piss people off.&#x27; You know, when you&#x27;re fifteen years old, the first thing you think about is, &#x27;How can I piss people off?&#x27; you know? And it&#x27;s very good to ... it&#x27;s very easy to piss people off when you&#x27;re fifteen, especially it&#x27;s easy to piss off your parents and adults in general. But as you get a little older, or as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve looked back on the symbol of Bad Religion as still having some meaning, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so offensive to other people, because other people could benefit from the ideas, I think, that we&#x27;ve laid down. For instance, what we look at it today as is just a symbol ... the cross is sort of the international symbol [points to a no parking sign behind him] as this parking symbol, the no parking is ... everybody in the world can recognize it. The cross we look at as an international symbol for religion, and it&#x27;s not anti-Christian, it&#x27;s not anti-Buddhist, it&#x27;s not anti-Jewish, it&#x27;s not anti-anything. It&#x27;s simply is [&quot;sic&quot;] showing ... it&#x27;s our way of showing that we don&#x27;t like to subscribe to dogmatic ways of life and dogmatic views on life, and that religion, in general, is founded in dogma and in restriction of ideas, restriction of thought, and it&#x27;s these things that I feel are bad about religion. It&#x27;s also very bad about nationalistic views, it&#x27;s very bad ... It&#x27;s something that mankind, as a group, is not going to benefit from; it&#x27;s only something that mankind will ... it&#x27;s something mankind will ... I&#x27;m sorry, it&#x27;s something that will instill violence, and it will instill fighting, and it will instill non-cooperation of different groups of humans.&quot;

Bentley&#x27;s answer: &quot;Brett made that when we were fifteen years old. Brett came up with a piece of paper and said, &#x27;Look at this!&#x27; and, and we all laughed and said, &#x27;That&#x27;s really funny,&#x27; &#x27;cause the concept of taking that symbol and putting the &#x27;no&#x27; thing on top of it was just ... it seemed shocking enough and good enough, because it represented ... sometimes people took it that it represented that we were like Satan worshipers and that we were not liking God, but it was more against, in America, is [&quot;sic&quot;] there&#x27;s too much TV evangelism, of, you know, &#x27;Send me monies and God will love you&#x27;, and it&#x27;s like [scoffs]. So that was, at the time, that was very popular, when we were starting, so that was one of the, one of the things that we still hate the most, is having to pay to be saved in some, like, ridiculous ... you don&#x27;t need that. You don&#x27;t need anybody to tell you that you have to pay money. So, that was one of the reasons why we did that, and it&#x27;s just ... it&#x27;s one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe ... it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it&#x27;s an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning. It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know? And then, when the records came out it just came everywhere, and so then everyone said, &#x27;What does that mean? What does that mean?&#x27; Whatever you want it to mean, you know ... you decide.&quot;

Brian Baker, who joined the band later in their career, summed it up as follows:

&quot;The name Bad Religion and the crossbuster logo came to pass in the minds of two fifteen-year-olds who were trying to find the most offensive name and image they could possibly find for the punk band they were starting in their garage ... These are not people who thought that 21 years later they would be on the telephone doing interviews.&quot;

The crossbuster logo features prominently in the band&#x27;s merchandising and album art.

<text>Gare Montparnasse (; Montparnasse station), officially Paris Montparnasse, is one of the seven large Paris railway termini, and is located in the 14th and 15th arrondissements.

The station opened in 1840, was rebuilt in 1852 and relocated in 1969 to a new station just south of the original location, where subsequently the prominent Montparnasse Tower was constructed. It is a central element to the Montparnasse area. The original station is noted for the Montparnasse derailment, where a steam train crashed through the station in 1895, an event captured in widely known photographs and reproduced in full scale in several locations.

The station serves intercity TGV trains to the west and southwest of France including Tours, Bordeaux, Rennes and Nantes, and suburban and regional services on the Transilien Paris – Montparnasse routes. There is also a metro station. Gare Montparnasse is the only mainline terminus in Paris not directly connected to the RER system, though the Montparnasse main line is connected to the RER at Versailles-Chantiers and the LGV Atlantique at Massy Palaiseau.

==History==
The station opened in 1840 as &quot;Gare de l&#x27;Ouest&quot;, later being renamed. A second station was built between 1848 and 1852.

On 25 August 1944, the German military governor of Paris, General von Choltitz, surrendered his garrison to the French General Philippe Leclerc at the old station. (see Liberation of Paris).

During the 1960s, a newer station integrated into a complex of office buildings was built further down the track. In 1969, the old station was demolished and the Tour Montparnasse built on its site. An extension was built in 1990 to host the TGV Atlantique.

==1895 derailment==

The Gare Montparnasse became famous for the derailment on 22 October 1895 of the Granville–Paris Express, which overran the buffer stop. The engine careened across almost of the station concourse, crashed through a thick wall, shot across a terrace and smashed out of the station, plummeting onto the Place de Rennes below, where it stood on its nose. Two of the 131 passengers sustained injuries, along with the fireman and two conductors. The only fatality was a woman on the street below, Marie-Augustine Aguilard, who was temporarily taking over her husband&#x27;s work duty while he went out to get the newspapers. She was killed by falling masonry. The railway company later paid for her funeral and provided a pension to look after her two children. The accident was caused by a faulty Westinghouse brake and the engine driver, who was trying to make up lost time.
A conductor was given a 25-franc fine and the engine driver a 50-franc fine.

Replicas of the train crash are recreated outside the Mundo a Vapor (&quot;Steam World&quot;) museum chain buildings in Brazil, in the southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul, in the city of Canela.
==Train services==
From Paris Montparnasse train services depart to major French cities such as: Le Mans, Rennes, Saint-Brieuc, Brest, Saint-Malo, Vannes, Lorient, Quimper, Angers, Nantes, Saint-Nazaire, Tours, Poitiers, La Rochelle, Angoulême, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Bayonne and Granville. The station is also served by suburban trains heading to the west and south-west of Paris.

<text>Sluis (; ; ) is a city and municipality located in the west of Zeelandic Flanders, in the south-western Dutch province of Zeeland.

The current incarnation of the municipality has existed since 1 January 2003. The former municipalities of Oostburg and Sluis-Aardenburg merged on that date. The latter of these two municipalities was formed from a merger between the previous municipality named Sluis and the former municipality of Aardenburg in 1995.

==History==

The town received city rights in 1290. In 1340 the Battle of Sluys was fought nearby at sea during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. There is a record of one of the first lotteries with money on 9 May 1455 of 1737 florins (US$170,000, in 2014).

During the Eighty Years&#x27; War in 1587 the town was captured by Spanish troops under the Duke of Parma and was retaken in 1604 by a Dutch and English force under Maurice of Nassau.

From 2006 until its closure in 2013, Oud Sluis was one of only two Michelin three-starred restaurants in the entire country.

==Geography==

In addition to the town of Sluis itself, the municipality is made up of the following population centres:
Sint Anna ter Muiden, with a population of only 50 (2001), is a small village about 1 km west of the town of Sluis, located on the westernmost point of the Netherlands.

== Demography ==
The population of the city is 2,040 (as of 2001).

== Transport ==
A ferry connection across the Westerschelde exists between Breskens and Vlissingen. After the opening of the Westerschelde tunnel near Terneuzen in 2003, the ferry now carries only pedestrian and bicycle traffic.

<text>The Fugees () were an American hip hop group formed in South Orange, New Jersey in 1990. The trio of Wyclef Jean, Pras Michel, and Lauryn Hill was known for their fusion of hip hop, reggae, R&amp;B, and funk, their socially conscious lyrics, and use of live instrumentation during their performances. Their sound stood apart during the gangsta rap-dominated era, as they became one of the most significant alternative hip hop acts. Their name, derived from &quot;refugees&quot;, referenced Jean&#x27;s immigrant background, Michel&#x27;s Haitian heritage, and themes of resilience in their music, which occasionally incorporated Haitian Creole.

After signing with Ruffhouse Records, an imprint of Columbia Records, in 1993, the Fugees released their debut album &quot;Blunted on Reality&quot; (1994). Initially met with modest sales, it gained traction as they built a reputation in local clubs and talent shows. Producer Salaam Remi remixed their songs &quot;Nappy Heads&quot; and &quot;Vocab&quot;, with the former charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, helping them gain underground recognition. Their second album, &quot;The Score&quot; (1996), was a massive commercial success, spawning the hit singles &quot;Fu-Gee-La&quot;, &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, and their reimagined version of &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, which topped the charts in over 20 countries worldwide. The album peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, was certified 7× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and was nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards, making it only the second rap album to receive the honor. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, its success placed the Fugees &quot;at the forefront of pop music&quot;. 

At their peak, the Fugees collaborated with various artists, appearing on Simply Red&#x27;s &quot;Angel&quot;, and releasing &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;, which featured Busta Rhymes, A Tribe Called Quest and John Forté, both of which reached the top five on the UK Singles Chart. They also collaborated with Bounty Killer on the rap opera single &quot;Hip-Hopera&quot;. In 1997, they performed what was the largest staged concert in Haitian history, becoming one of the country&#x27;s most significant musical events. However, internal conflicts led to their disbandment later that year, with each member pursuing solo careers. They have reunited periodically, including for tours and live performances, such as their appearance in &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot; (2005). 

The Fugees have won two Grammy Awards, a Brit Award for International Group, and the Medal of Honor from Haitian President René Préval. They are frequently ranked among the greatest rap groups, with &quot;Billboard&quot; stating that they &quot;contributed to the diversification of Black identity in popular culture through potent rhymes that were equal parts conscious and commercially relevant&quot;. VH1 named them among the 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Artists (2003). &quot;The Score&quot; was included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums, while &quot;Ready or Not&quot; was recognized as one of the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==History==
===Formation and beginnings===
Lauryn Hill and Pras first met at Columbia High School, in Maplewood, New Jersey. Pras, Lauryn, and a mutual friend Marcy Harriell formed a musical trio called Tyme; Pras&#x27; cousin, Wyclef Jean, joined the line-up and Marcy left soon afterward, in 1990. The moniker &quot;Tranzlator Crew&quot; refers to the name of their band at the time, which included Johnny Wise on drums, Ti Bass (Jerry Duplessis) on bass guitar, and original DJ Hard Hittin Harry (Harry D’Janite). DJ Leon (Leon Higgins) joined the group in 1994 after Harry left to pursue a career as a publicist. In 1993, after some gigs and recorded demos, the trio signed to Ruffhouse, distributed through Columbia Records. The members then changed the group&#x27;s name to &quot;Fugees&quot;, which was purposely taken from a word often used derogatorily to refer to Haitian-Americans (&quot;refugee&quot;). Refugee Camp, while a name sometimes credited to the trio, also refers to a number of artists affiliated with the members, and particularly Jean.

=== &quot;Blunted on Reality&quot; ===
The trio soon changed musical direction, and released its first hip-hop LP, &quot;Blunted on Reality&quot;, under the guidance of Kool and the Gang&#x27;s producer Ronald Bell. The group wrote and recorded the album in 1992 at the House of Music Studios in West Orange, New Jersey. However, due to a dispute with its record label, the album was not released until February 1, 1994. The Fugees&#x27; members have subsequently said that they allowed the producers to have too much control over the album&#x27;s content and form. Although the album did not contain as many lyrics with overtly political messages as songs from their next and better-known album &quot;The Score&quot;, there were still political intentions. Though &quot;Blunted on Reality&quot; spawned the three singles &quot;Boof Baf&quot;, &quot;Vocab&quot;, and &quot;Nappy Heads&quot;, they struggled to gain mainstream attention despite earning plaudits for its artistic quality and innovative use of samples. The album&#x27;s most successful single was a remixed version of the song &quot;Nappy Heads&quot; produced by Salaam Remi. The remix peaked at number 49 on the Billboard Hot 100.

===&quot;The Score&quot;===
The musical qualities of the first Fugees record were revisited with their sophomore effort &quot;The Score&quot;, which was released in February 1996. &quot;The Score&quot; was the Fugees&#x27; final record before their disbandment the following year.

&quot;The Score&quot; became one of the biggest hits of 1996 and one of the best-selling hip-hop albums of all time. The Fugees first gained attention for its cover versions of old favorites, with the group&#x27;s reinterpretations of &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; by Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers and &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot; (first recorded by Lori Lieberman in 1971, remade by Roberta Flack in 1973), the latter being their biggest hit.

The album also included a re-interpretation of The Delfonics&#x27; &quot;Ready or Not Here I Come (Can&#x27;t Hide From Love)&quot; in their hit single, &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, which featured a prominent sample of Enya&#x27;s &quot;Boadicea&quot; without the singer&#x27;s permission. This prompted a lawsuit resulting in a settlement where Enya was given credit and royalties for her sample. The group members have continuously thanked and praised Enya for her deep understanding of the situation, for example in the liner notes of &quot;The Score&quot;.

The Fugees won two 1997 Grammy Awards with &quot;The Score&quot; (Best Rap Album) and &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; (Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group).

They produced remixes of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot; and &quot;2 Bad&quot;.

===Later career===
In 1997, the Fugees were featured on the song &quot;Hip-Hopera&quot; by Bounty Killer, which spent five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while peaking at number 81. The group also recorded the song &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; featuring Busta Rhymes, A Tribe Called Quest &amp; John Forté, for the 1996 documentary &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;.

Later that year, the Fugees all began solo projects: Hill began writing and producing for a number of artists (including Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and Mary J. Blige) and started work on her critically acclaimed &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;; Jean also began producing for a number of artists (including Canibus, Destiny&#x27;s Child and Carlos Santana) and released his debut album &quot;Wyclef Jean Presents The Carnival&quot;; Pras, with Mýa and Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard, recorded the single &quot;Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are)&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Bulworth&quot;. In 1998, they reunited to shoot a music video for the song &quot;Just Happy to Be Me&quot; which appeared in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; special &quot;Elmopalooza&quot;, and also on the Grammy Award-winning soundtrack album.

The three Fugees reunited and performed on September 18, 2004, at the concert in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn featured in the film &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot; (2004), headlining a star-studded bill that included Kanye West, Mos Def, Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, The Roots, Talib Kweli, Common, Big Daddy Kane, Dead Prez, Cody ChesnuTT and John Legend. Their performance received several positive reviews, many of which praised Hill&#x27;s near a cappella rendition of &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;.

The Fugees made their first televised appearance in almost ten years at BET&#x27;s 2005 Music Awards on June 28, opening the show with a twelve-minute set. With a new album announced to be in the works, their final track, &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, was leaked online and eventually released as an Internet single on September 27, 2005. It peaked at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Chart.

In November 2005, the Fugees embarked on a European tour – the members&#x27; first together since 1997 – from 30 November to 20 December, playing in Finland, Austria, Norway, Germany, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Slovakia. The group had been scheduled to play at the Hammersmith Apollo on November 25, 2005; however, it was forced to move the gig to December due to production issues. The tour received mixed reviews. On February 6, 2006, the group reunited for a free show in Hollywood, with tickets given away to about 8,000 fans by local radio stations. Later that month, a new track called &quot;Foxy&quot; was leaked, a song dubbed the &quot;real return of the Fugees&quot; by several online music blogs.

However, following the reunion tour, the album that was said to be in the works did not materialize and was postponed indefinitely, as relationships between band members apparently deteriorated. During the recording of the album, the group was plagued with creative differences. They recorded a song titled &quot;Lips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, but Hill did not like the song and, after some disagreements over it, the group disbanded again. The song was ultimately given to singer Shakira with featured vocals by Jean and after the title was changed to &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, the song was released a single and became a global hit. In August 2007, a year after the group&#x27;s second disbandment, Pras stated, &quot;Before I work with Lauryn Hill again, you will have a better chance of seeing Osama bin Laden and [George W.] Bush in Starbucks having a latte, discussing foreign policies, before there will be a Fugees reunion&quot;. Meanwhile, in September 2007, an equally outspoken Wyclef told &quot;Blues &amp; Soul&quot;: &quot;I feel the first issue that needs to be addressed is that Lauryn needs help... In my personal opinion, those Fugees reunion shows shouldn&#x27;t have been done, because we wasn&#x27;t ready. I really felt we shoulda first all gone into a room with Lauryn and a psychiatrist... But, you know, I do believe Lauryn can get help. And, once she does work things out, hopefully a proper and enduring Fugees reunion will happen.&quot; On July 15, 2017, an old song by the Fugees was leaked on Hot 97 radio; this led to reports that the group was reforming, which were later denied by group members on Twitter.

After the group split, Wyclef Jean co-founded and headed the Yele Haiti Foundation, a non-profit organization &quot;focusing on emergency relief, employment, youth development and education, and tree planting and agriculture&quot; in Haiti. Pras Michel starred in a documentary about homelessness in Los Angeles and remained outspoken about Haitian politics. Lauryn Hill continued recording and performing socially conscious music and went on to advocate for female empowerment especially within the music industry. The Fugees also turned their recording studio, the Booga Basement, into a transitional house for young Haitian refugees immigrating to the United States.

In September 2021, the Fugees announced a reunion tour to celebrate 25 years of their album, &quot;The Score.&quot; On Friday, October 29, 2021, the Fugees announced that their reunion tour dates were postponed to early 2022. However, on January 21, 2022, the Fugees released a statement saying they would not be going on tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour was rescheduled and set to begin in August 2024 but was quietly canceled three days before the first show, with no reason given to customers receiving refunds. The UK leg of the tour did go ahead as planned.

==Legacy==
The Fugees have often been referred to as one of the most influential and significant groups of the 1990s, with &quot;Billboard&quot; stating &quot;their influence on modern hip-hop and R&amp;B music is undeniable&quot;. They are often considered to be one of the definitive alternative hip hop acts, being one of the first alternative hip hop acts to break into the mainstream. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, their success helped establish Ruffhouse Records as a major record label. &quot;Consequence&quot; noted the Fugees for putting Haiti on the hip hop map. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; argued that the group paved the way for modern alternative music and stated &quot;If you listen to modern hip-hop today, so many of the new faces went to the Fugees&#x27; School of Songwriting.&quot;

While Matthew Ismael Ruiz of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, noted the group for removing negative connotations of Haitian immigration and the word &#x27;Refugee&#x27;, stating that &quot;The Fugees managed to diversify the voice of the ghetto, one often depicted in a single dimension. They reclaimed pride for Haitians worldwide, a heritage maligned for its postcolonial poverty and strife but still remembered as the setting for the new world’s first successful revolt of enslaved people against their oppressors. Their sound was multifaceted because they were, too, their music diverse, just like the Black experience.&quot; &quot;The Ringer&quot; noted that the Fugees delivered political messages and brought hip hop to the mainstream in their music by blending elements of pop, soul, dancehall and Caribbean music, making it more palpable for a wider audience without making the message dense, stating &quot;the Fugees disguised resistance as art, the same way that enslaved Africans once hid martial arts from their colonial masters by pretending that they were a dance.&quot;

Writing for The Recording Academy, music journalist Kathy Iandoli wrote about the impact of the group on the hip hop genre stating: &quot;As hip-hop&#x27;s East and West Coasts continued their tussle, their lighter-hearted approach to socially conscious rap curtailed any overarching assumptions that hip-hop was going down a &quot;bad road&quot;. Plus, they had Lauryn Hill, who doubled as a songbird and lyrical spitfire. Together, by juxtaposing live instrumentation, soulful melodies and abstract bars, The Fugees gave hip-hop a renewed spirit and propelled it to a different kind of mainstream&quot;.The group has sold over twenty-two million records worldwide, and are one of the biggest-selling hip hop groups of all time. Multiple recording artists have cited the Fugees as an influence, including Bono, Drake, Kanye West, Akon, Black Eyed Peas, Young Thug, Bridgit Mendler, Sean Kingston, Ava Max, Doja Cat, Bastille, The Kid Laroi, Post Malone, DJ Khaled, and Diplo.

The impact of the Fugees has been compared to that of the Beatles, with U2&#x27;s Bono calling them hip hop&#x27;s version of the Beatles. Daryl McIntosh of &quot;Albumism&quot; compared the public response from the group&#x27;s sophomore album, &quot;The Score&quot; to that of Beatlemania, referring to it as &quot;Fugee-mania&quot;. Former United States President Barack Obama, named the Fugees single &quot;Ready or Not&quot; his favorite song ever. Their album &quot;The Score&quot; was placed on the list of 200 Definitive Albums in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (2007) by National association of recording merchandisers (NARM). &quot;Ready or Not&quot; was named among the Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll (2018) by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The following year, they were inducted into the N.J. Pop &amp; Rock Hall.

A photograph of the group taken in 1994, has been stored and collected by the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. In 2020, &quot;The Score&quot; ranked 134th on the revised version of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The following year, their version of &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; was placed on the revised version of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. MTV ranked it the ninth-greatest hip-hop group of all time (2007). BET placed the group on its list of &#x27;Hip Hop&#x27;s Greatest Trios&#x27; (2012).

<text>The HomePNA Alliance (formerly the Home Phoneline Networking Alliance, also known as HPNA) is an incorporated non-profit industry association of companies that develops and standardizes technology for home networking over the existing coaxial cables and telephone wiring within homes, so new wires do not need to be installed. HomePNA creates industry specifications which it then standardizes under the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standards body.

HomePNA was developed for entertainment applications such as IPTV which require good quality of service (QoS). HomePNA promoter companies are AT&amp;T Inc., Technicolor SA, Pace plc, Sigma Designs, Motorola, Cisco Systems, Sunrise Telecom and K-Micro. 

== History ==

HomePNA 1.0 technology was developed by Tut Systems in the 1990s. The original protocols used balanced pair telephone wire. 

HomePNA 2.0 was developed by Epigram and was approved by the ITU as Recommendations G.9951, G.9952 and G.9953.

HomePNA 3.0 was developed by Broadcom (which had purchased Epigram) and Coppergate Communications and was approved by the ITU as Recommendation G.9954 in February 2005.

HomePNA 3.1 was developed by Coppergate Communications and was approved by the ITU as Recommendation G.9954 in January 2007. HomePNA 3.1 added Ethernet over coax. HomePNA 3.1 uses frequencies above those used for digital subscriber line and analog voice calls over phone wires and below those used for broadcast and direct-broadcast satellite TV over coax, so it can coexist with those services on the same wires.

In March 2009, HomePNA announced a liaison agreement with the HomeGrid Forum to promote the ITU-T G.hn wired home networking standard. In May 2013 the HomePNA alliance merged with the HomeGrid Forum.

== Technical characteristics ==

HomePNA uses frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), which uses different frequencies for voice and data on the same wires without interfering with each other. A standard phone line has enough room to support voice, high-speed DSL and a landline phone.

Two custom chips designed using the HPNA specifications were developed by Broadcom: the 4100 chip can send and receive signals over 1,000 ft (305 m) on a typical phone line. The larger 4210 controller chip strips away noise and passes data on. 

A HomePNA setup would include a HomePNA card or external adapter for each computer, an external adapter, cables, and software. A low-pass filter may be needed between any phones and their respective jacks to block noise. HomePNA adapters come in PCI, USB, and PC Card formats.

== Alternatives ==

Alternatives to HomePNA include power line communication, Wi-Fi, data over cable, and multimedia over coax.

<text>In photography, the sunny 16 rule (also known as the sunny rule) is a method of estimating correct daylight exposures without a light meter. Apart from the advantage of independence from a light meter, the sunny 16 rule can also aid in achieving correct exposure of difficult subjects. As the rule is based on incident light, rather than reflected light as with most camera light meters, very bright or very dark subjects are compensated for. The rule serves as a mnemonic for the camera settings obtained on a sunny day using the exposure value (EV) system.

==Using the rule==
The basic rule is, &quot;On a sunny day set aperture to and shutter speed to the [reciprocal of the] ISO film speed [or ISO setting] for a subject in direct sunlight.&quot; In simplest terms, bright sun = f:16 @ 1/film-speed-number (aperture and shutter speed, respectively).

For example:

* On a sunny day at ISO 100 (&quot;100 speed film&quot;), the aperture is set to and the shutter speed (i.e. exposure time) to or seconds (on some cameras second is the closest available setting to second).
* On a sunny day at ISO 200 and aperture at , set shutter speed to or .
* On a sunny day at ISO 400 and aperture at , set shutter speed to or .

Shutter speeds can be changed as long as the f-number is adjusted accordingly, e.g. second at gives equivalent exposure to second at . Exposure adjustments are done in a manner that retains the EV. As the aperture is opened (f:11, f:5.6, f:4, etc.) the shutter-speed/exposure-time is reduced by a factor of approximately one-half (1/250, 1/500, 1/1000, etc.) This follows the mathematical relationship between aperture and shutter speed where exposure is inversely proportional to the square of the aperture ratio and proportional to exposure time; thus, to maintain a constant level of exposure, a change in aperture by a factor &quot;c&quot; requires a change in exposure time by a factor and vice versa. A change in the aperture of 1 stop always corresponds to a factor close to the square root of 2, thus the above rule.

==Alternative rule==
The sunny 16 rule can be used in varying light by setting the shutter speed nearest to the ISO film speed and f-number according to a generalized exposure table, as:

<doc id="168422" wikidata="Q1519986" url="?curid=168422" title="Geto Boys">
<text>Geto Boys (originally spelled Ghetto Boys) was an American hip hop group originally formed in Houston, Texas. They saw commercial success in the 1990s with the lineup consisting of Bushwick Bill, Scarface and Willie D. The group became best known for their 1991 single &quot;Mind Playing Tricks on Me&quot;, which peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Formed in 1986, the group was active until the 2019 death of Bushwick Bill. 

The Geto Boys became notorious for lyrics which discussed controversial subject matter, including misogyny, violence, psychotic experiences, and drug addiction. About.com ranked the Geto Boys No. 10 on its list of the 25 Best Rap Groups of All-Time, describing them as &quot;southern rap pioneers who paved the way for future southern hip-hop acts.&quot;

==History==
The original Ghetto Boys consisted first of Raheem, The Sire Jukebox and Sir Rap-A-Lot. When Raheem and Sir Rap-A-Lot left, the group added DJ Ready Red, Prince Johnny C, and Little Billy, the dancer who later came to be known as Bushwick Bill. The first single the group released was &quot;Car Freak&quot; in 1986, which then followed with two singles: &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27;/I Run This&quot; in 1987, and &quot;Be Down&quot; in 1988. In 1988, the group released its debut album, &quot;Making Trouble&quot;. With the release receiving very little attention, the group broke up shortly thereafter and a new line-up was put together in which Bushwick Bill was joined by Scarface and Willie D, both aspiring solo artists. This new line-up recorded the 1989 album, &quot;Grip It! On That Other Level&quot;. The group&#x27;s 1990 album, &quot;The Geto Boys&quot;, caused Def American Recordings, the label to which the group was signed at the time, to switch distributors from Geffen Records to Warner Bros. Records (with marketing for the album done by Warner Bros. sister label Giant Records) because of controversy over the lyrics.

In the early 1990s, several American politicians attacked rap artists associated with the subgenre gangsta rap, including the Geto Boys. A high-profile incident in which Bushwick Bill lost an eye in a shooting helped boost sales of the group&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;We Can&#x27;t Be Stopped&quot;. The album cover features a graphic picture of the injured Bushwick being carted through a hospital by Scarface and Willie D. On the album&#x27;s title track, the group responded to Geffen Records ending its distribution deal with Def American. The album featured the single &quot;Mind Playing Tricks on Me,&quot; which became a hit and charted at No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

After Willie D left the group, Scarface and Bushwick Bill continued with the Geto Boys with the addition of Big Mike, who made his debut appearance with the group on 1993&#x27;s album &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot;. &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot; was certified gold. The album spawned one top 40 hit in &quot;Six Feet Deep&quot; which peaked at #40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Subsequently, Big Mike was dropped and Willie D returned for 1996&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;The Resurrection&quot;, and the 1998 followup &quot;Da Good Da Bad &amp; Da Ugly&quot;, of which Bushwick Bill was not a part. After three years on hiatus, the group reunited in 2002 to record its seventh album, &quot;The Foundation&quot;, which was released on January 25, 2005. The Geto Boys were featured on Scarface&#x27;s &quot;My Homies Part 2&quot; album.

The song &quot;Street Life&quot; from &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot; was featured on the motion picture &quot;South Central&quot;. A video clip for the song with footage from the film was released. Although the band rarely releases albums or perform together, the group came together for a reunion at Cypress Hill&#x27;s SmokeOut festival in San Bernardino, California on October 23, 2009. In 2010, Bushwick Bill was threatened with deportation to Jamaica. In a 2015 DJ Vlad interview, Scarface stated that he will not be involved in another Geto Boys album.

On August 24, 2018, founding member DJ Ready Red died at the age of 53, from an apparent heart attack.

Following the stage 4 pancreatic cancer diagnosis of Bushwick Bill in early 2019, a farewell tour, titled &quot;The Beginning of a Long Goodbye, The Final Farewell&quot; was announced, with a portion of the proceeds being donated to pancreatic cancer awareness. However, this tour was cancelled just before its anticipated start. On June 9, 2019, Bushwick Bill died as a result of pancreatic cancer, at the age of 52.

==Lyrics and influence==
The group&#x27;s name, Geto Boys, comes from an alternate spelling of the word &quot;ghetto&quot;. For its first two albums, &quot;Making Trouble&quot; (1988) and &quot;Grip It! On That Other Level&quot; (1989), the spelling was the English standard &quot;Ghetto Boys&quot;. For their third album, &quot;The Geto Boys&quot;, they changed it to the &quot;Geto&quot; spelling, which the group has used since. The Geto Boys&#x27; lyrics push gangsta rap themes to extremes, and sometimes focus on murder, explicit sex, and violence. The group is credited for putting Southern hip hop on the hip hop music map and inspired a legion of acts, including 2Pac, Eminem, UGK, T.I., Goodie Mob, Outkast, 50 Cent, Chamillionaire, Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Young Jeezy, Juvenile, Mystikal, Mac Lethal, Esham and Insane Clown Posse. Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s Violent J (Joseph Bruce) described the Geto Boys as the first rappers to perform horrorcore, with their song &quot;Assassins&quot;, released on their debut album, &quot;Making Trouble&quot;. Bruce says that the Geto Boys continued to pioneer the style with their second release &quot;Grip It! On That Other Level&quot;, with songs such as &quot;Mind of a Lunatic&quot; and &quot;Trigga-Happy Nigga&quot;. Conversely, &quot;The Unseen&quot;, a song which appears on the group&#x27;s compilation &quot;Uncut Dope&quot;, expresses anti-abortion views.

The Geto Boys&#x27; popularity was boosted somewhat in 1999 by the prominent use of two songs—&quot;Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta&quot; (released as a promotional single for the 1992 compilation album &quot;Uncut Dope&quot;) and &quot;Still&quot; (from &quot;The Resurrection&quot;)—in Mike Judge&#x27;s comedy satire film &quot;Office Space&quot;. The song &quot;Mind of a Lunatic&quot; has been covered by many recording acts including Marilyn Manson in 2003, as a B-side off the album &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot;. The single &quot;Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta&quot; has also been covered by the band Aqueduct and country singer Carter Falco.

The Geto Boys were also heavily influenced by the social politics of the day. Their lyrics consistently include themes ranging from police brutality (such as in &quot;Crooked Officer&quot;) to concerns over the negative impact of violence on the urban community (such as &quot;The World Is a Ghetto&quot;, &quot;Geto Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Six Feet Deep&quot;).

<text>Goldfinger is the seventh novel in Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond series. Written in January and February 1958, it was first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 23 March 1959. The story centres on the investigation by the British Secret Service operative James Bond into the gold-smuggling activities of Auric Goldfinger, who is also suspected by MI6 of being connected to SMERSH, the Soviet counter-intelligence organisation. As well as establishing the background to the smuggling operation, Bond uncovers a much larger plot: Goldfinger plans to steal the gold reserves of the United States from Fort Knox.

Fleming developed the James Bond character in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, presenting him as a more complex individual than in the previous novels, and bringing out a theme of Bond as a St George figure. This theme is echoed by the fact that it is a British agent sorting out an American problem. In common with his other Bond stories, Fleming used the names of people he knew, or knew of, throughout his story, including the book&#x27;s eponymous villain, who was named after the architect Ernő Goldfinger. On learning of the use of his name, Goldfinger threatened to sue, before the matter was settled out of court. Auric Goldfinger is obsessed by gold and is—to Bond&#x27;s eye—a gauche individual with unusual appetites; Fleming probably based the character on the American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard Jr. Fleming also used his own experiences within the book; the round of golf played with Goldfinger was based on a 1957 tournament at the Berkshire Golf Club in which Fleming partnered Peter Thomson, the winner of The Open Championship.

On its release &quot;Goldfinger&quot; went to the top of the best-seller lists; the novel was broadly well received by the critics and was favourably compared to the works of the thriller writers H. C. McNeile and John Buchan. &quot;Goldfinger&quot; was serialised as a daily story and as a comic strip in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, before it became the third James Bond feature film of the Eon Productions series, released in 1964 and starring Sean Connery as Bond. In 2010 &quot;Goldfinger&quot; was adapted for BBC Radio with Toby Stephens as Bond and Sir Ian McKellen as Goldfinger.

==Plot==
Happenstance&lt;br&gt;
While changing planes in Miami after closing down a Mexican heroin-smuggling operation, the British Secret Service operative James Bond meets Junius Du Pont, a rich American businessman whom Bond had briefly met and gambled with in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. Du Pont asks Bond to watch Auric Goldfinger, with whom Du Pont is playing canasta, to discover if he is cheating. Bond soon realises that Goldfinger is using his assistant, Jill Masterton, to spy on Du Pont&#x27;s cards. Bond blackmails Goldfinger into admitting his guilt and paying back Du Pont&#x27;s lost money; Bond also has a brief affair with Masterton. Back in London, Bond&#x27;s superior, M, tasks him with determining how Goldfinger is smuggling gold out of Britain; M also suspects Goldfinger of being connected to SMERSH and financing their western networks with his gold. Bond visits the Bank of England for a briefing on the methods of gold smuggling.

Coincidence&lt;br&gt;
Bond contrives to meet and play a round of golf with Goldfinger; Goldfinger attempts to win the golf match by cheating, but Bond turns the tables on him, beating him in the process. He is subsequently invited to Goldfinger&#x27;s mansion near Reculver where he narrowly escapes being caught on camera looking through the house. Goldfinger introduces Bond to his factotum, a Korean named Oddjob.

Issued by MI6 with an Aston Martin DB Mark III, Bond trails Goldfinger in his vintage Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost (adapted with armour plating and bulletproof glass), driven by Oddjob. Both travel by air ferries to Switzerland. Bond manages to trace Goldfinger to a warehouse in Geneva, where he finds that the armour of the Rolls-Royce is actually white-gold, cast into panels at his Kent refinery. When the car reaches the factory in Switzerland (Enterprises Auric AG), Goldfinger recasts the gold from the armour panels into aircraft seats and fits the seats to the aeroplanes of Mecca Charter Airline, in which he holds a large stake. The gold is finally sold in India at a large profit. Bond foils an assassination attempt on Goldfinger by Jill Masterton&#x27;s sister, Tilly, to avenge Jill&#x27;s death at Goldfinger&#x27;s hands: he had painted her body with gold paint, which killed her. Bond and Tilly attempt to escape when the alarm is raised, but are captured.

Enemy action&lt;br&gt;
Bond is tortured by Oddjob when he refuses to confess his role in trailing Goldfinger. In a desperate attempt to escape being cut in two by a circular saw, Bond offers to work for Goldfinger, a ruse that Goldfinger initially refuses but then accepts. Bond and Tilly are subsequently taken to Goldfinger&#x27;s operational headquarters in a warehouse in New York City. They are put to work as secretaries for a meeting between Goldfinger and several gangsters (including the Spangled Mob and the Mafia), who have been recruited to assist in &quot;Operation Grand Slam&quot;—stealing gold from the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox. One of the gang leaders, Helmut Springer, refuses to join the operation and is killed by Oddjob. Bond learns that the operation includes killing the inhabitants of Fort Knox by introducing poison into the water supply. He manages to conceal a message in the toilet of Goldfinger&#x27;s private plane, where he hopes it will be found and sent to Pinkertons, where his friend and ex-counterpart Felix Leiter now works.

Operation Grand Slam commences, and it transpires that Leiter has found and acted on Bond&#x27;s message. A battle commences, but Goldfinger escapes. Tilly, a lesbian, hopes that one of the gang leaders, Pussy Galore (the leader of a gang of lesbian burglars), will protect her, but she (Tilly) is killed by Oddjob. Goldfinger, Oddjob and the Mafia bosses all escape in the melee. Bond is drugged before his flight back to England and wakes to find he has been captured by Goldfinger, who has murdered the crime bosses (except Galore), drugged a BOAC flightcrew and hijacked their jetliner. Bond manages to break a window, causing a depressurisation that blows Oddjob out of the plane; he then fights and strangles Goldfinger. At gunpoint, he forces the crew to ditch in the sea near the Canadian coast, where they are rescued by a nearby weathership.

==Background and writing history==
By January 1958 the author Ian Fleming had published five novels in the preceding five years: &quot;Casino Royale&quot; in 1953, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1954), &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1955), &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1956) and &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; in 1957. A sixth, &quot;Dr. No&quot;, was being edited and prepared for production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot; magazine: &quot;I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour&#x27;s work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.&quot; He returned to London in March that year with a 270-page typescript, the longest he had produced to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title &quot;The Richest Man in the World&quot;; few alterations were made to the story before publication.

Although Fleming did not date the events within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put the events of &quot;Goldfinger&quot; in 1957; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story to have taken place from late April to early June that year.

Fleming had long been fascinated with gold. He was a collector of Spanish doubloons, and he commissioned a gold-plated typewriter from the Royal Typewriter Company, although he never actually used it; he wrote with a gold-tipped ballpoint pen and included the theft or obtaining of gold in several of his stories. When researching for &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, Fleming reinforced his knowledge of gold by sending a questionnaire to an expert at the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths—one of the livery companies of the City of London who assay precious metals for purity—with a list of queries about gold, its properties and the background of the industry, including smuggling.

Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger&#x27;s first encounter. The architect Ernő Goldfinger threatened to sue Fleming over the use of the name. With the book already printed but not released, Fleming threatened to add an erratum slip to the book changing the name from Goldfinger to Goldprick and explaining why; the matter was settled out of court after the publishers, Jonathan Cape, paid Ernő&#x27;s legal costs, agreed to ensure the name Auric was always used in conjunction with Goldfinger and sent him six copies of the novel.

Once Fleming completed the novel—which he found the easiest of all the Bond books to write—he thought he had exhausted his inspiration for plots. He told the writer William Plomer—his friend who proof-read all the Bond books—that &quot;Goldfinger&quot; was to be &quot;the last full length folio on Bond ... Though I may be able to think up some episodes for him in the future, I shall never be able to give him 70,000 words again&quot;.

==Development==
===Plot inspirations===

Fleming based some points in the book on events he had read about. The pre-First World War death of a showgirl in Europe after she had covered herself in paint was one such idea, and the depressurisation of Goldfinger&#x27;s plane was a plot device Fleming had intended to use elsewhere, but which he included in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. Some years previously a plane had depressurised over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked out of the window; Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made note of the incident to use it. As he had done in previous Bond novels, Fleming used the names of several friends or associates in the novel. The surname of Sir John Masterman, the MI5 agent and Oxford academic who ran the double-cross system during the Second World War, was used as the basis for the Masterton sisters; Alfred Whiting, the golf professional at Royal St George&#x27;s Golf Club, Sandwich, became Alfred Blacking; while the Royal St George&#x27;s Golf Club itself became the Royal St Mark&#x27;s, for the game between Bond and Goldfinger.

In June 1957 Fleming played in the Bowmaker Pro-Am golf tournament at the Berkshire Golf Club, where he partnered Peter Thomson, the winner of The Open Championship; much of the background went into the match between Bond and Goldfinger. One of Fleming&#x27;s neighbours in Jamaica, and later his lover, was Blanche Blackwell; Fleming used Blanche as the model for Pussy Galore, although the name &quot;Pussy&quot; came from Mrs &quot;Pussy&quot; Deakin, formerly Livia Stela, an SOE agent and friend of Fleming&#x27;s wife.

Fleming&#x27;s golf partner, John Blackwell (a cousin to Blanche Blackwell), was also a cousin by marriage to Ernő Goldfinger and disliked him: it was Blackwell who reminded Fleming of the name. Fleming also disliked Goldfinger, who, Fleming thought, destroyed Victorian buildings and replaced them with his own modernist designs, particularly a terrace at Goldfinger&#x27;s own residence at 2 Willow Road, Hampstead. Blackwell had his name used as the heroin smuggler at the beginning of the book, with a sister who was a heroin addict.

There were some similarities between Ernő and Auric Goldfinger: both were Jewish immigrants who came to Britain from Eastern Europe in the 1930s and both were Marxists. The fictional and real Goldfingers were physically very different. According to the historian Henry Chancellor the likely model for Auric Goldfinger was the American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard Jr., whom Fleming had met in 1949. Engelhard had established a business, the Precious Metals Development Company, which circumvented numerous export restrictions, selling gold ingots directly into Hong Kong.

===Characters===
The character of Bond was developed more in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; than in the previous novels; the historian Jeremy Black considers that Bond &quot;was presented as a complex character&quot;. The novelist Raymond Benson—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—sees &quot;Goldfinger&quot; as a transitional novel, making Bond more human than in previous books and more concerned with what Benson calls &quot;the mortal trappings of life&quot;. This manifests itself in the opening chapter of the book as Bond sits in Miami airport and thinks through his fight with and killing of a Mexican thug. Benson also finds Bond developing something of a sense of humour in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, verbally abusing Oddjob for his own amusement.

The anthropologist Anthony Synnott examined several examples of racism in the Bond novels, and finds in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; examples of &quot;the most blatant racism&quot; of the series, all of which concern the Koreans; as an example, Synnott highlights the sentence &quot;putting Oddjob and any other Korean firmly in his place, which, in Bond&#x27;s estimation, was rather lower than apes in the mammalian hierarchy&quot;. Benson agrees that Bond is shown as a bigot in the passage quoted, and observes that this is the only point in all the works in which Bond disparages a whole race.

The writer Anthony Burgess, in his 1984 work &quot;Ninety-nine Novels&quot;, describes Fleming&#x27;s malefactors as &quot;impossible villains, enemies of democracy, megalomaniacs&quot;; Burgess goes on to write that Goldfinger &quot;is the most extravagant of these&quot;. The character was described by Benson as &quot;Fleming&#x27;s most successful villain&quot; to that point in the series, and Fleming gives him several character flaws that are brought out across the novel. Black writes that psychologically Goldfinger is warped, possibly because of an inferiority complex brought on by his shortness, in contrast to several of Fleming&#x27;s other over-sized villains. Physically he is odd, with a lack of proportion to his body. According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 20th-century British spy novels, in several of Fleming&#x27;s novels he uses &quot;characters as psychological counters in a game of simplified psychology&quot;. Fleming writes that &quot;Bond always mistrusted short men. They grew up from childhood with an inferiority complex. ... Napoleon had been short, and Hitler. It was the short men that caused all the trouble in the world&quot;, an opinion Black considers a reflection of the &quot;racialism and crude psychology&quot; of early-twentieth century literature.

Like many other of Fleming&#x27;s villains, Goldfinger is not of British extraction (although he is a British citizen); other villains have been, for example, Russian, German, Jewish, Chinese-German or Slav. Synnott observes that in many of the Bond novels, including &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;Ugliness, evil and foreignness go together, complementing and reinforcing each other. Ugliness symbolizes evil and evil is symbolized by ugliness and foreignness.&quot;

Fleming employs devices he uses elsewhere in the series to show Goldfinger is corrupt or outside what Fleming considered normal. Goldfinger cheats at cards and golf; Panek considers this is a traditional sign of a gauche individual. Black considers that Goldfinger is portrayed as a killjoy as he does not consume cigarettes or alcohol—unlike many people of the time—but he does pay prostitutes; these aspects of Goldfinger&#x27;s are condemned by Fleming for being outside normal appetites.

Elisabeth Ladenson, the general editor of &quot;Romanic Review&quot;, believes the character of Pussy Galore to be &quot;perhaps the most memorable figure in the Bond periphery&quot;. Galore was introduced by Fleming for Bond to seduce her, proving Bond&#x27;s masculinity by his being able to seduce a lesbian. To some extent the situation also reflected Fleming&#x27;s own opinions, expressed in the novel as part of Bond&#x27;s thoughts, where &quot;her sexual confusion is attributable to women&#x27;s suffrage&quot;; in addition, as Fleming himself put it in the book: &quot;Bond felt the sexual challenge all beautiful Lesbians have for men.&quot; Ladenson points out that, unlike some Bond girls, Galore&#x27;s role in the plot is crucial and she is not just there as an accessory: it is her change of heart that allows good to triumph over evil. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett consider that many of the female characters in the Bond series depart from Fleming&#x27;s accepted cultural norms; both Pussy Galore and Tilly Masterton conform to this rule because they are lesbian. For those that Bond sleeps with, there is a back story explaining why they are outside Fleming&#x27;s norm: in Pussy Galore&#x27;s case, it is because she was raped by her uncle. According to Stephen Heath, the literature and cultural historian, Galore&#x27;s lesbianism is explained by being anti-man, following the rape, and she is converted because, as she says in the book, &quot;I never met a man before&quot;. Bond&#x27;s &#x27;conversion&#x27; of Galore from lesbian to his bed partner &quot;reflected Fleming&#x27;s sexual politics&quot;. It was, Black sees, a &quot;crude end to the book, a form of happy ending&quot;.

==Style==
The sixth Bond novel, &quot;Dr. No&quot; began what the media historian James Chapman describes as the move of the Bond books to &quot;fantastic and highly improbable plots&quot;; Chapman considers that &quot;Goldfinger&quot; maintains that trend. He also finds it &quot;the most implausible of Fleming&#x27;s plots&quot;. Benson states that the plot is impractical and that &quot;sometimes there&#x27;s no logic in the sequence of events&quot;; the author Kingsley Amis—who also later wrote a Bond novel—says that the novel was &quot;more implausible than most&quot;. According to Panek there is an episodic approach in Fleming&#x27;s works; in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; this manifests itself in the use of the card game—something also seen in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Moonraker&quot;; Benson considers the novel to be more episodic than Fleming&#x27;s previous books.

Fleming structured the novel in three sections—&quot;Happenstance&quot;, &quot;Coincidence&quot; and &quot;Enemy action&quot;—which was how Goldfinger described Bond&#x27;s three seemingly coincidental meetings with him. Like &quot;Dr. No&quot;, what seems to be a trivial event—in this case the card game—leads to what Chapman calls &quot;a grandiose criminal conspiracy&quot;. The denouement of the novel is described by Black as &quot;hurried and unsatisfactory&quot;, and the &quot;one-man heroism&quot; of the work is too stretched across the novel.

Benson, and Fleming&#x27;s biographer Matthew Parker, consider &quot;Goldfinger&quot; to be the &quot;densest&quot; of the Bond novels, with a fast pace and high levels of action, in which Bond moves from Miami, via New York to London, then through Kent and northern France to Switzerland, then back to New York, to Kentucky, to New York, Washington, and finally ditching the aeroplane in the North Atlantic.

==Themes==
As with other Bond novels, such as &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, gambling is a theme—not only the money staked on the golf match as part of the novel, but opening with the canasta game. Raymond Benson identified times in the novel when Bond&#x27;s investigation of Goldfinger was a gamble too, and cites Bond tossing a coin to decide on his tactics in relation to his quarry. Once more (as with &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; and &quot;Dr. No&quot;) it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem and this, along with Bond&#x27;s warning to Goldfinger not to underestimate the English, may be seen as Fleming&#x27;s reaction to the lack of US support over the Suez Crisis in 1956.
Benson identifies a theme of Bond acting as St George in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; which, he says, has run in all the novels, but is finally stated explicitly in the book as part of Bond&#x27;s thoughts. This is after Goldfinger reveals he will use an atomic device to open the vault: &quot;Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St George had better get a move on and do something&quot;. Jeremy Black notes that the image of the &quot;latter-day St George [is] again an English, rather than British image&quot;. According to Ladenson, by making Bond St George, &quot;Goldfinger himself ... is a mere obstacle, the dragon to be got rid of before the worthy knight can make off with the duly conquered lady&quot;.

Goldfinger has an obsession with gold to the extent that Ladenson says that he is &quot;a walking tautology&quot;. Ladenson lists both his family name and his first name as being related to gold (&quot;Auric&quot; is an adjective pertaining to gold); his clothes, hair, car and cat are all gold coloured, or a variant thereof; his Korean servants are referred to by Bond as being &quot;yellow&quot;, or yellow-faced&quot;; and he paints his women (usually prostitutes) gold before sex.

As with a number of other villains in the Bond novels, there is a reference to the Second World War, to show the post-war readers how evil Bond&#x27;s villains were. Thus, Goldfinger employs members of the German Luftwaffe, Japanese and Koreans. For Operation Grand Slam, Goldfinger used the poison GB—now known as Sarin—which had been discovered by the Nazis. Pussy Galore&#x27;s all-woman criminal gang has some members that look &quot;like some young SS guardsman&quot;, to underline the connection to evil.

==Publication and reception==

===Publication history===
&quot;Goldfinger&quot; was published on 23 March 1959 in the UK as a hardcover edition by Jonathan Cape; it was 318 pages long and cost fifteen shillings. As with his previous four novels, Fleming came up with the design of the front cover, which featured a rose between a skull&#x27;s teeth. He commissioned Richard Chopping to provide the artwork. According to Jonathan Hopson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the cover&#x27;s &quot;macabre symbolism memorably expresses the novel&#x27;s themes of greed, sex and death&quot;. The book was dedicated to &quot;gentle reader, William Plomer&quot;. The novel went straight to the top of the best-seller lists. Fleming took part in a select number of promotional activities, including appearing on the television programme &quot;The Bookman&quot; and attending a book signing at Harrods. In May 1961 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 161,000 copies before the end of the year. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and, as at 2025, has never been out of print.

In 2023 Ian Fleming Publications—the company that administers all Fleming&#x27;s literary works—had the Bond series edited as part of a sensitivity review to remove or reword some racial or ethnic descriptors. The rerelease of the series was for the 70th anniversary of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, the first Bond novel.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Goldfinger&quot; received more positive reviews than Fleming&#x27;s previous novel, &quot;Dr. No&quot;, which had faced widespread criticism in the British media. Writing in &quot;The Observer&quot;, Maurice Richardson thought that &quot;Mr. Fleming seems to be leaving realism further and further behind and developing only in the direction of an atomic, sophisticated Sapper&quot;. Though Fleming may have left reality behind, Richardson considered that the writer, &quot;even with his forked tongue sticking right through his cheek, ... remains maniacally readable&quot;. Richardson said that Goldfinger &quot;is the most preposterous specimen yet displayed in Mr. Fleming&#x27;s museum of super fiends&quot;, and, referring to the novel&#x27;s central character, observed that &quot;the real trouble with Bond, from a literary point of view, is that he is becoming more and more synthetic and zombie-ish. Perhaps it is just as well.&quot; In &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Roy Perrott observed that &quot;&quot;Goldfinger&quot; ... will not let [Bond&#x27;s] close admirers down&quot;. Perrott thought that overall &quot;Fleming is again at his best when most sportingly Buchan-ish as in the motoring pursuit across Europe&quot;; he summarised the book by saying that it was &quot;hard to put down; but some of us wish we had the good taste just to try&quot;.

&quot;The Times&quot; thought that Bond was &quot;backed up by sound writing&quot; by Fleming; the critic thought that although the plot was grandiose &quot;it sounds—and is—fantastic; the skill of Mr. Fleming is to be measured by the fact that it is made not to seem so&quot;. For &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Michael Robson considered that &quot;a new Bond has emerged from these pages: an agent more relaxed, less promiscuous, less stagily muscular than of yore&quot;. Robson added that &quot;the story, too, is more relaxed&quot;. Robson saw this as a positive development, but it did mean that although &quot;there are incidental displays of the virtuosity to which Mr. Fleming has accustomed us, ... the narrative does not slip into top gear until Goldfinger unfolds his plan&quot;. &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; looked at why Bond was a success and listed &quot;the things that make Bond attractive: the sex, the sadism, the vulgarity of money for its own sake, the cult of power, the lack of standards&quot;. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called &quot;Goldfinger&quot; &quot;Guilt-edged Bond&quot;; the critic for &quot;The Manchester Evening News&quot; thought that &quot;Only Fleming could have got away with it ... outrageously improbable, wickedly funny, wildly exciting&quot;.

Even the &quot;avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man&quot;, Anthony Boucher, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; appeared to enjoy &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, saying &quot;the whole preposterous fantasy strikes me as highly entertaining&quot;. The critic for &quot;The New York Herald Tribune&quot;, James Sandoe considered the book to be &quot;a superlative thriller from our foremost literary magician&quot;.

Burgess cites &quot;Goldfinger&quot; as one of the 99 best novels in English since 1939. &quot;Fleming raised the standard of the popular story of espionage through good writing—a heightened journalistic style—and the creation of a government agent—James Bond, 007—who is sufficiently complicated to compel our interest over a whole series of adventures.&quot;

==Adaptations==
&quot;Goldfinger&quot; was serialised on a daily basis in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper from 18 March 1959 onwards. Fleming&#x27;s original novel was adapted as a daily comic strip which was published in the same paper and syndicated around the world—the first of the novels to be adapted as such. The adaptation ran from 3 October 1960 to 1 April 1961, and Fleming received £1,500 for the British publication and a percentage for syndicated copies. The adaptation was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky. &quot;Goldfinger&quot; was reprinted in 2005 by Titan Books as part of the &quot;Dr. No&quot; anthology, which in addition to &quot;Dr. No&quot;, also included &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; and &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;.
In 1964 &quot;Goldfinger&quot; became the third entry in the James Bond film series. Sean Connery returned as Bond, and the German actor Gert Fröbe played Auric Goldfinger. The film was mostly similar to the novel, but Jill and Tilly Masterton (renamed Masterson for the film) have shortened roles and earlier deaths in the story. The plot of the film was also changed from stealing the gold at Fort Knox to irradiating the gold vault with a dirty bomb. Alan Barnes and Marcus Hearn, in their examination of the Bond films, consider that the film improves on what they see as some of Fleming&#x27;s &quot;ludicrous notions&quot;. The pair highlight the irradiation of the gold in Fort Knox, and the change of Pussy Galore&#x27;s organisation to stunt pilots, rather than masquerading as nurses, as examples of improvements.

The 1973 BBC documentary &quot;Omnibus: The British Hero&quot; featured Christopher Cazenove playing a number of such title characters (e.g. Richard Hannay and Bulldog Drummond), including James Bond in dramatised scenes from &quot;Goldfinger&quot;—notably featuring the hero being threatened with the novel&#x27;s circular saw, rather than the film&#x27;s laser beam—and &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;.

Following its radio version of &quot;Dr. No&quot;, produced in 2008 as a special one-off to mark the centenary of Ian Fleming&#x27;s birth, Eon Productions allowed a second Bond story to be adapted. On 3 April 2010 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation of &quot;Goldfinger&quot; with Toby Stephens (who played the villain Gustav Graves in &quot;Die Another Day&quot;) as Bond, Sir Ian McKellen as Goldfinger and Stephens&#x27;s &quot;Die Another Day&quot; co-star Rosamund Pike as Pussy Galore. The play was adapted from Fleming&#x27;s novel by Archie Scottney and was directed by Martin Jarvis.

<doc id="168429" wikidata="Q974795" url="?curid=168429" title="Guru (rapper)">
<text>Keith Edward Elam (July 17, 1961April 19, 2010), better known by his stage name Guru (a backronym for Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal), was an American rapper, record producer and actor. He was a member of the hip hop duo Gang Starr, along with DJ Premier. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts.

In 2012, About.com placed him #49 on their list of Top 50 MCs of Our Time, and &quot;The Source&quot; ranked him #30 on their list of Top 50 Lyricists of All Time, saying &quot;Guru dropped some of the most thoughtful rhymes on wax&quot;.

Guru died on April 19, 2010, from myeloma at age 48.

== Early life ==
Elam was born in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. His father, Harry Justin Elam served both as a judge and a lawyer and he became the first African American judge appointed to the Boston Municipal Court of Massachusetts and he later also became Chief Justice of the same court and finally as a judge he was appointed as an Associate Justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court. Prior to his judgeship years, between 1971 and 1988, he was a prominent lawyer in the city of Boston from 1952 to 1971 and his mother, Barbara, was the co-director of libraries in the Boston Public Schools system. He attended the Advent School on Beacon Hill in Boston, Noble and Greenough School in Dedham, Massachusetts, and Cohasset High School in Cohasset, Massachusetts for high school. Elam graduated with a degree in business administration from Morehouse College in Atlanta and took graduate classes at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan.

== Musical career ==
Elam began his music career under the pseudonym MC Keithy E but later changed his stage name to Guru. He founded Gang Starr in 1987. The group initially released three records, produced by The 45 King, on the Wild Pitch Records record label, but these records received little attention. After a change in lineup, the group consisted of rapper Guru and producer DJ Premier. Gang Starr released its first LP &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; on Wild Pitch Records; the group achieved a sizable following and released six critically acclaimed and influential albums from 1989 to 2003. Two albums, &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; (1998) and compilation &quot;Full Clip: A Decade of Gang Starr&quot; (1999) were certified gold in the United States by the RIAA. Gang Starr made archetypal East Coast hip hop with Guru&#x27;s rhyming described as sharp-eyed but anti-ostentatious.

In 1993, Guru released the first in a series of four solo albums while still a member of Gang Starr. &quot;Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1&quot; featured collaborations with Donald Byrd, N&#x27;Dea Davenport, MC Solaar and Roy Ayers and received positive reviews. His second solo LP, &quot;Jazzmatazz, Vol. 2: The New Reality&quot;, featured Chaka Khan, Ramsey Lewis, Branford Marsalis and Jamiroquai. The third installment, &quot;Jazzmatazz, Vol. 3: Streetsoul&quot;, was released in 2000, but it received less positive reviews. In reference to the Jazzmatazz project, Guru told Pete Lewis of &quot;Blues &amp; Soul&quot;: &quot;Back around &#x27;93—when I first came up with the Jazzmatazz concept—I was noticing how a lot of cats were digging in the crates and sampling jazz breaks to make hip hop records. But while I thought that was cool, I wanted to take it to the next level and actually create a new genre by getting the actual dudes we were sampling into the studio to jam over hip hop beats with some of the top vocalists of the time. You know, the whole thing was experimental, but I knew it was an idea that would spawn some historic music.&quot;

In 1994, Guru appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as the album of the year by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Guru&#x27;s first solo album not a part the Jazzmatazz series, &quot;Baldhead Slick &amp; da Click&quot;, was released in 2001 to poor reviews. The album reached #22 on the Billboard R&amp;B/Hip Hop album charts. &quot;Version 7.0: The Street Scriptures&quot;, was released in 2005 on Guru&#x27;s own record label, 7 Grand Records. The album was produced by labelmate Solar. It reached #54 on the Billboard R&amp;B albums charts and received mixed reviews.

Guru&#x27;s final releases were the fourth installment in the &quot;Jazzmatazz&quot; series, released in June 2007; and &quot;Guru 8.0: Lost And Found&quot;, released May 19, 2009 (also in collaboration with Solar). A final Gang Starr album, &quot;One of the Best Yet&quot;, was released in 2019.

== Death ==
On February 28, 2010, Guru went into cardiac arrest and, following surgery, fell into a coma. It was claimed that Guru had briefly awakened from his coma but died on April 19, 2010, at the age of 48, from multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer. Guru was survived by his parents, three siblings, and a son named Keith Casim. His production partner, Solar, claimed that Guru had momentarily awakened from his coma to compose a letter to the public, although DJ Premier and members of Guru&#x27;s family stated that he never regained consciousness. Guru&#x27;s family claimed that Solar had prevented them from having contact with Guru during his illness just before his death; the validity of the deathbed letter was consequently challenged by Guru&#x27;s family. In an interview on Conspiracy Worldwide Radio, Solar claimed that he was protective of Guru, and everything he had said was true. This interview was met by extreme emotion from the hip hop community and did little to clear the controversy surrounding his actions.

DJ Premier produced a tribute mix to Guru and has released a public letter along with Guru&#x27;s sister Patricia Elam. Harry J. Elam, an older brother, wrote a personal memoir in remembrance published in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; on April 23, 2010. The Elam family had a Guru tribute website set up where visitors were able to view tributes and sign a memorial page. Guru&#x27;s nephew Justin Nicholas-Elam Ruff made a 16-minute documentary in which he narrated the story of his late uncle.

At the 2011 Grammy Awards, Guru&#x27;s name was not mentioned in the annual retrospective of musicians who had died since the 2010 awards. On April 21, 2011, Revive Da Live Big Band held a tribute show for Guru at Le Poisson Rouge in New York City. The show paid homage to Guru&#x27;s Jazzmatazz series and featured a full jazz band tribute, with all proceeds going towards the Elam family. During the concert, Babygrande Records donated $5000 to Guru&#x27;s son, K.C. Elam.

== Legacy ==
The French city of Montpellier named a small street &quot;Allée Guru&quot; after the rapper, citing his influence on both hip hop and jazz.

<doc id="168430" wikidata="Q196727" url="?curid=168430" title="Circle of confusion">
<text>In optics, a circle of confusion (CoC) is an optical spot caused by a cone of light rays from a lens not coming to a perfect focus when imaging a point source. It is also known as disk of confusion, circle of indistinctness, blur circle, or blur spot.

In photography, the circle of confusion is used to determine the depth of field, the part of an image that is acceptably sharp. A standard value of CoC is often associated with each image format, but the most appropriate value depends on visual acuity, viewing conditions, and the amount of enlargement. Usages in context include &quot;maximum permissible circle of confusion&quot;, &quot;circle of confusion diameter limit&quot;, and the &quot;circle of confusion criterion&quot;.

Real lenses do not focus all rays perfectly, so that even at best focus, a point is imaged as a spot rather than a point. The smallest such spot that a lens can produce is often referred to as the circle of least confusion.

==Two uses==
Two important uses of this term and concept need to be distinguished:

In idealized ray optics, where rays are assumed to converge to a point when perfectly focused, the shape of a defocus blur spot from a lens with a circular aperture is a hard-edged circle of light. A more general blur spot has soft edges due to diffraction and aberrations, and may be non-circular due to the aperture shape. Therefore, the diameter concept needs to be carefully defined in order to be meaningful. Suitable definitions often use the concept of encircled energy, the fraction of the total optical energy of the spot that is within the specified diameter. Values of the fraction (e.g., 80%, 90%) vary with application.

==Circle of confusion diameter limit in photography==
In photography, the circle of confusion diameter limit (&quot;CoC limit&quot; or &quot;CoC criterion&quot;) is often defined as the largest blur spot that will still be perceived by the human eye as a point, when viewed on a final image from a standard viewing distance. The CoC limit can be specified on a final image (e.g. a print) or on the original image (on film or image sensor).

With this definition, the CoC limit in the original image (the image on the film or electronic sensor) can be set based on several factors:

The common values for CoC limit may not be applicable if reproduction or viewing conditions differ significantly from those assumed in determining those values. If the original image will be given greater enlargement, or viewed at a closer distance, then a smaller CoC will be required. All three factors above are accommodated with this formula:

For example, to support a final-image resolution equivalent to 5 lp/mm for a 25 cm viewing distance when the anticipated viewing distance is 50 cm and the anticipated enlargement is 8:

Since the final-image size is not usually known at the time of taking a photograph, it is common to assume a standard size such as 25 cm width, along with a conventional final-image CoC of 0.2 mm, which is 1/1250 of the image width. Conventions in terms of the diagonal measure are also commonly used. The DoF computed using these conventions will need to be adjusted if the original image is cropped before enlarging to the final image size, or if the size and viewing assumptions are altered.

For full-frame 35 mm format (24 mm × 36 mm, 43 mm diagonal), a widely used CoC limit is /1500, or 0.029 mm for full-frame 35 mm format, which corresponds to resolving 5 lines per millimeter on a print of 30 cm diagonal. Values of 0.030 mm and 0.033 mm are also common for full-frame 35 mm format.

Criteria relating CoC to the lens focal length have also been used. Kodak recommended 2 minutes of arc (the Snellen criterion of 30 cycles/degree for normal vision) for critical viewing, yielding a CoC of about /1720, where is the lens focal length. For a 50 mm lens on full-frame 35 mm format, the corresponding CoC is 0.0291 mm. This criterion evidently assumed that a final image would be viewed at perspective-correct distance (i.e., the angle of view would be the same as that of the original image):

However, images seldom are viewed at the so-called &#x27;correct&#x27; distance; the viewer usually does not know the focal length of the taking lens, and the &quot;correct&quot; distance may be uncomfortably short or long. Consequently, criteria based on lens focal length have generally given way to criteria (such as /1500) related to the camera format.

If an image is viewed on a low-resolution display medium such as a computer monitor, the detectability of blur will be limited by the display medium rather than by human vision. For example, the optical blur will be more difficult to detect in an 8 in × 10 in image displayed on a computer monitor than in an 8×10 print of the same original image viewed at the same distance. If the image is to be viewed only on a low-resolution device, a larger CoC may be appropriate; however, if the image may also be viewed in a high-resolution medium such as a print, the criteria discussed above will govern.

Depth of field formulas derived from geometrical optics imply that any arbitrary DoF can be achieved by using a sufficiently small CoC. Because of diffraction, however, this is not quite true. Using a smaller CoC requires increasing the lens f-number to achieve the same DoF, and if the lens is stopped down sufficiently far, the reduction in defocus blur is offset by the increased blur from diffraction. See the Depth of field article for a more detailed discussion.

===Circle of confusion diameter limit based on &quot;d&quot;/1500===
===Adjusting the circle of confusion diameter for a lens&#x27;s DoF scale===
The f-number determined from a lens DoF scale can be adjusted to reflect a CoC different from the one on which the DoF scale is based. It is shown in the Depth of field article that

formula_1

where is the lens f-number, is the CoC, is the magnification, and is the lens focal length. Because the f-number and CoC occur only as the product , an increase in one is equivalent to a corresponding decrease in the other. For example, if it is known that a lens DoF scale is based on a CoC of 0.035 mm, and the actual conditions require a CoC of 0.025 mm, the CoC must be decreased by a factor of ; this can be accomplished by increasing the f-number determined from the DoF scale by the same factor, or about 1 stop, so the lens can simply be closed down 1 stop from the value indicated on the scale.

The same approach can usually be used with a DoF calculator on a view camera.

===Determining a circle of confusion diameter from the object field===

To calculate the diameter of the circle of confusion in the image plane for an out-of-focus subject, one method is to first calculate the diameter of the blur circle in a virtual image in the object plane, which is simply done using similar triangles, and then multiply by the magnification of the system, which is calculated with the help of the lens equation.

The blur circle, of diameter , in the focused object plane at distance , is an unfocused virtual image of the object at distance as shown in the diagram. It depends only on these distances and the aperture diameter , via similar triangles, independent of the lens focal length:

formula_2

The circle of confusion in the image plane is obtained by multiplying by magnification :

formula_3

where the magnification is given by the ratio of focus distances:

formula_4

Using the lens equation we can solve for the auxiliary variable :

formula_5

which yields

formula_6

and express the magnification in terms of focused distance and focal length:

formula_7

which gives the final result:

formula_8

This can optionally be expressed in terms of the f-number as:

formula_9

This formula is exact for a simple paraxial thin lens or a symmetrical lens, in which the entrance pupil and exit pupil are both of diameter . More complex lens designs with a non-unity pupil magnification will need a more complex analysis, as addressed in depth of field.

More generally, this approach leads to an exact paraxial result for all optical systems if is the entrance pupil diameter, the subject distances are measured from the entrance pupil, and the magnification is known:

formula_10

If either the focus distance or the out-of-focus subject distance is infinite, the equations can be evaluated in the limit. For infinite focus distance:

formula_11

And for the blur circle of an object at infinity when the focus distance is finite:

formula_12

If the value is fixed as a circle of confusion diameter limit, either of these can be solved for subject distance to get the hyperfocal distance, with approximately equivalent results.

==History==

===Henry Coddington 1829===
Before it was applied to photography, the concept of circle of confusion was applied to optical instruments such as telescopes. quantifies both a &quot;circle of least confusion&quot; and a &quot;least circle of confusion&quot; for a spherical reflecting surface.

===Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge 1832===
The applied it to third-order aberrations:

===T.H. 1866===
Circle-of-confusion calculations: An early precursor to depth of field calculations is the calculation of a circle-of-confusion diameter from a subject distance, for a lens focused at infinity; this article was pointed out by . The formula he comes up with for what he terms &quot;the indistinctness&quot; is equivalent, in modern terms, to

formula_13

for focal length , aperture diameter , and subject distance . But he does not invert this to find the corresponding to a given criterion (i.e. he does not solve for the hyperfocal distance), nor does he consider focusing at any other distance than infinity.

He finally observes &quot;long-focus lenses have usually a larger aperture than short ones, and &quot;on this account&quot; have less depth of focus&quot; [his italic emphasis].

===Dallmeyer and Abney===
, in an expanded re-publication of his father John Henry Dallmeyer&#x27;s 1874 pamphlet &quot;On the Choice and Use of Photographic Lenses&quot; (in material that is not in the 1874 edition and appears to have been added from a paper by J.H.D. &quot;On the Use of Diaphragms or Stops&quot; of unknown date), says:

This latter statement is clearly incorrect, or misstated, being off by a factor of focal distance (focal length). He goes on:

Numerically, 1/100 inch at 12–15 inches is closer to two minutes of arc. This choice of CoC limit remains (for a large print) the most widely used even today. takes a similar approach based on a visual acuity of one minute of arc, and chooses a circle of confusion of 0.025 cm for viewing at 40–50 cm, essentially making the same factor-of-two error in metric units. It is unclear whether Abney or Dallmeyer was earlier to set the CoC standard thereby.

===Wall 1889===
The common 1/100 inch CoC limit has been applied to blur other than defocus blur. For example, says:

<doc id="168432" wikidata="Q215530" url="?curid=168432" title="Kingdom of Ireland">
<text>The Kingdom of Ireland (; , ) was a dependent territory of England and then of Great Britain from 1542 to the end of 1800. It was ruled by the monarchs of England and then of Great Britain, and was administered from Dublin Castle by a viceroy appointed by the English king: the Lord Deputy of Ireland. Aside from brief periods, the state was dominated by the Protestant English (or Anglo-Irish) minority. The Protestant Church of Ireland was the state church. The Parliament of Ireland was composed of Anglo-Irish nobles. From 1661, the administration controlled an Irish army. Although styled a kingdom, for most of its history it was, &quot;de facto&quot;, an English dependency. This status was enshrined in Poynings&#x27; Law and in the Declaratory Act 1719.

The territory of the kingdom comprised that of the former Lordship of Ireland, founded in 1177 by King Henry II of England and the English Pope Adrian IV, after the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. By the 16th century, the Pale, the area of effective English rule, had shrunk greatly; most of Ireland was held by Gaelic nobles as principalities and chiefdoms. By the terms of the Crown of Ireland Act 1542, Henry VIII of England became &quot;King of Ireland&quot;. There followed an expansion of English control during the Tudor conquest. This sparked the Desmond Rebellions and the Nine Years&#x27; War. The conquest of the island was completed early in the 17th century. It involved the confiscation of land from the native Irish Catholics and its colonisation by Protestant settlers from Britain. Catholic countries at the time did not recognise Protestant monarchs as kings of Ireland.

For most of the kingdom&#x27;s history, the Irish Catholic majority suffered official discrimination: under the penal laws, Catholicism was suppressed and Catholics were barred from government, parliament, the military, and most public offices. This was one of the main drivers behind the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–53), during which the Irish Catholic Confederates controlled most of Ireland. After the Cromwellian conquest, Ireland suffered harsh conditions under The Protectorate (1653–59). The brief reign of Catholic king James II (1685–89) led to the Williamite War (1689–91). The Williamite victory strengthened the Protestant Ascendancy, and the kingdom had only Protestant monarchs thereafter.

In the 1780s, the parliament gained some independence, and some anti-Catholic laws were lifted. This sparked sectarian conflict in County Armagh. Following the failed republican Irish Rebellion of 1798, the parliament of Ireland and parliament of Great Britain passed the Acts of Union 1800. This created, on 1 January 1801, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

==History==
===Background===

The papal bull &quot;Laudabiliter&quot; of Pope Adrian IV was issued in 1155. It authorized the Angevin King Henry II of England to invade Ireland, to bring the country into the European sphere. In return, Henry was required to remit a penny per hearth of the tax roll to the Pope. This was reconfirmed by Adrian&#x27;s successor Pope Alexander III in 1172. Henry then made his son John &quot;Dominus Hibernae&quot; (Latin for &quot;Lord of Ireland&quot;) with the intent on later making John King of Ireland.

When Pope Clement VII excommunicated the king of England, Henry VIII, in 1533, the constitutional position of the lordship in Ireland became uncertain. Henry had broken away from the Holy See and declared himself the head of the Church in England. He had petitioned Rome to procure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Clement VII refused Henry&#x27;s request and Henry subsequently refused to recognise the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s vestigial sovereignty over Ireland, and was excommunicated again in late 1538 by Pope Paul III. The Treason Act (Ireland) 1537 was passed to counteract this.

===Tudor Ireland===

Following the failed revolt of Silken Thomas in 1534–35, Grey, the lord deputy, had some military successes against several clans in the late 1530s, and took their submissions. By 1540 most of Ireland seemed at peace and under the control of the king&#x27;s Dublin administration; a situation that was not to last for long.

In 1542, the Kingdom of Ireland was established by the Parliament of Ireland through the Crown of Ireland Act. This act declared King Henry VIII of England as the King of Ireland, thus creating a separate political entity known as the Kingdom of Ireland. The act marked a significant shift in Ireland&#x27;s political landscape, as it sought to consolidate English control over the island and bring it under closer royal governance. The Kingdom of Ireland existed alongside the Lordship of Ireland, which was held by the English monarchs prior to the establishment of the kingdom. The new kingdom was not recognised by the Catholic monarchies in Europe. After the death of Edward VI, Henry&#x27;s son, the papal bull of 1555 recognised the Roman Catholic Mary I as Queen of Ireland. The link of &quot;personal union&quot; of the Crown of Ireland to the Crown of England became enshrined in Catholic canon law. In this fashion, the Kingdom of Ireland was ruled by the reigning monarch of England. This placed the new Kingdom of Ireland in personal union with the Kingdom of England.

In line with its expanded role and self-image, the administration established the King&#x27;s Inns for barristers in 1541, and the Ulster King of Arms to regulate heraldry in 1552. Proposals to establish a university in Dublin were delayed until 1592.

In 1593 war broke out, as Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, led a confederation of Irish lords and Spain against the crown, in what later became known as the Nine Years&#x27; War. A series of stunning Irish victories brought English power in Ireland to the point of collapse by the beginning of 1600, but a renewed campaign under Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy forced Tyrone to submit in 1603, completing the Tudor conquest of Ireland.

===Stuart Ireland===

In 1603 James VI King of Scots became James I of England and Ireland, uniting the Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland in a personal union. James established the Plantation of Ulster in 1606, the largest of all English and Scottish plantations in Ireland. It had a lasting legacy; into the 20th century, most of Ulster had a Protestant and Pro-Union majority in its population.

The political order of the kingdom was interrupted by the Wars of the Three Kingdoms starting in 1639. During the subsequent interregnum period, England, Scotland and Ireland were ruled as a republic until 1660. This period saw the rise of the loyalist Irish Catholic Confederation within the kingdom and, from 1653, the creation of the republican Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland. The kingdom&#x27;s order was restored 1660 with the restoration of Charles II. Without any public dissent, Charles&#x27;s reign was backdated to his father&#x27;s execution in 1649.

===Grattan&#x27;s Patriots===
Poynings&#x27; Law was repealed in 1782 in what came to be known as the Constitution of 1782, granting Ireland legislative independence. Parliament in this period came to be known as Grattan&#x27;s Parliament, after the principal Irish leader of the period, Henry Grattan. Although Ireland had legislative independence, executive administration remained under the control of the executive of the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1788–1789 a Regency crisis arose when King George III became ill. Grattan wanted to appoint the Prince of Wales, later George IV, as Regent of Ireland. The king recovered before this could be enacted.

===United Irishmen===
The Irish Rebellion of 1798, and the rebels&#x27; alliance with Great Britain&#x27;s longtime enemy the French, led to a push to bring Ireland formally into the British Union. By the Acts of Union 1800, voted for by both Irish and British Parliaments, the Kingdom of Ireland merged on 1 January 1801 with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Irish Parliament ceased to exist, though the executive, presided over by the Lord Lieutenant, remained in place until 1922.

==Viceroy==

The Kingdom of Ireland was governed by a &quot;Lord Deputy&quot; or viceroy. The post was held by senior nobles such as Thomas Radcliffe. From 1688 the title was usually &quot;Lord Lieutenant&quot;.
In the absence of a Lord Deputy, lords justices ruled.
While some Irishmen held the post, most of the lords deputy were English noblemen. While the viceroy controlled the Irish administration as the monarch&#x27;s representative, in the eighteenth century the political post of Chief Secretary for Ireland became increasingly powerful.

==Parliament==

The kingdom&#x27;s legislature was bicameral with a House of Lords and a House of Commons. By the terms of Poynings&#x27; Law (1494) and other acts, the parliament&#x27;s powers were greatly circumscribed. The legislature was content to &quot;rubber stamp&quot; acts or &quot;suggestions&quot; from the English parliament.

Roman Catholics and dissenters, mostly Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists, were excluded from membership of the Irish parliament from 1693. Furthermore, their rights were restricted by a series of laws called the Penal Laws. They were denied voting rights from 1728 until 1793. The Grattan Parliament succeeded in achieving the repeal of Poynings&#x27; Law in 1782. This allowed progressive legislation and gradual liberalisation was effected. Catholics and Dissenters were given the right to vote in 1793, but Catholics were still excluded from the Irish Parliament and senior public offices in the kingdom. As in Great Britain and the rest of Europe, voting and membership of parliament was restricted to property owners. In the 1720s, the parliament was housed in a new building at College Green, Dublin.

==Army==

The Kingdom maintained a standing force, the Irish Army (1661–1801), it was for much of its existence the largest force available to the British Crown, being substantially larger than the English Army and Scots Army.

The modern Irish Army does not trace its lineage to the army of the Kingdom of Ireland.

==Church of Ireland==


When Henry VIII was excommunicated by the Catholic Church in 1538, all but two of the bishops in the island of Ireland followed the doctrine of the Church of England, although almost no clergy or laity did so. Having paid their &quot;Annates&quot; to the Papacy, the bishops had no reason to step down, and in the 1530s nobody knew how long the reformation would last. Unlike Henry VIII, this hierarchy was not excommunicated by the Papacy. They retained control of what became the State Church of the new Kingdom in 1542. As the established church, it retained possession of most Church property (including a great repository of religious architecture and other items, though some were later destroyed). In 1553, Irish Catholics were heartened by the coronation of Queen Mary I. In 1555, she persuaded the Pope to recognise the Kingdom in the papal bull &quot;Ilius&quot;.

In 1558, a Protestant – Elizabeth I – ascended the throne. With the exception of James II of England, all the following monarchs adhered to Anglicanism. Contrary to the official plan, the substantial majority of the population remained strongly Roman Catholic, despite the political and economic advantages of membership of the state church. Despite its numerical minority, however, the Church of Ireland remained the official state church until it was disestablished on 1 January 1871 by the Liberal government under William Ewart Gladstone.

==Ethnic conflict==

The legacy of the Kingdom of Ireland remains a bone of contention in Irish-British relations to this day because of the constant ethnic conflict between the native Irish inhabitants and primarily the new Anglo-Irish settlers across the island. Their background espoused English culture (law, language, dress, religion, economic relations and definitions of land ownership) in Ireland as it later did across much of what was to become the British Empire. However Gaelic culture and Irish language, was maintained to a significant extent by the majority of the original native population. Sometimes this was presented as &quot;barbaric&quot;, &quot;savage&quot; which later was perceived by the native population as a mark of undesirability in respect of maintaining and learning the language. While the Lordship of Ireland had existed since the 12th century and nominally owed allegiance to the English monarchy, many kingdoms of Gaelic Ireland continued to exist; this came to an end with the Kingdom of Ireland, where the whole island was brought under the centralised control of an Anglo-centric system based in Dublin. This phase of Irish history marked the beginning of an officially organised policy of settler colonialism, orchestrated from London and the incorporation of Ireland into the British Empire (indeed Ireland is sometimes called &quot;England&#x27;s first colony&quot;). The theme is prominently addressed in Irish postcolonial literature.

The religion of the native majority and its clergy – the Catholic Church – was actively persecuted by the state. A set of Penal Laws favoured those who adhered to the established church – the Church of Ireland. They oppressed those native Irish who refused to abjure their religion. A similar experience happened to English, Scottish and Welsh Catholics during the same period. There is some perception that during Tudor times, elements within the government at times engaged in and advanced a genocidal policy against the Irish Gaels, while during the Plantations of Ireland (particularly successful in Ulster) the local population were displaced in a project of ethnic cleansing where regions of Ireland became de-Gaelicised. This in turn led to bloody retaliations, which drag on to modern times. Some of the native inhabitants, including their leadership, were permitted to flee into exile from the country following ending up on the losing side in conflicts (i.e. the Flight of the Earls and the Flight of the Wild Geese) or in the case of the Cromwellian regime were forced into indentured servitude (although the same happened to English persons involved in the Cromwellian regime) in the Caribbean, following mass land confiscation for the benefit of New English settlers.

On the other hand, the fact that the kingdom had been a unitary state gave Irish nationalists in 1912–22 a reason to expect that in the process of increasing self-government the island of Ireland would be treated as a single political unit.

==Coat of arms==
The arms of the Kingdom of Ireland were blazoned: &quot;Azure, a harp Or stringed Argent&quot;. These earliest arms of Ireland are described in an entry that reads: &quot;Le Roi d&#x27;Irlande, D&#x27;azur à la harpe d&#x27;or&quot;, in a 13th-century French roll of arms, the Armorial Wijnbergen, also known as the Wijnbergen Roll, said to be preserved in The Hague, in the Netherlands but currently untraced; a copy is held in the Royal Library of Belgium (Collection Goethals, ms. 2569). This may have been an aspirational depiction for a putative High-King, for it was not related to the Lordship of Ireland at that time by the English king, who only assumed the title &quot;King of Ireland&quot; later in the reign of Henry VIII

A crown was not part of the arms but use of a crowned harp was apparently common as a badge or as a device. A crowned harp also appeared as a crest although the delineated crest was: &quot;a wreath Or and Azure, a tower (sometime triple-towered) Or, from the port, a hart springing Argent&quot;.

<text>A light meter (or illuminometer) is a device used to measure the amount of light. In photography, an exposure meter is a light meter coupled to either a digital or analog calculator which displays the correct shutter speed and f-number for optimum exposure, given a certain lighting situation and film speed. Similarly, exposure meters are also used in the fields of cinematography and scenic design, in order to determine the optimum light level for a scene.

Light meters also are used in the general field of architectural lighting design to verify proper installation and performance of a building lighting system, and in assessing the light levels for growing plants.

If a light meter is giving its indications in luxes, it is called a &quot;luxmeter&quot;.

== Evolution ==
===Actinometers===

The earliest exposure meters were called &quot;actinometers&quot; (not to be confused with the scientific instrument with the same name), described as early as 1840 but developed in the late 1800s after commercial photographic plates became available with consistent sensitivity. These photographic actinometers used light-sensitive paper; the photographer would measure the time required for the paper to darken to a control value, providing an input to a mechanical calculation of shutter speed and aperture for a given plate number. They were popular between approximately 1890 and 1920.

===Extinction types===

The next exposure meters, developed at about the same time but not displacing actinometers in popularity until the 1920s and 1930s, are known as &quot;extinction meters&quot;, evaluating the correct exposure settings by variable attenuation. One type of extinction meter contained a numbered or lettered row of neutral density filters of increasing density. The photographer would position the meter in front of their subject and note the filter with the greatest density that still allowed incident light to pass through. In another example, sold as Heyde&#x27;s Aktino-Photometer starting from the early 1900s, the photographer views the scene through an eyepiece and turns the meter to vary the effective density until the scene can no longer be seen. The letter or number corresponding to the filter strength causing the &quot;extinction&quot; of the scene was used as an index into a chart of appropriate aperture and shutter speed combinations for a given film speed.

Extinction meters tended to provide inconsistent results because they depended on subjective interpretation and the light sensitivity of the human eye, which can vary from person to person.

===Photoelectric types===

Starting in 1932, electronic light meters removed the human element and relied on technologies incorporating (in chronological order) selenium, CdS (1960s), and silicon (semiconductor, 1970s) photodetectors. Most modern light meters use silicon sensors. They indicate the exposure either with a needle galvanometer or on an LCD screen.

Selenium light meters use sensors that are photovoltaic: they &quot;generate&quot; a voltage proportional to light exposure. Selenium sensors generate enough voltage for direct connection to a meter; they need no battery to operate and this made them very convenient in completely mechanical cameras. Selenium sensors however cannot measure low light accurately (ordinary lightbulbs can take them close to their limits) and are altogether unable to measure very low light, such as candlelight, moonlight, starlight etc.

CdS light meters use a photoresistor sensor whose electrical resistance decreases proportionately to the intensity of light exposure. These require a battery to operate, but are significantly more sensitive to low light, able to detect lighting levels approximately of the lower sensitivity limit of selenium cells. However, CdS sensors fell out of favor due to their slower response and extended sensitivity to red and infrared wavelengths.

Semiconductor sensors are also photovoltaic, but the voltage generated is much weaker than selenium cells and semiconductor-based light meters need an amplification circuit and therefore require a power source such as batteries to operate. These are usually named after the materials and filtration used to ensure the spectral response is similar to the human eye or photographic film, such as &#x27;Silicon Blue Cell&#x27; (SBC) or &quot;.
Many modern consumer still and video cameras include a built-in meter that measures a scene-wide light level and are able to make an approximate measure of appropriate exposure based on that. Photographers working with controlled lighting and cinematographers use handheld light meters to precisely measure the light falling on various parts of their subjects and use suitable lighting to produce the desired exposure levels.

===Reflected and incident measurements===
Exposure meters generally are sorted into reflected-light or incident-light types, depending on the method used to measure the scene.

Reflected-light meters measure the light &quot;reflected by the scene&quot; to be photographed. All in-camera meters are reflected-light meters. Reflected-light meters are calibrated to show the appropriate exposure for &quot;average&quot; scenes. An unusual scene with a preponderance of light colors or specular highlights would have a higher reflectance; a reflected-light meter taking a reading would incorrectly compensate for the difference in reflectance and lead to underexposure. Badly underexposed sunset photos are common exactly because of this effect: the brightness of the setting sun fools the camera&#x27;s light meter and, unless the in-camera logic or the photographer take care to compensate, the picture will be grossly underexposed and dull.
This pitfall (but not in the setting-sun case) is avoided by incident-light meters which measure the amount of light &quot;falling on the subject&quot; using a diffuser with a flat or (more commonly) hemispherical field of view placed on top of the light sensor. Because the incident-light reading is independent of the subject&#x27;s reflectance, it is less likely to lead to incorrect exposures for subjects with unusual average reflectance. Taking an incident-light reading requires placing the meter at the subject&#x27;s position and pointing it in the general direction of the camera, something not always achievable in practice, e.g., in landscape photography where the subject distance approaches infinity.
Another way to avoid under- or over-exposure for subjects with unusual reflectance is to use a spot meter: a specialized reflected-light meter that measures light in a very tight cone, typically with a one degree circular angle of view. An experienced photographer can take multiple readings over the shadows, midrange, and highlights of the scene to determine optimal exposure, using systems like the Zone System.

Many modern cameras include sophisticated multi-segment metering systems that measure the luminance of different parts of the scene to determine the optimal exposure. When using a film whose spectral sensitivity is not a good match to that of the light meter, for example orthochromatic black-and-white or infrared film, the meter may require special filters and re-calibration to match the sensitivity of the film.
There are other types of specialized photographic light meters. Flash meters are used in flash photography to verify correct exposure. Color meters are used where high fidelity in color reproduction is required. Densitometers are used in photographic reproduction.

==Exposure meter calibration==

In most cases, an incident-light meter will cause a medium tone to be recorded as a medium tone, and a reflected-light meter will cause &quot;whatever is metered&quot; to be recorded as a medium tone. What constitutes a &quot;medium tone&quot; depends on meter calibration and several other factors, including film processing or digital image conversion.

Meter calibration establishes the relationship between subject lighting and recommended camera settings. The calibration of photographic light meters is covered by ISO 2720:1974.

===Exposure equations===

For reflected-light meters, camera settings are related to ISO speed and subject luminance by the reflected-light exposure equation:

formula_1

where

* formula_2 is the relative aperture (f-number)
* formula_3 is the exposure time (&quot;shutter speed&quot;) in seconds
* formula_4 is the average scene luminance
* formula_5 is the ISO arithmetic speed
* formula_6 is the reflected-light meter calibration constant

For incident-light meters, camera settings are related to ISO speed and subject illuminance by the incident-light exposure equation:

:formula_7

where

* formula_8 is the illuminance
* formula_9 is the incident-light meter calibration constant

===Calibration constants===

Determination of calibration constants has been largely subjective; ISO 2720:1974 states that
The constants formula_6 and formula_9 shall be chosen by statistical analysis of the results of a large number of tests carried out to determine the acceptability to a large number of observers, of a number
of photographs, for which the exposure was known, obtained under various conditions of subject manner and over a range of luminances.
In practice, the variation of the calibration constants among manufacturers is considerably less than this statement might imply, and values have changed little since the early 1970s.

ISO 2720:1974 recommends a range for formula_6 of 10.6 to 13.4 with
luminance in cd/m2. Two values for formula_6 are in common use: 12.5 (Canon, Nikon, and
Sekonic) and 14 (Minolta, Kenko, and Pentax); the difference between the two values is approximately EV.

The earliest calibration standards were developed for use with wide-angle averaging reflected-light meters
(Jones and Condit 1941). Although wide-angle average metering has largely given way to other metering sensitivity patterns (e.g., spot, center-weighted, and multi-segment), the values for formula_6 determined for wide-angle averaging meters have remained.

The incident-light calibration constant depends on the type of light receptor. Two receptor types are common: flat (cosine-responding) and hemispherical (cardioid-responding). With a flat receptor, ISO 2720:1974 recommends a range for formula_9 of 240 to 400 with illuminance in lux; a value of 250 is commonly used. A flat receptor typically is used for measurement of lighting ratios, for measurement of illuminance, and occasionally, for determining exposure for a flat subject.

For determining practical photographic exposure, a hemispherical receptor has proven more effective. Don Norwood, inventor of incident-light exposure meter with a hemispherical receptor, thought that a sphere was a reasonable representation of a photographic subject. According to his patent (Norwood 1938), the objective was
to provide an exposure meter which is substantially uniformly responsive to light incident upon the photographic subject from practically all directions which would result in the reflection of light to the camera or other photographic register.
and the meter provided for &quot;measurement of the effective illumination obtaining at the position of the subject.&quot;

With a hemispherical receptor, ISO 2720:1974 recommends a range for formula_9 of 320 to 540 with illuminance in lux; in practice, values typically are between 320 (Minolta) and 340 (Sekonic). The relative responses of flat and hemispherical receptors depend upon the number and type of light sources; when each receptor is pointed at a small light source, a hemispherical receptor with formula_9 = 330 will indicate an exposure approximately 0.40 step greater than that indicated by a flat receptor with formula_9 = 250. With a slightly revised definition of illuminance, measurements with a hemispherical receptor indicate &quot;effective scene illuminance.&quot;

===Calibrated reflectance===

It is commonly stated that reflected-light meters are calibrated to an 18% reflectance, but the calibration has nothing to do with reflectance, as should be evident from the exposure formulas. However, some notion of reflectance is implied by a comparison of incident- and reflected-light meter calibration.

Combining the reflected-light and incident-light exposure equations and rearranging gives

:formula_19

Reflectance formula_20 is defined as

:formula_21

A uniform perfect diffuser (one following Lambert&#x27;s cosine law) of luminance formula_4 emits a flux density of formula_23formula_4; reflectance then is

:formula_25

Illuminance is measured with a flat receptor. It is straightforward to compare an incident-light measurement using a flat receptor with a reflected-light measurement of a uniformly illuminated flat surface of constant reflectance. Using values of 12.5 for formula_6 and 250 for formula_9 gives

:formula_28

With a formula_6 of 14, the reflectance would be 17.6%, close to that of a standard 18% neutral test card. In theory, an incident-light measurement should agree with a reflected-light measurement of a test card of suitable reflectance that is perpendicular to the direction to the meter. However, a test card seldom is a uniform diffuser, so incident- and reflected-light measurements might differ slightly.

In a typical scene, many elements are not flat and are at various orientations to the camera, so that for practical photography, a hemispherical receptor usually has proven more effective for determining exposure. Using values of 12.5 for formula_6 and 330 for formula_9 gives

:formula_32

With a slightly revised definition of reflectance, this result can be taken as indicating that the average scene reflectance is approximately 12%. A typical scene includes shaded areas as well as areas that receive direct illumination, and a wide-angle averaging reflected-light meter responds to these differences in illumination as well as differing reflectances of various scene elements. Average scene reflectance then would be

:formula_33

where &quot;effective scene illuminance&quot; is that measured by a meter with a hemispherical receptor.

ISO 2720:1974 calls for reflected-light calibration to be measured by aiming the receptor at a transilluminated diffuse surface, and for incident-light calibration to be measured by aiming the receptor at a point source in a darkened room. For a perfectly diffusing test card and perfectly diffusing flat receptor, the comparison between a reflected-light measurement and an incident-light measurement is valid for any position of the light source. However, the response of a hemispherical receptor to an off-axis light source is approximately that of a cardioid rather than a cosine, so the 12% &quot;reflectance&quot; determined for an incident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor is valid only when the light source is on the receptor axis.

===Cameras with internal meters===

Calibration of cameras with internal meters is covered by ISO 2721:1982; nonetheless, many manufacturers specify (though seldom state) exposure calibration in terms of formula_6, and many calibration instruments (e.g., Kyoritsu-Arrowin multi-function camera testers ) use the specified formula_6 to set the test parameters.

==Exposure determination with a neutral test card==

If a scene differs considerably from a statistically average scene, a wide-angle averaging reflected-light measurement may not indicate the correct exposure. To simulate an average scene, a substitute measurement sometimes is made of a neutral test card, or &quot;gray card&quot;.

At best, a flat card is an approximation to a three-dimensional scene, and measurement of a test card may lead to underexposure unless adjustment is made. The instructions for a Kodak neutral test card recommend that the indicated exposure be increased by step for a frontlighted scene in sunlight. The instructions also recommend that the test card be held vertically and faced in a direction midway between the Sun and the camera; similar directions are also given in the &quot;Kodak Professional Photoguide&quot;. The combination of exposure increase and the card orientation gives recommended exposures that are reasonably close to those given by an incident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor when metering with an off-axis light source.

In practice, additional complications may arise. Many neutral test cards are far from perfectly diffuse reflectors, and specular reflections can cause increased reflected-light meter readings that, if followed, would result in underexposure. It is possible that the neutral test card instructions include a correction for specular reflections.

==Use in illumination==

Light meters or light detectors are also used in illumination. Their purpose is to measure the illumination level in the interior and to switch off or reduce the output level of luminaires. This can greatly reduce the energy burden of the building by significantly increasing the efficiency of its lighting system. It is therefore recommended to use light meters in lighting systems, especially in rooms where one cannot expect users to pay attention to manually switching off the lights. Examples include hallways, stairs, and big halls.

There are, however, significant obstacles to overcome in order to achieve a successful implementation of light meters in lighting systems, of which user acceptance is by far the most formidable. Unexpected or too frequent switching and too bright or too dark rooms are very annoying and disturbing for users of the rooms. Therefore, different switching algorithms have been developed:
*difference algorithm, where lights are switched on at a lower light level than they switch off, thus taking ensuring the difference between the light level of the &#x27;on&#x27; state and &#x27;off&#x27; state is not too big
*time delay algorithms:
**a certain amount of time must pass since the last switch
**a certain amount of time at a sufficient illumination level must pass.

== Other uses ==

In Scientific Research &amp; Development uses, a light meter consists of a radiometer (the electronics/readout), a photo-diode or sensor (generates an output when exposed to electromagnetic radiation/light) a filter (used to modify the incoming light so only the desired portion of incoming radiation reaches the sensor) and a cosine correcting input optic (assures the sensor can see the light coming in from all directions accurately).

When the word light meter or photometer is used in place of radiometer or optometer, or it is often assumed the system was configured to see only visible light. Visible light sensors are often called illuminance or photometric sensors because they have been filtered to be sensitive only to 400-700 nanometers (nm) mimicking the human eyes&#x27; sensitivity to light. How accurately the meter measures often depends on how well the filtration matches the human eyes&#x27; response.

The sensor will send a signal to the meter that is proportional to the amount of light that reaches the sensor after being collected by the optics and passing through the filter. The meter then converts the incoming signal (typically current or voltage) from the sensor into a reading of calibrated units such as Foot-Candles (fc) or Lux (lm/m^2). Calibration in fc or lux, is the second most important feature of a light meter. It not only converts the signal from V or mA, but it also provides accuracy and unit to unit repeatability. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceability and ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation are two well known terms that verify the system includes a valid calibration.

The meter/radiometer/photometer portion may have many features including:

Zero: subtracts ambient/background light levels, or stabilize the meter to the working environment

Hold: freezes the value on the display.

Range: for systems that are not linear and auto ranging this function allows the user to select the portion of the meter electronics that best handles the signal level in use.

Units: For illuminance the units are typically only lux and foot-candles but many light meters can also be used for UV, VIS and IR applications so the readout could change to W/cm^2, candela, Watts etc.

Integrate: sums up the values into a dose or exposure level i.e. lux*sec or J/cm^2.

Along with having a variety of features, a light meter may also be usable for a variety of applications. These may include the measurement of other bands of light such UVA, UVB, UVC and Near IR. For example, UVA and UVB light meters are used for phototherapy or treatment of skin conditions, germicidal radiometers are used for measuring the UVC level from lamps used for disinfection and sterilization, luminance meters are used to measure the brightness of a sign, display or exit sign, PAR quantum sensors are used to measure how much of a given light source&#x27;s emission will help plants grow, and UV-curing radiometers test how much of the lights emission is effective for hardening a glue, plastic, or protective coating.
Some light meters also have the ability to provide a readout in many different units. Lux and footcandles are the common units for visible light, but so are Candelas, Lumens, and Candela per square meter. In the realm of disinfection, UVC is typically measured in watts per square centimeter, or watts for a given individual lamp assembly, whereas systems used in the context of the curing of coatings often provide readouts in Joules per Square centimeter. Regular measurements of UVC light intensity thus can serve to provide assurance of proper disinfection of water and food-preparation surfaces, or reliable coating hardness in painted products.
Although a light meter can take the form of a very simple handheld tool with one-button operation, there are also many advanced light-measurement systems available for use in numerous different applications. These can be incorporated into automated systems that can, for example, wipe lamps clean when a certain reduction in output is detected, or that can trigger an alarm when lamp-failure occurs.

<doc id="168436" wikidata="Q7245301" url="?curid=168436" title="Printer point">
<text>In photography, a printer point is a unit of relative exposure, in printing a negative, equal to a 1/12 of a stop or 0.025 Log(base 10) unit (one-fortieth of a decade) of exposure ratio.

This numbering scheme is used in photographic printing and photographic filters. Printer points were also used to specify color timing for photochemical film processing, particularly for motion pictures shot on film.

Increasing or decreasing the light by twelve points increases or decreases the exposure by a factor of two. Such adjustments are used for darkness and color adjustment in photographic enlargers, for example. A one-stop change in the exposure of a negative may require only an adjustment of about 6 to 8 printer points in printing, depending on the gamma of the film.

<doc id="168438" wikidata="Q232193" url="?curid=168438" title="Joan Osborne">
<text>Joan Elizabeth Osborne (born July 8, 1962) is an American singer, songwriter, and interpreter of music, having recorded and performed in various popular American musical genres including rock, pop, soul, R&amp;B, blues, and country. She is best known for her recording of the Eric Bazilian-penned song &quot;One of Us&quot; from her debut album, &quot;Relish&quot; (1995). Both the single and the album became worldwide hits and garnered a combined seven Grammy Award nominations. Osborne has toured with Motown sidemen the Funk Brothers and was featured in the documentary film about them, &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot; (2002).

==Career==
Originally from Anchorage, Kentucky, a suburb of Louisville, Osborne moved to New York City in the late 1980s to study filmmaking at New York University, where she had classes with legendary documentarian George Stoney, among others. Osborne was paying her own way through college and taking time off to earn money for another semester when, by chance, she sang at an open mic night at the Abilene Café. The other musicians encouraged her to return, and she began singing weekly at the Abilene&#x27;s open mic and at other blues open mics in NYC&#x27;s East Village. She soon became immersed in NYC&#x27;s live music scene, forming her own band and playing in nightclubs alongside groups like the Sweetones, Surreal McCoys, Spin Doctors, Blues Traveler, and the Holmes Brothers, and artists like Chris Whitley, Frankie Paris, and Jeff Buckley.

In 1991, she formed her own record label, Womanly Hips, to release her first full-length album, &quot;Soul Show: Live at Delta 88&quot;, and she began to tour around the Northeast, building a devoted regional following. She signed a recording contract with Rick Chertoff of Mercury Records, and released her second (and first major label) album &quot;Relish&quot; (1995), which became a hit on the strength of the single &quot;One of Us&quot;. &quot;Right Hand Man&quot; and &quot;St. Teresa&quot; were minor hits, and &quot;Spider Web&quot; also received radio play. Osborne wrote and directed the second music video for &quot;St. Teresa&quot;.

Osborne was a co-headliner for the Lilith Fair in 1997.

In 2001, Osborne produced an album for her friends the Holmes Brothers, &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;, engineered by Grammy winner Trina Shoemaker and featuring backing vocals from Catherine Russell, Maydie Miles, and Osborne. The album was released by Alligator Records.

In 2001, Osborne appeared on &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, singing material mainly from &quot;Righteous Love&quot;. In a brief interview segment at the end of the episode, Osborne reflects on her gladness to have gotten out of the limelight of her mid-1990s stardom. She was featured in the 2002 documentary film &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot; and toured with Motown sidemen the Funk Brothers. She and her band accompanied the Dixie Chicks for a national tour in the summer of 2003, during which time she also joined veteran San Francisco jam-rockers The Dead as a vocalist, and released her fourth album, titled &quot;How Sweet It Is&quot;, a collection of classic rock and soul covers.
During 2005 and 2006, Osborne performed on numerous occasions with Phil Lesh and Friends. Her vocals were featured prominently on the album &quot;Live at the Warfield&quot;. She continues to make appearances with the band.

In February 2007, she appeared on the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. In May 2007, she issued &quot;Breakfast in Bed&quot;, produced by Tor Hyams, a return to the soul music that she had covered on &quot;How Sweet It Is&quot;. &quot;Breakfast in Bed&quot; also featured the two songs (&quot;Heatwave&quot; and &quot;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&quot;) that she had covered for the film &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot;. The same year, Osborne appeared as a featured guest in the third season of the &quot;Transatlantic Sessions&quot; television series, performing &quot;Saint Teresa&quot;, &quot;Holy Water&quot;, and &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Tell Me How the Story Ends&quot;.

Osborne sang lead vocals on the cover of the Willie Dixon-penned &quot;Spoonful&quot; on Vivian Campbell&#x27;s 2005 solo album, &quot;Two Sides of If&quot;. She also provided vocals for &quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot; on Spearhead&#x27;s 1997 album, &quot;Chocolate Supa Highway&quot;. She interpreted &quot;Raglan Road&quot; for the Chieftains 1999 album, &quot;Tears of Stone&quot;, and she covered Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Do I Ever Cross Your Mind&quot; on the 2003 tribute album &quot;Just Because I&#x27;m a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton&quot;. She is featured on the Holmes Brothers 2007 collection &quot;State of Grace&quot; performing &quot;Those Memories of You&quot;, an old Alan O&#x27;Bryant bluegrass tune.

Osborne released the studio album &quot;Little Wild One&quot; in September 2008. She performed as a guest vocalist on &quot;Sgt. Pepper Live&quot;, the 2009 album and DVD by Cheap Trick. In 2010, she was awarded the Woman of Achievement Award from Women&#x27;s Project Theater. She performed with The Waybacks at Merlefest, 2011, during the Hillside Album hour, featuring The Allman Brothers&#x27; &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;.

In 2010, Osborne again produced an album for the Holmes Brothers on Alligator Records, &quot;Feed My Soul&quot;, which featured contributions from keyboard player Glenn Patscha.

Her album &quot;Bring It On Home&quot; was released on March 27, 2012. It is a collection of vintage blues and soul covers, and it received a 2013 Grammy Awards nomination for &quot;Best Blues Album&quot;. In September 2012, Osborne was featured in a campaign called &quot;30 Songs / 30 Days&quot; to support &quot;Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide&quot;, a multi-platform media project inspired by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn&#x27;s book.

Osborne was a member of Trigger Hippy, along with Steve Gorman, Tom Bukovac, Jackie Greene, and Nick Govrik. The band released their debut album on September 30, 2014. She announced her departure from the group on her blog in October 2018.

On October 31, 2015, Osborne and Mavis Staples performed in Washington, D.C. at The George Washington University&#x27;s Lisner Auditorium as part of their Solid Soul Tour.

Osborne has a long history of political activism, in particular with Planned Parenthood Federation of America. She began volunteering as a PPFA clinic escort in NYC in the 1980s, has organized benefit concerts for the group, and was honored as a PPFA &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; in 1997 after she promoted Planned Parenthood from the Lilith Fair stage in Houston, TX, despite being expressly forbidden to do so by the arena&#x27;s owners, who then blacklisted her from the venue.

Osborne released the original album &quot;Love and Hate&quot; in 2014 and followed up in 2017 with &quot;Songs of Bob Dylan&quot;, another cover album. In 2020, she published &quot;Trouble and Strife&quot;, and in 2022, she issued the live compilation &quot;Radio Waves&quot;. In 2023, Osborne released the studio album &quot;Nobody Owns You&quot;.

==Personal life==
Originally from Anchorage, Kentucky, a suburb of Louisville, Osborne moved to New York City in the late 1980s. She has stated that she feels an attachment to the city, particularly the borough of Brooklyn. Her interest in the culture, history, and society of her Boerum Hill neighborhood has influenced her music. She has also expressed admiration for American poetry, especially the works of Walt Whitman, cited as a major inspiration for her songwriting.

Raised a Roman Catholic, Osborne distanced herself from that institution after childhood, specifically after telling her parents that she wished to become a priest, only to learn that the Church does not allow women to do so. As an adult, she regards herself as skeptical of large-scale organized religion and identifies as a &quot;spiritual person&quot; influenced by both Buddhism and Christianity.

Osborne has a daughter, born in December 2004.

<doc id="168439" wikidata="Q2748428" url="?curid=168439" title="College Green, Dublin">
<text>College Green () is a three-sided plaza in the centre of Dublin, Ireland. On its northern side is the Bank of Ireland building, which until 1800 was Ireland&#x27;s Parliament House. To its east stands Trinity College Dublin. To its south stands a series of 19th-century buildings.

Streets leading onto College Green are Dame Street to the west, Grafton Street to the south, Westmoreland Street to the north and College Street to the northeast. College Green has been used as an assembly point for major political rallies. In the mid-1990s, United States President Bill Clinton addressed a crowd during his visit to Ireland. President Barack Obama also spoke at the site in a major address during his visit in May 2011.

==Location==
College Green is on Dublin&#x27;s Southside, and is about 170m long. Its western end is a continuation of Dame Street. At its eastern end, facing Trinity College, it meets Westmoreland Street heading north, College Street heading northeast, and Grafton Street heading south. The Temple Bar district is to the north.

==History and layout==

The area was once known as Hoggen Green and named after the nunnery of Blessed Virgin Mary del Hogges constructed at this location in 1156 by Diarmaid mac Murchadha. The name &quot;Hoggen&quot; derives from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot; meaning mound, or barrow. The cemetery at College Green consisted of several burial mounds, which are thought to have contained the remains of some of the Norse kings of Dublin.

Between Church Lane and Suffolk Street, the Hiberno-Norse held their Thing, an assembly and meeting place, which was still to be seen in the 17th century. All along College Green, called Hoggen Green by the English, lay their barrows. Hoggen gave its name to the convent of St Mary de Hogges, which stood roughly where the Bank of Ireland is now and was a major landowner in the area until the Reformation. Originally laid out as a triangular green, it is now a rough trapezoid. The site has been historically used in celebration, with newly appointed Viceroys of Ireland being welcomed on the street.

Trinity College was founded on the street&#x27;s east side in 1592. The west front&#x27;s facade was designed by Theodore Jacobsen and added in 1751, funded partially by government duties on tobacco imported from slave plantations in the West Indies. Several public monuments stand in College Green, including a 19th-century statue facing the college of old Irish Parliament member Henry Grattan, designed by John Henry Foley.

By the time Charles Brooking published his map of Dublin in 1728, College Green had developed from a rural thoroughfare and properties had been built on both sides of the street.

A statue of King William III of England on horseback was constructed in the centre of College Green in 1701 by Grinling Gibbons. The statue was historically the site of celebrations marking the King&#x27;s birthday on 4 November, with a procession through the city and a parade around the statue. These celebrations during the age of the Whig single party state were recorded by Mary Delany, who wrote that the King was &quot;idolized here almost to superstition.&quot; After the formation of the ultra-Whig Orange Order in 1795 and the Rebellion of 1798, the statue became a target for the fervour of both sides. The statue was routinely decorated with orange ribbons and lilies, with the railings painted orange, but it was also frequently defaced, painted with pitch and there was one attempt to remove the head.

The engraving &quot;Visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Ireland: The Royal Procession passing College-Green, Dublin&quot; published in the 25 April 1868 issue of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; depicted a group of children who had climbed up to the pedestal of the statue of William III to get a better view.

The statue is also featured in James Joyce&#x27;s story &quot;The Dead&quot;. The statue continued to be attacked and defaced numerous times through the 19th and 20th centuries, leading to many repairs. The annual parades and processions ceased in 1823. It was eventually taken down after 277 years when it was badly damaged in an explosion on 11 November 1928, Armistice Day, with the head having been stolen in 1929. The area was the temporary site of an air raid shelter during World War II. 

In 1966, a statue of the poet and nationalist Thomas Davis was constructed in the centre of College Green, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Easter Rising. The design includes a fountain designed by Edward Delaney, featuring four figures with trumpets which represent the four provinces of Ireland.

==Architecture==
Chichester House was constructed by Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester in the early 17th century. It was subsequently adapted for the Irish Parliament around 1670, and replaced by a new Parliament House in 1729, designed by Edward Lovett Pearce. It was later enlarged by James Gandon in 1787 and Edward Parke between 1804 and 1808. The site is now the Bank of Ireland.

Daly&#x27;s Club, a gambling house and club founded by Patrick Daly in 1750, moved to the space on College Green between Foster Place and Anglesea Street at numbers 2–5 in 1769. It closed in 1823. The buildings were renovated in 1870, with two additional stories added. The centre portion is now taken up by shops.

Number 6-8 was formerly the site of the Jury&#x27;s Hotel. It opened in 1839 as a commercial lodging house and was rebuilt in 1859 and 1882. The premises was sold when Jury&#x27;s relocated to Ballsbridge. The contents were auctioned, with the ornate mahogany bar sold to a buyer in Zurich. The site was bought by Patrick Gallagher in July 1979, who demolished the hotel in 1980 and built a granite-clad office block designed by Burke-Kennedy Doyle and Partners in its place, which was used by Telecom Éireann. The remodelled building now forms part of the Central Plaza development by Hines.

The Ulster Bank headquarters on College Green was built in the late 1970s. Despite objections from groups like the Dublin Civic Group, a collection of mostly Victorian buildings which faced onto College Green, Suffolk Street and Church Lane were demolished in 1976 to make way for the new development. The high-domed Victorian façade on College Green was kept, but the interior was entirely remodelled.

Guinness Mahon moved from South Frederick Street to numbers 16–17 in 1854. The current building was constructed in 1931 by G&amp;T Crampton for the Bank. The Bank subsequently moved to St Stephen&#x27;s Green.

==Politics==

College Green is commemorated in Francis Wheatley&#x27;s painting &quot;Dublin Volunteers on College Green&quot;, which shows the Irish Volunteers demonstrating for independence on 4 November 1779.

Bill Clinton, the President of the United States visited Dublin in December 1995 and gave a speech in College Green to 80,000 people. In May 2011, President Barack Obama gave a speech at College Green in front of 100,000. During the speech, he praised Ireland for its economic opportunities, and said he was proud of his Moneygall heritage.

==Traffic restriction==
Since July 2009, College Green, during peak times on working days, has been accessible only to pedestrians, buses, taxis and cyclists. This increased to all times in May 2023.

In 2016, plans were published for College Green to be fully pedestrianised, apart from a public-transport lane along the Trinity College side, to create a large public space in front of the Bank of Ireland. Dublin City Council announced that a joint team of Dixon Jones and Paul Keogh Architects would be responsible for redesigning the space. The plans drew several protests from store owners, taxi drivers and bus operators. In October 2018 An Bord Pleanála, the state planning agency rejected the plan. The Green Party-led Dublin City Council banned traffic for three Sundays in summer 2019 in order to test the feasibility of further traffic restrictions.

<doc id="168441" wikidata="Q988326" url="?curid=168441" title="Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542">
<text>The Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 () or the Acts of Union (), were Acts of the Parliament of England under King Henry VIII of England, causing Wales to be incorporated into the realm of the Kingdom of England. 

The legal system of England and the norms of English administration including the use of the English language only were applied to a mainly Welsh-speaking Wales. This created a single state and legal jurisdiction, which is now called England and Wales.

Before these Acts, Wales had already been annexed by England in 1284 and was excluded from parliamentary representation. Wales was divided between the Principality of Wales and many feudal statelets called the marcher Lordships which were effectively unified under the laws. The English county system was also extended across all of Wales.

== Background ==
After Henry VIII made himself the head of the Church of England in 1534, Wales was seen as a potential problem which included some ambitious men unhappy with ethnic disadvantage in Wales and frustrated with legal complexities. Wales had also been the landing ground for Henry VII and was close to Catholic Ireland.

Chief administrator to the English crown Thomas Cromwell, brought forward Acts to unify Wales with England. The first of the Acts came in 1536 and was later strengthened by the Act of 1542/43. The Acts aimed to integrate the legal, political and administrative systems of Wales with England and make English the language of the courts in Wales, which was a mainly Welsh speaking country at the time. The preamble of the Acts suggests that legal differences in Wales led to discontent, which the English establishment wished to end.

The Acts were the result of a long process of assimilation. Wales had been annexed by England, following the conquest by Edward I, under the Statute of Rhuddlan of 1284.

== Acts ==
The two acts have the long titles &quot;An Act for Laws and Justice to be ministered in Wales in like Form as it is in this Realm&quot; and &quot;An Act for Certain Ordinances in the King&#x27;s Majesty&#x27;s Dominion and Principality of Wales&quot;. Together they are known as the Acts of Union. The aim of the acts were to incorporate Wales into what Henry VIII of England saw as part of his Tudor Empire, with himself as sovereign ruler.

The acts were not popularly referred to as the &quot;Acts of Union&quot; until 1901, when historian Owen M. Edwards assigned them that name. This name is misleading and the legal short title of each Act has since 1948 been &quot;The Laws in Wales Act&quot;. They are also often seen cited by the years they received royal assent, 1536 and 1543 respectively, although the official citation uses the preceding years, as each of these Acts was passed between 1 January and 25 March, at a time when New Year&#x27;s Day fell on 25 March.

The Laws in Wales Act 1535 was passed in 1536 in the 8th session of Henry VIII&#x27;s 5th parliament, which began on 4 February 1535/36, and repealed with effect from 21 December 1993. Meanwhile the act of 1542 was passed in 1543 in the second session of Henry VIII&#x27;s 8th parliament, which began on 22 January 1542/43.

=== Provisions ===
The act declared King Henry&#x27;s intentions, that because of differences in law and language:

– and therefore:

The Laws in Wales Act 1535 imposed English law and the English language upon the Welsh people and allowed Welsh representation in the English parliament. These Acts also had many effects on the administration of Wales. The marcher lordships were abolished as political units, and five new counties were established on Welsh lands (Monmouthshire, Brecknockshire, Radnorshire, Montgomeryshire and Denbighshire), thus creating a Wales of 13 counties; Other areas of the lordships were annexed to Shropshire, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Glamorgan, Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire, Cardiganshire and Merionethshire; The borders of Wales for administrative/government purposes were established and have remained the same since; this was unintentional as Wales was to be incorporated fully into England, but the status of Monmouthshire was still ambiguous in the view of some people until confirmed by the Local Government Act 1972. Each county or shire consisted of fewer than a dozen hundreds corresponding with varying degrees of accuracy to the former commotes.

Wales elected members to the English (Westminster) Parliament, and the Council of Wales and the Marches was established on a legal basis. The Court of Great Sessions was established, a system peculiar to Wales, with a Sheriff appointed in every county, and other county officers as in England. The courts of the marcher lordships lost the power to try serious criminal cases, all courts in Wales were to be conducted in the English language, not Welsh, and the office of justice of the peace was introduced, nine to every county.

== Effects ==
In the Welsh Principality, assimilation had already been greatly implemented and so the 1536 and 1542/43 acts in reality brought some legal consistency across Wales, effectively extending the Principality to the Welsh Marches and ending use of Welsh law. 

The legal simplicity made it easier for the English crown to collect tax in Wales. After the conquest of Wales by Edward I, the counties of Anglesey, Caernarfonshire, Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire, Flintshire and Merionethshire were added to by the formerly Marcher counties of Brecknockshire, Denbighshire, Glamorgan, Montgomeryshire, Pembrokeshire and Radnorshire. This also formed a legal border with England.

Although the poor people of Wales may not have been aware of the laws, the measures were popular with the Welsh gentry who saw the acts as bringing legal equality with English citizens. The Acts were also seen by the gentry as reducing the influence of the marcher lords.

English was made the legal language in Wales, which was symbolically unjust for the majority Welsh monoglot population. Although the centre of political power was England, the Welsh language remained the language of the people and the land.

<doc id="168445" wikidata="Q234964" url="?curid=168445" title="Hélène Cixous">
<text>Hélène Cixous (; ; born 5 June 1937) is a French writer, playwright and literary critic. During her academic career, she was primarily associated with the Centre universitaire de Vincennes (today&#x27;s University of Paris VIII), which she co-founded in 1969 and where she created the first centre of women&#x27;s studies at a European university. Known for her experimental writing style and great versatility as a writer and thinker, she has written more than seventy books dealing with multiple genres: theatre, literary and feminist theory, art criticism, autobiography and poetic fiction.

She first gained attention in 1969 with her first work of fiction, &quot;Dedans&quot; (&quot;Inside&quot;), a semi-autobiographical novel which won the Prix Médicis and explored the themes of identity, memory, death and writing. She is perhaps best known for her 1976 article &quot;The Laugh of the Medusa&quot;, which established her as one of the early thinkers in post-structural feminism. She has collaborated with several artists and directors, such as Adel Abdessemed, Pierre Alechinsky, Simone Benmussa, Jacques Derrida, Simon Hantaï, Daniel Mesguich and Ariane Mnouchkine. She is considered a strong contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Life and career==

=== Personal life ===
Cixous was born in Oran, French Algeria, to Jewish parents, Eve Cixous, née Klein, (1910–2013) and Georges Cixous (1909–1948). Georges Cixous, a physician who had written his dissertation on tuberculosis, died of the disease in 1948. Eve Cixous became a midwife in Algiers following his death, &quot;until her expulsion with the last French doctors and midwives in 1971.&quot; Cixous&#x27; brother, Pierre, &quot;a medical student and a supporter of Algerian independence&quot; was condemned to death in 1961 by the Organisation armée secrète, and joined Cixous in Bordeaux. Her mother and brother returned to Algeria following the country&#x27;s independence in 1962. They were arrested, and Cixous &quot;obtained their release with the help of Ahmed Ben Bella&#x27;s lawyer.&quot;

Cixous married Guy Berger in 1955, with whom she had three children, Anne-Emmanuelle (b. 1958), Stéphane (1960–1961), and Pierre-François (b. 1961). Cixous and Berger divorced in 1964.

=== Academic career ===
Cixous earned her agrégation in English in 1959 and her &quot;Doctorat ès lettres&quot; in 1968. Her main focus, at this time, was English literature and the works of James Joyce. Cixous became &quot;assistante&quot; at the University of Bordeaux in 1962, served as &quot;maître assistante&quot; at the Sorbonne from 1965 to 1967, and was appointed &quot;maître de conférence&quot; at Paris Nanterre University in 1967.

In 1968, following the French student riots, Cixous was charged with founding the University of Paris VIII, &quot;created to serve as an alternative to the traditional French academic environment.&quot; Cixous would, in 1974, found the University&#x27;s centre for women&#x27;s studies, the first in Europe. Cixous is a professor at the University of Paris VIII and at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland.

=== Publications ===
In 1968, Cixous published her doctoral dissertation &quot;L&#x27;Exil de James Joyce ou l&#x27;Art du remplacement&quot; (&quot;The Exile of James Joyce, or the Art of Displacement&quot;) and the following year she published her first novel, &quot;Dedans&quot; (&quot;Inside&quot;), a semi-autobiographical work that won the Prix Médicis.

She has published widely, including twenty-three volumes of poems, six books of essays, five plays, and numerous influential articles. She published &quot;Voiles&quot; (&quot;Veils&quot;) with Jacques Derrida and her work is often considered deconstructive. In introducing her Wellek Lecture, subsequently published as &quot;Three Steps on the Ladder of Writing&quot;, Derrida referred to her as the greatest living writer in his language (French). Cixous wrote a book on Derrida titled &quot;Portrait de Jacques Derrida en jeune saint juif&quot; (&quot;Portrait of Jacques Derrida as a Young Jewish Saint&quot;). Her reading of Derrida finds additional layers of meaning at a phonemic rather than strictly lexical level. In addition to Derrida and Joyce, she has written monographs on the work of the Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector, on Maurice Blanchot, Franz Kafka, Heinrich von Kleist, Michel de Montaigne, Ingeborg Bachmann, Thomas Bernhard, and the Russian poet Marina Tsvetaeva. Cixous is also the author of essays on artists, including Simon Hantaï, Pierre Alechinsky and Adel Abdessemed to whom she has devoted two books.

Along with Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva, Cixous is considered one of the mothers of poststructuralist feminist theory.
In the 1970s, Cixous began writing about the relationship between sexuality and language. Like other poststructuralist feminist theorists, Cixous believes that our sexuality is directly tied to how we communicate in society. In 1975, Cixous published her most influential article &quot;Le rire de la méduse&quot; (&quot;The Laugh of the Medusa&quot;), which was revised by her, translated into English by Paula Cohen and Keith Cohen, and released in English in 1976. She has published over 70 works; her fiction, dramatic writing, and poetry, however, are not often read in English.

=== Film ===
Hélène Cixous is featured in Olivier Morel&#x27;s 118-minute film &quot;Ever, Rêve, Hélène Cixous&quot; (France, USA, 2018).

===Accolades and awards===
Cixous holds honorary degrees from Queen&#x27;s University and the University of Alberta in Canada; University College Dublin in Ireland; the University of York and University College London in the UK; and Georgetown University, Northwestern University, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the USA. In 2008 she was appointed as A.D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University until June 2014.

==Influences on Cixous&#x27; writing==
Some of the most notable influences on her writings have been Jacques Derrida, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan and Arthur Rimbaud. 

===Sigmund Freud===
Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud established the initial theories that would serve as a basis for some of Cixous&#x27; arguments in developmental psychology. Freud&#x27;s analysis of gender roles and sexual identity concluded with separate paths for boys and girls through the Oedipus complex and Electra complex, theories of which Cixous was particularly critical. She joined other scholars in positing The Freudian Coverup.

===Jacques Derrida===
Contemporaries, lifelong friends, and intellectuals, Jacques Derrida and Cixous both grew up as French Jews in Algeria and share a &quot;belonging constituted of exclusion and nonbelonging&quot;—not Algerian, rejected by France, their Jewishness concealed or acculturated. In Derrida&#x27;s family, &quot;one never said &#x27;circumcision&#x27; but &#x27;baptism,&#x27; not &#x27;Bar Mitzvah&#x27; but &#x27;communion.&#x27;&quot; Judaism cloaked in Catholicism is one example of the undecidability of identity that influenced the thinker whom Cixous calls a &quot;Jewish Saint&quot;. Her book &quot;Portrait of Jacques Derrida as a Young Jewish Saint&quot; addresses these matters.

Through deconstruction, Derrida appropriated and employed the term &quot;logocentrism&quot; (which is not his coinage although he adapted it substantially for his needs). This is the concept that explains how Western metaphysics use of language relies on a hierarchical system that values the spoken word over the written word in Western culture. The idea of binary opposition is essential to Cixous&#x27; position on language. 

Cixous and Luce Irigaray combined Derrida&#x27;s logocentric idea and Lacan&#x27;s primary signifier for desire (the phallus), creating the term &quot;phallogocentrism&quot;. This term focuses on Derrida&#x27;s social structure of speech and binary opposition as the centre of reference for language, with the phallic being privileged and how women are only defined by what they lack; not A vs. B, but, rather A vs. ¬A (not-A).

In a dialogue between Derrida and Cixous, Derrida said about Cixous: &quot;Helene&#x27;s texts are translated across the world, but they remain untranslatable. We are two French writers who cultivate a strange relationship, or a strangely familiar relationship with the French language – at once more translated and more untranslatable than many a French author. We are more rooted in the French language than those with ancestral roots in this culture and this land.&quot;

==Major works==
===&quot;The Laugh of the Medusa&quot; (1975)===

Cixous&#x27; critical feminist essay &quot;The Laugh of the Medusa&quot;, originally written in French as &quot;Le Rire de la Méduse&quot; in 1975, was (after she revised it) translated into English by Paula Cohen and Keith Cohen in 1976. It is considered a foundational essay, particularly because it announces what Cixous called &quot;écriture féminine&quot;, a distinctive mode of writing by women and for women.

<doc id="168453" wikidata="Q328099" url="?curid=168453" title="Bokeh">
<text>In photography, bokeh ( or ; ) is the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in out-of-focus parts of an image, whether foreground or background or both. It is created by using a wide aperture lens. 

Some photographers incorrectly restrict use of the term bokeh to the appearance of bright spots in the out-of-focus area caused by circles of confusion. Bokeh has also been defined as &quot;the way the lens renders out-of-focus points of light&quot;. Differences in lens aberrations and aperture shape cause very different bokeh effects. Some lens designs blur the image in a way that is pleasing to the eye, while others produce distracting or unpleasant blurring (&quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; bokeh, respectively). Photographers may deliberately use a shallow focus technique to create images with prominent out-of-focus regions, accentuating their lens&#x27;s bokeh.

Bokeh is often most visible around small background highlights, such as specular reflections and light sources, which is why it is often associated with such areas. However, bokeh is not limited to highlights; blur occurs in all regions of an image which are outside the depth of field.

The opposite of bokeh—an image in which multiple distances are visible and all are in focus—is deep focus.

==Etymology==
The term comes from the Japanese word , which means or &quot;haze&quot;, resulting in , the &quot;blur quality&quot;. This is derived as a noun form of the verb , which is written in several ways, with additional meanings and nuances: refers to being blurry, hazy or out-of-focus, whereas the and spellings refer to being mentally hazy, befuddled, childish, senile, or playing stupid. (literally, &quot;time difference fog&quot;) is the term for jet lag. is a verb denoting the actions or condition of someone who is half-asleep, or nodding off. means playing dumb, and refers to a poker face. The related term means intentional blurring or gradation; that is a noun form of the transitive verb , which means to make something blurry, rather than to be blurry.

===Use abroad===
The English spelling &quot;bokeh&quot; was popularized in 1997 in &quot;Photo Techniques&quot; magazine, when Mike Johnston, the editor at the time, commissioned three papers on the topic for the May/June 1997 issue; he altered the spelling to suggest the correct pronunciation to English speakers, saying &quot;it is properly pronounced with bo as in bone and ke as in Kenneth, with equal stress on either syllable&quot;.

The spellings &quot;bokeh&quot; and &quot;boke&quot; have both been in use since at least 1996, when Merklinger had suggested &quot;or Bokeh if you prefer.&quot; The term &quot;bokeh&quot; has appeared in photography books as early as 1998.
It is sometimes pronounced .

==Bokeh and lens design==

Though difficult to quantify, some lenses have subjectively more pleasing out-of-focus areas. &quot;Good&quot; bokeh is especially important for macro lenses and long telephoto lenses, because they are typically used in situations that produce shallow depth of field. Good bokeh is also important for medium telephoto lenses (typically 85–150 mm on 35 mm format). When used in portrait photography (for their &quot;natural&quot; perspective), the photographer usually wants a shallow depth of field, so that the subject stands out sharply against a blurred background.

Bokeh characteristics may be quantified by examining the image&#x27;s circle of confusion. In out-of-focus areas, each point of light becomes an image of the aperture, generally a more or less round disc. Depending on how a lens is corrected for spherical aberration, the disc may be uniformly illuminated, brighter near the edge, or brighter near the center. A well-known lens that exhibited the latter &quot;soap-bubble&quot; characteristic was that produced by Hugo Meyer &amp; Co., more recently revived by Meyer Optik Görlitz.

Lenses that are poorly corrected for spherical aberration will show one kind of disc for out-of-focus points in front of the plane of focus, and a different kind for points behind. This may actually be desirable, as blur circles that are dimmer near the edges produce less-defined shapes which blend smoothly with the surrounding image.
The shape of the aperture has an influence on the subjective quality of bokeh as well. For conventional lens designs (with bladed apertures), when a lens is stopped down smaller than its maximum aperture size (minimum f-number), out-of-focus points are blurred into the polygonal shape formed by the aperture blades. This is most apparent when a lens produces hard-edged bokeh. For this reason, some lenses have many aperture blades and/or blades with curved edges to make the aperture more closely approximate a circle rather than a polygon. Minolta has been on the forefront of promoting and introducing lenses with near-ideal circular apertures since 1987, but most other manufacturers now offer lenses with shape-optimized diaphragms, at least for the domain of portraiture photography. In contrast, a catadioptric telephoto lens renders bokehs resembling doughnuts, because its secondary mirror blocks the central part of the aperture opening. Recently, photographers have exploited the shape of the bokeh by creating a simple mask out of card with shapes such as hearts or stars, that the photographer wishes the bokeh to be, and placing it over the lens.

Lenses with 11, 12, or 15 blade iris diaphragms are often claimed to excel in bokeh quality. Because of this, the lenses do not need to reach wide apertures to get better circles (instead of polygons). In the past, wide aperture lenses (f/2, f/2.8) were very expensive, due to the complex mathematical design and manufacturing know-how required, at a time when all computations and glass making were done by hand. Leica could reach a good bokeh at f/4.5. Today it is much easier to make an f/1.8 lens, and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85 mm lens to achieve great bokeh.

Some lens manufacturers including Nikon, Minolta, and Sony make lenses designed with specific controls to change the rendering of the out-of-focus areas.

The Nikon 105 mm DC-Nikkor and 135 mm DC-Nikkor lenses (DC stands for &quot;Defocus Control&quot;) have a control ring that permits the overcorrection or undercorrection of spherical aberration to change the bokeh in front of and behind the focal plane.

The Minolta/Sony STF 135 mm f/2.8 [T4.5] (with STF standing for &quot;smooth trans focus&quot;) is a lens specifically designed to produce pleasing bokeh. It is possible to choose between two diaphragms: one with 9 and another with 10 blades. An apodization filter is used to soften the aperture edges which results in a smooth defocused area with gradually fading circles. Those qualities made it the only lens of this kind on the market from its introduction in 1999 to 2014. In 2014 Fujifilm announced a lens utilizing a similar apodization filter in the Fujinon XF 56mm F1.2 R APD lens. Sony added the Sony FE 100 mm F2.8 STF GM OSS in 2017.

The &#x27;Sigma YS System Focusing&#x27; 135 mm f/2.8 also has an extra manually-moved component, intended to compensate for aberration at close-focus distances. It can be re-purposed for defocus control.
In 2015, Meyer Optik USA Inc. launched a Kickstarter campaign to produce the Trioplan f2.9/50, a new lens based on one originally produced by Hugo Meyer &amp; Co.; both lenses exhibit a characteristic &quot;soap-bubble&quot; bokeh.

The use of anamorphic lenses will cause bokeh to appear differently along the horizontal and vertical axes of the lens, becoming ellipsoidal compared to those in a spherical lens.

In 2016, Apple Inc. released the iPhone 7 Plus which can take pictures with &quot;Portrait Mode&quot; (a bokeh like effect). Samsung&#x27;s Galaxy Note 8 has a similar effect available. Both of these phones use dual cameras to detect edges and create a &quot;depth map&quot; of the image, which the phone uses to blur the out-of-focus portions of the photo. Other phones, like the Google Pixel, only use a single camera and machine learning to create the depth map.

In 2017, Vivo released a smartphone with dual front lenses for selfies with bokeh. The first, a 20 MP lens, uses a 1/2.78&quot; sensor with f/2.0 aperture, while the second, an 8 MP f/2.0 lens, captures depth information. Bokeh can be made with a combination of both lenses, and shots can be refocused even after they are captured, adding bokeh effects with different depths.

In early 2018, the Honor 9 Lite smartphone was released with quad cameras (two dual-lens). Both the front and back cameras have a 13 MP main lens and a 2 MP lens for capturing bokeh depth information.

==Emulation==
Bokeh can be simulated by convolving the image with a kernel that corresponds to the image of an out-of-focus point source taken with a real camera. Unlike conventional convolution, this convolution has a kernel that depends on the distance of each image point and – at least in principle – has to include image points that are occluded by objects in the foreground. Also, bokeh is not just any blur. To a first approximation, defocus blur is convolution by a uniform disk, a more computationally intensive operation than the &quot;standard&quot; Gaussian blur; the former produces sharp circles around highlights whereas the latter is a much softer effect. Diffraction may alter the effective shape of the blur. Some graphics editors have a filter to do this, usually called &quot;Lens Blur&quot;. Accurate bokeh simulation requires running the blur in linear, HDR space. For low dynamic range images, an artificial neural network may be used to reconstruct the HDR light. 

An alternative mechanical mechanism has been proposed for generating bokeh in small aperture cameras such as compacts or cellphone cameras, called image destabilisation, in which both the lens and sensor are moved in order to maintain focus at one focal plane, while defocusing nearby ones. This effect currently generates blur in only one axis.

Some advanced digital cameras have bokeh features which take several images with different apertures and focuses and then manually compose them afterward to one image. More advanced systems of bokeh use a hardware system of 2 sensors, one sensor to take photo as usual while other ones record depth information. Bokeh effect and refocusing can then be applied to an image after the photo is taken.

==Other applications==
In 2009, a research group at MIT Media Lab showed that the bokeh effect can be used to make imperceptibly small barcodes, or bokodes. By using barcodes as small as 3 mm with a small lens over them, if the barcode is viewed out of focus through an ordinary camera focused at infinity, the resulting image is large enough to scan the information in the barcode.

<doc id="168455" wikidata="Q1324189" url="?curid=168455" title="Home and Away">
<text>Home and Away (H&amp;A) is an Australian television soap opera. It was created by Alan Bateman and commenced broadcast on the Seven Network on 17 January 1988. Bateman came up with the concept of the show during a trip to Kangaroo Point, New South Wales, where he noticed locals were complaining about the construction of a foster home and against the idea of foster children from the city living in the area. The soap opera was initially going to be called &quot;Refuge&quot;, but the name was changed to the &quot;friendlier&quot; title of &quot;Home and Away&quot; once production began.

The show premiered in what Bateman classified as a ninety-minute telefeature (subsequently in re-runs and on VHS titled as &quot;Home and Away: The Movie&quot;), as opposed to a pilot. Since then, each subsequent episode has aired for a duration of twenty-two minutes. &quot;Home and Away&quot; has become the second longest-running drama series in Australian television, after &quot;Neighbours&quot;. In Australia, it is currently broadcast from Mondays to Thursdays at 7:00 pm.

&quot;Home and Away&quot; follows the lives and loves of the residents in Summer Bay, a fictional seaside town in New South Wales. The series initially focused on the Fletcher family – Tom (Roger Oakley) and Pippa (Vanessa Downing), and their five foster children, Frank Morgan (Alex Papps), Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), Lynn Davenport (Helena Bozich), Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) – who moved from the city into the Summer Bay House, where they assumed the new job of running the caravan park, and eventually took in a sixth foster child, Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson). &quot;Home and Away&quot; was not without controversy. During the first season alone, it featured several adult-themed storylines such as teen pregnancy, rape, drug and alcohol addiction, drug overdose and attempted suicide. The series has dealt with similar storylines over the years which have often exceeded its restricted time slot. Palm Beach in Sydney&#x27;s Northern Beaches district has been used as the location for Summer Bay since 1988. The exterior scenes are filmed mainly at Palm Beach, while the interior scenes are filmed at the Australian Technology Park in Redfern.

&quot;Home and Away&quot; has been sold to over 80 countries around the world, making it one of Australia&#x27;s most successful media exports. In the UK, it and fellow Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; are the most popular of the genre that are filmed internationally; &quot;Home and Away&quot; is broadcast on Channel 5, which also previously aired &quot;Neighbours&quot; until it was initially cancelled in 2022 after the network declined to renew its contract for the programme (it has since been revived by Amazon Freevee, in cooperation with domestic broadcaster Network 10). It is one of the highest-rating shows on RTÉ Television in Ireland (the same episode being shown twice per day: first in the early afternoon on RTÉ 1 and second in the early evening on RTÉ 2), and TVNZ 2 in New Zealand. In Australia, &quot;Home and Away&quot; is the most awarded program at the Logie Awards, with a total of 49 wins, including Most Popular Drama Program. Some cast members have won several other awards such as the Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television, Silver Logie for Most Popular Actor, and Most Popular Actress. In 2015, &quot;Home and Away&quot; was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.

==Production==
===Conception===
After the Seven Network cancelled their soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; on 12 July 1985 due to low ratings, rival Network 10 picked it up and turned it into a success. A couple of years later, Seven&#x27;s head of drama, Alan Bateman, became desperate to get back into the soap market and began to work out how to launch another soap that was not a copy of &quot;Neighbours&quot;. While on a trip to Kangaroo Point, New South Wales with his family, Bateman began talking to locals who were &quot;up in arms&quot; over the construction of a foster home for children from the city. Seeing the degree of conflict the &quot;influx of parentless children on a tight-knit community&quot; was having, Bateman came away with the idea for a new serial. He explained &quot;Nobody in the community wanted them to move in and I began to wonder how streetwise city kids would adapt to the new lifestyle. Suddenly I thought, there is my slice of life in a community.&quot; Bateman began outlining the storyline and set the serial in the fictional town of Summer Bay. While Seven Network executives were unconvinced by the idea, audience research was positive. The soap opera was initially called &quot;Refuge&quot;, but the name was changed to the &quot;friendlier&quot; title of &quot;Home and Away&quot; once production began.

&quot;Home and Away&quot; has since become the second-longest drama series in Australian television after &quot;Neighbours&quot;. In 2002, several former characters such as Frank Morgan (Alex Papps), Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), Steven Matheson (Adam Willits), Blake Dean (Les Hill) and Sophie Simpson (Rebekah Elmaloglou) returned for a special storyline to mark the 150th anniversary of settlement in Summer Bay. The storyline featured a majority of the cast boarded onto a ferry boat for a night cruise; however, a massive storm ruined the celebrations, leading the boat to sink. In July 2005, &quot;Home and Away&quot; celebrated its 4000th episode, which saw many former cast members return for Alf Stewart&#x27;s (Ray Meagher) surprise 60th birthday party. In March 2007, the commercial television industry&#x27;s Annual Code Complaint Report revealed that &quot;Home and Away&quot; was the eighth most complained about show on Australian television, and the only drama series in the top ten complaint list. From 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, there were 23 written complaints about the show as viewers thought it was inappropriate for it to be shown in its 7:00 pm timeslot.

&quot;Home and Away&quot; celebrated its 21st year in production in Sydney on 23 July 2009. The mayor of Sydney&#x27;s Pittwater Council presented cast members with the key to Palm Beach, the exteriors setting filming location for the show. At the end of 2011, Cameron Welsh left his role as the series producer. Welsh previously played the character Mitch McColl from 1999 until 2001 and then became the series producer for &quot;Home and Away&quot; in 2007. Former &quot;All Saints&quot; producer Lucy Addario took over as series producer in January 2012. In August 2012, &quot;Home and Away&quot;″s official Australian Facebook page reached one million likes, becoming the first Australian television show to reach this milestone. The Facebook page was established in November 2009 and is followed by fans mostly in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. In 2013, &quot;Home and Away&quot; celebrated its 25th anniversary and former cast member Kate Ritchie (Sally Fletcher) returned for a special storyline to coincide with the celebrations. For the first time in the show&#x27;s history, &quot;Home and Away&quot; aired a two-hander episode, featuring only the characters Ricky Sharpe (Bonnie Sveen) and Darryl &quot;Brax&quot; Braxton (Steve Peacocke), on 14 February 2016.

===Location and sets===
&quot;Home and Away&quot; is set in Summer Bay, a fictional seaside town in New South Wales. Locations within the town include the beach, a high school, diner, bait shop, garage and a surf club, which includes a gym, small kiosk and an upstairs restaurant. Characters in the show live at surrounding neighbouring areas such as the Summer Bay House, Summer Bay Caravan Park, Beach House, The Farmhouse, Pier flat, and Saxon Avenue. Other fictional towns mentioned and sometimes seen in &quot;Home and Away&quot; are Mangrove River and Yabbie Creek.

Palm Beach in Sydney&#x27;s Northern Beaches district has been used as the location for Summer Bay since &quot;Home and Away&quot; began in 1988. It has since become popular with tourists, and tours to the show&#x27;s exterior sets at Palm Beach run throughout the year. The exterior scenes are filmed mainly at Palm Beach and at Fisherman&#x27;s Beach in Collaroy. Interior scenes for the show were filmed at the Seven Network&#x27;s Sydney studios in Epping until 2010. Following the closure of these studios in early 2010, the interiors are now filmed at the Australian Technology Park in Redfern. The Jackeroo Ranch estate in Kenthurst had been used for the exterior sets of the Summer Bay House and Caravan Park since 1988. After both sets were destroyed by a bushfire in December 2002, the caravan park set was moved and filmed at other locations such as the Waratah Park Earth Sanctuary between 2007–09 and the Lane Cove River Tourist Park between 2010 and 2014. A replica of the Summer Bay House was rebuilt in its original location at the Kenthurst estate several years later, with the exception of a grey roof instead of a red one. The caravan park set moved back to the estate after the house was rebuilt, and both exterior sets made their on-screen returns in 2015. The Summer Bay House is the only house to still be seen on screen since the pilot episode.

Aside from New South Wales, &quot;Home and Away&quot; has also filmed scenes in other states of Australia. In May 2012, the show filmed scenes at Flinders Ranges and Nilpena Station in South Australia for a storyline in which Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes) was kidnapped and taken to the outback by Kyle Braxton (Nic Westaway). The following month, &quot;Home and Away&quot; filmed scenes in Melbourne for the second time. In November 2014, the show filmed an episode at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra with several cast members, as a tribute to the Anzac Centenary. The episode centred around Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher), &quot;who becomes upset with the younger generation&#x27;s perceived lack of respect for Anzac Day, and joins the school trip to Canberra to visit the War Memorial.&quot; Outside of Australia, &quot;Home and Away&quot; has filmed in Hawaii once and in the UK three times.

===Theme song===

The theme song to &quot;Home and Away&quot; was written by Mike Perjanik. There have been nine different versions of the theme song used throughout the years. The lyrics remained the same since the show&#x27;s inception, but a number of verses were gradually cut back over the years due to time restrictions. The original version was sung by Karen Boddington and Mark Williams, and was used from 1988 until mid-1995. Their version was released as a single in the UK in 1989 and peaked at number 73 on the UK Singles Chart. A new version performed by Doug Williams and Erana Clark debuted in 1995 and the opening theme was shortened in 1996; this version remained until 1999. From 2000 to 2003, the theme song to &quot;Home and Away&quot; was sung by The Robertson Brothers and it was the first version to use only male vocals. A 30-second updated version by The Robertson Brothers was used from 2004 to 2006. In January 2007, a new version was introduced and performed by Israel Cannan, who played the character Wazza in the show. After Cannan&#x27;s version received many complaints from fans, the Seven Network decided to re-record the theme song in April 2007 with vocals provided by Luke Dolahenty. A shorter, 15-second version sung by Dolahenty and Tarryn Stokes debuted in 2009.

From 2010 until 2017, the &quot;Home and Away&quot; theme song was not used in the opening titles and was replaced by a short instrumental version. However, Dolahenty and Stokes&#x27; version was still used in the closing credits for international broadcasts. In 2018, two new eight-second versions of the theme song made a return to the opening titles after an eight-year absence. One version is sung by a male vocalist, while the other version is sung by a female vocalist; in the opening titles, both only sing the last two lines of the theme: &quot;closer each day, Home and Away&quot;. An extended 30-second version by the male vocalist was uploaded onto the &quot;Home and Away&quot; website. In January 2025, Wade Sellers of &quot;TV Week&quot; confirmed that the theme song would return that year, but would not be featured in every episode. 

===Opening titles===
The &quot;Home and Away&quot; opening titles sequence was initially used to introduce the regular characters in the show. The sequences often featured the characters in couple shots or with family and friends, and showed them in familiar settings around Summer Bay such as the beach. The titles for the show&#x27;s earlier years featured black brush stroke cutouts around the character shots. 2004 saw &quot;Home and Away&quot; introduce new picture frame-style opening titles, with characters shown posing in and out of large picture frames in front of beach backgrounds. In January 2007, the show debuted new opening titles along with a new version of the theme song. The picture-frame style was still used, but this time the titles featured framed pictures of the characters. In 2009, the opening was reduced to 15 seconds and the characters were removed from the titles for the first time in &quot;Home and Away&quot;″s history. They were replaced by a large photo collage showing various locations around Summer Bay. The decision to remove the cast and shorten the titles was due to time restrictions. Since then, many viewers in Australia and the United Kingdom have wanted the full-length title sequence with the cast to return.

From 2013 until 2017, &quot;Home and Away&quot; used a series of five-second opening titles, which changed every week. The various titles mostly featured scenes of bikini-clad women and shirtless men with surfboards at the beach. In 2018, a new series of eight-second titles were introduced along with the return of the show&#x27;s theme song. The new titles, which currently change during each week, mostly feature two men or two women running down to the ocean for a surf. A 30-second version of the titles, not aired on Australian television, was released on the &quot;Home and Away&quot; website. The removal of the opening titles was unpopular with &quot;Home and Away&quot; fans who wanted them to return. In January 2025, Wade Sellers of &quot;TV Week&quot; confirmed that the opening titles would return that year following a seventeen year absence. The titles debuted on 6 February 2025 and featured the return of the show&#x27;s characters in the sequences. The characters were seen posing on the show&#x27;s familiar beach setting. Some of the cast shots had already been used previously in the show&#x27;s promotional trailers. The sequence was designed to allow production to easily update the titles following cast departures and arrivals. The titles are only used for certain episodes due to creative reasons.

==Cast and characters==


When &quot;Home and Away&quot; began in January 1988, it initially focused on the &quot;Fletcher&quot; family – Tom (Roger Oakley) and his wife Pippa (Vanessa Downing), and their five foster children, Frank Morgan (Alex Papps), Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), Steven Matheson (Adam Willits), Lynn Davenport (Helena Bozich), and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) – who relocated from the city to live in the seaside town of Summer Bay. At the end of the first episode, Tom and Pippa take in their sixth foster child Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson).

The Fletchers bought the Summer Bay Caravan Park and moved into the Summer Bay House. They quickly built strong friendships with the locals, shopkeepers Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) and Ailsa Hogan (Judy Nunn) and retired carnival workers Neville (Frank Lloyd) and Floss McPhee (Sheila Kennelly), and town locals including surfer Matt Wilson (Greg Benson) and local yobbos Lance Smart and Martin Dibble, (Peter Vroom and Craig Thomson), whilst having a bitter rivalry with school headmaster Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn).

They were joined in the third episode by Alf Stewart&#x27;s rebellious daughter Roo Stewart (Justine Clarke) and within the first month by his sister Celia Stewart (Fiona Spence), who portrayed a similar busybody role to what Gwen Plumb played as Doris Peters in the pilot. 
While &quot;Home and Away&quot; features a mix of young cast members and older, more experienced actors, the show has always had a definite youth focus, with the younger characters dominating much of the storylines. Many of the cast have spent several years on &quot;Home and Away&quot;, including original cast member Judy Nunn who left the series in 2000 after 12 years playing the co-owner of Summer Bay&#x27;s diner. Other original cast members Norman Coburn played high school principal Donald Fisher until 2003, and Kate Ritchie departed in 2008 after 20 years playing Sally Fletcher. Both Coburn and Ritchie along with Ray Meagher (Alf Stewart) entered the 2002 Guinness World Records as the longest-serving actors in an Australian drama series. Meagher now holds that record alone and he is the only remaining original cast member in the show. Meagher along with Lynne McGranger (Irene Roberts), Ada Nicodemou (Leah Patterson-Baker) and Emily Symons (Marilyn Chambers) are the longest-serving cast members currently in &quot;Home and Away&quot;. In 2010, Georgie Parker joined the cast of &quot;Home and Away&quot; as Alf&#x27;s daughter Roo Stewart, originally played by Justine Clarke in 1988–89. Alf and Roo are currently the only two original characters in the series.

===Celebrity guest appearances===
Throughout the years, &quot;Home and Away&quot; has featured several guest appearances from celebrities such as John Farnham, Johanna Griggs, Sia, Michael Palin, Ian Thorpe, Lleyton Hewitt, Paulini, Nick Grimshaw, Eliza Doolittle, Ed Sheeran, Jessica Mauboy, Atomic Kitten, and &quot;Sunrise&quot; presenters Matt Shirvington and Natalie Barr.

==Broadcasting==
In Australia, &quot;Home and Away&quot; currently airs on the Seven Network at 7:00 pm from Mondays to Thursdays, going up against rival current affairs shows &quot;A Current Affair&quot; on the Nine Network, and &quot;The Project&quot; on Network Ten. The show is on air for approximately 45 weeks each year. Each season is usually broadcast from late January, and concludes with the season finale in late November (sometimes early February to early December), as it goes off air for two months during the Christmas and New Year period. It is typically commissioned at 230 episodes per season, but have sometimes commissioned less episodes in a season due to years where the Olympic games have aired on the Seven Network, putting the show into a mid-season break. All aired episodes shown during the week are available to watch on the Seven Network&#x27;s 7plus app, as part of their catch up TV service. They are also broadcast in an omnibus edition each Sunday on Seven&#x27;s digital multichannel 7Two.

When the show first began in 1988, it aired at 5:30 pm in Adelaide, at 6:00 pm in Melbourne and Sydney, at 6:30 pm in Brisbane, and at 7:00 pm in Perth. In January 1992, Seven moved &quot;Home and Away&quot; to the 7:00 pm timeslot across the network. On 3 November 2009, 7Two began airing repeat episodes of the show from the very beginning at 9:30 am, before moving to 9:00 am. Since its premiere, the show had been screened as a 22-minute episode each weeknight. However, beginning in March 2013, &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; began replacing &quot;Home and Away&quot; on Fridays to make way for Seven&#x27;s AFL coverage. Friday&#x27;s episodes of &quot;Home and Away&quot; began airing on Thursdays at 7:30 pm. By 2018, the &quot;Home and Away&quot; schedule often varied from week to week. Some weeks saw four episodes aired, with Thursdays often featuring two or three episodes back-to-back.

Between 2000 and 2021, &quot;Home and Away&quot; ceased broadcast mid-season for two weeks during the Summer Olympic Games and the episode to screen prior to this is referred to as an &#x27;Olympic cliffhanger&#x27;. An Olympic cliffhanger episode would usually involve increased drama, with the peak of a storyline, similar to a season finale episode, and the outcome of the cliffhanger to conclude after the Olympics. Olympic cliffhangers were broadcast in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2016, with the exclusion of 2012, as the Seven Network did not have the rights to televise the 2012 Summer Olympics; the most recent one was in 2021 due to the 2020 Summer Olympics taking place in that year after being postponed in 2020. In addition to this, &quot;Home and Away&quot; took a transmission breaks in 2018 and 2022 in order to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 Commonwealth Games, held on the Gold Coast and in Birmingham respectively.

On 22 March 2020, &quot;Home and Away&quot; suspended production over the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it was initially stated that the show would continue filming, the decision was later made to halt production, despite neither the cast nor crew testing positive for the virus. Furthermore, on 23 March, the show was removed from Seven&#x27;s schedule to make way for extended coverage on the pandemic. &quot;Home and Away&quot; returned in its usual timeslot on 13 April. On 12 May 2020, it was announced that the show would recommence production following the nine-week suspension. Filming was limited to the studio and resumed on 25 May.Some storylines were rewritten to limit close contact between the actors. On 19 July 2021, &quot;Home and Away&quot; was forced to postpone scheduled filming due to new COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in Sydney. The show was already on a two-week production break, which was then extended. In early August, a spokesperson for the show confirmed filming had resumed.

===International===
&quot;Home and Away&quot; has been sold to over 80 countries around the world, making it one of Australia&#x27;s successful media exports.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Home and Away&quot; was first broadcast on ITV from 11 February 1989 until 8 June 2000. (LWT and Yorkshire started the series a day later) &quot;Home and Away&quot; was shown twice a day on ITV, with a lunchtime showing and a tea time repeat; many regions aired it at around 5:10 pm, while others at 6:00 pm or even 6:30 pm. The show attracted up to eight million viewers, making it one of ITV&#x27;s top 30 rated programs. It also helped boost audiences for ITV&#x27;s regional and early evening news bulletins. During the show&#x27;s last year on ITV, &quot;Home and Away&quot; attracted an average audience of 4.4 million for its early-evening repeats. In February 2000, it was announced that &quot;Home and Away&quot; would be moving to rival Channel 5 after they bought the rights to the show in a £40m auction deal. ITV reportedly offered twice the amount by Channel 5, but the Seven Network in Australia were swayed by Channel 5&#x27;s commitment to the long-term future of the show in a deal of more than five years. After ITV&#x27;s contract ran out in July 2000, &quot;Home and Away&quot; went off air for 12 months as ITV had an exclusivity clause that prevented any other broadcaster from airing the show for a year. After a delay in screening, &quot;Home and Away&quot; made its debut on Channel 5 on 16 July 2001.

Channel 5 started airing new episodes of &quot;Home and Away&quot; at 6:00 pm with a repeat showing the following day at 12:30 pm. On 16 October 2006, the newly-established digital channel Five Life (now 5Star) introduced follow-up episodes at 6:30 pm after Channel 5&#x27;s broadcast. Channel 5 later started airing episodes at 1:15 pm each week day, with a repeat at 6:00 pm. The programme was also repeated on 5Star at 3:00pm and shown online via Demand 5. From July 2018, &quot;Home and Away&quot; was shown on Viacom&#x27;s Paramount Network, a channel operated in the UK by Channel 5, which has now ceased. On 24 September 2021, Ofcom approved Channel 5&#x27;s decision to broadcast their hour-long news show &quot;5 News&quot; from 5pm. The change led to &quot;Neighbours&quot; being moved to &quot;Home and Away&quot;&#x27;s usual 6pm slot, with the early evening repeat scrapped altogether. The 6:00 pm broadcast is now moved to 5Star in the same time slot, with the &quot;first look&quot; episode continuing to air at 6.30pm on the channel. In the UK, &quot;Home and Away&quot; usually begins a new season in late February or early March and takes its annual Christmas break mid November, before a season has been completed. It usually returns to screens in the first week of January with the remaining episodes of a season. As of November 2024, the show is seven weeks behind the Australian broadcast.

In September 2019, the pilot episode and the first 199 episodes of the first season were made available to stream on Amazon Prime Video in the United Kingdom. In November 2019, the final 29 episodes of the first season, and the first 171 episodes of the second season were added to the service, however, they are listed as &quot;Season 2&quot;.

In Ireland, &quot;Home and Away&quot; debuted on Monday, 3 October 1988 (with the pilot episode) as part of RTÉ&#x27;s re-launch of RTÉ2 as Network 2 - their secondary channel. Episodes screened at 6.30pm and in September 1997, a daytime episode was added at 1.25pm on RTÉ One with the 6.30pm episode becoming the replay of the daytime broadcast. A repeat of the week&#x27;s episodes is aired on Saturdays and Sundays on RTÉ2. Viewers in the Republic of Ireland are also able to catch up with episodes on the RTÉ Player. &quot;Home and Away&quot; is one of RTÉ&#x27;s most popular drama series. It was the most watched program of 2014 on the RTÉ Player with over four million viewers. As of 2014, the show is available to view in Northern Ireland on 5STAR daily at 3.30pm and 6.30pm as well as the regular Channel Five airings. The show is geo blocked in Northern Ireland via the SKY platform on both RTE1 and RTE2, yet it remains available on Irish platform Saorview for both Irish and Northern Irish viewers. RTE television airs episodes exactly as shown in Australia. &quot;Home and Away&quot; is consistently RTÉ&#x27;s most-watched soap opera, and in 2021, the series was streamed by 4.9 million viewers.

In New Zealand, &quot;Home and Away&quot; is broadcast on TVNZ2, with five episodes aired between 3.30pm to 6pm broadcasting every Sunday. A repeat of the episodes are spread across Monday to Friday, shown at 11:00 am each weekday. The TVNZ website also offers viewers the chance to watch episodes online with its OnDemand service. &quot;Home and Away&quot; is one of New Zealand&#x27;s most popular TV series and is one of TVNZ 2&#x27;s highest-rating shows. The show had previously aired on TV3 since 2002, where it consistently won high ratings for TV3 and helped boost audiences for their 6pm news bulletin. However, on 5 July 2013, the show&#x27;s European distributor Endemol cancelled its agreement with TV3, causing them to lose the right to broadcast &quot;Home and Away&quot;.

In the United States, &quot;Home and Away&quot; was first shown briefly on the FX cable network from the channel&#x27;s launch on 1 June 1994 to February 1995. Over two decades later, the show began streaming on the subscription service Hulu on 2 March 2015, beginning with the 2015 season. The service no longer receives new episodes, although the complete twenty-eighth season is currently available.

In Kenya, &quot;Home and Away&quot; was broadcast on the NTV network Monday to Friday at 6:00 pm.

==Storylines==
&quot;Home and Away&quot;″s storylines have ranged from mild to serious issues throughout its run. While the central stories revolve around fostering children, family and teenage problems, school problems and romances, the series has covered several controversial, adult-themed and detailed issues not suitable for young audiences, despite its early evening time of 7:00 pm. Storylines covered include abortion, accidental death, adultery, adoption, alcoholism, amnesia, amputation, arson, autism, bereavement, brain aneurysm, bullying, cancer, cage fighting, career problems, child abuse, cults, cyberbullying, domestic violence, depression, drink driving, drug overdose, drug trafficking and drug use, eating disorders, gambling addiction, health problems, hit-and-runs, HIV and AIDS, homosexuality, Huntington&#x27;s disease, incest, imprisonment, kidnapping, marriage problems, miscarriage, murder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), paedophilia, phantom pregnancy, pole dancing, post-natal depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, prostitution, racism, rape, revenge porn, robbery, self-harm, sex, sexual grooming, shootings (including drive-by shootings), stabbings, stalking, stroke, SIDS (cot death), stillbirth, suicide, surrogacy, teacher-student relationships, teenage pregnancy, terminal illness, and witness protection.

The show has also featured many natural disaster storylines, including a cyclone, storm, flood, landslide, earthquake, and bushfires. There have also been several storylines involving car, bus, plane and boating accidents. Furthermore, in addition to the show featuring scenes of moderate to strong violence in past episodes, the special episode, &quot;Home and Away: All or Nothing&quot;, which became available for online streaming in January 2017, was intended for &quot;adult-only&quot; viewing as it was described as the most violent episode of the entire series, as it contains scenes of strong violence.

==Rating and restrictions==
Since 1988, &quot;Home and Away&quot; has dealt with some controversial issues, despite being broadcast in a G-rated time block. Since 2008, every subsequent episode has been broadcast under the PG classification and often continues to exceed the rating. 7two aired the repeated early episodes under the PG rating, as do the streaming service 7plus. In New Zealand, the show was originally aired on TV3 in an edited 5:30 pm timeslot under the G classification. The series now airs uncut at 6:30 pm under the PG classification. In the UK, when the show aired on ITV, it was heavily edited for content that was deemed to be unsuitable for pre watershed viewing. Many episodes were edited to the point that some continuing storylines would not have made sense to UK viewers, with some episodes lasting barely 15 minutes to fit the timeslot. One episode was completely dropped, the school siege, and the 1996 season finale was very heavily edited. The closing credits were also dropped from around 1994 for timing reasons, leaving only the final scene in the closing credits, which meant that UK viewers never got to see the closing credits to the show at all. This all changed when the show moved to Channel Five in 2001, although very minor edits to some scenes remain, and the closing credits to the episodes were also reinstated. Home and Away is rated PS (recommended for a mature audience) in Ireland and has always aired with no edits. A 2023 episode was given an MA rating (18 certificate) for mature content on RTE Player.

===Controversies===
During the show&#x27;s first season in 1988, a rape storyline for the character Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) outraged the public and a protest erupted, as viewers deemed it an inappropriate subject to be covering in an early evening time slot.

In March 2007, the commercial television industry&#x27;s Annual Code Complaint Report revealed that &quot;Home and Away&quot; was the eighth most complained about show on Australian television, and the only drama series in the top ten complaint list. From 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, there were 23 written complaints about the show as viewers thought it was inappropriate for it to be shown in its 7:00 pm timeslot.

In 2007, the show breached broadcasting rules when they aired a number of episodes featuring Martha MacKenzie (Jodi Gordon) involved with pole-dancing in the G classification, as the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) said that these episodes should have been rated PG as they contained sexual scenes and references.

In March 2009, it was alleged that Seven had agreed to censor a then-upcoming lesbian kiss scene between Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) and Joey Collins (Kate Bell), after receiving many complaints from conservative groups and mothers who did not want their children exposed to same-sex relationships in a family show. Seven&#x27;s head of creative drama, Bevan Lee, later confirmed that the censorship allegations were in fact false and that the scene would still go to air as planned.

A 2010 episode which featured Martha McKenzie engaging in a sexual scene with Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) on a kitchen table was deemed &quot;too raunchy&quot; by a television watchdog in New Zealand, where, at the time, the series was aired in a G-rated timeslot.

In December 2023, fans of the serial branded a marketing campaign for a missing character as &quot;disrespectful&quot; and &quot;gross&quot;. The show&#x27;s series finale featured the kidnapping of Eden Fowler (Stephanie Panozzo). Channel Seven then launched a &quot;Bring Eden Home&quot; campaign featuring on-air promotions, a 1800 number to hear Eden&#x27;s last phone call, and the promotion of a missing person poster across social media. The campaign proved divisive among viewers, with some branding it &quot;epic&quot;, but others pointing out that it is insensitive to people going through a similar situation in real life.

==Reception==
===Popularity and viewership===
The launch of &quot;Home and Away&quot; in 1988 was hoped to help boost the Seven Network&#x27;s early evening ratings which had been underperforming in previous years. However, the show struggled to attract high ratings, particularly when compared to rival soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;, which was a huge ratings success at the time. By the end of 1988, &quot;Home and Away&quot;″s ratings had improved. In January 1992, when &quot;Neighbours&quot;&#x27; high-rating era was over, Seven moved &quot;Home and Away&quot; to the 7:00 pm timeslot, putting both shows up against each other. This caused Network Ten to move &quot;Neighbours&quot; to the 6.30 pm timeslot two months later. During the early 2000s, &quot;Home and Away&quot; was averaging 1.3 million viewers and in 2007, viewing figures rose to 1.4 million. However, by the end of the decade, the ratings had dropped to an average of 1.1 million viewers. During the early 2010s, viewing figures had further decreased to between 800,000 and 1 million an episode. In 2012, &quot;Home and Away&quot; was averaging 981,000 viewers, down from 1.039 million in 2011 and 1.021 million in 2010.

In 2015, the show began going through a serious ratings decline. A July 2015 report revealed that the ratings were down 14% compared to the first six months of 2014, which translates to about 140,000 fewer viewers per episode. On 6 July 2015, &quot;Home and Away&quot; ranked 16th in OzTAM&#x27;s overnight ratings with 750,000 viewers. The following night, the show fell to an even lower figure of 701,000 viewers. A writer for the Australian Associated Press stated that one of the reasons for the ratings decline could be &quot;the viewing habits of Gen Y, which the show is aimed at, have changed dramatically in recent times thanks to the launch of streaming services, Netflix, Stan and Presto. The exact age demographic that &quot;Home and Away&quot; targets are the same people who do not subscribe to appointment viewing. They prefer to watch shows when they want and don&#x27;t want to be dictated to by the commercial networks.&quot; A Seven spokeswoman commented that &quot;Home and Away&quot; was still performing well on digital and social platforms and that the overnight ratings were not the only measure of the show&#x27;s success.

In 2019, &quot;Home and Away&quot; returned at the later date of 18 February, after the summer series of cricket concluded. Pippa Doyle of 96FM reported that declining ratings in 2018 and Seven&#x27;s decision to push the show back had created doubt about its future on the network, and whether or not a timeslot change or a move to a multichannel was likely. The season returned to a series low of 620,000 viewers and ranked 13th for the night. The following night, the viewing figure fell to 581,000 and the show ranked 10th for the night. The first triple bill on 21 February pulled in 577,000 viewers and ranked 8th for the evening. The ratings for the triple bill episodes continued to fall from 524,000 to 414,000 viewers, and on 28 March 2019, the triple bill pulled in a series low of 383,000 viewers and ranked 14th for the night. April 2019 saw a slight rise in the viewing figures; the first episode of the month drew in 740,000 viewers and ranked 9th for that night.

The triple bill episodes continued to receive low ratings until the Thursday, 9 May episodes, which improved with 617,000 viewers. The following week&#x27;s triple bill saw a further rise with 627,000 viewers, while the episodes broadcast on 30 May received 638,000 viewers and ranked at 7th place for the evening. The 2020 season return saw a series low for a premiere with only 548,000 tuning in. The opening episode of the 2021 season saw a rating of 597,000. The 2021 season has seen an increase in ratings with most episodes attracting over 600,000. June saw a rise in viewers when the month peaked at 650,000 for episode which aired on 22 June, while in July, the show continued to receive steady ratings, and again saw a further rise in ratings with 657,000 viewers tuning in on 7 July. The 2021 Olympic return episode, which aired on 9 August 2021, attracted the highest rating in over two years, with 710,000 viewers, with an even higher increase of 733,000 viewers tuning in on 10 August. On 31 March 2022, two episodes achieved new series lows of 382,000 and 364,000 viewers respectively.

The 2023 season return was watched by an audience of 519,000 and was ranked 6th for the evening. The 8000th episode, which aired on 27 March 2023, drew an audience of 512,000 and ranked 10th for that night. The 2023 finale triple bill was coded by Seven into one figure which was an average of 395,000.

The opening episode of the 2024 season, which aired on 8 January, drew 411,000 viewers. From 29 January 2024, the show&#x27;s ratings began to rapidly increase; the episode airing that evening garnered an viewing figure of 804,000, while ratings rose to 902,000 on 6 May 2024. The highest rated episodes of the season, so far, drew in an audience of 950,000, on 15 July 2024, while the episode featuring the death of Felicity Newman (Jacqui Purvis), on 19 August 2024, garnered 953,000 viewers. The 2024 season finale, which aired on 20 November 2024, attracted a high viewership of 792,000. The 2025 season return, airing 13 January 2025, garnered 881,000 viewers.

===Awards and nominations===

&quot;Home and Away&quot; has received many awards and nominations throughout the years. The show has won 48 Logie Awards from 168 
nominations, making it the most awarded program in Logie history. In 2015, &quot;Home and Away&quot; was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame. The show has also won twelve Australian Writers&#x27; Guild Awards and five Australian Directors&#x27; Guild Awards.

==Merchandise and spin-offs==
Since 1988, &quot;Home and Away&quot; has generated a range of merchandise, including books, magazines, VHS tapes, DVDs and soundtracks. Various annuals and books about the show and its cast and characters were released in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Between 2003 and 2005, several fictional books by Leon F. Saunders and Jane Anderson were released and based on characters from &quot;Home and Away&quot;.

Another VHS tape, &quot;Home and Away: The Official Summer Bay Special&quot;, was released in 1996. It celebrated 2,000 episodes of the show and looked back at memorable moments throughout its earlier years. &quot;Home and Away: Secrets and the City&quot; and &quot;Home and Away: Hearts Divided&quot; were the first DVDs released in October 2003, and both contained exclusive episodes that were never aired on television. Two further DVDs, &quot;Home and Away: Romances&quot; and &quot;Home and Away: Weddings&quot; were released in November 2005 and March 2006, respectively, and featured clips from the most popular romances and weddings in the series&#x27; history. &quot;Romances&quot; featured the pilot episode, while &quot;Weddings&quot; featured two episodes containing Leah and Vinnie&#x27;s wedding as a bonus feature. Four soundtrack albums were released between 1996 and 2003 that featured music used on the show as well songs from some of the cast members.

&quot;Home and Away&quot; has also produced several spin-off episodes. &quot;headLand&quot; was a spin-off series focusing on a university. It ran from November 2005 until January 2006, when it was cancelled due to low ratings. In 2013, the show launched their first webisode series titled &quot;Home and Away Extras&quot;, which introduced new characters Andy (Tai Hara) and Josh Barrett (Jackson Gallagher) before they appeared on-air. The four-part websisode series was released on the show&#x27;s Yahoo!7 website from 7 August 2013. On 19 August 2015, it was announced that former cast members Dan Ewing (Heath Braxton) and Lisa Gormley (Bianca Scott) would be returning for a special spin-off episode titled &quot;Home and Away: An Eye for an Eye&quot;. The episode was commissioned specially for the local streaming service Presto and did not air on the Seven Network. It centred around the Braxton family and was a feature-length episode running for over an hour. &quot;Home and Away: An Eye for an Eye&quot; was made available to watch on Presto from 9 December 2015. Following the success of &quot;Home and Away: An Eye for An Eye&quot;, it was announced on 6 May 2016 that two more feature-length episodes had been commissioned. The first episode became available on 19 December 2016 and is titled &quot;Home and Away: Revenge&quot;. The second special, &quot;Home and Away: All or Nothing&quot;, became available for viewing on 26 January 2017.

From 25 November 2019, a web television series called &quot;Home and Away: Christmas in Summer Bay&quot; will begin airing weekly on video on demand and catch up TV service My5 in the UK, as the show takes its annual Christmas break. The series is presented by former &quot;Home and Away&quot; actor Jason Smith, who interviews the show&#x27;s cast members at various Summer Bay locations. The series also features clips from past episodes and behind-the-scenes footage. The series consisted of six episodes – &quot;The Summer Bay House&quot;, &quot;The Morgan Family&quot;, &quot;The Mangrove River Gang&quot;, &quot;A Surf Club Celebration&quot;, &quot;A &quot;Home and Away&quot; Family&quot; and &quot;&quot;Home and Away&quot; in 2020: New Decade, New Attitude&quot;.

<doc id="168459" wikidata="Q236469" url="?curid=168459" title="H.D.">
<text>Hilda Doolittle (September 10, 1886 – September 27, 1961) was an American modernist poet, novelist, and memoirist who wrote under the name H.D. throughout her life. Her career began in 1911 after she moved to London and co-founded the avant-garde Imagist group of poets with American expatriate poet and critic Ezra Pound. During this early period, her minimalist free verse poems depicting Classical motifs drew international attention. Eventually distancing herself from the Imagist movement, she experimented with a wider variety of forms, including fiction, memoir, and verse drama. Reflecting the trauma she experienced in London during the Blitz, H.D.&#x27;s poetic style from World War II until her death pivoted towards complex long poems on esoteric and pacifist themes.

H.D. was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to wealthy and educated parents who relocated to Upper Darby in 1896. Discovering her bisexuality, she had her first same-sex relationship while attending Bryn Mawr College between 1904 and 1906. After years of friendship, H.D. became engaged to Pound and followed him to London in 1911, where he championed her work. Their relationship soon fell apart, however, and H.D. instead married the Imagist poet Richard Aldington in 1913. In 1918, she met the novelist Bryher, who became her romantic partner and close friend until her death. An associate literary editor of the &quot;Egoist&quot; journal between 1916 and 1917, H.D. was published by &quot;The English Review&quot; and &quot;The Transatlantic Review&quot;. During World War I, both her brother and father died, and she separated from Aldington. She was treated by Sigmund Freud during the 1930s, as she sought to address and understand both her war trauma and bisexuality.

H.D. was keenly interested in Ancient Greek literature and published numerous Greek translations. Her poems routinely drew from Greek mythology and classical poets, from her earliest Imagist lyrics which depicted natural landscapes using Hellenistic motifs, to her 1950s long poem &quot;Helen in Egypt&quot; which reinterpreted the myth of the Trojan War. Raised Moravian by her family, and first introduced to occult and esoteric religious ideas by Pound in her youth, H.D. gradually developed a unique syncretic spiritual worldview. H.D.&#x27;s spiritual devotion intensified during and after World War II, and her syncretic ideas became the central focus of her later writing.

While H.D. wrote in a wide range of genres and modes over her career, during her lifetime she was known almost exclusively for her early Imagist poems. Following a reappraisal by feminist critics in the 1970s and 1980s, the significance of her late long poems and prose works was increasingly recognized, and she has come to be understood as a central figure in the history of modernist literature.

==Early life and education==
Hilda Doolittle was born on September 10, 1886, in the Moravian community of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Her father, Charles, was professor of astronomy at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, and her mother, Helen ( Wolle), was a member of the Moravian brotherhood. Hilda was one of six children, and had five brothers. When her father was appointed professor of astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania to take charge of the Flower Observatory in Philadelphia, the family moved to Upper Darby. 

She attended Friends&#x27; Central School in Philadelphia, and graduated in 1905. She delivered a commencement address, titled &quot;The Poet&#x27;s Influence&quot;. She enrolled at Bryn Mawr College in 1905 to study Greek literature, where she met the poets Marianne Moore and William Carlos Williams. After three terms of poor grades, H.D. withdrew from the college, and studied at home until 1910.

H.D. met poet Ezra Pound as a teenager in 1901. Pound became a lifelong friend and played a formative role in her development as a writer. In 1905, Pound and H.D. began an on-and-off relationship which included at least two engagements. Although his parents were in favor of the relationship, her parents strongly objected. In 1907, Pound gave her &quot;Hilda&#x27;s Book&quot;, a handmade vellum binding of twenty-five of his earliest love poems, which he dedicated to her.

In 1910, Doolittle began a relationship with Frances Josepha Gregg, a young female art student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. Inspired by Gregg, H.D. wrote her first published poems, modeled after the work of Theocritus. Some of her early work, including some children&#x27;s stories about astronomy, was published in New York newspapers and Presbyterian newsletters.

==Career==
===Imagism===

In May 1911, H.D. traveled to London on a vacation with Gregg and Gregg&#x27;s mother; Gregg returned home, but H.D. stayed to develop a career as a writer. Pound introduced her to his friends, including English writer Brigit Patmore. Patmore introduced her to Richard Aldington, who became her husband in 1913. The three lived in Church Walk in Kensington; Pound resided at no. 10, Aldington at no. 8, and H.D. at no. 6, and they gathered to work daily in the British Museum Reading Room.

Pound began to meet with other poets in London to discuss ideas for reforming contemporary poetry. Like most modernists in different artistic fields, she sought to &quot;make it new&quot;, which they accomplished by incorporating free verse, the brevity of the tanka and haiku forms, and the removal of unnecessary verbiage. Pound, H.D. and Aldington became known as the &quot;three original Imagists&quot; and published a three-point manifesto proclaiming the edicts of Imagism. According to Pound: 

During a 1912 conversation with Pound, H.D. told him that she found &quot;Hilda Doolittle&quot; to be an old fashioned and &quot;quaint&quot; name; he suggested the signature H.D., an abbreviation she kept for the remainder of her career. After he &quot;scrawled the name &quot;H.D. Imagiste&quot;&quot; at the bottom of the page of her poem &quot;Hermes of the Ways&quot;, she adopted H.D. as a pen. Privately he called her &quot;Dryad&quot;.

In October 1912, under the rubric &quot;Imagiste&quot;, Pound submitted a selection of H.D.&#x27;s poems to Harriet Monroe, founder of the magazine &quot;Poetry&quot;, which was founded that year. In the January 1913 issue, three of her poems were published, &quot;Hermes of the Ways&quot;, which Pound described as &quot;this is poetry&quot; after reading, &quot;Priapus: Keeper of Orchards&quot;, later renamed &quot;Orchard&quot;, and &quot;Epigram&quot;. Three poems by Aldington were also published in the issue. These early poems are informed by her reading of Classical Greek literature, especially of Sappho, an interest she shared with Aldington and Pound. Her Imagist poetry is characterized by sparse language and a classical, austere purity, exemplified by one of her earliest and best-known poems, &quot;Oread&quot; (1915):

The style was not without its critics. In a dedicated Imagist issue of &quot;The Egoist&quot; magazine in May 1915, Harold Monro, an English poet, labeled H.D. the &quot;truest Imagist&quot; but dismissed her early work as &quot;petty poetry&quot;, denoting &quot;either poverty of imagination or needlessly excessive restraint&quot;. In contrast, a 1927 review by the British modernist author and critic May Sinclair described &quot;Oreads brevity as a &quot;miracle&quot; and criticized Monro for not recognizing it.

===World War I and after===

In 1913, H.D. married Richard Aldington. The following year, Pound married the English artist Dorothy Shakespear. H.D. and Aldington&#x27;s only child, a daughter, was stillborn in 1915. He enlisted in the British Army, and she took his place as assistant editor of &quot;The Egoist&quot;, serving for the next year. In 1916, H.D.&#x27;s first book, &quot;Sea Garden&quot;, was published. Meanwhile, H.D. and Aldington drifted apart; he reportedly took a mistress in 1917, and she started a close but platonic relationship with the English writer D. H. Lawrence.

In 1918, H.D.&#x27;s brother Gilbert was killed in action. She moved to Cornwall that March with the Scottish composer Cecil Gray, a friend of Lawrence. She became pregnant with Gray&#x27;s child, but by the time she realized she was expecting, the relationship had cooled and Gray had returned to London. H.D. learned that her father died, having never recovered from Gilbert&#x27;s death. Despondent and sick with the Spanish flu, she came close to death during the birth of their daughter Perdita Aldington in 1919.

H.D. and Aldington tried to salvage their relationship but failed, in part because of his post-war post-traumatic stress disorder, but especially because of her pregnancy with Gray. They became estranged, and later divorced in 1938.

In July 1918, she met the wealthy English novelist Bryher (Annie Winifred Ellerman) in Cornwall, and the two began a relationship. Bryher was several years younger than H.D., a lesbian, and equally non-conformist. Both women were unusually tall, a fact that made H.D. self-conscious. The two lived together on and off until 1950. Both had numerous other partners, but Bryher was H.D.&#x27;s lover for the rest of her life. Bryher entered a marriage of convenience with the American writer and publisher Robert McAlmon, allowing him to use some of her wealth to fund his Paris-based Contact Press publishing house. In 1923, H.D. and Bryher traveled to Egypt for the opening of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb, before settling in Switzerland.

She wrote one of her few known statements on poetics, &quot;Notes on Thought and Vision&quot;, in 1919, although it was not published until 1982. In it, she speaks of poets (including herself) as belonging to a kind of elite group of visionaries with the power to &quot;turn the whole tide of human thought&quot;. During this time, she incorporated feminist ideas into her poems.

===Poetry cycles, novels and psychoanalysis===

Poetry and novella cycles are a feature of H.D.&#x27;s early 1920s writing. The first, &quot;Magna Graeca&quot;, consists of the poems &quot;Palimpsest&quot; (1921) and &quot;Hedylus&quot; (1928), which use classical settings to explore the role of a poet, particularly a female poet&#x27;s value in a patriarchal literary culture. The following cycles, &quot;HERmione&quot;, &quot;Bid Me to Live&quot;, &quot;Paint It Today&quot;, and &quot;Asphodel&quot; are largely autobiographical and preoccupied with the development of the female artist and the conflict between heterosexual and lesbian desire. The novellas &quot;Kora and Ka&quot; and &quot;The Usual Star&quot; from the &quot;Borderline&quot; cycle were published in 1933, followed by &quot;Pilate&#x27;s Wife&quot;, &quot;Mira-Mare&quot; and &quot;Nights&quot;.

In 1927, H.D.&#x27;s mother died. Bryher divorced McAlmon that year to marry Kenneth Macpherson, then H.D.&#x27;s male lover. Bryher, Macpherson and H.D. lived and traveled together through Europe together in what the New York School poet Barbara Guest termed a &quot;menagerie of three&quot;. Bryher adopted H.D.&#x27;s daughter, Perdita, while still married Macpherson: leading to the change of name to Perdita Macpherson. Later, Bryher named Perdita as heir to her will. They moved to the shores of Lake Geneva where they lived in a Bauhaus villa. H.D. became pregnant in 1928 and got an abortion.

In 1927, Bryher and Macpherson founded the monthly magazine, &quot;Close Up&quot;, as a venue for the discussion of cinema. That year the independent film cinema group POOL or Pool Group was established (largely funded with Bryher&#x27;s inheritance) and was managed by all three. In the 1930 POOL film &quot;Borderline&quot;, the actors were H.D. and Bryher and the couple Paul and Eslanda Robeson, the latter appearing as wife and husband. The film explores extreme psychic states, racism, and interracial relationships. H.D. wrote an explanatory pamphlet to accompany the film.

In 1928, H.D. began psychoanalysis with the Freudian Hanns Sachs. In 1933, she traveled to Vienna in 1933 for analysis with Sigmund Freud. Her interest in Freud&#x27;s theories began in 1909 after she read his works in its original German. She was referred to Freud by Bryher&#x27;s psychoanalyst because of her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler. World War I left her feeling shattered; she lost her brother in action, her father died in reaction to the loss of his son, her husband was traumatized by combat, and she believed that the shock at hearing of the sinking the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; indirectly caused the miscarriage of her child. H.D. undertook two series of analysis with Freud from March to May 1933 and from October to November 1934. At Freud&#x27;s suggestion, H.D. wrote &quot;Bid me to Live&quot;, which was not published until 1960, and in which she details her traumatic war experiences. &quot;Writing on the Wall&quot;, an impressionistic memoir of the sessions and a reevaluation of the importance of his psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with &quot;Trilogy&quot; and published in 1944; in 1956, it was published together with &quot;Advent&quot;, a journal of the analysis, under the title &quot;Tribute to Freud&quot;.

===World War II===

Hilda and Bryher spent World War II in London. While there, her daughter Perdita became a secretary of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Between 1941 and 1943 H.D. wrote &quot;The Gift&quot;, a short memoir of her childhood in Bethlehem that details the people and events that shaped her. She began the &quot;Trilogy&quot; series in 1942, comprising three long, unrhyming, and complex volumes of poems: &quot;The Walls do not Fall&quot; (1944), &quot;Tribute to the Angels&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Flowering of the Rod&quot; (1946). H.D. wrote the first while living in London and details her reactions to the Blitz and World War II. The following two books compare the ruins of London to those of ancient Egypt and classical Greece; the former of which she had seen during a 1923 visit. The opening lines of &quot;The Walls do not Fall&quot; clearly and immediately signal her break with her earlier work:

H.D.&#x27;s relationship with Bryher ended just after the war, although they remained in contact. She moved to Switzerland where she had a severe mental breakdown in the spring of 1946 and took refuge in a clinic until the autumn of that year. She lived in Switzerland for the rest of her life. In the late 1950s, she underwent further treatment with the psychoanalyst Erich Heydt, who supported her while she wrote &quot;End to Torment&quot;, a memoir of her relationship with Pound.

===Later work and death===

H.D.&#x27;s later work drew heavily from her eclectic blend of Christianity, Ancient Greek and Egyptian religion, Spiritualism, Hermeticism, Martinism and Cabala via the works of Robert Ambelain, alchemy, tarot, astrology, and Freudian psychoanalysis. She used the medium of the long poem to explore and communicate this mix of spiritualities.

Between 1952 and 1955, while in her 60s, H.D. wrote her longest poem, &quot;Helen in Egypt&quot;. It was not published until just before her death in 1961. It is based Euripides&#x27; trilogy drama &quot;Helen&quot;, but imagines Helen of Troy&#x27;s life after the fall of Troy and her relocation to Egypt. The poem reconstructs the source material into a feminist reinterpretation, and has thus been described as &quot;exploring ... [but] ... concluding&quot; the themes as her earlier work. &quot;Helen in Egypt&quot;s long form and wide historical span has been seen as a response to Pound&#x27;s &quot;Cantos&quot;, which she admired. In &quot;End to Torment&quot; she approved of Norman Holmes Pearson&#x27;s labeling of &quot;Helen in Egypt&quot; as &quot;her &#x27;cantos.

A compilation of her late poems were published posthumously in 1972 under the title &quot;Hermetic Definition&quot;. The book takes as its starting points her love for a man 30 years her junior and the line &quot;so slow is the rose to open&quot; from Pound&#x27;s &quot;Canto 106&quot;. &quot;Sagesse&quot;, which she wrote in bed having broken her hip in a fall, serves as a coda to &quot;Trilogy&quot;, being partly written in the voice of a young female Blitz survivor who finds herself living in fear of the atom bomb. &quot;Winter Love&quot; was written during the same period as &quot;End to Torment&quot; and uses as narrator the Homeric figure of Penelope to restate the material of the memoir in poetic form. At one time, H.D. considered appending this poem as a coda to &quot;Helen in Egypt.&quot;

She returned to the U.S. in 1960, when she was the first woman to be recognized with the Award of Merit Medal for poetry from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

==Death==
H.D was left gravely ill after a stroke in July 1961 and was taken to the Klinik Hirslanden in Zürich, where she died on September 27. She was survived by Bryher and her daughter Perdita. 

Her ashes were brought to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where they were buried in the family plot in Nisky Hill Cemetery on October 28, 1961. Her headstone is inscribed with lines from her early poem &quot;Epitaph&quot;:

==Appraisal==
During her career, H.D. wrote a large number of works in a variety of styles and formats. They evolved from lyrics written in the 1910s, such as &quot;Sea Garden&quot;, through her early period Imagist poems and free verse, to her complex long poems &quot;Trilogy&quot; (written 1942-1944), &quot;Helen in Egypt&quot; (1952-1955), &quot;Vale Ave&quot; (1957), and the 1971 collection &quot;Hermetic Definition&quot;, consisting of the title poem (1961), &quot;Sagesse&quot; (1957), and &quot;Winter Love&quot; (1959). During her lifetime, her later poems, novels, and numerous translations of classical works were rarely studied or taught, and only her early poems, &quot;Oread&quot; and &quot;Heat&quot;, appeared in anthologies. For decades, her reputation was as an Imagist who peaked in the 1920s; a consignment the literary critic Susan Friedman believes placed H.D. as &quot;a captive and in prison&quot;. In 1972, Hugh Kenner wrote that assigning her as just an Imagist poet was similar to evaluating &quot;five of the shortest pieces in &quot;Harmonium&quot; [as equal to] the life&#x27;s work of Wallace Stevens&quot;. Although Pound claimed in the 1930s that he formed the Imagist movement &quot;to launch H.D. and Aldington before either had enough stuff for a volume&quot;, several key poets within the group, including Amy Lowell, viewed H.D. as the main focal point and innovator in achieving the group&#x27;s &quot;revolution in taste&quot;.

H.D. was aware early on that both the strictures of Imagism and Pound&#x27;s controlling temperament would constrain her creative voice, and by the mid-1920s her work had developed beyond Imagism. In 1990, the feminist scholar Gertrude Reif Hughes described her as &quot;physically fragile-looking in a traditionally feminine way&quot;. H.D. understood the danger of objectification, particularly as the only woman in a group of men in her circle. She worried about being perceived merely as their private muse, which she feared affected her public image and standing as a poet and prominent intellectual in her own right. Female objectification is explored in &quot;HER&quot;, where she writes of &quot;a classic dilemma for woman: the necessity to choose between being a muse to another or being an artist oneself&quot;. Although Pound was a lifelong champion, a number of other early Imagists, including Aldington and Lawrence, attempted to diminish her importance and consign her to a minor role. Similarly, while her mid-period poems and writings explore mysticism, esotericism and the occult, in a similar manner to poets such as W. B. Yeats (with whom she was personally acquainted), H.D. was rarely read before the 1970s.

Although the critic Linda Wagner wrote in 1969 that one of the &quot;ironies of contemporary literature [is] that H.D. is remembered chiefly for her Imagist work given that few contemporary writers have written so much in their maturity&quot;; her reappraisal only began in the 1970s and 1980s. This coincided with the emergence of feminist interest in her work, followed by queer studies scholars. Specifically, critics such as Friedman (1981), Janice Robertson (1982) and Rachel DuPlessis (1986) began to challenge the standard view of English-language literary modernism as based on only the work of male writers, and gradually restored H.D. to a more significant position in the movement. In 1990, Hughes wrote that H.D.&#x27;s mid-century poems, like those of Gwendolyn Brooks, anticipate second-wave feminism, and explore issues raised in Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s 1949 book &quot;The Second Sex&quot;. According to Hughes, H.D.&#x27;s work challenges patriarchal privilege and seeks to &quot;revise the mentalities that sponsor them&quot;. She notes in particular how in &quot;Helen in Egypt&quot;, H.D. positions Helen as &quot;the protagonist, instead of the pawn&quot;, in such a way as to counter the &quot;conservative and often misogynistic&quot; tendencies which Hughes finds in the modernism of Pound and T. S. Eliot.

H.D.&#x27;s writings have served as a model for a number of more recent female poets working in the modernist and post-modernist traditions, including Barbara Guest, the Black Mountain poet Hilda Morley and the &quot;Language&quot; poet Susan Howe. The Anglo-American poet Denise Levertov wrote of her deep appreciation for H.D., particularly for her long poems on mystical themes, writing that H.D. &quot;showed the way to penetrate mystery, [...] to &quot;enter into&quot; darkness, mystery, so that it is experienced&quot;. Her influence is not limited to female poets; many male writers and poets, including Robert Duncan, have acknowledged their debt. Duncan placed H.D. at the center of his lengthy study of modernist poetry in general, titled &quot;The H.D. Book&quot;, and frequently lectured on her work. The Dutch poet H.C. ten Berge wrote his 2008 &quot;Het vertrapte mysterie&quot; (&quot;The Trampled Mystery&quot;) in memory of H.D.

Passages from &quot;Trilogy&quot; were widely shared across electronic discussion lists in the days following the September 11th attacks.

During World War II, H.D.&#x27;s daughter Perdita was involved in breaking codes at Bletchley Park, and later worked for the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency. In the OSS, she served with Graham Greene and James Angleton. H.D.&#x27;s grandchildren include the author and Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner.

<text>The Progressive Democrats (, literally &quot;The Democratic Party&quot;), commonly referred to as the PDs, were a conservative liberal political party in Ireland. The party&#x27;s history spanned 24 years, from its formation in 1985 to its dissolution in 2009.

Launched on 21 December 1985 by Desmond O&#x27;Malley and other politicians who had split from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats took liberal positions on divorce, contraception and other social issues. The party also supported economic liberalisation, advocating measures such as lower taxation, fiscal conservatism, privatisation and welfare reform. The party performed strongly at its first election, the 1987 general election, winning 14 seats in Dáil Éireann and capturing almost 12 per cent of the popular vote to temporarily surpass the Labour Party as Ireland&#x27;s third-largest political party.

Although the Progressive Democrats never again won more than 10 seats in the Dáil, it formed coalition governments with Fianna Fáil during the 26th Dáil (1989–1992), the 28th Dáil (1997–2002), the 29th Dáil (2002–2007) and the 30th Dail (2007–2009). These successive years as the government&#x27;s junior coalition partner gave the party an influence on Irish politics and economics disproportionate to its small size. The party was credited with shaping the low-tax, pro-business environment that contributed to Ireland&#x27;s Celtic Tiger economic boom during the 1990s and 2000s; however, it was also blamed for contributing to the post-2008 Irish financial and economic crisis.

Mary Harney became party leader in 1993, the first woman to lead any major Irish political party. She stepped down in 2006 and was succeeded by Michael McDowell, who led the party into the 2007 general election, where it lost six of its eight seats in the Dáil. The party never recovered from this electoral collapse. On 8 November 2008, delegates to a special conference in Mullingar voted to disband the party, which was formally dissolved on 20 November 2009. The two Progressive Democrats elected to the 30th Dáil, Harney and Noel Grealish, continued to support the government as independent TDs. Harney continued to serve as Minister for Health and Children until January 2011.

==History==
===Foundation===
The party was founded in 1985 by Desmond O&#x27;Malley, a former senior minister in Fianna Fáil governments under Jack Lynch and Charles Haughey. O&#x27;Malley was a strong opponent of Haughey and was involved in a number of leadership heaves against Haughey, who was popular and controversial in equal measure. O&#x27;Malley had lost the Fianna Fáil whip in the Dáil in 1984 because of his support for the New Ireland Forum report and was finally expelled from Fianna Fáil early in 1985 for &quot;conduct unbecoming&quot; a member when he refused to support Fianna Fáil&#x27;s opposition to the introduction of contraception.

At the party&#x27;s launch in December 1985, O&#x27;Malley was joined by Mary Harney, who had lost the Fianna Fáil parliamentary whip, and by former Fine Gael activist Michael McDowell. In the weeks after its launch, Fianna Fáil TDs Bobby Molloy and Pearse Wyse, and Fine Gael TD Michael Keating also joined the party. The defectors were dissatisfied with the policies of existing parties, which they viewed as being insufficiently liberal, both economically and on social issues such as divorce and contraception. In Ireland in 1985, when personal income above £7,300 per annum was taxed at 60 percent, the country&#x27;s national debt was 104 percent of GDP, unemployment was 17.3 percent, the Progressive Democrats&#x27; liberal reformist agenda was considered especially radical.

McDowell suggested a number of names for the party, including New Democrats, New Republic, National Party, Radical Party; Progressive Democrats was not among his suggestions. O&#x27;Malley declared that the party ought to be pro-enterprise, in favour of economic participation by all, liberal and pluralist, hostile to institutional dependency, favourable to incentives, pro self-reliance, deregulating where possible, anti-monopoly and pro-competition, low-key on nationalism, stressing &quot;real republican&quot; values rather than &quot;nationalistic myths&quot;.

===Electoral breakthrough and coalition===

At the 1987 general election the new party won 14 seats and 11.9% of the vote, becoming the third-largest party in the 25th Dáil. The Progressive Democrats formed the second-largest opposition party under difficult circumstances. The minority Fianna Fáil government introduced some of the economic reforms that the Progressive Democrats had recommended. Fianna Fáil was however largely supported by Fine Gael where the economy was concerned, and so the Progressive Democrats had difficulty being effective in opposition.

After the 1989 general election, the party had only six seats but formed a coalition government with Fianna Fáil, with Charles Haughey as Taoiseach, which was the first time Fianna Fáil entered coalition. PD leader Desmond O&#x27;Malley served as Minister for Industry and Commerce.

In 1990, a scandal broke surrounding Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Brian Lenihan Snr&#x27;s role in pressuring President Patrick Hillery not to allow then-Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald to dissolve the Dáil in 1982. The Progressive Democrats gave Haughey an ultimatum—unless Lenihan was removed from cabinet, they would pull out of the coalition and support a no-confidence motion in the government. Haughey tried to force Lenihan to resign, and sacked him when he refused. A year later, after former Justice Minister Seán Doherty claimed that Haughey had authorised tapping journalists&#x27; phones in the 1980s, the PDs told Haughey that they would tear up the coalition agreement if he remained as Taoiseach. With O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s approval, Haughey stood down as Taoiseach in February 1992. He was replaced by Albert Reynolds, and O&#x27;Malley retained his cabinet post.

===Harney leadership===
After the collapse of Reynolds&#x27; first administration later in 1992, O&#x27;Malley retired from the leadership of the party. Following the 1992 general election, John Dardis (Agricultural Panel) and Cathy Honan (Industrial and Commercial Panel) were elected to Seanad Éireann as part of an election pact with their politically polar opposites Democratic Left. Mary Harney became the new leader after a bitter electoral contest with Pat Cox who later left the party. Harney was the first woman to lead any of the major Irish political parties. Harney served as Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) from May 1997 until September 2006 after a return to government in coalition with Fianna Fáil.

In the 2002 general election the party doubled its Dáil seats to eight, although its share of the vote declined slightly to 4%. In total, the Progressive Democrats participated in coalition governments four times, on each occasion with Fianna Fáil (1989–1992; 1997–2002; 2002–2007; 2007–2009), and also with the Green Party from 2007 to 2009.

In 2005 Michael McDowell publicly took a firmly anti-republican position and named Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and Martin Ferris as members of the IRA Army Council. The convention in Irish politics at this time was not to accuse Sinn Féin politicians of being members of the Army Council, in doing so McDowell broke with convention. He said that until the IRA disbanded Sinn Féin could not be involved in government, North or South.

===McDowell leadership and demise===
On 7 September 2006, Mary Harney announced that she was stepping down as leader of the Progressive Democrats. She expressed a wish to stay on as Minister for Health. On 10 September, Michael McDowell was elected unopposed as Party Leader, having been nominated by Tom Parlon and that nomination being seconded by Liz O&#x27;Donnell. Liz O&#x27;Donnell became Deputy Leader and Tom Parlon became Party President.

The 2007 general election was a disastrous one for the party. The Progressive Democrats lost six of their eight seats in the 166-seat Dáil. Among those to lose their seats were party leader Michael McDowell, deputy leader Liz O&#x27;Donnell and party president Tom Parlon. McDowell retired from public life after he lost his seat, and Mary Harney was asked by the party chairperson to resume the role of party leader. The following month, Tom Parlon announced that he was also leaving public life and would take up the position of Director General of the Irish Construction Industry Federation.

A committee headed by former Senator John Dardis recommended in September 2007 that the role of leader be taken on by a senator or councillor (although the party rules then required that the position must be held by a TD). A meeting of the party&#x27;s General Council on 16 February 2008 changed the rules to allow any senator, councillor or any party member with the support of 20 other members to stand for the party&#x27;s leadership and on 17 April, Senator Ciarán Cannon was elected leader, defeating fellow Senator Fiona O&#x27;Malley.

The party&#x27;s two remaining TDs, Mary Harney and Noel Grealish, entered into coalition government with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in the 30th Dáil. The party never recovered from this electoral collapse. On 8 November 2008, with all parliamentary members (two TDs and two Senators) and founder Desmond O&#x27;Malley united in the opinion that the party was no longer politically viable, delegates to a special conference in Mullingar voted by 201 votes to 161 to bring the Progressive Democrats to an end. In January 2009 the party was still operating and in receipt of state funding, including a Party Leader&#x27;s Allowance paid to Minister Mary Harney, but had ceased to receive funding by the following June. In March 2009, Noel Grealish became caretaker leader after Cannon&#x27;s decision to join Fine Gael, and he retained the role for the remaining months of the party&#x27;s existence.

The archives of the Progressive Democrats party were presented to University College Dublin on 10 June 2009. At least 20 former Progressive Democrats councillors won seats on county, city and town councils at the 2009 local elections. Some were elected as Fine Gael candidates, some as Fianna Fáil and others as independents.

===Later events===
At the 2011 general election 11 former Progressive Democrats members stood as candidates for the Dáil in a country-wide spread of constituencies. Three former PD members were elected: Mary Mitchell O&#x27;Connor (PD Councillor 2004–2008) was elected in Dún Laoghaire for Fine Gael, Ciarán Cannon (PD Senator 2007–2009 / party leader 2008–2009) was elected in Galway East for the same party, while Noel Grealish (PD TD 2002–2009 / caretaker party leader 2009) was re-elected as an independent TD for Galway West. Several ex-PD members stood for election to Seanad Éireann in 2011. Cáit Keane was elected as a Fine Gael senator; she had served on South Dublin County Council for the PDs between 1991 and 2008, and had stood for election in the Dublin South-Central constituency for the PDs in 1992, 1994 and 1997.

As of 2024, Noel Grealish remains in the Dáil, having been re-elected as an independent in 2011, 2016, 2020 and 2024.

==Ideology and policies==
The Progressive Democrats were described as conservative liberals, liberal, and classical liberal.

The party&#x27;s economic policies were based on neoliberalism. They supported the freedom of private enterprise and the lowering of taxes. They generally favoured privatisation; for example, they supported the privatisation of the previously state-owned airline Aer Lingus and communications company Telecom Éireann. They were also part of the break-up of airports company Aer Rianta and unsuccessfully lobbied for a private, competing second terminal in Dublin Airport. As acting PD leader and Minister for Health, Mary Harney was involved in the controversial extension of private-sector influence in health care. She pursued a policy of co-location of private hospitals on public hospital grounds and is seen as sympathetic to the privatisation of health insurance. However, they opposed their coalition partner&#x27;s plans to privatise airports company Aer Rianta on the grounds that a private monopoly would be worse than a public monopoly.

The party was a strong supporter of low taxation. As the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) stated in 2002: &quot;On balance, budgets over the past 10 to 20 years have been more favourable to high income groups than low income groups, but particularly so during periods of high growth&quot;. While the party was in government since 1997, the lower rate of income tax fell from 26% to 20% and the upper rate from 48% to 41%.

They supported low corporation tax because they believe it encouraged business growth and enabled private enterprise to be rewarded. The party often claimed these policies were in part responsible for the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot; economy. Dermot McAleese, emeritus professor of economics at Trinity College Dublin, says that the emergence of the Progressive Democrats in 1985 may have had a more positive influence on the economy than some recognise. He argues the Irish low-tax, pro-business economy is based in large part on Progressive Democrat policies. &quot;They proved that there was a constituency for this, and they gave the intellectual power to it.&quot;

The party leaders rejected the idea that they are ruled by ideology alone. Former party leader Michael McDowell has said that he sees liberalism as not being on the left-right spectrum as it is a mix of the ideals of both. Mary Harney, on becoming health minister said &quot;I don&#x27;t get my politics from any ideology, I get it from my experience and common sense&quot;. Yet Harney was a controversial minister who attempted to extend private influence in the health service and McDowell&#x27;s campaign in the general election included particularly strong attacks on Irish left-wing parties.

Despite having in its ranks the openly gay Colm O&#x27;Gorman, the Progressive Democrats did not support same-sex marriage. Instead, they claimed to propose legislating for civil union; however attempts by the Labour Party to legislate for civil unions in the previous Dáil had been forestalled by PD Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Michael McDowell, due to his insistence that non-sex relationships be recognised too. The Progressive Democrats again voted down the same bill in the 29th Dáil.

Both Progressive Democrats and other commentators have suggested that the party had a greater influence on government policy since 1997 than might be expected from its size. This belief appears to have some basis – as of September 2004 the party controlled two of the most important cabinet positions (Justice and Health), despite having less than one-tenth of the seats of its coalition partner Fianna Fáil.

In a 2000 speech to the American Bar Association, the then party leader Mary Harney appeared to express a desire that Ireland become &quot;closer to Boston than Berlin&quot;, adopting US free-market models for economic development, health, education, and other services rather than European Continental models because she believed that while continental countries (such as Germany and France) have more equality, they had bad economies and high unemployment.

However, in the midst of the ongoing Irish financial crisis, many opponents began to question the legacy of the Progressive Democrats. In a review of the Department of Finance Robert Wright, a Canadian economist, singled out the policies of the PDs and Fianna Fáil&#x27;s 2002 election manifestos as contributing significantly to the 2008 property market crash.

<text>The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP; ) is a social democratic and Irish nationalist political party in Northern Ireland. The SDLP currently has eight members in the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLAs) and two members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.

The SDLP party platform advocates Irish reunification and, pending the unity of all the people of Ireland and while the northern jurisdiction remains part of the United Kingdom, further devolution of powers. 

During the Troubles, the SDLP was the most popular Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland, but since the Provisional IRA ceasefire in 1994, it has lost ground to the republican party Sinn Féin, which in 2001 became the more popular of the two parties for the first time. Established during the Troubles, a significant difference between the two parties was the SDLP&#x27;s rejection of violence, in contrast to Sinn Féin&#x27;s then-support for (and organisational ties to) the Provisional IRA and physical force republicanism.

==History==
===Foundation and early history (1970–1972)===
The party was founded on 21 August 1970, when six Stormont MPs (Gerry Fitt, Republican Labour Party; Austin Currie, Nationalist Party; Paddy Devlin, Northern Ireland Labour Party; John Hume, Ivan Cooper and Paddy O&#x27;Hanlon, Independent) and one Senator (Paddy Wilson, Republican Labour), joined to form a new party. They were joined on 10 November by a second Senator (Claude Wilton, Ulster Liberal Party), bringing the total parliamentary party to eight members. Gerry Fitt was chosen to lead the new party while John Hume was appointed its deputy. Paddy Wilson also became the party’s first General Secretary.

The smaller National Democratic Party dissolved itself in October of that year and encouraged all its members to join the new party. Additionally, individual members and branches from other parties joined including from the Irish Labour Party, Nationalist Party, Northern Ireland Labour Party, Republican Labour Party and Ulster Liberal Party.

The SDLP contested its first election in a by-election for the Belfast St. Anne’s seat on 12 November. Their candidate Gerry Laverty won 24.2% of the vote in the traditionally Unionist seat.

The SDLP initially rejected the Nationalist Party&#x27;s policy of abstentionism and sought to fight for civil rights within the Stormont system. However, the SDLP quickly came to the view that Stormont was unreformable, refusing to attend the state opening on 18 June 1971, and withdrawing altogether in response the shooting dead of Seamus Cusack and Desmond Beattie in Derry on 8 July.

On 15 August the SDLP announced they would lead a Campaign of Civil Disobedience in response to the introduction of internment the previous week. This involved the withdrawal of SDLP representatives from public bodies, the organisation of a rent and rates strike and SDLP MPs participating in a 48 hour hunger strike outside 10 Downing Street.

The SDLP held its first annual conference in Dungiven on 23 October that year. The party adopted its draft constitution, Eddie McGrady was elected the party’s first chairman while Sheila Carson becomes its first secretary. Several motions were passed including committing the party firmly to socialism, supporting the parliamentary party’s decision to withdraw from Stormont and condemning the 11-plus.

After the abolition of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1972, the SDLP emerged as the largest party representing the nationalist community. On 20 September the party issued its first major policy document, entitled &quot;Towards a New Ireland&quot;. It recommended that the British Government issue a declaration that it would recognise that Ireland is better off united, and that as an interim proposal Northern Ireland should be administered jointly by the British and Irish Governments. It also proposed the establishment of a National Senate drawn equally from a devolved Assembly in Belfast and the Oireachtas in Dublin to plan for the integration of the island.

=== Sunningdale Agreement (1973–1974) ===
The first major electoral contest for the SDLP were elections to Northern Ireland’s 26 new district councils, held on 30 May 1973. The SDLP won 13.4% of the vote and 82 seats, becoming the second largest party in Northern Ireland and the largest party in the districts of Derry, Magherafelt and Newry and Mourne. Other nationalist parties failed to achieve much success, leaving the SDLP as the largest party representing the nationalist community.

Paddy Wilson, the SDLP’s General Secretary and councillor in the new Belfast City Council was murdered on the 26 June, two days before the election to the new Northern Ireland Assembly. Wilson and another woman, Irene Andrews, were killed by the UFF, a codename for the UDA. John White was later convicted for his part in the killings.

Following publication of the British Government’s White Paper, elections were held to the new Northern Ireland Assembly on 28 June, where the party won 19 out of 75 seats and once again emerged as the voice of the nationalist community, increasing its vote share to 22% of the vote. Negotiations occurred throughout October and November on the formation of a new power-sharing Executive to govern Northern Ireland with the SDLP, UUP and Alliance taking part. On 21 November Northern Ireland Secretary of State, William Whitelaw, announced that agreement had been reached on the composition and functions of the new Executive, with the SDLP entitled to four of the eleven members and a further two non-Executive office holders. Agreement was still to be reached on many other aspects of the White Paper, particularly regarding the Council of Ireland.

Following discussions between the British Prime Minister and Irish Taoiseach, as well as the political parties, it was announced on 9 December at Sunningdale that an agreement had been reached on the remaining elements of the White Paper, including the implementation of a Council of Ireland.

On 1 January 1974 the Northern Ireland Executive took office, with Gerry Fitt as Deputy Chief Executive, John Hume as Minister of Commerce, Paddy Devlin as Minister of Health and Social Services and Austin Currie as Minister of Housing, Local Government and Planning.

The SDLP faced its first Westminster election shortly afterwards in February in what became a referendum on power-sharing. The anti-power-sharing Unionists united under the UUUC banner and won 11 seats, with Gerry Fitt being the only pro-power-sharing MP returned, dealing a critical blow to the fledgling Executive. The Executive eventually collapsed after 5 months following several weeks of the Ulster Workers’ Council strike.

=== Searching for agreement (1975–1980) ===
Attempting to find agreement, the Secretary of State called elections for a Constitutional Convention on 1 May 1975, for which the SDLP won 17 seats and 24% of the vote. The UUUC however won a majority of seats and votes, the Constitutional Convention made no progress and the British Government brought it to an end in early 1976. Later that year on 1 September SDLP member Denis Mullen was shot dead at his home.

Following the failure of the Constitutional Convention the SDLP continued searching for a long term solution, at times engaging in talks with the UUP. In 1977 the party issued a policy document titled &quot;Facing Reality&quot;. This called for the party to put a stronger emphasis on the &quot;Irish dimension&quot;. In response to this perceived move away from the party’s Labour values Paddy Devlin, then party chairperson, resigned from the party.

In 1978 SDLP deputy leader John Hume presented his proposal for an &quot;agreed Ireland&quot;. In contrast to the two main options at the time of full integration into Britain or full withdrawal, Hume’s solution proposed the British government declaring that its aim was to bring the main traditions in Ireland together in reconciliation.

After years of little progress 1979 brought considerably more action for the SDLP. A vote of confidence in the Labour Government failed in March that year. Gerry Fitt abstained on the vote as the Government had failed to act on the Bennett Report into RUC interrogation techniques. In the following general election, the Conservatives came to power in Westminster and Fitt held his seat in Belfast West.

In June that year the first direct election to the European Parliament were held. The SDLP candidate was John Hume who won a seat with 25% of the first preference vote. He went on to sit in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.

The new Conservative Secretary of State, Humphrey Atkins, invited Northern Ireland parties including the SDLP to a conference on the future of Northern Ireland. There was intense debate in the SDLP whether or not to attend a conference which would not discuss any all-island dimension, with Gerry Fitt wanting to attend regardless of any discussion on an &quot;Irish dimension&quot; while many others, including John Hume, refusing to attend. As a result of this dispute Fitt resigned as SDLP leader. On 28 November John Hume was elected as his replacement, and Seamus Mallon became his deputy.

The SDLP eventually made the decision to attend the Atkins conference, on the condition that there would be parallel discussions involving the &quot;Irish dimension&quot;. These talks, like others, failed to reach agreement.

=== Entry of Sinn Féin (1981–1982) ===
Following the death of Fermanagh and South Tyrone MP Frank Maguire and the selection of hunger striker Bobby Sands as a candidate in the following by-election the SDLP decided to withdraw Austin Currie as their candidate. The election was held on 9 April and Bobby Sands won the seat by a slim margin. As the strikes went on, SDLP leader John Hume met Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to ask that she concede some of the demands of the hunger strikers. No agreement was forthcoming. When Sands died, the SDLP also stood aside for Owen Carron, who also won the seat by a narrow margin.

The hunger strikes also had an impact on the electoral fortunes of the SDLP. In local government elections in 1981 the SDLP vote share fell to 17.5% as nationalist voters began to support more candidates from parties like the Irish Independence Party and Irish Republican Socialist Party.

In Spring 1982 Northern Ireland Secretary of State Jim Prior proposed “rolling devolution” by which a consultative Assembly be established. John Hume labelled the proposals as unworkable as they offered no realistic prospect of power-sharing or offered any role for the Irish Government.

In May of that year the SDLP secured a seat in Seanad Éireann as new Taoiseach Charles Haughey appointed SDLP Deputy Leader Seamus Mallon to serve as a voice for Northern nationalists.

As the elections to the Assembly approached the party announced that although it would contest the election, none of its representatives would take their seats. The election, held on 20 October, mirrored the SDLP’s performance in the local elections the previous year as the party won 18.8% of the vote and took 14 seats. The decision by Sinn Féin to stand also had an impact on the SDLP vote as the party, considered to be the political wing of the Provisional IRA, took 10.1% of the vote and 5 seats.

As a result of Seamus Mallon’s membership of Seanad Éireann he was removed as a member of the Assembly and a by-election was held in Armagh the following spring. The SDLP called for a boycott and amidst low turnout the UUP won the election.

=== New Ireland Forum (1983–1984) ===
In the lead up to the 1982 Assembly election the SDLP proposed a “Council for a New Ireland” in its manifesto. This, with the assistance of the Irish Government, was realised in the creation of the New Ireland Forum in March 1983. It was a forum “all democratic parties which reject violence and which have members elected or appointed to either House of the Oireachtas or the Northern Ireland Assembly”. The SDLP, along with Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour all joined. The Forum met for the first time on 30 May with five SDLP members: John Hume, Austin Currie, Joe Hendron, Eddie McGrady and Seamus Mallon.

Submissions were taken from sectors, individuals and organisations across the island of Ireland, examining the long-term future of the island. After a year of work the Forum published its report in May 1984, detailing three possible structures for a new Ireland. The three options of a unitary state, federal/confederal state and joint authority were rooted in previous SDLP policy and went on to influence the policies of the Irish Government and the major political parties in the Republic in relation to Northern Ireland in the following decade.

In the general election in June 1983 the SDLP failed to regain the seat in Belfast West it had lost when Gerry Fitt resigned from the party. However, John Hume was elected to the House of Commons for the new constituency of Foyle. The following year Hume also retained his seat in the European Parliament.

=== Anglo-Irish Agreement (1985–1987) ===
Throughout the 1970s and 80s SDLP leader John Hume used his connections with influential Irish-American politicians Tip O&#x27;Neill, Ted Kennedy, Daniel Moynihan and Hugh Carey to push the SDLP’s analysis of the division and conflict on the island of Ireland. The “Four Horsemen” and other senior politicians persuaded President Ronald Reagan to encourage British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to work with the Irish Government to agree a collective way forward. Negotiations began in early 1985 and concluded on 15 November with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.

Although the agreement was supported by the SDLP, it faced considerable opposition from Unionist parties. Fifteen Unionist MPs resigned their Westminster seats forcing by-elections in January 1986. The SDLP targeted constituencies where support for the Anglo-Irish Agreement was strongest and subsequently managed to win Newry and Armagh, where deputy leader Seamus Mallon won the seat from the Ulster Unionists.

This success continued into the 1987 general election where the SDLP’s support for the agreement saw its vote rise to levels last seen when the party was first founded in the early 70s, mostly at the expense of Sinn Féin. In addition to holding both their current seats, Eddie McGrady won the seat of South Down from Enoch Powell, finally ending his political career.

=== Hume-Adams Talks (1988-1994) ===
In January 1988 SDLP Leader John Hume began a series of secret talks with Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams which lasted until August of that year.

The following year local government elections were held. These elections saw the Party’s best result at a local election since its foundation, winning 21% of the vote and 121 seats. These came mostly at the expense of Sinn Féin, who voters began to turn away from following a number of IRA atrocities. In the European Election that June, John Hume increased the SDLP vote to 25%. In April 1992 the SDLP reached their electoral high point, as Joe Hendron won the Belfast West seat at the expense of Gerry Adams. The SDLP now had four MPs.

In late 1992, knowledge of talks between John Hume and Gerry Adams became public. The talks were criticised by many, both within the SDLP and outside. The talks would eventually lead to the Downing Street Declaration by British Prime Minister John Major and Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, which laid the ground for a ceasefire and negotiations.

Throughout 1994, SDLP representatives continued to face attacks from paramilitaries, as loyalists burnt out Joe Hendron’s car while Councillor John Fee was beaten by Republicans outside his home. On 31 August the IRA announced a ceasefire, followed shortly afterwards by the loyalist paramilitaries. Hume, Adams and Reynolds met in Dublin and publicly shook hands. The SDLP Leader called for peace negotiations to begin without delay.

=== Good Friday Agreement (1995-1998) ===
Throughout 1995 the SDLP continued to engage in talks with the Irish and British Governments, and with other political parties to establish formal all-party talks. They suggested appointing former US Senator George Mitchell to oversee an international body on arms decommissioning. The Government then established this body which produced the “Mitchell Principles” which parties will be required to meet if they were to enter talks. Following this, the Prime Minister John Major announced details of an election to a Forum which will comprise the parties involved in talks. The election took place in May 1996 where the SDLP took 24% of the vote and 21 seats.

Leading up to the next general election there was some speculation on the SDLP forming an electoral pact with Sinn Féin. SDLP Leader John Hume stated that this would only be considered in the event of an IRA ceasefire and Sinn Féin agreeing to end their policy of abstentionism. The May 1997 election yielded mixed results for the SDLP. The party increased its vote share to its highest ever level, however lost their seat in Belfast West to Sinn Féin. In the local elections held a few weeks later the SDLP also increased its vote share but lost seven seats. After the election Alban Maginness was appointed Lord Mayor of Belfast, becoming the first nationalist to hold this position.

Following changes of government in Ireland and the UK talks reconvened in autumn of 1997. The SDLP participated in these talks alongside other parties. Agreement was finally reached on 10 April 1998 when the SDLP, seven other parties, the British and Irish Governments signed the Good Friday Agreement. In the subsequent referendum the SDLP campaigned for a “Yes” vote, with SDLP leader John Hume appearing onstage with U2 frontman Bono and UUP leader David Trimble. The result was a resounding victory for the “Yes” campaign, who secured 71.12% in Northern Ireland. Both Hume and Trimble won the Nobel Peace Prize later that year for their efforts in securing the Agreement.

As a result of the Agreement, elections to a new Northern Ireland Assembly were held in June 1998; the SDLP emerged as the second-largest party overall, and the largest nationalist party, with 24 out of 108 seats. The party was then returned to government later in the year when a power-sharing Executive was established for Northern Ireland. The SDLP took office alongside the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), and Sinn Féin, and the SDLP&#x27;s Seamus Mallon became Deputy First Minister alongside the UUP&#x27;s First Minister, David Trimble.

Upon Mallon&#x27;s retirement in 2001, Mark Durkan succeeded him as Deputy First Minister.

===All-island Merger===
There had been a debate in the party on the prospects of amalgamation with Fianna Fáil. Little came of this speculation and former party leader Margaret Ritchie, Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick rejected the idea. Speaking at the 2010 Irish Labour Party national conference in Galway she said that a merger would not happen while she was leader – &quot;Merger with Fianna Fáil? Not on my watch.&quot; After his election as Fianna Fáil Leader in January 2011, Micheál Martin repeatedly dismissed the possibility of a merger or electoral alliance with the SDLP. In January 2019, the SDLP membership were e-mailed on the issue with the text &quot;continuing on as normal is not an option&quot;, a reference to the party&#x27;s declining fortunes.

In February 2019, at a special party conference, the members approved a partnership with Fianna Fáil, the main opposition party in the Republic of Ireland. Both parties shared policies on key areas, including addressing the current political situation in Northern Ireland, improving public services in both jurisdictions of Ireland, such as healthcare and education, and bringing about further unity and co-operation of the people on the island and arrangements for a future poll on Irish reunification.

Claire Hanna, MLA for Belfast South and party spokesperson on Brexit, quit the assembly group as a result.

In the lead up to the 2022 Assembly election, party leader Colum Eastwood played down the partnership stating, &quot;The SDLP stands on its own two feet.&quot; This led people to commentate that the partnership is no longer active, with comments from as early as 2020 determining that it had been &quot;quietly forgotten&quot;. The partnership officially ended on 28 September 2022.

===Westminster Parliament===
In contrast to Sinn Féin, which follows a policy of abstentionism, the SDLP MPs have always taken their seat in the Westminster parliament. The party&#x27;s first MP was leader Gerry Fitt who was already a sitting MP when the SDLP was founded. The SDLP&#x27;s best result was in 1992 general election when they won four out of 17 seats. Its worst result was in 2017 when they lost all their seats. In 2019 they won two seats.

Although not abstentionist, SDLP MPs have protested the parliamentary oath required of every member of parliament. At the swearing in ceremony after the 2019 general election, the party leader Colum Eastwood said:

:&quot;Under protest and in order to represent my constituency, I do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law. My true allegiance is to the people of Derry and the people of Ireland.&quot;

===Proposed Dáil participation===
The SDLP, along with Sinn Féin, have long sought speaking rights in Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Republic&#x27;s parliament. In 2005, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, leader of Fianna Fáil, put forward a proposal to allow MPs and MEPs from Northern Ireland to participate in debates on the region. However, the plan was met with vociferous opposition from the Republic&#x27;s main opposition parties, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, and was subsequently shelved. Unionists had also strongly opposed the proposal.

===Remembrance Day 2010===
On Remembrance Day in 2010, party leader Margaret Ritchie became the first leader of a nationalist party to wear a poppy while attending a wreath-laying ceremony in Downpatrick, County Down. The poppy is worn on the lapel in the United Kingdom as a mark of respect and remembrance for fallen British soldiers in the period around Remembrance Day and is controversial in Northern Ireland, as it is viewed by many as a political symbol representing support for the British Army. Because of this, it has long been the preserve of the unionist/loyalist community. Her actions drew praise from unionists.

===Leadership challenges and elections, 2011–2024===
On 27 July 2011, it was reported that Margaret Ritchie faced a leadership challenge from deputy leader Patsy McGlone. &quot;The Phoenix&quot; reported that only one MLA, Alex Attwood was prepared to back her and that &quot;she will be humiliated if she puts her leadership to a vote&quot;.

Alasdair McDonnell was confirmed as Ritchie&#x27;s successor after the subsequent leadership election on 5 November 2011.

Colum Eastwood challenged McDonnell and replaced him as leader after the party&#x27;s 2015 leadership election.

Eastwood stood down as leader in 2024. Deputy leader Claire Hanna, was selected to replace Eastwood during the 2024 leadership election when she ran unopposed. Ratification for the new party leadership will take place at a conference in October 2024.

== Ideology and policies ==
The SDLP is a social democratic party that opposes austerity and Brexit. It is also an Irish nationalist party advocating for a shared home place for all the people on the island of Ireland.

While the party is officially anti-abortion, it does not apply a party whip on the issue. The party supports LGBT rights including marriage equality, the roll out of PrEP across Northern Ireland and LGBT education in schools. The SDLP is anti-xenophobic and opposes plans to create what it deems a hostile environment for immigrants. The party also supports an Irish language act.

The SDLP believes that 3,000 social and affordable houses should be built every year. They oppose the gig economy and zero-hour contracts. The party opposes welfare reform and the cut to universal credit.

Despite opposing academic selection, the party does not advocate the abolition of grammar schools. The party supports the abolition of tuition fees. It wants to make a modern language up to GCSE and the teaching of maths up to the age of 18 compulsory.

The party believes that the Magee campus in Derry should be expanded to 10,000 student places.

The party supports a green corporate levy on businesses who contribute large amounts of greenhouse gases and a green jobs strategy. They also believe that a climate emergency should be declared and the government should be required to reach net zero emissions.

==Electoral performance==
Upon its formation, the SDLP quickly established itself as the second largest party and the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland. It largely held this position until the beginning of the 21st century. In the 1998 Assembly election, it became the biggest party overall in terms of votes received and the first nationalist party to do so. This would be the largest seat share it would ever hold as it slowly saw declining support following the retirement of John Hume in 2001.

Under leader Mark Durkan, the 2001 general election and the 2003 Assembly election saw fellow Irish nationalist party Sinn Féin win more seats and votes than the SDLP for the first time, a position they would continue to hold. In the 2004 European elections, Hume stood down and the SDLP failed to retain the seat he had held since 1979, losing it to Sinn Féin. Alban Maginness attempted to take the seat again in the 2009 European elections the party fielded as their candidate and failed to gain a seat with 78,489 first preference votes. The party further declined in the 2011 Assembly elections and the 2016 Assembly election, as the total number of votes received continued to drop.

The 2017 Assembly election saw the party retain its 12-seat count from the prior election, increasing its seat share due to a drop in the size of the assembly for the first time since 1998. This was followed by the 2017 general election where the SDLP lost all three seats and returned its worst ever vote share. In the 2019 European election, the final in the United Kingdom&#x27;s history, party leader Colum Eastwood ran, increasing his party&#x27;s vote but failing to take a seat. In the general election later that year the party recaptured Belfast South and Foyle with the highest ever vote recorded for the party in both constituencies and managed to increase its vote across Northern Ireland to its highest in almost fifteen years for a general election. The two seats held by the party currently have the largest majorities of any constituencies in Northern Ireland.

In the 2022 Assembly election, the SDLP slipped to the 5th largest party with only eight seats in the Assembly.

Some see the SDLP as first and foremost a party now representing Catholic middle-class interests, with voters concentrated in rural areas and the professional classes, rather than a vehicle for Irish nationalism. The SDLP reject this argument, pointing to their strong support in Derry and their victory in South Belfast in the 2005 Westminster election. Furthermore, in the lead up to that election, they published a document outlining their plans for a politically united Ireland. Their decline in Northern Ireland outside of two particular strongholds had led some to dub the party, the &quot;South Down and Londonderry Party&quot;.

<doc id="168465" wikidata="Q627888" url="?curid=168465" title="Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)">
<text>Gordon Muir Campbell, (born January 12, 1948) is a retired Canadian diplomat and politician who was the 35th mayor of Vancouver from 1986 to 1993 and the 34th premier of British Columbia from 2001 to 2011.

He was the leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party from 1993 to 2011. From 2011 to 2016, he served as Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Canada&#x27;s representative to the Ismaili Imamat from 2014 to 2016.

==Early life==
Campbell was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. His father, Charles Gordon (Chargo) Campbell, was a physician and an assistant dean of medicine at the University of British Columbia, until his suicide in 1961, when Gordon was 13. His mother Peg was a kindergarten assistant at University Hill Elementary School. The couple had four children. Gordon grew up in the West Point Grey neighbourhood of Vancouver and went to Stride Elementary, and University Hill Secondary School where he was student council president. Upon graduation from high school, Campbell was accepted by Dartmouth College, a well-known Ivy League institution in Hanover, New Hampshire; he had received a scholarship and a job offer so he could afford the tuition fees and defray educational expenses.

Campbell intended to study medicine but was persuaded by three English professors to shift his focus to English and urban management. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in English. At Dartmouth College, in 1969, Campbell received a $1,500 Urban Studies Fellowship that made it possible for him to work in Vancouver&#x27;s city government where he met Art Phillips, a TEAM city councilor who later became the 32nd mayor of Vancouver.

== Early career ==
After graduating from college that year, Campbell and Nancy Chipperfield married in New Westminster on July 4, 1970. Under the Canadian University Service Overseas (CUSO) program, they went to Nigeria to teach. There he coached basketball and track and field and launched literacy initiatives. Stanford accepted Campbell to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in education, but the couple returned to Vancouver instead where Campbell entered law school at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and Nancy earned her education degree. Campbell&#x27;s law school education was short-lived; as he soon returned to the City of Vancouver to work for Art Phillips on his mayoral campaign. When Phillips was elected in 1972, Campbell became his executive assistant, a job he held until 1976.

At 28 years old, he left Mayor Phillips&#x27;s office and went to work for Marathon Realty as a project manager. In 1976, Geoffrey, the Campbells&#x27; first child, was born. In 1978, the Campbells bought a house in Point Grey, which remained their home for the next 26 years. From 1975 to 1978, Campbell pursued a Master of Business Administration degree at Simon Fraser University&#x27;s Beedie School of Business. In 1979, Nancy Campbell gave birth to their second child, Nicholas.

In 1981, Campbell left Marathon Realty and started his own business, Citycore Development Corporation. Despite the economic slowdown that affected Canada that year, his company was successful and constructed several buildings in Vancouver.

After a two-year absence from civic political activities, Campbell became involved in the mayoral campaign of May Brown and was an active supporter of the Downtown Stadium for Vancouver Committee. Although Brown was unsuccessful, Campbell and the committee continued promoting the stadium to revitalize False Creek, which at the time was polluted industrial land. The committee was eventually successful, as Premier Bill Bennett announced the Downtown Stadium project in 1980.

==Vancouver Councillor and Mayor==
Campbell was elected to Vancouver City Council in 1984 as a member of the Non-Partisan Association. He was then elected as mayor of Vancouver for three successive terms from 1986 to 1993. Notable events in civic politics during that period included the development of the Expo Lands, the re-development of Yaletown, and the foundation of the Coal Harbour residential area. One of the most significant projects of his term was the construction of the new Vancouver Public Library. He also served as chair of the Greater Vancouver Regional District and president of the Union of British Columbia Municipalities.

==Liberal leader==
Campbell became leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party in 1993 in a three-way race with Gordon Gibson, Jr. and Gordon Wilson, the incumbent party leader, who had lost the confidence of his party. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly the next year in a by-election in Vancouver-Quilchena.

In the 1996 campaign, Campbell was elected to the Vancouver-Point Grey riding, which he held until 2010. The Liberals entered the election leading in the polls because of a fundraising scandal in the New Democratic Party (NDP). His party gained 16 seats and won a slight plurality of the popular vote, but the NDP retained enough seats to continue as the majority government. He stayed on as leader of the Opposition, opposing NDP premiers Glen Clark, Dan Miller and Ujjal Dosanjh.

In May 2000, Campbell, along with Michael de Jong and Geoffrey Plant, brought a court case against the Nisga&#x27;a Nation, the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General of British Columbia, parties to the first modern-day Aboriginal Treaty in British Columbia, known as the Nisga&#x27;a Final Agreement. He and the other plaintiffs claimed the treaty signed with the Nisga&#x27;a Nation was &quot;in part inconsistent with the Constitution of Canada and therefore in part of no force and effect&quot;. However, Justice Williamson dismissed the application, judging that the enacting legislation did &quot;establish a treaty as contemplated by Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The legislation and the Treaty are constitutionally valid.&quot;

Premier Glen Clark&#x27;s government was beset by controversy, difficult economic and fiscal conditions, attacks on the NDP&#x27;s building of the Fast Ferries and charges against Clark in relation to casino licensing, known as Casinogate. (Clark was eventually vindicated, though resigned his post because of the investigation.) In the BC election of 2001, Campbell&#x27;s Liberals defeated the two-term NDP incumbents, taking 77 of 79 seats in the legislature. This was the largest majority of seats and the second-largest majority of the popular vote in BC history.

==Premier (2001−2011)==

===First term===

====Tax====
In 2001, Campbell campaigned on a promise to reduce income taxes significantly to stimulate the economy. A day after taking office, he reduced personal income tax for all taxpayers by 25 per cent across every tax bracket. The government also introduced reductions in the corporate income tax, and eliminated the Corporation Capital Tax.

====Spending====
To finance the tax cuts and to balance the provincial budget, Campbell&#x27;s first term was also noted for several measures of fiscal austerity such as reductions in welfare rolls and some social services, deregulation, sale of government assets (in particular the ferries built by the previous government during the Fast Ferry Scandal), reducing the size of the civil service, and closing government offices in certain areas.

==== BC Rail ====
In 2003, Campbell announced the sale of BC Rail, a publicly owned rail corporation, to the Canadian National Railway. This occurred even though he had made a campaign promise not to sell the company during the 2001 British Columbia election. In 1996, he had lost an election after promising to sell BC Rail, leading some to allege that he had hidden his true plans to get elected in 2001, and &quot;went back to his original plan&quot; after winning the election in 2001. This sale was condemned as unfair by the losing bidders, and triggered charges based in information found during police raids on cabinet offices in a drug-related investigation in what is known as the BC Legislature Raids.

====Education====
The Campbell government passed legislation in August 2001 declaring education as an essential service, therefore making it illegal for educators to go on strike. This fulfilled a platform promise made in the election campaign.

The government embarked upon the largest expansion of BC&#x27;s post-secondary education system since the foundation of Simon Fraser University in 1965. In 2004, the government announced that 25,000 new post-secondary places would be established between 2004 and 2010.

The Campbell government also lifted the six-year-long tuition fee freeze that was placed on BC universities and colleges by the previous NDP government. In 2005 a tuition limit policy was put in place, capping increases at the rate of inflation.

====Environmental====
Campbell made significant changes, including new Environmental Assessment Legislation, as well as controversial new aquaculture policies on salmon farming. In November 2002, His government passed the Forest and Range Practices Act which reversed many of the regulations previously introduced by the former New Democrat government.

====First Nations====

During the 2001 election, the BC Liberals also campaigned on a promise to hold a consultative referendum seeking a mandate from the general public to negotiate treaties with First Nations. In the spring of 2002, the government held the referendum.

The referendum, led by attorney general Geoff Plant, proposed eight questions that voters were asked to either support or oppose. Critics claimed the phrasing was flawed or biased toward a predetermined response. While some critics, especially First Nations and religious groups, called for a boycott of the referendum, by the May 15 deadline almost 800,000 British Columbians had cast their ballots. Critics called for a boycott of the referendum and First Nations groups collected as many ballots as possible so that they might be destroyed publicly.

Of the ballots that were returned, over 80 per cent of participating voters agreed to all eight proposed principles. Treaty negotiations resumed.

In the lead-up to the 2005 election, Campbell discussed opening up a New Relationship with Aboriginal People. This position was directly opposite to his view of aboriginal treaties pursued in the 2000 Nisga&#x27;a Final Treaty court case, discussed above. The &quot;New Relationship&quot; became the foundation for agreements in principle that were made during the second term, but ultimately rejected by the membership of the First Nations involved.

====Health care====
In 2004, Campbell imposed an unprecedented 15% pay cut to health care employees. Early in its first term, without consulting labour unions, his government passed legislation (Bill 29, the &quot;Health and Social Services Delivery Improvement Act&quot;) that unilaterally amended labour agreements and required health authorities to contract out positions when savings could be predicted. This led to the privatization of more than 8,000 healthcare jobs. These changes met resistance from many health care workers and resulted in a strike by some of them. A court order and amendments by the government to parts of the legislation ended the strike. The unions took the issue to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled in 2007 that the Act violated &quot;good faith&quot; requirements for collective bargaining.

The Campbell government increased health funding by $3 billion during its first term in office to help meet the demand at hand and to increase wages for some health professionals. As well, they increased the number of new nurse training spaces by 2,500, an increase of 62 percent. At the same time, it nearly doubled the doctors in training and opened new medical training facilities in Victoria and Prince George.

Wage rates for doctors and nurses increased in the Campbell government&#x27;s first term. Nurses received a 23.5 percent raise while doctors received a 20.6 percent raise after arbitration. Doctors had threatened to go on strike because of the original Campbell plan to slash their fees, which was seen as a breach of contract, with the dispute being sent to arbitration.

====Impaired driving====

In January 2003, after visiting broadcaster Fred Latremouille, Campbell was arrested and pleaded no contest for driving under the influence of alcohol while vacationing in Hawaii. According to court records, Campbell&#x27;s blood-alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit. In Hawaii, drunk driving is only a misdemeanour, whereas in Canada it is a Criminal Code offence. As is customary in the United States, Campbell&#x27;s mugshot was provided to the media by Hawaii police. The image has proved to be a lasting personal embarrassment, frequently used by detractors and opponents. Campbell was fined $913 (US) and the court ordered him to take part in a substance abuse program, and to be assessed for alcoholism.

A national anti-drinking and driving group, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) Canada called for Campbell to resign. Campbell refused.

====Minimum wage====
On November 1, 2001, the Campbell BC Liberals honoured the previous NDP government&#x27;s legislation to increase the minimum wage to $8.00 per hour from $7.60, while at the same time authority was given so new entrants into the labour force could be paid $6 per hour, 25% lower than the minimum wage. In 2010, British Columbia had the lowest minimum wage amongst the 13 provinces and territories. Campbell&#x27;s successor, Christy Clark, announced that the minimum wage would increase in three stages to begin on May 1, 2011.

====2010 Winter Olympics====
British Columbia won the right to host the 2010 Winter Olympics on July 2, 2003. This was a joint Winter Olympics bid by Vancouver and the ski resort of Whistler. Campbell attended the final presentations in Prague, the Czech Republic.

On February 12, 2010, Campbell was in attendance at the opening ceremony for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and attended events during the games and was present at the closing ceremony.

On April 23, 2010, Campbell received the Olympic Order from the Canadian Olympic Committee for being a dedicated proponent of the Olympic Movement.

===Second term===
In the May 17, 2005, election, Campbell and the BC Liberals won a second majority government with a reduced majority.

====Economy====
430,000 new jobs had been created in B.C. since December 2001, the best job creation record in Canada at the time. In 2007, the economy created 70,800 more jobs, almost all full-time positions. By Spring 2007, unemployment had fallen to 4.0%, the lowest rate in 30 years. However, 40,300 jobs were lost in 2008, mostly in December (35,100), and the unemployment rates sat at 7.8% as of July 2009, the same level they were at in July 2001.

====Education====
On October 7, 2005, following the successive imposition of contracts on BC teachers, British Columbia&#x27;s teachers began an indefinite walk-out. Campbell having made striking illegal for teachers, educators referred to this as an act of civil disobedience. Despite fines and contempt charges, the teachers&#x27; walk-out lasted two weeks, and threatened to culminate in a general strike across the province.

====Environmental====
In 2008, Premier Campbell&#x27;s government developed and entrenched in law the Climate Action Plan. The Plan is claimed by the government to be one of the most progressive plans to address greenhouse gas emissions in North America, due in part to the revenue-neutral carbon tax.

Gordon Campbell told Tim Flannery that he introduced the carbon tax in British Columbia after reading his book &quot;The Weather Makers&quot; (2005).

====First Nations====
The Campbell government attempted to negotiate treaties with a number of First Nations in its second term. Final agreements in principle were signed with the Tsawwassen First Nation, Maa-nulth Treaty Society, and Lheidli T’enneh First Nations. The Tsawwassen Treaty was passed by the band&#x27;s membership in a heavily contested and divisive referendum but came into effect on April 3, 2009.

The Maa-nulth Treaty, which covers a group of Nuu-chah-nulth band governments, is pending ratification by the federal government while the Lheidli-T&#x27;enneh Treaty was rejected in the referendum held by that band.

====Health care====
The Campbell government launched the Conversation on Health, a province-wide consultation with British Columbians on their health care to lay the groundwork for changes to the principles of the Canada Health Act that were presented in the Fall of 2007.

===Third term===

His government were re-elected in the May 12, 2009, election. Their share of total seats remained almost unchanged, as they won 49 seats in a new expanded 85-seat legislature.

====BC Rail e-mail controversy====
Some five years after the BC Legislature Raids, controversy arose when it was revealed that e-mails among Campbell, his staff, and other cabinet ministers may not have been deleted years ago as first claimed. An affidavit filed by Rosemarie Hayes, the B.C. government&#x27;s manager in charge of information services, suggested that copies of the e-mails may have existed as recently as May 2009, but it was ordered that they be destroyed at that time.

On July 20, 2009, the Supreme Court of British Columbia judge conducting the Basi-Virk trial, Madam Justice Elizabeth Bennett, ordered Campbell and other top officials to turn over their e-mail records to the court by August 17. These were never located nor surrendered to the Court.

====HST controversy====
On July 23, 2009, Campbell announced British Columbia would move towards a Harmonized Sales Tax, or HST. The new 12% sales tax would combine and replace the previous 5% Goods and Services Tax and 7% Provincial Sales Tax. The announcement was met with strong opposition from political opponents, news media, and opposition from most members of the public. However, the proposed tax received a positive reaction from the business community, strong supporters of the BC Liberals. Much of the opposition stemmed from Campbell&#x27;s perceived dishonesty about the HST as his government had said it was not on their radar prior to the election despite leaked emails revealing it was, and that it equated to a tax hike for several sectors.

On August 24, representatives from the retail, resource, and film industries held a news conference to speak out in favour of harmonizing BC&#x27;s sales taxes. In addition, sales tax harmonization has been hailed by the C.D. Howe Institute, a think tank, as being &quot;crucial for B.C to maintain its economic competitiveness.&quot; David Docherty, a political science professor at Wilfrid Laurier University, noted that anti-HST sentiment was evident in left-wing populist groups who viewed it as &quot;regressive&quot; and those on the right who &quot;hate all taxes&quot;. Polls consistently showed ...opposition to the HST in BC at &quot;82 to 85 percent&quot;.
&quot;Shortly after the HST announcement, Ipsos Reid reported 85 percent opposition in British Columbia, dropping only slightly to 82 percent a few months
later.&quot;

On June 11, 2010, Blair Lekstrom resigned as BC&#x27;s Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, saying he was leaving both the cabinet and the caucus over a fundamental disagreement with the BC Liberals on the harmonized sales tax. He told The Canadian Press: &quot;It was a tough decision but it had to be made. Fundamentally, the HST is it. The people I represent say  ... we want you to put the brakes on the HST.&quot; His constituency bordered on Alberta, which had no provincial sales tax and businesses were concerned they would lose sales.

A freedom of information request came to light on September 1, 2010, revealing that the BC Liberals had formed HST-related plans prior to the 2009 election—contrary to their statements on the subject.

===Resignation===
On November 3, 2010, Campbell made a televised address to the public announcing his intention to resign as Premier of British Columbia. The announcement was made after months of strong political opposition to the implementation of the HST, which saw Campbell&#x27;s approval rating fall to only 9%, according to an Angus Reid poll, and led to rumours that he has lost support of some members of his cabinet. Another factor in his resignation was the ongoing BC Rail Scandal trial in which the Premier and other members of his cabinet and staff were due to face embarrassing cross-examination in relation to the Basi-Virk trial, which was called to a halt with plea bargain around the same time. On December 5, 2010, while answering questions from reporters, he &quot;hinted strongly&quot; that he will not stay on as an MLA after his successor as Liberal leader is chosen in February, according to Rod Mickleburgh of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.
Campbell resigned as premier on March 14, 2011; he was succeeded by Christy Clark.

==High Commissioner to the UK==


In late June 2011, it was reported that Campbell was to be named Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. On August 15, 2011, Campbell was formally announced to succeed the post. On September 15, 2011, Campbell officially became the Canadian High Commissioner in London. He represented Canadian interests throughout Britain until his term ended in 2016.

Campbell was shortlisted for the Grassroot Diplomat Initiative Award in 2015 for his work on business partnership as the High Commissioner of Canada, and he remains in the directory of the Grassroot Diplomat Who&#x27;s Who publication.

In January 2019, a former High Commission employee, Judith Prins, filed a sexual assault complaint with the Metropolitan Police alleging that Campbell groped her in 2013. A spokesperson for Campbell denied the allegation, saying the complaint was investigated and dismissed at the time. In September 2020, details emerged of a civil suit filed by Prins naming Campbell and the Government of Canada as defendants. She is seeking damages for anxiety, stress and lost income. Campbell responded to this news saying: &quot;This has been settled once before, more than five years ago now. It was dealt with fully.&quot;

==Honours==
On September 2, 2011, it was announced that Campbell would receive the Order of British Columbia, the second Premier to be a recipient. Some believed his nomination contravened the legislation that prevented an elected official from being appointed while holding office. However, on September 7, 2011, Lance S. G. Finch, the Chief Justice of British Columbia and chair of the Order of BC Advisory Council declared that although his nomination package was received on March 10, 2011 (four days before his resignation as Premier), Campbell was appointed to the Order on September 2, 2011 at which time he was not an elected MLA.

In 2014, Thompson Rivers University gave Campbell the Honorary degree of Doctor of Laws for his contributions to the founding of their newly opened law school.

He was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002 and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012.

<doc id="168466" wikidata="Q308816" url="?curid=168466" title="Creed (band)">
<text>Creed is an American rock band from Tallahassee, Florida formed in 1994. Creed was prominent in the post-grunge movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s, releasing three consecutive multi-platinum albums; &quot;Human Clay&quot; (1999), the band&#x27;s second studio album, received diamond (11× platinum) certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Creed has sold over 28 million records in the United States, has sold over 53 million albums worldwide, and was the ninth best-selling musical act of the 2000s.

For most of its existence, the band has consisted of lead vocalist Scott Stapp, lead guitarist Mark Tremonti, drummer Scott Phillips, and bassist Brian Marshall. Creed&#x27;s first two studio albums, &quot;My Own Prison&quot; (1997) and &quot;Human Clay&quot; (1999), were released to commercial success despite generally unfavorable critical reception; Marshall left the band in 2000. &quot;Human Clay&quot; contained the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one single &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;—which also won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song in 2001. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Weathered&quot;, was released in 2001, with Tremonti on bass guitar. Creed disbanded in 2004; Stapp pursued a solo career while Tremonti, Phillips, and Marshall founded the band Alter Bridge with Myles Kennedy.

Creed reunited in 2009, released their fourth album &quot;Full Circle&quot; that year and actively toured before separating again in 2012. After an eleven-year hiatus, Creed reunited once more in July 2023 and subsequently announced headlining tours in 2024 and 2025.

==History==
===Early years (1994–1996)===

Creed began in Tallahassee, Florida in 1994. Founding members vocalist Scott Stapp and guitarist Mark Tremonti had been classmates in high school and friends at Florida State University. Stapp and Tremonti realized that they had a mutual love of writing music and performing. After multiple discussions and much time spent writing songs, several of which addressed themes of Christian theology and spirituality (due to Stapp&#x27;s spiritual background as the stepson of a Pentecostal minister), the duo held auditions that led to the recruitment of bassist Brian Marshall, drummer Scott Phillips, and rhythm guitarist Brian Brasher completing the quintet. The five-piece band lasted through 1994, with Brasher leaving in 1995. Creed decided to remain as a quartet. The four musicians had already written and collaborated on four songs that would form part of their chart-topping debut album, &quot;My Own Prison&quot;. The band found local success, playing shows in bars and small dives in Tallahassee. In 2012, Stapp wrote that Creed first performed under the name &quot;Naked Toddler&quot; at Yianni&#x27;s in Tallahassee; the name was picked up by Tremonti from a headline in that day&#x27;s newspaper, but the reaction that night to the name was negative. The group was trying to find ideas for a better name when Marshall said he had been in a band called Mattox Creed. Stapp latched onto the ‘creed’ aspect, and the band agreed.

===&quot;My Own Prison&quot; and rise to fame (1997–1998)===
Wanting &quot;a real show at a club&quot;, they managed to persuade the owner of a bar in Tallahassee to book them by claiming that they could guarantee an audience of 200 people. Owner and manager Jeff Hanson recalled that the band had played mostly cover versions, but two original songs stood out and impressed him so much that he promptly signed them to his management and promotions company and set about developing their act. For their first recordings he matched the band up with John Kurzweg, a producer and friend of Hanson&#x27;s who he felt was an appropriate fit. Together they recorded their debut album for $6,000, which was funded by Hanson. The album, titled &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, was initially self-released on their own label, Blue Collar Records in April 1997, selling 6,000 copies throughout Florida.

&quot;My Own Prison&quot; had been circulating around the music industry for a while when, in May 1997, Diana Meltzer from Wind-Up Records heard the album and decided almost immediately that she wanted to sign them to the label, which had creative issues with Baboon over the latter&#x27;s reluctance to alter their image and sound to suit the label&#x27;s demands. Meltzer later said that she heard &quot;an arena band&quot;. Within the same week, Meltzer, together with Wind-up president Steve Lerner, CEO Alan Meltzer, and A&amp;R representative Joel Mark, flew to Tallahassee to see Creed perform live and decide for certain whether to offer them a contract. &quot;Seeing the energy in the room when Scott Stapp stepped up to the mic, and hearing his powerful voice fill the room, alongside Mark Tremonti&#x27;s now legendary guitar riffs and that big Creed anthemic rock sound, was all I needed,&quot; she told HitQuarters. According to Tremonti in his &quot;Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction&quot; video in 2015, Creed had been rejected by Atlantic and Cherry Universal Records before Wind-up flew down to sign them. The band signed with Wind-up Records in 1997.

&quot;My Own Prison&quot; was remixed, given a more radio-friendly sound, and re-released by Wind-up Records in August 1997. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, &quot;Torn&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s This Life For&quot;, and &quot;One&quot;. Each of these songs reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, making Creed the first band to accomplish such a feat with a debut album. With little MTV exposure, media coverage, or label support, &quot;My Own Prison&quot; sold extremely well, moving over six million copies and going six times platinum. Creed continued to top year-end charts and was recognized as the Rock Artist of the Year at the 1998 Billboard Music Awards. &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was also the highest-selling heavy music record of 1998 on Nielsen SoundScan&#x27;s Hard Music chart. The band&#x27;s hit song &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was also featured as a live performance on the charity album &quot;Live in the X Lounge&quot; in 1998. The band covered Alice Cooper&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m Eighteen&quot; for &quot;The Faculty&quot; soundtrack in 1998. Critical reception toward &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was mostly favorable. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave it four out of five stars and said that Creed &quot;work well within their boundaries&quot; despite &quot;basically [falling] into the category of post-Seattle bands who temper their grunge with a dose of Live earnestness.&quot; The album lyrically deals with themes of questioning and struggling with faith and spirituality.

===&quot;Human Clay&quot; and Marshall&#x27;s departure (1999–2000)===
With money made from &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, the band started to write for their second album, &quot;Human Clay&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Higher&quot;, spent a record-breaking 17 weeks on the top of the rock radio charts. In 2009, &quot;Higher&quot; was ranked as the 95th greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1. The album was released in 1999, when &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was still doing reasonably well. However, &quot;Human Clay&quot; was an instant and overwhelming success debuting at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and selling over ten million copies over the next two years, allowing it to become one of the few rock albums to be certified diamond by the RIAA. The album was the band&#x27;s first to hit No. 1 in the U.S., where it debuted with first week sales of 315,000, and stayed on top for two weeks. After the release of &quot;Higher&quot; and then the album in late 1999, three follow-up singles were released in 2000: &quot;What If&quot;, &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;, and &quot;Are You Ready?&quot;. The first three singles topped radio charts, giving Creed a total of seven chart-topping singles. The band would later go on to win a Grammy Award for &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; for Best Rock Song in 2001.

Reviews for &quot;Human Clay&quot; were largely positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that the record &quot;does make it clear that there is an audience for post-grunge hard rock, as long as it&#x27;s delivered without pretension and as long as it meets the audience&#x27;s desire for straight-ahead, hard-hitting music.&quot; The lyrical content of &quot;Human Clay&quot; is a slight departure from that of &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, touching on subjects such as fatherhood (&quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;) and lucid dreaming (&quot;Higher&quot;), as well as darker, more violent themes such as sexual abuse (&quot;Wash Away Those Years&quot;) and hostility (&quot;What If&quot;).

In March 2000, an authorized home video about Creed was announced on the band&#x27;s website, but never released. During the summer of 2000, bassist Brian Marshall began a spiral into alcoholism. The band had a meeting with management to discuss Marshall&#x27;s future. Stapp and Tremonti supported the idea of Marshall going to rehab and attempted to talk Marshall into going, but he refused. Initially, the public thought Marshall was let go because he criticized Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder in a radio interview with KNDD in June 2000, claiming that Scott Stapp was a better songwriter, and criticized Pearl Jam&#x27;s recent albums for &quot;having songs without hooks.&quot; Stapp later distanced the rest of the band from Marshall&#x27;s comments and stated, &quot;Yes, we get tired of the PJ question, but there is no excuse for the arrogance and stupidity [of Marshall]. I ask you all not to judge Creed as a band, because the statements made were not the band&#x27;s feelings, they were Brian&#x27;s. I&#x27;m sorry if Brian offended anyone, and he has already apologized for his comments.&quot; Tremonti and Stapp were concerned for Marshall and their collective friendships, but soon after the controversy, Marshall formed a new band called Grand Luxx with his old Mattox Creed bandmates. Stapp stated that Marshall&#x27;s leaving was his choice and was unrelated to the Pearl Jam comments. Brett Hestla, from the band Virgos Merlot, replaced Marshall as a touring member of Creed.

===&quot;Weathered&quot; and break-up (2001–2004)===

Creed worked on their third album for most of 2001, with Tremonti choosing to play bass on the record to &quot;[preserve] the band&#x27;s initial core,&quot; although Hestla remained in Creed&#x27;s touring lineup. &quot;Weathered&quot; was released on November 20, 2001. Six singles were released from the album: &quot;My Sacrifice&quot; (which earned the band a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 2003), &quot;Bullets&quot;, &quot;One Last Breath&quot;, &quot;Hide&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Dancing&quot;, and &quot;Weathered&quot;. The album was a commercial bestseller and was certified platinum six times over and debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200. It remained at that spot for eight weeks, a record which Creed notably shares with The Beatles. The tour to promote &quot;Weathered&quot; was met with considerable controversy; it was delayed in April 2002 when Stapp suffered a concussion and vertebrae damage after being involved in a car crash. As a result, in addition to his growing addiction to alcohol, he became addicted to pain medication.
This, along with other events, led to a controversial concert on December 29, 2002, at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois, which ultimately led to the band&#x27;s disunion. Four disappointed concertgoers filed a lawsuit against the band, claiming that Scott Stapp &quot;was so intoxicated and/or medicated that he was unable to sing the lyrics of a single Creed song.&quot; Creed later issued an apology on Stapp&#x27;s behalf, although Stapp would later deny the claims. Ultimately, the case was dismissed. Stapp later confirmed that he was intoxicated during the concert, but he asserted that he was not incoherent.

Creed disbanded in June 2004, after more than a year of inactivity. Tremonti cited tensions between Stapp and the rest of the band as the reasoning. He said that the relationship with Stapp had become so strained that the creative juices were no longer flowing. The reality was that Stapp was in Maui battling his addiction to alcohol and drugs. Almost simultaneous with the announcement of Creed&#x27;s break-up, Stapp opted for a solo career. On November 22, 2004, Wind-up Records released Creed&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. Stapp released his debut solo album &quot;The Great Divide&quot; in 2005. Tremonti and Phillips reunited with Marshall to form a new band, Alter Bridge, in 2004 with singer Myles Kennedy, formerly of American rock band The Mayfield Four.

===Reunion, &quot;Full Circle&quot; and 2012 tour (2009–2012)===

While Tremonti referred to Creed as &quot;officially in our past&quot; in 2006, in April 2009, Creed&#x27;s website announced that the band had reunited for a new tour and plans for a new album. According to Tremonti, &quot;We&#x27;re all very excited to reconnect with our fans and each other after seven long years.&quot; He later added that being in Creed again was &quot;the last thing [he] expected.&quot; Phillips also stated: &quot;Our career as Creed came to a very abrupt and unforeseen ending. After reflecting on some of the greatest personal and professional moments of our lives, we&#x27;ve come to realize that we are still very capable of continuing that career and our friendship on a grander scale than ever before.&quot; In an interview for &quot;People&quot; magazine, Stapp elaborated on the reunion, saying, &quot;We never felt like we weren&#x27;t together. We&#x27;re not looking at this as a reunion. It&#x27;s more of a rebirth.&quot;

In June 2009, Creed performed with Marshall on bass for the first time in eight years on Sessions@AOL, showing the band playing four of their hits. In addition, the band performed live on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; on June 26, 2009. Creed&#x27;s reunion tour, with touring guitarist Eric Friedman, kicked off on August 6, 2009, and concluded on October 20. &quot;Full Circle&quot;, Creed&#x27;s first album in eight years, came out on October 27, 2009. Stapp explained the title as follows: &quot;It really defines and articulates, melody-wise and lyrically, what&#x27;s happened with us. We&#x27;ve come full circle and it&#x27;s a great place to be.&quot; The first single from &quot;Full Circle&quot;, &quot;Overcome&quot;, was posted on the band&#x27;s official website on August 18, 2009, the same day the radio premiere started along with its release as a digital download on August 25. The second single, &quot;Rain&quot;, was released to radio stations on September 23 and became available on October 6, 2009, as another digital download. The third single, &quot;A Thousand Faces&quot;, was released in 2010.

On September 25, 2009, Creed performed a concert in Houston, Texas that was recorded, broadcast via a live internet stream, and subsequently released on December 8, 2010, as a concert film titled &quot;Creed Live&quot;, the band&#x27;s first live recording. The performance shattered Justin Timberlake&#x27;s world record for the most cameras used at a live music event by using an unprecedented total of 239. Three other world records were also broken. The performance also featured the first usage of the &quot;big freeze&quot; technology, popularized by the 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot;, in a concert environment. Drummer Scott Phillips also confirmed that &quot;Full Circle&quot; will not be the band&#x27;s final album. The same announcement confirmed that Creed was to go on a world tour in support of &quot;Full Circle&quot; between April and September 2010, starting with an Australia/New Zealand tour, followed by South America, Europe, and North America. The tour was called The 20-10 Tour. Tickets for the tour were ten and twenty dollars to stand up against rising concert ticket prices. The first 2,010 tickets purchased for every concert did not include any service fees. Despite these efforts, not every show sold out, and critical reviews were mostly mixed. Skillet joined the tour as main support.
Creed reconvened in late 2011 and early 2012 to begin work on a potential fifth studio album. A tour was also announced in which the band would perform their first two albums, &quot;My Own Prison&quot; and &quot;Human Clay&quot;, from front to back over the course of two nights, with selected tracks from &quot;Weathered&quot; and &quot;Full Circle&quot; also featured. This tour kicked off with two shows in April 2012, at the Chicago Theatre in Chicago, Illinois, with the band performing &quot;My Own Prison&quot; the first night and &quot;Human Clay&quot; the second. They also toured in South America and Indonesia.

===Hiatus (2013–2023)===
The band went on hiatus in 2012 or 2013. In October 2013, Stapp noted in an interview that extensive work was done on a fifth album throughout 2011 and 2012. However, the project was subsequently abandoned. Stapp has maintained that Creed is &quot;still a band.&quot; He also said that he&#x27;s open to continuing to work with Creed when the time is right.

In June 2015, while promoting his second solo album &quot;Cauterize&quot;, Mark Tremonti claimed in an interview with &quot;Kerrang&quot; that he &quot;[hasn&#x27;t] been a close friend of Scott&#x27;s in 9 years&quot;. He did not speak to Stapp throughout the South American Tour in 2012 and plans for their fifth studio album were shelved, and they continued to work with Myles Kennedy in Alter Bridge.

In September 2015, Stapp appeared on the &quot;Dr. Oz Show&quot;. When asked about a Creed reunion, Stapp replied: &quot;I can tell you what, I sure hope so. I love the guys with all my heart and if they&#x27;re watching, &#x27;Come on guys, let&#x27;s make a record.&#x27;&quot; He later doubled down on the statements by stating that Creed would &quot;definitely&quot; reunite and that he expected new material from the band within &quot;the next two years.&quot; When asked about Stapp&#x27;s statements, Tremonti clarified that he was still busy promoting his solo albums and that Alter Bridge would record and tour in 2016, making it unlikely for him to return to Creed within Stapp&#x27;s proposed timeline.

On November 20, 2015, Creed released a compilation album, entitled &quot;With Arms Wide Open: A Retrospective&quot;. It was a boxed set with three discs: one with hits, the second with rarities, and the third with acoustic versions of hits. In the United States, the album was available exclusively at Walmart.

In 2016, Stapp joined Art of Anarchy. His first album with the band was released in March 2017, and is titled &quot;The Madness&quot;. Alter Bridge continues to tour and record, while Mark Tremonti released, with his solo metal band Tremonti, his third album &quot;Dust&quot; in April 2016, and his fourth album, &quot;A Dying Machine,&quot; in April 2018. Scott Phillips has drummed in the supergroup project Projected, releasing the first album &quot;Human&quot; (2012) and the second effort the double album &quot;Ignite My Insanity&quot; (2017). Scott Stapp has since bridged away from Art of Anarchy, having released his third solo album, &quot;The Space Between the Shadows&quot;, on July 19, 2019.

In November 2020, drummer Scott Phillips announced that a reunion was a possibility.

===Second reunion and return to popularity (2023–present)===
On July 19, 2023, the band announced that they had reunited and would be headlining the Summer of &#x27;99 cruise in April 2024. In their run to winning the World Series in 2023, the Texas Rangers players regularly used Creed&#x27;s &quot;Higher&quot; as motivation even though some players, like Evan Carter, were born after the song had achieved peak popularity. The song became popular with fans and the team alike to the point that the Texas Rangers had singalongs for &quot;Higher&quot; during games during October. Along with their reunion and the Texas Ranger&#x27;s popularizing their music again, Creed&#x27;s streaming numbers improved culminating in Creed attending a playoff game between the Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros on October 18, 2024. Based on their renewed popularity, on October 30, 2023, the band announced The Summer of &#x27;99 Tour, their first tour since 2012. The tour will feature more than 40 shows across the US with support from 3 Doors Down as well as Finger Eleven, Daughtry, Switchfoot, Tonic, and Big Wreck on select dates. This was followed on February 6, 2024, with the announcement of the &quot;Are You Ready? Tour&quot; starting in November 2024 with supporting acts 3 Doors Down, Mammoth WVH, and Finger Eleven. Creed saw a major resurgence in popularity in young men in 2024. Many of their hits, especially One Last Breath, became popular sounds on TikTok. By June 2024, Creed&#x27;s return to mainstream popularity was evidenced by a return to four Billboard charts.

==Musical style and influences==
Creed has been described as post-grunge, hard rock, alternative rock, and alternative metal, and also as Christian rock, grunge, nu metal, and heavy metal.

Stapp&#x27;s influences include Otis Redding, Donny Hathaway, Def Leppard, U2, The Doors, and Led Zeppelin. Guitarist Mark Tremonti&#x27;s influences include thrash metal bands like Slayer, Metallica, Exodus, and Forbidden.

According to a 1999 piece in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;:
The biblical imagery of singer Scott Stapp&#x27;s lyrics got Creed typed as Christian rock by early listeners, and the band&#x27;s denial of any religious objective has unsettled some of its more fervent fans. &quot;We are not a Christian band,&quot; Stapp insists on the band&#x27;s website. &quot;A Christian band has an agenda to lead others to believe in their specific religious beliefs. We have no agenda!&quot;
In 2022, Stapp said in an interview,
I knew I couldn&#x27;t live the life that someone who was a Christian artist was supposed to live. So Creed was not a Christian band. [...] They didn&#x27;t want to live with that pressure. And that burden that was not something they signed up for. They signed up to be in a rock and roll band and everything that came with it. [...] I went to the complete polar opposite of what a preacher is, but still, in my writings, could not escape what I knew was right or what I felt was right, and that is to point people to God, to point people to something greater, to point people to a spiritual life in the spiritual realm, which I knew was real, which I had felt as a child, and I&#x27;ve felt on stage thousands of times and continued to to this day.
Bassist Brian Marshall, who named the band, has noted that Stapp uses spiritual imagery as a metaphor in his lyrics.

==Legacy and reception==

Creed was one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their first three studio albums, &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, &quot;Human Clay&quot;, and &quot;Weathered&quot;, have all gone multi-platinum in the United States, selling six million, 11 million, and six million copies respectively. The band also won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for the song &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; in 2001.

However, Creed has been negatively received by some professional critics, such as Robert Christgau. In 2013, readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine voted Creed the worst band of the 1990s. Jonah Weiner of &quot;Slate&quot; has tried to make the case that the band was &quot;seriously underrated&quot;; Joe Coscarelli of Mediaite countered that &quot;most people hate Creed&#x27;s combination of overwrought power-balladry and Christian-infused testosterone.&quot; In 2011, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Creed as the 18th-best artist of the 2000s.

<text>Weathered is the third studio album by American rock band Creed, released on November 20, 2001. It was the last Creed album to be released until &quot;Full Circle&quot; came out in October 2009, with Creed disbanding in June 2004. It is the only Creed album to be recorded as a three-member band, as bassist Brian Marshall departed in August 2000. Vocalist Scott Stapp and guitarist Mark Tremonti wrote most of the material for the album during a three-week period in late 2000, following their successful tour to support their second album, &quot;Human Clay&quot;. Manager Jeff Hanson once again paired the band with longtime producer John Kurzweg, who rented out a private residence/recording studio in Ocoee, Florida owned by Jay Stanley, where the band would set up their studio inside to record the album. Recording sessions for the album began in July 2001, with Tremonti taking on bass guitar duties in Marshall&#x27;s absence, and would last four months to complete.

Stapp described the album as &quot;two records in one&quot; and &quot;a very extreme record&quot;, as it features some of Creed&#x27;s heaviest and most aggressive songs, experimental tracks, as well as many of the band&#x27;s most popular ballads. The lyrics on &quot;Weathered&quot; tackle familiar topics often addressed by the band including Christianity and faith, discrimination and unity, depression, loneliness, friendship, as well more current and personal issues such as criticism and persecution of the band by their critics and the press, substance abuse, dealing with the pressures that came with the band&#x27;s popularity and living a rock star lifestyle, feelings of invisibility and insignificance, and Stapp&#x27;s deteriorating physical and mental health which would continue to worsen throughout their hectic tour in support of the album.

The album debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s second consecutive studio album to top the chart, and remained at the top spot for eight consecutive weeks, the longest consecutive run since The Beatles&#x27;s greatest hits album &quot;1&quot; (2000) the year prior. &quot;Weathered&quot; also spawned six singles, including two top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles: &quot;One Last Breath&quot;, which peaked at number 6, and &quot;My Sacrifice&quot;, which peaked at number 4. It has since been certified 6× platinum by the RIAA for sales of over 6 million units in the US alone. &quot;Weathered&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the band for their nuance, refined sound and unapologetic emotion, while others criticized the album for its lack of creativity and for being far too serious and pretentious.

==Background==
Following the massive success of the Creed&#x27;s second album &quot;Human Clay&quot;, the band began to experience turmoil during their tour in support of the album in the summer of 2000. Bassist Brian Marshall&#x27;s problems with alcoholism and addiction were taking their toll on the band. Marshall began to spiral, leading to him physically threatening guitarist Mark Tremonti and even began attacking vocalist Scott Stapp verbally and online. After a band meeting they decided that Marshall needed to go to rehab and was let go from Creed, however Marshall never ended up going to rehab. The public initially thought Marshall was let go due to comments he made about Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder during a radio interview with KNDD in June, claiming that Scott Stapp was a better songwriter, and criticizing Pearl Jam&#x27;s recent albums for not having hooks. Marshall was replaced for the remainder of the tour with Brett Hestla of Virgos Merlot.

Scott Stapp&#x27;s struggle with alcoholism, addiction and depression also began to worsen during this period. Stapp began drinking heavily to cope with his depression as well as with the pressure of his fame and the band&#x27;s success. Violent altercations became the norm with Stapp, when in April 2001 he punched a man at a club in St. Augustine, Florida after he was badgering Stapp and reportedly told him &quot;You should’ve stuck with Pearl Jam.&quot; However, no charges were filed. When asked about the altercation Stapp responded by saying &quot;I was going to turn the other cheek, but Jesus never had to deal with this Pearl Jam crap.&quot; 

As Stapp&#x27;s drinking addiction became more severe, he also became addicted to Percocet shortly after the release of the album following a car accident in the spring of 2002, as well as a host of other medications including Xanax and throat steroids like Decadron. Stapp&#x27;s deterioration continued until he reached a point where he was &quot;drinking from the time I woke up ‘til the time I went to sleep, and under the influence of pills as well.&quot; These addictions eventually culminated in a breakdown during a December 29, 2002, live show at the Allstate Arena in Chicago, ultimately leading to the band&#x27;s eventual break-up.

==Writing and recording==
For the &quot;Weathered&quot; album, Creed approached the writing process differently than they did for their previous two albums. Prior to writing new material, the band made a rule that during the tour for &quot;Human Clay&quot; that no new songs could be composed. Scott Stapp says the reason for this was that he wanted the band to &quot;live life and have experiences&quot; before he and guitarist Mark Tremonti began writing new songs. Stapp and Tremonti also vowed not to listen to any music at all between the end of the &quot;Human Clay&quot; tour and the start of writing sessions for &quot;Weathered&quot;. Stapp said the reason for this was that he wanted to ensure that nothing would subconsciously influence the band&#x27;s writing process. This was so that all the material would come from them. After finishing the final leg of their tour in December 2000, Stapp and Tremonti began writing new songs. In their attempt to not allow popular contemporary music to influence their writing, Stapp and Tremonti would go out of their way to listen to either not genre-specific music or classic rock. Some of these artists included The Eagles, 2Pac and Bob Marley, which Stapp admits was done with the intent of not having anything near to what they were doing effecting their creative process. Stapp recalls the writing process for the album, stating &quot;I didn’t feel any particular pressure to write a particular kind of song. I don’t think we ever thought that way; we just wrote what we felt. We just got together and created whatever came out, and we put on a record if we liked it.&quot; The band would also use something they called &quot;the goosebump test&quot;, where the song would have to give them literal goosebumps after the song was completely written, as they did not want to put any material on the record if it did not pass the test. After just three weeks, the songwriting duo had managed to write an entire album&#x27;s worth of material by the end of the year. Following a short holiday break, the band decided to take a laid-back approach to the recording and releasing of the album, deciding to spend the first several months of 2001 refining the new material before entering the recording studio. Most of the writing for the album was done in Stapp&#x27;s living room during four-hour sessions, four nights a week. During the final days of writing material Tremonti and Stapp wrote while on Stapp&#x27;s boat, a Sea Ray cruiser.

On July 20, 2001, Scott Stapp, Mark Tremonti, and Scott Phillips entered J. Stanley Productions Inc., a private residence/recording studio in Ocoee, Florida, to begin the process of recording the album. The home studio featured two in-home control rooms, Studio A, which was decked out with purple lights and purple lava lamps, which Jay Stanley claimed helped spark his creativity; and Studio B, where Creed held their recording sessions. The album was recorded and mixed in just four months using Pro Tools. The band also hired Full Sail University graduate Shilpa Patel, whom Jay Stanley referred to as the &quot;Queen of Pro Tools&quot;, as a studio technician to help the band record and mix the album.

During recording sessions for the song &quot;Who&#x27;s Got My Back?&quot;, the band enlisted the services of Cherokee musician Bo Taylor, an avowed Creed fan who Stapp brought in personally from a reservation who was fluent in ancient Cherokee chants, to do an ancient sounding Cherokee Indian prayer for the intro of the song. The band played a demo of the song for Taylor, and after a lengthy conversation about its meaning Stapp had Taylor do four to five chants in the studio until settling on the first take. Stapp also brought in his sister Aimee to sing backing vocals on &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Dancing&quot;, as well as the Tallahassee Boys&#x27; Choir. Jay Stanley, who was sporadically present during the recording sessions, recalls his initial impression of hearing early demo recordings of the songs, specifically the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;My Sacrifice&quot;, one of the earliest songs written for the album.

At the time, the group was halfway through recording its new album when the attacks of September 11, 2001, occurred. According to Producer John Kurzweg, the mood quickly changed and intensified following the attacks. Kurzweg said &quot;We tried to go forward and do the best we could, but all the songs were written before. Not one lyric was changed.&quot; In response to the terrorist attacks, touring bassist Brett Hestla, along with his band who were known simply as Virgos during this period, wrote a tribute song to those affected and involved in the massacre called &quot;Brother Of Mine&quot;, which they included on their only album &quot;The Path of Least Resistance&quot;. The song featured Tremonti and Philips on guitar and keyboards respectively. Another version of the song also featured Stapp sharing vocal duties with Hestla.

==Music and lyrics==
Stapp describes the album as &quot;two records in one&quot; and &quot;a very extreme record&quot;, as it features some of Creed&#x27;s heaviest songs such as the opening track and second single &quot;Bullets&quot;, as well as some of the band&#x27;s most uplifting numbers including their hit lead single &quot;My Sacrifice&quot;, and the album&#x27;s closing track &quot;Lullaby&quot;. Manager Jeff Hanson described the album as Creed&#x27;s version of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, feeling it would be the record that would set the band apart and have the epic scope and impact of the classic U2 album. With bassist Brian Marshall no longer in the band, Tremonti played bass guitar for all the songs on the album in his absence. Tremonti and the band&#x27;s approach to the album&#x27;s musical style came with the intent of creating meaningful songs that would move people, rather than the more upbeat, popular rock music scene at the time. He credits the bands moody, somber, and darker sound, in contrast to other popular contemporary rock acts of the time such as Third Eye Blind, Semisonic, and Marcy Playground as a contributing factor for the band&#x27;s success early in their careers.

The album opens with &quot;Bullets&quot;, an anthemic and forceful heavy metal track that features some of Tremonti&#x27;s fastest and most aggressive guitar work for Creed. Stapp wrote the lyrics about what he felt were unjust criticisms that the band had received throughout their careers from critics and the press. In the song, Stapp asks of them to &quot;At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head!&quot;, inferring that if someone has something negative to say about them to do it to their faces.

&quot;Bullets&quot; is followed by another one of the album&#x27;s heavier tracks, &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot;. It is the band&#x27;s shortest song ever recorded, clocking in at only 2:36. In between the first and second verse of the song, a muffled voice can be heard reciting the lyrics from the bridge section of &quot;Wash Away Those Years&quot;, from the &quot;Human Clay&quot; album.

The album&#x27;s third track, the eight-minute epic entitled &quot;Who&#x27;s Got My Back?&quot;, is the band&#x27;s longest song ever recorded and one of their most experimental tracks. The song was written by Stapp, who was inspired to reconnect with his own Cherokee roots and heritage on the track. The song opens with a Bo Taylor&#x27;s Cherokee Indian prayer, that according to Stapp, was &quot;so moving to me. It literally brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it.&quot;&quot;

The band continues to explore dark themes on track five of the album with their hit single &quot;One Last Breath&quot;, a song which Mark Tremonti cites as one of his favourite guitar lines and musical compositions for Creed. According to Stapp, the song is about someone crying out for help, realizing the mistakes they&#x27;ve made in their past, and your friends being there for you to lean on. Stapp also expresses sentiments about how in the minds of &quot;normal, well-adjusted&quot; people, any thoughts of moving beyond this life are not real, and how these surreal thoughts are just flashes-in-the-pan and they would never act upon them.

Track six, &quot;My Sacrifice&quot;, sees the band segue into its uplifting numbers on the second half of &quot;Weathered&quot;. Lyrically, the song explores Stapp&#x27;s own personal struggles with battling substance abuse, addiction and alcoholism and him coming to terms with his inability to stay sober despite his best efforts. Musically, the song has a far more positive and uplifting sound comparable to the band&#x27;s previous hit single &quot;Higher&quot;.

&quot;Weathered&quot;, the album&#x27;s title track and final single, was written by Stapp about his feelings of sadness, bleakness and the pressures that came with living the rock star lifestyle while simultaneous having to conceal his rapidly deteriorating and unraveling mental state at the time from those around him.

The final two tracks, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Dancing&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot;, close out the album on a soft note. &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Dancing&quot;, the album&#x27;s fourth single, is a power ballad where Stapp lyrically expresses feelings of invisibility and insignificance in the world. The song features Stapp&#x27;s sister Aimee Stapp on backing vocals during the bridge and the Tallahassee Boys&#x27; Choir singing a background chorus. The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Lullaby&quot;, is one of Creed&#x27;s softest numbers. It is an acoustic duet track featuring only Tremonti on guitar and Stapp on vocals, making it the band&#x27;s only song not to feature drums or bass guitar. Musically the song is a soothing piece similar to that of an actual lullaby, while lyrically the song sees Stapp telling the listener to &quot;Just give love to all&quot;.

==Title, artwork and packaging==
The album title, according to Scott Stapp, was chosen by the band as it was felt that it represented where they were at the time. Stapp states &quot;The band was splitting apart. My struggles, and Brian [Marshall]’s struggles with other issues outside the band really defined where we were as a group.&quot; Stapp noted there was nothing preplanned with regard to the title, but that it was something honest and that &quot;just came out.&quot; Mark Tremonti also added that the band was beginning to go through its initial stages of their eventual break-up, and that &quot;It was probably the darkest time for the band.&quot; 

The artwork for the album was designed by Mark Tremonti&#x27;s brother, Daniel Tremonti, who also designed all of the band&#x27;s album covers. The front cover depicts an unknown man in the foreground holding a hammer and chisel while carving the faces of Stapp, Tremonti, and Philips into the wood of a heavily mossed tree. Some versions of the cover have Tremonti&#x27;s head carved facing to the right, with the wordmark now centred and slightly larger, in solid white, and the album title, also enlarged, at the bottom with a black drop shadow.

As with the artwork for their previous album, &quot;Human Clay&quot;, the artwork for &quot;Weathered&quot; was incorporated into an online interactive game called Creed Quest. Daniel Tremonti devised the original concept and had been working with the band on design and marketing concepts since the Blue Collar Records version of &quot;My Own Prison&quot;. Tremonti&#x27;s marketing and design firm, Three Mountain Group, was the game&#x27;s developer. Soon after the release of the album in late 2001, banner ads and mysterious posts began appearing on Creed fan sites, which redirected users to a website called creedquest.com. Creed Quest officially launched on January 21, 2002, and after just a couple of weeks boasted over 40,000 participants. Creed Quest was broken down into eight weekly instalments, and was played on a points system, whereby points were accumulated by successfully completing tasks, challenges, answering questions about the band, and unraveling mysteries surrounding a different fictitious short story each week. Players with the most points were then eligible for weekly prizes and one grand-prize — a trip to Universal Studios Orlando for lunch with the band, among other activities. The foundation for Creed Quest had been laid years in advance prior to the release of &quot;Human Clay&quot;. Clues for the contest could be obtained in various Creed songs and album artwork, such as the clocks seen throughout the liner notes of &quot;Human Clay&quot;. Other prizes included signed items, watches, sunglasses, and props such as the granite slab with &quot;Weathered&quot; carved into it that is seen in the artwork of the liner notes of &quot;Weathered&quot;.

==Promotion, release, and commercial performance==
To promote the album, the band made numerous television appearances, including a spot as musical guests on the November 17, 2001, episode of Saturday Night Live where they played &quot;Bullets&quot; and &quot;My Sacrifice&quot;. They also played the halftime show at the 2001 Dallas Cowboys&#x27; annual Thanksgiving Day football game on November 22. The band performed a medley of their songs &quot;My Sacrifice&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Dancing&quot; and their 1999 hit single &quot;Higher&quot;. On December 2, the band once again performed &quot;My Sacrifice&quot; at the 2001 My VH1 Music Awards and on the December 3, 2001, episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;.

&quot;Weathered&quot; was released on November 20, 2001, becoming the band&#x27;s second album to top the charts in the US, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album sold 887,000 copies in its first week of release, making it the second highest selling album of 2001 for first-week sales. By the end of 2001 the album had managed to sell over 4 million units in the US, being certified 4× platinum by the RIAA on December 19, and closed out the year of 2001 with sales of 555,092 units for the week of December 29. The album remained in the top spot for eight consecutive weeks until the week of February 2, 2002, when it was finally knocked off the top spot by Alan Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;Drive&quot;, which at the time made them only the 3rd artist in the Soundscan Era to have an album debut a number one and hold onto the spot for eight or more consecutive weeks. &quot;Weathered&quot; finished number 2 on the 2002 US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 year-end chart, and was eventually certified 6× platinum by the RIAA for sales of over 6 million units sold in just the US alone on January 6, 2003. In 2001 the album was the 15th best-selling album globally, selling 4.9 million copies. 

Like its predecessor, the singles from &quot;Weathered&quot; were also commercially successful. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;My Sacrifice&quot;, which was released in October 2001, gave the band their third top ten hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and their second highest-charting single on the Hot 100 (after &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;) as it entered the top ten at the end of 2001 and peaked at number 4 in the week of February 9, 2002. It also topped the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for nine consecutive weeks, starting in December 2001. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Bullets&quot;, experienced moderate chart success, reaching number 11 and 27 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks respectively. &quot;One Last Breath&quot; was released as the third single in May 2002, and was a massive commercial hit both in the US and internationally. The song peaked at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached the top five on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks, Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Top 40. Worldwide, the song peaked at number 43 in Australia and number 29 in New Zealand. In the United Kingdom and Ireland—where the song was released as a double A-side with &quot;Bullets&quot;—it peaked at number 47 on the UK Singles Chart and number 41 on the Irish Singles Chart. &quot;Hide&quot; was released as an International single in the form of an EP with the album versions of &quot;Bullets&quot; and &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, reaching number 65 in Australia. &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Dancing&quot; was released as the fifth single in October 2002, reaching 24 on the US Adult Top 40 and 48 in Australia. The album&#x27;s final single, the title track, was releases the next month and peaked at number 7 on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks and 30 on the Alternative Airplay chart.

The album had four music videos created for it: &quot;My Sacrifice&quot; in 2001, followed by &quot;Bullets&quot;, &quot;One Last Breath&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Dancing&quot; in 2002. A two-disc version of &quot;Weathered&quot; was released and contained a VCD with three music videos made for Creed&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Human Clay&quot;.

==Critical reception==
The album received mixed reviews, with some critics feeling that the album lacked creativity and liveliness, labeling &quot;Weathered&quot; as being &quot;unimaginative&quot;, &quot;predictable&quot; and too serious and pretentious. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote in his 2 out of 5 star review that: &quot;Their hearts are in the right place -- let it never be said that they&#x27;re only in this for the money or the fame; they even advertise Stapp&#x27;s With Arms Wide Open Foundation charity in the liner notes -- but the earnestness in their approach is magnified by their resolutely unimaginative neo-grunge.&quot; Although he praises the band&#x27;s more experimental efforts noting the Cherokee Indian prayer on &quot;Who&#x27;s Got My Back&quot; and bringing in the Tallahassee Boys&#x27; Choir for &quot;Don&#x27;t&#x27; Stop Dancing&quot;, he felt Creed had failed to break from their template and that the album was &quot;simply another Creed record.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; also gave the album 2 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Sal Cinquemani praising the track &quot;Bullets&quot;, but felt many songs including &quot;My Sacrifice&quot;, &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot; were overly self-righteous and that &quot;the song&#x27;s message gets lost in the same hollow pit of obscurity as the band&#x27;s previously uplifting efforts.&quot; He also praised the song &quot;Who&#x27;s Got My Back&quot;, but states that the song predictably trumpets into typical testosterone-rock.

Some reviewers were more receptive to the album, commending the band&#x27;s restrained, and morose approach as well as the nuance of the album. James Hunter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 3 and half stars out of 5, citing tracks such as &quot;My Sacrifice&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Got My Back&quot; and &quot;Stand Here With Me&quot; as album highlights. He writes: &quot;Weathered is rock of unusual focus and arrest, a beautifully distressed dance of sustained style and unapologetic emotion.&quot; Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the album 3 out of 5 stars. She notes that although the album&#x27;s lack of levity begins to take its toll over the course of the record, &quot;Weathered&quot; is still worth listening to &quot;for those who want a dose of spirituality with their nu metal.&quot; In his 8 out of 10 star review of the album, Thomas Kupfer of &quot;Rock Hard&quot; states: &quot;The new album proves once again that Creed doesn&#x27;t work according to the truisms of big business. As with its predecessors, the production was carried out under the guidance of producer John Kurzweg and the original sound was only refined with nuances.&quot; He asserts that the title track is the band&#x27;s &quot;most compact performance of the trio to date&quot;, as well as praising some of the calmer moments on the album including &quot;Who&#x27;s Got My Back&quot;.

==Tour==
The &quot;Weathered&quot; tour kicked off on January 16, 2002, with an hour special VH1 &quot;Opening Night Live&quot; performance in Atlanta, Georgia, at the Philips Arena. The program also featured interviews by radio and television personality Aamer Haleem with Stapp, Tremonti and drummer Scott Phillips in Florida. After a successful opening night, the tour quickly hit its first snag just two weeks later when on January 30, Mark Tremonti&#x27;s mother passed away, forcing the band to reschedule their February 1 performance in East Rutherford, New Jersey at the Continental Airlines Arena. On February 19, 2002, Creed played at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, during the medals ceremony. The band mostly performed songs from &quot;Weathered&quot; as well as songs from their previous two albums. American dates continued until February 23, when the band performed their rescheduled show in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The band then embarked on a half dozen international tour dates in March in Australia and New Zealand.

The band returned to the US and had originally planned to do more shows in April, followed by a European tour in May and June, and then a full-scale North American run from July until the fall. But on April 19, Stapp was involved in a serious automobile accident when he was on his way to shoot the video for &quot;One Last Breath&quot;. At around 1:40 in the afternoon, Stapp, while driving his Cadillac SUV on Interstate 4 in Florida, was struck from behind by a Ford SUV. Stapp&#x27;s vehicle was rear-ended by the other vehicle that, according to Stapp, was going at &quot;probably 50 or 60 miles per hour,&quot;. Stapp was sent flying forward in his vehicle, with his body hitting the steering wheel and his head hitting the windshield. The officer on the scene reported no injuries, but Stapp soon realized he had not gone unscathed while calling his manager after the accident. He suffered a concussion from the whiplash and from hitting the windshield. Although severely injured, Stapp still managed to show up the next day and shoot the music video, but the band&#x27;s April shows as well as the European tour had to be cancelled. Things went bad to worse after an MRI later revealed the extent of Stapp&#x27;s injuries including a bulging disk between two vertebrae in his neck, a smashed disk in his lower back, and an adjacent missing disk from a congenital condition that likely worsened the situation.

Creed resumed the North American portion of their tour starting on July 11 in Norfolk, Virginia. During the fall portion of their tour, the band hit yet another bump in the road when Stapp was diagnosed with acute laryngitis due to the swelling of his vocal cords. Creed was forced to postpone nine dates at the beginning of their fall tour and almost had to pull out of a live performance at Alcatraz Island off of the San Francisco coast on October 10. However, the band still played the show since they had booked the show two weeks prior as a favor to VH1 when the previously scheduled artist canceled at the last minute. Before the show, Stapp was given a shot of anti-inflammatory medication Decadron, to temporarily ease the swelling of his vocal cords, and the set had to be shortened then what was originally planned. Stapp lamented that &quot;This ambitious tour schedule ultimately proved to be too aggressive,&quot;.

===AllState Arena, Chicago Incident===
As the band wrapped up their tour in December 2002, the band played one of their most infamous shows on the 29th at the Allstate Arena in Chicago, Illinois, where Stapp suffered a mental breakdown on stage, forcing the band to cut the set short just three songs in. Prior to the performance Stapp, who was addicted to painkillers and battling alcoholism at the time, mixed his medication with alcohol causing him to become inebriated. As Stapp stumbled onto the stage, he was so intoxicated that he began rolling around, laying flat on his back while struggling to get back up, was unable to sing any of the lyrics to the songs, slammed his microphone on the ground, and at one point even passed out mid-performance. The audience began to heavily boo Stapp as he proceeded to leave the stage, only to return ten minutes later and miss all of his cues, causing the rest of the band to improvise by playing a number of unplanned solos. Although the band issued an apology to their fans via email, they soon found themselves involved in a lawsuit with two of the audience members from the show, Philip Berenz and Chad Costino, who alleged that Creed owed refunds to the 15,000 members of the audience, totalling $2 million in damages. Although the lawsuit was ultimately thrown out by the court, the band&#x27;s reputation had been badly damaged. Creed played their final show of the tour on December 31, 2002, with 3 Doors Down. In June 2004, the band announced their break-up.

<doc id="168473" wikidata="Q123089" url="?curid=168473" title="Benjamin Constant">
<text>Henri-Benjamin Constant de Rebecque (; 25 October 1767 – 8 December 1830), or simply Benjamin Constant, was a Swiss and French political thinker, activist and writer on political theory and religion.

A committed republican from 1795, Constant backed the coup d&#x27;état of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797) and the following one on 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799). During the Consulat, in 1800 he became the leader of the Liberal Opposition. Having upset Napoleon and left France to go to Switzerland then to the Kingdom of Saxony, Constant nonetheless sided with him during the Hundred Days and became politically active again during the French Restoration. He was elected Député in 1818 and remained in post until his death in 1830. Head of the Liberal opposition, known as &quot;Indépendants&quot;, he was one of the most notable orators of the Chamber of Deputies of France, as a proponent of the parliamentary system. During the July Revolution, he was a supporter of Louis Philippe I ascending the throne.

Besides his numerous essays on political and religious themes, Constant also wrote on romantic love. His autobiographical &quot;Le Cahier rouge&quot; (1807) gives an account of his love for Madame de Staël, whose protégé and collaborator he became, especially in the Coppet circle, and a successful novella, &quot;Adolphe&quot; (1816), are good examples of his work on this topic.

Constant was a fervent liberal of the early 19th century. He refined the concept of liberty, defining it as a condition of existence that allowed the individual to turn away interference from the state or society. His ideas influenced the Trienio Liberal movement in Spain, the Liberal Revolution of 1820 in Portugal, the Greek War of Independence, the November uprising in Poland, the Belgian Revolution, and liberalism in Brazil and Mexico.

==Biography==
Henri-Benjamin Constant was born in Lausanne to the Constant de Rebecque family, descendants of French Huguenots who had fled from Artois to Switzerland during the French Wars of Religion in the 16th century. His father, Jules Constant de Rebecque, served as a high-ranking officer in the Dutch States Army, like his grandfather, his uncle and his cousin Jean Victor de Constant Rebecque. When Constant&#x27;s mother, Henriette-Pauline de Chandieu-Villars, died soon after his birth, both his grandmothers took care of him. Private tutors educated him in Brussels (1779) and in the Netherlands (1780). While at the Protestant University of Erlangen (1783), he gained access to the court of Duchess Sophie Caroline Marie of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. He had to leave after an affair with a girl, and moved to the University of Edinburgh. There he lived at the home of Andrew Duncan and was befriended by James Mackintosh and Malcolm Laing. When he left the city, he promised to pay back his gambling debts.

In 1787, Constant returned to continental Europe, travelling on horseback through Scotland and England. In those years European nobility, with their prerogatives, came under heavy attack from those, like Constant, who were influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on Inequality&quot;. Constant&#x27;s family criticized him for leaving out part of his last name. In Paris, at the home of Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard he became acquainted with Isabelle de Charriere, a 46-year-old Dutch woman of letters, who later helped publish Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot;, and who knew his uncle David-Louis Constant de Rebecque extremely well by virtue of a 15-year correspondence. While he stayed at her home in Colombier Switzerland, together they wrote an epistolary novel. She acted as a maternal mentor to him until Constant&#x27;s appointment to the court of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel that required him to move north. He left the court when the War of the First Coalition began in 1792.

In Braunschweig, Constant married Wilhelmina von Cramm, but she divorced him in 1793. In September 1794, he met and became interested in the famous and wealthy already married Germaine de Staël, herself brought up on the principles of Rousseau. They both admired Jean Lambert Tallien and Talleyrand. Their intellectual collaboration between 1795 and 1811 made them one of the most celebrated intellectual couples of the time.

===Paris===
After the Reign of Terror in France (1793–1794), Constant became an advocate of bicameralism and of an assembly like the Parliament of Great Britain. In revolutionary France this strand of political thought resulted in the Constitution of the Year III, the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients. In 1799, after 18 Brumaire, Constant was reluctantly appointed, on the insistence of Abbe Sieyes, by Napoleon Bonaparte to the Tribunat, despite grave reservations on the latter&#x27;s part. Eventually, in 1802, the first consul confirmed in his doubts, forced Constant to withdraw because of the tenor of his speeches and his close connection with Mme de Staël. Constant became acquainted with Julie Talma, the salonnière wife of actor François-Joseph Talma, who wrote many letters to him of compelling human interest.

In 1800, the Plot of the rue Saint-Nicaise, an attempt to assassinate Napoleon, failed. Nevertheless, in 1803, at a time when Britain and France were at peace, Jean Gabriel Peltier, while living in England, argued that Napoleon should be assassinated. The lawyer James Mackintosh defended the French refugee Peltier against a libel suit instigated by Napoleon – then First Consul of France. Mackintosh&#x27;s speech was widely published in English and also across Europe in a French translation by Madame de Staël. She was forced to leave Paris as a result.

De Staël, disappointed by French rationalism, became interested in German romanticism. She and Constant set out for Prussia and Saxony and travelled with her two children to Weimar. Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel welcomed them the day after their arrival. In Weimar they met Friedrich von Schiller. Due to illness Johann Wolfgang Goethe at first hesitated. In Berlin, they met August Wilhelm Schlegel, and his brother, Friedrich Schlegel. Constant left de Staël in Leipzig and in 1806 lived in Rouen and Meulan, where he started work on his novel &quot;Adolphe&quot;. In 1808, he secretly married Caroline von Hardenberg, a woman who had been divorced twice, (she was related to Novalis and to Karl August von Hardenberg). He moved back to Paris in 1814, where the French Restoration took place and Louis XVIII had become king. As a member of the Council of State, Constant proposed a constitutional monarchy. He became friends with Madame Récamier while he fell out with Germaine de Staël, who had asked him to pay back his gambling debts when their daughter, Albertine, married Victor de Broglie. During the Hundred Days of Napoleon, who had become more liberal, Constant fled to the Vendée, but returned when he was invited several times to the Tuileries to set up changes for the Charter of 1815.

After the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815), Constant moved to London with his wife. In 1817, the year when Madame de Staël died, he was back in Paris and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower legislative house of the Restoration-era government. One of its most eloquent orators, he became a leader of the parliamentary bloc first known as the &quot;Independents&quot; and later as &quot;liberals&quot;. He became an opponent of Charles X of France during the Restoration
between 1815 and 1830.

In 1822, Goethe praised Constant in the following terms:

I spent many instructive evenings with Benjamin Constant. Whoever recollects what this excellent man accomplished in [later] years, and with what zeal he advanced without wavering along the path which, once chosen, was forever followed, realizes what noble aspirations, as yet undeveloped, were fermenting within him.

A Freemason, in 1830 King Louis Philippe I gave Constant a large sum of money to help him pay off his debts, and appointed him to the Conseil d&#x27;Etat. Constant is said to have fathered Albertine de Staël-Holstein (1797–1838), who later married Victor de Broglie (1785–1870). Constant died in Paris on 8 December 1830 and was buried in the Père Lachaise cemetery.

==Political philosophy==


===Ancient and modern freedom===
One of the first thinkers to go by the name of &quot;liberal&quot;, Constant looked to Britain rather than to ancient Rome for a practical model of freedom in a large mercantile society. He drew a distinction between the &quot;Liberty of the Ancients&quot; and the &quot;Liberty of the Moderns&quot;. The Liberty of the Ancients was a participatory republican liberty, which gave the citizens the right to influence politics directly through debates and votes in the public assembly. To support this degree of participation, citizenship was a burdensome moral obligation requiring a considerable investment of time and energy. Generally, this required a sub-society of slaves to do much of the productive work, leaving the citizens free to deliberate on public affairs. Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous male societies, in which they could be conveniently gathered together in one place to transact public affairs.

The Liberty of the Moderns, in contrast, was based on the possession of civil liberties, the rule of law, and freedom from excessive state interference. Direct participation would be limited: a necessary consequence of the size of modern states, and also the inevitable result of having created a mercantile society in which there were no slaves but almost everybody had to earn a living through work. Instead, the voters would elect representatives, who would deliberate in Parliament on behalf of the people and would save citizens from daily political involvement.

===Critique of the French Revolution===
Constant criticised several aspects of the French Revolution, and the failures of the social and political upheaval. He stated how the French attempted to apply ancient republican liberties to a modern state. Constant realized that freedom meant drawing a line between a person&#x27;s private life and that of state interference. He praised the noble spirit of regenerating the state; however, he stated that it was naïve for writers to believe that two thousand years had not brought some changes in the customs and needs of the people. The dynamics of the state had changed. Ancient populations paled in comparison to the size of modern countries. He even argued that with a large population, man had no role in government regardless of its form or type. Constant emphasised how citizens in ancient states found more satisfaction in the public sphere and less in their private lives whereas modern people favoured their private life.

Constant&#x27;s repeated denunciation of despotism pervaded his critique of French political philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Abbé de Mably. These writers, influential in the French Revolution, according to Constant, mistook authority for liberty and approved any means of extending the action of the state. Alleged reformers used the model of public force of the Ancien Régime, and organised the most absolute despotism in the name of the Republic. He continually condemned despotism, citing the contradiction of a liberty derived from despotism, and the vacuous nature of this ideology.

Furthermore, Constant pointed to the detrimental nature of the Reign of Terror as an inexplicable delirium. In François Furet&#x27;s words, Constant&#x27;s &quot;entire political thought&quot; revolved around this question, namely the problem of how to justify the Terror. Constant understood the revolutionaries&#x27; disastrous over-investment in the political sphere. The French revolutionaries such as the Sans-culottes were the primary force in the streets. They promoted constant vigilance in public. Constant pointed out how despite the most obscure life, the quietest existence, the most unknown name, it offered no protection during the Reign of Terror. The pervasive mob mentality deterred many right thinking people and helped to usher in despots such as Napoleon.

===Commerce preferable to war===
Constant believed that, in the modern world, commerce was superior to war. He attacked Napoleon&#x27;s belligerence, on the grounds that it was illiberal and no longer suited to modern commercial social organization. Ancient Liberty tended to rely on war, whereas a state organized on the principles of Modern Liberty would tend to be at peace with all other peaceful nations.


Constant believed that if liberty were to be salvaged from the aftermath of the Revolution, then the chimera of Ancient Liberty had to be reconciled with the practical to achieve Modern Liberty. England, since the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and the United Kingdom after 1707, had demonstrated the practicality of Modern Liberty and Britain was a constitutional monarchy. Constant concluded that constitutional monarchy was better suited than republicanism to maintaining Modern Liberty. He was instrumental in drafting the &quot;Acte Additional&quot; of 1815, which transformed Napoleon&#x27;s restored rule into a modern constitutional monarchy. This was only to last for &quot;One Hundred Days&quot; before Napoleon was defeated, but Constant&#x27;s work nevertheless provided a means of reconciling monarchy with liberty. Indeed, the French Constitution (or Charter) of 1830 could be seen as a practical implementation of many of Constant&#x27;s ideas: a hereditary monarchy existing alongside an elected Chamber of Deputies and a senatorial Chamber of Peers, with the executive power vested in responsible ministers. Thus, although often ignored in France, because of his Anglo-Saxon sympathies, Constant succeeded in contributing in a profound (albeit indirect) way to French constitutional traditions.

===Constitutional monarchy===
Constant developed a new theory of constitutional monarchy, in which royal power was intended to be a neutral power, protecting, balancing and restraining the excesses of the other active powers (the executive, legislature, and judiciary). This was an advance on the prevailing theory in the English-speaking world, which, following the opinion of William Blackstone, the 18th-century English jurist, had regarded the King as head of the executive branch.

In Constant&#x27;s scheme, the executive power would be entrusted to a Council of Ministers (or Cabinet) who, although appointed by the King, were ultimately accountable to Parliament. In making this clear theoretical distinction between the powers of the King (as head of state) and the ministers (as Executive), Constant was responding to the political reality which had become apparent in Britain for more than a century: that is, the ministers, and not the King, are responsible actors, and the King &quot;reigns but does not rule&quot;. This was important for the development of parliamentary government in France and elsewhere. The King was not to be a powerless cipher in Constant&#x27;s scheme. He would have many powers, including the power to make judicial appointments, to dissolve the Chamber and call new elections, to appoint the peers, and to dismiss ministers – but he would not be able to govern, make policy, or direct the administration, since that would be the task of the responsible ministers. This theory was literally applied in Brazil (1824) and Portugal (1826), where the King/Emperor was explicitly given &quot;Moderating Powers&quot; in addition to the executive power. Elsewhere (for example, the 1848 &quot;Statuto albertino&quot; of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which later became the basis of the Italian constitution from 1861) the executive power was notionally vested in the King, but was exercised only by the responsible ministers. He advocated the separation of powers as a basis for a liberal State, but unlike Montesquieu and most of the liberal thinkers, he advocated four powers instead of three. They were:

# the Neutral Power of the Monarch,
# the Executive,
# the Legislative,
# the Judiciary.
Thus the Moderating Power was a monarch, a type of judge, who was not part of government, but served as a neutral power to the government, the Executive Power was vested in the ministers that the monarch appointed and they were, collectively, the head of government, the Representative Powers were a separation of the Monstesquieu&#x27;s Legislative power, with the Representative Power of Opinion being an elected body to represent the opinion of the citizenry and the Representative Power of Tradition was a hereditary House of Peers and the judiciary was similar to the Montesquieu&#x27;s Judicial Power. Constant&#x27;s other concerns included a &quot;new type of federalism&quot;: a serious attempt to decentralize French government through the devolution of powers to elected municipal councils. This proposal reached fruition in 1831, when elected municipal councils (albeit on a narrow franchise) were created.

=== Imperialism and conquest ===
Constant was an opponent of imperialism and conquest, denouncing French colonial policy in the West Indies and elsewhere as racist, unjust, and a violation of basic principles of human equality. He supported an extension of civil and political rights to non-white colonial subjects. He supported the Haitian revolution, and argued that the institutions set up by Haitians were evidence that non-Europeans could found institutions equivalent to those of Europeans. He was a staunch proponent of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire.

==Comparative religion==
Aside from his political and literary output, Constant spent forty years working on religion and religious feeling. His publications demonstrate his desire to grasp this social phenomenon inherent to human nature, which, in whatever forms it may present, is always a search for perfectibility. If its manifestations become rigid, splitting becomes inevitable. Thus, however religious feeling may present, it needs to adapt and evolve.

Constant is adamant that political authority should not meddle in the religious beliefs of the citizenry, even to defend them. In his view it is up to each person to decide where to seek their consolation, moral compass or faith. External authority cannot act upon someone&#x27;s convictions, it can only act upon their interests. He also condemns a religion that is commonly regarded as utilitarian, since it degrades authentic religious feeling.

Constant considers that it was necessary for polytheism to decline in line with human progress. The more humans progress in their understanding, the more beneficial the effects of theism. Belief in a god has itself evolved. Christianity, especially Protestantism is, he argues, its most tolerant form and an indicator of intellectual, moral and spiritual evolution.

==Novels==
Constant published only one novel during his lifetime, &quot;Adolphe&quot; (1816), the story of a young, indecisive man&#x27;s disastrous love affair with an older mistress. A first-person novel in the sentimentalist tradition, &quot;Adolphe&quot; examines the thoughts of the young man as he falls in and out of love with Ellenore, a woman of uncertain virtue. Constant began the novel as an autobiographical tale of two loves, but decided that the reading public would object to serial passions. The love affair depicted in the finished version of the novel is thought to be based on Constant&#x27;s affair with Anna Lindsay, who describes the affair in her correspondence (published in the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;, December 1930 – January 1931). The book has been compared to Chateaubriand&#x27;s &quot;René&quot; or Mme de Stael&#x27;s &quot;Corinne&quot;. As a young man, Constant became acquainted with a literary friend of his uncle, David-Louis Constant de Rebecque. She was Isabelle de Charrière, a Dutch woman of letters with whom he jointly wrote an epistolary novel, under the title, &quot;Les Lettres d&#x27;Arsillé fils, Sophie Durfé et autres&quot;.

==Legacy==
The importance of Constant&#x27;s writings on the liberty of the ancients and of that of his time has dominated understanding of his work, as has his critique of the French Revolution. The British philosopher and historian of ideas, Sir Isaiah Berlin has acknowledged his debt to Constant.

Constant&#x27;s wider literary and cultural writings (most importantly the novella &quot;Adolphe&quot; and his extensive history of comparative religion) emphasised the importance of self-sacrifice and effect of human emotions as a basis for social living. Thus, while he pleaded for individual liberty as vital for individual and moral development and appropriate for modernity, he felt that egoism and self-interest were not part of a true definition of individual liberty. Emotional authenticity and fellow-feeling were critical. In this, his moral and religious thought was strongly influenced by the moral writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and German thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, whom he read in reference to his religious history.

<text>BC United (BCU), known from 1903 until 2023 as the British Columbia Liberal Party or BC Liberals, is a provincial political party in British Columbia, Canada. The party has been described as conservative, neoliberal, and occupying a centre-right position on the left–right political spectrum. The party commonly describes itself as a &quot;free enterprise coalition&quot; and draws support from members of both the federal Liberal and Conservative parties. From 1991 to 2024, BC United was the main centre-right opposition to the centre-left New Democratic Party (NDP). Once affiliated with the Liberal Party of Canada, the British Columbia Liberal Party became independent in 1987. The party changed its name to BC United on April 12, 2023.

Until the 1940s, British Columbia politics were dominated by the Liberal Party and rival Conservative Party. The Liberals formed government from 1916 to 1928 and again from 1933 to 1941. From 1941 to 1952, the two parties governed in a coalition (led by a Liberal leader) to counter the ascendant Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. The coalition was defeated in the 1952 election by the new Social Credit Party, and the party went into decline, eventually losing its presence in the legislature in the 1979 election. It returned to the legislature in the 1991 election, coming in second and forming the Official Opposition, through the efforts of leader Gordon Wilson. Wilson lost a leadership challenge to Gordon Campbell in 1994. Under Campbell&#x27;s leadership, the BC Liberals began to shift rightwards and distance themselves from the federal party. In the 2001 election, the Liberals won an overwhelming majority, which they held under Campbell and his successor Christy Clark until shortly after the 2017 election. The party remained in Opposition after losing the 2020 election. After a notable decline in polls and floor-crossings to a resurgent Conservative Party, BC United opted to not contest the 2024 election and formally endorsed the Conservatives.

Eight party leaders have served as premier of British Columbia: Harlan Brewster, John Oliver, John MacLean, Duff Pattullo, John Hart, Boss Johnson, Gordon Campbell, and Christy Clark. Since the 2022 leadership election, the party has been led by Kevin Falcon. 

==History==
=== First government: 1916–1928 ===
The divided Conservatives faced the Liberals in the election of 1916 and lost. The Liberals formed a government under Harlan Carey Brewster. Brewster had become leader of the Opposition and was elected party leader in March 1912. He lost his seat a few weeks later in the 1912 election, which returned no Liberals at all. In 1916, he won election to the legislature again through a by-election and led his party to victory in a general election later that year by campaigning on a reform platform. Brewster promised to end patronage in the civil service, end political machines, improve workman&#x27;s compensation and labour laws, bring in votes for women, and other progressive reforms.

The government brought in women&#x27;s suffrage, instituted prohibition, and combated political corruption before his unexpected death in 1918. He is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia. John Oliver succeeded Brewster as premier when Brewster died in 1918. Oliver&#x27;s government developed the produce industry in the Nanook Valley, and tried to persuade the federal government to lower the freight rate for rail transport. The party managed a bare majority win in the 1920 election and only managed to govern after the 1924 election with the support of the two Independent Liberals.

=== Opposition and the Great Depression: 1928–1933 ===
The Liberals managed to increase their vote in the 1928 election but lost close to half their seats. With the onset of the Great Depression and the implosion of the government of Simon Fraser Tolmie, the Liberals won the 1933 election.

=== Duff Pattullo: 1933–1941 ===
The 1933 election brought into power Duff Pattullo and introduced into the legislature the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), a new social-democratic and democratic socialist opposition party. Pattullo wanted an activist government to try to deal with the depression through social programs and support of the unemployed. Canada has been recognized as the hardest hit by the Great Depression, and western Canada the hardest hit within Canada. Pattullo&#x27;s attempts were often at odds with the federal government in Ottawa. Pattullo was also an advocate for British Columbia, and suggested the annexation of Yukon by BC, and the construction of the Alaska Highway to reduce the power of eastern Canada over BC. In the 1937 general election, his government was re-elected running on the slogan of &quot;socialized capitalism&quot;.

=== &quot;The Coalition&quot;: 1941–1951 ===
The alternating government with the Conservatives came to an end with the rise of the CCF, who managed to be the Official Opposition from 1933 to 1937 and were one seat less than the Conservatives in the 1937 election. In the 1941 election, the CCF came second. The election did not give the Liberals the majority they hoped for. John Hart became the premier and Liberal leader in 1941 when Pattullo refused to go into coalition with the Conservatives. The Liberal members removed Patullo as leader and Hart formed a Liberal–Conservative coalition government, known in BC history as &quot;the Coalition &quot;. From 1941 to 1945, Hart governed at a time of wartime scarcity, when all major government projects were postponed. The coalition government was re-elected in the 1945 election. In that contest, Liberals and Conservatives ran under the same banner.

After 1945, Hart undertook an ambitious program of rural electrification, hydroelectric and highway construction. Hart&#x27;s most significant projects were the construction of Highway 97 to northern British Columbia (of which the Prince George–Dawson Creek segment is now named in his honour) and the Bridge River Power Project, which was the first major hydroelectric development in British Columbia. He established the BC Power Commission, a forerunner of BC Hydro, to provide power to smaller communities that were not serviced by private utilities. In December 1947, Hart retired as premier. The Conservative Party agitated for its leader, Herbert Anscomb, to succeed Hart as premier. Still, the Liberals outnumbered the Tories in the coalition caucus. Hart was followed by another Liberal, Boss Johnson, with Anscomb as deputy premier and minister of finance.

Johnson&#x27;s government introduced universal hospital insurance and a 3% provincial sales tax to pay for it. It expanded the highway system, extended the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, and negotiated the Alcan Agreement, which facilitated construction of the Kenny Dam. The government also coped with the 1948 flooding of the Fraser River, declaring a state of emergency and beginning a program of diking the river&#x27;s banks through the Fraser Valley. Johnson is also noted for appointing Nancy Hodges as the first female Speaker in the Commonwealth. The Liberal-Conservative coalition government won the 1949 election – at 61% the greatest percentage of the popular vote in BC history. Tensions had grown between the coalition partners and within both parties. The Liberal Party executive voted to terminate the coalition and Johnson dropped his Conservative ministers in January 1952, resulting in a short-lived minority government which soon collapsed.

===1952 election===
In order to prevent the CCF from winning in a three-party competition, the government introduced instant-runoff voting, with the expectation that Conservative voters would list the Liberals as their second choice and vice versa. Voters, however, were looking for alternatives. More voters chose British Columbia Social Credit League ahead of any other party as their second choice. Social Credit went on to emerge as the largest party when the ballots were counted in the 1952 general election. Social Credit&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader during the election, W. A. C. Bennett, formerly a Conservative, was formally named party leader after the election.

At the 1953 general election, the Liberals were reduced to four seats, taking 23.36% of the vote. Arthur Laing defeated Tilly Rolston in Vancouver Point Grey. Although Social Credit won a majority of seats in the legislature, their finance minister Einar Gunderson was defeated in Oak Bay by Philip Archibald Gibbs of the Liberals. Gordon Gibson Sr, a millionaire timber baron, nicknamed the &quot;Bull of the Woods&quot;, was elected for Lillooet as a Liberal.

=== Third party status: 1953–1979 ===
During the early period of this time, the Liberals&#x27; most prominent member was Gordon Gibson Sr. He was a cigar-smoking and gregarious logging contractor who could have been premier but for a major political error. He was elected in 1953 for the Lillooet riding. In 1955, the Sommers scandal surfaced, and he was the only leader in the legislature to make an issue of it. W. A. C. Bennett and his attorney general tried many tactics to stop the information from coming out. In frustration, Gibson resigned his seat and forced a by-election, hoping to make the Sommers scandal the issue. The voting system had changed, and he came a close second after Social Credit.

In the 1956 election, with the Sommers scandal still not resolved, the Liberals fared worse than in 1953. Arthur Laing lost his seat, and the party was reduced to two MLAs and 20.9% of the vote. In the 1960 election, the party won four seats with the same 20.9% of the popular vote as in 1956. In the 1963 election, the party&#x27;s caucus increased by one more MLA to five, but their share of the popular vote fell to 19.98%. In the 1966 election, the party won another seat, bringing its caucus to six, and had an increase in the vote to 20.24%. In the 1969 vote, the party lost one seat, and its share of the vote fell to 19.03%.

In 1972, the party was led into the election by a new leader, David Anderson, who had been elected in the 1968 federal election as an MP for the Liberal Party of Canada. He and four others managed to be elected to the legislature, but with the lowest vote in party history at 16.4%. After the British Columbia New Democratic Party (BC NDP) won the 1972 election, many supporters of the Liberal and Conservative parties defected to the Social Credit League. This coalition was able to keep the New Democrats out of power from 1975 until the 1990s. MLAs Garde Gardom, Pat McGeer and Allan Williams left the Liberals for Social Credit along with Hugh Curtis of the suddenly rejuvenated Tories. All of them became members of Social Credit Cabinets after 1975. In the 1975 election, the only Liberal to be elected was Gordon Gibson Jr. as the party scored a dismal 7.24%. David Anderson was badly defeated in his Victoria riding, placing behind the New Democrats and Social Credit.

===In the wilderness: 1979–1991===

The 1979 election was the party&#x27;s lowest point. For the second time in party history, it was shut out of the legislature. Only five candidates ran, none were elected, and the party got 0.5% of the vote. The 1983 election saw a small recovery as the party came close to a full slate of candidates, but won 2.69% of the vote. The 1986 vote was the third and last election in which the party was shut out. Its share of the popular vote improved to 6.74%.

In 1987, Gordon Wilson became the leader of the provincial Liberal Party when no one else was interested. Wilson severed formal links between the provincial Liberal party and its federal counterpart. Since the mid-1970s, most federal Liberals in BC had chosen to support the British Columbia Social Credit Party at the provincial level. For the provincial party, the intent of this separation was to reduce the influence of Social Credit members of federal party. From the federal party&#x27;s perspective, this move was equally beneficial to them, as the provincial party was heavily in debt.

Wilson set about to rebuild the provincial party as a credible third party in British Columbia politics. During the same period, the ruling Social Credit party was beset by controversy under the leadership of Bill Vander Zalm. As a result, multiple Social Credit scandals caused many voters to look for an alternative. By the time of the 1991 election, Wilson lobbied to be included in the televised Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) debate between Vander Zalm&#x27;s successor, Premier Rita Johnston and BC NDP leader Michael Harcourt. The CBC agreed, and Wilson impressed many voters with his performance. The Liberal campaign gained momentum and siphoned off much support from the Social Credit campaign. While the BC NDP won the election, the Liberals came in second with 17 seats. Wilson became leader of the Opposition.

===Official Opposition under Wilson: 1991–1993===
Wilson&#x27;s policies did not coincide with many other Liberals both in the legislature and in the party who wanted to fill the vacuum left by the collapse of Social Credit. The Liberals also proved themselves to be inexperienced, both in the legislature and in building a broad-based political movement. They had a difficult time to build a disciplined organization that could mount an effective opposition against the New Democratic Party provincial government.

In 1993, Wilson&#x27;s leadership was further damaged by revelations of his affair with fellow Liberal MLA Judi Tyabji. By this time, most of the caucus was in open revolt against his leadership. Wilson agreed to call for a leadership convention, at which he would be a candidate. Delta South MLA Fred Gingell became the leader of the Opposition while the Liberal leadership race took place.

Soon, former party leader Gordon Gibson and Vancouver mayor Gordon Campbell entered the leadership race. Campbell won decisively on the first ballot, with former party leader Gordon Gibson placing second and Wilson third. The leadership election was decided on a one-member, one-vote system through which Liberals voted for their choices by telephone. Wilson and Tyabji then left the Liberals and formed their own party, the Progressive Democratic Alliance.

===Official Opposition under Campbell: 1993–2001===
Once Campbell became leader, the Liberals adopted the moniker &quot;BC Liberals&quot; for the first time, and soon introduced a new logo and new party colours (red and blue, instead of the usual &quot;Liberal red&quot; and accompanying maple leaf). The revised name and logo was an attempt to distinguish itself more clearly in the minds of voters from the federal Liberal Party of Canada.

In early 1994, Campbell was elected to the legislature in a by-election. Under his leadership, the party began moving to the right, gaining support from members of the former Social Credit Party and, later, the provincial Reform Party. Some moderate Socreds had begun voting Liberal as far back as the Vander Zalm era. The Liberals won two former Socred seats in by-elections held in the Fraser Valley region, solidifying their claim to be the clear alternative to the existing BC NDP government. The Liberal party also filled the vacuum created on the centre-right of the BC political spectrum by Social Credit&#x27;s collapse.

In the 1996 election, the BC Liberals won the popular vote. However, much of the Liberal margin was wasted on large margins in the outer regions of the province; they only won eight seats in Vancouver and the Lower Mainland. In rural British Columbia, particularly in the Interior where the railway was the lifeblood of the local economy – the BC Liberals lost several contests because of discomfort that the electorate had with some of Campbell&#x27;s policies, principally his promise to sell BC Rail. The net result was to consign the Liberals to opposition again, though they managed to slash the NDP&#x27;s majority from 13 to three.

After the election, the BC Liberals set about making sure that there would be no repeat of 1996. Campbell jettisoned some of the less popular policy planks in his 1996 platform, most notably a promise to sell BC Rail, as the prospect of the sale&#x27;s consequences had alienated supporters in the Northern Interior ridings.

===Campbell government: 2001–2011===

After a scandal-filled second term for the BC NDP government, the BC Liberals won the 2001 election with the biggest landslide in BC history, taking 77 of 79 seats. They even managed to unseat Premier Ujjal Dosanjh in his own riding. Gordon Campbell became the seventh premier in ten years, and the first Liberal premier in almost 50 years. Campbell introduced a 25% cut in all provincial income taxes on the first day he was installed to office. The BC Liberals also reduced the corporate income tax and abolished the corporate capital tax for most businesses (a tax on investment and employment that had been introduced by the New Democrats).

Campbell&#x27;s first term was also noted for fiscal austerity, including reductions in welfare rolls and some social services, deregulation, the sale of some government assets (in particular the &quot;Fast ferries&quot; built by the previous government, which were sold off for a fraction of their price). Campbell also initiated the privatization of BC Rail, which the Liberals had promised not to sell in order to win northern ridings which had rejected the party in 1996 but reversed this promise after election, with criminal investigations connected with the bidding process resulting in the 2003 British Columbia Legislature raids and the ensuing and still-pending court case. There were several significant labour disputes, some of which were settled through government legislation but which included confrontations with the province&#x27;s doctors. Campbell also downsized the civil service, with staff cutbacks of more than fifty percent in some government departments, and despite promises of smaller government the size of cabinet was nearly doubled and parliamentary salaries raised. Governance was also re-arranged such that Deputy Ministers were now to report to the Chief of Staff in the premier&#x27;s office, rather than to their respective ministers. In the course of the cuts, hospitals, courthouses and extended care facilities around the province were shut down, particularly in smaller communities, and enforcement staff such as the BC Conservation Service were reduced to marginal levels. Various provincial parks created during the previous NDP regime were also downgraded to protected area status, meaning they could be opened for resource exploitation, and fees for use of parks were raised.

In 2003, a drug investigation known as Operation Everwhichway led to raids on government offices in the British Columbia Parliament Buildings in relation to suspect dealings concerning the sale of BC Rail to CN in a scandal which became known as &quot;Railgate&quot; and the trial of four former ministerial aides for influence peddling, breach of trust and accepting bribes.

The Liberals were re-elected in the 2005 election with a reduced majority of 7 seats (46–33). The Liberals were again re-elected in the 2009 election.

Shortly after this election the introduction of the HST was announced, contrary to promises made during the election campaign.

On November 3, 2010, facing an imminent caucus revolt over his management style and the political backlash against the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) and the controversial end to the BC Rail corruption trial and with his approval rating as low as 9% in polls, Gordon Campbell announced his resignation.

===Clark government: 2011–2017===
The party&#x27;s 2011 leadership convention was prompted by Gordon Campbell&#x27;s request to the party to hold a leadership convention &quot;at the earliest possible date&quot;. The convention elected Christy Clark as its new leader of the party on February 26, 2011. Clark and her new Cabinet were sworn in on March 14.
Under Clark, the party charted a more centrist outlook while continuing its recent tradition of being a coalition of federal Liberal and federal Conservative supporters. She immediately raised the minimum wage from $8/hour to $10.25/hour and introduced a province-wide Family Day similar to Ontario&#x27;s. Clark became premier during the aftermath of the 2008–09 recession and continued to hold the line on government spending, introducing two deficit budgets before a balanced one for the 2013–14 fiscal year, which included a tax hike on high-income British Columbians. She also sought to take advantage of BC&#x27;s liquified natural gas (LNG) reserves, positioning the budding LNG industry as a major economic development opportunity over the next decade. While the final years of Gordon Campbell&#x27;s administration had seen far-reaching and progressive environmental legislation enacted, Clark was more measured in her approach to environmental policy. While continuing with BC&#x27;s first-in-North-America carbon tax, she promised to freeze the rate during the 2013 election and her LNG development aspirations seemed to contradict greenhouse gas emissions targets set by the Campbell government in 2007. She also announced in 2012 that any future pipeline that crosses BC would have to meet five conditions that included environmental requirements and Indigenous consultation. Controversially, she indicated that one of her five conditions would be that BC receives its &quot;fair share&quot; of any revenues that accrue from increased pipeline and tanker traffic. This has put her in direct conflict with the province of Alberta, who sought increased market access for its bitumen through BC ports, yet adamantly refuse any arrangement which would see BC receive any royalties.

In 2011, Colin Hansen proposed the party change its name in order to avoid confusion with the unrelated Liberal Party of Canada and to better reflect its status as a coalition of many federal Conservative and Liberal voters. He did not propose an alternative name. Clark said she would consider a name change but was not in &quot;any rush to do it&quot;. During the 2013 election, Clark entered the campaign low in public opinion polls and trailing her main rival, Adrian Dix of the NDP, by as much as 20 points. The BC Liberals campaign slogan was &quot;Strong Economy, Secure Tomorrow&quot; and highlighted a balanced budget and strong development opportunities in the LNG sector as a reason for voters to elect them for a fourth term in office. Clark brought in strategists affiliated with the Ontario Liberal Party, such as Don Guy and Laura Miller, and federal Liberal figures, such as Mike McDonald, to run her office and campaign. The BC Liberals came from behind to secure a fourth term in office, however, Clark was defeated in her Vancouver riding but won a subsequent by-election in the Okanagan riding of Westside-Kelowna. After the election, she sought a thawing of relations between BC and Alberta over future pipeline projects, signing onto former Alberta premier Alison Redford&#x27;s National Energy Strategy. In early 2014, the Liberals brought down a second straight balanced budget and introduced legislation to change BC&#x27;s liquor laws to allow liquor sales in some grocery stores and allow children to sit with adults in pubs and restaurants where liquor is served.

In the 2017 election, the BC Liberals&#x27; seat count was reduced to 43, one seat short of a majority. On May 29, 2017, after final vote counting had completed, the BC NDP and the BC Green Party agreed to a confidence and supply agreement to ensure a stable minority government. Their combined 44 seats give them an advantage over the BC Liberals&#x27; 43, which was sufficient to defeat Clark&#x27;s government on a confidence vote on June 29, 2017, after which Clark resigned as premier (effective July 18, 2017) and the lieutenant governor asked NDP leader John Horgan to form a government. Rich Coleman became the party&#x27;s interim leader following Clark&#x27;s resignation.

===Official Opposition under Wilkinson and Bond: 2018–2022===

Andrew Wilkinson was elected party leader on February 3, 2018. He served as leader of the Opposition for two years. During the 2020 general election, Wilkinson was criticized by party members, including the membership chair, for his delay in removing Laurie Throness, a candidate and former MLA who had made anti-LGBTQ statements. After the party was defeated in the election, he resigned. Shirley Bond served as the party&#x27;s interim leader until the 2022 leadership contest.

=== Falcon leadership, name change, and campaign suspension: since 2022 ===
Kevin Falcon, a minister under Campbell and Clark, was elected leader of the BC Liberals on February 5, 2022. During his leadership campaign, Falcon pledged to rename and rebrand the party. At the 2022 party convention, delegates passed a resolution to move forward with the name-change process, beginning with consultations with the party membership before putting it to a vote by the end of the year. After a province-wide survey, &quot;BC United&quot; was put forward as the potential new name for the party. The name was then put to party members on November 13, and on November 16, it was announced that the name change had been approved by roughly 80 per cent. The name change was later ratified and took effect on April 12, 2023. 

The name change preceded a significant drop in polling numbers for the party, with the BC Conservatives – led by former Liberal MLA John Rustad, who defected shortly before the name change was finalized – surpassing them as the second most popular party in the province according to polls. After polling at 33 percent in the immediate aftermath of the name change, BC United suffered a further MLA defection as BC United MLA Bruce Banman crossed the floor to the Conservatives, as the party dropped to 19 percent in the polls, 6 points behind the Conservatives by that September. In 2024, two more BC United MLAs, Lorne Doerkson and Elenore Sturko, defected to the BC Conservatives. In the second quarter of 2024, the BC Conservatives surpassed United in terms of money gained from donations. In the lead-up to the 2024 election, BC United suffered further defections from members and candidates. Some thought that the name change led to voters not knowing that BC United was a continuation of the BC Liberals; a Léger poll released in October 2023 found that a third of voters did not know about the name change. Another poll by Léger in August 2024 suggested that the party was primarily losing its traditional faction of voters who support the Conservative Party of Canada federally to the BC Conservatives.

On August 28, 2024, Falcon announced that BC United would suspend its political campaigning, with Falcon endorsing the BC Conservatives, saying &quot;John Rustad and I haven&#x27;t always agreed on everything, but one thing is clear: our province cannot take another four years of the NDP&quot;. Falcon said this was done to prevent vote splitting in competitive ridings. While 18 nominated BC United candidates, including five incumbent BC United MLAs, ran for re-election as independent or unaffiliated candidates in the 2024 British Columbia general election, none were successful. Falcon remained as leader following the election. In February 2025, former BC United MLA Karin Kirkpatrick called for him to resign saying that his continued presence was preventing the party from rebuilding and raising funds to pay its debts.

<text>Suzanne Valadon (; 23 September 1865 – 7 April 1938) was a French painter who was born Marie-Clémentine Valadon at Bessines-sur-Gartempe, Haute-Vienne, France. In 1894, Valadon became the first woman painter admitted to the . She was also the mother of painter Maurice Utrillo.

Valadon spent nearly 40 years of her life as an artist. The subjects of her drawings and paintings, such as &quot;Joy of Life&quot; (1911), included mostly female nudes, portraits of women, still lifes, and landscapes. She never attended the academy and was never confined within a set tradition or style of art. Despite not being confined to any tradition, she shocked the art world as the first woman painter to depict a male nude as well as less idealized images of women in comparison to those of her male counterparts.

She was a model for many renowned artists. Among them, Valadon appeared in such paintings as &quot;Dance at Bougival&quot; (1883) and &quot;Dance in the City&quot; by Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1883), and &quot;Suzanne Valadon&quot; (1885) and &quot;The Hangover (Suzanne Valadon)&quot; (1887–1889) by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.

== Early life ==

Valadon grew up in poverty with her mother, an unmarried laundress in Montmartre. She did not know her father. Known to be quite independent and rebellious, she attended primary school until age eleven when she began working.

She had a series of jobs that included working in a milliner&#x27;s workshop, at a factory making funeral wreaths, selling vegetables, and as a waitress. At the age of 15, she obtained a job in her most desired field: performing in the circus as an acrobat. She was able to work at the circus because of her connection with Count Antoine de La Rochefoucauld and Thèo Wagner, two symbolist painters, who were involved in decorating a circus belonging to Medrano. The circus was visited frequently by artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec and Berthe Morisot and it is speculated that this was the inspiration for a painting of Valadon by Morisot. A fall from a trapeze that injured her back is what ultimately ended her circus career after one year.

It is commonly believed that Valadon taught herself how to draw at the age of nine. In the Montmartre quarter of Paris, she pursued her interest in art, first working as a model and a muse for artists, observing and learning their techniques, as she could not afford art lessons herself. She observed and learned from artists, such as Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, before becoming a noted and successful painter in her own right.

==Model==

Valadon began working as a model in 1880 in Montmartre at age 15. She modeled for more than ten years for many different artists including Berthe Morisot, Pierre-Cécile Puvis de Chavannes, Théophile Steinlen, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jean-Jacques Henner, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. She modeled under the name &quot;Maria&quot; before being nicknamed &quot;Suzanne&quot; by Toulouse-Lautrec, after the biblical story of Susanna and the Elders as he felt that she especially preferred modeling for older artists. She was Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s lover for two years, which ended when she attempted suicide in 1888.

Valadon learned and furthered her art by observing the techniques of the artists for whom she posed. She was considered a very focused, ambitious, rebellious, determined, self-confident, and passionate woman. In the early 1890s, she befriended Edgar Degas, who was impressed by her bold line drawings and fine paintings. He purchased her work and encouraged her. She remained one of his closest friends until his death in 1917. Art historian Heather Dawkins believed that Valadon&#x27;s experience as a model added depth to her own images of nude women, which tended to be less idealized than the representations of women by the male post-impressionists.

Morisot&#x27;s 1880 drawing of Valadon as a tightrope walker preceded it, but the most recognizable early image of Valadon is in Renoir&#x27;s &quot;Dance at Bougival&quot; from 1883, the same year that she posed for &quot;Dance in the City&quot;. In 1885, Renoir painted her portrait again as &quot;Girl Braiding Her Hair&quot;. Another of his portraits of her in 1885, &quot;Suzanne Valadon&quot;, is of her head and shoulders in profile. Valadon frequented the bars and taverns of Paris with her fellow painters and she was Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s subject in his oil painting &quot;The Hangover&quot;.

==Artist==

Valadon was an acclaimed painter of her time, well-respected and championed by contemporaries such as Edgar Degas and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. She was admitted to professional associations and her works were admitted to juried exhibitions. She lived a bohemian life with rebellious vision.

Valadon&#x27;s earliest surviving signed and dated work is a self-portrait from 1883, drawn in charcoal and pastel. She produced mostly drawings between 1883 and 1893, and began painting in 1892. Her first models were family members, especially her son, mother, and niece.

Valadon began painting full-time in 1896. She painted still lifes, portraits, flowers, and landscapes that are noted for their strong composition and vibrant colors. She was, however, best known for her candid female nudes. Her work attracted attention partly because, by painting unidealized nudes, she upset the social norms of the time that had been created by male artists.

Her earliest known female nude was executed in 1892. In 1895, the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel exhibited a group of twelve etchings by Valadon that show women in various stages of their toilettes. Later, she regularly showed at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. Valadon was the first woman painter accepted as an exhibitor in the Salon de la Nationale in 1894, which is notable since competition for acceptance was fierce.

She exhibited in the Salon d&#x27;Automne from 1909, in the Salon des Independants from 1911, and in the Salon des Femmes Artistes Modernes from 1933 to 1938. Notably, Degas was the first person to purchase drawings from her, and he introduced her to other collectors, including Paul Durand-Ruel and Ambroise Vollard. Degas also taught her the skill of soft-ground etching.
After her 1895 marriage to the well-to-do banker Paul Mousis, Valadon became a full-time painter the following year. She made a shift from drawing to painting in 1909. Her first large oils for the Salon related to sexual pleasures and they were some of the first examples in modern painting with a man being an object of desire by a woman similar to that idealized treatment of women by male artists. These notable Salon paintings include &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; (&quot;Adam et Eve&quot;) (1909), &quot;Joy of Life&quot; (&quot;La Joie de vivre&quot;) (1911), and &quot;Casting the Net&quot; (&quot;Lancement du filet&quot;) (1914). In her lifetime, Valadon produced approximately 273 drawings, 478 paintings, and 31 etchings, excluding pieces given away or destroyed.

Valadon was well known during her lifetime, especially toward the end of her career, in the 1920s more specifically, as she helped to transform the female nude that depicted expression through a woman&#x27;s experience. Her works are in the collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Museum of Grenoble, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, among others.

Valadon&#x27;s painting of an acrobat, L&#x27; Acrobate ou La Roue, sold in 2017 for £75,000 by Christie&#x27;s Auction House.
===Style===

Valadon was not confined to a specific style, yet both Symbolist and Post-Impressionist aesthetics are clearly demonstrated within her work. She worked primarily with oil paint, oil pencils, pastels, and red chalk; she did not use ink or watercolor because these mediums were too fluid for her preference. Valadon&#x27;s paintings feature rich colors and bold, open brushwork often featuring firm black lines to define and outline her figures.

Valadon&#x27;s self-portraits, portraits, nudes, landscapes, and still lifes remain detached from trends and contemporaneous aspects of academic art. The subjects of Valadon&#x27;s paintings often reinvent the old master themes: women bathing, reclining nudes, and interior scenes. She preferred to paint working-class models. Art historian Patricia Mathews suggests that Valadon&#x27;s working-class status and experience as a model influenced her intimate, familiar observation of these women and their bodies. In this respect she differed from Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt, who painted mostly women, but &quot;remained well within the bounds of propriety in their subject matter&quot; because of their upper-middle-class status in French society. Valadon&#x27;s marginalized status allowed her to enter the contemporary male dominated domain of art through modeling and her lack of formal academic training may have made her less influenced by academic conventions. She has been noted for that difference in her paintings of the nude women. She resisted typical depictions of women, emphasizing class trappings and their sexual attractiveness, through her realistic depiction of unidealised and self-possessed women who are not overly sexualised. She also painted many nude self-portraits across the span of her career, the later of which displayed her aging body realistically.

Valadon emphasized the importance of the composition of her portraits over techniques such as painting expressive eyes. Her later works, such as &quot;Blue Room&quot; (1923), are brighter in color and show a new emphasis on decorative backgrounds and patterned materials.

==Personal life==

In 1883, aged 18, Valadon gave birth to a son, Maurice Utrillo. Valadon&#x27;s mother cared for Maurice while she returned to modelling. Later, Valadon&#x27;s friend Miquel Utrillo signed papers recognizing Maurice as his son, although the true paternity was never disclosed.

In 1893, Valadon began a short-lived affair with composer Erik Satie, moving to a room next to his on the . Satie became obsessed with her, calling her his &quot;&quot;, writing impassioned notes about &quot;her whole being, lovely eyes, gentle hands, and tiny feet&quot;. After six months she left, leaving him devastated.

Valadon married the stockbroker Paul Mousis in 1895. For 13 years, she lived with him in an apartment in Paris and in a house in the outlying region. In 1909, Valadon began an affair with the painter André Utter, a 23-year-old friend of her son. He became a model for her and appears as Adam in &quot;Adam et Eve&quot;, which was painted that year. She divorced Mousis in 1913. Valadon then married Utter in 1914. Utter managed her career as well as that of her son. Valadon and Utter regularly exhibited work together until the couple divorced in 1934, when Valadon was almost seventy. They continued a relationship until her death, nonetheless, and are buried together in the Saint Ouen cemetery in Paris.

Suzanne Valadon died of a stroke on 7 April 1938, at the age of 72, and was buried in Division 13 of the Cimetière de Saint-Ouen, Paris. Among those in attendance at the funeral were her friends and colleagues André Derain, Pablo Picasso, and Georges Braque.

== Feminist commentary ==
As one of the best documented French artists of the early twentieth century, Valadon&#x27;s body of work has been of great interest to feminist art historians, especially given her focus on the female form. Her work was candid and occasionally awkward, often characterized by strong lines, and her resistance to both academic and avant-garde conventions for representing the female nude have encouraged interest in her work: It has been argued that many of her images of women signal a form of resistance to some of the dominant representations of female sexuality in early twentieth-century Western art. Many of her nudes painted from the 1910s onward are heavily proportioned and sometimes awkwardly posed. The feminist critics assert that they are conspicuously at odds with the svelte, &#x27;feminine&#x27; type to be found in the imagery of both popular and &#x27;high&#x27; art. Her self-portrait from 1931, when she was 66, stands out as one of the early examples of a woman painter recording her own physical decline.

Like many other talented female artists, although she is known to have been an important modern artist, Valadon never had been given a solo exhibition by a U.S. art institution. Her first institutional solo exhibition in the U.S., at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, was scheduled to open in September 2021.

==Honors and legacy==
Both an asteroid (6937 Valadon) and a crater on Venus are named in her honor.

The small square at the base of the Montmartre funicular in Paris is named Place Suzanne Valadon. At the top of the funicular, and less than 50 meters to its east, are the steps named rue Maurice Utrillo after her son the artist.

=== Depiction in novels and plays ===
A novel based on the life of Suzanne Valadon was written by Elaine Todd Koren and was published in 2001, titled &quot;Suzanne: of Love and Art&quot;. An earlier novel by Sarah Baylis, &quot;Utrillo&#x27;s Mother&quot;, was published first in England and later in the United States. Timberlake Wertenbaker&#x27;s play, &quot;The Line&quot; (2009), traces the relationship between Valadon and Degas. Several have speculated Valadon was the basis for the character Suzanne Rouvier in the W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s 1944 novel &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;. There were many parallels between Valadon&#x27;s life and that of the Rouvier character.

Suzanne Valadon’s relationships with Edgar Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec are described in R.w. Meek’s two historical fiction novels, The Dream Collector, Book I “Sabrine &amp; Sigmund Freud” and The Dream Collector, Book II “Sabrine &amp; Vincent van Gogh.”

<text>S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is the second studio album by American rock band Incubus. It was released on September 9, 1997, by Epic and Immortal Records. The album was certified gold by the RIAA, and is the second and final release to feature Gavin Koppel (known as DJ Lyfe), who first appeared on the 1997 &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; EP. It has been occasionally considered the band&#x27;s proper debut album, due to the nature of their independent release &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot;.

==Background==
===Production===
After recording their independent debut album &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; (1995), Incubus signed a seven-record deal with Epic/Sony-affiliated Immortal Records in 1996. An EP titled &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; was released by Epic/Immortal at the beginning of 1997, and Incubus would go on a European tour with labelmates Korn and The Urge for the next few months. With &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot;, the label&#x27;s strategy was to build the band&#x27;s fanbase through touring rather than radio airplay. One of the first things the band had done after getting signed was buying new instruments, which would be used on future recordings. Drummer José Pasillas said that the band&#x27;s old instruments were &quot;falling apart&quot;. Guitarist Mike Einziger had previously been using an Ibanez RG570, and spent his money from the record company to purchase a Paul Reed Smith guitar. The four founding band members were in their early 20s at this point, and dropped out of school once getting signed, with Pasillas recalling &quot;before then, each one of us were enrolled in schools because there was part of us that wanted to appease our parents. Getting signed was our okay to drop out of school.&quot; DJ Lyfe was older than the other four members and originally joined Incubus in late 1995, following the release of &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot;. Lyfe had first met Incubus at a live show in Hollywood, where he approached them about incorporating his music into the band, claiming that it might add an interesting dimension to their sound.

Incubus&#x27;s full-length major label debut &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; would be recorded between May 1997 and June 1997. Singer Brandon Boyd said &quot;&quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; was done in six weeks at 4th Street Recording, a very small, charming studio in Santa Monica. Very different experience, but very important on this band&#x27;s existence.&quot; While the single &quot;New Skin&quot; originated a few years prior, Pasillas claimed in 2002 that for other songs they had two months to write the music. He added, &quot;it was cool for us, because we had a lot of ideas and it was a pretty compressed amount of time. The circumstances weren&#x27;t ideal — we were working in a dingy little rehearsal room — but at that time we didn&#x27;t care. We were playing music for a living.&quot; According to Pasillas, they wrote 14 songs for &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; in total.

Unlike with later Incubus albums, the songs were recorded to tape, and the band wanted to avoid creating music that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to perform live. During the recording, the band utilized older analogue gear that they described as having &quot;phat sounds and spider webs.&quot; Incubus chose Jim Wirt to produce the album, since he had worked with them on earlier recordings. Einziger believed that Wirt helped encourage their creativity during the recording of &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;, saying in 1997, &quot;he helps us come up with strange stuff and he likes it when we do. He doesn&#x27;t try to change what we do, he tries to enhance it.&quot; Einziger added in the same interview, &quot;when we signed our record deal and started working on this album, we were worried that someone would come along and tell us to hold back, and try and make our songs a little more palatable. But that never happened. They kinda just said, &#x27;do whatever you want&#x27;. With that kind of support, we just let everything kind of run wild.&quot; Pasillas similarly noted the lack of outside influence in 2017, saying &quot;we didn’t have label people coming in hovering above us making sure we weren&#x27;t wasting money. We were left to our own devices and we worked well that way.&quot; In a 2018 interview with Australian magazine &quot;HEAVY&quot;, Boyd remembered &quot;when we wrote &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; we didn&#x27;t know about any songwriting rules. It was like a chopped salad, schizophrenic album put together and we did it because we just didn’t know any better. We were just having a good time.&quot; He also believes that Incubus still hadn&#x27;t found a distinct voice of their own yet, saying in 2022 that they sounded like the offspring from a &quot;crazy orgy&quot; between Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Björk and other artists. Einziger told &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 2011 that the band developed more of their own sound on later albums since they had experienced more of the world through touring by then, and that on &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; &quot;[we sounded] like what we had been listening to.&quot;

For the liner notes, every member except DJ Lyfe and bassist Alex Katunich used a pseudonym made specifically for the album, with Boyd&#x27;s being &quot;Cornelius&quot;, Einziger&#x27;s being &quot;Jawa&quot; and Pasillas&#x27;s being &quot;Badmammajamma&quot;. The concept of using pseudonyms was carried over from &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; and &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot;, where the members had been using several different ones created specifically for those releases, including the pseudonyms &quot;Happy Knappy&quot; and &quot;Brandon of the Jungle&quot; (used by Boyd), and the pseudonyms &quot;Fabio&quot; and &quot;Dynamike&quot; (used by Einziger). Katunich used the pseudonym &quot;Dirk Lance&quot; for all three of these releases, while DJ Lyfe used the pseudonym &quot;Kid Lyfe&quot; for &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot;, before deciding to use his regular stage name for &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;.

Mastering work was done at Larrabee West Studios in Hollywood, California. When &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; was in the process of being recorded and mastered, the band went on some local mini-tours, in addition to appearing on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Spawn&quot;. The soundtrack was released on July 29, 1997, by Epic/Immortal, and featured a collaboration with DJ Greyboy called &quot;Familiar&quot;. This song also briefly appeared in the movie itself, which was released to theaters on August 1, 1997. It samples the 1960 song &quot;Theme for Doris&quot;, by jazz musician Tina Brooks. Boyd claimed in a 1997 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; interview that he had seen the &quot;Spawn&quot; movie, and described it as &quot;a really shitty movie&quot; with &quot;a great soundtrack&quot;. That year, the song &quot;Glass&quot; was also featured on a 7 inch vinyl single with the song &quot;Water &amp; Solutions&quot;, by Epic/Immortal labelmates Far. &quot;Water &amp; Solutions&quot; was taken from the album of the same name, which was recorded around the same time as &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;, but not released until March 1998. Incubus later toured with Far, and on promotional photos for 2001&#x27;s &quot;Morning View&quot;, Einziger can be seen wearing a hoodie with the cover of their 1997 EP &quot;Soon&quot;.

===Musical style and influences===
Musically, &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; has been described as alternative metal, nu metal, funk metal, and rap metal. The album incorporates elements of multiple genres, including heavy metal, funk, hip hop, techno, jazz, and electro. It was labelled as &quot;schizo funk/jazz/metal&quot; by &quot;Spin&quot; in 2001. In September 1997, &quot;Hits&quot; magazine called the album&#x27;s lighter songs &quot;loungey&quot; and &quot;almost reminiscent of Jamiroquai&quot;. &quot;Magic Medicine&quot;, described as a trip hop track, samples a recorded reading of a children&#x27;s book. Paul Elliot of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; wrote in May 1998 that &quot;at their lightest — on &#x27;Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song)&#x27; for example — Incubus are deliciously, irresistibly funky. And at their heaviest — notably on the frantic &#x27;Favorite Things&#x27; — they&#x27;re reminiscent of Faith No More at their wildest.&quot; Elliot added that people who were upset about the split of Faith No More &quot;[should go along] to an Incubus gig.&quot; &quot;The Daily Nebraskan&quot; referred to them as a &quot;funk-heavy foursome&quot; in 1998, while &quot;Billboard&quot; labelled them a funk rock band in December 1997. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Rob Kemp, &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; &quot;links funk metal to the rap-metal&quot;. Though sometimes retrospectively associated with it, the term nu metal was not yet in usage when &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; was released, but rather terms such as alternative metal, funk metal and rap metal. In 1997, Boyd said &quot;people are real quick to put labels on music, so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re going to do that with us. But we think we&#x27;re doing something cool, and judging from the responses that we&#x27;ve gotten from all over the world, others do too.&quot; Einziger has since stated that Incubus were not part of the same Southern Californian scene as bands like Korn and System of a Down during their independent years, despite having similar influences. In interviews from the late 2010s and 2020s, Boyd has said that he dislikes the nu metal label and doesn&#x27;t consider the band&#x27;s early work to be part of the movement. In a 2022 &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; interview, he remarked, &quot;we weren’t trying to fit into a particular niche at a particular time. We were just kids being influenced by a small handful of bands that we grew up with.&quot;

&quot;Revolver&quot; describe Brandon Boyd as vocally &quot;drawing on the eccentric funk-rap&quot; of Faith No More, Primus and Red Hot Chili Peppers. They consider him to have a &quot;goofy yet also badass presence&quot; on &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; Boyd has cited Faith No More&#x27;s vocalist Mike Patton as being an influence from since he was an early teenager, as well as Patton&#x27;s side project Mr. Bungle, who were similarly known for mixing a wide array of genres. Through Mr. Bungle, Boyd also went on to become a fan of avant-garde musician John Zorn, who produced their 1991 debut album. In a 2003 interview with the &quot;Philippine Daily Inquirer&quot;, Boyd said that around this period, both he and Einziger gravitated towards more experimental artists that &quot;you&#x27;ll never hear on the radio&quot;. Alex Katunich uses a slap bass playing style on the album, and has said he was influenced by funk music since he was a young child, and got an album of Disney songs done in disco style. When he became a teenager, he said Faith No More&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;The Real Thing&quot; began influencing him, in addition to becoming influenced by Mr. Bungle and other funk metal bands, such as Infectious Grooves, Primus and Red Hot Chili Peppers. In a 1998 interview, Boyd was asked about whether Incubus was influenced by Faith No More, who had broken up in April of that year, and he commented, &quot;there&#x27;s a definite influence from Faith No More. All of us have been listening to that band since when we were really young. We were like 14 or something when that album [&quot;The Real Thing&quot;] came out. They were an awesome band, they did some really groundbreaking things in their time, and it&#x27;s kind of a bummer to hear that they broke up.&quot; Boyd also noted in October 1997 that they were frequently compared to both Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, saying &quot;when people do try and compare us, it&#x27;s usually with those two bands.&quot;

In addition to these influences, the band became interested in emerging electronic genres like drum and bass around the making of &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;, with their previous full-length album &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; having no influence from electronic genres. While playing at European festivals with Korn and The Urge during early 1997, they recall being exposed to foreign electronic acts such as The Chemical Brothers. During the subsequent &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; tour, the band sometimes created improvisational pieces of drum and bass music in between their songs, and this was how the song &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot; originated, with it being recorded for their next album &quot;Make Yourself&quot; (1999). &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; was also the band&#x27;s first release to be written with turntables, since several of the songs on &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; were re-recordings of tracks from &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot;. In a 2000 interview, Boyd remembered that when Incubus first met DJ Lyfe and he suggested adding his instrument, they were intrigued by this idea. They decided to incorporate the instrument after only a single rehearsal with Lyfe, with Boyd recalling that &quot;it just began to present itself as probably a very cool new instrument that could offer lots and lots of opportunities sonically.&quot; AllMusic describe the use of turntables as being the main hip hop element on the album, which primarily features melodic, sung vocals rather than rapping or other vocal styles such as screaming. The album utilizes other instruments also not traditionally associated with rock music, including the saxophone and the digeridoo and djembe (which originate from Australia and West Africa). Boyd can be heard playing the digeridoo at the beginning of the opening track &quot;Redefine&quot;, and he would bring one with him on the tour for &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;.

===Songs===
About the opening track &quot;Redefine&quot;, Boyd said in 1997:
On the single &quot;New Skin&quot;, he further elaborated:
The song &quot;Favorite Things&quot;, according to Boyd, related to the topic of religion:
&quot;Favorite Things&quot; also includes a sample of the 1959 track &quot;Flamenco Fantasy&quot;, by easy listening group the 101 Strings Orchestra. The song has a similar title to &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, from the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; musical and film, with both songs repeatedly mentioning their titles in the lyrics. However, it does not musically reference &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;. The single &quot;A Certain Shade of Green&quot; has been described as being a song about procrastination. The line &quot;Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.?&quot; is a reference to an interpretation of the Mayan calendar which dictated that the world would end on December 21, 2012. Boyd did not believe this to be true, but it was on his mind as his mother was researching it for a book called &quot;Maya Memory: The Glory That Was Palenque&quot;.

While recording &quot;Nebula&quot;, Boyd said in 1997, &quot;we found out what it&#x27;s like to actually plug a phaser pedal into the wall while it&#x27;s on. It sounds like a laser gun, and that&#x27;s the first sound you hear in &#x27;Nebula&#x27;.&quot; He added that for the song, &quot;we used these walkie-talkies for children that have this Slinky-like coil between them. When you talk through them and hit the coil, it makes this natural reverb, like talking in another dimension.&quot;

&quot;Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song)&quot; was the first love ballad the band wrote, but was written in a less serious manner than later songs touching on similar subjects, such as &quot;Stellar&quot;. It featured saxophonist Jeremy Wasser of Hoobastank, a band which grew up in the same neighborhood of Southern California. The members of Hoobastank had known Incubus since 1993, and through them were introduced to Jim Wirt in 1996, with Wirt going on to produce several Hoobastank recordings. At that time, Hoobastank were unsigned and also playing a funk metal-style of music inspired by bands like Faith No More and Mr. Bungle. By the time Hoobastank signed to Island Records in 2000, they got rid of Wasser and had changed their sound to a more straightforward rock style. The penultimate track &quot;Deep Inside&quot; is another of the lighter songs on the album, drawing heavily from funk music. However, it also has a short heavy metal section beginning roughly 3 minutes into the song. The lyrics reference being high on drugs at 3 A.M. in the morning, and as the song goes on the time progresses to 4 A.M. and eventually 5 A.M. &quot;Deep Inside&quot; stopped being performed live when Alex Katunich left Incubus at the beginning of April 2003, with the last known performance coming during December 2001.

The closing track &quot;Calgone&quot; lyrically revolves around an alien abduction. It ends with a sound clip of the band arguing with DJ Lyfe (who is referred to by his real name of Gavin), for supposedly deleting a track they had been working on in the studio. On physical versions of the album, &quot;Calgone&quot; is followed by a hidden track called &quot;Segue 1&quot;, which plays after 30 seconds of silence. The hidden track is also known as &quot;Jose Loves Kate Moss, Part 1&quot;, and has been treated as a separate track on streaming sites such as Spotify. It begins with a sound recording at a morgue, and the pathologist is describing injuries a patient had sustained during a car crash on May 12, 1997. The hidden track goes on to feature several different sound samples and funk/electronic musical pieces. It samples sounds from the 1985 Sorcerer pinball machine and the song &quot;Show Me Your Titz&quot;, from Hoobastank&#x27;s 1997 demo &quot;Muffins&quot;. It also has an electronic piece in the style of Mozart&#x27;s Toy Symphony, a sound sample of an unknown woman saying &quot;is this the shit, or what?&quot;, and a short skit parodying &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;.

===Title and artwork===
In 1997, Einziger claimed that the title reflected the experimental nature of the album, and the creative freedom the band were given. He was quoted as saying, &quot;our album is called &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; because we were able to experiment. We were able to take our time and get everything to sound the way we wanted it to — weird science and energetic funk.&quot; It has also been mentioned by various band members that the acronym &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; stands for &quot;Sailing Catamarans Is Every Nautical Captain&#x27;s Ecstasy&quot;. &quot;Sometimes, we just sit around and come up with these for laughs. In other words, there&#x27;s not just one meaning, it&#x27;s just food for thought,&quot; said Boyd in 1998. In other early interviews, band members claimed that the title stood for &quot;Stupid Cops Invade Everyone&#x27;s Natural Chaotic Energy&quot;, &quot;Sounds Cool in Eyes Near Communistic Entities&quot; and &quot;Surreal Cats in Economics Never Communicate Estacticly&quot;.

The cover art features a photo of the head of Boyd&#x27;s father, who had earlier appeared on the cover of &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot;. The source of the photos were unknown at the time, and the man on the cover of these releases came to be known as &#x27;Chuck&#x27;. The cover is also the first to include the band&#x27;s current logo, which has been used on every subsequent studio album (with the exception of &quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot; and &quot;Light Grenades&quot;).

==Touring and promotion==
Shortly before the release of &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;, Incubus played a handful of shows with rap rock bands Phunk Junkeez and Shootyz Groove. To support the album, Incubus went on tour with 311 and Sugar Ray between October 1997 and December 1997. At that time, Sugar Ray were experiencing huge success with their single &quot;Fly&quot;, which had been released in mid-1997, and while the tour was happening their album &quot;Floored&quot; was certified platinum for sales of over a million copies. Incubus was the least known act on this tour, and were initially only meant to perform on the first leg of it. However, the crowd response to them was so great that they were asked to stay for the rest of the tour. During late 1997, the album&#x27;s first two singles &quot;A Certain Shade of Green&quot; and &quot;Redefine&quot; were released to radio. That year, a music video for &quot;A Certain Shade of Green&quot; was also made.

In February 1998, DJ Lyfe was fired by the band, and was replaced by DJ Chris Kilmore. The reasoning given for his firing was because of creative and personal differences, and because Incubus could no longer be a &quot;productive family&quot; with him in it. Prior to finding Kilmore, the band were in a state of limbo for a week, since they were unsure whether to add another fifth member or not. Kilmore was originally from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and had moved to Los Angeles, where he was struggling to support himself. He recalled sometimes not having enough money for electricity, telling &quot;Spin&quot; in 2001 that &quot;It was cool, I just used candles at night.&quot; Kilmore was recommended by a friend of the band, and received a phone call on Friday February 13, 1998, where he was asked to audition. The audition took place the next day at the Sound Arena Studios in Reseda, Los Angeles. Kilmore remembered in 2019 that, &quot;we sat around for 45 minutes just talking&quot;, adding &quot;little did I know they were really just trying to get an idea of my personality. So we were talking everything from girls to aliens — all kinds of crazy stuff.&quot; During the last 15 minutes of the audition, Alex Katunich asked Kilmore to showcase his turntable skills. The other members of Incubus were impressed with Kilmore&#x27;s playing and attitude towards life, with Einziger saying at the time, &quot;after letting go of Gavin, I wasn&#x27;t even sure if I wanted to acquire another member into the band, but then we met Chris and my opinion instantly changed.&quot; Following the end of the audition, Kilmore was given a cassette tape with 16 live recordings of &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; and &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; songs, as he had not heard any of the band&#x27;s music at that point. In 2019, he recalled &quot;later that night, they said, &#x27;Can you come rehearse on Sunday?&#x27; I was like, &#x27;No. It’s Valentine&#x27;s Day, and I’m dating a Dominican redhead from Queens. So I cannot miss that.&#x27; So then, they were like, &#x27;Well can you learn all these songs on Monday? Because we have a show on Tuesday.&#x27; I said yeah.&quot;

Later in 1998, the third and final single &quot;New Skin&quot; was released. It had more of a promotional push than their previous two singles, and was their first full-scale marketed attempt at radio play. The cover for the CD release of the single included a group shot of the band, which had Kilmore instead of DJ Lyfe. That year, the new lineup played shows with Far, Limp Bizkit and British band One Minute Silence, in addition to performing at the 1998 edition of Ozzfest, and at the inaugural edition of Korn&#x27;s Family Values Tour. According to Kilmore, the band played a total of 305 shows between the time he joined the band and the end of 1998. Incubus were able to get on Ozzfest 1998 since Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s son Jack liked the band&#x27;s music. He also helped them get on the 2000 edition of Ozzfest, and at the urging of Sharon Osbourne and the Osbourne family, Incubus were chosen as a support act for some of Black Sabbath&#x27;s reunion shows in January 1999. These shows included Pantera as another support act. In 2011, Einziger labelled the Osbournes as a &quot;great family&quot; and &quot;fantastic people&quot; for helping them get on these tours and supporting their music career. Einziger said he developed a friendship with the Osbourne family, and later in 2002 he and Pasillas worked on a song for Kelly Osbourne, the daughter of Ozzy Osbourne. Boyd recalled in 2021 that while touring with Black Sabbath in January 1999, the members of Pantera made fun of Incubus for wearing &quot;baggy jeans&quot;, and at one point came to their dressing room with a platter that had new wrangler jeans and shots of Jack Daniel&#x27;s whiskey. They urged them to try on the jeans and take a shot, with Boyd saying &quot;I think I still have them somewhere and took a shot and almost threw up... never been a big drinker.&quot; Katunich later remembered that they had to play their heaviest songs while on metal-oriented tours such as these, in order to go over well with the crowds. During the touring cycle for &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;, they performed covers of &quot;Powerslave&quot; by Iron Maiden and &quot;I Want You Back&quot; by The Jackson Five. Years later, Michael Jackson&#x27;s daughter Paris Jackson would open for Incubus. Boyd found out that his girlfriend who he had been dating since 1991 was having an affair while he was away on tour for &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;. This event inspired the lyrical themes for Incubus&#x27;s next album &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, which was noted for having a more accessible sound. Writing for &quot;Make Yourself&quot; began in early 1999, after the shows with Black Sabbath and Pantera.

Regarding the change in direction on &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, Kilmore reflected in 2002, &quot;I think what it was when we were touring behind &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; was seeing all these other bands out there who were ripping off bands like Korn and the Deftones and 311, bands that we enjoy and that we love, I think when we realized that and we went into the studio to write &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, we said &#x27;OK, let&#x27;s not do that.&#x27;&quot; Kilmore also recalls that, &quot;during &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E&quot;. our crowd was all teenage kids wearing black and they were all men. Once &#x27;Pardon Me&#x27; started getting some traction the crowd turned into half-girl crowds. Then when &#x27;Stellar&#x27; and &#x27;Drive&#x27; came out, those half-girl crowds became all screaming teenage girls in the front row.&quot; Einziger stated, &quot;It was a very masculine time in music and we were associated with that. We would be playing Ozzfest tours with all these different bands who were our good friends and there was pressure to be like that. I think the tenderness and emotional side of the [later] music was a reaction to all that aggressive music that was happening at that time. Our reaction was to go in the other direction.&quot; According to Boyd in 2019 it &quot;felt a little strange to be associated with some of the bands around that time who were very 
deeply misogynistic in their content and vibrationally kind of violent.&quot;

==Release and reception==
===Commercial response===
In early 1999, &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; and &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; were estimated to have sold a combined total of 200,000 units, with &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; having sold around 150,000 copies at the beginning of 2000. Following their commercial breakthrough on &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, sales for &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; began to increase. By 2001, it had sold 370,000 units in the United States. Epic/Immortal released a remastered version of the album during November 2001, and in the next year sales rose to 500,000. The remastering for the 2001 reissue was done at Marcussen Mastering, and it came as an enhanced CD that included the music video for &quot;A Certain Shade of Green&quot;. Einziger said in 2011 that &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; had sold nearly a million copies in the United States, and over a million when combined with international sales.

===Critical response===
Critics wrote favorably of the album&#x27;s diverse style. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave it an 8.7 out of 10, stating &quot;this CD successfully combines all sorts of shit without sounding like a mess. Here you have a song: it&#x27;s got a phat-chunk bass beat twanging fast in back, some crazy electro squornks and bleeps coming and going, sudden snatches of full-blown guitar-jam, a rapid-fire Patton-esque vocalist (Brandon Boyd), all the while someone scratching vinyl and a drummer back there hammering merrily along.&quot; AllMusic reviewer David Thomas wrote that the band &quot;manages to make their songs upbeat and danceable as well as tunes to headbang to. An admirable feat in a genre that tends to reward decibel levels instead of quality.&quot;

On April 11, 1998, Darren Kerr of the Vancouver publication &quot;Drop D&quot; praised the album&#x27;s incorporation of turntablism and trip hop. Kerr also noted similarities between Faith No More, who would announce their breakup just nine days later, writing &quot;I would not dispute that Brandon of the Jungle&#x27;s evil-lounge-singer-morphing-into-teeth-gnashing-maniac vocal style is emulative of Mike Patton. I also would not argue that a couple of these songs would not sound out of place alongside FNM tracks like &#x27;Caffeine&#x27; or &#x27;The Gentle Art of Making Enemies&#x27;. However, guitarist Michael Einzinger and bassist Alex Katunich are mining a groove vein uniquely their own.&quot; &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; wrote in their September 1997 review that, &quot;you&#x27;ve heard this kind of hip hop/metal fusion from bands like Faith No More, Living Colour, Rage Against the Machine and Biohazard, but Incubus has got a bit more funk in its trunk than any of those artists.&quot; They noted the album &quot;distinguishes itself from run-of-the-mill surf/skate metal by including a real live DJ (DJ Lyfe) who thrashes as hard on the turntable as the rest of the guys.&quot; The review goes on to state that the band manages to create &quot;monstrous riffs&quot;, saying &quot;&quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;&#x27;s most memorable songs are the ones in which Incubus proudly bares its metal muscles.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; in 1998 pointed out not only the band&#x27;s usage of turntables, but also their usage of the didgeridoo and djembe instruments. In his August 1998 review, Jason Hradil of &quot;The Lantern&quot; wrote that Boyd has &quot;an intense voice similar to Faith No More&#x27;s Mike Patton.&quot; He further wrote, &quot;Incubus changes tempo and style at least two to three times per song&quot; and &quot;one thing I&#x27;ll guarantee, is that these young men will bring home their report cards with an &#x27;A&#x27; in science.&quot; In an October 1997 article focusing on an Incubus concert with 311 and Sugar Ray, Dan Nailen of the &quot;Moscow-Pullman Daily News&quot; had a positive view of the band&#x27;s music. He wrote, &quot;combining super-phat beats, rap-style turntable-scratching and crunchy heavy-metal guitar riffs, Incubus is nothing if not unique. Add to the musical mix the pilable vocals of frontman Brandon Boyd, reminiscent of Faith No More&#x27;s Mike Patton, and you have music as interesting as Sugar Ray&#x27;s is lame.&quot; Matt Peiken of &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine awarded it three and a half out of five stars in March 1998. He praised the band&#x27;s technical ability but noted a lack of focus on the album, saying &quot;Incubus plays with listeners&#x27; minds in Faith No More-ish fashion [and] at times it&#x27;s hard to tell whether the band is attempting to dish out some serious music or simply kicking out kitsch.&quot;

===Legacy===
Dylan P. Gadino of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; reflected in November 2001 that Incubus &quot;dropped their major-label debut, &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;, the same year as some nix-metal founders — 1997 also saw the releases of Limp Bizkit&#x27;s &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; and Sevendust&#x27;s eponymous disc — yet Incubus&#x27;s music [was] generally more inspired and layered than the efforts of their brooding counterparts.&quot; In November 2001, Amy Sciarretto of sister publication &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; further wrote, &quot;Incubus was poised to be hard rock&#x27;s bastard child of Faith No More and Primus thanks to its resident hottie Brandon Boyd&#x27;s easy-on-the-ears emulation of Mike Patton and Dirk Lance&#x27;s bass thwapping. But between 1997&#x27;s &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; and 1999&#x27;s &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, the album that broke Incubus at rock radio, the band took a stylistic turn.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented in 2002 that &quot;they broke through to the Ozzfest crowd with 1997&#x27;s eclectic funk-metal album, &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;.&quot; The 2003 book &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; claimed that it was &quot;better and far more accomplished&quot; than their previous releases &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; and &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot;. The book additionally states that it &quot;gave the band a much smoother, groove-oriented sound. Splashes of funk were offset with driving riffage and spiky turntable shrapnel, while Boyd&#x27;s lyrics began to encompass a more intellectual world-view than your average rock star.&quot;

In 2004, David Clayman of IGN called it &quot;fairly impressive, considering the band&#x27;s age and experience at the time of those recordings.&quot; That same year, Nick Romanow of the &quot;Daily Collegian&quot; reflected that with &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;, Incubus &quot;had the potential to become the next Faith No More&quot;, noting that &quot;the comparison was even heightened by charismatic frontman Brandon Boyd’s vocal similarities to Mike Patton, Faith No More’s innovative singer.&quot; He also said that by &quot;Morning View&quot; they had &quot;abandoned their will to be as innovative as Faith No More&quot;. &quot;Vice&quot; in 2013 considered it to be their heaviest release, as well as &quot;what a more elastic and bold Red Hot Chili Peppers could be like.&quot; &quot;Loudwire&quot; praised it in 2019, saying &quot;before their music almost entirely mellowed out, Incubus were a high energy genre-bending band of misfits. The sophomore effort fused metal, hip-hop, trip-hop, funk, jazz and even a little bit of house music.&quot; On the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2017, &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that it mixes &quot;cartoonish slap bass with bongwater-soaked guitar distortion [and] dubby drum-n-bass with samples from children’s audiobooks.&quot; They added, &quot;you’d almost expect it to have died in a psychedelics-related car accident before it reached the distinguished age of 20.&quot;

Geddy Lee of Canadian rock band Rush was a fan of the album, and at one point expressed interest in collaborating with Incubus. Tosin Abasi, guitarist of progressive metal band Animals as Leaders, has mentioned being influenced by it, with his band later touring with Incubus in 2022. The band&#x27;s greatest hits releases &quot;The Essential Incubus&quot; (2012) and &quot;Playlist: The Very Best of Incubus&quot; (2013) both include songs from the album, while their initial greatest hits release &quot;Monuments and Melodies&quot; (2009) only included an acoustic version of &quot;A Certain Shade of Green&quot;, which was not recorded during the &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; era. In 2003, the song &quot;Vitamin&quot; was also featured in the horror film &quot;Final Destination 2&quot;.

===Accolades===
VH1 ranked the album tenth on their 2015 list of &quot;The 12 Most Underrated Nu Metal Albums&quot;, while &quot;Revolver&quot; included it on a 2021 list of the &quot;20 Essential Nu-Metal Albums&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; listed it as being one of the best metal albums released between 1996 and 1997, and also included it in their lists of the top 10 albums of 1997 and the top 20 best metal albums of 1997. When ranking Incubus&#x27;s discography in 2020, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; placed &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; third, remarking, &quot;for fans of the band’s heavier, zanier leanings, this remains the high bar against which Incubus releases are now measured. Given the subsequent departures from this template, however, it’s likely those early adopters have been left disappointed. You could therefore argue that &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; is something of a creative albatross around the band’s neck.&quot; In 2024, Ultimate Guitar included it on a list titled &quot;10 Classic Albums That Defined the &#x27;90s Alternative Metal Scene&quot;.

==Live performance==
Incubus did not often perform songs from &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; between the late 2000s and early 2010s, with Boyd telling &quot;Spin&quot; in 2017, &quot;there was a period of years when we were knowingly rebelling against it, we were desperately trying to shake off the identity it had created around us. Our original fans would get mad, &#x27;Why don’t you play more stuff from &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;?&#x27; I think it only happened two or three years ago, when we were touring again, and started to revisit the songs casually in rehearsal studios and sound checks. We started to fall in love with them again. I think we just needed a friend break.&quot; He also said there are &quot;tracks that are just kind of ridiculous, that we don’t really fuck with. One day we might.&quot;

<text>Itzhak Perlman (; born August 31, 1945) is an Israeli-American violinist. He has performed worldwide and throughout the United States, in venues that have included a state dinner for Elizabeth II at the White House in 2007, and at the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama. He has conducted the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Westchester Philharmonic. In 2015, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Perlman has won 16 Grammy Awards, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and four Emmy Awards.

==Early life==
Perlman was born in 1945 in Tel Aviv. His parents, Chaim and Shoshana Perlman, were Jewish natives of Poland and had independently emigrated to Mandatory Palestine in the mid-1930s before they met and later married. Perlman contracted polio at age four and has walked using leg braces and crutches since then and plays the violin while seated. , he uses crutches or an electric scooter for mobility.

When Perlman was three years old, he sat and listened attentively to a violin recital on the radio, which inspired him to become a violinist. His mother soon bought him a toy violin, and he quickly taught himself to play melodies. His parents tried to enroll him at the Shulamit Conservatory, but he was denied admission for being too small to hold a violin. Despite his handicap, he began learning the violin a year later. His first teacher was a café violinist. At age five, Perlman was admitted to the Academy of Music in Tel Aviv (now the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music), where he studied for eight years with Rivka Goldgart, a violin teacher of Russian origin, and gave his first recital at age ten. He moved to the United States at age 13 to study at the Juilliard School and Meadowmount School of Music with the violin teacher Ivan Galamian and his assistant Dorothy DeLay.

==Career==

===Performing===

Perlman gained national attention when he appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; twice in 1958, and again in 1964, on the same show with the Rolling Stones. His performances on the show included pieces such as Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot;, Wieniawski&#x27;s &quot;Polonaise Brillante&quot;, and Mendelssohn&#x27;s violin concerto. In 1963 and 1964, Perlman made appearances with the National Orchestra Association in Wieniawski&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1, the New York Youth Orchestra in Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto, and with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.

With the Zionist Organization of America&#x27;s sponsorship, Perlman began touring cities in the U.S. and Canada as a soloist, and quickly established himself as a leading virtuoso. He made his Carnegie Hall debut performing Wieniawski&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1 in 1963 and won the Leventritt Competition in 1964. From 1964 to 1966, Perlman embarked on his first notable concert tour in the United States, performed in 30 cities, including Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Denver, Honolulu, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New Haven, Seattle, and St. Louis. Perlman returned twice to the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. During the later part of 1964, Perlman gave several concerts in Israel, a tour that concluded with the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto at the Mann Auditorium in Tel Aviv.

Perlman first appeared with the New York Philharmonic at the Philharmonic Hall as a soloist on May 9, 1965, playing Bruch&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1 under William Steinberg. He debuted with the Los Angeles Philharmonic with the same concerto on February 17, 1966. In 1965, Perlman debuted with the Cleveland Orchestra at Severance Hall in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Violin Concert under Louis Lane. He debuted with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Ravinia Festival on August 4, 1966, in Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto with conductor Thomas Schippers. Perlman made his debut with the Boston Symphony Orchestra on December 16, 1966, playing Prokofiev&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 2 under Erich Leinsdorf.

Starting in the late 1960s, Perlman began to tour Europe. He debuted with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1968, performing Tchaikovky&#x27;s violin concerto under the direction of André Previn. On May 25, 1972, Perlman debuted with the Berlin Philharmonic with the same concerto. This was shortly followed by his debut at the Salzburg Festival with a solo performance of Schubert&#x27;s Rondo and Fantasy for Violin and Piano and Brahms&#x27;s Violin Sonata No. 3 with Joseph Kalichstein on August 19, 1972. The next day, Perlman performed Mozart&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 4 with the Vienna Philharmonic under Claudio Abbado. In the following years, Perlman toured as a soloist worldwide.

In addition to an extensive recording and performance career, Perlman has continued to make appearances on television shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot; as well as playing at a number of White House functions.

Although Perlman has never been billed or marketed as a singer, he sang the role of &quot;Un carceriere&quot; (&quot;a jailer&quot;) on a 1981 EMI recording of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; that featured Renata Scotto, Plácido Domingo, and Renato Bruson, with James Levine conducting. He had earlier sung the role in an excerpt from the opera on a 1980 Pension Fund Benefit Concert telecast as part of the Live from Lincoln Center series with Luciano Pavarotti as Cavaradossi and Zubin Mehta conducting the New York Philharmonic.

On July 5, 1986, Perlman performed at the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s tribute to the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty, which was televised live on ABC. The orchestra, conducted by Mehta, performed in Central Park.

In 1987, Perlman joined the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (IPO) for its concerts in Warsaw and Budapest as well as other cities in Eastern bloc countries. He toured with the IPO in the spring of 1990 for its first-ever performance in the Soviet Union, with concerts in Moscow and Leningrad, and again in 1994, performing in China and India.

In 2015, on a classical music program titled &quot;The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center&quot; produced by WQXR in New York City, it was revealed that Perlman performed the uncredited violin solo on the 1989 Billy Joel song &quot;The Downeaster Alexa&quot;.

While primarily a solo artist, Perlman has performed with a number of other musicians, including Yo-Yo Ma, Pinchas Zukerman, Jessye Norman, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Isaac Stern, and Yuri Temirkanov at the 150th anniversary celebration of Tchaikovsky in Leningrad in December 1990.

As well as playing and recording the classical music for which he is best known, Perlman has also played jazz, including an album made with jazz pianist Oscar Peterson; klezmer; and bluegrass music. He has been a soloist in a number of film scores, such as the theme of the 1993 film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; by John Williams, which won an Academy Award for Best Original Score. More recently, he was the violin soloist in the 2005 film &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; along with cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Perlman played selections from the musical scores of the movies nominated for &quot;Best Original Score&quot; at the 73rd Academy Awards with Ma and at the 78th Academy Awards.

===Selected performances===

Perlman played at the state dinner attended by Queen Elizabeth II on May 7, 2007, in the East Room at the White House.

He performed John Williams&#x27;s &quot;Air and Simple Gifts&quot; at the 2009 inauguration ceremony for Barack Obama along with Yo-Yo Ma (cello), Gabriela Montero (piano), and Anthony McGill (clarinet). The quartet played live, but the music played simultaneously over speakers and on television was a recording made two days earlier due to concerns that the cold weather could damage the instruments. Perlman was quoted as saying: &quot;It would have been a disaster if we had done it any other way.&quot;

He made an appearance in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; to introduce the segment &quot;Pines of Rome&quot;, along with Steve Martin.

On November 2, 2018, Perlman reprised the 60th anniversary of his first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; as a guest on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;.

==Teaching==
In 1975, Perlman accepted a faculty post at the Conservatory of Music at Brooklyn College. In 2003, he was named the Dorothy Richard Starling Foundation Chair in Violin Studies at the Juilliard School, succeeding his teacher, Dorothy DeLay. He also teaches students one-on-one at the Perlman Music Program on Long Island, NY, rarely holding master classes.

===The Perlman Music Program===
The Perlman Music Program, founded in 1994 by Perlman&#x27;s wife, Toby Perlman, and Suki Sandler, started as a summer camp for exceptional string musicians between the ages of 12 and 18. Over time, it expanded to a yearlong program. Students have the chance to have Perlman coach them before they play at venues such as the Sutton Place Synagogue and public schools. By introducing students to each other and requiring them to practice together, the program strives to have musicians who would otherwise practice alone develop a network of friends and colleagues. Rather than remain isolated, participants in the program find an area where they belong.

===Conducting===
At the beginning of the new millennium, Perlman began to conduct. He took the post of principal guest conductor at the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. He served as music advisor to the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra from 2002 to 2004. In November 2007, the Westchester Philharmonic announced his appointment as artistic director and principal conductor. His first concert in these roles was on October 11, 2008, in an all-Beethoven program featuring pianist Leon Fleisher performing the Emperor Concerto.

==Instruments==
Perlman plays the &quot;Soil Stradivarius&quot; violin of 1714, formerly owned by Yehudi Menuhin and considered one of the finest violins made during Stradivari&#x27;s &quot;golden period.&quot; Perlman also plays the Guarneri del Gesù 1743 &#x27;Sauret&#x27; and the Carlo Bergonzi 1740 &#x27;ex-Kreisler&#x27;.

==Personal life==
Perlman lives in New York City with his wife, Toby, also a classically trained violinist. They have five children, including Navah Perlman, a concert pianist and chamber musician. Perlman is a distant cousin of the Canadian comic and television personality Howie Mandel. He has synesthesia and was interviewed for &quot;Tasting the Universe&quot; by Maureen Seaberg, which is about the condition.
