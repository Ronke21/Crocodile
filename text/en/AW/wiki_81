<text>In linguistics, romanization is the conversion of text from a different writing system to the Roman (Latin) script, or a system for doing so. Methods of romanization include transliteration, for representing written text, and transcription, for representing the spoken word, and combinations of both. Transcription methods can be subdivided into &quot;phonemic transcription&quot;, which records the phonemes or units of semantic meaning in speech, and more strict &quot;phonetic transcription&quot;, which records speech sounds with precision.

==Methods==
There are many consistent or standardized romanization systems. They can be classified by their characteristics. A particular system&#x27;s characteristics may make it better-suited for various, sometimes contradictory applications, including document retrieval, linguistic analysis, easy readability, faithful representation of pronunciation.
* Source, or donor language – A system may be tailored to romanize text from a particular language, or a series of languages, or for any language in a particular writing system. A language-specific system typically preserves language features like pronunciation, while the general one may be better for cataloguing international texts.
* Target, or receiver language – Most systems are intended for an audience that speaks or reads a particular language. (So-called &quot;international&quot; romanization systems for Cyrillic text are based on central-European alphabets like the Czech and Croatian alphabet.)
* Simplicity – Since the basic Latin alphabet has a smaller number of letters than many other writing systems, digraphs, diacritics, or special characters must be used to represent them all in Latin script. This affects the ease of creation, digital storage and transmission, reproduction, and reading of the romanized text.
* Reversibility – Whether or not the original can be restored from the converted text. Some reversible systems allow for an irreversible simplified version.

===Transliteration===

If the romanization attempts to transliterate the original script, the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of characters in the source language into the target script, with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader&#x27;s language. For example, the Nihon-shiki romanization of Japanese allows the informed reader to reconstruct the original Japanese kana syllables with 100% accuracy, but requires additional knowledge for correct pronunciation.

===Transcription===
====Phonemic====

Most romanizations are intended to enable the casual reader who is unfamiliar with the original script to pronounce the source language reasonably accurately. Such romanizations follow the principle of phonemic transcription and attempt to render the significant sounds (phonemes) of the original as faithfully as possible in the target language. The popular Hepburn Romanization of Japanese is an example of a transcriptive romanization designed for English speakers.

====Phonetic====

A phonetic conversion goes one step further and attempts to depict all phones in the source language, sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions not found in the target script. In practice such a representation almost never tries to represent &quot;every&quot; possible allophone—especially those that occur naturally due to coarticulation effects—and instead limits itself to the most significant allophonic distinctions. The International Phonetic Alphabet is the most common system of phonetic transcription.

===Compromise===
For most language pairs, building a usable romanization involves a trade-off between the two extremes. Pure transcriptions are generally not possible, as the source language usually contains sounds and distinctions not found in the target language, but which must be shown for the romanized form to be comprehensible. Furthermore, due to and variance no written language represents any spoken language with perfect accuracy and the vocal interpretation of a script may vary by a great degree among languages. In modern times the chain of transcription is usually spoken foreign language, written foreign language, written native language, spoken (read) native language. Reducing the number of those processes, i.e. removing one or both steps of writing, usually leads to more accurate oral articulations. In general, outside a limited audience of scholars, romanizations tend to lean more towards transcription. As an example, consider the Japanese martial art 柔術: the Nihon-shiki romanization &quot;zyûzyutu&quot; may allow someone who knows Japanese to reconstruct the kana syllables , but most native English speakers, or rather readers, would find it easier to guess the pronunciation from the Hepburn version, &quot;jūjutsu&quot;.

==Romanization of specific writing systems==

===Arabic===
The Arabic script is used to write Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Pashto and Sindhi as well as numerous other languages in the Muslim world, particularly African and Asian languages without alphabets of their own. Romanization standards include the following:

====Arabic====
* (1936): Adopted by the International Convention of Orientalist Scholars in Rome. It is the basis for the very influential Hans Wehr dictionary ().
* BS 4280 (1968): Developed by the British Standards Institution
* SATTS (1970s): A one-for-one substitution system, a legacy from the Morse code era
* UNGEGN (1972)
* DIN 31635 (1982): Developed by the (German Institute for Standardization)
* ISO 233 (1984). Transliteration.
* Qalam (1985): A system that focuses upon preserving the spelling, rather than the pronunciation, and uses mixed case
* ISO 233-2 (1993): Simplified transliteration.
* Buckwalter transliteration (1990s): Developed at Xerox by Tim Buckwalter; does not require unusual diacritics
* ALA-LC (1997)
* Arabic chat alphabet

====Persian====



Notes:
===Armenian===

===Georgian===


Notes:
===Greek===

There are romanization systems for both Modern and Ancient Greek.
* ALA-LC
* Beta Code
* Greeklish
* ISO 843 (1997)

===Hebrew===

The Hebrew alphabet is romanized using several standards:
* ANSI Z39.25 (1975)
* UNGEGN (1977)
* ISO 259 (1984): Transliteration.
* ISO 259-2 (1994): Simplified transliteration.
* ISO/DIS 259-3: Phonemic transcription.
* ALA-LC

===Indic (Brahmic) scripts===
The Brahmic family of abugidas is used for languages of the Indian subcontinent and south-east Asia. There is a long tradition in the west to study Sanskrit and other Indic texts in Latin transliteration. Various transliteration conventions have been used for Indic scripts since the time of Sir William Jones.
* ISO 15919 (2001): A standard transliteration convention was codified in the ISO 15919 standard. It uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brahmic consonants and vowels to the Latin script. The Devanagari-specific portion is very similar to the academic standard, IAST: &quot;International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration&quot;, and to the United States Library of Congress standard, ALA-LC, although there are a few differences
* The National Library at Kolkata romanization, intended for the romanization of all Indic scripts, is an extension of IAST
* Harvard-Kyoto: Uses upper and lower case and doubling of letters, to avoid the use of diacritics, and to restrict the range to 7-bit ASCII.
* ITRANS: a transliteration scheme into 7-bit ASCII created by Avinash Chopde that used to be prevalent on Usenet.
* ISCII (1988)

==== Devanagari–nastaʿlīq (Hindustani) ====
Hindustani is an Indo-Aryan language with extreme digraphia and diglossia resulting from the Hindi–Urdu controversy starting in the 1800s. Technically, Hindustani itself is recognized by neither the language community nor any governments. Two standardized registers, Standard Hindi and Standard Urdu, are recognized as official languages in India and Pakistan. However, in practice the situation is,
* In Pakistan: Standard (Saaf or Khaalis) Urdu is the &quot;high&quot; variety, whereas Hindustani is the &quot;low&quot; variety used by the masses (called Urdu, written in nastaʿlīq script).
* In India, both Standard (Shuddh) Hindi and Standard (Saaf or Khaalis) Urdu are the &quot;H&quot; varieties (written in devanagari and nastaʿlīq respectively), whereas Hindustani is the &quot;L&quot; variety used by the masses and written in either devanagari or nastaʿlīq (and called &#x27;Hindi&#x27; or &#x27;Urdu&#x27; respectively).

The digraphia renders any work in either script largely inaccessible to users of the other script, though otherwise Hindustani is a perfectly mutually intelligible language, essentially meaning that any kind of text-based open source collaboration is impossible among devanagari and nastaʿlīq readers.

Initiated in 2011, the Hamari Boli Initiative is a full-scale open-source language planning initiative aimed at Hindustani script, style, status &amp; lexical reform and modernization. One of primary stated objectives of Hamari Boli is to relieve Hindustani of the crippling devanagari–nastaʿlīq digraphia by way of romanization.

===Chinese===
Romanization of the Sinitic languages, particularly Mandarin, has proved a very difficult problem, although the issue is further complicated by political considerations. Because of this, many romanization tables contain Chinese characters plus one or more romanizations or Zhuyin.

====Mandarin====
* ALA-LC: Used to be similar to Wade–Giles, but converted to Hanyu Pinyin in 2000
* EFEO. Developed by École française d&#x27;Extrême-Orient in the 19th century, used mainly in France.
* Latinxua Sin Wenz (1926): Omitted tone sounds. Used mainly in the Soviet Union and Xinjiang in the 1930s. Predecessor of Hanyu Pinyin.
* Lessing-Othmer: Used mainly in Germany.
* Postal romanization (1906): Early standard for international addresses
* Wade–Giles (1892): Transliteration. Very popular from the 19th century until recently and continues to be used by some Western academics.
* Yale (1942): Created by the U.S. for battlefield communication and used in the influential Yale textbooks.
* Legge romanization: Created by James Legge, a Scottish missionary.

=====Mainland China=====
* Hanyu Pinyin (1958): In mainland China, Hanyu Pinyin has been used officially to romanize Mandarin for decades, primarily as a linguistic tool for teaching the standardized language. The system is also used in other Chinese-speaking areas such as Singapore and parts of Taiwan, and has been adopted by much of the international community as a standard for writing Chinese words and names in the Latin script. The value of Hanyu Pinyin in education in China lies in the fact that China, like any other populated area with comparable area and population, has numerous distinct dialects, though there is just one common written language and one common standardized spoken form. (These comments apply to romanization in general)
* ISO 7098 (1991): Based on Hanyu Pinyin.

=====Taiwan=====
# Gwoyeu Romatzyh (GR, 1928–1986, in Taiwan 1945–1986; Taiwan used Japanese Romaji before 1945),
# Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II (MPS II, 1986–2002),
# Tongyong Pinyin (2002–2008), and
# Hanyu Pinyin (since January 1, 2009).

=====Singapore=====
====Cantonese====
* Barnett–Chao
* Guangdong (1960)
* Hong Kong Government
* Jyutping
* Macau Government
* Meyer–Wempe
* Sidney Lau
* Yale (1942)
* ILE romanization of Cantonese

====Wu====
====Min Nan or Hokkien====
* Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ), once the &quot;de facto&quot; official script of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (since the late 19th century). Technically this represented a largely phonemic transcription system, as Min Nan was not commonly written in Chinese.
* Tâi-uân Lô-má-jī Phing-im Hong-àn

=====Teochew=====
* Guangdong (1960), for the distinct Teochew variety.

====Min Dong====
* Foochow Romanized

====Min Bei====
* Kienning Colloquial Romanized

===Japanese===

Romanization (or, more generally, Roman letters) is called &quot;rōmaji&quot; in Japanese. The most common systems are:
* Hepburn (1867): phonetic transcription to Anglo-American practices, used in geographical names
* Nihon-shiki (1885): transliteration. Also adopted as (ISO 3602 Strict) in 1989.
* Kunrei-shiki (1937): phonemic transcription. Also adopted as (ISO 3602).
* JSL (1987): phonemic transcription. Named after the book &quot;Japanese: The Spoken Language&quot; by Eleanor Jorden.
* ALA-LC: Similar to Modified Hepburn
* Wāpuro: (&quot;word processor romanization&quot;) transliteration. Not strictly a system, but a collection of common practices that enables input of Japanese text.

===Korean===
While romanization has taken various and at times seemingly unstructured forms, some sets of rules do exist:
* McCune–Reischauer (MR; 1937?), the first transcription to gain some acceptance. A slightly changed version of MR was the official system for Korean in South Korea from 1984 to 2000, and yet a different modification is still the official system in North Korea. Uses breves, apostrophes and diereses, the latter two indicating orthographic syllable boundaries in cases that would otherwise be ambiguous.What is called MR may in many cases be any of a number of systems that differ from each other and from the original MR mostly in whether word endings are separated from the stem by a space, a hyphen or – according to McCune&#x27;s and Reischauer&#x27;s system – not at all; and if a hyphen or space is used, whether sound change is reflected in a stem&#x27;s last and an ending&#x27;s first consonant letter (e.g. &quot;pur-i&quot; vs. &quot;pul-i&quot;). Although mostly irrelevant when transcribing uninflected words, these aberrations are so widespread that any mention of &quot;McCune-Reischauer romanization&quot; may not necessarily refer to the original system as published in the 1930s.
** There is, for example, the ALA-LC / U.S. Library of Congress system, based on MR but with some deviations. Word division is addressed in detail, with a generous use of spaces to separate word endings from stems that is not seen in MR. Syllables of given names are always separated with a hyphen, which is expressly never done by MR. Sound changes are ignored more often than in MR. Distinguishes between ‘ and ’.

Several problems with MR led to the development of the newer systems:
* Yale (1942): This system has become the established standard romanization for Korean among linguists. Vowel length in old or dialectal pronunciation is indicated by a macron. In cases that would otherwise be ambiguous, orthographic syllable boundaries are indicated with a period. This system also indicates consonants that have disappeared from a word&#x27;s South Korean orthography and standard pronunciation.
* Revised Romanization of Korean (RR; 2000): Includes rules both for transcription and for transliteration. South Korea now officially uses this system that was approved in 2000. Road signs and textbooks were required to follow these rules as soon as possible, at a cost estimated by the government to be at least US$20 million. All road signs, names of railway and subway stations on line maps and signs etc. have been changed. The change has been either ignored or grandfathered in some cases, notably the romanization of names and existing companies. RR is generally similar to MR, but uses no diacritics or apostrophes, and uses distinct letters for ㅌ/ㄷ (t/d), ㅋ/ㄱ (k/g), ㅊ/ㅈ (ch/j) and ㅍ/ㅂ (p/b). In cases of ambiguity, orthographic syllable boundaries were intended to be indicated with a hyphen, but this is inconsistently applied in practice.
* ISO/TR 11941 (1996): This actually is two different standards under one name: one for North Korea (DPRK) and the other for South Korea (ROK). The initial submission to the ISO was based heavily on Yale and was a joint effort between both states, but they could not agree on the final draft.
* Lukoff romanization, developed 1945–47 for his &quot;Spoken Korean&quot; coursebooks

===Thai===

Thai, spoken in Thailand and some areas of Laos, Burma and China, is written with its own script, probably descended from mixture of Tai–Laotian and Old Khmer, in the Brahmic family.
* Royal Thai General System of Transcription
* ISO 11940 1998 Transliteration
* ISO 11940-2 2007 Transcription
* ALA-LC

===Nuosu===

The Nuosu language, spoken in southern China, is written with its own script, the Yi script. The only existing romanisation system is YYPY (Yi Yu Pin Yin), which represents tone with letters attached to the end of syllables, as Nuosu forbids codas. It does not use diacritics, and as such due to the large phonemic inventory of Nuosu, it requires frequent use of digraphs, including for monophthong vowels.

===Tibetan===
The Tibetan script has two official romanization systems: Tibetan Pinyin (for Lhasa Tibetan) and Roman Dzongkha (for Dzongkha).

===Cyrillic===
In English language library catalogues, bibliographies, and most academic publications, the Library of Congress transliteration method is used worldwide.

In linguistics, scientific transliteration is used for both Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets. This applies to Old Church Slavonic, as well as modern Slavic languages that use these alphabets.

====Belarusian====
* BGN/PCGN romanization of Belarusian, 1979 (United States Board on Geographic Names and Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use)
* Scientific transliteration, or the &quot;International Scholarly System&quot; for linguistics
* ALA-LC romanization, 1997 (American Library Association and Library of Congress):
* ISO 9:1995
* &quot;Instruction on transliteration of Belarusian geographical names with letters of Latin script&quot;, 2000

====Bulgarian====
A system based on scientific transliteration and ISO/R 9:1968 was considered official in Bulgaria since the 1970s. Since the late 1990s, Bulgarian authorities have switched to the so-called Streamlined System avoiding the use of diacritics and optimized for compatibility with English. This system became mandatory for public use with a law passed in 2009. Where the old system uses &lt;č,š,ž,št,c,j,ă&gt;, the new system uses &lt;ch,sh,zh,sht,ts,y,a&gt;.

The new Bulgarian system was endorsed for official use also by UN in 2012, and by BGN and PCGN in 2013.

====Kyrgyz====

====Macedonian====

====Russian====
There is no single universally accepted system of writing Russian using the Latin script—in fact there are a huge number of such systems: some are adjusted for a particular target language (e.g. German or French), some are designed as a librarian&#x27;s transliteration, some are prescribed for Russian travellers&#x27; passports; the transcription of some names is purely traditional.   All this has resulted in great reduplication of names.   E.g. the name of the Russian composer Tchaikovsky may also be written as &quot;Tchaykovsky&quot;, &quot;Tchajkovskij&quot;, &quot;Tchaikowski&quot;, &quot;Tschaikowski&quot;, &quot;Czajkowski&quot;, &quot;Čajkovskij&quot;, &quot;Čajkovski&quot;, &quot;Chajkovskij&quot;, &quot;Çaykovski&quot;, &quot;Chaykovsky&quot;, &quot;Chaykovskiy&quot;, &quot;Chaikovski&quot;, &quot;Tshaikovski&quot;, &quot;Tšaikovski&quot;, &quot;Tsjajkovskij&quot; etc. Systems include:
* BGN/PCGN (1947): Transliteration system (United States Board on Geographic Names &amp; Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use).
* GOST 16876-71 (1971): A now defunct Soviet transliteration standard. Replaced by GOST 7.79, which is an ISO 9 equivalent.
* United Nations romanization system for geographical names (1987): Based on GOST 16876-71.
* ISO 9 (1995): Transliteration. From the International Organization for Standardization.
* ALA-LC (1997)
* &quot;Volapuk&quot; encoding (1990s): Slang term (it is not really Volapük) for a writing method that is not truly a transliteration, but used for similar goals (see article).
* Conventional English transliteration is based to BGN/PCGN, but does not follow a particular standard. Described in detail at Romanization of Russian.
* Streamlined System for the romanization of Russian.
* Comparative transliteration of Russian in different languages (Western European, Arabic, Georgian, Braille, Morse)

====Syriac====

The Latin script for Syriac was developed in the 1930s, following the state policy for minority languages of the Soviet Union, with some material published.

====Ukrainian====
The 2010 Ukrainian National system has been adopted by the UNGEGN in 2012 and by the BGN/PCGN in 2020. It is also very close to the modified (simplified) ALA-LC system, which has remained unchanged since 1941.
* ALA-LC
* ISO 9
* Ukrainian National transliteration
* Ukrainian National and BGN/PCGN systems, at the UN Working Group on Romanization Systems
* Thomas T. Pedersen&#x27;s comparison of five systems

Lear received many awards, including six Primetime Emmy Awards, two Peabody Awards, the National Medal of Arts in 1999, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2017, and the Golden Globe Carol Burnett Award in 2021. He was a member of the Television Academy Hall of Fame.

Lear was known for his political activism and funding of liberal and progressive causes and politicians. In 1980, he founded the advocacy organization People for the American Way to counter the influence of the Christian right in politics, and in the early 2000s, he mounted a tour with a copy of the Declaration of Independence.

==Early life and education==
Norman Milton Lear was born on July 27, 1922, in New Haven, Connecticut, to Jeanette (&quot;née&quot; Seicol) and Hyman &quot;Herman&quot; Lear, a traveling salesman. He had a younger sister, Claire Lear Brown (1925–2015). Lear grew up in a Jewish household in Connecticut and had a bar mitzvah ceremony. Both parents were of Russian-Jewish descent.

When Lear was nine years old and living with his family in Chelsea, Massachusetts, his father went to prison for selling fake bonds. Lear thought of his father as a &quot;rascal&quot; and said that the character of Archie Bunker (whom Lear depicted as white Protestant on the show) was in part inspired by his father, and the character of Edith Bunker was in part inspired by his mother. However, Lear has said the moment which inspired his lifetime of advocacy was another event which he experienced at the age of nine, when he first heard antisemitic Catholic radio priest Father Charles Coughlin while tinkering with his crystal radio set. After hearing more of Coughlin&#x27;s radio sermons, Lear said he found Coughlin would promote antisemitism by targeting people whom Jews considered to be &quot;great heroes&quot;, such as US President Franklin Roosevelt.

Lear attended Samuel J. Tilden High School in Brooklyn, New York, graduated from Weaver High School in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1940 and attended Emerson College in Boston, but dropped out in 1942 to join the United States Army Air Forces.

==Military career==
Lear enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in September 1942. He served in the Mediterranean theater as a radio operator and gunner on Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers with the 772nd Bomb Squadron, 463rd Bomb Group of the Fifteenth Air Force; in a 2014 interview, he talked about bombing Germany. He flew 52 combat missions and received the Air Medal with four oak leaf clusters. Lear was discharged from the Army Air Forces in 1945. His World War II crew members are featured in the book &quot;Crew Umbriago&quot; by Daniel P. Carroll.

==Career==
===1950–1959===
After World War II Lear had a career in public relations. The career choice was inspired by his Uncle Jack: &quot;My dad had a brother, Jack, who flipped me a quarter every time he saw me. He was a press agent so I wanted to be a press agent. That&#x27;s the only role model I had. So all I wanted was to grow up to be a guy who could flip a quarter to a nephew.&quot; Lear decided to move to California to restart his career in publicity, driving with his toddler daughter across the country.

His first night in Los Angeles, Lear stumbled upon a production of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Major Barbara&quot; at the 90-seat theater-in-the-round Circle Theater off Sunset Boulevard. One of the actors in the play was Sydney Chaplin, the son of actors Charlie Chaplin and Lita Grey. Charlie Chaplin, Alan Mowbray, and Dame Gladys Cooper sat in front of Lear, and after the show was over, Charlie Chaplin performed.

Lear had a first cousin in Los Angeles, Elaine, who was married to an aspiring comedy writer named Ed Simmons. Simmons and Lear teamed up to sell home furnishings door-to-door for a company called The Gans Brothers and later sold family photos door-to-door. Throughout the 1950s, Lear and Simmons turned out comedy sketches for television appearances of Martin and Lewis, Rowan and Martin, and others. They frequently wrote for Martin and Lewis when they appeared on the &quot;Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, and a 1953 article from &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine stated that Lear and Simmons were guaranteed a record-breaking $52,000 () each to write for five additional Martin and Lewis appearances on the &quot;Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; that year. In a 2015 interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, Lear said that Jerry Lewis had hired him and Simmons as writers for Martin and Lewis three weeks before the comedy duo made their first appearance on the Colgate Comedy Hour in 1950. Lear also acknowledged in 1986 that he and Simmons were the main writers for &quot;The Martin and Lewis Show&quot; for three years.

In 1954, Lear was enlisted as a writer and asked to salvage the new CBS sitcom starring Celeste Holm, &quot;Honestly, Celeste!&quot;, but the program was canceled after eight episodes. During this time he became the producer of NBC&#x27;s short-lived (26 episodes) sitcom &quot;The Martha Raye Show&quot;, after Nat Hiken left as the series director. Lear also wrote some of the opening monologs for &quot;The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show&quot; which aired from 1956 to 1961. In 1959, Lear created his first television series, a half-hour western for Revue Studios called &quot;The Deputy&quot;, starring Henry Fonda.

===1967–1977===

Starting out as a comedy writer, then a film director (he wrote and produced the 1967 film &quot;Divorce American Style&quot; and directed the 1971 film &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;, both starring Dick Van Dyke), Lear tried to sell a concept for a sitcom about a blue-collar American family to ABC. They rejected the show after two pilots were taped: &quot;Justice for All&quot; in 1968 and &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; in 1969. After a third pilot was taped, CBS picked up the show, known as &quot;All in the Family&quot;. It premiered on January 12, 1971, to disappointing ratings, but it took home several Emmy Awards that year, including Outstanding Comedy Series. The show did very well in summer reruns, and it flourished in the 1971–72 season, becoming the top-rated show on TV for the next five years. After falling from the 1 spot, &quot;All in the Family&quot; still remained in the top ten, with the exception of the 1976-1977 television season where it ranked No. 12, and eventually became &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;. The show was based loosely on the British sitcom &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, about an irascible working-class Tory and his socialist son-in-law.

Lear&#x27;s second big TV sitcom, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, was also based on a British sitcom, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, about a west London junk dealer and his son. Lear changed the setting to the Watts section of Los Angeles and the characters to African Americans, and the NBC show &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; was an instant hit. Numerous hit shows followed thereafter, including &quot;Maude&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; (both spin-offs of &quot;All in the Family&quot;), &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, and &quot;Good Times&quot; (which is a spinoff of &quot;Maude&quot;).

Most of these Lear sitcoms share three features: they were shot on videotape in place of film, used a live studio audience, and dealt with current social and political issues. &quot;Maude&quot; is generally considered to be based on Lear&#x27;s wife Frances, which she confirmed, with Charlie Hauck serving as main producer and writer.

Lear&#x27;s longtime producing partner was Bud Yorkin, who also produced &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;, &quot;Maude&quot;, and &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. Yorkin split with Lear in 1975. He started a production company with writers and producers Saul Turteltaub and Bernie Orenstein; however, only two of their shows lasted longer than a year: &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; and &quot;Carter Country&quot;. The Lear/Yorkin company was known as Tandem Productions and was founded in 1958. Lear and talent agent Jerry Perenchio founded T.A.T. Communications (&quot;T.A.T.&quot; stood for the Yiddish phrase &quot;tuchus affen tisch&quot;, &quot;putting one&#x27;s ass on the line&quot;.) in 1974, which co-existed with Tandem Productions and was often referred to in periodicals as Tandem/T.A.T. The Lear organization was one of the most successful independent TV producers of the 1970s. TAT produced the influential and award-winning 1981 film &quot;The Wave&quot; about Ron Jones&#x27; social experiment.

Lear also developed the cult favorite TV series &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot; (&quot;MH MH&quot;) which was turned down by the networks as &quot;too controversial&quot; and placed it into first run syndication with 128 stations in January 1976. A year later, he added another program into first-run syndication along with &quot;MH MH&quot;, &quot;All That Glitters&quot;. He planned in 1977 to offer three hours of prime-time Saturday programming directly having stations place his production company in the position of an occasional network.

In 1977, African-American screenwriter Eric Monte filed a lawsuit accusing ABC and CBS producers Norman Lear, Bud Yorkin, and others of stealing his ideas for &quot;Good Times&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; Monte received a $1-million settlement and a small percentage of the residuals from &quot;Good Times&quot; and one percent ownership of the show. Monte, due to his lack of business knowledge and experience as well as legal representation, would not receive royalties for other shows that he created. However, Lear and other Hollywood producers, outraged over the lawsuit, blacklisted Monte and labeled him too difficult to work with.

===1980–1999===
In 1980, Lear founded the organization People for the American Way for the purpose of counteracting the Christian right group Moral Majority which had been founded in 1979. In the fall of 1981, Lear began a 14-month run as the host of a revival of the classic game show &quot;Quiz Kids&quot; for the CBS Cable Network. In January 1982, Lear and Jerry Perenchio bought Avco Embassy Pictures from Avco Financial Corporation. In January 1982, after merging with company with T.A.T. Communications, the Avco was dropped, and the combined entity was renamed as Embassy Communications, Inc. Embassy Pictures was led by Alan Horn and Martin Schaeffer, later co-founders of Castle Rock Entertainment with Rob Reiner.

In March 1982, Lear produced an ABC television special titled &quot;I Love Liberty&quot;, as a counterbalance to groups like the Moral Majority. Among the many guests who appeared on the special was conservative icon and the 1964 U.S. presidential election&#x27;s Republican nominee Barry Goldwater.

On June 18, 1985, Lear and Perenchio sold Embassy Communications to Columbia Pictures (then owned by The Coca-Cola Company), which acquired Embassy&#x27;s film and television division (including Embassy&#x27;s in-house television productions and the television rights to the Embassy theatrical library) for $485 million of shares of The Coca-Cola Company. The brand Tandem Productions was abandoned in 1986 with the cancellation of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, and Embassy ceased to exist as a single entity in late 1986, having been split into different components owned by different entities. Coca-Cola sold the film division to Dino De Laurentiis and the home video arm to Nelson Holdings (led by Barry Spikings). The TV properties continued under the Columbia Pictures Television banner.

Lear&#x27;s Act III Communications was founded in 1986 and in the following year, Thomas B. McGrath was named president and chief operating officer of ACT III Communications Inc after previously serving as senior vice president. On February 2, 1989, Norman Lear&#x27;s Act III Communications formed a joint venture with Columbia Pictures Television called &quot;Act III Television&quot; to produce television series instead of managing.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Act III Communications purchased several business journals, including &quot;Channels&quot; magazine that had been founded by Les Brown, former &quot;New York Times&quot; TV correspondent. &quot;Channels&quot; closed in 1990, by which time Act III and Brown published and edited &quot;Television Business International&quot; (&quot;TBI&quot;).
In 1997, Lear and Jim George produced the Kids&#x27; WB series &quot;Channel Umptee-3&quot;. The cartoon was notable for being the first television show to meet the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s then-new educational programming requirements.

===2000–2023===
In 2003, Lear appeared on &quot;South Park&quot; during the &quot;I&#x27;m a Little Bit Country&quot; episode, providing the voice of Benjamin Franklin. He also served as a consultant on the episodes &quot;I&#x27;m a Little Bit Country&quot; and &quot;Cancelled&quot;. He attended a &quot;South Park&quot; writers&#x27; retreat, with some of his ideas making it onto &quot;South Park&quot;, and was the officiant at co-creator Trey Parker&#x27;s wedding. &quot;South Park&quot; served as a bond between Lear and his son Benjamin, who was not familiar with his more known work from the 1970s.

In 2014, Lear published &quot;Even This I Get to Experience&quot;, a memoir.

Lear is spotlighted in the 2016 documentary &quot;Norman Lear: Just Another Version of You&quot;. In 2017, he served as executive producer for &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, the reboot of his 1975–1984 show of the same name that premiered on Netflix starring Justina Machado and Rita Moreno as a Cuban-American family. He hosted a podcast, &quot;All of the Above with Norman Lear&quot;, since May 1, 2017. On July 29, 2019, it was announced that Lear had teamed with Lin-Manuel Miranda and Steven Kunes to make an American Masters documentary about Moreno&#x27;s life, tentatively titled &quot;Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It&quot;.

In 2020, it was announced that Lear and Act III Productions would executive produce a revival of &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; At the time of his death in 2023, he was overseeing multiple shows in development, including a planned reboot of &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Lear has been honored for his influence on American television and culture. Before &quot;All in the Family&quot;, television sitcoms in the 1950s and 1960s generally portrayed white American family life as comfortable and avoided raising issues such as racial discrimination and patriarchy. Beginning in 1971, &quot;All in the Family&quot; openly discussed current social and political topics and became the country&#x27;s most popular show for five straight years. Lear&#x27;s subsequent shows widened television&#x27;s representation of racial and gender diversity, such as &quot;Good Times&quot;, the first television show centered on an African-American nuclear family; Television screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky said that Lear &quot;put the American people [on screen] ... he took the audience and put them on the set&quot;. However, it has been acknowledged that James L. Brooks TV series &quot;Room 222&quot;, which was not made by Lear and which debuted before Lear&#x27;s shows debuted, was also among the first shows to not only feature an African American lead character in a less stereotypical role, a high school teacher, but also invoke serious contemporary issues, with the Television Academy Foundation stating that &quot;A season and a half before Norman Lear made &quot;relevant&quot; programming a dominant genre with the introduction of programs like All in the Family and Maude, Room 222 was using the form of the half-hour comedy to discuss serious contemporary issues. During its five seasons on the air, the show included episodes that dealt with such topics as racism, sexism, homophobia, dropping out of school, shoplifting, drug use among both teachers and students, illiteracy, cops in school, guns in school, Vietnam war veterans, venereal disease, and teenage pregnancy&quot;.
In 1999, President Bill Clinton awarded Lear the National Medal of Arts, noting: &quot;Norman Lear has held up a mirror to American society and changed the way we look at it.&quot; That year, he and Bud Yorkin received the Women in Film Lucy Award in recognition of excellence and innovation in creative works that have enhanced the perception of women through the medium of television. The Producers Guild of America awarded Lear its Achievement Award in Television in 2006; by the next year, the honor was named the Norman Lear Achievement Award in Television. In 2017, he was awarded the fourth annual Woody Guthrie Prize presented by the Woody Guthrie Center, recognizing an artist whose work represents the spirit of Woody Guthrie &quot;as a positive force for social change&quot;. He became the oldest recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors later that year at the age of 95.

Lear&#x27;s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is located at 6615 Hollywood Boulevard. He received other numerous honorary accolades, including:

* 1977: Peabody Awards: Lifetime achievement 
* 1977: American Humanist Association: Humanist Arts Award
* 1980: Academy of Achievement Golden Plate Award
* 1984: Television Academy: Hall of Fame 
* 2007: Britannia Awards Excellence in Television
* 2017: National Hispanic Media Coalition Media Icon
* 2017: Peabody Awards: Lifetime achievement

==Political and cultural activities==

Lear was an outspoken supporter of First Amendment and liberal causes. The only time that he did not support the Democratic candidate for president was in 1980 when he supported John Anderson over Jimmy Carter because he considered the Carter administration to be &quot;a complete disaster&quot;.

Lear was one of the wealthy Jewish Angelenos known as the Malibu Mafia. In the 1970s and 1980s, the group discussed progressive and liberal political issues, and worked together to fund them. They helped to fund the legal defense of Daniel Ellsberg who had released the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, and they backed the struggling progressive magazine &quot;The Nation&quot; to keep it afloat. In 1975, they formed the Energy Action Committee to oppose Big Oil&#x27;s powerful lobby in Washington.

===People for the American Way===
In 1981, Lear founded People for the American Way (PFAW), a progressive advocacy organization formed in reaction to the politics of the Christian right. PFAW ran several advertising campaigns opposing the interjection of religion in politics. PFAW and other like-minded groups succeeded in their efforts to block Reagan&#x27;s 1987 nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. Lear, a longtime critic of the Religious Right, was an advocate for the advancement of secularism.

Prominent right-wing Christians including Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and Jimmy Swaggart have accused Lear of being an atheist and holding an anti-Christian bias. In the January 21, 1987, issue of &quot;The Christian Century&quot;, Lear associate Martin E. Marty (a Lutheran professor of church history at the University of Chicago Divinity School between 1963 and 1998) rejected those allegations, stating the television producer honored religious moral values and complimenting Lear&#x27;s understanding of Christianity. Marty noted that while Lear and his family had never practiced Orthodox Judaism, the television producer was a follower of Judaism.

In a 2009 interview with &quot;US News&quot; journalist Dan Gilgoff, Lear rejected claims by right-wing Christian nationalists that he was an atheist and prejudiced against Christianity. Lear held religious beliefs and integrated some evangelical Christian language into his Born Again American campaign. He believed that religion should be kept separate from politics and policymaking. In a 2014 interview with &quot;The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles&quot; journalist Rob Eshman, Lear described himself as a &quot;total Jew&quot; but said he was never a practicing one.

In 1989, Lear founded the Business Enterprise Trust, an educational program that used annual awards, business school case studies, and videos to spotlight exemplary social innovations in American business until it ended in 1998. He announced in 1992 that he was reducing his political activism. In 2000, he provided an endowment for a multidisciplinary research and public policy center, the Norman Lear Center, that explored the convergence of entertainment, commerce, and society at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.

Lear served on the National Advisory Board of the Young Storytellers Foundation. He wrote articles for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. He was a trustee of The Paley Center for Media.

===Declaration of Independence===
In 2001, Lear and his wife, Lyn, purchased a Dunlap broadside—one of the first published copies of the United States Declaration of Independence—for $8.1 million. John Dunlap printed about 200 copies of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. Twenty-five copies survive today and only four of those are in private hands.

Lear said in a press release and on the &quot;Today&quot; show that his intent was to tour the document around the United States so that the country could experience its &quot;birth certificate&quot; firsthand. Through the end of 2004, the document traveled throughout the United States on the Declaration of Independence Road Trip, which Lear organized, visiting several presidential libraries, dozens of museums, as well as the 2002 Olympics, Super Bowl XXXVI, and the Live 8 concert in Philadelphia. Lear and Rob Reiner produced a filmed, dramatic reading of the Declaration of Independence—the last project filmed by famed cinematographer Conrad Hall—on July 4, 2001, at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The film is introduced by Morgan Freeman and Kathy Bates, Benicio del Toro, Michael Douglas, Mel Gibson, Whoopi Goldberg, Graham Greene, Ming-Na Wen, Edward Norton, Winona Ryder, Kevin Spacey, and Renée Zellweger appear as readers. It was directed by Arvin Brown and scored by John Williams.

In 2004, Lear established Declare Yourself which is a national nonpartisan, nonprofit campaign created to empower and encourage eligible 18- to 29-year-olds in America to register and vote. It has registered almost 4 million young people.

Lear was one of 98 &quot;prominent members of Los Angeles&#x27; Jewish community&quot; who signed an open letter supporting the proposed nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers led by the United States. The letter called for the passage of the bill and warned that the ending of the agreement by Congress would be a &quot;tragic mistake&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Lear was married three times. His first marriage was to Charlotte Rosen in 1943. They divorced in 1956.

He was married to Frances Loeb, from 1956 to 1985. They separated in 1983, with Loeb eventually receiving $112 million from Lear in their divorce settlement, part of which she used to found &quot;Lear&#x27;s&quot; magazine.

In 1987, he married Lyn Davis, who survived him. When she met Lear in 1984, Lyn was in the process of earning a doctorate in clinical psychology. She later became a documentary filmmaker through her production company Lyn Lear Productions.

From his three marriages, he had six children. He was a godparent to actress and singer Katey Sagal.

Lear died at his Los Angeles home on December 5, 2023, from cardiac arrest, as a complication of heart failure. He was 101. His body was cremated.

Numerous celebrities paid tribute to Lear, including Jimmy Kimmel, Bill Clinton, Tyler Perry, George Clooney, John Leguizamo, Jon Stewart, Valerie Bertinelli, Bob Iger, Rob Reiner, John Amos, Billy Crystal, Quinta Brunson, Rita Moreno, Mark Hamill, Ben Stiller, Albert Brooks and more. The Simpsons&#x27; episode 9 from the 35th season ends with the words &quot;In memory of Norman Lear&quot; and a picture of Lear where he is depicted as a character from the Simpsons.

==TV productions==
The chart does not include the made-for-television movies &quot;The Wave&quot;, which aired on October 4, 1981, or &quot;Heartsounds&quot;, which aired on September 30, 1984.

<text>Caraway, also known as meridian fennel and Persian cumin (&quot;Carum carvi&quot;), is a biennial plant in the family Apiaceae, native to western Asia, Europe, and North Africa.
 

== Etymology ==
The etymology of &quot;caraway&quot; is unclear. Caraway has been called by many names in different regions, with names deriving from the Latin (cumin), the Greek &quot;karon&quot; (again, cumin), which was adapted into Latin as (now meaning caraway), and the Sanskrit &quot;karavi&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;caraway&quot;, but other times understood to mean &quot;fennel&quot;. English use of the term caraway dates to at least 1440, possibly having Arabic origin.

==Description==
The plant is similar in appearance to other members of the carrot family, with finely divided, feathery leaves with thread-like divisions, growing on stems. The main flower stem is tall, with small white or pink flowers in compound umbels composed of 5–16 unequal rays long. Caraway fruits, informally called seeds, are smooth, crescent-shaped, laterally compressed achenes, around long, with five pale ridges and a distinctive pleasant smell when crushed. It flowers in June and July.

== History ==
Caraway was mentioned by the early Greek botanist Pedanius Dioscorides as a herb and tonic. It was later mentioned in the Roman &quot;Apicius&quot; as an ingredient in recipes. Caraway was known in the Arab world as &quot;karawiya&quot;, and cultivated in Morocco.

== Cultivation ==
The only species that is cultivated is &quot;Carum carvi&quot;, its fruits being used in many ways in cooking and in the preparation of medicinal products and liqueurs. 

The plant prefers warm, sunny locations and well-drained soil rich in organic matter. In warmer regions, it is planted in the winter as an annual. In temperate climates, it is planted as a summer annual or biennial.

It is widely established as a cultivated plant. The Netherlands, Poland and Germany are the top caraway producers. Finland supplies about 28% (2011) of the world&#x27;s caraway production from some 1500 farms, the high output occurring possibly from its favorable climate and latitudes, which ensure long summer hours of sunlight.

==Nutrition==
Caraway seeds are 10% water, 50% carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 15% fat (table). In a reference amount, caraway seeds are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of protein, B vitamins (24–33% DV), vitamin C (25% DV), and several dietary minerals, especially iron (125% DV), phosphorus (81% DV), and zinc (58% DV) (table).

== Phytochemicals ==
When ground, caraway seeds yield up to 7.5% of volatile oil, mostly D-carvone, and 15% fixed oil of which the major fatty acids are oleic, linoleic, petroselinic, and palmitic acids.

Phytochemicals identified in caraway seed oil include thymol, o-cymene, γ‑terpinene, trimethylene dichloride, β-pinene, 2-(1-cyclohexenyl), cyclohexanone, β-phellandrene, 3-carene, α-thujene, and linalool.

== Uses ==

The fruits, usually used whole, have a pungent, anise-like flavor and aroma that comes from essential oils, mostly carvone, limonene, and anethole. Caraway is used as a spice in breads, especially rye bread. A common use of caraway is whole as an addition to rye bread – often called &quot;seeded rye&quot; or Jewish rye bread (see Borodinsky bread). Caraway seeds are often used in Irish soda bread and other baked goods.

Caraway may be used in desserts, liquors, casseroles, and other foods. Its leaves can be added to salads, stews, and soups, and are sometimes consumed as herbs, either raw, dried, or cooked, similar to parsley. The root is consumed as a winter root vegetable in some places, similar to parsnips.

Caraway fruits are found in diverse European cuisines and dishes, for example sauerkraut, and the United Kingdom&#x27;s caraway seed cake. In Austrian cuisine, it is used to season beef and, in German cuisine, pork. In Hungarian cuisine, it is added to goulash, and in Norwegian cuisine and Swedish cuisine, it is used for making caraway black bread. 

Caraway oil is used to for the production of Kümmel liquor in Germany and Russia, Scandinavian akvavit, and Icelandic brennivín. Caraway can be infused in a variety of cheeses, such as havarti and bondost to add flavor. In Latvian cuisine, whole caraway seeds are added to the Jāņi sour milk cheese. In Oxford, where the plant appeared to have become naturalised in a meadow, the seeds were formerly offered on a tray by publicans to people who wished to disguise the odour of their drinker&#x27;s breath.

<doc id="173547" wikidata="Q656772" url="?curid=173547" title="Cayley–Hamilton theorem">
<text>In linear algebra, the Cayley–Hamilton theorem (named after the mathematicians Arthur Cayley and William Rowan Hamilton) states that every square matrix over a commutative ring (such as the real or complex numbers or the integers) satisfies its own characteristic equation.

The characteristic polynomial of an matrix is defined as formula_1, where is the determinant operation, is a variable scalar element of the base ring, and is the identity matrix. Since each entry of the matrix formula_2 is either constant or linear in , the determinant of formula_2 is a degree- monic polynomial in , so it can be written as 
formula_4 By replacing the scalar variable with the matrix , one can define an analogous matrix polynomial expression, formula_5
(Here, formula_6 is the given matrix—not a variable, unlike formula_7—so formula_8 is a constant rather than a function.)
The Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that this polynomial expression is equal to the zero matrix, which is to say that formula_9 that is, the characteristic polynomial formula_10 is an annihilating polynomial for formula_11 

One use for the Cayley–Hamilton theorem is that it allows to be expressed as a linear combination of the lower matrix powers of : 
formula_12
When the ring is a field, the Cayley–Hamilton theorem is equivalent to the statement that the minimal polynomial of a square matrix divides its characteristic polynomial.

A special case of the theorem was first proved by Hamilton in 1853 in terms of inverses of linear functions of quaternions. This corresponds to the special case of certain real or complex matrices. Cayley in 1858 stated the result for and smaller matrices, but only published a proof for the case. As for matrices, Cayley stated “..., I have not thought it necessary to undertake the labor of a formal proof of the theorem in the general case of a matrix of any degree”. The general case was first proved by Ferdinand Frobenius in 1878.

== Examples ==

=== matrices ===

For a matrix , the characteristic polynomial is given by , and so is trivial.

=== matrices ===

As a concrete example, let
formula_13
Its characteristic polynomial is given by
formula_14

The Cayley–Hamilton theorem claims that, if we &quot;define&quot;
formula_15
then
formula_16
We can verify by computation that indeed,
formula_17

For a generic matrix,
formula_18

the characteristic polynomial is given by , so the Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that
formula_19
which is indeed always the case, evident by working out the entries of .

== Applications==

===Determinant and inverse matrix===

For a general invertible matrix , i.e., one with nonzero determinant, −1 can thus be written as an order polynomial expression in : As indicated, the Cayley–Hamilton theorem amounts to the identity 

The coefficients are given by the elementary symmetric polynomials of the eigenvalues of . Using Newton identities, the elementary symmetric polynomials can in turn be expressed in terms of power sum symmetric polynomials of the eigenvalues: 
formula_20 
where is the trace of the matrix . Thus, we can express in terms of the trace of powers of .

In general, the formula for the coefficients is given in terms of complete exponential Bell polynomials as 
formula_21

In particular, the determinant of equals . Thus, the determinant can be written as the trace identity:
formula_22

Likewise, the characteristic polynomial can be written as
formula_23
and, by multiplying both sides by (note ), one is led to an expression for the inverse of as a trace identity,
formula_24

Another method for obtaining these coefficients for a general matrix, provided no root be zero, relies on the following alternative expression for the determinant,
formula_25
Hence, by virtue of the Mercator series,
formula_26
where the exponential &quot;only&quot; needs be expanded to order , since is of order , the net negative powers of automatically vanishing by the C–H theorem. (Again, this requires a ring containing the rational numbers.) Differentiation of this expression with respect to allows one to express the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial for general as determinants of matrices,
formula_27

; Examples
For instance, the first few Bell polynomials are = 1, , , and .

Using these to specify the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix yields

formula_28

The coefficient gives the determinant of the matrix, minus its trace, while its inverse is given by
formula_29

It is apparent from the general formula for &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot;−&quot;k&quot;, expressed in terms of Bell polynomials, that the expressions
formula_30

always give the coefficients of and of in the characteristic polynomial of any matrix, respectively. So, for a matrix , the statement of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem can also be written as
formula_31
where the right-hand side designates a matrix with all entries reduced to zero. Likewise, this determinant in the case, is now
formula_32
This expression gives the negative of coefficient of in the general case, as seen below.

Similarly, one can write for a matrix ,
formula_33

where, now, the determinant is ,

formula_34

and so on for larger matrices. The increasingly complex expressions for the coefficients is deducible from Newton&#x27;s identities or the Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm.

===&quot;n&quot;-th power of matrix===
The Cayley–Hamilton theorem always provides a relationship between the powers of (though not always the simplest one), which allows one to simplify expressions involving such powers, and evaluate them without having to compute the power &quot;n&quot; or any higher powers of .

As an example, for formula_35 the theorem gives 
formula_36

Then, to calculate , observe
formula_37
Likewise,
formula_38

Notice that we have been able to write the matrix power as the sum of two terms. In fact, matrix power of any order can be written as a matrix polynomial of degree at most , where is the size of a square matrix. This is an instance where Cayley–Hamilton theorem can be used to express a matrix function, which we will discuss below systematically.

===Matrix functions===
Given an analytic function
formula_39
and the characteristic polynomial of degree of an matrix , the function can be expressed using long division as 
formula_40
where is some quotient polynomial and is a remainder polynomial such that .

By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, replacing by the matrix gives , so one has
formula_41

Thus, the analytic function of the matrix can be expressed as a matrix polynomial of degree less than .

Let the remainder polynomial be
formula_42
Since , evaluating the function at the eigenvalues of yields
formula_43
This amounts to a system of linear equations, which can be solved to determine the coefficients . Thus, one has 
formula_44

When the eigenvalues are repeated, that is for some , two or more equations are identical; and hence the linear equations cannot be solved uniquely. For such cases, for an eigenvalue with multiplicity , the first derivatives of vanish at the eigenvalue. This leads to the extra linearly independent solutions 
formula_45
which, combined with others, yield the required equations to solve for .

Finding a polynomial that passes through the points is essentially an interpolation problem, and can be solved using Lagrange or Newton interpolation techniques, leading to Sylvester&#x27;s formula.

For example, suppose the task is to find the polynomial representation of 
formula_46

The characteristic polynomial is , and the eigenvalues are . Let . Evaluating at the eigenvalues, one obtains two linear equations, and .

Solving the equations yields and . Thus, it follows that
formula_47

If, instead, the function were , then the coefficients would have been and ; hence
formula_48

As a further example, when considering
formula_49
then the characteristic polynomial is , and the eigenvalues are .

As before, evaluating the function at the eigenvalues gives us the linear equations and ; the solution of which gives, and . Thus, for this case,
formula_50
which is a rotation matrix.

Standard examples of such usage is the exponential map from the Lie algebra of a matrix Lie group into the group. It is given by a matrix exponential,
formula_51
Such expressions have long been known for ,
formula_52
where the are the Pauli matrices and for ,
formula_53
which is Rodrigues&#x27; rotation formula. For the notation, see 3D rotation group#A note on Lie algebras.

More recently, expressions have appeared for other groups, like the Lorentz group , and , as well as . The group is the conformal group of spacetime, its simply connected cover (to be precise, the simply connected cover of the connected component of ). The expressions obtained apply to the standard representation of these groups. They require knowledge of (some of) the eigenvalues of the matrix to exponentiate. For (and hence for ), closed expressions have been obtained for &quot;all&quot; irreducible representations, i.e. of any spin.

===Algebraic number theory===
The Cayley–Hamilton theorem is an effective tool for computing the minimal polynomial of algebraic integers. For example, given a finite extension formula_54 of formula_55 and an algebraic integer formula_56 which is a non-zero linear combination of the formula_57 we can compute the minimal polynomial of formula_58 by finding a matrix representing the formula_55-linear transformation
formula_60
If we call this transformation matrix formula_6, then we can find the minimal polynomial by applying the Cayley–Hamilton theorem to formula_6.

== Proofs ==
The Cayley–Hamilton theorem is an immediate consequence of the existence of the Jordan normal form for matrices over algebraically closed fields, see . In this section, direct proofs are presented.

As the examples above show, obtaining the statement of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem for an matrix

formula_63
requires two steps: first the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are determined by development as a polynomial in of the determinant

formula_64

and then these coefficients are used in a linear combination of powers of that is equated to the zero matrix:
formula_65

The left-hand side can be worked out to an matrix whose entries are (enormous) polynomial expressions in the set of entries of , so the Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that each of these expressions equals . For any fixed value of , these identities can be obtained by tedious but straightforward algebraic manipulations. None of these computations, however, can show why the Cayley–Hamilton theorem should be valid for matrices of all possible sizes , so a uniform proof for all is needed.

=== Preliminaries ===
If a vector of size is an eigenvector of with eigenvalue , in other words if , then
formula_66
which is the zero vector since (the eigenvalues of are precisely the roots of ). This holds for all possible eigenvalues , so the two matrices equated by the theorem certainly give the same (null) result when applied to any eigenvector. Now if admits a basis of eigenvectors, in other words if is diagonalizable, then the Cayley–Hamilton theorem must hold for , since two matrices that give the same values when applied to each element of a basis must be equal. 
formula_67
formula_68
formula_69
formula_70
formula_71

Consider now the function formula_72 which maps matrices to matrices given by the formula formula_73, i.e. which takes a matrix formula_6 and plugs it into its own characteristic polynomial. Not all matrices are diagonalizable, but for matrices with complex coefficients many of them are: the set formula_75 of diagonalizable complex square matrices of a given size is dense in the set of all such square matrices (for a matrix to be diagonalizable it suffices for instance that its characteristic polynomial not have any multiple roots). Now viewed as a function formula_76(since matrices have formula_77 entries) we see that this function is continuous. This is true because the entries of the image of a matrix are given by polynomials in the entries of the matrix. Since
formula_78

and since the set formula_75 is dense, by continuity this function must map the entire set of matrices to the zero matrix. Therefore, the Cayley–Hamilton theorem is true for complex numbers, and must therefore also hold for formula_80- or formula_81-valued matrices.

While this provides a valid proof, the argument is not very satisfactory, since the identities represented by the theorem do not in any way depend on the nature of the matrix (diagonalizable or not), nor on the kind of entries allowed (for matrices with real entries the diagonalizable ones do not form a dense set, and it seems strange one would have to consider complex matrices to see that the Cayley–Hamilton theorem holds for them). We shall therefore now consider only arguments that prove the theorem directly for any matrix using algebraic manipulations only; these also have the benefit of working for matrices with entries in any commutative ring.

There is a great variety of such proofs of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, of which several will be given here. They vary in the amount of abstract algebraic notions required to understand the proof. The simplest proofs use just those notions needed to formulate the theorem (matrices, polynomials with numeric entries, determinants), but involve technical computations that render somewhat mysterious the fact that they lead precisely to the correct conclusion. It is possible to avoid such details, but at the price of involving more subtle algebraic notions: polynomials with coefficients in a non-commutative ring, or matrices with unusual kinds of entries.

==== Adjugate matrices ====
All proofs below use the notion of the adjugate matrix of an matrix , the transpose of its cofactor matrix. This is a matrix whose coefficients are given by polynomial expressions in the coefficients of (in fact, by certain determinants), in such a way that the following fundamental relations hold,
formula_82
These relations are a direct consequence of the basic properties of determinants: evaluation of the entry of the matrix product on the left gives the expansion by column of the determinant of the matrix obtained from by replacing column by a copy of column , which is if and zero otherwise; the matrix product on the right is similar, but for expansions by rows.

Being a consequence of just algebraic expression manipulation, these relations are valid for matrices with entries in any commutative ring (commutativity must be assumed for determinants to be defined in the first place). This is important to note here, because these relations will be applied below for matrices with non-numeric entries such as polynomials.

=== A direct algebraic proof ===
This proof uses just the kind of objects needed to formulate the Cayley–Hamilton theorem: matrices with polynomials as entries. The matrix whose determinant is the characteristic polynomial of is such a matrix, and since polynomials form a commutative ring, it has an adjugate
formula_83
Then, according to the right-hand fundamental relation of the adjugate, one has
formula_84

Since is also a matrix with polynomials in as entries, one can, for each , collect the coefficients of in each entry to form a matrix of numbers, such that one has
formula_85
(The way the entries of are defined makes clear that no powers higher than occur). While this &quot;looks&quot; like a polynomial with matrices as coefficients, we shall not consider such a notion; it is just a way to write a matrix with polynomial entries as a linear combination of constant matrices, and the coefficient has been written to the left of the matrix to stress this point of view.

Now, one can expand the matrix product in our equation by bilinearity:
formula_86

Writing
formula_87
one obtains an equality of two matrices with polynomial entries, written as linear combinations of constant matrices with powers of as coefficients.

Such an equality can hold only if in any matrix position the entry that is multiplied by a given power is the same on both sides; it follows that the constant matrices with coefficient in both expressions must be equal. Writing these equations then for from down to 0, one finds
formula_88

Finally, multiply the equation of the coefficients of from the left by , and sum up:

formula_89

The left-hand sides form a telescoping sum and cancel completely; the right-hand sides add up to formula_90:
formula_91
This completes the proof.

=== A proof using polynomials with matrix coefficients ===
This proof is similar to the first one, but tries to give meaning to the notion of polynomial with matrix coefficients that was suggested by the expressions occurring in that proof. This requires considerable care, since it is somewhat unusual to consider polynomials with coefficients in a non-commutative ring, and not all reasoning that is valid for commutative polynomials can be applied in this setting.

Notably, while arithmetic of polynomials over a commutative ring models the arithmetic of polynomial functions, this is not the case over a non-commutative ring (in fact there is no obvious notion of polynomial function in this case that is closed under multiplication). So when considering polynomials in with matrix coefficients, the variable must not be thought of as an &quot;unknown&quot;, but as a formal symbol that is to be manipulated according to given rules; in particular one cannot just set to a specific value.
formula_92

Let formula_93 be the ring of matrices with entries in some ring &quot;R&quot; (such as the real or complex numbers) that has as an element. Matrices with as coefficients polynomials in , such as formula_94 or its adjugate &quot;B&quot; in the first proof, are elements of formula_95.

By collecting like powers of , such matrices can be written as &quot;polynomials&quot; in with constant matrices as coefficients; write formula_96 for the set of such polynomials. Since this set is in bijection with formula_95, one defines arithmetic operations on it correspondingly, in particular multiplication is given by
formula_98
respecting the order of the coefficient matrices from the two operands; obviously this gives a non-commutative multiplication.

Thus, the identity
formula_99
from the first proof can be viewed as one involving a multiplication of elements in formula_96.

At this point, it is tempting to simply set equal to the matrix , which makes the first factor on the left equal to the zero matrix, and the right hand side equal to ; however, this is not an allowed operation when coefficients do not commute. It is possible to define a &quot;right-evaluation map&quot; , which replaces each by the matrix power of , where one stipulates that the power is always to be multiplied on the right to the corresponding coefficient. But this map is not a ring homomorphism: the right-evaluation of a product differs in general from the product of the right-evaluations. This is so because multiplication of polynomials with matrix coefficients does not model multiplication of expressions containing unknowns: a product formula_101 is defined assuming that commutes with , but this may fail if is replaced by the matrix .

One can work around this difficulty in the particular situation at hand, since the above right-evaluation map does become a ring homomorphism if the matrix is in the center of the ring of coefficients, so that it commutes with all the coefficients of the polynomials (the argument proving this is straightforward, exactly because commuting with coefficients is now justified after evaluation).

Now, is not always in the center of , but we may replace with a smaller ring provided it contains all the coefficients of the polynomials in question: formula_102, , and the coefficients formula_103 of the polynomial . The obvious choice for such a subring is the centralizer of , the subring of all matrices that commute with ; by definition is in the center of .

This centralizer obviously contains formula_102, and , but one has to show that it contains the matrices formula_103. To do this, one combines the two fundamental relations for adjugates, writing out the adjugate as a polynomial:
formula_106

Equating the coefficients shows that for each , we have as desired. Having found the proper setting in which is indeed a homomorphism of rings, one can complete the proof as suggested above:
formula_107
This completes the proof.

=== A synthesis of the first two proofs ===
In the first proof, one was able to determine the coefficients of based on the right-hand fundamental relation for the adjugate only. In fact the first equations derived can be interpreted as determining the quotient of the Euclidean division of the polynomial on the left by the monic polynomial , while the final equation expresses the fact that the remainder is zero. This division is performed in the ring of polynomials with matrix coefficients. Indeed, even over a non-commutative ring, Euclidean division by a monic polynomial is defined, and always produces a unique quotient and remainder with the same degree condition as in the commutative case, provided it is specified at which side one wishes to be a factor (here that is to the left).

To see that quotient and remainder are unique (which is the important part of the statement here), it suffices to write formula_108 as formula_109 and observe that since is monic, cannot have a degree less than that of , unless .

But the dividend and divisor used here both lie in the subring , where is the subring of the matrix ring generated by : the -linear span of all powers of . Therefore, the Euclidean division can in fact be performed within that &quot;commutative&quot; polynomial ring, and of course it then gives the same quotient and remainder 0 as in the larger ring; in particular this shows that in fact lies in .

But, in this commutative setting, it is valid to set to in the equation

formula_110

in other words, to apply the evaluation map

formula_111

which is a ring homomorphism, giving

formula_112

just like in the second proof, as desired.

In addition to proving the theorem, the above argument tells us that the coefficients of are polynomials in , while from the second proof we only knew that they lie in the centralizer of ; in general is a larger subring than , and not necessarily commutative. In particular the constant term lies in . Since is an arbitrary square matrix, this proves that can always be expressed as a polynomial in (with coefficients that depend on .

In fact, the equations found in the first proof allow successively expressing formula_113 as polynomials in , which leads to the identity

valid for all matrices, where 
formula_114 
is the characteristic polynomial of .

Note that this identity also implies the statement of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem: one may move to the right hand side, multiply the resulting equation (on the left or on the right) by , and use the fact that
formula_115

=== A proof using matrices of endomorphisms ===
As was mentioned above, the matrix &quot;p&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) in statement of the theorem is obtained by first evaluating the determinant and then substituting the matrix &quot;A&quot; for &quot;t&quot;; doing that substitution into the matrix formula_94 before evaluating the determinant is not meaningful. Nevertheless, it is possible to give an interpretation where is obtained directly as the value of a certain determinant, but this requires a more complicated setting, one of matrices over a ring in which one can interpret both the entries formula_117 of , and all of itself. One could take for this the ring of matrices over , where the entry formula_117 is realised as formula_119, and as itself. But considering matrices with matrices as entries might cause confusion with block matrices, which is not intended, as that gives the wrong notion of determinant (recall that the determinant of a matrix is defined as a sum of products of its entries, and in the case of a block matrix this is generally not the same as the corresponding sum of products of its blocks!). It is clearer to distinguish from the endomorphism of an -dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; (or free -module if is not a field) defined by it in a basis formula_120, and to take matrices over the ring End(&quot;V&quot;) of all such endomorphisms. Then is a possible matrix entry, while designates the element of whose entry is endomorphism of scalar multiplication by formula_117; similarly formula_102 will be interpreted as element of . However, since is not a commutative ring, no determinant is defined on ; this can only be done for matrices over a commutative subring of . Now the entries of the matrix formula_123 all lie in the subring generated by the identity and , which is commutative. Then a determinant map is defined, and formula_124 evaluates to the value of the characteristic polynomial of at (this holds independently of the relation between and ); the Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that is the null endomorphism.

In this form, the following proof can be obtained from that of (which in fact is the more general statement related to the Nakayama lemma; one takes for the ideal in that proposition the whole ring ). The fact that is the matrix of in the basis means that
formula_125
One can interpret these as components of one equation in , whose members can be written using the matrix-vector product that is defined as usual, but with individual entries and in being &quot;multiplied&quot; by forming formula_126; this gives:
formula_127
where formula_128 is the element whose component is (in other words it is the basis of written as a column of vectors). Writing this equation as
formula_129
one recognizes the transpose of the matrix formula_123 considered above, and its determinant (as element of is also &quot;p&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;). To derive from this equation that , one left-multiplies by the adjugate matrix of formula_131, which is defined in the matrix ring , giving
formula_132
the associativity of matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplication used in the first step is a purely formal property of those operations, independent of the nature of the entries. Now component of this equation says that ; thus vanishes on all , and since these elements generate it follows that , completing the proof.

One additional fact that follows from this proof is that the matrix whose characteristic polynomial is taken need not be identical to the value substituted into that polynomial; it suffices that be an endomorphism of satisfying the initial equations

formula_133
for &quot;some&quot; sequence of elements that generate (which space might have smaller dimension than , or in case the ring is not a field it might not be a free module at all).

=== A bogus &quot;proof&quot;: ===
One persistent elementary but &quot;incorrect&quot; argument for the theorem is to &quot;simply&quot; take the definition
formula_134
and substitute for , obtaining
formula_135

There are many ways to see why this argument is wrong. First, in the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, is an &quot; matrix&quot;. However, the right hand side of the above equation is the value of a determinant, which is a &quot;scalar&quot;. So they cannot be equated unless (i.e. is just a scalar). Second, in the expression formula_136, the variable λ actually occurs at the diagonal entries of the matrix formula_137. To illustrate, consider the characteristic polynomial in the previous example again:

formula_138

If one substitutes the entire matrix for in those positions, one obtains

formula_139

in which the &quot;matrix&quot; expression is simply not a valid one. Note, however, that if scalar multiples of identity matrices
instead of scalars are subtracted in the above, i.e. if the substitution is performed as

formula_140

then the determinant is indeed zero, but the expanded matrix in question does not evaluate to formula_141; nor can its determinant (a scalar) be compared to &quot;p&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) (a matrix). So the argument that formula_142 still does not apply.

Actually, if such an argument holds, it should also hold when other multilinear forms instead of determinant is used. For instance, if we consider the permanent function and define formula_143, then by the same argument, we should be able to &quot;prove&quot; that . But this statement is demonstrably wrong: in the 2-dimensional case, for instance, the permanent of a matrix is given by

formula_144

So, for the matrix in the previous example,

formula_145

Yet one can verify that

formula_146

One of the proofs for Cayley–Hamilton theorem above bears some similarity to the argument that formula_147. By introducing a matrix with non-numeric coefficients, one can actually let live inside a matrix entry, but then formula_148 is not equal to , and the conclusion is reached differently.

===Proofs using methods of abstract algebra===

Basic properties of Hasse–Schmidt derivations on the exterior algebra formula_149 of some -module (supposed to be free and of finite rank) have been used by to prove the Cayley–Hamilton theorem. See also .

=== A combinatorial proof ===
A proof based on developing the Leibniz formula for the characteristic polynomial was given by Straubing and a generalization was given using trace monoid theory of Foata and Cartier.

==Abstraction and generalizations==

The above proofs show that the Cayley–Hamilton theorem holds for matrices with entries in any commutative ring , and that will hold whenever is an endomorphism of an -module generated by elements that satisfies

formula_150

This more general version of the theorem is the source of the celebrated Nakayama lemma in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

The Cayley-Hamilton theorem also holds for matrices over the quaternions, a noncommutative ring.

<doc id="173548" wikidata="Q43511" url="?curid=173548" title="Fennel">
<text>Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is a flowering plant species in the carrot family. It is a hardy, perennial herb with yellow flowers and feathery leaves. It is indigenous to the shores of the Mediterranean but has become widely naturalized in many parts of the world, especially on dry soils near the sea coast and on riverbanks.

It is a highly flavorful herb used in cooking and, along with the similar-tasting anise, is one of the primary ingredients of absinthe. Florence fennel or finocchio (, , ) is a selection with a swollen, bulb-like stem base that is used as a vegetable.

== Description ==
&quot;Foeniculum vulgare&quot; is a perennial herb. The stem is hollow, erect, and glaucous green, and it can grow up to tall. The leaves grow up to long; they are finely dissected, with the ultimate segments filiform (threadlike), about wide. Its leaves are similar to those of dill, but thinner.

The flowers are produced in terminal compound umbels wide, each umbel section having 20–50 tiny yellow flowers on short pedicels. The fruit is a dry schizocarp from long, half as wide or less, and grooved. Since the seed in the fruit is attached to the pericarp, the whole fruit is often mistakenly called &quot;seed&quot;.

=== Chemistry ===
The aromatic character of fennel fruits derives from volatile oils imparting mixed aromas, including trans-anethole and estragole (resembling liquorice), fenchone (mint and camphor), limonene, 1-octen-3-ol (mushroom). Other phytochemicals found in fennel fruits include polyphenols, such as rosmarinic acid and luteolin, among others in minor content.

=== Similar species ===
Some plants in the Apiaceae family are poisonous and often difficult to identify.

Dill, coriander, ajwain, and caraway are similar-looking herbs but shorter-growing than fennel, reaching only . Dill has thread-like, feathery leaves and yellow flowers; coriander and caraway have white flowers and finely divided leaves (though not as fine as dill or fennel) and are also shorter-lived (being annual or biennial plants). The superficial similarity in appearance between these seeds may have led to a sharing of names and etymology, as in the case of meridian fennel, a term for caraway.

Giant fennel (&quot;Ferula communis&quot;) is a large, coarse plant with a pungent aroma, which grows wild in the Mediterranean region and is only occasionally grown in gardens elsewhere. Other species of the genus &quot;Ferula&quot; are also called giant fennel, but they are not culinary herbs.

In North America, fennel may be found growing in the same habitat and alongside natives osha (&quot;Ligusticum porteri&quot;) and &quot;Lomatium&quot; species, useful medicinal relatives in the parsley family.

Most &quot;Lomatium&quot; species have yellow flowers like fennel, but some are white-flowered and resemble poison hemlock. &quot;Lomatium&quot; is an important historical food plant of Native Americans known as &#x27;biscuit root&#x27;. Most &quot;Lomatium&quot; spp. have finely divided, hairlike leaves; their roots have a delicate rice-like odor, unlike the musty odor of hemlock. &quot;Lomatium&quot; species prefer dry, rocky soils devoid of organic material.

== Etymology ==
Fennel came into Old English from Old French &quot;fenoil&quot; which in turn came from Latin , a diminutive of , meaning &quot;hay&quot;.

== Cultivation ==
Fennel is widely cultivated, both in its native range and elsewhere, for its edible, strongly flavored leaves and fruits. Its aniseed or liquorice flavor comes from anethole, an aromatic compound also found in anise and star anise, and its taste and aroma are similar to theirs, though usually not as strong.

Florence fennel (&quot;Foeniculum vulgare&quot; Azoricum Group; syn. &quot;F. vulgare&quot; var. &quot;azoricum&quot;) is a cultivar group with inflated leaf bases which form a bulb-like structure. It is of cultivated origin, and has a mild anise-like flavor but is sweeter and more aromatic. Florence fennel plants are smaller than the wild type. Several cultivars of Florence fennel are also known by several other names, notably the Italian name &quot;finocchio&quot;. In North American supermarkets, it is often mislabeled as &quot;anise.&quot;

&quot;Foeniculum vulgare&quot; &#x27;Purpureum&#x27; or &#x27;Nigra&#x27;, &quot;bronze-leaved&quot; fennel, is widely available as a decorative garden plant.

Fennel has become naturalized along roadsides, in pastures, and in other open sites in many regions, including northern Europe, the United States, southern Canada, and much of Asia and Australia. It propagates well by both root crown and seed and is considered an invasive species and a weed in Australia and the United States. It can drastically alter the composition and structure of many plant communities, including grasslands, coastal scrub, riparian, and wetland communities. It appears to do this by outcompeting native species for light, nutrients, and water and perhaps by exuding allelopathic substances that inhibit the growth of other plants. In western North America, fennel can be found from the coastal and inland wildland-urban interface east into hill and mountain areas, excluding desert habitats. On Santa Cruz Island, California for example, fennel has achieved 50 to 90% absolute cover.

=== Production ===
As grouped by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, production data for fennel are combined with similar spices – anise, star anise, and coriander. In 2014, India produced 60% of the world output of fennel, with China and Bulgaria as leading secondary producers.

== Uses ==

Fennel was prized by the ancient Greeks and Romans, who used it as medicine, food, and insect repellent. Fennel tea was believed to give courage to warriors before battle. According to Greek mythology, Prometheus used a giant stalk of fennel to carry fire from Mount Olympus to Earth. Emperor Charlemagne required the cultivation of fennel on all imperial farms.

Florence fennel is one of the three main herbs used in the preparation of absinthe, an alcoholic mixture which originated as a medicinal elixir in Europe and became, by the late 19th century, a popular alcoholic drink in France and other countries. Fennel fruit is a common and traditional spice in flavored Scandinavian brännvin (a loosely defined group of distilled spirits, which include akvavit). Fennel is also featured in the Chinese Materia Medica for its medicinal functions.

A 2016 study found &quot;F. vulgare&quot; essential oil to have insecticidal properties.

=== Nutrition ===
A raw fennel bulb is 90% water, 1% protein, 7% carbohydrates, and contains negligible fat.

Dried fennel seeds are typically used as a spice in minute quantities. A reference amount of of fennel seeds provides of food energy and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of protein, dietary fiber, B vitamins and several dietary minerals, especially calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese, all of which exceed 90% DV. Fennel seeds are 52% carbohydrates (including 40% dietary fiber), 15% fat, 16% protein, and 9% water.

=== Cuisine ===
The bulb, foliage, and fruits of the fennel plant are used in many of the culinary traditions of the world. The small flowers of wild fennel (known as fennel &quot;pollen&quot;) are the most potent form of fennel, but also the most expensive. Dried fennel fruit is an aromatic, anise-flavored spice, brown or green when fresh, slowly turning a dull grey as the fruit ages. For cooking, green fruits are optimal. The leaves are delicately flavored and similar in shape to dill. The bulb is a crisp vegetable that can be sautéed, stewed, braised, grilled, or eaten raw. Tender young leaves are used for garnishes, as a salad, to add flavor to salads, to flavor sauces to be served with puddings, and in soups and fish sauce. Both the inflated leaf bases and the tender young shoots can be eaten like celery.

Fennel fruits are sometimes confused with those of anise, which are similar in taste and appearance, though smaller. Fennel is also a flavoring in some natural toothpastes. The fruits are used in cookery and sweet desserts.

Many cultures in India, Afghanistan, Iran, and the Middle East use fennel fruits in cooking. In Iraq, fennel seeds are used as an ingredient in nigella-flavored breads. It is one of the most important spices in Kashmiri cuisine and Gujarati cooking. In Indian cuisine, whole fennel seeds and fennel powder are used as a spice in various sweet and savory dishes. It is an essential ingredient in the Assamese/Bengali/Oriya spice mixture &quot;panch phoron&quot; and in Chinese five-spice powders. In many parts of India, roasted fennel fruits are consumed as &quot;mukhwas&quot;, an after-meal digestive and breath freshener (saunf), or candied as comfit. Fennel seeds are also often used as an ingredient in paan, a breath freshener most popularly consumed in India. In China, fennel stem and leaves are often ingredients in the stuffings of jiaozi, baozi, or pies, as well in cold dishes as a green vegetable. Fennel fruits are present in well-known mixed spices such as the five-spice powder or .

Fennel leaves are used in some parts of India as leafy green vegetables either by themselves or mixed with other vegetables, cooked to be served and consumed as part of a meal. In Syria and Lebanon, the young leaves are used to make a special kind of egg omelette (along with onions and flour) called &quot;.

Many egg, fish, and other dishes employ fresh or dried fennel leaves. Florence fennel is a key ingredient in some Italian salads, or it can be braised and served as a warm side dish. It may be blanched or marinated, or cooked in risotto.

Fennel fruits are the primary flavor component in Italian sausage. In Spain, the stems of the fennel plant are used in the preparation of pickled eggplants, &quot;. A herbal tea or &quot;tisane&quot; can also be made from fennel.

On account of its aromatic properties, fennel fruit forms one of the ingredients of the well-known compound liquorice powder. In the Indian subcontinent, fennel fruits are eaten raw, sometimes with a sweetener.

== Culture ==

The Greek name for fennel is &quot;marathon&quot; () or &quot;marathos&quot; (), and the place of the famous battle of Marathon literally means a plain with fennel. The word is first attested in Mycenaean Linear B form as &quot;&quot;. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Prometheus steals the ember of fire from the gods in a hollow fennel stalk.

As Old English &quot;&quot;, fennel is one of the nine plants invoked in the pagan Anglo-Saxon &quot;Nine Herbs Charm&quot;, recorded in the 10th century.

In the 15th century, Portuguese settlers on Madeira noticed the abundance of wild fennel and used the Portuguese word &quot;&quot; (fennel) and the suffix &quot;&quot; to form the name of a new town, Funchal.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 1842 poem &quot;The Goblet of Life&quot; repeatedly refers to the plant and mentions its purported ability to strengthen eyesight:

&lt;poem&gt;Above the lower plants, it towers,
The Fennel with its yellow flowers;
And in an earlier age than ours
Was gifted with the wondrous powers
Lost vision to restore.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="173555" wikidata="Q1143358" url="?curid=173555" title="Shortstop">
<text>Shortstop, abbreviated SS, is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base, which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions. Historically, the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order. Today, shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup. In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6.

More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position, as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters, and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly. Like a second baseman, a shortstop must be agile, for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play. Also, like a third baseman, the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield, where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base.

==History==
Doc Adams of the Knickerbockers created the concept of the shortstop position, according to baseball historian John Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy Berowski. In the first five years the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra outfielders were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield because of the balls&#x27; light weight. Adams&#x27;s shortstop position, which he started playing at some time from 1849 to 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders. The position, more of a fourth outfielder than an infielder, was also then called &quot;short fielder&quot; (a term still used in soft-pitch softball for the 10th player).

With the advent of higher-quality baseballs, Adams moved to the infield, since the distance the balls could travel increased. However, Dickey Pearce, primarily of the Brooklyn Atlantics, is credited as the first to have played the shortstop position as it is played now. Adams had a long playing career with the Knickerbockers: he remained a player with the team until 1860.

==Positioning==
Unlike the pitcher and catcher, who must start every play in a designated area (the pitcher must be on the pitcher&#x27;s mound, with one foot in contact with the pitcher&#x27;s rubber, and the catcher must be behind home plate in the catcher&#x27;s box) the shortstop and the other fielders can vary their positioning in response to what they anticipate will be the actions of the batter and runner(s) once the play begins.

The shortstop ordinarily is positioned near second base on the third-base side. Because right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball more toward third base, a shortstop will generally move closer to third base if the batter is batting right-handed, and more toward first base if the batter is batting left-handed. A shortstop typically has a strong throwing arm, because he has a relatively long throw to first base, and often has less time in which to make a throw, given that the ground balls he fields have often traveled relatively far. A shortstop must also be extremely agile, because balls hit to or near the shortstop position are usually hit harder than to other infield positions.

Shortstops are required to cover second base in double play situations when the ball is hit to the second baseman or first baseman. They also cover second when a runner is attempting a stolen base, but only when a left-handed hitter is batting because the infield will respond to a left-handed batter by shifting toward first base, resulting in the shortstop being the infielder who is closest to second base. Shortstops also must cover third at various times, including the rotation play; the latter occurs when there are runners on first and second and a sacrifice bunt is attempted toward third base, requiring the third baseman to move in away from third base in order to field it. Shortstops generally are given precedence on catching pop-ups in the infield as well, so they end up calling off other players many times, although on deep pop-ups they generally fall back when called off by an outfielder. They often become the cutoff man on balls to any part of the outfield that are being directed towards third base and all balls to left and center field that are destined for second base. Depending on the system the shortstop may cut balls from left field heading home; however, this is usually the job of the third baseman.

The emphasis on defense makes the position unusually difficult to fill. Historically, a strong shortstop did not have to be a good hitter. Some of the weakest hitters in Major League Baseball have played the position, including Mario Mendoza, for whom George Brett popularized the eponymous Mendoza Line to describe a batting average below .200. Since the 1960s, however, such mediocre hitting has become rarer as teams increasingly demand players with ability to both field and hit.

In practice, a marginal fielder as a shortstop who hits well can be moved to almost any other position, especially second base or third base, whether early in their careers (examples: George Brett and Mike Schmidt were both tried early in their careers as shortstops) or later due to diminished fielding range, slower reflexes, weaker throwing arms, increased risk of injury, or co-existence with another dominant shortstop, as with Ernie Banks, Cal Ripken Jr., Alex Rodríguez, Michael Young, or Miguel Tejada.

<doc id="173560" wikidata="Q3631362" url="?curid=173560" title="English novel">
<text>The English novel is an important part of English literature. This article mainly concerns novels, written in English, by novelists who were born or have spent a significant part of their lives in England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland (or any part of Ireland before 1922). However, given the nature of the subject, this guideline has been applied with common sense, and reference is made to novels in other languages or novelists who are not primarily British, where appropriate.

==Early novels in English== 

Historically, the English novel has generally been seen as beginning with Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1719) and &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; (1722), though modern scholarship cites Aphra Behn&#x27;s &quot;Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister&quot; (1684) John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1678) and Aphra Behn&#x27;s &quot;Oroonoko&quot; (1688) as more likely contenders, while earlier works such as Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (1485), and even the &quot;Prologue&quot; to Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales (c. 1400)&quot; have been suggested. Another important early novel is &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726, amended 1735), by Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, which is both a satire of human nature, as well as a parody of travellers&#x27; tales like &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. The rise of the novel as an important literary genre is generally associated with the growth of the middle class in England.

Other major 18th-century English novelists are Samuel Richardson (1689–1761), author of the epistolary novels &quot;Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded&quot; (1740) and &quot;Clarissa; or, The History of a Young Lady&quot; (1747–48); Henry Fielding (1707–1754), who wrote &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; (1742) and &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot; (1749); Laurence Sterne (1713–1768), who published &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; in parts between 1759 and 1767; Oliver Goldsmith (1728–1774), author of &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; (1766); Tobias Smollett (1721–1771), a Scottish novelist best known for his comic picaresque novels, such as &quot;The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle&quot; (1751) and &quot;The Expedition of Humphry Clinker&quot; (1771), who influenced Charles Dickens; and Fanny Burney (1752–1840), whose novels &quot;were enjoyed and admired by Jane Austen,&quot; wrote &quot;Evelina&quot; (1778), &quot;Cecilia&quot; (1782) and &quot;Camilla&quot; (1796).

A noteworthy aspect of both the 18th- and 19th- century novel is the way the novelist directly addressed the reader. For example, the author might interrupt his or her narrative to pass judgment on a character, or pity or praise another, and inform or remind the reader of some other relevant issue.

==Romantic period==
The phrase &#x27;Romantic novel&#x27; has several possible meanings. Here it refers to novels written during the Romantic era in literary history, which runs from the late 18th century until the beginning of the Victorian era in 1837. But to complicate matters there are novels written in the romance tradition by novelists like Walter Scott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, George Meredith. In addition the phrase today is mostly used to refer to the popular pulp-fiction genre that focusses on romantic love. The Romantic period is especially associated with the poets William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, George Byron, Percy Shelley and John Keats, though two major novelists, Jane Austen and Walter Scott, also published in the early 19th century.

Horace Walpole&#x27;s 1764 novel, &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;, invented the Gothic fiction genre. The word gothic was originally used in the sense of medieval. This genre combines &quot;the macabre, fantastic, and supernatural&quot; and usually involves haunted castles, graveyards and various picturesque elements. Later novelist Ann Radcliffe introduced the brooding figure of the Gothic villain which developed into the Byronic hero. Her most popular and influential work, &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; (1794), is frequently described as the archetypal Gothic novel. &quot;Vathek&quot; (1786), by William Beckford, and &quot;The Monk&quot; (1796), by Matthew Lewis, were further notable early works in both the Gothic and horror genres.

Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818), as another important Gothic novel as well as being an early example of science fiction. 
The vampire genre fiction began with John William Polidori&#x27;s &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of Lord Byron and his poem &quot;The Giaour&quot;. An important later work is &quot;Varney the Vampire&quot; (1845), where many standard vampire conventions originated: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, and has hypnotic powers and superhuman strength. Varney was also the first example of the &quot;sympathetic vampire&quot;, who loathes his condition but is a slave to it.
Among more minor novelists in this period Maria Edgeworth (1768–1849) and Thomas Love Peacock (1785–1866) are worthy of comment. Edgeworth&#x27;s novel &quot;Castle Rackrent&quot; (1800) is &quot;the first fully developed regional novel in English&quot; as well as &quot;the first true historical novel in English&quot; and an important influence on Walter Scott. Peacock was primarily a satirist in novels such as &quot;Nightmare Abbey&quot; (1818) and &quot;The Misfortunes of Elphin&quot; (1829).

Jane Austen&#x27;s (1775–1817) works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Austen brings to light the hardships women faced, who usually did not inherit money, could not work and where their only chance in life depended on the man they married. She reveals not only the difficulties women faced in her day, but also what was expected of men and of the careers they had to follow. This she does with wit and humour and with endings where all characters, good or bad, receive exactly what they deserve. Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew&#x27;s &quot;A Memoir of Jane Austen&quot; introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become accepted as a major writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a Janeite fan culture. Austen&#x27;s works include &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1813) &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1811), &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, &quot;Persuasion&quot; and &quot;Emma&quot;. 

The other major novelist at the beginning of the early 19th century was Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832), who was not only a highly successful British novelist but &quot;the greatest single influence on fiction in the 19th century ... [and] a European figure&quot;. Scott established the genre of the historical novel with his series of Waverley Novels, including &quot;Waverley&quot; (1814), &quot;The Antiquary&quot; (1816), and &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot; (1818). However, Austen is today widely read and the source for films and television series, while Scott is less often read.

==Victorian novel==

It was in the Victorian era (1837–1901) that the novel became the leading literary genre in English. A number of women novelists were successful in the 19th century, although they often had to use a masculine pseudonym. At the beginning of the 19th century most novels were published in three volumes. However, monthly serialization was revived with the publication of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot; in twenty parts between April 1836 and November 1837. Demand was high for each episode to introduce some new element, whether it was a plot twist or a new character, so as to maintain the readers&#x27; interest. Both Dickens and Thackeray frequently published this way.

In the 1830s and &#x27;40s, novelists began to show the influence of social critics on their work, especially Thomas Carlyle, who raised the &quot;Condition-of-England Question&quot; to describe &quot;the social and political upheavals which followed the Reform Act of 1832&quot;. In response, novelists wrote &quot;Condition of England novels&quot;, which were in many ways a reaction to rapid industrialization, and the social, political and economic issues associated with it, and were a means of commenting on abuses of government and industry and the suffering of the poor, who were not profiting from England&#x27;s economic prosperity. Stories of the working-class poor were directed toward the middle class to help create sympathy and promote change. An early example is Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1837–38).
Charles Dickens emerged on the literary scene in the 1830s with the two novels already mentioned. Dickens wrote vividly about London life and struggles of the poor, but in a good-humoured fashion, accessible to readers of all classes. One of his most popular works to this day is &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843). In more recent years Dickens has been most admired for his later novels, such as &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1846–48), &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1860–61), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1852–53), &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1855–57), and &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; (1864–65). An early rival to Dickens was William Makepeace Thackeray, who during the Victorian period ranked second only to him, but he is now much less read and is known almost exclusively for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (1847). In that novel he satirizes whole swaths of humanity while retaining a light touch. It features his most memorable character, the engagingly roguish Becky Sharp. 

The Brontë sisters were other significant novelists in the 1840s and 1850s. Their novels caused a sensation when they were first published and were subsequently accepted as classics. They had written compulsively from early childhood and were first published, at their own expense, in 1846 as poets under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. The sisters returned to prose, producing a novel each the following year: Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, Emily&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and Anne&#x27;s &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;. Later, Anne&#x27;s &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; (1848) and Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;Villette&quot; (1853) were published. Elizabeth Gaskell was also a successful writer and her first novel, &quot;Mary Barton&quot;, was published anonymously in 1848. Gaskell&#x27;s &quot;North and South&quot; contrasts the lifestyle in the industrial north of England with the wealthier south. Even though her writing conforms to Victorian conventions, Gaskell usually frames her stories as critiques of contemporary attitudes: her early works focused on factory work in the Midlands. She always emphasised the role of women, with complex narratives and dynamic female characters. 

Anthony Trollope (1815–82) was one of the most successful, prolific, and respected English novelists of the Victorian era. Some of his best-loved works are set in the imaginary county of Barsetshire, including &quot;The Warden&quot; (1855) and &quot;Barchester Towers&quot; (1857). He also wrote perceptive novels on political, social, and gender issues, and on other topical matters, including &quot;The Way with Live Now&quot; (1875). Trollope&#x27;s novels portrayed the lives of the landowning and professional classes of early Victorian England. 

George Eliot&#x27;s (Mary Ann Evans) (1819–80) first novel &quot;Adam Bede&quot; was published in 1859. Her works, especially &quot;Middlemarch&quot; 1871–72), are important examples of literary realism, and are admired for their combination of high Victorian literary detail combined with an intellectual breadth that removes them from the narrow geographic confines they often depict.
An interest in rural matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside is seen in the novels of Thomas Hardy (1840–1928). A Victorian realist, in the tradition of George Eliot, he was also influenced both in his novels and poetry by Romanticism, especially by William Wordsworth. Charles Darwin is another important influence on Thomas Hardy. Like Charles Dickens he was also highly critical of much in Victorian society, though Hardy focused more on a declining rural society. While Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898, so that initially he gained fame as the author of such novels as, &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1874), &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; (1886), &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; (1891), and &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; (1895). He ceased writing novels following adverse criticism of this last novel. In novels such as &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; and &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; Hardy attempts to create modern works in the genre of tragedy, that are modelled on the Greek drama, especially Aeschylus and Sophocles, though in prose, not poetry, a novel not drama, and with characters of low social standing, not nobility. Another significant late 19th-century novelist is George Gissing (1857–1903) who published 23 novels between 1880 and 1903. His best known novel is &quot;New Grub Street&quot; (1891).

Important developments occurred in genre fiction in this era. Although pre-dated by John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;The King of the Golden River&quot; in 1841, the history of the modern fantasy genre is generally said to begin with George MacDonald, the influential author of &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; and &quot;Phantastes&quot; (1858). William Morris was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Wilkie Collins&#x27; epistolary novel &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (1868), is generally considered the first detective novel in the English language, while &quot;The Woman in White&quot; is regarded as one of the finest sensation novels. H. G. Wells&#x27;s (1866–1946) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895), and &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by Martians. Wells is seen, along with Frenchman Jules Verne (1828–1905), as inventing the scientific romance. He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels such as &quot;Kipps&quot; (1905) and &quot;The History of Mr Polly&quot; (1910).

==20th century==
The major novelists writing in Britain at the start of the 20th century were an Irishman James Joyce (1882–1941) and two immigrants, American Henry James (1843–1916) and Pole Joseph Conrad (1857–1924). The modernist tradition in the novel, with its emphasis &quot;towards the ever more minute and analytic exposition of mental life&quot;, begins with James and Conrad, in novels such as &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; (1903), &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; (1904) and &quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1900). Other important early modernists were Dorothy Richardson (1873–1957), whose novel &quot;Pointed Roof&quot; (1915), is one of the earliest example of the stream of consciousness technique, and D. H. Lawrence (1885–1930), who wrote with understanding about the social life of the lower and middle classes and the personal life of those who could not adapt to the social norms of his time. &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; (1913), is widely regarded as his earliest masterpiece. There followed &quot;The Rainbow&quot; (1915), though it was immediately seized by the police, and its sequel &quot;Women in Love&quot; published in 1920. Lawrence attempted to explore human emotions more deeply than his contemporaries and challenged the boundaries of the acceptable treatment of sexual issues, most notably in &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;, which was privately published in Florence in 1928. However, the unexpurgated version of this novel was not published until 1959. In 1922 Irishman James Joyce&#x27;s important modernist novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; appeared. Set during one day in Dublin in June 1904, the novel has been called &quot;a demonstration and summation of the entire movement.&quot; In it Joyce creates parallels with Homer&#x27;s epic poem the Odyssey.

Another significant modernist in the 1920 was Virginia Woolf (1882–1941), who was an influential feminist, member of the Bloomsbury Group, and a major stylistic innovator associated with the stream-of-consciousness technique. Her novels include &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; (1925), &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; (1927), &quot;&quot; (1928), and &quot;The Waves&quot; (1931). Her essay collection &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot; (1929) contains her famous dictum: &quot;A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction&quot;.
But while modernism was to become an important literary movement in the early decades of the new century, there were also many fine novelists who were not strictly modernists. These include E. M. Forster ((1879–1970), John Galsworthy ((1867–1933) (Nobel Prize in Literature, 1932), whose novels include &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, Arnold Bennett (1867–1931) author of &quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot;, and H. G. Wells (1866–1946), though Forster&#x27;s work is &quot;frequently regarded as containing both modernist and Victorian elements&quot;. E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1924), reflected challenges to imperialism, while his earlier works, such as &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1908) and &quot;Howards End&quot; (1910), examined the restrictions and hypocrisy of Edwardian society in England. The most popular British writer of the early years of the 20th century was arguably Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936), a highly versatile writer of novels, short stories and poems and to date the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature (1907).

A significant English writer in the 1930s and 1940s was George Orwell (1903–50), who is especially remembered for his satires of totalitarianism, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949) and &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (1945). Evelyn Waugh (1903–66) satirised the &quot;bright young things&quot; of the 1920s and 1930s, notably in &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; (1934) and &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; (1928), while &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1945) has a theological basis, setting out to examine the effect of divine grace on its main characters. Irishwoman and Bloomsbury Group member Elizabeth Bowen is known for her novels about the Irish Protestant gentry, such as &quot;The Death of the Heart&quot; (1938) and London during World War II bombing raids, &quot;The Heat of the Day&quot; (1948). Aldous Huxley (1894–1963) published his famous dystopia &quot;Brave New World&quot; in 1932, the same year as John Cowper Powys&#x27;s (1872–1963) &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot;. Samuel Beckett (1906–89) published his first major work, the novel &quot;Murphy&quot; in 1938. This same year Graham Greene&#x27;s (1904–91) first major novel &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; was published. Then in 1939 James Joyce published &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. In this work Joyce creates a special language to express the consciousness of a character who is dreaming.
Graham Greene was an important novelist whose works span the 1930s to the 1980s. Greene was a convert to Catholicism and his novels explore the ambivalent moral and political issues of the modern world. Notable for an ability to combine serious literary acclaim with broad popularity, his novels include, &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (1948), &quot;A Burnt-Out Case&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Human Factor&quot; (1978). Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s (1903–1966) career also continued after World War II, and in &quot;1961 he completed his most considerable work, a trilogy about the war entitled &quot;Sword of Honour&quot;. In 1947 Malcolm Lowry published &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;. One of the most influential novels of the immediate post-war period was William Cooper&#x27;s (1910–2002) naturalistic &quot;Scenes from Provincial Life&quot; (1950), which was a conscious rejection of the modernist tradition. Other novelists writing in the 1950s and later were: Anthony Powell (1905–2000) whose twelve-volume cycle of novels &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot; (1951–75), is a comic examination of movements and manners, power and passivity in English political, cultural, and military life in the mid-20th century; comic novelist Kingsley Amis is best known for his academic satire &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; (1954); Nobel Prize laureate William Golding&#x27;s allegorical novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; (1954), explores how culture created by man fails, using as an example a group of British schoolboys marooned on a deserted island. Philosopher Iris Murdoch was a prolific writer of novels that deal with such things as sexual relationships, morality, and the power of the unconscious. Her works include &quot;Under the Net&quot; (1954), &quot;The Black Prince&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Green Knight&quot; (1993). Scottish writer Muriel Spark also began publishing in the 1950s. She pushed the boundaries of realism in her novels. Her first, &quot;The Comforters&quot; (1957), concerns a woman who becomes aware that she is a character in a novel; &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1961), jumps forward at the end to reveal the fates that befell its characters. Anthony Burgess is especially remembered for his dystopian novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1962), set in the not-too-distant future, which was made into a film by Stanley Kubrick in 1971. In the entirely different genre of Gothic fantasy Mervyn Peake (1911–1968) published his highly successful Gormenghast trilogy between 1946 and 1959.

Immigrant authors played a major role in post-war literature. Doris Lessing (1919) from Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), published her first novel &quot;The Grass is Singing&quot; in 1950, after immigrating to England. She initially wrote about her African experiences. Lessing soon became a dominant presence in the English literary scene, frequently publishing right through the century, and won the Nobel prize for literature in 2007. Salman Rushdie (born 1947) is another among a number of post Second World War writers from the former British colonies who permanently settled in Britain. Rushdie achieved fame with &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; 1981, which was awarded both the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and Booker Prize, and named Booker of Bookers in 1993. His most controversial novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; (1989), was inspired in part by the life of Muhammad. V. S. Naipaul (1932–2018), born in Trinidad, wrote among other things &quot;A House for Mr. Biswas&quot; (1961) and &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; (1979). Naipaul won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Also from the West Indies George Lamming (1927–1922) is best remembered for &quot;In the Castle of the Skin&quot; (1953). Another important immigrant writer Kazuo Ishiguro (born 1954) was born in Japan, but his parents immigrated to Britain when he was six. His works include &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; {1989) and &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (2005). Ishiguro won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2017.

Scotland has in the late 20th-century produced several important novelists, including James Kelman (born 1946), who like Samuel Beckett can create humour out of the most grim situations. &quot;How Late it Was, How Late&quot; (1994), won the Booker Prize that year; A. L. Kennedy (born 1965) whose 2007 novel &quot;Day&quot; was named Book of the Year in the Costa Book Awards. In 2007 she won the Austrian State Prize for European Literature; Alasdair Gray (1934–2019) whose &quot;&quot; (1981) is a dystopian fantasy set in his home town Glasgow. Another contemporary Scot is Irvine Welsh, whose novel &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (1993), gives a brutal depiction of the lives of working class Edinburgh drug users.

Angela Carter (1940–1992) was a novelist and journalist, known for her feminist, magical realism, and picaresque works. Writing from the 1960s until the 1980s, her novels include, &quot;The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman&quot; (1972) and &quot;Nights at the Circus&quot; (1984). Margaret Drabble (born 1939) is a novelist, biographer, and critic, who has published from the 1960s until this century. Her older sister, A. S. Byatt (born 1936) is best known for &quot;Possession&quot; published in 1990.

Among popular novelists Daphne Du Maurier wrote &quot;Rebecca&quot;, a mystery novel, in 1938 and W. Somerset Maugham’s (1874–1965) &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1915), a strongly autobiographical novel, is generally agreed to be his masterpiece. In genre fiction Agatha Christie was an important writer of crime novels, short stories, and plays, best remembered for her 80 detective novels and her successful West End theatre plays. Christie&#x27;s novels include &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1934), &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1937), and &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1939). Another popular writer during the Golden Age of detective fiction was Dorothy L. Sayers, while Georgette Heyer created the historical romance genre.

==Contemporary novelists==
Martin Amis (1949 to 2023) was one of the most prominent of contemporary British novelists. His best-known novels are &quot;Money&quot; (1984) and &quot;London Fields&quot; (1989). Pat Barker (born 1943) has won many awards for her fiction. 

Novelist and screenwriter Ian McEwan (born 1948) is another of contemporary Britain&#x27;s most highly regarded writers. His works include &quot;The Cement Garden&quot; (1978) and &quot;Enduring Love&quot; (1997), which was made into a film. In 1998 McEwan won the Booker Prize with &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, while &quot;Atonement&quot; (2001) was made into an Oscar-winning film. McEwan was awarded the Jerusalem Prize in 2011. Jeanette Winterson’s (born 1959) novels explore themes of sexuality and religion, such as &quot;Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit&quot; (1985) and &quot;Sexing the Cherry&quot; (1989).

Zadie Smith&#x27;s (born 1975) Whitbread Book Award winning novel &quot;White Teeth&quot; (2000), mixes pathos and humour, focusing on the later lives of two war time friends in London. Julian Barnes (born 1946) is another successful living novelist, who won the 2011 Man Booker Prize for his book &quot;The Sense of an Ending&quot;, while three of his earlier books had been shortlisted for the Booker Prize.

Monica Ali came to prominence in 2003 with the acclaimed novel &quot;Brick Lane&quot;. A chronicler of everyday life in multicultural Britain, Ali was hailed by critics and awarded several awards for the novel including the Man Booker Prize for Fiction.

One of the more ambitious novelists to emerge in contemporary English literature is David Mitchell whose far-reaching novel &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (2004) spans from the 19th century into the future.

In the early 21st century an outstanding concern with historical fiction has been noted. Hilary Mantel (1952-2022) had success with the critically acclaimed historical novel &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; (2009).

==Survey==
In 2003 the BBC carried out a UK survey entitled &quot;The Big Read&quot; in order to find the &quot;nation&#x27;s best-loved novel&quot; of all time, with works by English novelists Tolkien, Austen, Pullman, Adams and Rowling making up the top five on the list.

<doc id="173562" wikidata="Q696236" url="?curid=173562" title="Magic Knight Rayearth">
<text>is a Japanese manga series created by CLAMP. Appearing as a serial in the manga magazine &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; from the November 1993 issue to the February 1995 issue, the chapters of &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; were collected into three bound volumes by Kodansha. They were published from July 1994 to March 1995. A sequel was serialized in the same manga magazine from the March 1995 issue to the April 1996 issue. It was published by Kodansha in three bound volumes from July 1995 to April 1996.

The series follows three eighth-grade girls who find themselves transported from modern-day Japan into a magical world, where they are tasked with rescuing a princess. &quot;Rayearth&quot; combines elements from the magical girl and mecha anime genres with parallel world fantasy. The manga was adapted into two anime series in 1994 and an original video animation (OVA) in 1997. A new anime project has been announced.

==Plot==

&quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; focuses on three eighth-grade girls: the tomboyish, headstrong but short ; the quick-tempered and no-nonsense only child ; and the intelligent and ladylike . While on a field trip to the Tokyo Tower with their respective schools, the girls find themselves drawn into another world, Cephiro. There they learn that Cephiro is influenced by one&#x27;s will and that the Pillar maintains Cephiro through prayer. The girls are then tasked with rescuing the current Pillar, Princess Emeraude, from her abductor, the high priest and antagonist Zagato, after which they will be returned to Tokyo.

Guided by the creature Mokona on their quest, the girls discover their respective element-based magic and awaken the three , creatures who can take the form of giant robots that the girls must pilot. As the girls progress on their journey, they overcome their differences, learning how to work together and accept each other as friends. After the girls find Zagato, they fight and are able to destroy him. After this, they finally reach where Emeraude is imprisoned, but the three learn that she had fallen in love with Zagato, which had hindered her ability to pray solely for Cephiro&#x27;s well-being. Feeling responsible for her actions, she had imprisoned herself, and eventually summoned the Magic Knights to kill her, as no one from Cephiro could harm the Pillar. Her dark side then takes over, seeking to destroy the Magic Knights for killing her love. After a short defensive fight against Princess Emeraude, the Magic Knights have no choice but to kill her. They then find themselves transported back to Tokyo.

The second part of the series deals with the complications caused by Princess Emeraude&#x27;s death. Set a year later, it opens with the three protagonists struggling with their guilt and despair over their role in her death. Meeting again at Tokyo Tower, they find themselves transported mysteriously to Cephiro again, and discover that only a single piece of Cephiro remains, which holds a castle where the survivors gather to take refuge. With the Pillar gone, Cephiro is, for the most part, defenseless, and the girls are saddened to learn that a new Pillar must be chosen by the Pillar system before the whole planet is destroyed. Not only that, three warring planets have begun their attempts to conquer the Pillar-less Cephiro: Autozam, a technologically advanced world which intends to use the Pillar system to remove the pollution in its air; Fahren, whose childish ruler Lady Aska plans to use it to turn Cephiro into a world of her whims; and Chizeta, an overpopulated world whose sibling rulers Tatra and Tarta plan to use it to make Cephiro into a colony.

As the Magic Knights help defend the castle, they each agree that the fate of the planet should not be the responsibility of only one person which, like Princess Emeraude, effectively prevents that person from ever being able to live and love freely. What&#x27;s more, there is a mostly unspoken risk that when a new Pillar is chosen, something may eventually hinder them from praying solely for Cephiro&#x27;s well-being, cause them to summon new Magic Knights to kill them, and bring Cephiro to near-destruction again until a new Pillar is chosen, causing the cycle of events to continue endlessly. As such, Lantis, a powerful magic swordsman and Zagato&#x27;s younger brother, wishes to end the Pillar system for those reasons.

Eventually, Mokona narrows the candidates down to two: Hikaru and the sickly Eagle Vision of Autozam, who is friends with Lantis and, as such, wishes to end the Pillar system for him with his eternal sleep. As the two undergo the test to become the new Pillar in a recreation of Tokyo, Mokona reveals itself to be the creator of Cephiro and its laws, both of which it had created after sadly witnessing the violence and destructive nature of the people on its earlier creation, Earth. It was responsible for bringing the three girls back to Cephiro. In the end, Hikaru becomes the new Pillar of Cephiro, and brings Eagle Vision back to Cephiro from the Tokyo recreation with the help of Fuu and Umi, against Mokona&#x27;s insistence that only one may return. Hikaru then rejects the Pillar system, decreeing once and for all the fate of the planet should not be the responsibility of one person. Mokona accepts their decision and leaves with the three Mashin. The manga concludes with the three girls&#x27; returning to a new Cephiro to visit their loved ones, as they work with the rulers of the other planets to solve their planets&#x27; problems, and contemplate Mokona&#x27;s wish to allow the three protagonists to bring change to Cephiro.

==Development==
During the celebration of the publication of the &quot;Soryuden&quot; novels, which Clamp had illustrated, the group was asked by Hideki Yamaguchi, editor for the Japanese &quot;shōjo&quot; (targeted towards girls) manga magazine &quot;Nakayoshi&quot;, to do a series for the magazine. The editor-in-chief wanted a story that could appeal to elementary readers and older, while Clamp wished to bring in younger fans. Without direction from the editors, the group decided on a series combining robots, as they were fond of robot anime; role-playing games (RPGs), which saw popularity in Japan at the time; and fantasy, to counterbalance the robots, which they thought alone would be off-putting to their target audience. According to Ohkawa, the magazine&#x27;s success with the magical girl manga &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; (1991–97) made it possible for the group to pitch a serial with robots to its editors.

A friend of Clamp, illustrator Takeshi Okazaki, created the &quot;Rayearth&quot; part of the title, while Ohkawa thought of the rest. At that point, Clamp had completed a &quot;basic&quot; idea of the plot. For the names of the characters, they drew on car names, feeling that they would be interesting and memorable for children, who might otherwise have difficulty learning the names of characters in katakana. The inclusion of giant robots gave the artists some difficulty, as the massive scale of the robots made it impossible to depict the characters and robots in the same frame. The artists also omitted the cockpit of the robots, to show their faces instead. Greatly anticipating the ending to the first part of the series, Clamp found the protagonists&#x27; initial adventures in Cephiro &quot;really easy&quot; to create. Ohkawa noted that, had their target audience been older or male, they would have considered stopping the series with the conclusion of part one. The second part, however, proved difficult for the group to create, as they felt as if they had &quot;written [them]selves into a corner&quot;.

&quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; explores &quot;fate, grim destiny, and sacrifice,&quot; as do many of Clamp&#x27;s works. According to Ohkawa, who believes in choosing one&#x27;s fate, humanity&#x27;s fate is caused by one&#x27;s actions; Cephiro is merely an exaggeration of Earth.

==Media==
===Manga===
Written and illustrated by Clamp, &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; appeared as a serial in the Japanese magazine &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; from November 1993 to February 1995. Kodansha collected the chapters in three &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. The first was published on July 22, 1994; the last was released on March 6, 1995. The sequel also appeared in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; from March 1995 to April 1996.

In 1997, Tokyopop licensed &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; for an English-language translation in North America, and serialized it in its manga magazine &quot;MixxZine&quot;. The English version of the manga was at first issued in a flipped left to right format, but was re-released in the original right to left format in later editions. The English version of the manga also at first continued the volume numbering through the two series, such that &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth II&quot; volumes #1–3 were numbered as volumes &quot;#4–6&quot; (i.e., the 2000/2001 release of &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; volume 4 has the same content as the 2003/2004 re-release&#x27;s &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth II&quot; volume 1).

It would appear that Tokyopop has lost their license for the series, as Dark Horse Comics announced at their San Diego Comic-Con 2009 panel that they would be publishing the series in a new omnibus edition in honor of Clamp&#x27;s 20th anniversary. Dark Horse published the omnibus editions from July 6, 2011, to April 12, 2012.

After Dark Horse Comics&#x27; license expired, Kodansha Comics licensed it and released the series digitally and in two hardcover box sets containing three volumes each in honor of the manga&#x27;s 25th anniversary from November 26, 2019, to December 29, 2020. At Anime NYC 2022, Kodansha USA announced that they would release a paperback edition, with the first volume released on December 12, 2023.

The series is also licensed in French by Pika Édition and in Spanish by Planeta DeAgostini and later by Norma Editorial.

===Anime===
The anime series aired first on Yomiuri Television and other NNS stations in Japan on October 17, 1994, and ended on November 27, 1995. It was directed by Toshihiro Hirano and co-produced by YTV and Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now TMS Entertainment). The anime had 2 seasons, lasting 49 episodes altogether.

The TV series was licensed in the U.S. twice, first by The Ocean Group, which was supposed to air on Fox Kids in a test pilot run in the 1990s, and second by Media Blasters and was dubbed by Bang Zoom! Entertainment from 1999 to 2000.

The anime series was also aired on the Philippine television network ABS-CBN in 1996, dubbed in Tagalog and airing every Sunday at 9:00 am for the first season and 10:30 am for the second season in 1997. It was popular with Filipino female children and became one of the Philippines&#x27; highest-rated anime series of the 20th century, helping to revitalize Filipino interest in anime. It was later aired on GMA Network on November 26, 2001, but on a weekday basis and with a Tagalog dub produced by Telesuccess Productions.

It was released on both VHS and DVD. Discotek Media re-released the series on DVD and Blu-ray on January 31, 2017. Anime Limited announced that they had acquired the series for release in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

A new anime project was announced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the anime series on July 2, 2024.

===OVA===
A three-part OVA was released in Japan a few years after the end of the manga and the TV series (July 25, September 26, and December 10, 1997). The OVA was named simply &quot;Rayearth&quot;, and its story was quite different from the original. The characters are all the same, but the relationships, places and events changed radically.

In the OVA, Hikaru, Umi and Fuu are already friends who go to the same school and will soon be leaving for high school. Suddenly, a strange fairy (which turns out to be Mokona, the creature from the original series) appears in front of them. At the same time, strange monsters and wizards start to appear in the city of Tokyo. One of them is Clef, who tries to guide the three girls in order to let them become the Magic Knights, awaken their &quot;Mashin&quot; and fight against the evil wizards from Cephiro, who are trying to invade the human world. In this version, Ferio, who is a sorcerer under Princess Emeraude&#x27;s command, is not her brother. Eagle Vision fills that role instead, as well as being the main antagonist after he tricked Zagato to commit suicide in order to bring upon a false balance to Cephiro. His ties to Autozam are non-existent in this version, as he is a citizen of Cephiro from the start. He would put a spell on Emeraude to convince her that Zagato is still alive, so that the sorcerers of Cephiro can continue to exist on Earth as the two worlds would soon merge and each sorcerer would battle against the Magic Knights. Lantis is also introduced right away as being an ally to the Magic Knights and against Eagle&#x27;s plans. The only other characters that are in the OVA are Ascot and Alcyone, with none of the other characters are featured.

The OVA is licensed in the U.S. by Manga Entertainment, who opted to use a different New York-based voice cast for its English release, which was produced by Skypilot Entertainment.

===Theme songs===
; Opening themes

Three opening themes were used in the series and one in the OVA &quot;Rayearth&quot;:

Magic Knight Rayearth:
* Episodes 1–20: by Naomi Tamura

Magic Knight Rayearth 2:
* Episodes 1–22: by 
* Episodes 23–29: by Naomi Tamura

Media Blasters&#x27; early English DVD release used &quot;Still Embracing Light and Darkness&quot; as the opening for &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth 2&quot; episodes 1–22, due to licensing issues. The original openings from episodes 1–22 were included as an extra on the early DVDs, and was only in Japanese, however this isn&#x27;t the case with the remastered sets, in which the dubbed openings were removed, meaning all three openings are left intact.

;Ending themes

Three ending themes were used:

Magic Knight Rayearth:
* Episodes 1–20: by 

Magic Knight Rayearth 2:
* Episodes 1–22: by 
* Episodes 23–29: by Keiko Yoshinari

Media Blasters&#x27; early English DVD release used &quot;Lullaby ~ Yasashiku Dakasete ~&quot; as the ending for &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth 2&quot; episodes 23–29, due to licensing issues. The original ending from episodes 23-29 was included as an extra on the early DVDs, and was only in Japanese, this again was eventually rectified in the remastered sets, in which, like the openings the dubbed endings were removed meaning all three endings were left intact.

In the early English releases of the TV series, Sandy Fox sang both the available opening and ending themes in the English dubbed version.

Rayearth:
* OVA: &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; by Naomi Tamura

<text>The Golden Gloves of America is an organization that promotes annual competitions of amateur boxing in the United States, in which winners are awarded a belt and a ring, and the title of national champion. The organization currently owns 30 franchises. Hundreds of administrators, coaches, trainers and counselors participate, involving gyms and programs in local and regional tournaments throughout the United States and in a National Tournament of Champions each year. The Golden Gloves is a term used to refer to the National Golden Gloves competition, but can also represent several other amateur tournaments, including regional and state tournaments, such as the Chicago Golden Gloves, and the New York Golden Gloves, and the Rocky Mountain Golden Gloves.

==History==
Arch Ward, sports editor of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, came up with the idea of a citywide, Chicago amateur boxing tournament in 1923, and gained sponsorship from the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1927. An annual tournament was held between Chicago and New York. In later years the idea was taken up by other cities, and a national tournament was held. Along with the New York Golden Gloves, the Chicago tournament was viewed as one of the two elite Golden Gloves Championships in the United States. Winners from selected states and regions headed to Chicago to meet in the Chicago Golden Gloves, while winners from other sections of the U.S. faced each other in the New York Golden Gloves tournaments. Champions from the Chicago tournament went on to face champions from the New York tournament in the Intercity Golden Gloves tournament, and thus the Intercity Golden Gloves served as the National Tournament of Champions held in the Square Garden Chicago and Chicago Stadium. The Intercity Golden Gloves tournament ran from 1928 to 1961, with the event being held at famed venues including the Chicago Coliseum.

The National Golden Gloves contest began in 1962 and continues to be the most highly regarded amateur boxing tournament in the United States. It is sponsored and controlled by the Golden Gloves Association of America, Inc. Winners from 32 regional Golden Gloves competitions, coming up in regional teams of all weight classes, compete in the national competition, called the Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions. This is held once a year, and a new tournament site is selected annually. The U.S. Golden Gloves program is currently organized on a territorial basis to give all sections of the country representation. All tournaments are planned, promoted and directed by the Golden Gloves Charities and within the limits of the amateur boxing code. Many amateur Golden Gloves participants went on to become professional boxers, including Joe Louis, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Barney Ross and Iran Barkley.

The Golden Gloves are open to all athletes aged 19–40. Citizens and non-citizens alike may compete in the tournament series. There is also a Silver Gloves tournament, for boxers aged 10 to 15.

==Hierarchy==
To compete nationally, a contender must pass through the following levels:
*Sub-Franchise (Local/State) Golden Gloves
**Franchise (Regional) Golden Gloves
***National Golden Gloves

Golden Gloves amateur competition began in 1923 prior to the formation of Golden Gloves of America as a corporation. No unification had been undertook for a long time, as part of a tradition, different states historically had various weight class margins (171 to 178 for light heavyweight upper limit, 200 to 201 for heavyweight limit).

==Around the world==
Other countries have similar amateur boxing awards, such as Mexico&#x27;s &quot;Guantes De Oro&quot; (literally &quot;Gloves of Gold&quot; in Spanish).

==Diamond Belt==
In the past, certain amateur tournaments would award the victor with a Diamond Belt as recognition of their amateur championship status. These tournaments were sponsored by various organizations and newspapers in the United States, with &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; being one of the more notable. Notable Diamond Belt winners include George Foreman, Bobby Chacon, Jimmy McCarter, Logan McElroy, and Lou Brooks.Steven Conway

==BC Golden Gloves==

The annual Golden Gloves tournament in British Columbia, Canada, has been a regular event since 1939.
The first BC Golden Gloves champions were Alan Dunn, Bob Hickey, Travis Lepine, Eric Burnell, Henry Devine, Kenny Lindsay, Phil Vickery and Wayne Morris.

==Regional and special tournaments==
From time to time, there have been special tournaments or regional Golden Gloves tournaments. One that operated from 1954 to the early Sixties was the Vancouver Island Golden Gloves. The first Vancouver Island Golden Boy was Victoria&#x27;s Bert Wilkinson in 1954. Some of the history was documented in various issues of the &quot;Vancouver Island Boxing News&quot; in 1983, and the &quot;BC Amateur Boxing News&quot; between November 1983 and January 1986. A poster of the 1954 tournament and a photo of Bert Wilkinson were recently used in a video for the induction ceremony of the Greater Victoria Hall of Fame.

<doc id="173575" wikidata="Q685629" url="?curid=173575" title="Birdwatching">
<text>Birdwatching, or birding, is the observing of birds, either as a recreational activity or as a form of citizen science. A birdwatcher may observe by using their naked eye, by using a visual enhancement device such as binoculars or a telescope, by listening for bird sounds, watching public webcams, or by viewing smart bird feeder cameras.

Most birdwatchers pursue this activity for recreational or social reasons, unlike ornithologists, who engage in the study of birds using formal scientific methods.

==Birding, birdwatching, and twitching==
The first recorded use of the term &quot;birdwatcher&quot; was in 1712 by William Oldsworth. The term &quot;birding&quot; was also used for the practice of &quot;fowling&quot; or hunting with firearms as in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (1602): &quot;She laments sir... her husband goes this morning a-birding.&quot; The terms &quot;birding&quot; and &quot;birdwatching&quot; are today used by some interchangeably, although some participants prefer &quot;birding&quot;, partly because it includes the auditory aspects of enjoying birds.

In North America, many birders differentiate themselves from birdwatchers, and the term &quot;birder&quot; is unfamiliar to most lay people. At the most basic level, the distinction is perceived as one of dedication or intensity, though this is a subjective differentiation. Generally, self-described birders perceive themselves to be more versed in minutiae such as identification (aural and visual), molt, distribution, migration timing, and habitat usage. Whereas these dedicated &quot;birders&quot; may often travel specifically in search of birds, &quot;birdwatchers&quot; have been described by some enthusiasts as having a more limited scope, perhaps not venturing far from their own yards or local parks to view birds. Indeed, in 1969 a &quot;Birding Glossary&quot; appeared in &quot;Birding&quot; magazine which gave the following definitions:
&quot;Twitching&quot; is a British term used to mean &quot;the pursuit of a previously located rare bird.&quot; In North America, it is more often called &quot;chasing&quot;. The term &quot;twitcher&quot;, sometimes misapplied as a synonym for &quot;birder&quot;, is reserved for those who travel long distances to see a rare bird that would then be &quot;ticked&quot;, or counted on a list. The term originated in the 1950s, when it was used to describe the nervous behaviour of Howard Medhurst, a British birdwatcher. Earlier terms for those who chased rarities were &quot;pot-hunter&quot;, &quot;tally-hunter&quot;, or &quot;tick-hunter&quot;. The main goal of twitching is often to accumulate species on one&#x27;s lists. Some birders engage in competition to accumulate the longest species list. The act of the pursuit itself is referred to as a &quot;twitch&quot; or a &quot;chase&quot;. A rare bird that stays long enough for people to see it is &quot;twitchable&quot; or &quot;chaseable&quot;.

Twitching is highly developed in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland, Finland and Sweden. The size of these countries makes it possible to travel throughout them quickly and with relative ease. The most popular twitches in the UK have drawn large crowds; for example, approximately 2,500 people travelled to Kent, to view a golden-winged warbler (&quot;Vermivora chrysoptera&quot;), which is native to North America. Twitchers have developed their own vocabulary. For example, a twitcher who fails to see a rare bird has &quot;dipped out&quot;; if other twitchers do see the bird, they may feel &quot;gripped off&quot;. &quot;Suppression&quot; is the act of concealing news of a rare bird from other twitchers.

Many birders maintain a &quot;life list&quot;, that is, a list of all of the species they have seen in their life, usually with details about the sighting such as date and location. The American Birding Association has specific rules about how a bird species may be documented and recorded in such a list if it is submitted to the ABA; however, the criteria for the personal recording of these lists are very subjective. Some birders &quot;count&quot; species they have identified audibly, while others only record species that they have identified visually. Some also maintain a &quot;country list&quot;, &quot;state list&quot;, &quot;county list&quot;, &quot;yard list&quot;, &quot;year list&quot;, or any combination of these.

==The history of birdwatching==

The early interest in observing birds for their aesthetic rather than utilitarian (mainly food) value is traced to the late 18th century in the works of Gilbert White, Thomas Bewick, George Montagu and John Clare. The study of birds, and of natural history in general, became increasingly prevalent in Britain during the Victorian Era, often associated with collection, eggs and later skins being the artifacts of interest. Wealthy collectors made use of their contacts in the colonies to obtain specimens from around the world. It was only in the late 19th century that the call for bird protection led to the rising popularity of observations of living birds. The Audubon Society was started to protect birds from the growing trade in feathers in the United States while the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds began in Britain.

The phrase &quot;bird watching&quot; appeared for the first time as the title of the book &quot;Bird Watching&quot; by Edmund Selous in 1901. In North America, the identification of birds, once thought possible only by shooting, was made possible by the emergence of optics and field identification guides. The earliest field guide in the US was &quot;Birds through an Opera Glass&quot; (1889) by Florence Bailey.

Birding in North America was focused in the early and mid-20th century in the eastern seaboard region, and was influenced by the works of Ludlow Griscom and later Roger Tory Peterson. &quot;Bird Neighbors&quot; (1897) by Neltje Blanchan, an early birding book, sold over 250,000 copies. It was illustrated with color photographs of stuffed birds.

The organization and networking of those interested in birds began through organizations like the Audubon Society, which was against the killing of birds, and the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union (AOU). The availability of first the bicycle and then the car increased the mobility of birdwatchers and this made new locations accessible. Networks of birdwatchers in the UK began to form in the late 1930s under the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). The BTO saw the potential to produce scientific results through the networks, unlike the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) which like the Audubon Society originated from the bird protection movement.

Like the AOU in North America, the BOU had a focus mainly on collection-based taxonomy. The BOU changed focus to ecology and behaviour only in the 1940s. The BTO movement towards &#x27;organized birdwatching&#x27; was opposed by the RSPB, which claimed that the &#x27;scientification&#x27; of the pastime was &#x27;undesirable&#x27;. This stand was to change only in 1936 when the RSPB was taken over by Tom Harrisson and others. Harrisson was instrumental in the organization of pioneering surveys of the great crested grebe.

Increased mobility of birdwatchers ensured that books like &quot;Where to Watch Birds&quot; by John Gooders became best-sellers. By the 1960s air travel became feasible and long-distance holiday destinations opened up. By 1965, Britain&#x27;s first birding tour company, &quot;Ornitholidays&quot; had been started by Lawrence Holloway. Travelling far away also led to problems in name usage: British birds such as &quot;wheatear&quot;, &quot;heron&quot; and &quot;swallow&quot; needed adjectives to differentiate them in places where there were several related species. The falling cost of air travel made flying to remote birding destinations a possibility for a large number of people towards the 1980s. The need for global guides to birds increased, and one of the biggest resulting projects was the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot;, begun in the 1990s by Josep del Hoyo, Jordi Sargatal, David A. Christie, and ornithologist Andy Elliott.

Initially, birdwatching was largely restricted to developed countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Since the second half of the 20th century an increasing number of people in developing countries have engaged in this activity, such as in the Degua Tembien district of Ethiopia. Transnational birding has played an important role in this, as birders in developing countries usually take up the pastime under the influence of foreign cultures with a history of birding. A majority of transnational birders are middle-aged, male, affluent, and belong to the Anglophone countries or Scandinavia.

==Economic and environmental impact==

In the 20th century, most of the birding activity in North America was done on the east coast. The publication of Roger Tory Peterson&#x27;s field guide in 1934 led to the initial increase in birding. Binoculars, an essential piece of birding equipment, became more easily available after World War II, making the hobby more accessible. The practice of travelling long distances to see rare bird species was aided by the availability of cars and their associated infrastructure. Nevertheless, distance to urban centres may still affect number of birdwatchers participating in observations of rare bird species. About 4% of North Americans were interested in birding in the 1970s, and in the mid-1980s at least 11% were found to watch birds at least 20 days of the year. The number of birders was estimated at 61 million in the late 1980s. The income level of birders has been found to be well above average.

&quot;The Sibley Guide to Birds&quot;, published in 2000, had sold 500,000 copies by 2002. It was found that the number of birdwatchers rose, but there appeared to be a drop in birdwatching in the backyard.

According to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service study, birders contributed $36 billion to the US economy in 2006, and one fifth (20%) of all Americans are identified as birdwatchers. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016, over 45 million Americans consider themselves birders.

North American birders were estimated to have spent as much as US$32 billion in 2001. The spending is on the rise around the world. Kuşcenneti National Park (KNP) at Lake Manyas, a Ramsar site in Turkey, was estimated to attract birders who spent as much as US$103,320,074 annually. Guided bird tours have become a major business, with at least 127 companies offering tours worldwide. An average trip to a less-developed country costs $4,000 per person and includes about 12 participants for each of 150 trips a year. It has been suggested that this economic potential needs to be tapped for conservation.

Birdwatching tourism is considered to be one of the fastest-growing nature-based tourism sectors in the world, often involving well-educated or wealthy travelers with specific interests in the places they visit. In addition to this, birdwatching tourism is considered a niche market of nature-based tourism. Birdwatching and other niche tourism markets are good for market diversification and mitigating the impacts of seasonality in a tourism market as well as bringing economic resources to remote communities, thus diversifying their economies and contributing to biodiversity conservation. It is estimated that birdwatching ecotourism contributes $41 billion per year to the U.S. economy. The large funds generated by birdwatching ecotourism have been suggested as a replacement for tax revenue generated by bird hunting which has dropped to its lowest levels in decades.

Birding ecotourism companies are also making contributions to conservation. Birding Ecotours, which runs both international and domestic trips, donates a minimum of 10% of its net profits to bird conservation and communities it operates in. Another tour operator, Hardy Boat, has donated $200,000 to Project Puffin to conserve puffin populations off the Atlantic Coast.

One of the expectations of ecotourism is that the travels of birders to a place will contribute to the improvement of the local economy, ensuring that the environment is valued and protected. Birdwatchers contribute to conservation, helping build and disseminate environmental knowledge by participating in citizen science. However, birding can bring about an increased penetration of ecosystem services that are perceived as birdwatchers&#x27; indispensable attributes. By their presence and obstinacy, birdwatchers affect the attractiveness of the breeding migration or roosting sites for birds, flush birds, and otherwise increase the pressure on birds and their habitats (e.g., luring birds out of their hideouts and stressing them by playing their calls or exposing birds and their nests to predators). Furthermore, other impacts include disturbance to birds, the environment, local cultures and the economy. Methods to reduce negative impact and improve the value of conservation are the subject of research.

==Activities==

Many birders occupy themselves with observing local species (birding in their &quot;local patch&quot;), but may also make specific trips to observe birds in other locales. The most active times of the year for birding in temperate zones are during the spring or fall migrations when the greatest variety of birds may be seen. On these occasions, large numbers of birds travel north or south to wintering or nesting locations. Early mornings are typically better as the birds are more active and vocal making them easier to spot.

Certain locations such as a local patch of forest, wetland and coast may be favoured according to the location and season. Seawatching, or pelagic birding, is a type of birding where observers based at a coastal watch point, such as a headland, watch birds flying over the sea. This is one form of pelagic birding, though birders also seek pelagic species from seagoing vessels.

Weather plays an important role in the occurrence of rare birds. In Britain, suitable wind conditions may lead to drift migration, and an influx of birds from the east. In North America, birds caught in the tail-end of a hurricane may be blown inland.
===Monitoring===
Birders may take part in censuses of bird populations and migratory patterns which are sometimes specific to individual species. These birdwatchers may also count all birds in a given area, as in the Christmas Bird Count, or follow carefully designed study protocols. This kind of citizen science can assist in identifying environmental threats to the well-being of birds or, conversely, in assessing outcomes of environmental management initiatives intended to ensure the survival of at-risk species or to encourage the breeding of species for aesthetic or ecological reasons.

This more scientific side of the hobby is an aspect of ornithology, coordinated in the UK by the British Trust for Ornithology. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology hosts many citizen-science projects to track the number and distribution of bird species across North America. These surveys help scientists note major changes from year to year which may occur as a result of climate change, disease, predation, and other factors.

===Environmental education===

Because of their accessibility and ubiquity, birds are a useful tool for environmental education and awareness of environmental issues. Birdwatching can increase respect for nature and awareness of the fragility of ecosystems.

===Competition===

Birding as a competitive event is organized in some parts of the world. Such competitions encourage individuals or teams to accumulate large numbers of species within a specified time or area with special rules. Some birdwatchers will also compete by attempting to increase their life list, national list, state list, provincial list, county list, or year list. The American Birding Association was originally started as a club for &quot;listers&quot;, but it now serves a much broader audience. Still, the ABA continues to publish an official annual report of North American list standings.

Competitive birdwatching events include:
*Big Day: teams have 24 hours to identify as many species as possible.
*Big Year: like a big day, but contestants are individuals, and need to be prepared to invest a great deal of time and money.
*Big Sit or Big Stay: birdwatchers must see birds from a circle of prescribed diameter (e.g.: 17 feet). Once birds are spotted, birdwatchers can leave the circle to confirm the identity, but new birds seen may not be counted.
*Christmas Bird Count: See as many birds as possible between December 14 and January 5.
*World Series of Birding: An annual birding competition organised by the New Jersey Audubon Society. Teams compete to identify the greatest number of bird species in a 24-hour period.
*Migration Madness: A month-long festival celebrating bird migration. Migration Madness features a Birdathon. The Birdathon is a competition at any time during May 2024. The goal is to spot as many bird species as you can.

==Networking and organization==
Prominent national and continental organizations concerned with birding include the British Trust for Ornithology and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the United Kingdom, and the American Birding Association and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in North America. Many statewide or local Audubon organizations are also active in the United States, as are many provincial and local organizations in Canada. BirdLife International is an important global alliance of bird conservation organizations. Many countries and smaller regions (states/provinces) have &quot;rarities committees&quot; to check, accept or reject reports of rare birds made by birders.

==Equipment and technology==

Equipment commonly used for birding includes binoculars, a spotting scope with tripod, a smartphone, a notepad, and one or more field guides. Hides (known as &quot;blinds&quot; in North America) or observation towers are often used to conceal the observers from birds, and/or to improve viewing conditions. Virtually all optics manufacturers offer specific binoculars for birding, and some have even geared their whole brand to birders.

===Sound equipment===
Recognition of bird vocalizations is an important part of a birder&#x27;s toolkit. Sound information can assist in the locating, watching, identification, and sometimes sexing of birds. Recent developments in audio technology have seen recording and reproduction devices shrink in both size and price, making them accessible to a greater portion of the birding community.

The non-linear nature of digital audio technology has also made selecting and accessing the required recordings much more flexible than tape-based models. It is now possible to take a recording of every bird call you are likely to encounter in a given area out into the field stored on a device that will slip into your pocket and to retrieve calls for playback and comparison in any order you choose.

As the technology continues to improve, researchers and hobby birders have started using convolutional neural networks to mine sound recordings to identify and track specific bird calls.

===Photography===
Photography has always been a part of birding, but in the past the cost of cameras with super-telephoto lenses made this a minority, often semi-professional, interest. The advent of affordable digital cameras, which can be used in conjunction with a spotting scope or binoculars (using the technique of afocal photography, referred to by the neologism &quot;digiscoping&quot; or sometimes &quot;digibinning&quot; for binoculars), have made this a much more widespread aspect of the hobby.

===Videography===
As with the arrival of affordable digital cameras, the development of more compact and affordable digital video cameras has made them more attractive and accessible to the birding community. Cross-over, non-linear digital models now exist that take high-quality stills at acceptable resolutions, as well as being able to record and play audio and video. The ability to capture and reproduce not only the visual characteristics of a bird, but also its patterns of movement and its sound, has wide applications for birders in the field.

===Portable media players===
This class of product includes devices that can play (and in some cases record) a range of digital media, typically video, audio and still image files. Many modern digital cameras, mobile phones, and camcorders can be classified as portable media players. With the ability to store and play large quantities of information, pocket-sized devices allow a full birding multimedia library to be taken into the field and mobile Internet access makes obtaining and transmitting information possible in near real time.

===Remote birdwatching===
New technologies are allowing birdwatching activities to take place over the Internet, using robotic camera installations and mobile phones set up in remote wildlife areas. Projects such as CONE allow users to observe and photograph birds over the web; similarly, robotic cameras set up in largely inhospitable areas are being used to attempt the first photographs of the rare ivory-billed woodpecker. These systems represent new technologies in the birdwatcher&#x27;s toolkit.

===Communication===
In the early 1950s, the only way of communicating new bird sightings was through the postal system and it was generally too late for the recipients to act on the information. In 1953 James Ferguson-Lees began broadcasting rare bird news on the radio in Eric Simms&#x27; &quot;Countryside&quot; program but this did not catch on. In the 1960s people began using the telephone and some people became hubs for communication. In the 1970s some cafés, such as that in Cley, Norfolk run by Nancy Gull, became centers for meeting and communication. This was replaced by telephone hotline services such as &quot;Birdline&quot; and &quot;Bird Information Service&quot;.

With the advent of the World Wide Web, birders have been using the Internet to convey information; this can be via mailing lists, forums, bulletin-boards, web-based databases and other social media. While most birding lists are geographic in scope, there are special-interest lists that cater to bird-identification, &#x27;twitchers&#x27;, seabirds and raptor enthusiasts to name but a few. Messages can range from the serious to trivial, notifying others of rarities, questioning the taxonomy or identification of a species, discussing field guides and other resources, asking for advice and guidance, or organizing groups to help save habitats.

Occasional postings are mentioned in academic journals and therefore can be a valuable resource for professional and amateur birders alike. One of the oldest, &quot;Birdchat&quot; (based in the US), probably has the most subscribers, followed by the English-language fork of &quot;Eurobirdnet&quot;, Birding-Aus from Australia, SABirdnet from South Africa and Orientalbirding.

=== Mobile applications ===
The increasing availability of mobile devices in the 2010s allowed the smartphone to become a useful tool for birding. Mobile apps can be used as replacements for physical birding field guides, such as the digital version of the &quot;Sibley Guide to Birds&quot; and the official Audubon Society app. Other apps utilize machine learning to automatically identifying birds from photographs and audio recordings, such as the Cornell Lab of Ornithology&#x27;s Merlin Bird ID application and iNaturalist.

Cornell Lab of Ornithology&#x27;s eBird database is a popular tool used by birders to document their sightings. In addition to serving as a citizen science project used by ornithologists to document trends in bird populations, it allows birders see recent reports by other birders and search by species and location. Some species, including endangered species and others likely to be disrupted by increased human activity, are designated &quot;sensitive species&quot; by eBird and have locations of sightings hidden from the general public.

===Code of conduct===
As the numbers of birdwatchers increases, there is growing concern about the impact of birdwatching on the birds and their habitat. Birdwatching etiquette is evolving in response to this concern. Some examples of birdwatching etiquette include promoting the welfare of birds and their environment, limiting use of photography, pishing and playback devices to mitigate stress caused to birds, maintaining a distance away from nests and nesting colonies, and respecting private property.

The lack of definite evidence, except arguably in the form of photographs, makes birding records difficult to prove but birdwatchers strive to build trust in their identification. One of the few major disputes was the case of the Hastings Rarities.

==Socio-psychology==

Ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen considers birdwatching to be an expression of the male hunting instinct, while Simon Baron-Cohen links it with a male tendency for &quot;systemizing&quot;. There have been suggestions that identification of birds may be a form of gaining status which has been compared with Kula valuables noted in Papua New Guinean cultures.

A study of the motivations for birdwatching in New York concluded that initial motivations were largely similar in males and females, but males who participate actively in birding are more motivated by &quot;sharing knowledge&quot; with others, and active female birders are more motivated by their &quot;intellectual&quot; interest in studying birds, and by the &quot;challenge&quot; of identifying new and rare birds and improving their skills. Another study suggested that males lean towards competitive birding, while females prefer recreational birdwatching. A study for birdwatchers in Poland found that the proportion of female birdwatchers involved in twitching has grown in recent years and that female birdwatchers were more willing to participate in observations of more common bird rarities than male birdwatchers. While the representation of women has always been low, it has been pointed out that nearly 90% of all birdwatchers in the United States are white, with only a few African Americans. Other minority groups have formed organizations to support fellow birders, such as the Gay Birders Club and Birding For All, formerly the Disabled Birders Association.

The study of birdwatching has been of interest to students of the sociology of science. People who have nature-based experiences report better well-being and lower psychological distress than those who do not, and birdwatching in particular was found to have higher gains in subjective well-being and more reduction in distress than more generic nature exposure, such as walks.

==Famous birdwatchers==
There are about 10,000 species of bird and only a small number of people have seen more than 7,000. Many birdwatchers have spent their entire lives trying to see all the bird species of the world. The first person who started this is said to be Stuart Keith.

Birders have been known to go to great lengths and some have lost their lives in the process. Phoebe Snetsinger spent her family inheritance travelling to various parts of the world while suffering from a malignant melanoma, surviving an attack and rape in New Guinea before dying in a road accident in Madagascar. She saw as many as 8,400 species. The birdwatcher David Hunt who was leading a bird tour in Corbett National Park was killed by a tiger in February 1985. In 1971, Ted Parker (who later died in an air crash in Ecuador) travelled around North America and saw 626 species. This record was beaten by Kenn Kaufman in 1973 who travelled 69,000 miles and saw 671 species and spent less than a thousand dollars.

In 2012, Tom Gullick, an Englishman who lives in Spain, became the first birdwatcher to log over 9,000 species. In 2008, two British birders, Alan Davies and Ruth Miller, gave up their jobs, sold their home and put everything they owned into a year-long global birdwatching adventure about which they a wrote a book called &quot;The Biggest Twitch&quot;. They logged their 4,341st species on 31 December 2008, in Ecuador. Noah Strycker recorded 6,042 species during 2015, overtaking Davies and Miller. In 2016, Arjan Dwarshuis became the world-record holder for most species seen during the span of one year, logging 6,852 bird species in 40 countries.

In early February 2024, Peter Kaestner became the first birder to log over 10,000 species, a record surrounded by much controversy as he was initially claimed to be beaten by Jason Mann who later conceded defeat.

Birdwatching literature, field guides, and television programs have been popularized by birders such as Pete Dunne and Bill Oddie.

==In media==
The 2011 film &quot;The Big Year&quot; depicted three birders competing in an American Birding Association Area big year, and the 2019 film &quot;Birders&quot; is a short documentary.

<doc id="173578" wikidata="Q29572" url="?curid=173578" title="Avestan">
<text>Avestan ( ) is the liturgical language of Zoroastrianism. It belongs to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family and was originally spoken during the Old Iranian period ( – 400 BCE) by the Iranians living in the eastern portion of Greater Iran. 

After Avestan became extinct, its religious texts were first transmitted orally until being collected and put into writing during the Sasanian period ( – 500 CE). The extant material falls into two groups: Old Avestan ( – 900 BCE) and Younger Avestan ( – 400 BCE). The immediate ancestor of Old Avestan was the Proto-Iranian language, a sister language to the Proto-Indo-Aryan language, with both having developed from the earlier Proto-Indo-Iranian language. As such, Old Avestan is quite close in both grammar and lexicon to Vedic Sanskrit, the oldest preserved Indo-Aryan language.
==Name==
The Avestan texts consistently use the term Arya, i.e., Iranian, for the speakers of Avestan. The same term also appears in ancient Persian and Greek sources as an umbrella term for Iranian languages. Despite this, the Avestan texts never use Arya, or any other term, specifically in reference to the language itself and its native name therefore remains unknown. 

The modern name Avestan is instead derived from the Avesta, which is the name of the written collection of the Avestan texts. This collection was created during the Sasanian period to complement the, up to then, purely oral tradition. Like Vedic, Avestan is therefore a language which is named after the text corpus in which it is used and simply means &quot;language of the Avesta&quot;. The name Avesta comes from Persian (avestâ) itself derived from Middle Persian &quot;abestāg&quot;. It might originate from a hypothetical Avestan term &quot;*upastāvaka&quot; (praise song). The language was sometimes called &quot;Zend&quot; in older works, stemming from a misunderstanding of the Zend (commentaries and interpretations of Zoroastrian scripture) as synonymous with the Avesta itself, due to both often being bundled together as &quot;Zend-Avesta&quot;.

==Classification==
Avestan is usually grouped into two variants: Old Avestan, also known as Gathic Avestan, and Young Avestan. More recently, some scholars have argued for a third intermediate stage called Middle Avestan, but this is not yet universally followed. Old Avestan is much more archaic than Young Avestan, especially in terms of its morphology. It is assumed that the two are separated by several centuries. In addition, Old Avestan differs dialectally, i.e. it is not the direct predecessor of Young Avestan but a closely related dialect. Despite these differences, Old and Young Avestan are usually interpreted as two different variants of the same language instead of two different languages.

Avestan is an Old Iranian language and, together with Old Persian, one of the two languages from that period for which longer texts are available. Other known Old Iranian languages, like Median and early Scythian, are only known from isolated words and personal names. Young Avestan shows morphological and syntactical similarities with Old Persian, which may indicate that both were spoken around the same time. On the other hand, Old Avestan is substantially more archaic than either of these and largely agrees morphologically with Vedic Sanskrit, i.e., the oldest known Indo-Aryan language. This suggests that only a limited period of time has elapsed since the two separated from their common Indo-Iranian ancestor.

Scholars traditionally classify Iranian languages as Eastern or Western according to certain grammatical features, and within this framework Avestan is sometimes classified as Eastern Old Iranian. However, as for instance Sims-Williams and Schmitt have pointed out, the east–west distinction is of limited meaning for Avestan, as the linguistic developments that later distinguish Eastern from Western Iranian had not yet occurred. Due to some shared developments with Median, Scholars like Skjaervo and Windfuhr have classified Avestan as a Central Iranian language.

==History==
===Native Avestan===

The Avestan language is only known from the Avesta and otherwise unattested. As a result, there is no external evidence on which to base the time frame during which the Avestan language was natively spoken and all attempts have to rely on internal evidence. Such attempts were often linked to the life of Zarathustra, being the central figure of Zoroastrianism. Zarathustra was traditionally based in the 6th century BC meaning that Old Avestan would have been spoken during the early Achaemenid period. Given that a substantial time must have passed between Old Avestan and Young Avestan, the latter would have been spoken somewhere during the Hellenistic or the Parthian period of Iranian history.

However, more recent scholarship has increasingly shifted to an earlier dating. The literature presents a number of reasons for this shift, based on both the Old Avestan and the Young Avestan material. As regards Old Avestan, the Gathas show strong linguistic and cultural similarities with the Rigveda, which in turn is assumed to represent the second half of the second millennium BC. As regards Young Avestan, texts like the Yashts and the Vendidad are situated in the eastern parts of Greater Iran and lack any discernible Persian or Median influence from Western Iran. This is interpreted such that the bulk of this material, which has been produced several centuries after Zarathustra, must still predate the sixth century BC. As a result, more recent scholarship often assumes that the major parts of the Young Avestan texts mainly reflect the first half of the first millennia BC, whereas the Old Avestan texts of Zarathustra may have been composed around 1000 BC or even as early as 1500 BC.

It is not known at what point Avestan ceased to be a spoken language. Even the Young Avestan texts are still quite archaic and show no signs of evolving into a hypothetical Middle Iranian stage of development. In addition, none of the known Middle Iranian languages are the successor of Avestan. The Zend, i.e., the Middle Persian commentaries of the Avesta show that Avestan was no longer fully understood by the Zoroastrian commentators, indicating that it was no longer a living language by the late Sasanian period.

===Geographical distribution===
There are no historical sources that connect Avestan or its native speakers with any specific region. In addition, the Old Avestan texts do not mention any places names that can be identified. On the other hand, the Younger Avestan texts contain a substantial number of geographical references that are known from later sources and therefore allow to delineate the geographical horizon that was known and important to the speakers of Younger Avestan. It is nowadays widely accepted that these place names are situated in the eastern parts of Greater Iran corresponding to the entirety of present-day Afghanistan and Tajikistan as well as parts of Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Avestan is therefore assumed to have been spoken somewhere within this large region, although its precise location cannot be further specified. 

Due to this geographical uncertainty, as well as the lack of any dateable historical events within the texts themselves, linking any given archeological culture with the speakers of Avestan has remained difficult. Among possible candidates, the Yaz culture has been named as likely. This is due to the fact that it is connected with the southward spread of steppe-derived Iranic groups, the presence of farming practices consisted with the Young Avestan society and the lack of burial sites, indicating the Zoroastrian practice of open air excarnation.

===Liturgical Avestan===
Both Old and Young Avestan texts are assumed to have been composed by their respective native speakers and were possibly updated and revised for an extended period of time. At two different times, however, they became fixed, purely liturgical, languages and were transmitted by an oral tradition. Scholars like Kellens, Skjærvø and Hoffman have identified a number of distinct stages of this transmission and how they changed the Avestan during its use as the sacred language of Zoroastrianism.

In the first stage, Old Avestan would have become the liturgical language of the early Zoroastrian community as described in the Young Avestan texts. Karl Hoffmann for instance identifies changes introduced due to slow chanting, the insertion of Young Avestan phonetic features into the material, attempts at standardizations as well as other editorial changes. The Young Avestan texts, however, were still produced, recomposed, and handed down during this time in a fluid oral tradition.

In the next stage, the Young Avestan texts crystallized as well meaning that both the Young and Old Avestan texts became the fixed, liturgical literature of non-Avestan Zoroastrian communities. The transmission of this literature largely took place in Western Iran as evidenced by alterations introduced by native Persian speakers. In addition, different scholars have tried to identify other dialects that may have impacted the pronunciation of certain Avestan features during the transmission, possibly before they reached Persia. Some Young Avestan texts, like the Vendidad, show ungrammatical features and may have been partly recomposed by non-Avestan speakers. 

The purely oral transmission came to an end during the 5th or 6th century CE, when the Avestan corpus was committed to written form. This was achieved through the creation of the Avestan alphabet resulting in the Sasanian Avesta. Despite this, the post Sasanian written transmission saw a further deterioration of the Avestan texts. A large portion of the literature was lost after the 10th century BCE and the surviving texts show signs of incorrect pronunciations and copying errors.

Many phonetic features cannot be ascribed with certainty to a particular stage since there may be more than one possibility. Every phonetic form that can be ascribed to the Sasanian archetype on the basis of critical assessment of the manuscript evidence must have gone through the stages mentioned above so that &quot;Old Avestan&quot; and &quot;Young Avestan&quot; really mean no more than &quot;Old Avestan and Young Avestan of the Sasanian period&quot;.

==Alphabet==
The script used for writing Avestan developed during the 3rd or 4th century AD. By then the language had been extinct for many centuries, and remained in use only as a liturgical language of the Avesta canon. As is still the case today, the liturgies were memorized by the priesthood and recited by rote.

The script devised to render Avestan was natively known as &quot;Din dabireh&quot; &quot;religion writing&quot;. It has 53 distinct characters and is written right-to-left. Among the 53 characters are about 30 letters that are – through the addition of various loops and flourishes – variations of the 13 graphemes of the cursive Pahlavi script (i.e. &quot;Book&quot; Pahlavi) that is known from the post-Sasanian texts of Zoroastrian tradition. These symbols, like those of all the Pahlavi scripts, are in turn based on Aramaic script symbols. Avestan also incorporates several letters from other writing systems, most notably the vowels, which are mostly derived from Greek minuscules. A few letters were free inventions, as were also the symbols used for punctuation. Also, the Avestan alphabet has one letter that has no corresponding sound in the Avestan language; the character for (a sound that Avestan does not have) was added to write Pazend texts.

The Avestan script is alphabetic, and the large number of letters suggests that its design was due to the need to render the orally recited texts with high phonetic precision. The correct enunciation of the liturgies was (and still is) considered necessary for the prayers to be effective.

The Zoroastrians of India, who represent one of the largest surviving Zoroastrian communities worldwide, also transcribe Avestan in Brahmi-based scripts. This is a relatively recent development first seen in the texts of Neryosang Dhaval and other Parsi Sanskritist theologians of that era, which are roughly contemporary with the oldest surviving manuscripts in Avestan script. Today, Avestan is most commonly typeset in the Gujarati script (Gujarati being the traditional language of the Indian Zoroastrians). Some Avestan letters with no corresponding symbol are synthesized with additional diacritical marks, for example, the in &quot;zaraθuštra&quot; is written with &quot;j&quot; with a dot below.

==Phonology==

Avestan has retained voiced sibilants, and has fricative rather than aspirate series. There are various conventions for transliteration of the Avestan alphabet, the one adopted for this article being:

Vowels:
:a ā ə ə̄ e ē o ō å ą i ī u ū
Consonants:
:k g γ x xʷ č ǰ t d δ θ t̰ p b β f
:ŋ ŋʷ ṇ ń n m y w r s z š ṣ̌ ž h

The glides &quot;y&quot; and &quot;w&quot; are often transcribed as &lt;&quot;ii&quot;&gt; and &lt;&quot;uu&quot;&gt;. The letter transcribed &lt;&quot;t̰&quot;&gt; indicates an allophone of with no audible release at the end of a word and before certain obstruents.

===Consonants===
According to Beekes, and are allophones of and respectively (in Old Avestan).

<doc id="173579" wikidata="Q337658" url="?curid=173579" title="Christopher McQuarrie">
<text>Christopher McQuarrie (born October 25, 1968) is an American screenwriter, film director, and producer. He received the BAFTA Award, Independent Spirit Award, and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the neo-noir mystery film &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995). He made his directorial debut with the crime thriller film &quot;The Way of the Gun&quot; (2000). 

McQuarrie is a frequent collaborator with Tom Cruise, having written and directed the action films &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; (2012), as well as four installments of the : &quot;&quot; (2015), &quot;&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2023), and the upcoming &quot;&quot; (2025). He was also a part of the writing and/or producing team on the Cruise films &quot;Valkyrie&quot; (2008), &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot; (2014), &quot;Jack Reacher: Never Go Back&quot; (2016), &quot;The Mummy&quot; (2017), and &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; (2022), the last of which received Academy Award nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture.

==Early life==
McQuarrie was born in Princeton, New Jersey. After graduating from West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South in 1986, he worked as an assistant at Christ Church Grammar School in Perth, Western Australia, recalling in 2013, “I was offered an Interim program ... I picked a place out of a hat and ended up at Christ Church Grammar School. I lived at the school and worked at the boarding school, though I did very little work&quot;. Fired after nine months, &quot;I hitchhiked for three months, came home, knocked around for about a month and then immediately started working for this detective agency... [It] was actually a glorified security-guard position. I think in the four years I worked there I did about six investigations.&quot;

==Career==
McQuarrie&#x27;s first feature film was the 1993 thriller &quot;Public Access&quot;, directed by Bryan Singer. It won the Critics Award at the Deauville American Film Festival and shared the Sundance Film Festival&#x27;s Grand Jury Prize. It was not released theatrically in the United States. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it received an approval rating of 58%.

McQuarrie wrote &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995), for which he received Best Screenplay awards from the British and American Academy Awards, as well as from &quot;Premiere Magazine&quot;, the Texas Board of Review, and the Chicago Critics, as well as the Edgar Award and Independent Spirit Award. It was later included on the &quot;New York Times&quot; list of the 1000 greatest films ever made, and the character Verbal Kint was included on AFI&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest Heroes and Villains of all time. In 2006, the Writers Guild of America voted &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; #35 on their list of 101 Greatest Screenplays. In his third collaboration with Singer, McQuarrie did an extensive rewrite on &quot;X-Men&quot;, but ultimately removed his name from the project.

In 2000, McQuarrie made his directorial debut with &quot;The Way of the Gun&quot;, a modern-day Western for which he also wrote the script. It starred Benicio del Toro, Ryan Phillippe, Taye Diggs, and James Caan. The film, budgeted at US$8.5 million, received mixed reviews and grossed US$13 million worldwide.

Eight years later, McQuarrie co-wrote (with Nathan Alexander) and co-produced &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, which opened on December 25, 2008, and is based on the real-life July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. While researching the screenplay, the writers had access to members of the Stauffenberg family; consulted a book written by Fabian von Schlabrendorff, a conspirator who survived; and spoke with Hitler&#x27;s surviving bodyguard. The film, starring Tom Cruise and directed by Bryan Singer, received the BMI Film Music Award and the Bambi Award for Courage. In 2009, McQuarrie was hired to pen the script for the then-untitled &quot;The Wolverine&quot;.

McQuarrie co-wrote the 2010 film &quot;The Tourist&quot; with Julian Fellowes, Jeffrey Nachmanoff and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. It starred Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie and grossed US$278 million worldwide. It received three Golden Globe Award nominations and several other awards, among them the Redbox Movie Award for the most rented drama of 2011. McQuarrie then provided uncredited rewrites on the 2011 action spy film &quot;&quot; during the film&#x27;s production.

In 2011, McQuarrie directed his second feature, &quot;Jack Reacher&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;One Shot&quot;, the ninth in the series of 21 Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child. Filming began in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area on October 3, 2011, and continued through the end of January 2012. The movie was released in December 2012 by Paramount Pictures. In 2012, McQuarrie stepped in to rewrite the script for &quot;World War Z&quot; after Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof left the film.

2013 saw the release of McQuarrie&#x27;s fourth collaboration with Singer, &quot;Jack the Giant Slayer&quot;, co-written by McQuarrie. Critical reviews were mixed, and it was a box office failure, grossing only US$198 million against an estimated US$240 million budget (excluding promotion). McQuarrie co-wrote the 2014 science fiction action thriller &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot; with Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, based on the Japanese novel &quot;All You Need Is Kill&quot;. While the film underperformed at the box office on its opening weekend, earning only US$28.8 million, it received strong reviews and became a word-of-mouth hit, grossing just over US$100 million at the domestic box office.

McQuarrie completed his third feature as director in 2015. &quot;&quot;, the fifth entry in the , which he co-wrote with Drew Pearce. It received strong reviews, grossed over US$195 million at the North American box office, and won a Golden Tomato for Best Action-Adventure Movie of 2015.
By October 2015, McQuarrie completed a rewrite of &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot; and spent two weeks &quot;tightening up the story&quot;. McQuarrie and screenwriter Dylan Kussman were commissioned by Tom Cruise to write a new script for &quot;The Mummy&quot;.

In November 2015, McQuarrie confirmed he would return to write and direct the sixth &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; film, his third directing collaboration with Tom Cruise. The film, titled &quot;&quot;, was released in the United States on July 27, 2018. It received strong reviews from critics, and grossed over $791 million worldwide, becoming the franchise&#x27;s highest-grossing title.

McQuarrie pitched a sequel to &quot;Man of Steel&quot; after working with Superman actor Henry Cavill on &quot;Fallout&quot; that would have tied into a Green Lantern movie McQuarrie also proposed, although Warner Bros. rejected both ideas. 

McQuarrie and Cruise collaborated again on &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot;, for which McQuarrie co-wrote the screenplay and produced the film.

Initially hesitant to return to the franchise, McQuarrie finalized a deal to write and direct &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; in January 2019. &quot;Dead Reckoning Part One&quot; was released on July 12, 2023, while &quot;The Final Reckoning&quot; is scheduled to be released on May 23, 2025.

===Upcoming projects===
In February 2011, McQuarrie was hired by Skydance Media to write and produce a feature film adaptation of the 1970s animated television series &quot;Star Blazers&quot; (itself an adaptation of anime &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;). In 2013, he was selected to direct the project, with Zach Dean being hired to write a new draft of the script in 2017. McQuarrie has also signed on to direct thrillers &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;, based on the 1963 novel and its 1968 film adaptation, &quot;Three to Kill&quot;, based on the novel by Jean-Patrick Manchette, and &quot;The Chameleon&quot;, based on a &quot;New Yorker&quot; article by David Grann about Frédéric Bourdin.

In August 2022, McQuarrie announced on the &quot;Light the Fuse&quot; podcast that he was developing a new project with Tom Cruise, to be co-written by Erik Jendresen, which he claimed would be &quot;gnarlier&quot; than the &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; films and described as being &quot;something we&#x27;ve talked about for a really long time. It&#x27;s way outside of what you&#x27;re used to seeing Tom do.&quot; A few days later, it was announced he and Cruise were also developing an original musical as a star vehicle for Cruise, as well as eyeing a potential project for Cruise to reprise the role of Les Grossman from &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;, though it was unknown if Grossman would receive his own film or be included in the other films.

Although the &quot;Reacher&quot; franchise has migrated to television, McQuarrie and Cruise are continuing to develop a &quot;Reacher&quot;-like thriller film.

<text>is a series of turn-based tactical role-playing simulation grand strategy wargames produced by Koei. Originating from Japan in 1985, fourteen installments of the game have been published in Japan, Taiwan, China, South Korea and North America to date. While the game&#x27;s title as it was released in English refers to the 14th century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (三國演義) by Luo Guanzhong, the title as it was released in Japan and Chinese regions refers to the 3rd century historical text &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (三國志) by Chen Shou.

== Overview ==

The series are based on the romanticized &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; novel and the historical text &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the storyline takes place during the Han dynasty in China with many warring factions that included the Shu Han, Cao Wei and Eastern Wu kingdoms. Gameplay revolves around managing numerical statistics, each representing an attribute of a city or a character. A city is described by statistics such as stored grain supplies, vulnerability to disasters such as floods and earthquakes, treasury funds, domestic affairs and populace loyalty. Characters are numerically characterized by their leadership abilities, melee prowess, intellects and loyalty, as well as special traits or even magical abilities that can be called upon whether during wartime, diplomacy or domestic affairs. Players can increase these numbers before waging war on neighbouring territories or intending diplomatic efforts.

While generally presented as a turn-based strategy game, the seventh, eighth and tenth editions offer role-playing features, allowing the player to play as a rank-and-file character instead of leading a kingdom.

Several spin-offs based on the series include the tactical action hack and slash video game series &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Tactics&quot; which is a hybrid of &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, as well as the three tactical role-playing games &quot;Sangokushi Eiketsuden&quot; (Liu Bei), &quot;Sangokushi Koumeiden&quot; (Zhuge Liang), and &quot;Sangokushi Sousouden&quot; (Cao Cao). &quot;Kessen II&quot; is a real-time tactics game on PS2.

Another spin-off is the mobile game &quot;Three Kingdoms Tactics&quot;, based on Koei Tecmo&#x27;s series. It was published by Chinese company Alibaba Group in September 2019. It has grossed worldwide , making it Alibaba&#x27;s most successful mobile game.

<doc id="173586" wikidata="Q829915" url="?curid=173586" title="Playfair cipher">
<text>The Playfair cipher or Playfair square or Wheatstone–Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digram substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but bears the name of Lord Playfair for promoting its use.

The technique encrypts pairs of letters (&quot;bigrams&quot; or &quot;digrams&quot;), instead of single letters as in the simple substitution cipher and rather more complex Vigenère cipher systems then in use. The Playfair cipher is thus significantly harder to break since the frequency analysis used for simple substitution ciphers does not work with it. The frequency analysis of bigrams is possible, but considerably more difficult. With 600 possible bigrams rather than the 26 possible monograms (single symbols, usually letters in this context), a considerably larger cipher text is required in order to be useful.

==History==

Playfair cipher was the first cipher to encrypt pairs of letters in cryptologic history. Wheatstone invented the cipher for secrecy in telegraphy, but it carries the name of his friend Lord Playfair, first Baron Playfair of St. Andrews, who promoted its use. The first recorded description of the Playfair cipher was in a document signed by Wheatstone on 26 March 1854. 

It was initially rejected by the British Foreign Office when it was developed because of its perceived complexity. Wheatstone offered to demonstrate that three out of four boys in a nearby school could learn to use it in 15 minutes, but the Under Secretary of the Foreign Office responded, &quot;That is very possible, but you could never teach it to attachés.&quot; 

It was however later used for tactical purposes by British forces in the Second Boer War and in World War I and for the same purpose by the British and Australians during World War II. This was because Playfair is reasonably fast to use and requires no special equipment - just a pencil and some paper. A typical scenario for Playfair use was to protect important but non-critical secrets during actual combat e.g. the fact that an artillery barrage of smoke shells would commence within 30 minutes to cover soldiers&#x27; advance towards the next objective. By the time enemy cryptanalysts could decode such messages hours later, such information would be useless to them because it was no longer relevant. 

During World War II, the Government of New Zealand used it for communication among New Zealand, the Chatham Islands, and the coastwatchers in the Pacific Islands. Coastwatchers established by Royal Australian Navy Intelligence also used this cipher.

== Superseded ==
Playfair is no longer used by military forces because of known insecurities and of the advent of automated encryption devices. This cipher is regarded as insecure since before World War I.

The first published solution of the Playfair cipher was described in a 19-page pamphlet by Lieutenant Joseph O. Mauborgne, published in 1914. William Friedman described it in 1942 as providing very little security.

== Description ==

The Playfair cipher uses a 5 * 5 table containing a key word or phrase. Memorization of the keyword and 4 simple rules was all that was required to create the 5 by 5 table and use the cipher.

To generate the key table, one would first fill in the spaces in the table (a modified Polybius square) with the letters of the keyword (dropping any duplicate letters), then fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the letters of the alphabet in order (usually omitting &quot;J&quot; or &quot;Q&quot; to reduce the alphabet to fit; other versions put both &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot; in the same space). The key can be written in the top rows of the table, from left to right, or in some other pattern, such as a spiral beginning in the upper-left-hand corner and ending in the center. The keyword together with the conventions for filling in the 5 by 5 table constitute the cipher key.

To encrypt a message, one would break the message into digrams (groups of 2 letters) such that, for example, &quot;HelloWorld&quot; becomes &quot;HE LL OW OR LD&quot;. These digrams will be substituted using the key table. Since encryption requires pairs of letters, messages with an odd number of characters usually append an uncommon letter, such as &quot;X&quot;, to complete the final digram. The two letters of the digram are considered opposite corners of a rectangle in the key table. To perform the substitution, apply the following 4 rules, in order, to each pair of letters in the plaintext:

#If both letters are the same (or only one letter is left), add an &quot;X&quot; after the first letter. Encrypt the new pair and continue. Some variants of Playfair use &quot;Q&quot; instead of &quot;X&quot;, but any letter, itself uncommon as a repeated pair, will do.
#If the letters appear on the same row of your table, replace them with the letters to their immediate right respectively (wrapping around to the left side of the row if a letter in the original pair was on the right side of the row).
#If the letters appear on the same column of your table, replace them with the letters immediately below respectively (wrapping around to the top side of the column if a letter in the original pair was on the bottom side of the column).
#If the letters are not on the same row or column, replace them with the letters on the same row respectively but at the other pair of corners of the rectangle defined by the original pair. The order is important – the first letter of the encrypted pair is the one that lies on the same row as the first letter of the plaintext pair.

To decrypt, use the &quot;inverse&quot; (opposite) of the two shift rules, selecting the letter to the left or upwards as appropriate. The last rule remains unchanged, as the transformation switches the selected letters of the rectangle to the opposite diagonal, and a repeat of the transformation returns the selection to its original state. The first rule can only be reversed by dropping any extra instances of the chosen insert letter — generally &quot;X&quot;s or &quot;Q&quot;s — that do not make sense in the final message when finished.

There are several minor variations of the original Playfair cipher.

== Example ==

Using &quot;playfair example&quot; as the key (assuming that I and J are interchangeable), the table becomes (omitted letters in red):

The first step of encrypting the message &quot;hide the gold in the tree stump&quot; is to convert it to the pairs of letters &quot;HI DE TH EG OL DI NT HE TR EX ES TU MP&quot; (with the null &quot;X&quot; used to separate the repeated &quot;E&quot;s). Then:

Thus the message &quot;hide the gold in the tree stump&quot; becomes &quot;BM OD ZB XD NA BE KU DM UI XM MO UV IF&quot;, which may be restructured as &quot;BMODZ BXDNA BEKUD MUIXM MOUVI F&quot; for ease of reading the cipher text.

== Clarification with picture ==
Assume one wants to encrypt the digram OR. There are five general cases:
== Cryptanalysis ==
Like most classical ciphers, the Playfair cipher can be easily cracked if there is enough text. Obtaining the key is relatively straightforward if both plaintext and ciphertext are known. When only the ciphertext is known, brute force cryptanalysis of the cipher involves searching through the key space for matches between the frequency of occurrence of digrams (pairs of letters) and the known frequency of occurrence of digrams in the assumed language of the original message.

Cryptanalysis of Playfair is similar to that of four-square and two-square ciphers, though the relative simplicity of the Playfair system makes identifying candidate plaintext strings easier. Most notably, a Playfair digraph and its reverse (e.g. AB and BA) will decrypt to the same letter pattern in the plaintext (e.g. RE and ER). In English, there are many words which contain these reversed digraphs such as REceivER and DEpartED. Identifying nearby reversed digraphs in the ciphertext and matching the pattern to a list of known plaintext words containing the pattern is an easy way to generate possible plaintext strings with which to begin constructing the key.

A different approach to tackling a Playfair cipher is the shotgun hill climbing method. This starts with a random square of letters. Then minor changes are introduced (i.e. switching letters, rows, or reflecting the entire square) to see if the candidate plaintext is more like standard plaintext than before the change (perhaps by comparing the digrams to a known frequency chart). If the new square is deemed to be an improvement, then it is adopted and then further mutated to find an even better candidate. Eventually, the plaintext or something very close is found to achieve a maximal score by whatever grading method is chosen. This is obviously beyond the range of typical human patience, but computers can adopt this algorithm to crack Playfair ciphers with a relatively small amount of text.

Another aspect of Playfair that separates it from four-square and two-square ciphers is the fact that it will never contain a double-letter digram, e.g. EE. If there are no double letter digrams in the ciphertext and the length of the message is long enough to make this statistically significant, it is very likely that the method of encryption is Playfair.

A good tutorial on reconstructing the key for a Playfair cipher can be found in chapter 7, &quot;Solution to Polygraphic Substitution Systems,&quot; of &quot;Field Manual 34-40-2&quot;, produced by the United States Army. Another cryptanalysis of a Playfair cipher can be found in Chapter XXI of Helen Fouché Gaines&#x27; &quot;Cryptanalysis / a study of ciphers and their solutions&quot;.

A detailed cryptanalysis of Playfair is undertaken in chapter 28 of Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; 1932 mystery novel &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;. In this story, a Playfair message is demonstrated to be cryptographically weak, as the detective is able to solve for the entire key making only a few guesses as to the formatting of the message (in this case, that the message starts with the name of a city and then a date). Sayers&#x27; book includes a detailed description of the mechanics of Playfair encryption, as well as a step-by-step account of manual cryptanalysis.

The German Army, Air Force and Police used the Double Playfair cipher as a medium-grade cipher in WWII, based on the British Playfair cipher they had broken early in WWI. They adapted it by introducing a second square from which the second letter of each bigram was selected, and dispensed with the keyword, placing the letters in random order. But with the German fondness for pro forma messages, they were broken at Bletchley Park. Messages were preceded by a sequential number, and numbers were spelled out. As the German numbers 1 (eins) to twelve (zwölf) contain all but eight of the letters in the Double Playfair squares, pro forma traffic was relatively easy to break (Smith, page 74-75)

== Use in modern crosswords ==
Advanced thematic cryptic crosswords like &quot;The Listener&quot; Crossword (published in the Saturday edition of the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot;) occasionally incorporate Playfair ciphers. Normally between four and six answers have to be entered into the grid in code, and the Playfair keyphrase is thematically significant to the final solution.

The cipher lends itself well to crossword puzzles, because the plaintext is found by solving one set of clues, while the ciphertext is found by solving others. Solvers can then construct the key table by pairing the digrams (it is sometimes possible to guess the keyword, but never necessary).

Use of the Playfair cipher is generally explained as part of the preamble to the crossword. This levels the playing field for those solvers who have not come across the cipher previously. But the way the cipher is used is always the same. The 25-letter alphabet used always contains Q and has I and J coinciding. The key table is always filled row by row.

<doc id="173589" wikidata="Q3242187" url="?curid=173589" title="Languages of Iran">
<text>Iran&#x27;s ethnic diversity means that the languages of Iran come from a number of linguistic origins, although the primary language spoken and used is Persian. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran asserts that the Persian language alone must be used for schooling and for all official government communications. The constitution also recognizes Arabic as the language of Islam, and assigns it formal status as the language of religion. Although multilingualism is not encouraged, the use of minority languages is permitted in the course of teaching minority-language literature. Different publications have reported different statistics for the languages of Iran; however, the top three languages spoken are consistently reported as Persian, Azeri and Kurdish.

== Language policy and planning of Iran ==
The current language policy of Iran is addressed in Chapter Two of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Articles 15 &amp; 16). It asserts that the Persian language is the lingua franca of the Iranian nation and as such, required for the school system and for all official government communications. In addition, the constitution recognizes the Arabic language as the language of Islam, giving it formal status as the language of religion and regulating its spread within the Iranian national curriculum.

Due to the nation&#x27;s social and ethnic diversity, the constitution also acknowledges and permits the use of minority languages in the mass media as well as within the schools, in order to teach minority-language literature. The minority languages of Iran do not receive formal status and are not officially regulated by the authorities.

The first legislation which granted the Persian language its status was initiated by Qajar dynasty in 1906, as part of an electoral law that positioned it as the official language of the state of Iran, its government, its political institutions and its legal system. Over time, this enactment was followed by others, which eventually led to a monolingual policy by the Iranian regime.

Perceiving multilingualism as a threat to the nation&#x27;s unity and territorial integrity, and seeing the need to restrict minority languages’ use and to advance the Persian language&#x27;s hegemony, Iran&#x27;s language policy consists of a non-translation outline as well: all government, administration and educational settings are obliged to use only Persian for any written communication. This applies to political institutions (i.e. the Iranian Parliament), official bureaucratic communication (forms, signage etc.) and schooling (all children from the age of six are exposed only to Persian as the language of teaching and learning and of textbooks within the public school system). In other words, the Iranian authorities hold that minorities need to learn the Iranian vernacular to an extent that will allow them to communicate with state institutions.

Among the institutions accountable for advancing Iranian Language Planning (e.g. Ministry of Education and Ministry of Science, Research and Technology) is the Academy of Persian Language and Literature, which was established on 1935, under Reza Shah Pahlavi. Constantly seeking to revise and elaborate the nation&#x27;s official language, this institute focuses on the linguistics of the Persian language and on the internal aspects of Language Planning, rather than on the use of minority languages within Iranian society. Other Language Planning aspects (e.g. sociolinguistic or functional literacy) have not been assigned to a formal institute and are currently handled free of any official master plan by the educational ministries.

== Languages of Iran ==
Different publications have reported different statistics for the languages of Iran. There have been some limited censuses taken in Iran in 2001, 1991, 1986 and 1949–1954.
The following are the languages with the greatest number of speakers (data from the CIA World Factbook):

Classification categories of the spoken languages:
* Indo-European (Iranic mainly, smaller amounts of other branches represented mainly by Armenian, amongst others)
* Turkic (mainly Azerbaijani, with smaller amounts of Turkmen, Qashqai)
* Semitic (mainly Arabic, but also Neo-Aramaic, Hebrew, and Mandean)
* Kartvelian (such as Georgian)
*North Caucasian (Circassian)

==Census in the 1990s==
A census was taken in the Iranian month of Mordad (July 21 – August 21) in 1991. In this census, all 49,588 mothers who gave birth in the country were issued birth certificates and asked about their mother-tongue. They reported: 50.2% Persian, 20.6% Azerbaijani, 10% Kurdish, 8.9% Luri, 7.2% Gilaki and Mazandarani, 3.5% Arabic, 2.7% Baluchi, 0.6% Turkmen, 0.1% Armenian, and 0.2% Others (e.g. Circassian, Georgian, etc.). The local dialect of Arabic spoken in Iran is Khuzestani Arabic, but the varieties of Arabic taught across Iran to students in secondary schools, regardless of their ethnic or linguistic background, are Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic, the latter a liturgical language of Islam.

==Foreign languages taught in schools==
=== English ===

English is taught in secondary schools (first and second high school) and some non-governmental and public schools as an extra-curricular subject. 

As of 2023, according to an official of the Iranian Ministry of Education, students were no longer required to learn English, downgrading the language to the optional level.

The language was banned in 2018, before the larger ban in 2023, from being taught in primary schools, with the subject being called a &quot;cultural invasion&quot;. The decision was made in order to strengthen the Persian language.

=== French ===

Iran&#x27;s school curriculum has included French since 2022, to provide an alternative to English.

French was also the second official language of Iran until the 1950s, with elite French co-ed schools being common amongst the upper class of Iran.

A great number of words of French origin have entered the Persian language since the early modern period. 

=== Arabic ===

Arabic, being recognised as the language of Islam in the Constitution of Iran, was taught alongside English, for religious purposes throughout kindergarten and primary school, until 2023.

Following the 2023 ban on languages besides Persian being taught in all kindergarten and primary schools, Arabic has been taught only throughout secondary school (grades 7-12).

As of October 2023, Iran has banned the teaching of foreign languages, including Arabic, in all primary and kindergarten schools. The ban is intended to help preserve Iranian identity in children at a young age.

The Arabic taught in schools is Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic, which is used in Islamic liturgy.

=== Additional Languages ===

A number of foreign languages are taught in Iran, optionally. The languages vary on the choice of the school and students.

French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish and, more recently, Chinese are allowed as additional languages based on choices made by schools and students.

In recent years, some government officials have also suggested that instead of English, the teaching of Russian, Chinese and German languages should be supported in Iran.

The addition of Mandarin Chinese as an optional subject took place in July 2023, the law, adding Chinese to the list of foreign languages that can be taught in Iranian middle and high schools, was endorsed by the then President of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi.

==Other estimations==
In 1986, a nationwide census was undertaken to determine the percentage of Iranians that know Persian, those who do not know, and those who know it fluently.

<text>An Wang (; February 7, 1920 – March 24, 1990) was a Chinese-American computer engineer and inventor, and cofounder of computer company Wang Laboratories, which was known primarily for its dedicated word processing machines. An Wang was an important contributor to the development of magnetic-core memory.

== Early life and career ==
A native of Kunshan County in Suzhou (Soochow) Prefecture, he was born in Shanghai, China. His father taught English at an elementary school outside Shanghai, while his mother Zen Wan (Chien) Wang was a homemaker. An Wang graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a degree in electrical engineering in 1940. He immigrated to the United States in June 1945 to attend Harvard University for graduate school, earning a PhD in applied physics in 1948. After graduation, he worked at Harvard with Howard Aiken on the design of the Mark IV, Aiken&#x27;s first fully electronic computer. Wang coinvented the pulse transfer controlling device with Way-Dong Woo, a schoolmate from China who fell ill before their patent was issued. The new device implemented &quot;write-after-read&quot; which made magnetic core memory possible. Harvard reduced its commitment to computer research in 1951, prompting Wang to start his own engineering business.

== Wang Laboratories ==
Wang founded Wang Laboratories in June 1951 as a sole proprietorship. The first years were lean and Wang raised working capital by selling one third of the company to a machine tools manufacturer Warner &amp; Swasey Company.

In 1955, when the core memory patent was issued, Wang sold it to IBM for and incorporated Wang Laboratories with Ge-Yao Chu, a schoolmate. The company grew slowly and in 1964 sales reached . Wang began making desktop electronic calculators with digital displays, including a centralised calculator with remote terminals for group use.

By 1970, the company had sales of and 1,400 employees. They began manufacturing word processors in 1974, copying the already popular Xerox Redactron word processor, a single-user, cassette-based product.

In 1976, they started marketing a multi-user, display-based product, based on the Zilog Z80 processor. Typical installations had a master unit (supplying disk storage) connected to intelligent diskless slaves which the operators used. Connections were via dual coax using differential signaling in an 11-bit asynchronous ASCII format clocked at 4.275 MHz. This product became the market leader in the word processing industry. In addition to calculators and word processors, Wang&#x27;s company diversified into minicomputers in the early 1970s. The Wang 2200 was one of the first desktop computers with a large CRT display and ran a fast hardwired BASIC interpreter. The Wang VS system was a multiuser minicomputer whose instruction set was very close to the design of IBM&#x27;s System/370. It was not binary-compatible because register usage conventions and system call interfaces were different. The Wang VS serial terminals could be used in data processing mode and word processing mode. They were user-programmable in data-processing mode and used the same word processing software as the earlier dedicated word processing systems.

In 1984, Wang and his family owned about 55 percent of the company stock, and &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, estimating his worth at , ranked him as the fifth richest American.

Wang Laboratories, which in 1989 once employed over 30,000 people, was headquartered in Tewksbury, Massachusetts and later Lowell, Massachusetts. When Wang looked to retire from actively running his company in 1986, he insisted upon handing over the corporate reins to his son Fred Wang. Hard times ensued for the company and the elder Wang was eventually forced to remove his son in 1989.

== Later years ==
An Wang also founded the Wang Institute of Graduate Studies in Tyngsborough, Massachusetts, which offered a graduate program in software engineering. He made substantial donations to this organization, including the proceeds of his autobiography, &quot;Lessons&quot;. However, enrollment remained low, and in 1987, after nearly a decade of operation, Wang decided to discontinue funding the institution and transferred ownership of the campus to Boston University.

An Wang also made a substantial contribution for the restoration of a Boston landmark, which was then called the Metropolitan Theatre. The &quot;Met&quot; was renamed in 1983 as The Wang Theatre, and the Metropolitan Center became known as the Wang Center for the Performing Arts. Wang donated $4 million to Massachusetts General Hospital&#x27;s ambulatory care center, which was renamed to the Wang Building. 

Wang was one of twelve recipients of the Medal of Liberty in 1986. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1988. The An Wang Middle School in Lowell, Massachusetts, is named in his honor, as is the An Wang Professorship of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Harvard University, held by Roger W. Brockett and Hanspeter Pfister, the An Wang Professorship of Computer Science at Brown University, held by John E. Savage, and the Wang Professorship of Cognitive and Neural Systems at Boston University, held by Stephen Grossberg; see sites.bu.edu/steveg.

An Wang died of cancer in 1990. He and his wife, Lorraine (Chiu) Wang, lived in Lincoln, Massachusetts. Lorraine Wang died on March 1, 2016, at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts. They had three children.

== Aphorisms ==
An Wang is known for a number of pithy aphorisms summing up principles based on his experience in business and life. Examples include:

* &quot;Success is more a function of consistent common sense than of genius.&quot;

<doc id="173592" wikidata="Q784683" url="?curid=173592" title="The Urantia Book">
<text>The Urantia Book (sometimes called The Urantia Papers or The Fifth Epochal Revelation) is a spiritual, philosophical, and religious book that originated in Chicago, Illinois, United States sometime between 1924 and 1955.

The text, which claims to have been composed by celestial beings, introduces the word &quot;Urantia&quot; as the name of the planet Earth and states that its intent is to &quot;present enlarged concepts and advanced truth.&quot; The book aims to unite religion, science, and philosophy. Its large amount of content on topics of interest to science is unique among documents said to have been received from celestial beings. Among other topics, the book discusses the origin and meaning of life, mankind&#x27;s place in the universe, the history of the planet, the relationship between God and people, and the life of Jesus.

The Urantia Foundation, a U.S.-based non-profit group, first published &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; in 1955. In 2001, a jury found that the English-language book&#x27;s copyright was no longer valid in the United States after 1983. Therefore, the English text of the book became a public domain work in the United States, and in 2006 the international copyright expired.

How it arrived at the form published in 1955 is unclear and a matter of debate. The book itself claims that its &quot;basis&quot; is found in &quot;more than one thousand human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge&quot;. Despite this general acknowledgment of derivation from human authors, the book contains no specific references to those sources. It has received both praise and criticism for its religious and science-related content, and is noted for its unusual length and the unusual names and origins of its celestial contributors.

== Background ==

=== Authorship ===
The exact circumstances of the origin of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; are unknown. The book and its publishers do not name a human author. Instead, it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an &quot;epochal&quot; religious revelation.

William S. Sadler and his wife Lena Sadler, physicians in Chicago and well known in the community, are said to have been approached as early as 1911 by a neighbor who was concerned because she would occasionally find her husband in a deep sleep and breathing abnormally. She reported that she was unable to wake him at these times. The Sadlers came to observe the episodes, and over time, the individual produced verbal communications that claimed to be from &quot;student visitor&quot; spiritual beings. This changed sometime in early 1925 with a &quot;voluminous handwritten document,&quot; which from then on became the regular method of purported communication. The individual was never identified publicly but has been described as &quot;a hard-boiled business man, member of the board of trade and stock exchange.&quot;

The Sadlers were both respected physicians, and William Sadler was a sometime debunker of paranormal claims. In 1929, he published a book called &quot;The Mind at Mischief&quot;, in which he explained the fraudulent methods of mediums and how self-deception leads to psychic claims. He wrote in an appendix that there were two cases that he had not explained to his satisfaction:

The other exception has to do with a rather peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify. ... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance. ... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities. ... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.

In 1923, a group of Sadler&#x27;s friends, former patients, and colleagues began meeting for Sunday philosophical and religious discussions, but became interested in the strange communications when Sadler mentioned the case at their fourth meeting and read samples at their request. Shortly afterward, a communication reportedly was received that was intended to serve as the basis for questions from the group that would be answered by celestial beings through the &quot;contact personality.&quot;

Sadler presented this development to the group, and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness, but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers. They became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions, until all papers now collected together as &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; were obtained. The group was known as the Forum, and was formalized in 1925 as a closed group of 30 members who pledged not to discuss the material with others. Over time, some participants left and others joined, leading to a total membership of 486 people over the years from diverse backgrounds and a mix of interest levels. A smaller group of five individuals called the Contact Commission, including the Sadlers, was responsible for gathering the questions from the Forum, acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers, and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material. Bill Sadler, Jr. is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book.

The Sadlers and others involved, now all deceased, claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them, with the first two parts being completed in 1934 and the third and fourth in 1935. The last Forum gathering was in 1942.

After the last of Part IV was obtained in 1935, there was a period of time during which requests for clarification supposedly resulted in revisions from the celestials. Sadler and his son Bill at one point wrote a draft introduction but were told they could not use it. The Foreword was then &quot;received.&quot;

The communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the Forum studied the book in depth, and according to Sadler and others, permission to publish it was given to them in 1955. The Urantia Foundation was formed in 1950 as a tax-exempt educational society in Illinois, and through privately raised funds, the book was published on October 12, 1955.

Only the members of the Contact Commission witnessed the activities of the &quot;sleeping subject&quot;, and only they knew his identity. The individual is claimed to have been kept anonymous in order to prevent undesirable future veneration or reverence for him. Martin Gardner claims that an explanation concerning the origin of the book more plausible than celestial beings is that the Contact Commission, particularly William Sadler, was responsible. Gardner&#x27;s conclusion is that a man named Wilfred Kellogg was the sleeping subject and authored the work from his subconscious mind, with William Sadler subsequently editing and authoring parts. Brad Gooch believes Sadler wrote the book, possibly with help from others on the Contact Commission. A statistical analysis, using the Mosteller and Wallace methods of stylometry, indicates at least nine authors were involved in the Urantia documents. Comparing Sadler&#x27;s &quot;The Mind at Mischief&quot; to the Urantia documents does not indicate authorship or extensive editing of the latter by Sadler, without ruling out the possibility Sadler made limited edits or contributions.

=== Copyright status ===
In 1991, after having compiled an index of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; and distributed free copies via computer disk and printouts, Kristen Maaherra was sued by the Urantia Foundation for violating their copyright on the book. In 1995, Maaherra won a summary judgment declaring the Urantia Foundation&#x27;s copyright renewal invalid. Upon appeal, the judgment was reversed and awarded to the Urantia Foundation.

Four years later, in 1999, Harry McMullan III and the Michael Foundation published a book, &quot;Jesus–A New Revelation&quot;, which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;. McMullan and the Michael Foundation subsequently sought a legal declaration that the Urantia Foundation&#x27;s US copyright in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; was either invalid or, alternatively, that the copyright had not been infringed upon. Urantia Foundation&#x27;s copyright was held to have expired in 1983 because the book was deemed to have been neither a composite work nor a commissioned work for hire. These two arguments having been rejected, a U.S. court held that, since the &quot;sleeping subject&quot; (whom the court referred to as &quot;the Conduit&quot;) had died prior to 1983, only the Conduit&#x27;s heirs would have been eligible to renew the copyright in 1983 and, since they had not done so, the Urantia Foundation&#x27;s copyright on the book had expired and the book had therefore passed into the public domain. This decision was upheld on appeal. The Urantia Foundation accepted that as of 2006, the international copyright on the English text expired.

== Overview ==

&quot;The Urantia Book&quot; is approximately 2,000 pages long, and consists of a body of 196 &quot;papers&quot; divided in four parts, and an introductory foreword:
* Part I, titled &quot;The Central and Superuniverses,&quot; addresses what the authors consider the highest levels of creation, including the eternal and infinite &quot;Universal Father,&quot; his Trinity associates, and the &quot;Isle of Paradise.&quot;
* Part II, &quot;The Local Universe,&quot; describes the origin, administration, and personalities of the local universe of &quot;Nebadon&quot; the part of the cosmos where Earth resides. It discusses the inhabitants of local universes and how the work of different orders of beings, including humans and angels, is coordinated within a scheme of ascension and spiritual progress.
* Part III, &quot;The History of Urantia,&quot; presents a broad history of the Earth, offering an explanation of the origin, evolution, and destiny of the planet and its inhabitants. Topics include Adam and Eve, Melchizedek, essays on the concept of the Thought Adjuster, &quot;Religion in Human Experience,&quot; and &quot;Personality Survival.&quot;
* Part IV, &quot;The Life and Teachings of Jesus,&quot; is the largest part at 775 pages, and is often noted as the most accessible and most impressive. It narrates a detailed biography of Jesus that includes his childhood, teenage years, family life, and public ministry, as well as the events that led to his crucifixion, death, and resurrection. Its papers continue with appearances after he rose, Pentecost and, finally, &quot;The Faith of Jesus.&quot;

=== Nature of God ===
According to &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, God is the creator and upholder of all reality—an omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, infinite, and eternal spirit personality. The most fundamental teaching about God in the book is that the human concept that most closely approximates the nature of God is that of a Father. Specifically, &quot;the Father idea is [still] the highest human concept of God.&quot; It is also said that, &quot;The face which the Infinite turns toward all universe personalities is the face of a Father, the Universal Father of love.&quot;

God, according to the book, is one Deity who functions on a range of different levels of reality, both personal and impersonal. God is said to exist in a Trinity of three perfectly individualized persons who are co-equal: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. These persons are referred to by additional titles in the book, primarily as the &quot;Universal Father,&quot; &quot;Eternal Son,&quot; and &quot;Infinite Spirit.&quot; While stating that the concept of one God in three persons is difficult to fully understand, the book says that the idea: &quot;...in no manner violates the truth of the divine unity. The three personalities of Paradise Deity are, in all universe reality reactions and in all creature relations, as one.&quot;

The Father, Son, and Spirit are considered &quot;existential&quot; persons of Deity, those in existence from the eternal past to the eternal future. In addition, three persons of Deity are described who are &quot;experiential,&quot; or incomplete and in the process of actualizing: God the Supreme; God the Ultimate; and God the Absolute. Of these three, God the Supreme, or &quot;the Supreme Being,&quot; is given the most explanation, as the person of Deity evolving in time and space to unify finite reality and the infinite. The persons of God the Ultimate and God the Absolute are considered to be remote from the possibility of comprehension and are covered on a limited basis.

Many types of celestial beings are enumerated in the book, and one of particular note is a joint &quot;offspring&quot; of the Universal Father and Eternal Son called a &quot;Creator Son.&quot; A divine Creator Son is considered the highest personification of the Universal Father and Eternal Son that is possible for people to know and: &quot;...is, to all practical intents and purposes, God.&quot; Jesus of Nazareth is identified as a Creator Son who incarnated on Earth, and the central theme of the book&#x27;s section recounting his life and teachings is that the religion he preached is the highest known to the world.

The final paper states:

=== God and the individual ===
God is described as the Father of each individual, and through the direct gift of a fragment of his eternal spirit, called a Thought Adjuster, is said to be able to guide the individual toward an increased understanding of him. The Thought Adjuster is a central teaching of the book and is also referred to as a &quot;Mystery Monitor&quot; and &quot;indwelling presence,&quot; as well as a &quot;divine spark.&quot; The idea is compared within the book to the Hindu atman and the ancient Egyptian ka. In relation to biblical traditions, the Thought Adjuster is said to be the meaning behind the phrases &quot;being made in God&#x27;s image&quot; and the &quot;kingdom of God is within you&quot;:

Each person is said to receive one such fragment at the time of his or her first independent moral decision, on average around the age of five years and 10 months. The Adjuster then serves noncoercively as a divine partner in the mind of the individual for the rest of life, and to the extent that a person consents with their free will to want to find God, it leads the person toward more mature, spiritualized thinking. A person&#x27;s Thought Adjuster is described as distinct from either the soul or the conscience. In &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;&#x27;s teachings, the degree to which a human mind chooses to accept its Adjuster&#x27;s guidance becomes the degree to which a person&#x27;s soul &quot;grows&quot; and becomes a reality that can then survive death. The soul is in essence an embryonic spiritual development, one parental factor being the divine Adjuster and the other being the human will.

The book says: &quot;But you yourself are mostly unconscious of this inner ministry. You are quite incapable of distinguishing the product of your own material intellect from that of the conjoint activities of your soul and the Adjuster.&quot; The book is strongly fideistic and teaches that neither science nor logic will ever be able to prove or disprove the existence of God, arguing that faith is necessary to become conscious of God&#x27;s presence in human experience, the Thought Adjuster.

Persistently embracing sin is considered the same as rejecting the leadings of the Adjuster, rejecting the will of God. Constant selfishness and sinful choosing lead eventually to iniquity and full identification with unrighteousness, and since unrighteousness is unreal, it results in the eventual annihilation of the individual&#x27;s identity. Personalities like this become &quot;as if they never were.&quot; The book says that: &quot;...in the last analysis, such sin-identified individuals have destroyed themselves by becoming wholly unreal through their embrace of iniquity.&quot; The concepts of Hell and reincarnation are not taught.

The book says that a person ultimately is destined to fuse with his or her divine fragment and become one inseparable entity with it as the final goal of faith. Uniting with the Adjuster fragment is the &quot;reward of the ages,&quot; the moment when a human personality has successfully and unalterably won eternal life, described as typically taking place in the afterlife, but also a possibility during earthly life. The result during human life is a &quot;fusion flash,&quot; with the material body consumed in a fiery light and the soul &quot;translated&quot; to the afterlife. The Hebrew prophet Elijah being taken to heaven without death in &quot;chariots of fire&quot; is said to be a rare example in recorded history of a person who translated instead of experiencing death.

After a person fuses with his or her fragment of God, &quot;then will begin your real life, the ascending life, to which your present mortal state is but the vestibule.&quot; A person continues as an ascending citizen in the universe and travels through numerous worlds on a long pilgrimage of growth and learning that eventually leads to God and residence on Paradise. Mortals who reach this stage are called &quot;finaliters.&quot; The book goes on to discuss the potential destinies of these &quot;glorified mortals.&quot;

The book regards human life on earth as a &quot;short and intense test,&quot; and the afterlife as a continuation of training that begins in material life. The &quot;religion of Jesus&quot; is considered to be practiced by way of loving God the Father, thereby learning to love each person the way Jesus loves people; that is, recognizing the &quot;fatherhood of God and its correlated truth, the brotherhood of man,&quot; resulting in unselfish service to others.

=== Cosmology ===
The book describes that at the center of the cosmos is the stationary Isle of Paradise—the dwelling place of God—with Paradise being surrounded by &quot;Havona,&quot; an eternal universe containing a billion perfect worlds, around which seven incomplete and evolutionary &quot;superuniverses&quot; circle.

The word &quot;universe&quot; in the book is used to denote a number of different scales of organization. A &quot;superuniverse&quot; is roughly the size of a galaxy or group of galaxies, and the seven superuniverses along with Paradise-Havona are together designated as the &quot;grand universe.&quot; A &quot;local universe&quot; is a portion of a superuniverse, with 100,000 local universes being in each superuniverse. Beyond the seven superuniverses, uninhabited &quot;outer space levels&quot; are described. The term &quot;master universe&quot; refers to what in modern usage would be the total universe—all existing matter and space taken as a whole.

Urantia is said to be located in a remote local universe named &quot;Nebadon,&quot; which itself is part of superuniverse number seven, &quot;Orvonton.&quot; The physical size of a local universe is not directly stated, but each is said to have up to 10 million inhabited worlds.

=== History and future of the world ===
The book&#x27;s extensive teachings about the history of the world include its physical development about 4.5 billion years ago, the gradual changes in conditions that allowed life to develop, and long ages of organic evolution that started with microscopic marine life and led to plant and animal life in the oceans, later on land. The emergence of humans is presented as having occurred about a million years ago from a branch of superior primates originating from a lemur ancestor. The first humans are said to have been male and female twins called Andon and Fonta, born &quot;993,419 years prior to 1934.&quot;

&quot;The Urantia Book&quot; teaches not only biological evolution, but that human society and spiritual understandings evolve by slow progression, subject both to periods of rapid improvement and the possibility of retrogression. Progress is said to follow a divine plan that includes periodic gifts of revelation and ministry by heavenly teachers, which eventually will lead to an ideal world status of &quot;light and life&quot; in the far distant future.

Although there is the ideal and divine plan of progression, it is said to be fostered and administered by various orders of celestial beings who are not always perfect. Urantia is said to be a markedly &quot;confused and disordered&quot; planet that is &quot;greatly retarded in all phases of intellectual progress and spiritual attainment&quot; compared to more typical inhabited worlds, due to an unusually severe history of rebellion and default by its spiritual supervisors.

== Comparisons ==

=== Comparison to Christianity ===
More than one third of the content of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; is devoted to a narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus, and the Judeo-Christian tradition is given an importance exceeding any other. The book&#x27;s teachings claim to be a clarification and expansion of Jesus’s teaching. However, numerous differences are noted between its teachings and commonly accepted Christian doctrines.

Jesus is held in high regard by &quot;The Urantia Book,&quot; as he is in the New Testament of the Bible. The following are attributed to him in both texts:
* He was both human and divine, the Son of God incarnate who was born to Mary, whose husband was Joseph.
* He performed many of the miracles described in the Bible, such as the resurrection of Lazarus, the turning of water into wine, the feeding of the five thousand, and numerous healings of the blind, diseased, and infirm.
* He taught twelve apostles, [they were disciples or students. Paul was an apostle] most of whom went on to spread his teachings.
* He was crucified, and on the third day after his death, rose from the dead.
* He will return to the world again some day.

Some differences with Christianity include:
* Jesus&#x27; crucifixion is not considered an atonement for the sins of humanity. The crucifixion is taught to be an outcome of the fears of religious leaders of the day, who regarded his teachings as a threat to their positions of authority.
* Jesus is considered the human incarnation of &quot;Michael of Nebadon,&quot; one of more than 700,000 &quot;Paradise Sons&quot; of God, or &quot;Creator Sons.&quot; Jesus is not considered the second person of the Trinity as he is in Christianity. The book refers to the Eternal Son as the second person of the Trinity.
* Jesus was born on Earth through natural means of conception instead of a virgin birth.
* Some of the miracles described in the Bible Jesus did not perform, for example walking on water.

=== Comparison to Seventh-day Adventism ===
Gardner notes similarities between Seventh-day Adventism and the teachings of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, and sees this as evidence that William Sadler and Wilfred Kellogg had a role in editing or writing the book, since they both were one-time believers in Adventism. For instance, two basic Adventist beliefs that distinguish it from mainline Christianity are the doctrines of soul sleeping and annihilationism, both of which &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; also supports. Lewis notes that from the perspective of the book being a &quot;revelation,&quot; it could be claimed the &quot;celestial beings&quot; simply found areas of Adventist belief to be accurate and therefore presented and expanded on them. While the book supports aspects of Adventism, it also is mixed with teachings that are heresies to Adventists.

=== Other comparisons ===
The book can be seen as belonging in the genre of spiritual literature that includes &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; and &quot;Conversations with God&quot;. Gardner compares it with &quot;Oahspe&quot;, noting that though &quot;Oahspe&quot; is &quot;vastly inferior to the UB both in ideas and style of writing,&quot; they are similar in claiming to have been written by celestial beings channelled through a human conduit, teaching that there is &quot;one ultimate God who oversees a vast bureaucracy of lesser deities&quot; while both outline an elaborate cosmology. The book&#x27;s claimed supernatural origin has been compared to similar claims of the Book of Mormon, Science and Health, the Quran, and the Bible, with belief in it not being seen as necessarily a greater leap in reason.

Incorporated in the book itself are comparisons with facets of various world religions including Buddhism, Islam, Taoism, Judaism, Hinduism, Shinto, and Confucianism. For example, Paper 131, &quot;The World&#x27;s Religions&quot; discusses the aspects of these religions that are in common with what the book claims is the &quot;religion of Jesus.&quot; The stance of the book is that &quot;There is not a Urantia religion that could not profitably study and assimilate the best of the truths contained in every other faith, for all contain truth.&quot;

== Consideration as literature ==
&quot;The Urantia Book&quot; has been enjoyed by some as a form of science fiction, historical fiction, or fantasy. &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; is noted for its high level of internal consistency and an advanced writing style. Skeptic Martin Gardner, in a book otherwise highly critical of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, writes that it is &quot;highly imaginative&quot; and that the &quot;cosmology outrivals in fantasy the cosmology of any science-fiction work known to me.&quot; Gooch says that for nonbelievers, the book is a mixture of being &quot;fascinating, inspiring, compelling, haunting, entertaining, annoying, incomprehensible, and always wordy.&quot;

Parts I, II, and III are chiefly written in expository language. The papers are informational, matter-of-fact, and instructional. Part IV of the book is written as a biography of Jesus&#x27; life, and some feel it is a rich narrative with well-developed characters, high attention to detail, woven sub-plots, and realistic dialogue. Considered as literature, Part IV is favorably compared to retellings of Jesus&#x27; life, such as &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus Christ&quot; by José Saramago and &quot;Behold the Man&quot; by Michael Moorcock. Martin Gardner considers Part IV to be an especially &quot;well-written, impressive work,&quot; and says, &quot;Either it is accurate in its history, coming directly from higher beings in position to know, or it is a work of fertile imagination by someone who knew the New Testament by heart and who was also steeped in knowledge of the times when Jesus lived.&quot;

== Critical views ==

=== Criticisms of claims as a revelation ===
The authors refer to the book as the fifth revelation of &quot;epochal significance&quot; to humankind, the fourth epochal revelation having been the life of Jesus. The assertion in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; that it constitutes &quot;the most recent presentation of truth to the mortals of Urantia&quot; has been criticized as a product of &quot;human efforts.&quot; Because the book asserts certain tenets of Christianity, such as the atonement doctrine, are of human origin, while presenting a great deal more of Jesus&#x27; life not recorded in any versions of the Bible, others with a Christian viewpoint have argued it cannot be genuine. Gooch notes that while its &quot;somewhat dated, elegant&quot; prose could be read as fiction, due to its claim of divine revelation &quot;the book invites reactions far more scathing than [it] ... might otherwise merit.&quot;

=== Criticism of its science ===
In Paper 101, &quot;The Real Nature of Religion,&quot; the authors write:
We full well know that, while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations is not inspired.

As pointed out by skeptic Martin Gardner, the science in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; reflects some views that prevailed at the time the book originated. The claim by the authors that no unknown scientific discoveries could be imparted can function as a ruse to allow mistakes to be dismissed later. The appeal to consequence that post-1955 scientific knowledge is not being presented is consistent with a book written by humans in the 1950s instead of celestial beings with superior knowledge.

Examples of criticisms regarding the science in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; include:
* The described formation of the Solar System is consistent with the Chamberlin-Moulton planetesimal hypothesis, which though popular in the early part of the 20th century, was discarded by the 1940s after major flaws were noted. The currently accepted scientific explanation for the origin of the Solar System is based on the nebular hypothesis.
* According to the book&#x27;s descriptions, the universe is hundreds of billions of years old and periodically expands and contracts — &quot;respires&quot; — at 2-billion-year intervals. Recent observations measure the true age of the universe to be 13.8 billion years. The book does not support the Big Bang theory.
* A fundamental particle called an &quot;ultimaton&quot; is proposed, with an electron being composed of 100 ultimatons. The particle is not known to be described anywhere else and the concept is at odds with modern particle physics.
* The Andromeda Galaxy is claimed to be &quot;almost one million&quot; light years away, repeating a systematic mistake in the measurements of the distance to galaxies made in the 1920s. The galaxy is now known to be 2.5 million light years away.
* The book repeats the mistaken idea that planets close to a sun will gradually spin slower until one hemisphere is left always turned to the sun due to tidal locking, citing Mercury as an example. Scientists at the time of the book&#x27;s origin thought one side of Mercury always faced the Sun, just as one side of the Moon always faces the Earth. In 1965, radio astronomers discovered however that Mercury rotates fast enough for all sides to see exposure to the Sun. Scientists further established that Mercury is locked in this spin rate in a stable resonance of 3 spins for every 2 orbits, and it is not slowing and so will never have one side left always turned to the Sun.
* Some species are said to have evolved suddenly from single mutations without transitional species. The theory originated with Dutch botanist Hugo De Vries but was short-lived and is not now supported.
* The book erroneously stated that a solar eclipse was predicted in 1808 by the Native American prophet Tenskwatawa. The eclipse actually was predicted in late April 1806 and occurred on June 16, 1806. In 2009, the Urantia Foundation acknowledged the error and revised the book.
* Controversial statements about human races can be found in the book. Gardner recounts that William S. Sadler also wrote eugenicist works that contain similar arguments to some ideas presented in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;.

While some adherents of the book believe that all of the information in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; including its science is literally true, others believe the science is not fully accurate. For example, Meredith Sprunger, a believer in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; and retired minister of the United Church of Christ, wrote that research &quot;has revealed that virtually all of the scientific material found in the UB was the accepted scientific knowledge of the period in which the book was written, was held by some scientists of that time, or was about to be discovered or recognized.&quot; He further argued against its literal infallibility and said that fundamentalism over the book is &quot;just as untenable as Biblical fundamentalism.&quot;

Other believers maintain that the book has prophetically anticipated scientific advances. They believe more of its science — if not all of it — will be proven correct in the future. Gardner evaluated many of these claims as of 1995 and argued that they were fairly unconvincing. Because the book is said to have been written by the revelators by 1935 but not published until 1955, discoveries from science during the two intervening decades are often declared to be prophetic by believers, while skeptics point out that edits could have been made to the book up to its 1955 publication. For instance, the catalytic role that carbon plays in the sun&#x27;s nuclear reactions is described in the book, and Hans Bethe&#x27;s announcement of the discovery was made in 1938.

The only apparent anticipation of science the book has made, in Gardner&#x27;s opinion, is that it says the magnetic sense that homing pigeons possess is &quot;not wholly wanting as a conscious possession by mankind.&quot; In 1980, a British zoologist, Robin Baker, published evidence that humans have a limited magnetic sense.

Mark McMenamin, a professor of geology, quotes a section of the book describing a billion-year-old supercontinent that subsequently split apart, forming ocean basins where early marine life developed. He says, &quot;This amazing passage, written in the 1930s, anticipates scientific results that did not actually appear in the scientific literature until many decades later.&quot; McMenamin also states, &quot;Of course I am being selective here in my choice of quotations, and there are reams of scientifically untenable material in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;.&quot;

=== Use of other published material without attribution ===
&quot;The Urantia Book&quot; states in its Foreword that more than one thousand &quot;human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings&quot; were selected in preparing the papers. The authors say that they were required to &quot;give preference to the highest existing human concepts pertaining to the subjects to be presented&quot; and would &quot;resort to pure revelation only when the concept of presentation has had no adequate previous expression by the human mind.&quot; One of the authors wrote in Part IV: &quot;I well know that those concepts which have had origin in the human mind will prove more acceptable and helpful to all other human minds.&quot;

In recent years, students of the papers have found that the free use of other sources appears to be true. None of the material allegedly used from other sources is directly cited or referenced within the book.

In 1992, a reader of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, Matthew Block, self-published a paper that showed &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; utilized material from 15 other books. All of the source authors identified in Block&#x27;s paper were published in English between 1905 and 1943 by U.S. publishers and are typically scholarly or academic works that contain concepts and wording similar to what is found in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;. Block has since claimed to have discovered over 125 source texts that were incorporated into the papers.

The use of outside source materials was studied separately by Gardner and by Gooch. Consistent with the belief of each that the book&#x27;s author(s) must have been human, they conclude that the book plagiarized many of the sources noted by Block.

For instance, Gardner and Block note that Paper 85 appears to have been taken from the first eight chapters of &quot;Origin and Evolution of Religion&quot; by Edward Washburn Hopkins, published by Yale University Press in 1923. Each section of the paper corresponds to a chapter in the book, with several passages possibly used as direct material and further material used in Papers 86-90 and 92. (In addition to the book&#x27;s &quot;heavy indebtedness to Hopkins,&quot; Gardner discovered that Hopkins was a major reference in an earlier book authored by Sadler, adding to Gardner&#x27;s view that it is more likely Sadler had a hand in writing or editing &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; than that celestial beings wrote it.) Likewise, much of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; material relating to the evolution of mankind appears to have been directly taken from Henry Fairfield Osborn, &quot;Man Rises to Parnassus: Critical Epochs in the Prehistory of Man&quot; published by Princeton University Press in 1928.

In one example cited by Block and confirmed by Gardner and Gooch, the original author discusses the periodicity of the chemical elements and concludes that the harmony in the construction of the atom suggests some unspecified plan of organization. The authors of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; assert that this harmony is evidence of the intelligent design of the universe. W. F. G. Swann writes on page 64 of &quot;The Architecture of the Universe&quot; (italics indicate edits as compared to &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, bolding indicates deletions):
Contrast with &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;&#x27;s version:

Block and other believers do not see the use of the source materials as plagiarism, but express a view instead that the quality of the way the material was borrowed is consistent with authorship by celestial beings and that study of the sources leads to an even deeper understanding of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;. Gooch, a professor of English, assessed that the use of the sources &quot;does reveal to us an author with a busy genius for metaphysical invention and poetic turns of phrase whose scam was at worst benign and at most visionary.&quot; Asked by Gardner what he thought of these plagiarisms, Sprunger responded in a letter by saying that if humans wrote the book the plagiarisms would indeed be disturbing but not if it was written by supermortals.

== Influence ==

=== Adherents ===
It is difficult to gauge how many adherents there may be as there are multiple organizations to census. Informal study groups &quot;tend to sprout, ripen, then vanish or splinter&quot; and have not been counted reliably. Readers sometimes join study groups after reading on their own for years or decades, others join them soon after developing an interest in the book, while &quot;for most, worship remains as individual as the act of reading.&quot; Disagreements over the legal ownership of the book, its interpretation, and the reception of new revelations have led to some splintering, though these disagreements appear to have been settled to the satisfaction of most adherents. The movement generally incorporates a nonsectarian view, contending that individuals with different religious backgrounds can receive the book&#x27;s teachings as an enrichment rather than as a contradiction of their faiths.

The movement inspired by &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; has not developed clergy or institutions such as churches, or temples.

Sarah Lewis notes that, &quot;The Urantia Revelation is not securing legitimacy through historically known and accepted means to any great degree, nor is it even using common language that would increase the likelihood of understanding and therefore acceptance. It introduces new concepts and a new language, and this does not make acceptance any easier.&quot; She assesses that the movement is uncontroversial compared to other ones, &quot;lacking the zealous proselytizing found within many other groups,&quot; and that it is therefore likely to remain small and unaffected by opposing views.

Urantia Foundation advocated a &quot;slow growth&quot; policy in the past and had not significantly marketed the book. Sales by Urantia Foundation went from 7,000 in 1990 to 24,700 in 1997, and steadily increased to nearly 38,000 in 2000, an &quot;upturn that seems to represent a genuine trend rather than just some spike on a sales chart,&quot; but in 2011 Urantia Foundation reported worldwide annual sales of 16,000 copies and over 60,000 downloads from various sites. Since the book was determined to be in the public domain in 2001, other organizations, such as The Urantia Book Fellowship under the publishing name Uversa Press, have also published the book. Copies of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; are on the Internet in various formats and it has been adapted to more recent platforms such as the Kindle and the iOS App Store. Several audio books of the text are also on the Internet.

The International Urantia Association had twenty-six reader associations worldwide as of 2002, and The Urantia Book Fellowship (formerly the Urantia Brotherhood, founded in 1955 with Urantia Foundation as the original social fraternal organization of believers) claimed roughly twelve hundred official members, with the highest concentrations in the West of the United States and the Sun Belt, especially California, Colorado, Florida, and Texas. It appears an increasing number of people are forming study groups, participating in Internet discussion groups, and hosting or visiting websites about it.

=== Independent channelers ===
The Teaching Mission is a group of Urantia channellers. According to Richard Landes, &quot;The foundation considers them self-deluded, but they have created a schism that continues to disrupt the movement.&quot;

Vern Grimsley was a preacher who founded a Urantian outreach organization called Family of God in the 1970s, which was initially supported by others in the movement, including the Urantia Foundation. Beginning in the early 1980s, Grimsley claimed he heard voices that were from the same higher beings who wrote &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, and that the voices warned of an impending world war followed by a nuclear holocaust. While some in the movement believed him, others including the Urantia Foundation concluded Grimsley&#x27;s messages were spurious, former friends eventually began to shun him, and in later years he is said to have lived in obscurity.

=== In popular culture ===

* In 1975, the band Spirit included the song &quot;Urantia&quot; on their &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; album. The piece was co-written by guitarist Randy California, who had been &quot;immersed in the Urantia Foundation&quot; for a few years at that point.
* The jazz fusion band Weather Report have a song entitled &#x27;Havona&#x27; on their 1977 studio album Heavy Weather. &#x27;Havona&#x27; is the last track on the respective studio album on side two and was composed by bassist Jaco Pastorius (1951–1987) as a reference to a term (i.e. &quot;The Paradise-Havona System&quot;) which appears in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;.
* Karlheinz Stockhausen (1928–2007) based his seven-opera cycle &quot;Licht&quot; on the cosmology of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;.
* Stevie Ray Vaughan (1954–1990), American blues rock guitarist: &quot;Stevie often brought along the book of Urantia and read Lindi passages from the strange publication.&quot;
* Jimi Hendrix (1942–1970): &quot;Jimi also had with him the Book of Urantia, an alternative Bible... Jimi carried this book with him everywhere--along with his Bob Dylan songbook--and told friends he had learned much from its pages.&quot;
* Jerry Garcia (1942–1995) of Grateful Dead was a reader of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; and claimed it was &quot;one of his favorite esoteric works&quot;
* Kerry Livgren (1949–present) of Kansas is quoted as saying, &quot;In 1977, I discovered a book that convinced me I had reached the end of my quest. It was called &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; ...&quot;
* American guitarist Steve Vai (1960–present) composed and released a song entitled &#x27;Midway Creatures&#x27; (from his seventh studio album Real Illusions: Reflections) which is a term that also appears in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, more specifically in Paper 77.
* American alternative metal band Deftones&#x27; ninth album, Ohms (album), features a track named Urantia.
* American synth-metal band Deadsy&#x27;s song &quot;The Mansion World&quot; from their 2002 album Commencement (album) has many references to themes in The Urantia Book.

== Symbols ==

An important symbol described in &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; as &quot;the banner of Michael&quot; and the &quot;material emblem of the Trinity government of all creation,&quot; consists of three azure blue concentric circles on a white background. The circles are said to be &quot;emblematic of the infinity, eternity, and universality of the Paradise Trinity&quot;.

The incarnated priest and contemporary of Abraham, Machiventa Melchizedek, wore on his breast an emblem of three concentric circles representative of the Paradise Trinity. During a system-wide rebellion instigated by Lucifer, the so-called &quot;war in heaven,&quot; Lucifer&#x27;s emblem was a banner of white with one red circle, in the center of which a black solid circle appeared.

<doc id="173596" wikidata="Q1206799" url="?curid=173596" title="Wang Laboratories">
<text>Wang Laboratories, Inc., was an American computer company founded in 1951 by An Wang and G. Y. Chu. The company was successively headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1954–1963), Tewksbury, Massachusetts (1963–1976), and finally in Lowell, Massachusetts (1976–1997). At its peak in the 1980s, Wang Laboratories had annual revenues of US$3 billion and employed over 33,000 people. It was one of the leading companies during the time of the Massachusetts Miracle.

The company was directed by An Wang, who was described as an &quot;indispensable leader&quot; and played a personal role in setting business and product strategy until his death in 1990. The company went through transitions between different product lines, beginning with typesetters, calculators, and word processors, then adding computers, copiers, and laser printers.

Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection in August 1992. After emerging from bankruptcy, the company changed its name to Wang Global. It was acquired by Getronics of the Netherlands in 1999, becoming Getronics North America, then was sold to KPN in 2007 and CompuCom in 2008.

==Public stock listing==
Wang went public on August 26, 1967, with the issuance of 240,000 shares at $12.50 per share on the American Stock Exchange. The stock closed the day above $40, valuing the company&#x27;s equity at approximately $77 million, of which An Wang and his family owned about 63%.

An Wang took steps to ensure that the Wang family would retain control of the company even after going public. He created a second class of stock, class B, with higher dividends but only one-tenth the voting power of class C. The public mostly bought class B shares; the Wang family retained most of the class C shares. The letters B and C were used to ensure that brokerages would fill any Wang stock orders with class B shares unless class C was specifically requested. Wang stock had been listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but this maneuver was not quite acceptable under NYSE&#x27;s rules, and Wang was forced to delist with NYSE and relist on the more liberal American Stock Exchange. After Wang&#x27;s 1992 bankruptcy, holders of class B and C common stock were treated the same.

==Products==

===Typesetters===
The company&#x27;s first major project was the Linasec in 1964, an electronic special-purpose computer designed to justify paper tape for use on automated Linotype machines. It was developed under contract to phototypesetter manufacturer Compugraphic, which retained the manufacturing rights of the Linasec. The success of the machine led Compugraphic to decide to manufacture it themselves, causing Wang to lose out on a million dollars in revenue.

===Calculators===
The Wang LOCI-2 (Logarithmic Computing Instrument) desktop calculator (the earlier LOCI-1 in September 1964 was not a real product) was introduced in January 1965. Using &quot;factor combining&quot;, it was the first desktop calculator capable of computing logarithms, which was quite an achievement for a machine without any integrated circuits. The electronics included 1,275 discrete transistors. It performed multiplication by adding logarithms, and roundoff in the display conversion was noticeable: 2 × 2 yielded 3.999999999.

From 1965 to about 1971, Wang was a well-regarded calculator company. The dollar price of Wang calculators was in the mid-four-figures. They used Nixie tube readouts, performed transcendental functions, had varying degrees of programmability, and used magnetic core memory. The 200 and 300 calculator models were available as time-shared simultaneous (SE) packages that had a central processing unit the size of a small suitcase connected by cables leading to four individual desktop display/keyboard units. Competition included HP, which introduced the HP 9100A in 1968, and old-line calculator companies such as Monroe and Marchant.

Wang calculators were at first sold to scientists and engineers, but the company later became established in financial services industries, which had relied on complicated printed tables for mortgages and annuities.

In 1971, Wang believed that calculators would become unprofitable low-margin commodities and decided to leave the calculator business within a few years.

===Word processors===

====The Wang 1200====
Wang&#x27;s first attempt at a word processor was the Wang 1200, announced in late 1971 but not available until 1972. The design consisted of the logic of a Wang 500 calculator hooked up to an OEM-manufactured IBM Selectric typewriter for keying and printing, and dual cassette decks for storage. Harold Koplow, who had written the microcode for the Wang 700 and its derivative the Wang 500 rewrote the microcode to perform word processing functions instead of numerical calculations.

The operator of a Wang 1200 typed text on a conventional IBM Selectric keyboard; when the Return key was pressed, the line of text was stored on a cassette tape. One cassette held roughly 20 pages of text and could be &quot;played back&quot; (e.g., the text retrieved) by printing the contents on continuous-form paper in the 1200 typewriter&#x27;s &quot;print&quot; mode. The stored text could also be edited using keys on a simple, six-key array. Basic editing functions included Insert, Delete, Skip (character, line), and so on.

The labor and cost savings of this device were immediate and remarkable: pages of text no longer had to be retyped to correct simple errors, and projects could be worked on, stored, and then retrieved for use later on. The rudimentary Wang 1200 machine was the precursor of the Wang Office Information System (OIS), which revolutionized the way typing projects were performed in the American workplace.

====Wang OIS====
Following the Wang 1200, Harold Koplow and David Moros made another attempt at designing a word processor. They started by first writing the user&#x27;s manual for the product. A 2002 &quot;Boston Globe&quot; article refers to Koplow as a &quot;wisecracking rebel&quot; who &quot;was waiting for dismissal when, in 1975, he developed the product that made computers popularly accessible.&quot;

In Koplow&#x27;s words, &quot;Dr. Wang kicked me out of marketing. I, along with Dave Moros, was relegated to Long Range Planning – &#x27;LRPed&#x27;. This ... was tantamount to being fired: &#x27;here is a temporary job until you find another one in some other company.&#x27;&quot;

Although he and Moros perceived the assignment to design a word processing machine as busywork, they went ahead anyway. They wrote the manual and convinced An Wang to turn it into a real project. The word processing machinethe Wang 1200 WPSwas introduced in June 1976 and was an instant success, as was its successor, the 1977 Wang OIS (Office Information System).

The OIS was a multi-user system. Each workstation looked like a typical terminal but contained its own Intel 8080 microprocessor (later versions used a Z80) and 64 KB of RAM (less than the original 1981 IBM PC). Disk storage was centralized in a master unit and shared by the workstations, and the connection was via high-speed dual coaxial cable &quot;928 Link&quot;.

===Copiers/printers===
Ahead of IBM and Xerox, Wang captured the lead for &quot;the &#x27;intelligent&#x27; printer: a high-speed office copier that can be linked electronically&quot; to PCs &quot;and other automated equipment&quot;. A year later, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the IBM 6670 &quot;Information Distributor&quot; as &quot;closer to the standard envisioned&quot;.

===Early computer models===
====Wang 3300====

Wang&#x27;s first computer, the Wang 3300, was an 8-bit integrated circuit general-purpose minicomputer designed to be the central processor for a multi-terminal time-sharing system. Byte-oriented, it also provided a number of double-byte operand memory commands. Core memory ranged from 4,096 to 65,536 bytes in 4,096-byte increments.

Development began after hiring Rick Bensene in June 1968. The product was announced in February 1969 and shipped to its first customer on March 29, 1971.

====Wang 2200====

Wang developed and marketed several lines of small computer systems for both word processing and data processing. Instead of a clear, linear progression, the product lines overlapped and, in some cases, borrowed technology from each other.

The most identifiable Wang minicomputer performing recognizable data processing was the Wang 2200, which appeared in May 1973. Unlike some other desktop computers such as the HP 9830, it had a CRT in a cabinet that also included an integrated computer-controlled compact cassette storage unit and keyboard. It was microcoded to run interpreted Wang BASIC. It was widely used in small- and medium-sized businesses worldwide; about 65,000 systems were shipped.

The original 2200 was a single-user system. The improved VP model increased performance more than tenfold and enhanced the language (renamed BASIC-2). The 2200 VP evolved into a desktop computer and larger MVP system to support up to 16 workstations and utilized commercial disk technologies that appeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The disk subsystems could be attached to up to 15 computers giving a theoretical upper limit of 240 workstations in a single cluster.

Unlike the other product lines, such as the VS and OIS (described below), Wang used value-added resellers (VARs) to customize and market 2200 systems. One such creative solution deployed dozens of 2200 systems and was developed in conjunction with Hawaii- and Hong Kong–based firm Algorithms, Inc. It provided paging (beeper) services for much of the Hong Kong market in the early 1980s.

Overshadowed by the Wang VS, the 2200 languished as a cost-effective but forgotten solution in the hands of the customers who had it. In the late 1980s, Wang revisited the 2200 series one last time, offering 2200 customers a new 2200 CS with bundled maintenance for less than customers were paying at the time just for maintenance of their aging 2200s. The 2200 CS had an Intel 386 processor, updated disk units, and other peripherals. Most 2200 customers upgraded to the 2200 CS, after which Wang did not develop or market any new 2200 products. In 1997, Wang reported having about two hundred 2200 systems still under maintenance around the world. Throughout, Wang had always offered maintenance services for the 2200.

The 2200 BASIC-2 language was ported to be compiled and run on non-Wang hardware and operating systems by at least two companies. Niakwa Inc created a product named NPL (originally named Basic-2C). Kerridge Computer, now a part of ADP, created a product named KCML. Both products support DOS, Windows, and various Unix systems. The BASIC-2 language was enhanced and extended by both companies to meet modern needs. Compared to the 2200 Wang hardware, the compiled solutions improved speed, disk space, memory, and user limits by tens to hundreds of times; although there is no Wang support for the 2200, many software applications continue to function.

During the 1970s, about 2,000 Wang 2200T computers were shipped to the USSR. Due to the Afghan war in the 1980s, US and COCOM export restrictions ended the shipment of Wang computers. The Soviets were in great need of computers. In 1981, Russian engineers at Minpribor&#x27;s Schetmash factory in Kursk reverse engineered the Wang 2200T and created a computer they named the Iskra 226. The &quot;COCOM restrictions&quot; theory, though, while popular in the West, is challenged by some Russian computer historians on the basis that development for the Iskra-226 started in 1978, two years before the Afghan war. It is also different from the Wang 2200 in its internals, being more inspired by it rather than a direct clone.

It used the same BASIC language (named T-BASIC) with a few enhancements. Many research papers reference calculations done on the Iskra 226. The machine&#x27;s designers were nominated for a 1985 State Prize. Later, a somewhat scaled-down Unix implementation was created for Iskra-226, which was used in the Soviet Union.

====Wang OIS====

Wang had a line called Alliance, which was based on the high-end OIS (140/145) hardware architecture. It had more powerful software than the OIS word processing and list processing packages. The system was Tempest certified, leading to global deployment in American embassies after the Iran hostage crisis. The Z80 platform on which Alliance ran forced it to remain as an 8-bit application in a 64 KB workstation.

==The Wang VS computer line==
The first Wang VS computer was introduced in 1977, the same year as Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s VAX; both continued for decades. The VS instruction set was compatible with the IBM System/360 series, but it did not run any System/360 system software.

===Software===
The VS operating system and all system software were built from the ground up to support interactive users as well as batch operations. The VS was aimed at the business data processing market in general and IBM in particular. While many programming languages were available, the VS was programmed in COBOL. Other languages supported in the VS integrated development environment included Assembler, COBOL 74, COBOL 85, BASIC, Ada, RPG II, C, PL/I, FORTRAN, Glossary, MABASIC, SPEED II, and Procedure (a scripting language). Pascal was also supported for I/O co-processor development. The Wang PACE (Professional Application Creation Environment) 4GL and database was used from the mid-1980s onward by customers and third-party developers to build complex applications, sometimes involving many thousands of screens, hundreds of distinct application modules, and serving many hundreds of users. Substantial vertical applications were developed for the Wang VS by third-party software houses throughout the 1980s in COBOL, PACE, BASIC, PL/I, and RPG II. The Wang OFFICE family of applications and Wang WP were both popular applications on the VS. Word Processing ran on the VS through services that emulated the OIS environment and downloaded the WP software as &quot;microcode&quot; (in Wang terminology) to VS workstations.

===Hardware===
The press and the industry referred to the class of machines made by Wang, including the VS, as &quot;minicomputers,&quot; and Kenney&#x27;s 1992 book refers to the VS line as &quot;minicomputers&quot; throughout. Although some argue that the high-end VS machines and their successors should qualify as mainframes, Wang avoided this term. In his autobiography, An Wang, rather than calling the VS 300 a mainframe, said that it &quot;verges on mainframe performance.&quot; He went on to draw the distinction between the &quot;mainframes&quot; at the high end of IBM&#x27;s line (&quot;just as Detroit would rather sell large cars ... so IBM would rather sell mainframes&quot;)—in which IBM had a virtual monopoly—with the &quot;mid-sized systems&quot; in which IBM had not achieved dominance: &quot;The minicomputer market is still healthy. This is good for the customer and good for minicomputer makers.&quot; 
* The VS7000 was introduced in 1987. These were a renumbering of the VS100 and VS300, with their more powerful counterpart upgrades identified as VS7110, VS7120, and VS7130 (for the VS100) as the new high-end machine in this series.

* Later models, the small VS5000 series, launched in 1988, were user-installable, with the smallest being similarly sized to contemporary PCs.
* The largest iteration, the VS10000, supported many users. The VS10000 used &quot;emitter coupled logic&quot; (ECL). ECL is a very fast current-based logic that necessitates the use of 375 amp, 3-volt power supplies, massive heat-sinks, and large squirrel cage blowers. The VS1000 computer drew up to ten kilowatts of power. The VS1000 was designed to run multiple concurrent operating systems and was piloted with the VS ver7 and a Unix operating system.

==Going after IBM==
An Wang felt a personal sense of rivalry with IBM, partly due to heavy-handed treatment by IBM in 1955 to 1956 over the rights to his magnetic-core patents (this encounter formed the subject of a long chapter in Wang&#x27;s own book, &quot;Lessons&quot;). According to Charles C. Kenney, &quot;Jack Connors remembers being in Wang&#x27;s office one day when the Doctor pulled out a chart on which he had plotted Wang&#x27;s growth and projected that Wang Laboratories would overtake IBM sometime in the middle of the 1990s. &#x27;He had kept it a long time,&#x27; says Connors. &#x27;And he &quot;believed&quot; it.&#x27;&quot;

Wang was one of the first computer companies to advertise on television and the first to run an ad during the Super Bowl in 1978. Their first ad literally cast Wang Laboratories as David and IBM as Goliath, several years before the famous 1984 Apple Computer ad. A later ad depicted Wang Laboratories as a helicopter gunship taking aim at IBM.

Wang wanted to compete against IBM as a computer company, selling to management information system departments. The calculators, word processing systems, and OIS were sold into individual departments, bypassing the corporate data-processing decision-makers. The chapter in Wang&#x27;s book dealing with them shows that he saw them as &quot;a beachhead in the Fortune 1000.&quot; The Wang VS was Wang&#x27;s entry into IT departments. In his book, An Wang notes that, to sell the VS, &quot;we aggressively recruited salesmen with strong backgrounds in data processing ... who had experience dealing with MIS executives, and who knew their way around Fortune 1000 companies.&quot; As the VS took hold, the word processor and OIS lines were phased out. The word processing software continued, in the form of a loadable-microcode environment that allowed VS workstations to take on the behavior of traditional Wang WP terminals to operate with the VS and use it as a document server.

Wang made inroads into IBM and DEC markets in the 1980s, but did not have a serious impact on IBM&#x27;s mainframe market due to self-limiting factors. Even though An Wang wanted to compete with IBM, too many Wang salespeople weren&#x27;t trained enough on the DP capabilities of the VS. In many instances, the VS ran smaller enterprises up to about and, in larger organizations, found use as a gateway to larger corporate mainframes, handling workstation pass-through and massive print services.

At Exxon Corporation, for instance, thirteen 1985 top-of-the-line VS300s at the Houston headquarters were used in the 1980s and into the 1990s to receive mainframe reports and make them viewable online by executives.

At Mellon Mortgage, 18 VS systems from the smallest to the largest were used as the enterprise mortgage origination, servicing, finance, documentation, hedge system and mainframe gateway services (for login and printing). Between Mellon Mortgage and parent Mellon Bank, their network contained 45 VS systems and the Bank portion of the network supported about 16,000 Wang Office users for email, report distribution, and scheduling.

At Kent and KTec Electronics, two related Houston companies, separate VS clusters were the enterprise systems, handling distribution, manufacturing, and accounting, with significant EDI capability for receiving customer forecasts, sending invoices, sending purchase orders, and receiving shipping notifications. Both systems ran the GEISCO EDI package. Kent, which grew to , ran the Arcus distribution software in COBOL and KTec, which grew to , ran the CAELUS MRP system for manufacturing in BASIC.

===Aggressive marketing===
In the late 1980s, a British television documentary accused the company of targeting a competitor, Canadian company AES Wordplex, in an attempt to take it out of the market. However, the documentary came to no conclusion regarding this.

Wang&#x27;s approach was called &quot;The Gas Cooker Program,&quot; named after similar programs to give discounts on new gas stoves by trading in an old one. Wang was accused of targeting Wordplex by offering a large discount on Wang OIS systems with a trade-in of Wordplex machines, regardless of the age or condition of the trade-in machine.

Based on its good reputation with users and its program of aggressive discounts, Wang gained an increasing share of a shrinking market. Wordplex was taken over by Norsk Data.

===Word processing market collapse===
The market for standalone word processing systems collapsed with the introduction of the personal computer. MultiMate, on the IBM PC, and MS-DOS PC clones, replicated the keyboard and screen interface and functions of the Wang word processor, and was actively marketed to Wang corporate users, while several other WYSIWYG word processing programs also became popular.

Wang did make one last play in this arena, producing a dedicated Intel-based word processor called the Wang Office Assistant in 1984. This was marketed and sold successfully in the UK to a specific few office equipment dealers who were able to upgrade their clients from electronic typewriters to the Office Assistant. They proved to be very reliable and fast when connected to the Wang bi-directional printer, providing cheap but very fast word processing to small companies (such as solicitors). The USA was surprised at the success of this machine in the UK, but could not supply a spell-check programme in time before the PC. The PC, with its flexibility of combining word processors with other programs such as spreadsheets, had rendered such a specific-task machine unsellable. The Wang Office Assistant had a short life span of four years.

==The Digital Voice Exchange==
The Wang DVX was one of the first integrated switchboard and voicemail systems. In the United Kingdom, it was selected for the DTI Office Automation pilot schemes at the National Coal Board in about 1980.

Wang, which had added DVX Message Waiting in 1984, named their 1989 announcement DVX II.

Internal research on speech recognition was carried out and implemented for discrete word recognition but was never released to the field. At one point there were 50 members of the Voice Engineering Department.

Lawrence E. Bergeron was instrumental in managing the Voice Engineering Department at Wang Labs. He promoted the purchase of a VAX-11/780 for &#x27;real-time&#x27; signal processing research and created the Peripheral Signal Processor board (PSP). The PSP was placed into 16 racks to handle 128 phone lines for the DVX (Digital Voice Exchange). Wang&#x27;s Digital Voice Exchange supported the renting of voice mailboxes. Voice prompts were created by a hired voice specialist to give a melodic presentation for the DVX. To avoid false triggering of touch-tones by the prompts (due to input/output cross talk), notch filters were created to remove the touch tone frequencies from the prompts. Prompt languages supported included German, Spanish, French, British English, American English, and Portuguese.

==PCs and PC-based products==
Despite the release of the 2200 PCS (Personal Computer System) and 2200 PCS-II models in 1976, the history of computing regards the earliest PC as one which contained a microprocessor, which the 2200 PCS did not. However, the self-contained PCS-II incorporated many of the innovations that would later be seen in PCs, including the first 5.25-inch floppy drives that were designed for the PCS-II by Shugart Associates.

===The original Wang PC===
The original Wang PC was released in April 1982 to counter the IBM PC, which had been released the previous August and which had gained wide acceptance in the market for which Wang traditionally positioned the OIS system. It was based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor, a faster CPU than the IBM PC&#x27;s 8088. A hardware/software package that permitted the Wang PC to act as a terminal to the OIS and VS products was available. The first version of the hardware component was made of two large add-in boards called the WLOC (Wang Local Office Connection). It contained a Z-80 processor and 64 KB of memory. The original PC-VS hardware used the 928 terminal emulator board; the WLOC boards were used in the subsequent 80286 machines.

These PCs later formed the basis for the system console on VS7000 and later series of the Wang mid-frame series, being used for the initialisation of the boot process. One of the distinguishing features of the Wang PC was the system software. Similar to the Wang VS minicomputer, the command line was not evident. Everything could be run from menus, including formatting a disk. Furthermore, each item on a menu could be explained by hitting a help key on the keyboard. This software was later sold in MS-DOS-compatible form for non-Wang hardware. The Wang word processing software was also very graphical. The keyboard had 16 function-keys and, unlike WordStar (the popular word processor of the day), control key combinations were not required to navigate the system. The F-keys had the word processing functions labeled on them.

Despite being a compliant MS-DOS system, it was not compatible with the IBM PC at the hardware level, because MS-DOS was used as a simple program loader. Complex software (spreadsheets, Flight Simulator, etc.) could obtain acceptable performance by direct manipulation of the hardware. Wang used a 16-bit data bus instead of the 8-bit data bus used by IBM, arguing that applications would run much faster since most operations required I/O (disk, screen, keyboard, printer). With this 16-bit design, Wang used peripheral hardware devices, such as the Wang PC display adapter, that were not compatible with their counterparts in the IBM PC line. This meant that the vast library of software available for the IBM PC could not be directly run on the Wang PC. Only those programs that were either written for the Wang PC or ported from the IBM PC were available. Lotus 1-2-3 and dBase II were also available. This lack of application software led to the original Wang PC&#x27;s end, and it was replaced by an Intel 80286-based product that was plug compatible with the IBM PC. The unique system software was available at extra cost.

Most Wang PCs were released with a monochrome graphics adapter that supported a single video mode with text and graphics planes that could be scrolled independently. A color graphics adapter and Wang-branded color monitor were also available.

An ergonomic feature of the Wang PC was the monitor arm that clamped to the desk and held the monitor above and a system clamp that attached to the side of the desk and held the rather large computer box. By using these, there was nothing on the desktop except the keyboard.

===IBM-compatible Wang PCs===

Wang released an emulation board for Wang PC that enabled operation of many PC-compatible software packages. The board accomplished this by monitoring all I/O and memory transactions (visible in those days before North/South bridge chips to any board plugged into a slot on the expansion bus) and generating a non-maskable interrupt (NMI) whenever an operation was deemed to involve an incompatible device, requiring emulation.

For example, the floppy controller circuitry on the Wang PC was similar to that of the IBM PC but involved enough design differences that PC-compatible software attempting to manipulate it directly would fail. Wang&#x27;s PC emulation hardware would detect I/O and memory operations involving the addresses associated with the floppy controller in the IBM PC and generate an NMI. The NMI handler would be activated (the exception vector having been appropriated during system init to point to ROM routines on the emulation board instead of the NMI routine in the PC BIOS) and would then update an internal representation of the IBM PC floppy controller and manipulate the real controller to reflect its state. Reads were satisfied in a similar way, by forcing an NMI, decoding the machine code indicated by the instruction pointer at the time of the fault, and then obtaining the desired info and updating the CPU registers accordingly before resuming the executing program.

IBM PC-emulation on the 8086-based Wang PC was working well when IBM released their 80286-based PC-AT, so Wang made the 80286-based Wang APC (Advanced Professional Computer).

Further iterations of the PC line were released commencing with the model number PC-240. They booted into MS-DOS or another compatible operating system, and supported ISA-standard expansion cards.

This PC-240 was still not IBM PC-standard, as the keyboard, although a standard PC/AT device, supported VS-compatibility with 24 function keys rather than the normal 12, and had a number of Wang VS-specific keys. There was also a slight difference in CPU interrupts from IBM standard, so some software had compatibility issues.

VS connectivity was via an ISA-based VS-terminal card, or via LightSpeed, the networked VS Terminal Emulator, over an IPX-based Ethernet connection. The PC-240 came with a Wang-specific Hercules Graphics Card and compatible screen, which also acted as a keyboard extension, so that the base unit could be kept some distance from the screen. This was later replaced with an EGA card and screen.

Around 1991, Wang released the PC350-16 and PC350-40, which were Intel 80386-based, clocked at 16 MHz and 40 MHz. They used the same VS-compatible keyboard as the PC-240, had a maximum of 4 megabytes of RAM, and came with VGA screens as standard. They were supplied by Microsoft with MS-DOS and Windows 3.0.

The 350-16 had a bug where the machine would freeze and not boot up if power-cycled at the mains. Although it would power on, the BIOS would not start. The solution was to turn on the machine at the mains and hold down the power button for 30 seconds, at which point it would start. It was suggested that this was due to an under-valued capacitor in the power circuit. This problem appeared to be resolved in the 350–40, which had a different PSU.

In 1992, Wang marketed a PC-compatible based on the Intel 80386SX processor, which they called the Alliance 750CD. It was clocked at 25 MHz and had a socket for an 80387 math coprocessor. It came with 2 megabytes of installed RAM, and was expandable to 16 megabytes using SIMM memory cards. It had a 1.44 megabyte floppy disk drive, an internal 80 megabyte hard disk, and a CD-ROM drive. Five expansion slots were built-in. It came with MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 operating systems.

In 1994, Wang released the slimline Alliance 750CD 80486 based PC in the United Kingdom. These machines used standard PC/AT keyboards and were IBM compatible, shipping with MSDOS 5.0 and Windows 3.11 as standard. System BIOS settings and the real-time clock were maintained by four standard AA batteries instead of a specialty battery pack or lithium battery. While offered with a 33 MHz 80486DX, the 750CD could be upgraded to later Socket 3 processors such as the 80486DX2 through the use of third party CPU upgrade adapters or interposers. This allowed upgrading to speeds beyond 50 MHz without overclocking, or more than 100 MHz with overclocking, dependent on the processor used.

===Wang Freestyle===
Wang Freestyle was a 1988 product consisting of:
* A touch-sensitive tablet and a special stylus for written annotation of any file that could be displayed on the PC.
* A phone handset for voice annotation, but not voice communication. Demonstrated with the tablet for explaining the text annotations.
* Email, via Wang OFFICE, of the resulting document set.

The pricing of the low-end product at precluded the important features such as &quot;facsimile and voice options&quot; (priced at ). &quot;Freestyle&quot; was not a success in anything except marketing terms. A description of the system at the University of Southern California (USC) shows the symptoms of the failure:

&quot;The USC system includes a VS 7150 mid-range computer; 30 image workstations, 25 with Freestyle capabilities; a laser printer; five endorsers; and five document scanners. Initial storage for document images is eight gigabytes of magnetic disk storage.&quot;

25 of the stations were Freestyle stations. The Freestyle was only affordable for highly specialized or very senior staff in Wang Laboratories. It was sold as a C-Level tool for C grades to communicate with other C Grades. This reduced the marketplace immediately from the mass market, where the system would have been effective.

==Decline and fall==
Wang Labs was one of a large number of New England–based computer companies that faltered in the late 1980s and 1990s, marking the end of the Massachusetts Miracle. For instance, the struggling Digital Equipment Corporation also downsized in the 1990s and was acquired by Compaq.

A common view within the PC community is that Wang Labs failed because it specialized in computers designed specifically for word processing and did not foresee and could not compete with general-purpose personal computers with word-processing software in the 1980s. Word processing was not actually the mainstay of Wang&#x27;s business by the time desktop computers began to gain in popularity. Although Wang manufactured desktops, its main business by the 1980s was its VS line of minicomputer and &quot;midframe&quot; systems. The market for these minicomputers was conquered by enhanced microcomputers like the Apple Macintosh and the Wintel PC and Sun, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard servers.

An Wang&#x27;s insistence that his sons, Frederick and Courtney, would succeed him contributed to the company&#x27;s failure. Fred Wang was a business school graduate, &quot;but by almost any definition&quot;, wrote Charles C. Kenney, &quot;unsuited for the job in which his father had placed him.&quot; His assignment, first as head of research and development, then as president of the company, led to resignations by key R&amp;D and business personnel. Amid declining revenues, John F. Cunningham, an 18-year employee of the firm, resigned as president and COO of Wang Labs to become chairman and chief executive of Computer Consoles Inc. Cunningham resigned due to disagreement with An Wang on how to pull the company out of the slump, as well as being upset that Fred Wang was positioned, nepotistically, as An Wang&#x27;s successor.

One turning point occurred when Fred Wang was head of R&amp;D. On October 4, 1983, Wang Laboratories announced fourteen major hardware and software products and promised dates of delivery. The announcement was well received, but even at the time, there were warning signs. According to &quot;Datamation&quot;, Wang announced &quot;. And if you could attach the kitchen sink to a personal computer, they would announce that too.&quot; Very few of the products were close to completion, and many of them had not even been started. All were delivered late, if at all. In retrospect, this was referred to as the &quot;vaporware announcement,&quot; and it hurt the credibility of Fred Wang and Wang Laboratories.

In 1986, Fred Wang, then 36 years old, was installed as president and chief operating officer of Wang Laboratories. However, the company&#x27;s fortunes continued to decline, although Charles Kenney &quot;did not lay the failure at Fred&#x27;s feet, but his father&#x27;s, saying his father leaned too hard on family considering the sophistication of the company&quot;, as the market underwent great upheaval where minicomputers gave way to microcomputers. Unlike most computer companies that funded their growth by issuing stock, An Wang had used debt to avoid further dilution of family control of the company. By August 1989, that debt was causing conflicts with its creditors. On August 4, 1989, An Wang requested Fred&#x27;s resignation, although Fred remained a member of the board of directors. Harry H.S. Chou, a vice chairman and director of the international computer maker, became acting president and served in that role until Richard W. Miller, who had been with the company since 1988, was named president of Wang Laboratories. Fred went on to attend the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, planning a new career in public service. While Courtney, An Wang&#x27;s younger son, still remained with the company and had ambitions to eventually take over, he was only &quot;a 33-year-old branch manager in the Dallas office and hardly a major player&quot;, plus Miller&#x27;s contract &quot;stipulated that he would never be subordinate to anyone at Wang Labs other than Dr. Wang.&quot;.

Miller announced in December 1989 that the company would start to embrace established software standards rather than use traditional proprietary designs. An Wang died in March 1990, and Miller took on the additional posts of chairman and CEO. The company underwent massive restructuring and layoffs and eliminated its bank debt in August 1990, but it still ended the year with a record net loss.

In November 1990, Wang announced their first personal computers running Unix. In 1987, Wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with Arlington, MA–based Texet Corp. The system used Xerox printers and UNIX workstations from Sun, but the product vanished before coming to market, because few Wang employees could use or support UNIX. UNIX ran on the VSInteractive Systems first ported IN/ix (their IBM 360 version of SYS5 UNIX) to run in a VSOS Virtual machine circa 1985, and then Wang engineers completed the port so that it ran &quot;native&quot; on the VS hardware soon thereafterbut performance was always sub-par as UNIX was never a good fit for the batch-mode nature of the VS hardware, and the line-at-a-time processing approach taken by the VS workstations; indeed, the workstation code had to be rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to be sent back to the host when running UNIX so that &quot;tty&quot; style processing could be implemented. PACE, which offered its data dictionary, excellent referential integrity, and speedy application development, was in the process of being ported to UNIX under the name OPEN Pace. A client-server RDBMS model built on the original product&#x27;s ideology, OPEN Pace was demonstrated at the North American PACE User Group Conferences in both Boston and Chicago. OPEN Pace, along with a new Windows-based word processor called UpWord (which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake Wang&#x27;s original market leadership from Microsoft), were touted as their new direction. However, after a marketing study suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against Microsoft, both products were abandoned.

Ira Magaziner, who was brought in by Miller in 1990, proposed to take Wang out of the manufacture of computers altogether, and to go big into imaging software instead. In March 1991, the company introduced its Office 2000 marketing strategy, focusing on office productivity.

In June 1991, Wang started reselling IBM computers, in exchange for IBM investing in Wang stock. Wang hardware strategy to re-sell IBM RS/6000s also included further pursuit of UNIX software.

In August 1991, Wang won a suit against NEC and Toshiba claiming violation of Wang&#x27;s patents on single in-line memory modules (SIMMs). The company still recorded a net loss for the 1991 fiscal year.

Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection on August 18, 1992, at a time when the company&#x27;s attempted concession from proprietary to open systems was deemed by some analysts as &quot;too little and too late.&quot;

==Final years==

Wang Labs emerged from bankruptcy on September 20, 1993. As part of its bankruptcy reorganization, the company&#x27;s iconic headquarters, Wang Towers in Lowell, was sold at auction. The complex, which cost $60 million to build and housed 4,500 workers in over a million square feet (100,000 m2) of office space, was sold in 1994 for $525,000. The renovated complex, which is now known as Cross Point, was sold in 1998 to a joint venture of Yale Properties and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors for a price reported to be over $100 million.

The company emerged from bankruptcy with $200 million in hand and embarked on a course of acquisition and self-reinvention, eschewing its former role as an innovative designer and manufacturer of computers and related systems. Later in the 1990s, and under the guidance of then CEO Joe Tucci, with the acquisition of the Olsy division of Olivetti, the company changed its name to Wang Global. By then, Wang had settled on &quot;network services&quot; as its chosen business.

The most advanced VS system, capable of supporting over 1,000 usersthe VS18000 Model 950was released in 1999, and smaller models based on the same CPU chip were released in 2000the VS6760 and the VS6780. These were the last VS-based hardware systems.

Kodak acquired the Wang Software arm in 1997, strengthening its position in the then-booming document imaging and workflow market.

In 1999, Wang Global, by then back up to $3.5 billion in annual revenues, was acquired by Getronics of The Netherlands, a $1.5 billion network services company active only in parts of Europe and Australia. Joe Tucci departed Wang after the acquisition. Wang Labs then became Getronics North America.

In 2005, Getronics announced New VS (VSGX), a product designed to run the VS operating system and all VS software on Intel 80x86 and IBM POWER machines under Linux or Unix, using a hardware abstraction layer. The product was a joint commercial effort of Getronics and TransVirtual Systems, developers of the Wang VS virtualization technology that makes the New VS possible. VS software can be run under New VS without program or data conversion. The New VS combines configured mainstream PC or PowerPC server hardware running virtualization software. It is interoperable with SCSI-based Wang VS tape and disk drives, which provide a means of restoring VS files from standard backup tapes or copying VS disk drives. Wang networking and clustering are supported over TCP/IP.

In 2007, Getronics operations worldwide were divided and sold to companies in respective local geographies. Dutch telecommunications operator KPN acquired Getronics in North America and some parts of Europe. In July 2008, Getronics North America (now an arm of KPN) announced the ending of support for the legacy VS line as existing contracts expired, and that TransVirtual Systems would be exclusive reseller of the New VS platform. In August 2008, KPN sold Getronics North America to CompuCom of Dallas, Texas.

The Wang VS product line, not actively marketed since the 1993 bankruptcy and a tiny portion of the Getronics business, survived in use into the 21st century; by 2006, about 1,000 to 2,000 systems remained in service worldwide. In 2014, CompuCom announced that all support for legacy VS systems would cease at the end of 2014, while support for New VS systems would continue through TransVirtual Systems.

<text>Anne Spencer Morrow Lindbergh (June 22, 1906 – February 7, 2001) was an American writer and aviator. She was the wife of decorated pioneer aviator Charles Lindbergh, with whom she made many exploratory flights.

Raised in Englewood, New Jersey, and later New York City, Anne Morrow graduated from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, in 1928. She married Charles in 1929, and in 1930 became the first woman to receive a U.S. glider pilot license. Throughout the early 1930s, she served as radio operator and copilot to Charles on multiple exploratory flights and aerial surveys. Following the 1932 kidnapping and murder of their first-born infant child, Anne and Charles moved to Europe in 1935 to escape the American press and hysteria surrounding the case, where their views shifted during the preliminary time of World War II towards an alleged sympathy for Nazi Germany and a concern for the United States&#x27; ability to compete with Germany in the war with their opposing air power. When they returned to America in 1939, the couple supported the isolationist America First Committee before ultimately expressing public support for the U.S. war effort after the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and subsequent German declaration of war against the United States.

After the war, she moved away from politics and wrote extensive poetry and nonfiction that helped the Lindberghs regain their reputation, which had been greatly damaged since the days leading up to the war. She authored the popular &quot;Gift from the Sea&quot; (1955), and became an inspirational figure for many American women. According to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, the book was one of the top nonfiction bestsellers of the 1950s. After suffering a series of strokes throughout the 1990s that left her disoriented and disabled, Anne died in 2001 at the age of 94.

==Early life==
Anne Spencer Morrow was born on June 22, 1906, in Englewood, New Jersey. Her father was Dwight Morrow, a partner in J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., who became United States Ambassador to Mexico and United States Senator from New Jersey. Her mother, Elizabeth Cutter Morrow, was a poet and teacher, active in women&#x27;s education, who served as acting president of her alma mater Smith College.

Anne was the second of four children; her siblings were Elisabeth Reeve, Dwight, Jr., and Constance. The children were raised in a Calvinist household that fostered achievement. Every night, Morrow&#x27;s mother would read to her children for an hour. The children quickly learned to read and write, began reading to themselves, and began writing poetry and diaries. Anne would later benefit from that routine, eventually publishing her later diaries to critical acclaim.

She first attended the Dwight School for Girls in Englewood. After graduating from The Chapin School in New York City in 1924, where she was president of the student body, she attended Smith College from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1928.

She received the Elizabeth Montagu Prize, for her essay on women of the 18th century such as Madame d&#x27;Houdetot, and the Mary Augusta Jordan Literary Prize, for her fictional piece &quot;Lida Was Beautiful&quot;.

==Marriage and family==
Morrow and Lindbergh met on December 21, 1927, in Mexico City. Her father, Lindbergh&#x27;s financial adviser at J. P. Morgan and Co., invited him to Mexico to advance relations between it and the United States.

At the time, Anne Morrow was a shy 21-year-old senior at Smith College. Lindbergh was a famous aviator whose solo flight across the Atlantic made him a hero of immense proportions. The sight of the boyish aviator, who was staying with the Morrows, tugged at Morrow&#x27;s heartstrings. She would write in her diary:
They were married in a private ceremony on May 27, 1929, at the home of her parents in Englewood, New Jersey.

That same year, Anne Lindbergh flew solo for the first time and in 1930 she became the first American woman to earn a first-class glider pilot&#x27;s license. In the 1930s Charles and Anne explored and charted air routes between continents together, Charles as pilot and Anne as radio (Morse code) operator. The Lindberghs explored polar air routes from North America to Asia and Europe, and were the first to fly from Africa to South America.

Their first child, Charles Jr., was born on Anne&#x27;s 24th birthday, June 22, 1930.

==Kidnapping of son==

On March 1, 1932, the Lindberghs&#x27; first child, 20-month-old Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., was kidnapped from their home, Highfields, in East Amwell, New Jersey, outside Hopewell. Local police began their first search outside the Lindbergh home and found two clear sets of footprints, one leading southeast towards a ladder believed to have been used in the abduction. After the discovery of the ladder, police turned their attention inside the home and searched the nursery. Before calling the police, Lindbergh had found a plain white envelope on the windowsill and, believing it was a ransom note, left it there for the police to examine. Corporal Frank Kelly, an expert in crime-scene photography and fingerprints, was part of the group investigating the child&#x27;s disappearance. On the envelope, a smudged fingerprint was discovered. Inside the envelope was a detailed ransom note from the kidnapper, demanding $50,000 in cash. The evidence was sent to the state official in charge, Major Schoeffel.

After a massive investigation, a baby&#x27;s body presumed to be that of Charles Lindbergh Jr. was discovered on May 12, 1932, approximately four miles (6.5 km) from the Lindbergh home, at the summit of a hill on the Hopewell–Mt. Rose highway.

==Retreat to Europe==
The press paid frenzied attention to the Lindberghs after the kidnapping of their son and the trial, conviction, and execution of Richard Hauptmann for the crime. This—and threats and press harassment of their second son Jon—prompted the family to retreat to the United Kingdom, to a house called Long Barn owned by Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West, and later to the small island of Illiec, off the coast of Brittany in France.

While in Europe during the 1930s, the Lindberghs came to advocate isolationist views and an opposition to American involvement in the impending European conflict, which led to their fall from grace in the eyes of many and widespread suspicion that the couple might be Nazi sympathizers. There exists evidence to support that Anne was an admirer of Hitler and shared many of her husband&#x27;s anti-immigrant and antisemitic views. Anne Morrow&#x27;s work was part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.

==Return to U.S.==
In April 1939, the Lindberghs returned to the United States. Because of his outspoken beliefs about a future war that would envelop their homeland, the antiwar America First Committee quickly adopted Charles as its leader in 1940.

In 1940, Anne published a 41-page booklet, &quot;The Wave of the Future: A Confession of Faith&quot;, which &quot;swiftly became the No. 1 nonfiction bestseller in the country.&quot; Writing in support of her husband&#x27;s lobbying efforts for a U.S.-German peace treaty similar to Hitler&#x27;s Non-Aggression Treaty with Joseph Stalin, Anne argued that the rise of fascism and communism in Germany, Italy, and Russia were manifestations of an inevitable historical &quot;wave of the future&quot;, though &quot;the evils we deplore in these systems are not in themselves the future; they are scum on the wave of the future.&quot; She compared these movements to the French Revolution for their deplorable violence, but also for their &quot;fundamental necessity&quot;. She therefore urged the futility of any ideological war against them. Her writing echoed authors such as Lawrence Dennis and presaged that of James Burnham.

The Roosevelt administration subsequently attacked &quot;The Wave of the Future&quot; as, in an April 1941 speech by Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, &quot;the bible of every American Nazi, Fascist, Bundist and Appeaser&quot;, and the booklet became one of the most despised writings of the period; in December 1940, E.B. White published a much-read and much-quoted critique in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that &quot;systematically attacked the logic of its argument.&quot; Anne had also written in a letter that Hitler was &quot;a very great man, like an inspired religious leader—and as such rather fanatical—but not scheming, not selfish, not greedy for power&quot;.

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Germany&#x27;s declaration of war against the U.S., the America First Committee disbanded, and Charles eventually managed to become involved in the military and enter combat only as a civilian consultant, flying 50 missions in this role and even shooting down an enemy aircraft. 

In this period, Anne met the French writer, poet and pioneering aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, author of the novella &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. Though Anne found &quot;St-Ex&quot; attractive, the two did not have a secret affair, as is sometimes erroneously reported.

After Charles Jr., the Lindberghs had five more children: sons Jon, Land, and Scott, and daughters Anne and Reeve.

==Later years and death==

After the war, Anne wrote books that helped the Lindberghs rebuild the reputations which they had lost before World War II. The publication of &quot;Gift from the Sea&quot; in 1955 earned her place as &quot;one of the leading advocates of the nascent environmental movement&quot; and became a national bestseller.

Over the course of their 45-year marriage, the Lindberghs lived in New Jersey, New York, the United Kingdom, France, Maine, Michigan, Connecticut, Switzerland, and Hawaii. Charles died on the island of Maui in 1974.

According to one biographer, Anne had a three-year affair in the early 1950s with her personal doctor.

According to Rudolf Schröck, author of &quot;Das Doppelleben des Charles A. Lindbergh&quot; (&quot;The Double Life of Charles A. Lindbergh&quot;), Anne was unaware that Charles had led a double life from 1957 until his death in 1974. His affair with Munich hat maker Brigitte Hesshaimer produced three children whom he supported financially. After Hesshaimer&#x27;s passing in 2003, DNA tests conducted by the University of Munich proved that her three children were fathered by Lindbergh. Schröck reported that Brigitte&#x27;s sister Marietta also bore him two sons. Lindbergh had two more children with his former private secretary. A family reconciliation with the German family members later took place with Reeve Lindbergh being actively involved.

After suffering a series of strokes that left her confused and disabled in the early 1990s, Anne continued to live in her home in Connecticut with the assistance of round-the-clock caregivers. During a visit to her daughter Reeve&#x27;s family in 1999, she came down with pneumonia, after which she went to live near Reeve in a small home built on Reeve&#x27;s Passumpsic, Vermont, farm, where Anne died in 2001 at 94, following another stroke. Reeve Lindbergh&#x27;s book, &quot;No More Words&quot;, tells the story of her mother&#x27;s last years.

==Honors and awards==
Anne received numerous honors and awards throughout her life in recognition of her contributions to both literature and aviation. In 1933, she received the U.S. Flag Association Cross of Honor for having taken part in surveying transatlantic air routes. The following year, she was awarded the Hubbard Medal by the National Geographic Society for having completed of exploratory flying with her husband, Charles Lindbergh, a feat that took them to five continents. In 1993, Women in Aerospace presented her with an Aerospace Explorer Award in recognition of her achievements in and contributions to the aerospace field.

She was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame (1979), the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame (1996), the Aviation Hall of Fame of New Jersey, and the International Women in Aviation Pioneer Hall of Fame (1999).

Her first book, &quot;North to the Orient&quot; (1935) won one of the inaugural National Book Awards: the Most Distinguished General Nonfiction of 1935, voted by the American Booksellers Association.

Her second book, &quot;Listen! The Wind&quot; (1938), won the same award in its fourth year after the Nonfiction category had subsumed Biography. She received the Christopher Award for &quot;War Within and Without&quot;, the last installment of her published diaries.

In addition to being the recipient of honorary master&#x27;s and doctor of letters degrees from her alma mater Smith College (1935 and 1970), Anne received honorary degrees from Amherst College (1939), the University of Rochester (1939), Middlebury College (1976), and Gustavus Adolphus College (1985).

<text>William Henry Mauldin (; October 29, 1921 – January 22, 2003) was an American editorial cartoonist who won two Pulitzer Prizes for his work. He was most famous for his World War II cartoons depicting American soldiers, as represented by the archetypal characters Willie and Joe, two weary and bedraggled infantry troopers who stoically endure the difficulties and dangers of duty in the field. His cartoons were popular with soldiers throughout Europe, and with civilians in the United States as well. However, his second Pulitzer Prize was for a cartoon published in 1958, and possibly his best-known cartoon was after the Kennedy assassination.

==Early life==
Mauldin was born in Mountain Park, New Mexico, into a family with a tradition of military service. His father, Sidney Albert Mauldin (né Bissell, but adopted after being orphaned) served as an artilleryman in World War I. Bill&#x27;s grandfather by way of his father&#x27;s adoption, for whom Bill was named, had been a civilian scout in the Apache Wars. After his parents&#x27; divorce, Bill and his older brother Sidney moved to Phoenix, Arizona in 1937 and attended Phoenix Union High School. It was there that he began his career in editorial journalismwriting for PUHS&#x27;s &quot;Coyote Journal&quot;. Bill did not graduate with his class (he was later granted a diploma in 1945) and in 1939 he took courses at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts where he studied political cartooning with Vaughn Shoemaker. While in Chicago, Mauldin met Will Lang Jr. and became fast friends with him. Lang Jr. later became a journalist and a bureau head for &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

==World War II==
Shortly after returning to Phoenix in 1940, Mauldin enlisted in Company D, 120th Quartermaster Regiment, of the Arizona National Guard, at Phoenix, Arizona. His division, the 45th Infantry Division, was federalized just two days later. While in the 45th, Mauldin volunteered to work for the unit&#x27;s newspaper, drawing cartoons about regular soldiers or &quot;dogfaces&quot;. Eventually he created two cartoon infantrymen, Willie and Joe, who represented the average American GI.
During July 1943, Mauldin&#x27;s cartoon work continued when, as a sergeant of the 45th Infantry Division&#x27;s press corps, he landed with the division in the invasion of Sicily and later in the Italian campaign. Mauldin began working for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, the American soldiers&#x27; newspaper; as well as the &quot;45th Division News&quot;, until he was officially transferred to the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; in February 1944. Egbert White, editor of the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, encouraged Mauldin to syndicate his cartoons and helped him find an agent. By March 1944, he was given his own jeep, in which he roamed the front, collecting material. He published six cartoons a week. His cartoons were viewed by soldiers throughout Europe during World War II, and were also published in the United States. The War Office supported their syndication, not only because they helped publicize the ground forces but also to show the grim side of war, which helped show that victory would not be easy. While in Europe, Mauldin befriended a fellow soldier-cartoonist, Gregor Duncan, and was assigned to escort him for a time. (Duncan was killed at Anzio in May 1944.)
Mauldin was not without his detractors. His images—which often parodied the Army&#x27;s spit-shine and obedience-to-orders-without-question policy—offended some officers. After a Mauldin cartoon ridiculed Third Army commander General George Patton&#x27;s decree that all soldiers be clean-shaven at all times—even in combat—Patton called Mauldin an &quot;unpatriotic anarchist&quot; and threatened to &quot;throw [his] ass in jail&quot; and ban &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; from his command. General Dwight Eisenhower, Patton&#x27;s superior, told Patton to leave Mauldin alone; he felt the cartoons gave the soldiers an outlet for their frustrations. &quot;&quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; is the soldiers&#x27; paper,&quot; he told him, &quot;and we won&#x27;t interfere.&quot;

In a 1989 interview, Mauldin said, &quot;I always admired Patton. Oh, sure, the stupid bastard was crazy. He was insane. He thought he was living in the Dark Ages. Soldiers were peasants to him. I didn&#x27;t like that attitude, but I certainly respected his theories and the techniques he used to get his men out of their foxholes.&quot;

Mauldin&#x27;s cartoons made him a hero to the common soldier. GIs often credited him with helping them to get through the rigors of the war. His credibility with the troops increased in September 1943, when he was wounded in the shoulder by a German mortar while visiting a machine gun crew near Monte Cassino. By the end of the war, he received the Legion of Merit for his cartoons. Mauldin wanted Willie and Joe to be killed on the last day of combat, but &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; dissuaded him.

==Postwar activities==
In 1945, at the age of 23, Mauldin won a Pulitzer Prize for his wartime body of work, exemplified by a cartoon depicting exhausted infantrymen slogging through the rain, its caption mocking a typical late-war headline: &quot;Fresh, spirited American troops, flushed with victory, are bringing in thousands of hungry, ragged, battle-weary prisoners&quot;. The first civilian compilation of his work, &quot;Up Front&quot;, a collection of his cartoons interwoven with his observations of war, topped the best-seller list in 1945. After the war&#x27;s end, the character of Willie was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine for the June 18, 1945, issue. Mauldin made the cover of the July 21, 1961, issue.

After the war, Mauldin turned to drawing political cartoons expressing a generally civil libertarian view associated with groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union. These were not well received by newspaper editors, who were hoping for apolitical cartoons. Mauldin&#x27;s attempt to carry Willie and Joe into civilian life was also unsuccessful, as documented in his memoir &quot;Back Home&quot; in 1947. In 1951, he appeared with Audie Murphy in the John Huston film &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;, and in Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;Teresa&quot;.

In 1956, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States Congress as a Democrat in New York&#x27;s 28th congressional district. Mauldin said about his run for Congress: 
I jumped in with both feet and campaigned for seven or eight months. I found myself stumping around up in these rural districts and my own background did hurt there. A farmer knows a farmer when he sees one. So when I was talking about their problems I was a very sincere candidate, but when they would ask me questions that had to do with foreign policy or national policy, obviously I was pretty far to the left of the mainstream up there. Again, I&#x27;m an old Truman Democrat, I&#x27;m not that far left, but by their lives I was pretty far left.
In 1959, Mauldin won a second Pulitzer Prize, while working at the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, for a cartoon depicting Soviet author Boris Pasternak in a Gulag, asking another prisoner, &quot;I won the Nobel Prize for literature. What was your crime?&quot; Pasternak had won the Nobel Prize for his novel &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, but was not allowed to travel to Sweden to accept it. The following year Mauldin won the National Cartoonist Society Award for Editorial Cartooning. In 1961, he received their Reuben Award as well.

In addition to cartooning, Mauldin worked as a freelance writer. He also illustrated many articles for &quot;Life&quot; magazine, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, and other publications. He brought back Joe as a war correspondent, writing letters to the stateside Willie. He made cartoons of Willie and Joe together only in tributes to the &quot;soldiers&#x27; generals&quot;: Omar Bradley and George C. Marshall, after their deaths; for a &quot;Life&quot; article on the &quot;New Army&quot;; and as a salute to the late cartoonist Milton Caniff.
In 1962, Mauldin moved to the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. One of his most famous post-war cartoons was published in 1963, following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It depicted the statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial, with his head in his hands.

On 7 February 1965, while visiting his son who was serving with the U.S. Army at Camp Holloway, South Vietnam Mauldin was present for the Vietcong Attack on Camp Holloway.

In 1969, Mauldin was commissioned by the National Safety Council to illustrate its annual booklet on traffic safety. These pamphlets were regularly issued without copyright, but for this issue the council noted that Mauldin&#x27;s cartoons were under copyright, although the rest of the pamphlet was not.

In 1985, Mauldin won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism. Mauldin remained with the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; until his retirement in 1991.

He was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame on May 19, 1991. On September 19, 2001, Sergeant Major of the Army Jack L. Tilley presented Mauldin with a personal letter from Army Chief of Staff General Eric K. Shinseki, and a hardbound book with notes from other senior Army leaders and several celebrities, including TV broadcasters Walter Cronkite and Tom Brokaw, and actor Tom Hanks. Tilley also promoted Mauldin to the honorary rank of first sergeant.

==Death and legacy==
Mauldin died on January 22, 2003, from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and complications of injuries received in an accidental bathtub scalding. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on January 29, 2003. Married three times, he was survived by seven children.

On March 31, 2010, the United States Post Office released a first-class denomination ($0.44) postage stamp in Mauldin&#x27;s honor depicting him with Willie &amp; Joe. In June, 2000 Mauldin was inducted into the Oklahoma Military Hall of Fame.

In 2005, Mauldin was inducted into the Oklahoma Cartoonists Hall of Fame in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, by Michael Vance. The Oklahoma Cartoonists Collection, created by Vance, is located in the Toy and Action Figure Museum.

In April 2008, Fantagraphics Books released a two-volume set of Mauldin&#x27;s complete wartime Willie and Joe cartoons, edited by Todd DePastino, titled &quot;Willie &amp; Joe: The WWII Years&quot; (). A collection of post-war cartoons, &quot;Willie &amp; Joe: Back Home&quot;, was published by Fantagraphics in August, 2011 ().

==&quot;Peanuts&quot;==
From 1969 to 1998, cartoonist Charles M. Schulz (a veteran of World War II) regularly paid tribute to Bill Mauldin in his &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip on Veterans Day. In the strips, Snoopy, dressed as an army vet, would annually go to Mauldin&#x27;s house to &quot;quaff a few root beers and tell war stories.&quot; By the end of the strip, Schulz had depicted 17 of Snoopy&#x27;s visits. Schulz went so far as to include Willie and Joe in a 1998 strip, using a picture of the characters that had been copied out of a 1944 Mauldin panel. Peanuts also paid tribute to Rosie the Riveter in 1976, and Ernie Pyle in 1997 and 1999.

==Filmography==
The films &quot;Up Front&quot; (1951) and &quot;Back at the Front&quot; (1952) were based on Mauldin&#x27;s Willie and Joe characters; however, when Mauldin&#x27;s suggestions were ignored in favor of making a slapstick comedy, he returned his advising fee; he said he had never seen the result.

Mauldin also appeared as an actor in the 1951 films &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; and &quot;Teresa&quot;, and as himself in the 1998 documentary &quot;America in the &#x27;40s&quot;. He also appeared in on-screen interviews in the Thames documentary &quot;The World at War&quot;.

<doc id="173599" wikidata="Q272805" url="?curid=173599" title="Mephistopheles">
<text>Mephistopheles (, ), also known as Mephisto, is a demon featured in German folklore. He originally appeared in literature as the demon in the Faust legend and has since become a stock character appearing in other works of arts and popular culture.

==Etymology and name meaning==
The name &quot;Mephistopheles&quot; is a corrupted Greek compound.
The Greek particle of negation (μή, &quot;mē&quot;) and the Greek word for &quot;love&quot; or &quot;loving&quot; (φίλος, &quot;philos&quot;) are the first and last terms of the compound, but the middle term is more doubtful. Three possible meanings have been proposed, and three different etymologies have been offered:
*&quot;not loving light&quot; (φῶς, &quot;phōs&quot;; the old form of the name being &quot;Mephostopheles&quot;)
*&quot;not loving Faust&quot;
*&quot;,&quot; pertaining to poisonous vapors arising from pools, caverns, and springs.

It is likely that the name was invented for the historical alchemist Johann Georg Faust by the anonymous author of the first &quot;Faustbuch&quot; (published 1587).

==In the Faust legend==


Mephistopheles is associated with the Faust legend of an ambitious scholar, based on the historical Johann Georg Faust. In the legend, Faust makes a deal with the devil at the price of his soul, Mephistopheles acting as the devil&#x27;s agent.

The name appears in the late-sixteenth-century Faust chapbooks – stories concerning the life of Johann Georg Faust, written by an anonymous German author.

In the 1725 version, which Goethe read, &quot;Mephostophiles&quot; is a devil in the form of a greyfriar summoned by Faust in a wood outside Wittenberg.

From the chapbooks, the name entered Faustian literature. Many authors have used it, from Goethe to Christopher Marlowe. In the 1616 edition of Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus&quot;, &quot;Mephostophiles&quot; became &quot;Mephistophilis&quot;.

Mephistopheles in later treatments of the Faust material frequently figures as a title character: in Meyer Lutz&#x27;s &quot;Mephistopheles, or Faust and Marguerite&quot; (1855), Arrigo Boito&#x27;s &quot;Mefistofele&quot; (1868), Klaus Mann&#x27;s &quot;Mephisto&quot;, and Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Mephisto Waltzes&quot;. There are also many parallels with the character of Mephistopheles and the character Lord Henry Wotton in &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; by Oscar Wilde.

==Interpretations==
Although Mephistopheles appears to Faustus as a demon – a worker for Lucifer – critics claim that he does not search for men to corrupt, but comes to serve and ultimately collect the souls of those who are already damned. Farnham explains, &quot;Nor does Mephistophiles first appear to Faustus as a devil who walks up and down on earth to tempt and corrupt any man encountered. He appears because he senses in Faustus&#x27; magical summons that Faustus is already corrupt, that indeed he is already &#x27;in danger to be damned&#x27;.&quot;

Mephistopheles is already trapped in his own Hell by serving the Devil. He warns Faustus of the choice he is making by &quot;selling his soul&quot; to the devil: &quot;Mephistophilis, an agent of Lucifer, appears and at first advises Faust not to forego the promise of heaven to pursue his goals&quot;. Farnham adds to his theory, &quot;...[Faustus] enters an ever-present private hell like that of Mephistophiles&quot;.

==Outside the Faust legend==
William Shakespeare mentions &quot;Mephistophilus&quot; in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (Act I, Scene I, line 128), and by the 17th century the name became independent of the Faust legend.

<doc id="173601" wikidata="Q2741407" url="?curid=173601" title="The White Plague">
<text>The White Plague is a 1982 science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert about an engineered disease which kills only women. It was nominated for a best science fiction novel Locus Award in 1983.

==Plot==
On May 20, 1996, an IRA terrorist car bomb explodes, killing the wife and children of molecular biologist John Roe O&#x27;Neill. Driven halfway insane by his loss, his mind fragments into several personalities that carry out his plan for him. O&#x27;Neill plans a gendercidal revenge and creates a plague that kills only women, but for which men are the carriers. O&#x27;Neill then releases it in Ireland (for supporting the IRA), England (for their actions in Ireland and giving the IRA a cause), and Libya (for training said terrorists); he demands that the governments of the world send all citizens of those countries back to their countries, and that they quarantine those countries and let the plague run its course, so they will lose what he has lost; if they do not, he has more plagues to release.

After releasing the plague, O&#x27;Neill goes to Ireland to hide, planning to offer his services as a molecular biologist in the hopes of sabotaging whatever work is done there on finding a cure. When he arrives in Ireland, investigatory agencies suspect his true identity as the instigator of the plague. To travel to the lab at Killaloe, he is forced to walk with a priest, a boy who has taken a vow of silence due to the death of his mother, and Joseph Herity, the IRA bomber who detonated the explosive that killed O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s wife and children; their purpose is to confirm his identity, either through Herity&#x27;s indirect questioning, or the possibility that he will confess to the priest when confronted with the pain his revenge has caused for the boy.

Meanwhile, law and order have broken down in England and Ireland, and the old Irish ways are coming back. Local IRA thugs appoint themselves &quot;kings of old&quot;, and others recreate ancient Celtic religions centered on the rowan tree. The IRA has effective control of Ireland, but as the governments of the world grow certain that O&#x27;Neill is there and essentially in custody, they consider wiping out the three targeted countries to end the lingering threat.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The White Plague&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #41, and stated that &quot;There&#x27;s plenty of edge-of-the-seat suspense and good thumping melodrama in the race to crack the gene-structure of the plague while a few women are still left alive.&quot;

&quot;The White Plague&quot; was nominated for a Locus Award for best science fiction novel in 1983, but lost to Isaac Asimov&#x27;s novel &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot;.

<doc id="173602" wikidata="Q2074934" url="?curid=173602" title="Lowell National Historical Park">
<text>Lowell National Historical Park is a National Historical Park of the United States located in Lowell, Massachusetts. Established in 1978 a few years after Lowell Heritage State Park, it is operated by the National Park Service and comprises a group of different sites in and around the city of Lowell related to the era of textile manufacturing in the city during the Industrial Revolution. In 2019, the park was included as Massachusetts&#x27; representative in the America the Beautiful Quarters series.

==History==
:&quot;See the History of Lowell, Massachusetts article for a detailed history of the city&quot;

First settled by Europeans in the 17th century, East Chelmsford (later renamed Lowell in honor of the founders&#x27; deceased business partner) became an important manufacturing center along the Merrimack River in the early 1820s. It was seen as an attractive site for the construction of a planned industrial city, with the Middlesex Canal (completed in 1803) linking the Merrimack to the Charles River, which flows through Boston, and with the powerful 32&#x27; Pawtucket Falls. The already existent Pawtucket Canal, designed for transportation around the Pawtucket Falls on the Merrimack, became the feeder canal for a 5.6-mile long system of power canals based around the falls. Unlike many other mill towns, however, Lowell&#x27;s manufacturing facilities were built based on a &quot;planned community&quot; design. Specifically Lowell was planned as reaction to the mill communities in Great Britain, which were perceived as cramped and inhumane. Some called it the &quot;Lowell Experiment&quot;, which was an attempt at creating a manufacturing center with a combination of production efficiency with democratic morals and social structure.

Initially the factories of Lowell were built with ample green space and accompanying clean dormitories, in a style that anticipated such later architectural trends as the City Beautiful movement in the 1890s. Lowell attracted both immigrants from abroad and migrants from within New England and Quebec (including a large proportion of young women, known as Lowell mill girls) who lived in the dormitories and worked in the mills.

The textile industry in New England experienced a sharp decline after World War II and by the 1960s, many of the Lowell&#x27;s textile mill buildings were abandoned. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, several important forces came together from which emerged the Lowell National Historical Park. Congressman F. Bradford Morse assisted in the city&#x27;s selection for &quot;Model Cities&quot; status; Brendan Fleming, UMass Lowell (UML) Math Department faculty member, after his election to the Lowell City Council proposed the first Historic District &quot;The Mill and Canal District&quot; which was approved in 1972; Gordon Marker, executive director of Model Cities and an urban planner, was instrumental in designing the concept for an Urban Park based on Historic Preservation and Economic Revitalization; Patrick Mogan, Education Administrator and later Superintendent of Schools, was primarily interested in Lowell&#x27;s children and strongly advocated the preservation and sharing of their cultural experiences; and the Lowell Historical Society which opened the Lowell Museum in 1976. Together these circles of interest became a collaborating force led by United States Senator and Lowell native Paul Tsongas to enact legislation for a national park. In 1978, the United States Congress established the Lowell National Historical Park, the Lowell Historic Preservation District, and the Lowell Historic Preservation Commission.

In 1990, The Trust for Public Land assisted the National Park Service in acquiring 3 acres for the purpose of housing the headquarters for the Lowell National Historical Park.

==Legislative history of Lowell==
Lowell National Historic Park was established by the Lowell Establishment Act in 1978. Lowell National Historical Park was established due to its significant cultural and historical sites and structures. This significance of these cultural and historical sites and structures symbolized aspects of the Industrial Revolution. Lowell is also represented to be the most significant planned industrialized city in the United States, which is a very important historical aspect in United States history. Another factor is that the immigration of different ethnic groups during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century was represented in Lowell&#x27;s neighborhoods. Preserving this area of land would allow for these representations to still be preserved in Lowell&#x27;s neighborhoods. Even though the city of Lowell had a large budget for cultural and historical preservation, they would still need the assistance of the federal government to ensure that all necessary early buildings and structures were preserved. The extra protection and funding by the federal government will allow for the preservation of these lands. By establishing Lowell as a National Park that is protected by the federal government, the history and significance of the Industrial Revolution, as well as cultural aspects would be preserved and shared with present and future generations.

In 2012, The Lowell National Historical Park Land Exchange Act of 2012 was added to the original legislation to allow for land within park boundaries to be exchanged with land owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the city of Lowell, or the University of Massachusetts building authority. Lowell National Historic Park is an originally established park and did not replace a previously established site.

The park includes a visitor center, as well as many restored and unrestored sites from the 19th century. The visitor center provides a free self-guided tour of the history of Lowell, including display exhibits such as the patent model of a loom by local inventor S. Thomas.

A footpath along the Merrimack Canal from the visitor center is lined with plaques describing the importance of various existing and former sites along the canal. The Boott Mills along the Merrimack River, on the Eastern Canal, is the most fully restored manufacturing site in the district, and one of the oldest. The Boott Mill provides a walk-through museum with living recreations of the textile manufacturing process in the 19th century. The walking tour includes a detour to a memorial to local author Jack Kerouac, who described the mid-20th century declined state of Lowell in several of his books. A walkway along the river leads to several additional unrestored mill sites, providing views of restored and unrestored canal raceways once used by the mills. Additionally, the park includes the Patrick J Mogan Cultural Center, which focuses on the lives of Lowell&#x27;s many generations of immigrants. Other exhibits include a working streetcar line, canal boat tours exploring some of the city&#x27;s gatehouses and locks, and the River Transformed / Suffolk Mill Turbine Exhibit, which shows how water power, the Francis Turbine, ran Lowell&#x27;s textile factories.

<doc id="173606" wikidata="Q435558" url="?curid=173606" title="Suzanne Duchamp">
<text>Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti (20 October 1889 – 11 September 1963) was a French Dadaist painter, collagist, sculptor, and draughtsman. Her work was significant to the development of Paris Dada and modernism and her drawings and collages explore fascinating gender dynamics. Due to the fact that she was a woman in the male prominent Dada movement, she was rarely considered an artist in her own right. She constantly lived in the shadows of her famous older brothers, who were also artists, or she was referred to as &quot;the wife of&quot; fellow artist Jean Crotti. Her work in painting turns out to be significantly influential to the landscape of Dada in Paris and to the interests of women in Dada. She took a large role as an avant-garde artist, working through a career that spanned five decades, during a turbulent time of great societal change. She used her work to express certain subject matter such as personal concerns about modern society, her role as a modern woman artist, and the effects of the First World War. Her work often weaves painting, collage, and language together in complex ways.

== Early life and education ==
Suzanne was born in Blainville-Crevon, Seine-Maritime in the Haute-Normandie Region of France, near Rouen. She was the fourth of six children born into the artistic family of Justin Isidore (Eugène) Duchamp (1848–1925) and Marie Caroline Lucie Duchamp (née Nicolle) (1860–1925), the daughter of painter and engraver Émile Frédéric Nicolle.

Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti was the younger sister of famous artists Jacques Villon (né Émile Méry Frédéric Gaston Duchamp), a painter and printmaker, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, a sculptor, and Marcel Duchamp, a painter, sculptor and author. She was closest in age and temperament to Marcel Duchamp, forming and maintaining a close bond and emotional attachment with him throughout their lives. Scholars, such as Arturo Schwarz, have speculated that there may have been an incestuous relationship between the two, although that was influenced by Freudian school of thought at the time.

She began her studies as a painter at the École des Beaux-Arts in her native Rouen when she was sixteen years old in 1905. Her early works reflected styles ranging from Intimism and Fauvism to Impressionism and a conservative Cubism, often depicting family and childhood scenes around Rouen. From 1909–1910, Marcel and Suzanne participated together in the activities of the Société Normande de de Peinture Moderne, an artists&#x27; group based in Rouen. Through this group, she was exposed to avant-garde trends. At age 21, in 1911, she married a local pharmacist named Charles Desmares but quickly divorced, moving to Paris to serve as a nurse during the First World War, living in Marcel&#x27;s apartment in rue la Condamine. She worked in the Hôtel des Invalides, one of the largest French military hospitals. During this time, she continued to work as an artist, establishing a presence in the Parisian quarter of Montparnasse and often asking Marcel for feedback or advice.

== Early work ==
In late 1915, Suzanne went to clear out Marcel&#x27;s studio in Paris and this is when/where she first learned about his readymades. Between 1916 and 1921 she produced a significant body of work in a formal language that has come to be called &#x27;mechanomorphic&#x27; - images taken from commonplace mechanical or technological objects arranged to describe or infer human agency, desire or behavior. The work of Francis Picabia typifies the mechanomorphic tendency. In a letter to her written in January 1916, Marcel elaborated on his concept of the ready-mades and mentioned the Bicycle Wheel and the Bottlerack which she should have encountered in the studio. He asked her to complete one of them by adding the inscription &quot;d&#x27;après Marcel Duchamp,&quot; which translates to &quot;after Marcel Duchamp.&quot; This collaboration with Marcel exhibited his trust in Suzanne about her openness towards radical art production.

In 1916, Suzanne met Jean Crotti, an artist who worked in the same studio as Marcel. During this time is when her first surge of activity occurred, creating some of her best work. She produced &quot;Un et une menacés,&quot; &quot;A Threatened Male and Female&quot; which references mechanical symbolism as well as real machine parts, which greatly lends itself to the Dadaist movement. One of her most noteworthy works is &quot;Multiplication Broken and Restored,&quot; completed in 1919. The composition contains Dadaist imagery with man-made objects such as a tower and cityscape. It is also believed that this piece comes directly from her private experience rather than being a severe critique of cultural norms.

After the war ended, Suzanne and Jean married in Paris in 1919. As a wedding present, Marcel sent them instructions for a readymade which involved suspending a geometry textbook on the porch and letting the wind and rain gradually tear it apart.

During this time, Dada was gaining traction in Paris due to figures like Tristan Tzara. Jean and Suzanne were not very involved until 1921, but both exhibited three works in the prestigious Salon des Indèpendants, alongside artists such as Francis Picabia. The art emphasized was that of the provocative mechanomorphic style. After this, Suzanne continued to work on her dadaist oeuvre, creating more delicate watercolor or gouache paintings. One of these paintings is &quot;Marcel&#x27;s Unhappy Readymade,&quot; depicting the geometry textbook she received from him as a gift. Interestingly, Suzanne inverted the painting so that it was presented upside down.

Completed in 1920, her work &quot;Ariette of Oblivion in the Thoughtless Chapel&quot; is regarded as the strongest Dadaist work that she created with seemingly nonsense inscriptions and mechanical imagery. However, much like &quot;Multiplication Broken and Restored&quot;, the inspiration for this piece emerged from the devotion she experienced in her relationship. This personal perspective runs contrary to the Dada sentiment of criticizing social conventions and undermining culture.

In 1921, Jean and Suzanne sign, along with 20 other artists, the &quot;Dada souléve tout,&quot; a manifesto created by Tristan Tzara to rebuke the increasingly fascist Italian Futurist, Marinetti. In April 1921, she exhibited with Crotti at the Tabu exhibition the Salon d&#x27;Autonme, (at the Galerie Montaigne in Paris); this was a few weeks before the Dada Salon at the same location. In later years, Duchamp and Crotti moved further away from Dada calling their work &#x27;Tabu&#x27;. The Tabu pieces were more geometric and abstract, seeking certain universal tropes, but still reveal a highly personalized symbolic language. Tabu works drew on a range of domestic or everyday issues, simplified and combined in often striking ways. These works never brought the acclaim of Duchamp&#x27;s earlier mechanomorphic pieces and are not discussed widely in literature on the artist.

== Later life ==
Throughout her life, Suzanne continued to participate in exhibitions, such as the &quot;Femmes Peintures Français&quot; exhibition at Galerie Barbazanges, organized by women artists wanting recognition in the art world. She also exhibited along with Marie Laurencin in &quot;Les Femmes Artistes d&#x27;Europe&quot; at the Musée du Jeu de Paume in 1937.

In 1945, after the war, Suzanne Duchamp became a member of the Union des Femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs and regularly exhibited landscapes, portraits, and flower still lifes at its salons.

In 1967, in Rouen, France, her brother Marcel helped organize an exhibition called &quot;Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp&quot;. Some of this family exhibition was later shown at the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris.

She died in Neuilly-sur-Seine (Seine-Saint-Denis), France in 1963, within a month of being diagnosed with a brain tumor.

<doc id="173612" wikidata="Q239739" url="?curid=173612" title="Octavia E. Butler">
<text>Octavia Estelle Butler (June 22, 1947 – February 24, 2006) was an American science fiction writer who won several awards for her works, including Hugo, Locus, and Nebula awards. In 1995, Butler became the first science-fiction writer to receive a MacArthur Fellowship.

Born in Pasadena, California, Butler was raised by her widowed mother. She was extremely shy as a child, but Butler found an outlet at the library reading fantasy, and in writing. She began writing science fiction as a teenager. Butler attended community college during the Black Power movement in the 1960s. While participating in a local writer&#x27;s workshop, she was encouraged to attend the Clarion Workshop which focused on science fiction. She sold her first stories soon after, and by the late 1970s had become sufficiently successful as an author to be able to write full-time. 

Butler&#x27;s books and short stories drew the favorable attention of critics and the public, and awards soon followed. She also taught writer&#x27;s workshops, and spoke about her experiences as an African American, using such themes in science fiction. She eventually relocated to Washington. Butler died of a stroke at the age of 58. Her papers are held in the research collection of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.

== Early life ==
Octavia Estelle Butler was born in Pasadena, California, the only child of Octavia Margaret Guy, a housemaid, and Laurice James Butler, a shoeshiner. Butler&#x27;s father died when she was seven years old. She was raised by her mother and maternal grandmother in what she would later recall as a strict Baptist environment.

Growing up in Pasadena, Butler experienced limited cultural and ethnic diversity in the midst of de facto racial segregation in the surrounding area. She accompanied her mother to her cleaning work where, as workers, the two entered white people&#x27;s houses through back doors. Her mother was treated poorly by her employers.
From an early age, an almost paralyzing shyness made it difficult for Butler to socialize with other children. Her awkwardness, paired with a slight dyslexia that made schoolwork a torment, made Butler an easy target for bullies. She believed that she was &quot;ugly and stupid, clumsy, and socially hopeless.&quot; As a result, she frequently spent her time reading at the Pasadena Central Library. She also wrote extensively in her &quot;big pink notebook&quot;. 

Hooked at first on fairy tales and horse stories, she quickly became interested in science fiction magazines, such as &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, and &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. She began reading stories by John Brunner, Zenna Henderson, and Theodore Sturgeon.

At the age of 10, Butler begged her mother to buy her a Remington typewriter, on which she &quot;pecked [her] stories two fingered.&quot; At 12, she watched the film &quot;Devil Girl from Mars&quot; (1954) and concluded that she could write a better story. She drafted what would later become the basis for her &quot;Patternist&quot; novels. Until then unaware of the obstacles that a black female writer could encounter, she became unsure of herself for the first time at the age of 13, when her well-intentioned Aunt Hazel said: &quot;Honey ... Negroes can&#x27;t be writers.&quot; But Butler persevered in her desire to publish a story, and even asked her junior high school science teacher, William Pfaff, to type the first manuscript she submitted to a science fiction magazine.

After graduating from John Muir High School in 1965, Butler worked during the day and attended Pasadena City College (PCC) at night. As a freshman at PCC, she won a college-wide short-story contest, earning her first income ($15) as a writer. She also got the &quot;germ of the idea&quot; for what would become her novel &quot;Kindred&quot;. An African-American classmate involved in the Black Power movement loudly criticized previous generations of African Americans for being subservient to whites. As Butler explained in later interviews, the young man&#x27;s remarks were a catalyst that led her to respond with a story providing historical context for the subservience, showing that it could be understood as silent but courageous survival. In 1968, Butler graduated from PCC with an associate of arts degree with a focus in history.

== Rise to success ==
Although Butler&#x27;s mother wanted her to become a secretary in order to have a steady income, Butler continued to work at a series of temporary jobs. She preferred less demanding work that would allow her to get up at two or three in the morning to write. Success continued to elude her. She styled her stories after the white-and-male-dominated science fiction she had grown up reading. She enrolled at California State University, Los Angeles, but switched to taking writing courses through UCLA Extension.

During the Open Door Workshop of the Writers Guild of America West, a program designed to mentor minority writers, her writing impressed one of the teachers, noted science-fiction writer Harlan Ellison. He encouraged her to attend the six-week Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop in Clarion, Pennsylvania. There, Butler met the Black science fiction writer Samuel R. Delany, who became a longtime friend. She also sold her first stories: &quot;Childfinder&quot; to Ellison, for his unpublished anthology &quot;The Last Dangerous Visions&quot; (eventually published in &quot;Unexpected Stories&quot; in 2014); and &quot;Crossover&quot; to Robin Scott Wilson, the director of the Clarion workshop, who published it in the 1971 Clarion anthology.

For the next five years, Butler worked on the novels that became known as the Patternist series: &quot;Patternmaster&quot; (1976), &quot;Mind of My Mind&quot; (1977), and &quot;Survivor&quot; (1978). In 1978, she was able to stop working at temporary jobs and live on her income from writing. She took a break from the Patternist series to research and write a stand-alone novel, &quot;Kindred&quot; (1979). She finished the Patternist series with &quot;Wild Seed&quot; (1980) and &quot;Clay&#x27;s Ark&quot; (1984).

Butler&#x27;s rise to prominence began in 1984 when &quot;Speech Sounds&quot; won the Hugo Award for Short Story and, a year later, &quot;Bloodchild&quot; won the Hugo Award, the Locus Award, and the &quot;Science Fiction Chronicle&quot; Reader Award for Best Novelette. In the meantime, Butler traveled to the Amazon rainforest and the Andes to do research for what would become the &quot;Xenogenesis&quot; trilogy: &quot;Dawn&quot; (1987), &quot;Adulthood Rites&quot; (1988), and &quot;Imago &quot;(1989). These stories were republished in 2000 as the collection &quot;Lilith&#x27;s Brood&quot;.

During the 1990s, Butler completed the novels that strengthened her fame as a writer: &quot;Parable of the Sower&quot; (1993) and &quot;Parable of the Talents&quot; (1998). In addition, in 1995, she became the first science-fiction writer to be awarded a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation fellowship, an award that came with a prize of $295,000.

In 1999, after her mother&#x27;s death, Butler moved to Lake Forest Park, Washington. &quot;The Parable of the Talents&quot; had won the Science Fiction Writers of America&#x27;s Nebula Award for Best Novel, and she had plans for four more Parable novels: &quot;Parable of the Trickster&quot;, &quot;Parable of the Teacher&quot;, &quot;Parable of Chaos&quot;, and &quot;Parable of Clay&quot;. However, after several failed attempts to begin &quot;The Parable of the Trickster&quot;, she decided to stop work in the series. 

In later interviews, Butler explained that the research and writing of the Parable novels had overwhelmed and depressed her, so she had shifted to composing something &quot;lightweight&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; instead. This became her last book, the science-fiction vampire novel &quot;Fledgling&quot; (2005).

==Writing career==

===Early stories, Patternist series, and &quot;Kindred&quot;: 1971–1984===

Butler&#x27;s first work published was &quot;Crossover&quot; in the 1971 Clarion Workshop anthology. She also sold the short story &quot;Childfinder&quot; to Harlan Ellison for the anthology &quot;The Last Dangerous Visions&quot;. &quot;I thought I was on my way as a writer&quot;, Butler recalled in her short-fiction collection &quot;Bloodchild and Other Stories&quot;, which contains &quot;Crossover.&quot; &quot;In fact, I had five more years of rejection slips and horrible little jobs ahead of me before I sold another word.&quot;

Starting in 1974, Butler worked on a series of novels that would later be collected as the Patternist series, which depicts the transformation of humanity into three genetic groups: the dominant Patternists, humans who have been bred with heightened telepathic powers and are bound to the Patternmaster via a psionic chain; their enemies the Clayarks, disease-mutated animal-like superhumans; and the Mutes, ordinary humans bonded to the Patternists.

The first novel, &quot;Patternmaster&quot; (1976), eventually became the last installment in the series&#x27; internal chronology. Set in the distant future, it tells of the coming-of-age of Teray, a young Patternist who fights for position within Patternist society and eventually for the role of Patternmaster.

Next came &quot;Mind of My Mind&quot; (1977), a prequel to &quot;Patternmaster&quot; set in the 20th century. The story follows the development of Mary, the creator of the psionic chain and the first Patternmaster to bind all Patternists, and her inevitable struggle for power with her father Doro, a parapsychological vampire who seeks to retain control over the psionic children he has bred over the centuries.

The third book of the series, &quot;Survivor&quot;, was published in 1978. The titular survivor is Alanna, the adopted child of the Missionaries, fundamentalist Christians who have traveled to another planet to escape Patternist control and Clayark infection. Captured by a local tribe called the Tehkohn, Alanna learns their language and adopts their customs, knowledge which she then uses to help the Missionaries avoid bondage and assimilation into a rival tribe that opposes the Tehkohn. Butler would later call Survivor the least favorite of her books, and withdraw it from reprinting.

After &quot;Survivor&quot;, Butler took a break from the Patternist series to write what would become her best-selling novel, &quot;Kindred&quot; (1979), as well as the short story &quot;Near of Kin&quot; (1979). In &quot;Kindred&quot;, Dana, an African-American woman, is repeatedly transported in time between 1976 Los Angeles and an early 19th-century plantation on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. There she meets ancestors: Alice, a free black woman forced into slavery later in life, and Rufus, the white son of a planter who also becomes a slaveholder. In &quot;Near of Kin&quot;, the protagonist discovers a taboo relationship in her family as she goes through her mother&#x27;s things after her death.

In 1980, Butler published the fourth book of the Patternist series, &quot;Wild Seed&quot;, whose narrative became the series&#x27; origin story. Set in Africa and America during the 17th century, &quot;Wild Seed&quot; traces the struggle between the four-thousand-year-old parapsychological vampire Doro and his &quot;wild&quot; child and bride, the three-hundred-year-old shapeshifter and healer Anyanwu. Doro, who has bred psionic children for centuries, deceives Anyanwu into becoming one of his breeders, but she eventually escapes and uses her gifts to create communities that rival Doro&#x27;s. When Doro finally tracks her down, Anyanwu, tired by decades of escaping or fighting Doro, decides to commit suicide, forcing him to admit his need for her.

In 1983, Butler published &quot;Speech Sounds&quot;, a story set in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles where a pandemic has caused most humans to lose their ability to read, speak, or write. For many, this impairment is accompanied by uncontrollable feelings of jealousy, resentment, and rage. &quot;Speech Sounds&quot; received the 1984 Hugo Award for Best Short Story.

In 1984, Butler released the last book of the Patternmaster series, &quot;Clay&#x27;s Ark&quot;. Set in the Mojave Desert, it focuses on a colony of humans infected by an extraterrestrial microorganism brought to Earth by the one surviving astronaut of the spaceship Clay&#x27;s Ark. As the microorganism compels its hosts to spread it, the infected humans kidnap others to infect them and, in the case of women, give birth to the mutant, sphinx-like children who will be the first members of the Clayark race.

===&quot;Bloodchild&quot; and the Xenogenesis trilogy: 1984–1989===

Butler followed &quot;Clay&#x27;s Ark&quot; with the critically acclaimed short story &quot;Bloodchild&quot; (1984). Set on an alien planet, it depicts the complex relationship between human refugees and the insect-like aliens who keep them in a preserve to protect them, but also to use them as hosts for breeding their young. Sometimes called Butler&#x27;s &quot;pregnant man story,&quot; &quot;Bloodchild&quot; won the Nebula, Hugo, and Locus Awards, and the Science Fiction Chronicle Reader Award.

Three years later, Butler published &quot;Dawn&quot;, the first installment of what would become known as the Xenogenesis trilogy. The series examines the theme of alienation by creating situations in which humans are forced to coexist with other species to survive and extends Butler&#x27;s recurring exploration of genetically altered, hybrid individuals and communities. In &quot;Dawn&quot;, protagonist Lilith Iyapo finds herself in a spaceship after surviving a nuclear apocalypse that destroys Earth. Saved by the Oankali aliens, the human survivors must combine their DNA with an ooloi, the Oankali&#x27;s third sex, in order to create a new race that eliminates a self-destructive flaw in humans: their aggressive hierarchical tendencies. Butler followed &quot;Dawn&quot; with &quot;The Evening and the Morning and the Night&quot; (1987), a story about how certain females with &quot;Duryea-Gode Disease&quot;, a genetic disorder which causes dissociative states, obsessive self-mutilation, and violent psychosis, are able to control others with the disease.

&quot;Adulthood Rites&quot; (1988) and &quot;Imago&quot; (1989), the second and the third books in the Xenogenesis trilogy, focus on the predatory and prideful tendencies that affect human evolution, as humans now revolt against Lilith&#x27;s Oankali-engineered progeny. Set thirty years after humanity&#x27;s return to Earth, &quot;Adulthood Rites&quot; centers on the kidnapping of Lilith&#x27;s part-human, part alien child, Akin, by a human-only group who are against the Oankali. Akin learns about both aspects of his identity through his life with the humans as well as the Akjai. The Oankali-only group becomes their mediator, and ultimately creates a human-only colony on Mars. In &quot;Imago&quot;, the Oankali create a third species more powerful than themselves: the shape-shifting healer Jodahs, a human-Oankali ooloi who must find suitable human male and female mates to survive its metamorphosis and who finds them in the most unexpected of places, in a village of renegade humans.

===The Parable series: 1993–1998===
In the mid-1990s, Butler published two novels later designated as the Parable (or Earthseed) series. The books depict the struggle of the Earthseed community to survive the socioeconomic and political collapse of 21st-century America due to poor environmental stewardship, corporate greed, and the growing gap between the wealthy and the poor. The books propose alternate philosophical views and religious interventions as solutions to such dilemmas.

The first book in the series, &quot;Parable of the Sower&quot; (1993), introduces the fifteen-year-old protagonist, Lauren Oya Olamina, and is set in a dystopian California in the 2020s. Lauren, who lives with a syndrome causing her to literally feel any physical pain she witnesses, struggles with the religious beliefs and physical isolation of her hometown Robledo. She forms a new belief system, Earthseed, which posits a future for the human race on other planets. When Robledo is destroyed and Lauren&#x27;s family and neighbors killed, she and two other survivors flee north. Recruiting members of varying social backgrounds along the way, Lauren relocates her new group to Northern California, naming her new community Acorn.

Butler&#x27;s 1998 follow-up novel, &quot;Parable of the Talents&quot;, is set some time after Lauren&#x27;s death and is told through the excerpts of Lauren&#x27;s journals, as framed by the commentary of her estranged daughter, Larkin. It details the invasion of Acorn by right-wing fundamentalist Christians, Lauren&#x27;s attempts to survive their religious &quot;re-education,&quot; and the final triumph of Earthseed as a community and a doctrine.

Between her Earthseed novels, Butler published the collection &quot;Bloodchild and Other Stories&quot; (1995), which includes the short stories &quot;Bloodchild,&quot; &quot;The Evening and the Morning and the Night,&quot; &quot;Near of Kin,&quot; &quot;Speech Sounds,&quot; and &quot;Crossover,&quot; as well as the non-fiction pieces &quot;Positive Obsession&quot; and &quot;Furor Scribendi&quot;.

===Late stories and &quot;Fledgling&quot;: 2003–2005===
After several years of writer&#x27;s block, Butler published the short stories &quot;Amnesty&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Book of Martha&quot; (2003), and her second standalone novel, &quot;Fledgling&quot; (2005). Both short stories focus on how impossible conditions force an ordinary woman to make a distressing choice. In &quot;Amnesty&quot;, an alien abductee recounts her painful abuse at the hand of the unwitting aliens and upon her release, by humans, and explains why she chose to work as a translator for the aliens now that the Earth&#x27;s economy is in a deep depression. In &quot;The Book of Martha&quot;, God asks a middle-aged African-American novelist to make one important change to fix humanity&#x27;s destructive ways. Martha&#x27;s choice—to make humans have vivid and satisfying dreams—means that she will no longer be able to do what she loves in writing fiction. These two stories were added to the 2005 edition of &quot;Bloodchild and Other Stories&quot;.

Butler&#x27;s last publication during her lifetime was &quot;Fledgling&quot;, a novel exploring the culture of a vampire community living in symbiosis with humans. Set on the West Coast, it tells of the coming-of-age of a young female hybrid vampire named Shori, whose species is called Ina. The only survivor of a vicious attack on her families that left her an amnesiac, she must seek justice for her dead, build a new family, and relearn how to be an Ina. Scholars like Susana M. Morris read &quot;Fledgling&quot; as a powerful disruption of the vampire genre—a genre which tends to feature pale vampire heroes with paternalist tendencies that privilege whiteness. Butler disrupts this narrative by centering Shori, the protagonist of &quot;Fledgling&quot;, a petite Black female Ina.

== Later years and death ==
During her last years, Butler struggled with writer&#x27;s block and depression, partly caused by the side effects of medication for high blood pressure. She continued writing and taught at Clarion&#x27;s Science Fiction Writers&#x27; Workshop regularly. In 2005, she was inducted into Chicago State University&#x27;s International Black Writers Hall of Fame.

Butler died outside of her home in Lake Forest Park, Washington, on February 24, 2006, aged 58. Contemporary news accounts were inconsistent as to the cause of her death, with some reporting that she had a fatal stroke and others indicating that she died of head injuries after falling and striking her head on her cobbled walkway. Another interpretation, backed by &quot;Locus&quot; magazine, is that a stroke caused the fall and the subsequent head injuries.

Butler maintained a longstanding relationship with the Huntington Library and bequeathed her papers, including manuscripts, correspondence, school papers, notebooks, and photographs, to the library in her will. The collection, comprising 9,062 pieces in 386 boxes, 1 volume, 2 binders and 18 broadsides, was made available to scholars and researchers in 2010. Butler donated one of her typewriters to Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Anacostia Community Museum for a 2003-2004 exhibition celebrating Black American literature.

==Themes==

=== Critique of present-day hierarchies ===
In multiple interviews and essays, Butler explained her view of humanity: inherently flawed by an innate tendency towards hierarchical thinking which leads to tribalism, caste, intolerance, violence and, if not checked, the ultimate destruction of our species.

&quot;Simple peck-order bullying&quot;, she wrote in her essay &quot;A World without Racism&quot;, &quot;is only the beginning of the kind of hierarchical behavior that can lead to racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, classism, and all the other &#x27;isms&#x27; that cause so much suffering in the world.&quot; Her stories, then, often replay humanity&#x27;s domination of the weak by the strong as a type of parasitism. These &quot;others&quot;, whether aliens, vampires, superhuman, or slave masters, find themselves defied by a protagonist who embodies difference, diversity, and change, so that, as John R. Pfeiffer notes, &quot;In one sense [Butler&#x27;s] fables are trials of solutions to the self-destructive condition in which she finds mankind.&quot;

=== Remaking of the human ===
In his essay on the sociobiological backgrounds of Butler&#x27;s &quot;Xenogenesis&quot; trilogy, J. Adam Johns describes how Butler&#x27;s narratives counteract the death drive behind the hierarchical impulse with an innate love of life (biophilia), particularly of different, strange life. Specifically, Butler&#x27;s stories feature gene manipulation, interbreeding, interracial marriage and miscegenation, symbiosis, mutation, alien contact, rape, contamination, and other forms of hybridity as the means to correct the sociobiological causes of hierarchical violence. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai note, &quot;in [Butler&#x27;s] narratives the undoing of the human body is both literal and metaphorical, for it signifies the profound changes necessary to shape a world not organized by hierarchical violence.&quot; The evolutionary maturity achieved by the bioengineered hybrid protagonist at the end of the story, then, signals the possible evolution of the dominant community in terms of tolerance, acceptance of diversity, and a desire to wield power responsibly.

=== Survivor as hero ===
Butler&#x27;s protagonists are disenfranchised individuals who endure, compromise, and embrace radical change in order to survive. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai note, her stories focus on minority characters whose historical background makes them already intimate with brutal violation and exploitation, and therefore the need to compromise to survive. Even when endowed with extra, paranormal abilities, these characters are forced to experience unprecedented physical, mental, and emotional distress and exclusion to ensure a minimal degree of agency and to prevent humanity from achieving self-destruction. In many of her stories, their acts of courage become acts of understanding, and in some cases, love, as they reach a crucial compromise with those in power. Ultimately, Butler&#x27;s focus on disenfranchised characters serves to illustrate both the historical exploitation of minorities and how the resolve of one such exploited individual may bring on critical change.

=== Creation of alternative communities ===
Butler&#x27;s stories feature mixed communities founded by African protagonists and populated by diverse, if similar-minded individuals. Members may be humans of African, European, or Asian descent, extraterrestrial (such as the N&#x27;Tlic in &quot;Bloodchild&quot;), from a different species (such as the vampiric Ina in &quot;Fledgling&quot;), and cross-species (such as the human-Oankali Akin and Jodahs in the &quot;Xenogenesis&quot; trilogy). In some stories, the community&#x27;s hybridity results in a flexible view of sexuality and gender (for instance, the polyamorous extended families in &quot;Fledgling&quot;). Thus, Butler creates bonds between groups that are generally considered to be separate and unrelated, and suggests hybridity as &quot;the potential root of good family and blessed community life&quot;. 

&quot;Kindred&quot; is one of the only works of 20th-century American literature to feature a married interracial couple. As Farah Peterson comments, in an American society gripped by racism, it took &quot;a fantasy novelist... to imagine how one of these marriages would work in practice&quot; and write the possibility of such a relationship into literary history.

=== Relationship to Afrofuturism ===
Author Octavia E. Butler is known for blending science fiction with African American spiritualism.

Butler&#x27;s work has been associated with the genre of Afrofuturism, a term coined by Mark Dery to describe &quot;speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American concerns in the context of 20th-century technoculture&quot;. Some critics, however, have noted that while Butler&#x27;s protagonists are of African descent, the communities they create are multi-ethnic and, sometimes, multi-species. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai explain in their 2010 memorial to Butler, while keeping &quot;an afro-centric sensibility at the core of narratives&quot;, her &quot;insistence on hybridity beyond the point of discomfort&quot; and grim themes deny both the ethnocentric escapism of afrofuturism and the sanitized perspective of white-dominated liberal pluralism.

&quot;Wild Seed&quot;, of the Patternist series, is considered to particularly fit ideas of Afrofuturist thematic concerns, as the narrative of two immortal Africans Doro and Anyanwu features science fiction technologies and an alternate anti-colonialist history of seventeenth-century America.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; regarded her novels as &quot;evocative&quot; and &quot;often troubling&quot; explorations of &quot;far-reaching issues of race, sex, power&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, Orson Scott Card called her examination of humanity &quot;clear-headed and brutally unsentimental&quot;, and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Dorothy Allison described her as &quot;writing the most detailed social criticism&quot; where &quot;the hard edge of cruelty, violence, and domination is described in stark detail&quot;. &quot;Locus&quot; regarded her as &quot;one of those authors who pay serious attention to the way human beings actually work together and against each other, and she does so with extraordinary plausibility.&quot; The &quot;Houston Post&quot; ranked her &quot;among the best SF writers, blessed with a mind capable of conceiving complicated futuristic situations that shed considerable light on our current affairs.&quot;

Some scholars have focused on Butler&#x27;s choice to write from the point of view of marginal characters and communities and thus &quot;expanded SF to reflect the experiences and expertise of the disenfranchised&quot;. While surveying Butler&#x27;s novels, critic Burton Raffel noted how race and gender influence her writing: &quot;I do not think any of these eight books could have been written by a man, as they most emphatically were not, nor, with the single exception of her first book, &quot;Pattern-Master&quot; (1976), are likely to have been written, as they most emphatically were, by anyone but an African American.&quot; Robert Crossley commended how Butler&#x27;s &quot;feminist aesthetic&quot; works to expose sexual, racial, and cultural chauvinism because it is &quot;enriched by a historical consciousness that shapes the depiction of enslavement both in the real past and in imaginary pasts and futures.&quot;

Butler&#x27;s prose has been praised by critics including the &quot;Washington Post Book World&quot;, where her craftsmanship has been described as &quot;superb&quot;, and by Burton Raffel, who regards Butler&#x27;s prose as &quot;carefully, expertly crafted&quot; and &quot;crystalline, at its best, sensuous, sensitive, exact, not in the least directed at calling attention to itself&quot;.

== Influence ==
In interviews with Charles Rowell and Randall Kenan, Butler credited the struggles of her working-class mother as an important influence on her writing. Because Butler&#x27;s mother received little formal education herself, she made sure that young Butler was given the opportunity to learn by bringing her reading materials that her white employers threw away, from magazines to advanced books. She also encouraged Butler to write. She bought her daughter her first typewriter when she was 10 years old, and, seeing her hard at work on a story casually remarked that maybe one day she could become a writer, causing Butler to realize that it was possible to make a living as an author. A decade later, Mrs. Butler would pay more than a month&#x27;s rent to have an agent review her daughter&#x27;s work. She also provided Butler with the money she had been saving for dental work to pay for Butler&#x27;s scholarship so she could attend the Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop, where Butler sold her first two stories.

A second person to play an influential role in Butler&#x27;s work was the American writer Harlan Ellison. As a teacher at the Open Door Workshop of the Screen Writers Guild of America, he gave Butler her first honest and constructive criticism on her writing after years of lukewarm responses from composition teachers and baffling rejections from publishers. Impressed by her work, Ellison suggested she attend the Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop and even contributed $100 towards her application fee. As the years passed, Ellison&#x27;s mentorship became a close friendship.

Butler herself has been highly influential in legacy of science fiction, particularly for people of color. In 2015, writers adrienne maree brown and Walidah Imarisha co-edited &quot;Octavia&#x27;s Brood: Science Fiction Stories from Social Justice Movements&quot; (AK Press), a collection of 20 short stories and essays about social justice, inspired by Butler. In 2020, brown and Toshi Reagon, creator of an opera adaptation of &quot;Parable of the Sower&quot;, began collaborating on a podcast called &quot;Octavia&#x27;s Parables&quot;.

== Point of view ==
Butler began reading science fiction at a young age, but quickly became disenchanted by the genre&#x27;s unimaginative portrayal of ethnicity and class as well as by its lack of noteworthy female protagonists. She determined to correct those gaps by, as De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai point out, &quot;choosing to write self-consciously as an African-American woman marked by a particular history&quot;—what Butler herself referred to as &quot;writing myself in.&quot; Butler&#x27;s stories, therefore, are usually written from the perspective of a marginalized black woman whose difference from the dominant agents increases her potential for reconfiguring the future of her society.

== Audience ==
Publishers and critics have labelled Butler&#x27;s work as science fiction. While Butler enjoyed the genre deeply, calling it &quot;potentially the freest genre in existence,&quot; she resisted being branded a genre writer. Her narratives have drawn attention of people from varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds. She claimed to have three loyal audiences: black readers, science-fiction fans, and feminists.

== Adaptations ==
&quot;Parable of the Sower&quot; was adapted as &quot;Parable of the Sower: The Opera&quot;, written by American folk/blues musician Toshi Reagon in collaboration with her mother, singer and composer Bernice Johnson Reagon. The adaptation&#x27;s libretto and musical score combine African-American spirituals, soul, rock and roll, and folk music into rounds to be performed by singers sitting in a circle. It was first performed as part of The Public Theater&#x27;s 2015 Under the Radar Festival in New York City.

&quot;Kindred&quot; was adapted as a graphic novel by author Damien Duffy and artist . The adaptation was published by Abrams ComicsArts on January 10, 2017. To visually differentiate the time periods in which Butler set the story, Jennings used muted colors for the present and vibrant ones for the past to demonstrate how the remnants and relevance of slavery are still with us. The graphic novel adaption debuted as number one &quot;New York Times&quot; hardcover graphic book bestseller on January 29, 2017. After the success of &quot;Kindred&quot;, Duffy and Jennings also adapted &quot;Parable of the Sower&quot; as a graphic novel. They also plan on releasing an adaptation of &quot;Parable of the Talents&quot;.

&quot;Dawn&quot; is currently being adapted for television by producers Ava DuVernay and Charles D. King&#x27;s Macro Ventures, alongside writer Victoria Mahoney. There is no projected release date for the adaptation yet. A television series based on &quot;Wild Seed&quot; is also in the works for Amazon Prime Video with a screenplay co-written by Nnedi Okorafor and Wanuri Kahiu. 

In 2021, FX ordered an eight-episode miniseries, &quot;Kindred&quot;, based on Butler&#x27;s book of the same name. The show was developed by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins and premiered on December 13, 2022.

== Memorial scholarships ==
In 2006, the Carl Brandon Society established the Octavia E. Butler Memorial Scholarship in Butler&#x27;s memory, to enable writers of color to attend the annual Clarion West Writers Workshop and Clarion Writers&#x27; Workshop, descendants of the original Clarion Science Fiction Writers&#x27; Workshop in Clarion, Pennsylvania, where Butler got her start. The first scholarships were awarded in 2007.

In March 2019, Butler&#x27;s alma mater, Pasadena City College, announced the Octavia E. Butler Memorial Scholarship for students enrolled in the Pathways program and committed to transfer to four-year institutions.

The memorial scholarships sponsored by the Carl Brandon Society and Pasadena City College help fulfill three of the life goals Butler had handwritten in a notebook from 1988:
&quot;I will send poor black youngsters to Clarion or other writer&#x27;s workshops

&quot;I will help poor black youngsters broaden their horizons

&quot;I will help poor black youngsters go to college&quot;

<text>The Battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep, also called the Battle of the Hornburg, is a fictional battle in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; that saw the total destruction of the forces of the Wizard Saruman by the army of Rohan, assisted by a forest of tree-like Huorns. 

Helm&#x27;s Deep was a valley in the north-western White Mountains of Middle-earth. Helm&#x27;s Deep, with its fortress the Hornburg, becomes the refuge of some of the army of Rohan, the Rohirrim, under King Théoden, from assault by the forces of Saruman. Although Théoden says that &quot;the Hornburg has never fallen to assault,&quot; in the battle a massive army of Uruk-hai and Dunlendings sent by Saruman almost overwhelms the defences. Saruman&#x27;s Orcs breach the fortress wall that blocks the valley by setting off an explosion in a culvert; Aragorn names it &quot;Saruman&#x27;s devilry&quot; and &quot;the fire of Orthanc&quot;; the critic Tom Shippey calls it &quot;a kind of gunpowder&quot;. The defenders hold out in the fortress until dawn, when Théoden and Aragorn lead a cavalry charge that drives the Orcs from the fortress. They are surprised to see the valley to the enemy&#x27;s rear blocked by a forest of tree-like Huorns that have walked from Fangorn in the night. On the side of the valley are relieving forces assembled by Gandalf and Erkenbrand, a Rohirrim leader. These attack, driving the Orcs into the angry Huorn forest, from which the Orcs never emerge; the Huorns bury the Orcs&#x27; bodies in an earthen mound known as &quot;Death&#x27;s Down&quot;.

Tolkien based Helm&#x27;s Deep on England&#x27;s Cheddar Gorge, and the Glittering Caves of Aglarond on the cave complex that he had visited there. The army of Rohan was according to Tolkien armed and equipped much like that of the armies depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry. He noted further that his walking forest was partly a response to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, which tells of the coming of &quot;Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane hill&quot;. Scholars have likened the way Aragorn, Éomer, and Gimli heroically hold off the army of Orcs to Horatius Cocles&#x27;s heroic defence of a bridge of ancient Rome.

Peter Jackson&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;The Two Towers&quot; makes the battle dramatic, following Tolkien&#x27;s account quite closely, but with changes to the forces involved: the defenders include a group of Elf-warriors sent by Elrond; the attackers include neither men nor wargs (battle-wolves). Huorns appear only in additional scenes in the Extended Edition, later released on DVD.

== Fictional geography ==

Helm&#x27;s Deep is based on the Cheddar Gorge, a limestone gorge deep in the Mendip Hills, with a large cave complex that Tolkien visited on his honeymoon in 1916 and revisited in 1940, and which he acknowledged as the origin of the Glittering Caves of Aglarond at the head of Helm&#x27;s Deep, behind the fortress.

Helm&#x27;s Deep is properly the narrow gorge or ravine at the head of a larger valley (the Deeping-coomb), but the name is also used for the fortifications at the mouth of the gorge and the larger valley below. The gorge, which wound deep into the White Mountains at the feet of the Thrihyrne mountain, led into the Glittering Caves of Aglarond, an extensive series of spectacular speleothems. In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the Dwarf Gimli, who like all dwarves is well versed in geology, horrified that the caves are used only as a refuge, describes them lyrically as:

The mouth of the gorge, Helm&#x27;s Gate, was closed by the battlemented Deeping Wall, tall, and wide enough for four men to stand abreast, with a culvert for the Deeping-stream which flowed down the valley. At one end of the wall the Hornburg castle stood on a spur of the mountain; a long stair led to its rear gate, and a long causeway led down forwards from its main gate. About two furlongs (400 metres) down from the gate was an outer trench and rampart, Helm&#x27;s Dike, built right across the Deeping-coomb. Tolkien drew detailed sketches of the fortifications.

The valley was named after King Helm Hammerhand of Rohan, when he and his people sought refuge from the invading Dunlendings under Wulf during the winter of .

== Description ==

=== Background ===

Théoden had been released by the Wizard Gandalf from the influence of Gríma Wormtongue, his malevolent adviser and Saruman&#x27;s spy. He then sets out to the Fords of Isen, where his marshal Erkenbrand was fighting Saruman&#x27;s forces. However, Théoden found out that his forces had been scattered. Gandalf advised him to take refuge in the Hornburg fortress of Helm&#x27;s Deep. Gandalf then left on an unexplained errand. Théoden&#x27;s army went to the area, where local people were commanded by a captain called Gamling the Old. Many of the men there were very old or young. The women and children of Théoden&#x27;s capital Edoras were safe in Dunharrow, led by the King&#x27;s niece Éowyn.

The garrison of Helm&#x27;s Deep consisted of some 1,000 men, but around 1,000 more defenders had arrived from across Rohan by the time of the battle. The enemy, Saruman&#x27;s army, consisted of at least 10,000 Orcs and men, most marching from Isengard to Helm&#x27;s Deep, and others heading to the Fords of Isen. An additional force of Men of Dunland joined the enemy.

=== The battle ===

The forces of Saruman, common Orcs, large Uruk-hai, &quot;half-orcs and goblin-men&quot;, and Dunlendings (Men of Dunland), arrived at Helm&#x27;s Deep on a stormy night. They stormed the first defence, Helm&#x27;s Dike, forcing the defenders to fall back to the fortress. They attempted to break down the gate with a battering ram, but a sortie led by Aragorn and Éomer briefly scattered the attackers.

The Orcs and Dunlendings raised ladders to scale the wall, but were held back by the Men of Rohan atop the wall. Orcs crept into the culvert and made a breach in the wall using a &quot;blasting-fire&quot; from Orthanc, perhaps &quot;a kind of gunpowder&quot;; Saruman&#x27;s army rushed in. Some defenders retreated to the Glittering Caves of Aglarond, while others retreated to the Hornburg.

Saruman&#x27;s forces broke through the Hornburg gate just before dawn. At this moment, Helm&#x27;s horn was sounded, and Théoden and Aragorn rode out, followed by all the Rohirrim left inside. They cut their way through the Orcs and drove them back from the fortress walls to Helm&#x27;s Dike.

As day dawned, both armies saw that a forest of angry, tree-like Huorns now filled the valley, trapping Saruman&#x27;s army. Above them, Gandalf appeared on Shadowfax, with Erkenbrand and a thousand footsoldiers who had escaped from the Fords of Isen. They charged into the fray. The Dunlendings dropped their weapons, while the Orcs fled into the Huorn forest and were destroyed.

=== Aftermath ===

After the battle, the Dunlendings were given amnesty by Erkenbrand and allowed to return home (much to their surprise, since Saruman had told them that the men of Rohan would burn all survivors alive). The Rohirrim required that all hostilities cease, and that the Dunlendings retreat behind the River Isen again and never recross while bearing arms. Before they were freed, though, the Dunlending captives were put to work in repairing the fortress.

The bodies of the Orcs that had entered the forest of Huorns were never seen again; the Huorns had buried them in an earthen mound known as &quot;Death&#x27;s Down&quot;.

Among the Rohirrim dead was Háma, captain of Théoden&#x27;s personal guard and doorward of his hall; the Orcs had hewn his corpse, an atrocity that Théoden recalled during his later parley with Saruman. Gimli had been wounded, but had killed 42 Orcs to Legolas&#x27;s 41.

== Development ==

=== Literary history ===

In Book III, ch. 5 of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, Helm is described only as a &quot;hero of old wars&quot;; Tolkien did not envision him as a king when he wrote that chapter.

Tolkien had not yet envisioned Helm&#x27;s Deep in his first sketch for the decisive battle between Rohan and the forces of Saruman. In an outline published in &quot;The Treason of Isengard&quot; as “The Story Foreseen from Fangorn,&quot; the Rohirrim rode west at Gandalf&#x27;s urging, as in the published text, but met the army of Saruman on the open plain. An indecisive battle ensued, after which the Rohirrim camped for the night, and woke to see the enemy surrounded and destroyed by a wood that had appeared overnight.

=== Later writings ===

After the publication of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; Tolkien wrote about the history of Rohan, in writings now collected by his son Christopher in &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;. These state that the fortresses of Aglarond and Angrenost (renamed Isengard by the Rohirrim) were built by Gondor to guard the shoulders of the Gap of Rohan. Like Angrenost to the north, it was initially well guarded, but as the population of Calenardhon dwindled it was not maintained and was left to a hereditary small guard who intermarried with Dunlendings. When Cirion, Steward of Gondor, gave Calenardhon to the Éothéod, Aglarond was transferred into the care of the Rohirrim, who named it &quot;Súthburg&quot; (&quot;South-fortress&quot; in Old English). The Gondorian guard was merged with that of Isengard. Guard duty of the Fords was initially shared between Gondor and Rohan, but later maintained only by the Rohirrim.

== Analysis ==

=== Bayeux Tapestry style ===

In a 1958 letter to Rhona Beare, one of a group of enthusiasts, Tolkien stated that the Rohirrim &quot;were not &#x27;Mediaeval&#x27; in our sense&quot; (as the Third Age was meant to be thousands of years earlier) but that all the same &quot;the styles of the Bayeux Tapestry (made in England) fit them well enough&quot;, explaining that the soldiers in the tapestry are wearing chain-mail.

=== Shakespeare rewritten ===

Tolkien noted in a letter that he had created walking tree-creatures partly in response to his &quot;bitter disappointment and disgust from schooldays with the shabby use made in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; of the coming of &#x27;Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane hill&#x27;: I longed to devise a setting in which the trees might really march to war&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey calls it a &quot;shock&quot; that the battle is decided by having a forest of Huorns destroy Saruman&#x27;s army of Orcs.

=== Classical influence ===

Charles Oughton likens the Battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep to Livy&#x27;s account of Horatius Cocles&#x27;s heroic defence of Rome&#x27;s Pons Sublicius bridge. The heroes Aragorn, Éomer, and Gimli hold off the army of Orcs; Horatius holds off the army of Etruscans at the bridge. Oughton finds multiple matches between the two accounts. Several of these are not present in Thomas Babington Macaulay&#x27;s poem &quot;Horatius&quot; which retells Livy&#x27;s tale, though Oughton suggests that Tolkien did make additional use of Macaulay for some details.

== Adaptations ==

=== Peter Jackson&#x27;s film ===

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;The Two Towers&quot; the keep was built into the mountainside and resembles a World War I bunker, in keeping with Tolkien&#x27;s history as a soldier in that war. The entrance to the Glittering Caves of Aglarond is within the Hornburg itself, rather than at the top of the deep behind the Deeping Wall as in the book. Further, the Uruk-hai assault the main gateway in a testudo, or locked-shields style formation, and the &#x27;blasting fire&#x27; is depicted as gunpowder. The battle was filmed mainly at night, in frequent heavy natural rain or when necessary with artificial rain on the actors, for more than three months. 

The Helm&#x27;s Deep set used some computer-generated imagery; some parts were constructed as full size sets; some shots used a 1/4 scale physical model, while more distant shots used a 1/85 scale model. In the final battle scene, Weta&#x27;s &quot;Massive&quot; crowd simulation software and &quot;Grunt&quot; rendering software were used, with thousands of Uruk-hai modelled using Alias/Wavefront&#x27;s &quot;Maya&quot; software. It has been described as one of the greatest battle scenes in film, combining &quot;technical mastery, sweeping spectacle and tonal balance&quot;. In the film, 10,000 of Saruman&#x27;s Uruk-hai (with no Orcs of other races, Dunlendings or wargs to accompany them) lay siege to the fortress, defended by around 300 Rohirrim. Soon after, however, a large group of the Elves of Lothlórien join the defences, sent by Elrond, at Galadriel&#x27;s prompting. The defenders suffer heavy losses, but hold out until dawn, when Gandalf arrives with 2,000 riders led by Éomer, who turn the tide of the battle and rout Saruman&#x27;s forces. In the original script of the film, Elrond and Arwen had gone to see Galadriel in person, and it was Arwen who led the Elves to fight alongside the Rohan defenders. Jackson rejected Arwen&#x27;s involvement, revising her character from a &quot;warrior princess&quot; to a role closer to that of the book, but kept the Elves in the battle. Huorns appear only in additional scenes in the Extended Edition, later released on DVD.
=== Other ===


The 2013 expansion to The Lord of the Rings Online entitled &quot;Helm&#x27;s Deep&quot; depicts the fortress of Helm&#x27;s Deep as well as the surrounding area of Western Rohan, the Battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep featuring prominently.

<doc id="173618" wikidata="Q1316518" url="?curid=173618" title="Sweet Honey in the Rock">
<text>Sweet Honey in the Rock are an all-woman, African-American a cappella ensemble. They are a three-time Grammy Award–nominated troupe who express their history as black women through song, dance, and sign language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweet Honey in the Rock/Biography1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a four-person ensemble, the group has expanded to five-part harmonies, with a sixth member acting as a sign-language interpreter. Although the members have changed over five decades, the group continues to sing and perform worldwide.

==Musical career==
Sweet Honey in the Rock was founded in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, who was teaching a vocal workshop with the Washington, D.C. Black Repertory Company. Reagon retired from the group in 2004. The name of the group was derived from a song, based on Psalm 81:16, which tells of a land so rich that when rocks were cracked open, honey flowed from them. Johnson has said that this first song in which four women blended their voices was so powerful, that there was no question what the name of the group should be. The ensemble&#x27;s most powerful messages are proclaimed through an enormous catalog of songs addressing the world&#x27;s woes. They are currently occupied with immigration injustices, congressional greed and lack of compassion for citizens, the environmental imbalance, racial issues and women&#x27;s issues.

Sweet Honey in the Rock has received several Grammy Award nominations, including one for their children&#x27;s album, &quot;Still the Same Me&quot; which received the Silver Award from the National Association of Parenting Publications. They contributed their version of Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;Grey Goose&quot; from the compilation album &quot;&quot; which won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album.
Their vocals appeared in a number of animated counting cartoons on the PBS series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and the group was the subject of the 2005 documentary &quot;Sweet Honey in the Rock: Raise Your Voice&quot;.

The group has ventured through 20 vocalists since its creation. Embarking on a new chapter in their musical journey, Sweet Honey In The Rock now includes four core vocalists—Louise Robinson, Carol Maillard (both founding members), Nitanju Bolade Casel, and Aisha Kahlil. Shirley Childress, an American Sign Language Interpreter, performed live with the group from 1981 until her passing in 2017.

==Influences==
Sweet Honey in the Rock has been making music since the mid-1970s. Although the members of the group have changed over time, their music has consistently combined contemporary rhythms and narratives with a musical style rooted in the Gospel music, spirituals and hymns of the African-American Church. The ensemble composes much of their own music. They have addressed topics including motherhood, spirituality, freedom, civil rights, domestic violence, immigration issues, and racism. In their latest album, &quot;#LoveinEvolution,&quot; they address the additional topics of police shootings, specifically the Charleston church shooting, and the environment.

==Members==
Over the decades, more than 20 individuals have lent their voices to Sweet Honey in the Rock. Beginning as a quartet, the group is now composed of six African-American women (including a professional American Sign Language interpreter who accompanies the group on concert tours).

==&quot;Are We a Nation?&quot;==
On June 22, 2010, the group released the song &quot;Are We a Nation?&quot;, their response to Arizona&#x27;s controversial immigration law, SB-1070. An official music video of the song was released online on July 2, 2010. Directed by James Lester, the video was shot in New York City at Tainted Blue Recording Studio during a live recording session of the song. Amanda Navarro researched and provided the video&#x27;s archival images and Russel Soder was the cinematographer. Ramon Hervey II served as the project&#x27;s executive producer. The band donated a portion of the proceeds from the sales of &quot;Are We a Nation?&quot; to the Center for Community Change, an organization founded in 1968 to honor the life of Robert F. Kennedy. Sweet Honey in the Rock also joined The Sound Strike, boycotting performances within Arizona in protest of the law.

<text>GNU Chess is a free software chess engine and command-line interface chessboard. The goal of GNU Chess is to serve as a basis for research, and as such it has been used in numerous contexts.

GNU Chess is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 or any later version, and is maintained by collaborating developers. As one of the earliest computer chess programs with full source code available, it is one of the oldest for Unix-based systems and has since been ported to many other platforms.

== Features ==
GNU Chess 6.2.5 is rated at 2661 Elo points on CCRL&#x27;s 40-moves-in-2-minutes list. For comparison, the strongest human player, Magnus Carlsen, has achieved an Elo rating of 2882. On the same list, Fritz 8 was rated at 2665 Elo, and that program in the 2004 Man vs Machine World Team Championship beat grandmasters Sergey Karjakin, Veselin Topalov and reached a draw with Ruslan Ponomariov.

It is often used in conjunction with a GUI program such as XBoard or GNOME Chess, where it is included as the default engine. Initial versions of XBoard&#x27;s Chess Engine Communication Protocol were based on GNU Chess&#x27;s command-line interface. Version 6 also supports the Universal Chess Interface (UCI). Since version 6.1 GNU chess supports a graphical mode for terminal emulators.
== History ==
The first version of GNU Chess was written by Stuart Cracraft. Having started in 1984 in collaboration with Richard Stallman prior to his founding of the GNU Project, GNU Chess became one of the first parts of GNU.

GNU Chess has been enhanced and expanded since. Versions from 2 to 4 were written by John Stanback. Version 5 of GNU Chess was based on the Cobalt chess engine written by Chua Kong-Sian.

In 2011, GNU Chess transitioned to version 6, which is based on Fabien Letouzey&#x27;s Fruit 2.1 chess engine. According to CEGT version 5.60 of this code base is stronger than Fruit 2.3, the latest version of that chess engine.

<doc id="173620" wikidata="Q696328" url="?curid=173620" title="Venona project">
<text>The Venona project was a United States counterintelligence program initiated during World War II by the United States Army&#x27;s Signal Intelligence Service and later absorbed by the National Security Agency (NSA), that ran from February 1, 1943, until October 1, 1980. It was intended to decrypt messages transmitted by the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union (e.g. the NKVD, the KGB, and the GRU). Initiated when the Soviet Union was an ally of the US, the program continued during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union was considered an enemy.

During the 37-year duration of the Venona project, the Signal Intelligence Service decrypted and translated approximately 3,000 messages. The signals intelligence yield included discovery of the Cambridge Five espionage ring in the United Kingdom, and also of Soviet espionage of the Manhattan Project in the US, known as Project Enormous. Some of the espionage was undertaken to support the Soviet atomic bomb project. The Venona project remained secret for more than 15 years after it concluded. Some of the decoded Soviet messages were not declassified and published by the United States until 1995.

==Background==
During World War II and the early years of the Cold War, the Venona project was a source of information on Soviet intelligence-gathering directed at the Western military powers. Although unknown to the public, and even to Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, these programs were of importance concerning crucial events of the early Cold War. These included the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg spying case (which was based on events during World War II) and the defections of Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess to the Soviet Union.

Most decipherable messages were transmitted and intercepted between 1942 and 1945, during World War II, when the Soviet Union was an ally of the US. Sometime in 1945, the existence of the Venona program was revealed to the Soviet Union by cryptologist-analyst Bill Weisband, an NKVD agent in the US Army&#x27;s SIGINT. These messages were slowly and gradually decrypted beginning in 1946. This effort continued (many times at a low level of effort in the latter years) through 1980, when the Venona program was terminated. The analyst effort assigned to it was moved to more important projects.

To what extent the various individuals referred to in the messages were involved with Soviet intelligence is a topic of minor historical dispute. Most academics and historians have established that most of the individuals mentioned in the Venona decrypts were probably either clandestine assets and/or contacts of Soviet intelligence agents, and very few argue that many of those people probably had no malicious intentions and committed no crimes.

===Commencement===
The VENONA&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov/csi/books/venona/preface&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Project was initiated on February 1, 1943, by Gene Grabeel, an American mathematician and cryptanalyst, under orders from Colonel Carter W. Clarke, Chief of Special Branch of the Military Intelligence Service at that time. Clarke distrusted Joseph Stalin, and feared that the Soviet Union would sign a separate peace with Nazi Germany, allowing Germany to focus its military forces against the United Kingdom and the United States. Cryptanalysts of the US Army&#x27;s Signal Intelligence Service at Arlington Hall analyzed encrypted high-level Soviet diplomatic intelligence messages intercepted in large volumes during and immediately after World War II by American, British, and Australian listening posts. Frank Rowlett was one of the project leaders.

==Decryption==
This message traffic, which was encrypted with a one-time pad system, was stored and analyzed in relative secrecy by hundreds of cryptanalysts over a 40-year period starting in the early 1940s. When used correctly, the one-time pad encryption system, which has been used for all the most-secret military and diplomatic communication since the 1930s, is unbreakable. However, due to a serious blunder on the part of the Soviets, some of this traffic was vulnerable to cryptanalysis. The Soviet company that manufactured the one-time pads produced around 35,000 pages of duplicate key numbers, as a result of pressures brought about by the German advance on Moscow during World War II. The duplication—which undermines the security of a one-time system—was discovered, and attempts to lessen its impact were made by sending the duplicates to widely separated users. Despite this, the reuse was detected by cryptanalysts in the US.

===Breakthrough===

The Soviet systems in general used a code to convert words and letters into numbers, to which additive keys (from one-time pads) were added, encrypting the content. When used correctly so that the plaintext is of a length equal to or less than that of a random key, one-time pad encryption is unbreakable. However, cryptanalysis by American code-breakers revealed that some of the one-time pad material had incorrectly been reused by the Soviets (specifically, entire pages, although not complete books), which allowed decryption (sometimes only partial) of a small part of the traffic.

Generating the one-time pads was a slow and labor-intensive process, and the outbreak of war with Germany in June 1941 caused a sudden increase in the need for coded messages. It is probable that the Soviet code generators started duplicating cipher pages in order to keep up with demand.

It was Arlington Hall&#x27;s Lieutenant Richard Hallock, working on Soviet &quot;Trade&quot; traffic (so called because these messages dealt with Soviet trade issues), who first discovered that the Soviets were reusing pages. Hallock and his colleagues, amongst whom were Genevieve Feinstein, Cecil Phillips, Frank Lewis, Frank Wanat, and Lucille Campbell, went on to break into a significant amount of Trade traffic, recovering many one-time pad additive key tables in the process.
A young Meredith Gardner then used this material to break into what turned out to be NKVD (and later GRU) traffic by reconstructing the code used to convert text to numbers. Gardner credits Marie Meyer, a linguist with the Signal Intelligence Service with making some of the initial recoveries of the Venona codebook. Samuel Chew and Cecil Phillips also made valuable contributions. On December 20, 1946, Gardner made the first break into the code, revealing the existence of Soviet espionage in the Manhattan Project. Venona messages also indicated that Soviet spies worked in Washington in the State Department, Treasury, Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and even the White House. Very slowly, using assorted techniques ranging from traffic analysis to defector information, more of the messages were decrypted.

Claims have been made that information from the physical recovery of code books (a partially burned one was obtained by the Finns) to bugging embassy rooms in which text was entered into encrypting devices (analyzing the keystrokes by listening to them being punched in) contributed to recovering much of the plaintext. These latter claims are less than fully supported in the open literature.

One significant aid (mentioned by the NSA) in the early stages may have been work done in cooperation between the Japanese and Finnish cryptanalysis organizations; when the Americans broke into Japanese codes during World War II, they gained access to this information. There are also reports that copies of signals purloined from Soviet offices by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were helpful in the cryptanalysis. The Finnish radio intelligence sold much of its material concerning Soviet codes to the OSS in 1944 during Operation Stella Polaris, including the partially burned code book.

===Results===
The NSA reported that (according to the serial numbers of the Venona cables) thousands of cables were sent, but only a fraction were available to the cryptanalysts. Approximately 2,200 messages were decrypted and translated; about half of the 1943 GRU-Naval Washington to Moscow messages were broken, but none for any other year, although several thousand were sent between 1941 and 1945. The decryption rate of the NKVD cables was as follows:
* 1942: 1.8%
* 1943: 15.0%
* 1944: 49.0%
* 1945: 1.5%

Out of some hundreds of thousands of intercepted encrypted texts, it is claimed under 3,000 have been partially or wholly decrypted. All the duplicate one-time pad pages were produced in 1942, and almost all of them had been used by the end of 1945, with a few being used as late as 1948. After this, Soviet message traffic reverted to being completely unreadable.

The existence of Venona decryption became known to the Soviets within a few years of the first breaks. It is not clear whether the Soviets knew how much of the message traffic or which messages had been successfully decrypted. At least one Soviet penetration agent, British Secret Intelligence Service representative to the US Kim Philby, was told about the project in 1949, as part of his job as liaison between British and US intelligence. Since all of the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time, the Soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of Venona. However, this information allowed them to alert those of their agents who might be at risk of exposure due to the decryption.

===Significance===
The decrypted messages gave important insights into Soviet behavior in the period during which duplicate one-time pads were used. With the first break into the code, Venona revealed the existence of Soviet espionage at the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Site Y (Los Alamos). Identities soon emerged of American, Canadian, Australian, and British spies in service to the Soviet government, including Klaus Fuchs, Alan Nunn May, and Donald Maclean. Others worked in Washington in the State Department, the Treasury, OSS, and even the White House.

The messages show that the US and other nations were targeted in major espionage campaigns by the Soviet Union as early as 1942. Among those identified are Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter White (the second-highest official in the Treasury Department), Lauchlin Currie (a personal aide to Franklin Roosevelt), and Maurice Halperin (a section head in the Office of Strategic Services).

The identification of individuals mentioned in Venona transcripts is sometimes problematic, since people with a &quot;covert relationship&quot; with Soviet intelligence are referenced by cryptonyms. Further complicating matters is the fact the same person sometimes had different cryptonyms at different times, and the same cryptonym was sometimes reused for different individuals. In some cases, notably Hiss, the matching of a Venona cryptonym to an individual is disputed. In many other cases, a Venona cryptonym has not yet been linked to any person. According to authors John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, the Venona transcripts identify approximately 349 Americans who they claim had a covert relationship with Soviet intelligence, though fewer than half of these have been matched to real-name identities. However, not every agent may have been communicating directly with Soviet intelligence. Each of those 349 persons may have had many others working for, and reporting only to, them.

The OSS, the predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), housed at one time or another between fifteen and twenty Soviet spies. Duncan Lee, Donald Wheeler, Jane Foster Zlatowski, and Maurice Halperin passed information to Moscow. The War Production Board, the Board of Economic Warfare, the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, and the Office of War Information, included at least half a dozen Soviet sources each among their employees.

=== Black Friday === 

In late October 1948 the Soviets began changing their ciphers one by one in rapid succession. They also stopped the use of UHF radio links from Germany and Austria to Moscow, using (overhead) landline instead. While Navy investigators thought it was a routine systems upgrade others were not so sure and later it was attributed to two Soviet spies: American William (Bill) Weisband, a linguist at Arlington Hall and British Kim Philby in the SIS. 

At this time some information was trickling in from US intercepts and rare overflights near the East-West border; but with a dearth in intelligence, not even a hint was received of the North Korean attack (approved by Stalin) on South Korea in June 1950. This led to the approval of Operation Gold in Berlin, a joint CIA/SIS operation to tap into underground telephone cables a short distance across the border in East Berlin; the scheme was based on Operation Silver a British SIS operation in Vienna. 

Operation Gold was betrayed to the NKVD/KGB by British SIS member George Blake even before it started intercepting in May 1955. But to avoid compromising Blake, it was allowed to continue to April 1956, with knowledge of the project kept inside the organisation. 

==Bearing of Venona on particular cases==
Venona has added information – some unequivocal, some ambiguous – to several espionage cases. Some known spies, including Theodore Hall and Bill Weisband, were neither prosecuted nor publicly implicated, because the Venona evidence against them was withheld.

=== &quot;19&quot; ===
The identity of the Soviet source cryptonymed &quot;19&quot; remains unclear. According to British writer Nigel West, &quot;19&quot; was Edvard Beneš, president of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile. Military historian Eduard Mark and American authors Herbert Romerstein and Eric Breindel concluded it was Roosevelt&#x27;s aide Harry Hopkins. According to American authors John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, &quot;19&quot; could be someone from the British delegation to the Washington Conference in May 1943. Moreover, they argue no evidence of Hopkins as an agent has been found in other archives, and the partial message relating to &quot;19&quot; does not indicate whether this source was a spy.

However, Vasili Mitrokhin was a KGB archivist who defected to the United Kingdom in 1992 with copies of large numbers of KGB files. He claimed Harry Hopkins was a secret Russian agent. Moreover, Oleg Gordievsky, a high-level KGB officer who also defected from the Soviet Union, reported that Iskhak Akhmerov, the KGB officer who controlled the clandestine Soviet agents in the US during the war, had said Hopkins was &quot;the most important of all Soviet wartime agents in the United States&quot;.

Alexander Vassiliev&#x27;s notes identified the source code-named &quot;19&quot; as Laurence Duggan.

===Julius and Ethel Rosenberg===
Venona has added significant information to the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, making it clear Julius was guilty of espionage, and also showing that Ethel, while not acting as a principal, still acted as an accessory who took part in Julius&#x27;s espionage activity and played a role in the recruitment of her brother for atomic espionage.

Julius and Ethel Rosenberg also had another connection to a recruit for the Soviets named David Greenglass, who was Ethel&#x27;s brother and Julius&#x27;s brother-in-law.

Venona and other recent information has shown that, while the content of Julius&#x27; atomic espionage was not as vital to the Soviets as alleged at the time of his espionage activities, in other fields it was extensive. The information Rosenberg passed to the Soviets concerned the proximity fuze, design and production information on the Lockheed P-80 jet fighter, and thousands of classified reports from Emerson Radio.

The Venona evidence indicates unidentified sources code-named &quot;Quantum&quot; and &quot;Pers&quot; who facilitated transfer of nuclear weapons technology to the Soviet Union from positions within the Manhattan Project. According to Alexander Vassiliev&#x27;s notes from KGB archive, &quot;Quantum&quot; was Boris Podolsky and &quot;Pers&quot; was Russell W. McNutt, an engineer from the uranium processing plant in Oak Ridge.

=== David Greenglass ===
David Greenglass, codename KALIBER, was the brother of Ethel Rosenberg, and would be crucial in the conviction of the Rosenbergs. Greenglass was a former Army machinist who worked at Los Alamos. He was originally meant to replace a soldier who had gone AWOL, and lied on his security clearance in order to gain access onto the project. Once Klaus Fuchs was caught, he gave up Harry Gold, who in turn, gave up Greenglass and his wife, as well as his sister and her husband. During their trial, Greenglass changed his story several times. At first, he didn&#x27;t want to implicate his sister, but when his wife was threatened, he gave up both of them. According to Gerald Markowitz and Michael Meeropol, &quot;In the Rosenberg-Sobell case, the government relied heavily upon the testimony of Greenglass, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage in exchange for a reduced sentence for himself and no indictment or prosecution for his wife, Ruth, who he alleged had aided him in committing espionage. Greenglass testified that he had passed information about the atom bomb to Gold and Rosenberg, who in turn passed it on to the Russians.&quot; In the end, Greenglass was sentenced to 15 years but was released in 1960 after serving only nine and a half.

===Klaus Fuchs===
The Venona decryptions were also important in the exposure of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs. Some of the earliest messages decrypted concerned information from a scientist at the Manhattan Project, who was referred to by the code names of CHARLES and REST. Fuchs had joined the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos in 1944 where he provided information for the development of a plutonium implosion design. He is also credited with being of great assistance to the creation of a Soviet atomic bomb. Fuchs even gave the Soviets the blueprint for the Trinity device that would be detonated at Los Alamos in July 1945. One such message from Moscow to New York, dated April 10, 1945, called information provided by CHARLES &quot;of great value.&quot; Noting that the information included &quot;data on the atomic mass of the nuclear explosive&quot; and &quot;details on the explosive method of actuating&quot; the atomic bomb, the message requested further technical details from CHARLES. Investigations based on the Venona decryptions eventually identified CHARLES and REST as Fuchs in 1949. Fuchs was eventually arrested and tried on March 1, 1950, where he confessed to four counts of espionage and received a maximum prison sentence of fourteen years.

=== Harry Gold ===
The Venona decryptions also identified Soviet spy Harry Gold as an agent of the KGB who stole blueprints, industrial formulas, and methods on their behalf from 1935 until ultimately confessing to these actions in 1950. During his years of work under the KGB, Gold operated under the code names GOOSE and ARNOLD. Gold was eager to provide his services after being initially recruited by Thomas Black on behalf of the Amtorg.

In 1935, Gold, with the assistance of Black, gained employment at the Pennsylvania Sugar Company, one of the largest producers of sugar in the world at the time. During his tenure, Gold worked under Semyon Semyonov and Klaus Fuchs. Over time, Gold began to work with Abraham Brothman, a fellow spy who was identified in Gold&#x27;s confessions for stealing industrial processes on behalf of the Soviet Union and would later be convicted for lying under oath to a grand jury.

Gold&#x27;s confessions turned out to be a major success for the FBI, as he would unveil a network of spies entrenched in the success of KGB espionage efforts. Along with Brothman, (sentenced to 15 years), David Greenglass, and Julius Rosenburg were all arrested following the interrogations of Gold. With regard to Los Alamos, Fuchs, Greenglass, and Gold all played a role in aiding the Soviet atomic espionage campaign.

===Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White===
According to the Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy, the complicity of both Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White is conclusively proven by Venona, stating &quot;The complicity of Alger Hiss of the State Department seems settled. As does that of Harry Dexter White of the Treasury Department.&quot; In his 1998 book, United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan expressed certainty about Hiss&#x27;s identification by Venona as a Soviet spy, writing &quot;Hiss was indeed a Soviet agent and appears to have been regarded by Moscow as its most important.&quot;

===Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess===

Kim Philby had access to CIA and FBI files, and more damaging, access to Venona Project briefings. When Philby learned of Venona in 1949, he obtained advance warning that his fellow Soviet spy Donald Maclean was in danger of being exposed. The FBI told Philby about an agent cryptonymed &quot;Homer&quot;, whose 1945 message to Moscow had been decoded. As it had been sent from New York and had its origins in the British Embassy in Washington, Philby, who would not have known Maclean&#x27;s cryptonym, deduced the sender&#x27;s identity. By early 1951, Philby knew US intelligence would soon also conclude Maclean was the sender and advised Moscow to extract Maclean. This led to Maclean and Guy Burgess&#x27; flight in May 1951 to Moscow, where they lived the remainder of their lives.

=== Guy Burgess ===
Guy Burgess served as a British diplomat during the developing bomb project in the United States. He became a Soviet informant after beginning his studies at the University of Cambridge, where he and his classmates (Kim Philby, Anthony Blunt, and Donald Maclean) began developing ideals against a capitalist society. Burgess began developing connections throughout college as well as his future careers. He would continue to pass on information as a BBC Radio correspondent, an MI6 intelligence officer, and as a member of the British Foreign Office. When the Korean War began, Burgess and Philby passed on information regarding movements in Korea to Moscow. Philby had been working closely with British and American intelligence, and was able to be in proximity to any intelligence findings. When the VENONA Project uncovered Julius Rosenberg (LIBERAL) and his wife Ethel, the project posted that they knew of a British spy with the codename HOMER, which Philby knew to be Maclean. Philby (codename STANLEY) reached out to Burgess to remove Maclean to the Soviet Union. Burgess at this point, was overseas in Washington DC serving in the British Foreign Office, and couldn&#x27;t do much. In 1950, he was sent back to Britain due to &quot;bad behavior&quot;, where he was able to warn Maclean. Burgess knew he was under suspicion by MI5, British counterintelligence, and Scotland Yard&#x27;s Special Branch. Both Philby and Burgess knew that out of all of the possible people to crack under pressure, Maclean was the easy choice. When Burgess finally convinced Maclean to leave, they fled to Moscow, followed by Philby shortly after.

===Soviet espionage in Australia===
In addition to British and American operatives, Australians collected Venona intercepts at a remote base in the Australian Outback. The Soviets remained unaware of this base as late as 1950.

The founding of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) by Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley in 1949 was considered highly controversial within Chifley&#x27;s own party. Until then, the left-leaning Australian Labor Party had been hostile to domestic intelligence agencies on civil-liberties grounds and a Labor government founding one seemed a surprising about-face. But the presentation of Venona material to Chifley, revealing evidence of Soviet agents operating in Australia, brought this about. As well as Australian diplomat suspects abroad, Venona had revealed Walter Seddon Clayton (cryptonym &quot;KLOD&quot;), a leading official within the Communist Party of Australia (CPA), as the chief organizer of Soviet intelligence gathering in Australia. Investigation revealed that Clayton formed an underground network within the CPA so that the party could continue to operate if it were banned. In 1950, George Ronald Richards was appointed ASIO&#x27;s deputy-director of operations for Venona, based in Sydney, charged with investigating intelligence that uncovered the eleven Australians identified in the cables that had been decoded. He continued Venona-related work in London with MI5 from November 1952 and went on to lead Operation Cabin 12, the high-profile 1953–1954 defection to Australia of Soviet spy Vladimir Petrov.

==Public disclosure==
For much of its history, knowledge of Venona was restricted even from the highest levels of government. Senior army officers, in consultation with the FBI and CIA, made the decision to restrict knowledge of Venona within the government (even the CIA was not made an active partner until 1952). Army Chief of Staff Omar Bradley, concerned about the White House&#x27;s history of leaking sensitive information, decided to deny President Truman direct knowledge of the project. The president received the substance of the material only through FBI, Justice Department, and CIA reports on counterintelligence and intelligence matters. He was not told the material came from decoded Soviet ciphers. To some degree this secrecy was counter-productive; Truman was distrustful of FBI head J. Edgar Hoover and suspected the reports were exaggerated for political purposes.

Some of the earliest detailed public knowledge that Soviet code messages from World War II had been broken came with the release of Chapman Pincher&#x27;s book, &quot;Too Secret Too Long&quot;, in 1984. Robert Lamphere&#x27;s book, &quot;The FBI-KGB War&quot;, was released in 1986. Lamphere had been the FBI liaison to the code-breaking activity and had considerable knowledge of Venona and the counter-intelligence work that resulted from it. However, the first detailed account of the Venona project, identifying it by name and making clear its long-term implications in post-war espionage, was contained in MI5 assistant director Peter Wright&#x27;s 1987 memoir, &quot;Spycatcher&quot;.

Many inside the NSA had argued internally that the time had come to publicly release the details of the Venona project, but it was not until 1995 that the bipartisan Commission on Government Secrecy, with Senator Moynihan as chairman, released Venona project materials. Moynihan wrote:

[The] secrecy system has systematically denied American historians access to the records of American history. Of late we find ourselves relying on archives of the former Soviet Union in Moscow to resolve questions of what was going on in Washington at mid-century. ... the Venona intercepts contained overwhelming proof of the activities of Soviet spy networks in America, complete with names, dates, places, and deeds.

One of the considerations in releasing Venona translations was the privacy interests of the individuals mentioned, referenced, or identified in the translations. Some names were not released because to do so would constitute an invasion of privacy. However, in at least one case, independent researchers identified one of the subjects whose name had been obscured by the NSA.

The dearth of reliable information available to the public—or even to the President and Congress—may have helped to polarize debates of the 1950s over the extent and danger of Soviet espionage in the United States. Anti-Communists suspected many spies remained at large, perhaps including some known to the government. Those who criticized the governmental and non-governmental efforts to root out and expose Communists in the United States felt these efforts were an overreaction (in addition to other reservations about McCarthyism). Public access—or broader governmental access—to the Venona evidence would certainly have affected this debate, as it is affecting the retrospective debate among historians and others now. As the Moynihan Commission wrote in its final report:

A balanced history of this period is now beginning to appear; the Venona messages will surely supply a great cache of facts to bring the matter to some closure. But at the time, the American Government, much less the American public, was confronted with possibilities and charges, at once baffling and terrifying.
The National Cryptologic Museum features an exhibit on the Venona project in its &quot;Cold War/Information Age&quot; gallery.

==Texas textbook controversy==
Controversy arose in 2009 over the Texas State Board of Education&#x27;s revision of their high school history class curricula to suggest Venona shows Senator Joseph McCarthy to have been justified in his zeal in exposing those whom he believed to be Soviet spies or communist sympathizers. Critics such as Emory University history professor Harvey Klehr assert most people and organizations identified by McCarthy, such as those brought forward in the Army-McCarthy hearings or rival politicians in the Democratic party, were not mentioned in the Venona content and that his accusations remain largely unsupported by evidence.

==Critical views==
The majority of historians are convinced of the historical value of the Venona material. Intelligence historian Nigel West believes that &quot;Venona remain[s] an irrefutable resource, far more reliable than the mercurial recollections of KGB defectors and the dubious conclusions drawn by paranoid analysts mesmerized by Machiavellian plots.&quot; However, a number of writers and scholars have taken a critical view of the translations. They question the accuracy of the translations and the identifications of cryptonyms that the NSA translations give. Writers Walter and Miriam Schneir, in a lengthy 1999 review of one of the first book-length studies of the messages, object to what they see as the book&#x27;s overconfidence in the translations&#x27; accuracy, noting that the undecrypted gaps in the texts can make interpretation difficult, and emphasizing the problem of identifying the individuals mentioned under cryptonyms. To support their critique, they cite a declassified memorandum, written in 1956 by A. H. Belmont, who was assistant to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover at the time. In the memo, Belmont discusses the possibility of using the Venona translations in court to prosecute Soviet agents and comes out strongly opposed to their use. His reasons include legal uncertainties about the admissibility of the translations as evidence, and the difficulties that prosecution would face in supporting the validity of the translations. Belmont highlights the uncertainties in the translation process, noting that the cryptographers have indicated that &quot;almost anything included in a translation of one of these deciphered messages may in the future be radically revised.&quot; He also notes the complexities of identifying people with cryptonyms, describing how the personal details mentioned for cryptonym &quot;Antenna&quot; fit more than one person, and the investigative process required to finally connect &quot;Antenna&quot; to Julius Rosenberg. The Schneirs conclude that &quot;A reader faced with Venona&#x27;s incomplete, disjointed messages can easily arrive at a badly skewed impression.&quot;

Many of the critiques of the Venona translations have been based on specific cases. The Schneirs&#x27; critique of the Venona documents was based on their decades of work on the case of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Another critique of the Venona translations came from the late Rutgers University law professor John Lowenthal, who as a law student worked as a volunteer for Alger Hiss&#x27;s defense team, and later wrote extensively on the Hiss case. Lowenthal&#x27;s critique focused on one message (Venona 1822 KGB Washington-Moscow 30 March 1945), in which the comments identified the cryptonym &#x27;Ales&#x27; as &quot;probably Alger Hiss.&quot; Lowenthal raised a number of objections to this identification, rejecting it as &quot;a conclusion psychologically motivated and politically correct but factually wrong.&quot; Lowenthal&#x27;s article led to an extended debate on the &#x27;Ales&#x27; message, and even prompted the NSA to declassify the original Russian text. Currently, Venona 1822 is the only message for which the complete decrypted Russian text has been published.

Victor Navasky, editor and publisher of &quot;The Nation&quot;, has also written several editorials highly critical of Haynes&#x27; and Klehr&#x27;s interpretation of recent work on the subject of Soviet espionage. Navasky claims the Venona material is being used to &quot;distort ... our understanding of the cold war&quot; and that the files are potential &quot;time bombs of misinformation.&quot; Commenting on the list of 349 Americans identified by Venona, published in an appendix to &quot;Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America&quot;, Navasky wrote, &quot;The reader is left with the implication—unfair and unproven—that every name on the list was involved in espionage, and as a result, otherwise careful historians and mainstream journalists now routinely refer to Venona as proof that many hundreds of Americans were part of the red spy network.&quot; Navasky goes further in his defense of the listed people and has claimed a great deal of the so-called espionage that went on was nothing more than &quot;exchanges of information among people of good will&quot; and that &quot;most of these exchanges were innocent and were within the law.&quot;

According to historian Ellen Schrecker, &quot;Because they offer insights into the world of the secret police on both sides of the Iron Curtain, it is tempting to treat the FBI and Venona materials less critically than documents from more accessible sources. But there are too many gaps in the record to use these materials with complete confidence.&quot; Schrecker believes the documents established the guilt of many prominent figures but is still critical of the views of scholars such as Haynes, arguing, &quot;complexity, nuance, and a willingness to see the world in other than black and white seem alien to Haynes&#x27; view of history.&quot;

<text>Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair (1 May 1818 – 29 May 1898) was a British scientist and Liberal politician who was Postmaster-General from 1873 to 1874.

==Early life==
Playfair was born at Chunar, Bengal, the son of George Playfair (1781–1845), the chief inspector-general of hospitals in that region, and Janet Ross (1795–1862), daughter of John Ross. The family was fairly middle class with strong academic roots in University of St Andrews, his grandfather being Rev Prof James Playfair, Principal of the University of St Andrews. All of Playfair&#x27;s siblings were sent back to Scotland to avoid the hazards of an Indian upbringing. Playfair was named after his uncle, Sir Hugh Lyon Playfair, and was educated at the University of St Andrews, the Andersonian Institute in Glasgow, and the University of Edinburgh. After going to Calcutta at the end of 1837, he became private laboratory assistant to Thomas Graham at University College, London, and in 1839 went to work under Justus Liebig at the University of Giessen.

==Early career==
After returning to Britain, Playfair became manager of a calico works in Primrose, near Clitheroe, and in 1843 was appointed Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Manchester Institution, where he was assisted by Robert Angus Smith. Two years later, he was made chemist to the Geological Survey, and subsequently became Professor in the new School of Mines. In 1848, he was elected to the Royal Society, and three years later was made Special Commissioner and a member of the executive committee of the Great Exhibition.

After the Exhibition, the Society of Arts organised a series of lectures to draw attention to the lessons which should be learned from the Exhibition. Playfair&#x27;s two lectures were devoted to technical education, which he considered in Britain to be unfit for an increasingly competitive world. In preparation for his lectures, Playfair toured France, Holland, Belgium, Germany, Austria and Scandinavia to study their education systems. His first lecture was delivered to the School of Mines, under the title &quot;Industrial Instruction on the Continent&quot;, and was published in the &quot;Records of the School of Mines&quot;. It aroused great public interest and Playfair later claimed that it gave a considerable impulse to technical education in Britain, with the government establishing the Department of Science and Art soon afterwards.

Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, Playfair also became Gentleman Usher to Prince Albert, and in 1853 was appointed Secretary of the Department of Science, in which capacity he advocated the use of poison gas against the Russians in the Crimean War. In 1855, he was a commissioner of the Exposition Universelle, and two years later became President of the Chemical Society, finally returning to Edinburgh University in 1858 as Professor of Chemistry there. In 1859 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being James David Forbes. He served as the Society&#x27;s vice president from 1864 to 1870.

==Political career==
In 1868, Playfair was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for the Universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews, being sworn of the Privy Council and made Postmaster General in Gladstone&#x27;s government in 1873. The Liberals lost power in early 1874 but on their return to office in 1880, Playfair was appointed Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, holding these posts until 1883, when he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He was subsequently President of the British Association in 1885. In February 1886 he returned to the government as Vice-President of the Committee on Education under Gladstone, a post he held until the government fell in July of the same year. He was made a member of the Council of the Duchy of Cornwall in 1889.

During the 1870s and early 1880s, anti-vaccination supporters sought to repeal UK government legislation for compulsory childhood vaccination against smallpox. Playfair&#x27;s speech to parliament in 1883 helped the government win a motion to keep compulsory vaccination by over 250 votes.

In November 1887, a meeting of the National Union of Conservative and Constitutional Associations held in Oxford passed a resolution calling for Fair Trade (a form of protectionism). The following month, Playfair defended free trade in a speech in Leeds, which was published by the Cobden Club under the title &quot;On Fair Trade and the Depression in Agriculture&quot;. He later claimed that this pamphlet sold around 100,000 copies. The veteran free trade campaigner, John Bright, wrote to Playfair and said his speech was &quot;one of the best, if not the best, spoken on the question&quot;.

Playfair delivered a speech to the City Liberal Club in London, where he claimed that economic depressions were not due to fiscal arrangements but were universal and synchronous in all industrialised nations. The advances in science, such as improved transport and the substitution of machine for manual labour, had lowered the value of labour of quantity and heightened the value of labour of quality. This, Playfair claimed, had dislocated labour. Playfair enlarged on this speech in an article for &quot;The Contemporary Review&quot; of March 1888. Afterwards, Playfair delivered a speech to the National Liberal Club, which was published as &quot;On Industrial Competition and Commercial Freedom&quot; by the Cobden Club. The Liberal Party leader, William Ewart Gladstone, wrote to Playfair to thank him for his &quot;admirable tract; so comprehensive, clear, simple in statement, rich in illustration&quot;.

Having represented Leeds South since 1885, Playfair left the House of Commons in 1892 and was ennobled as Baron Playfair, of St Andrews in the County of Fife. He served as a Lord in Waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) under Gladstone and then Lord Rosebery between 1892 and 1895. He was further honoured when he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1895 and awarded the Harben Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of Public Health in 1897. Playfair is also remembered for promoting a new cipher system invented by Charles Wheatstone, now known as the Playfair cipher.

==Later life==

Lord Playfair died at his home at Onslow Gardens in South Kensington, London, in May 1898, aged 80. His body was returned to Scotland, where he was buried in the Eastern Cemetery, St Andrews, towards the north-east corner. He was succeeded in the barony by his son from his first marriage, George James Playfair (1849–1939) who is buried with him.

A memorial fountain was erected to Playfair in St Andrews in 1899, to a design by Robert Lorimer. The main library at Imperial College in London was originally named the Lyon Playfair Library in his honour.

==Family==

His younger brothers were, William Smoult Playfair, a well known obstetrician, and Sir Lambert Playfair, a soldier and diplomat.

Playfair married three times. He firstly married Margaret Eliza Oakes, daughter of James Oakes, in 1846. After her death in August 1855 he married Jean Ann Millington, daughter of Crawley Millington, in 1857. There were children from both marriages. Jean Ann died in 1877 and is buried in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh facing the section known as &quot;Lords Row&quot;. After her death, he married Edith Russell of Boston, whose 1884 portrait is in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

==Legacy==
Playfair is credited with coining the quip &quot;cannot see a forest for the trees of which it is composed&quot;.

<doc id="173629" wikidata="Q321423" url="?curid=173629" title="Law &amp; Order">
<text>Law &amp; Order is an American police procedural and legal drama television series created by Dick Wolf and produced by Wolf Entertainment and Universal Television, launching the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise.

&quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; aired its entire run on NBC, premiering on September 13, 1990, and completing its 20th season on May 24, 2010. On September 28, 2021, after an 11-year hiatus, NBC announced that the series would be revived for a 21st season, which premiered on February 24, 2022. The revival saw the debut of new regular cast members, and the reprise of two roles by series veterans: District Attorney Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston), and Detective Kevin Bernard (Anthony Anderson). Afterwards, the series was renewed for three additional seasons.

Set and filmed in New York City, the series follows a two part approach: the first half-hour is the investigation of a crime (usually murder) and apprehension of a suspect by New York City Police Department homicide detectives, the second half is the prosecution of the defendant by the Manhattan district attorney&#x27;s office. Plots are based on real cases that recently made headlines, although the motivation for the crime and the perpetrator may be much different.

The show started using revolving door casting in season two. Among the longest running main cast members are Jerry Orbach as Detective Lennie Briscoe (seasons 3–14), S. Epatha Merkerson as Lieutenant Anita Van Buren (seasons 4–20), and Sam Waterston as District Attorney Jack McCoy (seasons 5–23; formerly Executive Assistant District Attorney).

&quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; 24 seasons are second only to its spin off &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (1999–present) for the longest-running live action scripted American primetime series. The success of the series has led to the creation of additional shows, making &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; a franchise, with a television film, several video games, and international adaptations of the series. It has won and has been nominated for numerous awards over the years, including a number of Emmy Awards.

==Production==
===History and development===
In 1988, Dick Wolf developed a concept for a new television series that was going to depict a relatively optimistic picture of the American criminal justice system. He initially toyed with the idea of calling it &quot;Night &amp; Day&quot; but then hit upon the title &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. The first half of each episode was going to follow two homicide detectives (a senior and a junior detective) and their commanding officer as they were investigating a violent crime.

The second half of the episode was going to follow the district attorney&#x27;s office and the courts as two prosecutors, with advice from the district attorney, were attempting to convict the accused. &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; was going to be able to investigate some of the larger issues of the day by focusing on stories that were based on real cases making headlines.

Wolf took the idea to then-president of Universal Television Kerry McCluggage, who pointed out the similarity to a 1963 series titled &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;, which lasted one season. The two watched the pilot of that series, in which a police officer (Ben Gazzara) arrested a man for armed robbery in the first half, and the defense attorney, played by Chuck Connors, gets the perpetrator off as the wrong guy in the second half; this was the formula of the show every week.

Wolf decided that he wanted a fresh approach to the genre. His detectives occasionally were going to be fallible. He wanted to go from police procedural to prosecution with a greater degree of realism. The prosecution was going to be the hero, a reversal of the usual formula in lawyer dramas.

Fox initially ordered 13 episodes based on the concept alone, with no pilot. Then-network head Barry Diller reversed the decision. He did not believe it was a &quot;Fox show&quot;, although he loved the idea. Wolf then went to CBS, which ordered a pilot, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Favorite Bagman&quot;, written by Wolf about corrupt city officials involved with the mob. The network liked the pilot but did not order it because there were no breakout stars.

NBC&#x27;s top executives, Brandon Tartikoff and Warren Littlefield, screened the pilot and liked it in the summer of 1989. They were concerned that the intensity of the series was not going to be able to be repeated week after week. NBC executives had enough confidence by 1990 that the innovative show may appeal to a wide audience, and they ended up ordering the series for a full season.

===Filming===
The series was shot on location in New York City and is known for its extensive use of . The interior sets were located at Chelsea Piers. For the revived version starting with Season 21, sets were reconstructed in Brooklyn. In early episodes courtroom scenes were shot at Tweed Courthouse before a courtroom set was built. The exterior of the fictional 27th precinct police station was shot outside the New York County Surrogate&#x27;s on Chambers St, while hospital scenes were filmed at the VA New York Harbour Medical Centre on East 23rd St, and Goldwater Memorial Hospital before its demolition.

In later seasons, New York City mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, attorney William Kunstler and Bronx Congressman José Serrano all appeared on the show as themselves. Local personalities also had recurring cameos as fictional characters, such as Donna Hanover and Fran Lebowitz as judges. On September 14, 2004, in New York City, a road leading to Pier 62 at Chelsea Piers (where the series was mostly shot) was renamed &quot;Law &amp; Order Way&quot; in tribute to the series.

===Music and sound effects===
The music for &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; was composed by veteran composer Mike Post and was deliberately designed to be minimal to match the abbreviated style of the series. Post wrote the theme song using electric piano, guitar, and clarinet. In addition, scene changes were accompanied by a tone generated by Post. He refers to the tone as &quot;The Clang&quot;, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Ken Tucker has referred to the sound as the &quot;ominous &quot;chung CHUNG&quot;&quot;, actor Dann Florek (in a promo) as the &quot;doink doink&quot;, and Richard Belzer as &quot;the Dick Wolf Cash Register Sound&quot;.

According to writer David Allan, 2021:

&quot;The tone moves the viewer from scene to scene, jumping forward in time with all the importance and immediacy of a judge&#x27;s gavel – which is exactly what Post was aiming for when he created it. While reminiscent of a jail door slamming...&quot;

But according to authors Susan Green and Randee Dawn:

&quot;...it is actually an of &#x27;six or seven&#x27; sounds, including the sound made by 500 Japanese men walking across a hardwood floor.&quot; The sound has become so associated with the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; brand that it was also carried over to other series of the franchise.&quot;

The British-aired Channel Five versions of seasons 7–16 of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; feature the song &quot;I&#x27;m Not Driving Anymore&quot; by Rob Dougan in the opening credits, while seasons 17–20 used the American theme.

==Casting and characters==

===Pilot===
For the 1988 pilot, George Dzundza and Chris Noth were cast as the original detectives, Sergeant Max Greevey and Detective Mike Logan. The producers felt that Dzundza would be a perfect senior police officer as he was someone the producers felt they could see themselves riding along with in a police cruiser. Noth and Michael Madsen were candidates for the role of Logan. Madsen initially was considered the perfect choice for the role, but, in a final reading, it was felt that Madsen&#x27;s acting mannerisms were repetitive, and Noth received the role instead. Rounding out the police cast, Dann Florek was cast as Captain Donald Cragen.

On the prosecutor&#x27;s side, Michael Moriarty was Dick Wolf&#x27;s choice to play Executive Assistant District Attorney Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Stone. The network, however, preferred James Naughton, but, in the end, Wolf&#x27;s choice would prevail, and Moriarty received the role. As his A.D.A., Richard Brooks and Eriq La Salle were being considered for the role of Paul Robinette. The network favored La Salle but, once again, the producers&#x27; choice prevailed, and Brooks received the role. As their boss, Roy Thinnes was cast as District Attorney Alfred Wentworth.

===Seasons 1–3===
Nearly two years passed between the pilot and production of the series. The producers held options on Dzundza, Noth, Moriarty and Brooks. Each was paid holding money for the additional year and brought back. Florek also returned. Thinnes, however, was starring in &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; and declined to return. In his place, the producers tapped Steven Hill to portray District Attorney Adam Schiff, a character loosely based on real life New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. Hill brought prestige and experience to the show, and as such, the producers allowed Hill to give insight on the direction he thought the character should go.

===Seasons 4–7===
By the end of season 3, NBC executives still felt the show did not have enough female characters. On the orders of then network president Warren Littlefield, new female characters had to be added to the cast or the show would face possible cancellation on its relegated Friday nighttime slot. Wolf realized that, since there were only six characters on the show, someone had to be dismissed. He chose to dismiss Florek and Brooks from the regular roster, and later said it was the hardest two phone calls he had ever made. Though producers initially claimed the firings (especially that of Brooks who was reported as not getting along with Moriarty) were for other reasons, Wolf confirmed that the firings were on the orders of Littlefield.

To replace Florek, S. Epatha Merkerson was cast as new squad leader Lieutenant Anita Van Buren. (Merkerson had previously guest starred as a mother of a gunshot victim in the season 1 episode &quot;Mushrooms&quot;.) To replace Brooks, Jill Hennessy was cast as Assistant District Attorney Claire Kincaid. Though no initial explanation was given on the show for the departures of Florek&#x27;s or Brooks&#x27;s characters, they would both later return in guest appearances, with Captain Cragen having been reassigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau and A.D.A. Robinette having become a defense attorney. Florek also returned to direct a few episodes, and his character was eventually added to the cast of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;.

Meanwhile, Moriarty&#x27;s behavior both on and off the set became problematic for Wolf. After a public statement in which Moriarty called Attorney General Janet Reno a &quot;psychopathic Nazi&quot; for her efforts to censor television violence, Moriarty engaged in a verbal confrontation with Reno at a dinner in Washington, D.C. Wolf asked Moriarty to tone down his comments, and Moriarty responded by quitting the show the next week. The final storyline for Ben Stone involves his resignation over guilt after a woman he compelled to testify against a Russian mobster was murdered by his cohorts. To replace Moriarty, Sam Waterston was Wolf&#x27;s first choice for the role of Executive Assistant District Attorney John James &quot;Jack&quot; McCoy Jr.; Waterston&#x27;s character was markedly different from Moriarty&#x27;s in that Jack McCoy was conceived as more emotionally stable and having more sex appeal.

Wolf dismissed Noth when his contract expired at the end of season 5, because he felt that Lennie Briscoe and Mike Logan had become too similar to each other, and the writers were having difficulty in writing their dialogue together. Furthermore, Noth had been disgruntled with the show since the dismissals of Florek and Brooks, and remained embittered against Wolf, who he felt was not a friend to his actors. The final storyline for Detective Logan involved his banishment to work on Staten Island in a domestic violence crimes unit as punishment for punching a city council member who had orchestrated the murder of a gay colleague and had managed to get acquitted of the charges. (The made-for-television film &quot;&quot;, in which Noth starred, centers on Logan&#x27;s attempt to get back into the department&#x27;s good graces.) Noth was replaced by Benjamin Bratt as Detective Reynaldo &quot;Rey&quot; Curtis, who was hired in an attempt to find an actor even sexier than Noth to join the cast.

Hennessy chose not to renew her three-year contract at the end of season 6 to pursue other projects, and Claire Kincaid was written off as being killed in a drunk driving crash. She was replaced by Carey Lowell as Assistant District Attorney Jamie Ross. Lowell remained with the show until the end of season 8, when she left to spend more time with her daughter. (Jamie Ross was written off as leaving the D.A.&#x27;s office for similar reasons.) Lowell (who later returned for a couple of guest appearances) was replaced by Angie Harmon as Assistant District Attorney Abigail &quot;Abbie&quot; Carmichael, who was conceived as being much louder and outspoken than any of her predecessors. Harmon auditioned with 85 other women, including Vanessa Williams, for the role, and was picked after Wolf heard her Texas accent.

===Seasons 8–14===
Beginning in season 8 (1997), J. K. Simmons had the recurring role of Dr. Emil Skoda, a psychiatrist who worked with the Police Department. He appeared in 41 episodes until 2004. He then reappeared for three episodes in season 20.

Bratt left the series at the end of season 9, stating it was an amicable departure and he expected to eventually return for guest appearances. (He ultimately returned for the season 20 episode &quot;Fed&quot;.) Detective Curtis was written off as leaving the force in order to take care of his wife, who was suffering from multiple sclerosis, in her final days. He was replaced by Jesse L. Martin as Detective Ed Green, who was conceived of as more of a loose cannon in the mold of Noth&#x27;s Logan than Bratt&#x27;s Curtis was. (Briscoe was described as being a recovering alcoholic, as Cragen had been. Green was described as being a recovering compulsive gambler.) In 2000, Steven Hill announced he was leaving the series after season 10. Hill, who was the last remaining member of the original cast, said his departure was mutual with the producers. He was replaced by Dianne Wiest as Interim District Attorney Nora Lewin, and Adam Schiff was written out off-screen as departing to work with Jewish charities and human-rights organizations in Europe.

The following year, Harmon left the show after three seasons (with Abbie Carmichael written off as being called on to serve the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office) and was replaced by Elisabeth Röhm as Assistant District Attorney Serena Southerlyn. The year after that, Wiest left the show after two seasons and was replaced by retiring U.S. Senator Fred Thompson as District Attorney Arthur Branch, whose character was conceived of as being much more right-leaning than his predecessors in the D.A.&#x27;s office, and was a direct reaction to the September 11 attacks. No mention was made on the show of what happened to Nora Lewin, though producers said her character was only supposed to be an interim D.A.

===Seasons 15 &amp; 16===
After 12 years on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, Orbach announced in March 2004 that he was leaving the show at the end of season 14 for the spin-off &quot;Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury&quot;. Lennie Briscoe was written off as retiring from the NYPD and later taking a position as an investigator for the D.A.&#x27;s office. He was replaced at the 27th Precinct by Detective Joe Fontana, played by Dennis Farina. At the time, Orbach would not state the reason for his departure, but it was eventually revealed that he had been battling prostate cancer (for over 10 years) and that his role on &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; was designed to be less taxing on him than his role on the original series was. However, Orbach died from his cancer on December 28, 2004, and was featured in only the first two episodes of &quot;Trial by Jury.&quot; (His character was subsequently written off as having also died off-screen, though this was not revealed on the original series until the season 18 episode &quot;Burn Card&quot;.)

In Season 15, Röhm left the show mid-season in January 2005. Röhm&#x27;s final scene on the show, in the episode &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Love&quot;, sparked controversy within the fanbase, as A.D.A. Southerlyn asked Arthur Branch if she was being fired because she was a lesbian, a fact the scripts had never hinted at until then. Wolf said Röhm&#x27;s departure was unexpected. For a few seasons, Southerlyn had often argued opposing points to McCoy and Branch, and he thought she would be better as a defender rather than a prosecutor. Southerlyn&#x27;s replacement was Annie Parisse as Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Borgia.

Martin left the show midseason to film &quot;Rent.&quot; Ed Green was temporarily written off as being shot in the line of duty and was replaced during his recovery by Detective Nick Falco, played by Michael Imperioli, who had previously guest-starred as a murder suspect in the season 6 episode &quot;Atonement&quot;. Parisse left the series at the end of season 16 (with A.D.A. Borgia written off as being murdered), and Farina shortly afterward announced that he was leaving the show to pursue other projects. (Detective Fontana was written off as having retired off-screen.)

===Seasons 17–20===
By this point, NBC executives believed the series was beginning to show its age, as the ratings had been declining since Orbach&#x27;s departure. Farina had never been popular with fans when he replaced Orbach, and it was felt that the cast just did not seem to mesh well together anymore. In an effort to revitalize the show, Wolf replaced Parisse with Alana de la Garza as Assistant District Attorney Consuela &quot;Connie&quot; Rubirosa, while Martin&#x27;s Green was promoted to senior detective and partnered with Detective Nina Cassady, played by Milena Govich, who had worked with Wolf on the short-lived series &quot;Conviction&quot; and served as the show&#x27;s first female detective of the main cast. She also briefly appeared as a bartender in the season 16 episode titled &quot;Flaw&quot;.

However, Govich proved to be even more unpopular with fans than her predecessor was and left the show after one season with the explanation being that Detective Cassady&#x27;s assignment to the precinct had been temporary and had been transferred out. She was replaced by Jeremy Sisto, who had previously guest starred as a defense attorney in the season 17 episode &quot;The Family Hour&quot;, as Detective Cyrus Lupo. Around the same time, Thompson announced he would leave the show to seek the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. (No explanation was given within the show regarding Arthur Branch&#x27;s off-screen departure.) Waterston&#x27;s character was promoted to Interim District Attorney (later made full District Attorney in season 20) and his former position was filled in by Executive Assistant District Attorney Michael Cutter, played by Linus Roache.

Martin later announced that he would leave the show for the second and last time near the end of season 18 to pursue other endeavors, and Detective Green was written off as resigning from the force due to burnout. He was replaced by Anthony Anderson as Detective Kevin Bernard. In 2010, Merkerson announced that she would leave the show at the end of season 20, with Lieutenant Van Buren given a season-long story arc involving her battling cervical cancer. However, the cancellation of the show rendered this moot.

===Season 21–present (Revival series)===
In &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;, Nellie Andreeva announced the series was returning. On November 1, 2021, Jeffrey Donovan was cast as a series regular to portray an NYPD detective, later revealed to be named Frank Cosgrove. At that time it was also reported that Sam Waterston and Anthony Anderson, who starred in earlier seasons of the series, and additional former cast members were also in talks to return. Waterston previously stated in 2015 that he would be open to returning. Other previous cast members including S. Epatha Merkerson, Jeremy Sisto and Alana de la Garza hold starring roles on &quot;Chicago Med&quot; or &quot;FBI&quot;, with both also being part of the franchise and Wolf Entertainment series. On November 23, 2021, it was announced that Hugh Dancy had been cast as an assistant district attorney and that Anderson had signed a one-year deal to return as Detective Kevin Bernard. On December 10, 2021, it was revealed that Camryn Manheim had been cast as Lieutenant Kate Dixon, the successor to Merkerson&#x27;s character, Lieutenant Anita Van Buren. Manheim portrayed minor characters in previous seasons of the series. In December 2021, Odelya Halevi was added to the cast as Assistant District Attorney Samantha Maroun. A day later, Waterston was announced to have finalized a one-year deal to return as District Attorney Jack McCoy.

On May 10, 2022, the series was renewed by NBC for a 22nd season. Later that same month, it was announced that Anderson would leave the series. On June 7, Waterston signed a new deal to return for the 22nd season, making him the longest-running cast member of the series. A week later, Mehcad Brooks joined the cast in the new season, replacing Anderson as Detective Jalen Shaw. On November 15, 2023, it was announced that Donovan would be not returning for the 23rd season. A week later, Reid Scott joined the cast for the 23rd season, replacing Donovan as Detective Vincent Riley. On February 2, 2024, it was announced that Waterston would depart from the series and Tony Goldwyn would join the cast as District Attorney Nicholas Baxter. On May 10, 2024, it was announced that Camryn Manheim would depart the series after season 23. On July 22, 2024, Maura Tierney was cast as a new lieutenant for season 24, replacing Manheim as Lieutenant Jessica Brady.

==Plot==
&quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episodes are structured into two parts. The initial segment involves police investigations, and the subsequent segment portrays legal and courtroom proceedings. The show focuses on the progression of each case rather than character backstories.

===Police investigation===
In the first half of each episode, the detectives of New York City Police Department&#x27;s fictional 27th precinct investigate a violent crime such as a murder, kidnapping, or rape. The police collect evidence and interview witnesses and potential suspects. When the evidence indicates a likely suspect, the police arrest them.

===Legal proceedings===
In the second half of each episode, the prosecutors of the Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s office take over. The prosecutors discuss deals and plea bargains, prepare the witnesses and evidence, and represent the people&#x27;s case in the trial of the accused. The prosecutors take it in turns with the defendant&#x27;s defense attorney to argue the case before a jury until an outcome is decided.

==&quot;Ripped from the headlines&quot;==
&quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episodes are often advertised as being &quot;ripped from the headlines&quot;, a slogan that refers to the franchise&#x27;s practice of conceiving stories that are partially inspired by recent headlines. There might be a few scenes that resemble a well-known headline, while the majority of the episode goes in a different direction, or there could be one character that is based on a famous individual, but the circumstances the person encounters are largely fictional, and the rest of the plot usually diverges significantly from the actual events that may have inspired the episode. This &quot;ripped from the headlines&quot; theme is reflected in the opening credits sequence that evolves from newspaper halftones to high-resolution photos. Advertisements of episodes with close real-life case parallels often use the &quot;ripped from the headlines&quot; phrase, although a textual disclaimer, within the actual episode, emphasizes that the story and characters are fictional.

Some real-life crime victims have felt used and exploited, with one lawyer, Ravi Batra, going so far as to sue the show in 2004 for libel with regard to the season 14 episode &quot;Floater&quot;, which portrayed a lawyer with a similar name and the distinctive features of Batra. Batra and the show later settled out of court for an unspecified amount.

==Episodes==

==Broadcast history==

=== Broadcast ===

The show premiered September 13, 1990, and ended its first run on May 24, 2010. 456 episodes were aired and produced. The show ran for twenty seasons on NBC. At this time, it was NBC&#x27;s longest running crime drama, and tied for longest running primetime scripted drama with &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. The first two seasons were broadcast Tuesdays at 10 p.m. From season 3 through 16 the show aired Wednesday at 10 p.m. For season 17 it moved to Fridays at 10 p.m. For seasons 18 and 19 the show shifted back to Wednesdays at 10 p.m. For season 20 the show was broadcast Fridays at 8 p.m., while in the spring it moved to Mondays at 10 p.m., where it broadcast its initial series finale on May 24, 2010. The revival (season 21–present) now airs as part of NBC&#x27;s &#x27;Law &amp; Order Thursday&#x27; lineup broadcasting Thursdays at 8 p.m. since February 24, 2022.

===Syndication and streaming===
Repeats of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; were first broadcast weekdays on cable TV network A&amp;E during the 1994–95 season. The A&amp;E broadcasts were credited with drawing a new, much larger audience to the current weekly NBC &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episodes. In 2002, A&amp;E did not renew its contract to syndicate &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; as the price was then four times the original 1995 contract price.

As of 2023, the series is being broadcast on Sundance TV, WE tv, Ion Mystery, BBC America, Bounce TV, Paramount Network and Pop.

Since mid-2020, selected seasons of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; have been available for streaming on Peacock along with &quot;Chicago Fire&quot;, &quot;Chicago P.D.&quot;, &quot;Chicago Med&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. However, unlike some shows on Peacock such as selected seasons of &quot;SVU&quot;, which are free, access to &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; requires a paid Peacock subscription.

As of December 16, 2024, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; seasons 1–20 are now available to stream on Hulu.

==Cancellation and revival==
On May 14, 2010, NBC officially canceled &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, opting instead to pick up &quot;Law &amp; Order: Los Angeles&quot; as a series and renew &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; for a twelfth season. Creator Dick Wolf continued to pressure the series&#x27; producer NBCUniversal to make a deal with TNT, which held syndication rights to the show, for a twenty-first season if an acceptable license fee could be negotiated. Talks between the two started up after upfronts. However, TNT said in a statement it was not interested in picking the show up for a new season.

After TNT discussions fell through, cable network AMC also considered reviving &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;; however, attempts to revive it failed, and according to creator Dick Wolf, the series &quot;moved into the history books&quot;.

In February 2015, NBC considered bringing the series back for a 10-episode limited series.

On September 28, 2021, NBC announced that a 21st season had been ordered. The new season was announced after plans for a new &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; spin-off, &quot;For the Defense&quot;, had fallen through during the summer. On November 1, 2021, it was announced that Jeffrey Donovan was cast as a new series regular, while Sam Waterston and Anthony Anderson would later be announced to return. On November 12, 2021, it was announced that the 21st season would premiere on February 24, 2022.

On November 23, 2021, it was announced that Hugh Dancy would join the cast for the 21st season, and it was announced Anderson would reprise his role as Detective Kevin Bernard.

On December 10, 2021, it was revealed that Camryn Manheim had been cast as Lieutenant Kate Dixon, the successor to Merkerson&#x27;s character, Lieutenant Anita Van Buren. Manheim portrayed minor characters in previous seasons of the series. On December 15, 2021, Odelya Halevi was announced to be joining the cast as Assistant District Attorney Samantha Maroun. A day later, Waterston was announced to have finalized a one-year deal to return as District Attorney Jack McCoy. &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; officially aired its first new episode in almost 12 years on February 24, 2022.

On May 10, 2022, NBC renewed the series for a twenty-second season. One week after the twenty-first season ended, On May 26, 2022, it was confirmed that Anderson would not be returning for the twenty-second season. On June 7, 2022, it was announced that Waterston would reprise his role as McCoy for the twenty-second season. On June 13, 2022, it was reported that Mehcad Brooks was cast for the twenty-second season.

On April 10, 2023, the series was renewed for its 23rd season, which premiered on January 18, 2024.

On March 21, 2024, the series was renewed for a twenty-fourth season.

==Spin-offs, crossovers, and adaptations==

The longevity and success of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; have spawned six American television series (&quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: LA&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order True Crime, and&quot; &quot;Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime)&quot; as well as a television film (&quot;&quot;). The commercial potential of the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; name outweighed initial fears that failed spin-offs (such as &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles&quot;) could erode the audience of the original series. To differentiate it from other series in the franchise, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; is often referred to as &quot;The Mother Ship&quot; by producers and critics.

&quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; has had crossover episodes with other series in its franchise. Additionally, it crossed over with &quot;New York Undercover&quot; and &quot;Conviction&quot;; while neither series belongs to the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise officially, both are part of its fictional universe, and were also created by Wolf. It also had several crossover episodes with &quot;&quot;. &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; success has spawned two other external franchises that co-exist in the same universe (&quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;FBI&quot;). &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; were connected through &quot;Chicago Fire&quot; and &quot;Chicago P.D.&quot; with crossovers between &quot;SVU&quot;. &quot;Chicago P.D.&quot; also had crossovers with &quot;FBI&quot;.

The series has been adapted for British television as &quot;Law &amp; Order: UK&quot;, with the setting being changed to London. In 2024, a Canadian produced series, &quot;Law &amp; Order Toronto: Criminal Intent&quot; premiered on Citytv; this series is based on the &quot;Criminal Intent&quot; format and set in the city of Toronto.

There have been a few unofficial &quot;rip-offs&quot; of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in other countries. For example, Singapore&#x27;s version of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; was entitled &quot;Code of Law&quot;, starring Keagan Kang and Joanne Peh as Jacob Fernandez and Sabrina Wong (the counterparts to Jack McCoy and Serena Southerlyn respectively from the original &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;), and aired a total of five seasons of 59 episodes between September 2012 and June 2020.

==Awards and honors==

&quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; has been nominated for numerous awards in the television industry over the span of its run.

Among its wins are the 1997 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Male Actor in a Drama Series for Sam Waterston in 1999 and Jerry Orbach in 2005 (awarded after his death), and numerous Edgar Awards for Best Episode in a Television Series Teleplay.

In 2002, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; was ranked #24 on TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. The show also placed #27 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;New TV Classics&quot; list.

In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; #14 on their list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.

==Home media==
A box set titled &quot;Law &amp; Order Producer&#x27;s Collection&quot; was released on VHS in 2000. The 3-tape set included six episodes of the series.

Universal Studios has separately released all twenty seasons on DVD in Region 1, along with the complete series in a box set. Law &amp; Order: The Complete Series boxed set features all 20 seasons. Each season is individually packaged (in tray-stack style), with all new cover-art (including new cover art for the seasons that have been released). The set also includes a 50-page full-color book titled &quot;The Episode Guide&quot;. Along with episode names and synopsis, there is trivia, facts about the making of the show, liner notes, and over 80 full-color photos. In Region 2, Universal Playback has released the first seven seasons on DVD in the UK. In Region 4, Universal Pictures has released all 20 seasons on DVD in Australia and New Zealand.

The DVD box set is all NTSC even though the show switched to ATSC in season 15.

<text>Belshazzar (Babylonian cuneiform: &quot;Bēl-šar-uṣur&quot;, meaning &quot;Bel, protect the king&quot;; &quot;Bēlšaʾṣṣar&quot;) was the son and crown prince of Nabonidus (), the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Through his mother, he might have been a grandson of Nebuchadnezzar II (), though this is not certain and the claims to kinship with Nebuchadnezzar may have originated from royal propaganda.

Belshazzar played a pivotal role in the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; that overthrew the king Labashi-Marduk () and brought Nabonidus to power in 556 BC. Since Belshazzar was the main beneficiary of the coup, through confiscating and inheriting Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s estates and wealth, it is likely that he was the chief orchestrator. Through proclaiming his father as the new king, Belshazzar also made himself the first-in-line to the throne. As Nabonidus was relatively old at the time, Belshazzar could expect to become king within a few years.

Nabonidus was absent from Babylon from 553 BC to 543 or 542 BC, in self-imposed &quot;exile&quot; at Tayma in Arabia, for unknown reasons. For the duration of the decade-long absence of his father, Belshazzar served as regent in Babylon. Belshazzar was entrusted with many typically royal prerogatives, such as granting privileges, commanding portions of the army, and receiving offerings and oaths, though he continued to be styled as the crown prince (&quot;mār šarri&quot;, literally meaning &quot;son of the king&quot;), never assuming the title of king (&quot;šarru&quot;). Belshazzar also lacked many of the prerogatives of kingship, most importantly he was not allowed to preside over and officiate the Babylonian New Year&#x27;s festival, which was the exclusive right of the king himself. Belshazzar&#x27;s fate is not known, but is often assumed that he was killed during Cyrus the Great&#x27;s Persian invasion of Babylonia in 539 BC, presumably at the fall of the capital Babylon on 12 October 539 BC. 

Belshazzar appears as a central character in the story of Belshazzar&#x27;s feast in the Biblical Book of Daniel, recognized by scholars as a work of historical fiction, written about four centuries after Belshazzar&#x27;s lifetime. Daniel&#x27;s Belshazzar is not malevolent (he, for instance, rewards Daniel for his interpretation of &quot;the writing on the wall&quot;), but in later Jewish tradition Belshazzar was presented as a tyrant who oppresses the Jewish people.

== Biography ==

=== Background ===

Belshazzar was the son of Nabonidus, an elderly courtier who would rise to become the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. There are various theories concerning Nabonidus&#x27;s origins, and in turn what claim he had to the throne, since it is not made clear in any contemporary sources. It is possible that Nabonidus was married to one of Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s daughters. Not only would such a connection explain Nabonidus&#x27;s rise to the throne (due to his being a member of the royal family), but it would also explain later historical traditions in which Belshazzar is described as Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s descendant. In the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible, Belshazzar is referred to as Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s (grand)son. It is alternatively possible that later traditions of Belshazzar being a descendant of Nebuchadnezzar are derived from royal propaganda, and that there was no connection to the previous ruling Chaldean dynasty. 

The ancient Greek historian Herodotus names the &quot;last great queen&quot; of the Babylonian Empire as Nitocris, though that name (nor any other name) is not attested in contemporary Babylonian sources. Herodotus&#x27;s description of Nitocris contains a wealth of legendary material that makes it difficult to determine whether he uses the name to refer to Nabonidus&#x27;s wife or mother, but William H. Shea proposed in 1982 that Nitocris may tentatively be identified as the name of Nabonidus&#x27;s wife and Belshazzar&#x27;s mother. 

The most important sources for the time of Belshazzar are the Nabonidus Chronicle, the Cyrus Cylinder, and the Verse Account of Nabonidus—which, despite its name, was commissioned by the Persian conqueror Cyrus the Great. As all of these ancient Babylonian documents were written after Babylon was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire, they are biased in favor of Cyrus, and against Nabonidus and Belshazzar.

=== Conspiracy and accession of Nabonidus ===
Belshazzar&#x27;s father was proclaimed as king in May 556 BC, and by the end of June, tablets recognising Nabonidus are known from across Babylonia. Belshazzar&#x27;s father came to the throne as a result of a conspiracy that saw the deposition and murder of the previous king, Labashi-Marduk. The sources suggest that while he was part of the conspiracy, Nabonidus had not intended, nor expected, to become king himself and he was hesitant to accept the nomination. After the accession of his father, Belshazzar emerges in the sources as a prominent businessman and the head of a wealthy household, a role that was typically not picked up by members of the royal family in the Neo-Babylonian period. The only other similar case is Neriglissar, though Neriglissar lacked royal blood and had not been the intended successor to the throne, and abandoned his estates upon becoming king, seemingly entrusting them to Labashi-Marduk, his crown prince, and a figure of unclear connections called Nabu-sabit-qate. Whereas Neriglissar&#x27;s career as a businessman prior to becoming king can be followed through a trail of surviving business documents, Belshazzar appears to have become a prominent member of the Babylonian oligarchy overnight (Belshazzar, in contrast to his co-conspirators was notably not a member of the old Babylonian aristocracy), not being mentioned in any business documents or private transactions prior to Nabonidus becoming king.

By examining surviving documents from Belshazzar&#x27;s time as crown prince, it appears that the estates of Neriglissar&#x27;s family were confiscated after Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s death and that they were claimed and taken over by Belshazzar. This is supported by documents describing business transactions of Belshazzar mentioning the same locations, and even the same household and servants, as similar earlier documents of Neriglissar. Since there is little change in the prominent members of Neriglissar&#x27;s and Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s former household under Belshazzar, it is probable that Belshazzar becoming the master of the household was met with relatively little opposition. Through the deposition of Labashi-Marduk, Belshazzar had positioned himself to become the heir of one of Babylonia&#x27;s wealthiest families. Belshazzar is recorded as owning lands throughout Babylonia, for instance owning an agricultural settlement near Uruk.

As he was clearly the main beneficiary of the coup, Belshazzar was likely the chief orchestrator of the conspiracy ended in the deposition and death of Labashi-Marduk. Because he could hardly proclaim himself as king while his father was still alive, Belshazzar proclaimed Nabonidus as king. As Nabonidus was relatively old at the time, his reign could be expected to be brief and transitional, meaning that Belshazzar could expect to inherit the throne within a few years.

=== Regent in Babylon ===

Nabonidus left Babylon in May 553 BC to campaign in the west. He eventually led his forces into Arabia, conquering several cities, including the city of Tayma. Nabonidus made Tayma his provisional seat and he would stay there for about a decade, not returning to Babylon until September or October of 543 or 542 BC. October 543 BC is the return date most supported by surviving Babylonian documentation. The purpose for this prolonged stay, effectively self-exile, in Tayma is unclear and debated. During Nabonidus&#x27;s absence, Belshazzar was put in charge of the administration in Babylonia. Though this period has often been dubbed a &quot;co-regency&quot;, Belshazzar never assumed an official title. The Verse Account of Nabonidus, a biased document probably written after Nabonidus was deposed by Cyrus the Great, states that Nabonidus entrusted Belshazzar with the kingship, but there are no records of Belshazzar assuming the royal title. Though it is clear that Belshazzar during his father&#x27;s absence assumed many responsibilities typically only held by the king, several prerogatives were also kept solely by Nabonidus. These include:
* Belshazzar never assumed, and was not allowed to use, the title of king (&quot;šarru&quot;), which was reserved for Nabonidus. Throughout the period of his father&#x27;s absence, even though he was the effective ruler of Babylonia, contemporary documents continue to refer to Belshazzar as the crown prince (&quot;mār šarri&quot;, literally meaning &quot;son of the king&quot;). The only sources that refer to Belshazzar as king, rather than crown prince, are later Greek and Jewish sources that do so erroneously. Though he is never identified as king, several contemporary Babylonian documents refer to both Nabonidus and Belshazzar as &quot;my lord&quot;, a designation usually reserved for the king alone.
* Belshazzar was not allowed to date documents after his own &quot;regnal years&quot;. No documents are dated to the &quot;reign of Belshazzar&quot;, and no documents mention both Belshazzar and Nabonidus as if there was a formal co-regency. Instead, documents from the period in which Belshazzar was regent continued to be dated after the years of Nabonidus&#x27;s reign.
* Belshazzar was not allowed to officiate and oversee the Babylonian New Year&#x27;s festival, which was the duty of the king. The festival was not celebrated throughout Nabonidus&#x27;s absence, as Belshazzar was not allowed to take up the king&#x27;s role in the ceremonies, and only resumed after Nabonidus returned to Babylon.
* Belshazzar is not mentioned in building inscriptions, which usually mention the king responsible. Even during the period of Nabonidus&#x27;s absence, he is mentioned in building inscriptions in Babylonia as a builder and excavator as if he was actively ruling at the time, with no known references to Belshazzar. In some cases, such as a ritual performed at the tempel of Bunene in Sippar, inscriptions attribute it to Nabonidus while surviving letters prove that Belshazzar was responsible.

Though Belshazzar&#x27;s authority was thus limited, he also was allowed, and assumed, certain royal responsibilities. These include:

* Contemporary documents record &quot;rēḫātu&quot; (literally &quot;remains&quot;, leftovers from food offerings presented to statues of deities) being sent to both Belshazzar and Nabonidus during the regency. Otherwise, &quot;rēḫātu&quot; is only recorded as having been sent to kings, receiving the remainders of cultic food having been an exclusive right of kings.
* In Babylonia, temples usually carried out offerings to the king, such as sacrificing a specified number of sheep. Prior to and after Belshazzar&#x27;s regency, surviving texts only contain references to offerings to the king (i.e. Nabonidus), but during the period of the regency there are references to both &quot;offerings to the king&quot; and &quot;offerings to the son of the king&quot;.
* In the Neo-Babylonian Empire, oaths were typically sworn by the king, and several gods, by individuals who were going to conduct various services. Though oaths for most of the regency only refer to Nabonidus, some oaths from late in the regency were sworn by &quot;the majesty of Nabonidus, king of Babylon, and Belshazzar, his son&quot;, or even by &quot;the majesty of Nabonidus and Belshazzar&quot;. As this phenomenon only began late in the regency period, it is not clear whether this was a prerogative that had been granted to Belshazzar, or if he inserted his name into oaths in violation of an agreement with his father.
* There may have been a division of the Babylonian army. The Verse Account of Nabonidus states that Nabonidus campaigned in Arabia with the &quot;army of Akkad&quot; (possibly referring to troops of Babylonian origin) whereas Belshazzar was entrusted at home with the &quot;army of all the lands&quot; (possibly referring to troops of foreign origin). Babylonian chronicles refer to the crown prince being stationed at home in Babylonia with &quot;his army&quot;.
* Belshazzar could grant royal privileges identical to those granted by kings. One preserved document, which regards the granting of the privilege to cultivate a tract of land belonging to the Eanna temple in Uruk, is virtually identical to similar privileges issued by Nabonidus, though it is specified to have been issued by Belshazzar. As he could lease out temple land, this suggests that Belshazzar, in administrative matters, could act with full royal power. He was clearly the highest legal authority in Babylonia during Nabonidus&#x27;s absence. Still, orders by Nabonidus superseded orders by Belshazzar. In one case, sacred garments that Belshazzar ordered to be granted to a temple in Uruk were held back because Nabonidus had given a contrary order before departing for Tayma. Nabonidus also sometimes sent orders to Belshazzar, which Belshazzar was forced to respect and implement.

The events that transpired in Babylonia during Belshazzar&#x27;s regency are not well known, owing to a lack of surviving sources. It is clear that the New Year&#x27;s festival was not celebrated, and that there was concern regarding the rising power of the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great. The Babylonian chronicles describe the actions and conquests of Cyrus in detail throughout Belshazzar&#x27;s regency. As Nabonidus&#x27;s stay in Tayma continued, Belshazzar became acutely aware of the threat presented by the Achaemenids, as he is recorded as having expended resources at projects in Sippar and nearby defenses. In 546 BC, Cyrus the Great crossed the Tigris to invade Lydia, ostensibly a Babylonian ally, and though Belshazzar took up a defensive position with his army, perhaps expecting a sudden Persian attack against Babylonia itself, no aid was sent to the Lydians, who were swiftly conquered by Cyrus. It is possible that Belshazzar had campaigned against the Persians on Lydia&#x27;s behalf a year prior, in 547 BC. The fall of Lydia in 546 BC meant that the Neo-Babylonian Empire was now effectively encircled by a stronger kingdom which had nearly unlimited resources at its disposal. It seems likely that skirmishes along the border were frequent from then until Babylon&#x27;s fall.

It is possible that a noteworthy return to orthodox Babylonian religion, following early attempts by Nabonidus to exalt the moon god Sîn over the traditional Babylonian supreme deity Marduk, can be attributed to Belshazzar. It may even have been Belshazzar who convinced his father to stay away from Babylonia in the first place, fearing a confrontation with the Babylonian oligarchy and clergy over his father&#x27;s religious beliefs. It is probable that Nabonidus, a reformer, and Belshazzar, apparently more religiously conservative, did not see eye to eye in religious matters. Belshazzar appears to have worked to restore Marduk&#x27;s status in his father&#x27;s absence. Upon Nabonidus&#x27;s return to Babylon, Belshazzar was demoted from his administrative responsibilities and officials he had appointed were dismissed. Nabonidus also had certain inscriptions made during the period of the regency edited to add prayers urging Belshazzar and the people of Babylonia to accept and receive Sîn&#x27;s blessing.

=== Fate ===
Regardless of any potential animosity between Nabonidus and Belshazzar, Belshazzar retained the status of crown prince and intended successor, as a handful of documents still reference the &quot;son of the king&quot;. Otherwise his status and position after Nabonidus&#x27;s return is never made clear. The sources also do not make Belshazzar&#x27;s location clear, but it appears that he was stationed some distance away from Babylon, but that he also was no longer in Sippar, where he had stationed himself in 546 BC out of fear of Cyrus. One possibility, suggested by Paul-Alain Beaulieu, is that Belshazzar was put in charge of Babylonia&#x27;s defense and was moving with the army along the northern and eastern border.

Belshazzar partook in Babylon&#x27;s defense against the invasion by Cyrus the Great in 539 BC. After a decisive victory at the battle of Opis, the Persian army, on 12 October, led by Ugbaru, entered Babylon without a fight. The last tablet dated to Nabonidus&#x27;s reign is from Uruk and is dated to 13 October, which is considered the end date of his reign. Nabonidus was captured and possibly exiled to Carmania. Belshazzar&#x27;s fate is not known, since none of the sources record it.&#x27; It is often assumed that Belshazzar was killed by the Persians at Babylon when the city fell, on 12 October. He may have alternatively been killed already at the battle of Opis, captured and executed, or exiled together with his father.&#x27;

=== Portrayal in the Book of Daniel ===

In the Book of Daniel, Belshazzar (, &quot;Bēlšaʾṣṣar&quot;) plays a significant role in the tale of Belshazzar&#x27;s feast, a variation on the story of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s madness showing what happens when a king does not repent. During a feast, Babylonians eat and drink from the holy vessels of Yahweh&#x27;s temple, and &quot;king&quot; Belshazzar sees a hand writing the words &quot;mene, mene, tekel, upharsin&quot; on a wall. Daniel interprets the writing as a judgment from Yahweh, the god of Israel, foretelling the fall of Babylon. Daniel tells Belshazzar that because he has not given honor to God, his kingdom will be given to the Medes and Persians. Belshazzar is killed that night, and Darius the Mede takes the kingdom.

The broad consensus among scholars is that the Book of Daniel was compiled shortly after the Maccabean Revolt in the 160s BC. The story of Belshazzar&#x27;s feast is thus deemed historical fiction, and several details are not consistent with historical facts. Belshazzar is portrayed as the king of Babylon and &quot;son&quot; of Nebuchadnezzar, though he was actually the son of Nabonidus—one of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s successors—and he never became king in his own right, nor did he lead the religious festivals as the king was required to do. In the story, the conqueror who inherits Babylon is Darius the Mede, but no such individual is known to history. This is typical of the &quot;tale of court contest&quot; in which historical accuracy is not an essential element.

=== Portrayal in later Jewish tradition ===
In the Book of Daniel, Belshazzar is not malevolent (he rewards Daniel and raises him to high office). The later authors of the Talmud and the Midrash emphasize the tyrannous oppression of his Jewish subjects, with several passages in the Prophets interpreted as referring to him and his predecessors. For example, in the passage, &quot;As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him&quot; (Amos ), the lion is said to represent Nebuchadnezzar, and the bear, equally ferocious if not equally courageous, is Belshazzar. The Babylonian kings are often mentioned together as forming a succession of impious and tyrannical monarchs who oppressed Israel and were therefore foredoomed to disgrace and destruction. Isaiah , &quot;And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant and son and grandchild, saith the Lord&quot;, is applied to the trio: &quot;Name&quot; to Nebuchadnezzar, &quot;remnant&quot; to Amel-Marduk, &quot;son&quot; to Belshazzar, and &quot;grandchild&quot; Vashti (ib.). The command given to Abraham to cut in pieces three heifers () as a part of the covenant established between him and his God was thus elucidated as symbolizing Babylonia, which gave rise to three kings, Nebuchadnezzar, Amel-Marduk, and Belshazzar, whose doom is prefigured by this act of &quot;cutting to pieces&quot; (Midrash Genesis Rabbah xliv.).

The Midrash literature enters into the details of Belshazzar&#x27;s death. Thus the later tradition states that Cyrus and Darius were employed as doorkeepers of the royal palace. Belshazzar, being greatly alarmed at the mysterious handwriting on the wall, and apprehending that someone in disguise might enter the palace with murderous intent, ordered his doorkeepers to behead anyone who attempted to force an entrance that night, even though such person should claim to be the king himself. Belshazzar, overcome by sickness, left the palace unobserved during the night through a rear exit. On his return, the doorkeepers refused to admit him. In vain did he pled that he was the king. They said, &quot;Has not the king ordered us to put to death anyone who attempts to enter the palace, though he claims to be the king himself?&quot; Suiting the action to the word, Cyrus and Darius grasped a heavy ornament forming part of a candelabrum, and with it shattered the skull of their royal master (Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah 3:4).
