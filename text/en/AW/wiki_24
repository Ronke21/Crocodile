<text>The White Stripes were an American rock duo formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1997. The group consisted of Jack White (guitar, keyboards, piano, vocals) and Meg White (drums, percussion, vocals). They were a leading group of 2000s indie rock and the decade&#x27;s garage rock revival.

Beginning in the late 1990s, the White Stripes sought success within the Detroit music scene, releasing six singles and two albums. They found commercial success with their third album, &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; (2001), which received critical acclaim and propelled them to the forefront of the garage rock revival. Their fourth album, &quot;Elephant&quot; (2003), drew further success and won the band their first Grammy Awards. The band experimented extensively on their fifth album, &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot; (2005). They returned to their blues roots with their sixth and final album, &quot;Icky Thump&quot; (2007), which was praised like the band&#x27;s earlier albums. After a lengthy hiatus from performing and recording, the band dissolved in 2011.

The White Stripes used a low-fidelity approach to writing and recording. Their music featured a melding of garage rock and blues influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo were noted for their mysterious public image, their fashion and design aesthetic which featured a simple color scheme of red, white, and black—which was used on every album and single cover they released—and their fascination with the number three. They made selective media appearances, and were the subject of the documentary &quot;Under Great White Northern Lights&quot; (2009).

The White Stripes have released six studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, and one extended play. They have received numerous accolades, including six Grammy Awards from eleven nominations. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; on their &quot;200 Definitive Albums&quot; list. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; and &quot;Elephant&quot; on their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and named the White Stripes the sixth greatest duo of all time in 2015. The band was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023, their first year of eligibility, but were not inducted; they were again nominated in 2025.

==History==

===1996–1999: Early years, formation and &quot;The White Stripes&quot;===
In high school, Jack Gillis (as he was then known) met Meg White at the Memphis Smoke—the restaurant where she worked and where he would read his poetry at open mic nights. The two became friends, and began to frequent the coffee shops, local music venues, and record stores of the area. By this time, Gillis was already playing drums with musician friends, including his upholstery apprenticeship mentor, Brian Muldoon. In 1994, he got his first professional job as the drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober &amp; the Peas. After dating for several years, Gillis and White married on September 21, 1996. Contrary to convention, he took his wife&#x27;s surname. Shortly after, Goober &amp; the Peas broke up, but Jack continued to play in other bands, such as the garage punk band the Go (he played lead guitar on their 1999 album &quot;Whatcha Doin&#x27;&quot;), the Hentchmen, and Two-Star Tabernacle.

On Bastille Day 1997, Meg started learning to play the drums. In Jack&#x27;s words, &quot;When she started to play drums with me, just on a lark, it felt liberating and refreshing. There was something in it that opened me up.&quot; The couple then became a band and, while they considered calling themselves Bazooka and Soda Powder, they settled on the White Stripes. Jack explained the name&#x27;s origin: &quot;Meg loves peppermints, and we were going to call ourselves the Peppermints. But since our last name was White, we decided to call it the White Stripes. It revolved around this childish idea, the ideas kids have—because they are so much better than adult ideas, right?&quot; From the beginning, they established certain motifs: publicly pretending to be brother and sister, outfitting their production in only black, red, and white, and heavily using the number &quot;three&quot;. White has explained that they used these colors to distract from the fact that they were young, white musicians playing &quot;black music&quot;. They were also noted for their lack of a bass player, and their general refusal to be interviewed separately.

The White Stripes had their first live performance on August 14, 1997, at the Gold Dollar bar in Detroit. They began their career as part of the Michigan underground garage rock scene, playing with local bands such as the Hentchmen, the Dirtbombs, the Gories, and Rocket 455. In 1998, Dave Buick—owner of an independent, Detroit-based, garage-punk label called Italy Records—approached the band at a bar and asked if they would like to record a single. Jack initially declined, believing it would be too expensive, but he eventually reconsidered when he realized that Buick was offering to pay for it. Their debut single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Shake Hands&quot;, was released on vinyl in February 1998 with an initial pressing of 1,000 copies. This was followed in October 1998 by the single &quot;Lafayette Blues&quot; which, again, was only released on vinyl with copies.

In 1999, the White Stripes signed with the California-based label Sympathy for the Record Industry. In March 1999, they released the single &quot;The Big Three Killed My Baby&quot;, followed by their debut album, &quot;The White Stripes&quot;, on June 15, 1999. The self-titled debut was produced by Jack and engineered by American music producer Jim Diamond at his Ghetto Recorders studio in Detroit. The album was dedicated to the seminal Mississippi Delta blues musician Son House, an artist who influenced Jack. The track &quot;Cannon&quot; from &quot;The White Stripes&quot; contains part of an a cappella version, as performed by House, of the traditional American gospel blues song &quot;John the Revelator&quot;. The White Stripes also covered House&#x27;s song &quot;Death Letter&quot; on their follow-up album, &quot;De Stijl&quot;. Looking back on their debut during a 2003 interview with &quot;Guitar Player&quot;, Jack said, &quot;I still feel we&#x27;ve never topped our first album. It&#x27;s the most raw, the most powerful, and the most Detroit-sounding record we&#x27;ve made.&quot; AllMusic said of the album: &quot;Jack White&#x27;s voice is a singular, evocative combination of punk, metal, blues, and backwoods while his guitar work is grand and banging with just enough lyrical touches of slide and subtle solo work... Meg White balances out the fretwork and the fretting with methodical, spare, and booming cymbal, bass drum, and snare... All D.I.Y. punk-country-blues-metal singer-songwriting duos should sound this good.&quot;

At the end of 1999, the White Stripes released &quot;Hand Springs&quot; as a 7&quot; split single with fellow Detroit band the Dirtbombs on the B-side. 2,000 copies came free with the pinball fanzine &quot;Multiball&quot;. The record is currently—like the majority of vinyl records by the White Stripes—out of print and difficult to find.

=== 2000–2002: &quot;De Stijl&quot; and &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; ===

Jack and Meg divorced in March 2000. The White Stripes were scheduled to perform at a local music lounge soon after they separated. Jack assumed the band was over and asked Buick and nephew Ben Blackwell to perform with him in the slot that had been booked for the White Stripes. However, the day they were supposed to perform, Meg convinced Jack that the White Stripes should continue and the band reunited. The White Stripes&#x27; second album, &quot;De Stijl&quot; (Dutch for &quot;The Style&quot;), was released on the Sympathy for the Record Industry label on June 20, 2000. Considered a cult classic and self-recorded on an 8-track analog tape in Jack&#x27;s living room, &quot;De Stijl&quot; displays the simplicity of the band&#x27;s blues and &quot;scuzzy garage rock&quot; fusion prior to their breakthrough success.

The album title derives from the Dutch art movement of the same name; common elements of the De Stijl aesthetic are demonstrated on the album cover, which sets the band members against an abstract background of rectangles and lines in red, black and white. The album was dedicated to furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld of the De Stijl movement, as well as to the influential Georgia bluesman Blind Willie McTell. &quot;De Stijl&quot; eventually reached number 38 on &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Independent Albums chart in 2002, around the time the White Stripes&#x27; popularity began establishing itself. One &quot;New York Times&quot; critic at the time said that the Stripes typified &quot;what many hip rock fans consider real music.&quot;

&quot;Party of Special Things to Do&quot; was released as a 7&quot; on Sub Pop in December 2000. It comprised three songs originally performed by Captain Beefheart, an experimental blues rock musician.

The White Stripes&#x27; third album, &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;, was released on July 3, 2001, on Sympathy for the Record Industry. The band enjoyed its first significant success the following year with the major label re-release of the album on V2 Records. Its stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK, and in the US soon afterward, making the White Stripes one of the most acclaimed bands of 2002. Several outlets praised their &quot;back to basics&quot; approach. After their first appearance on network TV (a live set on &quot;The Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn&quot;), Joe Hagan of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared, &quot;They have made rock rock again by returning to its origins as a simple, primitive sound full of unfettered zeal.&quot;

&quot;White Blood Cells&quot; peaked at number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching Gold record status by selling over 500,000 albums. It reached number 55 in the United Kingdom, being bolstered in both countries by the single &quot;Fell in Love with a Girl&quot; and its accompanying Lego-animation music video directed by Michel Gondry. The video won three awards at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards: Breakthrough Video, Best Special Effects, and Best Editing, and the band played the song live at the event. It was also nominated for Video of the Year, but fell short of winning. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; rated &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; as the fourteenth greatest album of 2000–2005, while Pitchfork Media ranked it eighth on their list of the top 100 albums from 2000 to 2004.

In 2002, George Roca produced and directed a concert film about the band titled &quot;Nobody Knows How to Talk to Children&quot;. It chronicles the White Stripes&#x27; four-night stand at New York City&#x27;s Bowery Ballroom in 2002, and contains live performances and behind-the-scenes footage. Its 2004 release was suppressed by the band&#x27;s management, however, after they discovered that Roca had been showing it at the Seattle Film Festival without permission. According to the band, the film was &quot;not up to the standards our fans have come to expect&quot;; even so, it remains a highly prized bootleg. Also in 2002, they appeared as musical guests on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

=== 2003–2006: &quot;Elephant&quot; and &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot; ===
The White Stripes&#x27; fourth album, &quot;Elephant&quot;, was recorded in 2002 over the span of two weeks with British recording engineer Liam Watson at his Toe Rag Studios in London. Jack self-produced the album with antiquated equipment, including a duct-taped 8-track tape machine and pre-1960s recording gear. In a 2017 interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Jack said &quot;We had no business being in the mainstream. We assumed the music we were making was private, in a way. We were from the scenario where there are fifty people in every town. Something about us was beyond our control, though. Now it&#x27;s five hundred people, now it&#x27;s a second night, what is going on? Is everybody out of their minds?&quot; &quot;Elephant&quot; was released in 2003 on V2 in the US, and on XL Recordings in England. It marked the band&#x27;s major label debut and was their first UK chart-topping album, as well as their first US Top 10 album (at number six). The album eventually reached double platinum certification in Britain, and platinum certification in the United States. To promote the album, they made several appearances on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in 2003, and they collaborated with Conan O&#x27;Brien frequently afterwards.

&quot;Elephant&quot; garnered critical acclaim upon its release. It received a perfect five-out-of-five-star rating from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, and enjoys a 92-percent positive rating on Metacritic. AllMusic said the album &quot;sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid, and stunning than its predecessor... Darker and more difficult than &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;.&quot; &quot;Elephant&quot; was notable for Jack&#x27;s first guitar solos, and critics also praised Meg&#x27;s drumming. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed Jack at number 17 on its list of &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; and included Meg on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Drummers of All Time&quot;. &quot;Elephant&quot; was ranked number 390 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2009, the album came in at number 18 in NME&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Greatest Albums of the decade&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; referred to the album as the pinnacle of the White Stripes&#x27; time as a band and one of Jack White&#x27;s best works of his career.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, was the band&#x27;s most successful and topped the Billboard rock charts. Its success was followed with a cover of Burt Bacharach&#x27;s &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot;. The album&#x27;s third single was the successful &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot;. &quot;There&#x27;s No Home for You Here&quot; was the fourth single. In 2004, the album won a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album, while &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; won a Grammy for Best Rock Song. Also in 2004, the band released its first music film &quot;Under Blackpool Lights&quot;, which was shot entirely on super 8 film and was directed by Dick Carruthers.In 2005, Jack began working on songs for the band&#x27;s next album at his home. He played with different techniques than in past albums, trading in his electric guitar for an acoustic on all but a few of the tracks, as his trademark riff-based lead guitar style is overtaken by a predominantly rhythmic approach. The White Stripes&#x27; fifth album, &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot;, was released in 2005 on the V2 label. The title is an allusion to a Biblical quotation Jesus made to the Apostle Simon Peter from the Gospel of Matthew 16:23 of the New Testament (in the King James Version, the quotation is slightly different: &quot;Get thee behind me, Satan&quot;). Another theory about this title is that Jack and Meg White read James Joyce&#x27;s story collection &quot;Dubliners&quot; (published 1914) and used a line from the final story &quot;The Dead&quot; to title this album. The title is also a direct quotation from Who bassist John Entwistle&#x27;s solo song &quot;You&#x27;re Mine&quot;.

With its reliance on piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba on &quot;The Nurse&quot; and &quot;Forever For Her (Is Over For Me)&quot;, &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot; did not feature the explicit blues and punk styles that dominated earlier White Stripes albums. However, despite this, the band was critically lauded for their &quot;fresh, arty reinterpretations of their classic inspirations.&quot; It has garnered positive reactions from fans, as well as critical acclaim, receiving more Grammy nominations as well as making them one of the must-see acts of the decade. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it the third best album of the year and it received the Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album in 2006.

Three singles were released from the album, the first being &quot;Blue Orchid&quot;, a popular song on satellite radio and some FM stations. The second and third singles were &quot;My Doorbell&quot; and &quot;The Denial Twist&quot;, respectively, and music videos were made for the three singles. &quot;My Doorbell&quot; was nominated for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

The White Stripes postponed the Japanese leg of their world tour after Jack strained his vocal cords, with doctors recommending that Jack not sing or talk for two weeks. After a full recovery, he returned to the stage in Auckland, New Zealand to headline the Big Day Out tour. While on the British leg of the tour, Jack changed his name from Jack White to &quot;Three quid&quot;.

On October 2, 2005, Jim Diamond—the owner and operator of Ghetto Recorders recording studio—filed a lawsuit against the band and Third Man Records for &quot;breach of contract&quot;. In the suit, he claimed that as the co-producer, mixer, and editor on the band&#x27;s debut album, and mixer and engineer on &quot;De Stijl&quot;, he was due royalties for &quot;mechanical rights&quot;. The band filed a counterclaim on May 16 of that year, requesting damages against Diamond and an official court declaration denying him rights to the material. Diamond lost the suit, with the jury determining that he was not instrumental in crafting the band&#x27;s sound. The White Stripes released a cover version of Tegan and Sara&#x27;s song &quot;Walking with a Ghost&quot; on iTunes in November 2005. The song was later released in December as the &quot;Walking with a Ghost&quot; EP featuring four other live tracks.

In October 2006, it was announced on the official White Stripes website that there would be an album of avant-garde orchestral recordings consisting of past music written by Jack called &quot;Aluminium&quot;. The album was made available for pre-order on November 6, 2006, to great demand from the band&#x27;s fans; the LP version of the project sold out in a little under a day. The project was conceived by Richard Russell, founder of XL Recordings, who co-produced the album with Joby Talbot. It was recorded between August 2005 and February 2006 at Intimate Studios in Wapping, London using an orchestra. Before the album went out of print, it was available exclusively through the &quot;Aluminium&quot; website in a numbered limited edition of 3,333 CDs with 999 LPs.

=== 2007–2008: &quot;Icky Thump&quot; and hiatus ===

On January 12, 2007, V2 Records announced that, due to being under the process of reconstruction, it would no longer release new White Stripes material, leaving the band without a label. However, as the band&#x27;s contract with V2 had already expired, on February 12, 2007, it was confirmed that the band had signed a single album deal with Warner Bros. Records. Their sixth album, &quot;Icky Thump&quot;, was released on June 19, 2007. Following the well-received &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot;, &quot;Icky Thump&quot; marked a return to the punk, garage rock and blues influences for which the band is known. It was recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville and took almost three weeks to record—the longest of any White Stripes album. It would also be their first album with a title track. The album&#x27;s release came on the heels of a series of concerts in Europe and one in North America at Bonnaroo. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, three tracks were previewed to &quot;NME&quot;: &quot;Icky Thump&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What Love Is (You Just Do as You&#x27;re Told)&quot; and &quot;Conquest&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; described the tracks as &quot;an experimental, heavy sounding 70s riff&quot;, &quot;a strong, melodic love song&quot; and &quot;an unexpected mix of big guitars and a bold horn section&quot;, respectively.

On the US Billboard Charts dated May 12, 2007, &quot;Icky Thump&quot;—the first single—became the band&#x27;s first Top 40 single, charting at number 26, and later charted at number 2 in the UK. &quot;Icky Thump&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 223,000 copies sold. By late July, &quot;Icky Thump&quot; was certified gold in the United States. As of March 8, 2008, the album has sold 725,125 copies in the US. On February 10, 2008, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.

On April 25, 2007, the duo announced that they would embark on a tour of Canada, performing in all 10 provinces, plus Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories. In the words of Jack: &quot;Having never done a tour of Canada, Meg and I thought it was high time to go whole hog. We want to take this tour to the far reaches of the Canadian landscape. From the ocean to the permafrost. The best way for us to do that is ensure that we perform in every province and territory in the country, from the Yukon to Prince Edward Island. Another special moment of this tour is the show which will occur in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia on July 14, the White Stripes&#x27; Tenth Anniversary.&quot; Canadian fiddler Ashley MacIsaac opened for the band at the Savoy Theatre, Glace Bay show; earlier in 2007, MacIsaac and Jack had discovered that they were distantly related. It was also at this time that White learned he was related to Canadian fiddle player Natalie MacMaster.
On June 24, 2007, just a few hours before their concert at Deer Lake Park, the White Stripes began their cross-Canada tour by playing a 40-minute set for a group of 30 kids at the Creekside Youth Centre in Burnaby. The Canadian tour was also marked by concerts in small markets, such as Glace Bay, Whitehorse and Iqaluit, as well as by frequent &quot;secret shows&quot; publicized mainly by posts on The Little Room, a White Stripes fan messageboard. Gigs included performances at a bowling alley in Saskatoon, a youth center in Edmonton, a Winnipeg Transit bus and The Forks park in Winnipeg, a park in Whitehorse, the YMCA in downtown Toronto, the Arva Flour Mill in Arva, Ontario, and Locas on Salter (a pool hall) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. They also played a historic one-note show on George Street in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, in an attempt to break a Guinness World Record for the shortest concert. Though it was denied induction as a record, media publications have called it the shortest concert. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John&#x27;s. Video clips from several of the secret shows have been posted to YouTube. As well, the band filmed its video for &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What Love Is (You Just Do as You&#x27;re Told)&quot; in Iqaluit.

After the conclusion of the Canadian dates, they embarked on a brief U.S. leg of their tour, which was to be followed by a break before more shows in the fall. But before their last show—in Southaven, Mississippi—Ben Blackwell (Jack&#x27;s nephew and the group&#x27;s archivist) says that Meg approached him and said, &quot;This is the last White Stripes show&quot;. He asked if she meant of the tour, but she responded, &quot;No. I think this is the last show, period.&quot; On September 11, 2007, the band announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg&#x27;s struggle with acute anxiety. A few days later, the duo canceled the remainder of their 2007 UK tour dates as well. In his review of &quot;Under Great White Northern Lights&quot; for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Bill Bradley commented on the tour cancellations, saying that it was &quot;impossible&quot; not to see Meg as &quot;road-weary and worn-out&quot; at the end of the film.

The band was on hiatus from late 2007 to early 2011. While on hiatus, Jack formed a group called the Dead Weather, although he insisted that the White Stripes remained his top priority. Dominique Payette, a Quebecois radio host, sued the band for $70,000 in 2008 for sampling 10 seconds of her radio show in the song &quot;Jumble Jumble&quot; without permission. The matter was ultimately settled out of court.

=== 2009–2011: Final years and breakup ===
The White Stripes performed live for the first time since September 2007 on the final episode of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on February 20, 2009, where they performed an alternate version of &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Be Friends&quot;. In an article dated May 6, 2009, with MusicRadar.com, Jack mentioned recording songs with Meg before the Conan gig had taken place, saying, &quot;We had recorded a couple of songs at the new studio.&quot; About a new White Stripes album, Jack said, &quot;It won&#x27;t be too far off. Maybe next year.&quot; Jack also explained Meg&#x27;s acute anxiety during the Stripes&#x27; last tour, saying, &quot;I just came from a Raconteurs tour and went right into that, so I was already full-speed. Meg had come from a dead-halt for a year and went right back into that madness. Meg is a very shy girl, a very quiet and shy person. To go full-speed from a dead-halt is overwhelming, and we had to take a break.&quot; The Conan gig proved to be their final live performance as a band.

In 2009 Jack reported that the White Stripes were working on their seventh album. A concert film, &quot;Under Great White Northern Lights&quot;, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 2009. The film documents the band&#x27;s summer 2007 tour across Canada and contains live concert and off-stage footage. Jack and Meg White appeared at the premiere and made a short speech before the movie started about their love of Canada and why they chose to debut their movie in Toronto. The tour was in support of the album &quot;Icky Thump&quot;, and they performed in every province. Jack conceived the idea of touring Canada after learning that Scottish relatives on his father&#x27;s side had lived for a few generations in Nova Scotia before relocating to Detroit to work in the car factories. Additionally, their 10th anniversary occurred during the tour on the day of their show at the Savoy Theatre in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and in this shot, Jack and Meg are dancing at the conclusion of the concert. The film was directed by a friend of the duo, Emmett Malloy.

In an interview with &quot;Self Titled&quot;, Jack alluded to the creation of a White Stripes film, &quot;Under Nova Scotian Lights&quot;, to be released later in 2009. In an interview with contactmusic.com, Jack claimed that working with the White Stripes would be &quot;strange&quot;. &quot;It would definitely be strange to go into the White Stripes again and have to rethink my game,&quot; adding: &quot;But that would be the best thing about it, because it would be a whole new White Stripes.&quot;

In February 2010, a Super Bowl ad by the U.S. Air Force Reserve caused the White Stripes to &quot;take strong insult and objection to the Air Force Reserve presenting this advertisement with the implication that we licensed one of our songs to encourage recruitment during a war that we do not support.&quot; In November 2010, the White Stripes contributed a previously released cover version of the song &quot;Rated X&quot; to the compilation album &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter: A Tribute To Loretta Lynn&quot;. In late 2010, the White Stripes reissued their first three albums on Third Man Records on a 180-gram vinyl along with 500 limited-edition, &quot;split-colored&quot; records to accompany it. Jack hinted at a possible White Stripes reunion in a 2010 interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. He said, &quot;We thought we&#x27;d do a lot of things that we&#x27;d never done: a full tour of Canada, a documentary, coffee-table book, live album, a boxed set... Now that we&#x27;ve gotten a lot of that out of our system, Meg and I can get back in the studio and start fresh.&quot;

On February 2, 2011, the duo announced that they had officially ceased recording and performing music as the White Stripes. The announcement specifically denied any artistic differences or health issues, but cited &quot;a myriad of reasons ... mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band&quot;.

=== Post-breakup ===
Following the band&#x27;s breakup, Jack continued his music career while Meg retired and returned to Detroit. In a 2014 interview, Jack told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Meg&#x27;s emotionally reserved nature had been a source of tension when the duo was together, as she had little to say about the band&#x27;s success. He spoke positively, however, of her musical acumen, saying &quot;She was the antithesis of a modern drummer. So childlike and incredible and inspiring. All the not-talking didn&#x27;t matter, because onstage? Nothing I do will top that.&quot;

Several unreleased recordings and memorabilia of the band have been released through Third Man, typically through the Third Man Records Vault, a &quot;rarity-excavating&quot; quarterly subscription service. This began with a 2009 package that included a mono mix of &quot;Icky Thump&quot;. The latest package is 2023&#x27;s &quot;Elephant XX&quot;, a mono mix of the aforementioned album which celebrates its 20th anniversary.

In 2016, the previously unheard &quot;City Lights&quot; was released as a promotional single after Michel Gondry surprised Jack with a music video. It was additionally featured on Jack&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Acoustic Recordings 1998–2016&quot; and received a nomination for Best American Roots Song at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

During the campaigning for the 2016 United States presidential election, then Republican candidate Donald Trump used &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; in a campaign video against the Stripes&#x27; wishes. Jack and Meg reunited to make a joint post on the White Stripes Facebook page, stating that they were &quot;disgusted by this association, and by the illegal use of their song&quot; and that they had &quot;nothing whatsoever to do with this video&quot;. They also released a limited edition T-shirt that read &quot;Icky Trump&quot; on the front, which was wordplay on Trump&#x27;s last name.

On October 6, 2020, a greatest hits album titled &quot;The White Stripes Greatest Hits&quot; was announced through Third Man not as a vault exclusive. It consists of twenty-six songs including &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; which was released as a promotional single. The band relaunched their Instagram account to promote the album. It was released in the United States by Third Man and Columbia Records on December 4, 2020, and was internationally released on February 26, 2021. Wartella-directed music videos for &quot;Let&#x27;s Shake Hands&quot; and &quot;Apple Blossom&quot; were released simultaneously. AllMusic&#x27;s Heather Phares wrote: &quot;&quot;The White Stripes Greatest Hits&quot; is filled with the same detail, wit, and willingness to subvert expectations that made the band so dynamic when they were active… the collection&#x27;s hand-curated feel is much more personal than the average best-of or streaming play list.&quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s Amanda Petrusich called the album &quot;a good reminder of how odd and inventive the band was… It feels old-fashioned, even deliberately so, but it sounds awfully good.&quot;

In May 2023, Third Man Books announced &quot;The White Stripes Complete Lyrics 1997-2007&quot;, a book featuring lyrics written during the band&#x27;s activity in addition to rough drafts and unseen content. When compiling the lyrics, Jack said that &quot;I couldn’t get through any of those songs; I would cry halfway through each of those songs… some of them are the first songs I really had ever written, or among the earliest… humbly, I don&#x27;t really know why anyone would get anything out of them… but people reflect back at you and keep mentioning that and you go &#x27;OK, I guess people are getting something out of that.&#x27;&quot; It was released in October of that same year.

The Trump campaign again used &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; during the 2024 United States presidential election, which resulted in Jack and Meg reuniting to file a copyright infringement lawsuit in September 2024. Their complaint accuses Trump of &quot;flagrant misappropriation&quot; and clarifies that they &quot;vehemently oppose the policies adopted and actions taken by Defendant Trump when he was President and those he has proposed for the second term he seeks&quot;. The lawsuit was dropped in November 2024.

==Artistry==

===Influences===
The White Stripes were influenced by blues musicians including Son House, Blind Willie McTell and Robert Johnson, garage rock bands such as the Gories and the Sonics, the Detroit protopunk sound of bands like the MC5 and the Stooges, in addition to groups like the Cramps, the Velvet Underground, and the early Los Angeles punk blues band the Gun Club. Jack has stated on numerous occasions that the blues is the dominant influence on his songwriting and the roots of the band&#x27;s music, stating that he feels it is so sacred that playing it does not do it justice. Of the Gun Club&#x27;s music in particular, Jack said, &quot;&#x27;Sex Beat&#x27;, &#x27;She&#x27;s Like Heroin to Me&#x27;, and &#x27;For the Love of Ivy&#x27;...why are these songs not taught in schools?&quot; Heavy blues rock bands such as AC/DC and Led Zeppelin have also influenced the band, as Jack has claimed that he &quot;can&#x27;t trust anybody who doesn&#x27;t like Led Zeppelin.&quot;

Traditional country music such as Hank Williams and Loretta Lynn, rockabilly acts like the Flat Duo Jets, Wanda Jackson and Gene Vincent, the surf rock of Dick Dale, and folk music like Lead Belly and Bob Dylan have also influenced the band&#x27;s sound. Meg has said one of her all-time favorite musicians is Bob Dylan; Jack has performed live with him, and has claimed &quot;I&#x27;ve got three fathers—my biological dad, God and Bob Dylan&quot;.

===Equipment===

With few exceptions, Jack displayed a continued partiality towards amps and pedals from the 1960s. Jack used a number of effects to create his sound, such as a DigiTech Whammy IV to reach pitches that would be otherwise impossible with a regular guitar. When performing live, Jack used a Randy Parsons custom guitar, a 1964 JB Hutto Montgomery Airline, a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s Crestwood Astral II, and a 1950s Kay Hollowbody. Also, while playing live, he used an MXR Micro Amp, Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi distortion/sustainer, and an Electro-Harmonix POG (a polyphonic octave generator). He also used a Boss TU-2 tuner pedal. He plugged this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb, and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 1485 amplifiers paired with two 6x10 Silvertone cabinets. In addition to standard guitar tuning, Jack also used several open tunings. He also played other instruments such as a black F-Style Gibson mandolin, Rhodes bass keys, and a Steinway piano. He played a custom-made red and white marimba on &quot;The Nurse&quot;, &quot;Forever for Her (Is Over for Me)&quot; as well as on the non-album tracks &quot;Who&#x27;s A Big Baby&quot; and &quot;Top Special&quot;.

Meg extensively used the Ludwig Classic Maple kit with Paiste cymbals, and also used Remo and Ludwig drumheads, various percussion instruments and Vater drumsticks. From the band&#x27;s inception to &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot;, the resonant heads of the toms and bass drum featured peppermint swirls. While recording &quot;From the Basement: The White Stripes&quot;, the design on the bass drum was switched to an image of her hand holding the apple from the &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot; cover. Beginning in 2006, White used a pair of Paiste 14&quot; Signature Medium Hi-Hats, a 19&quot; Signature Power Crash, and a 22&quot; 2002 Ride. On the &quot;Icky Thump&quot; tour, the bass drum head design was switched to a button inspired by the Pearlies clothing Jack and Meg wore for the album cover.

=== Style and technique ===
The White Stripes have been described as garage rock, blues rock, alternative rock, punk blues, and indie rock. They emerged from Detroit&#x27;s active garage rock revival scene of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their contemporaries included bands such as the Von Bondies, the Dirtbombs, the Detroit Cobras, and other bands that Jack included on a compilation album called &quot;Sympathetic Sounds of Detroit&quot;, which was recorded in his living room.

The White Stripes were notable for having only two musicians, limiting the instruments they could play live. Jack, the principal writer, said that this was not a problem, and that he &quot;always centered the band around the number three. Everything was vocals, guitar and drums or vocals, piano and drums.&quot; Fans and critics drew comparisons between Jack&#x27;s prowess on the guitar and Meg&#x27;s simplistic, reserved drumming. The band additionally drew attention for their preference for antiquated recording equipment. In a 2001 &quot;New York Times&quot; concert review, Ann Powers noted that Jack&#x27;s &quot;ingenious&quot; playing was &quot;constrained by [Meg&#x27;s] deliberately undeveloped approach&quot;, and that &quot;he created more challenges by playing an acoustic guitar with paper taped over the hole and a less-than-high-quality solid body electric.&quot;

Meg&#x27;s minimalistic drumming style was a prominent part of the band&#x27;s sound. Meg never had formal drum lessons. She played Ludwig Drums with Paiste cymbals, and says her pre-show warm-up consisted of &quot;whiskey and Red Bull&quot;. Jack downplayed criticisms of her style, insisting: &quot;I never thought &#x27;God, I wish Neil Peart was in this band.&#x27; It&#x27;s kind of funny: When people critique hip hop, they&#x27;re scared to open up, for fear of being called racist. But they&#x27;re not scared to open up on female musicians, out of pure sexism. Meg is the best part of this band. It never would have worked with anybody else, because it would have been too complicated... It was my doorway to playing the blues.&quot; Of her playing style, Meg herself said: &quot;I appreciate other kinds of drummers who play differently, but it&#x27;s not my style or what works for this band. I get [criticism] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me. But then I think about it, and I realize that this is what is really needed for this band. And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible ... I just know the way [Jack] plays so well at this point that I always know kind of what he&#x27;s going to do. I can always sense where he&#x27;s going with things just by the mood he&#x27;s in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, but I can usually keep him where I want him.&quot;

Although Jack was the lead vocalist, Meg did sing lead vocals for &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot; (from &quot;Elephant&quot;) and &quot;Passive Manipulation&quot; (from &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot;) among other tracks. She also accompanied Jack on the songs &quot;Your Southern Can Is Mine&quot; from &quot;De Stijl&quot;, &quot;Hotel Yorba&quot; and &quot;This Protector&quot; from &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;, &quot;Rated X&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What Love Is (You Just Do as You&#x27;re Told)&quot; and &quot;Rag &amp; Bone&quot; from &quot;Icky Thump&quot;, and accompanied Jack and Holly Golightly on the song &quot;It&#x27;s True That We Love One Another&quot; from &quot;Elephant&quot;.

Several White Stripes recordings were completed rapidly. &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; was recorded in less than four days, and &quot;Elephant&quot; and &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot; were both recorded in about two weeks. For live shows, the White Stripes were known for Jack&#x27;s employment of heavy distortion, as well as audio feedback and overdrive. The duo performed considerably more recklessly and unstructured live, never preparing set lists for their shows, believing that planning too closely would ruin the spontaneity of their performances. Other affectations included Jack using two microphones onstage.

== Public image ==

=== Aesthetic and presentation ===

The White Stripes had a carefully constructed image built around lore they created for themselves and visual motifs. Early in their history, they turned down a potential deal with Chicago label Bobsled, because the label wanted to put its green logo on the CD. Their presentation was a subject of intrigue among the public and in the media. They made exclusive use of a red, white and black color scheme when conducting virtually all professional duties, from album art to the clothes worn during live performances. Jack told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2005 that &quot;The White Stripes&#x27; colors were always red, white, and black. It came from peppermint candy. I also think they are the most powerful color combination of all time, from a Coca-Cola can to a Nazi banner. Those colors strike chords with people. In Japan, they are honorable colors. When you see a bride in a white gown, you immediately see innocence in that. Red is anger and passion. It is also sexual. And black is the absence of all that.&quot; He also explained that they aspired to invoke an innocent childishness without any intention of irony or humor. Meg said that &quot;like a uniform at school, you can just focus on what you&#x27;re doing because everybody&#x27;s wearing the same thing.&quot; They also cited the minimalist and deconstructionist aspects of De Stijl design as a source of inspiration.

The media and fans alike varied between intrigue and skepticism at the band&#x27;s appearance and presentation. Andy Gershon, president of the V2 label at the time of their signing, was reluctant to sign them, saying, &quot;They need a bass player, they&#x27;ve got this red-and-white gimmick, and the songs are fantastic, but they&#x27;ve recorded very raw...how is this going to be on radio?&quot; In a 2002 &quot;Spin&quot; magazine article, Chuck Klosterman wondered, &quot;how can two media-savvy kids posing as brother and sister, wearing Dr. Seuss clothes, represent blood-and-bones Detroit, a city whose greatest resource is asphalt?&quot; However, in 2001, Benjamin Nugent with &quot;Time&quot; magazine commented that &quot;it&#x27;s hard to begrudge [Jack] his right to nudge the spotlight toward his band, and away from his private life, by any means available. Even at the expense of the truth.&quot; Klosterman also commented that &quot;his songs—about getting married in cathedrals, walking to kindergarten, and guileless companionship—are performed with an almost naive certitude.&quot;

Early in their career, the band provided various descriptions of their relationship. Jack claimed that he and Meg were siblings, the youngest two of ten. As the story went, they became a band when, on Bastille Day 1997, Meg went to the attic of their parents&#x27; home and began to play on Jack&#x27;s drum kit. This claim was widely believed and repeated despite rumors that they were, or had been, husband and wife. In 2001, proof of their 1996 marriage emerged, as well as evidence that the couple had divorced in March 2000, just before the band gained widespread attention. Even so, they continued to insist publicly that they were brother and sister. In a 2005 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Jack claimed that this open secret was intended to keep the focus on the music rather than the couple&#x27;s relationship: &quot;When you see a band that is two pieces, husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, you think, &#x27;Oh, I see...&#x27; When they&#x27;re brother and sister, you go, &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s interesting.&#x27; You care more about the music, not the relationship—whether they&#x27;re trying to save their relationship by being in a band.&quot;

=== Other appearances ===
The White Stripes selectively made media appearances. Jack and Meg appeared in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s film &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes&quot; in 2003, in a segment entitled &quot;Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil&quot;. This particular segment contains extensions of White Stripes motifs such as childhood innocence and Nikola Tesla. They appeared in the 2005 documentary &quot;The Fearless Freaks&quot;, which covers the band the Flaming Lips. The band appeared as themselves in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Jazzy and the Pussycats&quot; in 2006. Meg had previously expressed interest in a &quot;Simpsons&quot; role in 2003, saying that &quot;A guest appearance would be amazing. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be in a Lisa episode. They&#x27;re kind of boring. Maybe a Homer one would be better.&quot; Jack is one of three guitarists featured in the 2009 documentary &quot;It Might Get Loud&quot;, and Meg appears in segments that include the White Stripes.

== Legacy ==

The critical and commercial success of the White Stripes has established Jack and Meg White as key figures of both the garage rock and indie rock revival of the 2000s. Following the release of &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; dubbed them &quot;the greatest band since The Sex Pistols&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine declared &quot;Rock is Back!&quot; on its September 2002 cover.&quot;&quot; Subsequently christened by the media as the &quot;The&quot; bands, the White Stripes, along with the Strokes and the Hives, are credited by &quot;NME&quot; for bringing about both a &quot;new garage rock revolution&quot; and a &quot;new rock revolution&quot;. They were deemed &quot;the saviours of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; by Chris Smith. &quot;Q&quot; magazine listed the White Stripes as one of &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; hailed the White Stripes and the Hives for expanding the legacy of garage rock. &quot;Medium&quot; called them &quot;probably the greatest garage rock duo of the 2000s&quot;. Profiling the band in 2025, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame wrote: &quot;The White Stripes reimagined minimalist garage and punk rock for a new generation and brought blues into the twenty-first century. […] They proved that a band could create massive, genre-defining sound with only two people, inspiring a wave of rock &amp; roll revivalists and making a lasting mark on popular music.&quot;

Established figures in the music industry have cited the White Stripes as an influence. Olivia Rodrigo is a fan of the band, calling &quot;Elephant&quot; the record she listened to most, Jack her &quot;hero of all heroes&quot;, and Meg &quot;one of the best drummers of our time.&quot; Brad Pitt named &quot;My Doorbell&quot; as one of his all-time favorite songs. Beyoncé cited the White Stripes and Jack as influences on her 2024 album &quot;Cowboy Carter&quot;. Nandi Bushell said the band &quot;moved me at 5 years old to want to play the drums and still move me today!&quot; Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters and Nirvana called Meg &quot;one of my favorite fucking drummers of all time. Like, nobody fucking plays the drums like that.&quot; Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine said that Meg &quot;has style and swag and personality and oomph and taste and awesomeness that&#x27;s off the charts and a vibe that&#x27;s untouchable&quot;. The White Stripes&#x27; songs have also been covered and sampled by several artists. Those who have sampled their works include Jermaine Dupri, Pitbull, Rizzle Kicks, Jurassic 5, and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. Those who have covered their works include Grohl, Arctic Monkeys, Ryan Adams, Kelly Clarkson (accompanied by a marching band), Bob Dylan, Wanda Jackson, of Montreal, Tracey Thorn, the Flaming Lips, the Golden Filter, Bright Eyes, First Aid Kit, Bigga Haitian, and Wanda Jackson.

Music by the White Stripes was used by British choreographer Wayne McGregor for his production &quot;Chroma&quot;, a piece he created for the Royal Ballet in London, England. The orchestral arrangements for &quot;Chroma&quot; were commissioned by Richard Russell, head of XL Recordings, as a gift to the White Stripes and were produced by the British classical composer Joby Talbot. Three of these songs, &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot;, &quot;Aluminium&quot; and &quot;Blue Orchid&quot;, were first played to the band as a surprise in Cincinnati Music Hall, Ohio. McGregor heard the orchestral versions and decided to create a ballet using the music. Talbot re-orchestrated the music for the Royal Opera House orchestra, also writing three additional pieces of his own composition. The world premiere of the ballet took place on November 16, 2006, at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London. The ballet subsequently won the 2007 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production.

Several of the White Stripes&#x27; works have appeared in film, television, and advertising. The song &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Be Friends&quot; appeared in the films &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; in 2004, &quot;Wonder&quot; in 2017, and &quot;Mr. Harrigan&#x27;s Phone&quot; in 2022. The song &quot;Instinct Blues&quot; was used in the 2006 film &quot;The Science of Sleep&quot;. The song &quot;Why Can&#x27;t You Be Nicer to Me?&quot; was used in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Judge Me Tender&quot; in 2010. The Academy Award-winning 2010 movie, &quot;The Social Network&quot; featured &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; in the opening scene. The song &quot;Icky Thump&quot; was featured in the 2010 film &quot;The Other Guys&quot;, and in Zack Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Justice League&quot; in 2021. The song &quot;Catch Hell Blues&quot; is featured in the 2011 film &quot;Footloose&quot;, a remake of the 1984 film. The song &quot;Little Ghost&quot; appears in the post credits scene for the 2012 Laika studios film, &quot;ParaNorman&quot;. The songs &quot;Hello Operator&quot; and &quot;Fell in Love with a Girl&quot; were featured in the Academy Award-winning 2012 film &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot;. In 2013, several songs by the White Stripes were featured in the first season of the television series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;. The song &quot;Apple Blossom&quot; was featured in the 2015 Quentin Tarantino film &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;. The song &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot; was featured in a 2023 advertising campaign for Calvin Klein.

<text>Superchunk is an American indie rock band from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, consisting of singer-guitarist Mac McCaughan, guitarist Jim Wilbur, bassist Laura Ballance, and drummer Laura King. Formed in 1989, they were one of the bands that helped define the Chapel Hill music scene of the 1990s. Their energetic, high-velocity style and do-it-yourself ethic is influenced by punk rock.

Members McCaughan and Ballance founded the successful independent record label Merge Records in 1989 as a way to release music from Superchunk and music created by friends, which has expanded to include artists from around the world and records reaching the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; music charts. Superchunk released a string of full-length albums and compilations throughout the 1990s. After releasing their eighth studio album in 2001, the band went into a period of reduced activity. In 2010, the band released a new studio album, &quot;Majesty Shredding&quot;, and followed it up in 2013 with their tenth studio album, &quot;I Hate Music&quot;. Their eleventh studio album, &quot;What a Time to Be Alive&quot;, was released on February 16, 2018. Their twelfth album, &quot;Wild Loneliness&quot;, was released in February 2022.

==History==
Superchunk was formed in 1989 in the town of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, by Mac McCaughan (guitar and vocals), Laura Ballance (bass and backing vocals), Chuck Garrison (drums), and Jack McCook (guitar). Initially, the band went by the name Chunk (original drummer Chuck Garrison&#x27;s name was misspelled as &quot;Chunk&quot; Garrison in the phone book, and the moniker stuck), and they released their first single as Chunk. After adding the &quot;Super&quot; prefix to their name to avoid confusion with a similarly named jazz band from New York, the first official Superchunk single, &quot;Slack Motherfucker&quot;, followed in 1989 on Merge Records, founded by McCaughan and Ballance. Both releases were well received, and Superchunk released its debut eponymous album in 1990 on Matador Records to more critical acclaim.

McCook decided to leave the group after the release of the first album, &quot;Superchunk&quot;, and Connecticut-born James Wilbur was recruited to take over guitar duties. In spite of the ensuing bidding war that emerged between major record labels in the aftermath of the album&#x27;s release, Superchunk decided to stay independent, sticking with Matador Records for their second, just as critically lauded LP, &quot;No Pocky for Kitty&quot;, which was recorded in Chicago by Steve Albini in 1991. Garrison left the band a few weeks before the record&#x27;s release, and Jon Wurster was brought on board on drums.

The band put out one more record for Matador, &quot;On the Mouth&quot; in 1993. After Matador entered into a distribution agreement with major label Atlantic Records, Superchunk decided to leave the label, even though the Atlantic logo did not have to be displayed on their releases. Instead, the band opted to release their following records through Merge. The next album, &quot;Foolish&quot;, brought further critical acclaim for the band in 1994. A second singles compilation (the first was 1992&#x27;s &quot;Tossing Seeds&quot;) came out in the summer of 1995. It was titled &quot;Incidental Music 1991–95&quot; and contained most of their hard-to-find tracks (imports, B-sides, comp. tracks) released between 1991 and 1995.

Boston was the setting for Superchunk&#x27;s next album session. 1995&#x27;s &quot;Here&#x27;s Where the Strings Come In&quot; was recorded at the city&#x27;s Fort Apache Studios and slated for a fall release. The band toured hard for &quot;Strings&quot; all over the world as well as appearing on the Lollapalooza tour, scoring a minor hit with the &quot;Hyper Enough&quot; single and video.

After a brief hiatus and another Australian tour, the band released a limited-edition EP called &quot;The Laughter Guns&quot;. They then started writing for what would become &quot;Indoor Living&quot;. Recording started in Bloomington, Indiana&#x27;s Echo Park Studios with Chapel Hillian John Plymale co-producing with the band. Superchunk stretched out a bit on &quot;Indoor Living&quot;, expanding their sound by adding some new instruments to the mix: piano, organ, vibes and more. The album was by far their most adventurous and at the same time their most accessible to date.

Superchunk delivered &quot;Come Pick Me Up&quot;, their seventh full-length studio release, in 1999, recording in Chicago at Electrical Audio with producer Jim O&#x27;Rourke. Superchunk continued the expansion and growth of their sound that started with &quot;Foolish&quot;, pushing themselves to new heights of creativity.

In 2001, the band released &quot;Here&#x27;s to Shutting Up&quot;. In 2002, Superchunk began a series of limited-edition live albums known as &quot;The Clambakes&quot; series. &quot;Clambakes Volume 1&quot; (limited to 1500 copies) is an acoustic live set recorded in various record stores across the US in support of &quot;Here&#x27;s to Shutting Up&quot; and &quot;Clambakes Volume 2&quot; (limited to 2500 copies) is a film score Superchunk was commissioned to write. It was recorded live at the Castro Theater in San Francisco on April 23, 2002, during the San Francisco International Film Festival at a showing of the 1926 Teinosuke Kinugasa film &quot;A Page of Madness&quot;.

&quot;Cup of Sand&quot;, released in 2003, is the third singles album compiling all singles and rare 1995–2002 tracks.

&quot;Clambakes Series Volume 3&quot; was released in 2004, documenting the live set Superchunk played at the Cat&#x27;s Cradle in Carrboro, North Carolina, on July 23, 1999, for the Merge Records tenth anniversary celebration.

In 2006, Superchunk headlined a concert held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, a Comedy Central program, at Irving Plaza in New York. The show also featured a performance from Clem Snide as well as short stand-up comedy sets from various &quot;Daily Show&quot; correspondents.

In 2007, Superchunk contributed a hidden track to the Aqua Teen Hunger Force soundtrack, &quot;Misfits and Mistakes&quot;, with singing from Aqua Teen Hunger Force character Meatwad. On June 5, 2007, Superchunk released the &quot;Misfits and Mistakes&quot; 7-inch, which has the Superchunk solo version on the A-side, and the Meatwad version on the B-side.

The band played two shows, the Eff Cancer Benefit in Chicago on June 20, 2007, and headlined the inaugural free Pool Parties show at McCarren Park Pool in Brooklyn, New York. They are also known to still play occasional one-off shows at home in North Carolina, usually at Cat&#x27;s Cradle in Carrboro.

Superchunk also recorded a cover version of &quot;Say My Name&quot; by Destiny&#x27;s Child for Engine Room Recordings&#x27; compilation album &quot;Guilt by Association&quot;, which was set to be released in September 2007.

Superchunk appeared at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, on April 18, 2009, along with other acts like Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Killers, M.I.A., TV on the Radio, Band of Horses.

On April 7, 2009, Superchunk released the &quot;Leaves in the Gutter&quot; EP, their first CD release in seven years. It consisted of three unreleased tracks, in addition to &quot;Misfits and Mistakes&quot; and an acoustic version of the new song &quot;Learned to Surf&quot;.

On May 28, 2009, the band announced a new 7-inch, &quot;Crossed Wires&quot; b/w &quot;Blinders (Fast Vers.)&quot;, which released on July 7, 2009. It was initially limited to a pressing of 1000 on clear vinyl.

On July 27, 2010, the band covered The Cure&#x27;s &quot;In Between Days&quot; for AV Club Undercover.

The band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Majesty Shredding&quot;, was released on September 14, 2010. The band was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival he curated in December 2011 in Minehead, Somerset.

The band&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;I Hate Music&quot;, was released on August 20, 2013. Before the release, Ballance announced on the band&#x27;s website that she would not be taking part in the upcoming tour to promote the album, citing a worsening hearing condition known as hyperacusis. Her live replacement is Jason Narducy, formerly of Verbow and currently bass player with Bob Mould&#x27;s band. The band performed in North America, Australia and the UK as part of the tour.

In November 2013, the band played the final holiday camp edition of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Camber Sands, England.

On February 27, 2016, Superchunk re-united with original drummer Chuck Garrison for a performance of &quot;Slack Motherfucker&quot; at the end of a Scharpling &amp; Wurster live show in Durham, North Carolina. Jon Wurster performed some of the vocals in character as Philly Boy Roy.

In November 2017, the band announced that their 11th studio album &quot;What a Time to Be Alive&quot; will be released in February 2018.

On May 31, 2019, as part of Merge Records&#x27; &quot;special 30th anniversary releases&quot;, Superchunk released an acoustic version of their 1994 album &quot;Foolish&quot;, titled &quot;Acoustic Foolish&quot;.

On February 10, 2023, Jon Wurster announced his exit from the band. The band released the compilation album &quot;Misfits &amp; Mistakes: Singles, B-Sides &amp; Strays 2007–2023&quot; in October 2023.

== Musical style, influences, and legacy ==
Superchunk&#x27;s music has been described as punk rock and indie rock. Superchunk&#x27;s early influences included Buzzcocks, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., and Hüsker Dü. The band would eventually incorporate elements from such bands as Rocket from the Crypt, Drive Like Jehu, and Polvo.

Superchunk has had a significant impact on alternative music, being cited as an influence by Motion City Soundtrack, the Get Up Kids, Jawbreaker, the Jazz June, Lemuria, and the Van Pelt.

<doc id="168622" wikidata="Q4430254" url="?curid=168622" title="Social reality">
<text>Social reality is distinct from biological reality or individual cognitive reality, representing as it does a phenomenological level created through social interaction and thereby transcending individual motives and actions. As a product of human dialogue, social reality may be considered as consisting of the accepted social s of a community, involving thereby relatively stable laws and social representations. Radical constructivism would cautiously describe social reality as the product of uniformities among observers (whether or not including the current observer themselves).

==Schütz, Durkheim, and Spencer==

The problem of social reality has been treated exhaustively by philosophers in the phenomenological tradition, particularly Alfred Schütz, who used the term &quot;social world&quot; to designate this distinct level of reality. Within the social world, Schütz distinguished between social reality that could be experienced directly (&quot;umwelt&quot;) and a social reality beyond the immediate horizon, which could yet be experienced if sought out. In his wake, ethnomethodology explored further the unarticulated structure of our everyday competence and ability with social reality.

Previously, the subject had been addressed in sociology as well as other disciplines. For example, Émile Durkheim stressed the distinct nature of &quot;the social kingdom. Here more than anywhere else the idea is the reality&quot;. Herbert Spencer had coined the term &quot;super-organic&quot; to distinguish the social level of reality above the biological and psychological.

==Searle==

John Searle has used the theory of speech acts to explore the nature of social/institutional reality, so as to describe such aspects of social reality which he instances under the rubrics of &quot;marriage, property, hiring, firing, war, revolutions, cocktail parties, governments, meetings, unions, parliaments, corporations, laws, restaurants, vacations, lawyers, professors, doctors, medieval knights, and taxes, for example&quot;.

Searle argued that such institutional realities interact with each other in what he called &quot;systematic relationships (e.g., governments, marriages, corporations, universities, armies, churches)&quot; to create a multi-layered social reality.

For Searle, language was the key to the formation of social reality because &quot;language is precisely designed to be a self-identifying category of institutional facts&quot;; i.e., a system of publicly and widely accepted symbols which &quot;persist through time independently of the urges and inclinations of the participants.&quot;

==Objective/subjective==

There is a debate in social theory about whether social reality exists independently of people&#x27;s involvement with it, or whether (as in social constructionism) it is only created by the human process of ongoing interaction. 

Peter L. Berger argued for a new concern with the basic process of the social construction of reality. Berger stated that the social construction of reality was a process made up of three steps: externalization, objectivation and internalization. In similar fashion, post-Sartrians like R. D. Laing stress that, &quot;once certain fundamental structures of experience are shared, they come to be experienced as objective entities...they take on the force and character of partial autonomous realities, with their own way of life&quot;. Yet at the same time, Laing insisted that such a socially real grouping &quot;can be nothing else than the multiplicity of the points of view and actions of its members...even where, through the interiorization of this multiplicity as synthesized by each, this synthesized multiplicity becomes ubiquitous in space and enduring in time&quot;.

The existence of a social reality independent of individuals or the ecology would seem at odds with the views of perceptual psychology, including those of J. J. Gibson, and those of most ecological economics theories.

Scholars such as John Searle argue on the one hand that &quot;a socially constructed reality presupposes a reality independent of all social constructions&quot;. At the same time, he accepts that social realities are humanly created, and that &quot;the secret to understanding the continued existence of institutional facts is simply that the individuals directly involved and a sufficient number of members of the relevant communities must continue to recognize and accept the existence of such facts&quot;.

==Socialisation and the Capital Other==

Freud saw a child&#x27;s induction into social reality as consolidated with the passing of the Oedipus complex and the internalisation of the parents: &quot;the same figures who continue to operate in the super-ego as the agency we know as conscience...also belong to the real external world. It is from there that they were drawn; their power, behind which lie hidden all the influences of the past and of tradition, was one of the most strongly-felt manifestations of reality&quot;.

Lacan clarified the point by stressing that this was &quot;a highly significant moment in the transfer of powers from the subject to the Other, what I call the Capital Other...the field of the Other – which, strictly speaking, is the Oedipus complex&quot;. Lacan considered that &quot;the Oedipus complex...superimposes the kingdom of culture on that of nature&quot;, bringing the child into the Symbolic Order.

Within that order, Lacanians consider that &quot;institutions, as &quot;signifying practices&quot;, are much more extensive structures than romantic notions allow and they thus implicate us in ways which narrower definitions cannot recognize...exceed any intersubjective intention or effect&quot;. In similar fashion, Searle asserts that &quot;institutional power – massive, pervasive, and typically invisible – permeates every nook and cranny of our social lives...the invisible structure of social reality&quot;.

==Measuring trust==

If one accepts the validity of the idea of social reality, scientifically, it must be amenable to measurement, something which has been explored particularly in relation to trust. &quot;Trust is...part of a community&#x27;s social capital, as Francis Fukuyama argues, and has deep historical and cultural roots&quot;.

Theories of the measurement of trust in the sociological community are usually called theories of social capital, to emphasize the connection to economics, and the ability to measure outputs in the same feeling.

<doc id="168623" wikidata="Q1891322" url="?curid=168623" title="Sleater-Kinney">
<text>Sleater-Kinney ( ) is an American rock band that formed in Olympia, Washington, in 1994. The band&#x27;s lineup features Corin Tucker (vocals and guitar) and Carrie Brownstein (guitar and vocals), following the departure of longtime member Janet Weiss (drums, harmonica, and vocals) in 2019. Sleater-Kinney originated as part of the riot grrrl movement and has become a key part of the American indie rock scene. The band is also known for its feminist and progressive politics.

The band released seven studio albums between 1994 and 2005: &quot;Sleater-Kinney&quot; (1995), &quot;Call the Doctor&quot; (1996), &quot;Dig Me Out&quot; (1997), &quot;The Hot Rock&quot; (1999), &quot;All Hands on the Bad One&quot; (2000), &quot;One Beat&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Woods&quot; (2005). They disbanded in 2006 and devoted themselves to solo projects. They reunited in 2014 and have since released a further four albums: &quot;No Cities to Love&quot; (2015), &quot;The Center Won&#x27;t Hold&quot; (2019), &quot;Path of Wellness&quot; (2021), and &quot;Little Rope&quot; (2024).

Critics Greil Marcus and Robert Christgau have each praised Sleater-Kinney as one of the essential rock groups of the early 2000s. Marcus named Sleater-Kinney America&#x27;s best rock band in 2001, and Tom Breihan of &quot;Stereogum&quot; called them the greatest rock band of the past two decades in 2015.

==History==
===Formation, early years (1994–1999)===
Sleater-Kinney was formed in early 1994 in Olympia, Washington, by Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein. The group&#x27;s name derives from Sleater Kinney Road, in Lacey, Washington, where signs for the Interstate 5 highway exit number 108 announce its existence. The road itself is named for two families that lived in the nearby South Bay neighborhood of Olympia in the 19th century, the Sleaters and Henry and Martha Kinney. One of the band&#x27;s early practice spaces was near Sleater Kinney Road. Tucker was formerly in the influential riot grrrl band Heavens to Betsy, while Brownstein was formerly in the band Excuse 17. They often played at gigs together and formed Sleater-Kinney as a side project from their respective bands. When Heavens to Betsy and Excuse 17 disbanded, Sleater-Kinney became their primary focus. Janet Weiss of Quasi was the band&#x27;s longest-lasting drummer, though Sleater-Kinney has had other drummers, including Lora MacFarlane, Misty Farrell, and Toni Gogin.

Upon Tucker&#x27;s graduation from The Evergreen State College (where Brownstein remained a student for three more years), she and her then-girlfriend Brownstein took a trip to Australia in early 1994. On their last day there, they stayed up all night recording what would become their self-titled debut album. It was released the following spring. They followed this with &quot;Call the Doctor&quot; (1996) and &quot;Dig Me Out&quot; (1997), and became critical darlings as a result. Produced by John Goodmanson and recorded at John and Stu&#x27;s Place in Seattle, the record was influenced by both classic rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and the band&#x27;s usual punk predecessors. From &quot;Dig Me Out&quot; onwards, the band&#x27;s drummer was Janet Weiss.

===Later albums (2000–2006)===

Their next few albums (&quot;The Hot Rock&quot;, &quot;All Hands on the Bad One&quot;) pushed the band towards mainstream listeners, culminating in 2002&#x27;s &quot;One Beat&quot;. The group opened for Pearl Jam at many North American shows beginning in 2003, and the band cited the experience of playing in large arenas as part of the inspiration and motivation for the music found on their seventh album, &quot;The Woods&quot;. &quot;The Woods&quot; was released in 2005 and was a departure from the sound of their previous albums. In its place, &quot;The Woods&quot; featured a denser, heavily distorted sound that drew on classic rock as its inspiration. In 2006, they helped to curate an edition of the British All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival. They also contributed to the Burn to Shine project, appearing in Volume 3 (Portland), playing &quot;Modern Girl&quot;.

Two days before Sleater-Kinney were to go to Europe for a touring leg there in 2006, Brownstein caught shingles, caused by her anxiety. As Weiss had never caught chicken pox as a child, Brownstein was isolated from the rest of the band, causing her mental health to decline further. Consequently, prior to Sleater-Kinney&#x27;s performance at Le Botanique in Brussels on May 27, 2006, Brownstein experienced a mental breakdown in front of Tucker and Weiss that prompted her to break up the band. Also contributing to Sleater-Kinney&#x27;s disbandment was Tucker&#x27;s exhaustion with touring and her desire to be with her family and look after her child.

On June 27, 2006, the band announced an indefinite hiatus, stating there were &quot;no plans for future tours or recordings.&quot; Sleater-Kinney&#x27;s last major public show was at the 2006 Lollapalooza music festival. The band&#x27;s final appearance before the hiatus was at the Crystal Ballroom in Portland, Oregon on August 12, 2006. At the time, the band did not offer an explanation for the hiatus, although Brownstein later disclosed the reasons for the breakup in her 2015 memoir &quot;Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl&quot;.

=== Hiatus (2007–2013) ===
Upon the dissolution of Sleater-Kinney in 2006, Weiss joined Quasi bandmate Joanna Bolme in Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks. She performed on two albums, &quot;Real Emotional Trash&quot; in 2008 and the 2011 release &quot;Mirror Traffic&quot;. She left the band before the tour for the latter. In April 2010, Tucker announced she was recording a solo album for the Kill Rock Stars record label to be released in October 2010. Working with Tucker on the Corin Tucker Band&#x27;s album was Unwound&#x27;s Sara Lund and Golden Bears&#x27;/Circus Lupus Seth Lorinczi. According to Tucker, the album would be a &quot;middle-aged mom record&quot;. The album, entitled &quot;1,000 Years&quot; was released on October 5, 2010, to positive reception by music critics. Tucker toured the United States to support the &quot;1,000 Years&quot; album. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Kill My Blues&quot;, was released on September 18, 2012. A United States tour supported this album.

In September 2010, Brownstein revealed her latest project was the band Wild Flag, with Janet Weiss, Mary Timony, formerly of Helium, and Rebecca Cole, formerly of the Minders. Their self-titled eponymous debut album was released on September 13, 2011, on Merge Records. By 2014, the band was no longer active. In an interview, Brownstein stated, &quot;We had a fun run… but all the logistics started seeming not quite worth it.&quot; Brownstein&#x27;s television project &quot;Portlandia&quot; premiered on IFC in January 2011 and aired a new season every year until its series finale in March 2018.

=== Reunion, new albums, and Weiss&#x27;s departure (2014–present) ===
In October 2014, the band announced it had recorded a new album, &quot;No Cities to Love&quot;, later released on January 20, 2015. The members of Sleater-Kinney also announced a 2015 tour covering North America and western Europe. In 2014, the band released the vinyl box set of their previous releases as &quot;Start Together.&quot; It was reviewed by &quot;Bust&quot; magazine, where writer Claire McKinzie stated, &quot;With their feminist, left-leaning lyrics, Sleater-Kinney&#x27;s relevance today is obvious. While some singers back away from being labeled &quot;feminist,&quot; Sleater-Kinney exists partially to redirect society&#x27;s perception of the word.&quot;

In January 2017, the band released their first live album, &quot;Live in Paris&quot;, recorded at La Cigale on March 20, 2015. By January 2018, the band was said to be working on their follow-up to &quot;No Cities to Love&quot;, though Brownstein said that they were &quot;going to do this very slowly.&quot; In January 2019, the band announced that a new album, produced by the artist St. Vincent (Annie Clark), was expected that year.

In May 2019, Sleater-Kinney released a new song, &quot;Hurry on Home&quot; along with a lyric video. This served as the lead single for &quot;The Center Won&#x27;t Hold&quot;, released in August 2019. 
During the making of the album, Tucker and Brownstein made it clear to Weiss that she would no longer be a creative equal in the band and would just serve as the band&#x27;s drummer. Upon completion of recording, Weiss felt reluctant to perform the album&#x27;s songs live due to her lack of involvement in the creative process and opted to leave the band prior to the album&#x27;s release.

On July 1, 2019, Weiss announced on her Twitter account that she would be leaving the band, saying it was &quot;time for me to move on&quot;. The band performed their first concert without Weiss at the Hopscotch Music Festival on September 5, with new drummer Angie Boylan.

In May 2021, the band announced a new album, &quot;Path of Wellness&quot;, released on June 11. The first single, &quot;Worry With You&quot; was released on May 11, 2021.

On January 19, 2024, their eleventh studio album, &quot;Little Rope&quot;, produced by John Congleton, was released on Loma Vista Recordings. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Hell&quot; was released in conjunction with a music video on October 3, 2023. They announced a deluxe version of the same album and released the outtake &quot;Here Today&quot; on September 3, 2024.

== Musical style ==

Sleater-Kinney&#x27;s musical style was rooted in Olympia, Washington&#x27;s punk and independent rock scenes of the early- to mid-1990s, forming around the last years of the riot grrrl movement. Both Tucker and Brownstein came from veteran acts from the beginning of the movement. Although the band&#x27;s lyrics revolved around various topics, they were included in the riot grrrl movement because of the subject matter that supported feminist ideals. On the topic of the band&#x27;s involvement in political movements, Carrie Brownstein was quoted, &quot;Sleater-Kinney are brave enough and strong enough to make a difference and get the word out.&quot;

Their sound incorporates personal and social themes along with stripped-down music that was influenced by punk and the free-thinking ideals of the 1980s-1990s alternative and indie rock. They experimented with this foundation by bringing in different instruments and arrangements. Sleater-Kinney have been compared to female singers such as Siouxsie Sioux of Siouxsie and the Banshees, Patti Smith and Poly Styrene of X-Ray Spex. They have also named influences such as Bikini Kill, Mecca Normal, Bratmobile, Throwing Muses and Sonic Youth. Corin Tucker&#x27;s emotional vocals and the band&#x27;s lyrics alternate between personal and political topics, rebelling against war, traditionalism, gender roles and consumerism from feminist and progressive perspectives. Sleater-Kinney contributed the protest song &quot;Off With Your Head&quot; to NOFX leader Fat Mike&#x27;s &quot;Rock Against Bush&quot; compilation. In 2017, Sleater-Kinney contributed the single &quot;Here We Come&quot; to &quot;7-Inches For Planned Parenthood&quot;, which is a compilation of 7-inch records and digital downloads whose proceeds went to Planned Parenthood.

In a documentary about riot grrrl, Tucker revealed that her vocal style has always been intentionally harsh to suit the band&#x27;s message and to demand focus from the listener, and her vocals have been described by AllMusic critic Heather Phares as &quot;love-them-or-hate-them vocals.&quot; At the beginning of the band&#x27;s career, lead vocals were often performed by Tucker, though as the band progressed, Brownstein began to perform more vocals. Both Brownstein and Tucker played guitar, with Brownstein usually handling lead and Tucker performing rhythm. Although Sleater-Kinney had no bass player, both Tucker and Brownstein tuned their guitars one and a half steps down (D♭ tuning), and some argued Tucker&#x27;s tone and style enabled her to fill the same role as a bass guitar.

== Collaborations ==
In 1998, the band recorded &quot;Big Big Lights&quot; on the first split single (with Cypher in the Snow) in the series of recordings dealing with women&#x27;s self-defense, entitled &quot;Free to Fight&quot;, and released on Candy Ass Records. In 2000, all three members of Sleater-Kinney assisted Robert Forster and Grant McLennan of the now-defunct Brisbane indie band The Go-Betweens to record the album &quot;The Friends of Rachel Worth&quot;.

In 2003, the band recorded the song &quot;Angry Inch&quot; with Fred Schneider of The B-52&#x27;s for the &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; charity tribute album &quot;Wig in a Box&quot;. Proceeds for the album went to the Harvey Milk School, a school for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth.

Tucker was featured on Eddie Vedder&#x27;s solo album &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, where she performed vocals on the track &quot;Hard Sun&quot; along with Vedder. In 2008, Tucker collaborated again with Vedder on a cover of John Doe&#x27;s &quot;The Golden State&quot; on Doe&#x27;s own &quot;Golden State EP&quot;. On November 29, 2013, the members of Sleater-Kinney joined Pearl Jam, along with Scott McCaughey and Peter Buck of R.E.M., during a concert in Portland for a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Rocking in the Free World&quot;.

In 2015, Sleater-Kinney collaborated with the makers of the animated sitcom &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; to create a video for the song &quot;A New Wave&quot;, from their album &quot;No Cities to Love&quot;. In the summer of 2021, they collaborated in a joint tour with the band Wilco.

== Legacy ==
R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck has praised Sleater-Kinney, stating that they are his &quot;favorite punk band ever.&quot; During an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Britt Daniel of the band Spoon said, &quot;Even at that time, they felt legendary to me... Like they were coming out of nowhere with this sound that was totally unique and really aggressive. I hadn&#x27;t seen anything like that before, I hadn&#x27;t heard anything like that before.&quot; As a teenager, St. Vincent discovered &quot;All Hands on the Bad One&quot;, Sleater-Kinney&#x27;s 2000 album, &quot;and promptly went and mail-ordered every other Sleater-Kinney record at the time, had the posters on my wall,&quot; she said in a separate interview. Beth Ditto, singer of the Gossip, has emphasized the influence of the band in her career. British band Big Joanie has acknowledged the influence of the band and was included in the &quot;Dig Me Out&quot; covers album, released in 2022. The band covered the song &quot;Things you say&quot;. Gerard Way of the band My Chemical Romance is a fan of the band; he appeared in the official video for the song &quot;No Cities to Love&quot; and has covered the song &quot;I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone&quot; in concerts.

Corin Tucker was listed number 155 in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 2023 list of the 200 Best Singers, adding &quot;Punk is full of loud voices, but Corin Tucker&#x27;s voice stands out even in that genre&quot;.

<text>Siemens AG ( ) is a German multinational technology conglomerate. It is focused on industrial automation, distributed energy resources, rail transport and health technology. Siemens is the largest industrial manufacturing company in Europe, and holds the position of global market leader in industrial automation and industrial software.

The origins of the conglomerate can be traced back to 1847 to the &quot;Telegraphen Bau-Anstalt von Siemens &amp; Halske&quot; established in Berlin by Werner von Siemens and Johann Georg Halske. In 1966, the present-day corporation emerged from the merger of three companies: Siemens &amp; Halske, Siemens-Schuckert, and Siemens-Reiniger-Werke. Today headquartered in Munich and Berlin, Siemens and its subsidiaries employ approximately 320,000 people worldwide and reported a global revenue of around €78 billion in 2023. The company is a component of the DAX and Euro Stoxx 50 stock market indices. As of December 2023, Siemens is the second largest German company by market capitalization.

As of 2023, the principal divisions of Siemens are Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure, Mobility, and Financial Services, with Siemens Mobility operating as an independent entity. Major business divisions that were once part of Siemens before being spun off include semiconductor manufacturer Infineon Technologies (1999), Siemens Mobile (2005), Gigaset Communications (2008), the photonics business Osram (2013), Siemens Healthineers (2017), and Siemens Energy (2020).

== History ==

=== 1847 to 1901 ===

Siemens &amp; Halske was founded by Werner von Siemens and Johann Georg Halske on 1 October 1847. Based on the telegraph, their invention used a needle to point to the sequence of letters, instead of using Morse code. The company, then called &quot;Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens &amp; Halske&quot;, opened its first workshop on 12 October.

In 1848, the company built the first long-distance telegraph line in Europe: 500 km from Berlin to Frankfurt am Main. In 1850, the founder&#x27;s younger brother, Carl Wilhelm Siemens, later Sir William Siemens, started to represent the company in London. The London agency became a branch office in 1858. In the 1850s, the company was involved in building long-distance telegraph networks in Russia. In 1855, a company branch headed by another brother, Carl Heinrich von Siemens, opened in St Petersburg, Russia. In 1867, Siemens completed the monumental Indo-European telegraph line stretching over 11,000 km from London to Calcutta.
In 1867, Werner von Siemens described a dynamo without permanent magnets.

A similar system was also independently invented by Ányos Jedlik and Charles Wheatstone, but Siemens became the first company to build such devices. In 1881, a Siemens AC Alternator driven by a watermill was used to power the world&#x27;s first electric street lighting in the town of Godalming, United Kingdom. The company continued to grow and diversified into electric trains and light bulbs. In 1885, Siemens sold one of its generators to George Westinghouse, thereby enabling Westinghouse to begin experimenting with AC networks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

In 1887, Siemens opened its first office in Japan. In 1890, the founder retired and left the running of the company to his brother Carl and sons Arnold and Wilhelm. In 1892, Siemens was contracted to construct the Hobart electric tramway in Tasmania, Australia, as it increased its markets. The system opened in 1893 and became the first complete electric tram network in the Southern Hemisphere.

=== 1901 to 1933 ===

Siemens &amp; Halske (S &amp; H) was incorporated in 1897 and then merged parts of its activities with Schuckert &amp; Co., Nuremberg, in 1903 to become Siemens-Schuckert. In 1907, Siemens (Siemens &amp; Halske and Siemens-Schuckert) had 34,324 employees and was the seventh-largest company in the German empire by number of employees. (see List of German companies by employees in 1907)

In 1919, S &amp; H and two other companies jointly formed the Osram lightbulb company.

During the 1920s and 1930s, S &amp; H started to manufacture radios, television sets, and electron microscopes.

In 1932, Reiniger, Gebbert &amp; Schall (Erlangen), Phönix AG (Rudolstadt) and Siemens-Reiniger-Veifa mbH (Berlin) merged to form the Siemens-Reiniger-Werke AG (SRW), the third of the so-called parent companies that merged in 1966 to form the present-day Siemens AG.

In the 1920s, Siemens constructed the Ardnacrusha Hydro Power station on the River Shannon in the then Irish Free State, and it was a world first for its design. The company is remembered for its desire to raise the wages of its underpaid workers, only to be overruled by the Cumann na nGaedheal government.

===1933 to 1945===
Siemens (at the time: Siemens-Schuckert) exploited the forced labour of deported people in extermination camps. The company owned a plant in Auschwitz concentration camp.

Siemens exploited the forced labour of women deported to the Ravensbrück concentration camp; a Siemens factory was located in front of the camp.

During the final years of World War II, numerous plants and factories in Berlin and other major cities were destroyed by Allied air raids. To prevent further losses, manufacturing was therefore moved to alternative places and regions not affected by the air war. The goal was to secure continued production of important war-related and everyday goods. According to records, Siemens was operating almost 400 alternative or relocated manufacturing plants at the end of 1944 and in early 1945.

In 1972, Siemens sued German satirist F.C. Delius for his satirical history of the company, &quot;Unsere Siemens-Welt&quot;, and it was determined much of the book contained false claims although the trial itself publicized Siemens&#x27;s history in Nazi Germany. The company supplied electrical parts to Nazi concentration camps and death camps. The factories had poor working conditions, where malnutrition and death were common. Also, the scholarship has shown that the camp factories were created, run, and supplied by the SS, in conjunction with company officials, sometimes high-level officials.

===1945 to 2001===
In the 1950s, and from their new base in Bavaria, S&amp;H started to manufacture computers, semiconductor devices, washing machines, and pacemakers. In 1966, Siemens &amp; Halske (S&amp;H, founded in 1847), Siemens-Schuckertwerke (SSW, founded in 1903) and Siemens-Reiniger-Werke (SRW, founded in 1932) merged to form Siemens AG. In 1969, Siemens formed Kraftwerk Union with AEG by pooling their nuclear power businesses.
The company&#x27;s first digital telephone exchange was produced in 1980, and in 1988, Siemens and GEC acquired the UK defence and technology company Plessey. Plessey&#x27;s holdings were split, and Siemens took over the avionics, radar and traffic control businesses—as Siemens Plessey.

In 1977, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) entered into a joint venture with Siemens, which wanted to enhance its technology expertise and enter the American market. Siemens purchased 20% of AMD&#x27;s stock, giving the company an infusion of cash to increase its product lines. The two companies also jointly established Advanced Micro Computers (AMC), located in Silicon Valley and in Germany, allowing AMD to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field, in particular based on AMD&#x27;s second-source Zilog Z8000 microprocessors. When the two companies&#x27; vision for Advanced Micro Computers diverged, AMD bought out Siemens&#x27;s stake in the American division in 1979. AMD closed Advanced Micro Computers in late 1981 after switching focus to manufacturing second-source Intel x86 microprocessors.

In 1985, Siemens bought Allis-Chalmers&#x27; interest in the partnership company Siemens-Allis (formed 1978) which supplied electrical control equipment. It was incorporated into Siemens&#x27;s Energy and Automation division.

In 1987, Siemens reintegrated Kraftwerk Union, the unit overseeing nuclear power business.

In 1987, Siemens acquired Kongsberg Offshore from the Norwegian Government, selling it on to FMC Technologies in 1993.

In 1989, Siemens bought the solar photovoltaic business, including 3 solar module manufacturing plants, from industry pioneer ARCO Solar, owned by oil firm ARCO.

In 1991, Siemens acquired Nixdorf Computer and renamed it Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme, in order to produce personal computers.

In October 1991, Siemens acquired the Industrial Systems Division of Texas Instruments, based in Johnson City, Tennessee. This division was organized as Siemens Industrial Automation, and was later absorbed by Siemens Energy and Automation, Inc.

In 1992, Siemens bought out IBM&#x27;s half of ROLM (Siemens had bought into ROLM five years earlier), thus creating SiemensROLM Communications; eventually dropping ROLM from the name later in the 1990s.

In 1993–1994, Siemens C651 electric trains for Singapore&#x27;s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system were built in Austria.

In 1997, Siemens agreed to sell the defence arm of Siemens Plessey to British Aerospace (BAe) and a German aerospace company, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace. BAe and DASA acquired the British and German divisions of the operation respectively.

In October 1997, Siemens Financial Services (SFS) was founded to act as a competence center for financing issues and as a manager of financial risks within Siemens.

In 1998, Siemens acquired Westinghouse Power Generation for more than $1.5 billion from the CBS Corporation and moving Siemens from third to second in the world power generation market.

In 1999, Siemens&#x27;s semiconductor operations were spun off into a new company called Infineon Technologies. Its Electromechanical Components operations were converted into a legally independent company: Siemens Electromechanical Components GmbH &amp; Co. KG, (which, later that year, was sold to Tyco International Ltd for approximately $1.1 billion.

In the same year, Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG became part of Fujitsu Siemens Computers, with its retail banking technology group becoming Wincor Nixdorf.

In 2000, Shared Medical Systems Corporation was acquired by the Siemens&#x27;s Medical Engineering Group, eventually becoming part of Siemens Medical Solutions.

Also in 2000, Atecs-Mannesman was acquired by Siemens, The sale was finalised in April 2001 with 50% of the shares acquired, acquisition, &quot;Mannesmann VDO AG&quot; merged into Siemens Automotive forming Siemens VDO Automotive AG, &quot;Atecs Mannesmann Dematic Systems&quot; merged into Siemens Production and Logistics forming Siemens Dematic AG, &quot;Mannesmann Demag Delaval&quot; merged into the Power Generation division of Siemens AG. Other parts of the company were acquired by Robert Bosch GmbH at the same time. Also, Moore Products Co. of Spring House, PA USA was acquired by Siemens Energy &amp; Automation, Inc.

===2001 to 2005===

In 2001, Chemtech Group of Brazil was incorporated into the Siemens Group; it provides industrial process optimisation, consultancy and other engineering services.

Also in 2001, Siemens formed joint venture Framatome with Areva SA of France by merging much of the companies&#x27; nuclear businesses.

In 2002, Siemens sold some of its business activities to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. L.P. (KKR), with its metering business included in the sale package.

In 2002, Siemens abandoned the solar photovoltaic industry by selling its participation in a joint-venture company, established in 2001 with Shell and E.ON, to Shell.

In 2003, Siemens acquired the flow division of Danfoss and incorporated it into the Automation and Drives division. Also in 2003 Siemens acquired IndX software (realtime data organisation and presentation). The same year in an unrelated development Siemens reopened its office in Kabul. Also in 2003 agreed to buy Alstom Industrial Turbines; a manufacturer of small, medium and industrial gas turbines for €1.1 billion.
On 11 February 2003, Siemens planned to shorten phones&#x27; shelf life by bringing out annual Xelibri lines, with new devices launched as spring -summer and autumn-winter collections. On 6 March 2003, the company opened an office in San Jose. On 7 March 2003, the company announced that it planned to gain 10 per cent of the mainland China market for handsets. On 18 March 2003, the company unveiled the latest in its series of Xelibri fashion phones.

In 2004, the wind energy company Bonus Energy in Brande, Denmark was acquired, forming Siemens Wind Power division. Also in 2004, Siemens invested in Dasan Networks (South Korea, broadband network equipment) acquiring ~40% of the shares, Nokia Siemens disinvested itself of the shares in 2008. The same year Siemens acquired Photo-Scan (UK, CCTV systems), US Filter Corporation (water and Waste Water Treatment Technologies/ Solutions, acquired from Veolia), Huntsville Electronics Corporation (automobile electronics, acquired from Chrysler), and Chantry Networks (WLAN equipment).

In 2005, Siemens sold the Siemens mobile manufacturing business to BenQ, forming the BenQ-Siemens division. Also in 2005 Siemens acquired Flender Holding GmbH (Bocholt, Germany, gears/industrial drives), Bewator AB (building security systems), Wheelabrator Air Pollution Control, Inc. (Industrial and power station dust control systems), AN Windenergie GmbH. (Wind energy), Power Technologies Inc. (Schenectady, USA, energy industry software and training), CTI Molecular Imaging (Positron emission tomography and molecular imaging systems), Myrio (IPTV systems), Shaw Power Technologies International Ltd (UK/USA, electrical engineering consulting, acquired from Shaw Group), and Transmitton (Ashby de la Zouch UK, rail and other industry control and asset management).

=== 2005 and continuing: worldwide bribery scandal ===
Beginning in 2005, Siemens became embroiled in a multi-national bribery scandal. Among the various incidents was the Siemens Greek bribery scandal, where the company was accused of deals with Greek government officials during the 2004 Summer Olympics. This case, along with others, triggered legal investigations in Germany, initiated by prosecutors in Italy, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, and later followed by an American investigation in 2006 due to the company&#x27;s activities while listed on US stock exchanges.

Investigations found that Siemens had a pattern of bribing officials to secure contracts, with the company spending approximately $1.3 billion on bribes across several countries, and maintaining separate accounting records to conceal this. Following the investigations, Siemens settled in December 2008, paying a combined total of approximately $1.6 billion to the US and Germany in what was, at the time, the largest bribery fine in history. In addition, the company was required to invest $1 billion in developing and maintaining new internal compliance procedures. Siemens admitted to violating the accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, while its Bangladesh and Venezuela subsidiaries pleaded guilty to paying bribes.

Despite initial expectations of a fine as high as $5 billion, the final amount was significantly less, in part due to Siemens&#x27;s cooperation with the investigators, the upcoming change in the US administration, and Siemens&#x27;s role as a US military contractor. The payments included $450 million in fines and penalties and a forfeiture of $350 million in profits in the US. Siemens also revamped its compliance systems, appointing Peter Y. Solmssen, a US lawyer, as an independent director in charge of compliance and accepting oversight from Theo Waigel, a former German finance minister. Siemens implemented new anti-corruption policies, including a comprehensive anti-corruption handbook, online tools for due diligence and compliance, a confidential communications channel for employees, and a corporate disciplinary committee. This process involved hiring approximately 500 full-time compliance personnel worldwide.

Siemens&#x27;s bribery culture was not new; it was highlighted as far back as 1914 when both Siemens and Vickers were involved in a scandal over bribes paid to Japanese naval authorities. The company resorted to bribery as it sought to expand its business in the developing world after World War II. Up until 1999, bribes were a tax-deductible business expense in Germany, with no penalties for bribing foreign officials. However, with the implementation of the 1999 OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, Siemens started using off-shore accounts to hide its bribery.

During the investigation, key player Reinhard Siekaczek, a mid-level executive in the telecommunications unit, provided critical evidence. He disclosed that he had managed an annual global bribery budget of $40 to $50 million and provided information about the company&#x27;s 2,700 worldwide contractors, who were typically used to channel money to government officials. Notable instances of bribery included substantial payments in Argentina, Israel, Venezuela, China, Nigeria, and Russia to secure large contracts.

The investigation resulted in multiple prosecutions and settlements with various governments, as well as legal action against Siemens employees and those who received bribes. Noteworthy cases include the conviction of two former executives in 2007 for bribing Italian energy company Enel, a settlement with the Greek government in 2012 for 330 million euros over the Greek bribery scandal, and a guilty plea in 2014 from former Siemens executive Andres Truppel for channeling nearly $100 million in bribes to Argentine government officials. Siemens also faced repercussions from the World Bank due to fraudulent practices by its Russian affiliate. In 2009, Siemens agreed not to bid on World Bank projects for two years and to establish a $100 million fund at the World Bank to support anti-corruption activities over 15 years, known as the &quot;Siemens Integrity Initiative.&quot; Other substantial fines include a payment of ₦7 billion (US$ million) to the Nigerian government in 2010, and a US$42.7 million penalty in Israel in 2014 to avoid charges of securities fraud.

=== 2006 to 2011 ===

In 2006, Siemens purchased Bayer Diagnostics which was incorporated into the Medical Solutions Diagnostics division on 1 January 2007, also in 2006 Siemens acquired Controlotron (New York) (ultrasonic flow meters), and also in 2006 Siemens acquired Diagnostic Products Corp., Kadon Electro Mechanical Services Ltd. (now TurboCare Canada Ltd.), Kühnle, Kopp, &amp; Kausch AG, Opto Control, and VistaScape Security Systems.

In January 2007, Siemens was fined €396 million by the European Commission for price fixing in EU electricity markets through a cartel involving 11 companies, including ABB, Alstom, Fuji Electric, Hitachi Japan, AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Schneider, Areva, Toshiba and VA Tech. According to the commission, &quot;between 1988 and 2004, the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information.&quot; Siemens was given the highest fine of €396 million, more than half of the total, for its alleged leadership role in the activity.
In March 2007, a Siemens board member was temporarily arrested and accused of illegally financing AUB, a business-friendly labour association which competes against the trade union IG Metall. He was released on bail. Offices of AUB and Siemens were searched. Siemens denied any wrongdoing.

In April the Fixed Networks, Mobile Networks and Carrier Services divisions of Siemens merged with Nokia&#x27;s Network Business Group in a 50/50 joint venture, creating a fixed and mobile network company called Nokia Siemens Networks. Nokia delayed the merger due to bribery investigations against Siemens. In October 2007, a court in Munich found that the company had bribed public officials in Libya, Russia, and Nigeria in return for the awarding of contracts; four former Nigerian Ministers of Communications were among those named as recipients of the payments. The company admitted to having paid the bribes and agreed to pay a fine of 201 million euros. In December 2007, the Nigerian government cancelled a contract with Siemens due to the bribery findings.

Also in 2007, Siemens acquired Vai Ingdesi Automation (Argentina, Industrial Automation), UGS Corp., Dade Behring, Sidelco (Quebec, Canada), S/D Engineers Inc., and Gesellschaft für Systemforschung und Dienstleistungen im Gesundheitswesen mbH (GSD) (Germany).

In July 2008, Siemens AG formed a joint venture of the Enterprise Communications business with the Gores Group, renamed Unify in 2013. The Gores Group holding a majority interest of 51% stake, with Siemens AG holding a minority interest of 49%.

In August 2008, Siemens Project Ventures invested $15 million in the Arava Power Company. In a press release published that month, Peter Löscher, president and CEO of Siemens AG said: &quot;This investment is another consequential step in further strengthening our green and sustainable technologies&quot;. Siemens now holds a 40% stake in the company.

In January 2009, Siemens sold its 34% stake in Framatome, complaining limited managerial influence. In March, it formed an alliance with Rosatom of Russia to engage in nuclear-power activities.

In April 2009, Fujitsu Siemens Computers became Fujitsu Technology Solutions as a result of Fujitsu buying out Siemens&#x27;s share of the company.

In June 2009 news broke that Nokia Siemens had supplied telecommunications equipment to the Iranian telecom company that included the ability to intercept and monitor telecommunications, a facility known as &quot;lawful intercept&quot;. The equipment was believed to have been used in the suppression of the 2009 Iranian election protests, leading to criticism of the company, including by the European Parliament. Nokia Siemens later divested its call monitoring business, and reduced its activities in Iran.

In October 2009, Siemens signed a $418 million contract to buy Solel Solar Systems, an Israeli company in the solar thermal power business.

In December 2010, Siemens agreed to sell its IT Solutions and Services subsidiary for €850 million to Atos. As part of the deal, Siemens agreed to take a 15% stake in the enlarged Atos, to be held for a minimum of five years. In addition, Siemens concluded a seven-year outsourcing contract worth around €5.5 billion, under which Atos will provide managed services and systems integration to Siemens. At the same time, Germany’s Wegmann Group acquired Siemens&#x27;s 49-percent stake in armored vehicle manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann GmbH, establishing Wegmann as the sole shareholder of KMW, pending approval by government authorities.

=== 2011 to present ===

In March 2011, it was decided to list Osram on the stock market in the autumn, but CEO Peter Löscher said Siemens intended to retain a long-term interest in the company, which was already independent from the technological and managerial viewpoints.

In September 2011, Siemens, which had been responsible for constructing all 17 of Germany&#x27;s existing nuclear power plants, announced that it would exit the nuclear sector following the Fukushima disaster and the subsequent changes to German energy policy. Chief executive Peter Löscher has supported the German government&#x27;s planned &quot;Energiewende&quot;, its transition to renewable energy technologies, calling it a &quot;project of the century&quot; and saying Berlin&#x27;s target of reaching 35% renewable energy sources by 2020 was feasible.

In November 2012, Siemens acquired the Rail division of Invensys for £1.7 billion. In the same month, Siemens acquired a privately held company, LMS International NV.

In August 2013, Nokia acquired 100% of the company Nokia Siemens Networks, with a buy-out of Siemens AG, ending Siemens role in telecommunication.

In August 2013, Siemens won a $966.8 million order for power plant components from oil firm Saudi Aramco, the largest bid it has ever received from the Saudi company.

In 2014, Siemens announced plans to build a $264 million facility for making offshore wind turbines in Paull, England, as Britain&#x27;s wind power rapidly expands. Siemens chose the Hull area on the east coast of England because it is close to other large offshore projects planned in coming years. The new plant is expected to begin producing turbine rotor blades in 2016. The plant and the associated service center, in Green Port Hull nearby, will employ about 1,000 workers. The facilities will serve the UK market, where the electricity that major power producers generate from wind grew by about 38 percent in 2013, representing about 6 percent of total electricity, according to government figures. There are also plans to increase Britain&#x27;s wind-generating capacity at least threefold by 2020, to 14 gigawatts.

In May 2014, Rolls-Royce agreed to sell its gas turbine and compressor energy business to Siemens for £1 billion.

In June 2014, Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries announced their formation of joint ventures to bid for Alstom&#x27;s troubled energy and transportation businesses (in locomotives, steam turbines, and aircraft engines). A rival bid by General Electric (GE) has been criticized by French government sources, who consider Alstom&#x27;s operations as a &quot;vital national interest&quot; at a moment when the French unemployment level stands above 10% and some voters are turning towards the far-right.

In 2015, Siemens acquired U.S. oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand Group Inc for $7.6 billion.

In November 2016, Siemens acquired EDA company Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion.

In November 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice charged three Chinese employees of Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Company Limited with hacking into corporate entities, including Siemens AG.

<text>Taschen is a luxury art book publisher founded in 1980 by Benedikt Taschen in Cologne, Germany. As of January 2017, Taschen is co-managed by Benedikt Taschen and his eldest daughter, Marlene Taschen.

==History==
The company began as Taschen Comics, publishing Benedikt&#x27;s comic collection. Taschen focuses on making lesser-seen art available to mainstream bookstores, including fetishistic imagery, queer art, historical erotica, pornography, and adult magazines (including multiple books with &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine). The firm has brought potentially controversial art into broader public view, publishing it alongside its more mainstream books of comics reprints, art photography, painting, design, fashion, advertising history, film, and architecture.

Taschen publications are available in a various sizes, from oversized tomes to small pocket-sized books. The company has also produced calendars, address books, and postcards sets.

In 1985, Taschen introduced the &quot;Basic Art&quot; series with an inaugural title on Salvador Dalí. Today&#x27;s series comprises over 100 titles available in up to 30 languages, each about a separate artist, from classical to contemporary. Further series followed, alongside an expansion into new themes like architecture, design, film, and lifestyle. For example, the firm also publishes a &quot;Basic Architecture&quot; series in the same style as &quot;Basic Art&quot; that covers some of the most prominent architects in history.

=== Focus on male artists ===
In the spring of 2014, the firm&#x27;s &quot;Basic Art&quot; Series was criticised in Swedish public media for its focus on male artists. The series then consisted of 95 books, only five of which were female artists. Malmö Konsthall in Sweden was the first institution to report the disparity highlighted by the artists Ditte Ejlerskov and EvaMarie Lindahl.

=== The Helmut Newton SUMO ===
In 1999, Taschen expanded to the luxury market with the Helmut Newton &quot;SUMO&quot;.

Signed and limited to 10,000 copies, the folio-sized publication quickly sold out. It later became the most expensive book published in the 20th century, with SUMO copy number 1 selling at auction for $304,000.

This book paved the way for Taschen&#x27;s &quot;GOAT – Greatest Of All Time&quot;, an homage to Muhammad Ali, which &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; called &quot;the biggest, heaviest, most radiant thing ever printed in the history of civilization.&quot;

Further Collector&#x27;s Editions followed, including titles with Nobuyoshi Araki, Peter Beard, David Hockney, David LaChapelle, Sebastião Salgado, Annie Leibovitz and the Rolling Stones, often reaching ten times their original price within a few years.

== Book series ==
=== Bibliotheca Universalis ===
Taschen&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca Universalis&quot; is a series of famous artworks in an affordable (about 15 euros) hardback format (14 x 19.5 cm). They are generally multilingual, with English, German and French texts and legends. Some books are also published in Spanish, Italian and European Portuguese.

=== Taschen Basic Architecture ===
Taschen Basic Architecture is a series of books on architects published by Taschen. Each book looks at a different architect, with a biography and pictures of their work.

=== Taschen Basic Art ===
=== Taschen&#x27;s World Architecture ===
This book series of 40 volumes, published in the 1990s, provided a comprehensive survey of architecture from antiquity to the present day.

== Locations ==
Through the mid-to-late 1990s, the company expanded by opening stores in other cities. Some dedicated flagship Taschen bookstores, conceived in collaboration with artists and designers such as Albert Oehlen, Beatriz Milhazes, Jonas Wood, Marc Newson, Mark Grotjahn, Philippe Starck, and Toby Ziegler, are located in:
* Berlin 
* Beverly Hills 
* Brussels 
* Cologne
* Dallas (Taschen Library) 
* Hollywood
* Hong Kong 
* London 
* Madrid
* Miami 
* Milan 
* Paris
The firm has publishing offices in Berlin, Cologne, London, Paris, Los Angeles, and Hong Kong.

Between 2014 and 2018, Taschen owned and curated its own 6,000-square feet art gallery space in Los Angeles, featuring exhibitions on Michael Muller, Mick Rock, Ellen von Unwerth, and Albert Watson. The publishing house employs more than 250 staff members worldwide and many freelance editors.

<text>Iran Air, officially known as The Airline of the Islamic Republic of Iran (), or before known as The National Airline of Iran (), is the flag carrier of Iran, which is headquartered at Mehrabad Airport in Tehran. As of 2024, it operates scheduled services to 72 destinations in Asia and Europe. Iran Air&#x27;s main bases are Imam Khomeini International Airport and Mehrabad International Airport, both serving Tehran, the capital of Iran. Domestically, Iran Air is commonly known as [[Huma bird|Homa]] (Persian: ), which is the name of a mythical Persian phoenix or griffin, and also the acronym of &quot;Iran National Airlines&quot; in the Persian language. The airline&#x27;s cargo division, Iran Air Cargo, operates scheduled services internationally using one cargo aircraft.

The airline has been sanctioned in 2024 by the United States and the European Union for its role in the provision of Iranian weaponery to Russia during the Russia-Ukraine war.

==History==
===Early years===
Iranian Airways was founded in May 1944 by Reza Afshar and Gholam Ebtehaj. Post-war, its first passenger flight was from Tehran to Mashhad, followed by a Tehran-Esfahan-Shiraz-Bushehr-Abadan-Ahwaz service. In 1946 the airline established service to Cairo, Baghdad, and Tel Aviv, and in April 1947, to Paris. Between 1945 and 1962, the airline became a major domestic carrier, also operating some international flights to Europe each week. The fleet consisted of Douglas DC-3s initially, supplemented by Douglas DC-4 and Vickers Viscount aircraft later on.

In 1954, the privately-owned airline Persian Air Services (PAS) was established. PAS initially operated only freight services, followed by passenger operations between Tehran and other major cities in Iran. In 1960, PAS initiated passenger service to several European destinations, including Geneva, Paris, Brussels and London, using Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-7 aircraft leased from Belgium&#x27;s Sabena airline.

Iranian Airways was nationalized in 1961. On 24 February 1961, Iranian Airways and PAS merged to form the Iran National Airlines Corporation (HOMA), known as Iran Air, using the Homa bird as a symbol. HOMA was a public sector venture that combined the two predecessor air carriers. Among the aircraft used were Avro Yorks, Douglas DC-3s, Douglas DC-6s, and Vickers Viscounts. The carrier became a full member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in 1964. Iran Air and South African Airways were the launch customers for the Boeing 747SP.

===Rise to global prominence===


In 1965, Iran Air took delivery of its first jet aircraft, the Boeing 707 and six Boeing 727-100, followed by the Boeing 737-200 in 1971, three of the stretched Boeing 727-200 in 1974, and three variants of Boeing 747 (one 747-100B, two −200M and four SP), starting in 1978–1979. By the mid-1970s, Iran Air was serving cities in Europe with non-stop and one-stop flights, including over 30 flights a week to London alone.

On 29 May 1971, the Tehran to New York City route was inaugurated, using Boeing 707s making a stop-over at London Heathrow Airport. Shortly thereafter, the route was upgraded to a non-stop flight using Boeing 747SPs, making Iran Air the second Middle Eastern carrier (after El Al), to offer non-stop service to New York. With this flight, Iran Air set a new world record in time and distance for a non-stop, scheduled long-haul flight (12 hours and 15 minutes, 9,867 km – 6,131 mi – 5,328 nm). In 1978, the airline acquired six Airbus A300 aircraft for use on its domestic trunk and busy regional routes. By the end of that year, Iran Air was serving 31 international destinations stretching from New York City to Peking and Tokyo. Plans were made to offer direct services to Los Angeles and to Sydney, for which the airline&#x27;s long range Boeing 747SP aircraft were ideal. This would have allowed Iran Air to use Tehran as a midway point between East and West, because of its favorable geographical location. Such plans were never realized but they bear considerable resemblance to the hub-and-spoke strategies adopted by the ME3 carriers and Turkish Airlines.

Lt. Gen. Ali-Mohammad Khademi was the general manager of Iran Air from 1962 to 1978.

===The Islamic Revolution===

As a result of economic sanctions against Iran, Iran Air was unable to expand or replace its fleet. The last time Iran Air was delivered brand-new Western aircraft prior to the 2016 lifting of nuclear-related sanctions was in 1994 when it received two Airbus A300-B4s in compensation for the downing of Iran Air Flight 655 by an American cruiser in 1988.

In 2001, Iran Air purchased six second-hand Airbus A300s from Turkey, but only after two years, all six of them ended up grounded at airports in Tehran, Mashhad and Moscow. This caused significant controversy in Iran where officials cited GE engine design flaw and subsequent overheating as the reason for grounding the planes. One of these six planes was later confirmed to have returned to service by 2010.

As a result of the close ties between Iran and Venezuela, Iran Air launched a route from Tehran to Caracas via Damascus in March 2007. The airline codeshared with Conviasa on the flight, and the passengers included Iranian tourists and Lebanese Venezuelans. The service was costly to operate. Iran Air utilised a Boeing 747SP, which consumed large amounts of fuel. In addition, the company had to restrict the number of passengers on the flight from Damascus to Caracas, as the high altitude and heat prevented the plane from taking off with a full cabin and fuel tanks. Ultimately, Iran Air lost over per flight. In October 2007, it handed the route over to Conviasa.

Prior to the separation of Iran Air Tours from Iran Air in 2011, Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154s formed the backbone of the former&#x27;s fleet. However, several successive disasters involving this plane ultimately led to a 2011 blanket ban on its operations within Iranian airlines, including Iran Air Tours. The Tu-154 fleet was gradually replaced with MD-83s over the course of a few months.

According to Iran&#x27;s Deputy Minister of Roads and Urban Development in 2014, Iran had more than 100 planes, some of them owned by Iran Air, grounded due to the lack of access to new parts and technical expertise during the sanctions era.

The prolonged period of time that Iran Air was under international sanctions and barred from purchasing spare parts and new planes led to a dramatic rise in its average fleet age and plunging safety record. As of March 2017, Iran Air&#x27;s average fleet age stands at 24.1 years, though this figure is set to improve through addition of new deliveries.

Iran Air&#x27;s subpar on-time performance, amongst those of most other Iranian airlines, has led to public anger and frustration, often inciting protests in the form of violent confrontations with the airline employees or airplane sit-ins for many hours after a severely-delayed flight has finally landed. Officials routinely attribute the delays to the economic sanctions, although at least one pro-revolutionary ideologue has cited &quot;inefficiency and mismanagement&quot; as the chief cause of this issue.

===EU ban and refueling issues===
On 5 July 2010, an aviation official of Iran accused the UK, Germany and the United Arab Emirates of refusing to refuel Iranian passenger jets. This move followed unilateral sanctions imposed by the US over the nuclear weapons dispute. Iran Air and Mahan Air both claimed to have been denied refuelling. A spokeswoman for Abu Dhabi Airports Company (ADAC) said that a contract was in place to refuel Iranian passenger flights and ADAC would continue to do so. A spokesperson for the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority said that it was the sole decision of independent suppliers if aircraft were to be refuelled or not. Germany&#x27;s Transport Ministry said the refuelling of Iranian aircraft was not banned under EU or UN sanctions but did not say whether any independent refuellers were denying refuelling. Later in the day, Dubai Airport revealed that it continued to refuel Iranian passengers flights in and out of Dubai. The next day, a spokesperson for Iran said that no such limitation had been imposed.

On 6 July 2010, it was announced that the European Commission would ban all of Iran Air&#x27;s Airbus A320, Boeing 727 and Boeing 747 fleet from the EU over safety concerns. This move came as a major blow to Iran Air, limiting flights to Europe with its own aircraft.

In 2012, the EU re-allowed the refuelling of Iran Air aircraft at secondary European airports such as Ljubljana and Budapest, in an effort to retain the refuelling contracts within the EU, rather than letting them go to Serbia or later Belarus and Ukraine.

In January 2012, Iran Air&#x27;s flights to and from London Heathrow operated with a fuel stop at Manston Airport in Kent. However, the airport announced in December 2011 that this arrangement was to end and it would no longer refuel the company&#x27;s aircraft. This announcement swiftly followed the closure of Iran&#x27;s embassy in London as the consequence of the ransacking of the British embassy in Tehran. The airport stressed that it had not breached any trade agreements, as it had no connections with the US.

===Lifting of sanctions and modernization plans===
In anticipation of a deal being reached for the lifting of sanctions, the chairman of Iran Air, Farhad Parvaresh, stated that the airline would then seek to obtain at least 100 wide-body and short-haul jets.

On Friday 15 January 2016 US president Barack Obama authorized his secretary of state, John Kerry, to lift the sanctions on Iran civil aviation. Following Iran&#x27;s implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on 16 January 2016, all sanctions on Iran civil aviation were lifted. As a result, Iranian airlines, including Iran Air, were granted permission to purchase new civil aircraft from any manufacturer as well as to refuel at all European airports, except for two Swedish destinations, Stockholm and Gothenburg, due to the fuel supplier BP still refusing to provide fuel to the Iranian carriers.

On 24 January 2016 Tehran hosted the CAPA Iran Aviation Summit organised by CAPA - Centre for Aviation in order to bring both Iranian and international aviation authorities together for considering development plans for Iran&#x27;s aviation industry. CAPA put the size of Iran&#x27;s economy somewhere between those of Turkey and Australia, whose commercial airline fleets are in the order of 500-600 aircraft. Bombardier presented its regional models during the CAPA summit in Tehran. In a statement, Mr. Parvaresh announced that his airline expected to spend some 3-5 billion US dollars purchasing regional aircraft from manufacturers Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and Embraer.

===Further sanctions===
On 8 May 2018, following US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, and as part of the reinstatement of the United States sanctions against Iran lifted in 2015, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the decision to revoke all Iran sales licenses already granted to plane manufacturers Boeing and Airbus after a 90-day period.

It was announced that Iran Air had to cancel the order for Boeing aircraft due to President Trump&#x27;s decision to reimpose sanctions against Iran, despite this it has been announced that Iran Air will still be receiving ATR aircraft. It has not yet been announced if Airbus aircraft will still be delivered. Any aircraft being delivered to Iran Air must be delivered within a 90 to 180 day period before the sanctions begin. While members of the Trump administration have advised European companies to stop doing business with Iran now, Federica Mogherini said the European aim was &quot;maintaining and deepening economic relations with Iran. &quot;The technical experts plan to propose ways to avert disruptions in air, sea and land transport from and to Iran and keep channels open for &quot;effective banking transactions.&quot;

In September 2024, Germany, France and the United Kingdom announced a new row of sanctions against Iran Air, restricting the airline&#x27;s ability to operate into European airspace. That same month, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Iran Air due to its role in the transfer of weaponry to Russia during the Russia-Ukraine war. In October 2024, the European Union sanctioned Iran Air due to its role in transferring ballistic missiles to Russia.

==Onboard restrictions==
Iran Air is one of the few airlines in the world that, pursuant to Islamic law, does not serve alcoholic beverages on any of its flights. Moreover, there is no choice of non-Halal food selections, such as those containing pork, on Iran Air&#x27;s menu. This is a policy similar to many other airlines based in predominantly Muslim countries.

==Destinations==
As of September 2023, Iran Air operated flights to various domestic and international destinations across Asia and Europe. 
In late 2024, the European Union imposed sanctions on Iran Air, leading to the cancellation of all flights to the European Union.

===Pilgrims and Hajj===
Until 2016, Hajj charter operations formed a major part of Iran Air&#x27;s annual activities. Every year, tens of thousands of pilgrims flew from major cities in Iran to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s air gateway to Mecca, to take part in pilgrimage ceremonies. In 2016, due to escalating tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, all Hajj flights from Iran were suspended indefinitely. These flights resumed from 2017.

===Codeshare agreements===
Iran Air had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
*Austrian Airlines
*Lufthansa
*Turkish Airlines

==Fleet==

===Former fleet===

Iran Air has previously operated the following aircraft:

====Concorde order====
On 8 October 1972, Iran Air placed an order with British Aircraft Corporation for two Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde supersonic jets plus an option for one, rendering it the last airline to place Concorde orders for commercial use. However, Iran Air – having had briefly chartered one Concorde jet on flights between Tehran and Paris – cancelled these orders in April 1980.

==Former subsidiaries==
===Iran Air Tours===
Iran Air Tours was founded in 1973 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Iran Air, focusing on charter flights and tourism. In 2011, the company was purchased by Hesayar Cooperative Company, itself a subsidiary of the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics. However, Hesayar failed to meet its financial commitments and the airline promptly returned to private hands in 2016. The airline will increase the number of flights from Isfahan and Shiraz airports to Kuwait International Airport as of 17 April 2022.

===Homa Hotel Group===
Homa Hotel Group was founded in 1979 by the Government of Iran after it completed a nationalization of the hotel industry. As of 2016, it was owned by Iran&#x27;s Social Security Organization.

==Accidents and incidents==

===Overview===
Before the two companies merged in 1962 to form Iran Air, Iranian Airways and Persian Air Services had several aircraft hull losses. Iranian Airways lost six Douglas DC-3s in crashes and a fire between 1949 and 1959; and one of its Douglas DC-4s was shot down in 1961; while Persian Air Services lost three Avro Yorks in crashes and a maintenance accident between 1955 and 1959. Since 1962, Iran Air has had more than a dozen aircraft hull losses in crashes and the shooting-down of Iran Air Flight 655; the airline has also experienced twenty hijacking incidents on its aircraft.

====Incidents====
* On 14 September 1950, an Iranian Airways Douglas DC-3, registration EP-AAG, bound for Saudi Arabia, crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran Mehrabad International Airport. The nine people on board, all employees of the airline, were killed.
* On 25 December 1952, an Iranian Airways Douglas DC-3 with twenty-one passengers and a crew of four on board crashed while on approach to Tehran airport. There was one survivor.
* On the evening of 21 January 1980, a Boeing 727-100 operating as Iran Air Flight 291 hit high ground north of Tehran in a snowstorm during its landing approach to Tehran&#x27;s Mehrabad Airport, after the pilot failed to follow the correct path to the runway. All 128 passengers and crew on board were killed.
* On 3 July 1988, Iran Air Flight 655 was flying over the Persian Gulf on its way to Dubai from Bandar Abbas. According to the U.S. version of events, the crew of the United States Navy cruiser mistook the airliner for an Iranian Air Force Grumman F-14 Tomcat jet fighter and the cruiser shot the airliner down with a missile, killing all 16 crew and 274 passengers. Iran maintains it was an intentional act of barbarism.
* On 9 June 1996 a Boeing 727-200 on a pilot training flight landed on its belly at Rasht Airport on its fifteenth touch-and-go landing in a series, after the crew forgot to extend the landing gear. The aircraft slid for more than along the runway; instead of allowing the aircraft to stop, the crew lifted off again and circled the airport to return for a landing with the gear extended. While circling, a fire broke out in the aircraft&#x27;s rear fuselage, damaging its flight control systems. As the aircraft neared the ground it rolled left, the wing hit the ground, and the aircraft crashed in a field, killing four of the seven crewmembers on board.
* On 2 February 2000, a Lockheed C-130 Hercules owned by the Iranian Air Force lost control and veered off the runway, striking an Airbus A300B2-203 owned by Iran Air, killing eight people. Both aircraft were written off.
* On 2 January 2008, Iran Air Fokker 100 EP-IDB carrying 100 passengers skidded off the runway after its wing caught fire, when taking off for a domestic flight to Shiraz International Airport from Mehrabad Airport. No one was injured in the accident, which happened amid heavy snowfall at the airport. The aircraft was written off.
* On 9 January 2011 Iran Air Flight 277, a Boeing 727-200 (registration: EP-IRP) originating from Tehran, crashed near its destination city of Orumiyeh, northwest of Tehran, during an attempted go-around in poor weather. It was carrying 105 people, of whom at least 78 were killed.
* On 18 October 2011, a Boeing 727-200 (registration: EP-IRR) operating a flight from Moscow as Flight 742 landed with the nose landing gear jammed in the retracted position at Mehrabad International Airport. All 113 occupants on board survived without incident.

<doc id="168639" wikidata="Q2284057" url="?curid=168639" title="Girl, Interrupted">
<text>Girl, Interrupted is a best-selling 1993 memoir by American author Susanna Kaysen, relating her experiences as a young woman in an American psychiatric hospital in the 1960s after being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.

The memoir&#x27;s title is a reference to the Johannes Vermeer painting &quot;Girl Interrupted at Her Music&quot;. Kaysen draws a parallel between the Vermeer painting and her own life by equating music interrupting the girl, with the struggles of poor mental health in adolescence interrupting healthy development, both serving as an impediment to personal evolution. Kaysen draws on the painting as a source of inspiration for critical analysis of the female teenage experience.

While writing the novel &quot;Far Afield&quot;, Kaysen began to recall her almost two years at McLean Hospital. She obtained her file from the hospital with the help of a lawyer. A film adaptation of the memoir directed by James Mangold and starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie was released in 1999. The memoir inspired the 2021 album &quot;Queens of the Summer Hotel&quot; by the singer-songwriter Aimee Mann.

==Plot==
In April 1967, 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen is admitted to McLean Hospital, in Belmont, Massachusetts, after attempting suicide by overdosing on pills. She denies that it was a suicide attempt to a psychiatrist, who suggests she take time to regroup in McLean, a private mental hospital. Susanna is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and her stay extends to 18 months, rather than the proposed couple of weeks.

Fellow patients Polly, Cynthia, Lisa Rowe, Lisa Cody, Georgina and Daisy contribute to Susanna&#x27;s experiences at McLean as she describes their personal issues and how they come to cope with the time they must spend in the hospital. The memoir&#x27;s descriptions of supporting characters gives the reader an idea of how severe each of the characters&#x27; circumstances are, which in turn creates a dichotomy between Susanna and the other admittees. Susanna also introduces the reader to some of the staff members, including Valerie, Dr. Wick and Mrs. McWilley. Susanna questions whether the doctors have genuine intentions to successfully treat their patients due to the lack of health progress amongst her peers. Susanna and the other girls are eventually informed that the recently released Daisy died by suicide on her birthday. Daisy&#x27;s death deeply saddens the girls and they hold a prolonged moment of silence in her memory.

Susanna reflects on the nature of her illness, including the difficulty she has making sense of visual patterns, and suggests that sanity is a falsehood constructed to help the &quot;healthy&quot; feel &quot;normal&quot; in comparison. She also questions how doctors treat mental illness, and whether they are treating the brain or the mind. During her stay in the ward, Susanna also undergoes a period of depersonalization, where she bites open the flesh on her hand after she becomes terrified that she has &quot;lost her bones&quot;. She develops a frantic obsession with the verification of this proposed reality and even insists on seeing an X-ray of herself to make sure. This hectic moment is described with short, choppy sentences that show Kaysen&#x27;s state of mind and her thought processes as she went through them. Also, during a trip to the dentist with Valerie, Susanna becomes frantic after she wakes from the general anesthesia, when no one will tell her how long she was unconscious, and she fears that she has lost time. Like the incident with her bones, Kaysen here also rapidly spirals into a panicky and obsessive state that is only calmed with medication.

After leaving McLean, Susanna mentions that she kept in touch with Georgina and eventually saw Lisa, now a single mother who was about to board the subway with her toddler son and seemed, although quirky, to be sane. Susanna&#x27;s static mental health state and uncertainty about being &quot;cured&quot; when she is officially released from the institution sheds light on the subjectivity of mental illness. Individuals who exhibit emotions not commonly expressed are ostracized from society when in reality as humans we are all capable of experiencing mental health crises if strictly analyzed by a professional. Being &quot;crazy&quot; was her natural response to life&#x27;s stressors at an especially vulnerable time dedicated to healing her inner child.

==Characters==
Alongside Kaysen, there are two main groups of characters: the patients and the staff. In addition there are Kaysen&#x27;s parents, her boyfriend, and various other minor characters, such as her former boss.

===Patients===
;Susanna Kaysen
:The autobiographical main character, Susanna Kaysen, is admitted to a psychiatric ward to be treated for borderline personality disorder following a suicide attempt. She voluntarily admits herself after a short consultation with a psychiatrist who is also an acquaintance of the family. She is told that she will only be staying there for a few weeks, but it turns out to be one and a half years instead. Throughout the book, she frequently contrasts the time of the consultation, twenty minutes, to the time she ended up spending institutionalised.
;Lisa Rowe
:Lisa is diagnosed as a sociopath, but whether she actually is one is left open to interpretation. Lisa periodically escapes from the hospital, only to be found a day or two later and re-admitted. She is usually happy enough to be back though she does put up a fight when restrained. She is an ex-junkie who sleeps intermittently and barely eats, and enjoys making trouble for the staff. She apparently takes some pride in her diagnosis. Although she has a therapist assigned to her, she never actually sees him. Lisa is not in contact with her family except her brother, but the extent of their contact is not described. She also has a lawyer, though it appears he is mostly used to threaten the staff if she doesn&#x27;t get what she wants. Her behavior is wildly unpredictable, and while she can be kind, she is also capable of cruelty towards the other patients. For example, Lisa has an ongoing rivalry with Lisa Cody that ends in Lisa Cody reverting to drugs.
;Polly Clark
:Polly is a disfigured patient who has been hospitalized for schizophrenia and depression. Polly has severe scarring on her body, the result of setting herself on fire. According to Kaysen, because of the sheer guts it took to actually do it, Polly is highly respected for her courage, to the extent that none of the patients will ask why she did it. During her first year at the hospital, she appears calm and even cheerful: &quot;Life was hellish, she knew that. But, her smile hinted, she&#x27;d burned all that out of her.&quot; But one day she suddenly breaks down and begins to scream inconsolably, as if realizing for the first time her appearance and the permanency of it. Kaysen then realizes that while the other patients might be released from the hospital, Polly is trapped forever in her scarred body.
;Georgina Tuskin
:Hospitalized for schizophrenia, Georgina is Susanna&#x27;s roommate at the institution. The two of them are considered the healthiest patients on the ward and are good friends throughout the book. Georgina apparently experienced her first symptoms after an episode in a movie theater where she suddenly felt as if the darkness had surrounded her completely. It is not clear what the immediate reason for her diagnosis is. She also has a boyfriend in the hospital named Wade. 
;Lisa Cody
:Lisa is admitted to the ward after Susanna, and from her first days there she looks up to Lisa Rowe. She, too, is diagnosed as a sociopath, though Rowe questions this and is clearly annoyed that she is no longer the only sociopath there. A former drug addict like Rowe, she tries hard to defend herself from Lisa Rowe&#x27;s accusations that she isn&#x27;t &quot;real&quot;. She eventually escapes and is apparently found by Lisa Rowe during one of her escapes from the hospital. Lisa tells the other girls with pride that Lisa Cody has become a &quot;real&quot; drug addict. Her fate after her escape is not described any further.
;Daisy Randone
:Daisy is a thin girl who arrives before Thanksgiving each year, staying through Christmas. She has a single room, where she spends most of her time. The other girls think she is addicted to laxatives. She eats only chicken, and does so only in her room. However, after letting Lisa into her room, Lisa reports back to the rest of them that she only needs the laxatives because of all of the chicken. She peels off the meat and keeps the carcasses, saying that when she has 14 carcasses, it is time to leave the hospital, possibly due to obsessive–compulsive disorder. Daisy&#x27;s father visits her quite often, and it is implied he has incestuous feelings for her. Daisy eventually commits suicide on her birthday. Susanna describes her as &quot;sexy&quot; and says Daisy had a spark that the rest of the girls lack. Daisy is reclusive and often refuses to be social. She hates it when anyone goes near her and is hostile when people approach her. However, she does allow Lisa to enter her room. Sometimes they even share cigarettes, indicating that Daisy does respect Lisa out of all the other patients on the ward.
;Torrey
:Torrey is a former drug addict. She was put into the ward after her parents discovered her promiscuity. She is the best friend of all the fellow patients. Her parents take her out against her will, and take her back to Mexico, where she believes she will become an amphetamineaddict again. She describes Mexico, saying &quot;being in Mexico means being dead and shooting speed to feel like you&#x27;re not quite dead&quot; (Kaysen, 97). The girls do try to help her with an escape plan and pool their money to help her, but eventually that plan is ruined, partly by Torrey herself, as she is too afraid to do it, and partly by Valerie after she gives Torrey a cup of thorazine just prior to her departure to calm her down. Though she only appears for a short time she is an important character. Kaysen distinguishes between those put there indefinitely by parents willing to pay without questioning the progress of their treatment and those whose parents are not willing to do so. Torrey is used as an example of the latter group.
;Alice Calais
:At first Alice seems quiet and, in Kaysen&#x27;s words, &quot;not too crazy&quot;; but after about a month she breaks down and is taken to maximum security. When the girls go to visit her they find that she has painted herself and the walls in her seclusion room with her own feces. Most of the other patients believe she was &quot;raised in a closet&quot; because she is ignorant about the trivial things in life. For example, she has never tasted honey and doesn&#x27;t know how it tastes. She is also completely unaware that her last name is a well-known location in France and is overwhelmed in awe when she hears of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. It is not explained what happens to her after the girls visit her.
;Wade Barker
:Wade, Georgina&#x27;s boyfriend, is also a patient. Wade entertains the female patients with stories about his father, who he claims is a CIA agent with powerful friends involved in secret government conspiracies. The hospital regards Wade&#x27;s beliefs as delusional. He is prone to violent outbursts, which eventually results in his being moved to the maximum-security ward. It is revealed that Wade&#x27;s father&#x27;s friends are G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt, implying that Wade&#x27;s father is Bernard Barker and that his delusions were based in fact.
;Cynthia Crowley
:A severely depressive patient who undergoes weekly electroconvulsive therapy. There are only a few references to her in the book and she is not a major character.

===Staff===
;Valerie
:The head nurse on the ward. She works there during the day and though she can be strict she is generally liked by the patients, and by Kaysen in particular. She is described as down-to-earth and rarely uses the psychiatric terms used by the therapists (terms that Susanna herself despises). Kaysen recalls her as honest and direct.
;Mrs. McWilley
:The evening nurse on the ward. Described as the exact opposite of Valerie and very much disliked by the patients. Kaysen recalls her as &quot;clearly nuts&quot;. Valerie does not like her and tends to ignore her, although she does describe her as a professional when the patients complain to her. 
;Dr. Wick
:The consultant psychiatrist. She is described as very old-fashioned and easy to embarrass. Susanna purposely tries to embarrass her, deliberately saying things that she knows Dr. Wick will react to, during their sessions together. She has previously worked in Africa and her direct contact with the patients is very limited, talking to them for only a matter of minutes in a session.
;Melvin
:Kaysen&#x27;s late therapist and analyst. Susanna says that the two of them used to be good friends and that she once enjoyed sessions with him. According to her, he was old, balding, and slightly unattractive. Susanna would go into his office sometimes and just sit there in silence because there wasn&#x27;t very much silence in the hospital and she needed a break. However, this relationship was short-lived; Melvin rolled into the hospital parking lot, and, when greeted enthusiastically by Susanna, refused to entertain her. Her opinion of him spiraled downward from that point.

== Adaptations ==
A film adaptation directed by James Mangold and starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie was released in 1999. In 2018, the American singer-songwriter Aimee Mann and the producers Barbara Broccoli and Frederick Zollo began developing a musical based on &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, but this was canceled by the COVID-19 pandemic. The songs became the basis of Mann&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;Queens of the Summer Hotel&quot;, released on November 5, 2021.

<doc id="168651" wikidata="Q381233" url="?curid=168651" title="High-performance liquid chromatography">
<text>High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), formerly referred to as high-pressure liquid chromatography, is a technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify specific components in mixtures. The mixtures can originate from food, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biological, environmental and agriculture, etc., which have been dissolved into liquid solutions.

It relies on high pressure pumps, which deliver mixtures of various solvents, called the mobile phase, which flows through the system, collecting the sample mixture on the way, delivering it into a cylinder, called the column, filled with solid particles, made of adsorbent material, called the stationary phase.

Each component in the sample interacts differently with the adsorbent material, causing different migration rates for each component. These different rates lead to separation as the species flow out of the column into a specific detector such as UV detectors. The output of the detector is a graph, called a chromatogram. Chromatograms are graphical representations of the signal intensity versus time or volume, showing peaks, which represent components of the sample. Each sample appears in its respective time, called its retention time, having area proportional to its amount.

HPLC is widely used for manufacturing (&quot;e.g.&quot;, during the production process of pharmaceutical and biological products), legal (&quot;e.g.&quot;, detecting performance enhancement drugs in urine), research (&quot;e.g.&quot;, separating the components of a complex biological sample, or of similar synthetic chemicals from each other), and medical (&quot;e.g.&quot;, detecting vitamin D levels in blood serum) purposes.

Chromatography can be described as a mass transfer process involving adsorption and/or partition. As mentioned, HPLC relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid and a sample mixture through a column filled with adsorbent, leading to the separation of the sample components. The active component of the column, the adsorbent, is typically a granular material made of solid particles (&quot;e.g.&quot;, silica, polymers, etc.), 1.5–50 μm in size, on which various reagents can be bonded. The components of the sample mixture are separated from each other due to their different degrees of interaction with the adsorbent particles. The pressurized liquid is typically a mixture of solvents (&quot;e.g.&quot;, water, buffers, acetonitrile and/or methanol) and is referred to as a &quot;mobile phase&quot;. Its composition and temperature play a major role in the separation process by influencing the interactions taking place between sample components and adsorbent. These interactions are physical in nature, such as hydrophobic (dispersive), dipole–dipole and ionic, most often a combination.

== Operation ==
The liquid chromatograph is complex and has sophisticated and delicate technology. In order to properly operate the system, there should be a minimum basis for understanding of how the device performs the data processing to avoid incorrect data and distorted results.

HPLC is distinguished from traditional (&quot;low pressure&quot;) liquid chromatography because operational pressures are significantly higher (around 50–1400 bar), while ordinary liquid chromatography typically relies on the force of gravity to pass the mobile phase through the packed column. Due to the small sample amount separated in analytical HPLC, typical column dimensions are 2.1–4.6 mm diameter, and 30–250 mm length. Also HPLC columns are made with smaller adsorbent particles (1.5–50 μm in average particle size). This gives HPLC superior resolving power (the ability to distinguish between compounds) when separating mixtures, which makes it a popular chromatographic technique.

The schematic of an HPLC instrument typically includes solvents&#x27; reservoirs, one or more pumps, a solvent-degasser, a sampler, a column, and a detector. The solvents are prepared in advance according to the needs of the separation, they pass through the degasser to remove dissolved gasses, mixed to become the mobile phase, then flow through the sampler, which brings the sample mixture into the mobile phase stream, which then carries it into the column. The pumps deliver the desired flow and composition of the mobile phase through the stationary phase inside the column, then directly into a flow-cell inside the detector. The detector generates a signal proportional to the amount of sample component emerging from the column, hence allowing for quantitative analysis of the sample components. The detector also marks the time of emergence, the retention time, which serves for initial identification of the component. More advanced detectors, provide also additional information, specific to the analyte&#x27;s characteristics, such as UV-VIS spectrum or mass spectrum, which can provide insight on its structural features. These detectors are in common use, such as UV/Vis, photodiode array (PDA) / diode array detector and mass spectrometry detector.

A digital microprocessor and user software control the HPLC instrument and provide data analysis. Some models of mechanical pumps in an HPLC instrument can mix multiple solvents together at a ratios changing in time, generating a composition gradient in the mobile phase. Most HPLC instruments also have a column oven that allows for adjusting the temperature at which the separation is performed.

The sample mixture to be separated and analyzed is introduced, in a discrete small volume (typically microliters), into the stream of mobile phase percolating through the column. The components of the sample move through the column, each at a different velocity, which are a function of specific physical interactions with the adsorbent, the stationary phase. The velocity of each component depends on its chemical nature, on the nature of the stationary phase (inside the column) and on the composition of the mobile phase. The time at which a specific analyte elutes (emerges from the column) is called its retention time. The retention time, measured under particular conditions, is an identifying characteristic of a given analyte.

Many different types of columns are available, filled with adsorbents varying in particle size, porosity, and surface chemistry. The use of smaller particle size packing materials requires the use of higher operational pressure (&quot;backpressure&quot;) and typically improves chromatographic resolution (the degree of peak separation between consecutive analytes emerging from the column). Sorbent particles may be ionic, hydrophobic or polar in nature.

The most common mode of liquid chromatography is reversed phase, whereby the mobile phases used, include any miscible combination of water or buffers with various organic solvents (the most common are acetonitrile and methanol). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see normal-phase chromatography below). The aqueous component of the mobile phase may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid) or salts to assist in the separation of the sample components. The composition of the mobile phase may be kept constant (&quot;isocratic elution mode&quot;) or varied (&quot;gradient elution mode&quot;) during the chromatographic analysis. Isocratic elution is typically effective in the separation of simple mixtures. Gradient elution is required for complex mixtures, with varying interactions with the stationary and mobile phases. This is the reason why in gradient elution the composition of the mobile phase is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the mobile phase is reflected by analyte retention times, as the high eluting strength speeds up the elution (resulting in shortening of retention times). For example, a typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography for might start at 5% acetonitrile (in water or aqueous buffer) and progress linearly to 95% acetonitrile over 5–25 minutes. Periods of constant mobile phase composition (plateau) may be also part of a gradient profile. For example, the mobile phase composition may be kept constant at 5% acetonitrile for 1–3 min, followed by a linear change up to 95% acetonitrile.

The chosen composition of the mobile phase depends on the intensity of interactions between various sample components (&quot;analytes&quot;) and stationary phase (&quot;e.g.&quot;, hydrophobic interactions in reversed-phase HPLC). Depending on their affinity for the stationary and mobile phases, analytes partition between the two during the separation process taking place in the column. This partitioning process is similar to that which occurs during a liquid–liquid extraction but is continuous, not step-wise.

In the example using a water/acetonitrile gradient, the more hydrophobic components will elute (come off the column) later, then, once the mobile phase gets richer in acetonitrile (&quot;i.e.&quot;, in a mobile phase becomes higher eluting solution), their elution speeds up.

The choice of mobile phase components, additives (such as salts or acids) and gradient conditions depends on the nature of the column and sample components. Often a series of trial runs is performed with the sample in order to find the HPLC method which gives adequate separation.

==History and development==

Prior to HPLC, scientists used benchtop column liquid chromatographic techniques. Liquid chromatographic systems were largely inefficient due to the flow rate of solvents being dependent on gravity. Separations took many hours, and sometimes days to complete. Gas chromatography (GC) at the time was more powerful than liquid chromatography (LC), however, it was obvious that gas phase separation and analysis of very polar high molecular weight biopolymers was impossible. GC was ineffective for many life science and health applications for biomolecules, because they are mostly non-volatile and thermally unstable at the high temperatures of GC. As a result, alternative methods were hypothesized which would soon result in the development of HPLC.

Following on the seminal work of Martin and Synge in 1941, it was predicted by Calvin Giddings, Josef Huber, and others in the 1960s that LC could be operated in the high-efficiency mode by reducing the packing-particle diameter substantially below the typical LC (and GC) level of 150 μm and using pressure to increase the mobile phase velocity. These predictions underwent extensive experimentation and refinement throughout the 60s into the 70s until these very days. Early developmental research began to improve LC particles, for example the historic Zipax, a superficially porous particle.

The 1970s brought about many developments in hardware and instrumentation. Researchers began using pumps and injectors to make a rudimentary design of an HPLC system. Gas amplifier pumps were ideal because they operated at constant pressure and did not require leak-free seals or check valves for steady flow and good quantitation. Hardware milestones were made at Dupont IPD (Industrial Polymers Division) such as a low-dwell-volume gradient device being utilized as well as replacing the septum injector with a loop injection valve.

While instrumentation developments were important, the history of HPLC is primarily about the history and evolution of particle technology. After the introduction of porous layer particles, there has been a steady trend to reduced particle size to improve efficiency. However, by decreasing particle size, new problems arose. The practical disadvantages stem from the excessive pressure drop needed to force mobile fluid through the column and the difficulty of preparing a uniform packing of extremely fine materials. Every time particle size is reduced significantly, another round of instrument development usually must occur to handle the pressure.

==Types==

===Partition chromatography===

Partition chromatography was one of the first kinds of chromatography that chemists developed, and is barely used these days. The partition coefficient principle has been applied in paper chromatography, thin layer chromatography, gas phase and liquid–liquid separation applications. The 1952 Nobel Prize in chemistry was earned by Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge for their development of the technique, which was used for their separation of amino acids. Partition chromatography uses a retained solvent, on the surface or within the grains or fibers of an &quot;inert&quot; solid supporting matrix as with paper chromatography; or takes advantage of some coulombic and/or hydrogen donor interaction with the stationary phase. Analyte molecules partition between a liquid stationary phase and the eluent. Just as in hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC; a sub-technique within HPLC), this method separates analytes based on differences in their polarity. HILIC most often uses a bonded polar stationary phase and a mobile phase made primarily of acetonitrile with water as the strong component. Partition HPLC has been used historically on unbonded silica or alumina supports. Each works effectively for separating analytes by relative polar differences. HILIC bonded phases have the advantage of separating acidic, basic and neutral solutes in a single chromatographic run.

The polar analytes diffuse into a stationary water layer associated with the polar stationary phase and are thus retained. The stronger the interactions between the polar analyte and the polar stationary phase (relative to the mobile phase) the longer the elution time. The interaction strength depends on the functional groups part of the analyte molecular structure, with more polarized groups (&quot;e.g.&quot;, hydroxyl-) and groups capable of hydrogen bonding inducing more retention. Coulombic (electrostatic) interactions can also increase retention. Use of more polar solvents in the mobile phase will decrease the retention time of the analytes, whereas more hydrophobic solvents tend to increase retention times.

===Normal–phase chromatography===

Normal–phase chromatography was one of the first kinds of HPLC that chemists developed, but has decreased in use over the last decades. Also known as normal-phase HPLC (NP-HPLC), this method separates analytes based on their affinity for a polar stationary surface such as silica; hence it is based on analyte ability to engage in polar interactions (such as hydrogen-bonding or dipole-dipole type of interactions) with the sorbent surface. NP-HPLC uses a non-polar, non-aqueous mobile phase (&quot;e.g.&quot;, chloroform), and works effectively for separating analytes readily soluble in non-polar solvents. The analyte associates with and is retained by the polar stationary phase. Adsorption strengths increase with increased analyte polarity. The interaction strength depends not only on the functional groups present in the structure of the analyte molecule, but also on steric factors. The effect of steric hindrance on interaction strength allows this method to resolve (separate) structural isomers.

The use of more polar solvents in the mobile phase will decrease the retention time of analytes, whereas more hydrophobic solvents tend to induce slower elution (increased retention times). Very polar solvents such as traces of water in the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the solid surface of the stationary phase forming a stationary bound (water) layer which is considered to play an active role in retention. This behavior is somewhat peculiar to normal phase chromatography because it is governed almost exclusively by an adsorptive mechanism (&quot;i.e.&quot;, analytes interact with a solid surface rather than with the solvated layer of a ligand attached to the sorbent surface; see also reversed-phase HPLC below). Adsorption chromatography is still somewhat used for structural isomer separations in both column and thin-layer chromatography formats on activated (dried) silica or alumina supports.

Partition- and NP-HPLC fell out of favor in the 1970s with the development of reversed-phase HPLC because of poor reproducibility of retention times due to the presence of a water or protic organic solvent layer on the surface of the silica or alumina chromatographic media. This layer changes with any changes in the composition of the mobile phase (&quot;e.g.&quot;, moisture level) causing drifting retention times.

Recently, partition chromatography has become popular again with the development of Hilic bonded phases which demonstrate improved reproducibility, and due to a better understanding of the range of usefulness of the technique.

===Displacement chromatography===
The use of displacement chromatography is rather limited, and is mostly used for preparative chromatography. The basic principle is based on a molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) which is used to compete effectively for binding sites, and thus displace all molecules with lesser affinities.
There are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired in order to achieve maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than &quot;peaks&quot;. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentration.

===Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC)===


Reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) is the most widespread mode of chromatography. It has a non-polar stationary phase and an aqueous, moderately polar mobile phase. In the reversed phase methods, the substances are retained in the system the more hydrophobic they are. For the retention of organic materials, the stationary phases, packed inside the columns, are consisted mainly of porous granules of silica gel in various shapes, mainly spherical, at different  diameters (1.5, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 um), with varying pore diameters (60, 100, 150, 300, A), on whose surface are chemically bound various hydrocarbon ligands such as C3, C4, C8, C18. There are also polymeric hydrophobic particles that serve as stationary phases, when solutions at extreme pH are needed, or hybrid silica, polymerized with organic substances. The longer the hydrocarbon ligand on the stationary phase, the longer the sample components can be retained. Most of the current methods of separation of biomedical materials use C-18 type of columns, sometimes called by a trade names such as ODS (octadecylsilane) or RP-18 (Reversed Phase 18).

The most common RP stationary phases are based on a silica support, which is surface-modified by bonding RMe2SiCl, where R is a straight chain alkyl group such as C18H37 or C8H17.

With such stationary phases, retention time is longer for lipophylic molecules, whereas polar molecules elute more readily (emerge early in the analysis). A chromatographer can increase retention times by adding more water to the mobile phase, thereby making the interactions of the hydrophobic analyte with the hydrophobic stationary phase relatively stronger. Similarly, an investigator can decrease retention time by adding more organic solvent to the mobile phase. RP-HPLC is so commonly used among the biologists and life science users, therefore it is often incorrectly referred to as just &quot;HPLC&quot; without further specification. The pharmaceutical industry also regularly employs RP-HPLC to qualify drugs before their release.

RP-HPLC operates on the principle of hydrophobic interactions, which originates from the high symmetry in the dipolar water structure and plays the most important role in all processes in life science. RP-HPLC allows the measurement of these interactive forces. The binding of the analyte to the stationary phase is proportional to the contact surface area around the non-polar segment of the analyte molecule upon association with the ligand on the stationary phase. This solvophobic effect is dominated by the force of water for &quot;cavity-reduction&quot; around the analyte and the C18-chain versus the complex of both. The energy released in this process is proportional to the surface tension of the eluent (water: 7.3 J/cm2, methanol: 2.2 J/cm2) and to the hydrophobic surface of the analyte and the ligand respectively. The retention can be decreased by adding a less polar solvent (methanol, acetonitrile) into the mobile phase to reduce the surface tension of water. Gradient elution uses this effect by automatically reducing the polarity and the surface tension of the aqueous mobile phase during the course of the analysis.

Structural properties of the analyte molecule can play an important role in its retention characteristics. In theory, an analyte with a larger hydrophobic surface area (C–H, C–C, and generally non-polar atomic bonds, such as S-S and others) can be retained longer as it does not interact with the water structure. On the other hand, analytes with higher polar surface area (as a result of the presence of polar groups, such as -OH, -NH2, COO− or -NH3+ in their structure) are less retained, as they are better integrated into water. The interactions with the stationary phase can also affected by steric effects, or exclusion effects, whereby a component of very large molecule may have only restricted access to the pores of the stationary phase, where the interactions with surface ligands (alkyl chains) take place. Such surface hindrance typically results in less retention.

Retention time increases with more hydrophobic (non-polar) surface area of the molecules. For example, branched chain compounds can elute more rapidly than their corresponding linear isomers because their overall surface area is lower. Similarly organic compounds with single C–C bonds frequently elute later than those with a C=C or even triple bond, as the double or triple bond makes the molecule more compact than a single C–C bond.

Another important factor is the mobile phase pH since it can change the hydrophobic character of the ionizable analyte. For this reason most methods use a buffering agent, such as sodium phosphate, to control the pH. Buffers serve multiple purposes: control of pH which affects the ionization state of the ionizable analytes, affect the charge upon the ionizable silica surface of the stationary phase in between the bonded phase linands, and in some cases even act as ion pairing agents to neutralize analyte charge. Ammonium formate is commonly added in mass spectrometry to improve detection of certain analytes by the formation of analyte-ammonium adducts. A volatile organic acid such as acetic acid, or most commonly formic acid, is often added to the mobile phase if mass spectrometry is used to analyze the column effluents.

Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as additive to the mobile phase is widely used for complex mixtures of biomedical samples, mostly peptides and proteins, using mostly UV based detectors. They are rarely used in mass spectrometry methods, due to residues it can leave in the detector and solvent delivery system, which interfere with the analysis and detection. However, TFA can be highly effective in improving retention of analytes such as carboxylic acids, in applications utilizing other detectors such as UV-VIS, as it is a fairly strong organic acid. The effects of acids and buffers vary by application but generally improve chromatographic resolution when dealing with ionizable components.

Reversed phase columns are quite difficult to damage compared to normal silica columns, thanks to the shielding effect of the bonded hydrophobic ligands; however, most reversed phase columns consist of alkyl derivatized silica particles, and are prone to hydrolysis of the silica at extreme pH conditions in the mobile phase. Most types of RP columns should &quot;not&quot; be used with aqueous bases as these will hydrolyze the underlying silica particle and dissolve it. There are selected brands of hybrid or enforced silica based particles of RP columns which can be used at extreme pH conditions. The use of extreme acidic conditions is also not recommended, as they also might hydrolyzed as well as corrode the inside walls of the metallic parts of the HPLC equipment.

As a rule, in most cases RP-HPLC columns should be flushed with clean solvent after use to remove residual acids or buffers, and stored in an appropriate composition of solvent. Some biomedical applications require non metallic environment for the optimal separation. For such sensitive cases there is a test for the metal content of a column is to inject a sample which is a mixture of 2,2&#x27;- and 4,4&#x27;-bipyridine. Because the 2,2&#x27;-bipy can chelate the metal, the shape of the peak for the 2,2&#x27;-bipy will be distorted (tailed) when metal ions are present on the surface of the silica...

===Size-exclusion chromatography===

Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) separates polymer molecules and biomolecules based on differences in their molecular size (actually by a particle&#x27;s Stokes radius). The separation process is based on the ability of sample molecules to permeate through the pores of gel spheres, packed inside the column, and is dependent on the relative size of analyte molecules and the respective pore size of the absorbent. The process also relies on the absence of any interactions with the packing material surface.

Two types of SEC are usually termed:

# Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)—separation of synthetic polymers (aqueous or organic soluble). GPC is a powerful technique for polymer characterization using primarily organic solvents.
# Gel filtration chromatography (GFC)—separation of water-soluble biopolymers. GFC uses primarily aqueous solvents (typically for aqueous soluble biopolymers, such as proteins, etc.).

The separation principle in SEC is based on the fully, or partially penetrating of the high molecular weight substances of the sample into the porous stationary-phase particles during their transport through column. The mobile-phase eluent is selected in such a way that it totally prevents interactions with the stationary phase&#x27;s surface. Under these conditions, the smaller the size of the molecule, the more it is able to penetrate inside the pore space and the movement through the column takes longer. On the other hand, the bigger the molecular size, the higher the probability the molecule will not fully penetrate the pores of the stationary phase, and even travel around them, thus, will be eluted earlier. The molecules are separated in order of decreasing molecular weight, with the largest molecules eluting from the column first and smaller molecules eluting later. Molecules larger than the pore size do not enter the pores at all, and elute together as the first peak in the chromatogram and this is called total exclusion volume which defines the exclusion limit for a particular column. Small molecules will permeate fully through the pores of the stationary phase particles and will be eluted last, marking the end of the chromatogram, and may appear as a total penetration marker.

In biomedical sciences it is generally considered as a low resolution chromatography and thus it is often reserved for the final, &quot;polishing&quot; step of the purification. It is also useful for determining the tertiary structure and quaternary structure of purified proteins. SEC is used primarily for the analysis of large molecules such as proteins or polymers. SEC works also in a preparative way by trapping the smaller molecules in the pores of a particles. The larger molecules simply pass by the pores as they are too large to enter the pores. Larger molecules therefore flow through the column quicker than smaller molecules: that is, the smaller the molecule, the longer the retention time.

This technique is widely used for the molecular weight determination of polysaccharides. SEC is the official technique (suggested by European pharmacopeia) for the molecular weight comparison of different commercially available low-molecular weight heparins.

===Ion-exchange chromatography===

Ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) or ion chromatography (IC) is an analytical technique for the separation and determination of ionic solutes in aqueous samples from environmental and industrial origins such as metal industry, industrial waste water, in biological systems, pharmaceutical samples, food, etc. Retention is based on the attraction between solute ions and charged sites bound to the stationary phase. Solute ions charged the same as the ions on the column are repulsed and elute without retention, while solute ions charged oppositely to the charged sites of the column are retained on it. Solute ions that are retained on the column can be eluted from it by changing the mobile phase composition, such as increasing its salt concentration and pH or increasing the column temperature, etc.

Types of ion exchangers include polystyrene resins, cellulose and dextran ion exchangers (gels), and controlled-pore glass or porous silica gel. Polystyrene resins allow cross linkage, which increases the stability of the chain. Higher cross linkage reduces swerving, which increases the equilibration time and ultimately improves selectivity. Cellulose and dextran ion exchangers possess larger pore sizes and low charge densities making them suitable for protein separation.

In general, ion exchangers favor the binding of ions of higher charge and smaller radius.

An increase in counter ion (with respect to the functional groups in resins) concentration reduces the retention time, as it creates a strong competition with the solute ions. A decrease in pH reduces the retention time in cation exchange while an increase in pH reduces the retention time in anion exchange. By lowering the pH of the solvent in a cation exchange column, for instance, more hydrogen ions are available to compete for positions on the anionic stationary phase, thereby eluting weakly bound cations.

This form of chromatography is widely used in the following applications: water purification, preconcentration of trace components, ligand-exchange chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography of proteins, high-pH anion-exchange chromatography of carbohydrates and oligosaccharides, and others.

===Bioaffinity chromatography===

High performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) works by passing a sample solution through a column packed with a stationary phase that contains an immobilized biologically active ligand. The ligand is in fact a substrate that has a specific binding affinity for the target molecule in the sample solution. The target molecule binds to the ligand, while the other molecules in the sample solution pass through the column, having little or no retention. The target molecule is then eluted from the column using a suitable elution buffer.

This chromatographic process relies on the capability of the bonded active substances to form stable, specific, and reversible complexes thanks to their biological recognition of certain specific sample components. The formation of these complexes involves the participation of common molecular forces such as the Van der Waals interaction, electrostatic interaction, dipole-dipole interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and the hydrogen bond. An efficient, biospecific bond is formed by a simultaneous and concerted action of several of these forces in the complementary binding sites.

=== Aqueous normal-phase chromatography ===
Aqueous normal-phase chromatography (ANP) is also called hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). This is a chromatographic technique which encompasses the mobile phase region between reversed-phase chromatography (RP) and organic normal phase chromatography (ONP). HILIC is used to achieve unique selectivity for hydrophilic compounds, showing normal phase elution order, using &quot;reversed-phase solvents&quot;, i.e., relatively polar mostly non-aqueous solvents in the mobile phase. Many biological molecules, especially those found in biological fluids, are small polar compounds that do not retain well by reversed phase-HPLC. This has made hydrophilic interaction LC (HILIC) an attractive alternative and useful approach for analysis of polar molecules. Additionally, because HILIC is routinely used with traditional aqueous mixtures with polar organic solvents such as ACN and methanol, it can be easily coupled to MS.

==Isocratic and gradient elution==

A separation in which the mobile phase composition remains constant throughout the procedure is termed &quot;isocratic&quot; (meaning &quot;constant composition&quot;). The word was coined by Csaba Horvath who was one of the pioneers of HPLC.

The mobile phase composition does not have to remain constant. A separation in which the mobile phase composition is changed during the separation process is described as a &quot;gradient elution&quot;. For example, a gradient can start at 10% methanol in water, and end at 90% methanol in water after 20 minutes. The two components of the mobile phase are typically termed &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;; &quot;A&quot; is the &quot;weak&quot; solvent which allows the solute to elute only slowly, while &quot;B&quot; is the &quot;strong&quot; solvent which rapidly elutes the solutes from the column. In reversed-phase chromatography, solvent &quot;A&quot; is often water or an aqueous buffer, while &quot;B&quot; is an organic solvent miscible with water, such as acetonitrile, methanol, THF, or isopropanol.

In isocratic elution, peak width increases with retention time linearly according to the equation for N, the number of theoretical plates. This can be a major disadvantage when analyzing a sample that contains analytes with a wide range of retention factors. Using a weaker mobile phase, the runtime is lengthened and results in slowly eluting peaks to be broad, leading to reduced sensitivity. A stronger mobile phase would improve issues of runtime and broadening of later peaks but results in diminished peak separation, especially for quickly eluting analytes which may have insufficient time to fully resolve. This issue is addressed through the changing mobile phase composition of gradient elution.

By starting from a weaker mobile phase and strengthening it during the runtime, gradient elution decreases the retention of the later-eluting components so that they elute faster, giving narrower (and taller) peaks for most components, while also allowing for the adequate separation of earlier-eluting components. This also improves the peak shape for tailed peaks, as the increasing concentration of the organic eluent pushes the tailing part of a peak forward. This also increases the peak height (the peak looks &quot;sharper&quot;), which is important in trace analysis. The gradient program may include sudden &quot;step&quot; increases in the percentage of the organic component, or different slopes at different times – all according to the desire for optimum separation in minimum time.

In isocratic elution, the retention order does not change if the column dimensions (length and inner diameter) change – that is, the peaks elute in the same order. In gradient elution, however, the elution order may change as the dimensions or flow rate change. if they are no scaled down or up according to the change

The driving force in reversed phase chromatography originates in the high order of the water structure. The role of the &quot;organic component of the mobile phase&quot; is to reduce this high order and thus &quot;reduce the retarding strength of the aqueous component.&quot;

==Parameters==
===Theoretical===
The theory of high performance liquid chromatography-HPLC is, at its core, the same as general chromatography theory. This theory has been used as the basis for &quot;system-suitability&quot; tests, as can be seen in the USP Pharmacopeia, which are a set of quantitative criteria, which test the suitability of the HPLC system to the required analysis at any step of it.

This relation is also represented as a normalized unit-less factor known as the &quot;retention factor&quot;, or retention parameter, which is the experimental measurement of the capacity ratio, as shown in the Figure of Performance Criteria as well. tR is the retention time of the specific component and t0 is the time it takes for a non-retained substance to elute through the system without any retention, thus it is called the Void Time.

The ratio between the retention factors, k&#x27;, of every two adjacent peaks in the chromatogram is used in the evaluation of the degree of separation between them, and is called selectivity factor, α, as shown in the Performance Criteria graph.

The plate count N as a criterion for system efficiency was developed for isocratic conditions, i.e., a constant mobile phase composition throughout the run. In gradient conditions, where the mobile phase changes with time during the chromatographic run, it is more appropriate to use the parameter &quot;peak capacity&quot; &quot;P&quot;c as a measure for the system efficiency. The definition of &quot;peak capacity&quot; in chromatography is the number of peaks that can be separated within a retention window for a specific pre-defined resolution factor, usually ~1. It could also be envisioned as the runtime measured in number of peaks&#x27; average widths. The equation is shown in the Figure of the performance criteria. In this equation tg is the gradient time and w(ave) is the average peaks width at the base.
The parameters are largely derived from two sets of chromatographic theory: plate theory (as part of partition chromatography), and the rate theory of chromatography / &quot;Van Deemter equation&quot;. Of course, they can be put in practice through analysis of HPLC chromatograms, although rate theory is considered the more accurate theory.

They are analogous to the calculation of retention factor for a paper chromatography separation, but describes how well HPLC separates a mixture into two or more components that are detected as peaks (bands) on a chromatogram. The HPLC parameters are the: efficiency factor(&quot;N&quot;), the retention factor (kappa prime), and the separation factor (alpha). Together the factors are variables in a resolution equation, which describes how well two components&#x27; peaks separated or overlapped each other. These parameters are mostly only used for describing HPLC reversed phase and HPLC normal phase separations, since those separations tend to be more subtle than other HPLC modes (&quot;e.g.&quot;, ion exchange and size exclusion).

Void volume is the amount of space in a column that is occupied by solvent. It is the space within the column that is outside of the column&#x27;s internal packing material. Void volume is measured on a chromatogram as the first component peak detected, which is usually the solvent that was present in the sample mixture; ideally the sample solvent flows through the column without interacting with the column, but is still detectable as distinct from the HPLC solvent. The void volume is used as a correction factor.

Efficiency factor (&quot;N&quot;) practically measures how sharp component peaks on the chromatogram are, as ratio of the component peak&#x27;s area (&quot;retention time&quot;) relative to the width of the peaks at their widest point (at the baseline). Peaks that are tall, sharp, and relatively narrow indicate that separation method efficiently removed a component from a mixture; high efficiency. Efficiency is very dependent upon the HPLC column and the HPLC method used. Efficiency factor is synonymous with plate number, and the &#x27;number of theoretical plates&#x27;.

Retention factor (&quot;kappa prime&quot;) measures how long a component of the mixture stuck to the column, measured by the area under the curve of its peak in a chromatogram (since HPLC chromatograms are a function of time). Each chromatogram peak will have its own retention factor (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;kappa&quot; for the retention factor of the first peak). This factor may be corrected for by the void volume of the column.

Separation factor (&quot;alpha&quot;) is a relative comparison on how well two neighboring components of the mixture were separated (&quot;i.e.&quot;, two neighboring bands on a chromatogram). This factor is defined in terms of a ratio of the retention factors of a pair of neighboring chromatogram peaks, and may also be corrected for by the void volume of the column. The greater the separation factor value is over 1.0, the better the separation, until about 2.0 beyond which an HPLC method is probably not needed for separation.
Resolution equations relate the three factors such that high efficiency and separation factors improve the resolution of component peaks in an HPLC separation.

===Internal diameter===

The internal diameter (ID) of an HPLC column is an important parameter. It can influence the detection response when reduced due to the reduced lateral diffusion of the solute band. It can also affect the separation selectivity, when flow rate and injection volumes are not scaled down or up proportionally to the smaller or larger diameter used, both in the isocratic and in gradient modes. It determines the quantity of analyte that can be loaded onto the column. Larger diameter columns are usually seen in preparative applications, such as the purification of a drug product for later use. Low-ID columns have improved sensitivity and lower solvent consumption in the recent ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC).

Larger ID columns (over 10 mm) are used to purify usable amounts of material because of their large loading capacity.

Analytical scale columns (4.6 mm) have been the most common type of columns, though narrower columns are rapidly gaining in popularity. They are used in traditional quantitative analysis of samples and often use a UV-Vis absorbance detector.

Narrow-bore columns (1–2 mm) are used for applications when more sensitivity is desired either with special UV-vis detectors, fluorescence detection or with other detection methods like liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry

Capillary columns (under 0.3 mm) are used almost exclusively with alternative detection means such as mass spectrometry. They are usually made from fused silica capillaries, rather than the stainless steel tubing that larger columns employ.

===Particle size===
Most traditional HPLC is performed with the stationary phase attached to the outside of small spherical silica particles (very small beads). These particles come in a variety of sizes with 5 μm beads being the most common. Smaller particles generally provide more surface area and better separations, but the pressure required for optimum linear velocity increases by the inverse of the particle diameter squared.

According to the equations of the column velocity, efficiency and backpressure, reducing the particle diameter by half and keeping the size of the column the same, will double the column velocity and efficiency; but four times increase the backpressure. And the small particles HPLC also can decrease the width broadening. Larger particles are used in preparative HPLC (column diameters 5 cm up to &gt;30 cm) and for non-HPLC applications such as solid-phase extraction.

===Pore size===
Many stationary phases are porous to provide greater surface area. Small pores provide greater surface area while larger pore size has better kinetics, especially for larger analytes. For example, a protein which is only slightly smaller than a pore might enter the pore but does not easily leave once inside.

===Pump pressure===
Pumps vary in pressure capacity, but their performance is measured on their ability to yield a consistent and reproducible volumetric flow rate. Pressure may reach as high as 60 MPa (6000 lbf/in2), or about 600 atmospheres. Modern HPLC systems have been improved to work at much higher pressures, and therefore are able to use much smaller particle sizes in the columns (&lt;2 μm). These &quot;ultra high performance liquid chromatography&quot; systems or UHPLCs, which could also be known as ultra high pressure chromatography systems, can work at up to 120 MPa (17,405 lbf/in2), or about 1200 atmospheres. The term &quot;UPLC&quot; is a trademark of the Waters Corporation, but is sometimes used to refer to the more general technique of UHPLC.

===Detectors===
HPLC detectors fall into two main categories: universal or selective. Universal detectors typically measure a bulk property (&quot;e.g.&quot;, refractive index) by measuring a difference of a physical property between the mobile phase and mobile phase with solute while selective detectors measure a solute property (&quot;e.g.&quot;, UV-Vis absorbance) by simply responding to the physical or chemical property of the solute. HPLC most commonly uses a UV-Vis absorbance detector; however, a wide range of other chromatography detectors can be used. A universal detector that complements UV-Vis absorbance detection is the charged aerosol detector (CAD). A kind of commonly utilized detector includes refractive index detectors, which provide readings by measuring the changes in the refractive index of the eluant as it moves through the flow cell. In certain cases, it is possible to use multiple detectors, for example LCMS normally combines UV-Vis with a mass spectrometer.

When used with an electrochemical detector (ECD) the HPLC-ECD selectively detects neurotransmitters such as: norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine and others in neurochemical analysis research applications. The HPLC-ECD detects neurotransmitters to the femtomolar range. Other methods to detect neurotransmitters include liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, ELISA, or radioimmunoassays.

===Autosamplers===
Large numbers of samples can be automatically injected onto an HPLC system, by the use of HPLC autosamplers. In addition, HPLC autosamplers have an injection volume and technique which is exactly the same for each injection, consequently they provide a high degree of injection volume precision.
It is possible to enable sample stirring within the sampling-chamber, thus promoting homogeneity.

== Applications ==

=== Manufacturing ===
HPLC has many applications in both laboratory and clinical science. It is a common technique used in pharmaceutical development, as it is a dependable way to obtain and ensure product purity. While HPLC can produce extremely high quality (pure) products, it is not always the primary method used in the production of bulk drug materials. According to the European pharmacopoeia, HPLC is used in only 15.5% of syntheses. However, it plays a role in 44% of syntheses in the United States pharmacopoeia. This could possibly be due to differences in monetary and time constraints, as HPLC on a large scale can be an expensive technique. An increase in specificity, precision, and accuracy that occurs with HPLC unfortunately corresponds to an increase in cost.

=== Legal ===
This technique is also used for detection of illicit drugs in various samples. The most common method of drug detection has been an immunoassay. This method is much more convenient. However, convenience comes at the cost of specificity and coverage of a wide range of drugs, therefore, HPLC has been used as well as an alternative method. As HPLC is a method of determining (and possibly increasing) purity, using HPLC alone in evaluating concentrations of drugs was somewhat insufficient. Therefore, HPLC in this context is often performed in conjunction with mass spectrometry. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) instead of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) circumvents the necessity for derivitizing with acetylating or alkylation agents, which can be a burdensome extra step. LC-MS has been used to detect a variety of agents like doping agents, drug metabolites, glucuronide conjugates, amphetamines, opioids, cocaine, BZDs, ketamine, LSD, cannabis, and pesticides. Performing HPLC in conjunction with mass spectrometry reduces the absolute need for standardizing HPLC experimental runs.

=== Research ===
Similar assays can be performed for research purposes, detecting concentrations of potential clinical candidates like anti-fungal and asthma drugs. This technique is obviously useful in observing multiple species in collected samples, as well, but requires the use of standard solutions when information about species identity is sought out. It is used as a method to confirm results of synthesis reactions, as purity is essential in this type of research. However, mass spectrometry is still the more reliable way to identify species.

=== Medical and health sciences ===
Medical use of HPLC typically use mass spectrometer (MS) as the detector, so the technique is called LC-MS or LC-MS/MS for tandem MS, where two types of MS are operated sequentially. When the HPLC instrument is connected to more than one detector, it is called a hyphenated LC system. Pharmaceutical applications are the major users of HPLC, LC-MS and LC-MS/MS. This includes drug development and pharmacology, which is the scientific study of the effects of drugs and chemicals on living organisms, personalized medicine, public health and diagnostics. While urine is the most common medium for analyzing drug concentrations, blood serum is the sample collected for most medical analyses with HPLC. One of the most important roles of LC-MS and LC-MS/MS in the clinical lab is the Newborn Screening (NBS) for metabolic disorders and follow-up diagnostics. The infants&#x27; samples come in the shape of dried blood spot (DBS), which is simple to prepare and transport, enabling safe and accessible diagnostics, both locally and globally.

Other methods of detection of molecules that are useful for clinical studies have been tested against HPLC, namely immunoassays. In one example of this, competitive protein binding assays (CPBA) and HPLC were compared for sensitivity in detection of vitamin D. Useful for diagnosing vitamin D deficiencies in children, it was found that sensitivity and specificity of this CPBA reached only 40% and 60%, respectively, of the capacity of HPLC. While an expensive tool, the accuracy of HPLC is nearly unparalleled.

<doc id="168652" wikidata="Q1144784" url="?curid=168652" title="Véhicule Automatique Léger">
<text>Véhicule Automatique Léger () or VAL is a type of driverless (automated), rubber-tyred, medium-capacity rail transport system (people mover). The technology was developed at the Lille University of Science and Technology, was marketed by Matra, and first used in the early 1980s for the Lille Metro system, one of the world&#x27;s first fully automated mass-transit rail networks, preceded only by the Port Island Line in Kobe, Japan. The VAL technology is now marketed by Siemens, which acquired Matra in the late 1990s.

A total of 11 lines in 8 systems based on the VAL technology are currently in operation worldwide. The current version of the VAL product is marketed as NeoVal (with a distinction between AirVal for airport environments and CityVal for more conventional transit environments).

The name is a backronym, with the first project to use the technology nicknamed VAL after the routing of the line: &quot;Villeneuve d&#x27;Ascq à Lille&quot; ().

== Technology ==
=== Original VAL ===

The VAL system uses a fully automated elevated guideway, which may be metal or concrete depending on prevailing weather conditions. Primary suspension is by rubber tires, with pairs of horizontal tires to provide lateral guidance. Electrical power at 750 V DC is collected by shoes from the guidebars.

The vehicles are lightweight 2-car sets (VAL 206 or VAL 208) with 124 total capacity, or twin sets (VAL 256) with 80 seated and 160 standing capacity. All axles on these vehicles are motored with electrical motors. The system detects the location of trains on the guideway by the use of ultrasonic sensors. VAL uses fixed-block signalling.

VAL can cope with unanticipated demand by inserting additional trains into the network as required by remote command from the control center. The control center computer system automatically speeds up or slows down trains in order to maintain a timetable. The VAL system can handle headways as small as 60 seconds, and the Lille VAL system rapidly proved itself with a 99.8% availability.

In contrast to another early driverless metro system, the Vancouver SkyTrain, the VAL design uses platforms that are separated from the rollways by a glass partition, to prevent waiting passengers from straying or falling onto the rollways. Platform screen doors – produced by Swiss glass door manufacturer Kaba Gilgen AG – are embedded in these partitions and open in synchrony with the train doors when a train stops at the platform. The original platform-edge doors were manufactured and installed by PLC Peters in Hayes, Middlesex and were used on the first line.

In addition to the trains being driverless, the station platforms are unstaffed in normal operation. In the original Lille metro system, they are monitored by a large closed-circuit television system with 330 cameras and 24 television monitors in a remote control room.
=== NeoVal ===

In 2006 the NeoVal project, successor of the VAL, was announced. It features regenerative braking. 40% of the 62 million Euros set aside for the programme will come from the &quot;Agence de l&#x27;innovation industrielle&quot; (the technology-supporting project agency formerly known as the AII). The program is managed by Siemens Mobility, in association with Lohr Industrie. The NeoVal will be guided by a single central rail, similar to that of the Translohr, and will be able to operate without any electrical supply between the stations (no third rail or overhead lines), making the cost of infrastructure much lower.

The NeoVal is offered in two versions:
* the CityVal version designed for conventional transit environments (car width ) with the first implementation on Line B of the Rennes Metro; 
* the AirVal version designed for airport environments (car width ) with the first implementation on the Suvarnabhumi Airport Automated People Mover at Suvarnabhumi Airport, Thailand.

== VAL systems ==
=== Active systems ===
 there are a total of 12 lines in 8 systems operating with VAL technology:
* Lille Metro (two lines), since 1983, VAL 206 and VAL 208 cars
* Paris Orlyval, since 1991, VAL 206 cars
* Toulouse Metro (two lines), since 1993, VAL 206 and VAL 208 cars
* Taipei Metro Wenhu (Brown) line, since 1996, larger VAL 256 cars using the MAGGALY technology from Lyon Metro Line D and Bombardier signaling
* Rennes Metro (two lines), since 2002, VAL 208 and CityVal cars
* Turin Metro, since 2006, VAL 208 cars
* Paris CDGVAL (two lines), since 2007, VAL 208 cars
* Uijeongbu U Line, since 2012, VAL 208 cars with air conditioning, locally designated the U100
* Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport, since 2023 - 6 2-car AirVal trains

=== Future systems ===
* Frankfurt Airport SkyLine (rehabilitation of existing people mover system) - 24 2-car AirVal trains

=== Defunct systems ===
*Airport Transit System at Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport (opened in 1993 and replaced by a Bombardier system in 2019 and reopened in 2021)
*Jacksonville, Florida, had a VAL line inaugurated in 1989; it was shut down in December 1996 and replaced by a monorail, the Jacksonville Skyway. The rolling stock was sold to O&#x27;Hare.
== Medium-Capacity Transport System ==
When VAL was introduced to Taipei, the term medium-capacity rail transport system was coined by railway planners to differentiate VAL from heavy rail (metro). Since then, this term has begun to be applied on similar capacity transit systems–mainly in Asian cities–even when the systems are not based on VAL&#x27;s technology. On Siemens&#x27; official website, VAL was during a certain time advertised as the &quot;first fully automated light metro&quot;, in which the term &quot;light metro&quot; can be traced back to the Moscow Metro&#x27;s Butovskaya Line. Siemens now rather uses the terms &quot;medium-capacity metro&quot; or simply refers to VAL as a &quot;people mover&quot;.

<doc id="168654" wikidata="Q2613704" url="?curid=168654" title="Phil Gramm">
<text>William Philip Gramm (born July 8, 1942) is an American economist and politician who represented Texas in both chambers of Congress. Though he began his political career as a Democrat, Gramm switched to the Republican Party in 1983. Gramm was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries against eventual nominee Bob Dole.

== Early life education ==
Gramm was born on July 8, 1942, in Fort Benning, Georgia, and grew up in nearby Columbus.
Soon after his birth, Gramm&#x27;s father, Kenneth Marsh Gramm, a career Army sergeant, suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed. He died when Gramm was 14. Gramm&#x27;s mother, Florence (née Scroggins), worked double shifts as a nurse to supplement the veterans disability pension.

Gramm attended public schools, graduated in 1961 from Georgia Military Academy (now Woodward Academy), and graduated in 1964 from the University of Georgia. He received a doctorate in economics from the University of Georgia&#x27;s Terry College of Business in 1967.

== Career ==
Gramm taught economics at Texas A&amp;M University from 1967 to 1978. In addition to teaching, Gramm founded the economic consulting firm Gramm and Associates (1971–1978).

===United States House of Representatives===
In 1976, Gramm unsuccessfully challenged Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, in the party&#x27;s senatorial primary. Then in 1978 Gramm successfully ran as a Democrat for Representative from Texas&#x27;s 6th congressional district, which stretched from the Fort Worth suburbs to College Station. He was reelected to his House seat as a Democrat in 1980.

Gramm&#x27;s voting record was very conservative, even by Texas Democratic standards of the time. During his first four terms, he tallied an average rating of 89 from the American Conservative Union, and from 1980 to 1982 he garnered the highest rating from that body of any Democrat in the Texas delegation. In 1981, he co-sponsored the Gramm-Latta Budget which implemented President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s economic program, increased military spending, cut other spending, and mandated the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (the Kemp-Roth Tax Cut).

Just days after being reelected in 1982, Gramm was thrown off the House Budget Committee. In response, Gramm resigned his House seat on January 5, 1983. He then ran as a Republican for his own vacancy in a February 12, 1983 special election, and won easily. One of his many special election opponents was the second-place finisher by only 115 votes in his 1978 Democratic Party primary, the then newly elected State Senator Chet Edwards of Waco, and later U.S. Representative for the 11th and the 17th congressional districts of Texas (January 3, 1991 – January 3, 2011). Another special election opponent was Texas State Representative Dan Kubiak of Rockdale, Texas. Gramm became the first Republican to represent the district since its creation in 1846.

After he left the House, the seat was retained for the Republican Party by Joe Barton.

===United States Senate===
In 1984, Gramm was elected as a Republican to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate. He defeated Congressman Ron Paul, former gubernatorial nominee Henry Grover, Robert Mosbacher, Jr., of Houston, and several of other contenders in the primary. He then faced the Democratic nominee, State Senator Lloyd Doggett of Austin in the general election for the right to succeed retiring Republican Senator John G. Tower. Gramm polled 3,116,348 votes (58.5 percent) to Doggett&#x27;s 2,207,557 (41.5 percent). Gramm was the first U.S. Senate candidate in the history of Texas to receive more than three million votes.

In October 1985, Gramm, Fritz Hollings, and Warren Rudman sponsored an amendment to establish a budget deficits ceiling that would decline to zero by 1991 that was attached to a bill raising the debt limit of the federal government by more than $250 billion. The amendment was approved by a vote of 75 to 24 and was stated as a possible prelude to a balanced budget in five years without a tax increase by United States Secretary of the Treasury James Baker: &quot;I think it&#x27;s important that we recognize the Gramm-Rudman amendment is basically a process designed to give the legislative branch and in some degree the executive branch, the political will to deal with the deficit. It means it&#x27;s going to force some action. Given the political will to make the hard choices you can reach balance without having to raise taxes.&quot;

Gramm served on the Senate Budget Committee from 1989 until leaving office in 2002. Gramm and Senators Fritz Hollings and Warren Rudman devised a means of cutting the budget through across-the-board spending cuts if deficit-reduction targets were not met. They were successful in making the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Act law, although portions were ruled unconstitutional. In the years following the passage of the Act, other sections were largely superseded by other budget-controlling mechanisms.

In 1990, Gramm failed in an effort to amend the Iraq International Law Compliance Act of 1990. An earlier amendment to the act, the D&#x27;Amato Amendment, prohibited the US from selling arms or extending any sort of financial assistance to Iraq unless the President could prove Iraq was in &quot;substantial compliance&quot; with the provisions of a number of human rights conventions, including the Genocide Convention. After reading the D&#x27;Amato Amendment, Gramm introduced his own amendment to counter the human rights sanctions in the D&#x27;Amato Amendment. Gramm&#x27;s amendment would have allowed the George Bush administration to waive the terms of the D&#x27;Amato Amendment if it found that sanctions against Iraq hurt US businesses and farms more than they hurt Iraq. In the end, the bill passed the Senate without Gramm&#x27;s amendment only a week before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.

Gramm won his second Senate term in 1990 with a victory over Democratic State Senator and former Fort Worth Mayor Hugh Parmer. Gramm polled 3,027,680 votes (60.2 percent) to Parmer&#x27;s 1,429,986 (37.4 percent), again receiving more than three million votes.

Between 1999 and 2001, Gramm was the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. During that time he spearheaded efforts to pass banking deregulation laws, including the landmark Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act in 1999, which removed Depression-era laws separating banking, insurance, and brokerage activities.

As a senator, Gramm often called for reductions in taxes and fraud in government spending. He employed his &quot;Dickey Flatt Test&quot; (&quot;Is it worth taking it out of Dickey&#x27;s pocket?&quot;) to determine if federal programs were worthwhile. Richard &quot;Dickey&quot; Flatt owns a family-run printing business started by his father and mother in Mexia, Texas, and is a longtime Gramm supporter&quot;. In Gramm&#x27;s eyes, Flatt embodied the burdens that a typical Texas independent small businessman faced in the realm of taxation and government spending.

In spite of his self-proclaimed opposition to Federal spending, Gramm voted to have the Federal Government build the Superconducting Super Collider in his state, which would have cost billions of dollars of taxpayer money.

Gramm ran unsuccessfully for the Republican Party nomination in the 1996 presidential election, for which he had raised $8 million as early as July 1994. Although he began the race with a full war-chest and tied for first place with Dole in the 1995 Iowa Straw Poll, his campaign was fatally wounded In 1995 when the scandal broke out that he had previously invested in the porn movies industry, which led the New York Post to nickname him &quot;Porno-Gramm&quot;. Consequently, he lost the Louisiana Caucus on February 7, 1996, to Pat Buchanan (the final delegate count was 13–8). &quot;New Orleans Times Picayune&quot; political columnist Otis Pike noted the loss could be traced to the passion of the supporters for Buchanan compared to those for Gramm. &quot;Gramm should have won the Louisiana caucuses – but didn&#x27;t, because the religious right turned out to vote in larger numbers.&quot; At least part of this was because James Dobson infamously said, &quot;I walked into that meeting fully expecting to support Phil Gramm for President. Now I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d vote for him if he was the last man standing.&quot; This poor showing in a state adjacent to Texas plus placing 5th in Iowa&#x27;s caucuses resulted in Gramm&#x27;s withdrawal from the contest on the Sunday before the New Hampshire primary. He threw his support to a senatorial colleague Robert J. Dole of Kansas. Gramm, a proponent of free trade, also lashed out at Buchanan, arguing that Buchanan was a &quot;protectionist&quot;.

After abandoning his presidential bid, Gramm refocused on his bid for a third Senate term. He defeated Victor Morales of Dallas in November 1996 to win what would be his final term in the Senate.

Gramm was one of five co-sponsors of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. One provision of the bill is often referred to as the &quot;Enron loophole&quot; because some critics blame the provision for permitting the Enron scandal to occur. Wendy Gramm was an Enron Board member and her husband was the second-largest recipient of campaign contributions from Enron, succeeded in legislating California&#x27;s energy commodity trading deregulation. Despite warnings from prominent consumer groups which stated that this law would give energy traders too much influence over energy commodity prices, the legislation was passed in December 2000.

In 2002, Gramm left his Senate seat (effective November 30) a few weeks before the expiration of his term in hopes that his successor, fellow Republican John Cornyn, could gain seniority over other newly elected senators.
However, Cornyn did not gain additional seniority due to a 1980 Rules Committee policy.

====2007 mortgage and 2008 financial and economic crises====

Some economists state that the 1999 legislation spearheaded by Gramm and signed into law by President Clinton—the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act—was significantly to blame for the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis and 2008 global economic crisis. The Act is most widely known for repealing portions of the Glass–Steagall Act, which had regulated the financial services industry. The Act passed the House and Senate by an overwhelming majority on November 4, 1999.

Gramm responded in March 2008 to criticism of the act by stating that he saw &quot;no evidence whatsoever&quot; that the sub-prime mortgage crisis was caused in any way &quot;by allowing banks and securities companies and insurance companies to compete against each other&quot;.

Gramm&#x27;s support was later critical in the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, which kept derivatives transactions, including those involving credit default swaps, free of government regulation.

In its 2008 coverage of the financial crisis, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; named Gramm one of seven &quot;Key Players In the Battle Over Regulating Derivatives&quot;, for having &quot;pushed through several major bills to deregulate the banking and investment industries, including the 1999 Gramm–Leach–Bliley act that brought down the walls separating the commercial banking, investment and insurance industries&quot;.

2008 Nobel Laureate in Economics Paul Krugman, a supporter of Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton, described Gramm during the 2008 presidential race as &quot;the high priest of deregulation,&quot; and has listed him as the number two person responsible for the economic crisis of 2008 behind only Alan Greenspan. On October 14, 2008, CNN ranked Gramm number seven in its list of the 10 individuals most responsible for the current economic crisis.

In January 2009 &quot;Guardian&quot; City editor Julia Finch identified Gramm as one of twenty-five people who were at the heart of the financial meltdown. &quot;Time&quot; included Gramm in its list of the top 25 people to blame for the economic crisis.

===Career with UBS===
As of 2009, Gramm is employed by UBS AG as a vice chairman of the Investment Bank division.
UBS.com states that a vice chairman of a UBS division is &quot;...appointed to support the business in their relationships with key clients.&quot; He joined UBS in 2002 immediately after retiring from the Senate.

===John McCain 2008 presidential campaign===
Gramm was co-chair of John McCain&#x27;s presidential campaign and his most senior economic adviser from the summer of 2007 until July 18, 2008.
In a July 9, 2008 interview on McCain&#x27;s economic plans, Gramm explained the nation was not in a recession, stating, &quot;You&#x27;ve heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession.&quot;
He added, &quot;We have sort of become a nation of whiners, you just hear this constant whining, complaining about a loss of competitiveness, America in decline.&quot;
Gramm&#x27;s comments immediately became a campaign issue.
McCain&#x27;s opponent, Senator Barack Obama, stated, &quot;America already has one Dr. Phil. We don&#x27;t need another one when it comes to the economy. ... This economic downturn is not in your head.&quot;
McCain strongly denounced Gramm&#x27;s comments.
On July 18, 2008, Gramm stepped down from his position with the McCain campaign.
Explaining his remarks, Gramm stated that he had used the word &quot;whiners&quot; to describe the nation&#x27;s politicians rather than the public, stating &quot;the whiners are the leaders.&quot;
In the same interview, Gramm said, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to retract any of it. Every word I said was true.&quot;

===2016 Republican presidential primary===
After the Iowa Caucus, Gramm referred to the 2016 presidential election cycle as &quot;scary&quot;. He said of Donald Trump, &quot;I&#x27;ll have to admit I don&#x27;t find Trump much more reassuring&quot; than Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders &quot;in terms of economic policy&quot;, but did not believe Trump would be the nominee. Gramm endorsed U.S. Senator Marco Rubio in the 2016 Republican presidential primary stating: &quot;He&#x27;s the best prepared on national security. He can win the general election.&quot; Upon Rubio&#x27;s withdrawal from the race, Gramm endorsed fellow Texan Ted Cruz, calling him &quot;a fearless leader and fighter for conservatives all over the country&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gramm lives in Helotes, Texas. He is married to Wendy Lee Gramm, a native of Hawaii, who is associated with George Mason University&#x27;s Mercatus Center in Virginia. They have two sons: Marshall Gramm, a professor of economics at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, and Jeff Gramm, a money manager, author, and previously a musician in the indie pop band Aden. Gramm is an Episcopalian.

After the 1999 Aggie Bonfire collapse, Gramm offered the F-16 flyover reserved for his future funeral as a U.S. senator to be given instead to the Texas A&amp;M community. The offer was accepted and a memorial flyover for the 12 killed was flown at a Texas A&amp;M football game on November 26, 1999.

<text>The Polly Klaas Foundation is a 501(c)(3) public charity organization devoted to preventing crimes against children, assisting in the recovery of missing children, and lobbying for legislative assistance. The foundation was formed October 23, 1993, to search for Polly Klaas. Its executive director is Robert De Leo. It has expanded its mission and now searches for many missing children.

The Polly Klaas Foundation also provides kits for parents to teach abduction prevention in a way that they state is not frightening for children. It distributes over 100,000 of these kits per year.

The Polly Klaas Foundation worked with Convio to send targeted letters to state and federal officials to implement Amber Alerts in all 50 states.

Polly&#x27;s father, Marc, is not associated with this foundation. However, her mother, Eve Nichol, serves on the board.

==History==
The Polly Klaas Foundation was created initially to search for Polly Klaas. After two years, the executive director, Gary Kinley, resigned with no explanation, and there was an analysis of financial problems in 1996. The Polly Klaas Foundation has since recovered and has drastically increased its operating budget.

The Polly Klaas Foundation receives the majority of its donations via donated cars, through a partnership with Harvard Palmer Jr.&#x27;s Vehicle Donation Processing Center.

On November 19 1993 a 32 year old woman filed a civil suit against Polly Klaas Foundation president Bill Rhodes, claiming he had molested her over a period of 6 months 24 years ago. Rhodes was previously convicted of masturbating in front of several young girls in 1967 and acquitted of molesting 4 Santa Clara girls at knife point in 1968. He claimed his role in the foundation was to &quot;make amends&quot; for his past. Rhodes stepped down on November 20th. Police stated he was not a suspect in the Polly Klaas case. Rhodes died in February 8 2012.

==Children==
The missing children featured by the Polly Klaas Foundation include:
*Jacob Wetterling
*Kiplyn Davis
*Jessica Cain
*Erica Fraysure
*Jennipher Gingery
*Kasey Shepard

===Other people===
*Michelle Le, nursing student. Search efforts were supported by the foundation.

<doc id="168666" wikidata="Q2449527" url="?curid=168666" title="Susan Smith">
<text>Susan Leigh Smith (née Vaughan; born September 26, 1971) is an American woman who was convicted of murdering her two sons, three-year-old Michael and one-year-old Alexander, in 1994 by strapping her children in their car seats, and rolling her car containing her two children into John D. Long Lake in South Carolina.

The case gained international attention because of Smith&#x27;s false claim that a black man had kidnapped her sons during a carjacking. Her defense attorneys, David Bruck and Judy Clarke, called expert witnesses to testify that she had mental health issues that impaired her judgment when she committed the crimes.

Smith was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years. Smith was first eligible for parole on November 20, 2024, which was denied. She is incarcerated at the Leath Correctional Institution near Greenwood, South Carolina.

==Family background==
Smith&#x27;s father died by suicide when she was six years old, and Smith herself attempted suicide at age 13. Her mother then married Beverly C. Russell Jr. who later was revealed to have molested Smith when she was a teenager. Russell was a local businessman who later gained prominence in South Carolina&#x27;s Republican Party and the Christian Coalition. Both Smith and Russell have stated that sexual relations between them continued until six months before the murders.

After graduating from high school in 1989, Smith made a second suicide attempt after a married man she was in a relationship with ended their affair. She married David Smith, and they had two sons.

==Crimes==
On October 25, 1994, Smith reported to police that she had been the victim of a carjacking by a black man while driving her 1990 Mazda Protégé sedan with her sons still in the back seat. For nine days, she made dramatic pleas on national television for their safe return. However, following an intensive investigation and a nationwide search for them, she confessed on November 3, 1994, to letting her car roll into nearby John D. Long Lake, drowning them inside. Her motivation was reportedly to facilitate a relationship with a local wealthy man named Tom Findlay. Prior to the murders, he sent her a letter ending their relationship and expressing that he did not want children. She said there was no motive nor did she plan the murders, stating that she was not in a right state of mind.

Later revelations indicated that detectives doubted Smith&#x27;s story from the start and believed that she murdered her sons. By the second day of the investigation, the police suspected that she knew their location and hoped that they were still alive. Investigators started to search the nearby lakes and ponds, including John D. Long Lake, where their bodies were eventually found. Initial water searches did not locate the car because the police believed it would be within 30 feet of the shore, and did not search further; it turned out to be 122 feet from the shore. After the boys had been missing for two days, Smith was subjected to a polygraph test. A significant breakthrough in the case was her description of the carjacking location. She had claimed that a traffic light had turned red, causing her to stop at an otherwise empty intersection. However, it was determined that the light would not have turned red for her unless another vehicle was present on the intersecting road. This conflicted with her statement that she did not see any other cars there when the carjacking took place. 

===Trial===
In 1995, David Bruck and Judy Clarke served as co-counsel for Smith. In their opening statement, Clarke argued Smith was deeply troubled and experienced severe depression. Clarke told the jury: &quot;This is not a case about evil. This is a case about despair and sadness.&quot; The defense&#x27;s theory of the case was that Smith drove to the edge of the lake to kill herself and her two sons, but her body willed itself out of the car. The prosecution, on the other hand, believed she murdered her sons in order to start a new life with a former lover. It took the jury only two and a half hours to convict her of murdering them. During the penalty phase, Tommy Pope, the lead prosecutor in the Smith case, argued passionately in favor of sentencing Smith to death. The jury ultimately voted against imposing the death penalty. Smith was sentenced to two concurrent life terms in prison in 1995 for the murders of her two sons. Smith&#x27;s defense psychiatrist diagnosed her with dependent personality disorder and major depression.

==Incarceration==
Smith was originally incarcerated in the Administrative Segregation Unit in the Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution in Columbia, South Carolina.

In 2000, two correctional officers at the Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution were charged after having sex with her. Consequently, she was moved to the Leath Correctional Institution in Greenwood. 

Smith&#x27;s first parole eligibility was in November of 2024, at which time she was denied parole.

==In popular culture==
The season three premiere of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; (&quot;The Cabin Show&quot;) features a flashback scene in which Lucille Bluth (Jessica Walter), having recently gone off her postpartum medication, is watching a news story about Smith, and says, &quot;Good for her!&quot;— much to the concern of her son Buster (Tony Hale). The end of the episode features Lucille walking away from her car, with Buster asleep in the back seat as it rolls into a nearby body of water.

Season 6, Episode 8 (&quot;Angel&quot;) of &quot;Law and Order&quot; was based on her case.

Blind Melon&#x27;s song &quot;Car Seat (God&#x27;s Presents),&quot; from their 1995 album &quot;Soup&quot;, was inspired by the Susan Smith murders, as was the Tom House song &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with Susan Smith.&quot; The song &quot;When This is Over,&quot; on Hayden&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Everything I Long For&quot;, is written from the point of view of one of Smith&#x27;s sons as the car sinks into the lake. The first song released by Red Star Belgrade, &quot;Union, S.C.&quot;, is written from Smith&#x27;s perspective. &quot;Paper Gown&quot;, a song from folk singer Caroline Herring&#x27;s 2014 album Lantana takes the form of a murder ballad from the point of view of Smith. 

Smith appears briefly in archival footage in the 2002 film &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; in a scene about &quot;dangerous black guys&quot;.

<text>Small Gods is the thirteenth of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; novels, published in 1992. It tells the origin of the god Om, and his relations with his prophet, the reformer Brutha. In the process, it satirises philosophy, religious institutions, people, and practices, and the role of religion in political life.

==Plot background==
Omnia is a theocracy based on the Seven Books of the Prophets of Om, collectively known as the &quot;Septateuch&quot;. The Discworld is flat and is orbited by its sun, but Omnian doctrine says that the world is round and orbits the sun. Omnians believe in a single god, Om, though the Discworld has many gods, including the billions of Small Gods who exist as points of desire searching for believers. Om was once a Small God, but managed to speak to a shepherd, gained believers (despite the shepherd being stoned to death) and took over from Ur-Gilash as the God of what became Omnia. In Omnian tradition there is a new Prophet every two hundred years.

==Plot==
The Great God Om tries to manifest himself once more in the world, as the time of his Eighth Prophet is nigh. He finds himself in the body of a tortoise, stripped of his divine powers except for the ability to singe eyebrows with tiny thunderbolts. In the gardens of Omnia&#x27;s capital of Kom, he addresses the novice Brutha, the only one able to hear his voice. Om has a hard time convincing the boy of his godliness as Brutha is convinced that Om can do anything he wants and would not want to appear as a tortoise.

Brutha is gifted with an eidetic memory and is therefore chosen by Vorbis, the head of the Quisition, to accompany him on a diplomatic mission to Ephebe as his secretary. Despite his amazing memory, Brutha is illiterate and rarely thinks for himself. This begins to change after Brutha discovers Ephebe&#x27;s philosophers; the idea of people entertaining ideas they are not certain they believe or even understand is an entirely new concept to him.

With the help of Ephebe&#x27;s Great Library and the philosophers Didactylos and his nephew Urn, Om learns that Brutha is his only genuine believer. All others either just fear the Quisition&#x27;s wrath or go along with the church out of habit. After learning that Vorbis had facilitated the death of the missionary Brother Murduck to cover up his being mocked by Ephebian citizenry and to provide a reason for war against Ephebe, Brutha uses his memory to reluctantly aid an Omnian raid through the Labyrinth guarding the Tyrant&#x27;s palace. Because of his authorship of &quot;De Chelonian Mobile&quot; (&quot;The Turtle Moves&quot;), which contradicts Omnian dogma about the shape of the Discworld, Didactylos is brought before Vorbis to face reprisal. Seemingly conceding his previous views about the shape of the world and willing to write a retraction extolling Omnian interpretations, Didactylos escapes after hitting Vorbis with his lantern. Ordered by Vorbis to burn down the Library, Brutha memorizes many scrolls in order to protect Ephebian knowledge as Didactylos sets fire to the building to stop Vorbis reading its scrolls. Completely unrelated to the story, the Librarian of the Unseen University travels through L-Space to rescue several of the abandoned scrolls.

Fleeing the ensuing struggle in Urn&#x27;s steam-powered boat, which is destroyed as the price for an earlier deal made between Om and the Sea Queen, Brutha and Om end up washed up on the desert coast. Trekking home to Omnia with a catatonic Vorbis, they encounter ruined temples dedicated to long-dead, long-forgotten gods, the faint ghost-like small gods yearning to be believed in to become powerful, the small-god-worshipping anchorite St Ungulant, and the human cost of Vorbis&#x27;s plan of leaving caches of water in the desert to attack Ephebe. Realising his &#x27;mortality&#x27; and how important his believers are to him, Om begins to care about them for the first time.

While Brutha, Vorbis, and Om are in the desert, the Tyrant of Ephebe manages to regain control of the city and contacts other nations who have been troubled by Omnia&#x27;s imperialistic ambitions. Sergeant Simony, whose native Istanzia had been conquered by Omnia in his youth, brings Didactylos and Urn to Omnia to lead the Turtle Movement in a rebellion against the Church. 

On the desert&#x27;s edge, a recovered Vorbis attempts to finish off Om&#x27;s tortoise form, knocks out and abducts Brutha, and proclaims himself as the Eighth Prophet, elevating Brutha to archbishop to buy his silence. After Urn accidentally activates the hydraulic system which secretly operates the doors of the Great Temple, Brutha interrupts Vorbis&#x27;s ordainment. As a result, Brutha is to be publicly burned for heresy but Om comes to the rescue, dropping from an eagle&#x27;s claws onto Vorbis&#x27; head, killing him. The great crowd witnesses this miracle and comes to believe in Om, making him powerful again. In the ethereal desert, Vorbis learns to his horror that what he thought was the voice of Om was in fact his own voice echoing inside of his own head, plunging him into despair and leaving him unable to cross the desert and face judgement.

Om manifests himself over the citadel and attempts to grant Brutha the honour of establishing the Church&#x27;s new doctrines. However, Brutha wishes to establish a &#x27;constitutional religion&#x27; whereby Om Himself obeys Omnianism&#x27;s new commandments and answers some of the prayers of his followers in exchange for a steady source of belief, believing that Om will lose his power again otherwise.

Ephebe has allied with several other nations along the Klatchian coast and has sent an army against Omnia, establishing a beachhead near the citadel. Brutha attempts to establish diplomatic contact with the generals of the opposing army, wishing to stop the war before it starts by surrendering. Despite trusting Brutha, the leaders state they do not trust Omnia and that bloodshed is necessary. At the same time, Simony leads the Omnian military including Urn&#x27;s &#x27;Iron Turtle&#x27; war engine to the beachhead in order to fight the anti-Omnian alliance.

Om attempts to physically intervene in the battle, but Brutha demands he does not interfere with the actions of humans. Om is infuriated but obeys Brutha, and instead travels to Dunmanifestin, where gods gamble on the lives of humans in order to gain or lose belief. Om unleashes his fury on the other gods and causing a storm that disrupts the battle. Eventually he compels all other gods of the forces at the battle to tell their soldiers to stop fighting and make peace.

In the aftermath Brutha becomes the Eighth Prophet, ending the Quisition&#x27;s practice of torture and reforming the church to be more open-minded and humanist, with the citadel becoming home to the largest non-magical library on the Discworld. Om also agrees to forsake the smiting of Omnian citizens for at least a hundred years. A hundred years to the day after Om&#x27;s return to power Brutha dies. In the afterlife he finds the spirit of Vorbis and, taking pity on him, guides him to his judgement. It is revealed that this century of peace was originally meant to be a century of war and bloodshed which the History Monk Lu-Tze changed to something he liked better.

==Characters==

*Brutha, a novice in the Omnian Temple. He is apparently 17, which is old for a novice. He cannot read or write but has perfect recall of anything he sees or hears. He can quote chapter and verse from Omnian Scripture. He can also estimate time and distance accurately. Om speaks to him by sending his voice directly into Brutha&#x27;s brain.
*Vorbis, the Exquisitor in charge of the Omnian Quisition. He wants to be the Eighth Prophet of Om. The Great God Om cannot speak to Vorbis, whose mind seems like a hard steel ball.
*Om, a Discworld God occupying the body of a tortoise. Om had been out on the astral plane and attempted to assume the shape of a bull three years ago, but instead turned into a tortoise. He remained non-sentient in this form until being picked up by an eagle and dropped into the citadel, fortunately landing on a compost heap instead of rocks. Om depends on Brutha to exist and possibly regain power, dreading the fate of gods who become nothing more than disembodied voices on the wind when they run out of believers. Besides Brutha, Om can talk to other gods, such as the Sea Queen, with whom he has to bargain for Brutha&#x27;s life after Vorbis causes a porpoise to be killed. Unlike other gods, Om begins to see humans as important, if only to keep up the number of believers. He also realizes that he needs prophets to talk to people on his behalf.
*Didactylos, a blind Ephebian philosopher who lives in a barrel and carries a lantern. He keeps the Library of Ephebe, full of philosophical scrolls that are written but almost never read. His basic philosophy is &quot;We are here, it is now, anything else is guesswork.&quot;
*Urn, Didactylos&#x27;s technically-minded nephew whose knowledge of steam power leads him to build a steam-powered boat and an Iron Turtle, a steam-powered war engine intended to aid the Turtle Movement. Steam powered machines contradict Omnian dogma, which states that such devices cannot perform work as they have neither minds nor muscles.
*Sergeant Simony, a soldier in the Omnian army who wants to kill Vorbis himself out of revenge for the Omnian annexation of his home country, Istanzia. He is an avowed misotheist, albeit only towards Om.
*Lu Tze, one of the Monks of History, who decides to improve Omnian history so it is less bloody. He spends time working in the gardens of the Omnian Temple observing Brutha while sweeping and keeping the soil beds. He may have arranged the compost heap for Om to fall on, thus allowing him to survive.
*Cut-Me-Own-Hand-Off Dhblah, a &quot;convenience food&quot; merchant working in the Place of Lamentation, the public square by the Temple. He is known for &quot;live yoghurt&quot; that threatens to climb out of its container. He is the Omnian equivalent of the Ankh-Morporkian &#x27;merchant venturer&#x27; Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler.
*St. Ungulant, born Servian Thaddeus Ungulant, a hermit who lives in the desert and communes with the small gods, who serve him imaginary feasts. He actually survives by eating bugs and drinking water from certain plants, which enables Brutha and Vorbis to survive. He has an imaginary friend, Angus, who is real enough to kill a lion that attacks him, and is therefore another small god.
*Brother Nhumrod, Master of the Novices. When Brutha comes to him asking about hearing the voice of Om, he lectures Brutha about demonic voices, on which he is an expert, hearing them constantly himself.
*Death, who appears to several Omnians and conducts them to the edge of the great starlit black desert, which they must cross to face Judgement. All do so willingly except Vorbis, who cowers there until Brutha comes to lead him.
*The Gods of Discworld, who exist because people believe in them. Since they only need belief, they are otherwise callous and unintelligent. The Sea Queen demands lives in payment for the killing of a porpoise, despite Om telling her that the humans with him don&#x27;t deserve to die. However, she is easily distracted by a ship full of Omnians in pursuit, killing all but Vorbis. The gods also take the form people believe, so the Ephebian goddess of wisdom, Patina, has a penguin as a companion instead of an owl, because of a sculptor&#x27;s mistake that people started to believe. Om tells Brutha that all the various gods of natural forces are really the same ones using different disguises and props. In Dunmanifestin, Om encounters Blind Io, the Thunder God and chief of the Discworld gods, whom he strikes, and P&#x27;tang P&#x27;tang, a giant newt worshiped by a nation of fifty-one marsh-dwelling nomads.

==Reception==
Australian author Jack Heath described the book as &quot;one of the 20th century&#x27;s finest satires&quot;, and added that &quot;the gods are pompous, the worshippers cowed, and the priests violently closed-minded. Yet the tale is never heavy-handed, thanks to Brutha&#x27;s sincerity and some deftly comical plot twists, as well as all the levity that comes from picturing an angry God trapped in the body of a tortoise.&quot; T.M. Wagner praised it as &quot;an extraordinary novel&quot; on SFreviews.net, and called it a &quot;biting but compassionate satire&quot;. In 2011, National Public Radio ranked it #57 on its list of 100 best science fiction / fantasy novels.

Pratchett stated that he received fan mail from &quot;(1) pagans who say that it really shafts the Big Beard in the Sky religions, and (2) Christians who say that it is an incredibly pro-Christian book&quot;.

==Adaptations==
In 2006 the book was adapted as a serial for BBC Radio 4. It starred Patrick Barlow as Om, Carl Prekopp as Brutha, and Alex Jennings as Vorbis. Anton Lesser was the narrator.

A stage version of &quot;Small Gods&quot; was adapted in 2010 and performed between 17 and 19 February 2011 at The Assembly Rooms Theatre, Durham by OOOOK! Productions and members of Durham Student Theatre. All profits were donated to The Orangutan Foundation. The adaptation was written by Ben Saunders, a graduate of the University of Durham department of Archaeology.

In January 2016 the official Terry Pratchett Twitter feed announced an upcoming comic adaptation of &quot;Small Gods&quot; by cartoonist Ray Friesen.

An audiobook read by Andy Serkis was released on Audible on the 28th of April 2022; Bill Nighy and Peter Serafinowicz also had small roles.

<text>Teradata Corporation is an American software company that provides cloud database and analytics-related software, products, and services. The company was formed in 1979 in Brentwood, California, as a collaboration between researchers at Caltech and Citibank&#x27;s advanced technology group.

==Overview==
Teradata is an enterprise software company that develops and sells database analytics software. The company provides three main services: business analytics, cloud products, and consulting. It operates in North and Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

Teradata is headquartered in San Diego, California and has additional major U.S. locations in Atlanta and San Francisco, where its data center research and development is housed. It is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the stock symbol TDC. Steve McMillan has served as the company&#x27;s president and chief executive officer since 2020. The company reported $1.836 billion in revenue, a net income of $129 million, and 8,535 employees globally, as of February 9, 2020.

==History==
The concept of Teradata grew from research at the California Institute of Technology and from the discussions of Citibank&#x27;s advanced technology group in the 1970s. In 1979, the company was incorporated in Brentwood, California by Jack E. Shemer, Philip M. Neches, Walter E. Muir, Jerold R. Modes, William P. Worth, Carroll Reed and David Hartke. Teradata released its DBC/1012 database machine in 1984. In 1990, the company acquired Sharebase, originally named Britton Lee. In September 1991, AT&amp;T Corporation acquired NCR Corporation, which announced the acquisition of Teradata for about $250 million in December. Teradata built the first system over 1 terabyte for Wal-Mart in 1992.

NCR acquired Strategic Technologies &amp; Systems in 1999 and appointed Stephen Brobst as chief technology officer of Teradata Solutions Group. In 2000, NCR acquired Ceres Integrated Solutions and its customer relationship management software for $90 million, as well as Stirling Douglas Group and its demand chain management software. Teradata acquired financial management software from DecisionPoint in 2005. In January 2007, NCR announced Teradata would become an independent public company, led by Michael F. Koehler. The new company&#x27;s shares started trading in October.

In April 2016, a hardware product line called IntelliFlex was announced. Victor L. Lund became the chief executive on May 5, 2016.

In October 2018, Teradata started promoting its cloud analytics software called Vantage (which evolved from the Teradata Database).

On May 7, 2020, Teradata announced the appointment of Steve McMillan as president and chief executive officer, effective June 8, 2020

In December 2024, Teradata successfully appealed a California federal judge&#x27;s decision in favor of SAP SE in a case involving allegations of trade secret misappropriation and antitrust violations. The lawsuit accused SAP of using Teradata&#x27;s trade secrets to address technical issues in its software and of violating antitrust laws by bundling products and requiring customers to purchase them together. A federal appeals court reversed the earlier ruling, reviving Teradata&#x27;s claims.

===Acquisitions and divestitures===
Teradata has acquired several companies since becoming an independent public company in 2008. In March 2008, Teradata acquired professional services company Claraview, which previously had spun out software provider Clarabridge. Teradata acquired column-oriented DBMS vendor Kickfire in August 2010, followed by the marketing software company Aprimo for about $550 million in December. In March 2011, the company acquired Aster Data Systems for about $263 million. Teradata acquired Software-as-a-service digital marketing company eCircle in May 2012, which was merged into the Aprimo business.

In 2014, Teradata acquired the assets of Revelytix, a provider of information management products and for a reported $50 million. In September, Teradata acquired Hadoop service firm Think Big Analytics. In December, Teradata acquired RainStor, a company specializing in online data archiving on Hadoop. Teradata acquired Appoxxee, a mobile marketing software as a service provider, for about $20 million in January 2015, followed by the Netherlands-based digital marketing company FLXone in September. That same year Teradata acquired a small Business Intelligence firm, MiaPearl.

In July 2016, the marketing applications division, using the Aprimo brand, was sold to private equity firm Marlin Equity Partners for about $90 million with Aprimo under CEO John Stammen moving its headquarters to Chicago. while absorbing Revenew Inc. that Marlin had also bought.

Teradata acquired Big Data Partnership, a service company based in the UK, on July 21, 2016. In July 2017, Teradata acquired StackIQ, maker of the Stacki cluster manager software.
==Technology and products==
Teradata offers three primary services to its customers: cloud and hardware-based data warehousing, business analytics, and consulting services. In September 2016, the company launched Teradata Everywhere, which allows users to submit queries against public and private databases. The service uses massively parallel processing across both its physical data warehouse and cloud storage, including managed environments such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, VMware, and Teradata&#x27;s Managed Cloud and IntelliFlex. Teradata offers customers both hybrid cloud and multi-cloud storage. In March 2017, Teradata introduced Teradata IntelliCloud, a secure managed cloud for data and analytic software as a service. IntelliCloud is compatible with Teradata&#x27;s data warehouse platform, IntelliFlex. The Teradata Analytics Platform was unveiled in 2017.

===Big data===
Teradata began to use the term &quot;big data&quot; in 2010. CTO Stephen Brobst attributed the rise of big data to &quot;new media sources, such as social media.&quot; The increase in semi-structured and unstructured data gathered from online interactions prompted Teradata to form the &quot;Petabyte club&quot; in 2011 for its heaviest big data users.

The rise of big data resulted in many traditional data warehousing companies updating their products and technology. For Teradata, big data prompted the acquisition of Aster Data Systems in 2011 for the company&#x27;s MapReduce capabilities and ability to store and analyze semi-structured data.

===Old hardware line end of support===
To focus on its cloud database and analytics software business, Teradata plans to end support for its old hardware platforms; Teradata will provide remedial maintenance services for six (6) years from its Platform Sales Discontinuation Date. Platform Support Discontinuation is the end of the support date for a particular Teradata hardware platform. Teradata hardware platforms saw support discontinuation start in 2017, with the 2580 generation of their data warehouse appliance, with only their IntelliFlex 2.5 and R740 hardware platforms being listed as &quot;current product&quot;. All other platform models/classes have a published support discontinuation date. Teradata customers may request extended support for a Teradata platform that has reached its end of support life. The extended support for a platform requires approval from the local Area Director and will be delivered on a &quot;best effort&quot; basis, as spare parts for older platforms may no longer be available.

===Teradata Vantage analytics===
In October 2018, Teradata started calling the cloud analytics software product line Vantage. Vantage is composed of various analytics engines on a core relational database, including the Aster graph database and a machine learning engine. The capability to leverage open-source analytic engines such as Spark and TensorFlow was released.
Vantage can be deployed across public clouds, on-premises, and commodity infrastructure. Vantage provides storage and analysis for multi-structured data formats.

<text>The Panavia Tornado is a family of twin-engine, variable-sweep wing multi-role combat aircraft, jointly developed and manufactured by Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany. There are three primary Tornado variants: the Tornado IDS (interdictor/strike) fighter-bomber, the Tornado ECR (electronic combat/reconnaissance) SEAD aircraft and the Tornado ADV (air defence variant) interceptor aircraft.

The Tornado was developed and built by Panavia Aircraft GmbH, a tri-national consortium consisting of British Aerospace (previously British Aircraft Corporation), MBB of West Germany, and Aeritalia of Italy. It first flew on 14 August 1974 and was introduced into service in 1979–1980. Due to its multirole design, it was able to replace several different types of aircraft in the adopting air forces. The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) became the only export operator of the Tornado, in addition to the three original partner nations. A training and evaluation unit operating from RAF Cottesmore, the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment, maintained a level of international co-operation beyond the production stage.

The Tornado was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF), Italian Air Force, and RSAF during the Gulf War of 1991, in which the Tornado conducted many low-altitude penetrating strike missions. The Tornados of various services were also used in the Bosnian War, Kosovo War, Iraq War, in Libya during the 2011 Libyan civil war, as well as smaller roles in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria. Including all variants, 990 aircraft were built.

==Development==

===Origins===
During the 1960s, aeronautical designers looked to variable-geometry wing designs to gain the maneuverability and efficient cruise of straight wings with the speed of swept wing designs. The United Kingdom had cancelled the procurement of the BAC TSR-2 tactical strike and reconnaissance aircraft in 1965 and then -in 1967 - the US General Dynamics F-111K aircraft that was supposed to fulfil the same role, and was still looking for a replacement for its Avro Vulcan strategic bomber and Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft. Britain and France had initiated the BAC/Dassault AFVG (from &quot;Anglo-French Variable Geometry&quot;) project in 1965, but this had ended with French withdrawal in 1967. Britain continued to develop a variable-geometry aircraft similar to the proposed AFVG, and sought new partners to achieve this. West German EWR with Boeing then with Fairchild-Hiller and Republic Aviation had been developing design studies of the swing-wing EWR-Fairchild-Hiller A400 AVS Advanced Vertical Strike (which has a similar configuration to the Tornado) from 1964 to 1968.

In 1968, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Canada formed a working group to examine replacements for the Lockheed F-104G Starfighter multi-role fighter-bomber, initially called the &quot;Multi Role Aircraft (MRA)&quot;, later renamed as the &quot;Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA)&quot;. As the partner nations&#x27; requirements were so diverse, it was decided to develop a single aircraft that could perform a variety of missions that were previously undertaken by a fleet of different aircraft. Britain joined the MRCA group in 1968, represented by Air Vice-Marshal Michael Giddings, and a memorandum of agreement was drafted between Britain, West Germany, and Italy in May 1969.

By the end of 1968, the prospective purchases from the six countries amounted to 1,500 aircraft. Canada and Belgium had departed before any long-term commitments had been made to the programme; Canada had found the project politically unpalatable; there was a perception in political circles that much of the manufacturing and specifications were focused on Western Europe. France had made a favourable offer to Belgium on the Dassault Mirage 5.

===Panavia Aircraft GmbH===
On 26 March 1969, four partner nations – United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, agreed to form a multinational company, Panavia Aircraft GmbH, to develop and manufacture the MRCA. The project&#x27;s aim was to produce an aircraft capable of undertaking missions in the tactical strike, reconnaissance, air defence, and maritime roles. Various concepts, including alternative fixed-wing and single-engine designs, were studied while defining the aircraft. The Netherlands pulled out of the project in 1970, citing that the aircraft was too complicated and technical for the RNLAF&#x27;s preferences, which had sought a simpler aircraft with outstanding manoeuvrability. An additional blow was struck when the German requirement reduced from an initial 600 aircraft to 324 in 1972. It has been suggested that Germany deliberately placed an unrealistically high initial order to secure the company headquarters and initial test flight in Germany rather than the UK, to have a bigger design influence.
When the agreement was finalised, the United Kingdom and West Germany each had a 42.5% stake of the workload, with the remaining 15% going to Italy; this division of the production work was heavily influenced by international political bargaining. The front fuselage and tail assembly was assigned to BAC (now BAE Systems) in the United Kingdom; the centre fuselage to MBB (now part of Airbus) in West Germany; and the wings to Aeritalia (now Leonardo) in Italy. Similarly, tri-national worksharing was used for engines and equipment. A separate multinational company, Turbo-Union, was formed in June 1970 to develop and build the RB199 engines for the aircraft, with ownership split 40% Rolls-Royce, 40% MTU, and 20% FIAT.

At the conclusion of the project definition phase in May 1970, the concepts were reduced to two designs; a single seat Panavia 100 which West Germany initially preferred, and the twin-seat Panavia 200 which the RAF preferred. The aircraft was briefly called the &quot;Panavia Panther&quot;, and the project soon coalesced towards the two-seat option. In September 1971, the three governments signed an Intention to Proceed (ITP) document, at which point the aircraft was intended solely for the low-level strike mission, where it was viewed as a viable threat to Soviet defences in that role. It was at this point that Britain&#x27;s Chief of the Defence Staff announced, &quot;two-thirds of the fighting front line will be composed of this single, basic aircraft type&quot;.

===Prototypes and testing===
The first of fifteen development aircraft (nine prototypes, P01 to P09, and six pre-series, PS11 to PS 16) flew on 14 August 1974 at Manching, Germany; the pilot, Paul Millett described his experience: &quot;Aircraft handling was delightful... the actual flight went so smoothly that I did begin to wonder whether this was not yet another simulation&quot;. Flight testing led to the need for minor modifications. Airflow disturbances were corrected by re-profiling the engine intakes and the fuselage to minimise surging and buffeting at supersonic speeds.

According to Jim Quinn, programmer of the Tornado development simulation software and engineer on the Tornado engine and engine controls, the prototype was safely capable of reaching supercruise, but the engines had severe safety issues at high altitude while trying to decelerate. At high altitude and low turbine speed the compressor did not provide enough pressure to hold back the combustion pressure and would result in a violent vibration as the combustion pressure backfired into the intake. To avoid this effect the engine controls would automatically increase the minimum idle setting as altitude increased, until at very high altitudes the idle setting was so high, however, that it was close to maximum dry thrust. This resulted in one of the test aircraft being stuck in a mach 1.2 supercruise at high altitude and having to reduce speed by turning the aircraft, because the idle setting at that altitude was so high that the aircraft could not decelerate.

Testing revealed that a nose-wheel steering augmentation system, connecting with the yaw damper, was necessary to counteract the destabilising effect produced by deploying the thrust reverser during the landing roll.

From 1967 until 1984 Soviet KGB agents were provided details on the Tornado by the head of the West German Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm Planning department, Manfred Rotsch.

Two prototypes were lost in accidents, both of which had been primarily caused by poor piloting decisions and errors leading to two ground collision incidents; a third Tornado prototype was seriously damaged by an incident involving pilot-induced pitch oscillation. During the type&#x27;s development, aircraft designers of the era were beginning to incorporate features such as more sophisticated stability augmentation systems and autopilots. Aircraft such as the Tornado and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon made use of these new technologies. Failure testing of the Tornado&#x27;s triplex analogue command and stability augmentation system (CSAS) was conducted on a series of realistic flight control rigs; the variable-sweep wings in combination with varying, and frequently very heavy, payloads complicated the clearance process.

===Production===
The contract for the Batch 1 aircraft was signed on 29 July 1976. The first flight of a production aircraft was on 10 July 1979 by ZA319 at BAe Warton. The first aircraft were delivered to the RAF and German Air Force on 5 and 6 June 1979 respectively. The first Italian Tornado was delivered on 25 September 1981. On 29 January 1981, the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment (TTTE) officially opened at RAF Cottesmore, remaining active in training pilots from all operating nations until 31 March 1999. The 500th Tornado to be produced was delivered to West Germany on 19 December 1987.

Export customers were sought after West Germany withdrew its objections to exporting the aircraft; Saudi Arabia was the only export customer of the Tornado. The agreement to purchase the Tornado was part of the Al-Yamamah arms deal between British Aerospace and the Saudi government. Oman had committed to purchasing eight Tornado F2s and the equipment to operate them for a total value of £250 million in August 1985, but cancelled the order in 1990 due to financial difficulties.

During the 1970s, Australia considered joining the MRCA programme to find a replacement for their ageing Dassault Mirage IIIs; ultimately the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet was selected to meet the requirement. Canada similarly opted for the F/A-18 after considering the Tornado. Japan considered the Tornado in the 1980s, along with the F-16 and F/A-18, before selecting the Mitsubishi F-2. In the 1990s, both Taiwan and South Korea expressed interest in acquiring a small number of Tornado ECR aircraft. In 2001, EADS proposed a Tornado ECR variant with a greater electronic warfare capability for Australia.

Production came to an end in 1998; the last batch of aircraft produced going to the Royal Saudi Air Force, who had ordered a total of 96 IDS Tornados. In June 2011, it was announced that the Tornado fleet had flown collectively over one million flying hours. Aviation author Jon Lake noted that &quot;The Trinational Panavia Consortium produced just short of 1,000 Tornados, making it one of the most successful postwar bomber programs&quot;. In 2008, &quot;AirForces Monthly&quot; said of the Tornado: &quot;For more than a quarter of a century ... the most important military aircraft in Western Europe.&quot;

==Design==

===Overview===
The Panavia Tornado is a multirole, twin-engined aircraft designed to excel at low-level penetration of enemy defences. The mission envisaged during the Cold War was the delivery of conventional and nuclear ordnance on the invading forces of the Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe; this dictated several significant features of the design. Variable wing geometry allowed for minimal drag during the low-level dash towards a well-prepared enemy. Advanced navigation and flight computers, including the then-innovative fly-by-wire system, greatly reduced the workload of the pilot during low-level flight and eased control of the aircraft. For long range missions, the Tornado has a retractable refuelling probe.

As a multirole aircraft, the Tornado is capable of undertaking more mission profiles than the anticipated strike mission; various operators replaced multiple aircraft types with the Tornado as a common type – the use of dedicated single role aircraft for specialist purposes such as battlefield reconnaissance, maritime patrol duties, or dedicated electronic countermeasures (ECM) were phased out – either by standard Tornados or modified variants, such as the Tornado ECR. The most extensive modification from the base Tornado design was the Tornado ADV, which was stretched and armed with long range anti-aircraft missiles to serve in the interceptor role.

Tornado operators have undertaken various life extension and upgrade programmes to keep their Tornado fleets as viable frontline aircraft. With these upgrades it is projected that the Tornado shall be in service until 2025, more than 50 years after the first prototype took flight.

===Variable-sweep wing===

In order for the Tornado to perform well as a low-level supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight characteristics. To achieve high-speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. The swing-wing was also used by the older American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The smaller Tornado has many similarities with the F-111, however the Tornado differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.

The level of wing sweep (i.e. the angle of the wings in relation to the fuselage) can be altered in flight at the pilot&#x27;s control. The variable wing can adopt any sweep angle between 25 degrees and 67 degrees, with a corresponding speed range for each angle. Some Tornado ADVs were outfitted with an automatic wing-sweep system to reduce pilot workload. When the wings are swept back, the exposed wing area is lowered and drag is significantly decreased, which is conducive to performing high-speed low-level flight. The weapons pylons pivot with the angle of the variable-sweep wings so that the stores point in the direction of flight and do not hinder any wing positions.

In development, significant attention was given to the Tornado&#x27;s short-field take-off and landing (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect. For shorter take-off and landing distances, the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and leading edge slats to allow the aircraft to fly at lower speeds. These features, in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent low-speed handling and landing characteristics.

===Avionics===

The Tornado features a tandem-seat cockpit, crewed by a pilot and a navigator/weapons officer; both electromechanical and electro-optical controls are used to fly the aircraft and manage its systems. An array of dials and switches are mounted on either side of a centrally placed CRT monitor, controlling the navigational, communications, and weapons-control computers. BAE Systems developed the Tornado Advanced Radar Display Information System (TARDIS), a multi-function display, to replace the rear cockpit&#x27;s Combined Radar and Projected Map Display; the RAF began installing TARDIS on the GR4 fleet in 2004.

The primary flight controls of the Tornado are a fly-by-wire hybrid, consisting of an analogue Command and Stability Augmentation System (CSAS) connected to a digital Autopilot &amp; Flight Director System (AFDS). In addition a level of mechanical reversion capacity was retained to safeguard against potential failure. To enhance pilot awareness, artificial feel was built into the flight controls, such as the centrally located stick. Because the Tornado&#x27;s variable wings enable the aircraft to drastically alter its flight envelope, the artificial responses adjust automatically to wing profile changes and other changes to flight attitude. As a large variety of munitions and stores can be outfitted, the resulting changes to the aircraft&#x27;s flight dynamics are routinely compensated for by the flight stability system.
The Tornado incorporates a combined navigation/attack Doppler radar that simultaneously scans for targets and conducts fully automated terrain-following for low-level flight operations. Being able to conduct all-weather hands-off low-level flight was considered one of the core advantages of the Tornado. The Tornado ADV had a different radar system to other variants, designated AI.24 Foxhunter, as it is designed for air defence operations. It was capable of tracking up to 20 targets at ranges of up to . The Tornado was one of the earliest aircraft to be fitted with a digital data bus for data transmission. A Link 16 JTIDS integration on the F3 variant enabled the exchange of radar and other sensory information with nearby friendly aircraft.

Some Tornado variants carry different avionics and equipment, depending on their mission. The Tornado ECR operated by Germany and Italy is devoted to Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) missions. The Tornado ECR is equipped with an emitter-locator system (ELS) to detect radar use. German ECRs have a Honeywell infrared imaging system for reconnaissance flights. RAF and RSAF Tornados have the Laser Range Finder and Marked Target Seekers (LRMTS) for targeting laser-guided munitions. In 1991, the RAF introduced TIALD, allowing Tornado GR1s to laser-designate their own targets.

The GR1A and GR4A reconnaissance variants were equipped with TIRRS (Tornado Infrared Reconnaissance System), consisting of one SLIR (Sideways Looking Infra Red) sensor on each side of the fuselage forward of the engine intakes to capture oblique images, and a single IRLS (InfrarRed LineScan) sensor mounted on the fuselage&#x27;s underside to provide vertical images. TIRRS recorded images on six S-VHS video tapes. The newer RAPTOR reconnaissance pod replaced the built-in TIRRS system.

===Armament and equipment===

The Tornado is cleared to carry the majority of air-launched weapons in the NATO inventory, including various unguided and laser-guided bombs, anti-ship and anti-radiation missiles, as well as specialised weapons such as anti-personnel mines and anti-runway munitions. To improve survivability in combat, the Tornado is equipped with onboard countermeasures, ranging from flare and chaff dispensers to electronic countermeasure pods that can be mounted under the wings. Underwing fuel tanks and a buddy store aerial refuelling system that allows one Tornado to refuel another are available to extend the aircraft&#x27;s range.
In the decades since the Tornado&#x27;s introduction, all of the Tornado operators have undertaken various upgrade and modification programmes to allow new weapons to be used by their squadrons. Amongst the armaments that the Tornado has been adapted to deploy are the Enhanced Paveway and Joint Direct Attack Munition bombs, and modern cruise missiles such as the Taurus and Storm Shadow missiles. These upgrades have increased the Tornado&#x27;s capabilities and combat accuracy. Precision weapons such as cruise missiles have replaced older munitions such as cluster bombs.

Strike variants have a limited air-to-air capability with AIM-9 Sidewinder or AIM-132 ASRAAM air-to-air missiles (AAMs). The Tornado ADV was outfitted with beyond visual range AAMs such as the Skyflash and AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. The Tornado is armed with two Mauser BK-27 revolver cannon internally mounted underneath the fuselage; the Tornado ADV was only armed with one cannon. When the RAF GR1 aircraft were converted to GR4, the FLIR sensor replaced the left hand cannon, leaving only one; the GR1A reconnaissance variant gave up both its guns to make space for the sideways looking infra-red sensors. The Mauser BK-27 was developed specifically for the Tornado, but has since been used on several other European fighters, such as the Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet, Saab JAS 39 Gripen, and Eurofighter Typhoon.

The Tornado is capable of delivering air-launched nuclear weapons. In 1979, Britain considered replacing its Polaris submarines with either the Trident submarines or the Tornado as the main bearer of its nuclear deterrent. Although the UK proceeded with Trident, several Tornado squadrons based in Germany were assigned to SACEUR to deter a major Soviet offensive with both conventional and nuclear weapons, namely the WE.177 nuclear bomb, which was retired in 1998. German and Italian Tornados are capable of delivering US B61 nuclear bombs, which are made available through NATO.

===Engine===
Britain considered the selection of Rolls-Royce to develop the advanced engine for the MRCA to be essential, and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer, to the point where the UK might have withdrawn over the issue. In September 1969, Rolls-Royce&#x27;s RB199 engine was selected to power the MRCA. One advantage over the US competition was that a technology transfer between the partner nations had been agreed; the engine was to be developed and manufactured by a joint company, Turbo-Union. The programme was delayed by Rolls-Royce&#x27;s entry into receivership in 1971. however the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme. Research from the supersonic airliner Concorde contributed to the development and final design of the RB199 and of the engine control units.
To operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2, the RB199 and several other engines make use of variable intake ramps to control the air flow. The hydraulic system is pressurised by syphoning power from both or either operational engine; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating with the engine to improve safety and maintainability. In case of double-engine, or double-generator, failure, the Tornado has a single-use battery capable of operating the fuel pump and hydraulics for up to 13 minutes.

Relatively rarely among fighter aircraft, the RB199 is fitted with thrust reversers to decrease the distance required to land safely. To fully deploy the thrust reverser during landings, the yaw damper is connected to the steering of the nosewheel to provide greater stability.

In August 1974, the first RB199 powered flight of a prototype Tornado occurred and the engine completed its qualification tests in late 1978. The final production standard engine met both reliability and performance standards, though the development cost had been higher than predicted, in part due to the ambitious performance requirements. At the time of the Tornado&#x27;s introduction to service, the turbine blades of the engine suffered from a shorter life span than desired, which was rectified by the implementation of design revisions upon early-production engines. Several uprated engines were developed and used on both the majority of Tornado ADVs and Germany&#x27;s Tornado ECRs. The DECU (&quot;Digital Engine Control Unit&quot;) is the current engine control unit for RB199 engines superseding the analogue MECU (&quot;Main Engine Control Unit&quot;) also known as CUE.

===Upgrades===
Being designed for low-level operations, the Tornado required modification to perform in medium level operations that the RAF adopted in the 1990s. The RAF&#x27;s GR1 fleet was extensively re-manufactured as Tornado GR4s. Upgrades on Tornado GR4s included a forward looking infrared, a wide-angle HUD (head-up display), improved cockpit displays, NVG (night vision devices) capabilities, new avionics, and a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The upgrade eased the integration of new weapons and sensors which were purchased in parallel, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile, the Brimstone anti-tank missile, Paveway III laser-guided bombs and the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod. The first flight of a Tornado GR4 was on 4 April 1997. The RAF accepted its first delivery on 31 October 1997 and deliveries were completed in 2003. In 2005, the RSAF opted to have their Tornado IDSs undergo a series of upgrades to become equivalent to the RAF&#x27;s GR4 configuration. On 21 December 2007 BAE signed a £210m contract for CUSP, the Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot). This project would see RAF GR4/4A improved in two phases, starting with the integration of the Paveway IV bomb and a communications upgrade, followed by a new tactical datalink in Phase B.

Beginning in 2000, German IDS and ECR Tornados received the ASSTA 1 (Avionics System Software Tornado in Ada) upgrade. ASSTA 1 involved a replacement weapons computer, new GPS and Laser Inertial navigation systems. The new computer allowed the integration of the HARM III, HARM 0 Block IV/V and Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, the Rafael Litening II laser designator pod and GBU-24 Paveway III laser-guided bombs. The ASSTA 2 upgrade began in 2005, primarily consisting of several new digital avionics systems and a new ECM suite; these upgrades are to be only applied to 85 Tornados (20 ECRs and 65 IDSs), as the Tornado is being replaced in part by the Eurofighter Typhoon. The ASSTA 3 upgrade programme, started in 2008, will introduce support for the laser-targeted Joint Direct Attack Munition along with further software changes.

In January 2016, &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper stated that the newest upgrade of the ASSTA suite to version 3.1, which includes colour multifunctional LCD screens in place of monochrome CRT displays, is interfering with helmet-mounted night-vision optical displays worn by pilots, rendering German Tornado bombers deployed to Syria useless for night missions. The defence ministry admitted that bright cockpit lights could be a distraction for pilots, and said that the solution will be implemented in a few weeks, but denied the need to fly night missions in Syria.
The TV TAB displays are used for route planning, the forward-looking infra-red (FLIR) sensors, targeting pods such as TIALD (Thermal Imaging and Laser Designator) and CLDP (Convertible Laser Designator Pod). The original MRCA TV TAB DU navigation display (part number V22.498.90) has a green CRT as the picture source. The original price for one CRT display version was €33,852.64. Due to the light environment, the picture tube was pushed to the limit due to the high brightness levels causing wear of the picture tube. An &quot;Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays (AMLCD)&quot; drop fit replacement with a digital screen TV TAB (NSN 5895-99-597-1323) was developed to replace the &#x27;old&#x27; wear-sensitive CRT versions. The CRT versions are mainly recognisable by the two white domes at the top of the display containing the light sensors for automatic brightness regulation and the white buttons. The newer digital version is mainly recognisable by the black buttons with big white dots on them. The replacement AMLCD version has a color display instead of the original green monochrome display. A new feature is that the AMLCD has a bezel that reduces the angle of view. The main goal of the AMLCD upgrade was the intended significant reduction in life cycle costs. But it&#x27;s said that the newer AMLCD version fail rather quickly due to the more sensitive and complex digital electronics compared to the much simpler design of the original CRT display. The old and newer version are a masterpiece of state of the art engineering and both are very well built. For example there&#x27;s a diagnostic connector at the back panel for quick troubleshooting. The display unit is eventually a rather &#x27;dumb&#x27; device. The original display unit is &#x27;just&#x27; a display and a keypad. To show a picture, the separate video signal, vertical and horizontal synchronisation signals have to be fed into the display unit since there&#x27;s no internal electronics for synchronisation separation of the video signal. The additional waveform generator (WFG) is needed to &#x27;create&#x27; the desired images for use in the airplane. To power the display unit, a three phase 115 VAC 400 Hz including neutral and a 28 VDC signal have to be supplied to the display unit. The CRT version has a Low Voltage Power Supply (LVPS) for creating the needed low voltage signals. There&#x27;s also a High Voltage Power Supply (HVPS) for creating the desired high voltage for the CRT picture tube. Since the newer AMLCD has no CRT picture tube, the high voltages are not needed and the mechanical and electrical design is completely different except for the connections, mounting points and functionality. The newer AMLCD version &#x27;only&#x27; needs 28 VDC for functionality. But since a drop fit replacement is mandatory, the AMLCD version has a built in three phase 115VAC 400 Hz conversion to 28 VDC. By removing the rear three phase conversion power supply plug-in board and applying 28 VDC (&lt;4.1 A) to the power supply board, the device can be powered for avionics enthusiast use. The AMLCD has a built in menu for selecting the airplane type: GR1, GR4 or F3, a self test and a display test like a grid pattern and color bars shown in the picture.

BAE Systems announced that, in December 2013, it had test-flown a Tornado equipped with parts made by 3D printing. The parts included a protective cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support struts. The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, with some costing less than £100 to make, 3D printing of parts had saved more than £300,000 which potentially could reach more than £1.2 million by 2017.

==Operational history==

===German Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;)===
The first Tornado prototype made its first flight on 14 August 1974 from Ingolstadt Manching Airport, in West Germany. Deliveries of production Tornados began on 27 July 1979. The total number of Tornados delivered to the German Air Force was 247, including 35 ECR variants. Originally Tornados equipped five fighter-bomber wings (&quot;Geschwader&quot;), with one tactical conversion unit and four front-line wings, replacing the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. When one of the two Tornado wings of the German Navy was disbanded in 1994, its aircraft were used to re-equip a Luftwaffe&#x27;s reconnaissance wing formerly equipped with McDonnell Douglas RF-4E Phantoms.

14 German Tornados undertook combat operations as a part of NATO&#x27;s campaign during the Bosnian War. The Tornados, operating from Piacenza, Italy, flew reconnaissance missions to survey damage inflicted by previous strikes and to scout new targets. These reconnaissance missions were reportedly responsible for a significant improvement in target selection throughout the campaign.

In 1999, German Tornados participated in Operation Allied Force, NATO airstrikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War. This was Germany&#x27;s first offensive air mission since World War II. The ECR aircraft escorted various allies&#x27; aircraft while carrying several AGM-88 HARM missiles to counter attempted use of radar against the allied aircraft. During the Kosovo hostilities, Germany&#x27;s IDS Tornados routinely conducted reconnaissance flights to identify both enemy ground forces and civilian refugees within Yugoslavia. The German Tornados flew 2108 hours and 446 sorties, firing 236 HARM missiles at hostile targets.
In June 2007, a pair of Luftwaffe Tornados flew reconnaissance missions over an anti-globalisation demonstration during the 33rd G8 summit in Heiligendamm. Following the mission, the German Defence Ministry admitted one aircraft had broken the minimum flying altitude and that mistakes were made in the handling of security of the summit.

In 2007, a detachment of six Tornados of the Aufklärungsgeschwader 51 &quot;Immelmann&quot; (51st reconnaissance wing) were deployed to Mazar-i-Sharif, Northern Afghanistan, to support NATO forces. The decision to send Tornados to Afghanistan was controversial: one political party launched an unsuccessful legal bid to block the deployment as unconstitutional. In support of the Afghanistan mission, improvements in the Tornado&#x27;s reconnaissance equipment were accelerated; enhancing the Tornado&#x27;s ability to detect hidden improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The German Tornados were withdrawn from Afghanistan in November 2010.

Defence cuts announced in March 2003 resulted in the decision to retire 90 Tornados from service with the Luftwaffe. This led to a reduction in its Tornado strength to four wings by September 2005. On 13 January 2004, the then German Defence Minister Peter Struck announced further major changes to the German armed forces. A major part of this announcement was the plan to cut the German fighter fleet from 426 in early 2004 to 265 by 2015. The German Tornado force was to be reduced to 85, with the type expected to remain in service with the Luftwaffe until 2025. The aircraft being retained have been undergoing a service life extension programme. Currently, the Luftwaffe operates Tornados with Tactical Wings Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 33 in Cochem/Büchel Air Base, Rhineland-Palatinate and with Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 51 &quot;Immelmann&quot; in Jagel, Schleswig-Holstein.

German Tornado aircrew training took place at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, US from January 1996 at the Taktische Ausbildungskommando der Luftwaffe USA (&quot;TaktAusbKdoLw USA&quot; Tactical Training Command of the Luftwaffe USA) which was responsible for training both German F-4 Phantom and Tornado crews. In 1999 the training command was renamed as Fliegerisches Ausbildungszentrum der Luftwaffe (&quot;FlgAusbZLw&quot; Luftwaffe Training Center). In March 2015, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen decided to continue this training in Germany. In September 2017, flight training in Holloman for the Tornado was discontinued and transferred to Taktischen Luftwaffengeschwader 51 in Jagel with the US location command dissolved in 2019.

In April 2020, it was reported that the German defence ministry planned to replace its Tornado aircraft with a purchase of 30 Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, 15 EA-18G Growlers, and 55 Eurofighter Typhoons. The Super Hornet was selected due to its compatibility with nuclear weapons and availability of an electronic attack version. In March 2020, the Super Hornet was not certified for the B61 nuclear bombs, but Dan Gillian, head of Boeing&#x27;s Super Hornet program, previously stated &quot;We certainly think that we, working with the U.S. government, can meet the German requirements there on the [required] timeline.&quot;

In 2021, Airbus offered to replace Luftwaffe&#x27;s 90 ageing Tornado Interdiction and Strike (IDS) and Electronic Combat Reconnaissance (ECR) aircraft with 85 new Eurofighter Tranche 5 standard from 2030. In 2022, the German defence ministry announced that 35 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning IIs will replace the Tornado fleet for nuclear sharing instead of the discussed 30 Boeing Super Hornets.

===German Navy (&quot;Marineflieger&quot;)===
In addition to the order made by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, the German Navy&#x27;s &quot;Marineflieger&quot; also received 112 of the IDS variant in the anti-shipping and marine reconnaissance roles, again replacing the Starfighter. These Tornados equipped two wings, each with a nominal strength of 48 aircraft. The principal anti-ship weapon was the AS.34 Kormoran anti-ship missile, which were initially supplemented by unguided bombs and BL755 cluster munitions, and later by AGM-88 HARM anti-radar missiles. Pods fitted with panoramic optical cameras and an infrared line scan were carried for the reconnaissance mission.

The end of the Cold War and the signing of the CFE Treaty led Germany to reduce the size of its armed forces, including the number of combat aircraft. To meet this need, one of the &quot;Marineflieger&quot;&#x27;s Tornado wings was disbanded on 1 January 1994; its aircraft replaced the Phantoms of a Luftwaffe reconnaissance wing. The second wing was enlarged and continued in the anti-shipping, reconnaissance and anti-radar roles until it was disbanded in 2005 with its aircraft and duties passed on to the Luftwaffe.

===Italian Air Force (&quot;Aeronautica Militare&quot;)===
The first Italian prototype made its maiden flight on 5 December 1975 from Turin. The Aeronautica Militare received 100 Tornado IDSs (known as the A-200 in Italian service). 16 A-200s were subsequently converted to the ECR configuration; the first Italian Tornado ECR (known as the EA-200) was delivered on 27 February 1998. As a stop-gap measure for 10 years the Aeronautica Militare additionally operated 24 Tornado ADVs in the air defence role, which were leased from the RAF to cover the service gap between the retirement of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the introduction of the Eurofighter Typhoon.
Italian Tornados, along with RAF Tornados, took part in the first Gulf War in 1991. Operazione Locusta saw eight Tornado IDS interdictors deployed from Gioia del Colle, Italy, to Al Dhafra, Abu Dhabi, as part of Italy&#x27;s contribution to the coalition. During the conflict, one aircraft was lost to Iraqi anti-aircraft fire; the pilots ejected safely and were captured by Iraqi forces. A total of 22 Italian Tornados were deployed in the NATO-organised Operation Allied Force over Kosovo in 1999; the A-200s served in the bombing role while the EA-200s patrolled the combat region, acting to suppress enemy anti-aircraft radars, firing 115 AGM-88 HARM missiles.

In 2000, with delays to the Eurofighter, the Aeronautica Militare began a search for another interim fighter. While the Tornado was considered, any long term extension to the lease would have involved upgrade to RAF CSP standard and thus was not considered cost effective. In February 2001, Italy announced its arrangement to lease 35 F-16s from the United States under the PEACE CAESAR programme. The Aeronautica Militare returned its Tornado ADVs to the RAF, with the final aircraft arriving at RAF St Athan on 7 December 2004. One aircraft was retained for static display purposes at the Italian Air Force Museum.

In July 2002, Italy signed a contract with the Tornado Management Agency (NETMA) and Panavia for the upgrading of 18 A-200s, the first of which was received in 2003. The upgrade introduced improved navigation systems (integrated GPS and laser INS) and the ability to carry new weapons, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile, Joint Direct Attack Munition and Paveway III laser-guided bombs.
In response to anticipated violence during the 2010 Afghanistan elections, Italy, along with several other nations, increased its military commitment in Afghanistan, dispatching four A-200 Tornados to the region. Italy has opted to extend the Tornado&#x27;s service life at the expense of alternative ground-attack aircraft such as the AMX International AMX; in 2010 a major upgrade and life extension programme was initiated, to provide new digital displays, Link 16 communications capability, night-vision goggles compatibility, and several other upgrades. In the long term, it is planned to replace the Tornado IDS/ECR fleet in Italian service with the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, with the final Italian Tornado scheduled to be phased out in 2025. The Aeronautica Militare received its first of an eventual 15 upgraded Tornado EA-200s on 15 June 2013.

Italian Tornado A-200 and EA-200 aircraft participated in the enforcement of a UN no-fly zone during the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Various coalition aircraft operated from bases in Italy, including RAF Tornados. Italian military aircraft delivered a combined 710 guided bombs and missiles during the strikes against Libyan targets. Of these Aeronautica Militare Tornados and AMX fighter-bombers released 550 guided bombs and missiles, and Italian Navy AV-8Bs delivered 160 guided bombs. Italian Tornados launched 20 to 30 Storm Shadow cruise missiles with the rest consisting of Paveway and JDAM guided bombs.

On 19 August 2014, two Aeronautica Militare Tornados collided in mid-air during a training mission near Ascoli. On 14 November 2014, Italy announced it was sending four Tornado aircraft with 135 support staff to Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base and to two other bases in Kuwait in participation of coalition operations against the Islamic State. The four aircraft will be used for reconnaissance missions only.

In October 2018, it was announced that the EA-200 Tornado had successfully completed operational testing of the AGM-88E AARGM, providing capabilities of an &quot;expanded target set, counter-shutdown capability, advanced signals processing for improved detection and locating, geographic specificity, and a weapon impact-assessment broadcast capability.&quot;

===Royal Air Force===
Nicknamed the &quot;Tonka&quot; by the British, their first prototype (&quot;XX946&quot;) made its maiden flight on 30 October 1974 from BAC Warton. The first full production Tornado GR1 (&quot;ZA319&quot;) flew on 10 July 1979 from Warton. The first RAF Tornados (&quot;ZA320&quot; and &quot;ZA322&quot;) were delivered to the TTTE at RAF Cottesmore on 1 July 1980. Crew that qualified from the TTTE went onto the Tornado Weapons Conversion Unit (TWCU), which formed on 1 August 1981 at RAF Honington, before being posted to a front-line squadron. No. IX (B) Squadron became the first front-line squadron in the world to operate the Tornado when it reformed on 1 June 1982, having received its first Tornado GR1 &quot;ZA586&quot; on 6 January 1982. No. IX (B) Squadron was declared strike combat ready to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) in January 1983. Two more squadrons were formed at RAF Marham in 1983 – No. 617 Squadron on 1 January and No. 27 Squadron on 12 August. The first RAF Tornado GR1 loss was on 27 September 1983 when &quot;ZA586&quot; suffered complete electrical failure and crashed. Navigator Flt. Lt. Nigel Nickles ejected but the pilot Sqn. Ldr. Michael Stephens died in the crash after ordering ejection. In January 1984, the TWCU became No. 45 (Reserve) Squadron.

RAF Germany (RAFG) began receiving Tornados after the formation of No. XV (Designate) Squadron on 1 September 1983 at RAF Laarbruch followed by No. 16 (Designate) Squadron in January 1984 (who were both Blackburn Buccaneer squadrons). They were then joined by No. 20 (Designate) Squadron in May 1984 (who were operating the SEPECAT Jaguar GR1 from RAF Brüggen). Unlike the Tornado squadrons based in the UK which were under control of the British military, those stationed in RAFG were under the control of SACEUR, with the aircraft on Quick Reaction Alert (Nuclear), &quot;QRA (N)&quot;, being equipped with the WE.177 nuclear bomb. In the event of the Cold War going &#x27;hot&#x27;, the majority of RAFG Tornado squadrons were tasked with destroying Warsaw Pact airfields and surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites in East Germany. While No. 20 Squadron was given a separate responsibility of destroying bridges over the rivers Elbe and Weser to prevent Warsaw Pact forces from advancing. By early 1985, Nos. XV, 16 and 20 Squadrons at RAF Laarbruch had been declared strike combat ready to SACEUR.
Tornados began to arrive at RAF Brüggen in September 1984 with the formation of No. 31 (Designate) Squadron. No. 17 (Designate) Squadron was formed in December 1984, with the two Brüggen squadrons joined by No. 14 (Designate) Squadron in mid-1985. No. IX (B) Squadron relocated from RAF Honington to RAF Brüggen on 1 October 1986, arriving in a diamond nine formation. The outcome of the Reykjavík Summit in October 1986 between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev led the end of QRA (Nuclear) for the Tornado force. By the end of 1986, the Tornado GR1 fleet had been equipped with a Laser Ranger and Marked Target Seeker (LRMTS) under the nose, and had begun to be equipped with the BOZ-107 chaff and flare dispenser.

The Tornado made its combat debut as part of Operation Granby, the British contribution to the Gulf War in 1991. This saw 49 RAF Tornado GR1s deploy to Muharraq Airfield in Bahrain and to Tabuk Air Base and Dhahran Airfield in Saudi Arabia. 18 Tornado F3s were deployed to provide air cover, the threat of their long range missiles being a deterrent to Iraqi pilots, who would avoid combat when approached. Early on in the conflict, the GR1s targeted military airfields across Iraq, deploying a mixture of unguided bombs in loft-bombing attacks and specialised JP233 runway denial weapons. On 17 January 1991, the first Tornado to be lost was shot down by an Iraqi SA-16 missile following a failed low-level bombing run. On 19 January, another RAF Tornado was shot down during an intensive raid on Tallil Air Base. The impact of the Tornado strikes upon Iraqi airfields is difficult to determine. A total of six RAF Tornados were lost in the conflict, four while delivering unguided bombs, one after delivering JP233, and one trying to deliver laser-guided bombs.

The UK sent a detachment of Blackburn Buccaneer aircraft equipped with Westinghouse Electric Corporation Pave Spike laser designators, allowing Tornado GR1s to drop precision guided weapons guided by the Buccaneers. A planned programme to fit GR1s with the GEC-Marconi TIALD laser designation system was rapidly accelerated to give the Tornado force the ability to self-designate targets. Author Claus-Christian Szejnmann declared that the TIALD pod enabled the GR1 to &quot;achieve probably the most accurate bombing in the RAF&#x27;s history&quot;. Although laser designation proved effective in the Gulf War, only 23 TIALD pods had been purchased by 2000; shortages hindered combat operations over Kosovo.
After the war&#x27;s opening phase, the GR1s switched to medium-level strike missions; typical targets included munition depots and oil refineries. Only the reconnaissance Tornado GR1As continued flying the low-altitude high-speed profile, emerging unscathed despite the inherent danger in conducting pre-attack reconnaissance. After the conflict, Britain maintained a military presence in the Gulf. Around six GR1s were based at Ali Al Salem airbase in Kuwait, contributing the southern no-fly zone as part of Operation Southern Watch. Six additional GR1s participated in Operation Provide Comfort over Northern Iraq.

The upgraded Tornado GR4 made its operational debut in Operation Southern Watch; patrolling Iraq&#x27;s southern airspace from bases in Kuwait. Both Tornado GR1s and GR4s based at Ali Al Salem, Kuwait, took part in coalition strikes at Iraq&#x27;s military infrastructure during Operation Desert Fox in 1998. In December 1998, an Iraqi anti-aircraft battery fired six to eight missiles at a patrolling Tornado. The battery was later attacked in retaliation, and no aircraft were lost during the incident. It was reported that during Desert Fox RAF Tornados had successfully destroyed 75% of their targets, and out of the 36 missions planned, 28 had been successfully completed.

The GR1 participated in the Kosovo War in 1999. Tornados initially operated from RAF Brüggen, Germany and later from Solenzara Air Base, Corsica. Experiences from Kosovo led to the RAF procuring AGM-65 Maverick missiles and Enhanced Paveway smart bombs for the Tornado. Following the Kosovo War, the GR1 was phased out as aircraft were upgraded to GR4 standard; the final upgrade was returned to the RAF on 10 June 2003.

The GR4 was used in Operation Telic, Britain&#x27;s contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. RAF Tornados flew alongside American aircraft in the opening phase of the war, striking Iraqi targets. Aiming to minimise civilian casualties, Tornados deployed the Storm Shadow cruise missile for the first time. Whilst 25% of the UK&#x27;s air-launched weapons in Kosovo were precision-guided, four years later in Iraq this ratio increased to 85%.
On 23 March 2003, a Tornado GR4 was shot down over Iraq by friendly fire from a US Patriot missile battery, killing both crew members. In July 2003, a US board of inquiry exonerated the battery&#x27;s operators, observing the Tornado&#x27;s &quot;lack of functioning IFF (Identification Friend or Foe)&quot; as a factor in the incident. Problems with Patriot were also suggested as a factor, multiple incidents of mis-identification of friendly aircraft have occurred, including the fatal shootdown of a US Navy F/A-18 a few weeks after the Tornado&#x27;s loss. Britain withdrew the last of its Tornados from Iraq in June 2009.

In early 2009, several GR4s arrived at Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan to replace the British Aerospace Harrier GR7/9 aircraft which had been deployed there since November 2004. In 2009, Paveway IV guided bombs were brought into service on the RAF&#x27;s Tornados, having been previously used in Afghanistan by the Harrier II. In Summer 2010, extra Tornados were dispatched to Kandahar for the duration of the 2010 Afghan election. British Tornados ended operations in Afghanistan in November 2014, having flown over 5,000 pairs sorties over 33,500 hours, including 600 &quot;shows of force&quot; to deter Taliban attacks. During more than 70 engagements, 140 Brimstone missiles and Paveway IV bombs were deployed, and over 3,000 27 mm cannon shells fired.

Prior to the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR)&#x27;s publication, the Tornado&#x27;s retirement was under consideration with savings of £7.5 billion anticipated. The SDSR announced the Tornado would be retained at the expense of the Harrier II, although numbers would decline in the transition to the Eurofighter Typhoon and the F-35 Lightning II. By July 2013, 59 RAF GR4s were receiving the CUSP avionics upgrade, which achieved Initial Service Date (ISD) in March 2013.
On 18 March 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that Tornados and Typhoons would enforce a no-fly zone in Libya. In March 2011, several Tornados flew strike missions against targets inside Libya in what were, according to Defence Secretary Liam Fox, &quot;the longest range bombing mission conducted by the RAF since the Falklands conflict&quot;. A variety of munitions were used during Tornado operations over Libya, including laser-guided bombs and Brimstone missiles.

In August 2014, Tornado GR4s were deployed to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus to support refugees sheltering from Islamic State militants in the Mount Sinjar region of Iraq. The decision came three days after the United States began conducting air attacks against the Islamic State. Tornados were pre-positioned to gather situational awareness in the region. On 27 September 2014, after Parliament approved airstrikes against Islamic State forces inside Iraq, two Tornados conducted their first armed reconnaissance mission in conjunction with coalition aircraft. The next day, two Tornados made the first airstrike on a heavy weapons post and an armoured vehicle, supporting Kurdish forces in northwest Iraq.

By 1 March 2015, eight RAF Tornados had been deployed to Akrotiri and conducted 159 airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq. On 2 December 2015, Parliament approved air strikes in Syria as well as Iraq to combat the growing threat of ISIL; Tornados began bombing that evening. On 14 April 2018, four Tornado GR4s from RAF Akrotiri struck a Syrian military facility with Storm Shadow cruise missiles in response to a suspected chemical attack on Douma by the Syrian regime the previous week.
On 10 July 2018, nine Tornado GR4s from RAF Marham flew over London to celebrate 100 years of the RAF. During late 2018, the RAF commemorated the Tornado&#x27;s service with three special schemes: &quot;ZG752&quot; paid homage to its early years with a green/grey wraparound camouflage; &quot;ZG775&quot; and &quot;ZD716&quot; both wore schemes commemorating the final units to operate the type – No. IX (B) Squadron and No. 31 Squadron respectively. On 31 January 2019, the Tornado GR4 flew its last operational sorties in Operation Shader. The eight Tornados formerly stationed at RAF Akrotiri returned to RAF Marham in early February 2019, their duties assumed by six Typhoons. Between September 2014 and January 2019, RAF Tornados accounted for 31% of the estimated 4,315 casualties inflicted upon ISIL by the RAF during the operation.

To celebrate 40 years of service and to mark the type&#x27;s retirement, several flypasts were carried out on 19, 20 and 21 February 2019 over locations such as BAE Warton, RAF Honington and RAF Lossiemouth. On 28 February, nine Tornados flew out of RAF Marham for a diamond nine formation flypast over a graduation parade at RAF Cranwell before returning and carrying out a series of passes over RAF Marham. On 14 March 2019 the final flight of an RAF Tornado was carried out by Tornado GR4 &quot;ZA463&quot;, the oldest remaining Tornado, over RAF Marham during the disbandment parade of No. IX (B) Squadron and No. 31 Squadron. The Tornado GR4 was officially retired from RAF service on 1 April 2019, the 101st anniversary of the force. Post-retirement, five Tornados returned to RAF Honington via road for the Complex Air Ground Environment (CAGE), which simulates a Tornado flight line for training purposes.

On 2 July 2023, it was reported that pylons from decommissioned RAF Panavia Tornado GR4s had been fitted to Ukrainian Su-24s, so that they could launch the Storm Shadow missile. These Su-24s can carry at least two Storm Shadow missiles at a time. Unlike missiles carried by the Tornado, it was reported, missiles carried by the Su-24 required the coordinates of targets to be entered before takeoff, while the aircraft was on the ground.

===Royal Saudi Air Force===
In 1984, Royal Saudi Air Force pilots visited RAF Honington to fly and evaluate the Tornado GR1. On 25 September 1985, the UK and Saudi Arabia signed the Al Yamamah I contract which included the sale of 48 IDS and 24 ADV Tornadoes. In October 1985, four RSAF crews joined the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment at RAF Cottesmore. The first flight of a Saudi Tornado IDS (&quot;701&quot;) was on 17 February 1986, and the first four IDS were delivered to King Abdul Aziz Air Base, Dharan in 26 March 1986. The first Saudi Tornado squadron formed was No. 7 Squadron, which had received 20 aircraft by 8 October 1987. The first Saudi ADV (&quot;2905&quot;) flew on 1 December 1988, and the first deliveries arrived in Saudi Arabia on 20 March 1989. The first two RSAF ADV squadrons, Nos. 29 and 34 Squadrons, were formed and reached their full strength of 12 aircraft each by 1990.

In the run-up to the Gulf War, the RSAF began to pool its Tornado squadrons together, with the joint 24 aircraft strong ADV unit flying missions as part of Operation Desert Shield. Saudi Tornados took part in the Gulf War, with No. 7 Squadron carrying out their first mission on the night of 17 January 1991. In total, the RSAF flew 665 Tornado IDS sorties and 451 ADV sorties, seeing the loss of one IDS (&quot;765&quot;) on the night of 19/20 January. In June 1993, the Al Yamamah II contract was signed, the main element of which was 48 additional IDSs.

Following experience with both the Tornado and the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle, the RSAF discontinued low-level mission training in the F-15E in light of the Tornado&#x27;s superior low-altitude flight performance. Ten of the Saudi Tornados were fitted with equipment for performing reconnaissance missions. The 22 Tornado ADVs were replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon; the retired aircraft were purchased back by the UK.

By 2007, both the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile and the ALARM anti-radiation missile that previously equipped the RSAF&#x27;s Tornados had been withdrawn from service. As of 2010, Saudi Arabia has signed several contracts for new weapon systems to be fitted to their Tornado and Typhoon fleets, such as the short range air-to-air IRIS-T missile, and the Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles.

In September 2006, the Saudi government signed a contract worth £2.5 billion (US$4.7 billion) with BAE Systems to upgrade up to 80 RSAF Tornado IDS aircraft to keep them in service until 2020. The first RSAF Tornado was returned to BAE Systems Warton in December 2006 for upgrade under the &quot;Tornado Sustainment Programme&quot; (TSP) to &quot;equip the IDS fleet with a range of new precision-guided weapons and enhanced targeting equipment, in many cases common with those systems already fielded by the UK&#x27;s Tornado GR4s.&quot; In December 2007, the first RSAF aircraft to complete modernisation was returned to Saudi Arabia.

Starting from the first week of November 2009, RSAF Tornados, along with Saudi F-15s performed air raids during the Shia insurgency in north Yemen. It was the first time since Operation Desert Storm in 1991 that the RSAF had participated in a military operation over hostile territory. RSAF Tornados are playing a central role in Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen.

On 7 January 2018, Houthi fighters claimed to have shot down a Saudi warplane which was conducting air-raids over northern Yemen. According to Saudi reports, the downed aircraft was an RSAF Tornado which was on a combat mission over Saada province in northern Yemen, it was lost for &#x27;technical reasons&#x27; and both crew were rescued.

On 12 July 2018, another RSAF Tornado crashed in Asir region after returning from Saada, Yemen due to a technical malfunction. On 14 February 2020, a Saudi Tornado was shot down during close air support mission in support of Saudi allied Yemeni forces in the Yemeni Al Jouf governorate by Houthis. On the day after, the Saudi command confirmed the loss of a Tornado, while a video was released showing the downing using a two-stage surface to air missile. Both pilots ejected and were captured by Houthis.

==Variants==

===Tornado IDS===

;Tornado GR1
RAF IDS (interdictor/strike) variants were initially designated the Tornado GR1 with later modified aircraft designated Tornado GR1A, Tornado GR1B, Tornado GR4 and Tornado GR4A. The first of 228 GR1s was delivered on 5 June 1979, and the type entered service in the early 1980s.

;Tornado GR1B
The Tornado GR1B was a specialised anti-shipping variant of the GR1, replacing the Blackburn Buccaneer. 26 aircraft were converted and were based at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland. Each aircraft was equipped to carry up to four Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles. At first the GR1B lacked the radar capability to track shipping, instead relying on the missile&#x27;s seeker for target acquisition; later updates allowed target data to be passed from aircraft to missile.

;Tornado GR1P
A single Tornado GR1 (ZA326, the eighth production aircraft) was re-designated GR1P after being partially rebuilt using parts from different production batches following a fire during engine testing. This aircraft served with the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the Empire Test Pilot&#x27;s School until 2005, when it was retired, being the last GR1 in service anywhere in the world.
;Tornado GR4
The UK Ministry of Defence began studies for a GR1 Mid-Life Update (MLU) in 1984. The update to GR4 standard, approved in 1994, would improve capability in the medium-altitude role based on lessons learned from the GR1&#x27;s performance in the 1991 Gulf War. British Aerospace (later BAE Systems) upgraded 142 Tornado GR1s to GR4 standard, beginning in 1996 and finished in 2003. 59 RAF aircraft later received the CUSP avionics package which integrated the Paveway IV bomb and installed a new secure communications module from Cassidian in Phase A, followed by the Tactical Information Exchange (TIE) datalink from General Dynamics in Phase B.

;Tornado GR1A/GR4A
The GR1A is the reconnaissance variant operated by the RAF and RSAF, fitted with the TIRRS (Tornado Infra-Red Reconnaissance System), replacing the cannon. The RAF ordered 30 GR1As, 14 as GR1 rebuilds and 16 new aircraft. When the Tornado GR1s were upgraded to become GR4s, GR1A aircraft were upgraded to GR4A standard. The switch from low-level operations to medium/high-level operations means that the internal TIRRS was no longer used. As the GR4A&#x27;s internal sensors are no longer essential, the RAF&#x27;s Tactical Reconnaissance Wing operated both GR4A and GR4 aircraft.

=== Tornado ECR===
Operated by Germany and Italy, the ECR (Electronic Combat / Reconnaissance) is a Tornado variant devoted to Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions. It was first delivered on 21 May 1990. The ECR has sensors to detect radar usage and is equipped with anti-radiation AGM-88 HARM missiles. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s 35 ECRs were delivered new, while Italy received 16 converted IDSs. Italian Tornado ECRs differ from the Luftwaffe aircraft as they lack built-in reconnaissance capability and use RecceLite reconnaissance pods. Only Luftwaffe ECRs are equipped with the RB199 Mk.105 engine, which has a higher thrust rating. The German ECRs do not carry a cannon. The RAF used the IDS version in the SEAD role instead of the ECR and also modified several of its Tornado F.3s to undertake the mission.

===Tornado ADV===

The Tornado ADV (air defence variant) was an interceptor variant of the Tornado, developed for the RAF (designated Tornado F2 or F3) and also operated by Saudi Arabia and Italy. The ADV had inferior agility to fighters like the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, but was not intended as a dogfighter, rather as a long-endurance interceptor to counter the threat from Cold War bombers. Although the ADV had 80% parts commonality with the Tornado IDS, the ADV had greater acceleration, improved RB199 Mk.104 engines, a stretched body, greater fuel capacity, the AI.24 Foxhunter radar, and software changes. It had only one cannon to accommodate a retractable inflight refuelling probe.

<doc id="168687" wikidata="Q147367" url="?curid=168687" title="Hey, Slavs">
<text>&quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; is a patriotic song dedicated to the Slavs and widely considered to be the Pan-Slavic anthem. It was adapted and adopted as the national anthem of various Slavic-speaking nations, movements and organizations during the late 19th and 20th century.

Its lyrics were first written in 1834 under the title &quot;Hey, Slovaks&quot; (&quot;Hej, Slováci&quot;) by Samo Tomášik and it has since served as the anthem of the Pan-Slavic movement, the organizational anthem of the Sokol movement, and the national anthems of the First Slovak Republic, SFR Yugoslavia, and Serbia and Montenegro. It was composed to the tune of &quot;Mazurek Dąbrowskiego&quot; from 1797, which was adopted as the national anthem of Poland in 1926, but the Yugoslav variation has a slower tempo, is more accentuated, and does not repeat the last four lines as it repeats the last two lines. The composer is unknown, although modern renditions of the song often used a World War II-era arrangement by Oskar Danon.

==Etymology==
In Serbo-Croatian, which uses both the Latin and the Cyrillic alphabets, the song had been titled as (in Croatian and in Serbian standard, respectively):
* or (in Latin)
* or (in Cyrillic)

In Macedonian the song&#x27;s title is &quot;Ej, Sloveni&quot; (Cyrillic: ), and in Slovene, it is &quot;Hej, Slovani&quot;. The original title in Slovak was &quot;Hej, Slováci&quot;.

==Slovakia==

The song was written initially in Czech by the Slovak Lutheran minister Samuel Tomášik while he was visiting Prague in 1834. He was appalled that German was more commonly heard in the streets of Prague than Czech. He wrote in his diary: 

:&quot;If mother Prague, the pearl of the Western Slavic world, is to be lost in a German sea, what awaits my dear homeland, Slovakia, which looks to Prague for spiritual nourishment? Burdened by that thought, I remembered the old Polish song &quot;Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła, kiedy my żyjemy&quot; (&quot;Poland has not yet perished as long as we live.&quot;). That familiar melody caused my heart to erupt with a defiant &quot;Hej, Slováci, ešte naša slovenská reč žije&quot; (&quot;Hey, Slovaks, our Slovak language still lives&quot;)... I ran to my room, lit a candle and wrote down three verses into my diary in pencil. The song was finished in a moment.&quot; &quot;(Diary of Samuel Tomášik, Sunday, 2 November 1834)&quot;

Tomášik left the instructions for his song to be performed to the melody of &quot;Dąbrowski&#x27;s Mazurka&quot;: &quot;It be sung as: &quot;Poland has not yet perished&quot;&quot;.
He soon altered the lyrics to include all Slavs and &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; became a widely known rallying song for Slav nationalism and Pan-Slavic sentiment, especially in the West Slavic lands governed by Austria. It was printed in numerous magazines and calendars and sung at political gatherings, becoming an unofficial anthem of the Pan-Slavic movement.

Its popularity continued to increase when it was adopted as the organizational anthem of the Sokol (&quot;falcon&quot;) physical education movement, which was based on Pan-Slavic ideals and active across Austria-Hungary. In 1905, the erection of a monument to the Slovene poet France Prešeren in Ljubljana was celebrated by a large gathering of people singing &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot;. During the First World War, the song was often used by Slavic soldiers from opposite sides of the front line to communicate common nationalist sentiment and prevent bloodshed.

In Slovakia, the song &quot;Hey, Slovaks&quot; has been considered the unofficial ethnic anthem of the Slovaks throughout its modern history, especially at times of revolution. Although after the First World War the song &quot;Nad Tatrou sa blýska&quot; became the official Slovak part in the national anthem of Czechoslovakia and then again in 1993 in anthem of independent Slovakia, &quot;Hey, Slovaks&quot; is still considered a &quot;second&quot; national anthem by many (usually more nationalistic) people. Contrary to popular assumption, there was no official state anthem of the clerofascist Slovak Republic (1939–45), though &quot;Hej, Slováci&quot; was used by the ruling party.

==Yugoslavia==

The first appearance of &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; in Yugoslavia was during the Illyrian movement. Dragutin Rakovac translated the song, naming it &quot;Hey, Illyrians&quot; (). Until the Second World War, the translation did not undergo many changes, except that the Illyrians became Slavs.

In 1941 the Second World War engulfed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Axis powers invaded in early April, and the Yugoslav royal army disintegrated and capitulated in just two and a half weeks. Since the old Yugoslav anthem included references to king and kingdom, the anti-royalist Partisan resistance led by Josip Broz Tito and his Communist party decided to avoid it and opted for &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; instead. The song was sung at both the first and second sessions of AVNOJ, the legislative body of the resistance, and it gradually became the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia (new Yugoslavia).

The old state anthem was officially abandoned after liberation in 1945, but no new national anthem to replace it was officially adopted. There were several attempts to promote other, more specifically Yugoslav songs as the national anthem, but none gained much public support and &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; continued to be used unofficially. The search for a better candidate continued up to 1988, while in 1977 the law only named the national anthem as &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; as a temporary state anthem until a new one was adopted, which never happened.

&quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; under its Serbo-Croatian title &quot;&quot; was therefore the national anthem of Yugoslavia for a total of 48 years, from 1943 to 1992. With the formal adoption (inauguration) of Amendment IX to the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the song &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; gained constitutional sanction as the national anthem on November 25, 1988. After 43 years of continued use as the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem, the delegates simply brought the law in line with custom.

==Serbia and Montenegro==
After the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991 and 1992, when only Serbia and Montenegro remained in the federation, &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; continued to be used, as the national anthem of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). Slobodan Milošević wanted to adopt “Hey, Slavs” as the Serbian anthem, but the Main Board of the Socialist Party of Serbia overruled it, feeling that it was inappropriate to reuse it after having assigned it to Yugoslavia, thus they assigned Serbia “March on the Drina” instead. The FRY was renamed to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003 and was expected to adopt a new national anthem, but since no agreement over state symbols could be reached, &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; remained the national anthem of the state. Many Serbs disliked the song during this period and booed it whenever it was played, such as at sporting events and football games.

A hybrid of the Montenegrin folk song (now national anthem) &quot;Oj, svijetla majska zoro&quot; with the former (now current) Serbian national anthem, &quot;Bože Pravde&quot; in alternating verses was proposed (similarly to Czechoslovakia, whose anthem consisted of the Czech part &quot;Kde domov můj&quot; and the Slovak part &quot;Nad Tatrou sa blýska&quot;). However, this attempt was struck down after objections by the People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro and the Socialist People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro. Also proposed was the former Montenegrin national anthem and patriotic song &quot;Onamo, &#x27;namo&quot;, however this also fell through and &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; remained the national anthem. Since Montenegro and Serbia dissolved their union and split to become sovereign states in 2006, this issue is moot, as &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; is no longer used as an official national anthem by any sovereign state. In a way, &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; ended up outliving the countries that used it, as the last instance of it being officially played as part of an event was at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, where the Serbia and Montenegro national football team participated despite the country they were playing for no longer existing (having disbanded a few days before the tournament began).

Even after the end of the federation, &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; was sometimes still mistakenly played by organizers of sports events that involve Serbian teams as a guest side. Notable performances, some of which were intentional, include the 2013 UEFA U-19 Championship semi-final football match between Serbia and Portugal as well as the Olympiacos–Partizan ULEB Champions league basketball game in 2010. In 2015, French organizers of 2015 European Touring Car Cup season erroneously played &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot; when Serbian racing driver Dušan Borković won 1st place at Circuit Paul Ricard.

==In popular culture==
The Yugoslav band Bijelo Dugme recorded a version of the song for their 1984 self-titled album. The Yugoslav and Slovenian band Laibach recorded an electronic version of the song, with lyrics in both English and Slovene, for their 2006 album &quot;Volk&quot;. The song is also featured in the 2002 Slovenian film &quot;Headnoise&quot;.

<text>Transmeta Corporation was an American fabless semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California. It developed low power x86 compatible microprocessors based on a VLIW core and a software layer called Code Morphing Software.

Code Morphing Software (CMS) consisted of an interpreter, a runtime system and a dynamic binary translator. x86 instructions were first interpreted one instruction at a time and profiled, then depending upon the frequency of execution of a code block, CMS would progressively generate more optimized translations.

The VLIW core implemented features specifically designed to accelerate CMS and translations. Among the features were support for general speculation, detection of memory aliasing and detection of self modifying x86 code.

The combination of CMS and the VLIW core allowed for the achievement of full x86 compatibility while maintaining performance and reducing power consumption.

Transmeta was founded in 1995 by Bob Cmelik, Dave Ditzel, Colin Hunter, Ed Kelly, Doug Laird, Malcolm Wing and Greg Zyner.

Its first product, the Crusoe processor, was launched on January 19, 2000. Transmeta went public on November 7, 2000. On October 14, 2003, it launched its second major product, the Efficeon processor. In 2005, Transmeta increased its focus on licensing its portfolio of microprocessor and semiconductor technologies.
 After layoffs in 2007, Transmeta made a complete shift away from semiconductor production to IP licensing.
 In January 2009, the company was acquired by Novafora and the patent portfolio was sold to Intellectual Ventures. Novafora ceased operations in August 2009. Intellectual Ventures licenses the Transmeta IP to other companies on a non-exclusive basis.

Transmeta produced two x86 compatible CPU architectures: Crusoe and Efficeon – internal code names were &#x27;Fred&#x27; and &#x27;Astro&#x27;. These CPUs have appeared in subnotebooks, notebooks, desktops, blade servers, tablet PCs, a personal cluster computer, and a silent desktop, where low power consumption and heat dissipation are of primary importance.

Before the 2009 acquisition by Novafora, Transmeta had moderate success licensing its IP. Licensors for Transmeta technology are Intel (with a perpetual, non-exclusive license to all Transmeta patents and patent applications, including any that Transmeta might acquire before December 31, 2017),
Nvidia (with non-exclusive license to Transmeta&#x27;s &quot;LongRun&quot; and &quot;LongRun2&quot; technologies and other intellectual property),
Sony (LongRun2 licensee),
Fujitsu (LongRun2 licensee)
and NEC (LongRun2 licensee).

== History ==

=== Stealth mode ===

Founded in 1995, Transmeta began as a stealth start-up. The company was largely successful in hiding its ambitions until its official company launch on January 19, 2000. Over 2000 non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were signed during the stealth period. Throughout Transmeta&#x27;s first few years, little was known about exactly what it would be offering. Its web site went online in mid 1997 and for approximately two and a half years displayed nothing but the text, &quot;This web page is not yet here.&quot;

On November 12, 1999, a cryptic comment in the HTML appeared:

Yes, there is a secret message, and this is it: Transmeta&#x27;s policy has been to remain silent about its plans until it had something to demonstrate to the world. On January 19, 2000, Transmeta is going to announce and demonstrate what Crusoe processors can do. Simultaneously, all of the details will go up on this Web site for everyone on the Internet to see. Crusoe will be cool hardware and software for mobile applications. Crusoe will be unconventional, which is why we wanted to let you know in advance to come look at the entire Web site in January, so that you can get the full story and have access to all of the real details as soon as they are available.
Transmeta attempted to staff the company in secret although speculation online was not uncommon. Information gradually came out of the company suggesting it was working on a very long instruction word (VLIW) design that translated x86 code into its own native VLIW code. 

===Open for business===

On January 19, 2000, Transmeta held a launch event at Villa Montalvo in Saratoga, California and announced to the world that it had been working on an x86 compatible dynamic binary translation processor named Crusoe. It also released an 18-page whitepaper describing the technology.

Transmeta marketed their microprocessor technology as extraordinarily innovative and revolutionary in the low-power market segment. They had hoped to be both power and performance leaders in the x86 space but initial reviews of Crusoe indicated the performance fell significantly short of projections. Also, while Crusoe was in development, Intel and AMD significantly ramped up speeds and began to address concerns about power consumption. So Crusoe was rapidly cornered into a low-volume, small form factor (SFF), low-power segment of the market.

On November 7, 2000 (US election day), Transmeta had their initial public offering at the price of $21 a share. The value reached a high of $50.26 before settling down to $46 a share on opening day. This made Transmeta the last of the great high tech IPOs of the dot-com bubble. Their opening day performance would not be surpassed until Google’s IPO in 2004.

The company had its first layoffs in July 2002, reducing the headcount of the company by 40%.

On October 14, 2003, Transmeta announced the Efficeon processor which was claimed to have twice the performance of the original Crusoe CPU at the same frequency. However, performance was still weak relative to the competition and the complexity of the chip had increased significantly. The greater size and power consumption may have diluted a key market advantage Transmeta&#x27;s chips had previously enjoyed over the competition.

In January 2005, the company announced its first strategic restructuring away from being a semiconductor product company and began to focus on licensing intellectual property. In March 2005, Transmeta announced that it was laying off 68 people while retaining 208 employees. Sony was reported to be a key licensee of Transmeta technology and approximately half of the remaining employees were to work on LongRun2 power optimization technology for Sony.

On May 31, 2005, Transmeta announced the signing of asset purchase and license agreements with Hong Kong’s Culture.com Technology Limited. The deal fell apart due to delays in obtaining technology export licenses from the US Department of Commerce and the parties announced the termination of the agreements on February 9, 2006.

On August 10, 2005, Transmeta announced its first-ever profitable quarter. This was followed by GameSpot’s March 20, 2006 report that Transmeta was working on an “unnamed” Microsoft project. As it turned out, this was a secure platform under the AMD brand for Microsoft&#x27;s FlexGo program.

On October 11, 2006, Transmeta announced that they had filed a lawsuit against Intel Corporation for infringement of ten Transmeta U.S. patents covering computer architecture and power efficiency technologies. The complaint charged that Intel had infringed and was infringing Transmeta&#x27;s patents by making and selling a variety of microprocessor products, including at least Intel&#x27;s Pentium III, Pentium 4, Pentium M, Core and Core 2 product line.

On February 7, 2007, Transmeta shut down its engineering services division terminating 75 employees in the process. This was concurrent with an announcement that the company would no longer develop and sell hardware and would focus on the development and licensing of intellectual property. Subsequently, AMD invested $7.5 million in Transmeta, planning to use the company&#x27;s patent portfolio in energy-efficient technologies.

On October 24, 2007, Transmeta announced an agreement to settle its lawsuit against Intel Corporation. Intel agreed to pay $150 million upfront and $20 million per year for five years to Transmeta in addition to dropping its counterclaims against Transmeta. Transmeta also agreed to license several of its patents and assign a small portfolio of patents to Intel as part of the deal.
Transmeta also agreed to never manufacture x86 compatible processors again. One significant sore point in the Intel litigation was the payout of approximately $34M to three of Transmeta&#x27;s executives. In late 2008, Intel and Transmeta reached a further agreement to transfer the $20 million per year in one lump sum.

On August 8, 2008, Transmeta announced that it had licensed its LongRun and low power chip technologies to Nvidia for a one time license fee of $25 million. On November 17, Transmeta announced the signing of a definitive agreement to be acquired by Novafora, a digital video processor company based in Santa Clara, California, for $255.6 million in cash, subject to adjustments dependent on working capital. The deal was finalized on January 28, 2009, when Novafora announced the completion of its acquisition of Transmeta.

Intellectual Venture Funding LLC completed the acquisition of the patent portfolio formerly developed and owned by Transmeta Corporation on February 4, 2009.
Due to financial troubles and inability to execute, Novafora collapsed in late July, 2009.

==Management and staff==
===Corporate governance===
Transmeta had a succession of 6 different chief executive officers who ran the company over its lifetime.

===Notable employees===
Among its crew of technologists, Transmeta employed some of the industry&#x27;s more public figures including Linux founder Linus Torvalds, Linux kernel developer Hans Peter Anvin,
Yacc author Stephen C. Johnson,
and game developer Dave D. Taylor. Partially because of the presence of these figures, the industry was constantly abuzz with rumors and &#x27;conspiracy theories&#x27; resulting in excellent press relations.

==Financial history==
The following charts show the company&#x27;s revenues, operating expenses, gross profits and net losses from 1996 through 2007. Numbers are in 1000s as per the 10-K reports. The company was once named as the &quot;Most important company in Silicon Valley&quot; in an &quot;Upside&quot; magazine editorial but failed to obtain profitability while it was a chip vendor.

===Funding===
Transmeta received a total of $969M in funding during its lifetime.

==Products==

===Crusoe===
&quot;Crusoe&quot; was the first family of microprocessors from Transmeta, named after the literary character Robinson Crusoe.

Transmeta lost much credibility and endured significant criticism due to the large discrepancies between projected performance and power consumption and the actual results. Although power consumption was somewhat better than Intel and AMD offerings, the end user experience (i.e. battery life) only showed a marginal overall improvement. First, the &quot;Code Morphing Software&quot; (CMS) combined with cache architecture artificially inflated comparisons between benchmarks and real-world applications. This is due to the repetitive nature of benchmarks and their small footprints. The CMS software overhead may have actually been a key &quot;cause&quot; of much lower performance for many real-world applications; the simple VLIW core architecture could not compete on computationally intensive applications; and the southbridge interface was limited by its low bandwidth for graphics or other I/O-intensive applications. Some standard benchmarks even failed to run, throwing the claim of full x86 compatibility into doubt.

===Efficeon===

The &quot;Efficeon&quot; processor was Transmeta&#x27;s second-generation 256-bit VLIW processor design. Like the Crusoe (a 128-bit VLIW architecture), Efficeon stressed computational efficiency, low power consumption, and a low thermal footprint.

A 2004-model 1.6-GHz Transmeta Efficeon (manufactured using a 90 nm process) had roughly the same performance and power characteristics as a 1.6-GHz Intel Atom from 2008 (manufactured using a 45 nm process). The Efficeon included an integrated Northbridge, while the competing Atom required an external Northbridge chip, reducing much of the Atom&#x27;s power consumption benefits.

The Transmeta Efficeon processor addressed many of Crusoe&#x27;s shortcomings and showed roughly a 2x real-world improvement over Crusoe. Its die was considerably smaller than Pentium 4 and Pentium M, when compared in the same process technology. Efficeon&#x27;s die fabricated in 90 nm is 68 mm2, which is 60% of the Pentium 4 in 90 nm, at 112 mm2, with both processors possessing a 1 MB L2 cache.

The notion of selling a product into a specific thermal envelope was typically not understood by the mass of reviewers, who tended to compare Efficeon to the gamut of x86 microprocessors, regardless of power consumption or application. One such example of this criticism suggests the performance still significantly lagged behind Intel&#x27;s Pentium M (Banias) and AMD&#x27;s Mobile Athlon XP.

==Implementations==
==Technology==

Transmeta processors were in-order very long instruction word (VLIW) cores running a special dynamic binary translation software layer which together implemented compatibility with the x86 architecture. Transmeta trademarked the term &quot;Code Morphing&quot; to describe their technology and referred to the software layer as Code Morphing Software (CMS).

Transmeta used reverse body bias to reduce power used by a factor of about 2.5. (A similar technology was used in XScale processors.)

===Code Morphing Software===
Code Morphing Software (CMS) is the technology used by Transmeta microprocessors to execute x86 instructions.

In broad view, CMS reads x86 instructions and generates instructions for a proprietary VLIW processor, in the style of Shade.
CMS translation is much more expensive than Shade&#x27;s, but produces much higher quality code. CMS also contains an interpreter and simulates both user-mode and system mode operation.

Code Morphing Software consisted of an interpreter, a runtime system and a dynamic binary translator. x86 instructions were first interpreted one instruction at a time and profiled, then depending upon the frequency of execution and other heuristics, CMS would progressively generate more optimized translations.

Similar technologies existed in the 1990s: Wabi for Solaris and Linux, FX!32 for Alpha and IA-32 EL for Itanium, open-source DAISY, the Mac 68K emulator for the PowerPC. The Transmeta approach set a much higher bar for x86 compatibility due to its ability to execute all x86 instructions from initial boot up to the latest multimedia instructions.

The operation of Transmeta&#x27;s code morphing software is similar to the final optimization pass of a conventional compiler. Considering a fragment of 32-bit x86 code:

 add eax,dword ptr [esp] // load data from stack, add to eax
 add ebx,dword ptr [esp] // ditto, for ebx
 mov esi,[ebp] // load esi from memory
 sub ecx,5 // subtract 5 from ecx register

This is first converted simplistically into native instructions:

 ld %r30,[%esp] // load from stack, into temporary
 add.c %eax,%eax,%r30 // add to %eax, set condition codes.
 ld %r31,[%esp]
 add.c %ebx,%ebx,%r31
 ld %esi,[%ebp]
 sub.c %ecx,%ecx,5

The optimizer then eliminates common sub-expressions and unnecessary condition code operations and, potentially, applies other optimizations such as loop unrolling:

 ld %r30,[%esp] // load from stack only once
 add %eax,%eax,%r30
 add %ebx,%ebx,%r30 // reuse data loaded earlier
 ld %esi,[%ebp]
 sub.c %ecx,%ecx,5 // only this last condition code needed

Finally, the optimizer groups individual instructions (&quot;atoms&quot;) into long instruction words (&quot;molecules&quot;) for the underlying hardware:

 ld %r30,[%esp]; sub.c %ecx,%ecx,5
 ld %esi,[%ebp]; add %eax,%eax,%r30; add %ebx,%ebx,%r30

These two VLIW molecules could potentially execute in fewer cycles than the original instructions could on an x86 processor.

Transmeta claimed several technical benefits to this approach:
# As the market leaders Intel and/or AMD would extend the core x86 instruction set, Transmeta could quickly upgrade their product with a software upgrade rather than requiring a respin of their hardware.
# Performance and power can be tuned in software to meet market needs.
# It would be relatively simple to fix hardware design or manufacturing flaws in the hardware using software workarounds.
# More time could be spent concentrating on enhancing the capabilities of the core or reducing its power consumption without worrying about 33 years of backward compatibility to the x86 architecture.
# The processor could emulate multiple other architectures, possibly even at the same time. (At its initial Crusoe launch, Transmeta demonstrated pico-Java and x86 running intermixed on the native hardware.)

Prior to Crusoe&#x27;s release, rumors indicated Transmeta was relying on these benefits to develop a hybrid PowerPC and x86 processor. But Transmeta would initially concentrate solely on the extremely low-power x86 market.

The ability to quickly update products without a hardware respin was demonstrated in 2002 with an in-the-field upgrade (a download) to enhance CPU performance of the Crusoe based HP Compaq TC1000 tablet PC. It was used again in 2004 when NX bit and SSE3 support were added to the Transmeta Efficeon product line without requiring hardware changes. In the field upgrades were rare in practice due to system hardware vendors not wanting to incur additional customer support costs or spend additional money on QA for the potential upgrades or bug fixes to shipped products they had already closed the revenue books on.

===VLIW core===
In conjunction with its code-morphing software the Efficeon most closely mirrors the feature set of Intel Pentium 4 processors, although, like AMD Opteron processors, it supports a fully integrated memory controller, a HyperTransport IO bus, and the NX bit, or no-execute x86 extension to PAE mode. NX bit support is available starting with CMS version 6.0.4.

Efficeon&#x27;s computational performance relative to mobile CPUs like the Intel Pentium M is thought to be lower, although little appears to be published about the relative performance of these competing processors.

Efficeon came in two package types: a 783- and a 592-contact ball grid array. Its power consumption was moderate (with some consuming as little as 3 watts at 1 GHz and 7 watts at 1.5 GHz), so it could be passively cooled.

Two generations of this chip were produced. The first generation (TM8600) was manufactured using a TSMC 130 nm process and produced at speeds up to 1.1 GHz. The second generation (TM8800 and TM8820) was manufactured using a Fujitsu 90 nm process and produced at speeds ranging from 1 GHz to 1.7 GHz.

Internally, the Efficeon had two arithmetic logic units, two load/store/add units, two execute units, two floating-point/MMX/SSE/SSE2 units, one branch prediction unit, one alias unit, and one control unit. The VLIW core could execute a 256-bit VLIW instruction per cycle. A VLIW is called a molecule and has room to store eight 32-bit instructions (called atoms) per cycle.

The Efficeon had a 128-KB L1 instruction cache, a 64-KB L1 data cache and a 1-MB L2 cache. All caches were on die.

Additionally, Efficeon code morphing software (CMS) reserved a small portion of main memory (typically 32 MB) for its cache of dynamically translated x86 instructions.

===Native compilation===
In principle, it should be possible to optimize x86 code to favor Code Morphing Software, or even for compilers to target the native VLIW architecture directly. However, writing in 2003, Linus Torvalds apparently dismissed these approaches as unrealistic:

Subsequent reverse engineering, published in 2004, clarifies some details of the native VLIW architecture and associated instruction set, and suggests that there are fundamental limitations that preclude porting an operating system such as Linux to it.

The same work also compares Transmeta&#x27;s patented technology with prior art published and in some cases patented by IBM, and suggests that some claims might not stand detailed scrutiny.

<text>The Sum of Us is a 1990 play by David Stevens. It is the third play in his now completed &quot;A Currency Trilogy&quot; of which the first play is &quot;The Inn at the Beginning of the World&quot;. The second play is &quot;The Beast and the Beauty&quot; produced by the Old Mill Theatre, Perth, on 22 June 2012.

==Plot==
The plot revolves around the comfortable relationship between widower Harry and his gay son Jeff and their individual searches for the right mate. Harry unconditionally loves his rugby-playing son and even takes an active part in Jeff&#x27;s search for Mr. Right. Harry reveals that his mother (Jeff&#x27;s grandmother) was a lesbian, perhaps accounting for his accepting attitude toward Jeff. Jeff&#x27;s new boyfriend, Greg, who is closeted from his own homophobic father, finds it difficult to relate to Harry&#x27;s well-meaning matchmaking ways. Greg is ejected from his own home by his father when he discovers his son&#x27;s sexuality. Harry, via a video dating service, finds a woman that he likes, a divorcee named Joyce, who may not be so understanding after spying a gay magazine in Harry and Jeff&#x27;s house. Unfortunately, Harry suffers a massive stroke and is left unable to speak or walk. Jeff cares for him as best as he can, taking him to the park for an outing one day. Jeff and Greg meet up in the park and agree to try and rekindle their romance, while Jeff&#x27;s father, although unable to speak, gives his overwhelming approval.

==Production==
The play, directed by Kevin Dowling, opened on October 16, 1990 at the Off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theatre, where it ran for 335 performances. Tony Goldwyn and Richard Venture headed the cast. The play won the Outer Critics Circle Award for the Outstanding Off-Broadway Play 1990–1991 and Goldwyn won an Obie Award for his performance.

The first production in Australia was in 1992 by the Sydney Theatre Company at the Wharf Studio Theatre with Ron Graham and Peter Phelps. A new production is touring capital cities, regional and remote venues across Australia in 2011. Produced by Christine Harris and HIT Productions, the cast includes one of Australia&#x27;s most well-known television, theatre and film actors John Jarratt, alongside Patrick Harvey, Glenn van Oosterom, and Nell Feeney. Directed by Green Room Awards winner Denis Moore.

==Adaptation==
A 1994 Australian film adaptation also titled The Sum of Us was directed by Dowling and Geoff Burton and starred Russell Crowe and Jack Thompson. The screen adaptation mimics the play&#x27;s device of breaking the fourth wall with direct to camera conversational asides by both Harry and Jeff. Stevens&#x27; screenplay won awards from the Australian Film Institute and the Montreal World Film Festival, and the movie was named Best Film at the Cleveland International Film Festival.

<doc id="168694" wikidata="Q358505" url="?curid=168694" title="Eliot Ness">
<text>Eliot Ness (April 19, 1903 – May 16, 1957) was an American Prohibition agent known for his efforts to bring down Al Capone while enforcing Prohibition in Chicago. He was leader of a team of law enforcement agents nicknamed The Untouchables, handpicked for their incorruptibility. The release of his memoir &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, months after his death, launched several screen portrayals establishing a posthumous fame for Ness as an incorruptible crime fighter.

== Early life ==
Eliot Ness was born on April 19, 1903, in the Roseland neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. He was the youngest of five children born to Peter Ness (1850–1931) and Emma King (1863–1937). His parents, both Norwegian immigrants, operated a bakery. Ness attended Christian Fenger High School in Chicago. He was educated at the University of Chicago, graduating in 1925 with a degree in political science and business administration, and was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He began his career as an investigator for the Retail Credit Company of Atlanta assigned to the Chicago territory, where he conducted background investigations for the purpose of credit information. In 1929, he returned to the university to take a graduate course in criminology taught by August Vollmer, a noted police reformer and chief of the Berkeley Police Department. Vollmer&#x27;s ideas about professionalizing law enforcement would influence Ness throughout his career.

== Career ==

=== 1926–1931 ===

Ness&#x27;s brother-in-law, Alexander Jamie, an agent of the Bureau of Investigation (which became the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935), influenced Ness to enter law enforcement. Ness joined the U.S. Treasury Department in 1926, working with the 1,000-strong Bureau of Prohibition in Chicago.

In March 1930, attorney Frank J. Loesch of the Chicago Crime Commission asked President Herbert Hoover to take down Al Capone. Agents of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, working under Elmer Irey and Special Agent Frank J. Wilson of the Intelligence Unit, were already investigating Capone and his associates for income tax evasion. In late 1930, Attorney General William D. Mitchell, seeking a faster end to the case, implemented a plan devised by President Hoover for sending a small team of Prohibition agents, working under a special United States attorney, to target the illegal breweries and supply routes of Capone while gathering evidence of conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act (informally known as the Volstead Act). U.S. attorney George E.Q. Johnson, the Chicago prosecutor directly in charge of both the Prohibition and income tax investigations of Capone, chose the 27-year-old Ness (now assigned to the Justice Department) to lead this small squad.
With corruption of Chicago&#x27;s law enforcement agents endemic, Ness went through the records of all Prohibition agents to create a reliable team (initially of six, eventually growing to about ten) later known as &quot;The Untouchables.&quot; Raids against illegal stills and breweries began in March 1931. Within six months, Ness&#x27;s agents had destroyed bootlegging operations worth an estimated $500,000 (almost $9.9 million in 2022) and representing an additional $2 million ($39.5 million in 2022) in lost income for Capone; their raids would ultimately cost Capone in excess of $9 million ($178 million in 2022) in lost revenue. The main source of information for the raids was an extensive wiretapping operation.

In 1931, a member of Al Capone&#x27;s gang promised Ness that he would receive $2,000 every week ($36,684.27 in 2022) if he ignored their bootlegging activities. Ness refused the bribe. Failed attempts by members of the Chicago Outfit to bribe or intimidate Ness and his agents inspired Charles Schwarz of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; to begin calling them &quot;untouchables&quot;. George Johnson adopted the nickname and promoted it to the press, establishing it as the squad&#x27;s unofficial title.

The efforts of Ness and his team inflicted major financial damage on Capone&#x27;s operations and led to his indictment on 5,000 violations of the Volstead Act in June 1931. Federal judge James H. Wilkerson prevented that indictment from coming to trial, instead pursuing the tax evasion case built by George Johnson and Frank Wilson. On October 17, 1931, Capone was convicted on three of 22 counts of tax evasion. He was sentenced to eleven years in prison and, following a failed appeal, began his sentence in 1932. On May 3, 1932, Ness was among the federal agents who took Capone from the Cook County Jail to Dearborn Station, where he boarded the Dixie Flyer to the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary—the only time the two men are known to have met in person.

=== 1932–1957 ===
In 1932, Ness was promoted to Chief Investigator of the Prohibition Bureau for Chicago. Following the end of Prohibition in 1933, he was assigned as an alcohol tax agent in the &quot;Moonshine Mountains&quot; of southern Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and in 1934 he was transferred to Cleveland, Ohio. In December 1935, Cleveland mayor Harold H. Burton hired Ness as the city&#x27;s Safety Director, which put him in charge of both the police and fire departments. Ness soon began a reform program inspired by the ideas of August Vollmer, which focused on professionalizing and modernizing the police, stopping juvenile delinquency, and improving traffic safety. He declared war on the mob, and his primary targets included &quot;Big&quot; Angelo Lonardo, &quot;Little&quot; Angelo Scirrca, Moe Dalitz, John Angerola, George Angersola, and Charles Pollizi.

Ness was also Safety Director at the time of the murders known as the Cleveland Torso Murders, occurring in the Cleveland area from 1935 to 1938; though he had oversight of the police department, he was only peripherally involved in the investigation. Ness interrogated one of the prime suspects of the murders, Dr. Francis E. Sweeney, using a polygraph test. At one point, two bodies of the victims of the serial killer were placed within view of Ness&#x27;s office window.

In 1938, Ness and his wife Edna divorced. His otherwise successful career in Cleveland withered gradually. He especially fell out of favor after he had the city&#x27;s large shantytowns evacuated and burned during the Cleveland Torso Murders. Cleveland critics targeted his divorce, his high-profile social drinking, and his conduct in a car accident one night when he was driving drunk. Although there were no victims in the accident, Ness, fearful that he might lose his job, tried to get the accident covered up. Later, his involvement in the accident was revealed by a local newspaper and calls for his resignation increased; however, Burton&#x27;s successor as mayor, Frank Lausche, kept Ness on.

In 1939, Ness married illustrator Evaline Michelow. In 1942, the Nesses moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked for the federal government. He directed the battle against prostitution in communities surrounding military bases, where venereal disease was a serious medical issue. Later he made a number of forays into the corporate world, all of which failed owing to his lack of business acumen. In 1944, he left to become chairman of the Diebold Corporation, a security company based in Ohio.
After his second divorce and third marriage, he ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Cleveland in 1947, after which he left Diebold in 1951. In the aftermath, Ness was forced into taking odd jobs to earn a living, including bookstore clerk and wholesaler of electronics parts and frozen hamburger patties. By 1956, he came to work for a startup company called Guaranty Paper Corporation, which claimed to have a new method of watermarking legal and official documents to prevent counterfeiting. Ness was offered the job because of his expertise in law enforcement and moved from Cleveland to Coudersport, Pennsylvania, where much of the investment capital for the company was located. Now drinking more heavily, Ness spent his free time in a local bar, telling stories of his law enforcement career. Guaranty Paper began to fall apart when it became clear that one of Ness&#x27;s business partners had misrepresented the nature of their supposedly proprietary watermarking process, leaving Ness in serious financial jeopardy.

In later years, Ness struggled financially; he was nearly penniless at the time of his death, with his role in bringing down Al Capone having been largely forgotten.

== Personal life ==
Ness was married to Edna Stahle (1900–1988) from 1929 to 1938, illustrator Evaline Michelow (1911–1986) from 1939 to 1945, and artist Elisabeth Andersen Seaver (1906–1977) from 1946 until his death in 1957. He also had an adopted son, Robert (1946–1976).

== Death ==

Shortly after his approval of the final galleys for &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, on whose writing he and Oscar Fraley had been collaborating as a means, on Ness&#x27; part, of earning money in his later years, Ness collapsed and died of a heart attack at his home in Coudersport, Pennsylvania, on May 16, 1957. He was 54 years of age. His body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in one of the small ponds on the grounds of Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. An admirer later donated a plot near the pond and erected a cenotaph in his honor there.

Ness was survived by his widow, Elisabeth Andersen Seaver, and adopted son, Robert.

== Legacy ==

=== Archive ===
The Western Reserve Historical Society houses additional Ness papers, including a scrapbook (1928–1936), copies of newspaper clippings (1935–1950), a typewritten manuscript detailing Ness&#x27;s career in Chicago, and miscellaneous papers, including a report on the Fidelity Check Corporation and Guaranty Paper, of which Ness was president.

=== Art, entertainment, and media ===
Numerous media works have been developed based on Eliot Ness&#x27;s life and the legend surrounding his work in Chicago. The first of these resulted in Ness&#x27;s last years in collaboration with Oscar Fraley in writing the book &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1957), which was published after Ness&#x27;s death and went on to sell 1.5 million copies. Although the historical veracity of this book has been questioned, later research suggests that it is broadly accurate. A 21-page manuscript that Ness wrote for the book is housed in the archives of the Western Reserve Historical Society in Cleveland, Ohio.
The book was adapted in multiple media and inspired many additional works. The best-known adaptations include the 1959 TV series &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, which starred Robert Stack as Ness and was narrated by Walter Winchell, and the 1987 film &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, directed by Brian De Palma, which starred Kevin Costner as Ness, Sean Connery and Robert De Niro as Al Capone. These two fictionalized portrayals, more than actual history, have inspired numerous novels; a TV-movie, &quot;The Return of Eliot Ness&quot;, in which Stack returned to the role; a second, short-lived 1993 TV series titled &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, which starred Tom Amandes as Ness and William Forsythe as Capone; stage plays such as Peter Ullian&#x27;s &quot;In the Shadow of the Terminal Tower&quot;; and comic books such as &quot;Torso&quot;. Ness was portrayed by actor Jim True-Frost in the fifth-season episode &quot;The Good Listener&quot; of the HBO television series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;.

Max Allan Collins used Ness as the &quot;police contact/best friend&quot; character in his series of historical private eye novels featuring Chicago detective Nate Heller. Later he spun Ness off into his own series, set during his tenure as Cleveland&#x27;s Public Safety Director. The first book, &quot;The Dark City&quot; (1987), depicted Ness&#x27;s getting hired and undertaking a cleanup of the graft-ridden police force; the second, &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Dozen&quot; (1988), his pursuit of the serial killer known as the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run. &quot;Bullet Proof&quot; (1989) pitted Ness against labor racketeers intent on taking over Cleveland&#x27;s food service industry. Ness is mentioned in many hip hop and rap tracks (&quot;California Love&quot;, for example). &quot;Murder by the Numbers&quot; (1993) depicted Ness&#x27;s investigation of the numbers racket in Cleveland. All of these novels, while fictionalized, were closely based on actual cases investigated by Ness and the Cleveland Police. Collins also wrote a one-man stage play, &quot;Eliot Ness – An Untouchable Life&quot;, which was nominated for an Edgar Award. Collins wrote Ness into his graphic novel &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;.

In 2018, Collins collaborated with historian A. Brad Schwartz on a nonfiction dual biography of Ness and Capone entitled &quot;Scarface and the Untouchable: Al Capone, Eliot Ness, and the Battle for Chicago.&quot; Collins&#x27;s and Schwartz&#x27;s second volume about Ness&#x27;s years in Cleveland, entitled &quot;Eliot Ness and the Mad Butcher, was published in 2020.&quot;

In &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;, Frederick Weller portrayed a young Elliot Ness in the eleventh episode &quot;The Mystery of the Blues&quot;. In the episode, he is portrayed as the roommate of Indiana Jones at the University of Chicago.

The video game called &quot;The Untouchables&quot; was released in 1989 by Ocean Software on ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX, Atari ST, Amiga, DOS, NES, and SNES.

Ness is mentioned by FBI agent Jimmy Woo as his idol growing up in episode 4 of &quot;We Interrupt This Program&quot; (release date: January 29, 2021) of Disney+ miniseries WandaVision.

=== Beer ===
Cleveland-based Great Lakes Brewing Company, which claims several connections to Ness (including the brewery owners&#x27; mother having worked as his stenographer), named an amber lager &quot;Eliot Ness&quot; and included several subtle nods to his career in the beer description and label art.

=== Proposed building naming ===

On January 10, 2014, Illinois U.S. Senators Dick Durbin and Mark Kirk and Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown proposed naming the headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Washington, D.C., after Ness. If approved, it would have been called the Eliot Ness ATF Building. Brown said in a statement: &quot;Eliot Ness is perhaps best known as the man who helped to bring Al Capone to justice. But Eliot Ness was more than just a Chicago U.S. prohibition agent. He fought for law and justice in Ohio, and fought for peace and freedom in World War II. He was a public servant and an American hero who deserves to be remembered.&quot;

Chicago Aldermen Edward M. Burke (14th Ward) and James Balcer (11th Ward) introduced a resolution in the Chicago City Council to oppose the renaming. In a news release, Burke said: &quot;Eliot Ness had a checkered career after leaving the federal government. I simply do not think his image matches the actual reality of his legacy.&quot;
The authors of two separate Ness biographies later disputed the accuracy of Burke&#x27;s claims, suggesting he mischaracterized Ness&#x27;s career. &quot;If Hollywood has given Eliot Ness too much credit for getting Capone,&quot; Max Allan Collins wrote in an article for &quot;HuffPost&quot;, &quot;he has received too little credit anywhere else for helping professionalize law enforcement in the mid-20th Century.&quot;

Although the Senate resolution was never adopted, the main atrium in the ATF headquarters building was later renamed for Eliot Ness and features a historical exhibit about the Untouchables.

=== Festival and museum ===
Coudersport, Pennsylvania, the town where Ness spent his final months and died, has held an annual &quot;Eliot Ness Festival&quot; every third weekend in July since 2018. Past events have included a public reunion of people descended from the original Untouchables, a dramatization of Al Capone&#x27;s trial, film screenings, author talks, and antique car shows.

In 2019, an &quot;Eliot Ness Museum&quot; inspired by the annual festival opened in downtown Coudersport, featuring several antique cars and exhibits describing Ness&#x27;s life and career.

<text>Jingo is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the 21st book in his &quot;Discworld&quot; series. It was published in 1997.

==Plot==
The island of Leshp, which had been submerged under the Circle Sea for centuries, rises to the surface. Its position, exactly halfway between Ankh-Morpork and Al Khali (the capital of Klatch), makes the island a powerful strategical point for whoever lays claim to it, which both cities do.

In Ankh-Morpork, a Klatchian Prince named Khufurah is parading through Ankh-Morpork, where he will be presented with a Degree in Sweet Fanny Adams (Doctorum Adamus cum Flabello Dulci), but is wounded in an assassination attempt. Sir Samuel Vimes, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, suspects both a Klatchian named 71-Hour Ahmed and a senior Morporkian peer, Lord Rust, of involvement.

The attempted assassination breaks off relations between Ankh-Morpork and Klatch as Prince Khufurah&#x27;s brother, Prince Cadram, effectively declares war on the city of Ankh-Morpork. At this point, Havelock Vetinari, Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, resigns and Lord Rust takes command of the city. Vetinari refused to become involved in the war with Klatch since Ankh-Morpork does not have an army, but Rust declares martial law and orders the city&#x27;s noble families to revive their old private regiments.

Vimes, refusing to follow Rust, stands down as Commander of the Watch. Captain Carrot resigns as well, as do Sergeant Colon, Sergeant Detritus and Corporal Angua. Vimes then recruits the Watch into his own private army regiment, reasoning that, as an official noble, he is entitled to do so by law and by Lord Rust&#x27;s command, with the group remaining independent as knights legally fall under command of the king or his duly appointed representatives, neither of which exist in Ankh-Morpork.

Angua, following 71-Hour Ahmed, is captured by the Klatchians and taken to Klatch. Carrot, rather than rush off to save her, reports back to Vimes, who gets his private army to head for Klatch. Meanwhile, Nobby and Sergeant Colon have been recruited by Vetinari and his pet inventor, Leonard of Quirm, on a secret mission of their own, unknown to Vimes.

Vetinari, Leonard of Quirm, Colon, and Nobby end up in Leonard&#x27;s &quot;Going-Under-the-Water-Safely Device&quot; and discover that Leshp is actually floating on top of a huge bubble of gas, and that the gas is escaping from said bubble, meaning that Leshp will ultimately sink back under the sea again.

Vimes catches up with 71-hour Ahmed and has, by this time, figured out that Ahmed is a fellow policeman. Ahmed tells Vimes that Prince Cadram was responsible for the assassination attempt on Prince Khufurah. Ahmed and his band of Klatchian D&#x27;regs and Vimes&#x27; army head towards Gebra, in Klatch, where the war is due to start.

To blend in, Vetinari, Nobby and Fred Colon get hold of some Klatchian clothing, though Nobby ends up wearing the costume of a dancing girl and gets in touch with his feminine side. The three head to Gebra, where they discover that Carrot has convinced the two armies to get together and play a game of football, Vimes is preparing to arrest both Klatchian Prince Cadram and Lord Rust for various breaches of the peace (such as being prepared for war), and 71-hour Ahmed is supporting him. Vetinari prevents an international incident by the surrender of Ankh-Morpork and offering war reparations, to be ratified on Leshp in one week.

Vetinari is returned to Ankh-Morpork, under arrest and in disgrace, but as Leshp has vanished back under the sea again, the treaty was to be signed in a non-existent territory and thus the charge of treason is invalid. Seeing he has been tricked, and with the people and generals turning against him, Prince Cadram flees, with 71-hour Ahmed in pursuit. His brother Khufurah recovers and assumes control of Klatch. Vimes is informed that Vetinari has been &quot;reminded&quot; that the old rank of Commander was the same as the old rank of Duke. He objects, claiming that only a King can make a Duke, but then realises that Carrot was speaking to Vetinari. Since Carrot is, of course, very much &quot;not&quot; the King of Ankh-Morpork his reminding of Vetinari is all that is required for Vimes to get his new position and rank. However, Vimes later attempts to get out of his own investiture ceremony half-way through by giving chase to an apprentice thief.

Vimes &quot;accidentally&quot; loses his &quot;dis-organiser&quot; (given to him by his wife) which kept giving him incorrect information. It is explained that, had Vimes reacted slightly differently in the beginning—staying in Ankh-Morpork rather than attempting to follow Ahmed and rescue Angua—the Morporkian-Klatchian war would have resulted in the invasion of Ankh-Morpork and the deaths of the entire Watch.

==Reception==
In &quot;Interzone&quot;, John Clute described &quot;Jingo&quot; as fitting &quot;seamlessly&quot; into the Discworld, commenting that it does not &quot;dishonour its predecessors in the series&quot; and &quot;is in fact better than most of them&quot;. Clute also compared Pratchett&#x27;s writing to that of P. G. Wodehouse, and noted the presence of &quot;totemic moments&quot;, and of several scenes which he felt to be &quot;homilies&quot;.

&quot;Escape Pod&quot; stated that a significant portion of the plot is &quot;Vimes subverting the status quo in ways that shouldn&#x27;t work, but somehow do anyway&quot;. The &quot;SF Site&quot; ranked it &quot;above &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; but not quite as good as &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;&quot;, considering that &quot;The story stumbles a bit, especially once the action moves to Klatch, and there are few nitpicky things here and there&quot;, but concluding that it is nonetheless &quot;a fine addition&quot; to the Discworld.

<text>William Ellery Channing (April 7, 1780 – October 2, 1842) was the foremost Unitarian preacher in the United States in the early nineteenth century and, along with Andrews Norton (1786–1853), one of Unitarianism&#x27;s leading theologians. Channing was known for his articulate and impassioned sermons and public speeches, and as a prominent thinker in the liberal theology of the day. His religion and thought were among the chief influences on the New England Transcendentalists although he never countenanced their views, which he saw as extreme. His espousal of the developing philosophy and theology of Unitarianism was displayed especially in his &quot;Baltimore Sermon&quot; of May5, 1819, given at the ordination of the theologian and educator Jared Sparks (1789–1866) as the first minister of the newly organized First Independent Church of Baltimore.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Channing, the son of William Channing and Lucy Ellery, was born April7, 1780, in Newport, Rhode Island. He was a grandson of William Ellery (1727–1820), a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, Deputy Governor of Rhode Island, Chief Justice, and influential citizen. As a child, he was cared for by the formerly enslaved woman Duchess Quamino, who later influenced his views on abolitionism. He became a New England liberal, rejecting the Calvinist doctrines of total depravity and divine election.

Channing enrolled at Harvard College at a troubled time, particularly because of the recent French Revolution. He later wrote of these years:

Graduating first in his class in 1798, he was elected commencement speaker though he was prohibited by the Harvard College faculty from mentioning the Revolution and other political subjects in his address.

===As Theologian===
In opposition to traditional American Calvinist orthodoxy, Channing preferred a gentle, loving relationship with God. He opposed Reformed Christianity for

Channing&#x27;s inner struggle continued through two years during which he lived in Richmond, Virginia, working as a tutor for David Meade Randolph. He came to his definitive faith only through much spiritual turmoil and difficulty. Channing was called as pastor of the Federal Street Church in Boston in 1803, where he remained for the rest of his life. He lived through the increasing tension between religious liberals and conservatives and took a moderate position, rejecting the extremes of both groups. In 1809 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1815, Channing engaged in a noted controversy on the principles of Unitarianism with Samuel Worcester, (1770–1821). A review of a pamphlet on American Unitarianism (&quot;American Unitarianism; or a Brief History of the Progress and Present State of the Unitarian Churches of America&quot;), attributed to Jeremiah Evarts, was published in &quot;The Panoplist&quot; in June 1815. Channing objected to the way Unitarians in the United States were portrayed in the review. Worcester replied to this objection, and an exchange of pamphlets followed.

Notwithstanding his moderate position, Channing later became the primary spokesman and interpreter of Unitarianism, after sixteen years at Boston&#x27;s Federal Street Church. He was invited to come south again to Maryland to preach the ordination sermon of the future noted educator and theologian Jared Sparks (1789–1866), the first minister (1819–1823) called to the newly organized congregation (1817) in Baltimore known as the First Independent Church of Baltimore (located at West Franklin and North Charles Streets, in a landmark two-year-old structure designed by noted French émigré architect J. Maximilian M. Godefroy), later known, after a merger with Second Universalist Church in 1935, as the First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Universalist), which was forever after known as &quot;The Baltimore Sermon&quot;. The sermon, or address, was given on Wednesday, May5, 1819, and was entitled &quot;Unitarian Christianity&quot;. In it, he explicated the distinctive tenets of the developing Unitarian movement, one of which was the rejection of the Trinity. Other important tenets were the belief in human goodness and the subjection of theological ideas to the light of reason. (The anniversary of the address is celebrated and observed annually by the Maryland churches of the Unitarian Universalist Association and its Joseph Priestley District as &quot;Union Sunday&quot;, with occasional ecumenical guests from other Christian bodies.) Based on these sermons, writer and critic John Neal in his 1824–25 critical work &quot;American Writers&quot; called Channing one of the best preachers in the country. He said: &quot;Such of his writings as have been published are remarkable for simplicity, clearness, and power.&quot;

In 1828, he gave another famous ordination sermon, entitled &quot;Likeness to God&quot;. The idea of the human potential to be like God, which Channing advocated as grounded firmly in scripture, was seen as heretical by the Calvinist religious establishment of his day. It is in this address that Channing first advocated the possibility for revelation through reason rather than solely from Scripture. &quot;American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia&quot; classes him as one of several figures who &quot;took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world.&quot;

Even at the end of his life he adhered to the non-Socinian belief in the preexistence of Christ:

===Later years===

In later years, Channing addressed the topic of slavery although he was never an ardent abolitionist. Channing wrote a book in 1835 entitled &quot;Slavery.&quot; Channing has, however, been described as a romantic racist. He held a common American belief about the inferiority of African people and slaves and held a belief that once freed, Africans would need overseers. The overseers (largely former slave masters) were necessary because the slaves would lapse into laziness. Furthermore, he did not join the abolitionist movement because he did not agree with their way of conducting themselves, and he felt that voluntary associations limited a person&#x27;s autonomy. Therefore, he often chose to remain separate from organizations and reform movements. This middle position characterized his attitude about most questions although his eloquence and strong influence on the religious world incurred the enmity of many extremists. Channing had an enormous influence over the religious (and social) life of New England, and America, in the nineteenth century.

Toward the end of his life, Channing embraced immediate abolitionism. His evolving view of abolitionism was fostered by the success of British abolition in the British West Indies in 1834 and the absence of the expected social and economic upheaval in the post-emancipated Caribbean.

In 1837, Channing published a pamphlet, in the form of an open letter to Senator Henry Clay, opposing the annexation of Texas, arguing that the revolution there was &quot;criminal.&quot;

Channing wrote extensively about the emerging new national literature of the United States, saying that national literature is &quot;the expression of a nation&#x27;s mind in writing&quot;, and &quot;the concentration of intellect for the purpose of spreading itself abroad and multiplying its energy&quot;.

===Death===
Channing died in Old Bennington, Vermont, where a cenotaph is placed in his memory. He is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==

* Named in his honor, the Channing Home was founded by Harriet Ryan Albee in 1857 in the vestry of Channing&#x27;s Federal Street Church.
* In 1880, a young Unitarian minister in Newport, Charles Timothy Brooks, published a biography, &quot;William Ellery Channing, A Centennial Memory&quot;.
* The Channing Memorial Church was built in Newport, Rhode Island in 1880 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth.
* A bronze statue of Channing by William Clark Noble was erected in 1892 in Newport&#x27;s Touro Park across from the Channing Memorial Church.
* A bronze statue of Channing by Herbert Adams was erected in 1903 on the edge of the Boston Public Garden, at Arlington St. and Boylston St. It stands across the street from the Arlington Street Church that he served (and from the Federal Street Church).
* A portrait of him also hangs in the foyer of the First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Universalist) at North Charles and West Franklin Streets in Baltimore, Maryland, along with the aforementioned &quot;Union Sunday&quot; annual commemoration services in May.
*Channing School, an independent day school for girls at Highgate Hill in Highgate, North London, originally founded in 1885 for the daughters of Unitarian ministers, was named after him.
* Channing had a profound impact on the Transcendentalism movement though he never officially subscribed to its views. However, two of Channing&#x27;s nephews, Ellery Channing (1818–1901) and William Henry Channing (1810–1884), became prominent members of the movement.

<text>In computing, Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a standard application programming interface (API) for accessing database management systems (DBMS). The designers of ODBC aimed to make it independent of database systems and operating systems. An application written using ODBC can be ported to other platforms, both on the client and server side, with few changes to the data access code.

ODBC accomplishes DBMS independence by using an &quot;ODBC driver&quot; as a translation layer between the application and the DBMS. The application uses ODBC functions through an &quot;ODBC driver manager&quot; with which it is linked, and the driver passes the query to the DBMS. An ODBC driver can be thought of as analogous to a printer driver or other driver, providing a standard set of functions for the application to use, and implementing DBMS-specific functionality. An application that can use ODBC is referred to as &quot;ODBC-compliant&quot;. Any ODBC-compliant application can access any DBMS for which a driver is installed. Drivers exist for all major DBMSs, many other data sources like address book systems and Microsoft Excel, and even for text or comma-separated values (CSV) files.

ODBC was originally developed by Microsoft and Simba Technologies during the early 1990s, and became the basis for the Call Level Interface (CLI) standardized by SQL Access Group in the Unix and mainframe field. ODBC retained several features that were removed as part of the CLI effort. Full ODBC was later ported back to those platforms, and became a de facto standard considerably better known than CLI. The CLI remains similar to ODBC, and applications can be ported from one platform to the other with few changes.

==History==

===Before ODBC===
The introduction of the mainframe-based relational database during the 1970s led to a proliferation of data access methods. Generally these systems operated together with a simple command processor that allowed users to type in English-like commands, and receive output. The best-known examples are SQL from IBM and QUEL from the Ingres project. These systems may or may not allow other applications to access the data directly, and those that did use a wide variety of methodologies. The introduction of SQL aimed to solve the problem of &quot;language&quot; standardization, although substantial differences in implementation remained.

Since the SQL language had only rudimentary programming features, users often wanted to use SQL within a program written in another language, say Fortran or C. This led to the concept of Embedded SQL, which allowed SQL code to be &quot;embedded&quot; within another language. For instance, a SQL statement like codice_1 could be inserted as text within C source code, and during compiling it would be converted into a custom format that directly called a function within a library that would pass the statement into the SQL system. Results returned from the statements would be interpreted back into C data formats like codice_2 using similar library code.

There were several problems with the Embedded SQL approach. Like the different varieties of SQL, the Embedded SQLs that used them varied widely, not only from platform to platform, but even across languages on one platform – a system that allowed calls into IBM Db2 would look very different from one that called into their own SQL/DS. Another key problem to the Embedded SQL concept was that the SQL code could only be changed in the program&#x27;s source code, so that even small changes to the query required considerable programmer effort to modify. The SQL market referred to this as &quot;static SQL&quot;, versus &quot;dynamic SQL&quot; which could be changed at any time, like the command-line interfaces that shipped with almost all SQL systems, or a programming interface that left the SQL as plain text until it was called. Dynamic SQL systems became a major focus for SQL vendors during the 1980s.

Older mainframe databases, and the newer microcomputer based systems that were based on them, generally did not have a SQL-like command processor between the user and the database engine. Instead, the data was accessed directly by the program – a programming library in the case of large mainframe systems, or a command line interface or interactive forms system in the case of dBASE and similar applications. Data from dBASE could not generally be accessed directly by other programs running on the machine. Those programs may be given a way to access this data, often through libraries, but it would not work with any other database engine, or even different databases in the same engine. In effect, all such systems were static, which presented considerable problems.

===Early efforts===
By the mid-1980s the rapid improvement in microcomputers, and especially the introduction of the graphical user interface and data-rich application programs like Lotus 1-2-3 led to an increasing interest in using personal computers as the client-side platform of choice in client–server computing. Under this model, large mainframes and minicomputers would be used primarily to serve up data over local area networks to microcomputers that would interpret, display and manipulate that data. For this model to work, a data access standard was a requirement – in the mainframe field it was highly likely that all of the computers in a shop were from one vendor and clients were computer terminals talking directly to them, but in the micro field there was no such standardization and any client might access any server using any networking system.

By the late 1980s there were several efforts underway to provide an abstraction layer for this purpose. Some of these were mainframe related, designed to allow programs running on those machines to translate between the variety of SQL&#x27;s and provide a single common interface which could then be called by other mainframe or microcomputer programs. These solutions included IBM&#x27;s Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) and Apple Computer&#x27;s Data Access Language. Much more common, however, were systems that ran entirely on microcomputers, including a complete protocol stack that included any required networking or file translation support.

One of the early examples of such a system was Lotus Development&#x27;s DataLens, initially known as Blueprint. Blueprint, developed for 1-2-3, supported a variety of data sources, including SQL/DS, DB2, FOCUS and a variety of similar mainframe systems, as well as microcomputer systems like dBase and the early Microsoft/Ashton-Tate efforts that would eventually develop into Microsoft SQL Server. Unlike the later ODBC, Blueprint was a purely code-based system, lacking anything approximating a command language like SQL. Instead, programmers used data structures to store the query information, constructing a query by linking many of these structures together. Lotus referred to these compound structures as &quot;query trees&quot;.

Around the same time, an industry team including members from Sybase (Tom Haggin), Tandem Computers (Jim Gray &amp; Rao Yendluri) and Microsoft (Kyle Geiger) were working on a standardized dynamic SQL concept. Much of the system was based on Sybase&#x27;s DB-Library system, with the Sybase-specific sections removed and several additions to support other platforms. DB-Library was aided by an industry-wide move from library systems that were tightly linked to a specific language, to library systems that were provided by the operating system and required the languages on that platform to conform to its standards. This meant that a single library could be used with (potentially) any programming language on a given platform.

The first draft of the &quot;Microsoft Data Access API&quot; was published in April 1989, about the same time as Lotus&#x27; announcement of Blueprint. In spite of Blueprint&#x27;s great lead – it was running when MSDA was still a paper project – Lotus eventually joined the MSDA efforts as it became clear that SQL would become the de facto database standard. After considerable industry input, in the summer of 1989 the standard became &quot;SQL Connectivity&quot; (&quot;SQLC&quot;).

===SAG and CLI===
In 1988 several vendors, mostly from the Unix and database communities, formed the SQL Access Group (SAG) in an effort to produce a single basic standard for the SQL language. At the first meeting there was considerable debate over whether or not the effort should work solely on the SQL language itself, or attempt a wider standardization which included a dynamic SQL language-embedding system as well, what they called a Call Level Interface (CLI). While attending the meeting with an early draft of what was then still known as MS Data Access, Kyle Geiger of Microsoft invited Jeff Balboni and Larry Barnes of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to join the SQLC meetings as well. SQLC was a potential solution to the call for the CLI, which was being led by DEC.

The new SQLC &quot;gang of four&quot;, MS, Tandem, DEC and Sybase, brought an updated version of SQLC to the next SAG meeting in June 1990. The SAG responded by opening the standard effort to any competing design, but of the many proposals, only Oracle Corp had a system that presented serious competition. In the end, SQLC won the votes and became the draft standard, but only after large portions of the API were removed – the standards document was trimmed from 120 pages to 50 during this time. It was also during this period that the name Call Level Interface was formally adopted. In 1995 SQL/CLI became part of the international SQL standard, ISO/IEC 9075-3.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO/IEC 9075-3&quot;&gt;ISO/IEC 9075-3 – Information technology – Database languages – SQL – Part 3: Call-Level Interface (SQL/CLI)&lt;/ref&gt; The SAG itself was taken over by the X/Open group in 1996, and, over time, became part of The Open Group&#x27;s Common Application Environment.

MS continued working with the original SQLC standard, retaining many of the advanced features that were removed from the CLI version. These included features like scrollable cursors, and metadata information queries. The commands in the API were split into groups; the Core group was identical to the CLI, the Level 1 extensions were commands that would be easy to implement in drivers, while Level 2 commands contained the more advanced features like cursors. A proposed standard was released in December 1991, and industry input was gathered and worked into the system through 1992, resulting in yet another name change to &quot;ODBC&quot;.

===JET and ODBC===
During this time, Microsoft was in the midst of developing their Jet database system. Jet combined three primary subsystems; an ISAM-based database engine (also named &quot;Jet&quot;, confusingly), a C-based interface allowing applications to access that data, and a selection of driver dynamic-link libraries (DLL) that allowed the same C interface to redirect input and output to other ISAM-based databases, like Paradox and xBase. Jet allowed using one set of calls to access common microcomputer databases in a fashion similar to Blueprint, by then renamed DataLens. However, Jet did not use SQL; like DataLens, the interface was in C and consisted of data structures and function calls.

The SAG standardization efforts presented an opportunity for Microsoft to adapt their Jet system to the new CLI standard. This would not only make Windows a premier platform for CLI development, but also allow users to use SQL to access both Jet and other databases as well. What was missing was the SQL parser that could convert those calls from their text form into the C-interface used in Jet. To solve this, MS partnered with PageAhead Software to use their existing query processor, SIMBA. SIMBA was used as a parser above Jet&#x27;s C library, turning Jet into an SQL database. And because Jet could forward those C-based calls to other databases, this also allowed SIMBA to query other systems. Microsoft included drivers for Excel to turn its spreadsheet documents into SQL-accessible database tables.

===Release and continued development===
ODBC 1.0 was released in September 1992. At the time, there was little direct support for SQL databases (versus ISAM), and early drivers were noted for poor performance. Some of this was unavoidable due to the path that the calls took through the Jet-based stack; ODBC calls to SQL databases were first converted from Simba Technologies&#x27;s SQL dialect to Jet&#x27;s internal C-based format, then passed to a driver for conversion back into SQL calls for the database. Digital Equipment and Oracle both contracted Simba Technologies to develop drivers for their databases as well.

Circa 1993, OpenLink Software shipped one of the first independently developed third-party ODBC drivers, for the PROGRESS DBMS, and soon followed with their UDBC (a cross-platform API equivalent of ODBC and the SAG/CLI) SDK and associated drivers for PROGRESS, Sybase, Oracle, and other DBMS, for use on Unix-like OS (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux, etc.), VMS, Windows NT, OS/2, and other OS.

Meanwhile, the CLI standard effort dragged on, and it was not until March 1995 that the definitive version was finalized. By then, Microsoft had already granted Visigenic Software a source code license to develop ODBC on non-Windows platforms. Visigenic ported ODBC to the classic Mac OS, and a wide variety of Unix platforms, where ODBC quickly became the de facto standard. &quot;Real&quot; CLI is rare today. The two systems remain similar, and many applications can be ported from ODBC to CLI with few or no changes.

Over time, database vendors took over the driver interfaces and provided direct links to their products. Skipping the intermediate conversions to and from Jet or similar wrappers often resulted in higher performance. However, by then Microsoft had changed focus to their OLE DB concept (recently reinstated ), which provided direct access to a wider variety of data sources from address books to text files. Several new systems followed which further turned their attention from ODBC, including ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) and ADO.net, which interacted more or less with ODBC over their lifetimes.

As Microsoft turned its attention away from working directly on ODBC, the Unix field was increasingly embracing it. This was propelled by two changes within the market, the introduction of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like GNOME that provided a need to access these sources in non-text form, and the emergence of open software database systems like PostgreSQL and MySQL, initially under Unix. The later adoption of ODBC by Apple for using the standard Unix-side iODBC package Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) (which OpenLink Software had been independently providing for Mac OS X 10.0 and even Mac OS 9 since 2001) further cemented ODBC as the standard for cross-platform data access.

Sun Microsystems used the ODBC system as the basis for their own open standard, Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). In most ways, JDBC can be considered a version of ODBC for the programming language Java instead of C. JDBC-to-ODBC &quot;bridges&quot; allow Java-based programs to access data sources through ODBC drivers on platforms lacking a native JDBC driver, although these are now relatively rare. Inversely, ODBC-to-JDBC bridges allow C-based programs to access data sources through JDBC drivers on platforms or from databases lacking suitable ODBC drivers.

===ODBC today===
ODBC remains in wide use today, with drivers available for most platforms and most databases. It is not uncommon to find ODBC drivers for database engines that are meant to be embedded, like SQLite, as a way to allow existing tools to act as front-ends to these engines for testing and debugging.

==Drivers and Managers==

===Drivers===
ODBC is based on the device driver model, where the driver encapsulates the logic needed to convert a standard set of commands and functions into the specific calls required by the underlying system. For instance, a printer driver presents a standard set of printing commands, the API, to applications using the printing system. Calls made to those APIs are converted by the driver into the format used by the actual hardware, say PostScript or PCL.

In the case of ODBC, the drivers encapsulate many functions that can be broken down into several broad categories. One set of functions is primarily concerned with finding, connecting to and disconnecting from the DBMS that driver talks to. A second set is used to send SQL commands from the ODBC system to the DBMS, converting or interpreting any commands that are not supported internally. For instance, a DBMS that does not support cursors can emulate this functionality in the driver. Finally, another set of commands, mostly used internally, is used to convert data from the DBMS&#x27;s internal formats to a set of standardized ODBC formats, which are based on the C language formats.

An ODBC driver enables an ODBC-compliant application to use a &quot;data source&quot;, normally a DBMS. Some non-DBMS drivers exist, for such data sources as CSV files, by implementing a small DBMS inside the driver itself. ODBC drivers exist for most DBMSs, including Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server (but not for the Compact aka CE edition), Mimer SQL, Sybase ASE, SAP HANA and IBM Db2. Because different technologies have different capabilities, most ODBC drivers do not implement all functionality defined in the ODBC standard. Some drivers offer extra functionality not defined by the standard.

===Driver Manager===
Device drivers are normally enumerated, set up and managed by a separate Manager layer, which may provide additional functionality. For instance, printing systems often include functionality to provide spooling functionality on top of the drivers, providing print spooling for any supported printer.

In ODBC the Driver Manager (DM) provides these features. The DM can enumerate the installed drivers and present this as a list, often in a GUI-based form.

But more important to the operation of the ODBC system is the DM&#x27;s concept of a &quot;Data Source Name&quot; (DSN). DSNs collect additional information needed to connect to a &quot;specific&quot; data source, versus the DBMS itself. For instance, the same MySQL driver can be used to connect to any MySQL server, but the connection information to connect to a local private server is different from the information needed to connect to an internet-hosted public server. The DSN stores this information in a standardized format, and the DM provides this to the driver during connection requests. The DM also includes functionality to present a list of DSNs using human readable names, and to select them at run-time to connect to different resources.

The DM also includes the ability to save partially complete DSN&#x27;s, with code and logic to ask the user for any missing information at runtime. For instance, a DSN can be created without a required password. When an ODBC application attempts to connect to the DBMS using this DSN, the system will pause and ask the user to provide the password before continuing. This frees the application developer from having to create this sort of code, as well as having to know which questions to ask. All of this is included in the driver and the DSNs.

==Bridging configurations==
A &quot;bridge&quot; is a special kind of driver: a driver that uses another driver-based technology.

===ODBC-to-JDBC (ODBC-JDBC) bridges===
An ODBC-JDBC bridge consists of an &quot;ODBC&quot; driver which uses the services of a JDBC driver to connect to a database. This driver translates ODBC function-calls into JDBC method-calls. Programmers usually use such a bridge when they lack an ODBC driver for some database but have access to a JDBC driver. Examples: OpenLink ODBC-JDBC Bridge, SequeLink ODBC-JDBC Bridge.

===JDBC-to-ODBC (JDBC-ODBC) bridges===
A JDBC-ODBC bridge consists of a JDBC driver which employs an ODBC driver to connect to a target database. This driver translates JDBC method calls into ODBC function calls. Programmers usually use such a bridge when a given database lacks a JDBC driver, but is accessible through an ODBC driver. Sun Microsystems included one such bridge in the JVM, but viewed it as a stop-gap measure while few JDBC drivers existed (The built-in JDBC-ODBC bridge was dropped from the JVM in Java 8). Sun never intended its bridge for production environments, and generally recommended against its use. independent data-access vendors deliver JDBC-ODBC bridges which support current standards for both mechanisms, and which far outperform the JVM built-in. Examples: OpenLink JDBC-ODBC Bridge, SequeLink JDBC-ODBC Bridge, ZappySys JDBC-ODBC Bridge.

===OLE DB-to-ODBC bridges===
An OLE DB-ODBC bridge consists of an OLE DB Provider which uses the services of an ODBC driver to connect to a target database. This provider translates OLE DB method calls into ODBC function calls. Programmers usually use such a bridge when a given database lacks an OLE DB provider, but is accessible through an ODBC driver. Microsoft ships one, MSDASQL.DLL, as part of the MDAC system component bundle, together with other database drivers, to simplify development in COM-aware languages (e.g. Visual Basic). Third parties have also developed such, notably OpenLink Software whose 64-bit OLE DB Provider for ODBC Data Sources filled the gap when Microsoft initially deprecated this bridge for their 64-bit OS. (Microsoft later relented, and 64-bit Windows starting with Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista SP1 have shipped with a 64-bit version of MSDASQL.) Examples: OpenLink OLEDB-ODBC Bridge , SequeLink OLEDB-ODBC Bridge.

===ADO.NET-to-ODBC bridges===
An ADO.NET-ODBC bridge consists of an ADO.NET Provider which uses the services of an ODBC driver to connect to a target database. This provider translates ADO.NET method calls into ODBC function calls. Programmers usually use such a bridge when a given database lacks an ADO.NET provider, but is accessible through an ODBC driver. Microsoft ships one as part of the MDAC system component bundle, together with other database drivers, to simplify development in C#. Third parties have also developed such. Examples: OpenLink ADO.NET-ODBC Bridge, SequeLink ADO.NET-ODBC Bridge.

<doc id="168703" wikidata="Q27121853" url="?curid=168703" title="Thujone">
<text>Thujone () is a ketone and a monoterpene that occurs predominantly in two diastereomeric (epimeric) forms: (−)-α-thujone and (+)-β-thujone.

Though it is best known as a chemical compound in the spirit absinthe, it is only present in trace amounts and is unlikely to be responsible for the spirit&#x27;s purported stimulant and psychoactive effects.

Thujone acts on the GABAA receptor as an antagonist. As a competitive antagonist of GABAA receptor, thujone alone is considered to be convulsant, though by interfering with the inhibitory transmitter GABA, it may convey stimulating, mood-elevating effects at low doses. It is also found in perfumery as a component of several essential oils.

In addition to the naturally occurring (−)-α-thujone and (+)-β-thujone, two other forms are possible: (+)-α-thujone and (−)-β-thujone. In 2016, they were found in nature as well, in &quot;Salvia officinalis&quot;.

== Sources ==
Thujone is found in a number of plants, such as arborvitae (genus &quot;Thuja&quot;, hence the derivation of the name), Nootka cypress, some junipers, mugwort, oregano, common sage, tansy, and wormwood, most notably grand wormwood (&quot;Artemisia absinthium&quot;), usually as a mix of isomers in a 1:2 ratio. It is also found in various species of &quot;Mentha&quot; (mint).

== Biosynthesis ==

The biosynthesis of thujone is similar to the synthesis of other monoterpenes and begins with the formation of geranyl diphosphate (GPP) from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), catalyzed by the enzyme geranyl diphosphate synthase. Quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopic analysis has demonstrated that the isoprene units used to form thujone in plants are derived from the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP).

The reactions that generate the thujone skeleton in sabinene from GPP are mediated by the enzyme sabinene synthase which has GPP as its substrate. GPP (1) first isomerizes to linalyl diphosphate (LPP) (2) and neryl diphosphate (NPP) (3). LPP preferentially forms a delocalized allylic cation-diphosphate (4). The ion-pair intermediate then cyclizes in an electrophilic addition to yield the α-terpinyl tertiary cation (5).

The α-terpinyl cation (5) then undergoes a 1,2 hydride shift via a Wagner–Meerwein rearrangement, leading to the formation of the terpinen-4-yl cation (6). This cation undergoes a second cyclization to form the thujyl cation intermediate (7) before loss of a proton to form the thujone precursor, (+)-sabinene (8).

From (+)-sabinene (8), the proposed biosynthetic route to generate thujone follows a three-step pathway: (+)-sabinene is first oxidized to an isomer of (+)-sabinol (9-1&quot;, &quot;9-2) by a cytochrome P450 enzyme, followed by conversion to (+)-sabinone (10) via a dehydrogenase. Finally, a reductase mediates the conversion to α-thujone (11-1) and β-thujone (11-2). The isomerism of the (+)-sabinol intermediate varies among thujone-producing plants; for instance, in the western redcedar (&quot;Thuja plicata&quot;), thujone is derived exclusively from the (+)-&quot;trans&quot;-sabinol intermediate (9-1) whereas in the common garden sage (&quot;Salvia officinalis&quot;), thujone is formed from the (+)-&quot;cis&quot;-sabinol intermediate (9-2).

==Pharmacology==

Based on a hypothesis that considered only molecular shape, it was speculated that thujone may act similarly to THC on the cannabinoid receptors; however, thujone failed to evoke a cannabimimetic response in a 1999 investigative study. Thujone is a GABAA receptor antagonist and more specifically, a GABAA receptor competitive antagonist. By inhibiting GABA receptor activation, neurons may fire more easily, which can cause muscle spasms and convulsions. This interaction with the GABAA receptor is specific to alpha-thujone. Thujone is also a 5-HT3 antagonist.

The median lethal dose, or LD50, of α-thujone, the more active of the two isomers, in mice, is around 45 mg/kg, with 0% mortality rate at 30 mg/kg and 100% at 60 mg/kg. Mice exposed to the higher dose have convulsions that lead to death within 1 minute. From 30 to 45 mg/kg, the mice experience muscle spasms in the legs, which progress to general convulsions until death or recovery. These effects are in line with other GABA antagonists. Also, α-thujone is metabolized quickly in the liver in mice. Pretreatment with GABA positive allosteric modulators like diazepam, phenobarbital, or 1 g/kg of ethanol protects against a lethal dose of 100 mg/kg.

Attention performance has been tested with low and high doses of thujone in alcohol. The high dose had a short-term negative effect on attention performance. The lower dose showed no noticeable effect.

Thujone is reported to be toxic to brain, kidney, and liver cells and could cause convulsions if used in too high a dose. Other thujone-containing plants such as the tree arborvitae (&quot;Thuja occidentalis&quot;) are used in herbal medicine, mainly for their alleged immune-system stimulating effects. Side effects from the essential oil of this plant include anxiety, sleeplessness, and convulsions, which confirms the central nervous system effects of thujone.

==In absinthe==
Thujone is most commonly known for being a compound in the spirit absinthe. In the past, absinthe was thought to contain up to 260–350 mg/L thujone, but modern tests have shown this estimate to be far too high. A 2008 study of 13 pre-ban (1895–1910) bottles using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) found that the bottles had between 0.5 and 48.3 mg/L and averaged 25.4 mg/L A 2005 study recreated three 1899 high-wormwood recipes and tested with GC–MS, and found that the highest contained 4.3 mg/L thujone. GC–MS testing is important in this capacity because gas chromatography alone may record an inaccurately high reading of thujone as other compounds may interfere with and add to the apparent measured amount.

===History===
The compound was discovered after absinthe became popular in the mid-19th century. Valentin Magnan, who studied alcoholism, tested pure wormwood oil on animals and discovered it caused seizures independent from the effects of alcohol. Based on this, absinthe, which contains a small amount of wormwood oil, was assumed to be more dangerous than ordinary alcohol. Eventually, thujone was isolated as the cause of these reactions. Magnan went on to study 250 abusers of alcohol and noted that those who drank absinthe had seizures and hallucinations. The seizures are caused by the (+)-α-thujone interacting with the GABA receptors, causing epileptic activity. In light of modern evidence, these conclusions are questionable, as they are based on a poor understanding of other compounds and diseases, and clouded by Magnan&#x27;s belief that alcohol and absinthe were degenerating the French race.

After absinthe was banned, research dropped off until the 1970s, when the British scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; published an article comparing the molecular shape of thujone to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive substance found in cannabis, and hypothesized it would act the same way on the brain, sparking the myth that thujone was a cannabinoid.

More recently, following European Council Directive No. 88/388/EEC (1988) allowing certain levels of thujone in foodstuffs in the EU, the studies described above were conducted and found only minute levels of thujone in absinthe.

==Regulations==

===European Union===
Maximum thujone levels in the EU are:
*0.5 mg/kg in food prepared with &quot;Artemisia&quot; species, excluding those prepared with sage and non-alcoholic beverages
*10 mg/kg in alcoholic beverages not prepared with &quot;Artemisia&quot; species
*25 mg/kg in food prepared with sage
*35 mg/kg in alcoholic beverages prepared with &quot;Artemisia&quot; species

===United States===
In the United States, the addition of pure thujone to foods is not permitted. Foods or beverages that contain &quot;Artemisia&quot; species, white cedar, oakmoss, tansy, or yarrow, must be thujone-free, which in practice means that they contain less than 10 parts per million thujone. Other herbs that contain thujone have no restrictions. For example, sage and sage oil (which can be up to 50% thujone) are on the Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s list of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) substances.

Absinthe offered for sale in the United States must be thujone-free by the same standard that applies to other beverages containing &quot;Artemisia&quot;, so absinthe with small amounts of thujone may be legally imported.

===Canada===
In Canada, liquor laws are the domain of the provincial governments. Alberta, Ontario, and Nova Scotia allow 10 mg/kg thujone; Quebec allows 15 mg per kg; Manitoba allows 6–8 mg thujone per litre; British Columbia adheres to the same levels as Ontario. However, in Saskatchewan and Quebec, one can purchase any liquor available in the world upon the purchase of a maximum of one case, usually 12 750-ml bottles or 9 L. The individual liquor boards must approve each product before it may be sold on shelves.

<doc id="168704" wikidata="Q192683" url="?curid=168704" title="Ad hoc">
<text>Ad hoc is a Latin phrase meaning literally for this. In English, it typically signifies a solution designed for a specific purpose, problem, or task rather than a generalized solution adaptable to collateral instances (compare with &quot;a priori&quot;).

Common examples include ad hoc committees and commissions created at the national or international level for a specific task, and the term is often used to describe arbitration (ad hoc arbitration). In other fields, the term could refer to a military unit created under special circumstances (see &quot;task force&quot;), a handcrafted network protocol (e.g., ad hoc network), a temporary collaboration among geographically-linked franchise locations (of a given national brand) to issue advertising coupons, or a purpose-specific equation in mathematics or science.

Ad hoc can also function as an adjective describing temporary, provisional, or improvised methods to deal with a particular problem, the tendency of which has given rise to the noun &quot;adhocism&quot;. This concept highlights the flexibility and adaptability often required in problem-solving across various domains.

In everyday language, &quot;ad hoc&quot; is sometimes used informally to describe improvised or makeshift solutions, emphasizing their temporary nature and specific applicability to immediate circumstances.

==Styling==
Style guides disagree on whether Latin phrases like ad hoc should be italicized. The trend is not to use italics. For example, &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; recommends that familiar Latin phrases that are listed in the &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, including &quot;ad hoc&quot;, not be italicized.

==Hypothesis==

In science and philosophy, ad hoc means the addition of extraneous hypotheses to a theory to save it from being falsified. Ad hoc hypotheses compensate for anomalies not anticipated by the theory in its unmodified form.

Scientists are often skeptical of scientific theories that rely on frequent, unsupported adjustments to sustain them. Ad hoc hypotheses are often characteristic of pseudo-scientific subjects such as homeopathy.

==In the military==

In the military, ad hoc units are created during unpredictable situations, when the cooperation between different units is suddenly needed for fast action, or from remnants of previous units which have been overrun or otherwise whittled down.

==In governance==
In national and sub-national governance, ad hoc bodies may be established to deal with specific problems not easily accommodated by the current structure of governance or to address multi-faceted issues spanning several areas of governance. In the UK and other commonwealth countries, ad hoc Royal Commissions may be set up to address specific questions as directed by parliament.

== In diplomacy ==
In diplomacy, diplomats may be appointed by a government as special envoys, or diplomats who serve on a ad hoc basis due to the possibility that such envoys&#x27; offices may either not be retained by a future government or may only exist during the duration of a relevant cause. 

==Networking==

The term &quot;ad hoc networking&quot; typically refers to a system of network elements that combine to form a network requiring little or no planning.

<text>In macroeconomics, money supply (or money stock) refers to the total volume of money held by the public at a particular point in time. There are several ways to define &quot;money&quot;, but standard measures usually include currency in circulation (i.e. physical cash) and demand deposits (depositors&#x27; easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions). Money supply data is recorded and published, usually by the national statistical agency or the central bank of the country. Empirical money supply measures are usually named M1, M2, M3, etc., according to how wide a definition of money they embrace. The precise definitions vary from country to country, in part depending on national financial institutional traditions. 

Even for narrow aggregates like M1, by far the largest part of the money supply consists of deposits in commercial banks, whereas currency (banknotes and coins) issued by central banks only makes up a small part of the total money supply in modern economies. The public&#x27;s demand for currency and bank deposits and commercial banks&#x27; supply of loans are consequently important determinants of money supply changes. As these decisions are influenced by central banks&#x27; monetary policy, not least their setting of interest rates, the money supply is ultimately determined by complex interactions between non-banks, commercial banks and central banks. 

According to the quantity theory supported by the monetarist school of thought, there is a tight causal connection between growth in the money supply and inflation. In particular during the 1970s and 1980s this idea was influential, and several major central banks during that period attempted to control the money supply closely, following a monetary policy target of increasing the money supply stably. However, the strategy was generally found to be impractical because money demand turned out to be too unstable for the strategy to work as intended. 

Consequently, the money supply has lost its central role in monetary policy, and central banks today generally do not try to control the money supply. Instead they focus on adjusting interest rates, in developed countries normally as part of a direct inflation target which leaves little room for a special emphasis on the money supply. Money supply measures may still play a role in monetary policy, however, as one of many economic indicators that central bankers monitor to judge likely future movements in central variables like employment and inflation.

==Measures of money supply ==


There are several standard measures of the money supply, classified along a spectrum or continuum between narrow and broad &quot;monetary aggregates&quot;. Narrow measures include only the most liquid assets: those most easily used to spend (currency, checkable deposits). Broader measures add less liquid types of assets (certificates of deposit, etc.).

This continuum corresponds to the way that different types of money are more or less controlled by monetary policy. Narrow measures include those more directly affected and controlled by monetary policy, whereas broader measures are less closely related to monetary-policy actions.

The different types of money are typically classified as &quot;M&quot;s. The &quot;M&quot;s usually range from M0 (narrowest) to M3 (and M4 in some countries) (broadest), but which &quot;M&quot;s, if any, are actually focused on in central bank communications depends on the particular institution. A typical layout for each of the &quot;M&quot;s is as follows for the United States:
* : In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, M0 includes bank reserves, so M0 is referred to as the monetary base, or narrow money.
* : is referred to as the monetary base or total currency. This is the base from which other forms of money (like checking deposits, listed below) are created and is traditionally the most liquid measure of the money supply.
* : Bank reserves are not included in M1.
* : Represents M1 and &quot;close substitutes&quot; for M1. M2 is a broader classification of money than M1. 
* : M2 plus large and long-term deposits. Since March, 23, 2006, M3 is no longer published by the US central bank, as one of Alan Greenspan&#x27;s last acts, because of its expense. However, there are still estimates produced by various private institutions.
* : Money with zero maturity. It measures the supply of financial assets redeemable at par on demand.

=== Creation of money ===

Both central banks and commercial banks play a role in the process of money creation. In short, in the fractional-reserve banking system used throughout the world, money can be subdivided into two types:

* central bank money – obligations of a central bank, including currency and central bank depository accounts
* commercial bank money – obligations of commercial banks, including checking accounts and savings accounts.

In the money supply statistics, central bank money is MB while the commercial bank money is divided up into the M1–M3 components, where it makes up the non-M0 component. 

By far the largest part of the money used by individuals and firms to execute economic actions are commercial bank money, i.e. deposits issued by banks and other financial institutions. In the United Kingdom, deposit money outweighs the central bank issued currency by a factor of more than 30 to 1. In the United States, where the country&#x27;s currency has a special international role being used in many transactions around the world, legally as well as illegally, the ratio is still more than 8 to 1. Commercial banks create money whenever they make a loan and simultaneously create a matching deposit in the borrower&#x27;s bank account. In return, money is destroyed when the borrower pays back the principal on the loan. Movements in the money supply therefore to a large extent depend on the decisions of commercial banks to supply loans and consequently deposits, and the public&#x27;s behavior in demanding currency as well as bank deposits. These decisions are influenced by the monetary policy of central banks, so that money supply is ultimately created by complex interactions between banks, non-banks and central banks. 

Even though central banks today rarely try to control the amount of money in circulation, their policies still impact the actions of both commercial banks and their customers. When setting the interest rate on central bank reserves, interest rates on bank loans are affected, which in turn affects their demand. Central banks may also affect the money supply more directly by engaging in various open market operations. They can increase the money supply by purchasing government securities, such as government bonds or treasury bills. This increases the liquidity in the banking system by converting the illiquid securities of commercial banks into liquid deposits at the central bank. This also causes the price of such securities to rise due to the increased demand, and interest rates to fall. In contrast, when the central bank &quot;tightens&quot; the money supply, it sells securities on the open market, drawing liquid funds out of the banking system. The prices of such securities fall as supply is increased, and interest rates rise. 

In some economics textbooks, the supply-demand equilibrium in the markets for money and reserves is represented by a simple so-called money multiplier relationship between the monetary base of the central bank and the resulting money supply including commercial bank deposits. This is a short-hand simplification which disregards several other factors determining commercial banks&#x27; reserve-to-deposit ratios and the public&#x27;s money demand.

==National definitions of &quot;money&quot;==
===East Asia===
====Hong Kong====

The Hong Kong Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration provides that Hong Kong retains full autonomy with respect to currency issuance. Currency in Hong Kong is issued by the government and three local banks under the supervision of the territory&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Bank notes are printed by Hong Kong Note Printing.

A bank can issue a Hong Kong dollar only if it has the equivalent exchange in US dollars on deposit. The currency board system ensures that Hong Kong&#x27;s entire monetary base is backed with US dollars at the linked exchange rate. The resources for the backing are kept in Hong Kong&#x27;s exchange fund, which is among the largest official reserves in the world. Hong Kong also has huge deposits of US dollars, with official foreign currency reserves of 331.3 billion USD .
=====Currency peg history=====
Hong Kong&#x27;s exchange rate regime has changed over time.
* 1967: Sterling was devalued, the peg was increased from 1 shilling 3 pence (£1 = HK$16) to 1 shilling 4½ pence (£1 = HK$14.5455). Valued in USD, the currency went from US$1 = HK$5.71 to US$1 = HK$6.06
* 1972: pegged to the US dollar, US$1 = HK$5.65
* 1973: US$1 = HK$5.085
* 1974 to 1983: The Hong Kong dollar was floated
* October 17, 1983: Pegged at US$1 = HK$7.80 through the currency board system
* May 18, 2005: A lower and upper guaranteed limit are in place at 7.75 to the US dollar. Lower limit was lowered from 7.80 to 7.85, between May 23 and June 20, 2005. The Monetary Authority indicated this was to narrow the gap between interest rates between Hong Kong and the US, and to avoid the HK dollar being used as a proxy for speculative bets on a renminbi revaluation.

====Japan====

The Bank of Japan defines the monetary aggregates as:
* M1: cash currency in circulation, plus deposit money
* M2 + CDs: M1 plus quasi-money and CDs
* M3 + CDs: M2 + CDs plus deposits of post offices; other savings and deposits with financial institutions; and money trusts
* Broadly defined liquidity: M3 and CDs, plus money market, pecuniary trusts other than money trusts, investment trusts, bank debentures, commercial paper issued by financial institutions, repurchase agreements and securities lending with cash collateral, government bonds and foreign bonds

===Europe===
====Eurozone====
The European Central Bank&#x27;s definition of euro area monetary aggregates:
* M1: Currency in circulation plus overnight deposits
* M2: M1 plus deposits with an agreed maturity up to two years plus deposits redeemable at a period of notice up to three months.
* M3: M2 plus repurchase agreements plus money market fund (MMF) shares/units, plus debt securities up to two years
====United Kingdom====
There are just two official UK measures. M0 is referred to as the &quot;wide monetary base&quot; or &quot;narrow money&quot; and M4 is referred to as &quot;broad money&quot; or simply &quot;the money supply&quot;.
* M0: Notes and coin in circulation plus banks&#x27; reserve balance with Bank of England. (When the bank introduced Money Market Reform in May 2006, the bank ceased publication of M0 and instead began publishing series for reserve balances at the Bank of England to accompany notes and coin in circulation.)
* M4: Cash outside banks (i.e. in circulation with the public and non-bank firms) plus private-sector retail bank and building society deposits plus private-sector wholesale bank and building society deposits and certificates of deposit. In 2010 the total money supply (M4) measure in the UK was £2.2 trillion while the actual notes and coins in circulation totalled only £47 billion, 2.1% of the actual money supply.

There are several different definitions of money supply to reflect the differing stores of money. Owing to the nature of bank deposits, especially time-restricted savings account deposits, M4 represents the most illiquid measure of money. M0, by contrast, is the most liquid measure of the money supply.

===North America===
====United States ====

The United States Federal Reserve published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and only published data on M1 and M2. M1 consists of money commonly used for payment, basically currency in circulation and checking account balances; and M2 includes M1 plus balances that generally are similar to transaction accounts and that, for the most part, can be converted fairly readily to M1 with little or no loss of principal. The M2 measure is thought to be held primarily by households. Prior to its discontinuation, M3 comprised M2 plus certain accounts that are held by entities other than individuals and are issued by banks and thrift institutions to augment M2-type balances in meeting credit demands, as well as balances in money market mutual funds held by institutional investors. The aggregates have had different roles in monetary policy as their reliability as guides has changed. The principal components are:

* M0: The total of all physical currency including coinage. M0 = Federal Reserve Notes + US Notes + Coins. It is not relevant whether the currency is held inside or outside of the private banking system as reserves.
* MB: The total of all physical currency plus Federal Reserve Deposits (special deposits that only banks can have at the Fed). MB = Coins + US Notes + Federal Reserve Notes + Federal Reserve Deposits
* M1: The total amount of M0 (cash/coin) outside of the private banking system plus the amount of demand deposits, travelers checks and other checkable deposits + most savings accounts. 
* M2: M1 + money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small denomination time deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000).
* MZM: &#x27;Money Zero Maturity&#x27; is one of the most popular aggregates in use by the Fed because its velocity has historically been the most accurate predictor of inflation. It is M2 – time deposits + money market funds
* M3: M2 + all other CDs (large time deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements.
* M4-: M3 + Commercial Paper
* M4: M4- + T-Bills (or M3 + Commercial Paper + T-Bills)
* L: The broadest measure of liquidity, that the Federal Reserve no longer tracks. L is very close to M4 + Bankers&#x27; Acceptance
* Money Multiplier: M1 / MB. As of December 3, 2015, it was 0.756. While a multiplier under one is historically an oddity, this is a reflection of the popularity of M2 over M1 and the massive amount of MB the government has created since 2008.

Prior to 2020, savings accounts were counted as M2 and not part of M1 as they were not considered &quot;transaction accounts&quot; by the Fed. (There was a limit of six transactions per cycle that could be carried out in a savings account without incurring a penalty.) On March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions and rendered the regulatory distinction between reservable &quot;transaction accounts&quot; and nonreservable &quot;savings deposits&quot; unnecessary. On April 24, 2020, the Board removed this regulatory distinction by deleting the six-per-month transfer limit on savings deposits. From this point on, savings account deposits were included in M1.

Although the Treasury can and does hold cash and a special deposit account at the Fed (TGA account), these assets do not count in any of the aggregates. So in essence, money paid in taxes paid to the Federal Government (Treasury) is excluded from the money supply. To counter this, the government created the Treasury Tax and Loan (TT&amp;L) program in which any receipts above a certain threshold are redeposited in private banks. The idea is that tax receipts won&#x27;t decrease the amount of reserves in the banking system. The TT&amp;L accounts, while demand deposits, do not count toward M1 or any other aggregate either.

When the Federal Reserve announced in 2005 that they would cease publishing M3 statistics in March 2006, they explained that M3 did not convey any additional information about economic activity compared to M2, and thus, &quot;has not played a role in the monetary policy process for many years.&quot; Therefore, the costs to collect M3 data outweighed the benefits the data provided. Some politicians have spoken out against the Federal Reserve&#x27;s decision to cease publishing M3 statistics and have urged the U.S. Congress to take steps requiring the Federal Reserve to do so. Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) claimed that &quot;M3 is the best description of how quickly the Fed is creating new money and credit. Common sense tells us that a government central bank creating new money out of thin air depreciates the value of each dollar in circulation.&quot; Some of the data used to calculate M3 are still collected and published on a regular basis. Current alternate sources of M3 data are available from the private sector.

In the United States, a bank&#x27;s reserves consist of U.S. currency held by the bank (also known as &quot;vault cash&quot;) plus the bank&#x27;s balances in Federal Reserve accounts. For this purpose, cash on hand and balances in Federal Reserve (&quot;Fed&quot;) accounts are interchangeable (both are obligations of the Fed). Reserves may come from any source, including the federal funds market, deposits by the public, and borrowing from the Fed itself.

As of April 2013, the monetary base was $3 trillion and M2, the broadest measure of money supply, was $10.5 trillion.

===Oceania===
====Australia====

The Reserve Bank of Australia defines the monetary aggregates as:
* M1: currency in circulation plus bank current deposits from the private non-bank sector
* M3: M1 plus all other bank deposits from the private non-bank sector, plus bank certificate of deposits, less inter-bank deposits
* Broad money: M3 plus borrowings from the private sector by NBFIs, less the latter&#x27;s holdings of currency and bank deposits
* Money base: holdings of notes and coins by the private sector plus deposits of banks with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and other RBA liabilities to the private non-bank sector.

====New Zealand====
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand defines the monetary aggregates as:
* M1: notes and coins held by the public plus chequeable deposits, minus inter-institutional chequeable deposits, and minus central government deposits
* M2: M1 + all non-M1 call funding (call funding includes overnight money and funding on terms that can of right be broken without break penalties) minus inter-institutional non-M1 call funding
* M3: the broadest monetary aggregate. It represents all New Zealand dollar funding of M3 institutions and any Reserve Bank repos with non-M3 institutions. M3 consists of notes &amp; coin held by the public plus NZ dollar funding minus inter-M3 institutional claims and minus central government deposits

===South Asia===
====India====
The Reserve Bank of India defines the monetary aggregates as:
* Reserve money (M0): Currency in circulation, plus bankers&#x27; deposits with the RBI and &#x27;other&#x27; deposits with the RBI. Calculated from net RBI credit to the government plus RBI credit to the commercial sector, plus RBI&#x27;s claims on banks and net foreign assets plus the government&#x27;s currency liabilities to the public, less the RBI&#x27;s net non-monetary liabilities. M0 outstanding was 30.297 trillion as on March 31, 2020.
* M1: Currency with the public plus deposit money of the public (demand deposits with the banking system and &#x27;other&#x27; deposits with the RBI). M1 was 184 per cent of M0 in August 2017.
* M2: M1 plus savings deposits with post office savings banks. M2 was 879 per cent of M0 in August 2017.
* M3 (the broad concept of money supply): M1 plus time deposits with the banking system, made up of net bank credit to the government plus bank credit to the commercial sector, plus the net foreign exchange assets of the banking sector and the government&#x27;s currency liabilities to the public, less the net non-monetary liabilities of the banking sector (other than time deposits). M3 was 555 per cent of M0 as on March 31, 2020(i.e. 167.99 trillion.)
* M4: M3 plus all deposits with post office savings banks (excluding National Savings Certificates).

== Importance of money supply ==

The importance which has historically been attached to the money supply in the monetary policy of central banks is due to the suggestion that movements in money may determine important economic variables like prices (and hence inflation), output and employment. Indeed, two prominent analytical frameworks in the 20th century both built on this premise: the Keynesian IS-LM model and the monetarist quantity theory of money.

=== IS-LM model ===

The IS-LM model was introduced by John Hicks in 1937 to describe Keynesian macroeconomic theory. Between the 1940s and mid-1970s, it was the leading framework of macroeconomic analysis and is still today an important conceptual introductory tool in many macroeconomics textbooks. In the traditional version of this model it is assumed that the central bank conducts monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the money supply, which affects interest rates and consequently investment, aggregate demand and output.

In light of the fact that modern central banks have generally ceased to target the money supply as an explicit policy variable, in some more recent macroeconomic textbooks the IS-LM model has been modified to incorporate the fact that rather than manipulating the money supply, central banks tend to conduct their policies by setting policy interest rates more directly.

=== Quantity theory of money ===

According to the quantity theory of money, inflation is caused by movements in the supply of money and hence can be controlled by the central bank if the bank controls the money supply. The theory builds upon Irving Fisher&#x27;s equation of exchange from 1911:
: formula_1
where
* formula_2 is the total dollars in the nation&#x27;s money supply,
* formula_3 is the number of times per year each dollar is spent (velocity of money),
* formula_4 is the average price of all the goods and services sold during the year,
* formula_5 is the quantity of assets, goods and services sold during the year.

In practice, macroeconomists almost always use real GDP to define , omitting the role of all other transactions. Either way, the equation in itself is an identity which is true by definition rather than describing economic behavior. That is, velocity is defined by the values of the other three variables. Unlike the other terms, the velocity of money has no independent measure and can only be estimated by dividing by . Adherents of the quantity theory of money assume that the velocity of money is stable and predictable, being determined mostly by financial institutions. If that assumption is valid, then changes in can be used to predict changes in . If not, then a model of is required in order for the equation of exchange to be useful as a macroeconomics model or as a predictor of prices.

Most macroeconomists replace the equation of exchange with equations for the demand for money which describe more regular economic behavior. However, predictability (or the lack thereof) of the velocity of money is equivalent to predictability (or the lack thereof) of the demand for money (since in equilibrium real money demand is simply ).

There is some empirical evidence of a direct relationship between the growth of the money supply and long-term price inflation, at least for rapid increases in the amount of money in the economy. The quantity theory was a cornerstone for the monetarists and in particular Milton Friedman, who together with Anna Schwartz in 1963 in a pioneering work documented the relationship between money and inflation in the United States during the period 1867–1960. During the 1970s and 1980s the monetarist ideas were increasingly influential, and major central banks like the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the German Bundesbank officially followed a monetary policy objective of increasing the money supply in a stable way. 

=== Declining importance ===

Starting in the mid-1970s and increasingly over the next decades, the empirical correlation between fluctuations in the money supply and changes in income or prices broke down, and there appeared clear evidence that money demand (or, equivalently, velocity) was unstable, at least in the short and medium run, which is the time horizon that is relevant to monetary policy. This made a money target less useful for central banks and led to the decline of money supply as a tool of monetary policy. Instead central banks generally switched to steering interest rates directly, allowing money supply to fluctuate to accommodate fluctuations in money demand. Concurrently, most central banks in developed countries implemented direct inflation targeting as the foundation of their monetary policy, which leaves little room for a special emphasis on the money supply. In the United States, the strategy of targeting the money supply was tried under Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker from 1979, but was found to be impractical and later given up. According to Benjamin Friedman, the number of central banks that actively seek to influence money supply as an element of their monetary policy is shrinking to zero. 

Even though today central banks generally do not try to determine the money supply, monitoring money supply data may still play a role in the preparation of monetary policy as part of a wide array of financial and economic data that policymakers review. Developments in money supply may contain information of the behavior of commercial banks and of the general economic stance which is useful for judging future movements in, say, employment and inflation. Also in this respect, however, money supply data have a mixed record. In the United States, for instance, the Conference Board Leading Economic Index originally included a real money supply (M2) component as one of its 10 leading indicators, but removed it from the index in 2012 after having ascertained that it had performed poorly as a leading indicator since 1989.

<text>Ernest Joseph &quot;Trey&quot; Anastasio III (born September 30, 1964) is an American guitarist, composer, and singer-songwriter best known as the lead guitarist of the rock band Phish, which he co-founded in 1983. He is credited by name as composer of 152 Phish original songs, 141 of them as a solo credit, in addition to 41 credits attributed to the band as a whole.

In addition to his work with Phish, Anastasio has released 11 solo albums. He has also been part of several side projects; these include the Trey Anastasio Band, Oysterhead, Ghosts of the Forest, Phil Lesh and Friends, and Surrender to the Air.

He has performed his own compositions with the New York Philharmonic, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the National Symphony Orchestra, and many others. With Amanda Green, he wrote the score for the Broadway musical &quot;Hands on a Hardbody&quot;. In 2013, they were nominated for a Tony Award for Best Original Score at the 67th Tony Awards, and were awarded the 2013 Dramatists Guild Frederick Loewe Award for best theatrical score composition.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Anastasio at number 53 on their list of the 250 greatest guitarists of all time.

==Early life and career==
Anastasio was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and moved to Princeton, New Jersey, when he was three. His father, Ernest Anastasio Jr., was an executive vice president at the Educational Testing Service. His mother, Dina, was a children&#x27;s book author and editor of &quot;Sesame Street Magazine&quot;. He grew up with his sister Kristy. In 1967, Trey was the inspiration for the lead character in the children&#x27;s book &quot;What Does The Cloud Do?&quot;, which was written and illustrated by his grandparents, Jean and Cle Kinney.

Anastasio attended Princeton public schools through the fourth grade, then transferred to Princeton Day School. He graduated from the Taft School along with Steven Pollak, better known as the Dude of Life, who later helped pen such Phish compositions as &quot;Suzy Greenberg&quot;, &quot;Fluffhead&quot;, &quot;Run Like An Antelope&quot;, &quot;Slave to the Traffic Light&quot;, and &quot;Dinner and a Movie&quot;. At Taft, he formed his first two bands, Red Tide and Space Antelope.

He enrolled at the University of Vermont (UVM) as a philosophy major, where he met original Phish bandmates Jon Fishman, Mike Gordon, and Jeff Holdsworth. On December 2, 1983, the group played their first gig at a dance in the Harris-Millis Cafeteria at UVM. The setlist consisted of cover songs, including &quot;Long Cool Woman&quot; and &quot;Proud Mary&quot; which was performed twice. The band was very primitive at this time and used hockey sticks as mic stands. After performing one set, Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; album was put on by a party-goer to drown out the band. The band would not return to play but were still paid for the performance. At UVM, he hosted an early morning radio program, &quot;Ambient Alarm Clock&quot;.

While living at home for a semester he attended Mercer County Community College. While there, he reconnected with his childhood friend Tom Marshall, and the pair began a songwriting collaboration and recorded material that would appear on the &quot;Bivouac Jaun&quot; demo tape. In addition to Marshall, Anastasio also reconnected with another childhood friend, Marc Daubert, who also became a collaborator. After seeing a Phish show, pianist Page McConnell joined Phish in the autumn of 1985. Anastasio, along with Jon Fishman, transferred to Goddard College.

During this time he began a musical association and close friendship with composer Ernie Stires, who taught him composition, theory, and arranging. While at Goddard, he composed the song cycle &quot;The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday&quot; as his senior project. These songs became mainstays of the Phish catalog. He graduated from Goddard in 1988.

==Career==
===Phish===

Anastasio is a founding member of the rock band Phish, serving as lead guitarist and vocalist since their inception. Phish is noted for their musical improvisation, extended jams, exploration of a broad range of genres, and original live performances. Formed at the University of Vermont in 1983 (with the current line up solidifying in 1985), the band includes bassist and vocalist Mike Gordon; percussionist, vacuum player, and vocalist Jon Fishman; and keyboardist and vocalist Page McConnell. Phish performed together for over 20 years, releasing 10 studio albums, disbanding in August 2004. They reunited in March 2009 for a corresponding tour, released a reunion album &quot;Joy&quot; and have since resumed performing regularly.

====Phish-related projects====
*Bivouac Jaun in 1984 was a project featuring Anastasio, Phish lyricist Tom Marshall, and one-time Phish collaborator Marc Daubert. The group recorded a four-track project during Phish&#x27;s short hiatus in the summer of 1984. Much of the project would be retooled and later featured on the first Phish album, &quot;The White Tape&quot;, in 1986.
*Bad Hat, formed in the spring of 1994, included Jon Fishman on drums, Jamie Masefield on mandolin, and Stacey Starkweather on bass. They casually played improvisational jazz around Burlington, Vermont, for a few months, with the first of several shows at Last Elm Cafe. They billed themselves as &quot;the quietest band around&quot;.
*Surrender to the Air was a free jazz ensemble led by Anastasio and featuring Fishman, as well as Marshall Allen, Damon Choice, and Michael Ray (trumpeter) of the Sun Ra Orchestra, John Medeski, Marc Ribot, Oteil Burbridge and several other musicians. The group performed two concerts at the New York City Arts Academy in April 1996 and disbanded shortly thereafter. The concerts, like the group&#x27;s sole album, consisted of completely improvised music.
* 8 Foot Fluorescent Tubes, played a show on April 17, 1998 at Higher Grounds featuring Anastasio, Tom Lawson, Heloise Willimas, Tony Markellis, and Russel Lawton.
*Phil Lesh and Friends (commonly referred to as &quot;Phil Lesh and Phriends&quot;) in 1999 featured Anastasio and Page McConnell, Grateful Dead members Phil Lesh and Donna Jean Godchaux, guitarist Steve Kimock, and drummer John Molo performing three nights of Dead and Phish material at The Warfield in San Francisco. It was the first time members of both Phish and the Dead shared the stage together. On February 12, 2006, Anastasio joined Lesh again for a full show at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. He did so again on October 20, 2007, in Glens Falls, New York.
*SerialPod is a trio featuring Anastasio, Gordon and Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann. On December 17, 2005, the band performed at the 14th annual Warren Haynes Christmas Jam in Asheville, North Carolina. The group performed a series of Grateful Dead and Phish classics, plus covers from Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix, and others. Ivan Neville joined the group on keyboards for much of the performance.
*A quartet consisting of the Benevento/Russo Duo, Gordon and Anastasio traded opening and closing spots with Phil Lesh and Friends during their co-headlining summer 2006 tour before touring on their own for a number of shows in July 2006.
* Ghosts of the Forest is a side project for Anastasio and Fishman, which also features vocalist Jennifer Hartswick, guitarist Celisse Henderson, bassist Tony Markellis, and keyboardist Ray Paczkowski. The group was formed in 2018 and performed a short tour in the spring of 2019. The &quot;Ghosts of the Forest&quot; album, which is credited to Anastasio as a solo artist, was released on April 12, 2019.

===Trey Anastasio Band===

Trey Anastasio Band debuted in 1998 as Eight Foot Fluorescent Tubes, as a local band in Vermont fronted by Anastasio, on April 17 of that year at the opening week of the nightclub Higher Ground, co-owned by his brother-in-law. The band debuted a number of songs heard in Anastasio&#x27;s live performances today, including &quot;First Tube&quot;, &quot;Last Tube&quot;, and &quot;Mozambique&quot;. The Trio in 1999 was an evolution of Eight Foot Fluorescent Tubes. Anastasio&#x27;s first solo tour was with the trio, which included himself, Russ Lawton, and Tony Markellis. Markellis was an early influence on Anastasio and seeing the bassist perform with the Unknown Blues Band was a major reason he decided to attend UVM. The trio reunited in late 2008 (along with keyboardist Ray Packowski) for a tour of the Northeast United States. The band expanded to a sextet in 2000 with three horn players added to the band (Dave Grippo on alto sax, Jennifer Hartswick on trumpet and tuba, and Andy Moroz on trombone). Some of the music originally performed by the sextet was later seen on his 2002 release, &quot;Trey Anastasio&quot;. A year later they evolved into The Octet which added Ray Paczkowski on keyboards and Russell Remington on tenor sax and flute; and The Dectet in 2002 through 2004 explored complex arrangements and changes of some songs included on &quot;Trey Anastasio&quot;, and was an evolved version of the octet, now a ten-piece band with the addition of Peter Apfelbaum on baritone sax and percussion, and Cyro Baptista on percussion.

On August 10, 2008, Trey Anastasio and Classic TAB played a set at the All Points West Music &amp; Arts Festival at Liberty State Park in New Jersey. They opened with &quot;Sand&quot; and played a few other classic Anastasio/Markellis/Lawton compositions (songs that were also later recorded by Phish) including &quot;Gotta Jibboo&quot; and &quot;Heavy Things&quot;.

On the twentieth anniversary of the original Eight Foot Fluorescent Tubes show, April 17, 2018, Anastasio, Markellis and Lawton embarked on a tour featuring performances of Anastasio songs previously performed by Phish, such as &quot;No Men In No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, &quot;Camel Walk&quot; and &quot;Party Time&quot; (written by Jon Fishman).

===Solo work===

Anastasio was featured on the album &quot;True Love&quot; by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Gwen Stefani / No Doubt, Ben Harper, Bonnie Raitt, Manu Chao, The Roots, Ryan Adams, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, Ken Boothe, and The Skatalites. Anastasio can be heard playing guitar on the song &quot;Sweet and Dandy&quot;.

In September 2004, he performed with the Vermont Youth Orchestra at Carnegie Hall.

In 2006, Anastasio toured with Mike Gordon and the Benevento/Russo Duo. The project, known unofficially as G.R.A.B. played a number of shows with Phil Lesh.

In July 2007, he released another instrumental album, &quot;The Horseshoe Curve&quot;, via his own Rubber Jungle Records.
On August 14, he made a surprise guest appearance in Saratoga Springs, New York during Dave Matthews Band&#x27;s performance at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. He sat in and jammed with the band during &quot;Lie in Our Graves&quot;.

In June 2008, Anastasio guested on the Robert Randolph Band&#x27;s set, who opened for an Eric Clapton concert.

On August 7, 2008, he played his first post-rehab electric show at the Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York debuting: &quot;Alaska&quot; (electric version; the song was debuted acoustic at Rothbury), &quot;Peggy&quot;, &quot;Gone&quot;, &quot;Backwards Down the Number Line&quot; (electric version; the song was debuted acoustic at Rothbury), &quot;Valentine&quot;, &quot;Greyhound Rising&quot;, and &quot;Light&quot;. Four of these seven songs have found their way into the Phish live repertoire and on official studio releases.

On September 27, 2008, Anastasio debuted &quot;Time Turns Elastic&quot;, an orchestral epic co-created with composer Don Hart, at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville Tennessee. The east coast premier of &quot;Time Turns Elastic&quot; was performed on May 21, 2009, with conductor Marin Alsop and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra at the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall in Baltimore, Maryland. The performance also included the debut of the orchestral version of Anastasio&#x27;s &quot;First Tube&quot;.

On September 12, 2009, Anastasio performed &quot;An Evening with Trey Anastasio and the New York Philharmonic&quot; at Carnegie Hall in Manhattan with the New York Philharmonic, playing various compositions including &quot;Divided Sky&quot;,&quot;You Enjoy Myself&quot;, and &quot;Time Turns Elastic&quot;. This concert was a benefit for his sister, through the Kristy Anastasio Manning Memorial Fund and the New York Philharmonic.

While not touring with Phish, Anastasio performs tours with both TAB and acoustic solo concerts.

On July 30, 2020, Anastasio released &quot;Lonely Trip&quot;, a collection of original songs written during the COVID-19 pandemic and recorded at his home studio in New York. The LP was mixed by Bryce Goggin and features lyrical collaborations with Tom Marshall and Scott Herman. Anastasio says the project reminded him of his pre-Phish 4-track home recordings.

In October 2020, Anastasio performed an eight-week residency at the Beacon Theatre in New York. The eight concerts were performed without an audience and streamed live every Friday from October 9 to November 27 for free on Twitch. Anastasio raised $1.2 million of donations from the Beacon Jams for his Divided Sky Foundation, which used those funds were used to purchase a property in Ludlow, Vermont to act as a drug rehabilitation center.

On March 11, 2022, Anastasio released his first all-acoustic solo album, &quot;Mercy&quot;. The nine-song album was produced by Bryce Goggin and Robert Stevenson, and mixed by Mike Fahey. It was intended as a follow-up to &quot;Lonely Trip&quot;, with Anastasio saying the songs were inspired by further time spent in isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic: &quot;[&quot;Mercy&quot;] is like a bookend. It&#x27;s two years since we went into hiding. This is still going on, and it&#x27;s an even lonelier trip.&quot; Upon the album&#x27;s release, Anastasio described songwriting as one of his greatest joys.

===Other projects===
*Space Antelope played from 1982 to 1983, featuring Anastasio, The Dude of Life, Doug Parsons (drums, English teacher at the Boys&#x27; Latin School of Maryland), Dudley Taft and others. The band performed originals as well as covers from Rush, The Velvet Underground, and others.
*Surrender to the Air – 1995–1996; An experimental band, playing long sections of improvisation all connected by segments conducted by Anastasio. The group released a self-titled album in March 1996. It featured several members of the late Sun Ra&#x27;s big band, the Arkestra, which was (among other modes) an archetypical free jazz ensemble.
*The Vermont Youth Orchestra has performed with Anastasio on a number of occasions, including a performance at Carnegie Hall. Anastasio&#x27;s attraction to complex compositions was apparent on his 2004 release, &quot;Seis De Mayo&quot;, which included some of his work with the Vermont Youth Orchestra, as well as other smaller ensembles.
*Oysterhead – A trio that included Primus bassist Les Claypool and The Police drummer Stewart Copeland. The original intention of the band was to play a single concert, on May 4, 2000. The supergroup then released an album in 2001 named &quot;The Grand Pecking Order&quot;, and toured the United States in the Fall of 2001. The band reunited June 16, 2006, at the Bonnaroo Music Festival. The band reunited again in early 2020 but show plans stalled after Covid 19-Pandemic until 2021, where they headlined The Peach Music Festival.
*Dave Matthews &amp; Friends – A band formed in 2003 to tour in support of Dave Matthews&#x27;s solo debut &quot;Some Devil&quot;. Most of the band, including Anastasio, performed on the album.
*70 Volt Parade was Anastasio&#x27;s rock-based solo band featuring Ray Paczkowski on keyboards, Les Hall on guitar and synthesizers, and Skeeto Valdez on drums. The band was active throughout 2005.
*The Grateful Dead featured Anastasio on lead guitar and vocals as part of their final run of five &quot;Fare Thee Well&quot; 50th anniversary shows in Santa Clara (June 27 and 28, 2015) and Chicago (July 3, 4 and 5, 2015).
*Ghosts of the Forest - Featuring Trey Anastasio, Jon Fishman, Jennifer Hartswick, Celisse Henderson, Tony Markellis, and Ray Paczkowski. The band toured April 2019, and the self titled album was released April 12, 2019.

===Composition work===
In college, Anastasio studied composition under composer and arranger Ernie Stires. &quot;Guelah Papyrus&quot;, featured on Phish&#x27;s major label debut &quot;A Picture of Nectar&quot;, includes a Stires-influenced fugue instrumental section called &quot;The Asse Festival&quot; as a bridge between verses. In the early years of Phish, many of Anastasio&#x27;s compositions were through-composed, intricate and detailed in conception (for example, &quot;The Divided Sky&quot;, &quot;You Enjoy Myself&quot;, &quot;The Asse Festival&quot;, &quot;The Squirming Coil&quot;, &quot;Reba&quot;, &quot;Fluff&#x27;s Travels&quot;). Anastasio has used improvisation as the driving force behind simplified songwriting, particularly in the music he has written for his touring and recording projects apart from Phish.
Tom Marshall, a New Jersey computer systems professional and friend of Anastasio since his Princeton childhood, has been his primary songwriting collaborator, acting as lyricist. Anastasio has often pulled lyrics for his music from large notebooks of poems and prose kept by Marshall, and the pair have taken working retreats during which they wrote and/or recorded demos of new material. One such demo, &quot;Trampled By Lambs and Pecked by the Dove&quot;, has been commercially released, and many of the songs included on this release were reincarnated into Phish&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot;. Anastasio also writes a number of his own lyrics, including all of the lyrics on his first release with Columbia Records, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Shine&quot;.

One of Anastasio&#x27;s signature compositional techniques is the use of episodic (or organic) form. &quot;Fluff&#x27;s Travels&quot; and &quot;You Enjoy Myself&quot; are good examples of through-composed pieces which evolve from one musical idea to the other, never returning to a previous musical statement. This technique had been used in a rock music setting by relatively few before Phish (Frank Zappa and the Grateful Dead are two such examples).

Anastasio employs modal improvisation, first made popular by Miles Davis in the late 1950s/early 1960s.

Anastasio has also demonstrated skill at composing chamber music and music for orchestra, most notably on &quot;Seis De Mayo&quot;, his second solo album, and in his collaborations with the Vermont Youth Orchestra.

On September 27, 2008, Anastasio and Orchestra Nashville premiered a new work titled &quot;Time Turns Elastic&quot;, an original long-form piece that was orchestrated by composer and arranger Don Hart, and featured Anastasio on lead guitar and vocals. Anastasio previously collaborated with Hart and Orchestra Nashville in his orchestral performance of &quot;Guyute&quot; at Bonnaroo 2004. He performed the same composition at Carnegie Hall with the Vermont Youth Orchestra on September 14, 2004, and with the New York Philharmonic on September 12, 2009. Anastasio played the Walt Disney Concert Hall accompanied by the Los Angeles Philharmonic on March 10, 2012.

Anastasio&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Traveler&quot; was a collaboration with producer Peter Katis, whose longtime band The Philistines Jr. opened for Phish at UVM early in their career.

He was nominated for a 2013 Best Original score Tony Award, an Outstanding New Score Drama Desk Award, and Outstanding Music and Outstanding Orchestrations Outer Critics Circle Awards for the musical &quot;Hands on a Hardbody&quot;. That year, he also received the Frederick Loewe Award from the Dramatists Guild of America, which recognizes achievement in a theatrical score.

&quot;Hands on a Hardbody&quot; received nine 2012–2013 Drama Desk Awards, tying for most nominations, and winning in the Best Sound Design in a Musical category.

Anastasio co-wrote the music for &quot;Hands on a Hardbody&quot; (along with Amanda Green) for a Broadway opening in March 2013. After only 56 performances, the show closed on April 13, making it the &quot;fastest closing new musical of the season.&quot;

===Media appearances===
On March 15, 2010, Anastasio inducted one of his favorite bands, Genesis, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, claiming it was &quot;impossible to overstate what impact this band and musical philosophy had on me as a young musician. I&#x27;m forever in their debt.&quot; In addition to Anastasio&#x27;s speech, Phish appeared and performed two Genesis songs, &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; and &quot;No Reply At All&quot;. Genesis did not perform.

In June 2010, Anastasio appeared as a surprise musical guest on Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour&quot; stop at Tower Theater in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, where he performed &quot;Alaska.&quot;

&quot;Between Me and My Mind&quot;, a documentary film directed by Steven Cantor about Anastasio&#x27;s musical projects and Phish&#x27;s 2018 New Year&#x27;s Eve concert, was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2019.

==Guitar playing style and stage equipment==
Anastasio has employed the services of his friend, luthier and audio-technician Paul Languedoc (Phish&#x27;s soundman from 1986 to 2004) throughout his career. The highly resonant hollow-body electric guitars built by Languedoc for Anastasio, his Ibanez Tube Screamers, and Ross Compressors are key to his signature tone. Anastasio has several custom Languedoc hollow-body electric guitars, which make use of set maple necks with 24-fret ebony fretboards and dual Seymour Duncan SH-1 &#x27;59 humbucker pickups. During Phish&#x27;s 2018 Halloween &quot;musical costume&quot; set, Anastasio deviated from his Languedoc guitars and performed with a white Ed O&#x27;Brien model Fender Stratocaster.

Anastasio&#x27;s electric guitar technique is largely conventional; he does not typically make use of tapping techniques and does not usually play slide guitar (an example of when he does is in the Oysterhead section of Les Claypool&#x27;s &quot;5 Gallons of Diesel&quot;) but is known to be competent at both techniques. He normally uses a 2.0mm Adamas graphite guitar pick, but does not always do so. Melodically, he often incorporates modes, notably the dorian, mixolydian, and locrian, as well as pentatonic scales. In addition to scales, Anastasio makes abundant use of arpeggios while improvising as well as in his compositional material. Anastasio&#x27;s guitar influences include Robert Fripp, John McLaughlin, Jerry Garcia, Pat Metheny, Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix.

Effects processors play a crucial role in achieving Anastasio&#x27;s guitar tone. He uses effects such as two Ibanez TS-9 Tube Screamers (with Analogman&#x27;s Silver Mod) in sequence, the famous Univibe clone the Black Cat Vibe, and a Ross compressor. He switched to Analogman&#x27;s Bicompressor around 1998, dropped the compressor from his rig in 2002, and resumed use of the Ross Compressor in 2008 when a group of fans who desired the return of Anastasio&#x27;s &quot;signature&quot; Ross compressor sound pooled their resources to obtain a vintage Ross Compressor and sent it to Anastasio in an attempt to compel him to return the vintage effect pedal to his rig. Anastasio responded through friend and longtime collaborator Tom Marshall&#x27;s website explaining that he had lost his original Ross Compressor and that he was so touched that people cared about his effects and guitar tone that he would add the gift to his rig in the original configuration where it has remained ever since. He also uses a wah wah pedal (usually a Real McCoy Custom 3 by Geoffrey Teese), a Boomerang phrase sampler, Custom Audio Electronics Super Tremolo, Ibanez DM2000 delay, Alesis Microverb II (set to reverse), Whammy II pitch shifter, as well as a Leslie rotating speaker horn. In 2009, Anastasio added a Nova Repeater (delay). He controls these devices singularly or in batch with a Custom Audio Electronics RS-10 footpedal bank.

In the early 1990s, Anastasio employed a custom 2x12 speaker cabinet powered by either a 100W Mesa/Boogie Mark III head or, later, a Custom Audio Electronics 3-channel preamp and Groove Tubes power amp. In mid-1997, he switched to a pair of modified 1965 Fender Deluxe Reverb amps, one serving as a backup. When Phish returned in 2009, Anastasio was back to using the Mesa Boogie MKIII. In 2013 he added a Bogner Shiva amp to his arsenal, which can still be seen on stage as recently as Summer Tour 2014, though has not been used much during that tour.

Anastasio played three different acoustic guitars by Martin. The first is a D-45E which has East Indian Rosewood sides and back and a solid Sitka Spruce top. In 2005, Martin released a Trey Anastasio signature model acoustic guitar, with a dreadnought body with a curved Venetian cutaway. The guitar also has an Italian alpine spruce top, mahogany sides and a three-piece back with &quot;wings&quot; of mahogany and a center wedge of flame-figured Hawaiian koa (similar to a D-35). The guitar is finished with a flamed koa headplate and snowflake fingerboard inlays. As of 2017+, a Martin 1943 D28 is main guitar for standard tuning, Martin 1934 00028 for finger-style/open tunings, 1968 D35 for Drop and slack key tunings.

The history of Anastasio&#x27;s guitars, rig and equipment has been meticulously documented by music writer Ryan Chiachiere on the blog Trey&#x27;s Guitar Rig.

==Personal life==
Anastasio has been married to Susan Statesir, his college girlfriend, since August 13, 1994. They live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and have two daughters, Eliza and Isabella. His sister, Kristy Manning, died of cancer in April 2009. Anastasio is Catholic.

On December 15, 2006, Anastasio was stopped by police in Whitehall, New York, on a traffic violation. He failed a field sobriety test, and was subsequently arrested for possession of heroin and other drugs, and driving while intoxicated. Anastasio pleaded guilty to a reduced felony drug charge and spent 14 months participating in daily meetings, drug testing, and performing community service in the Washington County, New York, drug court program. In June 2008, after completing all phases of the New York State drug court, Anastasio graduated in good standing. His conviction was reduced to a misdemeanor. He has publicly thanked the officer who arrested him for turning his life around. Following this experience, he became an active participant in the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP), sharing his story on Capitol Hill, and working to help raise awareness and money, for a National Drug Court. Anastasio has maintained sobriety since January 2007, and detailed his opiate addiction, arrest and rehabilitation in a January 2019 &quot;GQ&quot; feature on sober musicians.

==The Barn==
&quot;The Barn&quot;, also known as &quot;The Farmhouse&quot;, is the name given to Anastasio&#x27;s rehearsal and recording facility in the countryside near Westford, Vermont in the state&#x27;s Lamoille Valley region. It was reconstructed between 1996 and 1998 from an existing structure, the Alan Irish Barn. The Barn has been used by Phish and most of Anastasio&#x27;s projects since 1999. The cover photo of the Phish album &quot;Farmhouse&quot; is of the outhouse located right next to The Barn.

Other artists who have recorded or performed at The Barn include Gordon Stone Band, Herbie Hancock, Béla Fleck, Swampadelica, John Patitucci, DJ Logic, Toots &amp; the Maytals, Tony Levin, The Slip, RAQ, John Medeski, Jerry Douglas, Nicholas Cassarino, Van Ghost and Addison Groove Project, Karina Rykman, among others.

Beginning in 2006, The Barn was transformed from a commercial recording facility into a studio environment providing accommodations and work space for artists participating in the Seven Below residency program.

<doc id="168714" wikidata="Q753623" url="?curid=168714" title="Separation of church and state">
<text>The separation of church and state is a philosophical and jurisprudential concept for defining political distance in the relationship between religious organizations and the state. Conceptually, the term refers to the creation of a secular state (with or without legally explicit church-state separation) and to disestablishment, the changing of an existing, formal relationship between the church and the state. The concept originated among early Baptists in America. In 1644, Roger Williams, a puritan minister and founder of the state of Rhode Island and The First Baptist Church in America, was the first public official to call for &quot;a wall or hedge of separation&quot; between &quot;the wilderness of the world&quot; and &quot;the garden of the church.&quot; Although the concept is older, the exact phrase &quot;separation of church and state&quot; is derived from &quot;wall of separation between Church &amp; State,&quot; a term coined by Thomas Jefferson in his 1802 letter to members of the Danbury Baptist association in the state of Connecticut. The concept was promoted by Enlightenment philosophers such as John Locke.

In a society, the degree of political separation between the church and the civil state is determined by the legal structures and prevalent legal views that define the proper relationship between organized religion and the state. The arm&#x27;s length principle proposes a relationship wherein the two political entities interact as organizations each independent of the authority of the other. The strict application of the secular principle of &quot;laïcité&quot; is used in France, while secular societies such as Denmark and England maintain a form of constitutional recognition of an official state religion.

The philosophy of the separation of the church from the civil state parallels the philosophies of secularism, disestablishmentarianism, religious liberty, and religious pluralism. By way of these philosophies, the European states assumed some of the social roles of the church in form of the welfare state, a social shift that produced a culturally secular population and public sphere. In practice, church–state separation varies from total separation, mandated by the country&#x27;s political constitution, as in India and Singapore, to a state religion, as in the Maldives.

==History of the concept and term==
The precise origin of the term itself dates to Jefferson and his correspondence with religious denominations, however, the entanglement of religion with government and the state dates back to antiquity when state and religion were often closely associated with one another.

===Antiquity and late antiquity===

The entanglement of religion with the state has a long history dating back at least to the prosecution and conviction to death of Socrates for impiety in ancient Athens.

An important contributor to the discussion concerning the proper relationship between Church and state was St. Augustine, who in &quot;The City of God&quot;, Book XIX, Chapter 17, examined the ideal relationship between the &quot;earthly city&quot; and the &quot;city of God&quot;. In this work, Augustine posited that major points of overlap were to be found between the &quot;earthly city&quot; and the &quot;city of God&quot;, especially as people need to live together and get along on earth. Thus, Augustine held, opposite to the separation of church and state, that it was the work of the &quot;temporal city&quot; to make it possible for a &quot;heavenly city&quot; to be established on earth.

===Medieval Europe===

For centuries, monarchs ruled by the idea of divine right. Sometimes this began to be used by a monarch to support the notion that the king ruled both his own kingdom and Church within its boundaries, a theory known as caesaropapism. On the other side was the Catholic doctrine that the Pope, as the Vicar of Christ on earth, should have the ultimate authority over the Church, and indirectly over the state, with the forged Donation of Constantine used to justify and assert the political authority of the papacy. This divine authority was explicitly contested by Kings, in the like of the, 1164, Constitutions of Clarendon, which asserted the supremacy of Royal courts over Clerical, and with Clergy subject to prosecution, as any other subject of the English Crown; or the 1215 Magna Carta that asserted the supremacy of Parliament and juries over the English Crown; both were condemned by the Vatican. Moreover, throughout the Middle Ages, the Pope claimed the right to depose the Catholic kings of Western Europe and tried to exercise it, sometimes successfully, e.g. 1066, Harold Godwinson, sometimes not, e.g., in 1305 with Robert the Bruce of Scotland, and later Henry VIII of England and Henry III of Navarre. The Waldensians were a medieval sect that urged separation of church of state.

In the West the issue of the separation of church and state during the medieval period centered on monarchs who ruled in the secular sphere but encroached on the Church&#x27;s rule of the spiritual sphere. This unresolved contradiction in ultimate control of the Church led to power struggles and crises of leadership, notably in the Investiture Controversy, which was resolved in the Concordat of Worms in 1122. By this concordat, the Emperor renounced the right to invest ecclesiastics with ring and crosier, the symbols of their spiritual power, and guaranteed election by the canons of cathedral or abbey and free consecration.

===Reformation===
At the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther articulated a doctrine of the two kingdoms. According to James Madison, perhaps one of the most important American proponents of the separation of church and state, Luther&#x27;s doctrine of the two kingdoms marked the beginning of the modern conception of separation of church and state.

Those of the Radical Reformation (the Anabaptists) took Luther&#x27;s ideas in new directions, most notably in the writings of Michael Sattler (1490–1527), who agreed with Luther that there were two kingdoms, but differed in arguing that these two kingdoms should be separate, and hence baptized believers should not vote, serve in public office or participate in any other way with the &quot;kingdom of the world&quot;. While there was a diversity of views in the early days of the Radical Reformation, in time Sattler&#x27;s perspective became the normative position for most Anabaptists in the coming centuries. Anabaptists came to teach that religion should never be compelled by state power, approaching the issue of church-state relations primarily from the position of protecting the church from the state.

In 1534, Henry VIII, angered by the Pope Clement VII&#x27;s refusal to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, decided to break with the Church and set himself as ruler of the Church of England, unifying the feudal Clerical and Crown hierarchies under a single monarchy. With periodic intermission, under Mary, Oliver Cromwell, and James II, the monarchs of Great Britain have retained ecclesiastical authority in the Church of England, since 1534, having the current title, &quot;Supreme Governor of the Church of England&quot;. The 1654 settlement, under Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Commonwealth of England, temporarily replaced Bishops and Clerical courts, with a Commission of Triers, and juries of Ejectors, to appoint and punish clergy in the English Commonwealth, later extended to cover Scotland. Penal Laws requiring ministers, and public officials to swear oaths and follow the Established faith, were disenfranchised, fined, imprisoned, or executed, for not conforming.

One of the results of the persecution in England was that some people fled Great Britain to be able to worship as they wished. After the American Colonies revolted against George III of the United Kingdom, the Establishment Clause regarding the concept of the separation of church and state was developed but was never part of the original US Constitution.

===John Locke and the Enlightenment===

The concept of separating church and state is often credited to the writings of English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704). Roger Williams was first in his 1636 writing of &quot;Soul Liberty&quot; where he coined the term &quot;liberty of conscience&quot;. Locke would expand on this. According to his principle of the social contract, Locke argued that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority. These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with his social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution.

In his &quot;A Letter Concerning Toleration&quot;, in which Locke also defended religious toleration among different Christian sects, Locke argued that ecclesiastical authority had to be distinct from the authority of the state, or &quot;the magistrate&quot;. Locke reasoned that, because a church was a voluntary community of members, its authority could not extend to matters of state. He writes:

At the same period of the 17th century, Pierre Bayle and some fideists were forerunners of the separation of Church and State, maintaining that faith was independent of reason. During the 18th century, the ideas of Locke and Bayle, in particular the separation of Church and State, became more common, promoted by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment. Montesquieu already wrote in 1721 about religious tolerance and a degree of separation between religion and government. Voltaire defended some level of separation but ultimately subordinated the Church to the needs of the State while Denis Diderot, for instance, was a partisan of a strict separation of Church and State, saying &quot;the distance between the throne and the altar can never be too great&quot;.

===Jefferson and the Bill of Rights===

In English, the exact term is an offshoot of the phrase, &quot;wall of separation between church and state&quot;, as written in Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802. In that letter, referencing the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, Jefferson writes:

Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should &#x27;make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,&#x27; thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.

Jefferson was describing to the Baptists that the United States Bill of Rights prevents the establishment of a national church, and in so doing they did not have to fear government interference in their right to expressions of religious conscience. The Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791 as ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States, was one of the earliest political expressions against the political establishment of religion. Others were the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, also authored by Jefferson and adopted by Virginia in 1786; and the French Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789.

The metaphor &quot;a wall of separation between Church and State&quot; used by Jefferson in the above quoted letter became a part of the First Amendment jurisprudence of the U.S. Supreme Court. It was first used by Chief Justice Morrison Waite in &quot;Reynolds v. United States&quot; (1878). American historian George Bancroft was consulted by Waite in the &quot;Reynolds&quot; case regarding the views on establishment by the framers of the U.S. constitution. Bancroft advised Waite to consult Jefferson. Waite then discovered the above quoted letter in a library after skimming through the index to Jefferson&#x27;s collected works according to historian Don Drakeman.

==In various countries==

Countries have varying degrees of separation between government and religious institutions. Since the 1780s a number of countries have set up explicit barriers between church and state. The degree of actual separation between government and religion or religious institutions varies widely. In some countries the two institutions remain heavily interconnected. There are new conflicts in the post-Communist world.
The many variations on separation can be seen in some countries with high degrees of religious freedom and tolerance combined with strongly secular political cultures which have still maintained state churches or financial ties with certain religious organizations into the 21st century. In England, there is a constitutionally established state religion but other faiths are tolerated. The British monarch is the supreme governor of the Church of England, and 26 bishops (Lords Spiritual) sit in the upper house of government, the House of Lords.

In other kingdoms the head of government or head of state or other high-ranking official figures may be legally required to be a member of a given faith. Powers to appoint high-ranking members of the state churches are also often still vested in the worldly governments. These powers may be slightly anachronistic or superficial, however, and disguise the true level of religious freedom the nation possesses. In the case of Andorra there are two heads of state, neither of them native Andorrans. One is the Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell, a town located in northern Spain. He has the title of Episcopalian Coprince (the other Coprince being the French Head of State). Coprinces enjoy political power in terms of law ratification and constitutional court designation, among others.

===Australia===

The Constitution of Australia prevents the Commonwealth from establishing any religion or requiring a religious test for any office:

The language is derived from the United States&#x27; constitution, but has been altered. Following the usual practice of the High Court, it has been interpreted far more narrowly than the equivalent US sections and no law has ever been struck down for contravening the section. Today, the Commonwealth Government provides broad-based funding to religious schools. The Commonwealth used to fund religious chaplains, but the High Court in &quot;Williams v Commonwealth&quot; found the funding agreement invalid under Section 61. However, the High Court found that Section 116 had no relevance, as the chaplains themselves did not hold office under the Commonwealth. All Australian parliaments are opened with a Christian prayer, and the preamble to the Australian Constitution refers to &quot;humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God&quot;.

Although the Australian monarch is Charles III, also British monarch and Supreme Governor of the Church of England, his Australian title is unrelated to his religious office and he has no special role in the Anglican Church of Australia, despite being “by the Grace of God King of Australia”. The prohibition against religious tests has allowed former Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane Peter Hollingworth to be appointed Governor-General of Australia, the highest domestic constitutional officer; however, this was criticised.

Despite inclusion in the &quot;States&quot; chapter, Section 116 does not apply to states because of changes during drafting, and they are free to establish their own religions. Although no state has ever introduced a state church (New South Wales restricted religious groups during the early colonial period), the legal body corresponding to many religious organisations is established by state legislation. There have been two referendums to extend Section 116 to states, but both failed. In each case the changes were grouped with other changes and voters did not have the opportunity to expressly accept only one change. Most states permit broad exemptions to religious groups from anti-discrimination legislation; for example, the New South Wales act allowing same-sex couples to adopt children permits religious adoption agencies to refuse them.

The current situation, described as a &quot;principle of state neutrality&quot; rather than &quot;separation of church and state&quot;, has been criticised by both secularists and religious groups. On the one hand, secularists have argued that government neutrality to religions leads to a &quot;flawed democrac[y]&quot; or even a &quot;pluralistic theocracy&quot; as the government cannot be neutral towards the religion of people who do not have one. On the other hand, religious groups and others have been concerned that state governments are restricting them from exercising their religion by preventing them from criticising other groups and forcing them to do unconscionable acts.

===Azerbaijan===

Islam is the dominant religion in Azerbaijan, with 96% of Azerbaijanis being Muslim, Shia being in the majority. However, Azerbaijan is officially a secular state. According to the Constitution of Azerbaijan, the state and mosque are separate. Article 7 of the Constitution defines the Azerbaijani state as a democratic, legal, secular, unitary republic. Therefore, the Constitution provides freedom of religions and beliefs.

The Azerbaijani State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations controls the relations between the state and religions.

Ethnic minorities such as Russians, Georgians, Jews, Lezgis, Avars, Udis and Kurds with different religious beliefs to Islam all live in Azerbaijan. Several religions are practiced in Azerbaijan. There are many Orthodox and Catholic churches in different regions of Azerbaijan. At the same time, the Azerbaijani government has been frequently accused of desecrating Armenian Christian heritage and appropriating Armenian churches on its territory.

===Brazil===

Brazil was a colony of the Portuguese Empire from 1500 until the nation&#x27;s independence from Portugal, in 1822, during which time Roman Catholicism was the official state religion. With the rise of the Empire of Brazil, although Catholicism retained its status as the official creed, subsidized by the state, other religions were allowed to flourish, as the 1824 Constitution secured religious freedom. The fall of the Empire, in 1889, gave way to a Republican regime, and a Constitution was enacted in 1891, which severed the ties between church and state; Republican ideologues such as Benjamin Constant and Ruy Barbosa were influenced by laïcité in France and the United States. The 1891 Constitutional separation of Church and State has been maintained ever since. The current Constitution of Brazil, in force since 1988, ensures the right to religious freedom, bans the establishment of state churches and any relationship of &quot;dependence or alliance&quot; of officials with religious leaders, except for &quot;collaboration in the public interest, defined by law&quot;.

In 2007, Brasil para Todos was formed with the aim of removing religious symbols from government buildings with separation of church and state in mind.

====Quebec====
===China===

China, during the era of the Han dynasty, had established Confucianism as the official state ideology over that of Legalism of the preceding Qin dynasty over two millennium ago. In post-1949 modern-day China, owing to such historic experiences as the Taiping Rebellion, the Chinese Communist Party had no diplomatic relations with the Vatican for over half a century, and maintained separation of the temples (be it a daoguan, a Buddhist temple, a church or a mosque) from state affairs, and although the Chinese government&#x27;s methods are disputed by the Vatican, Pope Benedict XVI had accepted the ordination of a bishop who was pre-selected by the government for the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association in 2007. However, a new ordination of a Catholic bishop in November 2010, according to BBC News, has threatened to &quot;damage ties&quot; between China and the Vatican.

The Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China guarantees, in its article 36, that:

===Croatia===
Freedom of religion in Croatia is a right defined by the Constitution, which also defines all religious communities as equal in front of the law and separated from the state. Principle of separation of church and state is enshrined in Article 41 which states:

All religious communities shall be equal before the law and clearly separated from the state. Religious communities shall be free, in compliance with law, to publicly conduct religious services, open schools, academies or other institutions, and welfare and charitable organizations and to manage them, and they shall enjoy the protection and assistance of the state in their activities.

Public schools allow religious teaching () in cooperation with religious communities having agreements with the state, but attendance is not mandated. Religion classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools.

The public holidays also include religious festivals of: Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints&#x27; Day, Christmas, and Boxing Day. The primary holidays are based on the Catholic liturgical year, but other believers are allowed to celebrate other major religious holidays as well.

The Roman Catholic Church in Croatia receives state financial support and other benefits established in concordats between the Government and the Vatican. In an effort to further define their rights and privileges within a legal framework, the government has additional agreements with other 14 religious communities: Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC), Islamic Community of Croatia, Evangelical Church, Reformed Christian Church in Croatia, Protestant Reformed Christian Church in Croatia, Pentecostal Church, Union of Pentecostal Churches of Christ, Christian Adventist Church, Union of Baptist Churches, Church of God, Church of Christ, Reformed Movement of Seventh-day Adventists, Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Macedonian Orthodox Church and Croatian Old Catholic Church.

===Finland===
The Constitution of Finland declares that the organization and administration of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is regulated in the Church Act, and the organization and administration of the Finnish Orthodox Church in the Orthodox Church Act. The Lutheran Church and the Orthodox Church thus have a special status in Finnish legislation compared to other religious bodies, and are variously referred to as either &quot;national churches&quot; or &quot;state churches&quot;, although officially they do not hold such positions. The Lutheran Church does not consider itself a state church, and prefers to use the term &quot;national church&quot;.

The Finnish Freethinkers Association has criticized the official endorsement of the two churches by the Finnish state, and has campaigned for the separation of church and state.

===France===

The French version of separation of church and state, called &quot;laïcité&quot;, is a product of French history and philosophy. It was formalized in a 1905 law providing for the separation of church and state, that is, the separation of religion from political power.

This model of a secularist state protects the religious institutions from state interference, but with public religious expression to some extent frowned upon. This aims to protect the public power from the influences of religious institutions, especially in public office. Religious views which contain no idea of public responsibility, or which consider religious opinion irrelevant to politics, are not impinged upon by this type of secularization of public discourse.

Former President Nicolas Sarkozy criticised &quot;negative &quot; and talked about a &quot;positive &quot; that recognizes the contribution of faith to French culture, history and society, allows for faith in the public discourse and for government subsidies for faith-based groups. He visited the Pope in December 2007 and publicly emphasized France&#x27;s Catholic roots, while highlighting the importance of freedom of thought, advocating that faith should come back into the public sphere. François Hollande took a very different position during the 2012 presidential election, promising to insert the concept of into the constitution. In fact, the French constitution only says that the French Republic is &quot;&quot; but no article in the 1905 law or in the constitution defines .

Nevertheless, there are certain entanglements in France which include:
* The most significant example consists in two areas, Alsace and Moselle (see for further detail), where the 1802 Concordat between France and the Holy See still prevails because the area was part of Germany when the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State was passed and the attempt of the laicist Cartel des gauches in 1924 failed due to public protests. Catholic priests as well as the clergy of three other religions (the Lutheran EPCAAL, the Calvinist EPRAL, and Jewish consistories) are paid by the state, and schools have religion courses. Moreover, the Catholic bishops of Metz and of Strasbourg are named (or rather, formally appointed) by the French Head of State on proposition of the Pope. In the same way, the presidents of the two official Protestant churches are appointed by the State, after proposition by their respective Churches. This makes the French President the only temporal power in the world to formally have retained the right to appoint Catholic bishops, all other Catholic bishops being appointed by the Pope.
* In French Guiana the Royal Regulation of 1828 makes the French state pay for the Roman Catholic clergy, but not for the clergy of other religions.
* In the French oversea departments and territories since the 1939 décret Mandel the French State supports the Churches.
* The French President is &quot;ex officio&quot; a co-prince of Andorra, where Roman Catholicism has a status of state religion (the other co-prince being the Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell, Spain). Moreover, French heads of states are traditionally offered an honorary title of Canon of the Papal Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, Cathedral of Rome. Once this honour has been awarded to a newly elected president, France pays for a &quot;choir vicar&quot;, a priest who occupies the seat in the canonical chapter of the Cathedral in lieu of the president (all French presidents have been male and at least formally Roman Catholic, but if one were not, this honour could most probably not be awarded to him or her). The French President also holds a seat in a few other canonical chapters in France.
* Another example of the complex ties between France and the Catholic Church consists in the : five churches in Rome (Trinità dei Monti, St. Louis of the French, St. Ivo of the Bretons, St. Claude of the Free County of Burgundy, and St. Nicholas of the Lorrains) as well as a chapel in Loreto belong to France, and are administered and paid for by a special foundation linked to the French embassy to the Holy See.
* In Wallis and Futuna, a French overseas territory, national education is conceded to the diocese, which gets paid for it by the State.
* A further entanglement consists in liturgical honours accorded to French consular officials under Capitations with the Ottoman Empire which persist for example in Lebanon and in ownership of the Catholic cathedral in Smyrna (Izmir) and the extraterritoriality of St. Anne&#x27;s in Jerusalem and more generally the diplomatic status of the Holy Places.

===Germany===
The German constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but there is not a complete separation of church and state in Germany. Officially recognized religious bodies operate as (corporations of public law, as opposed to private). For recognized religious communities, some taxes () are collected by the state; this is at the request of the religious community and a fee is charged for the service. Religious instruction is an optional school subject in Germany. The German State understands itself as neutral in matters of religious beliefs, so no teacher can be forced to teach religion. But on the other hand, all who do teach religious instruction need an official permission by their religious community. The treaties with the Holy See are referred to as concordats whereas the treaties with Protestant Churches and umbrellas of Jewish congregations are called &quot;state treaties&quot;. Both are the legal framework for cooperation between the religious bodies and the German State at the federal as well as at the state level.

===Greece===
In Greece, there is considerable controversy about the separation between the State and the Church, causing many debates in the public sphere regarding if there shall be a more radical change in the Article 3, which is maintaining the Greek Orthodox Church of Christ as the prevailing religion of the country. The actual debate concerning the separation of the Church from the State often becomes a tool for polarization in the political competition. More specifically, Article 3 of the Greek constitution argues the following:

# “The prevailing religion in Greece is that of the Greek Orthodox Church of Christ. The Orthodox Church of Greece, acknowledging our Lord Jesus Christ as its head, is inseparably united in doctrine with the Great Church of Christ in Constantinople and with every other Church of Christ of the same doctrine, observing unwaveringly, as they do the holy apostolic and synodal canons and sacred traditions. It is autocephalous and is administered by the Holy Synod of serving Bishops and the Permanent Holy Synod originating thereof and assembled as specified by the Statutory Charter of the Church in compliance with the provisions of the Patriarchal Tome of June 29, 1850 and the Synodal Act of September 4, 1928.
# The ecclesiastical regime existing in certain districts of the State shall not be deemed contrary to the provisions of the preceding paragraph.
# The text of the Holy Scripture shall be maintained unaltered. Official translation of the text into any other form of language, without prior sanction by the Autocephalous Church of Greece and the Great Church of Christ in Constantinople, is prohibited.”

Moreover, the controversial situation about the no separation between the State and the Church seems to affect the recognition of religious groups in the country as there seems to be no official mechanism for this process.

===India===
The Constitution of India uses the word &quot;Secular&quot; in a very unique way, differing from the western concept of &quot;Separation of the Church and the State&quot;. The western concept provides for a &quot;vertical&quot; separation in terms of position of the state and the religion in a political setup, where both co-exist. On the other hand, the Constitution of India defines secularism looking at the social implication of the religious practice. The article 25 of the constitution guarantees freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion subject to public order, morality, health and Fundamental Rights. The same article empowers the state to regulate secular activities which may be associated with religious practice, thus allowing state interference in the religion.

Dr B. R. Ambedkar, highlighted the social implication of religion in India in the constituent assembly debates. While defending for the state interference in prohibiting religious instruction in schools, he argued, On the same lines of social implication of the religion the constitution enables the state to open the Hindu temples for all classes and sections of society. 

In S. R. Bommai vs Union of India, 1994, the Supreme Court laid down the principle of &quot;Positive Secularism&quot; and a &quot;horizontal&quot; separation of secular - material world from a religious - spiritual world. Matters which are purely religious are left personal to the individual and the secular part is taken charge by the state on grounds of public interest, order and general welfare. Positive secularism, therefore, separates the religious faith personal to man and limited to material, temporal aspects of human life. Positive secularism believes in the basic values of freedom, equality and fellowship 

===Italy===

In Italy the principle of separation of church and state is enshrined in Article 7 of the Constitution, which states: &quot;The State and the Catholic Church are independent and sovereign, each within its own sphere. Their relations are regulated by the Lateran pacts. Amendments to such Pacts which are accepted by both parties shall not require the procedure of constitutional amendments.&quot;

===Ireland===
===Japan===
Shinto became the state religion in Japan with the Meiji Restoration in 1868, and suppression of other religions ensued. Under the American military occupation (1945–52) &quot;State Shinto&quot; was considered to have been used as a propaganda tool to propel the Japanese people to war. The Shinto Directive issued by the occupation government required that all state support for and involvement in any religious or Shinto institution or doctrine stop, including funding, coverage in textbooks, and official acts and ceremonies.

The new constitution adopted in 1947, Articles 20 and 89 of the Japanese Constitution protect freedom of religion, and prevent the government from compelling religious observances or using public money to benefit religious institutions.

===South Korea===

Freedom of religion in South Korea is provided for in the South Korean Constitution, which mandates the separation of religion and state, and prohibits discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs. Despite this, religious organizations play a major role and make strong influence in politics.

===Mexico===

The issue of the role of the Catholic Church in Mexico has been highly divisive since the 1820s. Its large land holdings were especially a point of contention. Mexico was guided toward what was proclaimed a separation of church and state by Benito Juárez who, in 1859, attempted to eliminate the role of the Roman Catholic Church in the nation by appropriating its land and prerogatives.

President Benito Juárez confiscated church property, disbanded religious orders and he also ordered the separation of church and state His Juárez Law, formulated in 1855, restricting the legal rights of the church was later added to the Constitution of Mexico in 1857. In 1859 the &quot;Ley Lerdo&quot; was issued – purportedly separating church and state, but actually involving state intervention in Church matters by abolishing monastic orders, and nationalizing church property.

In 1926, after several years of the Mexican Revolution and insecurity, President Plutarco Elías Calles, leader of the ruling National Revolutionary Party, enacted the Calles Law, which eradicated all the personal property of the churches, closed churches that were not registered with the State, and prohibited clerics from holding a public office. The law was unpopular; and several protesters from rural areas, fought against federal troops in what became known as the Cristero War. After the war&#x27;s end in 1929, President Emilio Portes Gil upheld a previous truce where the law would remain enacted, but not enforced, in exchange for the hostilities to end.

===Norway===
An act approved in 2016 created the Church of Norway as an independent legal entity, effective from 1 January 2017. Before 2017 all clergy were civil servants (employees of the central government). On 21 May 2012, the Norwegian Parliament passed a constitutional amendment that granted the Church of Norway increased autonomy, and states that &quot;the Church of Norway, an Evangelical-Lutheran church, remains Norway&#x27;s people&#x27;s church, and is supported by the State as such&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s church&quot; or is also the name of the Danish state church, Folkekirken), replacing the earlier expression which stated that &quot;the Evangelical-Lutheran religion remains the public religion of the State.&quot; The final amendment passed by a vote of 162–3. The three dissenting votes were all from the Centre Party.

The constitution also says that Norway&#x27;s values are based on its Christian and humanist heritage, and according to the Constitution, the King is required to be Lutheran. The government will still provide funding for the church as it does with other faith-based institutions, but the responsibility for appointing bishops and provosts will now rest with the church instead of the government. Prior to 1997, the appointments of parish priests and residing chaplains was also the responsibility of the government, but the church was granted the right to hire such clergy directly with the new Church Law of 1997. The Church of Norway is regulated by its own law () and all municipalities are required by law to support the activities of the Church of Norway and municipal authorities are represented in its local bodies.

===Philippines===
In Article II &quot;Declaration of Principles and State Policies&quot;, Section 6, the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines declares, &quot;The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable.&quot; This reasserts, with minor differences in wording and capitalization, a declaration made in Article XV, Section 15 of the 1973 Constitution.

Similarly, Article III, Section 5 declares, &quot;No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights.&quot;; echoing Article IV, Section 8 of the 1973 Constitution verbatim.

===Romania===

Romania is a secular state and has no state religion. However, the role of religion in society is regulated by several articles of the Romanian Constitution.

Art 29. Freedom of Conscience. (1) Freedom of thought and opinion, as well as freedom of religion, cannot be limited in any way. No one shall be coerced to adopt an opinion or adhere to a religious faith against their will.
(5) Religious cults are autonomous in relation to the state, which provides support including the facilitation of religious assistance in the army, hospitals, penitentiaries, retirement homes and orphanages.

Art 32. Right to education (7) The state assures freedom of religious education, according to the requirements of each specific cult. In state schools, religious education is organized and guaranteed by law.

===Saudi Arabia===

The legal system of Saudi Arabia is based on Sharia, Islamic law derived from the Quran and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and therefore no separation of mosque and state is present.

===Singapore===

Singapore is home to people of many religions and does not have any state religion. The government of Singapore has attempted to avoid giving any specific religions priority over the rest.

In 1972 the Singapore government de-registered and banned the activities of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in Singapore. The Singaporean government claimed that this was justified because members of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses refuse to perform military service (which is obligatory for all male citizens), salute the flag, or swear oaths of allegiance to the state. Singapore has also banned all written materials published by the International Bible Students Association and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, both publishing arms of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. A person who possesses a prohibited publication can be fined up to $2,000 Singapore dollars and jailed up to 12 months for a first conviction.

===Spain===

In Spain, commentators have posited that the form of church-state separation enacted in France in 1905 and found in the Spanish Constitution of 1931 are of a &quot;hostile&quot; variety, noting that the hostility of the state toward the church was a cause of the breakdown of democracy and the onset of the Spanish Civil War. Following the end of the war, the Catholic Church regained an officially sanctioned, predominant position with General Franco. Religious freedom was guaranteed only in 1966, nine years before the end of the regime.

Since 1978, according to the Spanish Constitution (section 16.3) &quot;No religion shall have a state character. The public authorities shall take into account the religious beliefs of Spanish society and shall consequently maintain appropriate cooperation relations with the Catholic Church and other confessions.&quot;

===Sweden===
The Church of Sweden was instigated by King Gustav I (1523–60) and within the half century following his death had become established as a Lutheran state church with significant power in Swedish society, itself under the control of the state apparatus. A degree of freedom of worship (for foreign residents only) was achieved under the rule of Gustav III (1771–92), but it was not until the passage of the Dissenter Acts of 1860 and 1874 that Swedish citizens were allowed to leave the state church – and then only provided that those wishing to do so first registered their adhesion to another, officially approved denomination. Following years of discussions that began in 1995, the Church of Sweden was finally separated from the state as from 1 January 2000. However, the separation was not fully completed. Although the status of state religion came to an end, the Church of Sweden nevertheless remains Sweden&#x27;s national church, and as such is still regulated by the government through the law of the Church of Sweden. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refer to a change of relation between state and church rather than a separation. Furthermore, the Swedish constitution still maintains that the Sovereign and the members of the royal family have to confess an evangelical Lutheran faith, which in practice means they need to be members of the Church of Sweden to remain in the line of succession. Thusly according to the ideas of cuius regio, eius religio one could argue that the symbolic connection between state and church still remains.

===Switzerland===

The articles 8 (&quot;Equality before the law&quot;) and 15 (&quot;Freedom of religion and conscience&quot;) of the Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation guarantees individual freedom of beliefs. It notably states that &quot;No person may be forced to join or belong to a religious community, to participate in a religious act or to follow religious teachings&quot;.

Churches and state are separated at the federal level since 1848. However, the article 72 (&quot;Church and state&quot;) of the constitution determine that &quot;The regulation of the relationship between the church and the state is the responsibility of the cantons&quot;. Some cantons of Switzerland recognise officially some churches (Catholic Church, Swiss Reformed Church, Old Catholic Church and Jewish congregations). Other cantons, such as Geneva and Neuchâtel are &quot;laïques&quot; (that is to say, secular).

===Taiwan===
===Turkey===

Turkey, whose population is overwhelmingly Muslim, is also considered to have practiced the laïcité school of secularism since 1928, which the founding father Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s policies and theories became known as Kemalism.

Despite Turkey being an officially secular country, the Preamble of the Constitution states that &quot;there shall be no interference whatsoever of the sacred religious feelings in State affairs and politics.&quot; In order to control the way religion is perceived by adherents, the State pays imams&#x27; wages (only for Sunni Muslims) and provides religious education (of the Sunni Muslim variety) in public schools. The State has a Directorate of Religious Affairs, directly under the President bureaucratically, responsible for organizing the Sunni Muslim religion – including what will and will not be mentioned in sermons given at mosques, especially on Fridays. Such an interpretation of secularism, where religion is under strict control of the State is very different from that of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and is a good example of how secularism can be applied in a variety of ways in different regions of the world. The exercise of their religion in Turkey by the Greek Orthodox and the Armenian Apostolic communities is partly regulated by the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne. No such official recognition extends to the Syriac communities.

===United Kingdom===

The Church of England, a part of the worldwide Anglican Communion, is an established church, and the British Sovereign is the titular supreme governor and cannot be a Roman Catholic. Until the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the monarch could not be married to a Catholic.

Around a third of state schools in England have a religious affiliation, with the vast majority being Christian. At faith schools, the worship must be in accordance with the religion or religious denomination of the school. In state run Christian schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (but not in privately run schools), there is a requirement for a daily act of worship that is &quot;wholly or mainly of a Christian character&quot;, although in England, up to 76% of Christian affiliated faith schools do not comply with the law and the requirement is not enforced by Ofsted. Non-Christian faith schools are exempt (instead having to have their own form of worship) and sixth-form pupils (in England and Wales) and parents of younger pupils can opt out. Official reports have recommended removing the requirement entirely. The High Court of the United Kingdom has ruled in favour of challenges, brought by pupil families supported by the British Humanist Association, to secondary-level religious studies exam syllabuses that excluded non-religious worldviews.

In England, senior Church appointments are Crown appointments; the Church carries out state functions such as coronations; Anglican representatives have an automatic role on Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education; and 26 diocesan bishops have seats in the House of Lords, where they are known as the Lords Spiritual as opposed to the lay Lords Temporal. The Lords Spiritual have a significant influence when they vote as a bloc on certain issues, notably moral issues like abortion and euthanasia. The Anglican Church also has specific legal rights and responsibilities in solemnised marriages that are different from other faith organisations. Non-religious couples can have a civil wedding with no religious elements, but non-religious humanist weddings are not yet legally recognised in their own right. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all schools, but parents can remove their children from these lessons, and sixth formers have the right to opt out.

The Church of Scotland (or Kirk) is the largest religious denomination in Scotland; however, unlike the Church of England it is Presbyterian and (since 1921) not a branch of the state, with the Sovereign holding no formal role in the Church other than being an ordinary member. However, though the Kirk is disestablished, Scotland is not a secular polity. The Kirk remains a national church to which the state has special obligations; it is conventional that the monarch, who is head of state, must attend the Church when he visits Scotland, and they swear in their accession oath to maintain and preserve the church. The state also gives numerous preferences to the Church of Scotland and Catholic Church, particularly in education. The blasphemy law, though it had fallen into disuse, was not abolished until 2024. Non-religious couples can have a civil wedding with no religious elements, and humanist weddings have been legally recognised since 2005 and enshrined in Scottish law since 2017.

The Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 (although certain border parishes remain part of the Established Church of England). Unlike the UK Government and to some extent the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government has no religious links, though state-funded religious schools are routinely approved in Wales.

The Church of Ireland was disestablished as early as 1871. Publicly funded Schools in Northern Ireland are either State or Catholic maintained schools. State schools can be classed as: Controlled (by the Education Authority), Voluntary Grammar, Integrated and Special Schools. Irish-Medium Schools are operated by both the State and the Catholic Church. Despite the common notion of &#x27;Protestant&#x27; and &#x27;Catholic&#x27; Schools among many citizens, all State schools accept all religions without bias, with the exception of Integrated schools which require a set ratio of 40:40:20 Protestant, Catholic and Other (Mixed or non-Christian Religious). An identification with the &quot;Protestant&quot; or &quot;Roman Catholic&quot; community is sought on equal opportunities-monitoring forms regardless of actual personal religious beliefs; as the primary purpose is to monitor cultural discrimination by employers. Atheists should select which community they come from; however, participation is not compulsory. Religious Education is compulsory for all children up to the age of 16, with the four major Church denominational bodies (The Catholic Church, The Presbyterian Church in Ireland, The Church of Ireland and the Methodist Church) agreeing on the content of the syllabus, focussing on Christianity and Secular Ethics. World Religions have to be introduced between the ages of 11 and 14.

===United States===
The First Amendment, which was ratified in 1791, states that &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.&quot; However, the phrase &quot;separation of church and state&quot; itself does not appear in the United States Constitution. The states themselves were free to establish an official religion, and twelve out of the thirteen had official religions. The First Great Awakening (c. 1730–1755) had increased religious diversity in the Thirteen Colonies, and this combined with the American Revolution prompted the five southernmost states to disestablish the Church of England between 1776 and 1790. The Second Great Awakening (starting c. 1790) further increased religious diversity and prompted another round of disestablishments including New Hampshire (1817), Connecticut (1818), and Massachusetts (1833).

The phrase of Jefferson (see above) was quoted by the United States Supreme Court first in 1878, and then in a series of cases starting in 1947. The Supreme Court did not consider the question of how this applied to the states until 1947; when they did, in &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot;, the court incorporated the establishment clause, determining that it applied to the states and that a law enabling reimbursement for busing to all schools (including parochial schools) was constitutional.

Prior to its incorporation, unsuccessful attempts were made to amend the constitution to explicitly apply the establishment clause to states in the 1870s and 1890s.

The concept was argued to be implicit in the flight of Roger Williams from religious oppression in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to found the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations on the principle of state neutrality in matters of faith.

Williams was motivated by historical abuse of governmental power and believed that government must remove itself from anything that touched upon human beings&#x27; relationship with God, advocating a &quot;hedge or wall of Separation between the Garden of the Church and the Wilderness of the world&quot; in order to keep religion pure.

Through his work Rhode Island&#x27;s charter was confirmed by King Charles II of England, which explicitly stated that no one was to be &quot;molested, punished, disquieted, or called in question, for any differences in opinion, in matters of religion&quot;.

Williams is credited with helping to shape the church and state debate in England and influencing such men as John Milton and particularly John Locke, whose work was studied closely by Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and other framers of the U.S. Constitution. Williams theologically derived his views mainly from Scripture and his motive is seen as religious, but Jefferson&#x27;s advocation of religious liberty is seen as political and social. Though no states currently have an established religion, almost all of the state constitutions invoke God and some originally required officeholders to believe in the Holy Trinity.

====Early treaties and court decisions====

====The Treaty of Paris====

In 1783, the United States signed a treaty with Great Britain that was promulgated &quot;in the name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity&quot;. It was dipped in religious language, crediting &quot;&#x27;Divine Providence&#x27; with having disposed the two parties to &#x27;forget all past misunderstandings,&#x27; and is dated &#x27;in the year of our Lord&#x27; 1783&quot;.

====The Treaty of Tripoli====

In 1797, the United States Senate ratified a treaty with Tripoli that stated in Article 11:

According to Frank Lambert, Professor of History at Purdue University, the assurances in Article 11 were:

...intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced. President John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers.

Supporters of the separation of church and state argue that this treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, confirms that the government of the United States was specifically intended to be religiously neutral. The treaty was submitted by President Adams and unanimously ratified by the Senate.

====Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States====

In the 1892 case &quot;Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States&quot;, Supreme Court Justice David Brewer wrote for a unanimous Court that &quot;no purpose of action against religion can be imputed to any legislation, state or national, because this is a religious people. ... [T]his is a Christian nation.&quot;

Legal historian Paul Finkelman writes that:
====Use of the phrase====
The phrase &quot;separation of church and state&quot; is derived from a letter written by President Thomas Jefferson in 1802 to Baptists from Danbury, Connecticut, and published in a Massachusetts newspaper soon thereafter. In that letter, referencing the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, Jefferson writes:

Another early user of the term was James Madison, the principal drafter of the United States Bill of Rights. In a 1789 debate in the House of Representatives regarding the draft of the First Amendment, the following was said:

Madison contended &quot;Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.&quot; Several years later he wrote of &quot;total separation of the church from the state&quot;. &quot;Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion &amp; Govt in the Constitution of the United States&quot;, Madison wrote, and he declared, &quot;practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.&quot; In a letter to Edward Livingston Madison further expanded:

We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts. do better without Kings &amp; Nobles than with them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Govt.
This attitude is further reflected in the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, originally authored by Jefferson and championed by Madison, and guaranteeing that no one may be compelled to finance any religion or denomination:

Under the United States Constitution, the treatment of religion by the government is broken into two clauses: the establishment clause and the free exercise clause. Both are discussed in regard to whether certain state actions would amount to an impermissible government establishment of religion.

The phrase was also mentioned in an eloquent letter written by President John Tyler on July 10, 1843. During the 1960 presidential campaign the potential influence of the Catholic Church on John F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidency was raised. If elected, it would be the first time that a Catholic would occupy the highest office in the United States. John F. Kennedy, in his on 12 September 1960, addressed the question directly, saying:

The United States Supreme Court has referenced the separation of church and state metaphor more than 25 times, though not always fully embracing the principle, saying &quot;the metaphor itself is not a wholly accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists between church and state&quot;. In &quot;Reynolds&quot;, the Court denied the free exercise claims of Mormons in the Utah territory who claimed polygamy was an aspect of their religious freedom. The Court used the phrase again by Justice Hugo Black in 1947 in &quot;Everson&quot;. In a minority opinion in &quot;Wallace v. Jaffree&quot;, Justice Rehnquist presented the view that the establishment clause was intended to protect local establishments of religion from federal interference. Rehnquist made numerous citations of cases that rebutted the idea of a total wall of separation between Church and State. A result of such reasoning was Supreme Court support for government payments to faith-based community projects. Justice Scalia has criticized the metaphor as a bulldozer removing religion from American public life.

====Pledge of Allegiance====
Critics of the American Pledge of Allegiance have argued that the use of the phrase &quot;under God&quot; violates the separation of church and state. While the pledge was created by Francis Bellamy in 1891, in 1954, the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization, campaigned with other groups to have the words &quot;under God&quot; added to the pledge. On June 14, 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the bill to make the addition.

Since then, critics have challenged the existence of the phrase in the Pledge. In 2004, Michael Newdow, an ordained atheist minister of the Universal Life Church challenged a Californian law which required students to recite the pledge. He said the law violated the First Amendment&#x27;s Establishment Clause. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the school system in &quot;Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow&quot; due to the fact that the father could not claim sufficient custody of the child over his ex-wife who was the legal guardian and had opposed the lawsuit.

===Uruguay===
In Uruguay the principle of separation of church and state is enshrined together with the religious freedom in Article 5 of the Constitution, which states: &quot;All religious cults are free in Uruguay. The State does not support any religion. It recognizes the Catholic Church the domain of all temples that have been totally or partially built with funds from the National Treasury, excepting only the chapels intended for the service of asylums, hospitals, prisons or other public establishments. It also declares temples exempt from all types of taxes dedicated to the worship of various religions.&quot;

The separation between church and state was officially declared in the Constitution of 1918 and preserved in the following ones. The secularization of the country, however, began at the beginning of the 20th century during the first administration of President José Batlle y Ordoñez as part of the reforms that sought the firm positioning of the State in the public sphere. The measures included the prohibition of religious symbols in public hospitals and government buildings, as well as the suppression of religious teaching in public schools.

==Religious views==

===Islam===
The separation of mosque and state happened very early on in Islamic history. Muslim scholars were endowed and separated from the state, which they became very critical of. The state needed the scholars to legitimize their rule while the scholars did not need the state. Thus, the scholars were generally independent, with some bumps in history like the mihna being the exception rather than the rule. Richard Bulliet writes that during the colonial and postcolonial periods of the Muslim world, a main goal of the political tyrants was to remove the independence of the scholars via removing their economic and social independence. The Constitution of Medina which is often discussed as an early form of secular governance, providing equal religious and ocmunal rights to Muslims, Jewish people, and pagans while treating them as together in the identity of the nation state.

====Ahmadiyya====
According to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community&#x27;s understanding of Islam, Islamic principles state that the politics of government should be separate from the doctrine of religion. Special preference should not be given to a Muslim over a non-Muslim.

===Christianity===
Historically, the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have deemed a close relationship between church and state desirable wherever possible as per the 2105 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The Orthodox churches have historically at times formed a &quot;symphonia&quot; with the state, whether de jure or de facto. On the other hand, while some Protestants hold views similar to those above, some Protestants refuse to vote, carry arms, or participate in civil government in any way, often leading to their persecution, as happened to Anabaptists, their descendants including the Amish, Mennonites, and Quakers, in the 20th Century. Anabaptist Protestants and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, in many countries, believing by not participating they are closer to the Kingdom of God, since &quot;Jesus answered (Pilate), &#x27;My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight (to defend him).&#x27; &quot; – John 18:36. For them, the term &quot;Christian nation&quot; cannot be a valid governmental position, leaving only Christian people, possibly in Christian communities, beyond which are the &quot;things which are Caesar&#x27;s&quot; – Matthew 22:21.

====Methodism====
In its section on National Reform, the &quot;Book of Discipline&quot; of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection states, with respect to Church and state relations:

As such, the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Church advocates for Bible reading in public schools, chaplaincies in the Armed Forces and in Congress, blue laws (reflecting historic Methodist belief in Sunday Sabbatarianism), and amendments that advance the recognition of God.

====Reformed====
The Reformed tradition of Christianity (Congregationalist, Continental Reformed, Presbyterian denominations) have also addressed the issue of the relationship between the Church and state. In its 1870 General Assembly, the Presbyterian Church in the United States stated:

====Catholicism====
The first full articulation of the Catholic doctrine on the principles of the relationship of the Catholic Church to the state (at the time, the Eastern Roman Empire) is contained in the document Famuli vestrae pietatis, written by Pope Gelasius I to the Emperor, which states that the Church and the state should work together in society, that the state should recognize the Church&#x27;s role in society, with the Church holding superiority in moral matters and the state having superiority in temporal matters. Monsignor John A. Ryan speaks of this Catholic doctrine thusly: &quot;If there is only one true religion, and if its possession is the most important good in life, for states as well as individuals, then the public profession, protection, and promotion of this religion, and the legal prohibition of all direct assaults upon it, becomes one of the most obvious and fundamental duties of the state. For it is the business of the state to safeguard and promote human welfare in all departments of life.&quot;

In the 1864 Syllabus of Errors, issued by Pope Pius IX, the idea that &quot;the Church ought to be separated from the State, and the State from the Church&quot; is condemned.

In his 1906 encyclical, Vehementer Nos, Pope Pius X condemns separation, writing:

That the State must be separated from the Church is a thesis absolutely false, a most pernicious error. Based, as it is, on the principle that the State must not recognize any religious cult, it is in the first place guilty of a great injustice to God; for the Creator of man is also the Founder of human societies, and preserves their existence as He preserves our own. We owe Him, therefore, not only a private cult, but a public and social worship to honor Him.

&quot;Gaudium et spes&quot; (&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the 1965 Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, noted that &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot; The mission of the Church recognized that the realities of secularization and pluralism exist despite the traditional teaching on confessional statehood. Because of this reality of secularisation, it also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the secular world, viewing the laity as much-needed agents of change in order to bring about a transformation of society more in line with Catholic teaching. &quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;. This was further expanded in &quot;Apostolicam Actuositatem&quot;, Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

&quot;Apostolicam Actuositatem&quot;, the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s &quot;Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity&quot;, was issued 18 November 1965. The purpose of this document was to encourage and guide lay people in their Christian service. &quot;Since the laity, in accordance with their state of life, live in the midst of the world and its concerns, they are called by God to exercise their apostolate in the world like leaven, with the ardor of the Spirit of Christ.&quot; Francis Cardinal Arinze explains that lay persons &quot;...are called by Baptism to witness to Christ in the secular sphere of life; that is in the family, in work and leisure, in science and cultural, in politics and government, in trade and mass media, and in national and international relations&quot;.

The Catholic teaching in &quot;Dignitatis Humanae&quot;, the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s Declaration on Religious Freedom (1986), states that all people are entitled to a degree of religious freedom as long as public order is not disturbed and that constitutional law should recognize such freedom. &quot;If, in view of peculiar circumstances obtaining among peoples, special civil recognition is given to one religious community in the constitutional order of society, it is at the same time imperative that the right of all citizens and religious communities to religious freedom should be recognized and made effective in practice. At the same time, the document reiterated that the Church &quot;leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion and toward the one Church of Christ&quot;. The traditional teaching of the duty of society towards the Church is described in the current edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, number 2105.

Pope John Paul II, in his 2005 letter to the Bishops of France proposed that not only is Separation of State and Church permissible, it is in fact a part of the Church&#x27;s Social Doctrine. The Pope writes:

&quot;Correctly understood, the principle of &quot;laïcité&quot; (secularity), to which your Country is deeply attached, is also part of the social teaching of the Church. It recalls the need for a clear division of powers (cf. &quot;Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church,&quot; nn. 571–572) that echoes Christ&#x27;s invitation to his disciples: &quot;Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#x27;s, and to God the things that are God&#x27;s&quot; (Lk 20: 25). For its part, just as the non-denominational status of the State implies the civil Authority&#x27;s abstention from interference in the life of the Church and of the various religions, in the spiritual realm it enables all society&#x27;s members to work together at the service of all and of the national community. Likewise, as the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council recalled, the management of temporal power is not the Church&#x27;s vocation for: &quot;The Church, by reason of her role and competence, is not identified with any political community nor bound by ties to any political system&quot; (Pastoral Constitution &quot;Gaudium et Spes,&quot; n. 76 2; cf. n. 42). Yet, at the same time, it is important that all work in the general interest and for the common good. The council also stated: &quot;The political community and the Church... each serves the personal and social vocation of the same human beings. This service will redound the more effectively to the welfare of all insofar as both institutions practise better cooperation&quot; (&quot;ibid.&quot; 3)&quot; LETTER OF POPE JOHN PAUL II TO THE BISHOPS OF FRANCE

The Catholic Church takes the position that the Church itself has a proper role in guiding and informing consciences, explaining the natural law, and judging the moral integrity of the state, thereby serving as check to the power of the state. The Church teaches that the right of individuals to religious freedom is an essential dignity.

Catholic philosopher Thomas Storck argues that, once a society becomes &quot;Catholicised&quot; and adopts the Church as the state religion, it is further morally bound: &quot;&#x27;the just requirements of public order&#x27; vary considerably between a Catholic state and a religiously neutral state. If a neutral state can prohibit polygamy, even though it is a restriction on religious freedom, then a Catholic state can likewise restrict the public activity of non-Catholic groups. &quot;The just requirements of public order&quot; can be understood only in the context of a people&#x27;s traditions and modes of living, and in a Catholic society would necessarily include that social unity based upon a recognition of the Catholic Church as the religion of society, and the consequent exclusion of all other religions from public life. Western secular democracies, committed to freedom of religion for all sects, find no contradiction in proscribing polygamy, although some religions permit it, because its practice is contrary to the traditions and mores of these nations. A Catholic country can certainly similarly maintain its own manner of life.&quot;, further:

If, under consideration of historical circumstances among peoples, special civil recognition is given to one religious community in the constitutional order of a society, it is necessary at the same time that the right of all citizens and religious communities to religious freedom should be acknowledged and maintained.

The Church takes stances on current political issues, and tries to influence legislation on matters it considers relevant. For example, the Catholic bishops in the United States adopted a plan in the 1970s calling for efforts aimed at a Constitutional amendment providing &quot;protection for the unborn child to the maximum degree possible&quot;.

Benedict XVI regards modern idea of freedom (meaning the Church should be free from governmental coercion and overtly political influence from the state) as a legitimate product of the Christian environment, in a similar way to Jacques Le Goff. However, contrary to the French historian, the Pope rejects the conception of religion as just a private affair.

==Friendly and hostile separation==
Scholars have distinguished between what can be called &quot;friendly&quot; and &quot;hostile&quot; separations of church and state. The friendly type limits the interference of the church in matters of the state but also limits the interference of the state in church matters. The hostile variety, by contrast, seeks to confine religion purely to the home or church and limits religious education, religious rites of passage and public displays of faith.

The hostile model of secularism arose with the French Revolution and is typified in the Mexican Revolution, its resulting Constitution, in the First Portuguese Republic of 1910, and in the Spanish Constitution of 1931. The hostile model exhibited during these events can be seen as approaching the type of political religion seen in totalitarian states.

The French separation of 1905 and the Spanish separation of 1931 have been characterized as the two most hostile of the twentieth century, although the current church-state relations in both countries are considered generally friendly. Nevertheless, France&#x27;s former President Nicolas Sarkozy at the beginning of his term considered his country&#x27;s current state of affairs a &quot;negative &quot; and wanted to develop a &quot;positive &quot; more open to religion. The concerns of the state toward religion have been seen by some as one cause of the civil war in Spain and Mexico.

The French Catholic philosopher and drafter of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot;, Jacques Maritain, noted the distinction between the models found in France and in the mid-twentieth century United States.
He considered the U.S. model of that time to be more amicable because it had both &quot;sharp distinction and actual cooperation&quot; between church and state, what he called a &quot;historical treasure&quot; and admonished the United States, &quot;Please to God that you keep it carefully, and do not let your concept of separation veer round to the European one.&quot; Alexis de Tocqueville, another French observer, tended to make the same distinction: &quot;In the U.S., from the beginning, politics and religion were in accord, and they have not ceased to be so since.&quot;
