<text>Kyrgyzstan, officially the Kyrgyz Republic, is a landlocked country in Central Asia, lying in the Tian Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. Bishkek is the capital and largest city. Kyrgyzstan is bordered by Kazakhstan to the north, Uzbekistan to the west, Tajikistan to the south, and China to the east and southeast. Ethnic Kyrgyz make up the majority of the country&#x27;s over 7 million people, followed by significant minorities of Uzbeks and Russians.

Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s history spans a variety of cultures and empires. Although geographically isolated by its highly mountainous terrain, Kyrgyzstan has been at the crossroads of several great civilizations as part of the Silk Road along with other commercial routes. Inhabited by a succession of tribes and clans, Kyrgyzstan has periodically fallen under larger domination, for example the Turkic nomads, who trace their ancestry to many Turkic states. It was first established as the Yenisei Kyrgyz Khaganate. Later, in the 13th century, Kyrgyzstan was conquered by the Mongol Empire and under several Mongol dynasties; it regained independence, but was later invaded by the Dzungar Khanate. After the fall of Dzhungars, Kyrgyz and Kipchaks were an integral part of Kokand Khanate. In 1876, Kyrgyzstan became part of the Russian Empire, and in 1936, the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic was formed to become a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. Following Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s democratic reforms in the USSR, in 1990 pro-independence candidate Askar Akayev was elected president. On 31 August 1991, Kyrgyzstan declared independence from the USSR and a democratic government was established. Kyrgyzstan attained sovereignty as a nation state after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.

After independence, Kyrgyzstan was officially a unitary presidential republic. After the Tulip Revolution it became a unitary parliamentary republic; however, it gradually developed an executive president and was governed as a semi-presidential republic before reverting to a presidential system in 2021. Throughout its existence, the country has continued to endure ethnic conflicts, revolts, economic troubles, transitional governments and political conflict.

Kyrgyzstan is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Eurasian Economic Union, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organisation of Turkic States, the Türksoy community and the United Nations. It is a developing country ranked 117th in the Human Development Index, and is the second poorest country in Central Asia after neighbouring Tajikistan. The country&#x27;s transitional economy is heavily dependent on deposits of gold, coal and uranium.

==Etymology==

&quot;Kyrgyz&quot; is derived from the Turkic word for &quot;We are forty&quot;, believed to refer to the forty clans of Manas, a legendary hero who united forty regional clans. The Persian &quot;suffix -stan&quot; means &quot;place of&quot;.

The 40-ray sun on the flag of Kyrgyzstan is a reference to those same forty tribes and the graphical element in the sun&#x27;s center depicts the wooden crown, called tunduk, of a yurt—a portable dwelling traditionally used by nomads in the steppes of Central Asia.

The country&#x27;s official name is &quot;Kyrgyz Republic&quot;, used in international arenas and foreign relations. In the English-speaking world, the spelling &quot;Kyrgyzstan&quot; is commonly used, while its former name &quot;Kirghizia&quot; is rarely used.

==History==

===Early history===

The Kyrgyz state reached its greatest expansion after defeating the Uyghur Khaganate in 840 AD. From the tenth century, the Kyrgyz migrated as far as the Tian Shan range and maintained their dominance over this territory for about 200 years.

There is a storytelling tradition of the &quot;Epic of Manas&quot;, which involves a warrior who unified all of the scattered tribes into a single nation in the 9th century. The trilogy, an element of the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List, expresses the memory of the nomadic peoples.

In the 12th century, the Kyrgyz dominion had shrunk to the Altay Range and Sayan Mountains as a result of the Mongol expansion. With the rise of the Mongol Empire in the thirteenth century, the Kyrgyz migrated south. The Kyrgyz peacefully became a part of the Mongol Empire in 1207.
Issyk Kul Lake was a stopover on the Silk Road, a land route for traders, merchants, and other travelers from the Far East to Europe.
Kyrgyz tribes were overrun in the 17th century by the Mongols, in the mid-18th century by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty of China, and in the early 19th century by the Uzbek Khanate of Kokand. In 1842, the Kyrgyz tribes broke away from Kokand and united into the , led by Ormon Khan. Following Ormon&#x27;s death in 1854, the khanate disintegrated.

===Russian conquest===
In the late nineteenth century, the eastern part of what is today Kyrgyzstan, mainly the Issyk-Kul Region, was ceded to the Russian Empire by Qing China through the Treaty of Tarbagatai. The territory, then known in Russian as &quot;Kirghizia&quot;, was formally incorporated into the Empire in 1876. The Russian takeover was met with numerous revolts, and many of the Kyrgyz opted to relocate to the Pamir Mountains and Afghanistan.

In addition, the suppression of the 1916 rebellion against Russian rule in Central Asia caused many Kyrgyz later to migrate to China. Since many ethnic groups in the region were, and still are, split between neighboring states at a time when borders were more porous and less regulated, it was common to move back and forth over the mountains, depending on where life was perceived as better; this might mean better rains for pasture or better government during oppression.

===Soviet Kyrgyzstan===
Soviet power was initially established in the region in 1919, and the Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast was created within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (SFSR). The phrase Kara-Kirghiz was used until the mid-1920s by the Russians to distinguish them from the Kazakhs, who were also referred to as Kirghiz. On 5 December 1936, the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic was established as a constituent Union Republic of the Soviet Union.

After the Russian Civil War, the period of the New Economic Policy (NEP), began, which lasted roughly to 1928. The Bolsheviks made an effort to establish a standardized tax system, with higher taxes for nomads to discourage the wandering livelihood and they divided the Central Asia region into five nation-states. Kyrgyzstan developed considerably in cultural, educational, and social life, literacy was greatly improved. Economic and social development also was notable. Under Stalin a great focus was put on Kyrgyz national identity. The Soviet state was fighting tribalism: its social organization based on patrilineal kinship contradicted the concept of the modern nation state. In a region that did not previously know national institutions or consciousness, the process of nation-building was, from the indigenous perspective, a difficult and ambivalent one.

By the end of the 1920s, the Soviet Union developed a series of five-year plans, centered around industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture, including the creation of huge &quot;kolkhoz&quot; collective farming systems, needed to feed the new workers in the industries. Because of the plan&#x27;s reliance on rapidity, major economic and cultural changes had to occur, which led to conflicts. In Kyrgyzstan, Russian settlers acquired the best pasture land, creating much hardship for most of its original inhabitants, Kazakh, Kyrgyz and Turkmen nomads, who were also forced to settle down on soil that hadn&#x27;t enough agricultural potential. The changes caused unrest, and between 1928 and 1932, nomads and peasants made it clear through methods like passive resistance that they did not agree with these policies, in the Kirgiziya area also guerrilla opposition occurred. The region suffered relatively more deaths from collectivization than any other.

The early years of glasnost, in the late 1980s, had little effect on the political climate in Kyrgyzstan. However, the Republic&#x27;s press was permitted to adopt a more liberal stance and to establish a new publication, &quot;Literaturny Kirghizstan&quot;, by the Union of Writers. Unofficial political groups were forbidden, but several groups that emerged in 1989 to deal with the acute housing crisis were permitted to function.

According to the last Soviet census in 1989, ethnic Kyrgyz made up only 22% of the residents of the northern city of Frunze (now Bishkek), while more than 60% were Russians, Ukrainians, and people from other Slavic nations. Nearly 10% of the capital&#x27;s population were Jewish (a rather unique fact, for almost any place in the Soviet Union, except the Jewish Autonomous Oblast).

In June 1990, ethnic tensions between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz surfaced in the Osh Region (southern Kyrgyzstan), where Uzbeks form a minority of the population. The tensions between Kyrgyzs and Uzbeks in Osis led to 186 deaths. Attempts to appropriate Uzbek collective farms for housing development triggered the Osh Riots. A state of emergency and curfew were introduced and Askar Akayev, the youngest of five sons born into a family of collective farm workers (in northern Kyrgyzstan), was elected president in October of that same year. By then, the Kyrgyzstan Democratic Movement (KDM) had developed into a significant political force with support in Parliament. On 15 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet voted to change the republic&#x27;s name to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. The following January, Akayev introduced new government structures and appointed a new cabinet composed mainly of younger, reform-oriented politicians. In February 1991, the name of the capital, Frunze, was changed back to its pre-revolutionary name of Bishkek.

Despite these political moves toward independence, economic realities seemed to work against secession from the Soviet Union. In a referendum on the preservation of the Soviet Union in March 1991, 88.7% of the voters approved the proposal to retain the Soviet Union as a &quot;renewed federation&quot;. Nevertheless, secessionist forces pushed Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s independence through in August of that same year.

On 19 August 1991, when the State Emergency Committee assumed power in Moscow, there was an attempt to depose Akayev in Kyrgyzstan. After the coup collapsed the following week, Akayev and Vice President German Kuznetsov announced their resignations from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), and the entire bureau and secretariat resigned. This was followed by the Supreme Soviet vote declaring independence from the Soviet Union on 31 August 1991 as the Republic of Kyrgyzstan.
According to a 2013 Gallup poll, 62% of Kyrgyz people say that the collapse of the Soviet Union harmed their country, while only 16% said that the collapse benefitted it.

===Independence===
In October 1991, Akayev ran unopposed and was elected president of the new independent republic by direct ballot, receiving 95 percent of the votes cast. Together with representatives of seven other Republics that same month, he signed the Treaty of the Economic Community. The new leaders of three out of four Soviet Union&#x27;s founding republics, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, on 8 December 1991 signed the Belavezha Accords, denouncing the Union Treaty of 1922, declaring that the Union would cease to exist and proclaimed the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place.

On 21 December 1991, Kyrgyzstan agreed with the other four Central Asian Republics, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan to the Alma-Ata Protocols, formally entering the Commonwealth with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and Ukraine. Finally, Kyrgyzstan gained full independence on 25 December 1991. The following day, on 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. In 1992, Kyrgyzstan joined the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). On 5 May 1993, the official name changed from the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to the Kyrgyz Republic following the adoption of a new constitution.

As of today, Kyrgyzstan celebrates its Independence Day annually on August 31, the anniversary of its declaration of independence in 1991. Since independence, Kyrgyzstan has made developments such as creating genuinely free news media and fostering an active political opposition.

=== Recent history ===

In 2005, an uprising known as the &quot;Tulip Revolution&quot;, took place after the parliamentary elections in March 2005, forcing President Askar Akayev&#x27;s resignation on 4 April 2005. Opposition leaders formed a coalition, and a new government was established under President Kurmanbek Bakiyev and Prime Minister Felix Kulov. The nation&#x27;s capital was looted during the protests. 

Political stability appeared elusive, as various groups and factions allegedly linked to organized crime jockeyed for power. Three of the 75 members of Parliament elected in March 2005 were assassinated, and another member was assassinated on 10 May 2006 shortly after winning his murdered brother&#x27;s seat in a by-election. All four were reputed to have been directly involved in major illegal business ventures.

On 6 April 2010, civil unrest broke out in the town of Talas after a demonstration against government corruption and increased living expenses. The protests became violent, spreading to Bishkek by the following day. Protesters attacked President Bakiyev&#x27;s offices, as well as state-run radio and television stations. There were conflicting reports that Interior Minister Moldomusa Kongatiyev had been beaten. On 7 April 2010, President Bakiyev imposed a state of emergency. Police and special services arrested many opposition leaders. In response, protesters took control of the internal security headquarters (former KGB headquarters) and a state television channel in the capital, Bishkek. Reports by Kyrgyzstan government officials indicated that at least 75 people were killed and 458 hospitalized in bloody clashes with police in the capital. Reports say that at least 80 people died as a result of clashes with police.

A transition government had been established, led by former foreign minister Roza Otunbayeva (Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan), that by 8 April 2010 had taken control of state media and government facilities in the capital, but Bakiyev had not resigned from office.

President Bakiyev returned to his home in Jalal-Abad and stated his terms of resignation at a press conference on 13 April 2010. On 15 April 2010, Bakiyev left the country and flew to neighboring Kazakhstan, along with his wife and two children. The country&#x27;s provisional leaders announced that Bakiyev signed a formal letter of resignation prior to his departure.

Prime Minister Daniar Usenov accused Russia of supporting the protests; this accusation was denied by Russian Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin. Opposition members also called for the closing of the US-controlled Manas Air Base. Russia&#x27;s President Dmitry Medvedev ordered measures to ensure the safety of Russian nationals and tighten security around Russian sites in Kyrgyzstan to protect them against possible attacks.

The 2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes occurred between the two main ethnic groups—the Uzbeks and Kyrgyz—in Osh, the second-largest city in the country, on 11 June 2010. The clashes incited fears that the country could be heading towards a civil war.

Interim leader Otunbayeva sent a letter to the Russian president, Dimitry Medvedev, asking him to send Russian troops to help the country control the situation. Medvedev&#x27;s Press Attaché, Natalya Timakova, said in a reply to the letter, &quot;It is an internal conflict and for now Russia does not see the conditions for taking part in its resolution&quot;. The clashes caused a shortage of food and other essential commodities with more than 200 killed and 1,685 people hurt, . The Russian government, however, said it would be sending humanitarian aid to the troubled nation.

According to local sources, there was a clash between two local gangs and it did not take long for the violence to spread to the rest of the city. There were also reports that the armed forces supported ethnic Kyrgyz gangs entering the city, but the government denied the allegations.

The riots spread to neighboring areas, and the government declared a state of emergency in the entire southern Jalal-Abad region. To control the situation, the interim government gave special shoot-to-kill powers to the security forces. The Russian government decided to send a battalion to the country to protect Russian facilities.
Otunbayeva accused the family of Bakiyev of &quot;instigating the riots&quot;. AFP reported &quot;a veil of smoke covering the whole city&quot;. Authorities in neighboring Uzbekistan said at least 30,000 Uzbeks had crossed the border to escape the riots. Osh became relatively calm on 14 June 2010, but Jalal-Abad witnessed sporadic incidents of arson. The entire region was still under a state of emergency as Uzbeks were reluctant to leave their houses for fear of attacks by the mobs. The United Nations decided to send an envoy to assess the situation.

Temir Sariyev, deputy chief of the interim government, said there were local clashes and that it was not possible [for the government] to fully control the situation. He added that there were not sufficient security forces to contain the violence. Media agencies reported on 14 June 2010 that the Russian government was considering a request by the Kyrgyz government. An emergency meeting of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) was held on the same day (14 June) to discuss the role it could play in helping to end the violence.
Ethnic violence waned, according to the Kyrgyz government, by 15 June 2010 and Kyrgyz president Roza Otunbayeva held a news conference that day and declared that there was no need for Russia to send in troops to quell the violence. There were at least 170 people left dead by 15 June 2010 but Pascale Meige Wagner of the International Committee of the Red Cross said the [official] death toll was an underestimate. The UN High Commissioner told reporters in Geneva that evidence suggested that the violence seemed to have been staged up.
Ethnic Uzbeks threatened to blow up an oil depot in Osh if they failed to get guarantees of protection. The United Nations said it believed that the attacks were &quot;orchestrated, targeted and well-planned&quot;. Kyrgyz officials told the media that a person suspected to be behind the violence in Jalal-Abad had been detained.

On 2 August 2010, a Kyrgyz government commission began investigating the causes of the clashes. Members of the National Commission, led by former parliament speaker Abdygany Erkebaev, met with people from the predominantly ethnic Uzbek villages of Mady, Shark, and Kyzyl-Kyshtak in the Kara-Suu district of Osh Oblast. This National Commission, including representatives of many ethnic groups, was established by a presidential decree.

President Roza Otunbayeva also said in August 2010 that an international commission would be formed to investigate the clashes. The international commission conducted an extensive investigation and prepared a report—The Independent international commission of inquiry into the events in southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010 (KIC). It stated that &quot;The Provisional Government, which had assumed power two months before the events, either failed to recognize or underestimated the deterioration in inter-ethnic relations in southern Kyrgyzstan&quot;. The KIC concluded that the &quot;Provisional Government had the responsibility to ensure that the security forces were adequately trained and appropriately equipped to deal with situations of civil unrest&quot; but were unable to take necessary measures.

In late April 2021, a conflict over water escalated into one of the most serious border clashes between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan since independence in 1991.

In September 2022, armed clashes, including the use of artillery, erupted along much of the border between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

==Geography==


Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked country in Central Asia, bordering Kazakhstan, China, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. It lies between latitudes 39° and 44° N, and longitudes 69° and 81° E. It is farther from the sea than any other individual country, and all its rivers flow into closed drainage systems which do not reach the sea. The mountainous region of the Tian Shan covers over 80% of the country (Kyrgyzstan is occasionally referred to as &quot;the Switzerland of Central Asia&quot;, as a result), with the remainder made up of valleys and basins.
Issyk-Kul Lake, or Ysyk-Köl in Kyrgyz, in the north-eastern Tian Shan is the largest lake in Kyrgyzstan and the second largest mountain lake in the world after Titicaca. The lowest point is in Kara-Daryya (Karadar&#x27;ya) at 132 meters and the highest peaks are in the Kakshaal-Too range, forming the Chinese border. Peak Jengish Chokusu, at , is the highest point and is considered by geologists to be the northernmost peak over in the world. Heavy snowfall in winter leads to spring floods which often cause serious damage downstream. The runoff from the mountains is also used for hydro-electricity.

Kyrgyzstan has significant deposits of metals including gold and rare-earth metals. Due to the country&#x27;s predominantly mountainous terrain, less than 8% of the land is cultivated, and this is concentrated in the northern lowlands and the fringes of the Fergana Valley.

Bishkek in the north is the capital and largest city, with 937,400 inhabitants (). The second city is the ancient town of Osh, located in the Fergana Valley near the border with Uzbekistan. The principal river is the Kara Darya, which flows west through the Fergana Valley into Uzbekistan. Across the border in Uzbekistan it meets another major Kyrgyz river, the Naryn.

The confluence forms the Syr Darya, which originally flowed into the Aral Sea. , it no longer reaches the sea, as its water is withdrawn upstream to irrigate cotton fields in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and southern Kazakhstan. The Chu River also briefly flows through Kyrgyzstan before entering Kazakhstan.

Kyrgyzstan contains seven terrestrial ecosystems: Tian Shan montane conifer forests, Alai-Western Tian Shan steppe, Gissaro-Alai open woodlands, Tian Shan foothill arid steppe, Pamir alpine desert and tundra, Tian Shan montane steppe and meadows, and Central Asian northern desert. It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.86/10, ranking it 13th globally out of 172 countries.

===Climate===
The climate varies regionally. The low-lying Fergana Valley in the southwest is subtropical and extremely hot in summer, with temperatures reaching . The northern foothills are temperate and the Tian Shan varies from dry continental to polar climate, depending on elevation. In the coldest areas, winter temperatures drop below freezing for approximately 40 days, and even some desert areas experience constant snowfall during this period. In the lowlands the temperature ranges from around in January to in July.

==== Glaciers and climate change ====
===Enclaves and exclaves===
There is one exclave, the tiny village of Barak (population 627), in the Fergana Valley. The village is surrounded by Uzbek territory. It is located on the road from Osh (Kyrgyzstan) to Khodjaabad (Uzbekistan) about north-west from the Kyrgyz–Uzbek border in the direction of Andijan. Barak is administratively part of Kara-Suu District in Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s Osh Region.

There are four Uzbek enclaves within Kyrgyzstan. Two of them are the towns of Sokh, with an area of and a population of 42,800 in 1993, although some estimates go as high as 70,000 (99% are Tajiks, the remainder Uzbeks); and Shakhimardan (also known as Shahimardan, Shohimardon, or Shah-i-Mardan), with an area of and a population of 5,100 in 1993; 91% are Uzbeks, and the remaining 9% are Kyrgyz; the other two are the tiny territories of Chong-Kara (roughly long by wide) and Jangy-ayyl (a dot of land barely across). Chong-Kara is on the Sokh river, between the Uzbek border and the Sokh enclave. Jangy-ayyl is about east of Batken, in a northward projection of the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border near Khalmion.

There are also two enclaves belonging to Tajikistan on the Kyrgyz-Tajik border: Vorukh, and Lolazor. Vorukh has an area between , and a population estimated between 23,000 and 29,000, 95% Tajiks and 5% Kyrgyz. It is distributed among 17 villages and is located around south of Isfara on the right bank of the river Karavshin. Lolazor (Western Qalacha or Kayragach) is a small settlement near the Kyrgyz railway station of Kairagach.

==Politics==
=== Political system ===


The 1993 constitution defines the form of government as a democratic unicameral republic. The executive branch includes a president and prime minister. The parliament currently is unicameral. The judicial branch comprises a supreme court, local courts and a chief prosecutor.

In March 2002, in the southern district of Aksy, five people protesting the arbitrary arrest of an opposition politician were shot dead by police, sparking nationwide protests. President Askar Akayev initiated a constitutional reform process which initially included the participation of a broad range of government, civil and social representatives in an open dialogue, leading to a February 2003 referendum marred by voting irregularities.

The amendments to the constitution approved by the referendum resulted in stronger control by the president and weakened the parliament and the Constitutional Court. Parliamentary elections for a new, 75-seat unicameral legislature were held on 27 February and 13 March 2005, but were widely viewed as corrupt. The subsequent protests led to a bloodless coup on 24 March 2005, after which Akayev fled the country with his family and was replaced by acting president Kurmanbek Bakiyev.

On 10 July 2005, acting president Bakiyev won the presidential election in a landslide, with 88.9% of the vote, and was inaugurated on 14 August. However, initial public support for the new administration substantially declined in subsequent months as a result of its apparent inability to solve the corruption problems that had plagued the country since its independence from the Soviet Union, along with the murders of several members of parliament. Large-scale protests against president Bakiyev took place in Bishkek in April and November 2006, with opposition leaders accusing the president of failing to live up to his election promises to reform the country&#x27;s constitution and transfer many of his presidential powers to parliament.

Kyrgyzstan is also a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a league of 57 participating states committed to peace, transparency, and the protection of human rights in Eurasia. As an OSCE participating state, Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the U.S. Helsinki Commission.

In December 2008, the state-owned broadcast KTRK announced that it would require prior submission of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty programmes, which KTRK are required to retransmit according to a 2005 agreement. KTRK had stopped retransmitting RFE/RL programming in October 2008, a week after it failed to broadcast an RFE/RL programme called &quot;Inconvenient Questions&quot; which covered the October elections, claiming to have lost the missing material. President Bakiyev had criticised this programme in September 2008, while KTRK told RFE/RL that its programming was too negative. Reporters Without Borders, which ranks Kyrgyzstan 111th out of 173 countries on its Press Freedom Index, strongly criticised the decision.

On 3 February 2009, President Bakiyev announced the imminent closure of the Manas Air Base, the only US military base remaining in Central Asia. The closure was approved by Parliament on 19 February 2009 by a vote of 78–1 for the government-backed bill. However, after much behind-the-scenes negotiation between Kyrgyz, Russian and American diplomats, the decision was reversed in June 2009. The Americans were allowed to remain under a new contract, whereby rent would increase from $17.4 million to $60 million annually. The US military fully withdrew from Manas Air Base in 2014.
Kyrgyzstan is among the fifty countries in the world with the highest perceived level of corruption: the 2016 Corruption Perception Index for Kyrgyzstan is 28 on a scale of 0 (most corrupt) to 100 (least corrupt).

In 2010, another revolution erupted in the country (see: April uprising). President Bakiyev, together with his relatives, including his son Maksim and brother Janish—were forced to flee to Kazakhstan and then sought asylum in Belarus. Roza Otunbayeva, who was appointed interim president, announced that she did not intend to run for the Presidential elections in 2011. The election was held in November and won by Prime Minister Almazbek Atambayev, leader of the Social Democratic Party, and Atambayev was sworn in as president on 1 December 2011. Omurbek Babanov was appointed prime minister on the same day and was confirmed on 23 December 2011.

In 2015, Kyrgyzstan became a full-fledged member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EES) after it formally abolished customs controls along its border with Kazakhstan, other members are the former Soviet republics Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Armenia.
In October 2017, Sooronbay Jeenbekov, a former prime minister backed by incumbent Almazbek Atambayev, was elected as the new President of Kyrgyzstan. In foreign policy he saw the Kremlin as the country&#x27;s &quot;main strategic partner&quot; and China as an &quot;important strategic and trade partner&quot;, but he intended to seek more collaborative bilateral ties with European partners. On 7 August 2019, the Special Forces of Kyrgyzstan launched an operation against the residence of former President Almazbek Atambayev, supposedly based on charges of corruption made against him. In a meeting of the Security Council, President Jeenbekov accused Atambayev of violating the constitution. In October 2020, President Sooronbay Jeenbekov resigned after protests caused by irregularities in parliamentary elections on 4 October 2020.

In January 2021, Sadyr Japarov was elected as the new president after winning the presidential election by a landslide.

In April 2021, the majority of voters approved in the constitutional referendum a new constitution that will give new powers to the president, significantly strengthening the power of the presidency.

===Administrative divisions===

Kyrgyzstan is divided into seven regions (). The regions are subdivided into 44 districts (, ;). The districts are further subdivided into rural districts at the lowest level of administration, which include all rural settlements (&quot;aýyl ökmötü&quot;) and villages without an associated municipal government.

The cities of Bishkek and Osh have status &quot;state importance&quot; and do not belong to any region.

Each region is headed by an akim (regional governor) appointed by the president. District akims are appointed by regional akims.
The regions, and independent cities, are as follows, with subdivisions:

===Military===
The armed forces of Kyrgyzstan were formed after the collapse of the Soviet Union and consist of the Land Forces, Air Forces, internal troops, National Guard, and the border guard. The military works with the US Armed Forces, which leased a facility named the Transit Center at Manas at Manas International Airport near Bishkek until June 2014. In recent years, the armed forces have begun developing better relations with Russia including signing modernization deals worth $1.1bn and participating in more exercises with Russian troops. The Agency of National Security works with the military and serves similar purposes to its Soviet predecessor, the KGB. It oversees an elite counterterrorism special forces unit known as &quot;Alfa&quot;, the same name used by other former Soviet countries, including Russia and Uzbekistan. The police are commanded by the Ministry of the Interior Affairs, along with the border guard.

===Human rights===

Kyrgyzstan is classified as a &quot;hybrid regime&quot; in the Democracy Index, ranking 107th out of 167 for 2020. Kyrgyzstan was also ranked &quot;not free&quot; in the 2021 Freedom in the World report with a score of 28/100. In 2020, it was ranked &quot;partly free&quot; with a score of 39/100.

After the installment of a more democratic government, many human rights violations still take place. In a move that alarmed human-rights groups, dozens of prominent Uzbek religious and community leaders were arrested by security forces following the 2010 South Kyrgyzstan riots, including journalist and human-rights activist Azimzhan Askarov. A law banning women under the age of 23 from traveling abroad without a parent or guardian, with the purpose of &quot;increased morality and preservation of the gene pool&quot; passed in the Kyrgyz parliament in June 2013. American diplomats expressed concern in October 2014 when Kyrgyzstan lawmakers passed a law that imposes jail terms on gay-rights activists and others, including journalists, who create &quot;a positive attitude toward non-traditional sexual relations.&quot;

Kyrgyzstani activist and journalist Azimzhan Askarov was sentenced to life in prison in 2010. On 24 January 2017, a Kyrgyz court has reinstated a sentence of life imprisonment for Askarov.

In February 2024, the independent investigative media organization Kloop was ordered shut down by the Kyrgyz courts. This move drew criticism within the country and abroad.

==Economy==
The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic serves as the central bank of Kyrgyzstan.

Kyrgyzstan was the ninth poorest country in the former Soviet Union, and is today the second poorest country in Central Asia after Tajikistan. 22.4% of the country&#x27;s population lives below the poverty line.

Despite the backing of major Western lenders, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, Kyrgyzstan has had economic difficulties following independence. Initially, these were a result of the breakup of the Soviet trade bloc and resulting loss of markets, which impeded the republic&#x27;s transition to a demand economy.

The government has reduced expenditures, ended most price subsidies and introduced a value-added tax. Overall, the government appears committed to the transition to a market economy. Through economic stabilization and reform, the government seeks to establish a pattern of long-term consistent growth. Reforms led to Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 20 December 1998.

The Kyrgyz economy was severely affected by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting loss of its vast market. In 1990, some 98% of Kyrgyz exports went to other parts of the Soviet Union. Thus, the nation&#x27;s economic performance in the early 1990s was worse than any other former Soviet republic except war-torn Armenia, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, as factories and state farms collapsed with the disappearance of their traditional markets in the former Soviet Union. While economic performance has improved considerably in the last few years, and particularly since 1998, difficulties remain in securing adequate fiscal revenues and providing an adequate social safety net. Remittances of around 800,000 Kyrgyz migrants working in Russia contribute to the economy however in recent years, remittances have decreased.

Agriculture is an important sector of the economy in Kyrgyzstan (see agriculture in Kyrgyzstan). By the early 1990s, the private agricultural sector provided between one-third and one-half of some harvests. In 2002, agriculture accounted for 35.6% of GDP and about half of employment. Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s terrain is mountainous, which accommodates livestock raising, the largest agricultural activity, so the resulting wool, meat and dairy products are major commodities. Main crops include wheat, sugar beets, potatoes, cotton, tobacco, vegetables, and fruit. As the prices of imported agrichemicals and petroleum are so high, much farming is being done by hand and by horse, as it was generations ago. Agricultural processing is a key component of the industrial economy as well as one of the most attractive sectors for foreign investment.

Kyrgyzstan is rich in mineral resources but has negligible petroleum and natural gas reserves; it imports petroleum and gas. Among its mineral reserves are substantial deposits of coal, gold, uranium, antimony, and other valuable metals. Metallurgy is an important industry, and the government hopes to attract foreign investment in this field. The government has actively encouraged foreign involvement in extracting and processing gold from the Kumtor Gold Mine and other regions. The country&#x27;s plentiful water resources and mountainous terrain enable it to produce and export large quantities of hydroelectric energy.

The principal exports are nonferrous metals and minerals, woollen goods and other agricultural products, electric energy and certain engineering goods. Imports include petroleum and natural gas, ferrous metals, chemicals, most machinery, wood and paper products, some foods and some construction materials. Its leading trade partners include Germany, Russia, China, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. After Beijing launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, China has expanded its economic presence and initiated a number of sizable infrastructure projects in Kyrgyzstan.

In regards to telecommunication infrastructure, Kyrgyz Republic ranks last in Central Asia in the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Network Readiness Index (NRI)—an indicator for determining the development level of a country&#x27;s information and communication technologies. Kyrgyz Republic ranked number 118 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, unchanged from 2013 (see Networked Readiness Index).

Kyrgyzstan is ranked 78th among countries for economic freedom by the Heritage Institute.

The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a significant negative impact on the Kyrgyz economy that is reliant on services, remittances and natural resources. As a result, in order to mitigate the economic shock and preserve much of the development progress achieved in recent years the World Bank will provide support by financing several projects in the country.

===Tourism===


One of the most popular tourist destination points in Kyrgyzstan is the lake Issyk-Kul. Numerous hotels, resorts and boarding houses are located along its northern shore. The most popular beach zones are in the city of Cholpon-Ata and the settlements nearby, such as Kara-Oi (Dolinka), Bosteri and Korumdy. The number of tourists visiting the lake was more than a million a year in 2006 and 2007. However, due to the economic and political instability in the region, the number has declined in recent years.

===Science and technology===

The headquarters of the Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences is located in Bishkek, where several research institutes are located. Kyrgyz researchers are developing useful technologies based on natural products, such as heavy metal remediation for purifying waste water. Kyrgyzstan was ranked 99th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.

==Demographics==

Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s population is estimated at 6,586,600 in August 2020. Of those, 34.4% are under the age of 15 and 6.2% are over 65. The country is rural: only about one-third of the population live in urban areas. The average population density is 25 people per km2.

In the 2024 Global Hunger Index (GHI), Kyrgyzstan has a score of 6.8, ranking 36th among 127 countries with sufficient data. The hunger level is classified as low.

=== Ethnic groups ===
The nation&#x27;s largest ethnic group are the Kyrgyz, a Turkic people, who comprise 77.8% of the population. Other ethnic groups include the Russians (3.8%) concentrated in the north and the Uzbeks (14.2%) living in the south. Small but noticeable minorities include the Dungans (1.0%), Tajiks (0.9%), Uyghurs (0.5%), Kazakhs (0.4%), and other smaller ethnic minorities. The country has over 80 ethnic groups.

The Kyrgyz have historically been semi-nomadic herders, living in round tents called yurts and tending sheep, horses and yaks. This nomadic tradition continues to function seasonally (see transhumance) as herding families return to the high mountain pasture (or &quot;jailoo&quot;) in the summer. The sedentary Uzbeks and Tajiks traditionally have farmed lower-lying irrigated land in the Fergana valley.

Kyrgyzstan has undergone a pronounced change in its ethnic composition since independence. The percentage of ethnic Kyrgyz has increased from around 50% in 1979 to over 70% in 2013, while the percentage of ethnic groups, such as Russians, Ukrainians, Germans and Tatars dropped from 35% to about 7%. Since 1991, a large number of Germans, who in 1989 numbered 101,000 persons, have emigrated to Germany.

===Languages===
Kyrgyz is the state language of Kyrgyzstan. Russian is additionally an official language. 
Kyrgyzstan is one of five former Soviet republics to have Russian as a &quot;de jure&quot; official language, along with Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyz was adopted as the state language of Kyrgyzstan in 1991. Kyrgyzstan adopted Russian as an official language in 2000. The languages have different legal statuses.

Kyrgyz is a Turkic language of the Kipchak branch, closely related to Kazakh, Karakalpak, and Nogay Tatar. It was written in the Arabic alphabet until the twentieth century. The Latin script was introduced and adopted on Stalin&#x27;s orders in 1928, and was subsequently replaced by Cyrillic script in 1941. A reformed Perso-Arabic alphabet, created by the Kyrgyz intellectual and scientist Kasym Tynystanov is the official script of the Kyrgyz language in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. As a result of the pending language reform in neighboring Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan will be the only independent Turkic-speaking country in a few years that exclusively uses the Cyrillic alphabet. In April 2023, Russia suspended dairy exports to Kyrgyzstan after the chairman of Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s National Commission for the State Language and Language Policies, Kanybek Osmonaliev, proposed to change the official script from Cyrillic to Latin to bring the country in line with other Turkic-speaking nations. Osmonaliev was reprimanded by President Sadyr Japarov who then clarified that Kyrgyzstan had no plans to replace the Cyrillic alphabet.

Russian TV media enjoy enormous popularity in Kyrgyzstan, especially in the deeply Russified city of Bishkek and the Chüy Region, despite the percentage of Russians today being a fraction of that in 1989. According to World Values Survey in 2020, Russian was the language spoken at home for 55.6% of the population of Bishkek, and Kyrgyz was the second with 43.6%. However, the countrywide figure for the Russian was only 16.3%, whereas Kyrgyz was the home language of 70.9%. Uzbek language was the third most spoken home language with 10.7% according to the same survey. Russian media outlets have an enormous influence on public opinion in Kyrgyzstan, especially in areas such as human rights and international political developments.

Many business and political affairs are carried out in Russian. Until recently, Kyrgyz remained a language spoken at home and was rarely used during meetings or other events. However, most parliamentary meetings today are conducted in Kyrgyz, with simultaneous interpretation available for those not speaking Kyrgyz. According to an RFE/RL article from 2014, despite the attempts to raise the status of Kyrgyz, thousands of Kyrgyz are russifying their names every year (around 40,000), mostly for career prospects, and to remove themselves from the Russian blacklists (people who are to be deported upon entrance) by registering different names. There are also many Russian-language medium schools that are supported from the Russian foundations via the embassy of Russia in Bishkek which are better funded than the Kyrgyz language medium schools. Due to this, many ethnic Kyrgyz go to Russian language medium schools. Many high school students change their surnames annually; for example, 800 such changes were recorded in high school students in the region of Naryn.

=== Urban centres ===

===Religion===

Islam is the dominant religion of Kyrgyzstan and most Kyrgyz. The CIA World Factbook estimates that as of 2017, 90% of the population is Muslim, with the majority being Sunni; 7% are Christian, including 3% Russian Orthodoxy, and the remainder are other religions. A 2009 Pew Research Center report indicated 86.3% of Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s population adhering to Islam. The great majority of Muslims are Sunni, adhering to the Hanafi school of thought, although a 2012 Pew survey report showed that only 23% of respondents to a questionnaire chose to identify themselves as Sunni, with 64% volunteering that they were &quot;just a Muslim&quot;. There are a few Ahmadiyya Muslims, though unrecognized by the country. Later figures show a rise in the number of Muslims in the country.

During Soviet times, state atheism was encouraged. Today, however, Kyrgyzstan is a secular state, although Islam has exerted a growing influence in politics. For instance, there has been an attempt to arrange for officials to travel on &quot;hajj&quot; (the pilgrimage to Mecca) under a tax-free arrangement.

While Islam in Kyrgyzstan is more of a cultural background than a devout daily practice for many, public figures have expressed support for restoring religious values. For example, human rights ombudsman Tursunbay Bakir-Ulu noted, &quot;In this era of independence, it is not surprising that there has been a return to spiritual roots not only in Kyrgyzstan, but also in other post-communist republics. It would be immoral to develop a market-based society without an ethical dimension.&quot;

Additionally, Bermet Akayeva, the daughter of Askar Akayev, the former President of Kyrgyzstan, stated during a July 2007 interview that Islam is increasingly taking root across the nation. She emphasized that many mosques have recently been built and that the Kyrgyz are increasingly devoting themselves to Islam, which she noted was &quot;not a bad thing in itself. It keeps our society more moral, cleaner.&quot; There is a contemporary Sufi order present which adheres to a somewhat different form of Islam than the orthodox Islam.
The other faiths practiced in Kyrgyzstan include Russian Orthodox and Ukrainian Orthodox versions of Christianity, practiced primarily by Russians and Ukrainians respectively. A community of 5,000 to 10,000 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses gather in both Kyrgyz and Russian-speaking congregations, as well as some Chinese- and Turkish-speaking groups. A small minority of ethnic Germans are also Christian, mostly Lutheran and Anabaptist as well as a Roman Catholic community of approximately 600.

As part of the historic Kyrgyzstan German minority, there were around 200 Mennonites in Kyrgyzstan in 2022. One Mennonite community continues in the settlement of Rot-Front.

A few Animistic traditions survive, as do influences from Buddhism such as the tying of prayer flags onto sacred trees, though some view this practice rooted within Sufi Islam. There is also a small number of Bukharian Jews living in Kyrgyzstan, but during the collapse of the Soviet Union most fled to other countries, mainly the United States and Israel. In addition, there is a small community of Ashkenazi Jews, who fled to the country from eastern Europe during the Second World War.

On 6 November 2008, the Kyrgyzstan parliament unanimously passed a law increasing the minimum number of adherents for recognizing a religion from 10 to 200. It also outlawed &quot;aggressive action aimed at proselytism&quot;, and banned religious activity in schools and all activity by unregistered organizations. It was signed by President Kurmanbek Bakiyev on 12 January 2009.

There have been several reported police raids against peaceful minority religious meetings, as well as reports of officials planting false evidence, but also some court decisions in favour of religious minorities.

* &quot;Shyrdak&quot; and &quot;Ala-kiyiz&quot; carpets, manufactured by the process of felting, used for yurts. Inscribed in 2012 on the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding.
* Other textiles, especially made from felt
* &quot;Ala kachuu&quot;, &quot;bride kidnapping&quot;, traditional form of marriage in Kyrgyzstan
* Falconry
* Various dances

Illegal, but still practiced, is the tradition of bride kidnapping. It is debatable whether bride kidnapping is actually traditional. Some of the confusion may stem from the fact that arranged marriages were traditional, and one of the ways to escape an arranged marriage was to arrange a consensual &quot;kidnapping&quot;.

===Flag===
The 40-rayed yellow sun in the center of the national flag represent the 40 tribes that once made up the entirety of Kyrgyz culture before the intervention of Russia during the rise of the Soviet Union. The lines inside the sun represent the crown or tündük (Kyrgyz түндүк) of a yurt, a symbol replicated in many facets of Kyrgyz architecture. The red portion of the flag represents peace and openness of Kyrgyzstan.

Under Soviet rule and before 1992, it had the flag of the Soviet Union with two big blue stripes and a white thin stripe in the middle.

===Public holidays===

In addition to celebrating the New Year each 1 January, the Kyrgyz observe the traditional New Year festival Nowruz on the vernal equinox. This spring holiday is celebrated with feasts and festivities such as the horse game Ulak Tartish.

This is the list of public holidays in Kyrgyzstan:
* 1 January – New Year&#x27;s Day
* 7 January – Orthodox Christmas
* 23 February – Fatherland Defender&#x27;s Day
* 8 March – Women&#x27;s Day
* 21–23 March – Nooruz Mairamy, Persian New Year (spring festival)
* 7 April – Day of National Revolution 
* 1 May – Labor Day
* 5 May – Constitution Day
* 8 May – Remembrance Day
* 9 May – Victory Day
* 31 August – Independence Day
* 7–8 November – Days of History and Commemoration of Ancestors

Two additional Muslim holidays &quot;Orozo Ayt&quot; and &quot;Qurman (or Qurban) Ayt&quot; are defined by the lunar calendar.

===Sports===
In the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Kyrgyzstan received its first ever Olympic medal when Aidyn Smagulov won bronze in the men&#x27;s 60 kg competition final in judo.

Football is one of the most popular sports in Kyrgyzstan. The official governing body is the Football Federation of Kyrgyz Republic, which was founded in 1992, after the split of the Soviet Union. It administers the Kyrgyzstan national football team.

Wrestling is also very popular. Since the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, Kyrgyzstani wrestlers have won six medals in Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling: three in 2008 and three in 2020.

Ice hockey was not as popular in Kyrgyzstan until the first Ice Hockey Championship was organized in 2009. In 2011, the Kyrgyzstan men&#x27;s national ice hockey team won 2011 Asian Winter Games Premier Division dominating in all six games with six wins. It was the first major international event that Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s ice hockey team took part in. The Kyrgyzstan men&#x27;s ice hockey team joined the IIHF in July 2011.

Bandy is becoming increasingly popular in the country. The Kyrgyz national team took Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s first medal at the Asian Winter Games, when they captured the bronze. They played in the Bandy World Championship 2012, their first appearance in that tournament.

Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s national basketball team had its best performance at the official 1995 Asian Basketball Championship where the team finished ahead of favorites such as Iran, Philippines and Jordan.

XXI International Issyk-Kul Sports Games (SCO + CIS) was held in 9–17 September 2022 in Baktuu-Dolonotu village (Issyk-Kul). The first three World Nomad Games were held in Cholpon-Ata, Kyrgyzstan. The 6th International Sports Festival Pearl of Kyrgyzstan were held in Issyk-Kul region from 15 June to 3 July 2022.

===Horse riding===

The traditional national sports reflect the importance of horse riding in Kyrgyz culture.

Very popular, as in all of Central Asia, is &quot;Ulak Tartysh&quot;, a team game resembling a cross between polo and rugby in which two teams of riders wrestle for possession of the headless carcass of a goat, which they attempt to deliver across the opposition&#x27;s goal line, or into the opposition&#x27;s goal: a big tub or a circle marked on the ground.

Other popular games on horseback include:
* &quot;At Chabysh&quot; – a long-distance horse race, sometimes over a distance of more than 50 km
* &quot;Jumby Atmai&quot; – a large bar of precious metal (the &quot;jumby&quot;) is tied to a pole by a thread and contestants attempt to break the thread by shooting at it, while at a gallop
* &quot;Kyz Kuumai&quot; – a man chases a girl in order to win a kiss from her, while she gallops away; if he is not successful she may in turn chase him and attempt to beat him with her &quot;kamchi&quot; (horsewhip)
* &quot;Oodarysh&quot; – two contestants wrestle on horseback, each attempting to be the first to throw the other from his horse
* &quot;Tyin Emmei&quot; – picking up a coin from the ground at full gallop

==Education==

The school system in Kyrgyzstan also includes primary (grades 1 to 4, some schools have optional 0 grade), secondary (grades 5 to 9) and high (grades 10 to 11) divisions within one school. Children are usually accepted to primary schools at the age of 6 or 7. It is required that every child finishes 9 grades of school and receives a certificate of completion. Grades 10–11 are optional, but it is necessary to complete them to graduate and receive a state-accredited school diploma. To graduate, a student must complete the 11-year school course and pass 4 mandatory state exams in writing, maths, history, and a foreign language.

As of 2023, there were 4.989 primary and secundary schools in the country, including 445 in Bishkek; the large majority of these (4.537) were public schools. The country also counted 58 higher educational institutions and universities, out of which 42 were public and 16 private.

In September 2016, the University of Central Asia was launched in Naryn, Kyrgyzstan.

There are also various Russian-language medium schools in Bishkek, Osh and other areas. Because of the better funding that they receive in comparation with Kyrgyz state schools, many Kyrgyz go there. In March 2021 Russia announced its plans to create approximately 30 new Russian-language schools in Kyrgyzstan. Teachers from Russia are also working here. However, the existence of these schools has been criticised, for reasons such as the fact that Russian language education has flaws compared to the Turkish and American schools in the country, but also because many ethnic Kyrgyz born after Kyrgyz independence in 1991 can&#x27;t speak Kyrgyz, but only Russian, according to a Bishkek resident.

===Libraries===
Kyrgyzstan is home to 1,066 libraries. The National Library of the Kyrgyz Republic is the oldest library in the country, which was established in 1934. Kyrgyz Libraries are working towards expanding access to communities, evident in projects such as the signing of the Marrakesh VIP Treaty and the Open access Portal.

==Transport==

Transport in Kyrgyzstan is severely constrained by the country&#x27;s alpine topography. Roads have to snake up steep valleys, cross passes of altitude and more, and are subject to frequent mudslides and snow avalanches. Winter travel is close to impossible in many of the more remote and high-altitude regions.

Additional problems come from the fact that many roads and railway lines built during the Soviet period are today intersected by international boundaries, requiring time-consuming border formalities to cross where they are not completely closed. Horses are still a much-used transport option, especially in more rural areas; Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s road infrastructure is not extensive, so horses are able to reach locations that motor vehicles cannot, and they do not require expensive, imported fuel.

===Airports===

At the end of the Soviet period there were about 50 airports and airstrips in Kyrgyzstan, many of them built primarily to serve military purposes in this border region so close to China. Only a few of them remain in service today. The Kyrgyzstan Air Company provides air transport to China, Russia, and other local countries.
* Manas International Airport near Bishkek is the main international airport, with services to Moscow, Tashkent, Almaty, Ürümqi, Istanbul, Baku, and Dubai.
* Osh Airport is the main air terminal in the south of the country, with daily connections to Bishkek, and services to Moscow, Krasnoyarsk, Almaty and more international places.
* Jalal-Abad Airport is linked to Bishkek by daily flights. The national flag carrier, Kyrgyzstan, operates flights on BAe-146 aircraft. During the summer months, a weekly flight links Jalal-Abad with the Issyk-Kul Region.
* Other facilities built during the Soviet era are either closed down, used only occasionally or restricted to military use (e.g., Kant Air Base near Bishkek, which is used by the Russian Air Force).

===Banned airline status===
Kyrgyzstan appears on the European Union&#x27;s list of prohibited countries for the certification of airlines. This means that no airline that is registered in Kyrgyzstan may operate services of any kind within the European Union, due to safety standards that fail to meet European regulations.

===Railways===

The Chüy Valley in the north and the Fergana valley in the south were endpoints of the Soviet Union&#x27;s rail system in Central Asia. Following the emergence of independent post-Soviet states, the rail lines which were built without regard for administrative boundaries have been cut by borders, and traffic is therefore severely curtailed. The small bits of rail lines within Kyrgyzstan, about ( broad gauge) in total, have little economic value in the absence of the former bulk traffic over long distances to and from such centres as Tashkent, Almaty, and the cities of Russia.

In 2022, construction began on a new 186 km extension of the existing railway from Balykchy to Karakeche, primarily meant to carry coal from mines at Karakeche to Bishkek. In June 2023, a railway between Balykchy and Bishkek was officially opened.

The planned construction of a 523 km (CKU) was announced in 2022, comprising in China, in Kyrgyzstan and in Uzbekistan. The railway, conceived as part of China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative, is planned to lead from Kashgar through the Torugart Pass to Jalal-Abad, and further on to the Uzbek city of Andijan. Construction is set to begin in July 2025.

====Rail connections with adjacent countries====

===Highways===
With support from the Asian Development Bank, a major road linking the north and southwest of the country from the capital city of Bishkek to Osh has recently been completed. This considerably eases communication between the two major population centres of the country—the Chüy Valley in the north and the Fergana Valley in the South. An offshoot of this road branches off across a 3,500 meter pass into the Talas Valley in the northwest. Plans are now being formulated to build a major road from Osh into China.
* &quot;total:&quot; (including of expressways)
* &quot;paved:&quot; (includes some all-weather gravel-surfaced roads)
* &quot;unpaved:&quot; (these roads are made of unstabilized earth and are difficult to negotiate in wet weather) (1990)

===Ports and harbours===
* Balykchy (Ysyk-Kol or Rybach&#x27;ye) on Issyk Kul Lake.

<text>Mollie Greenhalgh Hardwick (7 March 1916 in Prestwich, Lancashire – 13 December 2003), also known as Mary Atkinson, was an English author who was best known for writing books that accompanied the TV series &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;.

Hardwick began her career as a radio announcer at the BBC in the 1940s, and following the Second World War worked in the corporation&#x27;s drama department until 1962. As well as writing &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, &quot;Thomas &amp; Sarah&quot; and &quot;The Duchess of Duke Street&quot;, she was also the creator of the &quot;Doran Fairweather&quot; novels and wrote three &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot; books. Hardwick also wrote many books and plays based on the Sherlock Holmes stories, and a couple of biographies of Lady Emma Hamilton and Mary Anne Disraeli.

She married fellow author Michael Hardwick in 1961 and together they co-wrote numerous books, mostly relating to Sherlock Holmes but also a number on Charles Dickens. The couple lived in a medieval house in a village in Kent. She died after a fire broke out at her flat in Muswell Hill, London in 2003.

<doc id="170139" wikidata="Q3518045" url="?curid=170139" title="Old Enough (film)">
<text>Old Enough is a 1984 American comedy-drama coming-of-age film written and directed by Marisa Silver, and produced by Dina Silver. The film follows the friendship that develops over one summer between two girls from different social backgrounds.

A low-budget production, &quot;Old Enough&quot; screened at the 1984 Sundance Film Festival where it won first prize. It also marks Alyssa Milano&#x27;s film debut.

==Plot==
Eleven-year-old Lonnie and fourteen-year-old Karen live on the same street in New York’s Lower East Side, but they come from different worlds. Lonnie lives with her well-off family in an upscale townhouse with her parents and little sister Diane. Karen comes from a working-class, devoutly Catholic family that includes her father, the superintendent of their apartment building, her mother, and older brother Johnny. The two girls strike up a friendship one summer day after Lonnie sees Karen and Johnny hanging out with other neighborhood kids. The impressionable Lonnie is drawn to Karen’s older age and street-smarts, and she starts skipping out on day camp to hang out with her.

Their friendship encounters difficulties when Karen tries to blend in with Lonnie’s social environment. Lonnie invites Karen to an annual summer dance she goes to, where Karen does not fit in with the other kids. Karen steals some money from one of Lonnie’s friends, which causes a brief disagreement between the two. Their friendship is also tested when Carla, a new tenant, moves into Karen&#x27;s building. Misunderstandings occur when Karen suspects her father of having an affair with Carla, but Lonnie knows the truth.

==Cast==
==Critical reception== 
The film received critical acclaim. In a review in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Gerald Peary wrote &quot;Nothing greatly consequential happens in the movie, but its strength lies in Silver’s keen observation of the girls’ telling moments in preteenage life, of how time passes when no adults are about...Silver’s first feature is vastly entertaining and an impressive debut.&quot; In another contemporary review, &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Janet Maslin wrote director Marisa Silver &quot;has a better feeling for film making and for adolescent friendships than she does for the class differences on which the story trades.&quot;

A retrospective review from &quot;Film Inquiry&quot; said, &quot;Above all, &quot;Old Enough&quot; is an affectionately accurate depiction of how it feels to grow into an age when the approval of your peers becomes more important than the approval of your parents. You start to choose your own friends based not just on shared interest or parent-planned playdates, but on the kind of image you imagine emulating, and who you’d most like to see reflected in yourself.&quot; In an article for &quot;Filmotomy&quot;, writer Sarah Williams wrote, &quot;&quot;Old Enough&quot; is incredibly simple, yet it works in its ease because of how real it is. The opening Hallmark charm gives way to an honesty of how young girls look up to each other for an example, creating these close bonds for short spans of time, fitting for just that moment in life.&quot;

==Accolades==
The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1984 Sundance Film Festival.

== Home media ==
The film was released on DVD in 2010 through Scorpion Records and also as a double feature with &quot;Funland&quot; in 2019. It received a restoration from Shout! Factory and was featured as part of The Criterion Channel&#x27;s series &quot;New York Stories&quot; in September 2021.

<text>A natural experiment is a study in which individuals (or clusters of individuals) are exposed to the experimental and control conditions that are determined by nature or by other factors outside the control of the investigators. The process governing the exposures arguably resembles random assignment. Thus, natural experiments are &quot;observational studies&quot; and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment (an &quot;intervention study&quot;). Natural experiments are most useful when there has been a clearly defined exposure involving a well defined subpopulation (and the absence of exposure in a similar subpopulation) such that changes in outcomes may be plausibly attributed to the exposure. In this sense, the difference between a natural experiment and a non-experimental observational study is that the former includes a comparison of conditions that pave the way for causal inference, but the latter does not.

Natural experiments are employed as study designs when controlled experimentation is extremely difficult to implement or unethical, such as in several research areas addressed by epidemiology (like evaluating the health impact of varying degrees of exposure to ionizing radiation in people living near Hiroshima at the time of the atomic blast) and economics (like estimating the economic return on amount of schooling in US adults).

==History==

One of the best-known early natural experiments was the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak in London, England. On 31 August 1854, a major outbreak of cholera struck Soho. Over the next three days, 127 people near Broad Street died. By the end of the outbreak 616 people died. The physician John Snow identified the source of the outbreak as the nearest public water pump, using a map of deaths and illness that revealed a cluster of cases around the pump.

In this example, Snow discovered a strong association between the use of the water from the pump, and deaths and illnesses due to cholera. Snow found that the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company, which supplied water to districts with high attack rates, obtained the water from the Thames downstream from where raw sewage was discharged into the river. By contrast, districts that were supplied water by the Lambeth Waterworks Company, which obtained water upstream from the points of sewage discharge, had low attack rates. Given the near-haphazard patchwork development of the water supply in mid-nineteenth century London, Snow viewed the developments as &quot;an experiment...on the grandest scale.&quot; Of course, the exposure to the polluted water was not under the control of any scientist. Therefore, this exposure has been recognized as being a natural experiment.

==Recent examples==

===Family size===
An aim of a study Angrist and Evans (1998) was to estimate the effect of family size on the labor market outcomes of the mother. For at least two reasons, the correlations between family size and various outcomes (e.g., earnings) do not inform us about how family size causally affects labor market outcomes. First, both labor market outcomes and family size may be affected by unobserved &quot;third&quot; variables (e.g., personal preferences). Second, labor market outcomes themselves may affect family size (called &quot;reverse causality&quot;). For example, a woman may defer having a child if she gets a raise at work. The authors observed that two-child families with either two boys or two girls are substantially more likely to have a third child than two-child families with one boy and one girl. The sex of the first two children, then, constitutes a kind of natural experiment: it is as if an experimenter had randomly assigned some families to have two children and others to have three. The authors were then able to credibly estimate the causal effect of having a third child on labor market outcomes. Angrist and Evans found that childbearing had a greater impact on poor and less educated women than on highly educated women although the earnings impact of having a third child tended to disappear by that child&#x27;s 13th birthday. They also found that having a third child had little impact on husbands&#x27; earnings.

===Game shows===
Within economics, game shows are a frequently studied form of natural experiment. While game shows might seem to be artificial contexts, they can be considered natural experiments due to the fact that the context arises without interference of the scientist. Game shows have been used to study a wide range of different types of economic behavior, such as decision making under risk and cooperative behavior.

In Helena, Montana a smoking ban was in effect in all public spaces, including bars and restaurants, during the six-month period from June 2002 to December 2002. Helena is geographically isolated and served by only one hospital. The investigators observed that the rate of heart attacks dropped by 40% while the smoking ban was in effect. Opponents of the law prevailed in getting the enforcement of the law suspended after six months, after which the rate of heart attacks went back up. This study was an example of a natural experiment, called a case-crossover experiment, where the exposure is removed for a time and then returned. The study also noted its own weaknesses which potentially suggest that the inability to control variables in natural experiments can impede investigators from drawing firm conclusions.&#x27;

===Nuclear weapons testing===

Nuclear weapons testing released large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere, some of which could be incorporated into biological tissues. The release stopped after the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which prohibited atmospheric nuclear tests. This resembled a large-scale pulse-chase experiment, but could not have been performed as a regular experiment in humans due to scientific ethics. Several types of observations were made possible (in people born before 1963), such as determination of the rate of replacement for cells in different human tissues.

===Vietnam War draft===

An important question in economics research is what determines earnings. Angrist (1990) evaluated the effects of military service on lifetime earnings. Using statistical methods developed in econometrics, Angrist capitalized on the approximate random assignment of the Vietnam War draft lottery, and used it as an instrumental variable associated with eligibility (or non-eligibility) for military service. Because many factors might predict whether someone serves in the military, the draft lottery frames a natural experiment whereby those drafted into the military can be compared against those not drafted because the two groups should not differ substantially prior to military service. Angrist found that the earnings of veterans were, on average, about 15 percent less than the earnings of non-veterans.

===Industrial melanism===

With the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, many species of moth, including the well-studied peppered moth, responded to the atmospheric pollution of sulphur dioxide and soot around cities with industrial melanism, a dramatic increase in the frequency of dark forms over the formerly abundant pale, speckled forms. In the twentieth century, as regulation improved and pollution fell, providing the conditions for a large-scale natural experiment, the trend towards industrial melanism was reversed, and melanic forms quickly became scarce. The effect led the evolutionary biologists L. M. Cook and J. R. G. Turner to conclude that &quot;natural selection is the only credible explanation for the overall decline&quot;.

==Early life==
Lisa Valerie Kudrow was born in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles on July 30, 1963, the daughter of Nedra, a travel agent, and Lee Kudrow, a doctor who specialized in treating headaches. She has an older sister, Helene, and two brothers, David and Derrick. She was raised in a middle-class Jewish family and had a Bat Mitzvah. She is of Belarusian, German, Hungarian, and Polish Jewish descent. Some of her Belarusian ancestors were from Ilya. Almost all Jews in Ilya were murdered during the Holocaust, including Kudrow&#x27;s paternal great-grandmother. Her paternal grandmother left Belarus for Brooklyn, where her father grew up.

Kudrow attended Portola Middle School in the Tarzana neighborhood of Los Angeles. She graduated from Taft High School in the Woodland Hills neighborhood, which was attended at the same time by rapper Eazy-E and actress Robin Wright. She received her A.B. in biology from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, intending to become an expert on headaches like her father. While breaking into acting, she worked for her father for eight years and earned a research credit on his study on the comparative likelihood of left-handed individuals developing cluster headaches.

==Career==

===1989–1994: Pre-&quot;Friends&quot;===
At the urging of comedian Jon Lovitz, who was a childhood friend of her brother, Kudrow began her comedic career as a member of The Groundlings, an improv and sketch comedy school in Los Angeles. She has credited Cynthia Szigeti, her improv teacher at The Groundlings, for changing her perspective on acting, calling her &quot;the best thing that happened, on so many levels&quot;. Briefly, Kudrow joined with Conan O&#x27;Brien and director Tim Hillman in the short-lived improv troupe Unexpected Company. She was also the only regular female member of the Transformers Comedy Troupe. She played a role in an episode of the NBC sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;. She tried out for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1990, but Julia Sweeney was chosen instead. She had a recurring role as Kathy Fleisher in three episodes of season one of the Bob Newhart sitcom &quot;Bob&quot; (CBS, 1992–1993), a role she played after taking part in the series finale of Newhart&#x27;s previous series &quot;Newhart&quot;. Prior to &quot;Friends&quot;, she appeared in at least two network-produced pilots: NBC&#x27;s &quot;Just Temporary&quot; (also known as &quot;Temporarily Yours&quot;) in 1989, playing Nicole; and CBS&#x27; &quot;Close Encounters&quot; (also known as &quot;Matchmaker&quot;) in 1990, playing a Valley girl.

Kudrow was cast as Roz Doyle in &quot;Frasier&quot;, but the role was re-cast with Peri Gilpin during the taping of the pilot episode. In 2000, Kudrow explained that when rehearsals started, &quot;I knew it wasn&#x27;t working. I could feel it all slipping away, and I was panicking, which only made things worse.&quot; Her first recurring television role was Ursula Buffay, the eccentric waitress on the NBC sitcom &quot;Mad About You&quot;.

===1994–2004: &quot;Friends&quot; and worldwide recognition===
Kudrow, the oldest actor of the main cast, reprised the character of Ursula on the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, in which she co-starred as massage therapist Phoebe Buffay, Ursula&#x27;s twin sister. Praised for her performance, Kudrow was the first &quot;Friends&quot; cast member to win an Emmy Award with her 1998 honor as Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her starring role as Phoebe on &quot;Friends&quot; (NBC, 1994–2004). Kudrow received critical acclaim for playing Phoebe. According to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; (2005), Kudrow and co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox became the highest paid TV actresses of all time, earning $1 million per episode for the ninth and tenth seasons of &quot;Friends&quot;. Phoebe has since been named one of the greatest television characters of all time. Phoebe is considered to be Kudrow&#x27;s breakout role, credited with making her the show&#x27;s second-most famous cast member, after Jennifer Aniston, and for spawning her successful film career. She played Phoebe until the show ended in 2004. The program was a massive hit and Kudrow, along with her co-stars, gained worldwide recognition. Her character, Phoebe, was especially popular. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted Phoebe on &quot;Friends&quot; as Kudrow&#x27;s best performance.

During her tenure on &quot;Friends&quot;, Kudrow appeared in several comedy films such as &quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot;, &quot;Hanging Up&quot;, &quot;Marci X&quot;, &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;, &quot;Analyze This&quot; and its sequel &quot;Analyze That&quot;, and dramatic films, such as &quot;Wonderland&quot; and &quot;The Opposite of Sex&quot;. She also guest-starred on numerous television series during &quot;Friends&quot;, including &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Hope and Gloria&quot; and &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, and hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

===2004–present: Post-&quot;Friends&quot;===
Following &quot;Friends&quot;, Kudrow starred as protagonist Valerie Cherish on the single-season HBO series &quot;The Comeback&quot; (premiered June 5, 2005), about a has-been sitcom star trying for a comeback. She also served as co-creator, writer, and executive producer. Nine years after the original season, HBO revived the series in 2014 for an abbreviated second season. Kudrow received two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on &quot;The Comeback&quot;. Her production company is &#x27;Is or Isn&#x27;t Entertainment&#x27;. Kudrow serves as the executive producer for the U.S. version of the British television series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, in which celebrities trace their family trees. The subjects of the first series included Kudrow herself, in which it was discovered her great-grandmother was murdered in the Holocaust.

Kudrow co-created an improvised comedy webseries, &quot;Web Therapy&quot; on Lstudio.com. The improv series, which launched online in 2008, has earned several Webby nominations and one Outstanding Comedic Performance Webby for Kudrow, who plays therapist Fiona Wallice. She offers her patients three-minute sessions over iChat. In July 2011, a reformatted, half-hour version of the show premiered on Showtime, before being cancelled in 2015 after four seasons. Kudrow has guest starred on multiple television series such as &quot;Cougar Town&quot;, &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, &quot;Angie Tribeca&quot;, &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot;, and &quot;Scandal&quot;.

Kudrow has appeared in multiple comedic films such as &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, &quot;Hotel for Dogs&quot;, &quot;Easy A&quot;, &quot;Neighbors&quot; and its sequel &quot;Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising&quot;, &quot;Long Shot&quot;, and &quot;Booksmart&quot;. She also appeared in the romantic drama film &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; and co-starred in the thriller film &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot;. In 2020, Kudrow played Hypatia of Alexandria in season 4 episode 12 of &quot;The Good Place&quot; &quot;Patty&quot;, and starred as Maggie Naird in the Netflix comedy series, &quot;Space Force&quot;. She reunited with her &quot;Friends&quot; cast mates for an HBO Max unscripted television special titled &quot;&quot; in May 2021. She is currently, along with Mary McCormack, an executive producer of the syndicated game show, &quot;25 Words or Less&quot;; sometimes, Kudrow herself is one of the two celebrity guests playing with a contestant on the show.

In December 2024, Kudrow starred as Lydia in the Netflix comedy-drama &quot;No Good Deed&quot;, a role for which she gained positive reviews from critics.

<text>David Lawrence Schwimmer (born November 2, 1966) is an American actor, director, comedian, and producer. He gained worldwide recognition for portraying Ross Geller in the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, for which he received a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1995. While still acting in &quot;Friends&quot;, his first leading film role was in &quot;The Pallbearer&quot; (1996), followed by roles in &quot;Kissing a Fool;&quot; &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights;&quot; &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; (all 1998); and &quot;Picking Up the Pieces&quot; (2000). He was then cast in the miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (2001) as Herbert Sobel.

Schwimmer began his acting career performing in school plays at Beverly Hills High School. In 1988, he graduated from Northwestern University with a Bachelor of Arts in theater and speech. After graduation, Schwimmer co-founded the Lookingglass Theatre Company. For much of the late 1980s, he lived in Los Angeles as a struggling, unemployed actor, until he starred in the television movie &quot;A Deadly Silence&quot; in 1989 and appeared in a number of television roles in the early 1990s, including &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, and &quot;Monty&quot;.

After the series finale of &quot;Friends&quot; in 2004, Schwimmer branched out into film and stage work. He was cast as the title character in the 2005 drama film &quot;Duane Hopwood&quot;, and voiced Melman the Giraffe in the animated &quot;Madagascar&quot; film franchise, acted in the dark comedy &quot;Big Nothing&quot; (2006), and the thriller &quot;Nothing but the Truth&quot; (2008). Schwimmer made his West End stage debut in the leading role in 2005&#x27;s &quot;Some Girl(s)&quot;. He made his Broadway debut in &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot; in 2006. His feature film directorial debut followed in 2007 with the comedy &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot;, and the following year he made his Off-Broadway directorial debut in &quot;Fault Lines&quot;.

He has also worked as a director, including many episodes of &quot;Friends&quot; during his time on the series. In 2016, Schwimmer starred as lawyer Robert Kardashian in &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson&quot;, for which he received his second Primetime Emmy Award nomination, this time for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.

==Early life==
Schwimmer was born in 1966 in Flushing, Queens, New York City, to attorneys Arthur (1941–2024) and Arlene Coleman-Schwimmer (born 1940). His family is Jewish. He has an older sister named Ellie Schwimmer (born 1965). His family subsequently moved to Los Angeles, where Schwimmer, at 10, had his first acting experience when he was cast as the fairy godmother in a Jewish version of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In 1979, Schwimmer went to a Shakespeare workshop given by English actor Sir Ian McKellen in Los Angeles. He recalls being riveted by the experience. Schwimmer then entered a contest in the Southern California Shakespeare Festival three years in a row, winning two first prizes.

Following his mother&#x27;s successful career as a divorce lawyer, the family moved to Beverly Hills, where Schwimmer attended Beverly Hills High School. His classmates included actor Jonathan Silverman. Schwimmer admitted to feeling like an outsider during his time at the school, recalling, &quot;When I was there I always felt: &#x27;This is not me, I&#x27;m surrounded by people with a different value system. And I just wanted to get out of California.&#x27;&quot; His best subjects were science and math and he originally wanted to become a doctor. Schwimmer enrolled in a drama class, where he appeared in stage productions. Encouraged by his school drama teacher to further his acting, he flew to Chicago for a summer acting program at Northwestern University. He noted that the experience was both &quot;enlightening and exhilarating&quot;. In 1984, Schwimmer graduated from Beverly Hills High and wanted to go straight into acting, but his parents insisted he go to college first so he would have something to fall back on. Schwimmer enrolled in Northwestern University, where he had attended the summer acting program earlier. He had originally intended on becoming a surgeon, having studied various body systems but eventually decided to pursue acting professionally. At the university, he studied theater and was in an improv group with Stephen Colbert, the No-Fun Mud Piranhas. After graduating in 1988, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater and speech, Schwimmer co-founded the Lookingglass Theatre Company. Subsequently, he returned to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.

==Career==

===1989–1994: Early work===
After his supporting role debut in the ABC television movie &quot;A Deadly Silence&quot; (1989), Schwimmer followed this with roles on the legal drama &quot;L.A. Law&quot; in 1992, and the comedy-drama series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;. He made his feature film debut in &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot; (1991), had a recurring role as a lawyer-turned-vigilante in &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; before auditioning, unsuccessfully, for a series pilot called &quot;Couples&quot;. He landed his first regular series role as the liberal son of a conservative talk show host (Henry Winkler) in the sitcom &quot;Monty&quot;.

===1994–2004: Breakthrough===

In 1994, Schwimmer was cast as Ross Geller in NBC&#x27;s situation comedy &quot;Friends&quot;, a series that revolved around a group of friends who live near each other in Manhattan. He played a hopeless-romantic paleontologist who works at a museum and later becomes a professor at a university. Schwimmer initially turned down the role as Ross, but accepted later. Executive producer Kevin S. Bright said that he had previously worked with Schwimmer, the character of Ross was written with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast. The show debuted on September 22, 1994, and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers. &quot;Friends&quot; quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and Schwimmer receiving strong reviews. Much of the &quot;Friends&quot; success is attributed to the plotline between his character Ross and his on-again-off-again love interest Rachel, which has been described as one of the greatest TV couples of all time by various media outlets. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him &quot;terrific&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s television reviewer said: &quot;All six of the principals, especially (Courteney) Cox and Schwimmer, appear resourceful and display sharp sitcom skills&quot;. For this performance, he earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1995.

Schwimmer starred in his first leading film role in the 1996 romantic comedy film, &quot;The Pallbearer&quot; with Gwyneth Paltrow. In the film, Schwimmer plays a man asked to deliver the eulogy for a high school friend he cannot remember, and begins an affair with the friend&#x27;s mother. Critics dismissed &quot;The Pallbearer&quot; as a poor imitation of the 1967 film &quot;The Graduate&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s film reviewer complimented the actor, writing that he had enjoyed his performance, stating that he displayed &quot;a winning, if rather deadpan, personality along with good comic timing&quot;. It also concluded that Schwimmer had a &quot;promising bigscreen future&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited that his first film &quot;relegates him to a drab role&quot;. When asked why he decided to accept the role, Schwimmer admitted the decision was to &quot;make an effort to find roles that are as far away from the character of Ross as possible.&quot; Schwimmer was chosen to play a leading role in the 1997 &quot;Men in Black&quot; but he turned it down. He later regretted this decision. Ultimately, Will Smith got the role.

His next film roles, in 1998, were &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot;, &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot;, and &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;. In &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot;, a romantic comedy, Schwimmer played Max, a smart-mouthed, but dapper and charming man. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;Fans of the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; may be surprised by David Schwimmer in &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot;. [...] Take it from someone who has never seen &quot;Friends&quot; and comes at Schwimmer with no preconceptions: He does just fine. As a TV sports reporter in &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot;, he oozes the command and self-satisfaction of a young, successful man.&quot; The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. In &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot;, he played the boyfriend of Anne Heche&#x27;s character. In &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;, adapted from a novella of the same name by Stephen King, he had a supporting role as a school guidance counselor. &quot;I was scared of the part&quot;, Schwimmer said, &quot;but I wanted to be part of the movie&quot;. At the time, he noted it was a &quot;little frustrating&quot; that people would typecast him due to his role on &quot;Friends&quot;. He subsequently appeared opposite Woody Allen and Sharon Stone in Alfonso Arau&#x27;s straight-to-cable comedy &quot;Picking Up the Pieces&quot; (2000).

In 2001, Schwimmer played Captain Herbert M. Sobel in Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks&#x27; HBO World War II miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. The television miniseries is based on the book of the same title written by historian and biographer Stephen Ambrose. Although &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; was met with largely positive reception, Schwimmer&#x27;s performance was criticized; the BBC News concluded, &quot;Part of the problem ... may have been the ridiculous fact that &quot;Friends&quot; favourite David Schwimmer plays the hard and cruel Captain Herbert Sobel. The only thing believable about Schwimmer&#x27;s acting is when he cowers in the face of true battle. His puppy dog eyes make him appear even more pitiful.&quot; Later that year he portrayed Yitzhak Zuckerman in the war drama &quot;Uprising&quot;, based on the true events of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.

In March 2004, Schwimmer appeared as himself on HBO&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. During the lengthy run of &quot;Friends&quot;, Schwimmer directed ten of the show&#x27;s episodes. The show&#x27;s tenth and final season ended on May 6, 2004.

===2004–2010: Directing===

In 2004, Schwimmer was director and executive producer on &quot;Nevermind Nirvana&quot;, a sitcom about an Indian American family that was not picked up by NBC. After &quot;Friends&quot;, Schwimmer starred in the 2005 independent drama &quot;Duane Hopwood&quot;, as the title character, who is an alcoholic whose life is spiraling downward rapidly after a divorce and is looking to turn his life around. The film received ambivalent reviews. Despite the reception, Schwimmer&#x27;s performance was favored by critics; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; reported that the role was Schwimmer&#x27;s &quot;career-transforming performance&quot;. &quot;Duane Hopwood&quot; was screened at a special presentation at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. Furthermore, in the same year he voiced Melman, a hypochondriac giraffe, in the animated film &quot;Madagascar&quot; (2005). &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that Schwimmer is particularly appealing as Melman. Despite the mixed response from critics, the film was a commercial success, earning US$532 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.

Schwimmer starred on the London stage in May 2005, with Catherine Tate, Lesley Manville, Sara Powell, and Saffron Burrows, in Neil LaBute&#x27;s &quot;Some Girl(s)&quot; at the Gielgud Theatre. In the production, he plays a teacher who is ready to settle down and marry, but decides to visit four ex-girlfriends first. For his performance, Schwimmer received critical reviews. &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote that Schwimmer &quot;is not called upon to extend his range nearly as far as one might have expected in &quot;Some Girl(s).&quot; [...] Schwimmer remains bland, competent, and boyish—though not fatally boyish in the manner that appears to have turned these women on.&quot; However, Charles Spencer of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; praised Schwimmer, reporting he &quot;proves inspired casting. He takes to the stage with ... his endearing gaucheness seems designed to ensure our continued sympathy. Schwimmer mercilessly lays bare his character&#x27;s opportunism, casual cruelties, and chronic self-deception.&quot;

In 2006, he made his Broadway debut in Herman Wouk&#x27;s two-act play &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;. Schwimmer played the role of Lieutenant Barney Greenwald in the production, which was directed by Jerry Zaks. In an interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine, he revealed that he had wanted to try Broadway, however said &quot;a couple of things came up that just never quite felt right. Either because I liked the play but wasn&#x27;t hot on the director, or there was another star attached that I wasn&#x27;t jazzed about working with.&quot; He further added that when showed a copy of Wouk&#x27;s novel &quot;...I was shocked at how good the writing was.&quot; His next film role was in the 2006 black comedy &quot;Big Nothing&quot;, in which he played a bitter, unemployed scientist.

Schwimmer made his directorial feature debut in the 2007 British comedy film &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot;. The film stars Simon Pegg as an out of shape man who signs up for a marathon to convince his former fiancée and five-year-old son that he has turned his life around. When asked why he decided to direct the film, Schwimmer said: &quot;As a director, I was struck by the challenge that I thought the script presented, which was that it was kind of three films in one. You had some great, big physical comedy, and I thought funny dialogue and characters. And then there was some real emotion to it with the relationship between the father and the son and the romance aspect.&quot; &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot; garnered mixed reception, with the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; rating it one-and-a-half out of five stars and writing, &quot;Most disappointing is how Schwimmer—who spent 10 seasons on a sitcom filled with hyperverbal characters—manages to bumble &#x27;Fatboy&#x27;s&#x27; tender moments.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot;, however, was favorable towards Schwimmer, reporting he possesses filmmaking finesse &quot;having wisely chosen strong comic material for his debut behind the camera&quot;. For his directorial work, he was nominated for a British Independent Film Award in the category of Best Debut Director.

On November 8, 2007, Schwimmer made a guest appearance in the second season of the television series &quot;30 Rock&quot;, where he played Greenzo, an NBC environmental mascot. The following year, he was part of an ensemble cast that included Kate Beckinsale, Matt Dillon, Alan Alda, Angela Bassett, and Noah Wyle in the thriller &quot;Nothing But the Truth&quot; (2008). The movie received generally favorable reviews. The success of &quot;Madagascar&quot; led Schwimmer to return to the role of Melman in the 2008 sequel, &quot;&quot;. The film earned US$603 million at the international box office. Schwimmer took part in directing in-studio segments for &quot;Little Britain USA&quot;, an American spin-off of the British BBC television series &quot;Little Britain&quot;. In regard to this, he commented that he had &quot;a good time directing episodes&quot; for the show.

In October 2008, Schwimmer made his Off-Broadway directorial debut in &quot;Fault Lines&quot; at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York. The production won a mixed review from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, which wrote: &quot;Based on &quot;Fault Lines&quot; ... we can&#x27;t really tell whether Schwimmer has much talent as a director. We&#x27;re surprised he didn&#x27;t try something more challenging for his debut. If not much else, Schwimmer has encouraged his actors to intense their energy levels and comic timing at all costs&quot;. The &quot;New York Post&quot;, however, noted that Schwimmer &quot;knows a thing or two about freewheeling banter ... and for a good while the play crackles with terrific dialogue, expertly delivered&quot;. In February 2009, he returned to theater in a Chicago production of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s three-act play &quot;Our Town&quot; as George Gibbs at the Lookingglass Theatre. &quot;Schwimmer ... turns in a poignant, richly textured and demonstrably heartfelt performance as George Gibbs. I&#x27;ve seen a fair bit of Schwimmer&#x27;s post-&quot;Friends&quot; stage work in London and New York, and I&#x27;ve never seen him better&quot;, commented the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

On August 2, 2009, Schwimmer played himself in the sixth season of the HBO television series, &quot;Entourage&quot;. In the episode, Ari Gold&#x27;s (Jeremy Piven) agency tries to steer his career back to television. Schwimmer directed his second feature, &quot;Trust&quot;, starring Clive Owen and Catherine Keener. The film, a drama, is about a family whose teenage daughter becomes victim of an online sexual predator. &quot;Trust&quot; premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.

===2010–present: Return to television===
On January 1, 2011, Schwimmer guest-starred on the British comedy series &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot; starring Matt Lucas and David Walliams, whom he directed in &quot;Little Britain USA&quot;. The following year, he returned to voice Melman the Giraffe in &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. In 2013, Schwimmer appeared as Josh Rosenthal, a mobster who was brought up by the notorious Roy DeMeo and part of the Gambino Family, alongside Michael Shannon in &quot;The Iceman&quot;.

In 2014, Schwimmer was cast as the lead in the ABC comedy pilot &quot;Irreversible&quot;, playing &quot;one half of a somewhat eccentric, self-absorbed couple&quot;. In 2016, Schwimmer played Robert Kardashian in the first season of the FX anthology series &quot;American Crime Story&quot;. He received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his performance. In January 2016, Schwimmer and Jim Sturgess were cast to star in the new AMC crime drama &quot;Feed the Beast&quot;. The series premiered on June 5, 2016, and aired 10 episodes through August before being canceled. In November 2016, it was announced that Schwimmer would star in his first audio series. Gimlet Media&#x27;s podcast &quot;Homecoming&quot; began airing on November 16, 2016.

In April 2017, Schwimmer helped adapt the films of Sigal Avin for a US audience. The six short features depict sexual harassment at work by men on women.

In 2020, Schwimmer was cast as a main character in the British sitcom &quot;Intelligence&quot; broadcast on Sky One. In the same year, he was a celebrity reader on CBeebies Bedtime Stories, and was signed as the face of British banking chain TSB.

Schwimmer featured in &quot;Jews Don&#x27;t Count&quot;, a 2022 documentary by British Jewish comedian David Baddiel on the subject of antisemitism. Schwimmer&#x27;s contribution, in which he said that he has never felt white, was described as &quot;erudite&quot; by Rebecca Nicholson of &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

From January 2025 Schwimmer starred in season 2 of the anthology horror series &quot;Goosebumps&quot;, based on the book series of the same name.

==Personal life==
Schwimmer dated singer-songwriter Natalie Imbruglia in the late 1990s. Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston admitted to having crushes on each other early on while filming &quot;Friends&quot; during HBO Max&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Schwimmer began a relationship with British artist Zoë Buckman in 2007 and they married on June 4, 2010. Their child Cleo Buckman Schwimmer was born in 2011. The couple announced in April 2017 that they were &quot;taking some time apart&quot;. They divorced later that year. Schwimmer and his ex-wife are on good terms and continue to co-parent their child amicably. He tends to keep his personal life away from the media to preserve his daughter&#x27;s childhood.

Schwimmer primarily lives in East Village, Manhattan. He previously had a loft in Near West Side, Chicago as well as a house in Hancock Park, Los Angeles.

In June 2006, Schwimmer won a US$400,000 defamation lawsuit against Aaron Tonken, a former charity fundraiser. Tonken claimed Schwimmer had demanded Rolex watches in order to appear at his own charity event, a claim that Schwimmer had denied.

Schwimmer is an active director of the Rape Treatment Center in Santa Monica, which specializes in helping victims of date rape and child rape. He has also campaigned for legislation to ban drugs such as Rohypnol and GHB. In November 2011, he gave the Scottish charity Children 1st permission to screen his film &quot;Trust&quot; to commemorate World Day for Prevention of Child Abuse and Violence against Children.

In October 2023, he was one of many Hollywood signatories of a letter calling on President Joe Biden to work toward the release of all Israeli hostages after the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. In January 2024, he signed an open letter calling on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to include Jews in its representation and inclusion standards.

In 2012, he rebutted two longstanding rumors: one that he appeared as a soldier on a train in &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot; (1988), saying, &quot;No. I don&#x27;t know why that&#x27;s on IMDb, but I never was in that&quot; (the credit has since been removed), and the other that he is related to dancer Lacey Schwimmer, saying, &quot;No, not at all. Please set the record straight. I guess it&#x27;s a natural assumption because we have the same last name, but no. I&#x27;ve never even met her&quot;.

<text>Bertrand-François Mahé, comte de La Bourdonnais (11 February 169910 November 1753) was a French Navy officer and colonial administrator who was employed by the French East India Company.

==Biography==
La Bourdonnais entered the service of the French East India Company as a lieutenant. In 1724, he was promoted to captain, and displayed such bravery in the capture of Mahé on the Malabar Coast that the name of the town was added to his own; although an alternative account suggests that the town adopted his name, rather than the other way around. For two years he was in the service of the Portuguese Viceroy, but in 1735 he returned to French service as governor of the Isle de France (present-day Mauritius) and the Île de Bourbon (present-day Réunion). His first five years&#x27; administration of the islands was vigorous and successful. He significantly increased the enslaved African population in Isle de France (Mauritius) which grew from only 638 in 1735 by around 1,300 annually. Labourdonnais also brought 70 slaves for his own estate.

A visit to France in 1740 was interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities with Great Britain, and La Bourdonnais was put at the head of a fleet in Indian waters.
In 1744 he assembled a squadron of 3,342 men, including 720 slaves, and led a military expedition from Isle de France to Madras in India. His victory increased the rivalry with Governor of Pondicherry, Joseph François Dupleix. Soon Labourdonnais was accused of receiving money from the British East India Company and in 1746 he was forced to return to France to face trial and was jailed at the Bastille for 3 years. He was replaced by Pierre Félix Barthelemy David, the son of a director of the French East India Company. He was tried in 1751 and acquitted, but his health was broken by the imprisonment and by chagrin at the loss of his property. To the last he made accusations against Dupleix.

==Recognition and legacy==
In 1742 his name was given to the main island (Mahé Island) of the Seychelles archipelago by French explorer Lazare Picault. In 1806 the French General Decaen founded and named the historic port village of Mahébourg in homage to Mahé de La Bourdonnais. Close to the village of Mapou, in Rivière du Rempart District, there is an estate named Domaine de Labourdonnais with its manor house known as Le Château de Labourdonnais, built in 1856, and now converted into a museum. A statue of La Bourdonnais was erected at Place D&#x27;Armes in Port Louis on 30 August 1859 during a ceremony. In Curepipe a school called &quot;Lycée La Bourdonnais&quot; was founded in 1953, where the curriculum is modelled on practices in France. There is another statue of La Bourdonnais in the port of Saint-Malo, France. In Saint-Denis, Réunion a statue of La Bourdonnais was also erected, and a suburb is named &quot;Cité Labourdonnais&quot;. However the statue and suburb in Reunion island have been the target of anti-slavery protesters since 2020.

==Family==
In March and April 1738 two of Labourdonnais&#x27; children died and in May 1738 his wife also died on Isle de France (Mauritius). His daughter Montlezun Pardiac continued to live on Isle de France (Mauritius) and received an annual pension of 3,000 Louis following a vote in the National Assembly in August 1798. His grandson was the strong chess player Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais. In December 1827 a lead-lined coffin containing the remains of Labourdonnais&#x27; wife and child was discovered during repairs of a government building near the &quot;Jardin de la Compagnie&quot;.

<doc id="170157" wikidata="Q17182" url="?curid=170157" title="Parañaque">
<text>Parañaque, officially the City of Parañaque (, ), is a highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 689,992 people.

It is bordered to the north by Pasay, to the northeast by Taguig, to the southeast by Muntinlupa, to the southwest by Las Piñas, and to the west by Manila Bay. Like the rest of Metro Manila, Parañaque experiences a tropical climate with only two distinct seasons, wet (July to September) and dry (October to June). The city enjoys an annual rainfall of and an average daily maximum temperature of .

Parañaque is the home of Entertainment City, a gaming and entertainment complex under development by the state-owned Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, spanning an area of in Bay City, where four large integrated resorts are based namely Solaire Resort &amp; Casino, City of Dreams Manila, Okada Manila, and the soon to be completed Westside City Resorts World. It is also the home of the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange public transport terminal and the Aseana City business district development which includes Ayala Malls Manila Bay.

==Etymology==
Several myths exist as to how Parañaque got its name. One story holds that long ago, a &quot;balete&quot; (banyan) tree that looked like a majestic ship stood at the mouth of what is now called the Parañaque River. It earned the Tagalog name &quot;Palanyag&quot;, taken from the term &quot;&quot;palayag&quot;, which means “point of navigation”.

Another folktale says that before the Spaniards arrived, there were natives who lived close to Manila Bay, and their occupation was fishing (&quot;pangingisdâ&quot;). Their neighbours to the east in present-day Muntinlupa were farmers and called &quot;tagá-palayán&quot;&quot; (&quot;of the rice paddies&quot;). One day, the fishermen and rice farmers held a feast, and were drunk from &quot;tubâ&quot; (coconut toddy). One farmer suggested they name the whole place &quot;&quot;Palayán&quot; as a sign of cooperation and goodwill between them. A fisherman protested, saying they should name it &quot;Palalayag&quot; instead. As a compromise, they agreed to merge the two words and came up with &quot;Palalanyag&quot;&quot;. Another drunken guest shouted, “&quot;Mabuhay ang Palanyag at ang mga tagá-Palanyag!”&quot; (&quot;Long live &quot;Palanyag&quot; and those of &quot;Palanyag&quot;!&quot;) The rest liked this word better, and the place was called &quot;&quot;Palanyag&quot;.

A third myth suggests that Spanish soldiers in a horse-drawn carriage asked to be taken to a certain place. When they arrived, one of the soldiers ordered, &quot;¡Para aquí! ¡Para aquí!&quot; (“Stop here! Stop here!”), which the coachman did not understand. The soldier repeated it and later, the coachman left the carriage and told others “These Spaniards are repeatedly saying &quot;para aniya ake...para aniya ake&quot;” to the laughter of the crowd. The story spread, and the term &quot;&quot;Para Aniya Ake&quot; stuck.

===Historical account===
&quot;On the coast near Manila are Laguo (i.e. Lagyo), Malahat, Longalo, Palañac, Vakol, Minacaya, and Cavite. All these villages are in the neighborhood of Cavite, and belong to His Majesty, to whom they pay tribute.&quot;&quot;

– Miguel de Loarca, &quot;Relación de Yslas Filipinas&quot; (1582)Historically speaking, the earliest Spanish records (de Loarca&#x27;s &quot;Relación&quot; etc.) listed the settlement as &quot;&quot;Palañac&quot;, which indicates that by at least the late 16th century, the place&#x27;s name was something akin to &quot;Palanyag&quot;&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
Due to their proximity to the sea, the early Parañaqueños traded with the Chinese, Japanese, Indonesians, Indians, and Malays. Traditional occupations and trades included saltmaking, fishing, planting rice, shoemaking, slipper-making and weaving.

===Spanish and American colonial eras===
Parañaque was officially founded in the year 1580 by Order of Saint Augustine and it was Fray Diego de Espiñar, O.S.A. who became the first minister of the town. The Council of the Definitors (a conference of chiefs of the religious orders) held on May 11, 1580 (Conquistas delas Islas of Fray Gaspar San Agustin, O.S.A.) accepted the village of Palanyag, as Parañaque, as an independent &quot;pueblo&quot;. Other towns in the islands which simultaneously established on the same date according to the 1580 chapter of the Augustinians were Malolos (in Bulacan), Bulacabe (on Panay) and Bantayan (in Cebu). The image of Palanyag&#x27;s patroness, Nuestra Señora del Buen Suceso de Palanyag, was brought to Saint Andrew&#x27;s Parish in La Huerta on August 10, 1625. Nuestra Señora del Buen Suceso de Palanyag is the third oldest Marian Image in the Philippines.

Early Spanish census dated 1591 to 1593 also mentioned Longalo and Parañaque as two villages along Manila Bay composed of some 800 tribute-payers. Politically, Don Galo and Parañaque were then under the Encomienda and Provincia de Tondo. The community was headed by &quot;cabezas de barangay&quot;, a westernized version of &quot;datus&quot; (chieftains), and the &quot;principalía&quot; (Hispanicised local nobility), who together justified and moderated the demands of the Spanish colonizers. Education was limited to the &quot;principalía&quot; as they were the only ones who could afford it.
Historical accounts state that the town&#x27;s strategic location enabled the townspeople to play an important role in Philippine history. Palanyag was located at the crossroads of Manila, between the provinces of Cavite and Batangas. In 1574, during the invasion of the town by the Chinese pirate Limahong, Parañaquenos, particularly those from Don Galo, heroically aided in preventing the attack on Manila. This incident became known as the &quot;Red Sea Incident&quot; due to the blood that flowed through the sacrifice of the people of &quot;barrio&quot; Santa Monica. With the arrival of Spanish forces led by Captain Juan de Salcedo from Ilocos, Limahong was finally repulsed, and the occupation of the town was averted.

When the British invaded Manila in 1762, the townspeople once again remained loyal to the Spanish colonizers, especially the Augustinians. The invasion however showed that the Spaniards was not invincible and that their rule was not to be permanent. More than a hundred years later, this would prove to be true. During the Philippine Revolution of 1896–1898, the Spaniards realized that the town was a practical gateway to Cavite, the bastion of the revolutionary Katipuneros. Conversely, the Katipuneros based in Cavite saw the town as their gateway to Intramuros, the Spanish seat of government in Manila. Prominent Paraqueños such as Manuel Quiogue and secular priest Father Pedro Dandan y Masangkay became leading revolutionary figures.

During the American Period of the Philippines, Parañaque became part of the newly established province of Rizal in 1901. The municipality was previously part of the province of Manila, which was in turn disestablished.

On October 12, 1903, Las Piñas was merged to become part of Parañaque. However, it was later separated on March 27, 1907 to become an independent town once again.

===Japanese occupation era===

On January 1, 1942, Parañaque was one of the towns of Rizal that was merged with Manila and Quezon City to form the City of Greater Manila. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Parañaque supplied leadership to guerilla movements such as the Hunters ROTC, as well as food and arms. Parañaque was one of the first towns to be liberated and its guerillas helped pave the way for the combined American and Philippine Commonwealth forces to enter the south of Manila. As can be gleaned from the above, Parañaque has played and continues to play a strategic role in the Philippines&#x27; political and economic progress, as shown by the quick recovery the town shown following the damage it incurred during the long Battle of Manila in 1945. The City of Greater Manila was disestablished effective August 1, 1945.

===Philippine independence===
In late 1959, 17-year-old Arturo Porcuna murdered Serafin Ong, a Lyceum of the Philippines student who belonged to a prominent family in Manila, at the Barbecue Plaza along Dewey Boulevard (now Roxas Boulevard); it was among Porcuna&#x27;s first criminal acts that lead to his notoriety as a gangster of the alias &quot;Boy Golden&quot;.

In 1965, barrios Baclaran and Tambo were excised from Parañaque to form part of the newly-established municipality of Baclaran. However, the Supreme Court of the Philippines later voided the creation of the new municipality, thus returning the aforementioned barrios to Parañaque.

On November 7, 1975, Parañaque was separated from Rizal and became part of Metropolitan Manila or the National Capital Region by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824.

===Cityhood===
Parañaque was later converted as the eleventh city of Metro Manila on February 15, 1998, and was chartered and urbanized through President Fidel V. Ramos during the celebration of the city&#x27;s 418th Founding Anniversary. Incumbent Joey Marquez became its first city mayor.

===Contemporary===
Owing to Parañaque&#x27;s strategic location, it is an important center for trade and business in Metro Manila. Baclaran, where a large number of dry goods stores are located, is one of the busiest markets in the country. Small fishing villages called “fisherman&#x27;s wharves” are also situated alongside Barangay La Huerta, where the famous DAMPA, a seaside market with numerous restaurants serving fresh seafood, is found. This has the country&#x27;s international airport and the Duty Free Philippines for imported goods and Entertainment City where three integrated resorts (IR) licensed by Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) are located. On October 9, 2018, the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange, the first landport in the Philippines, was officially opened.

<text>The canton of Schwyz ( ; ; ; ) is a canton in central Switzerland between the Alps in the south, Lake Lucerne to the west and Lake Zürich in the north, centred on and named after the town of Schwyz.

It is one of the founding cantons of Switzerland; Switzerland&#x27;s name is derived from the name of the canton, and the flag of Switzerland from its coat of arms. For the history of the name, see Schwyz. The Swiss Federal Charter is on display in Schwyz. Northeast of the town of Schwyz is Einsiedeln Abbey.

==History==

===Prehistory to the Roman era===

The earliest traces of humans in Schwyz are from the Upper Paleolithic and Early Mesolithic, or about 12,500 BC. An excavation of the karst caves in the valley of the Muota river (&quot;Muotatal&quot;) revealed numerous sites, some dating to the Younger Dryas period (). The alpine meadows at Bödmeren, Twärenen and Silberen were Stone Age hunter-gatherer camps. Ibex and red deer bones, along with charcoal, indicate that the animals were butchered and cooked in these camps. In 2009 the first Stone Age tool in the canton, a stone drill, was discovered.

During the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age, a number of pile dwellings and other settlements developed around the lakes of the canton. The two settlements at Hurden in Freienbach are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Hurden sites are related to the western Cortaillod culture (c. 4500–3500 BC). Sites on the island of Lützelau and the shore zone at Freienbach are eastern Pfyn culture (4000-3300 BC) and Corded Ware culture (2750-2450 BC). During the Bronze Age, several bridges were built between the promontory of Endingen in Rapperswil, St. Gallen and the settlements at Hurden. Over 200,000 posts and seven bridges have been discovered, along with several settlements and ritual sites. On the Schwyz side of the lake, ten different settlements from 4300-2700 BC have been discovered.

However, after 1200 BC there is very little evidence for further Bronze Age settlements in the canton. Only eight Iron Age sites have been discovered in the canton from the 8th to 1st centuries BC. During the Roman era, a Roman Vicus was established at Kempraten in Rapperswil, around the massive bridge at Seedamm (near the Bronze Age bridges) which crossed into Schwyz. A Gallo-Roman temple was built on Ufenau island around AD 200. This site was redeveloped for the present chapel of Sts. Peter and Paul. A few Roman coin hoards were discovered at Küssnacht and Rickenbach bei Schwyz, and Küssnacht may have been the site of a Roman estate.

===Early Middle Ages===

In 561, Schwyz became part of the &quot;Ducatus alamannorum&quot;; it remained relatively independent under the Alemanni dukes until the second quarter of the 8th century. The Alemanni began to settle into the valleys around 680, but for centuries the Germanic-speaking Alemanni and the Romansh-speaking Gallo-Romans coexisted. Romansh remained the main language in Einsiedeln until the 10th century.

In the 8th and 9th centuries the land was under the control of the Counts of the Zürichgau. The low-lying land along Lake Zürich was relatively easy to reach and was settled throughout the Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages, the Muotathal area was used by seasonal herders but there were very few permanent settlements. Küssnacht was first mentioned in documents in the 9th century, but it is likely that there were earlier settlements. The forests around Einsiedeln were lightly settled.

A visit of the Irish monks, Gallus and Columbanus in 611 is mentioned in the &quot;Gallusviten&quot;. However, their missionary efforts were unsuccessful in Schwyz. In the late 7th century Christianity began to spread into the region. The church at Tuggen was first built around 680/700, while the Aisleless church at Schwyz was built after 700. In the following centuries, the monasteries at Säckingen, St. Gallen and Reichenau all became centers of spreading the faith. In 948, Einsiedeln Abbey was consecrated on the site of Saint Meinrad&#x27;s murder in 861, in a high valley near Schwyz. When Einsiedeln Abbey was founded, it was granted many farms, villages and isolated churches, and it helped to spread Christianity into the high valleys.
The valley of Schwyz is first mentioned in 972 under the name &quot;Suittes&quot;. Later, a community of freemen is found settled at the foot of the Mythen. These freemen, possessing common lands, were subject only to the count of the Zürichgau, as representing the German king. The economy benefited from the transit across the Gotthard, but these profits attracted other powers, such as the Habsburgs.
The inner or mountainous portion of Schwyz was controlled by the Counts of Lenzburg, until that line died out in 1173. The Lenzburg lands were inherited by the Counts of Kyburg and Frohburg, the Lords of Rapperswil, and the Habsburgs.

During the 10th century, Einsiedeln Abbey became more and more powerful. The expanding town of Schwyz often encroached on lands that the abbey claimed. During the early 12th century, the Counts of Lenzburg (as the Count of the Zürichgau) unsuccessfully sued the abbey on behalf of Schwyz over land use and borders in the forest. Though the Counts were forced to pay a fine each time, the farmers of Schwyz continued to push into land claimed by the abbey. It soon controlled many of the surrounding lands, many of which are outside the area today covered by the canton of Schwyz. The outer or lake side parts of the canton were partly controlled by the monasteries of St. Gallen, Pfäfers, Rüti and Schänis, along with the Lords of Habsburg, Toggenburg and Rapperswil. Both Pfäffikon Castle and Alt Rapperswil Castle were built by these landlords to control their landholdings. In contrast to the Swiss Plateau, where the local nobility and knights ruled extensive landholdings for the regional counts, in Schwyz there were few local nobles. They were generally poorer and less important than the monasteries&#x27; representatives or the leaders of the local livestock collectives. Much of the farming or grazing land in the inner portion of Schwyz was not privately owned but was common land. To administer the land, the local collectives developed into regional collectives that covered several towns and villages. The collectives helped create a sense of unity throughout the farming towns and villages of the valleys and developed a tradition of independence.

With the extinction of the Kyburgs and the decline of the Lords of Rapperswil in the second half of the 13th century, the Habsburgs attempted to claim sovereignty over the Kyburg and Rapperswil lands in Central Switzerland. They succeeded in acquiring the parishes of Schwyz, Steinen, Muotathal and Morschach and, in 1283, the patronage over the monastery of Einsiedeln. In 1240, Emperor Frederick II granted the Schwyz valley imperial immediacy for services that they had rendered to the Emperor.

While the farming villages of the valleys drew closer together, the expansion of the Habsburgs and changing relationships between the farmers of the alpine valleys and the monasteries led to conflicts such as the &quot;Marchenstreit&quot; between Schwyz and Einseideln Abbey. The &quot;Marchenstreit&quot; started around 1100 over grazing rights around the Mythen mountains. It dragged on, accompanied by court cases and violent raids, until about 1350.

===Eternal alliance===

Perhaps on 1 August 1291, the cantons of Schwyz, Uri, and Unterwalden entered into an Eternal Alliance: this would eventually become the Swiss Confederation. The Federal Charter of 1291 was probably prompted by the death of Rudolf I of Habsburg on 15 July 1291 and created a defensive alliance. The &quot;Rütlischwur&quot; (Oath of the Rütli) was another alliance among the Forest Cantons in or around 1308 and brought the cantons closer together. The canton of Schwyz took leadership in the confederation early on. As early as 1320, the name of the canton was applied to the whole of the confederation. It was only in 1803, however, that the name &quot;Schweiz&quot;, as derived from the canton of &quot;Schwyz&quot;, became the official name of Switzerland. The flag of Switzerland is derived from the banner of Schwyz.

With the Eternal Alliance, the three cantons remained politically independent, with a central council to deal with disputes among the members, and with promises of military assistance. The cantons became &quot;de facto&quot; independent from the Habsburgs at the same time as the Habsburgs were attempting to expand into the Forest Cantons. When the century-old &quot;Marchenstreit&quot; between Schwyz and Einseideln Abbey led to a Schwyz attack on the Abbey in 1314, the Habsburgs, as patrons of the Abbey, had an opportunity for military action against them.
On 15 November 1315, Leopold of Austria led a large army of knights to crush the rebellious confederates, planning a surprise attack from the south via Lake Aegeri and the Morgarten pass, and counting on a complete victory over the rebellious peasants. The chronicle of Johannes von Winterthur concerning the battle puts the Austrian forces at 20,000, though that number is certainly inflated. Another account says that there were 9,000 men in the Austrian army, while Delbrück holds that the Austrian army was only 2,000-3,000 but mostly knights.

The Confederates of Schwyz — supported by the Confederates of Uri, who feared for their autonomy, but not supported by the Confederates of Unterwalden — expected the army in the west near the village of Arth, where they had erected fortifications. The size of the Confederate army is also disputed, with some chronicles placing it at 1,500, while others state that it was 3,000-4,000. Even if the Confederate army outnumbered the Habsburgs, they were an untrained militia against a force of well-equipped and trained knights.

The Confederates prepared a road block and an ambush at a point between Lake Aegeri and the Morgarten Pass where the narrow path led between the steep slope and a swamp. When the Austrian army entered the ambush, the Confederates attacked from above with rocks, logs and halberds. The knights had no room to defend themselves and suffered a crushing defeat, while the foot soldiers in the rear fled back to the city of Zug. About 1,500 Habsburg soldiers were killed in the attack.

After the victory at Morgarten, the Forest Cantons met at Brunnen on 9 December 1315 to renew the promise of mutual military assistance. The Pact of Brunnen, which emerged from the meeting, changed the pragmatic defensive alliance into a full confederacy. During the following forty years, five nearby cities (Lucerne in 1332, Zürich in 1351, Glarus and Zug in 1352 and Bern in 1353) joined the Pact and began the growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy.

===Old Swiss Confederation===

As the Confederation expanded, Schwyz took a leading role in the new organization. The aggressive, expansionist foreign policy of Schwyz led to its name being applied to the entire Confederation. Even in the 14th century, the chronicles of the surrounding countries referred to the Confederation as &quot;Schwyzer&quot; or &quot;Schweizer&quot; (the modern German spelling).

With its exterior borders secured, Schwyz began to acquire rights and land in the neighboring valley. In 1386, Schwyz invaded and occupied the town of Einsiedeln, and by 1424 the monastery was under Schwyz&#x27; control, though it retained some independence. Between 1386 and 1436, Schwyz brought under its direct control the entire March District, which became part of the canton. In 1424, Küssnacht became part of the canton. Villages and lands along Lake Zürich, including Wollerau and Pfäffikon (in 1440), Hurden and Ufenau Island all became part of the canton in the 14th and 15th centuries. King Sigismund granted Schwyz the right to High Justice over Schwyz, Einsiedeln, Küssnacht and March in 1415 as a reward for their military support against Frederick IV of Habsburg. The gradual expansion of Schwyz meant that each village entered the canton under different agreements and not all the provinces were granted the same degree of autonomy. One unique case was the town of Gersau which, while located near Schwyz, became a protectorate of the Confederacy and a semi-independent state in 1359. Gersau remained a free city-state and republic until 1817 when it was merged into Schwyz.

In 1385, Zürich, Zug and Lucerne attacked several Habsburg strongholds and in the following year Lucerne entered into alliances with several Habsburg cities in an attempt to pull those cities into Lucerne&#x27;s sphere of influence. In response, Leopold III of Austria gathered an army and prepared to invade the Confederation. After a minor battle, a short-lived armistice was declared, but by early July 1386 the Habsburg army was on the move toward the Lucerne city of Sempach. On 9 July 1386 a Confederation force from Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden met the Austrian army in the Battle of Sempach. While the Habsburg knights initially drove the lightly armored Swiss back, around mid-day the Swiss gained the upper hand and killed Leopold and forced his army to retreat. Much like the Battle of Morgarten, Sempach helped cement the Confederation into a further unified federation. While Schwyz gained no territory from the battle, both Bern and Lucerne gained significant territories at the expense of the Habsburgs.

In 1402/3, Schwyz signed an alliance with Appenzell, which was seeking independence from the Abbey of St. Gall. In May 1403, the Abbot and the Habsburgs sent a force to defeat the rebellious Appenzellers while Schwyz and Glarus sent troops to defend their ally. On 15 May 1403, the Abbot&#x27;s forces entered the pass leading to Speicher, and outside the village of Vögelinsegg they met the Appenzell army. A detachment of about 80 Appenzellers started the attack from a hill over the valley, with about 300 soldiers from Schwyz and 200 from Glarus moving around the flanks of the army. When the League&#x27;s cavalry charged up the hill, they met 2000 Appenzellers and were forced to retreat. During the retreat, about 600 horsemen and many of the 5000 infantry were killed by the Appenzell army. The League signed a peace treaty with Appenzell at Arbon, but the peace was short-lived. Appenzell formed an anti-Habsburg alliance, the &quot;Bund ob dem See&quot;, with several cities including Bregenz. In 1408 the Habsburgs besieged Bregenz, and the &quot;Bund&quot;, including Schwyz, marched out to support Bregenz. However, when they met the Habsburgs, the &quot;Bund&quot; was decisively defeated and the &quot;Bund&quot; collapsed. Schwyz paid the Habsburgs off to avoid an attack and Appenzell retained some independence but eventually became an associate of the Confederation.

In 1440–1446, Schwyz and six other cantons fought against Zürich and the Habsburgs in the Old Zürich War. The eventual peace brought Zürich back into the Confederation and forced them to cancel their treaty with the Austrians. After the war, Schwyz acquired the villages of Wollerau and Pfäffikon (now in Freienbach) and shared control of Uznach and Gaster (both now in St. Gallen) with Glarus. The war also showed that the confederation had grown into a political alliance so close that it no longer tolerated separatist tendencies of a single member.

In the 15th century, Schwyz joined Uri and Nidwalden in attempting to expand south of the Gotthard Pass to gain the revenue from trade over the pass. By the 16th century they controlled, as a federal condominium, the Riveria valley, the Blenio valley, the Maggia valley and the towns of Bellinzona, Lugano, Mendrisio and Locarno.

In 1480, Heinrich von Gundelfingen collected a number of local legends into a book called the &quot;Herkommen der Schwyzer und Oberhasler&quot; (Traditions of the Schwyzer and Oberhasler) which claimed that the land had been settled by 6,000 Swedes and 1,200 East Frisians after they rescued the Pope from a barbarian attack in 400 AD. The central elements of the myth, the Swedish origin and the rescue of the Pope became central elements in the Schwyzer state mythos. By 1531, this special relationship to the Catholic faith and the Pope was specifically mentioned in a resolution that passed in the Landsgemeinde. This resolution was passed against the backdrop of the Protestant Reformation and the tensions following the First War of Kappel two years earlier. Soon thereafter, the Catholic cantons refused to help the Three Leagues (&quot;Drei Bünde&quot;) in Graubünden in the Musso war against the Duchy of Milan, Zürich promptly considered this a breach of contracts between the confederacy and the Three Leagues and declared an embargo against the five alpine Catholic cantons, in which Bern also participated. While the &quot;Tagsatzung&quot; had successfully mediated in 1529, on this occasion the attempt failed, not least because the reformation leader Huldrych Zwingli was eager for a military confrontation. The Catholic cantons declared war on Zürich on 9 October 1531. On 11 October 1531, Schwyz, Uri and Zug decisively defeated the army of Zwingli. Hundreds of soldiers were killed, including Zwingli himself. Schwyz remained staunchly Catholic following the war.
In 1655, the canton of Schwyz began prosecuting those Protestant families who had remained in Schwyz. Some were turned in to the inquisition in Milan, some were beheaded, and the property of those who fled to Protestant Zürich was confiscated. Zürich demanded compensation for this property. Schwyz demanded the return of the refugees. Zürich urged Bern to declare war on the Catholic cantons (Schwyz and its allies Uri, Unterwalden, Zug and Lucerne). Zürich&#x27;s forces laid a fruitless siege of Rapperswil, while Catholic forces separated Zürich from Bern, beating the Bernese at the First Battle of Villmergen on 24 January 1656. Hostilities ceased on 20 February and the treaty of Villmergen of 7 March reinstalled the status quo preceding the outbreak of hostilities, wherein each canton could specify the religion of all its residents. However, religious tensions continued to rise. When the abbot of St. Gallen proposed to build a &quot;Catholic&quot; road from Schwyz to Austria that would cut off the Protestant part of Glarus from its support in Zürich, the Protestant cantons declared war on the Abbot. After the Protestant victory at the Second Battle of Villmergen, religious equality was established in the Confederation.

Throughout the time of the Old Swiss Confederation, the direct democracy of the Landsgemeinde in Schwyz was seen as the most important political institution in the canton and the municipalities of the canton. The Landsgemeinde generally met on the last Sunday in April. Mayors and other government officials were elected, new laws were discussed and voted on and traditional rights were reconfirmed. The Landsgemeinde usually met at Ibach outside Schwyz town, though there were several alternative locations. In the towns, the Landsgemeinde was made up of all land holding males or citizen. By the 16th century this class had begun to develop into an elite class that tended to lead the Landsgemeinde and be appointed as mayors. Below the citizens there was a class of residents, who were allowed to use the common land but had limited rights or political power. In the 16th century it was possible for a resident to buy his way into citizenship, however by the 17th century this had become almost impossible. To pay for the Second Battle of Villmergen, Schwyz allowed residents to once again buy citizenship. The Landsgemeinde meetings sometimes collapsed and led to riots. There were often many parties represented and the alliances and factions changed quickly and unpredictably. Schwyz was often characterized as an &quot;&quot; due to the unyielding Catholicism along with the political chaos of the Landsgemeinde.

===Helvetic Republic to the federal state===

During the years leading up to the 1798 French invasion of Switzerland, the spiritual leadership of the canton often preached against the anti-Catholic parts of the French Revolution. In the Landsgemeinde in the spring of 1798, the leadership spoke out strongly against the French and urged the people to take an uncompromising position against the newly created Helvetic Republic and the limited freedom of religion in the Republic.

In response, the cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden raised an army of about 10,000 men led by Alois von Reding to fight the French. This army was deployed along the defensive line from Napf to Rapperswil. Reding besieged French-controlled Lucerne and marched across the Brünig pass into the Berner Oberland to support the armies of Bern. At the same time, the French General Balthasar Alexis Henri Antoine of Schauenburg marched out of occupied Zürich to attack Zug, Lucerne and the Sattel pass. Even though Reding&#x27;s army won victories at Rothenthurm on 2 May 1798 and Morgarten, Schauenburg&#x27;s victory near Sattel allowed him to threaten the town of Schwyz. On 4 May 1798, the town council of Schwyz surrendered. Reding surrendered to the French on 13 May.

To help break the political power of the Inner Cantons, Uri (without the Leventina but with the Urseren), Schwyz (without March and Höfe), both half-cantons of Unterwalden, Zug, the Republic of Gersau and Engelberg Abbey were merged into the canton of Waldstätten. The new canton only had 4 seats in the Tagsatzung instead of the 16 that its members had held before the invasion. Initially, the victorious French army only lightly occupied the old core of the canton of Schwyz, but plundered the Einseideln Abbey. However, after a failed uprising in Nidwalden in the fall of 1798, Schwyz was forced to hand over all weapons and to provide supplies and housing to French troops. The heavy demands of the occupying French led to the uprising known as the &quot;Hirthemmli War&quot; in April 1799. After the French suppressed this uprising, they moved the capital of the canton of Waldstätten to Zug.

In summer and autumn of 1799, the outbreak of the War of the Second Coalition brought renewed fighting to Schwyz. In mid-August the French General André Masséna drove the Austrian-Russian army out of the Schwyz valley. By the end of September they were fighting in the March valley. Simultaneously, the Russian General Alexander Suvorov crossed the Kinzig Pass with his army and began fighting the French in the Muota valley. Suvorov was unable to force his way out of the canton and was eventually driven over the Pragel Pass to Glarus. The destruction and looting from both armies stripped the canton of food and ruined fields, causing hardship and death among the Schwyzer during the following winter.

Joseph Thomas Fassbind compiled a history of the canton during this period, published in the 1830s.

After the 1803 Act of Mediation, Schwyz regained its independence and most of the changes introduced by Napoleon were reverted. The old subject lands were converted into full and equal districts and the formerly independent towns of Gersau and Reichenburg joined the new canton of Schwyz. The loss of power in the old core of Schwyz led to resentment and tension in the canton. After the abolition of the Act of Mediation in February 1814 the old core tried to usurp the leadership role in the canton and strip the right to political participation from the former subject lands. The old subject lands resisted this and the old core was forced to agree to the 1814 Constitution which granted equal rights to all citizens. However, they were able to include the provision that the two-thirds of the seats would come from the old core of Schwyz. Furthermore, the highest cantonal authorities came from the old core. While the new constitution removed the legal difference between citizens and residents, residents were not allowed to use the extensive land owned by the citizen&#x27;s community. Tensions continued to escalate until in the Landsgemeinde of 1829, the residents from the former subject lands were driven out of the assembly. The former subject lands saw this as a clear threat to their equality, and encouraged by the July Revolution of 1830 the four outer districts; March, Einsiedeln, Pfaeffikon and Küssnacht signed a new constitution which guaranteed, among other things, proportional representation. The leaders of the old core saw this as a threat to their authority and rejected the new constitution. On 9 March 1831 the outer districts seceded from Schwyz and formed the canton of Outer Schwyz with the capital in Einsiedeln. In 1832 they established a new constitution, government and courts. In spring 1833, the Swiss Tagsatzung acknowledged the new canton, but insisted that they work toward reunification.
An altercation in Küssnacht between supporters and opponents of secession offered Inner Schwyz the opportunity to resolve the crisis with military action. They invaded and occupied Küssnacht on 31 July 1833. The Outer Schwyz and Lucerne appealed to the Swiss Confederation, which responded by invading Inner Schwyz in August. Shortly thereafter the two half-cantons reunited under a constitution that guaranteed equal rights for all residents. In the Landsgemeinde of 13 October 1833, the voting residents of the canton chose two liberal minded leaders, but shortly thereafter the conservative faction came into power again.
Under the conservative government, the canton joined the Sonderbund (separate alliance in German) in 1845 to protect cantonal sovereignty and the Catholic religion. When the Tagsatzung attempted to dissolve the Sonderbund on 21 October 1847, the Catholic cantons rebelled. On 23 November 1847 Federal troops defeated the Sonderbund at Gislikon and drove the Schwyzer army back at Meierskappel. Four days later the Sonderbund surrendered.

The conservative government of Schwyz was dissolved and a new provisional government and constitution established. The first attempt at a constitution, which split the district of Schwyz in two and moved the cantonal capital away from Schwyz, was narrowly defeated on 27 January 1848. The second constitution, which removed the mentioned points and merged the former districts of Wollerau and Pfäffikon in the district of March, was then approved by the electorate on 27 February 1848.

The new constitution of 1848 reformed the government of the canton. Perhaps the greatest change was that it abolished the Landsgemeinde, which had formerly been the supreme authority. It split the government into three branches, legislature, executive and judiciary and created a three-tier structure of municipalities, districts and canton. It created proportional representation and allowed the population to vote on laws and constitutional amendments.

===Modern Schwyz===
With the end of the Landsgemeinde in the new constitution, the cantonal elections on 3 December 1848 brought a conservative majority parliament. However, the cantonal councils then selected a liberal-conservative and liberal government. The government had the difficult task of reunifying the canton and supporting the new federal government, which 75% of Schwyzer opposed. Over the next few years the new government focused, almost exclusively, on integrating the canton into the new Confederation. Federal forgiveness of the Sonderbund War debt in 1852 and hosting the Federal Officers Festival in 1856 and the Federal Shooting Festival of 1867 all helped to reintegrate the canton.

A conservative ballot initiative in 1854 failed to reestablish the Landsgemeinde and abolish the districts, while a liberal initiative in 1866, which attempted to expand personal rights, also failed. In the early 1870s, the conservatives gained power in the cantonal government. In 1874, the Swiss Federal Constitution was completely revised, which created conflicts with the Schwyz cantonal constitution. It was revised in 1876 and accepted by 73% of voters. The new cantonal constitution limited the scope of the cantonal laws and extended the requirements for mandatory referendums.

In the mid-1890s, the liberals began to push for another constitutional revision. Their revisions included language that would give the government authority over the monasteries and their assets. The conservatives fought back with a platform of protecting the religion of most Schwyzer. In response, the government created a second version, which dropped the controversial religious portions but was otherwise unchanged. This new constitution, which required elections every four years, the popular election of all members of parliament, proportional representation in the cantonal councils and full religious freedom, was approved on 23 October 1898. This constitution remained in force, with amendments, until 2011.

Between 1833 and 1950 the population of the canton doubled from 38,351 to 71,082 people, though this increase was slower than the national average. The railroad to Küssnacht allowed that town to grow much faster than average between 1870–1914. At about the same time, a wave of immigrants from Europe (mostly from Italy) moved into the canton and a larger group of Schwyzer emigrated to the United States. On a per capita basis, Schwyz had the third highest emigration rate in Switzerland as people left for jobs. During late 19th and early 20th century, internal migration also changed the composition of the population. In 1860 almost 80% of the residents lived in the village of their birth, by 1950 it was only 50%.

The First World War was very hard on the residents of the canton. The cantonal authorities did little to prevent war time profiteering and prices for food and other necessities skyrocketed (the alternative being price controls, shortages and the creation of a Black Market). At the same time, extensive unemployment and low wages led to starvation and poverty. Some of the major industries in Schwyz at the time were tourism and the textile cottage industry, both of which collapsed, so the canton suffered disproportionately. In 1918, Schwyzer troops were called up to join the Federal Army in suppressing striking workers in the canton of Uri, in Rapperswil and in the Zürich Oberland. When the Spanish flu broke out in the army camps many Schwyzer soldiers died. The poverty and death led to a polarization of politics and the Conservatives used the slogan of &quot;flu-dead soldiers&quot; until the mid-1930s.

During the Second World War, Schwyz was generally insulated from the effects of the war. Several fortresses were built on the Rigi, in the Sattel Pass and on the Etzel and the Linth plains as part of the National Redoubt fortifications. During the war, Schwyz was twice the center of national attention. Once in 1941 on the occasion of the 650th anniversary of Confederation and in 1942, with the arrest of the owner of a dairy and mill for the extensive black market operations.

Between 1950 and 2010, the population doubled again to 146,730 people in 2010. During this period Schwyz showed one of the highest growth rates among the Swiss cantons. The highest growth was in the Outer Schwyz region. The Höfe district grew from 7,573 in 1950 to around 27,000 people in 2010. In 2004, Freienbach replaced Schwyz as the largest municipality in the canton.

The cantonal administration introduced a &quot;logo&quot; to represent its &quot;corporate identity&quot; in 1995. This was discussed controversially, and a popular initiative demanded that solely the coat of arms was to be used to represent the canton. The initiative was rejected by the popular vote on 7 December 1997, and the logo has been used officially since 1998.

==Politics==

The cantonal constitution was rewritten in 2011. Before that, the constitution dates mainly from 1876, but was revised in 1898. Under the 1876/98 constitution, the legislature (Kantonsrat) is composed of members elected by a portion of the population and holds office for four years. Originally, each member of the Kantonsrat represented 600 people or a fraction thereof over 200 people. As the population has increased while the number of members has remained fixed at about 100, this has changed. , the 13 municipalities with the smallest population each elect one member of the Kantonsrat. The other 87 seats are divided between the remaining 17 municipalities based on population. The executive (Regierungsrat) consists of seven members who are elected by a popular vote, and hold office for four years. The two members of the federal Standerat and the four (three until 2003) of the federal Nationalrat are also chosen by a popular vote. In the case of all laws approved by the legislature and important financial measures there is a requirement for an &quot;obligatory referendum&quot;. Two thousand citizens may claim a popular vote as to any decrees or resolutions of the legislature, and have also the right of &quot;initiative&quot; as to the revision of the cantonal constitution or as to legislative projects.

The KKS has operated for over 150 years, though it builds on several older schools. The first Latin school in Schwyz opened in 1627 in the former Capuchin monastery of St. Josef im Loo. This school remained open until the 1798 French invasion. On 25 July 1841, the Jesuits laid the cornerstone of what would become the Jesuit College on the site of the modern &quot;Kollegium&quot;. The school opened in 1844 but only remained under Jesuit control for three years. In 1847, Federal troops marched into Schwyz to suppress the Catholic Sonderbund and forced the Jesuits to flee.

The school continued to teach students using both religious and secular teachers until the 1970s. In 1972, the lower secondary students moved to Pfäffikon and the school became an upper secondary &quot;Kantonsschule&quot;.

<text>Muntinlupa (), officially the City of Muntinlupa (), is a highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 543,445 people.

It is bordered on the north by Taguig, to the northwest by Parañaque, by Bacoor and Las Piñas to the west, to the southwest by Dasmariñas, by San Pedro to the south, and by Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the country, to the east. From high above, the city of Muntinlupa has many large, green patches, which is unusual for Metro Manila. Because of these green patches, Muntinlupa earned the name &quot;Emerald City&quot; by the tourism establishment and also known as the &quot;Gateway to Calabarzon&quot; as it is the southernmost city of the National Capital Region.

Muntinlupa is known as the location of the national insular penitentiary, the New Bilibid Prison, where the country&#x27;s most dangerous criminals are incarcerated. This was relocated from its old site in Santa Cruz, Manila. Before the relocation of New Bilibid Prison to Muntinlupa in the 1930s, Muntinlupa was mainly dedicated to fishing and farming. Ayala Alabang Village, one of the country&#x27;s biggest and most expensive residential communities, is also located in Muntinlupa.

==Etymology==
There are three plausible origins of the name of the city:

# Its association with the thin topsoil in the area, known locally as &quot;munting lupa&quot;, or &quot;little soil&quot; in Tagalog;
# Residents, purportedly answering a question from Spaniards in the 16th century of what the name of their place was, saying &quot;Monte sa Lupa&quot;, apparently mistaking the question for what card game they were playing; and 
# The topographical nature of the area, in which case the Spanish term &quot;monte&quot;, or &quot;mountain&quot;, was expanded to &quot;muntinlupa&quot;, or &quot;mountain land&quot;. 

The 1987 Philippine Constitution spells the city&#x27;s name as &quot;Muntinglupa&quot; instead of &quot;Muntinlupa&quot;.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
In 1601, some 88 years after the arrival of Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan in the Visayas islands, the original lands constituting Muntinlupa could be deduced to have been friar lands administered by the Augustinians, then sold and assigned to the Sanctuary of Guadalupe.

In the early 1800s, Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga, an Agustinian Friar, in his Two Volume Book: &quot;Estadismo de las islas Filipinas&quot;, described Muntinlupa as a lakeside town composed of 250 tributes (each tribute representing a family of 5 to 7), and was the farthest town of the province of Tondo, itself composed of 14,437 native tributes and 3,528 Spanish Filipino tributes. Spiritually, it also belonged to the nearby Parish of Our Lady of Guadalupe at Makati and was connected to it via many rivers that streamed from Laguna de Bay through Muntinlupa towards Makati and eventually Manila proper. 

In 1869, the lands were transferred to the state and large individual landholders. In an effort by the Spanish Government to bring under closer administrative control the people living in the contiguous sitios, as well as those in Alabang, Tunasan, Sucat, and Cupang, the municipality was created upon the recommendation of Don Eduardo de Canizares.

On August 6, 1898, the town supported the Philippine Revolution against the Spaniards and formally joined the revolutionary government headed by Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo.

===American occupation era===
The Philippine Commission promulgated Rizal Province on June 11, 1901, through Act No. 137. Muntinlupa became part of the new province after being a part of the defunct province of Manila.

On October 12, 1903, Muntinlupa, alongside Taguig, was merged with Pateros by virtue of Act No. 942. On November 25, 1903, Muntinlupa was incorporated under Act No. 1008 and included within the boundary of the province of La Laguna under the municipality of Biñan. Muntinlupa residents protested this Executive Act, and through their town head, Marcelo Fresnedi, filed a formal petition to the Governor for the return of the municipality to the province of Rizal. On March 22, 1905, Act No. 1308 paved the way for Muntinlupa&#x27;s return to the province of Rizal to then become a part of Taguig, along with Pateros.
On December 19, 1917, Governor-General Francis Burton Harrison signed Executive Order 108, which made Muntinlupa an independent municipality, separating it from Taguig.

<text>The Fermi energy is a concept in quantum mechanics usually referring to the energy difference between the highest and lowest occupied single-particle states in a quantum system of non-interacting fermions at absolute zero temperature.
In a Fermi gas, the lowest occupied state is taken to have zero kinetic energy, whereas in a metal, the lowest occupied state is typically taken to mean the bottom of the conduction band.

The term &quot;Fermi energy&quot; is often used to refer to a different yet closely related concept, the Fermi &quot;level&quot; (also called electrochemical potential).
There are a few key differences between the Fermi level and Fermi energy, at least as they are used in this article:
* The Fermi energy is only defined at absolute zero, while the Fermi level is defined for any temperature.
* The Fermi energy is an energy &quot;difference&quot; (usually corresponding to a kinetic energy), whereas the Fermi level is a total energy level including kinetic energy and potential energy.
* The Fermi energy can only be defined for non-interacting fermions (where the potential energy or band edge is a static, well defined quantity), whereas the Fermi level remains well defined even in complex interacting systems, at thermodynamic equilibrium.

Since the Fermi level in a metal at absolute zero is the energy of the highest occupied single particle state,
then the Fermi energy in a metal is the energy difference between the Fermi level and lowest occupied single-particle state, at zero-temperature.

==Context==

In quantum mechanics, a group of particles known as fermions (for example, electrons, protons and neutrons) obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This states that two fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state. Since an idealized non-interacting Fermi gas can be analyzed in terms of single-particle stationary states, we can thus say that two fermions cannot occupy the same stationary state. These stationary states will typically be distinct in energy. To find the ground state of the whole system, we start with an empty system, and add particles one at a time, consecutively filling up the unoccupied stationary states with the lowest energy. When all the particles have been put in, the Fermi energy is the kinetic energy of the highest occupied state.

As a consequence, even if we have extracted all possible energy from a Fermi gas by cooling it to near absolute zero temperature, the fermions are still moving around at a high speed. The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This speed is known as the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the related Fermi temperature, do the particles begin to move significantly faster than at absolute zero.

The Fermi energy is an important concept in the solid state physics of metals and superconductors. It is also a very important quantity in the physics of quantum liquids like low temperature helium (both normal and superfluid 3He), and it is quite important to nuclear physics and to understanding the stability of white dwarf stars against gravitational collapse.

==Formula and typical values==
The Fermi energy for a three-dimensional, non-relativistic, &quot;non-interacting&quot; ensemble of identical spin- fermions is given by
formula_1
where &quot;N&quot; is the number of particles, &quot;m&quot;0 the rest mass of each fermion, &quot;V&quot; the volume of the system, and formula_2 the reduced Planck constant.

===Metals===
Under the free electron model, the electrons in a metal can be considered to form a Fermi gas. The number density formula_3 of conduction electrons in metals ranges between approximately 1028 and 1029 electrons/m3, which is also the typical density of atoms in ordinary solid matter. This number density produces a Fermi energy of the order of 2 to 10 electronvolts.

===White dwarfs===
Stars known as white dwarfs have mass comparable to the Sun, but have about a hundredth of its radius. The high densities mean that the electrons are no longer bound to single nuclei and instead form a degenerate electron gas. Their Fermi energy is about 0.3 MeV.

===Nucleus===
Another typical example is that of the nucleons in the nucleus of an atom. The radius of the nucleus admits deviations, so a typical value for the Fermi energy is usually given as 38 MeV.

== Related quantities ==
Using this definition of above for the Fermi energy, various related quantities can be useful.

The Fermi temperature is defined as
formula_4
where formula_5 is the Boltzmann constant, and formula_6 the Fermi energy. The Fermi temperature can be thought of as the temperature at which thermal effects are comparable to quantum effects associated with Fermi statistics. The Fermi temperature for a metal is a couple of orders of magnitude above room temperature.

Other quantities defined in this context are Fermi momentum
formula_7
and Fermi velocity
formula_8

These quantities are respectively the momentum and group velocity of a fermion at the Fermi surface.

The Fermi momentum can also be described as
formula_9
where formula_10, called the Fermi wavevector, is the radius of the Fermi sphere. 
formula_11 is the electron density. 

These quantities may &quot;not&quot; be well-defined in cases where the Fermi surface is non-spherical.

<text>In statistical mechanics, Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics describes the distribution of classical material particles over various energy states in thermal equilibrium. It is applicable when the temperature is high enough or the particle density is low enough to render quantum effects negligible.

The expected number of particles with energy formula_1 for Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics is

:formula_2
where:
*formula_1 is the energy of the &quot;i&quot;-th energy level,
*formula_4 is the average number of particles in the set of states with energy formula_1,
*formula_6 is the degeneracy of energy level &quot;i&quot;, that is, the number of states with energy formula_1 which may nevertheless be distinguished from each other by some other means,
*μ is the chemical potential,
*&quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant,
*&quot;T&quot; is absolute temperature,
*&quot;N&quot; is the total number of particles: formula_8
*&quot;Z&quot; is the partition function: formula_9
*&quot;e&quot; is Euler&#x27;s number

Equivalently, the number of particles is sometimes expressed as

:formula_10

where the index &quot;i&quot; now specifies a particular state rather than the set of all states with energy formula_1, and formula_12.

==History==
Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics grew out of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, most likely as a distillation of the underlying technique. The distribution was first derived by Maxwell in 1860 on heuristic grounds. Boltzmann later, in the 1870s, carried out significant investigations into the physical origins of this distribution. The distribution can be derived on the ground that it maximizes the entropy of the system.
==Relation with Maxwell–Boltzmann Distribution==

Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution and Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics are closely related. Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics is a more general principle in statistical mechanics that describes the probability of a classical particle being in a particular energy state:

:formula_13

where:
* formula_14 is the partition function: formula_15,
* formula_16 is the energy of state formula_17,
* formula_18 is Boltzmann&#x27;s constant,
* formula_19 is the absolute temperature.

Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is a specific application of Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics to the kinetic energies of gas particles. The distribution of velocities (or speeds) of particles in an ideal gas follows from the statistical assumption that the energy levels of a gas molecule are given by its kinetic energy:

:formula_20

where:
* formula_21 is the probability density function of particle speeds,
* formula_22 is the mass of a particle,
* formula_18 is Boltzmann&#x27;s constant,
* formula_19 is the absolute temperature,
* formula_25 is the speed of the particle.

===Derivation===

We can deduce the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution from Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics, starting with the Maxwell-Boltzmann probability for energy states and substituting the kinetic energy formula_26 to express the probability in terms of velocity:

:formula_27

In 3D, this is proportional to the surface area of a sphere, formula_28. Thus, the probability density function (PDF) for speed formula_25 becomes:

:formula_30

To find the normalization constant formula_31, we require the integral of the probability density function over all possible speeds to be unity:

:formula_32

Evaluating the integral using the known result formula_33, with formula_34, we obtain:

:formula_35

Therefore, the Maxwell–Boltzmann speed distribution is:

:formula_36

==Applicability==
Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics is used to derive the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of an ideal gas. However, it can also be used to extend that distribution to particles with a different energy–momentum relation, such as relativistic particles (resulting in Maxwell–Jüttner distribution), and to other than three-dimensional spaces.

Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics is often described as the statistics of &quot;distinguishable&quot; classical particles. In other words, the configuration of particle &quot;A&quot; in state 1 and particle &quot;B&quot; in state 2 is different from the case in which particle &quot;B&quot; is in state 1 and particle &quot;A&quot; is in state 2. This assumption leads to the proper (Boltzmann) statistics of particles in the energy states, but yields non-physical results for the entropy, as embodied in the Gibbs paradox.

At the same time, there are no real particles that have the characteristics required by Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics. Indeed, the Gibbs paradox is resolved if we treat all particles of a certain type (e.g., electrons, protons,photon etc.) as principally indistinguishable. Once this assumption is made, the particle statistics change. The change in entropy in the entropy of mixing example may be viewed as an example of a non-extensive entropy resulting from the distinguishability of the two types of particles being mixed.

Quantum particles are either bosons (following Bose–Einstein statistics) or fermions (subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, following instead Fermi–Dirac statistics). Both of these quantum statistics approach the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics in the limit of high temperature and low particle density.

== Derivations ==

Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics can be derived in various statistical mechanical thermodynamic ensembles:
* The grand canonical ensemble, exactly.
* The canonical ensemble, exactly.
* The microcanonical ensemble, but only in the thermodynamic limit.
In each case it is necessary to assume that the particles are non-interacting, and that multiple particles can occupy the same state and do so independently.

=== Derivation from microcanonical ensemble ===

Suppose we have a container with a huge number of very small particles all with identical physical characteristics (such as mass, charge, etc.). Let&#x27;s refer to this as the &quot;system&quot;. Assume that though the particles have identical properties, they are distinguishable. For example, we might identify each particle by continually observing their trajectories, or by placing a marking on each one, e.g., drawing a different number on each one as is done with lottery balls.

The particles are moving inside that container in all directions with great speed. Because the particles are speeding around, they possess some energy. The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is a mathematical function that describes about how many particles in the container have a certain energy. More precisely, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution gives the non-normalized probability (this means that the probabilities do not add up to 1) that the state corresponding to a particular energy is occupied.

In general, there may be many particles with the same amount of energy formula_37. Let the number of particles with the same energy formula_38 be formula_39, the number of particles possessing another energy formula_40 be formula_41, and so forth for all the possible energies formula_42 To describe this situation, we say that formula_43 is the &quot;occupation number&quot; of the &quot;energy level&quot; formula_44 If we know all the occupation numbers formula_45 then we know the total energy of the system. However, because we can distinguish between &quot;which&quot; particles are occupying each energy level, the set of occupation numbers formula_46 does not completely describe the state of the system. To completely describe the state of the system, or the &quot;microstate&quot;, we must specify exactly which particles are in each energy level. Thus when we count the number of possible states of the system, we must count each and every microstate, and not just the possible sets of occupation numbers.

To begin with, assume that there is only one state at each energy level formula_17 (there is no degeneracy). What follows next is a bit of combinatorial thinking which has little to do in accurately describing the reservoir of particles. For instance, let&#x27;s say there is a total of formula_48 boxes labelled formula_49. With the concept of combination, we could calculate how many ways there are to arrange formula_50 into the set of boxes, where the order of balls within each box isn’t tracked. First, we select formula_51 balls from a total of formula_50 balls to place into box formula_53, and continue to select for each box from the remaining balls, ensuring that every ball is placed in one of the boxes. The total number of ways that the balls can be arranged is

:formula_54

As every ball has been placed into a box, formula_55, and we simplify the expression as

:formula_56

This is just the multinomial coefficient, the number of ways of arranging &quot;N&quot; items into &quot;k&quot; boxes, the &quot;l&quot;-th box holding &quot;Nl&quot; items, ignoring the permutation of items in each box.

Now, consider the case where there is more than one way to put formula_57 particles in the box formula_58 (i.e. taking the degeneracy problem into consideration). If the formula_58-th box has a &quot;degeneracy&quot; of formula_6, that is, it has formula_6 &quot;sub-boxes&quot; (formula_62 boxes with the same energy formula_63. These states/boxes with the same energy are called degenerate states.), such that any way of filling the formula_58-th box where the number in the sub-boxes is changed is a distinct way of filling the box, then the number of ways of filling the &quot;i&quot;-th box must be increased by the number of ways of distributing the formula_43 objects in the formula_6 &quot;sub-boxes&quot;. The number of ways of placing formula_43 distinguishable objects in formula_6 &quot;sub-boxes&quot; is formula_69 (the first object can go into any of the formula_6 boxes, the second object can also go into any of the formula_6 boxes, and so on). Thus the number of ways formula_72 that a total of formula_50 particles can be classified into energy levels according to their energies, while each level formula_17 having formula_6 distinct states such that the &quot;i&quot;-th level accommodates formula_43 particles is:

:formula_77

This is the form for &quot;W&quot; first derived by Boltzmann. Boltzmann&#x27;s fundamental equation formula_78 relates the thermodynamic entropy &quot;S&quot; to the number of microstates &quot;W&quot;, where &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant. It was pointed out by Gibbs however, that the above expression for &quot;W&quot; does not yield an extensive entropy, and is therefore faulty. This problem is known as the Gibbs paradox. The problem is that the particles considered by the above equation are not indistinguishable. In other words, for two particles (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) in two energy sublevels the population represented by [A,B] is considered distinct from the population [B,A] while for indistinguishable particles, they are not. If we carry out the argument for indistinguishable particles, we are led to the Bose–Einstein expression for &quot;W&quot;:

:formula_79

The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution follows from this Bose–Einstein distribution for temperatures well above absolute zero, implying that formula_80. The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution also requires low density, implying that formula_81. Under these conditions, we may use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for the factorial:

:formula_82

to write:

:formula_83

Using the fact that formula_84 for formula_81 we can again use Stirling&#x27;s approximation to write:

:formula_86

This is essentially a division by &quot;N&quot;! of Boltzmann&#x27;s original expression for &quot;W&quot;, and this correction is referred to as .

We wish to find the formula_43 for which the function formula_72 is maximized, while considering the constraint that there is a fixed number of particles formula_89 and a fixed energy formula_90 in the container. The maxima of formula_72 and formula_92 are achieved by the same values of formula_43 and, since it is easier to accomplish mathematically, we will maximize the latter function instead. We constrain our solution using Lagrange multipliers forming the function:

:formula_94
:formula_95

Finally

:formula_96

In order to maximize the expression above we apply Fermat&#x27;s theorem (stationary points), according to which local extrema, if exist, must be at critical points (partial derivatives vanish):

:formula_97

By solving the equations above (formula_98) we arrive to an expression for formula_43:

:formula_100

Substituting this expression for formula_43 into the equation for formula_102 and assuming that formula_103 yields:

:formula_104

or, rearranging:

:formula_105

Boltzmann realized that this is just an expression of the Euler-integrated fundamental equation of thermodynamics. Identifying &quot;E&quot; as the internal energy, the Euler-integrated fundamental equation states that :

:formula_106

where &quot;T&quot; is the temperature, &quot;P&quot; is pressure, &quot;V&quot; is volume, and μ is the chemical potential. Boltzmann&#x27;s equation formula_107 is the realization that the entropy is proportional to formula_102 with the constant of proportionality being the Boltzmann constant. Using the ideal gas equation of state (&quot;PV&quot; = &quot;NkT&quot;), It follows immediately that formula_109 and formula_110 so that the populations may now be written:

:formula_111

Note that the above formula is sometimes written:

:formula_112

where formula_113 is the absolute activity.

Alternatively, we may use the fact that

:formula_114

to obtain the population numbers as

:formula_115

where &quot;Z&quot; is the partition function defined by:

:formula_116

In an approximation where &quot;εi&quot; is considered to be a continuous variable, the Thomas–Fermi approximation yields a continuous degeneracy g proportional to formula_117 so that:

:formula_118

which is just the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the energy.

=== Derivation from canonical ensemble ===

In the above discussion, the Boltzmann distribution function was obtained via directly analysing the multiplicities of a system. Alternatively, one can make use of the canonical ensemble. In a canonical ensemble, a system is in thermal contact with a reservoir. While energy is free to flow between the system and the reservoir, the reservoir is thought to have infinitely large heat capacity as to maintain constant temperature, &quot;T&quot;, for the combined system.

In the present context, our system is assumed to have the energy levels formula_119 with degeneracies formula_6. As before, we would like to calculate the probability that our system has energy formula_1.

If our system is in state formula_122, then there would be a corresponding number of microstates available to the reservoir. Call this number formula_123. By assumption, the combined system (of the system we are interested in and the reservoir) is isolated, so all microstates are equally probable. Therefore, for instance, if formula_124, we can conclude that our system is twice as likely to be in state formula_122 than formula_126. In general, if formula_127 is the probability that our system is in state formula_128,

:formula_129

Since the entropy of the reservoir formula_130, the above becomes

:formula_131

Next we recall the thermodynamic identity (from the first law of thermodynamics):

:formula_132

In a canonical ensemble, there is no exchange of particles, so the formula_133 term is zero. Similarly, formula_134 This gives

:formula_135

where formula_136 and formula_137 denote the energies of the reservoir and the system at formula_138, respectively. For the second equality we have used the conservation of energy. Substituting into the first equation relating formula_139:

:formula_140

which implies, for any state &quot;s&quot; of the system

:formula_141

where &quot;Z&quot; is an appropriately chosen &quot;constant&quot; to make total probability 1. (&quot;Z&quot; is constant provided that the temperature &quot;T&quot; is invariant.)

:formula_142

where the index &quot;s&quot; runs through all microstates of the system. &quot;Z&quot; is sometimes called the Boltzmann sum over states (or &quot;Zustandssumme&quot; in the original German). If we index the summation via the energy eigenvalues instead of all possible states, degeneracy must be taken into account. The probability of our system having energy formula_119 is simply the sum of the probabilities of all corresponding microstates:

:formula_144

where, with obvious modification,

:formula_145

this is the same result as before.

Comments on this derivation:
*Notice that in this formulation, the initial assumption &quot;... &quot;suppose the system has total &quot;N&quot; particles&quot;...&quot; is dispensed with. Indeed, the number of particles possessed by the system plays no role in arriving at the distribution. Rather, how many particles would occupy states with energy formula_119 follows as an easy consequence.
*What has been presented above is essentially a derivation of the canonical partition function. As one can see by comparing the definitions, the Boltzmann sum over states is equal to the canonical partition function.
*Exactly the same approach can be used to derive Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein statistics. However, there one would replace the canonical ensemble with the grand canonical ensemble, since there is exchange of particles between the system and the reservoir. Also, the system one considers in those cases is a single particle &quot;state&quot;, not a particle. (In the above discussion, we could have assumed our system to be a single atom.)
==Derivation from canonical ensemble==

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the probability of a particle occupying an energy state &quot;E&quot; in a classical system. It takes the following form:

:formula_147

For a system of indistinguishable particles, we start with the canonical ensemble formalism.

In a system with energy levels formula_148, let formula_149 be the number of particles in state &quot;i&quot;. The total energy and particle number are:
:formula_150

For a specific configuration formula_151, the probability in the canonical ensemble is:
:formula_152

The factor formula_153 accounts for the number of ways to distribute &quot;N&quot; indistinguishable particles among the states.

For Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, we assume that the average occupation number of any state is much less than 1 (formula_154), which leads to:
:formula_155

where formula_156 is the chemical potential determined by formula_157.

For energy states near the Fermi energy formula_158, we can express formula_159, giving:
:formula_160

For high energies (formula_161), this directly gives:
:formula_162

For low energies (formula_163), using the approximation formula_164 for small &quot;x&quot;:
:formula_165

This is the derivation of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in both energy regimes.

<doc id="170173" wikidata="Q7251920" url="?curid=170173" title="Interface (object-oriented programming)">
<text>In object-oriented programming, an interface or protocol type is a data type that acts as an abstraction of a class. It describes a set of method signatures, the implementations of which may be provided by multiple classes that are otherwise not necessarily related to each other. A class which provides the methods listed in a protocol is said to &quot;adopt&quot; the protocol, or to &quot;implement&quot; the interface.
If objects are fully encapsulated then the protocol is the only way in which they may be accessed by other objects. For example, in Java, the codice_1 interface specifies a method codice_2 which implementing classes must implement. This means that a sorting method, for example, can sort a collection of any objects of types which implement the Comparable interface, without having to know anything about the inner nature of the class (except that two of these objects can be compared by means of codice_2).

Some programming languages provide explicit language support for protocols (Ada, C#, D, Dart, Delphi, Go, Java, Logtalk, Object Pascal, Objective-C, OCaml, PHP, Racket, Seed7, Swift, Python 3.8). In languages supporting multiple inheritance, such as C++, interfaces are implemented as abstract classes.

In languages without explicit support, protocols are often still present as conventions. This is known as duck typing. For example, in Python, any class can implement an codice_4 method and be used as a collection.

Type classes in languages like Haskell, or module signatures in ML and OCaml, are used for many of the things that protocols are used for.

In Rust, interfaces are called &quot;trait&quot;s.

<doc id="170174" wikidata="Q26796319" url="?curid=170174" title="Monarchy of Sweden">
<text>The monarchy of Sweden is centred on the monarchical head of state of Sweden, by law a constitutional and hereditary monarchy with a parliamentary system. There have been kings in what now is the Kingdom of Sweden for more than a millennium. Originally an elective monarchy, it became a hereditary monarchy in the 16th century during the reign of Gustav Vasa, though virtually all monarchs before that belonged to a limited and small number of political families which are considered to be the royal dynasties of Sweden.

The official continuous count usually begins with the kings who ruled both Svealand and Götaland as one kingdom. Sweden&#x27;s monarchy is amongst the oldest in the world, with a regnal list stretching back to the tenth century, starting with Eric the Victorious; the Swedish monarchy has, for the past thousand years, undergone cycles of decline and strengthening, culminating in the modern constitutional monarchy.

The Swedish monarchy has been one of the key features in the development of Swedish culture, having for centuries patronized the arts and sciences. Several of Sweden&#x27;s most prestigious academies and cultural institutions are under Swedish royal protection. This historical role politically, militarily and culturally, in spite of the country&#x27;s otherwise liberal leanings, has resulted in the Swedish monarchy being popular. In recent years, however, some of the most serious criticism ever published has taken place about the way his monarchy has developed under the current king&#x27;s fifty-year reign.

Sweden in the present day is a representative democracy in a parliamentary system based on popular sovereignty, as defined in the current Instrument of Government (one of the four Basic Laws of the Realm which makes up the written constitution). The monarch and the members of the royal family undertake a variety of official, unofficial and other representational duties within Sweden and abroad. The current king of Sweden is Carl XVI Gustaf, while his heir is Crown Princess Victoria.

The Swedish monarch has numerous residences, primarily state-owned but some privately owned; their official residence and workplace is Stockholm Palace, while Drottningholm Palace serves as the monarchy&#x27;s private residence. Other notable residences include Gripsholm Castle and Ulriksdal Palace, as well as others throughout Sweden. Several large palaces and a considerable section of the Swedish capital of Stockholm have been at the disposal of the monarch since 1809.

== History ==

=== Pre-16th century ===
Scandinavian peoples have had kings since prehistoric times. As early as the 1st century CE, Tacitus wrote that the Suiones had a king, but the order of Swedish regnal succession up until King Eric the Victorious (died 995), is known almost exclusively through accounts in historically controversial Norse sagas (see Mythical kings of Sweden and Semi-legendary kings of Sweden).

Originally, the Swedish king had combined powers limited to that of a war chief, a judge and a priest at the Temple at Uppsala (see Germanic king). However, there are thousands of runestones commemorating commoners, but no known chronicle about the Swedish kings prior to the 14th century (though a list of kings was added in the Västgöta Law), and there is a relatively small number of runestones that are thought to mention kings: Gs 11 (Emund the Old – reigned 1050–1060), U 11 (Håkan the Red – late 11th century) and U 861 (Blot-Sweyn – reigned 1080).

About 1000 A.D., the first king known to rule both Svealand and Götaland was Olof Skötkonung, but further history for the next two centuries is obscure, with many kings whose tenures and actual influence/power remains unclear. The Royal Court of Sweden, however, does count Olof&#x27;s father, Eric the Victorious, as Sweden&#x27;s first king. The power of the king was greatly strengthened by the introduction of Christianity during the 11th century, and the following centuries saw a process of consolidation of power into the hands of the king. The Swedes traditionally elected a king from a favored dynasty at the Stones of Mora, and the people had the right to elect the king as well as to depose him. The ceremonial stones were destroyed around 1515.

In the 12th century, the consolidation of Sweden was still affected by dynastic struggles between the Erik and Sverker clans, which ended when a third clan married into the Erik clan and the House of Bjälbo was established on the throne. That dynasty formed pre-Kalmar Union Sweden into a strong state, and finally King Magnus Eriksson (reigned 1319–1364) even ruled Norway (1319–1343) and Scania (1332–1360). Following the Black Death, the union weakened, and Scania was captured by Denmark.

In 1397, after the Black Death and domestic power struggles, Queen Margaret I of Denmark united Sweden (then including Finland), Denmark and Norway (then including Iceland) in the Union of Kalmar with the approval of the Swedish nobility. Continual tension within each country and the union led to open conflict between the Swedes and the Danes in the 15th century. The union&#x27;s final disintegration in the early 16th century led to prolonged rivalry between Denmark-Norway and Sweden (with Finland) for centuries to come.

=== 16th- and 17th-century changes ===









Catholic bishops had supported the King of Denmark, Christian II, but he was overthrown in a rebellion led by nobleman Gustav Vasa, whose father had been executed at the Stockholm bloodbath. Gustav Vasa (hereinafter referred to as Gustav I) was elected King of Sweden by the estates of the realm, assembled in Strängnäs on 6 June 1523.

Inspired by the teachings of Martin Luther, Gustav I used the Protestant Reformation to curb the power of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1527 he persuaded the estates of the realm, assembled in the city of Västerås, to confiscate church lands, which comprised 21% of the country&#x27;s farmland. At the same time, he broke with the papacy and established a reformed state church: the Church of Sweden. Throughout his reign, Gustav I suppressed both aristocratic and peasant opposition to his ecclesiastical policies and efforts at centralisation, which to some extent laid the foundation for the modern Swedish unitary state. Legally Sweden has only been a hereditary monarchy since 1544 when the Riksdag of the Estates, through &quot;Västerås arvförening&quot;, designated the sons of King Gustav I as the heirs to the Throne.

Tax reforms took place in 1538 and 1558, whereby multiple complex taxes on independent farmers were simplified and standardised throughout the district and tax assessments per farm were adjusted to reflect ability to pay. Crown tax revenues increased, but more importantly the new system was perceived as fairer. A war with Lübeck in 1535 resulted in the expulsion of the Hanseatic traders, who previously had had a monopoly on foreign trade. With its own burghers in charge, Sweden&#x27;s economic strength grew rapidly, and by 1544 Gustav controlled 60% of the farmlands in all of Sweden. Sweden now built the first modern army in Europe, supported by a sophisticated tax system and an efficient bureaucracy.

At the death of King Gustav I in 1560, he was succeeded by his oldest son Eric XIV. His reign was marked by Sweden&#x27;s entrance into the Livonian War and the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War. The combination of Eric&#x27;s developing mental disorder and his opposition to the aristocracy led to the Sture Murders in 1567 and the imprisonment of his brother John (III), who was married to Catherine Jagiellon, sister of King Sigismund II of Poland. In 1568 Eric was dethroned and succeeded by John III. In domestic politics John III showed clear Catholic sympathies, inspired by his queen, creating friction with the Swedish clergy and nobility. He reintroduced several Catholic traditions previously abolished, and his foreign policy was affected by his family connection to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, where his eldest son had been made King Sigismund III in 1587. Following the death of his father, Sigismund tried to rule Sweden from Poland, leaving Sweden under the control of a regent – his paternal uncle (Gustav I&#x27;s youngest son) Charles (IX) – but was unable to defend his Swedish throne against the ambitions of his uncle. In 1598 Sigismund and his Swedish-Polish army were defeated at the Battle of Stångebro by the forces of Charles, and he was declared deposed by the Estates in 1599.

In 1604, the Estates finally recognized the regent and de facto ruler as King Charles IX. His short reign was one of uninterrupted warfare. The hostility of Poland and the breakup of Russia involved him in overseas contests for the possession of Livonia and Ingria, the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611) and the Ingrian War, while his pretensions to claim Lapland brought on a war with Denmark (Kalmar War) in the last year of his reign.

Gustavus Adolphus inherited three wars from his father when he ascended to the throne. From 1612, when Count Axel Oxenstierna was appointed Lord High Chancellor, which he remained until Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s death, the two men struck a long and successful partnership and complemented each other well: In Oxenstierna&#x27;s own words, his &quot;cool&quot; balanced the King&#x27;s &quot;heat&quot;. The war against Russia (the Ingrian War) ended in 1617 with the Treaty of Stolbovo, which excluded Russia from the Baltic Sea. The final inherited war, the war against Poland, ended in 1629 with the Truce of Altmark, which transferred the large province of Livonia to Sweden and freed the Swedish forces for subsequent intervention in the Thirty Years&#x27; War in Germany, where Swedish forces had already established a bridgehead in 1628. Brandenburg was torn apart by a quarrel between the Protestants and the Catholics. When Gustavus Adolphus began his push into northern Germany in June–July 1630, he had just 4,000 soldiers. But he was soon able to consolidate the Protestant position in the north, using reinforcements from Sweden and money supplied by France at the Treaty of Bärwalde. Gustavus Adolphus was killed at the 1632 Battle of Lützen. Queen Maria Eleonora and the king&#x27;s ministers took over the government of the Realm on behalf of Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; underage daughter Christina, until she reached the age of majority. Gustavus Adolphus is often regarded by military historians as one of the greatest military commanders of all time, with innovative use of combined arms. 

Christina succeeded her father aged six. A regency government ruled in her name until she turned 18 years of age. During the regency, Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna wrote the 1634 Instrument of Government, which although never approved by any monarch, continued to have an important normative role in the state administration. Christina early on showed an interest in literature and the sciences and famously brought René Descartes to Sweden. Sweden continued to be involved in the Thirty Years&#x27; War during reign of Christina and that conflict was settled at the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, and the Swedish monarch received representation at the Imperial Diet due to the German conquests (Bremen-Verden and Swedish Pomerania) that were made. Having decided not to marry, Christina abdicated the throne on 5 June 1654 in favor of her cousin Charles X Gustav, went abroad, and converted to Roman Catholicism.










The Estates elected Charles X Gustav as their new King, and his short reign is best characterized by foreign wars: first a lengthy campaign within Poland and then with Denmark. In the latter case, the risky 1658 March across the Belts which resulted in the Treaty of Roskilde, would prove to be the largest permanent territorial gain Sweden ever had: Skåne, Blekinge and Bohuslän now became Swedish provinces and have remained so ever since. Charles X Gustav was not satisfied, as he wanted to crush Denmark once and for all, but the 1659 Assault on Copenhagen did not prove successful for the Swedes, largely due to the Dutch naval intervention to the aid of the Danes.

Charles X Gustav died in Gothenburg in 1660 and as the Crown passed to his five-year-old son Charles XI, a new regency government would assume the responsibilities of the state. The regency government, composed of aristocrats and led by Chancellor Count Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, was more interested in feathering their own nests rather than working in the interest of the country at large. When Charles XI came of age in 1672, the effectiveness of the armed forces had seriously deteriorated and the country was ill-prepared as the King of Denmark, Christian V, invaded to settle old scores. The Danes were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts, and Charles XI undertook several measures to prevent what had just almost happened from occurring again: reducing the influence of the aristocracy by nationalizing estates and properties which had been handed out to them by his predecessors, introducing the Allotment system () which would form the basis of the armed forces until the 20th century, and with the support of the Estates he was declared in 1680 an absolute monarch.

Charles XI was succeeded by his son, Charles XII, who would prove to be an extremely able military commander, defeating far larger enemies with the small but highly professional Swedish army. His defeat of the Russians at Narva when just 18 years old was to be his greatest victory. However his campaigning at the head of his army during the Great Northern War would ultimately lead to catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Poltava after which he spent several years in Turkey (now Moldova). Some years later he was killed at the Siege of Fredriksten during an attempt to invade Norway. The Swedish Age of Greatness () had ended.

===18th century to the present===











Charles XII&#x27;s sister, Ulrika Eleonora, now claimed the throne over her nephew and son of her elder sister, Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (see genealogy chart above). Charles Frederick had the claim of seniority within the family, but Ulrica Eleonora claimed that her elder sister had not &quot;acquired the consent of the Parliamentary Estates&quot; for her marriage to his father, according to laws of succession laid down in &quot;Norrköpings arvförening&quot;. The duke&#x27;s party asserted that the absolute monarchy in Sweden, which his grandfather King Charles XI had created, made that marriage clause irrelevant. When Charles Frederick was confronted with Ulrika Eleonora, he was forced by Arvid Horn to greet her as queen. He asked to be granted the title Royal Highness and to be recognised as her heir, but when her husband, Frederick of Hesse, instead was given the title, he left Sweden in 1719. In 1723, he was granted the title Royal Highness in his absence, but his pro-Russian policy at that time made him impossible as heir to the Swedish throne. His marriage in 1725 to Anna, the daughter of Peter of Great, did not help his case. His mother, and later Hedwig Eleonora, both supported and worked for his right to be considered heir of Sweden after his childless uncle.

Ulrika Eleonora was forced by the Estates to sign the 1719 Instrument of Government, which ended the absolute monarchy and made the Riksdag of the Estates the highest organ of the state and reduced the role of monarch to a figurehead. The Age of Liberty () with its parliamentary rule, dominated by two parties – the Caps and the Hats – had begun. Ulrika Eleonora had had enough after a year on the throne and abdicated in favor of her husband, Frederick, who had little interest in the affairs of state and was elected King by the Estates as King Frederick I, resulting in the 1720 Instrument of Government: content-wise almost identical to the one from 1719. Despite having many extra-marital affairs, Frederick I never sired a legitimate heir to the throne.

 who had adopted his nephew as her heir. On his mother&#x27;s side, Adolf Frederick was descended from King Gustav Vasa and Christina Magdalena, a sister of Charles X of Sweden. He succeeded as King Adolf Frederick 8 years later on 25 March 1751.

During his 20-year reign, Adolf Frederick was little more than a figurehead, the real power being with the Riksdag of the Estates, often distracted by party strife. Twice he endeavored to free himself from the tutelage of the estates. The first occasion was in 1756. Stimulated by his consort Louisa Ulrika of Prussia (sister of Frederick the Great), he tried to regain a portion of the attenuated prerogative through the Coup of 1756 to abolish the rule of the Riksdag of the Estates and reinstate absolute monarchy in Sweden. He nearly lost his throne in consequence. On the second occasion during the December Crisis of 1768, under the guidance of his eldest son, Gustav, he succeeded in overthrowing the &quot;Cap&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Mössorna&quot;) senate, but was unable to make any use of his victory.

Adolf Frederick&#x27;s son, King Gustav III, was more successful in restoring royal authority. In 1772, the 1720 Instrument in Government was later replaced by the 1772 Instrument of Government in a self-coup orchestrated by the King.
On 17 September 1809 in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn, as a result of the poorly managed Finnish War, Sweden had to surrender Finland to Russia. King Gustav IV Adolf and his descendants were deposed in a coup d&#x27;état led by dissatisfied army officers. The childless uncle of the former king was almost immediately elected as King Charles XIII. The Instrument of Government of 1809 put an end to royal absolutism by dividing the legislative power between the Riksdag (primary) and the king (secondary), and vested executive power in the king when acting through the Council of State.

The present Bernadotte dynasty was established in September 1810 when the Riksdag, convened in Örebro, elected French Marshal and Prince of Pontecorvo Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte as crown prince. This took place because Charles XIII had no legitimate heir, and a crown prince previously elected in January 1810, Charles August, suddenly had died of a stroke during a military exercise.

Although the 19th century Bernadotte monarchs that would follow Charles XIV John&#x27;s reign tried to defend the power and privileges they still had, the tide incrementally turned against &quot;personal regal rule&quot; () with the growth of the liberals, social democrats, and the expansion of the franchise.

The daughter of Gustav IV Adolph, Princess Sofia Wilhelmina (21 May 1801 – 1865) married Grand Duke Leopold of Baden, and their granddaughter Victoria of Baden married the Bernadotte king Gustaf V of Sweden. The present King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden is thus Gustav IV&#x27;s heir through his grandfather, Gustav VI Adolf.














When King Gustav V publicly objected to the defence budget cuts made by Prime Minister Karl Staaff and the cabinet just before the First World War in event known as the Courtyard Crisis accompanied by the Peasant armament support march (), it was seen as a deliberate provocation by conservatives and reactionaries against the uncodified norm of a parliamentary system supported by the liberals and the social democrats, leading to Staaff&#x27;s resignation. Gustaf V then appointed a caretaker government, supported by the conservatives, led by legal scholar Hjalmar Hammarskjöld, which remained in power longer than expected due to the outbreak of World War I (in which Sweden remained neutral) and increased defence spending was no longer a controversial issue. Nevertheless, in the year of the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, social tensions continued to rise; the general election in 1917 gave the liberals and social democrats greatly strengthened representation in both Riksdag chambers and a conservative government was no longer a defensible option. Following the definite breakthrough of parliamentarism in 1917, with the appointment of the coalition government of liberals and social democrats led by professor Nils Edén, the political influence of the King was considerably reduced and an unwritten constitutional precedent was set that would remain in effect until 1975.

Only during World War II, in the so-called Midsummer crisis (regarding the issue whether neutral Sweden should permit rail transport of German troops from Norway passing through to Finland), did Gustaf V allegedly try to intervene in the political process by threatening to abdicate.

King Gustaf VI Adolf succeeded his elderly father who died in 1950, and he is generally regarded as a constitutional monarch who stayed out of politics and controversy. In 1954, a royal commission began work on whether Sweden should undergo constitutional reform to adapt the 1809 Instrument of Government to current political realities, or whether a new one should be written; ultimately the latter idea was chosen. The future role of the monarchy was settled in a manner well known within Swedish political discourse: a political compromise reached at the summer resort of Torekov in 1971 (hence known as the &quot;Torekov compromise&quot;, ) by representatives of four of the parties in the Riksdag (the Social Democrats, the Centre Party, the Liberal People&#x27;s Party, and the Moderate Party, that is all the parties except the Communists). It mandated that the monarchy would remain largely as it was but would become entirely ceremonial, without any residual political powers left.

Following the required double Riksdag votes that took place in 1973 and 1974, a new Instrument of Government was brought into effect. The monarch&#x27;s functions and duties, as defined in the 1974 Constitution Act, include heading the special cabinet council held when there is a change of government, but no executive powers with respect to the governance of the realm are vested in him.

Carl XVI Gustaf became king on 15 September 1973 on the death of his grandfather Gustaf VI Adolf and because of his father&#x27;s early death has become the longest reigning monarch in Swedish history. His King&#x27;s Golden Jubilee was celebrated in 2023. Leading up to that year and including it, beginning already in 2018, some of the most serious criticism ever published took place about Carl Gustaf and the way the monarchy has developed during his reign.

==Constitutional and official role==
When, on 1 January 1975, it replaced the Instrument of Government of 1809 as part of the Constitution of Sweden, the Instrument of Government of 1974 () transformed the advisory Council of State () into the collegial Government (), to which all executive power was transferred. Responsibility for nominating and dismissing the prime minister (who, since 1975, is elected by the Riksdag) was transferred to the Speaker of the Riksdag; the prime minister appoints and dismisses the other ministers at his or her discretion. Furthermore, bills passed by the Riksdag become law without royal assent: the prime minister or any other cabinet minister signs them &quot;On Behalf of the Government&quot; ().

Although the unwritten precedent was set in 1917, when Gustaf V had little choice but to support the idea of a parliamentary system and promised Prime Minister Nils Edén to stop seeking advice from secret advisors other than the duly appointed cabinet ministers and not to interfere in politics again; the Torekov compromise, struck in 1971 by the four major parties at the time, provided, and continues to provide, a majority consensus in Swedish political discourse on the role of the monarchy within the constitutional framework. The official motive for the radical changes which came to pass in 1975 was for it to be as descriptive as possible of the workings of the state and clear on how decisions actually are made. Minister of Justice Lennart Geijer further remarked on the 1973 government bill that any continued pretensions of royal involvement in government decision making would be of a &quot;fictitious nature&quot; and therefore &quot;highly unsatisfactory&quot;.

Thus, the monarch lost all formal executive powers, becoming a ceremonial and representative figurehead. The monarch, while explicitly referred to as the &quot;Head of State&quot; () in the 1974 Instrument of Government, is not even the chief executive. The Instrument of Government of 1974 does grant the person serving as king or queen regnant absolute immunity from criminal (but not civil) charges for as long as he or she remains in office. The monarch therefore cannot be prosecuted or otherwise held to account for his or her actions, both official and private, in judicial proceedings. None of the other members of the royal family or the employees the Royal Court enjoy similar immunity.

At the request of the Speaker of the Riksdag, the monarch opens the annual session of the Riksdag () in the chamber of the Riksdag building. The king or queen regnant also receives Letters of Credence of foreign ambassadors sent to Sweden and signs those of Swedish ambassadors sent abroad. The monarch also chairs the Cabinet Council () in a session that establishes the new government following a general election or major cabinet reshuffle and also chairs information councils () approximately four times a year to get information from the assembled Government, apart from that given by ministers in individual audiences or through other means. Formally, it is the explicit responsibility of the prime minister to keep the monarch informed on the affairs of the realm; the failure to do so following the 2004 tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean (in which many Swedes perished) gave rise to wide criticism of Prime Minister Göran Persson for his handling of the matter. The monarch also chairs the Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs (), a body that enables the government of the day to inform not only the head of state, but also the speaker and representatives of the opposition parties in the Riksdag, on foreign affairs issues in a confidential manner.

While the monarch is no longer the commander-in-chief () of the Swedish Armed Forces, as he once was under the 1809 Instrument of Government, he is the foremost representative of the Swedish defence establishment and holds supreme rank in each of the service arms. He ranks as a four star admiral in the Swedish Navy and general in the Swedish Army and Air Force. As part of his court, the monarch has a military staff, which is headed by a senior officer (usually a general or admiral, retired from active service) and includes active duty military officers serving as aides-de-camp to the monarch and his or her family.

==Cultural role==
The monarch and members of the Royal Family undertake a variety of official, unofficial and other representative duties within Sweden and abroad. The monarch and his or her family play a central role in state visits to Sweden and conduct state visits to other nations on behalf of Sweden. Other members of the Royal Family may also represent the country abroad at lesser functions.
Many of the Swedish general flag flying days have direct royal connections; among them are the name days of the King (28 January), the Queen (8 August), and the Crown Princess (12 March); the birthdays of the King (30 April), the Queen (23 December), and the Crown Princess (14 July); and Gustavus Adolphus Day (), on 6 November, in memory of King Gustavus Adolphus, who was killed on that date (old style) in 1632 in the Battle of Lützen. None of these flag days are public holidays, however.

Perhaps the most globally known ceremony in which the Royal Family annually participate is the Nobel Prize award ceremony held at the Stockholm Concert Hall (and the subsequent banquet in the Stockholm City Hall), where the monarch hands out the Nobel Prizes on behalf of the Nobel Foundation for outstanding contributions to mankind in physics, chemistry, literature, physiology or medicine, and the economic sciences.

&quot;Eriksgata&quot; was the name of the traditional journey of newly elected medieval Swedish kings through important provinces to have their election confirmed by local &quot;Things&quot;. The actual election took place at the Stone of Mora in Uppland and participation was originally restricted to the people of that area; hence, the need of having the election confirmed by the other parts of the realm. The Eriksgata gradually lost its importance when, as of the 14th century, representatives of other parts of Sweden began to participate in the election. After 1544, when hereditary monarchy was instituted, that meant that the Eriksgata had little practical importance. The last king to travel the Eriksgata according to the old tradition was Charles IX, whose reign began in 1604. Later, kings, up until present times, have made visits to all the Swedish provinces and called them an &quot;Eriksgata&quot;, while those visits bear little resemblance to the medieval tradition.

==Titles==
===Monarch===
The full title of the Swedish monarch from 1523 to 1973 was:

During the reign of the House of Holstein-Gottorp from 1751 to 1818, the title &quot;Heir to Norway&quot; () was also used, as well as other titles connected to the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp. When, after the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was in personal union with Sweden, the title included &quot;King of Norway&quot;, in older Swedish spellings: .

Upon his accession, Carl XVI Gustaf chose for his title simply (King of Sweden).

===Dynasts===
The customary title of the heir apparent is crown prince (&quot;kronprins&quot;) or crown princess (&quot;kronprinsessa&quot;). The wife of a crown prince would also receive a corresponding title, but not the husband of a crown princess. The traditional official title used until 1980 for other dynastic male heirs was hereditary prince (&quot;arvfurste&quot;), although the word prince (&quot;prins&quot;) was used in constitutional legal texts such as the Act of Succession and also colloquially and informally. Female dynasts are titled princess (&quot;prinsessa&quot;).

The Swedish Succession Act was altered in 1980 to allow for female succession to the throne.

===Ducal titles===

King Gustav III revived a tradition from the time of Gustav Vasa and the medieval era by giving male heirs to the throne ducal titles of Swedish provinces. The difference between the ducal titles from the Vasa era and those granted by Gustav III is they now are non-hereditary courtesy titles given at birth. Since 1980, they have been conferred to all royal heirs, male and female. The wives of royal dukes have always shared their husbands&#x27; titles; the husbands of royal duchesses have done so as of 2010.

== Symbols of the monarchy ==

=== Regalia ===
The regalia of Sweden are kept deep in the vaults of the (), located underneath the Royal Palace in Stockholm, in a museum which has been open to the public since 1970. Among the oldest objects in the collection are the sword of Gustav Vasa and the crown, orb, sceptre and key of King Erik XIV. The Regalia is state property and the government authority which holds it in trust is the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency.

The last king to have been crowned was Oscar II. His son and successor, Gustaf V, abstained from having a coronation. While the crowns and coronets have not been worn by Swedish royalty since 1907, they are nevertheless still displayed on royal occasions such as at weddings, christenings and funerals. Until 1974, the crown and sceptre were also displayed on cushions beside the Silver Throne at the annual solemn opening of the Riksdag ().

=== Royal orders of chivalry ===

The Royal orders have a historical basis, dating back to the 1606 founding of the now extinct Jehova Order. The Royal Orders of Knights of Sweden were only truly codified in the 18th century, with their formal foundation in 1748 by King Frederick I. In 1974 the Riksdag significantly changed the conditions and criteria under which orders and decorations could be awarded: that no Swedish citizen outside the Royal Family is eligible to receive such decorations. The Order of the Seraphim () is only awarded to foreign heads of state and members of the Swedish and foreign royal families, while the Order of the Polar Star () was only to be bestowed on any non-Swedish citizen. Following the reforms, the Order of the Sword () and the Order of Vasa () were no longer conferred: officially they were declared as &quot;dormant&quot;. In 2022 the government proposed a new reform taking effect in 2023 that once again opened the Royal Orders so that they now may be awarded to Swedish citizens again. The Order of the Seraphim however was not affected by these changes.

Between 1975 and 2023, H. M. The King&#x27;s Medal () was the highest honour that could be awarded to Swedish citizens other than members of the Royal Family.

=== Royal residences ===
The Royal Palaces (including the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Drottningholm Palace, Haga Palace, Rosendal Palace, Ulriksdal Palace, Rosersberg Palace, Tullgarn Palace and Gripsholm Castle) are government property, managed by the National Property Board () and are at the disposal of the Monarch, an arrangement that has been in place since the beginning of the 19th century. There are also residences which are held privately by the Royal Family, such as Solliden Palace on the island of Öland, a cottage in Storlien in the Jämtland and Villa Mirage in Sainte-Maxime in southern France (originally acquired by Prince Bertil).

==== Royal Palace ====
The Royal Palace (), also known as Stockholm Palace (), is the official residence of the king. The Royal Palace is located on &quot;Stadsholmen&quot; (&quot;City Island&quot;), commonly known as &quot;Gamla Stan&quot; (&quot;the Old Town&quot;) in the national capital city Stockholm.

The offices of the king, other members of the Swedish Royal Family, and the offices of the Royal Court are located in the palace. The Royal Palace is used for representative purposes and State occasions by the king. The Royal Palace is guarded by &quot;Högvakten&quot;, a royal guard, consisting of regular service members of the Swedish Armed Forces. The tradition of having a regular unit of the Army guarding at the royal residence dates back to 1523. Until the mid-19th century, the royal guards also maintained law and order in the city and provided firefighting services.
The southern façade faces the grand style slope &quot;Slottsbacken&quot;; the eastern façade borders &quot;Skeppsbron&quot;, a quay which passes along the eastern waterfront of the old town; on the northern front &quot;Lejonbacken&quot; is a system of ramps named for the Medici lions, sculptures on the stone railings; and the western wings border the open space &quot;Högvaktsterrassen&quot;. The Royal Palace in Stockholm is unique among European royal residences in that large portions of it are open year-round to visitors, who pay entrance fees.

The first building on this site was a fortress with a keep built in the 13th century by Birger Jarl to defend the entry into Lake Mälaren. The fortress gradually grew to a castle, known as &quot;Tre Kronor&quot;: named after the spire on the centre tower with Three Crowns, which have become the Swedish national symbol. In the late 16th century, work was done to transform the castle into a Renaissance palace during the reign of John III. In 1690, it was decided that the castle be rebuilt in Baroque style in a design by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger. In 1692, work began on the northern row. However, much of the old castle was destroyed in a disastrous fire on 7 May 1697.

Tessin rebuilt the damaged palace, and work continued for another 63 years. Semicircular wings around the outer western courtyard were finished in 1734, the palace church was finished in the 1740s, and the exterior was finished in 1754. The royal family moved to the palace with the southwest, southeast, and northeast wings finished. The northwest wing was finished in 1760. In the north, &quot;Lejonbacken&quot; (the &quot;Lion&#x27;s Slope&quot;) was rebuilt from 1824 to 1830.

==== Drottningholm Palace ====
Drottningholm Palace () is located at Drottningholm on the island of Lovön (in Ekerö Municipality of Stockholm County), and is one of Sweden&#x27;s Royal Palaces. It was originally built in the late 16th century. It has served as a residence of the Swedish royal family members for most of the 18th and 19th centuries. Apart from being the current private residence of the King and Queen, Drottningholm Palace is a popular tourist attraction.

The gardens and park areas surrounding Drottningholm Palace and adjacent to its buildings are one of the main attractions for the tourists that visit the palace each year. The gardens have been established in stages since the palace was first built, resulting in many different styles.

The royal domain of Drottningholm is a well-preserved milieu from the 17th and 18th centuries, inspired by French buildings such as the Chateau of Versailles, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, principally because of the Drottningholm Palace Theatre and the Chinese Pavilion at Drottningholm. It was added to the World Heritage List in 1991.

==== Haga Palace ====
Haga Palace (), formerly known as the Queen&#x27;s Pavilion (), is located in the Haga Park, Solna Municipality in Metropolitan Stockholm. The palace, built between 18021805, was modelled after balletmaster Louis Gallodier&#x27;s Italian villa at Drottningholm by architect Carl Christoffer Gjörwell on appointment by King Gustaf IV Adolf for the royal children. It has been the home or summer house of several members of the Swedish royal family – notably it was the birthplace of the present King Carl XVI Gustaf – until 1966 when King Gustaf VI Adolf transferred its disposal to the prime minister and it was turned into a guest house for distinguished foreign official visitors (heads of state and heads of government et cetera).

In April 2009, it was announced by Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt that the rights of disposal of the palace would be transferred back to the King and thus could be used by Crown Princess Victoria and her husband, Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland. They moved into the palace in the autumn after their wedding on 19 June 2010.

== Royal Family ==

The Swedish royal family is, according to the Royal Court, currently categorized into three groups; 
* first, those with royal titles and style (manner of address) who perform official and unofficial engagements for the nation, are the members of the Royal Family () (currently this category only includes the King, Queen and their descendants, including spouses);
* second, those with royal titles and style (manner of address) who perform no official engagements (, usually stylized with the shortform &quot;Kungl. Huset&quot;); 
* and third, the extended family of the King (, usually stylized with the shortform &quot;Kungl. Familjens övriga medlemmar&quot;) which is other close relatives who are not dynasts and thus do not represent the country officially.

However, in any case, there is no legislation or other public document which delineates the rules of membership in either the Royal House or Royal Family, as it is left to the sole discretion of the King.

=== The line of succession ===

The Act of Succession of 1810 provides the rules governing the line of succession and designates the legitimate heirs to the Swedish Throne; it also states in article 4 that the Monarch and dynastic members of the Royal House must at all times be a Protestant Christian of the &quot;pure evangelical faith&quot; (by implication the Church of Sweden).

A rewrite of the Act, entering into force in 1980, fundamentally changed the rules of succession from agnatic primogeniture to absolute primogeniture. This allowed for the crown to pass to the eldest child regardless of gender and thus retroactively installed Princess Victoria as crown princess over her younger brother, Prince Carl Philip, who had been born as crown prince a few months before.

In its present reading, Article 1 of the Act of Succession limits the potential number of claimants to the throne, so that only the descendants of Carl XVI Gustaf can inherit the Throne. If the royal house were to be extinct, the Riksdag is not obligated to elect a new royal house, as it once was up until the constitutional reforms of the 1970s.

<doc id="170175" wikidata="Q377794" url="?curid=170175" title="Parabolic microphone">
<text>A parabolic microphone is a microphone that uses a parabolic reflector to collect and focus sound waves onto a transducer, in much the same way that a parabolic antenna (e.g. satellite dish) does with radio waves. Though they lack high fidelity, parabolic microphones have great sensitivity to sounds coming from one direction, along the axis of the dish, and can pick up distant sounds.

==Limitations==
Parabolic microphones are generally not used for high-fidelity applications because dishes small enough to be portable have poor low-frequency response. This is because, from the Rayleigh criterion, parabolic dishes can only focus waves with a wavelength much smaller than the diameter of their aperture. The wavelength of sound waves at the low end of human hearing (20 Hz) is about ; focusing them would require a dish much larger than this. A typical parabolic microphone dish with a diameter of one metre has little directivity for sound waves longer than 30 cm, corresponding to frequencies below 1 kHz. For higher frequencies, a gain of about 15 dB can be expected. But when the wavelength of the sound becomes comparable with the diameter of the parabolic dish, the response falls away.

A shotgun microphone, or a phased array of microphones, may be used as an alternative for applications requiring directional selectivity with high fidelity.

==Applications==
Typical uses of this microphone include nature sound recording such as recording bird calls, field audio for sports broadcasting, and eavesdropping on conversations, for example in espionage and law enforcement. Parabolic microphones were used in many parts of the world as early as World War II, especially by the Japanese.

Parabolic microphones are also used by search and rescue teams to locate lost people in wilderness environments. This application is supported by a study comparing parabolic microphones to unaided hearing in detecting and comprehending calling subjects at distances out to 2500 meters.

<text>A role (also rôle or social role) is a set of connected behaviors, rights, obligations, beliefs, and norms as conceptualized by people in a social situation. It is an 
expected or free or continuously changing behavior and may have a given individual social status or social position. It is vital to both functionalist and interactionist understandings of society. Social role theory posits the following about social behavior:

# The division of labour in society takes the form of the interaction among heterogeneous specialized positions, we call roles.
# Social roles included appropriate and permitted forms of behavior and actions that recur in a group, guided by social norms, which are commonly known and hence determine the expectations for appropriate behavior in these roles, which further explains the position of a person in the society.
# Roles are occupied by individuals, who are called actors. 
#When individuals approve of a social role (i.e., they consider the role legitimate and constructive), they will incur costs to conform to role norms, and will also incur costs to punish those who violate role norms.
# Changed conditions can render a social role outdated or illegitimate, in which case social pressures are likely to lead to role change.
# The anticipation of rewards and punishments, as well as the satisfaction of behaving pro-socially, account for why agents conform to role requirements.

The notion of the role can be and is examined in the social sciences, specifically economics, sociology and organizational theory.

== Definition ==
Stanley Wasserman and Katherine Faust cautioned that &quot;there is considerable disagreement among social scientists about the definitions of the related concepts of social position, social status, and social role.&quot; They note that while many scholars differentiate those terms, they can define those terms in a way that clashes with the definitions of another scholar; for example they state that &quot;[Ralph] Linton uses the term &#x27;status&#x27; in a way that is identical to our use of the term &#x27;position&#x27;&quot;.

==Determinants and characteristics==
Roles may be achieved or ascribed or they can be accidental in different situations. An &quot;achieved role&quot; is a position that a person assumes voluntarily which reflects personal skills, abilities, and effort. An &quot;ascribed role&quot; is a position assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control, and is usually forced upon a person.

Roles can be semi-permanent (&quot;doctor&quot;, &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;child&quot;), or they can be transitory. A well-known example is the &quot;sick role&quot; as formulated by Talcott Parsons in the late 1940s. In the transitory &quot;sick role&quot;, a person is exempted from their usual roles, but is expected to conform to transitory behavioral standards, such as following doctors&#x27; orders and trying to recover.

For many roles, individuals must meet certain conditions, biological or sociological. For instance, a boy cannot ordinarily take the biological role of mother. Other roles require training or experience. For instance, in many cultures doctors must be educated and certified before practicing medicine.

Role development can be influenced by a number of additional factors, including social, genetic predisposition, cultural or situational.
*Societal influence: The structure of society often forms individuals into certain roles based on the social situations they choose to experience. Parents enrolling their children in certain programs at a young age increases the chance that the child will follow that role.
*Genetic predisposition: People take on roles that come naturally to them. Those with athletic ability generally take on roles of athletes. Those with mental genius often take on roles devoted to education and knowledge. This does not mean that people must choose only one path, each individual can reprise multiple roles (i.e. Evelyn can be the point guard on the basketball team and the editor of her school newspaper).
*Cultural influence: Different cultures place different values on certain roles based on their lifestyle. For instance, soccer players are regarded higher in European countries than in the United States, where soccer is less popular.
*Situational influence: Roles can be created or altered based on the situation a person is put in outside their own influence. An example of this is students blaming failure on situational factors like &quot;the test wasn&#x27;t fair&quot; and this effects their role as a student.

Roles are also frequently interconnected in a role set, that complement of role-relationships in which persons are involved by virtue of occupying a particular social status. For example, a high school football player carries the roles of student, athlete, classmate, etc. Another example of a role is &quot;an individual in the role of a parent is expected to care for their child and protect them from harm&quot;.

== Role theory ==

Role theory is the sociological study of role development, concerned with explaining what forces cause people to develop the expectations of their own and others&#x27; behaviors. According to sociologist Bruce Biddle (1986), the five major models of role theory include:
#Functional Role Theory, which examines role development as shared social norms for a given social position. These social positions may include leadership.
#Symbolic Interactionist Role Theory, which examines role development as the outcome of individual interpretation of responses to behavior,
#Structural Role Theory, which emphasises the influence of society rather than the individual in roles and utilizes mathematical models,
#Organizational Role Theory, which examines role development in organizations, and
#Cognitive Role Theory, which is summarized by Flynn and Lemay as &quot;the relationship between expectations and behaviors&quot;

===Role in functionalist and consensus theory===
The functionalist approach to role theory, which is largely borrowed from anthropology, sees a &quot;role&quot; as the set of expectations that society places on an individual. By unspoken consensus, certain behaviors are deemed &quot;appropriate&quot; and others &quot;inappropriate&quot;. For example, an appropriate doctor dresses fairly conservatively, asks a series of personal questions about one&#x27;s health, touches one in ways that would normally be forbidden, writes prescriptions, and shows more concern for the personal wellbeing of his or her clients than is expected of, say, an electrician or a shopkeeper.

&quot;Role&quot; is what the doctor &quot;does&quot; (or, at least, is expected to do) while status is what the doctor &quot;is; &quot;in other words, &quot;status&quot; is the position an actor occupies, while &quot;role&quot; is the expected behavior attached to that position. Roles are not limited to occupational status, of course, nor does the fact that one is cast in the role of &quot;doctor&quot; during working hours prevent one from taking on other roles at other times: spouse, friend, parent, and so on.

===Role in interactionist or social action theory===
In interactionist social theory, the concept of role is crucial. The interactionist definition of &quot;role&quot; pre-dates the functionalist one. A role, in this conception, is not fixed or prescribed but something that is constantly negotiated between individuals in a tentative, creative way. Philosopher George Herbert Mead explored roles in his seminal 1934 work, &quot;Mind, self and society&quot;. Mead&#x27;s main interest was the way in which children learn how to become a part of society by imaginative &quot;role-taking&quot;, observing and mimicking others. This is always done in an interactive way: it&#x27;s not meaningful to think of a role for one person alone, only for that person as an individual who is both co-operating and competing with others. Adults behave similarly: taking roles from those that they see around them, adapting them in creative ways, and (by the process of social interaction) testing them and either confirming them or modifying them. This can be most easily seen in encounters where there is considerable ambiguity, but is nevertheless something that is part of all social interactions: each individual actively tries to &quot;define the situation&quot; (understand their role within it); choose a role that is advantageous or appealing; play that role; and persuade others to support the role.

===Social norms theory===
Social norms theory states that much of people&#x27;s behavior is influenced by their perception of how other members of their social group behave. When individuals are in a state of deindividuation, they see themselves only in terms of group identity, and their behavior is likely to be guided by group norms alone. But while group norms have a powerful effect on behavior, they can only guide behavior when they are activated by obvious reminders or by subtle cues. People adhere to social norms through enforcement, internalization, the sharing of norms by other group members, and frequent activation. Norms can be enforced through punishment or reward. Individuals are rewarded for living up to their roles (i.e. students getting an &quot;A&quot; on their exam) or punished for not completing the duties of their role (i.e. a salesperson is fired for not selling enough product).

Social norm theory has been applied as an environmental approach, with an aim of influencing individuals by manipulating their social and cultural environments. It has been widely applied using social marketing techniques. Normative messages are designed for delivery using various media and promotional strategies in order to effectively reach a target population. Social norms theory has also been successfully applied through strategies such as curriculum infusion, creating press coverage, policy development, and small group inventions.

====The theory of planned behavior====
People display reactance by fighting against threats to their freedom of action when they find norms inappropriate. Attitudes and norms typically work together to influence behavior (directly or indirectly). The theory of planned behavior intentions are a function of three factors: attitudes about the behavior, social norms relevant to the behavior, and perceptions of control over the behavior. When attitudes and norms disagree, their influence on behaviour will depend on their relative accessibility.

====Team role theory====
As described in &quot;Working in Groups&quot; by Engleberg and Wynn, team role theory is when &quot;members assume roles that are compatible with their personal characteristics and skills&quot;. Meredith Belbin, a psychologist, first explored the concept of team-role theory in the 1970s when he and his research team went about observing teams and wanted to find out what made teams work and what did not. According to Belbin and his research team &quot;the research revealed that the difference between success and failure for a team was not dependent on factors such as intellect, but more on behavior&quot;. They began to identify separate clusters of behaviors and found that behavior was more influential on a team than anything else. These separate clusters of behaviors are known as the &quot;Team Roles&quot;. The nine &quot;team roles&quot; are as follows: coordinator/chairperson, shaper, innovator, resource investigator, monitor/evaluator, implementer, teamworker, completer/finisher, and specialist.

== Role conflict ==
There are situations where the prescribed sets of behavior that characterise roles may lead to cognitive dissonance in individuals. Role conflict is a special form of social conflict that takes place when one is forced to take on two different and incompatible roles at the same time. An example of role conflict is a father, who is a baseball coach, that is torn between his role as a father by wanting to let his son be the pitcher and his role as a coach who should let the more experienced pitcher play. 

== Role confusion ==
Role confusion occurs in a situation where an individual has trouble determining which role he or she should play, but where the roles are not necessarily incompatible. For example, if a college student attending a social function encounters his teacher as a fellow guest, he will have to determine whether to relate to the teacher as a student or a peer.

== Role enhancement ==
Role enhancement or &quot;role enrichment&quot; refers to a situation in which roles which are held by a person are compatible and moreover enacting one role has beneficial spillover effects on the enactment of the other role. An example of role enhancement is a nurse who assists a patient in improving relationships by &quot;clarifying and supplementing specific role behaviors&quot;. Some evidence indicates that role conflict and role enhancement can occur simultaneously, and further evidence suggests that mental health correlates with low role conflict and high role enhancement. Also certain personality traits, in particular traits linked to perceiving and seeking greater levels of support, are associated with lower inter-role conflict and increase inter-role enrichment.

== Role strain ==
Role strain is &quot;the incompatibility among roles corresponding to a single status&quot;. An example of role strain is &quot;a student who is torn between the obligations of school, their parents, and their job&quot;. This is role strain because the status of being a student comes with multiple responsibilities that make it difficult to handle all at the same time.

== Gender roles ==

Gender roles are &quot;sets of behavioral norms assumed to accompany one&#x27;s status as male or female&quot;. Gender roles are &quot;one of the most popular strains of thought to evolve from role theory&quot; because it can be applied to one&#x27;s status as a male or female in everyday life. It has been argued that gender &quot;constitutes as a master status&quot; because the status of gender holds a power in society. An example of gender role is baby boys being associated with the color blue and baby girls being associated with the color pink. As people get older, women are traditionally assigned the role of being a stay at home mother and men are assigned the role of being the breadwinner of the family.

<text>The Dam Busters is a 1955 British epic docudrama war film starring Richard Todd and Michael Redgrave, that was directed by Michael Anderson. Adapted by R. C. Sherriff from the books &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1951) by Paul Brickhill and &quot;Enemy Coast Ahead&quot; (1946) by Guy Gibson, the film depicts the true story of Operation Chastise when in 1943 the RAF&#x27;s 617 Squadron attacked the Möhne, Eder, and Sorpe dams in Nazi Germany with Barnes Wallis&#x27;s &quot;bouncing bomb&quot;.

&quot;The Dam Busters&quot; was acclaimed by critics, who widely praised its acting (especially Todd&#x27;s and Redgrave&#x27;s), Anderson&#x27;s direction, its superlative special effects photography by Gilbert Taylor and soundtrack score by Eric Coates (especially the stirring &quot;The Dam Busters March&quot; theme tune). The film was Britain&#x27;s biggest box-office success of 1955. A much-loved British classic, &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; has since been cited as one of the best British war films and one of the greatest films of the 20th century. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; the 68th greatest British film of the 20th century. Its depiction of the raid, along with a similar sequence in the film &quot;633 Squadron&quot;, provided the inspiration for the Death Star trench run in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

A remake has been in development since 2008, but has yet to be produced .

==Plot==

In Spring 1942, aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis is struggling to develop a means of attacking Germany&#x27;s dams in the hope of crippling German heavy industry. Working for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, as well as his own job at Vickers, he works feverishly to make practical his theory of a bouncing bomb which would skip over the water to avoid protective torpedo nets. When it hit the dam, backspin would make it sink whilst retaining contact with the wall, making the explosion far more destructive. Wallis calculates that the aircraft will have to fly extremely low () to enable the bombs to skip over the water correctly, but when he takes his conclusions to the Ministry, he is told that lack of production capacity means they cannot go ahead with his proposals. Frustrated, Wallis secures an interview with Sir Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris, the head of RAF Bomber Command, who at first is reluctant to take the idea seriously. Eventually, however, he is convinced and takes the idea to the Prime Minister, who authorises the project.

Bomber Command forms a special squadron of Lancaster bombers, 617 Squadron, to be commanded by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, and tasked to fly the mission. He recruits experienced crews, especially those with low-altitude flight experience. While they train for the mission, Wallis continues his development of the bomb but has problems, such as the bomb breaking apart upon hitting the water. This requires the drop altitude to be reduced to . With only a few weeks to go, he is ultimately successful in fixing the problems as the dateline for the mission approaches.

On May 16, 1943, the bombers attack the Ruhr Dams. Eight Lancasters and 56 men are lost, but the Möhne and Edersee dams are breached, causing catastrophic flooding. Wallis is deeply affected by the loss of the crewmen, but Gibson stresses the squadron knew the risks they were facing but they went in nevertheless. Wallis asks if Gibson will get some sleep; Gibson says that he has to write letters first to the dead airmen&#x27;s next of kin.

* The film featured several actors who would go on to be stars of cinema and TV. Robert Shaw was featured as Gibson&#x27;s engineer Flt Sgt Pulford. Anderson was struggling to find an actor who psychically resembled Pulford until he went to lunch with Redgrave and Shaw, who was one of his theatre friends; Anderson was impressed by the resemblance and Redgrave confirmed to Anderson that Shaw was an actor. The film was Shaw&#x27;s first major film role. George Baker played Flt Lt Maltby. Charles Foster, nephew of Dambuster pilot David Maltby, said his family formed a bond with Baker. Patrick McGoohan had a bit part as a security guard, standing guard outside the briefing room. He delivered the line—&quot;Sorry, old boy, it&#x27;s secret—you can&#x27;t go in. Now, c&#x27;mon, hop it!&quot;, which was cut from some prints of the film. McGoohan and Nigel Stock, a co-star in the film, both played Number Six in &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1967–1968). Richard Thorp played Sqn Ldr Maudslay.

==Development==
Director Howard Hawks had wanted to make a film about the raid and had hired Roald Dahl to write the script. Bomber Command and Barnes Wallis were reluctant to reveal secrets to a Hollywood studio and the script was disliked by them. 

By the late 1940s, rumours were that Hollywood were developing a project on the Dam Busters raid and Sir Michael Balcon was in discussion to make a film of the raid with Ealing Studios; neither project came to fruition. 

Following the success of the 1951 book &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (a RAF-approved history of 617 Squadron), Robert Clark the head of production at Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) approached its author Paul Brickhill about acquiring the film rights as a vehicle for Richard Todd. (Todd says this was suggested by Felix Gotfurt, an executive at Associated British.) The company&#x27;s production manager was, however, of the opinion that, due to its numerous personnel and raids, it would not be able to film the book in its entirety. As a result, Clark requested that Brickhill provide a film treatment which described his vision for the film. Brickhill agreed to do it without payment in the hope of selling the film rights. To assist him, Clark teamed him up with Walter Mycroft who was the company&#x27;s director of production. Brickhill decided to concentrate the film treatment on Operation Chastise and ignore the later raids. The film also took inspiration from the account &quot;Enemy Coast Ahead&quot; by Guy Gibson.

After the Air Ministry agreed to make available four Lancaster bombers at a cheap price which helped make the production viable, Associated British decided to proceed with the film and agreed with Brickhill on the film rights in December 1952 for what is believed to have been £5,000. After considering C.S. Forester, Terence Rattigan, as well as Emlyn Williams and Leslie Arliss, R. C. Sherriff was selected as the screenwriter with planned August delivery of the screenplay. Sherriff agreed with Brickhill&#x27;s opinion that the film needed to concentrate on Operation Chastise and exclude the later operations covered in the book.

In preparation for writing the script, Sherriff met with Barnes Wallis at his home, later returning accompanied by Brickhill, Walter Mycroft and production supervisor W.A. &quot;Bill&quot; Whittaker on 22 March 1952 to witness Wallis demonstrating his original home experiment. To Wallis&#x27;s embarrassment he couldn&#x27;t get it to work, no matter how many times he tried.

Just prior to the film&#x27;s scheduled release, Guy Gibson&#x27;s widow Eve took legal action to prevent it, and Brickhill and Clark were mired in months of wrangling with her until references to her husband&#x27;s book &quot;Enemy Coast Ahead&quot; were included.

Real-life participants advised Anderson on the events; the RAF gave their blessing to the production, and Group Captain Charles Whitworth became technical advisor and gave Anderson all the support he needed. Barnes Wallis read the script too and gave his full approval, wanting to ensure the film was as accurate as possible. Anderson cast actors who resembled their real-life counterparts. Richard Todd had a striking physical resemblance to Guy Gibson. Makeup was used to make Michael Redgrave resemble Barnes Wallis. Baker stated that he was chosen for the part due to his physical similarity to Maltby.

==Production==
Anderson made the choice to shoot the film in black and white to allow the integration of original footage of the bomb trails, to boast a &quot;gritty&quot; documentary-style reality.

The flight sequences of the film were shot using real Avro Lancaster bombers supplied by the RAF. The aircraft, four of the final production B.VIIs, had to be taken out of storage and specially modified by removing the mid-upper gun turrets to mimic 617 Squadron&#x27;s special aircraft, and cost £130 per hour to run, which amounted to a tenth of the film&#x27;s costs. A number of Avro Lincoln bombers were also used as &quot;set dressing&quot;. (An American cut was made more dramatic by depicting an aircraft flying into a hill and exploding. This version used stock footage from Warner Bros. of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, not a Lancaster.)

The German anti-aircraft personnel were played by the 247 (Ulster) LAA Regiment, part of the 3rd (Ulster) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery, and was filmed at Stiffkey in north Norfolk.

Weybridge railway station was filmed for scenes, as Wallis had lived nearby.

Filming began at Scampton on Tuesday 27 April 1954 for ten days.

The Upper Derwent Valley in Derbyshire (the test area for the real raids) doubled as the Ruhr valley for the film. The scene where the Dutch coast is crossed was filmed between Boston, Lincolnshire, and King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, and other coastal scenes near Skegness.

Filming at Gibraltar Point began on Wednesday 21 April 1954, for four days. Appearing as an extra, on the beach, as an Air Commodore was Mr E Taylor, a teacher from Skegness Grammar School. Mr Taylor had been an intelligence officer at RAF Woodhall Spa. Other extras came from the Skegness Players.

The scene where they fly along a canal was filmed on the Dutch river (local nickname for the canal) on the way to Goole which is on the M62 to Hull. As the planes turn across country you can see Goole fully as they turn. This was used as the area around Goole is perfectly flat. Additional aerial footage was shot above Windermere, in the Lake District.
While RAF Scampton, where the real raid launched, was used for some scenes, the principal airfield used for ground location shooting was RAF Hemswell, a few miles north and still an operational RAF station at the time of filming. Guy Gibson had been based at Hemswell in his final posting and the airfield had been an operational Avro Lancaster base during the war. At the time filming took place it was then home to No. 109 Squadron and No. 139 Squadron RAF, which were both operating English Electric Canberras on electronic countermeasures and nuclear air sampling missions over hydrogen bomb test sites in the Pacific and Australia. However, part of the RAF&#x27;s fleet of ageing Avro Lincolns had been mothballed at Hemswell prior to being broken up and several of these static aircraft appeared in background shots during filming, doubling for additional No 617 Squadron Lancasters. The station headquarters building still stands on what is now an industrial estate and is named Gibson House. The four wartime hangars also still stand, little changed in external appearance since the war.

The former operations briefing room at Scampton, where scenes were filmed, was now the NCO mess. On the set, a survivor of the raid, David Shannon, said &#x27;I think altogether, too much has been made of this raid. To us, it was just another operation&#x27;

Serving RAF pilots from both squadrons based at Hemswell took turns flying the Lancasters during filming and found the close formation and low level flying around Derwentwater and Windermere exhilarating and a welcome change from their normal high level solo Canberra sorties. While filming on one of the first days with the Lancasters, a Lancaster&#x27;s tail wheel caught the roof of a nearby hanger, to the chagrin of a control tower officer. The Mosquito in the film was flown by Flying Officer Leslie Brown of Verena Terrace in Perth; he had been at Dunkirk with the 51st (Highland) Division, then joined the RAF and was shot down in north Africa, being an Italian prisoner of war for three years. Two of the Lancaster pilots were Fl Lt KP Souter and Flt Lt WD Caldwell.

Three of the four Lancaster bombers used in the film had also appeared in the Dirk Bogarde film &quot;Appointment in London&quot; two years earlier.

The theatre scene showing the spotlights was filmed at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith. The dance troupe was &quot;The Television Toppers&quot;, on loan for one day filming, under contract from the BBC. The singer was June Powell, she sings the 1942 song &quot;Sing Everybody Sing&quot; by John P Long. Scenes were filmed at the Chelsea Palace on Sydney Street.

Richard Todd described filming the final scene with Michael Redgrave, where Gibson says he has to write letters, saying that as he walked away from the camera he was quietly weeping. He had his own experience of letter writing. He also said that the dog, also named Nigger, refused to go near the spot where the real Nigger was buried.

Five photographs of Labrador dogs from a site at Melton Mowbray were sent to the film studios, and a mine-tracking dog was chosen, looked after by handler Lance Corporal Peter Reid of Ainslie Gardens in Perth, Scotland.

The black Labrador had never lived in a house before, and Richard Todd took the dog back to the White Hart Hotel in Lincoln, where the dog slept in the bathroom. Richard wanted to keep the dog, but the RAF would not let him.

===Soundtrack===

&quot;The Dam Busters March&quot;, by Eric Coates, is for many synonymous with the film, as well as with the exploit itself, and remains a favourite military band item at flypasts and in the concert hall.

Other than the introduction and trio section theme, the majority of the march as performed is not featured in the film soundtrack. Coates himself avoided writing music for the cinema, remembering the experiences of his fellow composer Arthur Bliss. Coates only agreed to provide an overture for the film after he was persuaded by the film&#x27;s producers it was of &quot;national importance&quot; and pressure was put on him via his publisher, Chappell. A march he had recently completed was found to fit well with the heroic subject and was thus submitted. The majority of the soundtrack including the theme played during the raid sequence in the film was composed by Leighton Lucas.

Philip Lane, who reconstructed parts of Leighton Lucas&#x27;s orchestral score (which had been lost) notes that Lucas created his own main theme &quot;which seems to play hide and seek with Coates&#x27;s throughout the film, both vying for supremacy.&quot;

==Historical accuracy==

The film is largely historically accurate, with only a small number of changes made for reasons of dramatic licence. Some errors derive from Paul Brickhill&#x27;s book, which was written when much detail about the raid was not yet in the public domain.
* Barnes Wallis said that he never encountered any opposition from bureaucracy. In the film, when a reluctant official asks what he can possibly say to the RAF to persuade them to lend a Vickers Wellington bomber for flight testing the bomb, Wallis suggests: &quot;Well, if you told them that I designed it, do you think that might help?&quot; Barnes Wallis was heavily involved with the design of the Wellington, as it used his geodetic airframe construction method, though he was not actually its chief designer.
* Instead of all of Gibson&#x27;s tour-expired crew at 106 Squadron volunteering to follow him to his new command, only his wireless operator, Hutchinson, went with him to 617 Squadron.
* Rather than the purpose as well as the method of the raid being Wallis&#x27;s sole idea, the dams had already been identified as an important target by the Air Ministry before the war.
* Gibson did not devise the &quot;spotlights altimeter&quot; after visiting a theatre; it was suggested by Benjamin Lockspeiser of the Ministry of Aircraft Production after Gibson requested they solve the problem. It was a proven method used by RAF Coastal Command aircraft for some time.
* The wooden &quot;coat hanger&quot; bomb sight intended to enable crews to release the weapon at the right distance from the target was not wholly successful; some crews used it, but others came up with their own solutions, such as pieces of string in the bomb-aimer&#x27;s position and/or markings on the blister.
* Gibson&#x27;s dog, Nigger, is depicted being killed on the day of the raid; Nigger actually died the day before. The correct name of the dog is frequently changed in television reruns of the film when it is broadcast.
* No bomber flew into a hillside near a target on the actual raid. This scene, which is not in the original version, was included in the copy released on the North American market (see above). Three bombers are brought down by enemy fire and two crashed due to hitting power lines in the valleys.
* Some of the sequences showing the testing of Upkeep—the code name for the weapon—in the film are of Mosquito fighter-bombers dropping the naval version of the bouncing bomb, code-named &quot;Highball&quot;, intended to be used against ships. This version of the weapon was never used operationally.
* At the time the film was made, certain aspects of Upkeep were still held classified, so the actual test footage was censored to hide any details of the test bombs (a black dot was superimposed over the bomb on each frame), and the dummy bombs carried by the Lancasters were almost spherical but with flat sides rather than the true cylindrical shape.
* The dummy bomb did not show the mechanism which created the back spin.
* Ammunition shown being loaded into a Lancaster is .50 calibre for M2 Browning heavy machine guns, not that for the .303 calibre machine guns found on the Lancaster in 1943.
* The scenes of the attack on the Eder Dam show a castle resembling Schloss Waldeck on the wrong side of the lake and dam. The position and angle of the lake in relation to the castle suggest that in reality the bombing-run would have needed a downhill approach to the west of the castle.
* Wallis states that his idea came from Nelson&#x27;s bouncing cannonballs into the sides of enemy ships. (He also states that Nelson sank one ship during the Battle of the Nile with a &quot;yorker&quot;, a cricket term for a ball that bounces under the bat, making it difficult to play.) There is no evidence for this claim. In a 1942 paper, Wallis mentioned the bouncing of cannonballs in the 16th and 17th centuries, but Nelson was not mentioned.
* In the film Wallis (Redgrave) tells Gibson and Young that a mechanical problem with the release gear has been solved as the engineers had the correct oil in store. This is false; there was a technical problem which was solved by Sgt Charles Sackville-Bryant, who was awarded the BEM for this.

==Release==
Around twenty survivors of the raid, attended a dinner on Saturday 14 May at the Criterion Restaurant. Five Canadian survivors, had flown into RAF Langar, in Nottinghamshire, on the morning of Friday 13 May.

&quot;The Dambusters&quot; received a Royal world premiere at the Empire, Leicester Square on 16 May 1955, the twelfth anniversary of the raid. Princess Margaret attended along with Eve Gibson, Guy Gibson&#x27;s widow and his father. Richard Todd, Barnes Wallis and his wife and the surviving members of 617 Squadron who had taken part in the mission were all guests of honour. Fifteen survivors attended the premiere, and eleven next of kin, of those who did not return. Of the survivors attending, the only prisoner of war of the raid, 33 year old Australian Flt Lt Tony Burcher, rear gunner of &quot;AJ-M&quot;, the second to attack, could re-witness his aircraft being hit by a Bofors gun between the two towers; he broke his back, when it caught the aircraft tailplane, on exit. He lay in a culvert for five days, and was caught when crawling across a road. He said &#x27;we dropped our mine, and suddenly we were on fire&#x27;.

The premiere helped to raise money and awareness for various RAF charities.

The film was first shown on British television on 30 May 1971.

==Reception==
===Critical===
Reviews upon its release were positive. &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as having great attention to detail.

Over time, the film&#x27;s reputation has grown and is now regarded as a beloved classic of British cinema. The British Film Institute placed &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; as the 68th greatest British film. In 2004, the magazine &quot;Total Film&quot; named &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; the 43rd greatest British film of all time. In a 2015 review, &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; remains very well made and entertaining. The film holds a 100% rating with an average rating of 7.9/10 on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 11 reviews. David Parkinson of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film three out of five, describing the film as &quot;patriotic and spirit-lifting&quot;. A review commented, &quot;It is testament to Anderson&#x27;s authoritative, quiet guidance that the performances are largely realistic, and multi-dimensional.&quot;

Richard Todd considered the film as one of his favourites of all those that he appeared in, and went on to appear at many Dambusters-themed events.

===Awards===
The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Special Effects, and was also nominated for BAFTA awards for Best British Film, Best Screenplay and Best Film From Any Source.

===Box office===
The film was the most successful film at the British box office in 1955 but performed poorly at the US box office, like most British war movies of this era.

According to Richard Todd in 1993, a resident of Little Ponton, the film was not a success in the US, as audiences were not informed that it was a true story. If audiences knew that it was a true story, Todd thought it would have been a great success. Audiences in the US in 1955, however, thought that to hit a dam with a bomb that bounced was total fiction.

==Legacy==
Director George Lucas hired Gilbert Taylor, responsible for special effects photography on &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;, to be the director of photography for the film &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The attack on the Death Star in the climax of &quot;Star Wars&quot; is a deliberate and acknowledged homage to the climactic sequence of &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;. In the former film, rebel pilots have to fly through a trench while evading enemy fire and fire a proton torpedo at a precise distance from the target to destroy the entire base with a single explosion; if one run fails, another run must be made by a different pilot. In addition to the similarity of the scenes, some of the dialogue is nearly identical. &quot;Star Wars&quot; also ends with an Elgarian march, like &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;. The same may be said of &quot;633 Squadron&quot;, in which a squadron of de Havilland Mosquitos must drop a bomb on a rock overhanging a key German factory at the end of a Norwegian fjord.

On 16 May 2008, a commemoration of the 65th anniversary was held at Derwent Reservoir, including a flypast by a Lancaster, Spitfire, and Hurricane. The event was attended by actor Richard Todd, representing the film crew and Les Munro, the last surviving pilot from the original raid, as well as Mary Stopes-Roe, the elder daughter of Sir Barnes Wallis.

On 17 May 2018, a commemoration of the 75th anniversary was held, in which a restored version of the film was broadcast live from the Royal Albert Hall, and hosted by Dan Snow. The film was simulcast into over 300 cinemas nationwide.

== Censorship ==
Gibson&#x27;s black Labrador, Nigger, whose name was used as a single codeword whose transmission conveyed that the Möhne Dam had been breached, is portrayed in several scenes; his name and the codeword are mentioned fourteen times. Some of these scenes were sampled in the film &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot; (1982).

In 1999, British television network ITV broadcast a censored version of the film, removing all utterances of &quot;Nigger&quot;. ITV blamed regional broadcaster London Weekend Television, which in turn alleged that a junior staff member had been responsible for the unauthorised cuts. When ITV again showed a censored version in June 2001, it was condemned by the &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; as &quot;unnecessary and ridiculous&quot; and because the edits introduced continuity errors. The code word &quot;nigger&quot; transmitted in Morse code upon the successful completion of the central mission was not censored.

Some edited American versions of the film have used dubbing to change Nigger&#x27;s name to &quot;Trigger&quot;. The British Channel 4 screened a censored American version in July 2007, this screening took place just after the planned remake was announced. In September 2007, as part of the BBC Summer of British Film series, &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; was shown at selected cinemas across the UK in its uncut format. In 2012, ITV3 showed the film uncut a few times, but with a warning at the start that it contains racial terms from the period which some people may find offensive. The original, uncensored, version was also shown on 1 and 5 January 2013, by Channel 5 without any warning. It was the version, distributed by StudioCanal, containing shots of the bomber flying into a hill. On 17 May 2018, an uncut version was shown on the UK channel Film4 with a warning explaining the film was historical and that some would find it to be racially offensive; &quot;While we acknowledge some of the language used in &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; reflects historical attitudes which audiences may find offensive, for reasons of historical accuracy we have opted to present the film as it was originally screened&quot;. The film was also shown uncut in cinemas.

Since 2020, following the George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom, Film4 has broadcast an edited version, re-dubbed in a few places, where the dog&#x27;s name is removed, addressed as &quot;old boy&quot; or referred to as &quot;my dog&quot;, although the warning is retained at the start. Channel 5 airs a dubbed version with the dog being called &quot;Trigger&quot;, with no warning shown at the start.

In his book, journalist Sir Max Hastings said that he was repeatedly asked whether it is an embarrassment to acknowledge Nigger&#x27;s name, and stated that &quot;a historian&#x27;s answer must be: no more than the fact that our ancestors hanged sheep-stealers, executed military deserters and imprisoned homosexuals. They did and said things differently then. It would be grotesque to omit Nigger from a factual narrative merely because the word is rightly repugnant to twenty-first-century ears.&quot;

==Planned remake==
Work on a remake of &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;, produced by Peter Jackson and directed by Christian Rivers, began in 2008, based around a screenplay by Stephen Fry. Jackson said in the mid-1990s that he became interested in remaking the 1955 film, but found that the rights had been bought by Mel Gibson. In 2004, Jackson was contacted by his agent, who said Gibson had dropped the rights. In 2005, the rights were purchased by Sir David Frost, from the Brickhill family. Stephen Fry wrote the script.

In 2007, it was announced it would be distributed by Universal Pictures in North America, and StudioCanal, the corporate heir to ABPC, in the rest of the world. Filming was planned to commence in 2009, on a budget of US$40 million, although no project-specific filming began. The project was delayed because Jackson decided to make &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

Weta Workshop was making the models and special effects for the film and had made 10 life-size Lancaster bombers. Fry said Wing Commander Guy Gibson&#x27;s dog &quot;Nigger&quot; will be called &quot;Digger&quot; in the remake to avoid rekindled controversy over the original name. For the remake, Peter Jackson has said no decision has been made on the dog&#x27;s name, but is in a &quot;no-win, damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don&#x27;t scenario&quot;, as changing the name could be seen as too much political correctness, while not changing the name could offend people. Further, executive producer Sir David Frost was quoted in &quot;The Independent&quot; as stating: &quot;Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, so I think that&#x27;s what we will call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this is the one I want.&quot; Les Munro, a pilot in the strike team, joined the production crew in Masterton as technical advisor. Jackson was also to use newly declassified War Office documents to ensure the authenticity of the film.

After Munro died in 2015, Phil Bonner of the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre said he still thought Jackson will eventually make the film, citing Jackson&#x27;s passion for aviation. Jackson said, &quot;There is only a limited span I can abide, of people driving me nuts asking me when I&#x27;m going to do that project. So I&#x27;ll have to do it. I want to, actually, it&#x27;s one of the truly great true stories of the Second World War, a wonderful, wonderful story.&quot;

In 2018, news emerged that Jackson was to begin production on the film once again. He intended for production to commence soon, as he only had the film rights for &quot;another year or two&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1982 film &quot;Pink Floyd The Wall&quot;, scenes from &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; can be seen and heard playing on a television set several times during the film. Particular emphasis is placed on scenes in the film where characters mention Nigger, Guy Gibson&#x27;s Labrador. &quot;The reason that &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; is in the film version of &quot;The Wall&quot;,&quot; explained the Floyd&#x27;s Roger Waters, &quot;is because I&#x27;m from that generation who grew up in postwar Britain, and all those movies were very important to us. &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; was my favourite of all of them. It&#x27;s so stuffed with great characters.&quot; Waters had previously introduced the band&#x27;s song &#x27;Echoes&#x27; at live shows as &#x27;March of the Dam Busters&#x27;.
* The 1973 film &quot;The Goodies and the Beanstalk&quot; incorporates a scene where the eponymous heroes take cover and are attacked by geese dropping golden eggs. To the Dambusters March tune, one of the eggs bounces several times before exploding against the wall behind which they have hidden.
* The 1984 video game &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; was partially based on the film.
* Two television advertisements were made for a brand of beer, Carling Black Label, which played on the theme of &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;. Both were made before the English football team broke a 35-year losing streak against Germany. The first showed a German guard on top of a dam catching a number of bouncing bombs as if he were a goalkeeper. The second showed a British tourist throwing a Union Flag towel which skipped off the water like a bouncing bomb to reserve a pool-side seat before the German tourists could reserve them with their towels. Both actions were followed by the comment &quot;I bet he drinks Carling Black Label&quot;. The adverts were criticised by the Independent Television Commission, although UK newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; reported &quot;a spokeswoman for the German embassy in London dismissed the idea that Germans might find the commercial offensive, adding: &#x27;I find it very amusing&#x27;&quot;.

<doc id="170211" wikidata="Q2416147" url="?curid=170211" title="Rabbits in Australia">
<text>European rabbits (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) were first introduced to Australia in the 18th century with the First Fleet, and later became widespread, because of Thomas Austin. Such wild rabbit populations are a serious mammalian pest and invasive species in Australia causing millions of dollars&#x27; worth of damage to crops. Their spread may have been enhanced through the emergence of strong crossbreeds.

Various methods in the 20th century have been attempted to control the Australian rabbit population. Conventional methods include shooting rabbits and destroying their warrens, but these had only limited success. From 1901 to 1907, a rabbit-proof fence was built in Western Australia in an unsuccessful attempt to contain the rabbits. The&quot; myxoma virus&quot;, which causes myxomatosis, was introduced into the rabbit population in the 1950s and had the effect of severely reducing the rabbit population. However, the survivors have since adapted and partially recovered their previous numbers. Domesticated rabbits are banned as pets in the state of Queensland.

==History==
Rabbits were first introduced to Australia by the First Fleet in 1788. They were bred as food animals, probably in cages. In the first decades, they do not appear to have been numerous, judging from their absence from archaeological collections of early colonial food remains. However, by 1827 in Tasmania, a newspaper article noted &quot;...the common rabbit is becoming so numerous throughout the colony, that they are running about on some large estates by thousands. We understand, that there are no rabbits whatever in the elder colony&quot; i.e., New South Wales (NSW). This clearly shows a localised rabbit population explosion was underway in Tasmania in the early 19th century. At the same time in NSW, Cunningham noted, &quot;... rabbits are bred around houses, but we have yet no wild ones in enclosures...&quot; He also noted the scrubby, sandy rubble between Sydney and Botany Bay would be ideal for farming rabbits.

Enclosures appear to mean more extensive rabbit-farming warrens, rather than cages. The first of these, in Sydney at least, was one built by Alexander Macleay at Elizabeth Bay House, &quot;a preserve or rabbit-warren, surrounded by a substantial stone wall, and well stocked with that choice game.&quot; In the 1840s, rabbit-keeping became even more common, with examples of the theft of rabbits from ordinary peoples&#x27; houses appearing in court records and rabbits entering the diets of ordinary people.

In 1857–1858, Alexander Buchanan, overseer for F. H. Dutton&#x27;s Anlaby Estate in the Mid-North of South Australia, released a number of rabbits for hunting sport. Their population remained fairly stable until around 1866, presumed to have been kept in check by native carnivores and were protected by an Act of Parliament, but by 1867 was out of control. The population explosion was ascribed to the disappearance of native predators, but the emergence of a hardier breed by natural selection has subsequently been attributed to their spread.

The current infestation appears to have originated with the release of 24 wild rabbits by Thomas Austin for hunting purposes in October 1859, on his property, Barwon Park, near Winchelsea, Victoria and by 1866, the Geelong Advertiser reported 50,000 having been killed by hunters. While living in England, Austin had been an avid hunter, regularly dedicating his weekends to rabbit shooting. Upon arriving in Australia, which had no native rabbit population, Austin asked his nephew William Austin in England to send him 12 grey rabbits, five hares, 72 partridges, and some sparrows so he could continue his hobby in Australia by creating a local population of the species. At the time, he had stated, &quot;The introduction of a few rabbits could do little harm and might provide a touch of home, in addition to a spot of hunting&quot;. William could not source enough grey rabbits to meet his uncle&#x27;s order, so he topped it up by buying domestic rabbits. One theory as to why the Barwon Park rabbits adapted so well to Australia is that the hybrid rabbits that resulted from the interbreeding of the two distinct types were much more suited to Australian conditions. Many other farms released their rabbits into the wild after Austin.

The rabbits were extremely prolific and spread rapidly across the southern parts of the country. Australia had ideal conditions for a rabbit population explosion. With mild winters, rabbits were able to breed the entire year. With widespread farming, areas that might otherwise have been scrub or woodlands were, instead, turned into vast areas with low vegetation, creating ideal habitats for rabbits.

In a classic example of unintended consequences, rabbits had become so prevalent within 10 years of their introduction in 1859 that two million could be shot or trapped annually without having any noticeable effect on the population. It was the fastest spread ever recorded of any mammal anywhere in the world. Today, rabbits are entrenched in the southern and central areas of the country, with scattered populations in the northern deserts.

Although the rabbit is a notorious pest, it proved useful to many people during the depressions of the 1890s and 1930s and during wartime. Trapping rabbits helped farmers, stockmen, and stationhands by providing food and extra income, and in some cases helped pay off farming debts. Rabbits were fed to working dogs and boiled to be fed to poultry. Later, frozen rabbit carcasses were traded locally and exported. Pelts, too, were used in the fur trade and are still used in the felt-hat industry.

==Effects on Australia&#x27;s ecology==

Since their introduction from Europe in the 19th century, the effect of rabbits on the ecology of Australia has been devastating. They are suspected of being the most significant known factor in species loss in Australia. Rabbits are believed to have had an immense impact on the abundance of natural resource availability, primarily concerning overgrazing. The rabbits would first deplete the natural pasture vegetation, and would then resort to consuming woody vegetation, which included small shrubs, and the leaves and bark of trees. The extent of plant species&#x27; loss is unknown at this time, though rabbits are known to often kill young trees in orchards, forests, and on properties by ringbarking them.

Rabbits are also responsible for serious erosion problems, as they eat native plants, leaving the topsoil exposed and vulnerable to sheet, gully, and wind erosion. The removal of this topsoil is devastating to the land, as it takes many hundreds of years to regenerate.

==Control measures==
By 1887, losses from rabbit damage compelled the New South Wales government to offer a £25,000 reward, equivalent to in , for &quot;any method of success not previously known in the Colony for the effectual extermination of rabbits&quot;. The commission received 1,456 suggestions, including several schemes involving biological controls (see below), but none was found to be both safe and effective.

A Royal Commission was held to investigate the situation in 1901. Once the problem was understood, various control methods were tried to limit or reduce the population of rabbits in Australia. These methods had limited success until the introduction of biological control methods in the latter half of the 20th century.

===Common control measures===
Shooting rabbits is one of the most common control methods and can successfully be used to keep already low populations in check while providing food for people or pets, though it is ineffective for large-scale eradication.

Destroying warrens through ripping (a procedure wherein rabbits are dismembered or buried alive as a bulldozer dragging sharp tines is driven over their warrens or burrows), ploughing, blasting, and fumigating is widely used, especially on large farms (known as &quot;stations&quot;). The sandy soil in many parts of Australia makes ripping and ploughing a viable method of control, and both tractors and bulldozers are used for this operation.

Poisoning is probably the most widely used of the conventional techniques, as it requires the least effort and is capable of destroying a local population, though reinfestation given the mobility of the animal is almost inevitable. Laying baits of pollard laced with a phosphorus-based poison, such as &quot;S.A.P.&quot; manufactured by Sayers, Allport &amp; Potter, was an early method. The advantage of phosphorus is that in dry weather, assuming it has not been laid in clumps (obviated by use of a poison cart), it soon degrades to innocuous phosphoric acid and presents no further danger to livestock or pets. It does, however, present a real fire risk, and concentrated fumes can be toxic to operators.
More modern poisons for rabbit control are sodium fluoroacetate (&quot;1080&quot;) and pindone.

Another technique is hunting using ferrets, wherein ferrets are deployed to chase the rabbits out to be shot or into nets set over the burrows. Since the number of rabbits ferrets can kill is limited, this is more a hunting activity than a serious control method. Although ferrets and other mustelid species are used as control measures, Australia has significantly fewer wild mustelids to prey on the invasive rabbits while in their warrens or burrows compared to Europe and the United States.

Historically, trapping was also frequently used; steel-jawed leg-holding traps were banned in most states in the 1980s on animal-cruelty grounds, though trapping continues at a lower level using rubber-jawed traps. All of these techniques are limited to working only in settled areas and are quite labour-intensive.

===Fences===

Ring-fencing can be highly effective way of providing a rabbit-free area. In the 1880s, James Moseley ringed Coondambo Station with wire netting and fenced off the watercourses; at the first heatwave, the rabbits perished of thirst. Shortly after 1900, he fenced off the deserted Yardea, Paney, Pondana, Yarloo, and Thurlga stations in the Gawler Ranges with of wire netting, turning them within a few years from degraded land overrun with rabbits into a profitable sheep run.

Well-known modern examples, which also exclude foxes, dogs, and cats are Warrawong and Yookamurra wildlife sanctuaries, pioneered by John Wamsley.

Two well-known examples of much more extensive fences are:

====Queensland====
In July 1884, Ernest James Stevens, a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, proposed that the Queensland government erect a fence to prevent the infestation of rabbits in New South Wales from spreading into Queensland (his Logan electorate being very close to the New South Wales border).

In 1893, a rabbit-proof fence was commenced in Queensland. It was progressively extended through the years. In 1997, a final segment was built connecting it to the Dingo Fence. It extends from Mount Gipps (near Rathdowney) to Goombi between Chinchilla and Miles.

====Western Australia====
From 1901 to 1907, the rabbit-proof fence was built in Western Australia between Cape Keraudren and Esperance to try to control the spread of the rabbit population from the east into Western Australian pastoral areas. Given that European rabbits can both jump very high and burrow underground, a perfectly intact fence stretching for hundreds of kilometres, and whose gates farmers or graziers did not leave open for livestock or machinery, was still unlikely to succeed. As such, the Number 1 Rabbit-Proof Fence, which was erected in 1901, failed to keep the rabbit population away from the protected area. Even after this large scale fence had failed, smaller scale fencing projects continued to make a successful appearance.

===Biological measures===

Releasing rabbit-borne diseases has proven somewhat successful in controlling the population of rabbits in Australia, but such success as has been achieved did not occur as quickly as was hoped.

An offer by the New South Wales government of a £25,000 reward for a biological control of rabbits attracted the attention of Louis Pasteur, who proposed using the chicken cholera bacillus (now known as &quot;Pasteurella multocida&quot;). Although that measure did not prove viable, the association with Pasteur accelerated the introduction of microbiology into Australia.

On 16 April 1888, the New South Wales government appointed a royal commission &quot;to make a full and diligent inquiry as to whether or not the introduction of contagious diseases amongst rabbits by inoculation or otherwise, or the propagation of diseases natural to rabbits ... will be accompanied or followed by danger to human health or life, or to animal life other than rabbits, or to interfere injuriously with the profitable carrying on of agricultural or pastoral pursuits ...&quot; Under the aegis of the commission, tests were conducted at Rodd Island, and although rabbits who were given food adulterated with chicken cholera bacillus were killed, no evidence was found of the contagion spreading to healthy rabbits.

In 1885, Professor Archibald Watson of the University of Adelaide suggested releasing rabbits inoculated with rabbit scab into an enclosed trial area. Limited trials suggested that the measure would be ineffective in the drier parts of the continent.

In September 1887, Dr Herbert Butcher (1854–1893) of Wilcannia found a number of dead, emaciated rabbits at Tintinallogy Station. Dr H. Ellis of Sydney and he concluded that the animals had died of a novel disease, which they dubbed Tintinallogy virus. They felt it could be an effective control measure, but whatever the rabbits died from was never proved to be infectious or contagious. It may have been simple starvation caused by natural elements.

In 1906 and 1907, Jean Danysz, of the Pasteur Institute of Paris, conducted trials on Broughton Island, New South Wales, of a strain of &quot;Pasteurella&quot; bacteria he had developed, which proved to be specific to rabbits, but it proved to be a less-than-satisfactory control measure. Dr Danysz felt that Broughton Island was a poor choice of test site, and that extensive experiments should be conducted on the mainland. Frank Tidswell, who was his chief Australian collaborator, continued Danysz&#x27;s trials after he left in 1907, and also began trials of the Yalgogrin, Gundagai, and Picton microbes (named for the stations where infected rabbits were found), but financial support was lacking from the Federal government, or the collaboration of affected states, that would be necessary to prove that the measure safe and effective. The fact that these pathogens did not wipe out whole populations might have raised doubts as to their efficacy.

In 1950, following research conducted by Frank Fenner, &quot;myxoma virus&quot; was deliberately released into the rabbit population, causing it to drop from an estimated 600 million to around 100 million. Growing genetic resistance in the remaining rabbits had allowed the population to recover to 200–300 million by 1991.

To combat that trend, over three years from June 1991, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) comprehensively tested the potential of a &quot;Calicivirus&quot;, which causes rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), for biological control of wild rabbits. The virus escaped from a quarantine compound on Wardang Island, South Australia, where the field tests were being carried out, and by late October 1995, it was recorded in rabbits at Yunta and Gum Creek, in north-eastern South Australia. By the winter of 1996, the virus was established in Victoria, New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. The virus was discovered in these areas by analyzing livers of dead rabbits. The success of the virus was found to be higher in dry areas, because of a benign calicivirus found in the colder, wetter areas of Australia, which was immunising rabbits against the more virulent form.

A legal vaccine exists in Australia for RHD, but no cure is known for either myxomatosis or RHD, and many affected pets have to be euthanized. In Europe, where rabbits are farmed on a large scale, they are protected against myxomatosis and calicivirus with a genetically modified virus developed in Spain.

A team headed by virologist Francisco Parra, working with the University of Oviedo, in Asturias, northern Spain, identified a new variant of the virus in 2012. The pathogen, a new strain of K5 (RHDV1), is both extremely lethal and highly contagious. In 2017, it was released by Australian authorities at around 600 points on the continent. Owners of domestic rabbits were advised to vaccinate their animals.

In southern Europe, the scarcity of rabbits threatens the conservation of endangered predator species higher up the food chain, that depend on small game such as rabbits. These include the Iberian lynx and the Iberian imperial eagle. For this reason, biological warfare against rabbits in Australia is a serious concern for conservation activities in other parts of the world.

The cost of rabbit vaccination substantially raises the cost of rabbit meat in Australia; from 2004 to 2014, the number of farms dropped from 80 to 4, and the meat has become a rarity.

<doc id="170212" wikidata="Q210216" url="?curid=170212" title="Concerto grosso">
<text>The concerto grosso (; Italian for &quot;big concert(o)&quot;, plural &quot;concerti grossi&quot; ) is a form of baroque music in which the musical material is passed between a small group of soloists (the &quot;concertino&quot;) and full orchestra (the &quot;ripieno&quot;, &quot;tutti&quot; or &quot;concerto grosso&quot;). This is in contrast to the solo concerto which features a single solo instrument with the melody line, accompanied by the orchestra.

== History ==
The form developed in the late seventeenth century, although the name was not used at first. Alessandro Stradella seems to have written the first music in which two groups of different sizes are combined in the characteristic way. The name was first used by Giovanni Lorenzo Gregori in a set of ten compositions published in Lucca in 1698.

The first major composer to use the term &quot;concerto grosso&quot; was Arcangelo Corelli. After Corelli&#x27;s death, a collection of twelve of his &quot;concerti grossi&quot; was published. Not long after, composers such as Francesco Geminiani, Pietro Locatelli, Giovanni Benedetto Platti and Giuseppe Torelli wrote concertos in the style of Corelli. He also had a strong influence on Antonio Vivaldi.

Two distinct forms of the &quot;concerto grosso&quot; exist: 
# the &quot;concerto da chiesa&quot; (church concert) 
# the &quot;concerto da camera&quot; (chamber concert)
The &quot;concerto da chiesa&quot; alternated slow and fast movements; the &quot;concerto da camera&quot; had the character of a suite, being introduced by a prelude and incorporating popular dance forms. (See also Sonata for a discussion about sonatas &quot;da camera&quot; and &quot;da chiesa&quot;.) These distinctions blurred over time. Corelli composed 48 trio sonatas, 12 violin and continuo sonatas, and 12 concerti grossi.

Six sets of twelve compositions, published between 1888 and 1891 by Friedrich Chrysander, are authentically ascribed to Corelli, together with a few other works.
* Opus 1: 12 &quot;sonate da chiesa&quot; (trio sonatas for 2 violins and continuo) (Rome 1681)
* Opus 2: 12 &quot;sonate da camera&quot; (trio sonatas for 2 violins and continuo) (Rome 1685)
* Opus 3: 12 &quot;sonate da chiesa&quot; (trio sonatas for 2 violins and continuo) (Rome 1689)
* Opus 4: 12 &quot;sonate da camera&quot; (trio sonatas for 2 violins and continuo) (Rome 1694)
* Opus 5: 12 &quot;Suonati a violino e violone o cimbalo&quot; (6 &quot;sonate da chiesa&quot; and 6 &quot;sonate da camera&quot; for violin and continuo) (Rome 1700) The last sonata is a set of variations on &quot;La Folia&quot;.
* Opus 6: 12 concerti grossi (8 concerti da chiesa and 4 concerti da camera for concertino of 2 violins and cello, string ripieno, and continuo) (Amsterdam 1714)
Corelli&#x27;s &quot;concertino&quot; group consisted of two violins and a cello, with a string section as &quot;ripieno&quot; group. Both were accompanied by a &quot;basso continuo&quot; with some combination of harpsichord, organ, lute or theorbo. George Frideric Handel wrote several collections of &quot;concerti grossi&quot; (Op. 3 and Op. 6), and several of the &quot;Brandenburg Concertos&quot; by Johann Sebastian Bach also loosely follow the &quot;concerto grosso&quot; form.

The &quot;concerto grosso&quot; form was superseded by the solo concerto and the sinfonia concertante in the late eighteenth century, and new examples of the form did not appear for more than a century. In the twentieth century, the &quot;concerto grosso&quot; has been used by composers including Igor Stravinsky, Ernest Bloch, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Bohuslav Martinů, Malcolm Williamson, Henry Cowell, Alfred Schnittke, William Bolcom, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Andrei Eshpai, Eino Tamberg, Krzysztof Penderecki, Jean Françaix, Airat Ichmouratov, Philip Glass and Paul Ben-Haim. While Edward Elgar may be considered a modern composer, his romantic &quot;Introduction and Allegro&quot; strongly resembled the instrumentation setup of a concerto grosso.

==Concertino==
A concertino, literally &quot;little ensemble&quot;, is the group of soloists in a concerto grosso. This is opposed to the ripieno and tutti which is the larger group contrasting with the concertino.

Though the concertino is the smaller of the two groups, its material is generally more virtuosic than that of the ripieno. Further, the concertino does not share thematic material with the ripieno, but presents unique ideas. This contrast of small group to large group and one thematic group against another is very characteristic of Baroque ideology—similar to terraced dynamics where the idea is significant contrast.

<text>A stepper motor, also known as step motor or stepping motor, is a brushless DC electric motor that rotates in a series of small and discrete angular steps. Stepper motors can be set to any given step position without needing a position sensor for feedback. The step position can be rapidly increased or decreased to create continuous rotation, or the motor can be ordered to actively hold its position at one given step. Motors vary in size, speed, step resolution, and torque.

Switched reluctance motors are very large stepping motors with a reduced pole count. They generally employ closed-loop commutators.

==Mechanism==
Brushed DC motors rotate continuously when DC voltage is applied to their terminals. The stepper motor is known for its property of converting a train of input pulses (typically square waves) into a precisely defined increment in the shaft’s rotational position. Each pulse rotates the shaft through a fixed angle.

Stepper motors effectively have multiple &quot;toothed&quot; electromagnets arranged as a stator around a central rotor, a gear-shaped piece of iron. The electromagnets are energized by an external driver circuit or a micro controller. To make the motor shaft turn, one electromagnet is first given power, which magnetically attracts the gear&#x27;s teeth. When the gear&#x27;s teeth are aligned to the first electromagnet, they are slightly offset from the next electromagnet. This means that when the next electromagnet is turned on and the first is turned off, the gear rotates slightly to align with the next one. From there the process is repeated. Each of the partial rotations is called a &quot;step&quot;, with an integer number of steps making a full rotation. In that way, the motor can be turned by a precise angle.

The circular arrangement of electromagnets is divided into groups, each group called a phase, and there is an equal number of electromagnets per group. The number of groups is chosen by the designer of the stepper motor. The electromagnets of each group are interleaved with the electromagnets of other groups to form a uniform pattern of arrangement. For example, if the stepper motor has two groups identified as A or B, and ten electromagnets in total, then the grouping pattern would be ABABABABAB.
Electromagnets within the same group are all energized together. Because of this, stepper motors with more phases typically have more wires (or leads) to control the motor.

==Types==
There are three main types of stepper motors: permanent magnet, variable reluctance, and hybrid synchronous.

Permanent magnet motors use a permanent magnet (PM) in the rotor and operate on the attraction or repulsion between the rotor magnet and the stator electromagnets. Pulses move the rotor clockwise or anticlockwise in discrete steps. If left powered at a final step, a strong detent remains at that shaft location. This detent has a predictable spring rate and specified torque limit; slippage occurs if the limit is exceeded. If current is removed, a lesser detent still remains, holding shaft position against spring or other torque influences. Stepping can then be resumed while reliably being synchronized with control electronics.

Permanent magnet stepper motors have simple DC switching electronics, a power-off detent, and no position readout. These qualities are ideal for applications such as paper printers, 3D printers, and robotics. Such applications track position simply by counting the number of steps that each motor has been instructed to take.

Variable reluctance (VR) motors have a soft iron rotor and operate based on the principle that minimum reluctance occurs with minimum gap, so the rotor points are attracted toward the stator&#x27;s magnetic poles. Variable reluctance motors have detents when powered on, but not when powered off.

Hybrid synchronous motors are a combination of the permanent magnet and variable reluctance types, to maximize power in a small size.

== Phases ==

=== Two phase ===
There are two basic winding arrangements for the electromagnetic coils in a two phase stepper motor: bipolar and unipolar.
==== Unipolar motors ====
A unipolar stepper motor has one winding with center tap per phase. Each section of windings is switched on for each direction of magnetic field. Since in this arrangement a magnetic pole can be reversed without switching the polarity of the common wire, the commutation circuit can be simply a single switching transistor for each half winding. Typically, given a phase, the center tap of each winding is made common: three leads per phase and six leads for a typical two phase motor. Often, these two phase commons are internally joined, so the motor has only five leads.

A microcontroller or stepper motor controller can be used to activate the drive transistors in the right order, and this ease of operation makes unipolar motors popular with hobbyists; they are probably the cheapest way to get precise angular movements.
For the experimenter, the windings can be identified by touching the terminal wires together in PM motors. If the terminals of a coil are connected, the shaft becomes harder to turn. One way to distinguish the center tap (common wire) from a coil-end wire is by measuring the resistance. Resistance between common wire and coil-end wire is always half of the resistance between coil-end wires. This is because there is twice the length of coil between the ends and only half from center (common wire) to the end. A quick way to determine if the stepper motor is working is to short circuit every two pairs and try turning the shaft. Whenever a higher-than-normal resistance is felt, it indicates that the circuit to the particular winding is closed and that the phase is working.

==== Bipolar motors ====

Bipolar motors have a pair of single winding connections per phase. The current in a winding needs to be reversed in order to reverse a magnetic pole, so the driving circuit must be more complicated, typically with an H-bridge arrangement (however there are several off-the-shelf driver chips available to make this a simple affair). There are two leads per phase, none is common.

A typical driving pattern for a two coil bipolar stepper motor would be: A+ B+ A− B−. I.e. drive coil A with positive current, then remove current from coil A; then drive coil B with positive current, then remove current from coil B; then drive coil A with negative current (flipping polarity by switching the wires e.g. with an H bridge), then remove current from coil A; then drive coil B with negative current (again flipping polarity same as coil A); the cycle is complete and begins anew.

Static friction effects using an H-bridge have been observed with certain drive topologies.

Dithering the stepper signal at a higher frequency than the motor can respond to will reduce this &quot;static friction&quot; effect.

Because windings are better utilized, they are more powerful than a unipolar motor of the same weight. This is due to the physical space occupied by the windings. A unipolar motor has twice the amount of wire in the same space, but only half used at any point in time, hence is 50% efficient (or approximately 70% of the torque output available). Though a bipolar stepper motor is more complicated to drive, the abundance of driver chips means this is much less difficult to achieve.

An 8-lead stepper is like a unipolar stepper, but the leads are not joined to common internally to the motor. This kind of motor can be wired in several configurations:
* Unipolar.
* Bipolar with series windings. This gives higher inductance but lower current per winding.
* Bipolar with parallel windings. This requires higher current but can perform better as the winding inductance is reduced.
* Bipolar with a single winding per phase. This method will run the motor on only half the available windings, which will reduce the available low speed torque but require less current

=== Higher-phase count ===
Multi-phase stepper motors with many phases tend to have much lower levels of vibration. While they are more expensive, they do have a higher power density and with the appropriate drive electronics are often better suited to the application.

==Driver circuits==

Stepper motor performance is strongly dependent on the driver circuit. Torque curves may be extended to greater speeds if the stator poles can be reversed more quickly, the limiting factor being a combination of the winding inductance. To overcome the inductance and switch the windings quickly, one must increase the drive voltage. This leads further to the necessity of limiting the current that these high voltages may otherwise induce.

An additional limitation, often comparable to the effects of inductance, is the back-EMF of the motor. As the motor&#x27;s rotor turns, a sinusoidal voltage is generated proportional to the speed (step rate). This AC voltage is subtracted from the voltage waveform available to induce a change in the current.

=== L/R driver circuits ===
L/R driver circuits are also referred to as constant voltage drives because a constant positive or negative voltage is applied to each winding to set the step positions. However, it is winding current, not voltage that applies torque to the stepper motor shaft. The current I in each winding is related to the applied voltage V by the winding inductance L and the winding resistance R. The resistance R determines the maximum current according to Ohm&#x27;s law I=V/R. The inductance L determines the maximum rate of change of the current in the winding according to the formula for an inductor dI/dt = V/L. The resulting current for a voltage pulse is a quickly increasing current as a function of inductance. This reaches the V/R value and holds for the remainder of the pulse. Thus when controlled by a constant voltage drive, the maximum speed of a stepper motor is limited by its inductance since at some speed, the voltage U will be changing faster than the current I can keep up. In simple terms the rate of change of current is L / R (e.g. a 10 mH inductance with 2 ohms resistance will take 5 ms to reach approx 2/3 of maximum torque or around 24 ms to reach 99% of max torque). To obtain high torque at high speeds requires a large drive voltage with a low resistance and low inductance.

With an L/R drive it is possible to control a low voltage resistive motor with a higher voltage drive simply by adding an external resistor in series with each winding. This will waste power in the resistors, and generate heat. It is therefore considered a low performing option, albeit simple and cheap.

Modern voltage-mode drivers overcome some of these limitations by approximating a sinusoidal voltage waveform to the motor phases. The amplitude of the voltage waveform is set up to increase with step rate. If properly tuned, this compensates the effects of inductance and back-EMF, allowing decent performance relative to current-mode drivers, but at the expense of design effort (tuning procedures) that are simpler for current-mode drivers.

===Chopper drive circuits===
Chopper drive circuits are referred to as controlled current drives because they generate a controlled current in each winding rather than applying a constant voltage. Chopper drive circuits are most often used with two-winding bipolar motors, the two windings being driven independently to provide a specific motor torque CW or CCW. On each winding, a &quot;supply&quot; voltage is applied to the winding as a square wave voltage; example 8 kHz. The winding inductance smooths the current which reaches a level according to the square wave duty cycle. Most often bipolar supply (+ and - ) voltages are supplied to the controller relative to the winding return. So 50% duty cycle results in zero current. 0% results in full V/R current in one direction. 100% results in full current in the opposite direction. This current level is monitored by the controller by measuring the voltage across a small sense resistor in series with the winding. This requires additional electronics to sense winding currents, and control the switching, but it allows stepper motors to be driven with higher torque at higher speeds than L/R drives. It also allows the controller to output predetermined current levels rather than fixed. Integrated electronics for this purpose are widely available.

==Phase current waveforms==

A stepper motor is a polyphase AC synchronous motor (see Theory below), and it is ideally driven by sinusoidal current. A full-step waveform is a gross approximation of a sinusoid, and is the reason why the motor exhibits so much vibration. Various drive techniques have been developed to better approximate a sinusoidal drive waveform: these are half stepping and microstepping.

===Wave drive (one phase on) ===
In this drive method only a single phase is activated at a time. It has the same number of steps as the full-step drive, but the motor will have significantly less torque than rated. It is rarely used. The animated figure shown above is a wave drive motor. In the animation, rotor has 25 teeth and it takes 4 steps to rotate by one tooth position. So there will be = 100 steps per full rotation and each step will be = .

=== Full-step drive (two phases on) ===
This is the usual method for full-step driving the motor. Two phases are always on so the motor will provide its maximum rated torque. As soon as one phase is turned off, another one is turned on. Wave drive and single phase full step are both one and the same, with same number of steps but difference in torque.

===Half-stepping===
When half-stepping, the drive alternates between two phases on and a single phase on. This increases the angular resolution. The motor also has less torque (approx 70%) at the full-step position (where only a single phase is on). This may be mitigated by increasing the current in the active winding to compensate. The advantage of half stepping is that the drive electronics need not change to support it. In animated figure shown above, if we change it to half-stepping, then it will take 8 steps to rotate by 1 tooth position. So there will be 25×8 = 200 steps per full rotation and each step will be 360/200 = 1.8°. Its angle per step is half of the full step.

===Microstepping===
What is commonly referred to as microstepping is often &quot;sine–cosine microstepping&quot; in which the winding current approximates a sinusoidal AC waveform. The common way to achieve sine-cosine current is with chopper-drive circuits. Sine–cosine microstepping is the most common form, but other waveforms can be used. Regardless of the waveform used, as the microsteps become smaller, motor operation becomes smoother, thereby greatly reducing resonance in any parts the motor may be connected to, as well as the motor itself. Resolution will be limited by the mechanical stiction, backlash, and other sources of error between the motor and the end device. Gear reducers may be used to increase resolution of positioning.

Step size reduction is an important step motor feature and a fundamental reason for their use in positioning.

Example: many modern hybrid step motors are rated such that the travel of every full step (example 1.8 degrees per full step or 200 full steps per revolution) will be within 3% or 5% of the travel of every other full step, as long as the motor is operated within its specified operating ranges. Several manufacturers show that their motors can easily maintain the 3% or 5% equality of step travel size as step size is reduced from full stepping down to 1/10 stepping. Then, as the microstepping divisor number grows, step size repeatability degrades. At large step size reductions it is possible to issue many microstep commands before any motion occurs at all and then the motion can be a &quot;jump&quot; to a new position. Some stepper controller ICs use increased current to minimise such missed steps, especially when the peak current pulses in one phase would otherwise be very brief.

==Theory==
A step motor can be viewed as a synchronous AC motor with the number of poles (on both rotor and stator) increased, taking care that they have no common denominator. Additionally, soft magnetic material with many teeth on the rotor and stator cheaply multiplies the number of poles (reluctance motor). Modern steppers are of hybrid design, having both permanent magnets and soft iron cores.

To achieve full rated torque, the coils in a stepper motor must reach their full rated current during each step. Winding inductance and counter-EMF generated by a moving rotor tend to resist changes in drive current, so that as the motor speeds up, less and less time is spent at full current—thus reducing motor torque. As speeds further increase, the current will not reach the rated value, and eventually the motor will cease to produce torque.

=== Pull-in torque ===
This is the measure of the torque produced by a stepper motor when it is operated without an acceleration state. At low speeds the stepper motor can synchronize itself with an applied step frequency, and this pull-in torque must overcome friction and inertia. It is important to make sure that the load on the motor is frictional rather than inertial as the friction reduces any unwanted oscillations.

The pull-in curve defines an area called the start/stop region. Into this region, the motor can be started/stopped instantaneously with a load applied and without loss of synchronism.

=== Pull-out torque ===
The stepper motor pull-out torque is measured by accelerating the motor to the desired speed and then increasing the torque loading until the motor stalls or misses steps. This measurement is taken across a wide range of speeds and the results are used to generate the stepper motor&#x27;s dynamic performance curve. As noted below this curve is affected by drive voltage, drive current and current switching techniques. A designer may include a safety factor between the rated torque and the estimated full load torque required for the application.

===Detent torque===
Synchronous electric motors using permanent magnets have a resonant position holding torque (called detent torque or cogging, and sometimes included in the specifications) when not driven electrically. Soft iron reluctance cores do not exhibit this behavior.

===Ringing and resonance===
When the motor moves a single step it overshoots the final resting point and oscillates round this point as it comes to rest. This undesirable ringing is experienced as motor rotor vibration and is more pronounced in unloaded motors. An unloaded or under loaded motor may, and often will, stall if the vibration experienced is enough to cause loss of synchronisation.

Stepper motors have a natural frequency of operation. When the excitation frequency matches this resonance the ringing is more pronounced, steps may be missed, and stalling is more likely. Motor resonance frequency can be calculated from the formula:

: formula_1
where formula_2 is the holding torque in N·m, formula_3 is the number of pole pairs, and formula_4 is the rotor inertia in kg·m². The magnitude of the undesirable ringing is dependent on the back EMF resulting from rotor velocity. The resultant current promotes damping, so the drive circuit characteristics are important. The rotor ringing can be described in terms of damping factor.

==Ratings and specifications==
Stepper motors&#x27; nameplates typically give only the winding current and occasionally the voltage and winding resistance. The rated voltage will produce the rated winding current at DC: but this is mostly a meaningless rating, as all modern drivers are current limiting and the drive voltages greatly exceed the motor rated voltage.

Datasheets from the manufacturer often indicate Inductance. Back-EMF is equally relevant, but seldom listed (it is straightforward to measure with an oscilloscope). These figures can be helpful for more in-depth electronics design, when deviating from standard supply voltages, adapting third party driver electronics, or gaining insight when choosing between motor models with otherwise similar size, voltage, and torque specifications.

A stepper&#x27;s low-speed torque will vary directly with current. How quickly the torque falls off at faster speeds depends on the winding inductance and the drive circuitry it is attached to, especially the driving voltage.

Steppers should be sized according to published torque curve, which is specified by the manufacturer at particular drive voltages or using their own drive circuitry. Dips in the torque curve suggest possible resonances, whose impact on the application should be understood by designers.

Step motors adapted to harsh environments are often referred to as IP65 rated.

=== NEMA stepper motors ===
The US National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standardises various dimensions, marking and other aspects of stepper motors, in NEMA standard (NEMA ICS 16-2001). NEMA stepper motors are labeled by faceplate size, NEMA 17 being a stepper motor with a faceplate and dimensions given in inches. The standard also lists motors with faceplate dimensions given in metric units. These motors are typically referred with NEMA DD, where DD is the diameter of the faceplate in inches multiplied by 10 (e.g., NEMA 17 has a diameter of 1.7 inches). There are further specifiers to describe stepper motors, and such details may be found in the ICS 16-2001 standard.

==Applications==
Computer controlled stepper motors are a type of motion-control positioning system. They are typically digitally controlled as part of an open loop system for use in holding or positioning applications.

In the field of lasers and optics they are frequently used in precision positioning equipment such as linear actuators, linear stages, rotation stages, goniometers, and mirror mounts. Other uses are in packaging machinery, and positioning of valve pilot stages for fluid control systems.

Commercially, stepper motors are used in floppy disk drives, flatbed scanners, computer printers, plotters, slot machines, image scanners, compact disc drives, intelligent lighting, camera lenses, CNC machines, and 3D printers. Some programming hobbyists have used arrays of stepper motors as electronic musical instruments by programming the motors to rotate at the frequencies of different musical tones, in a sequence that imitates that found in a MIDI file.

==Stepper motor system==
A stepper motor system consists of three basic elements, often combined with some type of user interface (host computer, PLC or dumb terminal):
;Indexers: The indexer (or controller) is a microprocessor capable of generating step pulses and direction signals for the driver. In addition, the indexer is typically required to perform many other sophisticated command functions.
;Drivers: The driver (or amplifier) converts the indexer command signals into the power necessary to energize the motor windings. There are numerous types of drivers, with different voltage and current ratings and construction technology. Not all drivers are suitable to run all motors, so when designing a motion control system, the driver selection process is critical.
;Stepper motors: The stepper motor is an electromagnetic device that converts digital pulses into mechanical shaft rotation.

*Can be used in robotics in a wide scale.
*High reliability
*The rotation angle of the motor is proportional to the input pulse.
*The motor has full torque at standstill (if the windings are energized)
*Precise positioning and repeatability of movement, since good stepper motors have an accuracy of 3–5% of a step and this error is non-cumulative from one step to the next.
*Excellent response to starting/stopping/reversing.
*Very reliable since there are no contact brushes in the motor. Therefore, the life of the motor is simply dependent on the life of the bearing.
*The motor&#x27;s response to digital input pulses provides open-loop control, making the motor simpler and less costly to control.
*It is possible to achieve very low-speed synchronous rotation with a load that is directly coupled to the shaft.
*A wide range of rotational speeds can be realized, as the speed is proportional to the frequency of the input pulses.

===Disadvantages===

*Resonance effect often exhibited at low speeds and decreasing torque with increasing speed.

<text>Total Football () is a tactical system in association football in which any outfield player can take over the role of any other player in a team. A player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team, thus retaining the team&#x27;s intended organisational structure. In this fluid system, no outfield player is fixed in a predetermined role; anyone can successively play as an attacker, a midfielder and a defender. The only player who must stay in a specified position is the goalkeeper.

Total Football&#x27;s tactical success depends largely on the adaptability of each footballer within the team, in particular the ability to quickly switch positions depending on the on-field situation. The theory requires players to be comfortable in multiple positions; hence, it requires intelligent and technically diverse players.

Manager Rinus Michels is generally credited with introducing this system during the 1970s, at Dutch club Ajax and the Netherlands national football team. However, some authors credit teams such as the Austrian Wunderteam of the 1930s or the Golden Team of Hungary of the 1950s for having played in a similar style to Total Football. Both sides were influenced by Jimmy Hogan, who was in turn influenced by the combination game.

== History ==
=== Pre-1970s ===

The first foundations for what became known as Total Football were laid by Jimmy Hogan, a Burnley native, who was influenced by the combination game. Working with Austrian coach and his friend Hugo Meisl in the early 1930s, Meisl&#x27;s Austria national football team (known as the &quot;Wunderteam&quot;) became possibly the first side to play Total Football. Hogan&#x27;s influence reached beyond the Austrian borders, as two decades later the Hungary national team (also known as the &quot;Golden Team&quot;) played a similar style of football under coach Gusztáv Sebes. The then president of the Hungarian Football Association, Sandor Barcs, said: &quot;Jimmy Hogan taught us everything we know about football&quot;.
Torino (&quot;Grande Torino&quot; as the team was called) in the 1940s played a similar style as the Austrians. Between 1941 and 1947, Argentinian club River Plate formed a remarkable team, known as &quot;La Máquina&quot; (The Machine), whose attack formed by Carlos Muñoz, José Manuel Moreno, Adolfo Pedernera, Ángel Labruna and Félix Loustau perfected the &quot;false nine&quot; style and the constant change of attack positions. &quot;La Máquina&quot; won several Argentine and international titles.

Also in the 1940s, English manager Jack Reynolds implemented a style that was bearing similarities to Total Football at Ajax, leading the Dutch club to rise in importance and win trophies for the first time. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Burnley were playing a renewed system in English football &quot;where every player could play in every position&quot; under manager Harry Potts. This Total Football system led the club to the 1959–60 First Division title and won many plaudits, including admiration from all-time English First Division top scorer Jimmy Greaves. Another pioneer was Vic Buckingham, manager of West Bromwich Albion, Ajax and Barcelona in the 1950s and 1960s, as the footballing education that he established helped the progressive nature of the type of football of Rinus Michels and later Johan Cruyff, a player who was introduced into the Ajax first team by Vic Buckingham.

=== Totaalvoetbal schools ===

Rinus Michels, who played under Reynolds, later became manager of Ajax in 1965. Michels developed the tactics of Total Football after 1970, most importantly with the introduction of forward Johan Cruyff, perhaps the system&#x27;s most famous exponent. Although Cruyff was fielded as centre forward, Michels encouraged Cruyff to roam freely around the pitch, using technical ability and intelligence to exploit the weaknesses in the opposition and create chances. Cruyff&#x27;s teammates also worked to adapt themselves accordingly, regularly switching positions to ensure tactical roles in the team were consistently filled. Austrian coach Ernst Happel reworked the theory to introduce strength, encouraging his players to play tougher during his spells at ADO Den Haag and Feyenoord. Happel also managed the Netherlands national team to a runner-up finish in the 1978 FIFA World Cup.

The major component was the use of space, with the need to consistently create space central to the concept of Total Football. Former Ajax defender Barry Hulshoff described it as &quot;[the thing] we discussed the whole time. Cruyff always talked about where to run and where to stand, and when not to move&quot;. He further elaborated that position switching was only made possible due to apt spatial awareness. He also described Total Football being proactive, as well as highlighting the use of pressing, which would be used to win back the ball or put the opposition under considerable pressure. Michels and Cruyff saw unprecedented success with the system, winning eight Eredivisie titles, three European Cups, and one Intercontinental Cup. The stark rise of Total Football and its attacking prowess was also linked with the &quot;death of &quot;Catenaccio&quot;&quot;, an Italian system reliant heavily on defence promoted by Helenio Herrera&#x27;s Internazionale during the 1960s.

The Total Football system was prone to defeat, experienced notably in the final of the 1974 FIFA World Cup contested by the Dutch and West Germany. Michels and Cruyff saw their ability to introduce playmaking stifled in the second half of the match by the effective marking of Berti Vogts. This allowed Franz Beckenbauer, Uli Hoeneß, and Wolfgang Overath to gain a stronghold in midfield, thus, enabling West Germany to win 2–1.

=== Modern era ===
Building further on the foundations of Total Football, a new tactical system developed in FC Barcelona (particularly under manager Pep Guardiola) and the Spain national team during the late 2000s and early 2010s. This came to be known as &quot;Juego de Posición&quot; or Tiki-taka.

<text> is a Hawaiian term meaning &quot;family&quot; (in an extended sense of the term, including blood-related, adoptive or intentional).
The term is cognate with Māori , meaning &quot;nest&quot;.
The root word refers to the root or corm of the , or taro plant (the staple &quot;staff of life&quot; in Hawaii), which Kanaka Maoli consider to be their cosmological ancestor.

In contemporary Hawaiian real estate jargon, an &quot; unit&quot; is a type of secondary suite. It is a part of a house or a separate structure on the same lot that may contain a relative but which may not be rented to the general public.

==In popular culture==

The word is referenced in Disney&#x27;s 2002 film, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, and throughout its franchise (&quot;Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind—or forgotten.&quot;).

<text>The House of Freedoms (, CdL) was a major centre-right political and electoral alliance in Italy, led by Silvio Berlusconi.

==History==
The CdL was the successor of the Pole of Freedoms/Pole of Good Government and the Pole for Freedoms. The former two-headed coalition had won the 1994 general election and formed the Berlusconi I Cabinet, which fell in December 1994, when the LN, whose relations with AN were quite tense, withdrew its support. The latter coalition, which did not include the LN, lost the 1996 general election to The Olive Tree, the centre-left coalition led by Romano Prodi.

In the run-up of the 2001 general election, after a six-year spell in opposition, which Berlusconi called &quot;the crossing of the desert&quot;, he managed to re-unite the coalition under the &quot;House of Freedoms&quot; banner. According to its leader, the alliance was a &quot;broad democratic arch, composed of the democratic right, namely AN, the great democratic centre, namely Forza Italia, CCD and CDU, and the democratic left represented by the League, the New PSI, the PRI and, at least I hope so, Cossiga&quot;.

The CdL won the 2001 general election by a landslide and, consequently, the Berlusconi II Cabinet was formed. In government, FI, whose strongholds included Lombardy as well as Sicily, and the LN, which was active only in the Centre-North, formed the so-called &quot;axis of the North&quot;, through the special relationship between three Lombards leaders, Berlusconi, Giulio Tremonti and Umberto Bossi; on the other side of the coalition, AN and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC), the party emerged from the merger of the CCD and the CDU in late 2002, became the natural representatives of Southern interests.

In 2003 the CdL was routed in local elections by The Olive Tree and the LN threatened to pull out. Also the 2004 European Parliament election were disappointing for FI and the coalition as a whole, even though AN, the UDC and the LN did better than five years before. As a result, Berlusconi and FI were weaker within the CdL.

In 2005 the coalition lost heavily in regional elections, losing six of the eight regions it controlled. The defeat was particularly damaging in the South, while the only two regions which the coalition managed to keep, Lombardy and Veneto, were in the North, where the LN was decisive . This led to a government crisis, particularly after the UDC pulled its ministers out. A few days later, the Berlusconi III Cabinet was formed with minor changes from the previous cabinet.

In the 2006 general election the CdL, which had opened its ranks to a number of minor parties, lost to The Union coalition, led by Romano Prodi.

In the run-up of the 2008 general election (caused by the break-up of The Olive Tree) FI, AN and minor parties joined forces and formed The People of Freedom (PdL), which would become a single party in early 2009. The PdL, allied with the LN in the Centre-North and the Movement for Autonomy (MpA) in the Centre-South, won the election and the centre-right was thus returned to the national government through the Berlusconi IV Cabinet.

The alliance has since been generically referred to as the centre-right coalition.

<text>Benjamin Guggenheim (October 26, 1865 – April 15, 1912) was an American businessman, who was a wealthy member of the Guggenheim family. He was among the most prominent American passengers aboard and perished along with 1,495 others when the ship sank on her maiden voyage taking 1,496 of 2,208 on board with her.

==Early life==
Guggenheim was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the fifth of seven sons of the wealthy mining magnate Meyer Guggenheim and Barbara. Meyer Guggenheim&#x27;s parents were Jewish. His father was a Swiss Jew born in Lengnau, Aargau, Switzerland and his mother was a German Jew. Meyer Guggenheim met Barbara Meyers (1834–1900), a fellow immigrant on the ship to the United States, and married her four years later around 1852. Benjamin was the first member of his family to enter an institute of higher learning, he entered Columbia College in 1882, matriculating with the class of 1887. However, he found most of his courses boring and dropped out after his second year. He also attended the Peirce School of Business (now Peirce College), then one of the most prominent business schools in the country. 
In 1894, he married Florette Seligman (1870–1937), daughter of James Seligman, a senior partner in the firm J. &amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co. and Rosa Seligman, née Content. Her family originated in Baiersdorf, Franconia, Germany. Together, they had three daughters: Benita Rosalind Guggenheim (1895–1927), Marguerite &quot;Peggy&quot; Guggenheim (1898–1979) and Barbara Hazel Guggenheim (1903–1995).

Guggenheim inherited a great deal of money from his mother. Due to business concerns, he grew distant from his wife and was frequently away from their New York City home. He maintained an apartment in Paris, France.

==&quot;Titanic&quot;==

Guggenheim boarded the and was accompanied by his mistress, a French singer named Léontine Aubart (1887–1964); his secretary, Victor Giglio (1888–1912); his chauffeur, René Pernot (1872–1912); and Madame Aubart&#x27;s maid, Emma Sägesser (1887–1964). His ticket was number 17593 and cost £79 4s (other sources give the price as £56 18s 7d). He and Giglio occupied stateroom cabin B84 while Aubart and Sägesser occupied cabin B35. Pernot occupied an unknown cabin in second class.

Guggenheim and Giglio slept through the &quot;Titanic&quot; collision with the iceberg only to be awakened just after midnight ship&#x27;s time by Aubart and Sägesser, who had felt the collision. Sägesser later quoted Giglio as saying, &quot;Never mind, icebergs! What is an iceberg?&quot; Bedroom steward Henry Etches stopped by Guggenheim&#x27;s stateroom, B-84 and awoke Guggenheim and Giglio, telling them to get dressed. During the evacuation, Steward Etches returned to Guggenheim&#x27;s stateroom; Guggenheim answered the door on the first knock, leading Etches to conclude that the magnate had only just retired and undressed for bed. Etches entered the room, pulled their three lifebelts out, and placed one on Guggenheim. &quot;This will hurt&quot;, Guggenheim complained. Etches helped to pull heavy sweaters over them both. Giglio and Guggenheim stayed together as they left the cabin and went out on deck. Etches saw them on their way.
Etches later testified that Guggenheim and his valet went from lifeboat to lifeboat ensuring the women and children were safely aboard and that the two were of great assistance to the officers.

Guggenheim ultimately realised that the situation was much more serious than he had implied. &quot;Titanic&quot; survivor Rose Amelie Icard wrote in a letter, &quot;The millionaire Benjamin Guggenheim after having helped the rescue of women and children, got dressed and put a rose at his buttonhole, to die.&quot; Sometime after arriving on deck, Etches saw Guggenheim and Giglio; they were dressed in their evening clothes and had taken off their sweaters and lifebelts. Guggenheim explained, &quot;We&#x27;ve dressed up in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen.&quot; Etches, who survived the sinking, recorded Guggenheim&#x27;s message to give to his wife: &quot;If anything should happen to me, tell my wife in New York that I&#x27;ve done my best in doing my duty.&quot; Etches next watched Guggenheim and Giglio pass from Boats Nos. 7 and 5, &quot;helping the women and children&quot;. Guggenheim shouted repeatedly, &quot;Women first&quot; and the two men were of &quot;great assistance&quot; to the officers. Another steward reportedly said Guggenheim sent another message to his wife, asking to tell her &quot;that I played the game straight to the end and that no women was left on board this ship because Ben Guggenheim was a coward. Tell her that my last thoughts will be of her and our girls&quot;. The steward said Guggenheim &quot;lit a cigar and sauntered up to the boat deck to help load the lifeboats.&quot; As Aubart and Sägesser reluctantly entered Lifeboat No. 9, Guggenheim reportedly was on the deck nearby and spoke in German, &quot;We will soon see each other again! It&#x27;s just a repair. Tomorrow the &quot;Titanic&quot; will go on again.&quot; Etches reported that &quot;shortly after the last few boats were lowered and I was ordered by the deck officer to man an oar, I waved good-bye to Mr. Guggenheim, and that was the last I saw of him and [Giglio].&quot; Guggenheim and Giglio, as well as Guggenheim&#x27;s chauffeur Pernot, died in the sinking. Their bodies were never recovered.

==Legacy==
Guggenheim&#x27;s family, including his brother Robert, had been hoping for news of their loved one, whom the press had reported was among the missing prior to the Carpathia&#x27;s arrival in New York. The news Guggenheim had died was confirmed by a wireless dispatch sent from the ship and received on April 18, 1912. After relating how Guggenheim was one of his charges during the voyage, Etches told them about Guggenheim&#x27;s actions and the final favour asked of him. Etches, producing the note and handing it to the widow, reported: &quot;That&#x27;s all he said, there wasn&#x27;t time for more.&quot; The family were very grateful for the news and visit.

<text>Coramae Richey Mann (1931–2004) was a professor emeritus of criminal justice at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She argued vehemently that the United States criminal justice system was racist.

Mann criticized the arguments of William Wilbanks (in his book &quot;The Myth of a Racist Criminal Justice System&quot; (1987)), countering in her 1989 book &quot;Unequal Justice&quot; that Wilbanks&#x27; reliance on quantitative and statistical data hides the reality of racism.

==Early life==
Coramae Richey-Mann was born in Chicago, Illinois on January 25, 1931. She gained undergraduate (1956) and graduate (1961) degrees in Clinical Psychology from Roosevelt University. Her doctorate in sociology (with an emphasis in Criminology) was awarded by the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1976.

<doc id="170287" wikidata="Q285484" url="?curid=170287" title="List of French cheeses">
<text>This is a list of French cheeses documenting the varieties of cheeses, a milk-based food that is produced in wide-ranging flavors, textures, and forms, which are found in France. In 1962, French President Charles de Gaulle asked, &quot;How can you govern a country which has two hundred and forty-six varieties of cheese?&quot; There is immense diversity within each variety of cheese, leading some to estimate between 1,000 and 1,600 distinct types of French cheese. French cheeses are broadly grouped into eight categories, &#x27;les huit familles de fromage&#x27;.

==Protected designation of origin==
Under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union, certain established cheeses, including many French varieties, are covered by a protected designation of origin (PDO), and other, less stringent, designations of geographical origin for traditional specialities, such as the EU Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). The systems has largely replaced national systems, such as the French appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée (AOC) system, as any cheese registered as a PDO or PGI can not use the designation AOC anymore in order to avoid confusion.

French cheese production is classified under four categories, and PDO/PGI/(AOC) rules dictate which category or categories each protected cheese may be assigned to:

* Fermier: farmhouse cheese, which is produced on the farm where the milk is produced.
* Artisanal: producer producing cheese in relatively small quantities using milk from their own farm, but may also purchase milk from local farms.
* Coopérative: dairy with local milk producers in an area that have joined to produce cheese. In larger &quot;coopératives&quot; quantities of cheese produced may be relatively large, akin to some &quot;industriel&quot; producers (many may be classed as factory-made).
*Industriel: factory-made cheese from milk sourced locally or regionally, perhaps all over France (depending on the AOC/PDO regulations for specific cheeses).

Some cheeses are classified, protected, and regulated under French law. The majority are classified as &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC), the highest level of protection. Some are also protected under the less stringent but still legally regulated designation Label Régional (LR). A few French cheeses are protected under the European Union&#x27;s Protected Geographic Indication designation (PGI). Many familiar generic types, like Boursin, are not covered, while others originally from other countries, such as Emmental cheese, may have certain varieties protected as a French cheese. This list differs from those of Chundi status.
