<text>Dr. Herbert Freeman (born Herbert Freinmann, December 13, 1925 – November 15, 2020) was an American computer scientist who made important contributions to the field of automatic label placement, computer graphics, including spatial anti-aliasing, and machine vision.

==Personal life==
Herbert Freeman was born Herbert Freimann in Frankfurt, Germany on December 13, 1925. Freeman&#x27;s parents, Leo and Johanna, and his brother, Henry, emigrated to the United States in 1936. Herbert was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and was unable to join his family in the United States until 1938. He received his B.S.E.E. degree from Union College, New York, and his Master&#x27;s and Eng.Sc.D. degree from Columbia University, New York. He married Joan Sleppin in 1955 and they had three children, Nancy, Susan, and Robert. Freeman died on November 15, 2020, in his home in New Jersey, USA.

==Career in Computer Science==
Freeman held many professorial posts such as in RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), NYU, and Rutgers University. Freeman was the recipient of several awards, including the IEEE Computer Society&#x27;s Computer Pioneer award (1999). Freeman was also a Fellow of the ACM, a Life Fellow of the IEEE, and a Guggenheim Fellow. Professor Freeman also founded MapText, Inc., in 1997.

<doc id="174068" wikidata="Q3870737" url="?curid=174068" title="Nathan Zuckerman">
<text>Nathan Zuckerman is a fictional character created by the writer Philip Roth, who uses him as his protagonist and narrator, a type of alter ego, in many of his novels.

==Character==
Roth first created a character named Nathan Zuckerman in the novel &quot;My Life as a Man&quot; (1974), where he is the &quot;product&quot; of another fictional Roth figure, the writer Peter Tarnopol (making Zuckerman, in his original form, an &quot;alter-alter-ego&quot;). Discrepancies (including date of birth, details of his upbringing, and personal background) exist between the characters, leading most to consider this an early version, and not necessarily the Zuckerman around whom subsequent novels would revolve. In later books, Roth uses Zuckerman as a protagonist, starting with the 1979 novel &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot;, where he is a writing apprentice on a pilgrimage to cull the wisdom of the reclusive author E. I. Lonoff. In &quot;Zuckerman Unbound&quot; (1981), he has become established as a novelist and must deal with the fall-out from his ribald comedic novel &quot;Carnovsky&quot;. Though wildly successful, the novel has brought to Zuckerman unwanted attention from both readers and his family, who object to their portrayal in his work.

&quot;Exit Ghost&quot; (2007) is the ninth book in the Zuckerman series, and is the last Zuckerman novel. The book explores Zuckerman&#x27;s life as an older man, returning to New York City after an extended period of seclusion in the Berkshires.

==Analysis==
By creating parallels between Zuckerman&#x27;s life as a novelist (with the novel &quot;Carnovsky&quot; a stand-in for his &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;) and his own, Roth expressed his interest in the relationship between an author and his work. Roth mined such meta-fictional concerns more deeply in his series of novels published in the 1980s, most radically in &quot;The Counterlife&quot; and &quot;Operation Shylock&quot;.

By the mid-1990s, though, Roth tamped down on the self-referentiality. He reintroduced Zuckerman as witness and narrator in a trilogy of historical novels: &quot;American Pastoral&quot; (1997), &quot;I Married a Communist&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Human Stain&quot; (2000), set in the period from the 1960s into the 1990s. The British Indian author Salman Rushdie used Zuckerman as a character in his novel &quot;The Ground Beneath Her Feet&quot; (1999), where in an alternate universe, it is the literary alter-egos (and their novels) that are real.

==Portrayals==
Actors who have portrayed Nathan Zuckerman include Mark Linn-Baker (in the 1984 television adaptation of &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot;), Gary Sinise (in the 2003 film adaptation of &quot;The Human Stain&quot;) and David Strathairn (in the 2016 film adaptation of &quot;American Pastoral&quot;).

==List of Zuckerman novels==

* &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; (1979)
* &quot;Zuckerman Unbound&quot; (1981)
* &quot;The Anatomy Lesson&quot; (1983)

<doc id="174069" wikidata="Q1396484" url="?curid=174069" title="Asteroid impact avoidance">
<text>Asteroid impact avoidance encompasses the methods by which near-Earth objects (NEO) on a potential collision course with Earth could be diverted, preventing destructive impact events. An impact by a sufficiently large asteroid or other NEOs would cause, depending on its impact location, massive tsunamis or multiple firestorms, and an impact winter caused by the sunlight-blocking effect of large quantities of pulverized rock dust and other debris placed into the stratosphere. A collision 66 million years ago between the Earth and an object approximately wide is thought to have produced the Chicxulub crater and triggered the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that is understood by the scientific community to have caused the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs.

While the chances of a major collision are low in the near term, it is a near-certainty that one will happen eventually unless defensive measures are taken. Astronomical events—such as the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts on Jupiter and the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor, along with the growing number of near-Earth objects discovered and catalogued on the Sentry Risk Table—have drawn renewed attention to such threats. The popularity of the 2021 movie &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot; helped to raise awareness of the possibility of avoiding NEOs.

In 2016, a NASA scientist warned that the Earth is unprepared for such an event. In April 2018, the B612 Foundation reported &quot;It&#x27;s 100 percent certain we&#x27;ll be hit by a devastating asteroid, but we&#x27;re not 100 percent sure when.&quot; Also in 2018, physicist Stephen Hawking, in his final book, &quot;Brief Answers to the Big Questions&quot;, considered an asteroid collision to be the biggest threat to the planet. Several ways of avoiding an asteroid impact have been described. Nonetheless, in March 2019, scientists reported that asteroids may be much more difficult to destroy than thought earlier. An asteroid may reassemble itself due to gravity after being disrupted. In May 2021, NASA astronomers reported that 5 to 10 years of preparation may be needed to avoid a virtual impactor based on a simulated exercise conducted by the 2021 Planetary Defense Conference.

In 2022, NASA spacecraft DART impacted Dimorphos, reducing the minor-planet moon&#x27;s orbital period by 32 minutes. This mission constitutes the first successful attempt at asteroid deflection. In 2025, CNSA plans to launch another deflection mission to near-Earth object 2019 VL5, a asteroid, which will include both an impactor and observer spacecraft.

== Deflection efforts ==

According to expert testimony in the United States Congress in 2013, NASA would require at least five years of preparation before a mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched. In June 2018, the US National Science and Technology Council warned that the United States was unprepared for an asteroid impact event, and developed and released the &quot;National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy Action Plan&quot; to better prepare.

Most deflection efforts for a large object require from a year to decades of warning, allowing time to prepare and carry out a collision-avoidance project, as no known planetary defense hardware has yet been developed. It has been estimated that a velocity change of just (where t is the number of years until potential impact) is needed to successfully deflect a body on a direct collision trajectory. Thus for a large number of years before impact, much smaller velocity changes are needed. For example, it was estimated there was a high chance of 99942 Apophis swinging by Earth in 2029 with a 10−4 probability of returning on an impact trajectory in 2035 or 2036. It was then determined that a deflection from this potential return trajectory, several years before the swing-by, could be achieved with a velocity change on the order of 10−6 m/s.

NASA&#x27;s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), the world&#x27;s first full-scale mission to test technology for defending Earth against potential asteroid or comet hazards, launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.

An impact by a asteroid on the Earth has historically caused an extinction-level event due to catastrophic damage to the biosphere. There is also the threat from comets entering the inner Solar System. The impact speed of a long-period comet would likely be several times greater than that of a near-Earth asteroid, making its impact much more destructive; in addition, the warning time is unlikely to be more than a few months. Impacts from objects as small as in diameter, which are far more common, are historically extremely destructive regionally (see Barringer crater).

Finding out the material composition of the object is also helpful before deciding which strategy is appropriate. Missions like the 2005 &quot;Deep Impact&quot; probe and the Rosetta spacecraft, have provided valuable information on what to expect. In October 2022, a method of mapping the insides of a potentially problematic asteroid in order to determine the best area for impact was proposed.

=== History of US government mandates ===

Efforts in asteroid impact prediction have concentrated on the survey method. The 1992 NASA-sponsored Near-Earth-Object Interception Workshop hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory evaluated issues involved in intercepting celestial objects that could hit Earth. In a 1992 report to NASA, a coordinated Spaceguard Survey was recommended to discover, verify and provide follow-up observations for Earth-crossing asteroids. This survey was expected to discover 90% of these objects larger than one kilometer within 25 years. Three years later, another NASA report recommended search surveys that would discover 60–70% of short-period, near-Earth objects larger than one kilometer within ten years and obtain 90% completeness within five more years.

In 1998, NASA formally embraced the goal of finding and cataloging, by 2008, 90% of all near-Earth objects (NEOs) with diameters of 1 km or larger that could represent a collision risk to Earth. The 1 km diameter metric was chosen after considerable study indicated that an impact of an object smaller than 1 km could cause significant local or regional damage but is unlikely to cause a worldwide catastrophe. The impact of an object much larger than 1 km diameter could well result in worldwide damage up to, and potentially including, extinction of the human species. The NASA commitment has resulted in the funding of a number of NEO search efforts, which made considerable progress toward the 90% goal by 2008. However the 2009 discovery of several NEOs approximately 2 to 3 kilometers in diameter (e.g. , , , and ) demonstrated there were still large objects to be detected.

United States Representative George E. Brown Jr. (D-CA) was quoted as voicing his support for planetary defense projects in &quot;Air &amp; Space Power Chronicles&quot;, saying &quot;If some day in the future we discover well in advance that an asteroid that is big enough to cause a mass extinction is going to hit the Earth, and then we alter the course of that asteroid so that it does not hit us, it will be one of the most important accomplishments in all of human history.&quot;

Because of Congressman Brown&#x27;s long-standing commitment to planetary defense, a U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; bill, H.R. 1022, was named in his honor: The George E. Brown Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act. This bill &quot;to provide for a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize certain near-Earth asteroids and comets&quot; was introduced in March 2005 by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA). It was eventually rolled into S.1281, the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, passed by Congress on December 22, 2005, subsequently signed by the President, and stating in part:

The result of this directive was a report presented to Congress in early March 2007. This was an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) study led by NASA&#x27;s Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&amp;E) office with support from outside consultants, the Aerospace Corporation, NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), and SAIC (amongst others).

=== Ongoing projects ===
The Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts has been cataloging the orbits of asteroids and comets since 1947. It has recently been joined by surveys that specialize in locating the near-Earth objects (NEO), many (as of early 2007) funded by NASA&#x27;s Near Earth Object program office as part of their Spaceguard program. One of the best-known is LINEAR that began in 1996. By 2004 LINEAR was discovering tens of thousands of objects each year and accounting for 65% of all new asteroid detections. LINEAR uses two one-meter telescopes and one half-meter telescope based in New Mexico.

The Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) is conducted at the Steward Observatory&#x27;s Catalina Station, located near Tucson, Arizona, in the United States. It uses two telescopes, a f/2 telescope on the peak of Mount Lemmon, and a f/1.7 Schmidt telescope near Mount Bigelow (both in the Tucson, Arizona area). In 2005, CSS became the most prolific NEO survey surpassing Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) in total number of NEOs and potentially hazardous asteroids discovered each year since. CSS discovered 310 NEOs in 2005, 396 in 2006, 466 in 2007, and in 2008 564 NEOs were found.

Spacewatch, which uses a telescope sited at the Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona, updated with automatic pointing, imaging, and analysis equipment to search the skies for intruders, was set up in 1980 by Tom Gehrels and Robert S. McMillan of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the University of Arizona in Tucson, and is now being operated by McMillan. The Spacewatch project has acquired a telescope, also at Kitt Peak, to hunt for NEOs, and has provided the old 90-centimeter telescope with an improved electronic imaging system with much greater resolution, improving its search capability.

Other near-Earth object tracking programs include Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT), Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS), Campo Imperatore Near-Earth Object Survey (CINEOS), Japanese Spaceguard Association, and Asiago-DLR Asteroid Survey. Pan-STARRS completed telescope construction in 2010, and it is now actively observing.

The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, now in operation, conducts frequent scans of the sky with a view to later-stage detection on the collision stretch of the asteroid orbit. Those would be much too late for deflection, but still in time for evacuation and preparation of the affected Earth region.

Another project, supported by the European Union, is NEOShield, which analyses realistic options for preventing the collision of a NEO with Earth. Their aim is to provide test mission designs for feasible NEO mitigation concepts. The project particularly emphasises on two aspects.

# The first one is the focus on technological development on essential techniques and instruments needed for guidance, navigation and control (GNC) in close vicinity of asteroids and comets. This will, for example, allow hitting such bodies with a high-velocity kinetic impactor spacecraft and observing them before, during and after a mitigation attempt, e.g., for orbit determination and monitoring.
# The second one focuses on refining Near Earth Object (NEO) characterisation. Moreover, NEOShield-2 will carry out astronomical observations of NEOs, to improve the understanding of their physical properties, concentrating on the smaller sizes of most concern for mitigation purposes, and to identify further objects suitable for missions for physical characterisation and NEO deflection demonstration.

&quot;Spaceguard&quot; is the name for these loosely affiliated programs, some of which receive NASA funding to meet a U.S. Congressional requirement to detect 90% of near-Earth asteroids over 1 km diameter by 2008. A 2003 NASA study of a follow-on program suggests spending US$250–450 million to detect 90% of all near-Earth asteroids and larger by 2028.

NEODyS is an online database of known NEOs.

==== Sentinel mission ====
The B612 Foundation is a private nonprofit foundation with headquarters in the United States, dedicated to protecting the Earth from asteroid strikes. It is led mainly by scientists, former astronauts and engineers from the Institute for Advanced Study, Southwest Research Institute, Stanford University, NASA and the space industry.

As a non-governmental organization it has conducted two lines of related research to help detect NEOs that could one day strike the Earth, and find the technological means to divert their path to avoid such collisions. The foundation&#x27;s goal had been to design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding space telescope, Sentinel, which was to be launched in 2017–2018. However the project was cancelled in 2015. Had the Sentinel&#x27;s infrared telescope been parked in an orbit similar to that of Venus, it would have helped identify threatening NEOs by cataloging 90% of those with diameters larger than , as well as surveying smaller Solar System objects.

Data gathered by Sentinel would have helped identify asteroids and other NEOs that pose a risk of collision with Earth, by being forwarded to scientific data-sharing networks, including NASA and academic institutions such as the Minor Planet Center. The foundation also proposes asteroid deflection of potentially dangerous NEOs by the use of gravity tractors to divert their trajectories away from Earth, a concept co-invented by the organization&#x27;s CEO, physicist and former NASA astronaut Ed Lu.

=== Prospective projects ===
Orbit@home intends to provide distributed computing resources to optimize search strategy. On February 16, 2013, the project was halted due to lack of grant funding. However, on July 23, 2013, the orbit@home project was selected for funding by NASA&#x27;s Near Earth Object Observation program and was to resume operations sometime in early 2014. As of July 13, 2018, the project is offline according to its website.

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, currently under construction, is expected to perform a comprehensive, high-resolution survey starting in the early 2020s.

===Detection from space===
On November 8, 2007, the House Committee on Science and Technology&#x27;s Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics held a hearing to examine the status of NASA&#x27;s Near-Earth Object survey program. The prospect of using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer was proposed by NASA officials.

WISE surveyed the sky in the infrared band at a very high sensitivity. Asteroids that absorb solar radiation can be observed through the infrared band. It was used to detect NEOs, in addition to performing its science goals. It is projected that WISE could detect 400 NEOs (roughly two percent of the estimated NEO population of interest) within the one-year mission.

NEOSSat, the Near Earth Object Surveillance Satellite, is a microsatellite launched in February 2013 by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) that will hunt for NEOs in space. Furthermore Near-Earth Object WISE (NEOWISE), an extension of the WISE mission, started in September 2013 (in its second mission extension) to hunt asteroids and comets close to the orbit of Earth.

=== &quot;Deep Impact&quot; ===

Research published in the March 26, 2009 issue of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, describes how scientists were able to identify an asteroid in space before it entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, enabling computers to determine its area of origin in the Solar System as well as predict the arrival time and location on Earth of its shattered surviving parts. The four-meter-diameter asteroid, called 2008 TC3, was initially sighted by the automated Catalina Sky Survey telescope, on October 6, 2008. Computations correctly predicted that it would impact 19 hours after discovery and in the Nubian Desert of northern Sudan.

A number of potential threats have been identified, such as 99942 Apophis (previously known by its provisional designation ), which in 2004 temporarily had an impact probability of about 3% for the year 2029. Additional observations revised this probability down to zero.

=== &quot;Double Asteroid Redirection Test&quot; ===

On September 26, 2022 DART impacted Dimorphos, reducing the minor-planet moon&#x27;s orbital period by 32 minutes. This mission was the first successful attempt at asteroid deflection.

=== 2019 VL5 Asteroid Deflection Mission ===

In 2025, China&#x27;s CNSA intends to launch a deflection mission to near-Earth object 2019 VL5, a 30-meter wide asteroid. The mission will launch on a Long March 3B rocket and carry both an impactor and observer spacecraft.

== Impact probability calculation pattern ==

The ellipses in the diagram on the right show the predicted position of an example asteroid at closest Earth approach. At first, with only a few asteroid observations, the error ellipse is very large and includes the Earth. Further observations shrink the error ellipse, but it still includes the Earth. This raises the predicted impact probability, since the Earth now covers a larger fraction of the error region. Finally, yet more observations (often radar observations, or discovery of a previous sighting of the same asteroid on archival images) shrink the ellipse revealing that the Earth is outside the error region, and the impact probability is near zero.

For asteroids that are actually on track to hit Earth the predicted probability of impact continues to increase as more observations are made. This similar pattern makes it difficult to differentiate between asteroids that will only come close to Earth and those that will actually hit it. This in turn makes it difficult to decide when to raise an alarm as gaining more certainty takes time, which reduces time available to react to a predicted impact. However, raising the alarm too soon has the danger of causing a false alarm and creating a Boy Who Cried Wolf effect if the asteroid in fact misses Earth.

== Collision avoidance strategies ==
Cost, risk of failure, complexity, technology readiness, and overall performance are all important trade-offs in weighing collision avoidance strategies. Methods can be differentiated by the type of mitigation (deflection or fragmentation), energy source (kinetic, electromagnetic, gravitational, solar/thermal, or nuclear), and approach strategy (interception, rendezvous, or remote station).

Strategies fall into two basic sets: fragmentation and delay. Fragmentation concentrates on rendering the impactor harmless by fragmenting it and scattering the fragments so that they miss the Earth or are small enough to burn up in the atmosphere. Delay exploits the fact that both the Earth and the impactor are in orbit. An impact occurs when both reach the same point in space at the same time, or more correctly when some point on Earth&#x27;s surface intersects the impactor&#x27;s orbit when the impactor arrives. Since the Earth is approximately in diameter and moves at approximately in its orbit, it travels a distance of one planetary diameter in about 425 seconds, or slightly over seven minutes. Delaying, or advancing the impactor&#x27;s arrival by times of this magnitude can, depending on the exact geometry of the impact, cause it to miss the Earth.

Collision avoidance strategies can also be seen as either direct, or indirect and in how rapidly they transfer energy to the object. The direct methods, such as nuclear explosives, or kinetic impactors, rapidly intercept the bolide&#x27;s path. Direct methods are preferred because they are generally less costly in time and money. Their effects may be immediate, thus saving precious time. These methods would work for short-notice and long-notice threats, and are most effective against solid objects that can be directly pushed, but in the case of kinetic impactors, they are not very effective against large loosely aggregated rubble piles. Indirect methods, such as gravity tractors, attaching rockets or mass drivers, are much slower. They require traveling to the object, changing course up to 180 degrees for space rendezvous, and then taking much more time to change the asteroid&#x27;s path just enough so it will miss Earth.

Many NEOs are thought to be &quot;flying rubble piles&quot; only loosely held together by gravity, and a typical spacecraft sized kinetic-impactor deflection attempt might just break up the object or fragment it without sufficiently adjusting its course. If an asteroid breaks into fragments, any fragment larger than across would not burn up in the atmosphere and itself could impact Earth. Tracking the thousands of buckshot-like fragments that could result from such an explosion would be a very daunting task, although fragmentation would be preferable to doing nothing and allowing the originally larger rubble body, which is analogous to a shot and wax slug, to impact the Earth.

In Cielo simulations conducted in 2011–2012, in which the rate and quantity of energy delivery were sufficiently high and matched to the size of the rubble pile, such as following a tailored nuclear explosion, results indicated that any asteroid fragments, created after the pulse of energy is delivered, would not pose a threat of re-coalescing (including for those with the shape of asteroid Itokawa) but instead would rapidly achieve escape velocity from their parent body (which for Itokawa is about 0.2 m/s) and therefore move out of an Earth-impact trajectory.

=== Nuclear explosive device ===

Initiating a nuclear explosive device above, on, or slightly beneath, the surface of a threatening celestial body is a potential deflection option, with the optimal detonation height dependent upon the composition and size of the object. It does not require the entire NEO to be vaporized to mitigate an impact threat. In the case of an inbound threat from a &quot;rubble pile&quot;, the stand off, or detonation height above the surface configuration, has been put forth as a means to prevent the potential fracturing of the rubble pile. The energetic neutrons and soft X-rays released by the detonation, which do not appreciably penetrate matter, are converted into heat upon encountering the object&#x27;s surface matter, ablatively vaporizing all line of sight exposed surface areas of the object to a shallow depth, turning the surface material it heats up into ejecta, and, analogous to the ejecta from a chemical rocket engine exhaust, changing the velocity, or &quot;nudging&quot;, the object off course by the reaction, following Newton&#x27;s third law, with ejecta going one way and the object being propelled in the other. Depending on the energy of the explosive device, the resulting rocket exhaust effect, created by the high velocity of the asteroid&#x27;s vaporized mass ejecta, coupled with the object&#x27;s small reduction in mass, would produce enough of a change in the object&#x27;s orbit to make it miss the Earth.

A Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response (HAMMER) has been proposed. While there have been no updates as of 2023 regarding the HAMMER, NASA has published its regular Planetary Defense Strategy and Action Plan for 2023. In it, NASA acknowledges that it is crucial to continue studying the potential of nuclear energy in deflecting or destroying asteroids. This is because it is currently the only option for defense if scientists were not aware of the asteroid within a few months or years, depending on the asteroid&#x27;s velocity. The report also notes there needs to be research done into the legal implications as well as policy implications on the topic.

====Stand-off approach====
If the object is very large but is still a loosely-held-together rubble pile, a solution is to detonate one or a series of nuclear explosive devices alongside the asteroid, at a or greater stand-off height above its surface, so as not to fracture the potentially loosely-held-together object. Providing that this stand-off strategy was done far enough in advance, the force from a sufficient number of nuclear blasts would alter the object&#x27;s trajectory enough to avoid an impact, according to computer simulations and experimental evidence from meteorites exposed to the thermal X-ray pulses of the Z-machine.

In 1967, graduate students under Professor Paul Sandorff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were tasked with designing a method to prevent a hypothetical 18-month distant impact on Earth by the asteroid 1566 Icarus, an object that makes regular close approaches to Earth, sometimes as close as 16 lunar distances. To achieve the task within the timeframe and with limited material knowledge of the asteroid&#x27;s composition, a variable stand-off system was conceived. This would have used a number of modified Saturn V rockets sent on interception courses and the creation of a handful of nuclear explosive devices in the 100-megaton energy range—coincidentally, the same as the maximum yield of the Soviets&#x27; &quot;Tsar Bomba&quot; would have been if a uranium tamper had been used—as each rocket vehicle&#x27;s payload. The design study was later published as Project Icarus which served as the inspiration for the 1979 film &quot;Meteor&quot;.

A NASA analysis of deflection alternatives, conducted in 2007, stated:

In the same year, NASA released a study where the asteroid Apophis (with a diameter of around ) was assumed to have a much lower rubble pile density () and therefore lower mass than it is now known to have, and in the study, it is assumed to be on an impact trajectory with Earth for the year 2029. Under these hypothetical conditions, the report determines that a &quot;Cradle spacecraft&quot; would be sufficient to deflect it from Earth impact. This conceptual spacecraft contains six B83 physics packages, each set for their maximum 1.2-megatonne yield, bundled together and lofted by an Ares V vehicle sometime in the 2020s, with each B83 being fuzed to detonate over the asteroid&#x27;s surface at a height of (&quot;1/3 of the objects diameter&quot; as its stand-off), one after the other, with hour-long intervals between each detonation. The results of this study indicated that a single employment of this option &quot;can deflect NEOs of [ diameter] two years before impact, and larger NEOs with at least five years warning&quot;. These effectiveness figures are considered to be &quot;conservative&quot; by its authors, and only the thermal X-ray output of the B83 devices was considered, while neutron heating was neglected for ease of calculation purposes.

Research published in 2021 pointed out the fact that for an effective deflection mission, there would need to be a significant amount of warning time, with the ideal being several years or more. The more warning time provided, the less energy will be necessary to divert the asteroid just enough to adjust the trajectory to avoid Earth. The study also emphasized that deflection, as opposed to destruction, can be a safer option, as there is a smaller likelihood of asteroid debris falling to Earth&#x27;s surface. The researchers proposed the best way to divert an asteroid through deflection is adjusting the output of neutron energy in the nuclear explosion.

====Surface and subsurface use====
In 2011, the director of the Asteroid Deflection Research Center at Iowa State University, Dr. Bong Wie (who had published kinetic impactor deflection studies previously), began to study strategies that could deal with objects when the time to Earth impact was less than one year. He concluded that to provide the required energy, a nuclear explosion or other event that could deliver the same power, are the only methods that can work against a very large asteroid within these time constraints.

This work resulted in the creation of a conceptual Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle (HAIV), which combines a kinetic impactor to create an initial crater for a follow-up subsurface nuclear detonation within that initial crater, which would generate a high degree of efficiency in the conversion of the nuclear energy that is released in the detonation into propulsion energy to the asteroid.

A similar proposal would use a surface-detonating nuclear device in place of the kinetic impactor to create the initial crater, then using the crater as a rocket nozzle to channel succeeding nuclear detonations.

Wie claimed the computer models he worked on showed the possibility for a asteroid to be destroyed using a single HAIV with a warning time of 30 days. Additionally, the models showed that less than 0.1% of debris from the asteroid would reach Earth&#x27;s surface. There have been few substantial updates from Wie and his team since 2014 regarding the research.

As of 2015, Wie has collaborated with the Danish Emergency Asteroid Defence Project (EADP), which intends to crowdsource sufficient funds to design, build, and store a non-nuclear HAIV spacecraft as planetary insurance. For threatening asteroids too large or close to Earth impact to effectively be deflected by the non-nuclear HAIV approach, nuclear explosive devices (with 5% of the explosive yield than those used for the stand-off strategy) are intended to be used, under international oversight, when conditions arise that necessitate it.

A study published in 2020 pointed out that a non-nuclear kinetic impact becomes less effective the larger and closer the asteroid. However, researchers ran a model that suggested a nuclear detonation near the surface of an asteroid designed to cover one side of the asteroid with x-rays would be effective. When the x-rays cover one side of an asteroid in the program, the energy would propel the asteroid in a preferred direction. The lead researcher with the study, Dave Dearborn, said a nuclear impact offered more flexibility than a non-nuclear approach, as the energy output can be adjusted specifically to the asteroid&#x27;s size and location.

====Comet deflection possibility====
Following the 1994 Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet impacts with Jupiter, Edward Teller proposed, to a collective of U.S. and Russian ex-Cold War weapons designers in a 1995 planetary defense workshop meeting at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), that they collaborate to design a one-gigaton nuclear explosive device, which would be equivalent to the kinetic energy of a asteroid. The theoretical one-gigaton device would weigh about 25–30 tons, light enough to be lifted on the Energia rocket. It could be used to instantaneously vaporize a one-kilometer asteroid, divert the paths of ELE-class asteroids (greater than in diameter) within short notice of a few months. With one year of notice, and at an interception location no closer than Jupiter, it could also deal with the even rarer short period comets that can come out of the Kuiper belt and transit past Earth orbit within two years. For comets of this class, with a maximum estimated diameter of , Chiron served as the hypothetical threat.

In 2013, the related National Laboratories of the US and Russia signed a deal that includes an intent to cooperate on defense from asteroids. The deal was meant to complement New START, but Russia suspended its participation in the treaty in 2023. As of April 2023, there has not been an official update from the White House or Moscow on how Russia&#x27;s suspended participation will affect adjacent treaties.

====Present capability====
As of late 2022, the most likely and most effective method for asteroid deflection does not involve nuclear technology. Instead, it involves a kinetic impactor designed to redirect the asteroid, which showed promise in the NASA DART mission. For nuclear technology, simulations have been run analyzing the possibility of using neutron energy put off by a nuclear device to redirect an asteroid. These simulations showed promise, with one study finding that increasing the neutron energy output had a notable effect on the angle of the asteroid&#x27;s travel. However, there has not been a practical test studying the possibility as of April 2023.

=== Kinetic impact ===

The impact of a massive object, such as a spacecraft or even another near-Earth object, is another possible solution to a pending NEO impact. An object with a high mass close to the Earth could be sent out into a collision course with the asteroid, knocking it off course.

When the asteroid is still far from the Earth, a means of deflecting the asteroid is to directly alter its momentum by colliding a spacecraft with the asteroid.

A NASA analysis of deflection alternatives, conducted in 2007, stated:

This deviation method, which has been implemented by DART and, for a completely different purpose (analysis of the structure and composition of a comet), by NASA&#x27;s Deep Impact space probe, involves launching a spacecraft against the near Earth object. The speed of the asteroid is modified due to the law of conservation of momentum:

with V velocity of the spacecraft, V velocity of the celestial body before impact, and V the velocity after impact. M and M respective mass of the spacecraft and of the celestial body. Velocities are vectors here.

The European Union&#x27;s NEOShield-2 Mission is also primarily studying the Kinetic Impactor mitigation method. The principle of the kinetic impactor mitigation method is that the NEO or Asteroid is deflected following an impact from an impactor spacecraft. The principle of momentum transfer is used, as the impactor crashes into the NEO at a very high velocity of or more. The momentum of the impactor is transferred to the NEO, causing a change in velocity and therefore making it deviate from its course slightly.

As of mid-2021, the modified AIDA mission has been approved. The NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (&quot;DART&quot;) kinetic impactor spacecraft was launched in November 2021. The goal was to impact Dimorphos (nicknamed &quot;Didymoon&quot;), the minor-planet moon of near-Earth asteroid 65803 Didymos. The impact occurred in September 2022 when Didymos is relatively close to Earth, allowing Earth-based telescopes and planetary radar to observe the event. The result of the impact will be to change the orbital velocity and hence orbital period of Dimorphos, by a large enough amount that it can be measured from Earth. This will show for the first time that it is possible to change the orbit of a small asteroid, around the size most likely to require active mitigation in the future. The launch and use of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test system in March 2023 showed the world that asteroids could be safely redirected without the use of nuclear means. The second part of the AIDA missionthe ESA HERA spacecrafthas been approved by ESA member states in October 2019. It would reach the Didymos system in 2026 and measure both the mass of Dimorphos and the precise effect of the impact on that body, allowing much better extrapolation of the AIDA mission to other targets.

=== Asteroid gravity tractor ===

Another alternative to explosive deflection is to move the asteroid slowly over time. A small but constant amount of thrust accumulates to deviate an object sufficiently from its course. Edward T. Lu and Stanley G. Love have proposed using a massive uncrewed spacecraft hovering over an asteroid to gravitationally pull the asteroid into a non-threatening orbit. Though both objects are gravitationally pulled towards each other, the spacecraft can counter the force towards the asteroid by, for example, an ion thruster, so the net effect would be that the asteroid is accelerated towards the spacecraft and thus slightly deflected from its orbit. While slow, this method has the advantage of working irrespective of the asteroid&#x27;s composition or spin rate; rubble pile asteroids would be difficult to deflect by means of nuclear detonations, while a pushing device would be difficult or inefficient to mount on a fast-rotating asteroid. A gravity tractor would likely have to spend several years beside the asteroid to be effective.

A NASA analysis of deflection alternatives, conducted in 2007, stated:

=== Ion beam deflection ===
Another &quot;contactless&quot; asteroid deflection technique involves the use of a low-divergence ion thruster pointed at the asteroid from a nearby hovering spacecraft. The momentum transmitted by the ions reaching the asteroid surface produces a slow but continuous force that can deflect the asteroid in a similar way as the gravity tractor, but with a lighter spacecraft.

=== Focused solar energy ===
H. J. Melosh with I. V. Nemchinov proposed deflecting an asteroid or comet by focusing solar energy onto its surface to create thrust from the resulting vaporization of material. This method would first require the construction of a space station with a system of large collecting, concave mirrors similar to those used in solar furnaces.

Orbit mitigation with highly concentrated sunlight is scalable to achieving the predetermined deflection within a year even for a global-threatening body without prolonged warning time.

Such a hastened strategy may become topical in the case of late detection of a potential hazard, and also, if required, in providing the possibility for some additional action. Conventional concave reflectors are practically inapplicable to the high-concentrating geometry in the case of a giant shadowing space target, which is located in front of the mirrored surface. This is primarily because of the dramatic spread of the mirrors&#x27; focal points on the target due to the optical aberration when the optical axis is not aligned with the Sun. On the other hand, the positioning of any collector at a distance to the target much larger than its size does not yield the required concentration level (and therefore temperature) due to the natural divergence of the sunrays. Such principal restrictions are inevitably at any location regarding the asteroid of one or many unshaded forward-reflecting collectors. Also, in the case of secondary mirrors use, similar to the ones found in Cassegrain telescopes, would be prone to heat damage by partially concentrated sunlight from primary mirror.

In order to remove the above restrictions, V.P. Vasylyev proposed to apply an alternative design of a mirrored collector – the ring-array concentrator. This type of collector has an underside lens-like position of its focal area that avoids shadowing of the collector by the target and minimizes the risk of its coating by ejected debris. Provided the sunlight concentration of approximately 5 × 103 times, a surface irradiance of around 4-5 MW/m2 leads to a thrusting effect of about . Intensive ablation of the rotating asteroid surface under the focal spot will lead to the appearance of a deep &quot;canyon&quot;, which can contribute to the formation of the escaping gas flow into a jet-like one. This may be sufficient to deflect a asteroid within several months and no addition warning period, only using ring-array collector size of about half of the asteroid&#x27;s diameter. For such a prompt deflection of the larger NEOs, , the required collector sizes are comparable to the target diameter. In the case of a longer warning time, the required size of the collector may be significantly decreased.

=== Mass driver ===
A mass driver is an (automated) system on the asteroid to eject material into space, thus giving the object a slow steady push and decreasing its mass. A mass driver is designed to work as a very low specific impulse system, which in general uses a lot of propellant, but very little power. This essentially uses the asteroid against itself in order to divert a collision.

Modular Asteroid Deflection Mission Ejector Node, (MADMEN), is the idea of landing small unmanned vehicles such as space rovers to break up small portions of the asteroid. Using drills to break up small rocks and boulders from the surface, debris would eject from the surface very fast. Because there are no forces acting on the asteroid these rocks will push the asteroid off course at a very slow rate. This process takes time but could be very effective if implemented correctly. The idea is that when using local material as propellant, the amount of propellant is not as important as the amount of power, which is likely to be limited.

=== Conventional rocket engine ===
Attaching any spacecraft propulsion device would have a similar effect of giving a push, possibly forcing the asteroid onto a trajectory that takes it away from Earth. An in-space rocket engine that is capable of imparting an impulse of 106 N·s (E.g. adding 1 km/s to a 1000 kg vehicle), will have a relatively small effect on a relatively small asteroid that has a mass of roughly a million times more. Chapman, Durda, and Gold&#x27;s white paper calculates deflections using existing chemical rockets delivered to the asteroid.

Such direct force rocket engines are typically proposed to use highly-efficient electrically powered spacecraft propulsion, such as ion thrusters or VASIMR.

=== Asteroid laser ablation ===
Similar to the effects of a nuclear device, it is thought possible to focus sufficient laser energy on the surface of an asteroid to cause flash vaporization / ablation to create either in impulse or to ablate away the asteroid mass. This concept, called asteroid laser ablation was articulated in the 1995 SpaceCast 2020 white paper &quot;Preparing for Planetary Defense&quot;, and the 1996 Air Force 2025 white paper &quot;Planetary Defense: Catastrophic Health Insurance for Planet Earth&quot;. Early publications include C. R. Phipps &quot;ORION&quot; concept from 1996, Colonel Jonathan W. Campbell&#x27;s 2000 monograph &quot;Using Lasers in Space: Laser Orbital Debris Removal and Asteroid Deflection&quot;, and NASA&#x27;s 2005 concept Comet Asteroid Protection System (CAPS). Typically such systems require a significant amount of power, such as would be available from a Space-Based Solar Power Satellite.

Another proposal is the Phillip Lubin&#x27;s DE-STAR proposal:

* The DE-STAR project, proposed by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is a concept modular solar powered 1 μm, near infrared wavelength, laser array. The design calls for the array to eventually be approximately 1 km squared in size, with the modular design meaning that it could be launched in increments and assembled in space. In its early stages as a small array it could deal with smaller targets, assist solar sail probes and would also be useful in cleaning up space debris.

=== Other proposals ===
* Wrapping the asteroid in a sheet of reflective plastic such as aluminized PET film as a solar sail
* &quot;Painting&quot; or dusting the object with titanium dioxide (white) to alter its trajectory via increased reflected radiation pressure or with soot (black) to alter its trajectory via the Yarkovsky effect.
* Planetary scientist Eugene Shoemaker in 1996 proposed deflecting a potential impactor by releasing a cloud of steam in the path of the object, hopefully gently slowing it. Nick Szabo in 1990 sketched a similar idea, &quot;cometary aerobraking&quot;, the targeting of a comet or ice construct at an asteroid, then vaporizing the ice with nuclear explosives to form a temporary atmosphere in the path of the asteroid.
* Coherent digger array multiple 1-ton flat tractors able to dig and expel asteroid soil mass as a coherent fountain array, coordinated fountain activity may propel and deflect over years.
* Attaching a tether and ballast mass to the asteroid to alter its trajectory by changing its center of mass.
* Magnetic flux compression to magnetically brake and or capture objects that contain a high percentage of meteoric iron by deploying a wide coil of wire in its orbital path and when it passes through, Inductance creates an electromagnet solenoid to be generated.

== Deflection technology concerns ==
Carl Sagan, in his book &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot;, expressed concern about deflection technology, noting that any method capable of deflecting impactors &quot;away&quot; from Earth could also be abused to divert non-threatening bodies &quot;toward&quot; the planet. Considering the history of genocidal political leaders and the possibility of the bureaucratic obscuring of any such project&#x27;s true goals to most of its scientific participants, he judged the Earth at greater risk from a man-made impact than a natural one. Sagan instead suggested that deflection technology be developed only in an actual emergency situation.

All low-energy delivery deflection technologies have inherent fine control and steering capability, making it possible to add just the right amount of energy to steer an asteroid originally destined for a mere close approach toward a specific Earth target.

According to former NASA astronaut Rusty Schweickart, the gravitational tractor method is controversial because, during the process of changing an asteroid&#x27;s trajectory, the point on the Earth where it could most likely hit would be slowly shifted across different countries. Thus, the threat for the entire planet would be minimized at the cost of some specific states&#x27; security. In Schweickart&#x27;s opinion, choosing the way the asteroid should be &quot;dragged&quot; would be a tough diplomatic decision.

Analysis of the uncertainty involved in nuclear deflection shows that the ability to protect the planet does not imply the ability to target the planet. A nuclear explosion that changes an asteroid&#x27;s velocity by 10 meters per second (plus or minus 20%) would be adequate to push it out of an Earth-impacting orbit. However, if the uncertainty of the velocity change was more than a few percent, there would be no chance of directing the asteroid to a particular target.

Additionally, there are legal concerns regarding the launch of nuclear technology into space. In 1992, the United Nations adopted a resolution that provides strict rules regarding sending nuclear technology to space, including preventing the contamination of space as well as protecting all citizens on Earth from potential fallout. As of 2022, the UN is still considering the safety and legal issues of launching nuclear powered items into outer space, particularly given the expanding field of space travel as more private organizations take part in the modern space race. The UN Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space recently emphasized the point of the previous resolution, saying it is the responsibility of the member states to ensure the safety of everyone regarding nuclear power in space.

== Planetary defense timeline ==
* In their 1964 book, &quot;Islands in Space&quot;, Dandridge M. Cole and Donald W. Cox noted the dangers of planetoid impacts, both those occurring naturally and those that might be brought about with hostile intent. They argued for cataloging the minor planets and developing the technologies to land on, deflect, or even capture planetoids.
* In 1967, students in the Aeronautics and Astronautics department at MIT did a design study, &quot;Project Icarus&quot;, of a mission to prevent a hypothetical impact on Earth by asteroid 1566 Icarus. The design project was later published in a book by the MIT Press and received considerable publicity, for the first time bringing asteroid impact into the public eye.
* In the 1980s NASA studied evidence of past strikes on planet Earth, and the risk of this happening at the current level of civilization. This led to a program that maps objects in the Solar System that both cross Earth&#x27;s orbit and are large enough to cause serious damage if they hit.
* In the 1990s, US Congress held hearings to consider the risks and what needed to be done about them. This led to a US$3 million annual budget for programs like Spaceguard and the near-Earth object program, as managed by NASA and USAF.
* In 2005 a number of astronauts published an open letter through the Association of Space Explorers calling for a united push to develop strategies to protect Earth from the risk of a cosmic collision.
* In 2007 it was estimated that there were approximately 20,000 objects capable of crossing Earth&#x27;s orbit and large enough (140 meters or larger) to warrant concern. On the average, one of these will collide with Earth every 5,000 years, unless preventive measures are undertaken. It was anticipated that by year 2008, 90% of such objects that are 1 km or more in diameter will have been identified and will be monitored. The further task of identifying and monitoring all such objects of 140m or greater was expected to be complete around 2020. By April 2018, astronomers have spotted more than 8,000 near-Earth asteroids that are at least wide and it is estimated about 17,000 such near-Earth asteroids remain undetected. By 2019, the number of discovered near-Earth asteroids of all sizes totaled more than 19,000. An average of 30 new discoveries are added each week.
* The Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) is one of NASA&#x27;s four funded surveys to carry out a 1998 U.S. Congress mandate to find and catalog by the end of 2008, at least 90 percent of all near-Earth objects (NEOs) larger than 1 kilometer across. CSS discovered over 1150 NEOs in years 2005 to 2007. In doing this survey they discovered on November 20, 2007, an asteroid, designated , which initially was estimated to have a chance of hitting Mars on January 30, 2008, but further observations during the following weeks allowed NASA to rule out an impact. NASA estimated a near miss by .
* In January 2012, after a near pass-by of object 2012 BX34, a paper entitled &quot;A Global Approach to Near-Earth Object Impact Threat Mitigation&quot; was released by researchers from Russia, Germany, the United States, France, Britain, and Spain, which discusses the &quot;NEOShield&quot; project.
* In November 2021, NASA launched a program with a different goal in terms of planetary defense. Many common methods previously in place were meant to completely destroy the asteroid. However, NASA and many others believed this method was far too unreliable so they funded the Double Asteroid Redirection Test or (DART) mission. This mission launched a small unmanned spacecraft to crash into the asteroid to break it up, or to deflect the rock away from Earth.
* In January 2022, The NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)—a state-of-the-art asteroid detection system operated by the University of Hawaii (UH) Institute for Astronomy (IfA) for the agency&#x27;s Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO)—has reached a new milestone by becoming the first survey capable of searching the entire dark sky every 24 hours for near-Earth objects (NEOs) that could pose a future impact hazard to Earth. Now comprising four telescopes, ATLAS has expanded its reach to the southern hemisphere from the two existing northern-hemisphere telescopes on Haleakalā and Maunaloa in Hawai&#x27;i to include two additional observatories in South Africa and Chile.
* As of March 1, 2023, we have proof from NASA that DART does indeed work. It was successful in both targeting and making contact with an asteroid moving at high speeds and, was successful in redirecting its course. This data showed that we can successfully move an asteroid with a diameter up to half a mile.

<text>An action figure is a poseable character model figure made most commonly of plastic, and often based upon characters from a film, comic book, military, video game or television program; fictional or historical. These figures are usually marketed toward boys and adult collectors. The term was coined by Hasbro in 1964 to market G.I. Joe to boys (while competitors called similar offerings &quot;boy&#x27;s dolls&quot;).

According to a 2005 study in Sweden, action figures which display traditional masculine traits primarily target boys. While most commonly marketed as a child&#x27;s toy, the action figure has gained widespread acceptance as collector item for adults. In such a case, the item may be produced and designed on the assumption it will be bought solely for display as a collectible and not played with like a child&#x27;s toy.

== History ==
=== Precursors ===

Articulated dolls go back to at least 200 BCE, with articulated clay and wooden dolls of ancient Greece and Rome. Many types of articulated figures date to the early modern period, including the artists&#x27; mannequin and the Japanese &quot;ichimatsu&quot; doll. The modern ball-jointed doll was first created in Western Europe in the late 19th century. From the late 19th century through the early 20th century French and German manufacturers made bisque dolls with strung bodies articulated with ball-joints made of composition: a mix of pulp, sawdust, glue and similar materials. These dolls could measure between and are now collectible antiques.

Besides the articulated doll, another important precursor to the action figure is the toy soldier. Military figures have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs, and have appeared in many cultures and eras. Tin soldiers were produced in Germany as early as the 1730s, by molding the metal between two pieces of slate. As industry and demand advanced, so did production methods, with hollow casting first being utilized in the 1890s and polyethylene figures becoming common by the 1950s. The toy soldier market, ubiquitous thanks to its history and mass-production methods, would therefore become a natural home for the military-themed action figure.

One of the earliest toys to bear resemblance to modern action figures is Albert Schoenhut&#x27;s &quot;Humpy Dumpty Circus&quot;, released in 1904, which featured articulated wooden figures interacting with various devices.

=== 1960s–1970s ===
The term &quot;action figure&quot; was coined by Hasbro in 1964, to market their G.I. Joe figure to boys who refused to play with &quot;dolls&quot;, a term primarily associated as a girl&#x27;s toy. (A similar toy named Johnny Hero was introduced by Rosko Industries for Sears in 1965, but was known as a &quot;Boy&#x27;s Doll&quot; since the term action figure had not gained widespread usage at that point.) G.I. Joe was initially a military-themed 11.5-inch figure proposed by marketing and toy idea-man Stan Weston. It featured changeable clothes with various uniforms to suit different purposes.

In a move that would create global popularity for this type of toy, Hasbro also licensed the product to companies in other markets. These different licensees had a combination of uniforms and accessories that were usually identical to the ones manufactured for the US market by Hasbro, along with some sets that were unique to the local market. The Japanese had at least two examples where a Hasbro licensee also issued sublicenses for related products. For example, Palitoy (in the UK) issued a sublicense to Tsukuda, a company in Japan, to manufacture and sell Palitoy&#x27;s Action Man accessories in the Japanese market. Takara also issued a sublicense to Medicom for the manufacture of action figures.

Takara, still under license by Hasbro to make and sell G.I. Joe toys in Japan, also manufactured an action figure incorporating the licensed GI Joe torso for Henshin Cyborg-1, using transparent plastic revealing cyborg innards, and a chrome head and cyborg feet. During the oil supply crisis of the 1970s, like many other manufacturers of action figures, Takara was struggling with the costs associated with making the large -inch figures, So, a smaller version of the cyborg toy was developed, standing at high, and was first sold in 1974 as Microman. The Microman line was also novel in its use of interchangeable parts. This laid the foundation for both the smaller action figure size and the transforming robot toy. Takara began producing characters in the Microman line with increasingly robotic features, including Robotman, a robot with room for a Microman pilot, and Mini-Robotman, a version of Robotman. These toys also featured interchangeable parts, with emphasis placed on the transformation and combination of the characters.

In 1971, Mego began licensing and making American Marvel and DC comic book superhero figures, which had highly successful sales and are considered highly collectible by many adults today. They eventually brought the Microman toy line to the United States as the Micronauts, but Mego eventually lost control of the market after losing the license to produce &quot;Star Wars&quot; toys to Kenner in 1976. The widespread success of Kenner&#x27;s Star Wars toy line made the newer, smaller size figure with molded-on clothing the industry standard. Instead of a single character with outfits that changed for different applications, toy lines included teams of characters with special functions. Led by Star Wars-themed sales, collectible action figures quickly became a multimillion-dollar secondary business for movie studios.

From 1972 to 1986 there was a famous line of Big Jim action figures produced by Mattel.

=== 1980s–1990s ===
The 1980s spawned all sorts of popular action figure lines, many based on cartoon series, which were one of the largest marketing tools for toy companies. Some of the most successful to come about were Masters of the Universe, G.I. Joe, Thundercats, The Real Ghostbusters and Super Powers Collection, to name just a few. Early in the decade, the burgeoning popularity of Japanese robot anime such as &quot;Gundam&quot; also encouraged Takara to reinvent the Microman line as the Micro Robots, moving from the cyborg action figure concept to the concept of the living robot. This led to the Micro Change line of toys: objects that could &quot;transform&quot; into robots. In 1984, Hasbro licensed Micro Change and another Takara line, the Diaclone transforming cars, and combined them in the US as the , spawning a still-continuing family of animated cartoons.

As the &#x27;80s were ending, more and more collectors started to surface, buying up the toys to keep in their original packaging for display purposes and for future collectability. This led to flooding of the action figure toy market. One of the most popular action figure lines of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures were produced in such high quantities that the value for most figures would never be higher than a few dollars. In the mid-1990s, a new Star Wars figure line had surfaced and Spawn figures flooded the toy store shelves, proving action figures were not just for kids anymore. Corinthian Figures of association football players were popular in England during this time. Beginning in 1997, &quot;ToyFare&quot; magazine would become a popular read for mature collectors in providing news and embracing nostalgia with a comedic twist. And with the gaining popularity of the Internet, websites such as Toy News International would soon offer information on upcoming collectible figures and merchandise.

It was during this time that popular characters were increasingly getting specialized costume and variant figures. Batman quickly became most notorious for this (i.e. Arctic Batman, Piranha Blade Batman, Neon Armor Batman). Rather than individual characters, these variants would make up the bulk of many action figure lines and often make use of the old figure and accessory molds. Glow-in-the-dark figures and accessories also became popular in the early &#x27;90s with lines like Toxic Crusaders and Swamp Thing.

A 1999 study found that &quot;the figures have grown much more muscular over time, with many contemporary figures far exceeding the muscularity of even the largest human bodybuilders&quot; and that the changing cultural expectations reflected by those changes may contribute to body image disorders in both sexes.

=== 2000s onwards ===
The adult collector market for action figures expanded with companies such as McFarlane Toys, Palisades, and NECA. These companies have given numerous movie characters, musicians, and athletes their very first highly detailed figures. The Cinema of Fear action figures were sold together with plush dolls, &quot;screen grab&quot; dioramas, and limited edition toys based on New Line Cinema&#x27;s horror franchise. These kinds of action figure are mainly intended as statuesque display pieces rather than toys. Child-oriented lines such as the Masters of the Universe revival and Justice League Unlimited, however, still evoke adult collector followings as well. Comic book firms are also able to get figures of their characters produced, regardless of whether or not they appeared in movies or animated cartoons. Examples of companies that produce comic figures and merchandise almost exclusively include Toy Biz and DC Direct.

Adult-oriented figure lines are often exclusive to specific chain stores rather than mass retail. Popular lines often have figures available exclusively through mail-in offers and comic conventions, which raises their value significantly. Ploys such as packaging &quot;errors&quot; and &quot;short-packed&quot; figures have also been used by toy companies to increase collector interest.

== Production ==
=== Raw materials ===

Modelling clay and various sculpting tools are used to create the prototype. The actual figure is molded from a harder plastic resin such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Softer plastics and nylon may be used for costume components including body suits, capes, and face masks. Acrylic paints of various colors may be used to decorate the figure. More elaborate toys may contain miniature electronic components that provide light and sound effects.

=== Designs ===

Once the character has been selected, the actual design process begins with sketches of the proposed figure. The next step is the creation of a clay prototype, but other materials such as wax can also be used for the prototype. This model is made by bending aluminum wires to form the backbone of the figure, known as an armature. The wire form includes the outline of the arms and legs posed in the general stance that the figure will assume. The sculptor then adds clay to the armature to give the basic weight and shape that is desired. The clay may be baked slightly during the prototyping process to harden it. Then, the sculptor uses various tools, such as a wire loop, to carve the clay and shape details on the figure.

After creating the basic form, the sculptor may choose to remove the arms and work on them separately for later attachment. This gives the sculptor more control and allows him to produce finer details on the prototype. Working with blunt tools, the sculptor shapes the body with as much detail as is desired. During this process, photo and sketch references are used to ensure the figure is as realistic as possible. Some sculptors may even use human models to guide their design work.
After the general body shape is complete, the sculptor adds the finer details, paying close attention to the eyes, nose, and mouth that give the figure its lifelike expression. The designer may attach a rough lump of clay on the main figure as a temporary head while the real head is sculpted on a separate armature. This allows the sculptor to finish the figure&#x27;s facial expressions independently of the body. At this point, the finished head can be attached to the main armature and joined to the body with additional clay. Once the head is attached, the neck and hair are sculpted to properly fit to the figure. Then, depending on the design of the figure, the costume may be sculpted directly onto the body. However, if a cloth costume or uniform will be added later, the prototype is sculpted without any costume details. During this process, parts of the clay may be covered with aluminum foil to keep it from prematurely drying out. Once everything is completed, the entire figure is baked to harden the clay.

The sculpted prototype is then sent for approval to the manufacturer. Once all design details have been finalized, the prototype is used to make the molds that will form the plastic pieces for the mass-produced figure. The entire sculpting process may take about two weeks, depending on the skill and speed of the sculptor. This process may be repeated several times if revisions must be made to the figure. Several months are typically allowed for this design phase.

== Characteristics and features ==

=== Scale ===
Action Figures come in fixed scales to allow compatibility within (and sometimes between) toy ranges.

=== Articulation ===

A common feature among action figures is body articulation, often referred to as points of articulation (POA) or joints. The most basic forms of articulation include one neck joint, two shoulder joints, and two hip joints. Beyond these, rotating wrists, bending knees, and a swiveling waist are also common. Various terms have come into practice such as a &quot;cut&quot; joint, frequently used to allow a basic head rotation at the neck or arm rotation at the shoulder. The &quot;T&quot; joint at a figure&#x27;s hips commonly allows up to 180° of front-to-back leg rotation; although, this may vary. Ball joints often allow more liberal movement than a cut, such as the figure&#x27;s head being able to tilt in addition to a cut&#x27;s strict vertical rotation. Basic knee articulation often relies on what is considered a pin joint.

The amount and style of figure articulation used by toy designers have varied over the years. Two of the most popular figure lines of the 1980s, &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; and &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;, contrasted one another greatly in articulation; the former included several points in their small, scale while the bulkier latter remained minimal. Both, however, used methods involving rubber cords at the hips that are little used today. In the 2000s, Toy Biz&#x27;s popular &quot;Marvel Legends&quot; line became known for its high rate of articulation, even boasting points at the abdomen, toes, and fingers.

=== Accessories ===
While not all action figures include accessories, the additional items often prove essential to characters and their effectiveness as interactive toys. Typical scale G.I. Joe figures include several intricately sculpted guns or hand weapons that can be fastened inside the figures&#x27; hands. Missile launchers are also commonplace in military and comic book figure lines and usually involve a spring-loaded mechanism. However, possibly due to safety concerns, this method saw a decline in the mid-1990s. Some figures, particularly of the Joker, have incorporated water-squirting weapons.

More recently, Marvel Legends has popularized the &quot;build-a-figure&quot; concept. Each figure of a particular series includes a body part to a larger-scaled figure. This encourages the consumer to purchase every figure of the given series, in order to complete the larger figure. The concept has spread into Mattel&#x27;s DC Universe Classics. Figures intended to appeal to the collector market commonly include a display base and/or pack-in comic book. In such cases accessories may be designed more for display than play.

=== Types of packaging ===

Manufacturers have packaged their action figures in a number of ways.

Window Box packaging Window box packages consist of a sturdy, but somewhat thin cardboard box that allows for easy stacking. The box has colorful artwork to draw one&#x27;s attention. The front of the box will have an area of the cardboard that is cut out and a thin piece of soft plastic then fills the cutout area. This ensures easy visibility of the action figure inside of the box. This type of packaging was used by companies such as Mego Corporation in the early 1970s until they switched to the Carded Bubble style of packaging in the mid to late 1970s. Window Box packaging is still used today, often for figures that measure 10&quot; or taller in height.

Carded Bubble packaging This type of packaging consists of a sturdy piece of thin cardboard backing known as a &quot;Card.&quot; The card is decorated with colorful artwork to draw consumer attention. The action figure is placed on the card and a bubble of clear plastic is then laid over the top of the action figure and attached to the card. The figure is then clearly visible to consumers. Often the bubble will have several small, fitted compartments to hold the figure and its accessories in place. Kenner and Hasbro&#x27;s packaging of Star Wars action figures since 1977 are an example.

PVC packaging A more recent type of packaging that is common as of the 2000s decade is PVC packaging. With this type of packaging, the cardboard card is replaced by a clear PVC plastic backing. The front of the package is a different piece of PVC plastic that is molded to include a bubble that will house the action figure and all of its accessories. Any colorful artwork designed to help draw attention to the package will be printed on a thin piece of paper that is placed between these two pieces of PVC, or will be affixed in sticker form to the front piece of PVC. This type of packaging is popular today and can be seen being used by McFarlane Toys for their Movie Maniacs line of action figures beginning with Series V. Other companies that utilize this type of packaging are NECA/Reel Toys (National Entertainment Collectibles Association) with their Cult Classics and Pirates of the Caribbean line of figures, and Toy Biz with its Marvel Legends action figures, which included a comic book placed between the two PVC segments.

Tube packaging Another recent type of PVC packaging is a tube-shaped piece of PVC plastic surrounding the action figure. The tube may be cylindrical or oval in shape. Artwork on the package is often in the form of a sticker affixed to the outside of the PVC tube. This type of packaging has been used by Hasbro for their Star Wars Galactic Heroes line of figures.

=== Action features ===
Figures of the original Masters of the Universe line included many unique &quot;action features&quot;: Battle Armor He-Man and Skeletor had rotating chest plates to represent varying degrees of damage; Leech featured suction cup limbs; Mantenna&#x27;s eyes would pop out using a lever on his back; and Thunder Punch He-Man would thrust a punch and emit a loud bang from the ring cap in his backpack. Other features emphasized aesthetic rather than action, such as the flocked bodies of Grizzlor and Moss Man as well as the unique scents of the latter and Stinkor.

The success of the many Transformers lines has relied heavily on their signature feature of shifting from vehicle to robot. The popularity of this carried into Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&#x27; Mutatin&#x27; series among others.

In 1987, Mattel introduced figures for the television series &quot;Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future&quot;. The line boasted an interactive game where children could shoot at the TV screen. However, while an ambitious concept, it was not a long-term success.

Glow-in-the-dark paint and plastic have been utilized in various figure collections, particularly those of the early &#x27;90s including Ninja Turtles, Swamp Thing, and Toxic Crusaders. Similarly, a color-changing feature has been demonstrated on some figures throughout the years. This concept involves dipping the character&#x27;s head into cold water and revealing a temperature-sensitive paint. Examples include Kenner&#x27;s Sky Escape Joker and Camouflage Swamp Thing, as well as Hasbro&#x27;s Desert-Camo Sgt. Savage.

The majority of figures in Kenner&#x27;s Super Powers Collection toted a punching action upon the squeezing together of their legs. In a more technically advanced method, the Ninja Turtles&#x27; Wacky Action series involved a wind-up gear that caused the motorized performance of certain actions like swimming legs or a rotating wrist. Two years prior also saw the release of Tyco&#x27;s Dino-Riders, which featured battery powered, motorized dinosaurs.

<text>In linear algebra, a diagonal matrix is a matrix in which the entries outside the main diagonal are all zero; the term usually refers to square matrices. Elements of the main diagonal can either be zero or nonzero. An example of a 2×2 diagonal matrix is formula_1, while an example of a 3×3 diagonal matrix isformula_2. An identity matrix of any size, or any multiple of it is a diagonal matrix called a &quot;scalar matrix&quot;, for example, formula_3. 
In geometry, a diagonal matrix may be used as a &quot;scaling matrix&quot;, since matrix multiplication with it results in changing scale (size) and possibly also shape; only a scalar matrix results in uniform change in scale.

==Definition==

As stated above, a diagonal matrix is a matrix in which all off-diagonal entries are zero. That is, the matrix with columns and rows is diagonal if
formula_4

However, the main diagonal entries are unrestricted.

The term &quot;diagonal matrix&quot; may sometimes refer to a , which is an -by- matrix with all the entries not of the form being zero. For example:
formula_5

More often, however, &quot;diagonal matrix&quot; refers to square matrices, which can be specified explicitly as a &#x27;. A square diagonal matrix is a symmetric matrix, so this can also be called a &#x27;.

The following matrix is square diagonal matrix:
formula_6

If the entries are real numbers or complex numbers, then it is a normal matrix as well.

In the remainder of this article we will consider only square diagonal matrices, and refer to them simply as &quot;diagonal matrices&quot;.

==Vector-to-matrix diag operator==

A diagonal matrix can be constructed from a vector formula_7 using the formula_8 operator:
formula_9

This may be written more compactly as formula_10.

The same operator is also used to represent block diagonal matrices as formula_11 where each argument is a matrix.

The operator may be written as:
formula_12
where formula_13 represents the Hadamard product and is a constant vector with elements 1.

==Matrix-to-vector diag operator==

The inverse matrix-to-vector operator is sometimes denoted by the identically named formula_14 where the argument is now a matrix and the result is a vector of its diagonal entries. 

The following property holds:
formula_15

== Scalar matrix ==
A diagonal matrix with equal diagonal entries is a scalar matrix; that is, a scalar multiple of the identity matrix . Its effect on a vector is scalar multiplication by . For example, a 3×3 scalar matrix has the form:
formula_16

The scalar matrices are the center of the algebra of matrices: that is, they are precisely the matrices that commute with all other square matrices of the same size. By contrast, over a field (like the real numbers), a diagonal matrix with all diagonal elements distinct only commutes with diagonal matrices (its centralizer is the set of diagonal matrices). That is because if a diagonal matrix formula_17 has formula_18 then given a matrix with formula_19 the term of the products are: formula_20 and formula_21 and formula_22 (since one can divide by ), so they do not commute unless the off-diagonal terms are zero. Diagonal matrices where the diagonal entries are not all equal or all distinct have centralizers intermediate between the whole space and only diagonal matrices.

For an abstract vector space (rather than the concrete vector space ), the analog of scalar matrices are scalar transformations. This is true more generally for a module over a ring , with the endomorphism algebra (algebra of linear operators on ) replacing the algebra of matrices. Formally, scalar multiplication is a linear map, inducing a map formula_23 (from a scalar to its corresponding scalar transformation, multiplication by ) exhibiting as a -algebra. For vector spaces, the scalar transforms are exactly the center of the endomorphism algebra, and, similarly, scalar invertible transforms are the center of the general linear group . The former is more generally true free modules formula_24 for which the endomorphism algebra is isomorphic to a matrix algebra.

== Vector operations ==
Multiplying a vector by a diagonal matrix multiplies each of the terms by the corresponding diagonal entry. Given a diagonal matrix formula_17 and a vector formula_26, the product is:
formula_27

This can be expressed more compactly by using a vector instead of a diagonal matrix, formula_28, and taking the Hadamard product of the vectors (entrywise product), denoted formula_29:

formula_30

This is mathematically equivalent, but avoids storing all the zero terms of this sparse matrix. This product is thus used in machine learning, such as computing products of derivatives in backpropagation or multiplying IDF weights in TF-IDF, since some BLAS frameworks, which multiply matrices efficiently, do not include Hadamard product capability directly.

== Matrix operations ==
The operations of matrix addition and matrix multiplication are especially simple for diagonal matrices. Write for a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries starting in the upper left corner are . Then, for addition, we have

formula_31

and for matrix multiplication,

formula_32

The diagonal matrix is invertible if and only if the entries are all nonzero. In this case, we have

formula_33

In particular, the diagonal matrices form a subring of the ring of all -by- matrices.

Multiplying an -by- matrix from the &quot;left&quot; with amounts to multiplying the -th &quot;row&quot; of by for all ; multiplying the matrix from the &quot;right&quot; with amounts to multiplying the -th &quot;column&quot; of by for all .

== Operator matrix in eigenbasis ==
As explained in determining coefficients of operator matrix, there is a special basis, , for which the matrix takes the diagonal form. Hence, in the defining equation formula_34, all coefficients with are zero, leaving only one term per sum. The surviving diagonal elements, , are known as eigenvalues and designated with in the equation, which reduces to formula_35 The resulting equation is known as eigenvalue equation and used to derive the characteristic polynomial and, further, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

In other words, the eigenvalues of are with associated eigenvectors of .

== Properties ==

* The determinant of is the product .
* The adjugate of a diagonal matrix is again diagonal.
* Where all matrices are square,
** A matrix is diagonal if and only if it is triangular and normal.
** A matrix is diagonal if and only if it is both upper- and lower-triangular.
** A diagonal matrix is symmetric.
* The identity matrix and zero matrix are diagonal.
* A 1×1 matrix is always diagonal.
* The square of a 2×2 matrix with zero trace is always diagonal.

== Applications ==
Diagonal matrices occur in many areas of linear algebra. Because of the simple description of the matrix operation and eigenvalues/eigenvectors given above, it is typically desirable to represent a given matrix or linear map by a diagonal matrix.

In fact, a given -by- matrix is similar to a diagonal matrix (meaning that there is a matrix such that is diagonal) if and only if it has linearly independent eigenvectors. Such matrices are said to be diagonalizable.

Over the field of real or complex numbers, more is true. The spectral theorem says that every normal matrix is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix (if then there exists a unitary matrix such that is diagonal). Furthermore, the singular value decomposition implies that for any matrix , there exist unitary matrices and such that is diagonal with positive entries.

== Operator theory ==
In operator theory, particularly the study of PDEs, operators are particularly easy to understand and PDEs easy to solve if the operator is diagonal with respect to the basis with which one is working; this corresponds to a separable partial differential equation. Therefore, a key technique to understanding operators is a change of coordinates—in the language of operators, an integral transform—which changes the basis to an eigenbasis of eigenfunctions: which makes the equation separable. An important example of this is the Fourier transform, which diagonalizes constant coefficient differentiation operators (or more generally translation invariant operators), such as the Laplacian operator, say, in the heat equation.

Especially easy are multiplication operators, which are defined as multiplication by (the values of) a fixed function–the values of the function at each point correspond to the diagonal entries of a matrix.

<text>Samuel F. O’Reilly (May 1854 - 29 April 1909) was an American tattoo artist from New York, who patented the first electric tattoo machine on December 8, 1891.

== Biography ==
O’Reilly was born in Waterbury, New Haven County, Connecticut, to Irish immigrants Thomas O’Reilly and Mary Ann Hurley in May 1854.

He began tattooing in New York around the mid-1880s, probably mentored by Martin Hildebrandt. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s machine was based on the rotary technology of Thomas Edison&#x27;s autographic printing pen. Although O&#x27;Reilly held the first patent for an electric tattoo machine, tattoo artists had been experimenting with and modifying a variety of different machines prior to the issuance of the patent. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s first pre-patent tattoo machine was a modified dental plugger, which he used to tattoo several dime museum attractions for exhibition between the years 1889 and 1891. From the late 1880s on, tattoo machines continually evolved into the modern tattoo machine. 

O&#x27;Reilly first owned a shop at #5 Chatham Square on the New York Bowery. In 1904, he moved to #11 Chatham Square when the previous tenant, tattoo artist Elmer Getchell, left the city. Charles Wagner was allegedly apprenticed to O&#x27;Reilly and later assumed ownership of his #11 Chatham Square shop.

On April 29, 1909, Samuel O&#x27;Reilly fell while painting his house and died. He is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery, Brooklyn, NY.

<doc id="174088" wikidata="Q9300937" url="?curid=174088" title="Parliament of Northern Ireland">
<text>The Parliament of Northern Ireland was the home rule legislature of Northern Ireland, created under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, which sat from 7 June 1921 to 30 March 1972, when it was suspended because of its inability to restore order during the Troubles, resulting in the introduction of direct rule. It was abolished under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973.

The Parliament of Northern Ireland was bicameral, consisting of a House of Commons with 52 seats, and an indirectly elected Senate with 26 seats. The Sovereign was represented by the Governor (initially by the Lord Lieutenant), who granted royal assent to Acts of Parliament in Northern Ireland, but executive power rested with the Prime Minister, the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons.

==House of Commons==
The House of Commons had 52 members, of which 48 were for territorial seats, and four were for graduates of Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast (until 1969, when the four university seats were replaced by an additional four territorial seats, alongside the abolition of plural voting). The Government of Ireland Act prescribed that elections to the House of Commons should be by single transferable vote (STV), though the Parliament was given the power to alter the electoral system from three years after its first meeting. The STV system was the subject of criticism from grassroots Unionists, but because the three-year period ended during the Labour government of 1924, the Stormont government decided not to provoke the known egalitarian sympathies of many Labour backbenchers and held the second election on the same basis. The loss of eight Unionist seats in that election caused great acrimony, and in 1929, the system was changed to first-past-the-post for all territorial constituencies, though STV was retained for the university seats.

In the 1925 election, however, Republicans also lost four seats and a substantial proportion of votes. Nationalists gained the same number of seats that Republicans had lost, but had only gained a small percentage of votes. It had been felt by some that Northern Ireland should use the same first-past-the-post system that was in place in the rest of the UK.

By the time the first-past-the-post system was implemented for the 1929 election, the Republicans had few or no candidates and pro-separatist electors were represented almost solely by the Nationalist Party. Despite the change in the electoral system and accusations of gerrymandering, the Nationalist Party lost 9.5% share of the vote, but still gained a seat. The more moderate Northern Ireland Labour Party and Ulster Liberal Party both gained in vote share but lost seats.

The boundary changes for 1929 were not made by an impartial boundary commission but by the Unionist government, for which it was accused of gerrymandering. The charges that the Stormont seats (as opposed to local council wards) were gerrymandered against Nationalists is disputed by historians (since the number of Nationalists elected under the two systems barely changed), though it is agreed that losses under the change to single-member constituency boundaries were suffered by independent unionists, the Liberals and the Northern Ireland Labour Party. Population movements were so small that these boundaries were used almost everywhere until the Parliament was dissolved in 1972. In 1968 the government abolished the Queen&#x27;s University constituency (university constituencies had been abolished at Westminster with effect from 1950) and created four new constituencies in the outskirts of Belfast where populations had grown. This change helped the Unionists, as they held only two of the university seats but won all four of the newly created seats. There had, however, long been calls from outside Unionism to abolish the graduate franchise (and other anomalies) and to have &quot;one person one vote&quot;.

==Senate==

The Senate was a last-minute addition to the Parliament, after the original plans for a single Senate covering both the Stormont and Dublin Parliaments were overtaken by events.

Twenty-four senators were elected by the House of Commons using the single transferable vote. The elections were carried out after each general election, with 12 members elected for two parliaments each time. The other two seats were held &quot;ex officio&quot; by the Lord Mayor of Belfast and the Mayor of Derry. The Senate generally had the same party balance as the House of Commons, though abstaining parties and very small parties were not represented. Because of this, and its dependence on the House of Commons for election, it had virtually no political impact.

==The Crown==
The British monarch was originally to have been represented in both Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. However, the replacement of &quot;Southern Ireland&quot; by the Irish Free State led to the abolition of the post of Lord Lieutenant. Instead, a new office – Governor of Northern Ireland – was created on 12 December 1922.

==Location==
Initially the Parliament met in Belfast&#x27;s City Hall but then moved to the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s Assembly&#x27;s College (later Union Theological College), where it remained during the period 1921–1932. The Commons met in the college&#x27;s Gamble Library and the Senate in the chapel. In 1932, Parliament moved to the new purpose-built Parliament Buildings, designed by Sir Arnold Thornely, at Stormont, on the eastern outskirts of the city. &quot;Stormont&quot; came to be a synecdoche referring both to the Parliament itself and to the Northern Ireland government.

==Legislation==
Stormont was given power to legislate over almost all aspects of Northern Ireland life, with only a few matters excluded from its remit, the most important of which are: succession to the Crown, making of peace or war, armed forces, honours, naturalisation, some central taxes and postal services (a full list is in section 4 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920). The Parliament did not try to infringe the terms of the Government of Ireland Act; on only one occasion did the United Kingdom government advise the King to withhold royal assent. This was the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) which abolished proportional representation in local government elections; the issue was referred to London and royal assent was eventually given. The output of legislation was high for a devolved Parliament, though some of the Acts were adaptations of recently passed acts by the United Kingdom parliament. It was nominally prohibited by section 16 of the Schedule to the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 from making any law which directly or indirectly discriminated against a religion, although this provision had little effect.

==Brief history==
The 1921 general election was explicitly fought on the issue of partition, being in effect a referendum on approval of the concept of a Northern Ireland administration. Thereafter, general election timing was up to the Prime Minister. Elections almost always took place at a time when the issue of partition had been raised in a new crisis. This generally guaranteed the loyalty of Protestant voters to the Unionist Party. Independent Unionist candidates and the Northern Ireland Labour Party were usually accused of being splitters or dupes of the Nationalists.

The 1925 general election was called to tie in with the expected report of the Boundary Commission required by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922. The Boundary Commission was expected to recommend the transfer of many border areas to the Irish Free State, and the Unionist election slogan was &quot;Not an Inch!&quot;. They lost eight seats in Belfast and County Antrim, where the issue of the border had far less resonance. Sinn Féin had fought in 1921, but by 1925 was suffering the effects of its split over the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Éamon de Valera&#x27;s Sinn Féin fought as Republicans but won only two seats. The border was never changed.

A minor row erupted in 1925 when the elections to the Senate took place. Eleven Unionists and one Labour Senator were elected, despite there being a block of three composed of two non-abstaining Nationalists and a dissident Unionist. The latter three had mailed their votes, but due to a public holiday and the practices of the postal service, they arrived an hour after the election. Requests for a recount were denied. (It is doubtful whether the three votes would have been sufficient to elect a Senator under the election system, since they would not have achieved a complete single transferable vote quota alone and the Unionist votes were likely to transfer so heavily to each other that the Nationalist candidate would not reach quota throughout the rounds of counting.) From later in 1925 to 1927, the Nationalist Party members took their seats for the first time.

For the 1929 general election the Unionists replaced the proportional representation system blamed for their bad performance in 1925. The new boundaries set the pattern for politics until Stormont was abolished; the Unionists never fell below 33 seats. In the 1930s, the phrase &quot;A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People&quot; was a debated term. The 1938 general election was called when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Neville Chamberlain was negotiating a settlement of outstanding disputes with Éamon de Valera, whose new constitution laid claim to Northern Ireland, and the 1949 election was called when the Irish government declared itself a republic.

During the Second World War, the Stormont government called on Westminster to introduce conscription several times, as this was already the case in Great Britain. The British government consistently refused, remembering how a similar attempt in 1918 had backfired dramatically, as nationalist opposition made it unworkable. Much of the population of serving age were either in essential jobs or had already joined up voluntarily, making the potential yield of conscription low.

1965 saw a significant change, in that the Nationalists accepted office as the Official Opposition. This was intended as a reward for the attempts made by Terence O&#x27;Neill to end discrimination against Catholics and normalise relations with the Republic. However, the Unionists split over O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s tentative reforms at the 1969 general election and Ian Paisley&#x27;s Protestant Unionist Party began to win by-elections. The new nationalist party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, withdrew from Stormont in July 1971 over the refusal of an inquiry into Royal Ulster Constabulary actions in Derry.

Stormont was abolished and Direct Rule from Westminster was introduced in March 1972, just six weeks after Bloody Sunday, when the Unionist government refused to hand over responsibility for law and order to Westminster. In its 50-year history, only one piece of legislation was passed that was introduced by a Nationalist member, the Wild Birds Protection Act. In October 1971, as the Troubles worsened, Gerard Newe had been appointed as a junior minister at Stormont, in an attempt to improve community relations. Fifty years after it came into existence, Newe was the first Catholic to serve in a Northern Ireland government, but because he was neither an MP nor a Senator, his appointment could last only six months.

The influence of the Orange Order in the governance of Northern Ireland was far-reaching. All of the six prime ministers of Northern Ireland were members of the Order, as were all but three cabinet ministers until 1969. Three of the ministers later left the Order, one because his daughter married a Catholic, one to become Minister of Community Relations in 1970, and the third was expelled for attending a Catholic religious ceremony. Of the 95 Stormont MPs who did not become cabinet ministers, 87 were Orangemen. Every unionist senator, with one exception, between 1921 and 1969 was an Orangeman. One of these senators, James Gyle, was suspended from the Order for seven years for visiting nationalist MP Joe Devlin on his deathbed.

<doc id="174089" wikidata="Q714049" url="?curid=174089" title="Kuroda Kiyotaka">
<text>Count was a Japanese politician and general who served as prime minister of Japan from 1888 to 1889. He was one of the &quot;genrō&quot;, or senior statesman of the Meiji era. Born in the Satsuma Domain to a samurai family, Kuroda was involved in the colonization of Hokkaido, the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, and the suppression of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877. After his tenure as prime minister, which ended due to his inability to revise the unequal treaties imposed on Japan, Kuroda also served as Minister of Communications and President of the Privy Council.

==Biography==

===As a Satsuma samurai===
Kuroda was born to a samurai-class family serving the Shimazu &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kagoshima, Satsuma Domain, in Kyūshū.

In 1862, Kuroda was involved in the Namamugi incident, in which Satsuma retainers killed a British national who refused to bow down to the &quot;daimyo&#x27;s&quot; procession. This led to the Anglo-Satsuma War in 1863, in which Kuroda played an active role. Immediately after the war, he went to Edo where he studied gunnery.

Returning to Satsuma, Kuroda became an active member of the Satsuma-Chōshū joint effort to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate. Later, as a military leader in the Boshin War, he became famous for sparing the life of Enomoto Takeaki, who had stood against Kuroda&#x27;s army at the Battle of Hakodate.

===Political and diplomatic career===
Under the new Meiji government, Kuroda in 1870 became a pioneer-diplomat to Sakhalin, then known in Japanese as Karafuto and claimed by both Japan and the Russian Empire. Terrified of Russia&#x27;s push eastward, Kuroda returned to Tokyo and advocated quick development and settlement of Japan&#x27;s northern frontier.

In 1871, he traveled to Europe and the United States for five months, and upon returning to Japan in 1872, he was put in charge of colonization efforts in Hokkaidō.

In 1874, Kuroda was named director of the Hokkaidō Colonization Office, and organized a colonist-militia scheme to settle the island with unemployed ex-samurai and retired soldiers who would serve as both farmers and as a local militia. He was also promoted to lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army. Kuroda invited agricultural experts from overseas countries with a similar climate to visit Hokkaidō, and to provide advice on what crops and production methods might be successful.

Kuroda was dispatched as an envoy to Korea in 1875, and negotiated the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876. In 1877, he was sent as part of the force to suppress the Satsuma Rebellion. In 1878, he became de facto leader of Satsuma Domain following the assassination of Ōkubo Toshimichi.

Shortly before he left office in Hokkaidō, Kuroda became the central figure in the Hokkaidō Colonization Office Scandal of 1881. As part of the government&#x27;s privatization program, Kuroda attempted to sell the assets of the Hokkaidō Colonization Office to a trading consortium created by some of his former Satsuma colleagues for a nominal price. When the terms of the sale were leaked to the press, the resultant public outrage caused the sale to fall through. Also in 1881, Kuroda&#x27;s wife died of a lung disease, but on rumors that Kuroda had killed her in a drunken rage, the body was exhumed and examined. Kuroda was cleared of charges, but rumors of his problems with alcohol abuse persisted.
In 1887, Kuroda was appointed to the cabinet post of Minister of Agriculture and Commerce.

===Prime minister===
Kuroda Kiyotaka became the 2nd Prime Minister of Japan, after Itō Hirobumi in 1888. During his term, he oversaw the promulgation of the Meiji Constitution. However, the vexing issue of Japan&#x27;s inability to secure revision of the unequal treaties created considerable controversy. After drafts of proposed revisions drawn up by his foreign minister Ōkuma Shigenobu became public in 1889, the plan to appoint foreigners as judicial officers to abolish consular jurisdiction met with great opposition, and on 18 October a bombing occurred. In response to this, nearly all cabinet members abandoned amending the treaty, and Kuroda had no choice but to agree. On 25 October, Kuroda was forced to resign. He was succeeded by Sanjō Sanetomi as acting prime minister. Then, on 24 December 1889, Yamagata Aritomo, an army Field Marshal (Gensui) became the next prime minister of Japan.

===Later life===
Kuroda served as Minister of Communications in 1892 under the 2nd Ito Cabinet. In 1895 he became a &quot;genrō&quot;, and chairman of the Privy Council. 

Kuroda died of a brain hemorrhage in 1900 and Enomoto Takeaki presided over his funeral ceremonies. His grave is at the Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

<doc id="174091" wikidata="Q6770124" url="?curid=174091" title="Mark V. Shaney">
<text>Mark V. Shaney is a synthetic Usenet user whose postings in the &quot;net.singles&quot; newsgroups were generated by Markov chain techniques, based on text from other postings. The username is a play on the words &quot;Markov chain&quot;. Many readers were fooled into thinking that the quirky, sometimes uncannily topical posts were written by a real person.

The system was designed by Rob Pike with coding by Bruce Ellis. Don P. Mitchell wrote the Markov chain code, initially demonstrating it to Pike and Ellis using the Tao Te Ching as a basis. They chose to apply it to the &quot;net.singles&quot; codice_1 group.

The program is fairly simple. It ingests the sample text (the Tao Te Ching, or the posts of a Usenet group) and creates a massive list of every sequence of three successive words (triplet) which occurs in the text. It then chooses two words at random, and looks for a word which follows those two in one of the triplets in its massive list. If there is more than one, it picks at random (identical triplets count separately, so a sequence which occurs twice is twice as likely to be picked as one which only occurs once). It then adds that word to the generated text.

Then, in the same way, it picks a triplet that starts with the second and third words in the generated text, and that gives a fourth word. It adds the fourth word, then repeats with the third and fourth words, and so on. This algorithm is called a third-order Markov chain (because it uses sequences of three words).

==Examples==
A classic example, from 1984, originally sent as a mail message, later posted to net.singles is reproduced here:

Other quotations from Mark&#x27;s Usenet posts are:

*&quot;I spent an interesting evening recently with a grain of salt.&quot; (Alternatively reported as &quot;While at a conference a few weeks back, I spent an interesting evening with a grain of salt.&quot;)
*&quot;I hope that there are sour apples in every bushel.&quot; (see also sour grapes)

==History==
In &quot;The Usenet Handbook&quot; Mark Harrison writes that after September 1981, students joined Usenet &quot;en masse&quot;, &quot;creating the USENET we know today: endless dumb questions, endless idiots posing as savants, and (of course) endless victims for practical jokes.&quot; In December, Rob Pike created the codice_1 group &quot;net.suicide&quot; as prank, &quot;a forum for bad jokes&quot;. Some users thought it was a legitimate forum, some discussed &quot;riding motorcycles without helmets&quot;. At first, most posters were &quot;real people&quot;, but soon &quot;characters&quot; began posting. Pike created a &quot;vicious&quot; character named Bimmler. At its peak, &quot;net.suicide&quot; had ten frequent posters; nine were &quot;known to be characters.&quot; But ultimately, Pike deleted the newsgroup because it was too much work to maintain; Bimmler messages were created &quot;by hand&quot;. The &quot;obvious alternative&quot; was software, running on a Bell Labs computer created by Bruce Ellis, based on the Markov code by Don Mitchell, which became the online character Mark V. Shaney.

Kernighan and Pike listed Mark V. Shaney in the acknowledgements in &quot;The Practice of Programming&quot;, noting its roots in Mitchell&#x27;s codice_3, which, adapted as codice_4, was used for &quot;humorous deconstructionist activities&quot; in the 1980s.

Dewdney pointed out &quot;perhaps Mark V. Shaney&#x27;s magnum opus: a 20-page commentary on the deconstructionist philosophy of Jean Baudrillard&quot; directed by Pike, with assistance from Henry S. Baird and Catherine Richards, to be distributed by email. The piece was based on Jean Baudrillard&#x27;s &quot;The Precession of Simulacra&quot;, published in &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot; (1981).

==Reception==
The program was discussed by A. K. Dewdney in the &quot;Scientific American&quot; &quot;Computer Recreations&quot; column in 1989, by Penn Jillette in his &quot;PC Computing&quot; column in 1991, and in several books, including the &quot;Usenet Handbook&quot;, &quot;Bots: the Origin of New Species&quot;, &quot;Hippo Eats Dwarf: A Field Guide to Hoaxes and Other B.S.&quot;, and non-computer-related journals such as &quot;Texas Studies in Literature and Language&quot;.

Dewdney wrote about the program&#x27;s output, &quot;The overall impression is not unlike what remains in the brain of an inattentive student after a late-night study session. Indeed, after reading the output of Mark V. Shaney, I find ordinary writing almost equally strange and incomprehensible!&quot; He noted the reactions of newsgroup users, who have &quot;shuddered at Mark V. Shaney&#x27;s reflections, some with rage and others with laughter:&quot; 

The opinions of the new &quot;net.singles&quot; correspondent drew mixed reviews. Serious users of the bulletin board&#x27;s services sensed satire. Outraged, they urged that someone &quot;pull the plug&quot; on Mark V. Shaney&#x27;s monstrous rantings. Others inquired almost admiringly whether the program was a secret artificial intelligence project that was being tested in a human conversational environment. A few may even have thought that Mark V. Shaney was a real person, a tortured schizophrenic desperately seeking a like-minded companion. 
Concluding, Dewdney wrote, &quot;If the purpose of computer prose is to fool people into thinking that it was written by a sane person, Mark V. Shaney probably falls short.&quot;

A 2012 article in &quot;Observer&quot; compared Mark V. Shaney&#x27;s &quot;strangely beautiful&quot; postings to the Horse_ebooks account on Twitter and music reviews at &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, saying that &quot;this mash-up of gibberish and human sentiment&quot; is what &quot;made Mark V. Shaney so endlessly fascinating&quot;.

<doc id="174094" wikidata="Q2468684" url="?curid=174094" title="Microsoft Messenger service">
<text>Messenger (formerly MSN Messenger Service, .NET Messenger Service and Windows Live Messenger Service) was an instant messaging and presence system developed by Microsoft in 1999 for use with its MSN Messenger software. It was used by instant messaging clients including Windows 8, Windows Live Messenger, Microsoft Messenger for Mac, Outlook.com and Xbox Live. Third-party clients also connected to the service. It communicated using the Microsoft Notification Protocol, a proprietary instant messaging protocol. The service allowed anyone with a Microsoft account to sign in and communicate in real time with other people who were signed in as well.

On January 11, 2013, Microsoft announced that they were retiring the existing Messenger service globally (except for mainland China where Messenger will continue to be available) and replacing it with Skype. In April 2013, Microsoft merged the service into Skype; existing users were able to sign into Skype with their existing accounts and access their contact list. As part of the merger, Skype&#x27;s instant messaging functionality is now running on the backbone of the former Messenger service.
==Background==
Despite multiple name changes to the service and its client software over the years, the Messenger service is often referred to colloquially as &quot;MSN&quot;, due to the history of MSN Messenger. The service itself was known as MSN Messenger Service from 1999 to 2001, at which time, Microsoft changed its name to .NET Messenger Service and began offering clients that no longer carried the &quot;MSN&quot; name, such as the Windows Messenger client included with Windows XP, which was originally intended to be a streamlined version of MSN Messenger, free of advertisements and integrated into Windows.

Nevertheless, the company continued to offer more upgrades to MSN Messenger until the end of 2005, when all previous versions of MSN Messenger and Windows Messenger were superseded by a new program, Windows Live Messenger, as part of Microsoft&#x27;s launch of its Windows Live online services.

For several years, the official name for the service remained .NET Messenger Service, as indicated on its official network status web page, though Microsoft rarely used the name to promote the service. Because the main client used to access the service became known as Windows Live Messenger, Microsoft started referring to the entire service as the Windows Live Messenger Service in its support documentation in the mid-2000s.

The service can integrate with the Windows operating system, automatically and simultaneously signing into the network as the user logs into their Windows account. Organizations can also integrate their Microsoft Office Communications Server and Active Directory with the service. In December 2011, Microsoft released an XMPP interface to the Messenger service.

As part of a larger effort to rebrand many of its Windows Live services, Microsoft began referring to the service as simply Messenger in 2012.

==Software==

===Official clients===
Microsoft offered the following instant messaging clients that connected to the Messenger service:
* Windows Live Messenger, for users of Windows 7 and previous versions
** MSN Messenger was the former name of the client from 1999 to 2006
** Windows Messenger is a scaled-down client that was included with Windows XP in 2001
* Microsoft Messenger for Mac, for users of Mac OS X
* Outlook.com includes web browser-based functionality for instant messaging
** Hotmail, the predecessor to Outlook.com, includes similar functionality for Messenger
** Windows Live Web Messenger was a web-based program for use through Internet Explorer
** MSN Web Messenger was the former name of the web-based client
* Windows 8, includes a built-in Messaging client
* Xbox Live includes access to the Messenger service from within the Xbox Dashboard
* MSN TV (formerly WebTV) had a built-in messaging client available on the original WebTV/MSN TV and MSN TV 2 devices, which was originally introduced via a Summer 2000 software update
* Messenger on Windows Phone includes access to the Messenger service from within a phone running Windows Phone
* Windows Live Messenger for iPhone and iPod Touch includes access to the Messenger service from within an iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad
* Windows Live Messenger for Nokia includes access to the Messenger service from within a Nokia phone
* Messenger Play! includes access to the Messenger service from within an Android phone or tablet
* Windows Live Messenger for BlackBerry includes access to the Messenger service from within a BlackBerry

==Security concerns==
A 2007 analysis of Messenger&#x27;s Microsoft Notification Protocol, which is unencrypted, concluded that its design &quot;did not follow several principles of designing secure systems&quot;, resulting in a &quot;plethora of security vulnerabilities&quot;; these vulnerabilities were demonstrated by successfully spoofing a user&#x27;s identity.

<doc id="174095" wikidata="Q43426" url="?curid=174095" title="Indecent exposure">
<text>Indecent exposure is the deliberate public exposure by a person of a portion of their body in a manner contrary to local standards of appropriate behavior. Laws and social attitudes regarding indecent exposure vary significantly in different countries. It ranges from outright prohibition of the exposure of any body parts other than the hands or face to prohibition of exposure of certain body parts, such as the genital area, buttocks or breasts.

Decency is generally judged by the standards of the local community, which are seldom codified in specifics in law. Such standards may be based on religion, morality or tradition, or justified on the basis of &quot;necessary to public order&quot;. Non-sexual exhibitionism or public nudity is sometimes considered indecent exposure. If sexual acts are performed, with or without an element of nudity, this can be considered gross indecency in some jurisdictions, which is usually a more serious criminal offence. In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of modesty is also considered to be public indecency.

The legal and community standards of what states of undress constitute indecent exposure vary considerably and depend on the context in which the exposure takes place. These standards have also varied over time, making the definition of indecent exposure a complex topic.

== History ==

What is an inappropriate state of dress in a particular context depends on the standards of decency of the community where an exposure takes place. These standards vary from time to time and can vary from the very strict standards of modesty in places such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, which require most of the body to be covered, to tribal societies such as the Pirahã or Mursi where full nakedness is the norm. There is generally no implication that the state of dress objected to is of a sexual nature; and if such an allegation were to be made, the act would generally be described as &quot;gross indecency&quot;.

The standards of decency have varied over time. During the Victorian era, for example, exposure of a woman&#x27;s legs, and to some extent the arms, was considered indecent in much of the Western world. Hair was sometimes required to be covered in formal occasions as in the form of a hat or bonnet. As late as the 1930s – and to some extent, the 1950s – both women and men were expected to bathe or swim in public places wearing bathing suits that covered above the waist. An adult woman exposing her navel was also considered indecent in parts of the West into the 1960s and 1970s, and even as late as the 1980s. Moral values changed drastically during the 1990s and 2000s, which in turn changed the criteria for indecent exposure. Public exposure of the navel has been accepted during the 1990s, while in the 2000s, exposure of the buttocks while wearing a thong at a beach became acceptable. Female toplessness, however, has become more taboo in recent decades; for many years it was quite common for women to go topless at public beaches throughout Europe and South America and even some parts of the United States.

== Breastfeeding ==

Breastfeeding in public does not constitute indecent exposure under the laws of the United States, Canada, Australia, or Great Britain. In the United States, the federal government and all 50 states have enacted laws specifically protecting nursing mothers from harassment by others. Legislation ranges from simply exempting breastfeeding from laws regarding indecent exposure, to outright full protection of the right to nurse.

== Public clothing ==

Public clothing varies by country and may be regulated by law. What parts of the body must be covered varies by region. Although genitals are usually expected to be covered in public in almost all societies, when it comes to other parts of the body such as female breasts, midriff, legs or shoulders, norms vary. For example, in some African cultures, it is the thighs, not the breasts, that must be covered. In some societies, the head hair, especially female, must be covered, usually with a scarf. The vast majority of cultures accept that the face can and must be seen, but some cultures (especially in the Middle East) require that a woman&#x27;s face be covered under a burqa. In conservative societies, appearing in a public place in clothing that is deemed &#x27;indecent&#x27; is illegal. In many countries there are exceptions to the general rules (social or legal) regarding clothing. For instance, a country that generally prohibits full nudity may allow it in designated places, such as nude beaches, or during various social events such as festivals or nude protests.

== Outraging public decency ==

&quot;Outraging public decency&quot; is a common law offence in England and Wales. It is a broader offence than indecent exposure, but can only be committed in a public place where at least two people are present, who need not actually witness it.

== Africa ==

=== Namibia ===

Namibian authorities announced that foreign tourists who were nude while visiting the Namib-Naukluft National Park would be banned from all national parks.

== Asia ==

=== Saudi Arabia ===

Women in Saudi Arabia were required to wear robes and a headscarf when in public, although Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said that it is not required. In September 2019, Saudi Arabia issued the public decency law identifying the rules related to the public decency that citizens and tourists should follow in compliance with Saudi law.

== Europe ==

Attitudes towards nudity vary by country and are generally most relaxed in Scandinavia, where genitals and breasts are not normally considered indecent or obscene. Hence, laws and societal views on public nudity are generally relaxed. In Finland, it is very typical for patrons to bathe nude in the intense heat of saunas.

In the Netherlands, public nudity is allowed at sites that have been assigned by the local authorities and &quot;other suitable places&quot;. On nudist beaches, in unisex saunas and in swimming pool changing rooms, remaining partially clothed is frowned upon and the social norm is to undress.

In Barcelona, public nudity was a recognised right. However, on 30 April 2011, the Barcelona City Council voted a by-law forbidding walking &quot;naked or nearly naked in public spaces&quot; and limiting the wearing of bathing costumes to pools, beaches, adjacent streets and sea-side walks.

Other countries, such as the UK, Ireland or Poland, are more conservative.

=== United Kingdom ===

The law concerning public nudity varies among the countries of the United Kingdom. In England and Wales, public nudity is not generally illegal, unless intended to alarm or distress members of the public.
In some places, such as Henley-on-Thames, local bye-laws criminalise naked bathing in the river or sea, with a fine which has remained unchanged since the nineteenth century and is now trivial.
Concerns that the police do not take &quot;indecent exposure&quot; sufficiently seriously are matched by other opinions that public nudity is natural and proper. Cases occasionally come before magistrates&#x27; courts, with varying outcomes.

==== England and Wales ====

During the 19th and 20th centuries, indecent exposure was prosecuted under section 28 of the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 or section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824. The latter contained a provision for the prosecution of:
This provision, and the nudity provision of the 1824 Vagrancy Act, were repealed by Schedule 7, s.140 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. They were replaced by an offence that is both gender neutral, and more specific and explicit, 66 Exposure.
It is defined as

The maximum penalty is two years&#x27; imprisonment, very rare as most cases are dealt with by a fine or through community service. If sentenced to a term of imprisonment or a community order in excess of 12 months such convicts (offenders) – or if the person they exposed themselves to was aged under 18 years old – they must appear on and sign the Violent and Sex Offender Register.

In the past public nudity in England and Wales could also be punished as &quot;disorderly behaviour&quot; under the Public Order Act 1986, sections 4A and 5. However, the law was clarified in the spring of 2018 and those sections are no longer considered to apply to simple public nudity. Guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service and the College of Policing does not recommend prosecution for public nudity if there is no implied intent to cause alarm (or distress). Intention can be inferred by circumstantial evidence; see Intention in English law.

Occasional &quot;streaking&quot; by naked exhibitionists running across public sports fields is often enthusiastically applauded by the spectators, so negating any intention to cause alarm or distress. 
A common defence on arrest for indecent exposure is the innocent intent to urinate, but that may be prosecuted as a public nuisance. (At Holborn viaduct an old painted notice warns &quot;Commit No Nuisance&quot;).

==== Scotland ====

Under Scots law, &quot;indecent conduct&quot; in a public place, such as exposing the genitals or engaging in sexual activity, can constitute the common law offence of public indecency. Stephen Gough, a man known as the &quot;Naked Rambler&quot; who hiked across Britain wearing only shoes, was arrested numerous times in Scotland. He was convicted of the common law offence of breach of the peace and spent time in prison for contempt of court for refusing to wear clothes whilst in court.

==== Northern Ireland ====

The Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 brought the legislation regarding indecent exposure in Northern Ireland into line with that in England and Wales.

=== Germany ===

In Germany and Switzerland there is a culture of Freikörperkultur which means that there are many public spaces where you are welcome to be naked.

== North America ==

=== Canada ===

In Canada, s.173 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; prohibits &quot;indecent acts&quot;. There is no statutory definition in the Code of what constitutes an indecent act, other than the exposure of the genitals and/or female nipples for a sexual purpose to anyone under 16 years of age. Thus, the decision of what states of undress are &quot;indecent&quot;, and thereby unlawful, is left to judges. Judges have held, for example, that nude sunbathing is not indecent. Also, streaking is similarly not regarded as indecent. Section 174 prohibits nudity if it offends &quot;against public decency or order&quot; and in view of the public. The courts have found that nude swimming is not offensive under this definition.

Toplessness is also not an indecent act under s.173. In 1991, Gwen Jacob was arrested for walking in a street in Guelph, Ontario, while topless. She was acquitted in 1996 by the Ontario Court of Appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent. The case has been referred to in subsequent cases for the proposition that the mere act of public nudity is not sexual or indecent or an offense. Since then, it is legal for a female to walk topless in public anywhere in Ontario, Canada.

=== United States ===

The laws governing indecent exposure in the United States vary according to location. In most states, public nudity is illegal. However, in some states, it is only illegal if it is accompanied by an intent to shock, arouse, or offend other persons. Some states permit local governments to set local standards. Most states exempt breastfeeding mothers from prosecution.

The phenomenon widely known as flashing, involving a woman exposing bare nipples by suddenly pulling up her shirt and bra, is public exposure and is therefore defined by statute in many states of the United States as prohibited criminal behavior.

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===

In Australia, it is a summary or criminal offence in some States and Territories to expose one&#x27;s genitals (also referred to as &quot;his or her person&quot;) in a public place or in view of a public place. In some jurisdictions, exposure of the genitals alone does not constitute an offence unless accompanied by an indecent act, indecent behaviour, grossly indecent behaviour, obscenity, intention to cause offence, or deliberate intention. The applicable law is different in each jurisdiction and in several jurisdictions the offence of indecent exposure does not apply.

Penalties vary between jurisdictions and are summarised below. Specific state Acts, are as follows:
*Australian Capital Territory – &quot;Crimes Act&quot; 1900, section 393 – &#x27;indecent exposure&#x27; – penalty 12 months. Under the &quot;Nudity Act&quot; 1976, the responsible minister may declare a public area where public nudity is permitted.
*New South Wales – &quot;Summary Offences Act&quot; 1988, section 5 – &#x27;wilful and obscene exposure&#x27; – penalty six months.
*Northern Territory – &quot;Summary Offences Act&quot;, section 50 – &#x27;indecent exposure&#x27; – penalty 6 months.
*South Australia – &quot;Summary Offences Act&quot; 1953, section 23 – &#x27;Indecent behaviour and gross indecency&#x27; – penalty three months and six months respectively.
*Queensland – &quot;Summary Offences Act&quot; 2005 No. 4, section 9 – &#x27;wilful exposure&#x27; – penalty 12 months.
*Tasmania – &quot;Police Offences Act&quot; 1935, section 21 – &#x27;Prohibited behaviour&#x27; – penalty 12 months. &quot;Police Offences Act&quot; 1935, section 14 – &#x27;Public decency&#x27; – one penalty unit.
*Victoria – &quot;Summary Offences Act&quot; 1966, section 19 – &#x27;wilful and obscene exposure&#x27; – penalty two years. Under the &quot;Nudity (Prescribed Areas) Act&quot; 1983 the responsible minister may declare a public area where public nudity is permitted.
*Western Australia – &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, section 203 – &#x27;Indecent acts in public&#x27; – criminal penalty two years. Summary conviction penalty: 9 months and fine of $9,000.

==== Definition of &quot;person&quot; ====

The laws of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory use the term &quot;person&quot;, while in the other States the exposure refers to the genital area. It has been noted that a term such as &quot;exposing one&#x27;s person&quot; relates back to the United Kingdom &quot;Vagrancy Act&quot; 1824 and &quot;Evans v Ewels&quot; (1972) where it was said that the word &quot;person&quot; was a genteel synonym for &quot;penis&quot; or &quot;vulva&quot;. However, it has been suggested that the word &quot;person&quot; in s5 of the (NSW) &quot;Summary Offences Act&quot; is not limited to &quot;penis&quot; or &quot;vulva&quot;. For example, in &quot;R v Eyles&quot; (1997) the offender was seen masturbating in his front garden and charged with obscene exposure under the NSW Act. The judge noted, &quot;obiter dicta&quot;, that

=== Fiji ===

Public nudity is illegal in Fiji.

=== New Zealand ===

In New Zealand, indecent exposure is considered to be where a person &quot;intentionally and obscenely exposes any part of his or her genitals&quot;. Otherwise there is no specific law prohibiting nudity in public places, although lesser charges may apply depending on the behaviour of the individual in question.

The High Court of New Zealand has upheld a conviction of disorderly conduct for nudity in the street, because it was not a place where nudity was known to occur or commonplace. Being nude in the street is likely to incur a small fine if a complaint is made against the person, or if the person ignores a police request to cover themselves. Being prosecuted for nudity on a public beach, or any place where nudity might be expected, is very unlikely.

<text>Windows Messenger is a discontinued instant messaging client included in Windows XP. Designed for use by both corporate and home users, it was originally created, in 2001, as a streamlined and integrated version of MSN Messenger. It was upgraded several times when it was made available for Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003. Since then, its development stopped. It was superseded by Windows Live Messenger and Microsoft Lync.

==Overview==
Windows Messenger was introduced in Windows XP on October 22, 2001. It is enabled by default. Its features include instant messaging, presence awareness, support for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), file transfer, application sharing and whiteboarding. Later versions added &quot;ink&quot; support and integration with Microsoft Lync Server (formerly Microsoft Office Communications Server). Windows Messenger&#x27;s user interface is devoid of the clutter seen in Windows Live Messenger. Winks, nudges, and custom emoticons are unavailable, and the main user interface more closely resembles the standard Windows XP Luna style.

Windows Messenger integrates with Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Remote Assistance and Windows Media Center in Windows XP. Windows Messenger can communicate with the Exchange Server 2000&#x27;s Instant Messaging Service and Microsoft Messenger Service. Interoperability with third-party software is exposed through a COM API called the &quot;Real Time Communications (RTC) Client API&quot;.

Development of Windows Messenger was halted after version 5.1 in favor of Windows Live Messenger and Microsoft Lync.

<text>Compiled language categorizes a programming language as used with a compiler and generally implies not used with an interpreter. But, since any language can theoretically be compiled or interpreted the term lacks clarity. In practice, for some languages there are both compilers and interpreters. In some environments, source code is first compiled to an intermediate form (e.g., bytecode) and then interpreted.

<doc id="174102" wikidata="Q1191952" url="?curid=174102" title="Home rule">
<text>Home rule is the government of a colony, dependent country, or region by its own citizens. It is thus the power of a part (administrative division) of a state or an external dependent country to exercise such of the state&#x27;s powers of governance within its own administrative area that have been decentralized to it by the central government. Home rule may govern in an autonomous administrative division; in contrast, though, there is no sovereignty separate from that of the parent state, and thus no separate chief military command nor separate foreign policy and diplomacy.

In the British Isles, it traditionally referred to self-government, devolution or independence of the countries of the United Kingdom—initially Ireland, and later Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In the United States and other countries organised as federations of states, the term usually refers to the process and mechanisms of self-government as exercised by municipalities, counties, or other units of local government at the level below that of a federal state (e.g., U.S. state, in which context see special legislation). It can also refer to the system under which the Faroe Islands and Greenland are associated with Denmark.

Home rule is not, however, equivalent to federalism. Whereas states in a federal system of government (e.g., Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Switzerland, and the United States) have a guaranteed constitutional existence, a devolved home rule system of government is created by ordinary legislation and can be reformed, or even abolished, by repeal or amendment of that ordinary legislation.

A legislature may, for example, create home rule for an administrative division, such as a province, a county, or a department, so that a local county council, county commission, parish council, or board of supervisors may have jurisdiction over its unincorporated areas, including important issues like zoning. Without this, the division is simply an extension of the higher government. The legislature can also establish or eliminate municipal corporations, which have home rule within town or city limits through the city council. The higher government could also abolish counties/townships, redefine their boundaries, or dissolve their home-rule governments, according to the relevant laws.

== Denmark ==
=== Faroe Islands ===
The Faroe Islands is a self-governing country in the Danish Realm. Home rule was granted by the Parliament of Denmark in 1948, after a failed attempt of the Faroese to gain complete independence, with further autonomy granted in 2005. Denmark&#x27;s monarch is the Faroese head of state. , The Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union, even though Denmark is.

=== Greenland ===
Greenland is a self-governing country in the Danish Realm. Following a referendum in Greenland where the majority favored a higher degree of autonomy, home rule was granted by the Parliament of Denmark in 1979. After another referendum, further autonomy was granted in 2009. Denmark&#x27;s monarch is Greenland&#x27;s head of state. Greenland is not part of the European Union, even though Denmark is.

== India ==
Several nationalist leaders banded together in 1916 under the leadership of Annie Besant to voice a demand for self-government, and to obtain the status of a dominion within the British Empire as enjoyed by Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Newfoundland at the time.

While enjoying considerable popularity for some years, its growth and activity were stalled by the rise of Mohandas Gandhi and his &quot;satyagraha&quot; art of revolution: non-violent, but mass-based civil disobedience, aimed at complete independence. Nonetheless, when Indian independence came in 1947, the new state was the Dominion of India. After three years, the Nehru Government ushered through the permanent Constitution of India creating a republic.

== Ireland ==
The issue of Irish home rule was the dominant political question of British and Irish politics at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.

From the late nineteenth century, Irish leaders of the Home Rule League, the predecessor of the Irish Parliamentary Party, under Isaac Butt, William Shaw, and Charles Stewart Parnell demanded a form of home rule, with the creation of an Irish parliament within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. This demand led to the eventual introduction of four Home Rule Bills, of which two were passed, the Government of Ireland Act 1914 won by John Redmond and most notably the Government of Ireland Act 1920 (which created the home rule parliaments of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland – the latter state did not in reality function and was replaced by the Irish Free State).

The home rule demands of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century differed from earlier demands for Repeal by Daniel O&#x27;Connell in the first half of the nineteenth century. Whereas home rule meant a constitutional movement towards an Irish parliament under the ultimate sovereignty of Westminster, in much the same manner as Canada, New Zealand, or the much later Scottish devolution process, &quot;repeal&quot; meant the repeal of the 1801 Act of Union (if need be, by physical force) and the creation of an entirely independent Irish state, separated from the United Kingdom, with only a shared monarch joining them; in essence, Home Rule would see Ireland become an autonomous region within the United Kingdom, while repeal would give the island a status more akin to a Dominion, an independent nation tied to Britain by a shared monarch.

* 1886: First Irish Home Rule Bill was defeated in the House of Commons.
* 1893: Second Irish Home Rule Bill passed by the House of Commons, vetoed in the House of Lords.
* 1914: Third Irish Home Rule Bill passed to the statute books, temporarily suspended by intervention of World War I (1914–1918), finally following the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916).
* 1920: Government of Ireland Act 1920 (Government of Ireland Act 1920) fully implemented in Northern Ireland and partially implemented in Southern Ireland.

Senior Liberals Lord Hartington and Joseph Chamberlain led the battle against Home Rule in Parliament. They broke with the Liberal leader William Ewart Gladstone who insisted on Home Rule, and in 1886 formed a new party, the Liberal Unionist Party. It helped defeat Home Rule and eventually merged with the Conservative party. Chamberlain used anti-Catholicism to build a base for the new party among &quot;Orange&quot; Nonconformist Protestant elements in Britain and Ireland. Liberal Unionist John Bright coined the party&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Home rule means Rome rule.&quot; Ultimately, the Irish Free State was established in 1922 as an independent Dominion sharing the British monarch as head of state, though Northern Ireland was separated from the new state and gained its own Home Rule Parliament which existed until 1972 (The current Northern Ireland Assembly was created in 1998; between 1972 and 1998, Northern Ireland was under direct rule from Westminster).

== United Kingdom ==
===England===
English home rule has been discussed in relation to proposals for constitutional changes regarding England following the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.

=== Scotland ===
In a similar fashion to Ireland, supporters of home rule in Scotland have historically desired greater levels of devolved governance within the United Kingdom. Although the term &#x27;home rule&#x27; has been largely superseded by &quot;devolution,&quot; the home rule movement can be seen as the forerunner to the creation of the current devolved Scottish Parliament.

Administrative devolution was granted to Scotland, with the creation of the Scottish Office, in 1885. In the mid-20th century, the home rule movement became significant, campaigning for a Scottish assembly. Between 1947 and 1950, the Scottish Covenant, a petition requesting a Scottish legislature within the UK, received over two million signatures. It was not until 1979 that devolution entered the political sphere – the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum was held. Despite a vote of 51.6% in favour of devolution, the Scotland Act 1978 was not put into effect due to a requirement that the &#x27;Yes&#x27; vote receive the support of 40% of the electorate, which was not met on 63.8% turnout. In 1999, due to the success of a second referendum, the Scottish Parliament was created.

=== Wales ===
== United States ==
=== District of Columbia ===
The U.S. Constitution gives jurisdiction over the capital city (District of Columbia or Washington, D.C.) to the United States Congress in &quot;all cases whatsoever&quot;. This jurisdiction necessitated that the District not be a state, nor part of a state. At certain times, and currently since 1973, Congress has provided for D.C. government to be carried out primarily by locally elected officials. However, congressional oversight of this local government still exists, and locally elected officials&#x27; powers could theoretically be revoked at any time.

=== Local government ===

In the United States, some states constitutionally or legislatively grant home rule to counties and municipalities within their borders. These are called &quot;home rule states&quot;. Local governments in home rule states are free to pass laws and ordinances as they see fit to further their operations, within the bounds of the state and federal constitutions. In other states, local governments have only the authority expressly granted to them by state legislatures, typically in accordance with the legal principle known as Dillon&#x27;s Rule. A city charter, awarded by the state, defines the limits to a municipality&#x27;s powers.

=== Native American reservations ===
The United States federal government provides limited self-rule to some federally recognised Native American tribes over their lands on reservations. Tribal lands are recognised as &quot;dependent domestic nations&quot; and operate a parallel system of governance and law independent of the state(s) that the reservation lies within, often including separate police forces. For instance, some tribes are permitted to operate gambling establishments which may be illegal in the surrounding state or states. Reservations are not states and have no direct representation in Congress, and the citizens vote as citizens of the state by which they are surrounded. Furthermore, unlike the sovereignty of state legislatures, tribal sovereignty and land ownership are not guaranteed by the Constitution and is granted only by an act of Congress, which can be repealed or altered at any time.

<doc id="174104" wikidata="Q297636" url="?curid=174104" title="Yamagata Aritomo">
<text>Prince was a Japanese politician and general who served as prime minister of Japan from 1889 to 1891, and from 1898 to 1900. He was also a leading member of the &quot;genrō&quot;, a group of senior courtiers and statesmen who dominated the politics of Japan during the Meiji era. As the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s inaugural Chief of Staff, he was the chief architect of its nationalist and reactionary ideology, which has led some historians to consider him the &quot;father&quot; of Japanese militarism.

Yamagata Aritomo was born in the Chōshū Domain to a low-ranking samurai family, and after the opening of Japan in 1854 became active in the movement to overthrow the shogunate. As a member of the new government after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, he went overseas to study military systems, and from 1873 headed the Army Ministry. Yamagata was instrumental in drafting the Conscription Ordinance of 1873 and quelling the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. He also was involved in the Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors of 1882 and the Imperial Rescript on Education of 1890. In 1900, he enacted a law permitting only generals and admirals on active duty to hold a cabinet post as army or navy minister, which gave the military control over the formation of future cabinets. Yamagata held senior military positions in the First Sino-Japanese War and Russo-Japanese War, achieving the rank of field marshal (&quot;Gensui&quot;) and later the title of prince in 1907. 

From 1900 onwards, Yamagata vied against Itō Hirobumi for supremacy among the Meiji oligarchy. Following Ito&#x27;s assassination in 1909, he emerged as the most powerful &quot;genrō&quot; in the imperial court. However, a political scandal involving his meddling in Crown Prince Hirohito&#x27;s engagement led to him losing power shortly before his death in 1922.

==Early career==

Yamagata Tatsunosuke was born on 14 June 1838, in Kawashima, Abu, below Hagi Castle (present-day Hagi, Yamaguchi Prefecture), the eldest son of samurai foot soldier (&quot;ashigaru&quot;) Yamagata Aritoshi. His father was a low-ranking samurai who carried weaponry during wartime and was a petty official at the town magistrate office (&quot;machi-bugyō-sho&quot;) during peacetime. Yamagata&#x27;s mother died when he was 4 years old, and he was raised by his strict grandmother. Although Aritoshi was a petty town magistrate official, he studied &quot;kokugaku&quot;, wrote poetry, and excelled in academics. Yamagata was taught academics by his father Aritoshi. He had his coming of age ceremony (&quot;genpuku&quot;) at age 15, and started off as a petty official at the Chōshū Domain and then at the Meirinkan. Later, he served the territorial magistrate (&quot;daikan&quot;), going from village to village learning general duties of a samurai official. His childhood name was Tatsunosuke, after which he was briefly known as Kosuke and Kyōsuke, before changing his name to Aritomo after the Meiji Restoration.

He went to &quot;Shokasonjuku&quot;, a private school run by Yoshida Shōin, where he was active in the growing underground movement to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate. He was a commander in the &quot;Kiheitai&quot;, a paramilitary organization created on semi-western lines by the Chōshū domain. During the Boshin War, the revolution of 1867 and 1868 often called the Meiji Restoration, he was a staff officer.

After the defeat of the Tokugawa, Yamagata together with Saigō Tsugumichi was selected by the leaders of the new government to go to Europe in 1869 to research European military systems. Yamagata like many Japanese was strongly influenced by the striking success of Prussia in transforming itself from an agricultural state to a leading industrial and military power. He accepted Prussian political ideas, which favored military expansion abroad and authoritarian government at home. On returning he was asked to organize a national army for Japan, and he became War Minister in 1873. Yamagata energetically modernized the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army, and modeled it after the Prussian Army. He began a system of military conscription in 1873.

==Military career==

As War Minister, Yamagata pushed through the foundation of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, which was the main source of Yamagata&#x27;s political power and that of other military officers through the end of World War I. He was Chief of the Army General Staff in 1878–1882, 1884–85 and 1904–1905.

Yamagata in 1877 led the newly modernized Imperial Army against the Satsuma Rebellion led by his former comrade in revolution, Saigō Takamori of Satsuma. At the end of the war, when Saigo&#x27;s severed head was brought to Yamagata, he ordered it washed, and held the head in his arms as he pronounced a meditation on the fallen hero.

He also prompted Emperor Meiji to write the &quot;Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors&quot;, in 1882. This document was considered the moral core of the Japanese Army and Naval forces until their dissolution in 1945.

Yamagata was awarded the rank of field marshal in 1898. Throughout his long career, he amassed extensive leadership experience managing battlefield strategy and other military-related issues as the acting War Minister and Commanding General during the First Sino-Japanese War; the Commanding General of the Japanese First Army during the Russo-Japanese War; and as the Chief of the General Staff Office in Tokyo. Additionally, he was the founding father of Japan&#x27;s &quot;Hokushin-ron&quot; policy due to his central role in drawing up a preliminary national defensive strategy against Russia following the Russo-Japanese War.

==Political career==
Yamagata was one of seven elite political figures, later called the &quot;genrō&quot;, who came to dominate the government of Japan. The word can be translated as principal elders or senior statesmen. The &quot;genrō&quot; were a subset of the revolutionary leaders who shared common objectives and who by about 1880 had forced out or isolated the other original leaders. These seven men (plus two who were chosen later after some of the first seven had died) led Japan for many years, through its great transformation from an agricultural country into a modern military and industrial state. All the &quot;genrō&quot; served at various times as cabinet ministers, and most were at times prime minister. As a body, the &quot;genrō&quot; had no official status, they were simply trusted advisers to the Emperor. Yet the &quot;genrō&quot; collectively made the most important decisions, such as peace and war and foreign policy, and when a cabinet resigned they chose the new prime minister. In the twentieth century their power diminished because of deaths and quarrels among themselves, and the growing political power of the Army and Navy. But the &quot;genrō&quot; clung to the power of naming prime ministers up to the death of the last &quot;genrō&quot;, Prince Saionji in 1940.

Yamagata also held a large and devoted power base among officers in the army and militarists in Japanese society. He profoundly distrusted all democratic institutions, and constantly strove to undercut their influence as a member of the &quot;genrō&quot;. Likewise, he devoted the later part of his life defending the privileges of the Restoration regime&#x27;s institutions, especially those held by the army. 

During his long and versatile career, Yamagata held numerous important governmental posts. In 1882, he became president of the Board of Legislation (&quot;Sanjiin&quot;) and as Home Minister (1883–87) he worked vigorously to suppress political parties and repress agitation in the labor and agrarian movements. He also organized a system of local administration, based on a prefecture-county-city structure which is still in use in Japan today. In 1883 Yamagata was appointed to the post of Lord Chancellor, the highest bureaucratic position in the government system before the Meiji Constitution of 1889.

After the creation of the Cabinet of Japan, Yamagata became the third Prime Minister of Japan. During his first term from December 24, 1889, to May 6, 1891, he became the first prime minister compelled to share power with a partially-elected Imperial Diet under the Meiji Constitution which took effect in 1890. On October 30, 1890, he presided over the enactment of the &quot;Imperial Rescript on Education&quot;. In order to pass a budget for the fiscal year 1891 (beginning in April), he had to negotiate with a liberal majority in the House of Representatives, the elected lower house of the Diet. Yamagata became prime minister for a second term from November 8, 1898, to October 19, 1900. In 1900, while in his second term as prime minister, he ruled that only an active military officer could serve as War Minister or Navy Minister, a rule that gave the military control over the formation of any future cabinet. He also enacted laws preventing political party members from holding any key posts in the bureaucracy.

In addition to his service as prime minister, Yamagata obtained considerable experience traveling abroad as a diplomat. Attending the coronation of the Russian Czar Nicholas II on November 1, 1894, he made a tentative offer to Spain on buying the Philippines for £40 million. Likewise, in 1896, he led a diplomatic mission to Moscow, which produced the Yamagata–Lobanov Agreement confirming Japanese and Russian rights in Korea.

Yamagata also served as President of the Privy Council from 1893 to 1894 and 1905 to 1922. While serving his second term as president in 1907, he was elevated to the peerage and received the title of &quot;koshaku&quot; (prince) under the Japanese &quot;kazoku&quot; system.

From 1900 to 1909, Yamagata opposed Itō Hirobumi, leader of the civilian party, and exercised influence through his protégé, Katsura Tarō. After the assassination of Itō Hirobumi in 1909, Yamagata became the most influential statesman in Japan and remained so until his death in 1922, although he retired from active participation in politics after the Russo-Japanese War. As president of the Privy Council from 1909 to 1922, Yamagata remained the power behind the government and dictated the selection of future prime ministers until his death.

In 1912 Yamagata set the precedent that the army could dismiss a cabinet. A dispute with Prime Minister Marquis Saionji Kinmochi over the military budget became a constitutional crisis, known as the Taisho Crisis after the newly enthroned Emperor. The army minister, General Uehara Yūsaku, resigned when the cabinet would not grant him the budget he wanted. Saionji sought to replace him. Japanese law required that the ministers of the army and navy must be high-ranking generals and admirals on active duty (not retired). In this instance all the eligible generals at Yamagata&#x27;s instigation refused to serve in the Saionji cabinet, and the cabinet was compelled to resign.

However, his power was greatly damaged in 1921 when he expressed strong opposition to the engagement of Hirohito and Nagako citing color blindness of Nagako&#x27;s family. The Imperial family struggled against the pressure from Yamagata and the couple eventually managed to get married.

Yamagata died on 1 February 1922 and he was given a state funeral.

==Personal life and hobbies==

Yamagata was a talented garden designer, and today the gardens he designed are considered masterpieces of Japanese gardens. A noted example is the garden of the villa Murin-an in Kyoto.

As Yamagata had no heir, in 1861 he adopted a nephew Katsu Isaburō, the second son of his eldest sister, to be his heir. Yamagata Isaburō subsequently assisted his adopted father by serving as a career bureaucrat, cabinet minister, and head of the civilian administration of Korea.

In April 1868 at the age of 29, Yamagata married the 16 year-old Tomoko, a daughter of the headman of the Chōshū Domain before his departure to Kyoto. Yamagata returned back to the Domain in July to hold a wedding ceremony. They had seven children, all except his second daughter Matsuko (born August 1878) had died young.

After his wife Tomoko&#x27;s death in 1893, Yamagata took in a geisha named Yoshida Sadako as his de facto wife; her name was never registered onto the Yamagata family registry.

<doc id="174106" wikidata="Q714039" url="?curid=174106" title="Matsukata Masayoshi">
<text>Prince was a Japanese politician who served as prime minister of Japan from 1891 to 1892, and from 1896 to 1898. He was a &quot;genrō&quot;, or senior statesman who dictated policy in the Meiji era. Born in the Satsuma Domain to a samurai family, Matsukata served as finance minister for 15 of the 20 years between 1881 and 1901, and had significant influence in the financial and economic articles of the Meiji Constitution of 1889. He was given the title of prince in 1922.

==Early life==
Matsukata Masayoshi was born on 25 February 1835, in Arata, Kagoshima, Satsuma Province (present-day Shimoarata, Kagoshima, Kagoshima Prefecture), the fourth son of Matsukata Masayasu and his wife Kesaku. His family was of the &quot;samurai&quot; warrior nobility class. Both his parents died when he was 13 years old.

At the age of 13, he entered the &quot;Zoshikan&quot;, the Satsuma domain&#x27;s Confucian academy, where he studied the teachings of Wang Yangming, which stressed loyalty to the Emperor. He started his career as a bureaucrat of the Satsuma Domain. In 1866, he was sent to Nagasaki to study western science, mathematics and surveying. Matsukata was highly regarded by Ōkubo Toshimichi and Saigō Takamori, who used him as their liaison between Kyoto and the domain government in Kagoshima.

Knowing that war was coming between Satsuma and the Tokugawa, Matsukata purchased a ship available in Nagasaki for use in the coming conflict. This ship was then given the name Kasuga. The leaders of Satsuma felt the ship was best used as cargo vessel and so Matsukata resigned his position as captain of the ship he had purchased. Just a few months later the Kasuga did become a warship and it fought in the Boshin War against the Tokugawa ships. At the time of the Meiji Restoration, he helped maintain order in Nagasaki after the collapse of the Tokugawa bakufu. In 1868, Matsukata was appointed governor of Hita Prefecture (part of present-day Ōita Prefecture) by his friend Okubo who was the powerful minister of the interior for the new Meiji government.

As governor Matsukata instituted a number of reforms including road building, starting the port of Beppu, and building a successful orphanage. His ability as an administrator was noted in Tokyo and after two years he was summoned to the capital.

==Financial reform==
Matsukata moved to Tokyo in 1871 and began work on drafting laws for the Land Tax Reform of 1873–1881.

Under the new system:
# a taxpayer paid taxes with money instead of rice
# taxes were calculated based on the price of estates, not the amount of the agricultural product produced, and
# tax rates were fixed at 3% of the value of estates and an estate holder was obliged to pay those taxes.

The new tax system was radically different from the traditional tax gathering system, which required taxes to be paid with rice varied according to location and the amount of rice produced. The new system took some years to be accepted by the Japanese people.

Matsukata became Lord Home Minister in 1880. In the following year, when Ōkuma Shigenobu was expelled in a political upheaval, he became Lord Finance Minister. The Japanese economy was in a crisis situation due to rampant inflation. Matsukata introduced a policy of fiscal restraint that resulted in what has come to be called the &quot;Matsukata Deflation&quot;. The economy was eventually stabilized, but the resulting crash in commodity prices caused many smaller landholders to lose their fields to money-lending neighbors. Matsukata also established the Bank of Japan in 1882, replacing the prior system of national banks. When Itō Hirobumi was appointed the first modern-day Prime Minister of Japan in 1885, he named Matsukata to be the first Finance Minister in his cabinet.

Matsukata also sought to protect Japanese industry from foreign competition, but was restricted by the unequal treaties. The unavailability of protectionist devices probably benefited Japan in the long run, as it enabled Japan to develop its export industries. The national government also tried to create government industries to produce particular products or services. Lack of funds forced the government to turn these industries over to private businesses which in return for special privileges agreed to pursue the government&#x27;s goals. This arrangement led to the rise of the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; system.

Matsukata served as finance minister in seven of the first nine cabinets, and led the Finance Ministry for 15 of the 20-year period from 1881 to 1901. He is also believed to have had significant influence on drafting Articles 62–72 of the Meiji Constitution of 1890.

==Prime minister==
Matsukata followed Yamagata Aritomo as Prime Minister from 6 May 1891, to 8 August 1892, and followed Ito Hirobumi as Prime Minister from 18 September 1896, to 12 January 1898, during which times he concurrently also held office as finance minister.

One issue of his term in office was the Black Ocean Society, which operated with the support of certain powerful figures in the government and in return was powerful enough to demand concessions from the government. They demanded and received promises of a strong foreign policy from the 1892 Matsukata Cabinet.

==Later life==

Matsukata successively held offices as president of the Japanese Red Cross Society, privy councillor, &quot;gijokan&quot;, member of the House of Peers, and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan. Later, he was given the title of prince and &quot;genrō&quot;.

In 1902 he visited US and Europe. He arrived in London from New York in late April. During his stay, he was received in audience by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 2 May 1902, and received an honorary degree from the University of Oxford the following month. In July he visited Vienna and St Petersburg before returning to Japan.

==Honours and decorations==

===Titles===
*Count (7 July 1884)
*Marquess (21 September 1907)
*Prince (18 September 1922)

===Decorations===
*Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (22 July 1881)
*Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers (31 October 1899)
*Collar of the Order of the Chrysanthemum (14 July 1916; Grand Cordon: 1 April 1906)

Matsukata was named an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the November 1902 Birthday Honours list published to commemorate King Edward VII′s birthday.

===Honorary degrees===
*D.C.L. (honorary) University of Oxford - June 1902, during a visit to the United Kingdom

==Personal life and relatives==
Matsukata had many children (at least 13 sons and 11 daughters) and grandchildren. It is said that Emperor Meiji asked him how many children he had; but Masayoshi was unable to give an exact answer.

Matsukata&#x27;s son, Kōjirō Matsukata (1865–1950) led a successful business career at the head of the Kawasaki Heavy Industries and K Line groups, while investing his significant personal fortune in the acquisition of several thousand examples of Western painting, sculpture and decorative arts. His intention was that the collection should serve as the nucleus of a national museum of western art. Although not achieved during his lifetime, the 1959 creation of the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo was a vindication of this passion for art and a demonstration of the foresight which benefits his countrymen and others.

Another son, Shokuma Matsukata, married Miyo Arai (1891-1984), who, as Miyo A. Matsukata, was instrumental in introducing the Christian Science religion to Japan, and who became one of the first Japanese to engage in the public practice of Christian Science healing.

His granddaughter, journalist Haru Matsukata Reischauer, married the American scholar of Japanese history, academic, statesman and United States Ambassador to Japan, Edwin Oldfather Reischauer.

<text>The &quot;abc&quot; conjecture (also known as the Oesterlé–Masser conjecture) is a conjecture in number theory that arose out of a discussion of Joseph Oesterlé and David Masser in 1985. It is stated in terms of three positive integers &quot;formula_1&quot; and &quot;formula_2&quot; (hence the name) that are relatively prime and satisfy &quot;formula_3&quot;. The conjecture essentially states that the product of the distinct prime factors of &quot;formula_4&quot; is usually not much smaller than &quot;formula_2&quot;. A number of famous conjectures and theorems in number theory would follow immediately from the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture or its versions. Mathematician Dorian Goldfeld described the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture as &quot;The most important unsolved problem in Diophantine analysis&quot;.

The &quot;abc&quot; conjecture originated as the outcome of attempts by Oesterlé and Masser to understand the Szpiro conjecture about elliptic curves, which involves more geometric structures in its statement than the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture. The &quot;abc&quot; conjecture was shown to be equivalent to the modified Szpiro&#x27;s conjecture.

Various attempts to prove the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture have been made, but none have gained broad acceptance. Shinichi Mochizuki claimed to have a proof in 2012, but the conjecture is still regarded as unproven by the mainstream mathematical community.

==Formulations==
Before stating the conjecture, the notion of the radical of an integer must be introduced: for a positive integer &quot;formula_6&quot;, the radical of &quot;formula_6&quot;, denoted &quot;formula_8&quot;, is the product of the distinct prime factors of &quot;formula_6&quot;. For example,

formula_10

formula_11

&quot;formula_12&quot;

&quot;formula_13&quot;

If &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are coprime positive integers such that &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = &quot;c&quot;, it turns out that &quot;usually&quot; &quot;formula_14&quot;. The &quot;abc conjecture&quot; deals with the exceptions. Specifically, it states that:

An equivalent formulation is:

Equivalently (using the little o notation):

A fourth equivalent formulation of the conjecture involves the &quot;quality&quot; &quot;q&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) of the triple (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), which is defined as

For example:

A typical triple (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) of coprime positive integers with &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = &quot;c&quot; will have &quot;c&quot; &lt; rad(&quot;abc&quot;), i.e. &quot;q&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) &lt; 1. Triples with &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1 such as in the second example are rather special, they consist of numbers divisible by high powers of small prime numbers. The fourth formulation is:

Whereas it is known that there are infinitely many triples (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) of coprime positive integers with &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = &quot;c&quot; such that &quot;q&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) &gt; 1, the conjecture predicts that only finitely many of those have &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1.01 or &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1.001 or even &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1.0001, etc. In particular, if the conjecture is true, then there must exist a triple (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) that achieves the maximal possible quality &quot;q&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;).

==Examples of triples with small radical==
The condition that &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0 is necessary as there exist infinitely many triples &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; with &quot;c&quot; &gt; rad(&quot;abc&quot;). For example, let

The integer &quot;b&quot; is divisible by 9:

Using this fact, the following calculation is made:

By replacing the exponent 6&quot;n&quot; with other exponents forcing &quot;b&quot; to have larger square factors, the ratio between the radical and &quot;c&quot; can be made arbitrarily small. Specifically, let &quot;p&quot; &gt; 2 be a prime and consider

Now it may be plausibly claimed that &quot;b&quot; is divisible by &quot;p&quot;2:

The last step uses the fact that &quot;p&quot;2 divides 2&quot;p&quot;(&quot;p&quot;−1) − 1. This follows from Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, which shows that, for &quot;p&quot; &gt; 2, 2&quot;p&quot;−1 = &quot;pk&quot; + 1 for some integer &quot;k&quot;. Raising both sides to the power of &quot;p&quot; then shows that 2&quot;p&quot;(&quot;p&quot;−1) = &quot;p&quot;2(...) + 1.

And now with a similar calculation as above, the following results:

A list of the highest-quality triples (triples with a particularly small radical relative to &quot;c&quot;) is given below; the highest quality, 1.6299, was found by Eric Reyssat for

==Some consequences==

The &quot;abc&quot; conjecture has a large number of consequences. These include both known results (some of which have been proven separately only since the conjecture has been stated) and conjectures for which it gives a conditional proof. The consequences include:

* Roth&#x27;s theorem on Diophantine approximation of algebraic numbers.
* The Mordell conjecture (already proven in general by Gerd Faltings).
* As equivalent, Vojta&#x27;s conjecture in dimension 1.
* The Erdős–Woods conjecture allowing for a finite number of counterexamples.
* The existence of infinitely many non-Wieferich primes in every base &quot;b&quot; &gt; 1.
* The weak form of Marshall Hall&#x27;s conjecture on the separation between squares and cubes of integers.
* Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem has a famously difficult proof by Andrew Wiles. However it follows easily, at least for formula_15, from an effective form of a weak version of the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture. The &quot;abc&quot; conjecture says the lim sup of the set of all qualities (defined above) is 1, which implies the much weaker assertion that there is a finite upper bound for qualities. The conjecture that 2 is such an upper bound suffices for a very short proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for formula_15.
* The Fermat–Catalan conjecture, a generalization of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem concerning powers that are sums of powers.
* The &quot;L&quot;-function &quot;L&quot;(&quot;s&quot;, &quot;χd&quot;) formed with the Legendre symbol, has no Siegel zero, given a uniform version of the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture in number fields, not just the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture as formulated above for rational integers.
* A polynomial &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) has only finitely many perfect powers for all integers &quot;x&quot; if &quot;P&quot; has at least three simple zeros.
* A generalization of Tijdeman&#x27;s theorem concerning the number of solutions of &quot;ym&quot; = &quot;xn&quot; + &quot;k&quot; (Tijdeman&#x27;s theorem answers the case &quot;k&quot; = 1), and Pillai&#x27;s conjecture (1931) concerning the number of solutions of &quot;Aym&quot; = &quot;Bxn&quot; + &quot;k&quot;.
* As equivalent, the Granville–Langevin conjecture, that if &quot;f&quot; is a square-free binary form of degree &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2, then for every real &quot;β&quot; &gt; 2 there is a constant &quot;C&quot;(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;β&quot;) such that for all coprime integers &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, the radical of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) exceeds &quot;C&quot; · max&quot;n&quot;−&quot;β&quot;.
* all the polynominals (x^n-1)/(x-1) have an infinity of square-free values.
* As equivalent, the modified Szpiro conjecture, which would yield a bound of rad(&quot;abc&quot;)1.2+&quot;ε&quot;.
* has shown that the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture implies that the Diophantine equation &quot;n&quot;! + &quot;A&quot; = &quot;k&quot;2 has only finitely many solutions for any given integer &quot;A&quot;.
* There are ~&quot;c&quot;&quot;f&quot;&quot;N&quot; positive integers &quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;N&quot; for which &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)/B&#x27; is square-free, with &quot;c&quot;&quot;f&quot; &gt; 0 a positive constant defined as: \right ).&lt;/math&gt;}}
*The Beal conjecture, a generalization of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem proposing that if &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; are positive integers with &quot;Ax&quot; + &quot;By&quot; = &quot;Cz&quot; and &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; &gt; 2, then &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; have a common prime factor. The &quot;abc&quot; conjecture would imply that there are only finitely many counterexamples.
*Lang&#x27;s conjecture, a lower bound for the height of a non-torsion rational point of an elliptic curve.
* A negative solution to the Erdős–Ulam problem on dense sets of Euclidean points with rational distances.
* An effective version of Siegel&#x27;s theorem about integral points on algebraic curves.

==Theoretical results==
The &quot;abc&quot; conjecture implies that &quot;c&quot; can be bounded above by a near-linear function of the radical of &quot;abc&quot;. Bounds are known that are exponential. Specifically, the following bounds have been proven:

\left(\log(\operatorname{rad}(abc)\right)^3\right) } &lt;/math&gt; .}}

In these bounds, &quot;K&quot;1 and &quot;K&quot;3 are constants that do not depend on &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;K&quot;2 is a constant that depends on &quot;ε&quot; (in an effectively computable way) but not on &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or &quot;c&quot;. The bounds apply to any triple for which &quot;c&quot; &gt; 2.

There are also theoretical results that provide a lower bound on the best possible form of the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture. In particular, showed that there are infinitely many triples (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) of coprime integers with &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = &quot;c&quot; and

for all &quot;k&quot; &lt; 4. The constant &quot;k&quot; was improved to &quot;k&quot; = 6.068 by .

==Computational results==
In 2006, the Mathematics Department of Leiden University in the Netherlands, together with the Dutch Kennislink science institute, launched the ABC@Home project, a grid computing system, which aims to discover additional triples &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; with rad(&quot;abc&quot;) &lt; &quot;c&quot;. Although no finite set of examples or counterexamples can resolve the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture, it is hoped that patterns in the triples discovered by this project will lead to insights about the conjecture and about number theory more generally.

As of May 2014, ABC@Home had found 23.8 million triples.

Note: the &quot;quality&quot; &quot;q&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) of the triple (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) is defined above.

==Refined forms, generalizations and related statements==
The &quot;abc&quot; conjecture is an integer analogue of the Mason–Stothers theorem for polynomials.

A strengthening, proposed by , states that in the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture one can replace rad(&quot;abc&quot;) by

where &quot;ω&quot; is the total number of distinct primes dividing &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;.

Andrew Granville noticed that the minimum of the function formula_17 over formula_18 occurs when formula_19

This inspired to propose a sharper form of the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture, namely:

with &quot;κ&quot; an absolute constant. After some computational experiments he found that a value of formula_20 was admissible for &quot;κ&quot;. This version is called the &quot;explicit &quot;abc&quot; conjecture&quot;.

 also describes related conjectures of Andrew Granville that would give upper bounds on &quot;c&quot; of the form

where Ω(&quot;n&quot;) is the total number of prime factors of &quot;n&quot;, and

where Θ(&quot;n&quot;) is the number of integers up to &quot;n&quot; divisible only by primes dividing &quot;n&quot;.

 proposed a more precise inequality based on .
Let &quot;k&quot; = rad(&quot;abc&quot;). They conjectured there is a constant &quot;C&quot;1 such that

\left(1+\frac{\log\log\log k}{2\log\log k}+\frac{C_{1}}{\log\log k}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;}}

holds whereas there is a constant &quot;C&quot;2 such that

\left(1+\frac{\log\log\log k}{2\log\log k}+\frac{C_{2}}{\log\log k}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;}}

holds infinitely often.

 formulated the n conjecture—a version of the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture involving &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 integers.

==Claimed proofs==

Lucien Szpiro proposed a solution in 2007, but it was found to be incorrect shortly afterwards.

Since August 2012, Shinichi Mochizuki has claimed a proof of Szpiro&#x27;s conjecture and therefore the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture. He released a series of four preprints developing a new theory he called inter-universal Teichmüller theory (IUTT), which is then applied to prove the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture.
The papers have not been widely accepted by the mathematical community as providing a proof of &quot;abc&quot;. This is not only because of their length and the difficulty of understanding them, but also because at least one specific point in the argument has been identified as a gap by some other experts. Although a few mathematicians have vouched for the correctness of the proof and have attempted to communicate their understanding via workshops on IUTT, they have failed to convince the number theory community at large.

In March 2018, Peter Scholze and Jakob Stix visited Kyoto for discussions with Mochizuki.
While they did not resolve the differences, they brought them into clearer focus.
Scholze and Stix wrote a report asserting and explaining an error in the logic of the proof and claiming that the resulting gap was &quot;so severe that ... small modifications will not rescue the proof strategy&quot;;
Mochizuki claimed that they misunderstood vital aspects of the theory and made invalid simplifications.

On April 3, 2020, two mathematicians from the Kyoto research institute where Mochizuki works announced that his claimed proof would be published in &quot;Publications of the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences&quot;, the institute&#x27;s journal. Mochizuki is chief editor of the journal but recused himself from the review of the paper. The announcement was received with skepticism by Kiran Kedlaya and Edward Frenkel, as well as being described by &quot;Nature&quot; as &quot;unlikely to move many researchers over to Mochizuki&#x27;s camp&quot;. In March 2021, Mochizuki&#x27;s proof was published in RIMS.

<text>Marquess  was a Japanese politician who served as the prime minister of Japan in 1898, and from 1914 to 1916.

Born in the Saga Domain, Ōkuma was appointed minister of finance soon after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, aided by his friendship with &quot;genrō&quot; Inoue Kaoru. He unified the nation&#x27;s currency and created the national mint before being dismissed in 1881 after a long series of disagreements with members of the Satsuma and Chōshū cliques in the Meiji oligarchy. In 1882, Ōkuma formed the Rikken Kaishintō party and founded Waseda University. He returned to office as foreign minister in 1888, and focused on revising the unequal treaties imposed on Japan; his approach was viewed by some as too conciliatory to the Western powers, leading to an assassination attempt in 1889 and the loss of a leg. Ōkuma again returned to politics in 1896, forming the Shimpotō party and becoming foreign minister and agriculture and commerce minister.

In 1898, he merged with Itagaki Taisuke&#x27;s Jiyūtō to form the Kenseitō party, and soon after formed the first partisan cabinet in Japanese history. Internal conflict with Itagaki caused the cabinet to fall in four months. Ōkuma then led the offshoot Kensei Hontō until 1907, resigning to become president of Waseda University. In 1914, Ōkuma was again appointed prime minister. He oversaw the first years of Japan&#x27;s participation in World War I and issued the Twenty-One Demands to China in 1915 before being forced to resign in 1916.

==Early life==

Ōkuma Hachitarō was born on March 11, 1838, in Saga, Hizen Province (modern day Saga Prefecture), the first son of Ōkuma Nobuyasu and Miiko. His father was a samurai-class artillery officer of the Saga Domain, and the family were a high-ranking samurai family who had a 300 &quot;koku&quot; territory.

At the age of seven, he entered the domain school Kōdōkan and studied mainly Confucian literature, the teachings of Cheng–Zhu school in particular. In 1854, he rebelled against the education of the school with his fellow students. He was expelled the next year for rioting. At this point, he had moved to a Dutch studies institution.

The Dutch school was merged with the provincial school in 1861, and Ōkuma took up a lecturing position there shortly afterward. Ōkuma sympathized with the &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; movement, which aimed at expelling the Europeans who had started to arrive in Japan. However, he also advocated mediation between the rebels in Chōshū and the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo.

During a trip to Nagasaki, Ōkuma met a Dutch missionary named Guido Verbeck, who taught him the English language and provided him with copies of the New Testament and the American Declaration of Independence, as well as works on scientific subjects. The political works are often said to have affected his political thinking profoundly, and encouraged him to support efforts to abolish the existing feudal system and work toward the establishment of a constitutional government.

Ōkuma frequently traveled between Nagasaki and Kyoto in the following years and became active in the Meiji Restoration. In 1867, together with Soejima Taneomi, he planned to recommend resignation to the &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Yoshinobu. Leaving Saga Domain without permission, they went to Kyoto, where the &quot;shōgun&quot; then resided. However, Ōkuma and his companions were arrested and sent back to Saga. They were subsequently sentenced to one month imprisonment.

==Meiji period political life==

Following the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Okuma was placed in charge of foreign affairs for the new Meiji government. At this time, he negotiated with British diplomat, Sir Harry Smith Parkes on the ban of Christianity and insisted on maintaining the government&#x27;s persecution on Catholics in Nagasaki.

In 1873, the Japanese government removed the ban on Christianity.

He was soon given an additional post as head of Japan&#x27;s monetary reform program. He made use of his close contacts with Inoue Kaoru to secure a position in the central government in Tokyo. He was elected to the first Diet of Japan in 1870 and soon became Minister of Finance, in which capacity he instituted property and taxation reforms that aided Japan&#x27;s early industrial development. He presided over the commission which represented the Japanese government at the 1873 Vienna World&#x27;s Fair.

He also unified the nation&#x27;s currency, created the national mint, and a separate Minister of Industry; however, he was dismissed in 1881 after a long series of disagreements with members of the Satsuma and Chōshū clique in the Meiji oligarchy, most notably Itō Hirobumi, over his efforts to secure foreign loans, to establish a constitution, and especially over his exposure of illicit property dealings involving Prime Minister Kuroda Kiyotaka and others from Satsuma.

In 1882, Ōkuma co-founded the Constitutional Progressive Party &quot;(Rikken Kaishintō)&quot; which soon attracted a number of other leaders, including Ozaki Yukio and Inukai Tsuyoshi. That same year, Ōkuma founded the &quot;Tokyo Senmon Gakkō&quot; () in the Waseda district of Tokyo. The school later became Waseda University, one of the country&#x27;s most prominent institutions of higher education.

Despite their continuing animosity, Itō again appointed Ōkuma to the post of Foreign Minister in February 1888 to deal with the difficult issue of negotiation revisions to the &quot;unequal treaties&quot; with the Western powers. The treaty he negotiated was perceived by the public as too conciliatory to the Western powers, and created considerable controversy. In 1889, Ōkuma was attacked by a member of the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot;, who threw a bomb directly under Ōkuma&#x27;s carriage. Following two operations, Ōkuma&#x27;s left leg was amputated at the hip. He retired from politics at that time.

However, he returned to politics in 1896 by reorganizing the &quot;Rikken Kaishintō&quot; into the &quot;Shimpotō&quot; (Progressive Party). In 1897, Matsukata Masayoshi convinced Ōkuma to participate in his second administration as Foreign Minister and Agriculture and Commerce Minister, but again, he remained in office for only one year before resigning as a result of intrigues involving the prime minister.

In June 1898, Ōkuma co-founded the &quot;Kenseitō&quot; (Constitutional Government Party), by merging his Shimpotō with Itagaki Taisuke&#x27;s &quot;Jiyūtō,&quot; and was appointed by the Emperor to form the first partisan cabinet in Japanese history. The new cabinet survived for only four months before it fell apart due to internal dissension. Ōkuma remained in charge of the party until 1908, when he retired from politics.

After his political retirement, Ōkuma became president of Waseda University and chairman of the Japan Civilization Society, from which scholars&#x27; many translations of European and American texts were published. He also gathered support for Japan&#x27;s first expedition to Antarctica.

==Taishō period political life==

At the request of the Emperor, Ōkuma returned to politics during the constitutional crisis of 1914, when the government of Yamamoto Gonnohyōe was forced to resign in the wake of the Siemens scandal. The 2nd Ōkuma administration was noted for its active foreign policy. Later that year, Japan declared war on the German Empire, thus entering World War I on the Allied side. However, the government suffered defeat in December, over the army budget.

In 1915, Ōkuma and Katō Takaaki drafted the Twenty-One Demands on China. Ōkuma won re-election in March of that year, but his second administration was also short-lived. Following the Ōura scandal, Ōkuma&#x27;s cabinet lost popular support, and its members held mass resignation in October 1915. Still, Ōkuma was persuaded to continue in office for a while, and during the year treaties were concluded with France, Russia and China. Later in 1916, after a long argument with the &quot;Genrō&quot;, Ōkuma resigned as well, and retired from politics permanently, although he remained a member of the Upper House of the Diet of Japan until 1922. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum in 1916, and was elevated to the title of &quot;kōshaku&quot; () (marquis) in the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system the same year.

Ōkuma returned to Waseda, and died there in 1922. An estimated 300,000 people attended his funeral in Tokyo&#x27;s Hibiya Park. He was posthumously conferred with the Collar of the Order of the Chrysanthemum, the nation&#x27;s highest honour. He was buried at the temple of Gokoku-ji in Tokyo.

==Ōkuma Shigenobu former residence==

Ōkuma Shigenobu&#x27;s house in the city of Saga still exists, and is part of the Okuma Shigenobu Memorial Museum complex. This building was purchased by Ōkuma Kumanosuke in 1838, and was the residence of Ōkuma Shigenobu&#x27;s from his birth until the time he departed Saga for Tokyo in 1868. The structure consists of a single-story tatch-roof portion and a two-story tile-roof portion. It is said that the second floor was added by Shigenobu&#x27;s mother to provide her son with a study. Although the house is in good preservation, there are signs of remodeling at the entrance, and the kitchen has been removed and an administration room added at a later date. It was designated a National Historic Site in 1965.

<text>Ernest Loring &quot;Red&quot; Nichols (May 8, 1905 – June 28, 1965) was an American jazz cornetist, composer, and jazz bandleader. He was one of the most prolific and influential jazz musicians in the late 1920s and early 1930s, appearing on over 4,000 recordings. In 1959, a biopic was made of his life and career, &quot;The Five Pennies&quot;, starring Danny Kaye.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and career ===
Nichols was born in Ogden, Utah, United States. He was of the Mormon faith. His father was a college music professor, and Nichols was something of a child prodigy, playing difficult set pieces for his father&#x27;s brass band by the age of 12. Young Nichols heard the early recordings of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band and later those of Bix Beiderbecke, and these had a strong influence on him. His style became polished, clean, and incisive.

In the early 1920s, Nichols moved to the Midwest and joined a band called the Syncopating Seven. When that band broke up, he joined the Johnny Johnson Orchestra and went with it to New York City in 1923. In New York, he met trombonist Miff Mole, and the two were inseparable for the next decade. Before signing with Brunswick, Nichols and Mole recorded for Pathé-Perfect under the name the Red Heads.

=== Brunswick Records era ===
Nichols could read music and easily gained studio work. In 1926, Mole and he began recording with a variety of bands as Red Nichols and His Five Pennies. Few of these groups were quintets; the name was a pun on &quot;nickel&quot;. With the Five Pennies, he recorded more than 100 sides for Brunswick. He also recorded as the Arkansas Travelers, the California Red Heads, the Louisiana Rhythm Kings, the Charleston Chasers, Red and Miff&#x27;s Stompers, and Miff Mole and His Little Molers. During some weeks in this period, Nichols and his bands were recording 10 to 12 two-sided records.

Nichols&#x27; band started with Mole on trombone and Jimmy Dorsey on alto saxophone and clarinet. Other musicians in his bands in the following decade included Benny Goodman (clarinet), Glenn Miller (trombone), Jack Teagarden (trombone), Pee Wee Russell (clarinet), Joe Venuti (violin), Eddie Lang (banjo and guitar), and Gene Krupa (drums). The Five Pennies&#x27; version of &quot;Ida, Sweet as Apple Cider&quot; was a surprise hit record. It sold over a million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America. His composition &quot;Nervous Charlie Stomp&quot; was recorded by one of the top jazz bands of the 1920s, Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s orchestra featuring Coleman Hawkins on sax, and released as a 78 single.

In the next decade, more structured swing eclipsed the improvisational hot jazz Nichols loved to play. He tried to follow the changes and formed a swing band, but his recording career seemed to stall in 1932. Music critic Michael Brooks wrote,
What went wrong? Part of it was too much, too soon. Much of his vast recorded output was released in Europe, where he was regarded by early jazz critics as the equal, if not the superior, of Louis Armstrong and Bix Beiderbecke. People who make fools of themselves usually find a scapegoat, and when the critics were exposed to the music of Duke Ellington, Benny Carter, Coleman Hawkins, and others, they turned on Nichols and savaged him, trashing him as unfairly as they had revered him. Nichols&#x27; chief fault was an overly stiff, academic approach to jazz trumpet, but he did recognize merit as far as other jazz musicians were concerned and made some wonderful small-group recordings.
Other labels Nichols recorded for included Edison 1926, Victor 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931 (individual sessions), Bluebird 1934, 1939, back to Brunswick for a session in 1934, Variety 1937, and OKeh in 1940.

=== Later career ===
Nichols survived the Great Depression by playing in show bands and pit orchestras. He led Bob Hope&#x27;s orchestra for a while, moving to California. Nichols married Willa Stutsman, a &quot;stunning&quot; &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot; dancer, and they had a daughter. In 1942, their daughter contracted polio, which was misdiagnosed at first as spinal meningitis, and Nichols left Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra to work in the wartime shipyards. On May 2, 1942, Nichols left his band to take an army commission after completing an engagement at Lantz&#x27;s Merry-Go-Round in Dayton, Ohio.

Drawn back to music after the war, Nichols formed another Five Pennies band and began playing in small clubs in Los Angeles. Club dates turned into performances at bigger venues, such as the Zebra Room, the Tudor Room of the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, and the Huntington-Sheraton Hotel in Pasadena, California. He toured Europe as a goodwill ambassador for the State Department. Nichols and his band performed in the 1950 film &quot;Quicksand&quot; starring Mickey Rooney. In 1956, he was the subject of an episode of the television program &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in which he reunited with Miff Mole, Phil Harris, and Jimmy Dorsey, who praised Nichols as a bandleader who ensured everyone was paid.

=== Death ===
In 1965, Nichols took his Five Pennies band to the Mint Hotel in Las Vegas. On June 28, 1965, a few days after he began performing, he had chest pains while he was sleeping. He phoned the front desk, but was dead by the time the ambulance arrived. The band performed as scheduled with a spotlight on Nichols&#x27; empty chair.

=== Biographical film and film career ===
In 1929, he appeared in the Vitaphone film short (reel #870) with his band the Five Pennies along with Eddie Condon and Pee Wee Russell.

In 1935, he appeared in the Paramount Pictures film short &quot;The Parade of the Maestros&quot; along with Ferde Grofe performing &quot;In the Middle of a Kiss&quot;.

Red Nichols performed in and is also mentioned in the 1950 Mickey Rooney and Jeanne Cagney film &quot;Quicksand&quot;. Rooney&#x27;s character asks out Jean Cagney; he asks if she likes &quot;Red Nichols and his outfit?&quot; and she responds, &quot;I think they&#x27;re great!&quot; They then go to the club to watch Red Nichols and his band perform.

The 1959 Hollywood film &quot;The Five Pennies&quot;, the film biography of Red Nichols, starring Danny Kaye as Red Nichols, was loosely based on Nichols&#x27; life and career. Nichols played his own cornet parts for the film and appeared briefly as one of the &quot;Clicquot Club Eskimos&quot; on screen. The Paramount Pictures movie received four Academy Award nominations. Jazz contemporary Louis Armstrong also appeared in the film. &quot;The Five Pennies&quot; movie theme song and other songs for the film were composed by Sylvia Fine, Danny Kaye&#x27;s wife.

Nichols also made cameo appearances in the 1951 film &quot;Disc Jockey&quot; with Tommy Dorsey, and &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot; in 1959.

His recording of &quot;Poor Butterfly&quot; is heard in the 1994 Woody Allen film &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; and his recording of &quot;(Back Home Again in) Indiana&quot; in Allen&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot;.

==Film shorts==

Red Nichols and his band appeared in several musical film shorts. The first was Red Nichols &amp; His Five Pennies (1929), a Vitaphone short directed by Murray Roth. Red Nichols&#x27; Five Pennies play &quot;Ida&quot;, &quot;Whispering&quot;, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;, &quot;Who Cares&quot;, and &quot;China Boy&quot;. The musicians are Red Nichols (cornet), Tommy Thune and John Egan (trumpet), Herb Taylor (trombone), Pee Wee Russell (clarinet), Irving Brodsky (piano), Eddie Condon (banjo and vega lute) and George Beebe (drums).

In 1935, the film short Million Dollar Notes was released by Paramount Pictures, directed by Fred Waller and produced by Adolph Zukor. The songs performed were &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;, &quot;Rhythm of the Dixieland Band&quot;, and &quot;Everybody Loves My Baby&quot;.

In 1936, he and his band appeared in a ten minute film short entitled Red Nichols and His World Famous Five Pennies directed by Joseph Henabery which featured his theme song &quot;Wail of the Winds&quot; written by Harry Warren, &quot;Get Happy&quot;, &quot;When It&#x27;s Sleepy Time Down South&quot;, &quot;Troublesome Trumpet&quot;, &quot;Cryin&#x27; for the Carolines&quot;, &quot;Carolina in the Morning&quot; written by Walter Donalson, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Yo&#x27; Heah Me Callin&#x27; Caroline&quot;.

In the 1950s, Snader Telescriptions were recorded for Entrance of the Gladiators (1952), Three Blind Mice (1952), American Patrol (1951), Battle Hymn of the Republic (1950) and Back Room Entrance. These were live performances produced by Louis D. Snader in Hollywood. Back Room Blues (1950) was directed by Louis &quot;Duke&quot; Goldstone.

In 1986, Red Nichols was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.

<text>Lawrence James Shields (September 13, 1893 – November 21, 1953) was an early American dixieland jazz clarinetist. He was a member of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, the first jazz band to record commercially.

==Background==
Shields was born into an Irish-American family in Uptown New Orleans, on the same block where jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden lived. Shields&#x27; family were musical; his brothers Harry, Pat (guitar), and Eddie (piano) all played music professionally.

Shields started playing clarinet when he was 14 and played with Papa Jack Laine&#x27;s bands. He was one of the early New Orleans musicians to go to Chicago, first heading north in the summer of 1915 to join Bert Kelly&#x27;s band, then with Tom Brown&#x27;s band, before joining the Original Dixieland Jass Band (ODJB) in November 1916. The following year that band made the first jazz phonograph records, propelling Shields&#x27; playing to national prominence. Around this time, he also played occasionally with King Watzke&#x27;s band.

After leaving the ODJB in 1921, he played with various bands in New York City (including briefly with Paul Whiteman) before moving to Los Angeles, California where he remained throughout the 1920s, leading his own band and appearing briefly in some Hollywood films.

In the 1930s, Shields returned to Chicago and joined the reformed ODJB. He then worked for a while at &quot;Nick&#x27;s&quot; in New York before returning to play in New Orleans and, later, in California. He died in Los Angeles in 1953.

==Influence==

His playing, especially on phonograph records, was an important influence on later jazz clarinetists, including Benny Goodman. Larry Shields inspired Dink Johnson to begin playing the clarinet, in a 1950 interview with Floyd Levin he stated: &quot;I was actually a drummer, you know. I had always wanted to play the clarinet since hearing Larry Shields with the Original Dixieland Jazz Band.&quot;

He co-wrote the ODJB classics &quot;Clarinet Marmalade&quot; with Henry Ragas and &quot;At the Jazz Band Ball&quot;, &quot;Ostrich Walk&quot;, and &quot;Fidgety Feet&quot; with Nick LaRocca. These compositions became jazz classics and standards that were re-recorded by later jazz bands.

==Honors==
In 2006, his 1917 recording of &quot;Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot; with the Original Dixieland Jass Band was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<text>The Bishops&#x27; Bible is an English edition of the Bible which was produced under the authority of the established Church of England in 1568. It was substantially revised in 1572, and the 1602 edition was prescribed as the base text for the King James Version that was completed in 1611.

==History==
The Bishops&#x27; Bible succeeded the Great Bible of 1539, the first authorised bible in English, and the Geneva Bible published by Sir Rowland Hill in 1560.

The thorough Calvinism of the Geneva Bible (more evident in the marginal notes than in the translation itself) offended the high-church party of the Church of England, to which almost all of its bishops subscribed. Though most mainstream English clergy agreed with much of Calvin&#x27;s theology, the majority did not approve of his prescribed church polity, Presbyterianism, which sought to replace government of the church by bishops (Episcopalian) with government by lay elders. However, they were aware that the Great Bible of 1539—which was the only version then legally authorized for use in Anglican worship—differed, in that much of the Old Testament and Apocrypha was translated from the Latin Vulgate, rather than from the original Hebrew and Aramaic. In an attempt to replace the objectionable Geneva translation, they circulated one of their own, which became known as the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot;.

The promoter of the exercise, and the leading figure in translating was Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury. It was at his instigation that the various sections translated by Parker and his fellow bishops were followed by their initials in the early editions. For instance, at the end of the book of Deuteronomy, the initials &quot;W.E.&quot; are found, which, according to a letter Parker wrote to Sir William Cecil, stand for William Alley, Bishop of Exeter. Parker tells Cecil that this system was &quot;to make [the translators] more diligent, as answerable for their doings&quot;. Parker failed to commission anyone to act as supervisory editor for the work completed by the various translators, and was too busy to do so himself, and accordingly translation practice varies greatly from book to book. Hence, in most of the Old Testament (as is standard in English versions) the tetragrammaton YHWH is represented by &quot;the LORD&quot;, and the Hebrew &quot;Elohim&quot; is represented by &quot;God&quot;. But in the Psalms the practice is the opposite way around. The books that Parker himself worked on are fairly sparingly edited from the text of the Great Bible, while those undertaken by Grindal of London emerged much closer to the Geneva text.
The bishops deputed to revise the Apocrypha appear to have delivered very little, as the text in these books broadly reproduces that of the Great Bible. As the Apocrypha of the Great Bible was translated from the Latin Vulgate, the Bishops&#x27; Bible cannot strictly claim to have been entirely translated from the original tongues.

The Bishops&#x27; Bible was first published in 1568, but was then re-issued in an extensively revised form in 1572. In the revision a number of switches were made to the New Testament in the direction of more &quot;ecclesiastical&quot; language (e.g. introducing the term &quot;charity&quot; into I Corinthians 13), but otherwise to bring the text more into line with that found in the Geneva Bible; and in the Old Testament, the Psalms from the Great Bible were printed alongside those in the new translation, which had proved impossible to sing. The new psalm translation was printed only once more (in 1585) and otherwise dropped altogether; while further incremental changes were made to the text of the New Testament in subsequent editions. The Bible had the authority of the royal warrant, and was the second version appointed to be read aloud in church services (cf. Great Bible, King James Bible). It failed to displace the Geneva Bible as a domestic Bible to be read at home, but that was not its intended purpose. The intention was for it to be used in church as what would today be termed a &quot;pulpit Bible&quot;. The version was more grandiloquent than the Geneva Bible. The first edition was exceptionally large and included 124 full-page illustrations. The second and subsequent editions were rather smaller, around the same size as the first printing of the King James Bible, and mostly lacked illustrations other than frontispieces and maps. The text lacked most of the notes and cross-references in the Geneva Bible, which contained much controversial theology, but which were helpful to people among whom the Bible was just beginning to circulate in the vernacular. The last edition of the complete Bible was issued in 1602, but the New Testament was reissued until at least 1617. William Fulke published several parallel editions up to 1633, with the New Testament of the Bishops&#x27; Bible alongside the Rheims New Testament, specifically to controvert the latter&#x27;s polemical annotations. The Bishops&#x27; Bible or its New Testament went through over 50 editions, whereas the Geneva Bible was reprinted more than 150 times.

==Legacy==
The translators of the King James Version were instructed to take the 1602 edition of the Bishops&#x27; Bible as their basis, although several other existing translations were taken into account. After it was published in 1611, the King James Version soon took the Bishops&#x27; Bible&#x27;s place as the &quot;de facto&quot; standard of the Church of England. Later judgments of the Bishops&#x27; Bible have not been favorable; David Daniell, in his important edition of William Tyndale&#x27;s New Testament, states that the Bishops&#x27; Bible &quot;was, and is, not loved. Where it reprints Geneva it is acceptable, but most of the original work is incompetent, both in its scholarship and its verbosity&quot;. Jack P. Lewis, in his book &quot;The Day after Domesday: The Making of the Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot;, notes that unsympathetic reviews of this Bible have been done. However, &quot;[G]ranting all the shortcomings eighteenth- to twenty-first-century scholarship can find in the Bishops&#x27; Bible, it was an important stage in moving English people from prohibited Bible reading to being a Bible-reading people. The revisers labored to give God&#x27;s book to God&#x27;s people in a language they could understand. The King James translators did not think they were making a bad translation into a good one, but were making a good one better.&quot;

Unlike Tyndale&#x27;s translations and the Geneva Bible, the Bishops&#x27; Bible has rarely been reprinted; however, facsimiles are available. The most available reprinting of its New Testament portion (minus its marginal notes) can be found in the fourth column of the &quot;New Testament Octapla&quot; edited by Luther Weigle, chairman of the translation committee that produced the Revised Standard Version.

The Bishops&#x27; Bible is also known as the &quot;Treacle Bible&quot;, because of its translation of Jeremiah 8:22 which reads &quot;Is there not treacle at Gilead?&quot;, a rendering also found in several earlier versions as well such as the Great Bible. In the Authorized Version of 1611, &quot;treacle&quot; was changed to &quot;balm&quot;, in reference to the Balm of Gilead.

<doc id="174128" wikidata="Q41556" url="?curid=174128" title="Yamamoto Gonnohyōe">
<text>, was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy and twice Prime Minister of Japan from 1913 to 1914 and again from 1923 to 1924.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Yamamoto was born in Kagoshima in Satsuma Province (now Kagoshima Prefecture) as the sixth son of a samurai who served as a secretary and &quot;sōjutsu&quot; master of the Shimazu clan. As a youth, he took part in the Anglo-Satsuma War. He later joined Satsuma&#x27;s Eighth Rifle Troop in the Boshin War that ended the Tokugawa shogunate, fighting at the Battle of Toba–Fushimi and other locations; he was also aboard one of the ships that pursued Enomoto Takeaki and the remnants of the Tokugawa fleet to Hokkaidō in 1869. After the success of the Meiji Restoration, Yamamoto attended preparatory schools in Tokyo and entered the 2nd class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1870. At the time of the Satsuma Rebellion, he briefly returned to Kagoshima, but at the urging of Saigo Takamori, he returned to the Naval Academy before the start of combat.

===Naval career===

After graduation in 1874, Yamamoto went on a training cruise to Europe and South America aboard Imperial German Navy vessels from 1877 to 1878, and as junior officer acquired much sea experience. He wrote a gunnery manual that became the standard for the Imperial Japanese Navy and served as executive officer of the cruiser on its shakedown voyage from Elswick to Japan (1885 to 1886). After serving as captain of the corvette , he accompanied Navy Minister Kabayama Sukenori on a trip to the United States and Europe that lasted over a year (1887 to 1888).

As commander of the cruiser , he undertook a confidential mission to meet Qing General Yuan Shikai in Hanseong (Seoul), Korea (1890). Afterwards, he assumed command of the .

Working under his patron, Navy Minister Saigō Tsugumichi from 1893, Yamamoto became the real leader of the navy; initiating numerous reforms, attempting to end favoritism toward officers of his own Satsuma province, attempting to end officers from profiteering from military office, and attempting to attain roughly equal status with the Army in the Supreme War Council. He also pushed for an aggressive strategy towards the Chinese Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95). Yamamoto was promoted to rear admiral in 1895 and to vice admiral in 1898.

===As Minister of the Navy===

In November 1898, Yamamoto was appointed Navy Minister under the second Yamagata Aritomo administration. By this time, the Russian Empire was already perceived as the greatest threat to Japan, and Yamamoto advised the government that it was possible that Japan would win a conflict against Russia, albeit at the cost of more than half of the Imperial Japanese Navy. He sponsored promising junior officers a &quot;brain trust&quot;, including Akiyama Saneyuki and Hirose Takeo, whom he sent as naval attachés to the United States, United Kingdom and Russia to gather intelligence and to make strategic assessments of capabilities. Domestically, he pushed for increased capacity and modernisation of shipyards and steel mills, and for the increased import of higher quality coal from the United Kingdom to power his warships. Externally, he was a strong supporter of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. As an indication of the increased independence and prestige of the Navy, Emperor Meiji appeared in naval uniform during a public appearance for the first time. Yamamoto was made baron (&quot;danshaku&quot;) under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system in 1902; and he was promoted to the rank of admiral in 1904.

As Minister of the Navy during the Russo-Japanese War, Yamamoto showed strong leadership and was responsible for appointing Tōgō Heihachirō as commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet. He gave voice to Tōgō&#x27;s reports when he read aloud his reports from the war to the assembled Diet.

Yamamoto was replaced as Navy Minister by Saito Makoto in January 1906. He was elevated to count (&quot;hakushaku&quot;) in 1907.

==As Prime Minister==

In February 1913, Yamamoto became Prime Minister of Japan, succeeding Katsura Taro as leader of then Rikken Seiyukai political party. During Yamamoto&#x27;s first term as the prime minister, he abolished the rule that both the Navy Minister and Army Minister had to be active duty officers. This rule gave the military a stranglehold over the civilian government since the military could withdraw their minister and refuse to appoint a successor. Failure to fill the post would cause the existing cabinet to collapse. Thus, Yamamoto gained a reputation for being a liberal and a supporter of public claims for democracy and constitutional government. However, his administration was plagued by charges of corruption and he was forced to resign with his entire cabinet in April 1914 to take responsibility for the Siemens-Vickers Naval Armaments scandal, even though it was never proved that he was personally involved.

Under the succeeded Okuma administration, Yamamoto was transferred to naval reserves. During World War I and the subsequent disarmament treaty negotiations, he remained sidelined.

Yamamoto was recalled to government as Prime Minister again on 2 September 1923 in the emergency &quot;earthquake cabinet&quot; caused by the sudden death of Prime Minister Katō Tomosaburō immediately following the Great Kantō earthquake. He showed leadership in the restoration of Tokyo which had been heavily damaged by the earthquake. He also attempted to reform the electoral system to permit universal male suffrage. However, he and his cabinet were forced to resign again in January 1924, this time over the attempt by Namba Daisuke to assassinate Prince Regent Hirohito on 27 December 1923 (the Toranomon Incident).

Subsequently, Yamamoto withdrew from political life completely. Suggestions that he be made one of the &quot;Genrō&quot; were vehemently opposed by his life-long political enemy, Saionji Kinmochi, who also blocked all efforts for him to have a seat on the Privy Council. In December 1933, nine months after the death of his wife, Yamamoto died of complication due to benign prostatic hyperplasia at his home in Takanawa, Tokyo at the age of 82. His grave is at the Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

<text>&quot;Gensui&quot; [[Count]] Terauchi Masatake (), GCB (5 February 1852 – 3 November 1919), was a Japanese military officer and politician. He was a &quot;Gensui&quot; (or Marshal) in the Imperial Japanese Army and the Prime Minister of Japan from 1916 to 1918.

==Biography==
===Military career===
Terauchi Masatake was born in Hirai Village, Suo Province (present-day Yamaguchi city, Yamaguchi Prefecture), and was the third son of Utada Masasuke, a samurai in the service of Chōshū Domain. He was later adopted by a relative on his mother&#x27;s side of the family, Terauchi Kanuemon, and changed his family name to &quot;Terauchi&quot;.

As a youth, he was a member of the Kiheitai militia from 1864, and fought in the Boshin War against the Tokugawa shogunate from 1867, most notably at the Battle of Hakodate. After the victory at Hakodate, he travelled to Kyoto, where he joined the Ministry of War and was drilled by French instructors in Western weaponry and tactics. He became a member of Emperor Meiji&#x27;s personal guard in 1870 and travelled with the Emperor to Tokyo. He left military service in 1871 to pursue language studies, but was recalled with the formation the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army in 1871 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant after attending the Army&#x27;s Toyama School. He was appointed to the staff of the new Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1873. he fought in the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877 and was injured and lost his right hand during the Battle of Tabaruzaka. His physical disability did not prove to be an impediment to his future military and political career.

In 1882, he was sent to France as aide-de-camp to Prince Kan&#x27;in Kotohito and was appointed a military attaché the following year. He remained in France for studies until 1886. On his return to Japan, he was appointed deputy secretary to the Minister of the Army. In 1887, he became commandant of the Army Academy. In 1891, he was chief of staff to the IJA 1st Division and in 1892 was Chief of the First Bureau (Operations) of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff.

With the start of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Terauchi was appointed Secretary of Transportation and Communication for the Imperial General Headquarters, which made him responsible for all movement of troops and supplies during the war. In 1896, he was assigned command of the IJA 3rd Infantry Brigade. In 1898, he was promoted to become the first Inspector General of Military Training, which he made one of the three highest positions in the army. In 1900, he became Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, and went to China to personally oversee Japanese force during the Boxer Rebellion

===Political career===

Terauchi was appointed as Minister of the Army in 1901, during the first Katsura administration. The Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) occurred during his term in office. After the Japanese victory in the war, he was ennobled with the title of &quot;danshaku&quot; (baron) in the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage. He was also made a chairman of the South Manchurian Railway Company in 1906.In 1907, in recognition of the four wars he had served in, his peerage title was elevated to that of &quot;shishaku&quot; (viscount),

He continued in office as Army Minister under the first Saionji administration and the second Katsura administration from July 1908 to August 1911.

===Korean Resident-General===
Following the assassination of former Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi in Harbin by a Korean nationalist, An Jung-geun in October 1909, Terauchi was appointed to replace Sone Arasuke as the third and last Japanese Resident-General of Korea in May 1910. As Resident-General, he executed the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty in August of the same year, and he thus became the first Japanese Governor-General of Korea. In this position, he reported directly to the Emperor and as proconsul had wide-ranging powers ranging from legislative, administrative, and judicial to effect changes and reforms. The annexation of Korea by Japan and subsequent policies introduced by the new government was highly unpopular with the majority of the Korean population, and Terauchi (who concurrently maintained his position as Army Minister) employed military force to maintain control. However, he preferred to use the deep historical and cultural ties between Korea and Japan as justification for the eventual goal of complete assimilation of Korea into the Japanese mainstream. To this end, thousands of schools were built across Korea. Although this contributed greatly to an increase in literacy and the educational standard, the curriculum was centered on Japanese language and Japanese history, with the intent of assimilation of the populace into loyal subjects of the Japanese Empire.

Other of Terauchi&#x27;s policies also had noble goals but unforeseen consequences. For example, land reform was desperately needed in Korea. The Korean land ownership system was a complex system of absentee landlords, partial owner-tenants, and cultivators with traditional but without legal proof of ownership. Terauchi&#x27;s new Land Survey Bureau conducted cadastral surveys that reestablished ownership by basis of written proof (deeds, titles, and similar documents). Ownership was denied to those who could not provide such written documentation (mostly lower class and partial owners, who had only traditional verbal &quot;cultivator rights&quot;). Although the plan succeeded in reforming land ownership/taxation structures, it added tremendously to Korean hostility, bitterness, and resentment towards Japanese administration by enabling a huge amount of Korean land (roughly 2/3 of all privately owned lands by some estimates) to be seized by the government and sold to Japanese developers.

In recognition of his work in Korea, his title was raised to that of &quot;hakushaku&quot; (count) in 1911.

Isabel Anderson, who visited Korea and met Count Terauchi in 1912, wrote as follows:

For reference, the $12 million figure in Anderson&#x27;s book is roughly equivalent to $373.1 million in 2023.

=== As Prime Minister ===
In June 1916, Terauchi he received his promotion to the largely ceremonial rank of &quot;Gensui&quot; (or Field Marshal). In October, he became Prime Minister, and concurrently held the cabinet posts of Foreign Minister and Finance Minister. His cabinet consisted solely of career bureaucrats as he distrusted career civilian politicians.

During his tenure, Terauchi pursued an aggressive foreign policy. He oversaw the Nishihara Loans (made to support the Chinese warlord Duan Qirui in exchange for confirmation of Japanese claims to parts of Shandong Province and increased rights in Manchuria) and the Lansing–Ishii Agreement (recognizing Japan&#x27;s special rights in China). Terauchi upheld Japan&#x27;s obligations to the United Kingdom under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in World War I, dispatching ships from the Imperial Japanese Navy to the South Pacific, Indian Ocean and Mediterranean, and seizing control of German colonies in Qingdao and the Pacific Ocean. After the war, Japan joined the Allies in the Siberian Intervention (whereby Japan sent troops into Siberia in support of White Russian forces against the Bolshevik Red Army in the Russian Revolution).

In September 1918, Terauchi resigned his office, due to the rice riots that had spread throughout Japan due to inflation; he died the following year.

His decorations included the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class) and Order of the Golden Kite (1st Class).

The billiken doll, which was a Kewpie-like fad toy invented in 1908 and was very popular in Japan, lent its name to the Terauchi administration, partly due to the doll&#x27;s uncanny resemblance to Count Terauchi&#x27;s bald head.

==Legacy==
Terauchi&#x27;s eldest son, Count Terauchi Hisaichi, was the commander of the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s Southern Expeditionary Army Group during World War II. The 2nd Count Terauchi also held the rank of &quot;Gensui&quot; (or Marshal) like his father. Terauchi&#x27;s eldest daughter married Count Hideo Kodama, the son of General Kodama Gentaro.

<text>was a Japanese politician who served as the Prime Minister of Japan from 1918 until his assassination.

Hara held several minor ambassadorial roles before rising through the ranks of the Rikken Seiyūkai and being elected to the House of Representatives. Hara served as Home Minister in several cabinets under Saionji Kinmochi and Yamamoto Gonnohyōe between 1906 and 1913. Hara was appointed prime minister following the Rice Riots of 1918 and positioned himself as a moderate, participating in the Paris Peace Conference, founding the League of Nations, and relaxing oppressive policies in Japanese Korea. Hara&#x27;s premiership oversaw the Siberian intervention and the suppression of the March 1st Movement in Japanese-occupied Korea. Hara was assassinated by Nakaoka Kon&#x27;ichi, a far-right nationalist, on 4 November 1921.

Hara was the first commoner and first Christian appointed to be Prime Minister of Japan, informally known as Hara Kei, and given the moniker of .

==Early life==
Hara Takashi was born on 15 March 1856 in Motomiya, a village near Morioka, Mutsu Province, into a &quot;samurai&quot; family in service of the Nanbu Domain. Hara&#x27;s family had resisted the Meiji Restoration in 1868 and fought against the establishment of the very government which Hara himself would one day lead. Hara was an outsider in Japanese politics due to his association with a former enemy clan of the new Imperial Government, which at the time was dominated by the former clans of Chōshū and Satsuma domains.

Hara left home at the age of 15 and moved to Tokyo by boat. Hara failed the entrance examination of the prestigious Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, and instead joined the Marin Seminary, a free parochial school established by the French. It was here that he learned to speak French language fluently. Soon after that, Hara joined the law school of the Ministry of Justice (later University of Tokyo), but left without graduating to take responsibility for a student protest against the school&#x27;s room and board policy. At the age of 17, Hara was baptized as a Catholic, taking on &quot;David&quot; as his baptismal name. Even though it was speculated that Hara became Christian for personal gain at the time, he remained a Christian in public life until the day he died. At the age of 19, Hara chose to classify himself as a rather than his family&#x27;s status as , a distinction for former samurai families who were not made into . At various times later in his political career, offers were made to raise his rank, but Hara refused them every time on the basis that it would alienate himself from the common men and limit his ability to gain entrance to the House of Representatives. Beginning in 1879, Hara worked as a newspaper reporter for three years, but quit his job in protest over efforts of his editors to make the newspaper a mouthpiece for the Rikken Kaishintō, a political party led by Ōkuma Shigenobu.

In 1882, Hara took a position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the request of Inoue Kaoru, the Foreign Minister at the time. Based on discussions Hara had with him on his views for the future of Japanese politics during a trip both men took to Korea in 1884, Inoue appointed Hara to become consul-general in Tianjin, and the first secretary to the embassy of Japan in Paris. Hara served as Vice-minister of Foreign Affairs and as ambassador to Korea under Mutsu Munemitsu. He then left the Foreign Ministry to work as a journalist for several years, and became the manager of a newspaper company, the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; based in Osaka.

==Political career==
In 1900, Hara returned to politics and joined Itō Hirobumi&#x27;s newly founded &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot;, becoming the first secretary-general of the party.

Hara ran successfully for the House of Representatives as a representative from his native Iwate Prefecture and was appointed Minister of Communications in the Fourth Ito Administration. Hara later served as Home Minister in several cabinets between 1906 and 1913, a powerful position that made it able for him to effect many reforms. Hara realized that a fundamental political issue in Japan was the tension between the elected government and the appointed bureaucracy, and his career was dedicated to weakening the power of the non-elected bureaucrats. As Home Minister, Hara tried to implement meritocracy by systematically dismissing local bureaucrats in local governments in every capacity from governors down to high school principals. Any public employee who fell under his power would be replaced by someone in whom he saw real ability instead of a mere useful recipient of a favor or nepotism. Thus, Hara created a system in which people with talent could rise to the top of the bureaucracy, regardless of their background or rank. Hara also understood that maintenance of the supremacy of the elected leaders depended on the government&#x27;s ability to develop the Japanese national infrastructure and on a long-term economic plan that would address regional as well as national interests.

In 1914, after heated debate, Hara was appointed the president of the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; to replace the outgoing leader, Saionji Kinmochi. Under Hara&#x27;s leadership, &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; first lost its majority control of the Diet in the 1915 general elections, but regained its majority in the 1917 general elections.

===Prime minister===

In 1918, Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake fell from office as a result of the Rice Riots of 1918, and Hara was appointed as his successor on 28 September. It was the first cabinet headed by a commoner. Also, Hara was the first civilian in Japanese history to become the administrative chief of any of the armed services, when he temporarily took charge of the Navy Ministry, in absence of the Navy Minister, Admiral Katō Tomosaburō, who was serving as the Japanese representative at the Washington Naval Conference.

As prime minister, Hara suffered in terms of popularity, because he refused to use his majority in the lower house to force through universal suffrage legislation. Hara&#x27;s cautious approach disappointed communists and socialists, who accused him of delaying universal suffrage as it would endanger his position in power. As a party politician, Hara had never been the favorite of the conservatives, bureaucrats and military, and he was widely despised by the ultranationalists. During his term of office, Japan participated in the Paris Peace Conference, and joined the League of Nations as a founding member. In Korea, Japan used military force to suppress the Samil Rebellion, but later began more lenient policies aimed at reducing opposition to Japanese rule. Particularly following the Samil Uprising, Hara pursued a conciliatory policy towards colonies, particularly Korea. Hara arranged for his political ally, Saitō Makoto, a political moderate, to take over as Governor-General of Korea; he instituted a colonial administration consisting mainly of civilians rather than military; and he permitted a degree of cultural freedom for Koreans, including (for the first time) a school curriculum that featured Korean language and history. Hara also sought to encourage a limited amount of self-rule in Korea – provided that, ultimately, Koreans remained under Japanese imperial control. His overtures, however, won few supporters either among Koreans or Japanese; the former considered them inadequate, the latter considered them excessive.

Hara oversaw most of the Siberian intervention, which led to growing antagonism between the government and the military.

Of Hara&#x27;s supposedly proactive policies, most were directed toward politicians, merchants, and conglomerates. In addition, there are some differences in the evaluation of Hara&#x27;s policies before and after his inauguration, such as the repeated incidents of jail charges and his negative attitude toward the implementation of the universal suffrage law, which was the people&#x27;s great desire.

==Assassination==
On 4 November 1921, Hara was stabbed to death by , a right-wing nationalist railroad switchman, at Tokyo Station while catching a train to Kyoto for a party conference. Nakaoka&#x27;s motives for assassinating Hara were his beliefs that Hara was corrupt, involving the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; in Japanese politics, going to pass universal suffrage, and his handling of the Nikolayevsk incident during the Siberian intervention a year earlier. Nakaoka was also influenced by his boss, who was a vocal opponent of Hara. Nakaoka was found guilty of murder. Prosecutors sought a death sentence, but Nakaoka was instead sentenced to life imprisonment. However, he was released from prison in 1934 after serving only 13 years.

Hara was replaced by Uchida Kōsai as acting prime minister until Uchida was replaced a week later by Takahashi Korekiyo.

As opposed to many of his contemporaries, Hara lived a relatively simple lifestyle in a rented home near Shiba Park in downtown Tokyo. In his will, he left very few assets behind but among these was his diary, stating that &quot;After a period of some years my diary must be made public. It is the most valuable of all my possessions, so it must be protected.&quot; According to the will, Hara&#x27;s diary was made public and what came to be called the turned out to be one of the most valuable first hand accounts of the political scene in that era. Most of his daily activities are written along with opinions and thoughts regarding the political figures of the time. Hara&#x27;s diary itself is thousands of pages long and reveals, in depth, a broad range of information previously unknown to historians.

<text>Viscount was a Japanese politician who served as prime minister of Japan from 1921 to 1922 and Minister of Finance when he was assassinated. He was also a member of the House of Peers and head of the Bank of Japan.

Takahashi made many contributions to Japan&#x27;s development during the early 20th century, including introducing its first patent system and securing foreign financing for the Russo-Japanese War. Following the onset of the Great Depression, he introduced controversial financial policies which included abandoning the gold standard, lowering interest rates, and using the Bank of Japan to finance deficit spending by the central government. His decision to cut government spending in 1935 led to unrest within the Japanese military, who assassinated him in February 1936. Takahashi&#x27;s policies are credited for pulling Japan out of the Depression, but led to soaring inflation following his assassination, as Takahashi&#x27;s successors became highly reluctant to cut off funding to the government.

==Early life==
Takahashi was born in Edo (modern-day Tokyo), while Japan was still under the Tokugawa shogunate. He was the illegitimate son of a court painter in residence at Edo Castle, and adopted as the son of Takahashi Kakuji, a low-ranking &quot;samurai&quot; in the service of the Date &quot;daimyō&quot; of Sendai Domain. He studied the English language and American culture in a private school run by the missionary James Hepburn (the forerunner of Meiji Gakuin University). On 25 July 1867, he set sail from Japan to Oakland, California, in the United States, and found employment as a menial laborer. Another version of the story has it that he went to the United States to study, but was sold as a slave by his landlord and only with some difficulty was he able to return to Japan.

==Career==

After his return to Japan in 1868, Takahashi taught English conversation. He later became the first master of the &quot;&quot; high school in Tokyo (currently Kaisei Academy), and at the same time worked as a low-ranking bureaucrat in the Ministry of Education, and then in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. He was appointed as the first chief of the Bureau of Patents, a department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and helped organized the patent system in Japan. At one point, he resigned his government positions and went to Peru to start a silver mining enterprise, but failed.

Takahashi became an employee of the Bank of Japan in 1892, and his talents were soon recognized, as he rose to become vice-president in 1898.

During and after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, Takahashi raised foreign loans that were critical to Japan&#x27;s war effort. He met personally with American financier Jacob Schiff, who floated half of Japan&#x27;s loans in the U.S. He also raised loans from the Rothschild family in Britain.

For this success, he was appointed to the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan in 1905.

Takahashi was named president of the Yokohama Specie Bank in 1906. He was made a baron (&quot;danshaku&quot;) under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system in 1907.

Takahashi was Governor of the Bank of Japan from 1 June 1911, through 20 February 1913.

===Political offices===

In 1913, Takahashi was appointed Minister of Finance by Prime Minister Yamamoto Gonnohyōe and then joined the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; political party. He was re-appointed by Prime Minister Hara Takashi in 1918. In 1920, Takahashi&#x27;s title was elevated to viscount (&quot;shishaku&quot;). After Hara was assassinated in 1921, Takahashi was appointed both Prime Minister and the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; party president.

Takahashi was the second Christian Prime Minister in Japanese history. His term lasted less than seven months, primarily due to his inability as an outsider to control the factions in his party, and his lack of a power base in the party.

After resigning as Prime Minister, Takahashi still retained the position of president of the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot;. He resigned his seat in the House of Peers in 1924, and was elected to a seat in the Lower House of the Diet of Japan in the 1924 General Election. When Katō Takaaki became the prime minister and set up a coalition cabinet in 1924, Takahashi accepted the post of Minister of Agriculture and Commerce. He divided the department into the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Takahashi resigned from the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; in 1925.

==Death==
Takahashi served as Finance Minister under the administrations of Tanaka Giichi (1927–1929), Inukai Tsuyoshi (1931–1932), Saitō Makoto (1932–1934) and Okada Keisuke (1934–1936). To bring Japan out of the Great Depression of 1929, he instituted dramatically expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, abandoning the gold standard in December 1931, and running deficits. Despite considerable success, his fiscal policies involving reduction of military expenditures created many enemies within the military; and he was among those assassinated by rebelling military officers in the February 26 Incident of 1936. His grave is at the Tama Reien Cemetery in Fuchū, Tokyo. Along with Saitō Makoto (who was also assassinated during the Incident), Takahashi would be the last former Japanese prime minister to be assassinated until the Assassination of Shinzo Abe 86 years later in 2022.

===Peerages===
* Baron (23 September 1907)
* Viscount (7 September 1920)

===Decorations===
* Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure (1 April 1906; 5th Class: 28 December 1902; 6th Class: 25 October 1889)
* Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (7 September 1920)
* Grand Cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur (3 July 1924)
* Grand Cordon of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers (3 June 1927)
* Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum (26 February 1936; posthumous)
* Senior Second Rank (26 February 1936; posthumous)

==Legacy==

* Takahashi appeared on a 50 Yen banknote issued by the Bank of Japan in 1951. It is the only time that a former president of the Bank of Japan has appeared on one of Japan&#x27;s banknotes.
* Takahashi&#x27;s Tokyo residence is now the &quot;Takahashi Korekiyo Memorial Park&quot; in Tokyo&#x27;s Minato Ward, Akasaka. However, a portion of the building survives in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei city, Tokyo.
* Takahashi&#x27;s fiscal and monetary policies during the Great Depression were in many ways similar to what Keynes later published just a few years later in 1936 in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. It is thought but not proven that Takahashi&#x27;s success contributed heavily to Keynes&#x27; theories.
* Ben Bernanke, chairman of the United States Federal Reserve, characterized Takahashi as a man who &quot;brilliantly rescued Japan from the Great Depression&quot;, and Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe cited Takahashi as an inspiration for his Abenomics policies. On the other hand, Bank of Japan president Masaaki Shirakawa characterized Takahashi&#x27;s policies of central bank support for the government as a &quot;bitter experience&quot;, and in 1982 the Bank of Japan itself characterized Takahashi&#x27;s Depression-era policies as &quot;the bank&#x27;s biggest mistake in its 100-year history&quot;.

Born in Hiroshima, Aki Province (modern Hiroshima Prefecture) to a &quot;samurai&quot; family, Katō enrolled in the 7th class Imperial Japanese Naval Academy and graduated second out of a class of 30 cadets. He specialized in both naval artillery and in navigation.

===Naval career===

After his commissioning as lieutenant, Katō served on the corvette in 1887, followed by the cruiser . During the First Sino-Japanese War, he served in a combat position as gunnery officer on the cruiser . After the end of the war, he served in numerous staff positions before promotion to commander. He was executive officer on the battleship , and captain of the . He was promoted to rear admiral on 1 September 1904.

During the Russo-Japanese War, Katō served as chief of staff to Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō on the battleship , assisting in Japan&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Tsushima. During this time, he suffered from a very weak stomach, and was vomiting as he issued orders throughout the battle, despite having taken large amounts of medication.

Katō became Vice Minister of the Navy in 1906, and was promoted to vice admiral on 28 August 1908. In 1909, he was appointed commander of the Kure Naval District, and in 1913 became Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet.

Katō became Minister of the Navy in August 1915, days before his promotion to full admiral on 28 August 1915. He served in this post in the cabinets of Ōkuma Shigenobu, Terauchi Masatake, Hara Takashi, and Takahashi Korekiyo. Under Hara and Takahashi, Katō was Japan&#x27;s chief commissioner plenipotentiary to the Washington Naval Conference, and worked with Ambassador Shidehara Kijurō in the negotiations that led to the Five-Power Treaty.

===As Prime Minister===
Following his return to Japan, Katō was appointed 21st Prime Minister of Japan in recognition of his performance at the Washington Naval Conference. His cabinet consisted mainly of bureaucrats and members of the House of Peers, which proved unpopular with the Imperial Japanese Army. During his tenure as prime minister, Katō implemented the provisions of the Washington Naval Agreement, withdrew Japanese forces from Shandong in China and ended Japanese participation in the Siberian Intervention. 

=== Death ===
Katō succumbed to late-stage colon cancer and died a little over a year into his term.

Katō was given the honorary rank of Marshal Admiral the day before his death, and posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum and his title raised to &quot;shishaku&quot; (viscount).

His death came only a week before the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, and therefore Japan was without a prime minister during that disaster.

Katō&#x27;s grave is at Aoyama Cemetery, Tokyo.

<doc id="174136" wikidata="Q381739" url="?curid=174136" title="Kiyoura Keigo">
<text>Count was a Japanese politician. He was the Prime Minister of Japan in 1924, during the period which historians have called the &quot;Taishō Democracy&quot;.

== Early life ==
Kiyoura was born Ōkubo Fujaku in Kamoto, Higo Province (part of present-day Yamaga, Kumamoto), as the fifth son of Ōkubo Ryōshi, the abbot of Menshōji Temple. He studied at the private school of Hirose Tanso from 1865 to 1871. During this time, he befriended Governor Nomura Morihide and took up the name &quot;Kiyoura Keigo&quot;.

== Political career ==
Nomura was appointed governor of Saitama Prefecture in 1873 and appointed Kiyoura to a junior-grade civil service position there.

In 1876, at the age of twenty-six, Kiyoura joined the Ministry of Justice, and served as a prosecutor and helping draft Japan&#x27;s first modern Criminal procedures laws. In 1884 he caught the attention of Yamagata Aritomo who appointed him head of the police forces in Japan, despite his relative youth of 34. Kiyoura went on to serve as Vice Minister of Justice, and Minister of Justice and while at the Ministry of Justice, he helped draft the Peace Preservation Law of 1887.

In 1891, he was selected as a member of the House of Peers by Imperial nomination. A close ally of Yamagata Aritomo, he was rewarded with numerous cabinet positions, including that of Justice Minister in the second Matsukata and second Yamagata administrations, and Justice, Agriculture and Commerce ministers in the first Katsura administration.

In 1902, Kiyoura was elevated to the title of baron (&quot;danshaku&quot;) in the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system. He received the 1st class of the Order of the Sacred Treasures the following year, and in 1906 was awarded with the 1st class of the Order of the Rising Sun. In September 1907, his title was elevated to viscount (&quot;shishaku&quot;).

In 1914, when Kiyoura was a Privy Councillor, he received an imperial order appointing him Prime Minister of Japan following Yamamoto Gonnohyōe. However, Kiyoura declined the post because of the controversy involving the ongoing Siemens scandal and Ōkuma Shigenobu was chosen to become prime minister instead.

== Prime Minister ==

Kiyoura accepted a second imperial order in 1924 following the Toranomon Incident, and became Prime Minister of Japan. However, his cabinet was formed at a time when non-partisan, aristocratic cabinets were falling out of favor, and the Diet&#x27;s lower house held up most of his initiatives for all six months of his administration.

Perhaps the most important event during his term as prime minister was the royal wedding of Crown Prince Hirohito (the future Emperor Shōwa) with Nagako Kuniyoshi (the future Empress Kōjun) on 26 January 1924.

In 1924, he dissolved the Lower House of the Diet of Japan when faced with the three party coalition of the &quot;Kenseikai&quot;, &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; and &quot;Kakushin Club&quot; which had formed a majority in Diet of more than 150 seats. As a result of his massive rout in the subsequent general election, his cabinet resigned en masse.

In November 1928, Kiyoura was elevated to the title of Count (&quot;hakushaku&quot;). He was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum in 1942.

<doc id="174137" wikidata="Q315563" url="?curid=174137" title="Katō Takaaki">
<text>Count was a Japanese politician, diplomat, and Prime Minister of Japan from 1924 until his death on 28 January 1926, during the period which historians have called &quot;Taishō Democracy&quot;. He was also known as Katō Kōmei.

==Early life==
Katō was born as Hattori Sokichi, the second son of a former &quot;samurai&quot; retainer of the Owari Tokugawa domain in Nagoya, Owari Province, in the town of Saya, Ama District in what is now part of the city of Aisai, Aichi Prefecture. He was adopted by Katō Bunhei at the age of 13, and attended the University of Tokyo, from which he graduated at the top of his class from the Law Department in 1881, specializing in English common law. After graduation, he worked as an employee of Mitsubishi &quot;zaibatsu,&quot; and was sent to London for two years. On his return to Japan in 1885, he became an assistant manager at the Mitsubishi head office in Marunouchi, Tokyo. In 1886, he married Haruji, the eldest daughter of Iwasaki Yatarō, the president of Mitsubishi.

==As cabinet minister and ambassador==

In 1887, Katō became private secretary to Ōkuma Shigenobu, who was then Minister of Foreign Affairs, and worked with Ōkuma on the revision of the unequal treaties. Subsequently, he served as director of the Banking Bureau in the Finance Ministry.

From 1894 to 1899, he served as envoy to the United Kingdom, and in 1900, during the 4th Itō administration, he became Foreign Minister; however, the Ito administration remained in office only a few months. During his period in the United Kingdom and in the Foreign Ministry, he helped lay the foundations for the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which was concluded in 1902. In 1902 he was elected a member of the House of Representatives in the Diet from Kōchi Prefecture.

Appointed again as Foreign Minister in the Saionji cabinet (1906), he resigned after a brief interval, being opposed to the nationalization of the private railways, which the cabinet approved. He then remained without office until 1908, when he accepted the post of ambassador in London. He received an honorary GCMG, and earned the reputation of being one of the strongest among the junior statesmen. He resigned his post as ambassador in December 1912, and again served as Foreign Minister in the 3rd Katsura and 2nd Ōkuma administrations, but soon resigned. He created a Constitutionalist party, becoming its president in 1913, and joined the cabinet as Foreign Minister in April 1914.

He was thus foreign minister at the outbreak of World War I, and in the words of Hew Strachan (&quot;The First World War&quot;, p. 72): &quot;Of all the world&#x27;s statesmen in 1914, Katō proved the most adroit at using war for the purposes of policy. Domestically he exploited it to assert the dominance of the Foreign Ministry and of the cabinet in the making of Japan&#x27;s foreign policy. Internationally he took the opportunity to redefine Japan&#x27;s relationship with China. In doing so he was not simply outflanking the extremists opposed to him; he was also honouring his own belief that Japan should be a great power like those of Europe.&quot;

Katō&#x27;s decision that Japan should enter World War I greatly angered the &quot;genrō,&quot; who had not been consulted, and who therefore felt that their power and authority were being slighted. In addition, Katō created considerable controversy in January 1915, when he issued the Twenty-One Demands to China, which sparked a major international incident and considerable opposition domestically.

==As Prime Minister==

In 1915, Katō was selected as a member of the House of Peers by Imperial command. He became president of the conservative &quot;Kenseikai&quot; political party in the following year, whose policies he greatly influenced with his opposition to the &quot;genrō&quot;, support of the constitution and support for extension of popular suffrage.

Katō was appointed Prime Minister of Japan from 1924 until his death in early 1926. His cabinet was nicknamed the &quot;Goken Sanpa Naikaku&quot; (Cabinet based on the three pro-Constitution factions), which, despite its coalition nature, was able to enact significant legislation. In 1925, Katō had the General Election Law enacted, which extended the vote to all male citizens over the age of 25. He also ratified the Peace Preservation Law, which suppressed leftist political organizations, and concluded the Soviet–Japanese Basic Convention. He also initiated universal military service. Katō strove to reduce government spending, but also suffered considerable personal criticism for his family links with Mitsubishi.

==Death==
Katō Takaaki died in office from pneumonia in 1926, aged 66.

<text>Thomas &quot;Papa Mutt&quot; Carey (September 17, 1891 – September 3, 1948) was an American jazz trumpeter.

==Early life==
Carey was born in Hahnville, Louisiana, and moved to New Orleans with his family in his youth. His older brother Jack Carey was a trombone player and bandleader; Mutt was playing cornet in his brother&#x27;s band by about 1912.

== Career ==
Although Carey&#x27;s early work was with brass bands in the New Orleans area (1913–17), in 1914, he started working with Kid Ory and would continue to do so, on and off, through the 1910s.

After touring the vaudeville circuits in 1917, he returned to New Orleans in 1918 and then went to California with Ory in 1919, eventually taking over leadership of the band when Ory left in 1925.

Carey&#x27;s big band, the Jeffersonians, appeared in the silent films &quot;The Legion of the Condemned&quot; and &quot;The Road to Ruin&quot; (both 1928).

Carey rejoined Ory&#x27;s band from around 1929 to 1933, when the lack of work during the Depression led him to work as a Pullman porter. In 1941, he was a pallbearer at the funeral of Jelly Roll Morton in Los Angeles.

In March 1944 Carey rejoined Ory in an all-star band that was a leader of the West Coast revival of traditional New Orleans jazz, put together for the CBS Radio series &quot;The Orson Welles Almanac&quot;. The All Star Jazz Group also included Ed Garland, Jimmie Noone (succeeded by Barney Bigard), Bud Scott, Zutty Singleton and Buster Wilson. Renamed Kid Ory&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band, the group then made a significant series of recordings on the Crescent Records label.

Carey left Ory&#x27;s band in 1947 to lead a group under his own name.

== Personal life ==
Carey died in Lake Elsinore, California, on September 3, 1948, aged 56.

<doc id="174140" wikidata="Q335177" url="?curid=174140" title="Wakatsuki Reijirō">
<text>Baron was a Japanese politician and Prime Minister of Japan.

== Early life ==
Wakatsuki Reijirō was born on 21 March 1866, in Matsue, Izumo Province (present day Shimane Prefecture), the second son of samurai foot soldier (&quot;ashigaru&quot;) Okumura Sensaburō and his wife Kura. Though the family was of the samurai warrior nobility, they were very poor, and worked side jobs to support themselves. When Reijirō was three years old, his mother died. As the father and the eldest brother were ordered to work in Yamazaki, Kyoto by the Matsue Domain, the responsibilities of the house fell onto Reijirō&#x27;s 11-year-old elder sister Iwa who took care of the three-year-old Reijirō while having a side job. The Okumura family were low-ranking even among the &quot;ashigaru&quot;, and the family could not have a residence near the center of Sakaimachi. For this reason, the family lived in a rented house on the outskirts of the town, but by the time Reijirō was born, his father had just constructed a small house in Nishitanaka.

At the time, samurai were required to wear their katana (typically two), and Reijirō commuted to temple school wearing only one wooden sword on his hip. After graduating from elementary school, he entered a Chinese literary school, but quit the following year entering a middle school in Matsue. However, he was forced to quit middle school in just eight months because his family could not afford the tuition fees. After quitting school, he collected firewood in the mountains and helped with house chores.

At the age of 16, he began working as an elementary school substitute teacher. In 1883, he decided to enter the Imperial Japanese Army Academy as the tuition fees were government expensed, but failed the physical examination. The next year, he heard about student recruitment by the Law School of the Ministry of Justice, which also had its tuition fees covered by the government. However, the examination took place in Tokyo, and the travel fees were not covered. He consulted his uncle, who was the head of Nogi District, and was able to borrow 30 yen from him. In 1884, Reijirō left Matsue at the age of 19.

Reijirō adopted the surname Wakatsuki after marrying into the family of his wife, since that family had no male heir. He enrolled in the Tokyo Imperial University in 1892 and studied law.

== Early career ==
After graduation, Wakatsuki worked in the Ministry of Finance as tax bureau director and later as vice-minister. In 1911 he was appointed to the House of Peers. He then served as Minister of Finance under the 3rd Katsura administration and 2nd Ōkuma administration in the early 1910s and became a leading member of the &quot;Rikken Dōshikai&quot; political party, and its successor the &quot;Kenseikai&quot;, in 1914.

In June 1924, Wakatsuki was named Home Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Katō Takaaki, and worked to enact the Universal Manhood Suffrage Law and the Peace Preservation Law in 1925.

== As Prime Minister ==

On 30 January 1926, on Katō&#x27;s unexpected death in office, Wakatsuki took over as Prime Minister of Japan. His first term lasted to 20 April 1927 when he was forced to resign during the Shōwa financial crisis.

Wakatsuki remained physically active in his senior years, enjoying jiu-jitsu, archery, fishing, and sailing. During a sailing excursion as prime minister with two bodyguards and his secretary, Wakatsuki&#x27;s sampan struck a log and overturned. The bodyguards could not swim so the 60-year-old Wakatsuki and his secretary kept the group afloat until another boat arrived to assist them.

Wakatsuki was awarded the Order of the Paulownia Flowers on November 10, 1928. After serving as chief delegate plenipotentiary to the London Naval Conference 1930, Wakatsuki pushed strongly for speedy ratification of the disarmament treaty, thus earning the wrath of the Japanese military and various ultranationalist groups.

After Prime Minister Hamaguchi was forced out of office by the severe injuries incurred in an assassination attempt, Wakatsuki assumed the leadership of the &quot;Rikken Minseitō&quot;, the successor to the &quot;Kenseikai&quot;. He was elevated to the rank of baron (&quot;danshaku&quot;) in the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system in April 1931. Wakatsuki once again became Prime Minister from 14 April 1931 to 13 December 1931. During Wakatsuki&#x27;s second term, he failed to control the Imperial Japanese Army. He was unable either to prevent the Manchurian Incident from occurring, or to rein in the Army from further escalation of hostilities in China afterwards.

==Later life==
After his retirement as Prime Minister, Wakatsuki became president of the &quot;Rikken Minseitō&quot; in July 1934. Despite the growing militarism in Japanese society, he continued to oppose the Second Sino-Japanese War, and was adamantly opposed to extending the war to include the United States and other western powers. Even after the declaration of hostilities in World War II, he publicly stated the war should end as quickly as possible. In May 1945, on hearing of the collapse of Nazi Germany, he emerged from retirement to urge Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki to open negotiations with the United States as soon as possible. In August, he participated in the government panel recommending unconditional acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration.

After the surrender of Japan, Wakatsuki was subpoenaed by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in June 1946 as a prosecution witness at The International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Wakatsuki died of Angina pectoris at his summer home in Itō, Shizuoka on November 20, 1949. His grave is at the Somei Cemetery in downtown Tokyo.

<text>Baron was a Japanese general and politician who served as Prime Minister of Japan from 1927 to 1929.

Born to a &quot;samurai&quot; family in the Chōshū Domain, Tanaka became an officer in the Imperial Japanese Army and rose through the ranks. He served as Minister of the Army under Prime Ministers Hara Takashi and Yamamoto Gonnohyōe. After retiring from active duty he accepted the presidency of the Rikken Seiyūkai, a major conservative party. Following the resignation of the Wakatsuki Cabinet in 1927, Tanaka was appointed Prime Minister. In foreign affairs, he pursued a hawkish policy; in domestic affairs, he sought to suppress communist movements. Criticised for his handling of the unauthorised assassination of Zhang Zuolin by a Kwangtung Army officer, he resigned in 1929 and died soon afterwards.

==Early life and military career==
Tanaka was born as the third son of a low-ranking &quot;samurai&quot; family in the service of Chōshū Domain in Hagi, Nagato Province (modern day Yamaguchi Prefecture), Japan. At the age of 13, he participated in the Hagi Rebellion. He had an interest in politics from an early age, serving on a village council and as an elementary school teacher. He only joined the Imperial Japanese Army at the age of 20.

He graduated from the former 8th class of Imperial Japanese Army Academy and the 8th class of the Army War College in 1892, and served as a junior officer during the First Sino-Japanese War. After the end of the war, he was sent as a military attaché to Moscow and Petrograd, and was in Russia at the same time as Takeo Hirose of the Imperial Japanese Navy, with whom he became close friends. Tanaka was fluent in the Russian language, which he learned while attending mass every Sunday at a Russian Orthodox church, which enabled him to practice his Russian at church social events, although it is uncertain if he ever actually converted to Christianity. As one of the few Russian experts within the military, he was an invaluable resource to Army planners during the Russo-Japanese War, and served as aide to General Kodama Gentarō in Manchuria.

In 1906, Tanaka helped draft a defense plan which was so highly regarded by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff and General Yamagata Aritomo that it was adopted as basic policy until World War I. He was also awarded the Order of the Golden Kite (3rd class) in April 1906.

In 1910, he established a Veterans Association. Tanaka was promoted to major general in 1911, and was made director of the Military Affairs Bureau at the Ministry of the Army, where he recommended an increase in the strength of the standing army by two additional infantry divisions. He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure (1st class) in September 1918. He joined the cabinet of Prime Ministers Hara Takashi as Army Minister from September 1918 to June 1921. He was promoted to full general in 1920 and was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class). He was also elevated to the title of &quot;danshaku&quot; (baron) under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system. However, the Hara cabinet came under unceasing criticism due to the Nishihara Loans, the disastrous Nikolayevsk incident and accusations of Army misappropriation of secret funds, and supporting unsavory figures such as White Movement general Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. After suffering from an attack of angina, Tanaka resigned all posts, and retired to his summer home in Oiso, Kanagawa.

==Political career==

Tanaka returned as Army Minister in the 2nd Yamamoto administration from September 1923 to January 1924. After retiring from the army, Tanaka was invited to accept the post of party president of the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; political party in 1925 and was made a member of the House of Peers from January 1926. He had been scheduled to be promoted to the rank of Field Marshal at the time of his retirement. However, when news reached the ears of the Army Ministry of a 3 million Yen bonus that Tanaka received on agreeing to join the &quot;Rikken Seiyukai&quot;, the promotion was denied.

Tanaka became Prime Minister of Japan on 20 April 1927, during the Shōwa financial crisis, serving simultaneously as the Foreign Affairs Minister. He later added the posts of Home Minister (4 May 1928 to 23 May 1928), and Colonial Affairs Minister (10 June 1929 to 2 July 1929) to his portfolio.

On the domestic front, Tanaka attempted to suppress leftists, Communists and suspected Communist sympathizers through widespread arrests (the 15 March incident of 1928, and the 19 April incident of 1929).

On foreign policy, Tanaka differed from his predecessor Shidehara both tactically and strategically. Whereas Shidehara preferred to evacuate Japanese residents where conflicts occurred with local people, Tanaka preferred using military force. While Shidehara theoretically respected China&#x27;s sovereignty, Tanaka openly pursued a to create a sense of difference between those areas and the rest of China. On three separate occasions in 1927 and 1928 he sent troops to intervene militarily in Shandong Province to block Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Northern Expedition to unify China under Kuomintang rule, in what became known as the Jinan Incident.

Tanaka came into office even as forces were already beginning to converge that would draw Japan into World War II. In 1928, however, the machinations of the ultranationalist secret societies and the Kwantung Army resulted in a crisis: the assassination of the Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin and the failed attempt to seize Manchuria. Tanaka himself was taken by surprise by the assassination plot and argued that the officers responsible should be publicly court-martialed for homicide. The military establishment, from which Tanaka was by now estranged, insisted on covering up the facts of the incident, which remained an official secret. Bereft of support, and under mounting criticism in the Diet and even from Emperor Hirohito himself, Tanaka and his cabinet resigned en masse on 2 July 1929.

Tanaka was succeeded by Hamaguchi Osachi, and died a few months after his resignation. He was awarded the Order of the Paulownia Flowers on his death. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Fuchū, Tokyo.

==Tanaka Memorial==
In 1929, China accused Tanaka of having authored the &quot;Tanaka Memorial Imperialist Conquest Plan,&quot; which advocated the conquest of Manchuria, Mongolia, and eventually the whole of China. He was alleged to have presented the plan to the emperor in 1927. The plan was presented as fact in the wartime propaganda film series &quot;Why We Fight&quot;, which claimed that the plan envisaged the conquest of America after East Asia. In a memoir published in the mid-1950s, a Japanese-born Taiwanese businessman, Tsai Chih-Kan, claimed that he had personally copied the &quot;Plan&quot; from the Imperial Library on the night of 20 June 1928 in a covert action assisted by several of Japan&#x27;s leading prewar politicians and officers, who were opposed to Tanaka. Today, most historians regard the document as a forgery.

<doc id="174142" wikidata="Q351661" url="?curid=174142" title="Hamaguchi Osachi">
<text>Hamaguchi Osachi (Kyūjitai: ; Shinjitai: , 1 April 1870 – 26 August 1931) was a Japanese politician who was Prime Minister of Japan from 1929 to 1931. Nicknamed the due to his dignified demeanor and mane-like hair, Hamaguchi served as leading member of the liberal &quot;Rikken Minseitō&quot; (Constitutional Democratic Party) during the &quot;Taishō Democracy&quot; of interwar Japan. He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1915 until his death. He initially survived an assassination attempt by a right-wing extremist in 1930, but died about nine months later from a bacterial infection in his unhealed wounds.

==Early life and career==
Hamaguchi was born in Nagaoka District, Tosa Province (now part of Kōchi city, Kōchi Prefecture on the island of Shikoku). He was the third son of Minaguchi Tanehira, an official in the local forestry department, and took the Hamaguchi name on his marriage to Hamaguchi Natsuko in 1889. 

Hamaguchi graduated from the Law College of Tokyo Imperial University in 1895 and began his career as a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Finance. 

In 1907, he rose to the position of Director of the Monopoly Bureau. He became Vice Communications Minister in 1912 and Vice Finance Minister in 1914.

==Political career==

Hamaguchi joined the &quot;Rikken Dōshikai&quot; political party led by Katō Takaaki in 1915, which became the &quot;Kenseikai&quot; in 1916. Hamaguchi was elected to the lower house in the Japanese Diet in 1915 from the Kōchi Second District, and was to hold onto this seat until his death in 1931.

In June 1924, Hamaguchi served as Finance Minister under the first Katō administration, holding the same portfolio under the 1st Wakatsuki administration from January to June 1926. As Finance Minister, he pursued fiscal retrenchment, and proposed reducing government spending by 17 percent and laying off tens of thousands of government workers; however, his policies had to be scaled considerably back due to strenuous opposition from government bureaucrats.

Hamaguchi was subsequently Home Minister in the Wakatsuki cabinet from June 1926 to April 1927. In a continuation of his efforts while as Finance Minister, Hamaguchi promoted a moral campaign through sponsorship of movies which emphasized thrift and reduced public consumption, with the goal of helping reduce Japan&#x27;s trade deficit.

In 1927, Hamaguchi became the chairman of the new &quot;Rikken Minseitō&quot; political party formed by the merger of the &quot;Kenseikai&quot; and the &quot;Seiyūhontō.&quot;

== 1st Hamaguchi administration ==

After the collapse of the administration of Tanaka Giichi in June 1929, Hamaguchi was selected to become Prime Minister of Japan and formed a cabinet based largely on Minseitō party members, which supported domestic economic reforms over overseas military adventurism. With a strong sense of his own rectitude and a tough, stubborn temperament, Hamaguchi inspired trust, promising that he was &quot;ready to die if necessary&quot; for the good of the country during his inaugural speech and promising an administration free of corruption.

Hamaguchi&#x27;s primary concern was the Japanese economy, which had been in an ever-increasing recession since the end of World War I, and had been greatly weakened by the devastation caused by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. Hamaguchi promoted retrenchment, deflation and the rationalization of industry. The 1929 Great Depression, starting soon after he took office, put further pressure on the economy.

Initial public confidence and strong support from Emperor Hirohito and his entourage, including the &quot;genrō&quot; Saionji Kinmochi allowed Hamaguchi to implement fiscal austerity measures, which included ratification of the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which curtailed military spending. However, his measures to help stimulate exports, such as maintaining the Japanese yen on the gold standard, proved disastrous.

The failure of Hamaguchi&#x27;s economic policies played into the hands of right-wing elements, already enraged by the government&#x27;s conciliatory foreign policies and Japan&#x27;s increasing unemployment problems. The opposition &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; joined forces with the vocal anti-Treaty faction within the Imperial Japanese Navy to accuse Hamaguchi of infringing of the military&#x27;s &quot;right of supreme command&quot; as guaranteed under the Meiji Constitution.

Hamaguchi&#x27;s initial popularity quickly waned, and he fell victim to an assassination attempt on 14 November 1930 when he was shot inside Tokyo Station by Tomeo Sagoya, a member of the &quot;Aikokusha&quot; ultranationalist secret society. (Nine years earlier another Prime Minister, Hara Takashi, had been assassinated near the same place.) The head of the &quot;Aikoku-sha&quot; was &quot;Seiyūkai&quot; politician Ogawa Heikichi. The wounds kept Hamaguchi hospitalized for several months.

== 2nd Hamaguchi administration ==

Hamaguchi was reelected to a second term as Prime Minister of Japan in March 1931. However, with his health continuing to deteriorate, he was unable to attend the 59th Session of the Imperial Diet, which opened with Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara as acting Prime Minister. The &quot;Seiyūkai&quot; immediately attacked the government on the grounds that the Prime Minister was not physically present, and that Shidehara was not even a member of the &quot;Minseitō&quot;. When Shidehara further created an uproar with a comment concerning Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s support of the London Naval Treaty, the &quot;Seiyūkai&quot; refused to participate in budget deliberations until Hamaguchi could attend. Despite his failing health, Hamaguchi was forced to attend the Diet, but resigned a month later to be replaced by Wakatsuki Reijirō. He died on 26 August of the same year, and his grave is at the Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

Tomeo Sagoya was not tried for murder. Nevertheless, in 1932, he was sentenced to death for attempted murder, after the judge ruled that the bullet had caused Osachi&#x27;s death. Yoshikatsu Matsuki was sentenced to 13 years in prison as an accomplice, while Ainosuke Iwata received a 4-month sentence. However, in 1934, Sagoya&#x27;s death sentence was reduced to life in prison in a general amnesty. He was one of many people involved in politically motivated murders, including that of prime ministers, to have their sentences reduced. Sagoya was released from prison in 1940, and died in 1972. He continued to be involved in far-right activities until his death.

In 1931 Hamaguchi&#x27;s cabinet sponsored a bill on women&#x27;s suffrage. It would have granted women over the age of 25 the right to vote in local elections and stand for office given their husbands&#x27; approval. The bill passed the lower house, but it was defeated in the House of Peers in March 1931 by a vote of 184 to 62.

<text>A crime of passion (), in popular usage, refers to a violent crime, especially homicide, in which the perpetrator commits the act against someone because of sudden strong impulse such as anger or jealousy rather than as a premeditated crime. A high level of social and legal acceptance of crimes of passion has been historically associated with France from the 19th century to the 1970s, and until recently with Latin America.

==Description==
The &quot;crime of passion&quot; defense challenges the &quot;mens rea&quot; element by suggesting that there was no malice aforethought, and instead the crime was committed in the &quot;heat of passion&quot;. In some jurisdictions, a successful &quot;crime of passion&quot; defense may result in a conviction for manslaughter or second degree murder instead of first degree murder, because a defendant cannot ordinarily be convicted of first degree murder unless the crime was premeditated. A classic example of a crime of passion involves a spouse who, upon finding their partner in bed with another, kills the romantic interloper.

Additionally, the gay panic defense and or &quot;trans panic&quot; defenses can from time to time fall under the label of a &quot;crime of passion&quot;, as was the defense of Michael Magidson and José Merel after they were put to trial after murdering trans woman Gwen Araujo.

In the United States, claims of &quot;crimes of passion&quot; have been traditionally associated with the defenses of temporary insanity or provocation. It was used as a defense in murder cases during the 1940s and 1950s. Historically, such defenses were used as complete defenses for various violent crimes, but gradually they became used primarily as a partial defense to a charge of murder; if the court accepts temporary insanity, a murder charge may be reduced to manslaughter.

In some countries, notably France, &quot;crime passionnel&quot; (or &quot;crime of passion&quot;) was a valid defense to murder charges. During the 19th century, some such cases resulted in a custodial sentence for the murderer of two years. After the Napoleonic code was updated in the 1970s, paternal authority over the members of the family was ended, thus reducing the occasions for which crime passionnel could be claimed. The Canadian Department of Justice has described crimes of passion as &quot;abrupt, impulsive, and unpremeditated acts of violence committed by persons, who have come face to face with an incident unacceptable to them, and who are rendered incapable of self-control for the duration of the act.&quot;

Crimes of passion were widely accepted in Southern United States states, especially in Texas. Texas, unlike most other states, did not only tolerate such crimes, but had a law which codified such killings as justifiable. Until 1973, Texas had a law which stated: &quot;Homicide is justifiable when committed by the husband upon one taken in the act of adultery with the wife, provided that the killing takes place before the parties to the act have separated. Such circumstance cannot justify a homicide where it appears that there has been, on the part of the husband, any connivance or assent to the adulterous connection.&quot; This law was repealed in 1973 by Senate Bill 34 during the 63rd Regular Session of the Texas Legislature.

==Advocacy==
In recent decades, feminists and women&#x27;s rights organizations have worked to change laws and social norms which tolerate crimes of passion against women. UN Women has urged states to review legal defenses of passion and provocation, and other similar laws, to ensure that such laws do not lead to impunity in regard to violence against women, stating that &quot;laws should clearly state that these defenses do not include or apply to crimes of &quot;honour&quot;, adultery, or domestic assault or murder.&quot;

The Council of Europe Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence states that member states should &quot;preclude adultery as an excuse for violence within the family&quot;.

There are differences between crimes of passion (which are generally impulsive and committed by and against both genders) and honour killings, as &quot;while crimes of passion may be seen as somewhat premeditated to a certain extent, honour killings are usually deliberate, well planned and premeditated acts when a person kills a female relative ostensibly to uphold his honour.&quot; However, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, argued that &quot;crimes of passion have a similar dynamic in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable&quot;. Some human rights advocates say that the crimes of passion in Latin America are treated leniently. Crimes of passion and honor killings often have similar triggers, particularly related to the sexual behavior (real or imaginary) of the victim, such as extramarital sex, premarital sex or homosexuality; and there have been accusations that the Western media creates artificial differentiation between the &#x27;foreign&#x27; forms of domestic violence, such as the honor killings that are most prevalent in the Middle East and South Asia, and the crimes of passion that are relatively common in North America, Europe and Latin America.

The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, the first legally binding international document on domestic violence, states at Article 42:

In recent years, advocacy and legal reform has focused on several areas of laws:
*repealing provisions which explicitly provided for mitigation or acquittal in crimes of passion (most such provisions focused on husbands killing wives due to adultery and fathers killing daughters due to premarital sex, e.g. such a law existed in Italy until 1981 - see below)
*reforming self defense laws by ensuring that vague wording does not lead to broad interpretation of the concept, such as the self-defense of family honor or reputation; according to UNWOMEN, &quot;Drafters should scrutinize self-defense provisions for vagueness that leaves open to interpretation whether the harm includes injury to &quot;honour&quot;. Wording such as &quot;dangerous or unjust act&quot; are vague and leave open to judicial discretion whether such self-defense provisions apply to &quot;honour&quot; crimes&quot;.
*reforming insanity related defenses, such as insanity, temporary insanity, irresistible impulse, diminished responsibility and other similar defenses to ensure that such defenses refer to genuine psychiatric medical conditions or genuine inability to comprehend due to objective factors (such as inhaling toxic fumes) and are not used as a legal fiction meant to justify domestic murders.
*reforming the provocation defense, particularly with regard to the triggers that can be claimed. For example, Canada has modified its provocation law in 2015, restricting its use, such that the provocative behavior of the victim must constitute a criminal offense punishable by 5 or more years (rather than just &quot;insult&quot;).

==Crimes of passion and attitudes towards women==
Crimes of passion are often committed against women due to beliefs about female sexuality and are often present in societies dominated by strong double standards related to male and female sexual behaviors, particularly related to premarital sex and adultery. Indeed, with regard to adultery, many societies, such as Latin American countries, have been dominated by very strong double standards regarding male and female adultery, with the latter being seen as a much more serious violation. Such ideas were also supported by laws in the West; for example, in the UK, before 1923, a man could divorce solely on the wife&#x27;s adultery, but a woman had to prove additional fault (e.g., adultery &quot;and&quot; cruelty). Similarly, passion defenses to domestic murders were often available to men who killed unfaithful wives, but not to women who killed unfaithful husbands (France&#x27;s crime of passion law, that was in force until 1975, is an example). In traditional societies, women could not complain about mistresses, concubines, and in many cultures even other wives (such as polygyny); whereas male sexual jealousy was recognized as the highest emotion that could justify even murder. Similarly, crimes of passion legislation made reference to fathers killing their daughters, but not sons, for premarital sex (such as Italy&#x27;s law that was in effect until 1981); or Philippines&#x27;s law that continues to be in effect to this day (see Art. 247 called &quot;Death or physical injuries inflicted under exceptional circumstances&quot;.). With regard to Philippines, this double standard is also seen in the crimes dealing with extramarital sex, which are defined differently for women and men, and punished more severely for women (see Articles 333 and 334).

Historically, some societies considered homicide committed by a wife against her husband as a more severe crime than homicide committed by a husband against his wife. This was the case in the UK, where, under English law, until 1828, homicide committed against a social superior, which included a wife killing her husband, was classified as petty treason (which for women incurred burning at stake) and was a crime more severe than murder, because it was seen as threatening the hierarchical social order. In England and Wales, petty treason ceased to be a distinct offence from murder by virtue of the Offences against the Person Act 1828. It was abolished in Ireland in 1829.

In the Roman Empire the Roman law &quot;Lex Julia de adulteriis coercendis&quot; implemented by Augustus Caesar in 18 BC permitted the killing of daughters and their lovers who committed adultery at the hands of their fathers and also permitted the killing of the adulterous wife&#x27;s lover at the hand of her husband.

==Crimes of passion and juries==
The role of juries in trials of crimes of passion is controversial. In Brazil especially, there have been concerns that the jury system is deeply flawed, both due to the bias of juries, and due to the legal framework, which gives immense power to juries, and there is little that can be done even in jury decisions that are in blatant violation of the law. In Brazil, there is no &quot;right&quot; of a man to kill his wife, in fact the legal right of a husband to kill his wife due to adultery was abolished very early, in 1830. Nevertheless, acquittals in cases of men killing their wives have been very common throughout the 19th and 20th century, and have happened even in the 21st century. Men have been acquitted for killing wives due to a variety of reasons, including infidelity, attempting to leave the relationship, and refusing to have sex. In 1991, the Supreme Court ruled that the so-called legitimate defense of honor, used in these trials, has no basis in Brazilian law. Nevertheless, the legitimate defense of honor has continued to be used, including in a 2017 case of attempted murder where a man was acquitted for stabbing his ex-wife. The Supreme Court upheld the acquittal on the basis that the decision of a jury is sovereign and may not be altered. In 2021, the Supreme Court was asked to analyze the legitimate defense of honor, and ruled that the defense is not part of Brazilian law, reiterating the 1991 decision, and also ruled that this defense is unconstitutional; the ruling provided for the possibly of the prosecution to contest the decision of the jury on the basis that it is void if such defense has been used, with the final ruling being affirmed in 2023. The Supreme Court unanimously considered that the legitimate defense of honor is contrary to the principles of gender equality, human dignity and protection of life provided for in the Constitution of Brazil, for which reason it prohibited its direct or indirect use during trials. It is still not clear how and whether the prohibition of this defense can be implemented. Legal experts and politicians have expresses serious concerns of the way juries operate in Brazil, calling the legal organization anachronistic. According to a criminal court judge:

::&quot;The popular jury trials for murder leave the prosecutor with no recourse. He can appeal a jury verdict or a sentence and be supported by the higher court, as in Lopes, but each case returns to the state jury tribunal...In this jury system the jury decides according to its conscience not according to the law.&quot;

A study prepared for the National Council on the Rights of Women found that:

::&quot;[the jury] &quot;doesn&#x27;t evaluate the crime in itself, but instead evaluates the victim and the accused&#x27;s life, trying to show how adapted each one is to what they imagine should be the correct behavior for a husband and wife...The man can always be acquitted if the defense manages to convince the jury that he was a good and honest worker, a dedicated father and husband, while the woman was unfaithful and did not fulfill her responsibilities as a housewife and mother...This way the ones involved in the crime are judged distinctly. Men and women are attributed different roles, in a pattern that excludes citizenship and equality of rights.&quot;

Brazil is not the only country where there are or have been controversies about juries in crimes of passion cases; the ability of juries to return fair verdicts in crimes of passion in the French Third Republic was a major issue. In India, it was a crime of passion that led to the abolition of jury trials, after a man was acquitted by a jury for killing his wife&#x27;s lover.

==By country==

===Australia===
In Australia, as in other common law jurisdictions, crimes of passion have traditionally been subjected to the partial defense of provocation, which converts what would have been murder into manslaughter. In recent years, the defence of provocation has come under increased criticism, and, as a result, legal changes have abolished or restricted its application: in 2003, Tasmania became the first state to abolish the partial defence of provocation in murder charges; the next state to abolish it was Victoria, in 2005; followed by Western Australia in 2008; and by South Australia in 2020. ACT and Northern Territory have amended the laws to exclude non-violent homosexual sexual advances, in 2004 and 2006, respectively. In Queensland the partial defense of provocation in section 304(1) of the Criminal Code was amended in 2011, in order to &quot;reduce the scope of the defence being available to those who kill out of sexual possessiveness or jealousy&quot;. In 2014, the New South Wales law on provocation was amended to provide that the provocative conduct of the deceased must also have constituted a serious indictable offense.

===Brazil===

Killing of wives due to adultery has been traditionally treated very leniently in Brazil, in court cases where husbands claimed the &quot;legitimate defense of their honor&quot; (&quot;legitima defesa da honra&quot;) as justification for the killing. Although this defense was not explicitly stipulated in the 20th-century Criminal Code, it has been successfully pleaded by lawyers throughout the 20th century, in particular in the countryside, though less so in the coastal big cities. In 1991 Brazil&#x27;s Supreme Court explicitly rejected the &quot;honor defense&quot; as having no basis in Brazilian law.

In the 21st century, Brazil has improved the legal status of women, with the new Civil Code of 2002; and through other legal changes such as repealing in 2005 the provision that exempted a rapist from punishment if he married his victim, and enacting laws against domestic violence in Brazil.

===France===
Crimes of passion have a strong association with France. Prior to 1975, the French Penal Code of 1810 stated at article 324 that &quot;in the case of adultery, provided for by article 336, murder committed upon the wife as well as upon her accomplice, at the moment when the husband shall have caught them in the fact, in the house where the husband and wife dwell, is excusable&quot; [meaning a punishment of 1 to 5 years, according to article 326]. In practice, however, many domestic violence crimes resulted in acquittal by the juries, which alarmed jurists and led them to question whether the citizen jurors of the Third Republic were competent to render justice. In the 1960s and 70s the attitudes towards domestic violence started to change, as in other European countries. On November 7, 1975, Law no. 617/75 Article 17 repealed Article 324. Many countries, including some western countries like Belgium, were legally influenced by the Article 324. Prior to 1997, Belgian law provided for mitigating circumstances in the case of a killing or assault against a spouse caught in the act of adultery. In Luxembourg, Article 413 (repealed in 2003) provided mitigating circumstances for murder, assault and injury of an adulterous spouse.

Article 324 of the French penal code was copied by Middle Eastern Arab countries. According to the Honour Based Violence Awareness Network, the penal codes that were enacted under the Napoleonic Empire influenced the development of laws in North Africa and the Middle East. These laws permit reduced sentences for murders that are &quot;related to honour&quot;. The French Article 324 inspired Jordan&#x27;s Article 340 and Article 98. The 1858 Ottoman Penal Code&#x27;s Article 188 was also inspired by Article 324. Both the French Article 324 and Ottoman article 188 were drawn on to create Jordan&#x27;s Article 340, which was retained after a 1944 revision of laws, and still applies to this day.

The Napoleonic Code has been an extremely influential code. Many laws around the world have been modeled on it. The code was applied to all territories under Napoleon&#x27;s control and has also influenced several other countries in Europe and South America. In addition to leniency to crimes of passion, this code enshrined the unquestionable authority of men over their families and deprived women of any individual rights, and reduced the rights of illegitimate children. It also reintroduced colonial slavery. The example of the Napoleonic Code is often used in debates about Westernization, Europeanization and imperialism. The Napoleonic Code was also influential in the &quot;marry-your-rapist laws&quot; (in force in France until 1994), which were exported to other parts of the world too.

France also had a strong culture of dueling meant to uphold honor, and France was called by National Geographic &quot;the dueling capital of Europe&quot;. This dueling culture was also exported to Latin America, and was extremely strong in Uruguay (see below the section on Uruguay). In Corsica, a place influenced throughout the centuries both by Italian and French culture, there was a strong custom of vendetta, which required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged their family honor. Between 1821 and 1852, no fewer than 4,300 vendetta killings were perpetrated in Corsica.

Stories about adulterous women, suicides and homicides committed due to &#x27;passion&#x27;, featured prominently in French literature in the 19th century, and &quot;In literature as in life, unconventional women needed to be severely punished lest their defiant attitudes inspire further acts of rebellion&quot;.

===Haiti===
Haiti, a former French colony, had a crime of passion law similar to that of France until 2005, when it was abolished. Adultery was also decriminalized in 2005.

===Italy===
Italy has a long tradition of treating crimes of passion with leniency. Until 1981, the law read: &quot;Art. 587: He who causes the death of a spouse, daughter, or sister upon discovering her in illegitimate carnal relations and in the heat of passion caused by the offence to his honour or that of his family will be sentenced to three to seven years. The same sentence shall apply to whom, in the above circumstances, causes the death of the person involved in illegitimate carnal relations with his spouse, daughter, or sister.&quot;

===Portugal===
Portugal has a long tradition of tolerating, and even encouraging, crimes of passion, under the &quot;legitimate defense of honor&quot;, which was also brought to Brazil. During the authoritarian Estado Novo regime, (1933–1974) women&#x27;s rights were restricted. Although improvements in tackling domestic violence have been achieved, particularly with legal reforms in 1982, lenient punishments continue to be given by judges, partly due to the strongly patriarchal ideology that still persists in the judicial system. Although the Supreme Court of Justice in recent years has, in most cases, rejected the defense of &quot;passion&quot; in domestic homicides, such defense remains open to use due to the legal framework of murder in Portuguese law, namely article 133. This article is very broad in scope, is subject to interpretation, and has a very low punishment of only 1 to 5 years, which due to the regulations of the Portuguese Penal Code, usually results in suspended sentences. This article, called &quot;Privileged homicide&quot; (&quot;Homicídio privilegiado&quot;) states that when the murder takes place under an understandable violent emotion, compassion, despair or other socially or morally relevant motive, such as to significantly diminish the murderer&#x27;s degree of guilt, the punishment in this case is 1 to 5 years. Furthermore, the Criminal Code under Articles 71 and 72, provides guidelines to sentencing for crimes, making reference to honorabale motives and provocation by the victim. The international GREVIO expert body which is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Istanbul Convention by the State Parties (which include Portugal) has called on the Portuguese authorities to reform the Criminal Code, to ensure that it is compatible with article 42 of the convention, which states that &quot;Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that, in criminal proceedings initiated following the commission of any of the acts of violence covered by the scope of this Convention, culture, custom, religion, tradition or so‐called “honour” shall not be regarded as justification for such acts. This covers, in particular, claims that the victim has transgressed cultural, religious, social or traditional norms or customs of appropriate behaviour.&quot;

Portugal was one of the last European countries to decriminalize adultery - the adultery law (which treated female and male adultery differently) was repealed in 1982, and the punishment for female adultery in the 20th century in Portugal was one of the most severe in the Western world. With regard to homicide law, before 1975, the law provided for a symbolic punishment of only 6 months exile from the district for killing of a spouse or daughter under 21 caught in the act of adultery/premarital sex. The &quot;Decree-Law 262/75 on 27 May 1975&quot; repealed article 372 of the Penal Code which provided for such mitigation; nevertheless courts continued to routinely use general mitigation factors to give lenient punishments for husbands who killed out of jealousy or relationship breakup throughout the 1980s and 1990s; the concept of holding women as partly responsible for crimes committed against them extended to other crimes too, such as rape and kidnapping; for example in 1989 the Portuguese Supreme Court of Justice ruled that two hitchhiking young tourists who were kidnapped and raped had contributed to the crimes committed against them. It was only in the 21st century that a different attitude started to be more commonly adopted by the courts, as public and political discourse against of domestic violence started to grow.

===United Kingdom===

Killing due to adultery traditionally fell under the provocation defense. In 1707, English Lord Chief Justice John Holt described the act of a man having sexual relations with another man&#x27;s wife as &quot;the highest invasion of property&quot; and claimed, in regard to the aggrieved husband, that &quot;a man cannot receive a higher provocation&quot;.

In 2009 a man was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter by reason of provocation for stabbing his partner and his best friend to death when he found them having sex.

Although provocation in English law was abolished on 4 October 2010 by section 56(1) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, it was replaced by a relatively similar by more narrowly drafted defence of &quot;loss of control&quot; created by section 54.

There has been considerable controversy regarding the application by the courts of the new law; although section 55 states &quot;(6) In determining whether a loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger (...) (c) the fact that a thing done or said constituted sexual infidelity is to be disregarded&quot;, in a controversial decision by Lord Judge in &quot;R v Clinton&quot; in the Court of Appeal, Lord Judge interpreted the new offence as allowing for sexual infidelity to count under the third prong of the new defence (see Baker and Zhao 2012). This decision has received heavy criticism from academics. Vera Baird has also been very critical of the decision, writing, &quot;It seems that parliament says infidelity doesn&#x27;t count and the court says it does.&quot;

===Uruguay===
In Uruguay, crimes of passion were legally tolerated until 2017. In certain circumstances, the law exonerated a perpetrator when a killing or a battery was committed due to &quot;passion provoked by adultery&quot;. Article 36 of the Criminal Code provided for this:

&quot;&quot;Artículo 36. (La pasión provocada por el adulterio)&quot;

&quot;La pasión provocada por el adulterio faculta al Juez para exonerar de pena por los delitos de homicidio y de lesiones, siempre que concurran los requisitos siguientes:&quot;

:&quot;1. Que el delito se cometa por el cónyuge que sorprendiera infraganti al otro cónyuge y que se efectúe o contra el amante.&quot;
:&quot;2. Que el autor tuviera buenos antecedentes y que la oportunidad para cometer el delito no hubiera sido provocada o simplemente facilitada, mediando conocimiento anterior de la infidelidad conyugal.&quot;&quot;

Translation:

&quot;Article 36. (The passion provoked by adultery)

The passion provoked by adultery empowers the court to exempt from punishment for the crimes of homicide and injury, provided that the following conditions are present:
# The offense is committed by one spouse against the other spouse whom he or she has caught in the act, or against the lover.
# The perpetrator has a good record and the opportunity to commit the crime was not provoked or facilitated by prior knowledge of the marital infidelity.&quot;

Since 2013, there have been ongoing political efforts to remove this provision from the Criminal Code. On December 22, 2017, Article 36 of the Criminal Code was modified to remove the crime of passion.

Uruguay is a country where the case of violence against women has been considered a paradox and debated in the context that Uruguay is otherwise considered one of the most liberal countries in Latin America; nevertheless, domestic violence is a very serious problem; according to a 2018 United Nations study, Uruguay has the second-highest rate of killings of women by current or former partners in Latin America, after Dominican Republic. Despite having a reputation of being a progressive country, Uruguay has lagged behind with regard to its approach to domestic violence; for example, in Chile, considered one of the most socially conservative countries of the region, a similar legislation permitting such crimes of passion was repealed in 1953.

The culture of Uruguay has been strongly influenced by French culture, through French immigrants in the 19th century (see French Uruguayans), and, as such, the French concept of crime of passion was brought to Uruguay (see section above on France). The French dueling culture, meant to uphold honor, was also exported to Latin America, and was extremely strong in Uruguay. Uruguay&#x27;s honor culture has been prominent well into the 20th century, and duels survived in Uruguay until the 1970s, long after the practice had been abandoned in other parts of the Western world. Duels in Uruguay were widespread in the early 20th century, were legalized in 1920, in an unusual political move; and remained legal until 1992.

<doc id="174144" wikidata="Q354687" url="?curid=174144" title="Inukai Tsuyoshi">
<text>Inukai Tsuyoshi (, 4 June 1855 – 15 May 1932) was a Japanese statesman who was prime minister of Japan from 1931 to his assassination in 1932. At the age of 76, Inukai was Japan&#x27;s second oldest serving prime minister, after Kantarō Suzuki whose term ended at the age of 77.

==Early life==
Inukai was born 4 June 1855, in Kawairi, Kaya, Bitchū Province (in present-day Okayama, Okayama Prefecture), the second son of Inukai Genzaemon, a samurai, district magistrate and local official (&quot;ōjōya&quot;). His family was a branch of the Itakura clan, and were originally given a status that allowed them to wear a katana by the Niwase Domain.

In 1876, Inukai travelled to Tokyo and subsequently graduated from the Keio Gijuku (now Keio University) where he specialized in Chinese studies. In his early career, Inukai worked as a journalist for the &quot;Yūbin Hōchi Shimbun&quot; (now a sports newspaper subsidiary of the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;) and &quot;Akita Sakigake Shimpō&quot;. He went with the Imperial Japanese Army to the front during the Satsuma Rebellion as a reporter.

==Political career==
Ōkuma Shigenobu invited Inukai to help form the &quot;Rikken Kaishintō&quot; political party in 1882, which supported liberal political causes, strongly opposed the domination of the government by members of the former Chōshū and Satsuma domains, and called for a British-style constitutional monarchy within the framework of a parliamentary democracy.

Inukai was first elected to the Lower House of the Imperial Diet in 1890, and was reelected 17 times, holding the same seat for 42 years until his death.

Inukai&#x27;s first cabinet post was as Minister of Education in the first Ōkuma Shigenobu administration of 1898, succeeding Ozaki Yukio, who was forced to resign due to a speech that conservative elements in the Diet charged promoted republicanism. However, Ozaki&#x27;s resignation did not end the crisis, which culminated with the fall of the Ōkuma administration, so Inukai&#x27;s term lasted only eleven days. Inukai was a leading figure in the successors to the &quot;Rikken Kaishintō&quot;, the &quot;Shimpotō,&quot; &quot;Kenseitō&quot; and the &quot;Rikken Kokumintō,&quot; which eventually toppled the government of Katsura Tarō in 1913. During this time, his politics became increasingly conservative and he was associated with both leading figures from the Pan-Asian movement and with nationalists such as Tōyama Mitsuru. He was also a strong supporter of the Chinese republican movement, visiting China in 1907, and subsequently lending aid to Sun Yat-sen during the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 which overthrew the Qing dynasty. He later assisted Sun when Sun had to flee to Japan after his attempt to overthrow Yuan Shikai failed. Inukai had a deep respect for Chinese culture, and felt that Sino-Japanese cooperation was the cornerstone of Asian solidarity. Although in later years his vision of Sino-Japanese cooperation diverged greatly from Sun&#x27;s, Inukai maintained close personal ties with many leading Chinese politicians. Inukai likewise supported the Vietnamese independence leader, Prince Cường Để, and invited him to Japan in 1915.

Inukai returned to the cabinet as Minister of Communications in the second Yamamoto Gonnohyōe administration from 1923 to 1924. He was concurrently Education Minister again for a four-day period in September 1923

In 1922 the &quot;Rikken Kokumintō&quot; became the &quot;Kakushin Club,&quot; and joined forces with other minor parties to form the cabinet during the premiership of Katō Takaaki in 1924. During his time, Inukai served on the cabinet again as Minister of Communications. The &quot;Kakushin Club&quot; then merged with the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot;, and Inukai continued as a senior member.

In July 1929, Inukai travelled to Nanjing, China, with several other Japanese delegates at the invitation of Chinese government to a memorial service for Sun Yat-sen. The delegates later travelled to numerous other cities, and noted with concern the growing anti-Japanese sentiment. In 1929, after the sudden death of Tanaka Giichi, Inukai became president of the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot;. Inukai was an outspoken critic of Japan&#x27;s signing of the London Naval Treaty, which reduced military spending. He supported the actions of the Imperial Japanese Army in invading Manchuria in 1931, and rejected criticism from the League of Nations over the Mukden Incident.

==As Prime Minister==

Following the resignation of the Wakatsuki administration over its failure to control the military and the failure of its economic policies, Saionji Kinmochi, Japan&#x27;s sole surviving &quot;genrō&quot;, turned to Inukai to form a new government in 1931. Following his appointment, Inukai was instructed by Saionji to avoid drastic changes in either foreign policy or economics. Already disadvantaged by the fact that his Seiyukai was not the majority party in the Diet, he was also saddled with a cabinet composed of competing factions, ranging from his ultra-rightist Army Minister Sadao Araki to the liberal Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo. With a divided cabinet and a hostile Diet, Inukai governed with the assistance of the Privy Council, which passed emergency imperial edicts and budgetary measures to circumvent the normal Diet budgetary process.

Inukai immediately took steps to inflate the economy and to take Japan off the gold standard, implementing protectionist trade policies and attempting to stem Japan&#x27;s trade deficit. These actions devaluated the yen, thus lowering the price of Japanese goods in world markets, and increasing exports.

However, Inukai was forced to accede to a request by the Imperial Japanese Army to dispatch additional troops to Manchuria and to Tianjin, despite instructions as late as 23 December 1931 from Emperor Hirohito to maintain international trust per the Nine-Power Treaty in not attacking China, and on 27 December 1931 not to authorize any moves by the Kwantung Army to occupy Jinzhou. However, by now the Imperial Japanese Army was completely beyond any civilian control and from January to March 1932 the conflict had spread to Shanghai with the 1st Shanghai Incident.
During the 1932 General Election, buoyed by an upsurge in public opinion due to Japanese military successes in China, the Rikken Seiyukai won an overwhelming majority.

On 8 January 1932, a Korean independence activist named Lee Bong Chang attempted to assassinate Emperor Hirohito in the Sakuradamon Incident. Inukai and his cabinet immediately offered their resignations; however, Hirohito wished to downplay the incident and refused.

However, Inukai still came under strong criticism for his efforts to rein in the military, while reformists criticized him for not going far enough. Inukai&#x27;s efforts to limit further troop deployments to China and to defuse the Shanghai Incident through negotiations with the Chinese government drew increasing ire from the general public as well as the militarists. This soon metamorphosed into terrorist activity with the League of Blood Incident in which extremists targeted wealthy businessmen and liberal politicians. The group chose twenty victims but succeeded in killing only two: former Finance Minister and head of the &quot;Rikken Minseitō&quot;, Junnosuke Inoue, and Director-General of Mitsui Holding Company, Dan Takuma.

On 1 March, the state of Manchukuo was formally proclaimed. Symbolically, Inukai withheld formal diplomatic recognition as a gesture of displeasure against the radical faction within the Imperial Japanese Army, and out of concern due to the rapidly worsening international relations with the United States, on which country Japan depended for much of its raw materials and capital investment.

==Assassination==
Inukai&#x27;s struggle against the military led to his assassination during the May 15 Incident of 1932, which effectively marked the end of civilian political control over government decisions until after World War II. Inukai was shot by eleven junior Navy officers (most were just turning twenty years of age) in the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence in Tokyo. Inukai&#x27;s last words were roughly: to which his killers replied . The insurgents also attacked the residence of Makino Nobuaki, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, the residence and office of Saionji Kinmochi, headquarters of the Rikken Seiyukai, and tossed hand grenades into Mitsubishi Bank headquarters in Tokyo, and several electrical transformer substations. The original assassination plan had included killing the English film star Charlie Chaplin – who had arrived in Japan on 14 May and was Inukai&#x27;s guest – in the hope that this would provoke a war with the United States. However, at the time, Chaplin was watching a sumo wrestling match with the prime minister&#x27;s son, Inukai Takeru, and thus escaped. Inukai’s murderers received only light sentences for their actions.

Inukai&#x27;s third son was writer, politician and post-war Minister of Justice Inukai Takeru whose grand daughter is popular actress Sakura Ando. His son-in-law was noted diplomat Kenkichi Yoshizawa. Through Yoshizawa, His great-granddaughter was Sadako Ogata, who served as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from 1991 until 2001, and his great-grandson Yutaka Kawashima served as Grand Chamberlain to the Imperial Household.

<doc id="174145" wikidata="Q1432645" url="?curid=174145" title="Phillips Academy">
<text>Phillips Academy (also known as PA, Phillips Academy Andover, or simply Andover) is a private, co-educational college-preparatory school for boarding and day students located in Andover, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. The academy enrolls approximately 1,150 students in grades 9 through 12, including postgraduate students. It is part of the Eight Schools Association and the Ten Schools Admission Organization.

Founded in 1778, Andover is one of the oldest high schools in the United States. It has educated a long list of notable alumni through its history, including American presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, foreign heads of state, members of Congress, five Nobel laureates and six Medal of Honor recipients.

Andover admits students on a need-blind basis and provides financial aid covering 100% of students&#x27; demonstrated financial need. 47% of Andover students receive financial aid.

==History==

=== Revolutionary-era beginnings ===
Phillips Academy is the oldest incorporated academy in the United States. It was established in 1778 by Samuel Phillips Jr., a local businessman who hoped to educate Calvinist students for the ministry.

The American Revolutionary War had caused significant upheaval to education in New England, and Phillips Academy filled part of that gap. (For example, Boston Latin School shut down during the war because its headmaster John Lovell, a Loyalist, fled to British Canada after the fall of Boston in 1776.) The founders of Phillips Academy were strongly associated with the Patriot cause. Samuel Phillips and Eliphalet Pearson (later Andover&#x27;s first head of school) manufactured gunpowder for the Continental Army, and the founders attempted to stock Andover&#x27;s library with books confiscated from Loyalist families who had fled New England.

Several prominent Revolutionary figures maintained links with the academy, including George Washington (who personally visited the academy while president in 1789; eight of his nephews and grandnephews attended Andover), John Hancock (who signed the academy&#x27;s articles of incorporation), and Paul Revere (who designed the academy seal). Revere&#x27;s design of the academy seal incorporated a beehive, crops, the sun, and the academy&#x27;s two mottos: &quot;Non Sibi&quot; (&quot;not for oneself&quot;) and &quot;Finis Origine Pendet&quot; (&quot;the end depends upon the beginning&quot;). Other mottos include &quot;Youth from Every Quarter&quot; and &quot;Knowledge and Goodness&quot;, two paraphrases from the academy constitution.

In 1828, all-boys Phillips Academy was joined by a sister school, Abbot Academy. Abbot was one of the first secondary schools for girls in New England. Although the academies had neighboring campuses in the town of Andover, their administrations sought to limit and regulate contact between the student bodies. The two academies merged in 1973.

=== Calvinist roots and Exeter rivalry ===

Phillips Academy&#x27;s traditional rival is Phillips Exeter Academy, which was established three years later in Exeter, New Hampshire, by Samuel Phillips&#x27; uncle John Phillips. Andover and Exeter&#x27;s sports teams have played each other since 1861, and the football teams have met nearly every year since 1878, making Andover-Exeter one of the nation&#x27;s oldest high school football rivalries.

From 1808 to 1907, Phillips Academy shared its campus with the Andover Theological Seminary, which was founded by orthodox Calvinists who had fled Harvard University after it appointed a liberal Unitarian theology professor. The Phillips family financially backed the seminary, and the two institutions shared a board of directors.

Andover&#x27;s commitment to orthodox theology helped fuel the Exeter rivalry. Exeter was more welcoming to Unitarians or at least less religious; for example, unlike Andover, its academy constitution did not compel Exeter to teach the doctrine of justification by faith alone. As such, Exeter tended to send its students to Unitarian Harvard. Andover steered its students to Yale, which was more hospitable to Calvinists. This was due in part to the conservative influence of the seminary (whose endowment and facilities were superior to the academy&#x27;s), and in other part to the fact that Andover&#x27;s constitution explicitly required Andover to profess and teach Calvinist theology. The constitution also required all teachers and trustees to be Protestants, although Andover no longer enforces this restriction.

Certain New England families were drawn to Andover&#x27;s reputation for theological conservatism. In the 1880s, the bulk of Andover students came from Congregationalist (mainly Calvinist) and Presbyterian households, and the academy enrolled &quot;almost no&quot; Unitarians or Methodists. However, by the 1900s, Calvinism was no longer popular in New England, and Andover Theological Seminary was facing declining enrollment. In 1907, the seminary reconciled with Harvard and returned to Cambridge.

Today, Andover and Exeter are now both nonsectarian institutions, and the rivalry no longer carries religious overtones.

=== Revival as college-preparatory institution ===

After a period of decline, Cecil Bancroft (h. 1873–1901), Alfred Stearns (h. 1903–33), and Claude Fuess (h. 1933–48) led Andover through a long era of expansion that transformed Andover into one of the largest and richest prep schools in the United States. Bancroft improved Andover&#x27;s academic reputation; he reformed the curriculum to the expectations of college presidents and visited the English public schools to learn about best practices in Europe. Aided by a &quot;sink-or-swim&quot; policy of expelling underperforming or undisciplined students, the academy was able to place a majority of its students at Yale, Harvard, or Princeton (64% in 1931 and 74% in 1937). Enrollment, which had fallen from 396 students in 1855 to 177 in 1877, rebounded to roughly 400 by 1901 and passed 700 in 1937.

To compete with newer, fully residential boarding schools, the headmasters built new on-campus housing and modernized the academic facilities, a process that took over a generation to complete. Shortly after taking over, Bancroft recognized that Andover&#x27;s historical reliance on local families for student housing was hurting its reputation. By 1901 Andover provided housing for approximately one-third of boarders; by 1929 all boarders could finally live on campus. Much of this expansion was funded by banker Thomas Cochran &#x27;90, a partner at J. P. Morgan who had no children and wanted to make Andover &quot;the most beautiful school in America.&quot; Cochran donated roughly $10 million to Andover (approximately $181 million in February 2024 dollars); for reference, when he died his estate was probated at $3 million. In 1928, as many as 15,000 people visited Andover&#x27;s campus to hear President Calvin Coolidge deliver the keynote address at Andover&#x27;s 150th anniversary celebration, a speech that Cochran had arranged.

During this period, Andover was a primarily white and Protestant institution, although its expanding scholarship program and occasional steps toward racial integration made it relatively diverse by New England boarding school standards. The share of scholarship boys steadily increased from 10% in 1901 to roughly 25% in 1944. Andover was one of the first New England boarding schools to accept black students, starting in the 1850s. However, it had just five black students when Bancroft died in 1901, and black representation actually declined under Bancroft&#x27;s successors: only four African-Americans attended Andover between 1911 and 1934. The academy admitted more Jewish students but capped their numbers at roughly 5% of the student body. Andover was also one of the first American schools to educate Chinese students, participating in the 1872–1881 Chinese Educational Mission; one student, Liang Cheng, later became the Chinese ambassador to the United States.

In the 1930s, Andover participated in the International Schoolboy Fellowship, a cultural exchange program between U.S. boarding schools, British public schools, and Nazi boarding schools. As U.S.-Germany relations deteriorated, Andover terminated the arrangement in 1939 at the State Department&#x27;s request. Following America&#x27;s entry into World War II, over 3,000 Andover graduates participated in the war effort in some capacity, with 142 deaths.

=== Post-war to present ===
John Kemper (h. 1948–71) updated the curriculum and improved salaries and benefits for faculty members. Under his leadership, Andover co-authored a study on high school students&#x27; preparation for college coursework, which led to the creation of the Advanced Placement program. Although tightening academic standards at elite universities and increased competition from public schools caused Andover&#x27;s college placement record to decline significantly during Kemper&#x27;s administration—the proportion of graduates attending Yale, Harvard, or Princeton fell to 55% in 1953 and 33% in 1967—nearly every major boarding school endured similar declines during this period.

Like many other boarding school administrators, Kemper and his successors also sought to democratize the campus. Andover began to admit more black students in the 1950s and 1960s, but progress was slow; by 1978, 6% of the student body was black or Hispanic. Andover abolished secret societies in 1949, although one society still exists. It also abolished mandatory attendance at religious services in the early 1970s. Phillips Academy became co-educational in 1973, when it merged with its sister school Abbot Academy. 

During this period, Andover also began coordinating policy with other large and wealthy secondary schools. In 1952, the Ten Schools Admission Organization began coordinating outreach to potential applicants and streamlining the admissions process. After Kemper&#x27;s retirement, Andover became a founding member of the Eight Schools Association, an informal group of headmasters of large boarding schools that began meeting in the 1970s and formalized in 2006.

Raynard S. Kington has been Head of School since 2019. He was previously the president of Grinnell College in Iowa. The previous Head of School was law professor (and 1990 Exeter graduate) John Palfrey, who left Andover to take over the MacArthur Foundation. The academy is supervised by a board of trustees, all of whom are alumni except the Head of School. It is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.

== Admissions and student body ==

=== Admission policies ===
Phillips Academy is one of the most selective boarding schools in the United States, especially in light of its size. In 2016, four boarding schools had an acceptance rate lower than 15%, and Andover was larger than the other three put together. The acceptance rate normally hovers around 13%, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, it fell to 9% in 2022.

Andover has practiced need-blind admission since 2007. It also offers financial aid that covers 100% of demonstrated financial need for every admitted student. To recruit U.S. students from &quot;historically underrepresented&quot; backgrounds, Andover pays for certain prospective financial aid applicants and their guardians to visit the campus during the admissions process.

About one of every eight Andover students (12.9%) has a parent who attended Andover, and at least one out of every five Andover students has a sibling who attended Andover.

=== Student body ===

Andover enrolls a student body that is more racially diverse than Massachusetts, although the numbers vary significantly depending on whether respondents are permitted to identify as two or more races. The academy reports that 59% of students identify as people of color. 

For the 2021–2022 school year, Andover reported that 36.5% of its students were white, 33.0% were Asian, 10.2% were black, 10.5% were Hispanic, 0.5% were Native American/Alaska Native, and 9.3% were multiracial. The survey in question did not allow Andover to identify one student in multiple categories. 

By contrast, a March 2023 survey conducted by Andover&#x27;s student newspaper (to which 81.0% of the student body responded) found that 50.2% of Andover students identified as white, 42.9% as Asian (including 25.8% as Asian Americans), 13.4% as black (including 8.6% as African American), 10.9% as Hispanic or Latino, 1.4% as Native American/Alaska Native, and 1.3% as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. This survey allowed students to identify with multiple categories. The percentage of black students represents a significant increase from 2021, when 10.4% of students identified as black and 6.8% as African American. 

Andover enrolls a large international student population, representing approximately 15% of the student body. In March 2024, Andover enrolled 184 international students, of whom 55 were U.S. citizens living abroad. Conversely, a quarter of the student body lives off campus in neighboring communities.

The student body is relatively affluent and politically liberal. As of March 2023, 95.4% of Andover students have at least one parent who graduated from college, and 46.8% of students have family household incomes over $250,000/year, compared to the 11.3% of students with family household incomes under $100,000/year (another 22.9% do not know their family income). 38.8% of students identified as liberal, 13.3% as independent, 8.6% as conservative, and 8.0% as either communist or socialist (another 26.5% were unsure as to their political affiliation). 21.6% of students identified as agnostic and 21.1% as atheist, compared to 22.5% who identified as &quot;Christian,&quot; 16.9% as Catholic, and 5.4% as Protestant (students could select multiple choices). In addition, 6.4% of students identified as ethnically Jewish and 5.3% as religiously Jewish.

==Academics==

=== Curriculum ===

Phillips Academy follows a trimester program, where a school year is divided into three terms lasting around ten weeks each. With 232 teaching faculty, a 7:1 student-faculty ratio, and an average class size of 13, Andover is able to offer 300 courses and a faculty-guided independent research option. Courses may last one, two, or three terms. Although Andover helped create the Advanced Placement program, the academy de-emphasized AP classes in the 21st century, citing a desire to maintain curricular flexibility and independence.

Andover does not rank students. It calculates GPA using a 6.0 scale instead of the usual 4.0 scale, where a 6 is considered outstanding, a 5 is an honors grade, and a 2 is a passing grade. A March 2023 student survey found that the average GPA was 5.41; it was 5.18 in 2018.

Andover also runs a five-week summer session for approximately 600 students entering grades 8-12, which dates back to 1942.

=== Test scores ===
Andover does not publicly report its students&#x27; standardized test scores, explaining that many colleges adopted test-optional admission policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Class of 2019&#x27;s average combined SAT score was 1460 (720 reading, 740 math), and its average combined ACT score was 31.1.

=== Grade levels ===
In the 2022–23 school year, Andover enrolled 214 freshmen (in academy jargon, &quot;juniors&quot;), 276 sophomores (&quot;lowers&quot;), 311 juniors (&quot;uppers&quot;), and 348 seniors and postgraduates (&quot;seniors&quot; and &quot;PGs&quot;), for a total enrollment of 1,149 students.

==Facilities==
The old core of Phillips Academy&#x27;s campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Academy Hill Historic District. It includes the historic campuses of Phillips Academy, Abbot Academy, and Andover Theological Seminary, the latter of which sold its buildings to Phillips Academy when it left Andover in 1907.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Andover added new buildings around this campus core, including the administrative building, library, dining hall, art gallery, chapel, math building, and dormitories. Many of the buildings were named after notable Americans, some (but not all) of whom attended Andover.

Portions of Andover&#x27;s campus were laid out by Andover alumnus Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of Central Park. Beginning in 1891, Olmsted and his architectural firm advised Andover on campus design; this relationship would continue for the next five decades.

===Notable academic facilities===
* George Washington Hall hosts the school&#x27;s administrative offices and the Drama and Art Departments. It also hosts the school post office, locker rooms, and Day Student Lounge. It was built in 1926.
* Bulfinch Hall hosts the English Department. It was built in 1819 and renovated in 2012. It was named after architect Charles Bulfinch, who taught the hall&#x27;s architect Asher Benjamin.
* Pearson Hall hosts the Classics Department. It was built in 1817. It was formerly the chapel of Andover Theological Seminary.
* Morse Hall hosts the Math Department, the student radio station, some student publications, and the Community and Multicultural Development department. It was built in the 1920s/1930s. It was named after Samuel Morse &#x27;05, who invented the telegraph and Morse code. 
* Gelb Science Center hosts the Science Department and an observatory. It was built in 2004. It was named after donor Richard L. Gelb &#x27;41, the heir to the Clairol hair care company.
* Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL) houses over 80,000 books and contains classroom space. It was built in 1929 and renovated in 1987 and 2019. It is named after Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. &#x27;25, the poet and physician. Built in the Georgian Revival architectural style, it has been modernized over the years and now contains a silent study room and a makerspace.

===Student facilities===

* Cochran Chapel hosts religious services and the philosophy, religious studies, and community service departments. It is the only building on campus named for the Cochran family, who built much of the modern-day Andover campus.
* Paresky Commons is the dining hall. Designed by Charles Platt in the Colonial Revival style, it opened in 1930 and was extensively renovated in 2007, after which it was renamed in honor of donor David Paresky &#x27;56. Commons earned LEED Silver certification in 2011. Since its opening, the individual grade levels have generally occupied their own sections of the dining hall.
* Cochran Wildlife Sanctuary covers 65 acres and contains the Log Cabin, a place for student groups to hold meetings and sleep-overs.
* Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center offers physical and mental health facilities.
* Andover has two athletic centers: the 98,000-square-foot Snyder Center and the 70,000-square-foot Pan Athletic Center.

The academy&#x27;s dormitories vary in size from as few as four to as many as 40 students, and are organized into five &quot;clusters&quot; of roughly 220 students and 40 faculty affiliates each. Many social events are organized through the cluster system, including orientation, study breaks, and snacks. None of the original dormitory buildings remain; the oldest dorm is Blanchard House, built in 1789.

Two dormitory names carry on the Andover Theological Seminary tradition: America House, where the song &quot;America&quot; was penned by a seminarian, and Stowe House, the former residence of writer Harriet Beecher Stowe. Stowe&#x27;s husband Calvin taught at the seminary from 1852 to 1864, and Stowe used her first royalty check from &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; to renovate the building. The house was moved to its current location on Bartlet Street in 1929.

The academy also operates the Andover Inn, which has 30 guest rooms and various event spaces. Designed by Sidney Wagner, the three-story Georgian style building overlooks a pond. It was built in 1930 and was most recently renovated in 2023. It replaced another inn that had been operating on the same site since 1888.

==Museums==
The Addison Gallery of American Art is an art museum donated by Thomas Cochran in memory of Keturah Addison Cobb, the mother of his friend Zaidee Cobb Bliss. It is open to the public, and underwent a $30 million renovation and expansion from 2008 to 2010.

The gallery&#x27;s permanent collection includes Winslow Homer&#x27;s &quot;Eight Bells&quot;, along with work by John Singleton Copley, Benjamin West, Thomas Eakins, James McNeill Whistler, Frederic Remington, George Bellows, Edward Hopper, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Jackson Pollock, Frank Stella, and Andrew Wyeth. The museum also features collections in American photography and decorative arts, with silver and furniture dating back to precolonial America and a collection of colonial model ships. The gallery also features rotating exhibitions.

The Robert S. Peabody Institute of Archaeology was founded in 1901. The academy bills it as &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s major repositories of Native American archaeological collections.&quot; Unlike the Addison Gallery, the Peabody Institute is accessible to researchers, public schools, and visitors only by appointment.

The collection includes materials from the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, Mexico and the Arctic, and range from Paleo Indian (more than 10,000 years ago) to the present day. Since the early 1990s, the museum has been at the forefront of compliance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.

== Extracurriculars ==
Phillips Academy&#x27;s extracurricular activities include music ensembles, a campus newspaper, an Internet radio station (formerly broadcasting as WPAA), and a debate club. 

Andover&#x27;s weekly student newspaper, &quot;The Phillipian&quot;, claims to have been publishing since 1857. If true, it would be the nation&#x27;s oldest secondary school newspaper, ahead of Exeter&#x27;s &quot;The Exonian&quot;. However, the official school history questioned the 1857 date, noting that no further issues were published until 1878, the same year &quot;The Exonian&quot; began publishing. According to the &quot;Phillipian&quot; website, the newspaper is &quot;entirely uncensored and student run.&quot;

The Philomathean Society is the nation&#x27;s second-oldest high school debating society, after Exeter&#x27;s Daniel Webster Debate Society.

Andover students operate the Phillips Academy Poll, the first public opinion poll to be conducted by high school students. In 2022, the poll was featured by Boston Channel 7 News and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, among others, after releasing polling results for the 2022 midterm elections. The original pollsters graduated in 2023, and the current status of the poll is unknown.

==Athletics==

===History===
Athletic competition has long been a part of the Phillips Academy tradition. As early as 1805, some form of &quot;football&quot; was being played on campus; that year, Eliphalet Pearson&#x27;s son Henry wrote that &quot;I cannot write a long letter as I am very tired after having played at football all this afternoon.&quot; (The first game of what is now known as American football was played in 1869, and resembled association football more than gridiron football.) Andover participated in the first-ever high school football game, playing Adams Academy in 1875. The school organized an athletics department in 1903 with the objective of &quot;Athletics for All.&quot;Today, Andover is an athletic powerhouse among New England private schools. Andover athletes have won over 110 New England championships in the last three decades. Some teams have even competed internationally; for example, the boys&#x27; crew has competed at England&#x27;s Henley Royal Regatta.

Andover is not part of any formal athletic conference, but through its membership of the Eight Schools Association, it participates in certain ESA-specific athletic contests. In postseason play, Andover&#x27;s teams compete in playoffs organized by the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council.

===Sports===
Andover offers 29 interscholastic programs and 44 intramural or instructional programs, including fencing, tai chi, figure skating, and yoga.

== Finances ==

=== Endowment and expenses ===
As of September 2024, Phillips Academy&#x27;s financial endowment was $1.41 billion. In its Internal Revenue Service filings for the 2021–22 school year, the academy reported $110.2 million in program service expenses and $22.9 million in grants (primarily student financial aid).

The academy conducted a &quot;record-setting&quot; fundraising campaign from 2017 to 2023, raising $408.9 million. The campaign added over $103 million to the academy&#x27;s financial aid endowment and raised $121 million to upgrade health, dormitory, library, music, and athletic facilities.

=== Tuition and financial aid ===
In the 2024–25 school year, Phillips Academy charged boarding students $73,780 and day students $57,190, of which financial aid covers approximately $58,000 for boarding students. The academy has a need-blind admission policy, and 47% of students receive financial aid. The academy also commits to meet 100% of each admitted student&#x27;s demonstrated financial need, as determined by the academy&#x27;s financial aid department.

In the twenty-first century, tuition charges at Phillips Academy have significantly increased. In the 2018–19 academic year, Phillips Academy charged boarding students $55,800 and day students $43,300, placing it among the most expensive boarding schools in the world.

==Controversies==
In 2013, Phillips Academy drew national attention for apparent bias against girls and women, as highlighted by a low number of girls in student leadership.

Reports in 2016 and 2017 identified several former teachers who had engaged in inappropriate sexual contact with students in the past. The academy hired an independent law firm to investigate allegations of misconduct, and the head of school, John Palfrey, and the head of the Board of Trustees, Peter Currie, sent an email to the Andover community stating that such transgressions must not recur.

In 2020, an Instagram account, @blackatandover, began circulating stories from anonymous current and former Black-identifying students, many of whom detailed personal experiences with racism at Phillips Academy. Several individuals raised concerns about Phillips Academy&#x27;s disciplinary system, including perceived racial disparities in outcomes, a perceived emphasis on punishment over restorative justice, and an apparent lack of due process in discipline procedure outlined by the student handbook. The @blackatandover account was reported on by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, prompting academy officials to form an &quot;Anti-Racism Task Force,&quot; which released a final report in March 2022.

==Notable alumni==
Andover has educated two U.S. presidents (George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush), a Supreme Court justice (William Henry Moody), six Medal of Honor recipients (Civil War: 2; Spanish–American War: 1; World War II: 2; Korean War: 1), five Nobel laureates (making it one of only four secondary schools in the world to have educated five or more Nobel Prize winners), as well as winners of Tony, Grammy, Emmy and Academy Awards. It has educated numerous billionaires, including venture capitalist Tim Draper; private equity pioneer Ted Forstmann; oil heir and environmental philanthropist Ed Bass; Rahim Al-Hussaini Aga Khan V, 50th Imam of the Ismaili Muslims, and media heir Lachlan Murdoch.

==In popular culture==
Andover, often in combination with Exeter, is understood symbolically as an &quot;elite New England prep school&quot;, connoting privilege. Writer William S. Dietrich II described Andover and other elite prep schools as being part of a &quot;WASP ascendancy&quot; during the first half of the twentieth century. Elite universities such as Yale and Princeton tended to accept disproportionate percentages of prep school students while using quotas to deny admission to minority applicants. An account in &quot;Time&quot; in 1931 described the two academies as having &quot;flourished&quot;, and that both were &quot;twin giants of prep schools in size and in prestige&quot;. Joe Lieberman called them feeder schools for Ivy League universities such as Harvard and Yale. A cultural image from the 1960s was young men who had &quot;perfect white teeth&quot; and wore Lacoste shirts, with a look easy to identify by young women at the time:

The WASP ascendancy began to break down around the 1960s and onwards when the admissions policies of elite prep schools and universities began to emphasize merit rather than affluence. Still, images of exclusivity based on unfairness tended to remain. Gore Vidal suggested that Andover and Exeter had a &quot;style that was quite witty.&quot; If the WASP ascendancy has waned, the image of unaffordability continues to persist, with one writer deploring how the schools cost $30,000 and more annually.

Despite some shifts, the school&#x27;s image continues to connote exclusivity, prestige, and academic quality. For example, Florida governor Ron DeSantis regularly criticized Andover, Exeter, and Groton in his stump speech during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

The academy is often mentioned in books and film, and on television. Some examples include:
* Chapter 17 of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, in which Sally Hayes introduces Holden to a boy who attended Andover.
* John Guare&#x27;s play &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; has one character who laments that his parents could not afford to send him to Andover or Exeter.
* F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; has several characters who attended Andover.

<text>Viscount (27 October 1858 – 26 February 1936) was a Japanese naval officer and politician. Upon distinguishing himself during his command of two cruisers in the First Sino-Japanese War, Saitō rose rapidly to the rank of rear admiral by 1900. He was promoted to vice admiral during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. After serving as Minister of the Navy from 1906 to 1914, Saitō held the position of Governor-General of Korea from 1919 to 1927 and again from 1929 to 1931. When Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated in May 1932, he took his place as prime minister and served one term in office. Saitō returned to public service as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal in February 1935 but was assassinated only a year later during the February 26 Incident. Saitō along with Takahashi Korekiyo were the last former prime ministers of Japan to be assassinated until 2022, with the assassination of Shinzo Abe.

==Early life==

Saitō was born in Mizusawa Domain, Mutsu Province (part of present-day Ōshū City Iwate Prefecture), as the son of a &quot;samurai&quot; of the Mizusawa Clan. In 1879, he graduated from the 6th class Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, ranking third out of a class of 17 cadets. He was commissioned an ensign on September 8, 1882, and promoted to sub-lieutenant on February 25, 1884.

==Military career==

In 1884, Saitō went to the United States for four years to study as a military attaché. Promoted to lieutenant on 14 July 1886; in 1888, after returning to Japan, he served as a member of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff.

After his promotion to lieutenant commander on 20 December 1893, he served as executive officer on the cruiser and battleship .

During the First Sino-Japanese War, Saitō served as captain of the cruisers and . He received rapid promotions to commander on 1 December 1897 and to captain on 27 December. On 10 November 1898, he became Vice Minister of the Navy, and was promoted to rear admiral on 20 May 1900.

==Political career==
Saitō was again Vice Navy Minister at the start of the Russo-Japanese War. He was promoted to vice admiral on June 6, 1904. He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class) in 1906. After the end of the war, he served as Navy Minister for 8 years, from 1906 to 1914, during which time he continually strove for expansion of the navy.

On 21 September 1907, Saitō was ennobled with the title of &quot;danshaku&quot; (baron) under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system. On October 16, 1912, he was promoted to full admiral. However, on 16 April 1914, Saitō was forced to resign from his post as Navy Minister due implications of his involvement in the Siemens scandal, and officially entered the reserves.

In September 1919, Saitō was appointed as the third Japanese Governor-General of Korea. Rising to the post right after the culmination of the Korean independence movement, he was subject to an immediate assassination attempt by Kang Woo-kyu, a radical Korean nationalist. He served as governor-general of Korea twice—in 1919–1927, and again in 1929–1931, implementing a series of measures to moderate Japan&#x27;s policies on Koreans. He was awarded the Order of the Paulownia Flowers in 1924. On 29 April 1925, his title was elevated to that of &quot;shishaku&quot; (viscount).

In 1927, Saitō was a member of the Japanese delegation at the Geneva Naval Conference on Disarmament, and he later became a privy councillor.

==Prime minister==
Following the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi on 15 May 1932 by fanatical navy officers who thought Inukai far too conciliatory (the May 15 Incident), Prince Saionji Kinmochi, one of the Emperor&#x27;s closest and strongest advisors, attempted to stop the slide towards a military take-over of the government. In a compromise move, Saitō was chosen to be Inukai&#x27;s successor. Sadao Araki remained as War Minister and immediately began making demands on the new government. During Saitō&#x27;s tenure, Japan recognized the independence of Manchukuo, and withdrew from the League of Nations.

Saitō&#x27;s administration was one of the longer-serving ones of the inter-war period, and it continued until 8 July 1934, when the cabinet resigned en masse because of the Teijin Incident bribery scandal. Keisuke Okada succeeded as prime minister.

Saitō continued to be an important figure in politics as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal from 26 December 1935, but was assassinated during the February 26 Incident of 1936 at his home in Yotsuya, Tokyo. Takahashi, his predecessor, was shot dead the same day, along with several other top-rank politicians targeted by the rebels.

Saitō was posthumously awarded the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum.

<text>was a Japanese admiral and statesman who served as Prime Minister of Japan from 1934 to 1936.

Born to a samurai family in the Fukui Domain, Okada became an officer in the Imperial Japanese Navy and served during the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. After reaching the rank of Admiral, he served as minister of the navy under Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka from 1927 to 1929 and under Prime Minister Makoto Saito from 1932 to 1933. 

Okada was appointed prime minister to succeed Saito in 1934. A moderate who attempted to restrain the rise of militarism, Okada was among those targeted by a group of rebel officers in the February 26 incident of 1936. Okada narrowly survived, but resigned in the aftermath of the incident. 

As a senior statesman during the Pacific War, Okada was a central figure in efforts to oust Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and seek peace with the allies.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Okada was born on 20 January 1868, in Fukui Prefecture, the son of a samurai of the Fukui Domain. He attended the 15th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, graduating 7th out of a class of 80 cadets in 1889. He served as a midshipman on the ironclad warship &quot;Kongō&quot; and the cruiser . He was commissioned an ensign on 9 July 1890. He later served as lieutenant on the and as well as the corvette &quot;Hiei&quot;.

In the First Sino-Japanese War, Okada served on the . After his graduation from the Naval Staff College, he subsequently served on the and as executive officer on the . He was promoted to lieutenant on 9 December 1894, to lieutenant commander on 29 September 1899 and to commander on 13 July 1904.

During the Russo-Japanese War, Okada served as executive officer on a successor of vessels, including the , and &quot;Asahi&quot;. He was promoted to captain on 25 September 1908 and given his own command, the &quot;Kasuga&quot; on 25 July 1910. He later transferred to the in 1912.

Promoted to rear admiral on 1 December 1913, Okada served in a number of desk jobs thereafter, including that of the Naval Shipbuilding Command. He was promoted to vice admiral on 1 December 1917 and to full admiral on 11 June 1924.

Okada assumed the post of commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet in 1924. In 1927, he became Minister of Navy in the administration of Tanaka Giichi, but resigned in 1929 to assume the post of military councillor on the Supreme War Council.

Okada was one of the few supporters (Treaty Faction) within the upper ranks of the Imperial Japanese Navy of the arms reduction treaty resulting from the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which he helped negotiate and worked hard for its ratification. He again served as Navy Minister in the Saitō Makoto cabinet of 1932.

Okada entered the reserves on 21 January 1933 and retired five years later.

===Political career===
In July 1934, Okada was named Prime Minister of Japan holding simultaneously the portfolio of Minister of Colonial Affairs. In the month of September 1935, he also briefly held the portfolio of Minister of Post and Telecommunications. Okada was one of the democratic and moderate voices against the increasing strength of the militarists, and was therefore a major target for extremist forces pushing for a more totalitarian Japan. He narrowly escaped assassination in the February 26 Incident of 1936, largely because rebel troops killed Colonel Denzō Matsuo, brother-in-law as well as personal secretary of Okada&#x27;s, by misidentifying him as the prime minister. Okada emerged from hiding on 29 February 1936. However, he left office a few days later.

Okada was adamant in his opposition to the war with the United States. During World War II, Okada formed a group of like-minded politicians and military officers seeking an early end to the hostilities. After the defeat of Japanese forces at the Battle of Midway and Battle of Guadalcanal, Okada pushed for negotiations with the Allies, and played a leading role in the overthrow of the Hideki Tōjō cabinet in 1944.

Okada died in 1952, and his grave is at the Tama Reien Cemetery, in Fuchū, Tokyo.

<doc id="174148" wikidata="Q3689418" url="?curid=174148" title="Conventicle Act 1664">
<text>The Conventicle Act 1664 was an Act of the Parliament of England (16 Cha. 2. c. 4) that forbade conventicles, defined as religious assemblies of more than five people other than an immediate family, outside the auspices of the Church of England and the rubrics of the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;.

This law was a part of the Clarendon Code, named after Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, which aimed to discourage nonconformism and to strengthen the position of the Established Church but the Clarendon Code was not actually the work of Clarendon himself, who favoured a policy of greater tolerance towards dissenters. These prohibitions led many, such as the Covenanters, to vacate their parishes rather than submit to the new Episcopal authorities. Just as the ministers left so too did the congregations, following their old pastors to sermons on the hillside. From small beginnings these field assemblies—or conventicles—were to grow into major problems of public order for the government.

The operation of the Clarendon Code at least as far as Protestants were concerned was mitigated somewhat by Charles II&#x27;s Royal Declaration of Indulgence in 1672, which suspended the execution of the Penal Laws and allowed a certain number of non-conformist chapels to be staffed and constructed, with the pastors subject to royal approval.

The Conventicle Act was formally repealed in 1689, although its authority had lapsed, by default, in 1667.

==Provisions==
Firstly, the Act confirmed that the Religion Act 1592 was still in force.

Secondly, it declared that if any person aged sixteen or over after the 1 July 1664 is present at any religious meeting other than of the Church of England where there are five persons or more assembled together (other than those of the same household), then they would be tried by two justices of the peace or one chief magistrate, without a jury. 

If found guilty, the penalties were as follows:
*first offence: imprisonment for up to three months without bail, or a five pounds fine (to be paid to the poor of the convicted person&#x27;s parish).
*second offence: imprisonment for up to six months without bail, or a ten pounds fine (to be disposed of as above).
*third offence: transportation for seven years, or a one hundred pounds fine.

Subsequent sections of the Act allowed for the breaking up of such meetings, if a warrant had been issued, and the arresting of the convenor of the meeting, and the owner of the venue, who were subject to the same penalties as above, if found guilty. There were penalties for officials not carrying out court orders. The prosecution had to occur within three months of the act, and no other prosecution could be brought for the offence. A special clause applied to Quakers who refused to swear an oath in court without due reason. They were immediately declared guilty and sentenced to transportation. Minor variations in procedure and penalties were also made for peers of the realm. The Act was to remain in force for three years.

==Jewish reaction==
Although aimed at Nonconformists, when the Conventicle Act was passed, the Jews, led by their new rabbi Jacob Sasportas, took their anxieties to Charles II, who told them, &quot;laughing and spitting&quot;, not to worry; later the Privy Council put it in writing that Jews could &quot;promise themselves the effects of the same favour as formerly they have had, so long as they demean themselves peaceably and quietly, with due obedience to His Majesty&#x27;s laws and without scandal to his government&quot;. Thus the English Jews, by an act of omission, as it were, became subjects, under no more disabilities than those inherent in their own unwillingness, like Catholics and Nonconformists, to belong to the Church of England or, in their particular case, to swear Christian oaths.

<doc id="174149" wikidata="Q351652" url="?curid=174149" title="Kōki Hirota">
<text>was a Japanese diplomat and politician who served as prime minister of Japan from 1936 to 1937. Originally his name was . He was executed for war crimes committed during the Second Sino-Japanese War at the Tokyo Trials.

==Early life==

Hirota was born on 14 February 1878, in in what is now part of Chūō-ku, Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, to stonemason Hirota Tokubei (廣田 徳平). His father had been adopted into the Hirota family of stonemasons.

Tokubei married Take (タケ), a daughter of the president of a Japanese noodle company. On 14 February 1878, the couple had a son, whom Tokubei named . They later had three more children. Tokubei&#x27;s name is engraved on the epigraph that recognized masons who contributed to the construction of a statue of Emperor Kameyama in Higashi kōen (東公園) in Fukuoka city.

Hirota&#x27;s writing was recognized as good from a young age since the name plate of the torii gate of Suikyo Shrine was written by Hirota when he was 11.
After attending Shuyukan, he continued his education at Tokyo Imperial University and graduated with a law degree. One of his classmates was the postwar Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida.

==First diplomatic career==
After graduation, Hirota entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to become a career diplomat, and he served in a number of overseas posts. In 1923, he became director of the Europe and America Department of the Foreign Ministry. After he was minister to the Netherlands, he was ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1928 to 1932.

In 1933, Hirota became Foreign Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Saitō Makoto, just after Japan had withdrawn from the League of Nations. He retained the position in the subsequent cabinet of Admiral Keisuke Okada.

As Foreign Minister, Hirota negotiated the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchuria from Soviet interests. He also promulgated the &quot;Hirota Sangensoku&quot; (the Three Principles by Hirota) on 28 October 1935 as the definitive statement of Japan&#x27;s position towards China. The three principles were the establishment of a Japan–China–Manchukuo bloc, the organization of a Sino-Japanese common front against the spread of communism, and the suppression of anti-Japanese activities within China. Hirota argued that warlordism and Chinese Communism represented a &quot;festering sore deep down in the bosom of Eastern Asia&quot; that threatened &quot;all Asian races with sure and inescapable death&quot; and considered further military engagement in China to be &quot;heroic surgery,&quot; rather than invasion.

==Prime minister==

In 1936, with the radical factions within the Japanese military discredited after the 26 February incident, Hirota was selected to replace Okada as Prime Minister of Japan. Hirota placated the military by reinstating the system by which only active-duty Army or Navy officers (see ) could serve in the Cabinet posts of war minister or navy minister. The military, via the institution of the Imperial General Headquarters, had abused the system in the past to bring down civilian governments.

In terms of foreign policy, the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy was signed during his premiership. The treaty was the predecessor to the Tripartite Pact of 1940.

Hirota&#x27;s term lasted for slightly less than a year. He resigned after a disagreement with Hisaichi Terauchi, who was serving as the war minister, over a speech by the Rikken Seiyūkai representative Kunimatsu Hamada criticizing military interference in politics. Kazushige Ugaki was appointed as his successor but was unable to form the government because of army opposition. In February 1937, Senjūrō Hayashi was appointed to replace Hirota as prime minister.

==Second diplomatic career==
Hirota soon returned to government service as foreign minister under Hayashi&#x27;s successor, Prince Konoe Fumimaro. During his second term as foreign minister, Hirota strongly opposed the military&#x27;s aggression against China, which completely undermined his efforts to create a Japan-China-Manchukuo alliance against the Soviet Union. He also spoke out repeatedly against the escalation of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The military soon tired of his criticism and forced his retirement in 1938.

In 1945, however, Hirota returned to government service to lead Japanese peace negotiations with the Soviet Union. At the time, Japan and the Soviet Union were still under a non-aggression pact even though all other Allied Powers had declared war on Japan. Hirota attempted to persuade Joseph Stalin&#x27;s government to stay out of the war, but the Soviet Union ultimately declared war on Japan in between the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
==Postwar==
Following Japan&#x27;s surrender, Hirota was arrested as a Class A war criminal and brought before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE). He offered no defense and was found guilty of the following charges:
*Count 1 (waging wars of aggression, and war or wars in violation of international law)
*Count 27 (waging unprovoked war against the Republic of China)
*Count 55 (disregard for duty to prevent breaches of the laws of war)

He was sentenced to death by hanging and was executed at Sugamo Prison. The severity of his sentence remains controversial, as Hirota was the only civilian executed as a result of the IMTFE proceedings.

As foreign minister, Hirota had received regular reports from the War Ministry about the military&#x27;s atrocities, such as the Nanjing Massacre, but lacked any authority over the offending military units themselves. Nonetheless, the tribunal condemned Hirota&#x27;s failure to insist for the Japanese Cabinet act to put an end to the atrocities.

Hirota was a civilian bureaucrat and was popular among the public, which led to a petition for a reduced sentence gathering 29,985 signatures in Japan. Even today, his name is often mentioned when the Tokyo Trials are debated in Japan as a &quot;victor&#x27;s justice&quot; trial. 
Generally, he is often portrayed as a minister who was opposed to the war but unable to resist pressure from the military. He is also the protagonist of the novel and drama &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Setting Sun Burns&quot;).

<text>was a Japanese politician and general. He served as Imperial Japanese Army Commander of the Japanese Korean Army during the Mukden Incident and the invasion of Manchuria. He briefly served as prime minister of Japan in 1937.

==Early life==
Hayashi was born on 23 February 1876, in Kodatsuno, Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, the first son of secretary of Tonami District Office Hayashi Shishirō and his wife Bessho Saha. The family was a samurai-class family formerly in service to Kaga Domain. The second oldest of his brothers Hayashi Ryōzō became an Imperial Army Colonel, and the youngest brother Shirakawa Yūkichi became Vice Mayor of Tokyo.

Hayashi dropped out of school in July 1894 to enlist in the Imperial Japanese Army at the start of the First Sino-Japanese War. After the end of the war, he attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, and on graduation in June 1897 was assigned to the IJA 7th Infantry Regiment. in 1903, he graduated from the Army Staff College. With the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Hayashi participated in the Siege of Port Arthur.

== Military career ==
Hayashi&#x27;s first major command from 1918 to 1920 was as commanding officer of the IJA 57th Infantry Regiment, followed by a time in 1921 attached to the Technical Research Headquarters and as an acting Military Investigator. From 1921 to 1923 he was the head of the Preparatory Course at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, followed by a time attached to the Inspectorate General of Military Training. From 1923 to 1924 he was the Japanese Army Representative to the League of Nations, followed by another stint attached to the Inspectorate General of Military Training from 1924 to 1925.
In 1925, Hayashi became the commanding Officer of the IJA 2nd Infantry Brigade. In 1926 he was made Commandant of the Tokyo Bay Fortress. In 1927, he became the Commandant of the Army War College, followed in 1928 as Deputy Inspector-General of Military Training. Finally in 1929 he became the General Officer Commanding the Imperial Guards Division.

In 1930, Lieutenant-General Senjūrō Hayashi, was made Commander in Chief of the Japanese Korean Army. On the day after the Mukden Incident on 19 September, he ordered the IJA 20th Division to split its force, forming the 39th Mixed Brigade. Acting without authorization by the Emperor or central government in Tokyo, Hayashi ordered the 39th Mixed Brigade to cross the Yalu River that same day into Manchuria. The Cabinet was forced to concede the point to the military afterwards and the movement of the 39th Mixed Brigade from Korea was authorized on 22 September.

Following his command in Korea, Hayashi was made Inspector General of Military Training and a member of the Supreme War Council from 1932 to 1934. In 1932, he was awarded with the Order of the Sacred Treasure (1st class) and in 1934, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class).

== Political career ==

From 1934 to 1935 Hayashi was Army Minister, and again member of the Supreme War Council from 1935 until his retirement the next year.

As Army Minister, Hayashi was a supporter of Major General Tetsuzan Nagata, who was Chief of Military Bureau and the leader of the &quot;Tōseiha&quot; faction within the Imperial Japanese Army. The &quot;Tōseiha&quot; scored a victory in July 1935 when General Jinzaburō Masaki, one of the leaders of the &quot;Kōdōha&quot; faction was removed as Inspector General of Military Training. But Nagata was assassinated the next month (the Aizawa Incident). The struggle between the &quot;Tōseiha&quot; and &quot;Kōdōha&quot; factions continued below the surface of the government; and the war in North China carried on apace until February 1936.

Hayashi also promoted Fumimaro Konoe&#x27;s doctrines, as a &quot;right-winger&quot; amongst the militarists, against &quot;left-winger&quot; radical militarists, led by Kingoro Hashimoto, wanted to establish a Military Shogunate through revolutionary means.

Hayashi also happen to the president of Greater Japan Muslim League (大日本回教協会, Dai Nihon Kaikyō Kyōkai).

Hayashi served as Prime Minister of Japan for a brief four-month period in 1937, where he tried to establish a cabinet that rose above the factional strife of the political parties. He later demanded that members of his cabinet renounce their party ties. Later from 1940 to 1941, he was a Privy Councillor. Hayashi suffered from an intracranial hemorrhage in January 1943 and died at his home of 4 February without regaining consciousness. He was posthumously awarded the Order of the Golden Kite (4th class) and the Order of the Paulownia Flowers.

<text>SATA (Serial AT Attachment) is a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives. Serial ATA succeeded the earlier Parallel ATA (PATA) standard to become the predominant interface for storage devices.

Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO) which are then released by the INCITS Technical Committee T13, AT Attachment (INCITS T13).

== History ==
SATA was announced in 2000 in order to provide several advantages over the earlier PATA interface such as reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40 or 80), native hot swapping, faster data transfer through higher signaling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) I/O queuing protocol. Revision 1.0 of the specification was released in January 2003.

Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO). The SATA-IO group collaboratively creates, reviews, ratifies, and publishes the interoperability specifications, the test cases and plugfests. As with many other industry compatibility standards, the SATA content ownership is transferred to other industry bodies: primarily INCITS T13 and an INCITS T10 subcommittee (SCSI), a subgroup of T10 responsible for Serial Attached SCSI (SAS). The remainder of this article strives to use the SATA-IO terminology and specifications.

Before SATA&#x27;s introduction in 2000, PATA was simply known as ATA. The &quot;AT Attachment&quot; (ATA) name originated after the 1984 release of the IBM Personal Computer AT, more commonly known as the IBM AT. The IBM AT&#x27;s controller interface became a de facto industry interface for the inclusion of hard disks. &quot;AT&quot; was IBM&#x27;s abbreviation for &quot;Advanced Technology&quot;; thus, many companies and organizations indicate SATA is an abbreviation of &quot;Serial Advanced Technology Attachment&quot;. However, the ATA specifications simply use the name &quot;AT Attachment&quot;, to avoid possible trademark issues with IBM.

SATA host adapters and devices communicate via a high-speed serial cable over two pairs of conductors. In contrast, parallel ATA (the redesignation for the legacy ATA specifications) uses a 16-bit wide data bus with many additional support and control signals, all operating at a much lower frequency. To ensure backward compatibility with legacy ATA software and applications, SATA uses the same basic ATA and ATAPI command sets as legacy ATA devices.

The world&#x27;s first SATA hard disk drive is the Seagate Barracuda SATA V, which was released in Jan 2003.

SATA has replaced parallel ATA in consumer desktop and laptop computers; SATA&#x27;s market share in the desktop PC market was 99% in 2008. PATA has mostly been replaced by SATA for any use; with PATA in declining use in industrial and embedded applications that use CompactFlash (CF) storage, which was designed around the legacy PATA standard. A 2008 standard, CFast, to replace CompactFlash is based on SATA.

== Features ==
=== Hot plug ===
The Serial ATA spec requires SATA devices be capable of hot plugging; that is, devices that meet the specification are capable of insertion or removal of a device into or from a backplane connector (combined signal and power) that has power on. After insertion, the device initializes and then operates normally. Depending upon the operating system, the host may also initialize, resulting in a hot swap. The powered host and device do not need to be in an idle state for safe insertion and removal, although unwritten data may be lost when power is removed.

Unlike PATA, both SATA and eSATA support hot plugging by design. However, this feature requires proper support at the host, device (drive), and operating-system levels. In general, SATA devices fulfill the device-side hot-plugging requirements, and most SATA host adapters support this function.

For eSATA, hot plugging is supported in AHCI mode only. IDE mode does not support hot plugging.

=== Advanced Host Controller Interface ===
Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) is an open host controller interface published and used by Intel, which has become a de facto standard. It allows the use of advanced features of SATA such as hotplug and native command queuing (NCQ). If AHCI is not enabled by the motherboard and chipset, SATA controllers typically operate in &quot;IDE emulation&quot; mode, which does not allow access to device features not supported by the ATA (also called IDE) standard.

Windows device drivers that are labeled as SATA are often running in IDE emulation mode unless they explicitly state that they are AHCI mode, in RAID mode, or a mode provided by a proprietary driver and command set that allowed access to SATA&#x27;s advanced features before AHCI became popular. Modern versions of Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Linux with version 2.6.19 onward, as well as Solaris and OpenSolaris, include support for AHCI, but earlier operating systems such as Windows XP do not. Even in those instances, a proprietary driver may have been created for a specific chipset, such as Intel&#x27;s.

== Revisions ==
SATA revisions are typically designated with a dash followed by Roman numerals, e.g. &quot;SATA-III&quot;, to avoid confusion with the speed, which is always displayed in Arabic numerals, e.g. &quot;SATA 6 Gbit/s&quot;. The speeds given are the &quot;raw interface rate&quot; in Gbit/s including line code overhead, and the &quot;usable data rate&quot; in MB/s without overhead.

=== SATA revision 1.0 (1.5 Gbit/s, 150 MB/s, Serial ATA-150) ===
Revision 1.0a was released on January 7, 2003. First-generation SATA interfaces, now known as SATA 1.5 Gbit/s, communicate at a rate of 1.5 Gbit/s, and do not support Native Command Queuing (NCQ). Taking 8b/10b encoding overhead into account, they have an actual uncoded transfer rate of 1.2 Gbit/s (150 MB/s). The theoretical burst throughput of SATA 1.5 Gbit/s is similar to that of PATA/133, but newer SATA devices offer enhancements such as NCQ, which improve performance in a multitasking environment.

During the initial period after SATA 1.5 Gbit/s finalization, adapter and drive manufacturers used a &quot;bridge chip&quot; to convert existing PATA designs for use with the SATA interface. Bridged drives have a SATA connector, may include either or both kinds of power connectors, and, in general, perform identically to their native-SATA equivalents.

, the fastest 10,000 rpm SATA hard disk drives could transfer data at maximum (not average) rates of up to 157 MB/s, which is beyond the capabilities of the older PATA/133 specification and also exceeds the capabilities of SATA 1.5 Gbit/s.

=== SATA revision 2.0 (3 Gbit/s, 300 MB/s, Serial ATA-300) ===

SATA revision 2.0 was released in April 2004, introducing Native Command Queuing (NCQ). It is backward compatible with SATA 1.5 Gbit/s.

Second-generation SATA interfaces run with a native transfer rate of 3.0 Gbit/s that, when accounted for the 8b/10b encoding scheme, equals to the maximum uncoded transfer rate of 2.4 Gbit/s (300 MB/s). The theoretical burst throughput of the SATA revision 2.0, which is also known as the SATA 3 Gbit/s, doubles the throughput of SATA revision 1.0.

All SATA data cables meeting the SATA spec are rated for 3.0 Gbit/s and handle modern mechanical drives without any loss of sustained and burst data transfer performance. However, high-performance flash-based drives can exceed the SATA 3 Gbit/s transfer rate; this is addressed with the SATA 6 Gbit/s interoperability standard.

==== SATA revision 2.5 ====
Announced in August 2005, SATA revision 2.5 consolidated the specification to a single document.

==== SATA revision 2.6 ====
Announced in February 2007, SATA revision 2.6 introduced the following features:
* Slimline connector
* Micro connector (initially for 1.8” HDD)
* Mini Internal Multilane cable and connector
* Mini External Multilane cable and connector
* NCQ Priority
* NCQ Unload
* Enhancements to the BIST Activate FIS
* Enhancements for robust reception of the Signature FIS

=== SATA revision 3.0 (6 Gbit/s, 600 MB/s, Serial ATA-600) ===
Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO) presented the draft specification of SATA 6 Gbit/s physical layer in July 2008, and ratified its physical layer specification on August 18, 2008. The full 3.0 standard was released on May 27, 2009.

Third-generation SATA interfaces run with a native transfer rate of 6.0 Gbit/s; taking 8b/10b encoding into account, the maximum uncoded transfer rate is 4.8 Gbit/s (600 MB/s). The theoretical burst throughput of SATA 6.0 Gbit/s is double that of SATA revision 2.0. It is backward compatible with earlier SATA implementations.

The SATA 3.0 specification contains the following changes:
* 6 Gbit/s for scalable performance.
* Continued compatibility with SAS, including SAS 6 Gbit/s, as per &quot;a SAS domain may support attachment to and control of unmodified SATA devices connected directly into the SAS domain using the Serial ATA Tunneled Protocol (STP)&quot; from the SATA Revision 3.0 Gold specification.
* Isochronous Native Command Queuing (NCQ) streaming command to enable isochronous quality of service data transfers for streaming digital content applications.
* An NCQ management feature that helps optimize performance by enabling host processing and management of outstanding NCQ commands.
* Improved power management capabilities.
* A small low insertion force (LIF) connector for more compact 1.8-inch storage devices.
* A 7 mm optical disk drive profile for the slimline SATA connector (in addition to the existing 12.7 mm and 9.5 mm profiles).
* Alignment with the INCITS ATA8-ACS standard.

In general, the enhancements are aimed at improving quality of service for video streaming and high-priority interrupts. In addition, the standard continues to support distances up to one meter. The newer speeds may require higher power consumption for supporting chips, though improved process technologies and power management techniques may mitigate this. The later specification can use existing SATA cables and connectors, though it was reported in 2008 that some OEMs were expected to upgrade host connectors for the higher speeds.

==== SATA revision 3.1 ====
Released in July 2011, SATA revision 3.1 introduced or changed the following features:
* &quot;mSATA&quot;, for solid-state drives in mobile computing devices, a PCI Express Mini Card-like connector that is electrically SATA. The connector was also used in some desktop computers, such as certain HP business PCs.
* Zero-power optical disk drive, a SATA optical drive that draws no power when idle.
* Queued TRIM Command, improves solid-state drive performance.
* Required Link Power Management, reduces overall system power demand of several SATA devices.
* Hardware Control Features, enable host identification of device capabilities.
* &quot;Universal Storage Module&quot; (USM), a new standard for cableless plug-in (slot) powered storage for consumer electronics devices.

==== SATA revision 3.2 ====
Released in August 2013, SATA revision 3.2 introduced the following features:
* The SATA Express specification defines an interface that combines both SATA and PCI Express buses, making it possible for both types of storage devices to coexist. By employing PCI Express, a much higher theoretical throughput of 1969 MB/s is possible.
* The SATA M.2 standard is a small form factor implementation of the SATA Express interface, with the addition of an internal USB 3.0 port; see the M.2 (NGFF) section below for a more detailed summary.
* &quot;microSSD&quot; introduces a ball grid array electrical interface for miniaturized, embedded SATA storage.
* &quot;USM Slim&quot; reduces thickness of Universal Storage Module (USM) from to .
* DevSleep enables lower power consumption for always-on devices while they are in low-power modes such as InstantGo (which used to be known as Connected Standby).
* &quot;Hybrid Information&quot; provides higher performance for solid-state hybrid drives.

==== SATA revision 3.3 ====
Released in February 2016, SATA revision 3.3 introduced the following features:
* Shingled magnetic recording (SMR) host-control support (device-controlled SMR HDDs are the same as standard CMR HDDs with respect to SATA compatibility). SMR provides a 25 percent or greater increase in hard disk drive capacity by overlapping tracks on the media.
* Optional &quot;Zoned ATA Command Set&quot; (ZAC) feature.
* &quot;Power Disable&quot; feature (see PWDIS pin) allows for remote power cycling of SATA drives and a Rebuild Assist function that speeds up the rebuild process to help ease maintenance in the data center.
* Transmitter Emphasis Specification increases interoperability and reliability between host and devices in electrically demanding environments.
* An activity indicator and staggered spin-up can be controlled by the same pin, adding flexibility and providing users with more choices.

The new Power Disable feature (similar to the SAS Power Disable feature) uses Pin 3 of the SATA power connector. Some legacy power supplies that provide 3.3 V power on Pin 3 would force drives with Power Disable feature to get stuck in a hard reset condition preventing them from spinning up. The problem can usually be eliminated by using a simple “Molex to SATA” power adaptor to supply power to these drives.

==== SATA revision 3.4 ====
Released in June 2018, SATA revision 3.4 introduced the following features that enable monitoring of device conditions and execution of housekeeping tasks, both with minimal impact on performance:
* Durable/Ordered Write Notification: enables writing selected critical cache data to the media, minimizing impact on normal operations.
* Device Temperature Monitoring: allows for active monitoring of SATA device temperature and other conditions without impacting normal operation by utilizing the SFF-8609 standard for out-of-band (OOB) communications.
* Device Sleep Signal Timing: provides additional definition to enhance compatibility between manufacturers’ implementations.

==== SATA revision 3.5 ====
Released in July 2020, SATA revision 3.5 introduces features that enable increased performance benefits and promote greater integration of SATA devices and products with other industry I/O standards:
* Device Transmit Emphasis for Gen 3 PHY: aligns SATA with other characteristics of other I/O measurement solutions to help SATA-IO members with testing and integration.
* Defined Ordered NCQ Commands: allows the host to specify the processing relationships among queued commands and sets the order in which commands are processed in the queue.
* Command Duration Limit Features: reduces latency by allowing the host to define quality of service categories, giving the host more granularity in controlling command properties. The feature helps align SATA with the &quot;Fast Fail&quot; requirements established by the Open Compute Project (OCP) and specified in the INCITS T13 Technical Committee standard.

SATA revision 3.5a was released in March 2021.

== Cables, connectors, and ports ==
Connectors and cables present the most visible differences between SATA and parallel ATA drives. Unlike PATA, the same connectors are used on 3.5-inch SATA hard disks (for desktop and server computers) and 2.5-inch disks (for portable or small computers).

Standard SATA connectors for both data and power have a conductor pitch of . Low insertion force is required to mate a SATA connector. A smaller mini-SATA or mSATA connector is used by smaller devices such as 1.8-inch SATA drives, some DVD and Blu-ray drives, and mini SSDs.

A special eSATA connector is specified for external devices, and an optionally implemented provision for clips to hold internal connectors firmly in place. SATA drives may be plugged into SAS controllers and communicate on the same physical cable as native SAS disks, but SATA controllers cannot handle SAS disks.

Female SATA ports (on motherboards for example) are for use with SATA data cables that have locks or clips to prevent accidental unplugging. Some SATA cables have right- or left-angled connectors to ease connection to circuit boards.
=== Data connector ===


The SATA standard defines a data cable with seven conductors (three grounds and four active data lines in two pairs) and 8 mm wide wafer connectors on each end. SATA cables can have lengths up to , and connect one motherboard socket to one hard drive. PATA ribbon cables, in comparison, connect one motherboard socket to one or two hard drives, carry either 40 or 80 wires, and are limited to in length by the PATA specification; however, cables up to are readily available. Thus, SATA connectors and cables are easier to fit in closed spaces and reduce obstructions to air cooling. Some cables even include a locking feature, whereby a small (usually metal) spring holds the plug in the socket.

SATA connectors may be straight, upward-angled, downward-angled, leftward-angled, or rightward-angled. Angled connectors allow lower-profile connections. Downward-angled connectors lead the cable immediately away from the drive, on the circuit-board side. Upward-angled connectors lead the cable across the drive towards its top.

One of the problems associated with the transmission of data at high speed over electrical connections is described as &quot;noise&quot;, which is due to electrical coupling between data circuits and other circuits. As a result, the data circuits can both affect other circuits and be affected by them. Designers use a number of techniques to reduce the undesirable effects of such unintentional coupling. One such technique used in SATA links is differential signaling. This is an enhancement over PATA, which uses single-ended signaling. The use of fully shielded, dual coax conductors, with multiple ground connections, for each differential pair improves isolation between the channels and reduces the chances of lost data in difficult electrical environments.

=== SATA Power connectors ===

==== Standard power connector (15 pins) ====


SATA specifies a different power connector than the four-pin Molex connector used on Parallel ATA (PATA) devices (and earlier small storage devices, going back to ST-506 hard disk drives and even to floppy disk drives that predated the IBM PC). It is a wafer-type connector, like the SATA data connector, but much wider (fifteen pins versus seven) to avoid confusion between the two. Some early SATA drives included the four-pin Molex power connector together with the new fifteen-pin connector, but most SATA drives now have only the latter.

The new SATA power connector contains many more pins for several reasons:
* 3.3 V is supplied along with the traditional 5 V and 12 V supplies. However, very few drives actually use it.
* Pin 3 in SATA revision 3.3 has been redefined as PWDIS and is used to enter and exit the POWER DISABLE mode in line with SAS-3. If Pin 3 is driven HIGH (2.1–3.6 V max), power to the drive circuitry is cut. Drives with this feature enabled do not power up in systems designed to SATA revision 3.1 or earlier, because Pin 3 driven HIGH prevents the drive from powering up. Workarounds include using a Molex adapter without 3.3 V or putting insulating tape over the PWDIS pin. 
* To reduce resistance and increase current capability, each voltage is supplied by three pins in parallel, though one pin in each group is intended for precharging (see below). Each pin should be able to carry 1.5 A.
* Five parallel pins provide a low-resistance ground connection.
* Two ground pins and one pin for each supplied voltage support hot-plug precharging. Ground pins 4 and 12 in a hot-swap cable are the longest, so they make contact first when the connectors are mated. Drive power connector pins 3, 7, and 13 are longer than the others, so they make contact next. The drive uses them to charge its internal bypass capacitors through current-limiting resistances. Finally, the remaining power pins make contact, bypassing the resistances and providing a low-resistance source of each voltage. This two-step mating process avoids glitches to other loads and possible arcing or erosion of the SATA power-connector contacts. 
* Pin 11 might be used (often by chassis or backplane hardware independent from SATA host controller and its data connection) for staggered spinup, activity indication, emergency head parking, or other vendor defined functions in various combinations. It is an open-collector signal, which may be pulled down by the connector or the drive.
** Host signaling: If pulled down at the connector (as it is on most cable-style SATA power connectors), the drive spins up as soon as power is applied. If left floating, the drive waits until it is spoken to. This prevents many drives from spinning up simultaneously, which might draw too much power.
** Drive signaling: The pin is also pulled low by the drive to indicate drive activity. This may be used to give feedback to the user through an LED. Relevant definitions of pin operation have changed multiple times in published revisions of SATA standard, so the observed behavior may be dependent on device version, host version, firmware and software configuration. There is also a specification for transmission of drive temperature and other status values with activity signal pulses routinely used to make LED blink.

Passive adapters are available that convert a four-pin Molex connector to a SATA power connector, providing the 5 V and 12 V lines available on the Molex connector, but not 3.3 V. There are also four-pin Molex-to-SATA power adapters that include electronics to additionally provide the 3.3 V power supply. However, most drives do not require the 3.3 V power line.

Just like SATA data connectors, SATA power connectors may be straight, upward-angled, or downward-angled. 
==== Slimline power connector (6 pins) ====
The power connector is reduced to six pins so it supplies only +5 V (red wire), and not +12 V or +3.3 V.

Pin 1 of the slimline power connector, denoting device presence, is shorter than the others to allow hot-swapping.

Note: The data connector used is the same as the non-slimline version.

Low-cost adapters exist to convert from standard SATA to slimline SATA.

SATA 2.6 is the first revision that defined the slimline power connector targeted for smaller form-factors drives, such as laptop optical drives.

==== Micro connector ====

The micro SATA connector (sometimes called uSATA or μSATA) originated with SATA 2.6, and is intended for 1.8-inch hard disk drives. There is also a micro data connector, similar in appearance but slightly thinner than the standard data connector.

=== Additional pins ===

Some SATA drives, in particular mechanical ones, come with an extra 4 or more pin interface which isn&#x27;t uniformly standardized but nevertheless serves similar purpose defined by each drive manufacturer. As IDE drives used those extra pins for setting up Master and Slave drives, on SATA drives, those pins are generally used to select different Power modes for use in USB-SATA bridges or enables additional features like Spread Spectrum Clocking, SATA Speed Limit or Factory Mode for Diagnostics and Recovery, by the use of a jumper.

=== eSATA ===


Standardized in 2004, eSATA (&quot;e&quot; standing for external) provides a variant of SATA meant for external connectivity. It uses a more robust connector, longer shielded cables, and stricter (but backward-compatible) electrical standards. The protocol and logical signaling (link/transport layers and above) are identical to internal SATA. The differences are:
* Minimum transmit amplitude increased: Range is 500–600 mV instead of 400–600 mV.
* Minimum receive amplitude decreased: Range is 240–600 mV instead of 325–600 mV.
* Maximum cable length increased to from .
* The eSATA cable and connector is similar to the SATA 1.0a cable and connector, with these exceptions:
** The eSATA connector is mechanically different to prevent unshielded internal cables from being used externally. The eSATA connector discards the L-shaped key and changes the position and size of the guides.
** The eSATA insertion depth is deeper: 6.6 mm instead of 5 mm. The contact positions are also changed.
** The eSATA cable has an extra shield to reduce EMI to FCC and CE requirements. Internal cables do not need the extra shield to satisfy EMI requirements because they are inside a shielded case.
** The eSATA connector uses metal springs for shield contact and mechanical retention.
** The eSATA connector has a design-life of 5,000 matings; the ordinary SATA connector is only specified for 50.

Aimed at the consumer market, eSATA enters an external storage market served also by the USB and FireWire interfaces. The SATA interface has certain advantages. Most external hard-disk-drive cases with FireWire or USB interfaces use either PATA or SATA drives and &quot;bridges&quot; to translate between the drives&#x27; interfaces and the enclosures&#x27; external ports; this bridging incurs some inefficiency. Some single disks can transfer 157 MB/s during real use, about four times the maximum transfer rate of USB 2.0 or FireWire 400 (IEEE 1394a) and almost twice as fast as the maximum transfer rate of FireWire 800. The S3200 FireWire 1394b specification reaches around 400 MB/s (3.2 Gbit/s), and USB 3.0 has a nominal speed of 5 Gbit/s. Some low-level drive features, such as S.M.A.R.T., may not operate through some USB or FireWire or USB+FireWire bridges; eSATA does not suffer from these issues provided that the controller manufacturer (and its drivers) presents eSATA drives as ATA devices, rather than as SCSI devices, as has been common with Silicon Image, JMicron, and Nvidia nForce drivers for Windows Vista. In those cases SATA drives do not have low-level features accessible.

The eSATA version of SATA 6G operates at 6.0 Gbit/s (the term &quot;SATA III&quot; is avoided by the SATA-IO organization to prevent confusion with SATA II 3.0 Gbit/s, which was colloquially referred to as &quot;SATA 3G&quot; [bit/s] or &quot;SATA 300&quot; [MB/s] since the 1.5 Gbit/s SATA I and 1.5 Gbit/s SATA II were referred to as both &quot;SATA 1.5G&quot; [bit/s] or &quot;SATA 150&quot; [MB/s]). Therefore, eSATA connections operate with negligible differences between them. Once an interface can transfer data as fast as a drive can handle them, increasing the interface speed does not improve data transfer.

There are some disadvantages, however, to the eSATA interface:
* Devices built before the eSATA interface became popular lack external SATA connectors. 
* For small form-factor devices (such as external 2.5-inch disks), a PC-hosted USB or FireWire link can usually supply sufficient power to operate the device. However, eSATA connectors cannot supply power, and require a power supply for the external device. The related eSATAp (but mechanically incompatible, sometimes called &quot;eSATA/USB&quot;) connector adds power to an external SATA connection, so that an additional power supply is not needed.

 few new computers have dedicated external SATA (eSATA) connectors, with USB3 dominating and USB3 Type C, often with the Thunderbolt alternate mode, starting to replace the earlier USB connectors. Still sometimes present are single ports supporting both USB3 and eSATA.

Desktop computers without a built-in eSATA interface can install an eSATA host bus adapter (HBA); if the motherboard supports SATA, an externally available eSATA connector can be added. Notebook computers with the now rare Cardbus or ExpressCard could add an eSATA HBA. With passive adapters, the maximum cable length is reduced to due to the absence of compliant eSATA signal-levels.

==== eSATAp ====

eSATAp stands for powered eSATA. It is also known as Power over eSATA, Power eSATA, eSATA/USB Combo, or eSATA USB Hybrid Port (EUHP). An eSATAp port combines the four pins of the USB 2.0 (or earlier) port, the seven pins of the eSATA port, and optionally two 12 V power pins. Both SATA traffic and device power are integrated in a single cable, as is the case with USB but not eSATA. The 5 V power is provided through two USB pins, while the 12 V power may optionally be provided. Typically desktop, but not notebook, computers provide 12 V power, so can power devices requiring this voltage, typically 3.5-inch disk and CD/DVD drives, in addition to 5 V devices such as 2.5-inch drives.

Both USB and eSATA devices can be used with an eSATAp port, when plugged in with a USB or eSATA cable, respectively. An eSATA device cannot be powered via an eSATAp cable, but a special cable can make both SATA or eSATA and power connectors available from an eSATAp port.

An eSATAp connector can be built into a computer with internal SATA and USB, by fitting a bracket with connections for internal SATA, USB, and power connectors and an externally accessible eSATAp port. Though eSATAp connectors have been built into several devices, manufacturers do not refer to an official standard.

==== Pre-standard implementations ====
* Prior to the final eSATA 6 Gbit/s specification many add-on cards and some motherboards advertised eSATA 6 Gbit/s support because they had 6 Gbit/s SATA 3.0 controllers for internal-only solutions. Those implementations are non-standard, and eSATA 6 Gbit/s requirements were ratified in the July 18, 2011 SATA 3.1 specification. Some products might not be fully eSATA 6 Gbit/s compliant.

=== Mini-SATA (mSATA) ===
Mini-SATA (abbreviated as mSATA), which is distinct from the micro connector, was announced by the Serial ATA International Organization on September 21, 2009. Applications include netbooks, laptops and other devices that require a solid-state drive in a small footprint.

The physical dimensions of the mSATA connector are identical to those of the PCI Express Mini Card interface, but the interfaces are electrically incompatible; the data signals (TX±/RX± SATA, PETn0 PETp0 PERn0 PERp0 PCI Express) need a connection to the SATA host controller instead of the PCI Express host controller.

The M.2 specification has superseded both mSATA and mini-PCIe.

=== SFF-8784 connector ===
Slim 2.5-inch SATA devices, in height, use the twenty-pin &quot;SFF-8784&quot; edge connector to save space. By combining the data signals and power lines into a slim connector that effectively enables direct connection to the device&#x27;s printed circuit board (PCB) without additional space-consuming connectors, SFF-8784 allows further internal layout compaction for portable devices such as ultrabooks.

Pins 1 to 10 are on the connector&#x27;s bottom side, while pins 11 to 20 are on the top side.

=== SATA Express ===

SATA Express, initially standardized in the SATA 3.2 specification, is an interface that supports either SATA or PCI Express storage devices. The host connector is backward compatible with the standard 3.5-inch SATA data connector, allowing up to two legacy SATA devices to connect. At the same time, the host connector provides up to two PCI Express 3.0 lanes as a pure PCI Express connection to the storage device, allowing bandwidths of up to 2 GB/s.

Instead of the otherwise usual approach of doubling the native speed of the SATA interface, PCI Express was selected for achieving data transfer speeds greater than 6 Gbit/s. It was concluded that doubling the native SATA speed would take too much time, too many changes would be required to the SATA standard, and would result in a much greater power consumption when compared to the existing PCI Express bus.

In addition to supporting legacy Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI), SATA Express also makes it possible for NVM Express (NVMe) to be used as the logical device interface for connected PCI Express storage devices.

As M.2 form factor, described below, achieved much larger popularity, SATA Express is considered as a failed standard and dedicated ports quickly disappeared from motherboards.

=== M.2 (NGFF) ===


M.2, formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF), is a specification for computer expansion cards and associated connectors. It replaces the mSATA standard, which uses the PCI Express Mini Card physical layout. Having a smaller and more flexible physical specification, together with more advanced features, the M.2 is more suitable for solid-state storage applications in general, especially when used in small devices such as ultrabooks or tablets. 

A M.2 SSD is &quot;keyed&quot; to prevent insertion of a card connector (male) to an incompatible socket (female) on the host. Typically, M.2 SSDs with a B key or B+M key are SATA, while M.2 SSDs with M key only are mostly NVMe only and incompatible with SATA.

The M.2 standard is designed as a revision and improvement to the mSATA standard, so that larger printed circuit boards (PCBs) can be manufactured. While mSATA took advantage of the existing PCI Express Mini Card form factor and connector, M.2 has been designed to maximize usage of the card space, while minimizing the footprint.

Supported host controller interfaces and internally provided ports are a superset to those defined by the SATA Express interface. Essentially, the M.2 standard is a small form factor implementation of the SATA Express interface, with the addition of an internal USB 3.0 port.

=== U.2 (SFF-8639) ===

U.2, formerly known as SFF-8639. Like M.2, it carries a PCI Express electrical signal, however U.2 uses a PCIe 3.0 ×4 link providing a higher bandwidth of 32 Gbit/s in each direction. In order to provide maximum backward compatibility the U.2 connector also supports SATA and multi-path SAS.

== Topology ==

SATA uses a point-to-point architecture. The physical connection between a controller and a storage device is not shared among other controllers and storage devices. SATA defines multipliers, which allows a single SATA controller port to drive up to fifteen storage devices. The multiplier performs the function of a hub; the controller and each storage device is connected to the hub. This is conceptually similar to SAS expanders.

 PC systems have SATA controllers built into the motherboard, typically featuring two to eight ports. Additional ports can be installed through add-in SATA host adapters (available in variety of bus-interfaces: USB, PCI, PCIe).

== Backward and forward compatibility ==

=== SATA and PATA ===

At the hardware interface level, SATA and PATA (Parallel AT Attachment) devices are completely incompatible: they cannot be interconnected without an adapter.

At the application level, SATA devices can be specified to look and act like PATA devices.

Many motherboards offer a &quot;Legacy Mode&quot; option, which makes SATA drives appear to the OS like PATA drives on a standard controller. This &quot;Legacy Mode&quot; eases OS installation by not requiring that a specific driver be loaded during setup, but sacrifices support for some (vendor specific) features of SATA. Legacy Mode often if not always disables some of the boards&#x27; PATA or SATA ports, since the standard PATA controller interface supports only four drives. (Often, which ports are disabled is configurable.)

The common heritage of the ATA command set has enabled the proliferation of low-cost PATA to SATA bridge chips. Bridge chips were widely used on PATA drives (before the completion of native SATA drives) as well in standalone converters. When attached to a PATA drive, a device-side converter allows the PATA drive to function as a SATA drive. Host-side converters allow a motherboard PATA port to connect to a SATA drive.

The market has produced powered enclosures for both PATA and SATA drives that interface to the PC through USB, Firewire or eSATA, with the restrictions noted above. PCI cards with a SATA connector exist that allow SATA drives to connect to legacy systems without SATA connectors.

=== SATA 1.5 Gbit/s and SATA 3 Gbit/s ===
The designers of SATA standard as an overall goal aimed for backward and forward compatibility with future revisions of the SATA standard. 
To prevent interoperability problems that could occur when next generation SATA drives are installed on motherboards with standard legacy SATA 1.5 Gbit/s host controllers, many manufacturers have made it easy to switch those newer drives to the previous standard&#x27;s mode.
Examples of such provisions include:
* Seagate/Maxtor has added a user-accessible jumper-switch, known as the &quot;force 150&quot;, to enable the drive switch between forced 1.5 Gbit/s and 1.5/3 Gbit/s negotiated operation.
* Western Digital uses a jumper setting called &quot;OPT1 enabled&quot; to force 1.5 Gbit/s data transfer speed (OPT1 is enabled by putting the jumper on pins 5 and 6).
* Samsung drives can be forced to 1.5 Gbit/s mode using software that may be downloaded from the manufacturer&#x27;s website. Configuring some Samsung drives in this manner requires the temporary use of a SATA-2 (SATA 3.0 Gbit/s) controller while programming the drive.

The &quot;force 150&quot; switch (or equivalent) is also useful for attaching SATA 3 Gbit/s hard drives to SATA controllers on PCI cards, since many of these controllers (such as the Silicon Image chips) run at 3 Gbit/s, even though the PCI bus cannot reach 1.5 Gbit/s speeds. This can cause data corruption in operating systems that do not specifically test for this condition and limit the disk transfer speed.

=== SATA 3 Gbit/s and SATA 6 Gbit/s ===

SATA 3 Gbit/s and SATA 6 Gbit/s are compatible with each other. Most devices that are only SATA 3 Gbit/s can connect with devices that are SATA 6 Gbit/s, and vice versa, though SATA 3 Gbit/s devices connect with SATA 6 Gbit/s devices only at the slower 3 Gbit/s speed.

=== SATA 1.5 Gbit/s and SATA 6 Gbit/s ===

SATA 1.5 Gbit/s and SATA 6 Gbit/s are compatible with each other. Most devices that are only SATA 1.5 Gbit/s can connect with devices that are SATA 6 Gbit/s, and vice versa, though SATA 1.5 Gbit/s devices only connect with SATA 6 Gbit/s devices at the slower 1.5 Gbit/s speed.

== Comparison to other interfaces ==

=== SATA and SCSI ===
Parallel SCSI uses a more complex bus than SATA, usually resulting in higher manufacturing costs. SCSI buses also allow connection of several drives on one shared channel, whereas SATA allows one drive per channel, unless using a port multiplier. Serial Attached SCSI uses the same physical interconnects as SATA, and most SAS HBAs also support 3 and 6 Gbit/s SATA devices (an HBA requires support for &quot;Serial ATA Tunneling Protocol&quot;).

SATA 3 Gbit/s theoretically offers a maximum bandwidth of 300 MB/s per device, which is only slightly lower than the rated speed for SCSI Ultra 320 with a maximum of 320 MB/s total for all devices on a bus. SCSI drives provide greater sustained throughput than multiple SATA drives connected via a simple (i.e., command-based) port multiplier because of disconnect-reconnect and aggregating performance. In general, SATA devices link compatibly to SAS enclosures and adapters, whereas SCSI devices cannot be directly connected to a SATA bus.

SCSI, SAS, and fibre-channel (FC) drives are more expensive than SATA, so they are used in servers and disk arrays where the better performance justifies the additional cost. Inexpensive ATA and SATA drives evolved in the home-computer market, hence there is a view that they are less reliable. As those two worlds overlapped, the subject of reliability became somewhat controversial. Note that, in general, the failure rate of a disk drive is related to the quality of its heads, platters and supporting manufacturing processes, not to its interface.

Use of serial ATA in the business market increased from 22% in 2006 to 28% in 2008.

=== Comparison with other buses ===
SCSI-3 devices with SCA-2 connectors are designed for hot swapping. Many server and RAID systems provide hardware support for transparent hot swapping. The designers of the SCSI standard prior to SCA-2 connectors did not target hot swapping, but in practice, most RAID implementations support hot swapping of hard disks.

<text>The Passion Play or Easter pageant is a dramatic presentation depicting the Passion of Jesus: his trial, suffering and death. The viewing of and participation in Passion Plays is a traditional part of Lent in several Christian denominations, particularly in the Catholic and Evangelical traditions; as such Passion Plays are often ecumenical Christian productions.

Passion Plays have had a long and complex history involving faith and devotion, civic pageantry, religious and political censorship, large-scale revival and historical re-enactments.

==Origin and history in the United Kingdom==

The origin and development of Passion Plays in the UK can be traced back to one of the earliest pieces of theatre in Britain, which was the Quem Quaeritis: four lines spoken by two choirs addressing each other in a dramatic form. It can also be traced back to the liturgical drama used within the church and the Corpus Christi festivals which took place outside the church.

Passion Plays were the focal point of the Mystery Plays that were performed by city guilds in many medieval cities, the most prominent being York, Chester and Coventry. Public performances of Passion Plays lasted from the fourteenth century to the middle of the sixteenth century, with a few examples into the seventeenth century.

During the Reformation, the Passion Plays and Mystery Cycles were suppressed due to their perceived Catholic influences. Eventually, in 1642 all theatre was banned with the suppression of the playhouses by a Puritan Parliament. With the Restoration, theatres opened again in 1660, this time with women permitted to perform on the stage. However, religion and politics were heavily censored for the next few hundred years in England and no Passion Play was performed publicly during this time.

The modern revival of Passion Plays began with the revival of the York Mystery Plays in 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain, the Chester Mystery Plays in the 1970s and the York and Towneley Plays as part of the Edinburgh Festival in 1977.

==Origin and history in Europe==

===The Easter play precedent===
The development of the Passion Play was about the same as that of the Easter Drama. It originated in the ritual of the Church, which prescribes, among other things, that the Gospel on Good Friday should be sung in parts divided among various persons. Later, the Passion Play made its appearance, first in Latin, then in vernacular languages; contents and forms were adapted more and more to audience expectations, until, in the fifteenth century, the popular religious plays had developed. The Benedictbeurn Passion Play (thirteenth century) is still largely composed of Latin ritual sentences in prose and of church hymns, and, being designed to be sung, resembles an oratorio.

===Addition of music and characters===
Yet even this oldest of the Passion Plays already shows a tendency to break away from the ritual and to adopt a more dramatic form. This evolution is shown by the interpolation of free translations of church hymns and of German verses not pertaining to such hymns, as well as by the appearance of Mary (the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus) and Mary Magdalene in the action. From these humble beginnings, the Passion Play developed very rapidly, since in the fourteenth century it was at a stage of development that could not have been reached except by repeated practice. From this second period, we have the Vienna Passion, the St. Gall Passion, the oldest Frankfort Passion, and the Maestricht Passion. All four Plays, as they are commonly called, are written in rhyme, principally in German.

===Expansion===
The Vienna Passion embraces the entire history of the Redemption, and begins with the revolt and fall of Lucifer; the play, as transmitted to us, ends with Jesus and his Twelve Apostles sitting at the Last Supper.

The oldest Frankfort Passion play, that of Canon Baldemar von Peterwell (1350–1381), the production of which required two days, was more profusely elaborated than the other Passion Plays of this period. Of this play only the &quot;Ordo sive Registrum&quot; has come down to us, a long roll of parchment for the use of the director, containing stage directions and the first words of the dialogues. The plays based on this list of directions lead us to the period in which the Passion Play reached its highest development (1400–1515). During this period the later Frankfort Passion Play (1467), the Alsfelder, and the Friedberger (1514) originated. Connected with this group are the Eger, the Donaueschingen, Augsburg, Freising and Lucerne Passion Plays, in which the whole world drama, beginning with the creation of man and brought down to the coming of the Holy Ghost, is exhibited, and which was produced with great splendour as late as 1583.

==The Tyrolese Passion Play==
===Expansion and consolidation of previous plays===
Nearly all these Passion Plays have some relation to those coming from the Tyrol, some contributing to, others taking from, that source. These, again, are founded upon the Tyrolese Passion play which originated during the transition period of the fourteenth to the fifteenth century. Historian J. E. Wackernell, with the aid of the plays that have reached us, has reconstructed this period. In Tyrol the Passion Plays received elaborate cultivation; at Bolzano they were presented with great splendour and, in 1514, lasted no less than seven days. Here, too, the innovation of placing the female roles in the hands of women was introduced, which innovation did not become general until during the seventeenth century.

===Elaborate, public productions===
The magnificent productions of the Passion Plays during the fifteenth century are closely connected with the growth and increasing self-confidence of the cities, which found its expression in noble buildings, ecclesiastical and municipal, and in gorgeous public festivals. The artistic sense and the love of art of the citizens had, in co-operation with the clergy, called these plays into being, and the wealth of the citizens provided for magnificent productions of them on the public squares, whither they migrated after expulsion from the churches. The citizens and civil authorities considered it a point of honour to render the production as rich and diversified as possible. Ordinarily, the preparations for the play were in the hands of a spiritual brotherhood, the play itself being considered a form of divine mystical worship. People of the most varied classes took part in the production, and frequently the number of actors was as high as two hundred and even greater. It was undoubtedly no small task to drill the performers, particularly since the stage arrangements were still very primitive.

===Staging and set design===
The stage was a wooden structure, almost as broad as it was long, elevated but slightly above the ground and open on all sides. A house formed the background; a balcony attached to the house represented Heaven. Under the balcony three crosses were erected. Sometimes the stage was divided into three sections by doors. Along the sides of the stage, taken lengthwise, stood the houses required for the production; they were indicated by fenced-in spaces, or by four posts upon which a roof rested. The entrance into Hell was pictured by the mouth of a monster, through which the Devil and the souls captured or released during the plays passed back and forth. The actors entered in solemn procession, led by musicians or by a præcursor (herald), and took their stand at the places appointed them. They remained on the stage all through the performance; they sat on the barriers of their respective divisions, and were permitted to leave their places only to recite their lines. As each actor finished speaking, he returned to his place. The audience stood around the stage or looked on from the windows of neighbouring houses. Occasionally platforms, called &quot;bridges&quot;, were erected around the stage in the form of an amphitheatre.

===Simplicity of scenery, dialogue, action, and costumes===
The scenery was the background of old-time middle east. There were no side scenes, and consequently no stage perspective. Since an illusion of reality could not be had, indications were made to suffice. Thus a cask standing on end represents the mountain on which Christ is tempted by the Devil; thunder is imitated by the report of a gun; in order to signify that the Devil had entered into him, Judas holds a bird of black plumage before his mouth and makes it flutter. The suicide of Judas is an execution, in which Beelzebub performs the hangman&#x27;s duty. He precedes the culprit up the ladder and draws Judas after him by a rope. Judas has a black bird and the intestines of an animal concealed in the front of his clothing, and when Satan tears open the garment the bird flies away, and the intestines fall out, whereupon Judas and his executioner slide down into Hell on a rope. A painted picture representing the soul, is hung from the mouth of each of the two thieves on the cross; an angel takes the soul of the penitent, the devil that of the impenitent thief. Everything is presented in the concrete, just as the imagination of the audience pictures it, and the scenic conditions, resembling those of the antique theatre demand. All costume, however, is contemporary, historical accuracy being ignored.

==Rediscovery of the Passion Play==
===Decline===
School dramas now came into vogue in Catholic and Protestant schools, and frequently enough became the battle-ground of religious controversies. When, in the 17th century the Jesuit drama arose, the Passion Plays (still largely secularized) were relegated to out-of-the-way villages and to the monasteries, particularly in Bavaria and Austria. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, during the Age of Enlightenment, efforts were made in Catholic Germany, particularly in Bavaria and the Tyrol, to destroy even the remnants of the tradition of medieval plays.

===Revival===
Public interest in the Passion Play developed in the last decades of the 19th century, and the statistician Karl Pearson wrote a book about them.

Since then, Brixlegg and Vorderthiersee in Tyrol and Horice na Sumave, near Cesky Krumlov in the Czech Republic, and above all, the Oberammergau in Upper Bavaria attract thousands to their plays.

The text of the play of Vorderthiersee (&quot;Gespiel in der Vorderen Thiersee&quot;) dates from the second half of the seventeenth century, is entirely in verse, and comprises in five acts the events recorded in the Gospel, from the Last Supper to the Entombment. A prelude (Vorgespiel), on the Good Shepherd, precedes the play. After being repeatedly remodelled, the text received its present classical form from the Austrian Benedictine, P. Weissenhofer. Productions of the play, which came from Bavaria to the Tyrol in the second half of the eighteenth century, were arranged at irregular intervals during the first half of the nineteenth century; since 1855 they have taken place at regular intervals, at Brixlegg every ten years. The Höritz Passion Play, the present text of which is from the pen of Provost Landsteiner, has been produced every five years, since 1893.

==Modern performances of the Passion Play==
===Australia===
In Australia, several major productions of The Passion are staged annually during the lead up to Easter.
* The Iona Passion Play was founded in 1958 in Queensland, and tours cities and towns around Australia. In each location the touring cast invites community members to join the production.
* The &quot;Moogerah Passion Play&quot;, established in 1993, is produced annually, at Easter time, in Queensland. It is staged &quot;realistically&quot; at The Lake Theatre, a large, purpose built, lakeside theatre designed specifically for the Moogerah Passion Play. Contemporary versions of the play endeavour to use different Bibles to convey messages to the audience every year. 
* In New South Wales, at Turramurra, &quot;The Turramurra Passion&quot; is a contemporary, character-driven interpretation, using multimedia elements and an original score that was established 1999. 
* Other dramas with redemptionist themes, such as Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; &quot;The Just Vengeance&quot;, as produced at the Melbourne Town Hall in 1947, have been described as &quot;passion plays&quot;.

===Bavaria===

The chief survivor of former times is the Oberammergau Passion Play, first performed in the Bavarian village of Oberammergau in 1634 and now performed every 10 years. The next Oberammergau Passion Play was to take place in 2020 but was delayed to 2022 amid COVID-19 concerns.

In 2010, about half the inhabitants of Oberammergau took part in the once-a-decade Passion Play; over 2,000 villagers brought the story of Jesus of Nazareth to life for audiences that flocked in from around the world. In accordance with tradition, the play started with Jesus entering Jerusalem, continued with his death on the cross, and finished with the Resurrection.

2010 saw a new production directed by Christian Stückl, director at Munich&#x27;s noted Volkstheater. He was supported by the artistic team that, along with him, staged the 2000 Passion Play: deputy director and dramatic adviser Otto Huber, set and costume designer Stefan Hageneier, music director Marxus Zwink, and conductor Michael Bocklet. All four of these collaborators are from Oberammergau. The play started at 14.30 and included a three-hour interval, ending at 22.30. Performances took place between mid-May and early October 2010.

===Italy===
The Passion of Christ is performed in Sordevolo (Piedmont) every five years since 1816, from June to September, by all the inhabitants of the village in an open-air amphitheatre 4,000 square meters wide, of 2,400 seats under cover. In front of the audience is rebuilt a corner of Jerusalem. Each actor involved (about 500 people) is a volunteer, as well as who works &quot;behind the scenes&quot;(about 300 people) for scenography, costumes, script, horses. It is one of the greatest shows about the Passion of Christ in Italy, sacred in the topic, popular in its realization. About 40 shows are performed for each season. The next edition was planned for 2020, but has been postponed to summer 2022 due to the Coronavirus pandemic (June–September).

===Brazil===

The Passion of the Christ is performed every year during Easter, in a purpose-built theatre-city in the arid backlands of Pernambuco, in northeastern Brazil. It is considered to be the largest open-air theatre in the world. Thousands of visitors arrive every year to watch the performance; over 500 actors appear on the nine separate stages within the stone walls of the New Jerusalem city-theatre, founded in 1968. 2.2 miles of walls and 70 towers flank the outer perimeter of the New Jerusalem Theater. The first passion play in the town took place in 1951, and consisted only of a few family and friends playing all of the roles. In 1963, the townspeople began constructing a replica Jerusalem in Brejo da Madre de Deus. The nine separate stages include The Upper Room, the Roman Forum, Herod&#x27;s palace, Bethesda Lake and the Sepulcher. During 8 performances during the Holy Week, an average of 8,000 people per show from around the globe follow the actors as they move through &quot;ancient Jerusalem&quot;, portraying every step of the Passion of Christ. In the 2010 season, when the 43rd anniversary of the Passion of Christ in Nova Jerusalem was celebrated, the public reached a record 80,000 people, coming from 22 Brazilian states and 12 countries.

===Canada===
* The Canadian Badlands Passion Play is performed annually in Drumheller, Alberta. It is staged outdoors in a naturally occurring amphitheatre in the hills of the Drumheller valley. Performers are a mix of professionals and volunteers from across Alberta and Canada, with nearly 300 actors and musicians annually.
* In Hamilton, Ontario, Cardinal Newman Catholic Secondary School puts on a Passion Play annually for all the students who attend it.
* In Kingston, Ontario, a full-scale Passion Play production has been traditionally performed for decades at the Kingston Gospel Temple, a Pentecostal worship center. The production features local amateur and professional talent.
* In Manitoba, located in the La Riviere Valley at Oak Valley&#x27;s Outdoor theatre, located on the edge of the Pembina Valley. The cast and crew are volunteers from all over southern Manitoba. Rehearsals usually start in April or early May and are ready for mid-July performances.
* In Thornhill, Ontario, in what has become an annual tradition at St. Joseph the Worker Parish, over 200 parish youth and young adults annually come together to present the Life and Passion of Christ.
* In Queensway Cathedral (Toronto, Ontario) a Passion Play takes place during the Easter Season. For more than 20 years, the Church on the Queensway (formally Queensway Cathedral) has presented different versions of the Passion Play in their 3200-seat venue, using hundreds of volunteers, live animals, singers and dancers. The play has become a favorite, and most shows experience capacity crowds. This presentation is known for its powerful portrayal of the life of Christ, dramatic resurrection, and ascension scenes. 
*There is also a well-known Passion Play in Vaughan, Ontario, organized by St. Peters Parish and performed at Holy Cross Catholic Academy.
*Church of the Rock, an interdenominational church in Winnipeg, Manitoba, performs annual passion plays themed around movies such as &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;. Their &quot;Avengers&quot;-themed play went viral in 2022.

===Hungary===

Kőhegy (Stone Mountain) Chapel at Budaörs was built by Franz Wendler to whom Virgin Mary had appeared in a dream. He supposedly dreamt of a dog rose on Stone Mountain, every flower of which bore the face of Mary. On the petals he read: &quot;I am the Immaculate Conception&quot;. In spring 1855, Wendler started construction. On 15 October 1855, the chapel was consecrated to Mary&#x27;s Immaculate Conception. Franz Wendler lived in a cave next to the chapel from 1878 until his death. The chapel is one of the most important pilgrimage places for Germans of Hungary in the area of Buda. Every three years, Budaörs&#x27; inhabitants stage a passion play with Hungarian and German text.

===Malta===
The island nation of Malta features many Passion Plays, put on by provincial club, societies, and theatres in various localities. Each village and town often hosts several plays, and there is some competition among the troupes to put on the most moving or beautiful display. These are often combined with processions and &quot;wirjiet&quot; (&quot;exhibitions&quot;) that feature models and renditions of the Passion.

Since 2007, a Passion Play entitled &quot;Il-Mixja&quot;, with Jesus being played by popular Maltese actor Alan Fenech and featuring some of the most highly acclaimed actors in Malta, has become one of the highlights of the genre on the island with the audience experiencing the passion of Jesus Christ as if they were present on the streets of Jerusalem during those historical two days. The play is held outdoors and has so far been held four times in the streets of Rabat, once at Ħaġar Qim temples and four times (2013–2016) for charity on the grounds surrounding Mount Carmel Hospital. In 2017 the event was held at the presidential Verdala palace in aid of the Malta Community Chest Fund. In 2018 it was held both at Verdala Palace and on the grounds surrounding Mount Carmel Hospital whereas in 2019 the production once again changed location to the Romeo Romano Gardens in Santa Venera with once again the Malta Community Chest Fund Foundation and the service users of Mount Carmel Hospital being the beneficiaries of this charity event. The 2020 edition was cancelled due to COVID-19, however 2021 will see the production being transformed into a virtual experience screened in cinemas and online. It also marked Alan Fenech&#x27;s last time in the role of Jesus, the role being taken up as from 2022 by John Vassallo. Since the 2022 edition, it has always been held in the gardens of the Verdala Palace and under the distinct patronage of the President of the Republic of Malta. All proceeds go towards the Malta Community Chest Fund Foundation.

===The Netherlands===
*&quot;De Passiespelen&quot; is a re-enactment of the Passion of the Christ taking place every year that is divisible by 5, e.g., in 2005 and 2010. It is performed in the open air in Openluchttheater De Doolhof, in Tegelen. It originated in 1931 and has become an internationally acclaimed event drawing visitors from all over the world.
*Since 2011, Nederland 3 has broadcast &quot;The Passion&quot;, a live television musical that features a rendition of the story set in the present day, accompanied by popular music. Serving as a Dutch adaptation of BBC Three&#x27;s special, &quot;Manchester Passion&quot; (2006), it has since been held annually in different cities, with the 2015 edition seen by approximately 3.57 million viewers. The concept has also been sold as a television format to other countries, such as Belgium and the United States.

===The Philippines===

The predominantly Catholic Philippines has Passion Plays called &quot;Senákulo&quot;, named after the Upper room, every &quot;Semana Santa&quot; (Holy Week). Theatre companies and community groups perform different versions of the &quot;Senákulo&quot;, using their own scripts that present the dialogue in either poetic or prosaic form. These scripts are decades or even centuries-old, and draw from both the Bible and folk tradition.

Costumes and scenery in traditional Senákulo conform to Hispanic iconography instead of actual historical realism, which is more common with recent productions (particularly by professional companies). Some productions use ropes to hold actors on crosses while others use actual nails.

One of the more popular Senákulo is &quot;Ang Pagtaltal&quot; in Jordan, Guimaras, which began in 1975 and draws some 150,000 visitors annually. Some people perform crucifixions outside of Passion Plays to fulfill a &quot;panatà&quot; (vow for a request or prayer granted), such as the famous penitents in Barangay San Pedro Cutud, San Fernando, Pampanga.

===Poland===
Tradition of Passion Plays in Poland has become popular again in the early 20th century. Today the best known plays take place in Kałków, Kalwaria Pacławska, the Pallotines&#x27; Seminary in Ołtarzew, and the most prominent in Sanctuary of Kalwaria Zebrzydowska. This Passion Play is one of the oldest. 
*Since 1998, there has been a yearly Passion Play in Poznan, performed on Palm Sunday in open air of Cytadela City Park. Now it is the biggest performance of this kind in Europe. In 2009, 100,000 pilgrims were expected to attend.

===Slovenia===
In the 17th and 18th century, Passion Plays were organised in the towns of the Slovene Lands, like Kranj, Ljubljana, and Novo Mesto. Their language was German, Slovene, or both. They were all based on the tradition of the Ljubljana Passion Play, which was organised by Capuchins and first performed from ca. 1608 until ca. 1613. The most distinguished of them has been the Škofja Loka Passion Play. It was written by Father Romuald in 1715, with modifications until 1727, on the basis of an older tradition. It is the oldest preserved play in Slovene as well as the oldest preserved director&#x27;s book in Europe and the only one extant from the Baroque period. The Škofja Loka Passion Play was performed each year until 1767. The procession was revived in 1999, and reprised in 2000 and 2009, with further reprisals planned for 2015 and 2021. The play&#x27;s reprisals are the largest open-air theatre production in Slovenia.

===Spain===

In Catalonia, it is common for villages to present different Passion Plays every Easter, like the ones in Esparreguera, Olesa de Montserrat, Ulldecona or Cervera, first documented in 1538. Olesa&#x27;s 1996 production surpassed the world record for the most people acting on stage at the same time, with 726 persons. Balmaseda, in the Spanish Basque Country, holds the leading Passion Play in the region.

===Sri Lanka===
The earliest Passion Plays in Sri Lanka, at Vanny in Mannar, Pesalai, Pamanugama, Mutuwal, Pallansena, Kalamulla, Duwa and Pitipana in Negombo, used life-size statues instead of living actors. Influenced by the Oberammergau Passion Play, K. Lawrence Perera, began the practice of using living actors in the Borelassa Passion Play. Women later began to take part in the play. However, for a period of time after 1939, the Archbishop of Colombo banned performances because of his disapproval of the women&#x27;s participation. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, there are many Passion Play enactments in Sri Lanka:
*Duwa Passion Play, near Negombo (1988)
*The &quot;Yagaya&quot; Passion Play at Kandawala, Katana (1990/92)
*&quot;Aho mage Senageni&quot; and &quot;Aho mage senageni&quot; at Halpe, Katana (1990s)
*&quot;Kurusiya Matha Miyadunemi&quot;, a modern Passion Play enacted in the villages of Katuwapitiya and Bolawalana in Negombo (1999, 2000, 2001)
*&quot;Thambakande Paskuwa&quot; at St. Bruno&#x27;s Church in Negombo with a large number of celebrities as actors (2012)
*&quot;Tharakayano&quot;, the first ballet style Passion Play, enacted in Negombo (2012).
* &quot;Maha Premaya&quot;, the Easter passion play, was enacted on 24 March 2018 at Dungalpitiya, Don Bosco auditorium in Negombo. Over 80 actors participated. Produced by Rev. Fr. Manjula Priyantha (SDB), directed by George Dinesh Manthrige.

The &quot;Minneapolis Star-Tribune&quot; says, &quot;With 700 participants, dozens of live animals, flames, rain and &#x27;lightning&#x27;, North Heights Lutheran Church&#x27;s annual Passion Play is spectacular.&quot; More than 400,000 attended the performances over 19 years before the production was discontinued. Over 20,000 attended the final season, including more than 150 tour buses and groups. Performances began in April 1989 and ended 22 April 2007.

;Missouri
* The &quot;New Melle Community Passion Play&quot; is presented by an all-volunteer ecumenical group in a &quot;theatre in the round&quot; indoor setting. The story of the last days in the life of Christ is told using a script and music, based loosely on the cantata &quot;Then Came Sunday&quot;, by Rodger Strader. It has grown in size and popularity over the past 32 years.

;Mississippi
* The First United Methodist Church in Kosciusko, Mississippi has been performing their Passion Play for 30 years. It has been a mainstay in the community as well as the state. Members of the Church and community come together to share in fellowship and learn about the last days of Jesus Christ. This is an original script of the Passion, written by a former minister of the church.

;New Jersey
*The longest running Passion Play in the United States has been performed in North Hudson, New Jersey since 1915 and at the Park Performing Arts Center since 1931. In 1997, there was a minor controversy when an African-American actor was cast as Jesus.
* &quot;The Jesus Story&quot;, presented by Bible Baptist Church in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, has been running for 20 years. First starting out as a small representation of the passion of Jesus, this production has developed into a full-time musical performance. Over the years, the play&#x27;s format has changed focusing on the point of view of several different people including Mary the mother of Jesus, the Roman Soldiers, the Thieves on the Cross, and many others. The show is performed at Felician College in Lodi, New Jersey, and runs for approximately seven shows per year. Every year it is general admission, and there is no cost to view the play.
* &quot;He Is Alive!&quot; was formerly presented by the Fountain of Life Center, an Assemblies of God church in Burlington, New Jersey. It drew large crowds and attracted visitors to the church in South Jersey and Philadelphia metropolitan area. The play ran from the 1980s until 2016, and included the Easter story from Last Supper, the Crucifixion of Jesus, and the Resurrection of Jesus. The play was performed on 8 nights during the month building up to Easter Sunday, and each show drew an audience of around 1,500-2,000 people. The play was free to attend, but donations were taken and merchandise was sold to fund the production of the play.

;Ohio 
* The St. John Passion Play, greater Cincinnati Ohio, performed every year without interruption rehearsals beginning in 1917, first performance in Feb. 1918 which seems to make it the oldest annually performed, without interruption in the United States of America. Currently housed in the Lockland Christian Church, Lockland, Ohio (www.locklandchristian.org). A free will offering is suggested for general admission. The beginning of the play traces back to February 1917 when the United States of America was at war. Like other parishes throughout the United States, St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati had readily given its quota of men to the armed forces during World War 1. Eight of them had already been killed in action. Father Richard Wurth, Franciscan pastor of St. John the Baptist Church, was deeply saddened by the loss of these eight young men and considered how he and his parishioners could merit a special protection of God for the others serving in active duty. He remembered how the wood-carving peasants of Oberammergau in the Bavarian Alps had escaped the Black Death in the 17th century by vowing to produce a Passion Play every ten years in thanksgiving. With hope in his heart, Father Wurth decided on a similar strategy. He produced Veronica, or the Holy Face, a play centered on the passion and death of Christ. After the third and final performance, he called all of the actors together backstage. Realizing there had been no more battle-related casualties, they joined hands in thanksgiving and solemnly pledged to present a passion play annually thereafter for the continued protection of those serving in the war. The following year 1918, the St. John Passion Play was formally established. The closing of St. John the Baptist Church in 1969 almost meant the demise of the Play. However, several committed cast and crew members were determined to keep it alive and organized the St. John Passion Play as a charitable nonprofit corporation. Since then, the Play has been performed every year in numerous churches and auditoriums throughout the greater Cincinnati area and has in recent years been housed on the grounds of the Lockland Christian Church, Lockland, Ohio.
* In Cambridge, Ohio, the &quot;Living Word Outdoor Drama&quot; has been offered every summer since 1975.
* In Duncan Falls, Ohio, Cornerstone Full Gospel Church has put on the drama &quot;Worthy Is The Lamb&quot;, for over 30 years. The drama features a cast of over 150+, is free to the public, and is presented on Good Friday and Easter Sunday of each year.

;Oklahoma
*One of the U.S.&#x27;s longest-running Passion Plays is held at the Holy City of the Wichitas, located within the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma. The Holy City started as an Easter Passion Play in the Wichita Mountains in 1926. The impetus behind both the pageant and city was the Reverend Anthony Mark Wallock (b. 1890, in Austria). In 1926, he took his Sunday school class up a mountain, where a tableau of the Resurrection was presented. The popularity of this service led to its becoming an annual event. In 1927, the service became nonsectarian and was referred to by the Lawton Constitution as &quot;Oklahoma&#x27;s Oberammergau&quot;.
*Since 1990, the Muskogee First Assembly of God has performed a widely popular version of the passion beginning Good Friday and running through Easter under the direction of Debra Rose. The drama utilizes acting, music, dance and live animals by a volunteer cast and crew of 50.

;Pennsylvania
* In Downingtown, Pennsylvania, the Hopewell United Methodist Church has performed a version of the play in a 1,000 seat outdoor amphitheater each year since 1963. The original version of &quot;The Passion Play&quot;, initiated in 1963, is based in the King James Version of the Bible, but a newer version, entitled &quot;The Power and The Glory&quot; was launched in 2005, based in several modern-language translations of the Bible. The church offers both versions on successive weekends in June each year as a free offering to their audience.
* In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Harrisburg Christian Performing Arts Center performs annual Passion Plays during the two weekends before Easter. They have been doing this since 1973, with 2013 marking their 40th annual Passion Play. The Passion Plays produced here are written by staff members, and music under public domain is added to give it a musical aspect. A new play is produced every year, apart from the 40th Passion Play &quot;The Keys&quot;, which was previously produced in the early 90s.

;South Dakota
* The &quot;Black Hills Passion Play&quot; was performed every summer for almost 70 years in Spearfish, South Dakota; this production was an American version of the Lünen Passion Play that was brought over in 1932 by immigrants, who claimed that it had been produced since 1242. The production was Americanized by seventh-generation Passion Player Josef Meier, who toured it around the country before bringing it to Spearfish in the 1930s; until its last performance on 31 August 2008, the show was produced under the auspices of Meier&#x27;s daughter Johanna, a world-famous opera singer who had her debut in the play at the age of five weeks. During the winter months from 1953 through 1998, the same cast also performed the play in Lake Wales, Florida.

;Tennessee
* East Tennessee has hosted many Passion Plays, including &quot;The Smoky Mountain Passion Play&quot; in Townsend, Tennessee from 1973 to 1992, &quot;The Great Passion Play&quot; at Pigeon Forge, Tennessee in 1988, and &quot;The Gatlinburg, Tennessee Musical Passion Play&quot;, which closed in 1996.

;Texas
*The Passion is performed annually in downtown San Antonio, Texas, with a procession leading from Milam Park to San Fernando Cathedral.
*One of the most widely viewed modified passion plays in the United States is &quot;The Promise&quot;, performed near Glen Rose, Texas. Between Glen Rose and its sister production in Branson, Missouri, over one million people have seen &quot;The Promise&quot;.
*The Play has also been performed in Hughes Springs, Texas as &quot;The Passion Play&quot;.

;Utah
* The Mormon Miracle Pageant is performed every summer in Manti, Utah, by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It includes a visitation by Jesus Christ, shortly after His resurrection, to inhabitants of ancient America, as recorded in The Book of Mormon.

;Virginia
* The American version of the Oberammergau Passion Play was performed in Strasburg, Virginia, each summer from 1973 to 1986. This version was originally written by Val Balfour. Locals volunteered as extras, and church groups came from all over Virginia, Maryland, etc. to see the play. The same play toured all over the country in the fall and winter months.
* The &quot;Loudoun Passion Play&quot; is an outdoor re-enactment of the Easter story that has the audience walk between scenes to follow the story. It has been performed every year since 1986 on Palm Sunday weekend, in parks and other outdoor locations in and around Purcellville, Virginia.

;Washington
* In Seattle, Washington, a large group of 8th graders performs the Passion Play at St. Joseph&#x27;s School, on Palm Sunday and Good Friday. Their piece involves several songs from &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, including &quot;Heaven On Their Minds&quot; and &quot;Trials and Tribulations&quot;. This story also involves some minor parts, including the Women with Perfume, Mary Mother of Jesus, Peter denying knowing Jesus, and The Prayer in Gethsemane. This has been tradition at St. Joseph&#x27;s for over 30 years.

;Wisconsin
*From 1990 to 2012, Lighthouse Christian Church&#x27;s Impact Productions in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin performed &quot;The Promise&quot; during Holy Week, with breaks in 1995, 2006, and 2009. Beginning in 2000, the show was merged with another production by David T. Clydesdale, &quot;The Power of His Love&quot;, and the production was entitled &quot;The Promise: The Power of His Love&quot;.

===Mexico===
Passion plays are common in almost all catholic churches across Mexico during Holy Week, especially on Good Friday. They commonly follow the Stations of the Cross. The most famous passion play in the country is the Passion Play of Iztapalapa.

==The Passion Play in motion pictures==
* 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (produced and directed by Mel Gibson) had a plot similar to that of Passion Plays.
* 1989&#x27;s &quot;Jesus of Montreal (Jésus de Montréal)&quot; (directed by Denys Arcand) presented the staging of a very unorthodox Passion Play while the players&#x27; own lives mirrored the Passion.

==Antisemitism in Passion plays==
Many Passion Plays historically blamed the Jews for the death of Jesus in a polemical fashion, depicting a crowd of Jewish people condemning Jesus to crucifixion and a Jewish leader assuming eternal collective guilt for the crowd for the murder of Jesus, which, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; explains, &quot;for centuries prompted vicious attacks – or pogroms – on Europe&#x27;s Jewish communities&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine in its article, &quot;The Problem With Passion&quot;, explains that &quot;such passages (are) highly subject to interpretation&quot;.

Although modern scholars interpret the &quot;blood on our children&quot; () as &quot;a specific group&#x27;s oath of responsibility&quot; some audiences have historically interpreted it as &quot;an assumption of eternal, racial guilt&quot;. This last interpretation has often incited violence against Jews; according to the Anti-Defamation League, &quot;Passion plays historically unleashed the torrents of hatred aimed at the Jews, who always were depicted as being in partnership with the devil and the reason for Jesus&#x27; death&quot;. The &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, in its article, &quot;Capturing the Passion&quot;, explains that &quot;historically, productions have reflected negative images of Jews and the long-time church teaching that the Jewish people were collectively responsible for Jesus&#x27; death. Violence against Jews as &#x27;Christ-killers&#x27; often flared in their wake.&quot; &quot;Christianity Today&quot; in &quot;Why some Jews fear The Passion (of the Christ)&quot; observed that &quot;Outbreaks of Christian antisemitism related to the Passion narrative have been...numerous and destructive.&quot;

Some of the oldest currently-running passion plays have had to reckon with past polemic portrayals of Jews in the work. The Oberammergau Passion Play is an especially notable example. First performed in 1634, the play continues to run today. In its original incarnation, the play relied upon the Antisemitic canard that Jews bore greater responsibility than any other group in the killing of Christ. It utilizes juxtaposition between pure Christians and wicked Jews in order to portray a greater battle between fundamental good versus evil.

Hitler attended the Passion Play in Oberammergau twice and praised it for its convincing portrayal of &quot;the menace of Jewry&quot;.[1] Although he praised the Passion Play, he also derided Christianity. According to Alan Bullock, writing in , Hitler saw Christianity as a religion fit only for slaves, and its teaching as a rebellion against the natural law of selection by struggle of the fittest. Following the events of World War II and the explicit support of Adolf Hitler for the play, several reforms and modifications were made. In the last few decades, it has revised its script and performance with the help of representatives from Jewish organizations.

While Oberammergau is perhaps the most famous example, this was not the only instance of Anti-Semitism or Anti-Semitic rhetoric in a Passion Play. The Towneley Mystery Plays, also known as the Wakefield Mystery Plays, also featured Anti-Semitic imagery, and ran from the late Middle Ages until 1578. It is believed to be one of the earliest and most explicit portrayals of Pontius Pilate as a king or a Jew (and sometimes as king of the Jews) in theatre (although this tradition had already become well-established in paintings and other visual media by this point). Through these stylings, the Jews are further implicated in the killing of Christ as being both the judge and the jury. This consistent rendering was emulated throughout Christendom in the Middle Ages, and is perpetuated in subtler forms even today.

In 1965, a Vatican declaration titled Nostra Aetate held that the crucifixion could not be blamed on the Jewish people, whether they were living in the first century or born after the death of Christ.

The Religion Newswriters Association observed that
&quot;in Easter 2001, three incidents made national headlines and renewed [Jewish and Christian leaders&#x27;] fears. One was a column by Paul Weyrich, a conservative Christian leader and head of the Free Congress Foundation, who argued that &quot;Christ was crucified by the Jews.&quot; Another was sparked by comments from the NBA point guard and born-again Christian Charlie Ward, who said in an interview that Jews were persecuting Christians and that Jews &quot;had his [Jesus&#x27;] blood on their hands.&quot; Finally, the evangelical Christian comic strip artist Johnny Hart published a B.C. strip that showed a menorah disintegrating until it became a cross, with each panel featuring the last words of Jesus, including &quot;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do&quot;.
On 16 November 1998, Church Council of Evangelical Lutheran Church in America similarly adopted a resolution prepared by its Consultative Panel on Lutheran-Jewish Relations urging any Lutheran church presenting a Passion Play to adhere to their &quot;Guidelines for Lutheran-Jewish Relations&quot;, stating that &quot;the New Testament . . . must not be used as justification for hostility towards present-day Jews,&quot; and that &quot;blame for the death of Jesus should not be attributed to Judaism or the Jewish people.&quot;

In 2003 and 2004 some people compared Mel Gibson&#x27;s film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; to these kinds of Passion Plays, but this characterization is hotly disputed; an analysis of that topic is in the article on The Passion of the Christ.

Modern Passion Plays and contemporary re-tellings of the Passion story place greater emphasis on the Biblical account which tells a more complex story. Rather than isolating Jewish people as responsible for the death of Christ, the Bible reminds readers that Jesus was Jewish and his many supporters, friends and family were Jewish. Furthermore, the Bible alludes to the complex political, social and religious reasons that led both Roman and Jewish people to demand that Jesus be crucified.

Modern Passion Plays are supported in their endeavour to address historical prejudices and crimes against Jewish people by the work of many organisations that seek (Christian-Jewish Reconciliation). For example, in 1947, the International Council of Christians and Jews (ICCJ) explored the relationship basis of Christianity and antisemitism and in 2002, the Christian Scholars group issued &quot;&quot;

The work of the American Jewish Committee, a leading global Jewish advocacy organization, and the Anti-Defamation League in changing the historical abuses of the Oberammergau play has provided greater awareness and understanding for future Passion Plays to learn from.

A recent statement on the website of the Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding &amp; Cooperation (CJCUC) in Israel is described by Rabbi Dr. Shmuly Yanklowitz as &#x27;the most profoundly Jewish-centered interfaith documents ever to be released&#x27;. Writing in the Huff Post, he quotes its opening lines &quot;We seek to do the will of our Father in Heaven by accepting the hand offered to us by our Christian brothers and sisters. Jews and Christians must work together as partners to address the moral challenges of our era&quot;.

==Supporters of Passion Plays==
===Passion Trust===

The Passion Trust supports the resurgence of Passion Plays in the United Kingdom through resourcing, networking, advocating and financing new and existing plays. Established in 2011, its vision is to energise the growing number of Passion Plays taking place in the UK.

The Passion Trust hosts an annual conference in various locations around the UK, drawing together actors, arts practitioners, producers, directors, fundraisers and journalists to explore new and time-tested approaches to Passion Plays.

===Europassion===
Europassion is a large European organisation which supports Passion Plays in Europe. Established in 1982, this umbrella organisation draws together Passion Play communities from countries all over Europe, some of which have been performing their plays for hundreds of years. According to Mons. Fausto Panfili, the Chaplain of the Europassion:

&quot;The experience of the Europassion constantly lets us experience a so far unexplored pathway, so that we can continue to grow. Surmounting a self-referred vision of our own experience obligates us to confront a regional, national, European and universal horizon. That is why a new vision, not fragmentary, is necessary. Unity doesn&#x27;t mean uniformity. A spiritual energy, stronger and more attentive to cultural elaboration, a more evident solidarity in order to be recognised as bearers of hope, to help the people and communities grow.&quot;

<text>The Galway International Arts Festival (GIAF), founded in 1978, is a cultural organisation that produces an annual arts festival in Galway, Ireland. It also produces new work that tours nationally and internationally, in addition to presenting the discussion forum, &quot;First Thought Talks&quot;. The festival maintains a non-profit status.

== History ==
The Galway Arts Festival organisation was founded in 1978 by University College Galway&#x27;s Arts Society in collaboration with community activists from the Galway Arts Group. The first festival was described in local papers as &quot;Galway Arts Society&#x27;s Week of Craic&quot;. Their original budget was €1000 of Arts Council Funding and most of the artistic events were staged in an arts centre that now houses Sheridan&#x27;s Cheesemongers.

The name was changed in 2014 to the Galway International Arts Festival to emphasize the diversity of contributors to the festival. &quot;The festival presents and produces work in Galway which sits side by side with the work of artists and companies from around the world,&quot; Artistic Director Paul Fahy stated. The name change also facilitated the vision of the festival as a producing body, creating works that tour internationally.

== Festival ==
The festival takes place in Galway for two weeks in late July. It presents and produces programmes across theatre, music, visual arts, opera, street spectacle, dance, discussion, and comedy. The 2018 festival set records for attendance, breaking a quarter million for the first time, representing a 20% increase over the participants in the 2017 festival. Over 600 artists created and took part in over 200 events across the festival. This 41st festival also featured a new Festival Garden in Eyre Square, offering pop-up performances and local food stands. The Festival Garden attracted more than 145,000 people. Visitors to the 2017 festival were estimated to be 45% from Galway, 18% around the rest of Ireland, and 37% outside of Ireland.

== Touring ==
The organisation has produced or co-produced more than 20 productions which have toured to London, New York, Edinburgh, Chicago, Adelaide, Sydney, Hong Kong, and Washington. These include four exhibition commissions. GIAF has also fostered a relationship with Landmark Productions, a Dublin-based production company. Together, they have produced multiple works written by or directed by Irish playwright Enda Walsh that have toured internationally.

==Music==

GIAF has hosted musical guests in their Big Top tent, erected yearly in the Fisheries Field on the campus of NUI Galway. GIAF has also partnered with local music and comedy venue Róisín Dubh for some of their programmed events. Performances in the music programme have included: Elvis Costello, Suede, The National, St. Vincent, Philip Glass, David Byrne, Blondie, Kronos Quartet, Brodsky Quartet and Bon Iver.

==Visual arts==

Visual artists who have exhibited have included David Hockney, Bill Viola, Henri Matisse, Patricia Piccinini, Hughie O&#x27;Donoghue, David Mach and John Gerrard.

In 2018, GIAF announced a new Internship programme in the visual arts to train 25 participants to be able to engage with patrons in the galleries.

==Theatre and dance==
Irish playwright Enda Walsh has featured in past GIAF line-ups. His first play, &quot;Disco Pigs&quot;, which was also Cillian Murphy&#x27;s first stage role, debuted at the festival in 1997. Walsh has since gone on to work with the festival to produce works ranging from operas to experimental staged &#x27;rooms.&#x27; His 2014 play &quot;Ballyturk&quot; won Best Production at the Irish Times Theatre Awards and his 2011 play &quot;Misterman&quot; toured to New York City and was the New York Times Critics&#x27; Choice for eighteen days in a row.

American actor John Mahoney was a frequent performer in the festival starting in 2000. Visiting international theatre and dance companies have included the National Theatre, Propeller, the Royal Court Theatre, Steppenwolf, Fabulous Beast Dance Company, Hofesh Shechter Dance Company, Michael Clark Company, Druid Theatre Company and the Bristol Old Vic.

==First Thought Talks==
Starting in 2012, GIAF hosted a series of talks at each festival revolving around the festival&#x27;s theme. The 2018 festival&#x27;s First Thought Talks about &#x27;Home&#x27; was opened by President Michael D. Higgins and was followed up by 43 other scholars, artists, scientists, and athletes, both Irish and international. The majority of these talks are recorded and can be accessed online. They are also live-streamed on Facebook.

<doc id="174158" wikidata="Q207333" url="?curid=174158" title="Honour">
<text>Honour (Commonwealth English) or honor (American English; see spelling differences) is a quality of a person that is of both social teaching and personal ethos, that manifests itself as a code of conduct, and has various elements such as valour, chivalry, honesty, and compassion. It is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or of institutions such as a family, school, regiment, or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or institutions) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and with the moral code of the society at large.

Samuel Johnson, in his &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (1755), defined honour as having several senses, the first of which was &quot;nobility of soul, magnanimity, and a scorn of meanness&quot;.
This sort of honour derives from the perceived virtuous conduct and personal integrity of the person endowed with it. Johnson also defined honour in relationship to &quot;reputation&quot; and &quot;fame&quot;; to &quot;privileges of rank or birth&quot;, and as &quot;respect&quot; of the kind which &quot;places an individual socially and determines his right to precedence&quot;. This sort of honour is often not so much a function of moral or ethical excellence, as it is a consequence of power. Finally, with respect to sexuality, &quot;honour&quot; has traditionally been associated with (or identical to) &quot;chastity&quot; or &quot;virginity&quot;, or in case of married men and women, &quot;fidelity&quot;. Some have argued that honour should be seen more as a rhetoric, or set of possible actions, than as a code.

== Social context ==
Honour as a code of behaviour defines the duties of an individual within a social group. Margaret Visser observes that in an honour-based society &quot;a person is what he or she is in the eyes of other people&quot;. A code of honour differs from a legal code, also socially defined and concerned with justice, in that honour remains implicit rather than explicit and objectified.

One can distinguish honour from dignity, which Wordsworth assessed as measured against an individual&#x27;s conscience rather than against the judgement of a community. Compare also the sociological concept of &quot;face&quot;.

In the early medieval period, a lord&#x27;s or lady&#x27;s honour was the group of manors or lands he or she held. &quot;The word was first used indicating an estate which gave its holder dignity and status.&quot; For a person to say &quot;on my honour&quot; was not just an affirmation of his or her integrity and rank, but the veracity behind that phrase meant he or she was willing to offer up estates as pledge and guarantee.

The concept of honour appears to have declined in importance in the modern West; conscience has replaced it in the individual context, and the rule of law (with the rights and duties defined therein) has taken over in a social context. Popular stereotypes would have it surviving more definitively in more tradition-bound cultures (e.g. Pashtun, Southern Italian, Polish, Persian, Turkish, Arab, Iberian, &quot;Old South&quot; or Dixie) in a perception akin to Orientalism. Pre-modern societies may tend to &quot;honour&quot; more than do contemporary industrial societies. Saint Anselm of Canterbury () in &quot;Cur Deus Homo&quot; extended the concept of honour from his own feudal society to postulate God&#x27;s honour.

An emphasis on the importance of honour exists in such traditional institutions as the military (serving officers may conduct a court of honour) and in organisations with a military ethos, such as Scouting organisations (which also feature &quot;Courts of Honour&quot;).

Honour in the case of sexuality frequently relates, historically, to fidelity: preservation of &quot;honour&quot; equates primarily to maintenance of the virginity of singles and to the exclusive monogamy of the remainder of the population. Further conceptions of this type of honour vary widely between cultures; some cultures regard honour killings of (mostly female) members of one&#x27;s own family as justified if the individuals have &quot;defiled the family&#x27;s honour&quot; by marrying against the family&#x27;s wishes, usually for reasons such as refusing to enter an arranged marriage, having sex outside marriage, dressing in ways which are deemed inappropriate, or engaging in homosexual relations or even by becoming the victims of rape. Western observers generally see these honour killings as a way of men using the culture of honour to control female sexuality. In India, there have been honour killings of men from lower castes.

Skinners, executioners, grave-diggers, shepherds, barber-surgeons, millers, linen-weavers, sow-gelders, latrine-cleaners, bailiffs and their families were among the &quot;dishonourable people&quot; (&quot;unehrliche Leute&quot;) in early modern German society.

== Cultural difference from law ==

Various sociologists and anthropologists have contrasted cultures of honour with cultures of law. A culture of law has a body of laws which all members of society must obey, with punishments for transgressors. This requires a society with the structures required to enact and enforce laws. A culture of law incorporates a social contract: members of society give up some aspects of their freedom to defend themselves and to retaliate for injuries, on the understanding that society will apprehend and punish transgressors.

An alternative to government enforcement of laws is community or individual enforcement of social norms.

One way that honour functions is through reputation. In a system where there is no court that will authorise the use of force to guarantee the execution of contracts, an honourable reputation is very valuable to promote trust among transaction partners. To dishonour an agreement could be economically ruinous, because future potential transaction partners might stop trusting the party not to lie, steal their money or goods, not repay debts, mistreat the children they marry off, have children with other people, abandon their children, or fail to provide aid when needed. A dishonourable person might be shunned by the community as a way to punish bad behaviour and create an incentive for others to maintain their honour.

If one&#x27;s honour is questioned, it can thus be important to disprove any false accusations or slander. In some cultures, the practice of dueling arose as a means to settle such disputes firmly, though by physical dominance in force or skill rather than by objective consideration of evidence and facts.

Honour can also imply duty to perform certain actions, such as providing for and disciplining one&#x27;s children, serving in the military during war, contributing to local collective projects like building infrastructure, or exacting revenge in retaliation for acts one is directly harmed by.

===Family honour===
The concept of personal honour can be extended to family honour, which strengthens the incentives to follow social norms in two ways. First, the consequences of dishonourable actions (such as suicide or attempted robbery that results in death) outlive the perpetrator, and negatively affect family members they presumably care about. Second, when one member of the family misbehaves, other members of the family are in the position to and are incentivised to strongly enforce the community norms.

In strong honour cultures, those who do not conform may be forced or pressured into conformance and transgressors punished physically or psychologically. The use of violence may be collective in its character, where many relatives act together. An extreme form of punishment is honour killing. Dueling and vengeance at a family level can result in a sustained feud.

Honour-based cultures are also known as honour-shame cultures and are contrasted with guilt cultures on the guilt-shame-fear spectrum of cultures.

Cultures of honour are often conservative, encoding pre-modern traditional family values and duties. In some cases these values clash with those of post-sexual revolution and egalitarian societies. Cultures of law sometimes consider practices in honour cultures to be unethical or a violation of the legal concept of human rights; for example, they may outlaw vigilante or individual justice-taking.

==Examples==

Thinkers ranging from Plato to Montesquieu have remarked upon the mindset needed for a culture of honour.

Historians have examined the culture of honour in the American South. Social scientists have looked at specialised subcultures such as South Asian Muslims in Britain. Others have compared multiple modern nations.

From the viewpoint of anthropologists, cultures of honour typically appear among nomadic peoples and among herdsmen who carry their most valuable property with them and risk having it stolen, without having recourse to law enforcement or to government. Due to the lack of strong institutions, cultivating a reputation for swift and disproportionate revenge increases the safety of one&#x27;s person and property against aggressive actors.

According to Richard Nisbett, cultures of honour will often arise when three conditions exist:

# a scarcity of resources
# situations in which the benefit of theft and crime outweighs the risks
# a lack of sufficient law-enforcement (such as in geographically remote regions)

Historically, cultures of honour exist where the herding of animals dominates an economy. In this situation, the geography is usually extensive, since the soil cannot support intensive sustained farming and thus large populations; the benefit of stealing animals from other herds is high, since animals are the main form of wealth; and there is no central law-enforcement or rule of law. However, cultures of honour can also appear in places like modern inner-city slums. The three conditions exist here as well: lack of resources (poverty); crime and theft have high rewards, compared to the very limited alternatives; and law enforcement is generally lax or corrupt.

Once a culture of honour exists in a society, its members find it difficult to make the transition to a culture of law, which requires that people become willing to back down and refuse to immediately retaliate. From the viewpoint of the culture of honour, the perceived humiliation of such an action makes personal restraint extremely difficult, as it reflects weakness and appeasement.

One paper finds that present-day Canadians born in communities that historically lay outside the reach of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Mounties) seem to inherit a violent code of honour that drives their behaviour.

==War of 1812==
Historian Norman Risjord emphasised the importance of honour as a cause of the War of 1812, which the United States launched against Britain despite Britain&#x27;s much more powerful naval and military strength. Americans of every political stripe saw the need to uphold national honour, and to reject the treatment of the United States by Britain as a third class nonentity. Americans talked incessantly about the need for force in response. This quest for honour was a major cause of the war in the sense that most Americans who were not involved in mercantile interests or threatened by Indian attack strongly endorsed the preservation of national honour. The humiliating attack by HMS &quot;Leopard&quot; against USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; in June 1807 was a decisive event. Historians documented the importance of honour in shaping public opinion in a number of states, including Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee, as well as the territory of Michigan. Americans widely celebrated the conclusion of the war as successful, especially after the spectacular defeat of the main British invasion army at New Orleans restored the American sense of honour. 
:National honor, the reputation of republican government, and the continuing supremacy of the Republican party had seemed to be at stake... National honor had [now] been satisfied, says historian Lance Banning, &quot;Americans celebrated the end of the struggle with a brilliant burst of national pride.&quot;

The British showed respect for American honour. &quot;Some of the strongest praise for America and swiftest recognition of what the young republic had achieved for American honor, prestige, and power came from within British naval circles.&quot; Britain refrained from interfering with American maritime interests and ceased with the impressment of American citizens following the war.

=== Predisposition in the United States of America ===

A 2016 study suggests that honour culture increases the risk of war. The study found that international conflicts under U.S. presidents who were raised in the South of the country &quot;are shown to be twice as likely to involve uses of force, last on average twice as long, and are three times more likely to end in victory for the United States than disputes under non-Southern presidents. Other characteristics of Southern presidencies do not seem able to account for this pattern of results.&quot;

<text>Baron was a Japanese lawyer and politician who served as Prime Minister of Japan in 1939.

Hiranuma rose to prominence as a prosecutor and official in the Ministry of Justice. He served as minister of Justice under Prime Minister Yamamoto Gonnohyōe and later became a privy counsellor. After serving as president of the privy council, he became prime minister in 1939, but resigned later the same year. He later returned to cabinet under Fumimaro Konoe. After the Japanese surrender, he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East for his role in World War II.

== Early life ==
Hiranuma was born on 28 September 1867, in what is now Tsuyama City, Okayama Prefecture, as the son of a low-ranking samurai from the Tsuyama Domain of Mimasaka Province. His upbringing and early education was steeped in &quot;bushido&quot; and the study of Chinese classics. Hiranuma graduated with a degree in English law from Tokyo Imperial University in 1888.

Hiranuma reacted against the rapid westernisation and disregard for Japanese culture common at that time. Throughout his life, his political principles would be substantially based on Confucianism as taught by the Mito School. Like the Mito scholars, Hiranuma believed that Japan possessed a particular essence, the &quot;kokutai&quot;, characterised by the moral bond between the nation and the Emperor as a sacred ruler. Foreign influences, unless properly adapted, he viewed as threats to the &quot;kokutai&quot;.

== Ministry of Justice ==
After graduation, Hiranuma obtained a post in the Ministry of Justice. Hiranuma established a reputation during his time at the Ministry of Justice as a strong opponent of government corruption, and successfully handled a number of high-profile cases. He served as director of the Tokyo High Court, public prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Japan, and Director of the Civil and Criminal Affairs Bureau. In 1909, he secured the conviction of 25 former and serving members of the Diet of Japan for accepting bribes from the Japan Sugar Company.

Hiranuma was highly outspoken against corruption and immorality in Japan&#x27;s political parties, and that attitude soon expanded to include what he saw to be foreign threats, such as socialism and liberal democracy. As Hiranuma rose within the ministry he attracted a considerable following among his juniors, notably including Kisaburo Suzuki and Suehiko Shiono.

In 1911, he was chief prosecutor for the High Treason Incident, the 1910 socialist-anarchist plot to assassinate the Meiji Emperor. The closed-court trial of 25 men and 1 woman, including 4 Buddhist monks, resulted in the execution of 12, including the prominent anarchist Shūsui Kōtoku and the feminist Kanno Suga.

He rose to become Vice Minister of Justice in 1911 and Prosecutor General in 1912. In 1915, he forced Home Minister Ōura Kanetake in the cabinet of Prime Minister Ōkuma Shigenobu to resign for suspected bribery in what is known as the Ōura scandal. In 1921, Hiranuma became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

Hiranuma was appointed Minister of Justice in the second cabinet of
Gonnohyōe Yamamoto, formed in the aftermath of the Great Kantō earthquake in September 1923. Hiranuma resigned along with rest of the cabinet in January 1924 to take responsibility for the lapse in security represented by the Toranomon incident, in which a communist attempted to assassinate Crown Prince Hirohito. The incident gave Hiranuma a renewed vigilance towards what he considered subversive ideology and for this reason he formed the &quot;Kokuhonsha&quot;, a political organisation with the intention of defending the &quot;kokutai&quot;. This organisation gathered a broad range of influential figures, including General Sadao Araki, Admiral Kanji Katō, Kisaburo Suzuki, Yoshimichi Hara and Harumichi Tanabe.

At the nomination of the new prime minister Keigo Kiyoura, Hiranuma was appointed to the Privy Council in February 1924.

== Privy Counsellor ==
While serving on the Privy Council, Hiranuma continued to exercise a strong influence on the Ministry of Justice. Hiranuma and his clique were the driving force behind the adoption of the Peace Preservation Law, intended to combat communism and other threats to the &quot;kokutai&quot;.

In April 1926 , one of Hiranuma&#x27;s old superiors in the Ministry of Justice, was appointed president of the Privy Council. Upon Kuratomi&#x27;s request, Hiranuma was appointed vice president. Hiranuma would serve in that role for ten years and exerted considerable influence. Hiranuma, together with the senior privy counsellors Miyoji Ito and Kentaro Kaneko, would lead the conservatives who dominated the council. In October of the same year, Hiranuma was elevated to the rank of baron (男爵, &quot;danshaku&quot;) in the &quot;Kazoku&quot; peerage system abolished by the 1947 Constitution.

Hiranuma was strongly opposed to Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijirō&#x27;s efforts at economic reform. He was also strongly opposed to the ratification of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. In 1931, he rallied support within the government for the Imperial Japanese Army after it had seized control of Manchuria without prior authorization, and he later helped in the creation of Manchukuo. He also pushed for Japan&#x27;s withdrawal from the League of Nations. According to one theory, he in 1934 he directed the prosecution during the Teijin Incident.

During the 1930s, Hiranuma was often considered as a candidate for prime minister, but he had incurred the enmity of the last &quot;genrō&quot; Prince Saionji, who had the right to nominate the prime minister. As a supporter of parliamentary government, Saionji disliked Hiranuma for undermining party cabinets. Furthermore, Saionji was wary of the influence of the &quot;Kokuhonsha&quot;, which he considered to be close to fascism. Hiranuma himself denied any association with fascism, which he considered a foreign ideology unsuitable for Japan.

When Kuratomi retired in May 1934 he recommended Hiranuma as his successor, but due to Saionji&#x27;s opposition the Imperial Household Minister Kitokurō Ichiki was appointed instead. Hiranuma was appointed President of the Privy Council after Ichiki&#x27;s retirement in February 1936.

== Prime minister ==

Hiranuma was Prime Minister of Japan from 5 January 1939 to 30 August 1939. His administration was dominated by the debate on whether Japan should ally itself with Germany against the Soviet Union. Hiranuma wanted an anticommunist pact, but feared a military alliance would commit Japan to war against the United States and the United Kingdom when most of its armed forces were already committed to the Second Sino-Japanese War. 

With the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in August 1939, Hiranuma&#x27;s cabinet resigned over that foreign policy issue and over the massive defeat of the Japanese Army in Mongolia during the Nomonhan Incident against the Soviet Union.

== Return to cabinet ==
Hiranuma became a central figure in a conservative reaction against the New Order Movement promoted by Fumimaro Konoe since his reappointment as prime minister in July 1940. Hiranuma criticised the Imperial Rule Assistance Association as a potential &quot;new shogunate&quot; prejudicial to the prerogatives of the Emperor. Hiranuma was furthermore concerned that the new organisation was being dominated by radicals with socialist tendencies, such as Yoriyasu Arima, Kingoro Hashimoto and Seigo Nakano.

Eventually Konoe himself began to feel that the New Order Movement had become too radical. As a solution for this Hiranuma entered the cabinet as Home Minister in December 1940. Hiranuma&#x27;s associate, Lieutenant General Heisuke Yanagawa became minister of justice at the same time. Hiranuma moved to neutralise the IRAA, stating in the Diet in January 1941 that the IRAA would not conduct politics, but merely serve as a public association supporting the state. In March the leadership of the IRAA was replaced, with Yanagawa being appointed to the hitherto vacant post of vice president and the moderate former Finance Minister replacing Yoriyasu Arima as secretary general. Hiranuma declared in April that IRAA would be under the supervision and control of the Home Ministry.

As Home Minister, he was a staunch defender of State Shinto. Hiranuma declared: &quot;We should research the ancient rites in detail and consider their application in administrative affairs in general and the common life of the nation.”

Hiranuma was strongly opposed to the political and diplomatic actions of Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka and to the Tripartite Pact concluded between Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and Fascist Italy in September 1940. The cabinet was reshuffled in July 1941 in order to remove Matsuoka, partially due to Hiranuma&#x27;s maneuvering.

In the new cabinet Matsuoka was replaced by Admiral Teijiro Toyoda. Hiranuma and Yanagawa became ministers without portfolio, with Hiranuma&#x27;s protégé Harumichi Tanabe as his successor in the Home Ministry. During this period Hiranuma frequently met with the American Ambassador Joseph Grew in order to de-escalate the conflict between Japan and America. In August 1941 was Hiranuma attacked in his home by a member of a small ultranationalist group. Despite being shot six times Hiranuma survived and fully recovered.

Hiranuma withdrew from government upon the resignation of Konoe in October 1941.

==&quot;Jushin&quot;==
Hiranuma served as one of the &quot;jushin&quot; (重臣), or unofficial senior advisors, to Emperor Hirohito during World War II. Hiranuma saw the &quot;jushin&quot; as the core of a new group of &quot;genrō&quot; advisors, as the last surviving Meiji period &quot;genrō&quot;, Prince Saionji Kinmochi, had died in November 1940. The new group included former prime ministers Mitsumasa Yonai, Nobuyuki Abe and Fumimaro Konoe. In April 1945, Hiranuma was again appointed president of the Privy Council.

==Prosecution and conviction==
After the War, he was arrested by the American Occupation Authorities and was convicted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East as a Class A War Criminal. 

He was given a life sentence, but paroled in early 1952, and died shortly afterwards. His grave is in Tama Cemetery, outside Tokyo.

<text>was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army, Prime Minister of Japan, and the last Governor-General of Korea.

==Early life and military career==
Abe was born on November 24, 1875, in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, the son of the former samurai Abe Nobumitsu, who had served the Kaga Domain. His brother-in-law was Imperial Japanese Navy admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue.

Abe attended Tokyo No.1 Middle School (Tokyo Metropolitan Hibiya High School) followed by No.4 High School. While he was still a student, he volunteered for military service during the First Sino-Japanese War.

After the war, Abe graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in November 1897. Commissioned a second lieutenant the following 27 June, he was promoted to lieutenant in November 1900 and attended the Army Artillery School, graduating in December 1901. Promoted to captain in November 1903, he enrolled in the 19th class of the Army War College, graduating in November 1907. The ultranationalist General Araki Sadao was one of his classmates.

Abe was promoted to major in December 1908, becoming an instructor at the Army War College in September 1909. In November 1910, he was posted to the German Empire as a military attaché at the Japanese embassy and became a supplementary attaché at the embassy in Vienna in February 1913.

Abe was promoted to lieutenant colonel in February 1915 and to colonel on 24 July 1918. He served as the commander of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment from 1918 to 1921. In August 1918, his regiment was sent to Siberia during Japan&#x27;s Siberian Intervention but never saw combat. He became secretary of the Army War College on 3 June 1921, and was promoted to major general on 15 August 1922. Appointed Director of the General Affairs Division of the Imperial General Staff on 6 August 1923, following the devastating earthquake of 1 September, he was placed in charge of overseeing martial law for the Kanto region on 3 September.

He was appointed director of military service affairs in the Army Ministry on 28 July 1926 and was promoted to lieutenant general on 5 March 1927. He later served as chief of the Military Affairs Bureau and as Vice Minister of the Army, which he had been appointed as on 10 August 1928. He commanded the 4th Infantry Division from 22 December 1930.

In January 1932, Abe was appointed to command the Japanese Taiwan Army and was promoted to full general on 19 June 1933. After serving on the Supreme War Council, he was placed on the reserve list on 10 March 1936.

==Prime minister==

Abe was not the obvious first choice as prime minister after the collapse of the Hiranuma Kiichirō cabinet. From the civilian side, Konoe Fumimaro or Hirota Kōki were regarded as front-runners, but the Army and the ultranationalists strongly supported General Ugaki Kazushige. After &quot;genrō&quot; Saionji Kinmochi declared his lack of enthusiasm for any of those candidates, the Army was poised to have its way. However, Ugaki fell ill and was hospitalized. The interim War Minister General Abe was a compromise choice. He had the advantage of belonging to neither the &quot;Tōseiha&quot; nor the &quot; Kodoha&quot; political factions within the Army and was also supported as a relative political moderate by the Imperial Japanese Navy. On the other hand, he was despised by many senior Army officers for his total lack of any combat experience.

Abe became Prime Minister on 30 August 1939. He concurrently held the portfolio of Foreign Minister. During a reign which lasted only four months, Abe sought to end as quickly as possible the Second Sino-Japanese War, and to maintain Japan&#x27;s neutrality in the growing European conflict. He also opposed to efforts by elements within the Army to form a political-military alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Increasingly lacking in support from either the military or the political parties, Abe was replaced by Mitsumasa Yonai in January 1940.

==Later career==
 Three months later after his replacement as Prime Minister, Abe was sent by the army as a special envoy to China to advise the Japanese-supported regime of Wang Jingwei in Nanjing and to negotiate a treaty ensuring Japanese economic and military rights in northern China. However, he had some sympathy for Wang&#x27;s Reorganized National Government. Abe remained as the Japanese ambassador to China in Nanjing until December 1940. After his return to Japan, Abe joined the House of Peers in 1942, and accepted the largely-ceremonial position as president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association. He was appointed the 10th (and last) Governor-General of Korea in 1944 and 1945.

After World War II, Abe was purged from public office and arrested by the American occupation government. However, he was not charged with any war crimes and was soon released.

He rose to the rank of captain in December 1920 and was subsequently sent as naval attaché to Poland from 1921 to 1922.


On his return to Japan, he was captain of the cruisers (1922–1923) and (1923–1924), and battleships (in 1924) and (1924–1925). Yonai was promoted to rear admiral on December 1, 1925. He became Chief of the 3rd Section of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff in December 1926. Within the Navy General Staff, he served on the Technical Council of the Navy Technical Department. He was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the First Expeditionary Fleet, sent to the Yangtze River in China in December 1928. Following the success of this mission, he was promoted to vice-admiral in December 1930 and placed in command of the Chinkai Guard District, in Korea.

Yonai was given command of the IJN 3rd Fleet in December 1932, following which he again commanded the Sasebo Naval District (November 1933), IJN 2nd Fleet (November 1934) and Yokosuka Naval District (December 1935) before receiving appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet and concurrently the IJN 1st Fleet in December 1936. While in command at Sasebo, the Japanese Navy was shaken by the Tomozuru Incident, when it was determined that the basic design of the s was flawed, thus calling into question the basic designs of many of the warships in the Japanese navy.

While in command at Yokosuka, the February 26 Incident erupted in Tokyo. Yonai was visiting his mistress in Shinbashi the night the attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; began, only a couple of blocks away, but knew nothing of the situation until he returned to base the following morning.

==Naval Minister==

Yonai became full admiral in April 1937 and Navy Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Senjūrō Hayashi in 1937. He served in the same position under the subsequent first Fumimaro Konoe and Kiichirō Hiranuma administrations, through August 1939. After Nobuyuki Abe became Prime Minister, Yonai remained on the Supreme War Council. While Navy Minister, Yonai was known as a man of few words. His speeches tended to be short, and were delivered in his almost indecipherable Nambu accent. Written records of his speeches are only about half the length of his contemporaries.

As Navy Minister, Yonai was alarmed by the growing tension between Japan and Great Britain and the United States, at a time when the bulk of the Imperial Japanese Army was tied down in an apparently unending quagmire in China. His efforts to promote peace made him unpopular with ultranationalist extremists, and (as with Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto) he was the target of several assassination attempts. However, Yonai supported the construction of the s in an effort to maintain a military balance with the world&#x27;s other two naval superpowers.

== Prime Minister of Japan ==

Yonai was appointed the Prime Minister of Japan and formed his cabinet from January 6, 1940, largely with the backing of Emperor Hirohito. As the Prime Minister, he continued the strong pro-British, pro-American stance he held as Navy Minister and continued his strong opposition to the Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

Following the German occupation of the Low Countries and France in May–June 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army began to show dissatisfaction with Yonai&#x27;s anti-German and anti-Italian policy. The disagreement became apparent in early July 1940, as Army Minister Shunroku Hata began to criticize the Prime Minister openly. When Hata resigned, Yonai was subsequently forced to resign on July 21, 1940. The Japanese Constitution required the Army Minister to be an active-duty general and no other general would accept the position, due to the pro-Axis stance of the Imperial Japanese Army. The Tripartite Pact was signed on September 27, 1940.

==Subsequent political activity==
Yonai served as the Deputy Prime Minister and concurrently as the Navy Minister again under the cabinet of Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso from July 22, 1944, during which time he returned to the active duty roster from the reserve list. By this time, Saipan had fallen to the Allies.

Yonai remained Navy Minister under the administration of Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki. In the last few weeks before Japan&#x27;s surrender, he sided with Prime Minister Suzuki and Foreign Minister Shigenori Tōgō in support of acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration and surrender of Japan in opposition to Army Minister Korechika Anami, Chief of Naval General Staff Admiral Soemu Toyoda and Chief of the Army General Staff General Yoshijirō Umezu.

Yonai remained Navy Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni and cabinet of Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara from August 1945, during which time he presided over the final dissolution of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

He played a major role during the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in working with the major defendants, such as former Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō, to coordinate their testimonies so that Emperor Hirohito would be spared from indictment. According to his interpreter Suichi Mizota, in March 1946 Bonner Fellers asked him to make Tōjō bear all responsibility for the Greater East Asia War. After the war, Yonai devoted the rest of his life to help to rebuild Japan.

Yonai suffered from high blood pressure most of his life, but died of pneumonia on 20 April 1948 at the age of 68. His grave is located at the temple of Enko-ji in his hometown of Morioka.

==Assessment==
=== Minister of the Imperial Japanese Navy (1937–1939) ===
Because of Yonai’s work as a military attaché in Russia and Poland and his travels around European countries, he had a broader perspective of world affairs than many other senior Japanese military officials. In the late 1930s Yonai already analyzed the naval capabilities of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Allied countries, versus those of Germany and Italy and he concluded that Japan should not ally itself with the Axis Powers. In addition to his experience as an attaché, he had participated in the Battle of the Japan Sea (known in the West as the Battle of Tsushima) during the Russo-Japanese War as a lieutenant, so he understood the realities of naval warfare. Hence, on August 8, 1939, at the five-ministry commission that was intended to make a plan for war, the Minister of Finance, Ishiwata, asked Yonai, &quot;Is it possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to triumph over America and Britain?&quot; (Agawa, n.d.). Yonai answered, &quot;No. The Imperial Japanese Navy is not designed to open fire against them. The Third Reich and the Italian Navy are out of question.&quot; (Agawa, n.d.).

After the historical triumph of the Battle of the Japan Sea in 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War, the Imperial Japanese Navy was the world&#x27;s third strongest. By the end of World War I, Japan had a powerful battle fleet. In the 1930s, following the Washington Naval Treaty, Japan built a strong naval aviation arm with excellent aircraft and pilots. Even so, the Imperial Japanese Navy could not compete against the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, the top two navies in the world. Consequently, the much smaller Kriegsmarine (German Navy) and the Regia Marina (Italian Navy) could not defeat these two dominants. Furthermore, the Imperial Japanese Navy had been made overconfident by its victory and was not willing to acknowledge a position of inferiority. However, his unique experiences made him convinced of his view. Therefore, Yonai clearly announced his opinion: the Imperial Japanese Navy would lose if it attacked the Royal Navy and the United States Navy.

=== Pre-prime minister ===
Before he was chosen as the Prime Minister, Yonai showed strong leadership particularly in crisis. On February 26, 1936, there was an attempted coup d&#x27;état led by young officers of the Imperial Japanese Army. The generals of the Imperial Japanese Army struggled to decide the appellation of the rebel troops, whom the generals were hesitant to refer to as rebels because it was extremely shameful for them to admit internecine strife. Hence, the generals were hesitant. On the other hand, Yonai, the commander-in-chief of the Sasebo Naval District, instantaneously labeled them as &quot;Insurrectional troops&quot;, (Agawa, n.d.) and let the chief of his staff, Admiral Inoue Shigeyoshi, publish his position to all the Sasebo Naval District. Because of this immediate announcement, navy officers in the Sasebo Naval District were compelled to stop participating with the rebellion troops. Yonai&#x27;s prompt action as the supreme commander tranquilized the Sasebo Naval District.

=== Time as prime minister (January 16 to July 16, 1940) ===
Despite not being famous, Yonai made significant decisions that depict his strong moral character. At his appointment as Prime Minister, he retired from active service without being asked to do so. He intended not to control his cabinet ministers by naval influences. This verdict was momentous, as once a general or admiral retires, he loses influence, hence all the generals and admirals are reluctant to retire. Indeed, even Tojo Hideki, the 40th Prime Minister did not retire at his promotion to Prime Minister, but persisted in active service in the Imperial Japanese Army in order to uphold his control over it. Because of Yonai&#x27;s retirement from the Imperial Japanese Navy, the Yonai Cabinet was cooperative. One prominent evidence of this was that: nevertheless his cabinet had continued just a half a year, his cabinet members and followers formed a friendly reunion right after his resignation in 1937, and it still lasting in the Heisei period (1989–2019). This reunion was named Ichi-Roku Kai, which means sixteenth gathering, because Yonai&#x27;s appointment and resignation as a Prime Minister both happened on the 16th day of their months.

=== Emperor&#x27;s trust ===
Emperor Shōwa (Hirohito) trusted Yonai&#x27;s strong moral character. By July 1944, the situation of World War II was apparently against Japan. As for this difficult circumstance, the Imperial Japanese Navy was in a confusion. Supreme commanders of the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to appoint Yonai as the Minister of Navy because he had popularity and charisma enough to unite the Imperial Japanese Navy, although Yonai had already retired. To assign Yonai as the Minister of Navy, the Emperor&#x27;s consent was necessary. Meanwhile, Admiral Suetsugu was also a candidate. The Emperor selected Yonai because Suetsugu was famous for his ambition, and allowed Yonai to be the Minister of Navy even though he was no longer in active service. This appointment demonstrated Shōwa&#x27;s trust in Yonai because he is the only one person in the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s history to return from retirement and be posted to the supreme position as the Minister of Navy. After the Imperial Japanese Navy was defeated, the Emperor called Yonai to the palace. The Emperor amiably invited Yonai to have lunch together. After that, the Emperor said, &quot;I really appreciated your duty and effort not to begin the war. I think we are not going to meet often like before&quot;. He put a pen and inkstone into a case and said, &quot;These are the things that I have used. I would like to present this as a gift to you.&quot; This action is extremely rare because having presented the belongings of the Emperor is the supreme honor and the utmost expression of amiability.

Koiso was born on March 22, 1880, in Utsunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture, the first son of chief inspector of police and &quot;shizoku&quot; (former samurai) Koiso Susumu. He attended eight different schools, graduating from Yamagata Middle School (today Yamagata Prefectural Yamagata East High School). He was accepted as an officer candidate in 1898.

==Military career==
Koiso graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1900 and went on to attend the Army Staff College. Commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the 30th Infantry Regiment in June 1901, he was promoted to Lieutenant in November 1903. During the Russo-Japanese War, he served as Battalion Adjutant in September 1904, Company Commander in March 1905 and was promoted to captain in June 1905.

In November 1910, Koiso graduated from the Army Staff College, 33rd in a class of 55, and returned to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy as an instructor in December 1910.

Reassigned to the Kwantung Army General Staff in September 1912, Koiso was promoted to major and Battalion Commander of the 2d Infantry Regiment in August 1914. He returned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Headquarters in June 1915, was promoted to lieutenant colonel in July 1918, and seconded to the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service in July 1921. After his promotion to colonel in February 1922, he was sent as a military attaché to Europe in June 1922, returning to assume command of the IJA 51st Division in August 1923. Returning to the Army General Staff in May 1925, he was promoted to major general in December 1926 and lieutenant general in August 1931.

During the 1920s Koiso joined the relatively moderate &quot;Tōseiha&quot; (Control Faction) led by General Kazushige Ugaki, along with Gen Sugiyama, Yoshijirō Umezu, Tetsuzan Nagata, and Hideki Tōjō as opposed to the more radical &quot;Kōdōha&quot; (Action Faction) under Sadao Araki.

In February 1932, Koiso became Vice-Minister of War and in August 1932, concurrently Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. In March 1934, he was transferred to command the IJA 5th Division (Hiroshima). He then assumed command of the Chōsen Army in Korea from December 1935. Promoted to full general in November 1937, he joined the Army General Staff in July 1938.

==Colonial affairs and Korea==
Koiso left active duty in July 1938. From April to August 1939, he served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Hiranuma Kiichirō as Minister of Colonial Affairs. He returned to the same post again from January to July 1940 under the Yonai administration.

Koiso was appointed Governor-General of Korea, succeeding Jirō Minami, from May 1942 to 1944, during which time he gained the nickname &quot;The Tiger of Korea&quot; for his looks rather than his military prowess. Koiso continued his predecessor&#x27;s hardline policies, such as imposing the highly unpopular universal military conscription on Koreans, which forced them to fight for the Japanese, on August 1, 1943.

When news of Korean independence reached him after the war, Koiso scoffed &quot;the dream of Korean independence is as foolish as trying to plot the independence of Kyushu or Hokkaido.&quot;

==Prime minister==
After the Allied landing in Normandy (June 6) and the successful capture of Saipan (9 July), Hideki Tojo resigned and a new cabinet was formed. In selecting a new prime minister, the elder statesmen narrowed the candidates down to three: Hisaichi Terauchi (commander of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group), Shunroku Hata (commander of the China Expeditionary Army), and Koiso.

The Army strongly favored General Hisaichi Terauchi; however, they could not afford to recall him to Japan from his role as commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces in Southeast Asia. The civilian government, especially Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kōichi Kido and former prime minister Fumimaro Konoe, also did not favor Koiso, due to Koiso&#x27;s previous involvement with the ultranationalist &quot;Sakura Kai&quot; and its attempted coup d&#x27;état against the government in 1931 (i.e. the &quot;March Incident&quot;). These reservations were shared by the Emperor in his Privy Council meetings. Koiso was supported by two former prime ministers, Mitsumasa Yonai and Hiranuma Kiichirō, and as no consensus could be reached on a more suitable alternative, their arguments prevailed. Moreover, Mitsumasa Yonai was appointed vice-prime minister as a way of dealing with strong objections to Koiso. 

Koiso attempted to end army-navy rivalry by creating a Supreme Chief of Staff (最高幕僚長), but this was structured to favor the army, thus bitter opposition from the navy doomed the plan. Instead, a Supreme War Guidance Council (最高戦争指導会議) was created (August 4, 1944 – August 22, 1945). Koiso was not taken seriously at Council meetings, where he was openly contradicted by Hata Hikosaburo. Within the top levels of the Imperial Army, rumors circulated that the Koiso Cabinet would only last two months (it lasted nine months).

Koiso&#x27;s strategy for ending the war was to strike a hard blow against the American Army in the Philippines, forcing negotiations. However, the general entrusted with the defense of the Philippines, Tomoyuki Yamashita, disagreed with the planners in the Southern Expeditionary Army. As such, the Army and Navy could not agree on a coordinated plan. Nevertheless, the defenders were prepared to make considerable sacrifices when Douglas MacArthur invaded Leyte on October 17, with the first kamikaze attack carried out on October 21, and the Japanese Navy losing four aircraft carriers and three battleships during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Although the strategy had failed, Koiso did not change his way of thinking. Late in 1944, Koiso still planned to send Prince Fumimaro Konoe on a peace mission to neutral countries, Switzerland and Sweden, but it came to nothing.

During the remainder of Koiso&#x27;s premiership in office, Japanese forces continued to suffer a string of defeats on all fronts at the hands of the Allies. Also during his premiership, on 10 November 1944, Wang Jingwei died of pneumonia in a Japanese hospital in Nagoya, which effectively was the end of the Reorganized National Government of China in northern China. For a time, Koiso considered making peace, but he could not find a solution that would appease both the Japanese military and the Allies. Left with little choice but to continue the war effort, Koiso tried to extend his power over the army by attempting to assume the position of War Minister concurrently with that of Prime Minister, but was unable to legally do so as he was on the reserve list. Koiso resigned in April 1945 when American forces invaded Okinawa and his demands to be included in military decisions were rejected, the same date the Imperial Japanese Navy flagship was sunk by American aircraft during Operation Ten-Go.

==Later career==
Koiso was an ardent supporter of State Shinto along with Heisuke Yanagawa, who directed the Government Imperial Aid Association. He restored the ancient sacred rites in the Sukumo river, near Hakone, the &quot;Preliminary Misogi Rite&quot;.

After the end of World War II, Koiso was arrested by the Allied occupation powers and tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East for war crimes. Upon conviction as a Class-A war criminal on counts 1, 27, 29, 31, 32 and 55, he was given a sentence of life imprisonment. The Tribunal specifically cited Koiso&#x27;s decisive role in starting the wars against China and the Allies. &quot;Furthermore, despite the fact that Kuniaki Koiso was not directly responsible for the war crimes committed by the Japanese Army, he took no measures to prevent them or to punish the perpetrators when, as Prime Minister, it was within his power to do so.&quot; Koiso died of esophageal cancer in Sugamo Prison in 1950. His grave is at the Aoyama Cemetery in central Tokyo.

<text>Baron was a Japanese politician and admiral who served as prime minister of Japan from 7 April to 17 August 1945, during World War II. He was prime minister at the time of Japan&#x27;s surrender on 15 August.

Born in Osaka, Suzuki graduated from the Naval Academy and Staff College and served in the First Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars. He was promoted to full admiral in 1923 and served as chief of the naval general staff from 1925 to 1929. In 1945, Suzuki was appointed prime minister shortly after the start of the Battle of Okinawa and the resignation of prime minister Kuniaki Koiso. After the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July, which called for Japan&#x27;s unconditional surrender, Suzuki dismissed it with the word &quot;mokusatsu&quot;. On 14 August, Suzuki attended the conference at which Emperor Hirohito made the decision to surrender over his divided cabinet. Japan surrendered the next day, and Suzuki resigned on 17 August.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Suzuki was born on 18 January 1868, in Izumi Province (present-day Sakai, Osaka), the first son of local governor (&quot;daikan&quot;) of Sekiyado Domain Suzuki Yoshinori. He grew up in the city of Sekiyado, Shimōsa Province (present-day Noda, Chiba Prefecture).

===Naval career===
Suzuki entered the 14th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1884, graduating 13th of 45 cadets in 1887. Suzuki served on the corvettes , and cruiser as a midshipman. On being commissioned as ensign, he served on the corvette , cruiser &quot;Takao&quot;, corvette &quot;Jingei&quot;, ironclad , and gunboat . After his promotion to lieutenant on 21 December 1892, he served as chief navigator on the corvettes , , and .

Suzuki served in the First Sino-Japanese War, commanding a torpedo boat and participated in a night torpedo assault in the Battle of Weihaiwei in 1895. Afterwards, he was promoted to lieutenant commander on 28 June 1898 after graduation from the Naval Staff College and assigned to a number of staff positions including that of naval attaché to Germany from 1901 to 1903. On his return, he was promoted to commander on 26 September 1903. He came to be known as the leading torpedo warfare expert in the Imperial Japanese Navy.

During the Russo-Japanese War, Suzuki commanded Destroyer Division 2 in 1904, which picked up survivors of the Port Arthur Blockade Squadron during the Battle of Port Arthur. He was appointed executive officer of the cruiser on 26 February 1904, aboard which he participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. During the pivotal Battle of Tsushima, Suzuki was commander of Destroyer Division 4 under the IJN 2nd Fleet, which assisted in sinking the Russian battleship .

After the war, Suzuki was promoted to captain on 28 September 1907 and commanded the destroyer Akashi (1908), followed by the cruiser (1909), battleship (1911) and cruiser (1912). Promoted to rear admiral on 23 May 1913 and assigned to command the Maizuru Naval District. Suzuki became Vice Minister of the Navy from 1914 to 1917, during World War I. Promoted to vice admiral on 1 June 1917, he brought the cruisers and to San Francisco in early 1918 with 1,000 cadets, and was received by U.S. Navy Rear Admiral William Fullam. The Japanese cruisers then proceeded to South America. After stints as Commandant of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, Commander of the IJN 2nd Fleet, then the IJN 3rd Fleet, then Kure Naval District, he became a full admiral on 3 August 1923. Suzuki became Commander in Chief of Combined Fleet in 1924. After serving as Chief of Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff from 15 April 1925 to 22 January 1929, he retired and accepted the position as Privy Councillor and Grand Chamberlain from 1929 to 1936.

Suzuki narrowly escaped assassination in the February 26 Incident in 1936; the would-be assassin&#x27;s bullet remained inside his body for the rest of his life, and was only revealed upon his cremation. Suzuki was opposed to Japan&#x27;s war with the United States, before and throughout World War II.

===Prime minister===
On 7 April 1945, Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso resigned and Suzuki was appointed to take his place at the age of seventy-seven. He simultaneously held the portfolios for Minister for Foreign Affairs and for Greater East Asia.

Prime Minister Suzuki contributed to the final peace negotiations with the Allied Powers in World War II. He was involved in calling two unprecedented imperial conferences which helped resolve the split within the Japanese Imperial Cabinet over the Potsdam Declaration. He outlined the terms to Emperor Hirohito who had already agreed to accept unconditional surrender. This went strongly against the military faction of the cabinet, who desired to continue the war in hopes of negotiating a more favorable peace agreement. Part of this faction attempted to assassinate Suzuki twice in the Kyūjō Incident on the morning of 15 August 1945.

After the surrender of Japan became public, Suzuki resigned and Prince Higashikuni became the next prime minister. Suzuki was the Chairman of the Privy Council from 7 August 1944 to 7 June 1945 and again after the surrender of Japan from 15 December 1945 to 13 June 1946.
Suzuki died of natural causes on 17 April, 1948. His grave is in his home town of Noda, Chiba. One of his two sons became director of Japan&#x27;s immigration service, while the other was a successful lawyer.

<doc id="174168" wikidata="Q315717" url="?curid=174168" title="Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni">
<text>was a member of the Japanese imperial family and general of the army who served as prime minister of Japan from 17 August to 9 October 1945. He is the only member of the Japanese imperial family to head a cabinet, and Japan&#x27;s shortest-serving prime minister, serving for only 54 days.

Born in Kyoto, Prince Higashikuni was a son of Prince Kuni Asahiko and married Toshiko, Princess Yasu, a daughter of Emperor Meiji, thus making him an uncle-in-law of Emperor Hirohito. He graduated from the Army Academy and War College, and studied military tactics in France from 1920 to 1926. Upon his return to Japan, he was promoted to general in 1930 and held several military posts, including as commander of the General Defense Command from 1941 to 1944. Prince Higashikuni&#x27;s appointment as prime minister following the war reflected a hope that his prestige as an imperial prince would help to unite the defeated country. He presided over the signing of the surrender on 2 September 1945 and the disbandment of the armed forces before resigning in opposition to an order by the Allied occupation authorities to abolish the Peace Preservation Law. He became a commoner after the abolition of the princely houses in 1947, and later formed a Buddhist sect. He is the longest-lived of Japan&#x27;s premiers, dying in 1990 at the age of 102.

==Early life==
Prince Naruhiko was born on 3 December 1887 in Kyoto, the ninth son of Prince Kuni Asahiko (&quot;Kuni no miya Asahiko Shinnō&quot;) and the court lady Terao Utako. His father, Prince Asahiko, was a son of Prince Fushimi Kuniie (&quot;Fushimi no miya Kuniie Shinnō&quot;), the twentieth head of the Fushimi-no-miya, the oldest of the &quot;sesshu shinnōke&quot; or cadet branches of the imperial dynasty from whom an emperor might be chosen in default of a direct heir. Prince Naruhiko was a half-brother of Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi, the father of the future Empress Kōjun, the wife of Emperor Shōwa. His other half-brothers, Prince Asaka Yasuhiko, Prince Nashimoto Morimasa, and Prince Kaya Kuninori, all formed new branches of the imperial family (&quot;ōke&quot;) during the Meiji period.

==Marriage and family==
Emperor Meiji granted Prince Naruhiko the title &quot;Higashikuni-no-miya&quot; and permission to start a new branch of the imperial family on 3 November 1906. Prince Naruhiko married the ninth daughter of Emperor Meiji, Toshiko, Princess Yasu (11 May 1896 – 5 March 1978), on 18 May 1915. The couple had four sons.

# ; married Shigeko, Princess Teru, the eldest daughter of Emperor Shōwa and Empress Kōjun.
# ; died in the Great Kantō earthquake.
# ; renounced imperial title and created Marquis Awata Akitsune, 1940
# ; renounced imperial title and created Count Tarama Toshihiko, 1943; relocated to Lins, São Paulo, Brazil, 1950.

== Military career ==

Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko was a career officer in the Imperial Japanese Army. In 1908, he graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy as a second lieutenant, was promoted to lieutenant in 1910 and to captain in 1913. In 1914, he graduated from the Army War College. He was commissioned a captain in the 29th Infantry Brigade, and promoted to major in the IJA 7th Division in 1915.

Prince Higashikuni then studied military tactics at the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr and École Polytechnique in Paris France, from 1920 to 1926, during which time he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1920 and to colonel in 1926. Always somewhat of a rebel, Prince Higashikuni&#x27;s behavior in Paris scandalized the Imperial Court. He had a French mistress, enjoyed fast cars and high living. He left his wife and children in Japan, and the death of his second son did not prompt his return. In 1926, the Imperial Household Ministry dispatched a chamberlain to Paris to collect him.

Upon his return to Japan, he was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Headquarters. Promoted to major-general in August 1930 and appointed commander of the 5th Infantry Brigade (1930–1934), he was promoted to lieutenant-general in August 1934 and given command of the IJA 4th Division (1934–1937). After the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, he headed the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (1937–1938), and the IJA 2nd Army stationed in China from 1938–1939. He was promoted to general in August 1939.

According to a memo discovered by historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi, Prince Higashikuni authorized the use of poison gas against the Chinese on 16 August 1938. Prince Higashikuni encouraged and enabled human experiments, providing advice, money, men and equipment. He personally witnessed human experiments conducted by the military physicians during his tours in Manchukuo.

On 13 May 1939 the Imperial General Headquarters authorized the use of poison gas to Japanese Northern China Area Army (大陸指第四百五十二号). Only riot control agents were used till then. Prince Higashikuni moved to the post at home dated 4 January 1939. Promoted to full general, the prince was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite, 1st Class in 1940.

Before Japan entered the Second World War, on 15 October 1941, outgoing Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe proposed Prince Higashikuni to Emperor Shōwa as his successor for prime minister. Konoe believed that only a member of the Imperial Family with a distinguished military background could restrain the pro-war faction led by Generals Hajime Sugiyama, Hideki Tōjō, and Akira Mutō. Prince Higashikuni was also the choice of both Chief of Staffs of the Army and the Navy.

However, both Emperor Shōwa and the Lord Privy Seal, Kido Kōichi, believed that it would be inappropriate for a member of the Imperial Family to serve in that position, as he could be blamed for anything which went wrong in the war. Thus, two days later, the Emperor chose army minister General Hideki Tōjō as prime minister. In 1946, he explained this decision: &quot;I actually thought Prince Higashikuni suitable as Chief of Staff of the Army; but I think the appointment of a member of the Imperial house to a political office must be considered very carefully. Above all, in time of peace this is fine, but when there is a fear that there may even be a war, then more importantly, considering the welfare of the imperial house, I wonder about the wisdom of a member of the Imperial family serving [as prime minister].&quot;

Six weeks later, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. During the early stages of the Pacific War, Prince Higashikuni served as commander of the General Defense Command from 1941 to 1944.

Prince Higashikuni remained steadfast in his opposition to the war with the Allied powers, and was part of the conspiracy (with Prince Yasuhiko Asaka, Prince Nobuhito Takamatsu, and former prime minister Konoe) which finally ousted Tōjō in July 1944 following the fall of Saipan to American forces. The American researchers with SCAP also found out that he had planned towards the end of the war to depose Emperor Shōwa, placing the Crown Prince Akihito on the throne instead, governing the country with himself as regent.

==Prime Minister==

After the course of the war turned against Japan, and the decision was made to accept the Potsdam Declaration, the Emperor Shōwa appointed Prince Higashikuni to the prime minister on 17 August 1945, replacing navy Admiral Kantarō Suzuki. The mission of the Higashikuni Cabinet was twofold: first, to ensure the orderly cessation of hostilities and demobilization of the Japanese armed forces; and second, to reassure the Japanese people that the imperial institution remained secure. Prince Higashikuni resigned in October over a dispute with the Allied occupation forces over the repeal of the 1925 Peace Preservation Law. This law was largely intended to prevent the spread of Communism to Japan.

==Post-premiership==
On 27 February 1946, Prince Higashikuni gave an interview to the &quot;Yomiuri-Hōchi&quot; newspaper in which he claimed that many members of the imperial family had approved Emperor Shōwa&#x27;s abdication, with Nobuhito, Prince Takamatsu serving as regent until Crown Prince Akihito came of age. In the government, only Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara and the Imperial Household Minister Yoshitami Matsudaira opposed this. On 4 March 1946, Higashikuni gave a similar interview to the &quot;Associated Press&quot; (reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot;) indicating that he had proposed to the Emperor possible dates for abdication.

In 1946, Prince Higashikuni asked the emperor for permission to renounce his membership in the Imperial Family and become a commoner. The emperor denied the request. However, along with other members of the Imperial branch families (&quot;shinnōke&quot; and &quot;ōke&quot;), Prince Higashikuni lost his title and most of his wealth as a result of the American occupation&#x27;s abolition of the princely houses on 17 October 1947.

As a private citizen, Higashikuni operated several unsuccessful retail enterprises (including a provisions store, second-hand goods store, and dressmaker&#x27;s shop). He even created his own new Zen Buddhism-based religious sect, the Higashikuni-kyo, which was subsequently banned by the American occupation authorities.

The former prince became the honorary chairman of the International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF) in 1957, and honorary president of several other organizations.

In 1958, Higashikuni published his wartime journals under the title, &quot;Ichi Kozoku no Senso Nikki&quot; (or &quot;The War Diary of a Member of the Imperial Family&quot;). He published his autobiographical memoirs, &quot;Higashikuni Nikki&quot;, in 1968.

==Death and legacy==
Higashikuni died of heart failure in Tokyo on 20 January 1990 at the age of , having outlived his wife, two of his sons, his siblings, and his nephew, Emperor Shōwa. Higashikuni is today mainly remembered as first postwar prime minister of Japan. He is the shortest-serving prime minister, resigning after eight weeks (54 days) and one of the longest-lived prime ministers of all time, along with Antoine Pinay, Willem Drees and Christopher Hornsrud, and at his death was the last surviving full general of the Imperial Japanese Army. From 14 May 1988, when former Netherlands Prime Minister Willem Drees died, until his own death, Higashikuni was the world&#x27;s oldest living former head of government.
