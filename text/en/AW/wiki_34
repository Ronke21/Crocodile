<text>Lotus Group (also known as Lotus Cars) is a British multinational automotive manufacturer of luxury sports cars and electric vehicles.

Lotus Group is composed of three primary entities. Lotus Cars, a high-performance sports car company, is based in Hethel, Norfolk. Lotus Tech, an all-electric lifestyle vehicle company, headquartered in Wuhan, China, and operates regional facilities in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany. Additionally, Lotus Engineering, an engineering consultancy firm, is headquartered at the Lotus Advanced Technology Centre (LATC) located at the University of Warwick&#x27;s Wellesbourne Campus.

Lotus was founded and owned for many years by Colin Chapman. After his death and a period of financial instability, it was bought by General Motors, then Romano Artioli and then DRB-HICOM through its subsidiary Proton, which owned Lotus from 1996 to 2017. Lotus is currently majority-owned by Chinese multinational Geely. Between 2017 and 2025, Lotus traded as Lotus NYO in China due to a trademark dispute with Youngman.

Lotus was previously involved in Formula One racing, via Team Lotus, winning the Formula One World Championship seven times. Notable Lotus cars include the Lotus Seven, the Elan, the Esprit and the Elise.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
The company was formed in 1952 as Lotus Engineering Ltd. by Colin Chapman but had earlier origins in 1948 when Chapman built his first trials car in a garage. The four letters in the middle of the logo represent Chapman&#x27;s full name, Anthony Colin Bruce Chapman. When the logo was created, Chapman&#x27;s original partners Michael and Nigel Allen were allegedly told that the letters stood for Colin Chapman and the Allen Brothers.

The first factory was situated in old stables behind the Railway Hotel in Hornsey, North London. Team Lotus, which was split from Lotus Engineering in 1954, was active and competitive in Formula One racing from 1958 to 1994. The Lotus Group of Companies was formed in 1959. This was composed of Lotus Cars Limited and Lotus Components Limited, which focused on road cars and customer competition-car production, respectively. Lotus Components Limited became Lotus Racing Limited in 1971, but the newly renamed entity ceased operation that same year.

The company moved to a purpose-built factory at Cheshunt in 1959, and since 1966 it has occupied a modern factory and road test facility at Hethel, near Wymondham in Norfolk. The site is a former World War II airfield, RAF Hethel, and the test track uses sections of the old runway.

In its early days, Lotus sold cars aimed at private racers and trialists. Its early road cars could be bought as kits in order to save on purchase tax. The kit car era ended in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the Lotus Elan Plus Two as the first Lotus road car not offered in kit form, and the Lotus Eclat and Lotus Elite of the mid-1970s were offered only in factory-built versions.

After the Lotus Elite of the 1950s, which featured a complete fibreglass monocoque fitted with built-in steel pickup points for mounting major components, Lotus found critical and sales success in the 1960s with the Lotus Elan. This two-seater was later developed to two-plus-two form (Elan +2S). Lotus was notable for its use of fibreglass bodies, backbone chassis and overhead camshaft engines, initially supplied by Coventry Climax but later replaced by Lotus-Ford units (Ford block, Lotus head and twin-cam valve gear). Lotus also worked with Ford on the Lotus Cortina, a successful sports saloon.

Another Lotus of the late 1960s and early 1970s was the two-seater Lotus Europa, initially intended only for the European market, which paired a backbone chassis and lightweight body with a mid-mounted Renault engine, later upgraded to the Lotus-Ford twin-cam unit as used in the Elan.

The Lotus Seven, originating in the 1950s as a simple, lightweight open two-seater. continued in production into the early 1970s. Lotus sold the rights to produce the Seven to Caterham, which has continued to produce the car since then.

By the mid-1970s, Lotus sought to move upmarket with the launch of the Elite and Eclat models, four-seaters aimed at prosperous buyers, with features such as optional air conditioning and automatic transmissions. The mid-engine line continued with the Lotus Esprit, which became one of the company&#x27;s longest-lived and most iconic models. Lotus developed its own series of four-cylinder DOHC engines, the Lotus 900 series, and later a V8, and turbocharged versions of the engines appeared in the Esprit.

Variants of the 900-series engine were supplied for the Jensen Healey sports car and the Sunbeam Lotus &quot;hot hatchback&quot;. In the 1980s, Lotus collaborated with Vauxhall Motors to produce the Lotus Carlton, the fastest roadgoing Vauxhall car.

===Financial troubles, death of Chapman===
By 1980, Group Lotus was in serious financial trouble. Production had dropped from 1,200 units per year to a mere 383. This situation resulted from the worldwide economic recession combined with the virtual collapse of sales in the American market and limited development of the model range.

In early 1982, Chapman forged an agreement with Toyota to exchange intellectual property and applied expertise. As a result, Lotus Engineering helped develop the Mk2 Toyota Supra, also known as the Toyota Celica XX. The partnership also allowed Lotus to launch the new Lotus Excel to replace the ageing Lotus Eclat. Using drivetrain and other components build by Toyota enabled Lotus to sell the Excel for £1,109 less than the outgoing Eclat.

Looking to reenter the North American market, Chapman was approached by young law professor and investment banking consultant Joe Bianco, who proposed a new and separate American sales company for Lotus. By creating an unprecedented tax-incentivised mechanism by which each investor received a personalised Lotus Turbo Esprit, the new American company, Lotus Performance Cars Inc. (LPCI), was able to provide fresh capital to Group Lotus in the United Kingdom. Former Ferrari North America general manager John Spiech was recruited to run LPCI, which imported the remarkable Giugiaro-designed Turbo Esprit for the first time. American sales began to quickly jump into six figures annually.

Chapman died of a heart attack on 16 December 1982 at the age of 54. At the time, both Chapman and Lotus were linked to the DeLorean Motor Company scandal regarding the use of UK Government subsidies for the production of the DMC DeLorean, for which Lotus had designed the chassis. Chasing large sums of money that had disappeared from the DeLorean company, Lotus was besieged by Inland Revenue inspectors, who imposed an £84 million legal &quot;protective assessment&quot; on the company. At the trial of Lotus accountant Fred Bushell, the judge insisted that had Chapman lived, he would have received a sentence &quot;of at least 10 years.&quot;

With Group Lotus near bankruptcy in 1983, David Wickins, the founder of British Car Auctions, agreed to become the new company chairman through an introduction by his friend Mark Thatcher. Taking a combined 29% BCA/personal stake in Group Lotus, Wickins negotiated with Inland Revenue and recruited new investors: merchant bank Schroeder-Wagg (14%), Michael Ashcroft&#x27;s Bermudian operating company Benor (14%) and Sir Anthony Bamford of JCB (12%). Wickins oversaw a complete turnaround in the company&#x27;s fortunes, for which he was dubbed &quot;the saviour of Lotus.&quot;

===International ownership===

Despite having employed designer Peter Stevens to revamp the range and design two new concept cars, by 1985 the British investors recognised that they lacked the capital to fund production and sought to find a buyer. In January 1986, Wickins oversaw the majority sale of the Group Lotus companies and 100% of North American–based LPCI to General Motors. After four months, Toyota sold GM its stake. By October 1986, GM had acquired a 91% stake in Group Lotus for £22.7 million, which allowed GM to legally force the company buyout.

On 27 August 1993, GM sold the company for £30 million, to A.C.B.N. Holdings S.A. of Luxembourg, a company controlled by Italian businessman Romano Artioli, who also owned Bugatti Automobili SpA. In 1996, a majority share in Lotus was sold to Malaysian car company Proton.

Lotus Cars was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise for contribution to international trade, one of 85 companies receiving the recognition in that category in 2002. Lotus cars wore the badge of the award for several years.

On 24 May 2017, Chinese multinational Geely announced that it was taking a 51% controlling stake in Lotus. The remaining 49% was acquired by Etika Automotive, a holding company of Proton&#x27;s major shareholder Syed Mokhtar Albukhary.

In January 2021, Geely announced a joint venture with Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance and its Alpine division to develop a range of electric performance cars sharing some of their future platforms. In April 2021, Lotus announced plans to produce only electric cars by 2028 and increase production numbers from around 1,500 per annum to tens of thousands. Geely and Etika Automotive provided two billion pounds (US$2.8 billion) to fund the changes.

Lotus Technology, the electric-vehicle division of Lotus. which has a different ownership structure (30% by Etika and the rest by Geely and Nio Capital), was listed on Nasdaq in February 2024, following the completion of a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company affiliated with L Catterton. After the listing, 10.3% of shares are held by the public.

==Operations==
Currently organised as Group Lotus Limited, the business is divided into Lotus Cars and Lotus Engineering.

In addition to manufacturing sportscars, the company also acts as an engineering consultancy, providing engineering development—particularly of suspensions—for other car manufacturers. Lotus&#x27;s powertrain department is responsible for the design and development of the four-cylinder Ecotec engine found in many of GM&#x27;s Vauxhall, Opel, Saab, Chevrolet and Saturn cars. The American Elise and Exige models used the 1.8L VVTL-i I4 from Toyota&#x27;s late Celica GT-S and the Matrix XRS.

Michael Kimberley, who had been a guiding figure at Lotus in the 1970s, returned as acting chief executive officer in May 2006. He chaired the executive committee of Lotus Group International Limited (LGIL), established in February 2006 with Syed Zainal Abidin (managing director of Proton Holdings Berhad) and Badrul Feisal (non-executive director of Proton Holdings Berhad). LGIL is the holding company of Lotus Group Plc.

Kimberley retired as CEO on 17 July 2009, replaced on 1 October 2009 by former Ferrari executive Dany Bahar. Bahar intended to drive the brand into the expanding global luxury-goods sector and away from the company&#x27;s traditional lightweight simplicity and pure driving-experience focus. Bahar was suspended on 25 May 2012 while an investigation into his conduct was undertaken. On 7 June 2012, Lotus announced the termination of Bahar and the appointment of Aslam Farikullah as the new chief operating officer. The ambitious plans for several new models were cancelled following Bahar&#x27;s departure. Jean Marc Gales became CEO in 2014, and in 2017, he enabled the company to achieve its first profit in decades. Gales left the company in June 2018 for personal reasons and was replaced by Feng Qingfeng from Lotus Group&#x27;s parent company, Geely.

October 2018 saw further senior personnel changes as Phil Popham was named CEO of Lotus Cars, with Qingfeng remaining in charge of Group Lotus.

In January 2021, Matt Windle was appointed managing director of Lotus Cars after Phil Popham resigned.

== Formula One and motorsport ==

In its early days, the company encouraged its customers to race its cars, and it first entered Formula One through its sister company Team Lotus in 1958. A Lotus Formula One car driven by Stirling Moss won the marque&#x27;s first Grand Prix in 1960 at Monaco. Moss drove a Lotus 18 entered by privateer Rob Walker. Major success came in 1963 with the Lotus 25, which, with Jim Clark driving, won Team Lotus its first F1 World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Clark was killed in April 1968 when the rear tyre of his Formula Two Lotus 48 failed while making a turn at a race in Hockenheim. His death was a severe blow to the team and to Formula One, as he had been the dominant driver of Lotus&#x27;s early years. That year&#x27;s championship was won by Clark&#x27;s teammate Graham Hill.

Team Lotus is credited with making the mid-engine layout popular for IndyCars, developing the first monocoque Formula One chassis and integrating the engine and transaxle as chassis components. Team Lotus was among the pioneers in Formula One in adding wings and shaping the undersurface of the car to create downforce. It invented active suspension and was the first to move radiators to the sides of the car to improve aerodynamic performance.

Formula One Drivers&#x27; Championship winners for Lotus were Jim Clark in 1963 and 1965, Graham Hill in 1968, Jochen Rindt in 1970, Emerson Fittipaldi in 1972 and Mario Andretti in 1978. In 1973, Lotus won the constructors&#x27; championship only; the drivers&#x27; title went to Jackie Stewart of Tyrrell. Chapman saw Lotus beat Ferrari as the first marque to achieve 50 Grand Prix victories, even though Ferrari had won its first nine years sooner.

Until the late 1980s, Team Lotus continued to be a major player in Formula One. Ayrton Senna drove for the team from 1985 to 1987, winning twice in each year and achieving 17 pole positions.

Team Lotus established Classic Team Lotus in 1992, which continues to maintain Lotus F1 cars and run them in the FIA Historic Formula One Championship. It also preserves the Team Lotus archive and Works Collection of cars, under the management of Colin Chapman&#x27;s son Clive.

Team Lotus&#x27;s participation in Formula One ended after the 1994 season, when the team&#x27;s cars were no longer competitive. Cars constructed by the team won a total of 79 Grand Prix races.

Former racing driver David Hunt (brother of F1 world champion James Hunt) purchased the name Team Lotus and licensed it to the Formula One team Pacific Racing, which was rebranded Pacific Team Lotus. The Pacific Team folded at the end of the 1995 season.

The Lotus name returned to Formula One for the 2010 season, when a new Malaysian team called Lotus Racing was awarded an entry. The new team used the Lotus name under licence from Group Lotus and was unrelated to the original Team Lotus. In September 2010 Group Lotus, with agreement from its parent company Proton, terminated the licence for future seasons as a result of what it called &quot;flagrant and persistent breaches of the licence by the team.&quot; Lotus Racing then announced that it had acquired Team Lotus Ventures Ltd, the company led by David Hunt, and with it full ownership of the rights to the Team Lotus brand and heritage. The team confirmed that it would be known as Team Lotus from 2011 onward.

In December 2010, Group Lotus announced the creation of Lotus Renault GP, the successor to the Renault F1 team. This team contested the 2011 season having purchased a title sponsorship deal with the team, with the option to buy shares in the future. The team&#x27;s car for that season, the R31, was badged as a Renault, while Team Lotus&#x27;s car, the T128, was badged as a Lotus. In May 2011, the British High Court of Justice ruled that Team Lotus could continue to use the Team Lotus name, but Group Lotus had sole right to use the Lotus name. As a consequence, for Lotus Renault GP was rebranded as Lotus F1 Team and its entries were badged as Lotus cars, while Team Lotus was renamed Caterham F1 Team (after the sportscar manufacturer owned by team principal Tony Fernandes) and its cars were badged as Caterhams.

Group Lotus was also involved in several other categories of motorsport. It sponsored the KV team in the IndyCar Series and the ART team in the GP2 and GP3 Series in 2011 and 2012. After fielding underpowered and uncompetitive engines in the 2012 Indianapolis 500, in which drivers Jean Alesi and Simona de Silvestro were black-flagged after ten laps for failing to maintain a competitive pace, Lotus was released from its contract and did not participate in future seasons.

=== Announcements of future cars ===

At the 2010 Paris Motorshow, Lotus announced five new models to be introduced over the next five years: Their intention was to replace the Elise with an entirely different model, as well as to introduce two entirely new sports coupes, which would have been known as the Elite and the Elan, a new sports saloon, the Eterne, to rival the Aston Martin Rapide and Maserati Quattroporte, and a modern interpretation of the Esprit supercar.

It became apparent in July 2012 that the firm&#x27;s financial difficulties had made this plan impossible to implement, and initially all but the Esprit project were cancelled. Subsequently, the Esprit project was also cancelled.

Lotus also showed an unnamed city car concept using its 1.2L range-extender engine.
In 2011, Lotus revealed this as the Lotus Ethos, a plug-in hybrid car based on the EMAS concept from its parent company Proton, and likely to be primarily built by Proton in Malaysia. This car has also been cancelled.

Lotus CEO at the time Jean Marc Gales confirmed in 2017 that development of an SUV is currently under way, after the company was acquired by the Chinese automotive manufacturer, Geely.

In July 2019 Lotus revealed the Evija, a and electric supercar.

** Lotus 918
* Range Extender Engine. This all-aluminium, monoblock, 1200 cc, three-cylinder, 47 horsepower, four-stroke engine is specifically designed to directly drive an alternator for electricity generation for series-hybrid cars. The engine is small and light at , having three cylinders and no detachable cylinder head. The cylinder head and engine block are all one casting to reduce size, weight and production costs. As the engine does not turn belt driven ancillaries such as alternator, power-steering pump or an air conditioning compressor, the block requires no strong points to accommodate such ancillaries, resulting in a simple and light block. The engine has a reduced parts count for lightness and cheaper production.
* On 18 August 2011 Lotus developed an all new in-house designed V8 destined for the new era range of cars. At and just long, the unit is dry sump lubricated to save depth and will feature a 180° flat plane crank. The engine is being utilised as a stressed component, a technique pioneered by Colin Chapman in F1, specifically with the 1967 Type 49. It was expected to be used in the Le Mans LMP2 car in 2012. Expected performance is likely to be in excess of and with a 9,200 rpm redline.
* Lotus Omnivore, research engine and prototype.

== Lotus Engineering ==
Lotus Engineering Limited is an offshoot of Lotus Cars, which provides engineering consultancy to third-party companies primarily in the automotive industry. As well as Hethel in the United Kingdom Lotus has engineering centres in Ann Arbor, USA, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Shanghai, China. In 2000, Lotus Engineering, Inc. was established with an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

=== APX and VVA===

The APX (also known as the &quot;Aluminium Performance Crossover&quot;) is an aluminium concept vehicle revealed at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show built on Lotus Engineering&#x27;s Versatile Vehicle Architecture (VVA).

Whereas the VVA technology was to be used in the development of a new mid-engine sportscar for Lotus cars, the APX is, in fact, a high-performance 7-seat MPV with four-wheel drive and a front-mounted V6 engine from Lotus Engineering&#x27;s Powertrain division. The engine was designed and developed to be available in a 2.2-litre naturally aspirated and 3.0-litre supercharged variations. An electric version was also shown in the 2007 NADA show.

Versatile Vehicle Architecture (VVA) is an effort by the Lotus car manufacturing company to reduce the investment needed for producing unique, niche-market cars by sharing a number of common components.

Cars produced using VVA:
* Lotus APX

=== Projects undertaken by Lotus Engineering ===


Examples of work undertaken by Lotus Engineering include:

* Lotus Talbot Sunbeam—Talbot&#x27;s hot hatch rally car of the early 1980s
* DMC DeLorean. Changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures. The car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer Colin Chapman, founder of Lotus. Lotus replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus in the Lotus Esprit

<text>Vance Oakley Packard (May 22, 1914 – December 12, 1996) was an American journalist and social critic. He was the author of several books, including &quot;The Hidden Persuaders&quot; and &quot;The Naked Society&quot;. He was a critic of consumerism.

==Early life==
Vance Packard was born on May 22, 1914, in Granville Summit, Pennsylvania, to Philip J. Packard and Mabel Case Packard. Between 1920 and 1932, he attended local public schools in State College, Pennsylvania, where his father managed a dairy farm owned by the Pennsylvania State College (later Penn State University). He identified himself as a &quot;farm boy&quot; throughout his life, although he moved to State College and in later life lived in affluent areas. In 1932, he entered Pennsylvania State University, where he earned a B.A. degree, majoring in English. He graduated in 1936, and worked briefly for the local newspaper, the &quot;Centre Daily Times&quot;. He earned his master&#x27;s degree at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1937.

==Career==
Packard joined the &quot;Boston Daily Record&quot; as a staff reporter in 1937. He became a reporter for the Associated Press around 1940, and in 1942, joined the staff of &quot;The American Magazine&quot; as a section editor, later becoming a staff writer. That periodical closed in July, 1956, and Packard became a writer at &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. After its closing by the end of the year, he devoted his full attention to developing book-length projects of his own. Halfway into the next year, his &quot;The Hidden Persuaders&quot; was published to national attention, launching him into a career as a full-time social critic, lecturing and developing further books. He was a critic of consumerism, which he viewed as an attack on the traditional American way of life.

In July 2020, an academic description reported on the nature and rise of the &quot;robot prosumer&quot;, derived from modern-day technology and related participatory culture, that, in turn, had been predicted substantially by science fiction writers, as well as Packard.

===&quot;The Hidden Persuaders&quot;===
In &quot;The Hidden Persuaders&quot;, first published in 1957, Packard explored advertisers&#x27; use of consumer motivational research and other psychological techniques, including depth psychology and subliminal tactics, to manipulate expectations and induce desire for products, particularly in the American postwar era. He identified eight &quot;compelling needs&quot; that advertisers promise products will fulfill (Emotional Security, Reassurance of worth, Ego gratification, Creative outlets, Love objects, Sense of power, Roots, Immortality).

According to Packard, these needs are so strong that people are compelled to buy products merely to satisfy those needs. The book also explores the manipulative techniques of promoting politicians to the electorate. Additionally, the book questions the morality of using these techniques.

While the book was a top-seller among middle-class audiences, it was widely criticised by marketing researchers and advertising executives as carrying a sensationalist tone and containing unsubstantiated assertions.

=== &quot;The Naked Society&quot; ===

In his 1964 book called &quot;The Naked Society&quot;, Packard criticized advertisers&#x27; unfettered use of private information to create marketing schemes. He compared a recent Great Society initiative by then-president Lyndon B. Johnson, the National Data Bank, to the use of information by advertisers and argued for increased data privacy measures to ensure that information did not find its way into the wrong hands. The essay led Congress to create the Special Subcommittee on the Invasion of Privacy and inspired privacy advocates such as Neil Gallagher and Sam Ervin to fight Johnson&#x27;s flagrant disregard for consumer privacy.

==Personal life and death==
Packard was married to Virginia Matthews; they had two sons and a daughter. They resided in New Canaan, Connecticut and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. He died in 1996 at the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Hospital.

<text>Old Friends from Young Years is the debut studio album by American rock band Papa Roach, self-produced and released on February 4, 1997. This album, along with their other independent demos, were released on the band&#x27;s now defunct indie label, Onion Hardcore, so named because onion farming is a staple of Papa Roach&#x27;s hometown, Vacaville, California. The album was co-produced by bassist Tobin Esperance&#x27;s father, who included an audio recording of Tobin as a child as a bonus track on the album.

==Fan club edition==
In 2005, Papa Roach re-released the album exclusively to new members to their fan club, &quot;P-Roach Riot!&quot;. The fan club edition had a new cover and included a sticker and an official membership card to the fan club. The first 2,000 copies were signed by all four members of the band. The tracks &quot;Thanx&quot; and &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; are excluded from the re-release. The track &quot;Grrbrr&quot; is not listed on the back cover, but the song is on the CD. There is a hidden track at the end of the album, the rock demo of &quot;Tightrope&quot;, previously only available on the EP &quot;Let &#x27;Em Know&quot;.

<text>The year 1996 involved many significant films. The major releases this year included &quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Fargo&quot;, &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, &quot;The Rock&quot;, &quot;The English Patient&quot;, &quot;Twister&quot;, &quot;Space Jam&quot;, &quot;,&quot; &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; and a film version of the musical &quot;Evita&quot;.

==Highest-grossing films==

The top 10 films released in 1996 by worldwide gross are as follows:

===Box office records===
* &quot;Independence Day&quot; became the highest-grossing film of Will Smith&#x27;s career, up until it was surpassed by &quot;Aladdin&quot; (2019) which grossed $1.054 billion. However, adjusting for inflation, Independence Day in 2019 grossed $1.324 billion. 
* &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot; was released in North America, becoming Jackie Chan&#x27;s first major box office hit in the region, with its US box office alone earning over 20 times its budget. It was Chan&#x27;s biggest ever hit up until then.

=== Context ===
The theatrical year of 1996 achieved a $5.8 billion domestic gross milestone and saw a record twelve films earning over $100 million by the end of December, with &quot;Independence Day&quot; earning over $300 million. However, the film industry experienced a surplus of releases between 1995 and 1996 that resulted in several box office flops, studio bankruptcies and sales, and otherwise successful films struggling to turn in a profit. The average cost of producing and marketing film rose to $60 million, a 20% increase from the previous year, with a contributing factor being the record high-salaries for stars such as Sylvester Stallone, Tom Cruise, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson, Jim Carrey, Harrison Ford, Michael Douglas, Sharon Stone, Julia Roberts, and Demi Moore that became the subject of industry scrutiny following several high profile flops that were released in between 1995 and 1996. This resulted in studios having to cut their film slate by fifty percent to offset growing production and marketing costs and ensure more profits.

==Events==
* June 19 – &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; has one of the largest premieres for a motion picture, taking place at the Superdome in New Orleans, with an audience of 65,000 people, as well as free admission. The film received generally positive reviews, and was a commercial success in box-office revenue.
* July 10 – Nickelodeon releases its first feature film, &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot;, a spy-comedy-drama film based on the 1964 novel of the same name. It also launches the career of then-child actress Michelle Trachtenberg.
* Mid-July – Production begins on &quot;Titanic&quot;.
* September 20 – 75-year-old English actor Sir Dirk Bogarde has a severe stroke. He continued to need a wheelchair until his death in 1999.
* December 20 - &quot;Scream&quot; is released to a surprised commercial success. Hailed as a influential landmark in the horror genre, it revitalized the declining slasher genre by satirizing the subgenre with characters that are well-versed in its clichés. &quot;Scream&quot;’s success lead to studios capitalizing especially on marketing horror films towards the teenage and young adult demographic.

<doc id="169570" wikidata="Q547430" url="?curid=169570" title="Sierpiński number">
<text>In number theory, a Sierpiński number is an odd natural number &quot;k&quot; such that formula_1 is composite for all natural numbers &quot;n&quot;. In 1960, Wacław Sierpiński proved that there are infinitely many odd integers &quot;k&quot; which have this property.

In other words, when &quot;k&quot; is a Sierpiński number, all members of the following set are composite:

:formula_2

If the form is instead formula_3, then &quot;k&quot; is a Riesel number.

==Known Sierpiński numbers==
The sequence of currently &quot;known&quot; Sierpiński numbers begins with:
: 78557, 271129, 271577, 322523, 327739, 482719, 575041, 603713, 903983, 934909, 965431, 1259779, 1290677, 1518781, 1624097, 1639459, 1777613, 2131043, 2131099, 2191531, 2510177, 2541601, 2576089, 2931767, 2931991, ... .

The number 78557 was proved to be a Sierpiński number by John Selfridge in 1962, who showed that all numbers of the form have a factor in the covering set }. For another known Sierpiński number, 271129, the covering set is }. Most currently known Sierpiński numbers possess similar covering sets.

However, in 1995 A. S. Izotov showed that some fourth powers could be proved to be Sierpiński numbers without establishing a covering set for all values of &quot;n&quot;. His proof depends on the aurifeuillean factorization . This establishes that all give rise to a composite, and so it remains to eliminate only using a covering set.

==Sierpiński problem==

The Sierpiński problem asks for the value of the smallest Sierpiński number. In private correspondence with Paul Erdős, Selfridge conjectured that 78,557 was the smallest Sierpiński number. No smaller Sierpiński numbers have been discovered, and it is now believed that 78,557 is the smallest number.

To show that 78,557 really is the smallest Sierpiński number, one must show that all the odd numbers smaller than 78,557 are &quot;not&quot; Sierpiński numbers. That is, for every odd &quot;k&quot; below 78,557, there needs to exist a positive integer &quot;n&quot; such that is prime. The distributed volunteer computing project PrimeGrid is attempting to eliminate all the remaining values of &quot;k&quot;:

: &quot;k&quot; = 21181, 22699, 24737, 55459, and 67607.

==Prime Sierpiński problem==

In 1976, Nathan Mendelsohn determined that the second provable Sierpiński number is the prime &quot;k&quot; = 271129. The prime Sierpiński problem asks for the value of the smallest &quot;prime&quot; Sierpiński number, and there is an ongoing &quot;Prime Sierpiński search&quot; which tries to prove that 271129 is the first Sierpiński number which is also a prime.

==Extended Sierpiński problem==

Suppose that both preceding Sierpiński problems had finally been solved, showing that 78557 is the smallest Sierpiński number and that 271129 is the smallest prime Sierpiński number. This still leaves unsolved the question of the &quot;second&quot; Sierpinski number; there could exist a composite Sierpiński number &quot;k&quot; such that formula_4. An ongoing search is trying to prove that 271129 is the second Sierpiński number, by testing all &quot;k&quot; values between 78557 and 271129, prime or not.

==Simultaneously Sierpiński and Riesel==
A number that is both Sierpiński and Riesel is a Brier number (after Éric Brier). The smallest five known examples are 3316923598096294713661, 10439679896374780276373, 11615103277955704975673, 12607110588854501953787, and 17855036657007596110949 ().

<text>Many significant films were released in 1998, including
&quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;,&quot; Armageddon&quot;, &quot;American History X&quot;, &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, &quot;Primary Colors&quot;, &quot;&quot;Rushmore&quot;&quot;, &quot;Rush Hour&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, and Terrence Malick&#x27;s directorial return in &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;.

==Highest-grossing films==

The top 10 films released in 1998 by worldwide gross are as follows:

=== Box office records ===

* &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; grossed $482 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing World War II film until it was surpassed by &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017). However, adjusting for 2017 monetary inflation, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; grossed $718 million.
* &quot;Blade&quot; became the top-grossing film based on a Marvel Comics character, grossing $131.2 million worldwide at the time of its release.
*The &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise became the seventh film franchise to gross $1 billion with the release of &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;.

== Events ==

* March 1 – &quot;Titanic&quot; becomes the first film to gross over $1 billion at the worldwide box office. Twenty days later, the film won 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. 
* May 8 and July 1 – 1998 saw the release of two dueling science-fiction disaster films about asteroids: &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Deep Impact&quot;, both of which became box office successes. &quot;Armageddon&quot; became the most popular of the two and was also the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide.
* July 24 – &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg, was released and received critical acclaim, leading it to be the top- grossing domestic film of 1998. Saving Private Ryan won five Academy Awards, including Best Director. The film was lauded as an influential landmark in the war and action film genres, primarily due to its use of desaturated colors, hand-held cameras, and tight angles.
* August 21 – &quot;Blade&quot;, based on the character of the same name, grossed over $131.2 million worldwide. Its success would help stage future film adaptations of Marvel Comics.
* September 19 – &quot;Antz&quot;, DreamWorks&#x27; first animated feature film, premiered at the 23rd Toronto International Film Festival.
* December 25 - Filmmaker Terrence Malick returned after a 20-year hiatus, with &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;.

<text>Lovehatetragedy is the third overall and second major label studio album by the American rock band Papa Roach. It was released on June 18, 2002.

==Background==
A re-recorded version of the song &quot;M-80 (Explosive Energy Movement)&quot; was featured in the game &quot;Amplitude&quot;. The song &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot; was featured in the game NHL 2003. The songs &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot; and &quot;Walking Thru Barbed Wire&quot; were recorded in 1999, with the former appearing on the band&#x27;s 1999 demo and the latter on the &quot;...Let &#x27;Em Know!&quot; EP. 

In comparison to their prior album, &quot;Infest&quot;, the band aimed to incorporate less rapping, and more singing in &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot;. &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot; is Papa Roach&#x27;s last album under DreamWorks Records, before signing to Geffen in 2003. Alongside with &quot;Infest&quot;, a debut vinyl edition of the album was released on September 8, 2017.

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 by selling approximatively 136,000 copies in its first week, behind Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;. &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot; was mostly well received by music critics, gaining an average score of 75 on Metacritic.

Papa Roach toured on the second edition of the Anger Management Tour during the summer of 2002. They co-headlined with Eminem, who was also supported by Ludacris, Xzibit, X-Ecutioners, Bionic Jive during the tour. It was the last edition of Anger Management that had rock music being prominently featured, with Papa Roach&#x27;s set occurring between Eminem and Ludacris&#x27;s while Bionic Jive opened the concerts during the first half of the tour.

It achieved a gold certification in the U.S for exceeding 500,000 copies sold in the first two months. Despite peaking at higher positions on most international charts, &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot; failed to catch the success of &quot;Infest&quot; both in lifetime sales and chartrun (15 weeks within the Billboard 200). It was also certified Gold in Canada, Switzerland and in the UK

<doc id="169588" wikidata="Q315348" url="?curid=169588" title="Carl Andre">
<text>Carl Andre (September 16, 1935 – January 24, 2024) was an American minimalist artist recognized for his ordered linear and grid format sculptures. His sculptures range from large public artworks (such as &quot;Stone Field Sculpture&quot;, 1977, in Hartford, Connecticut, and &quot;Lament for the Children&quot;, 1976, in Long Island City, New York), to large interior works exhibited on the floor (such as &#x27;, 1969), to small intimate works (such as&#x27;, 1989, and &quot;7 Alnico Pole&quot;, 2011).

In 1985 his third wife, contemporary artist Ana Mendieta, fell from their 34th-floor apartment window and died. Neighbors heard an argument and Mendieta shouting &quot;no&quot; immediately before the fall. He was acquitted of a second-degree murder charge in a 1988 bench trial, causing uproar among feminists in the art world; supporters of Mendieta have protested at his subsequent exhibitions.

== Early life ==
Andre was born on September 16, 1935, in Quincy, Massachusetts, the youngest of the three children of George (a master designer of freshwater plumbing for ships) and Margaret (Johnson) Andre. He completed primary and secondary schooling in the Quincy public school system and studied art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, from 1951 to 1953. While at Phillips Academy, he became friends with Hollis Frampton, who would later influence Andre&#x27;s radical approach to sculpture through their conversations about art and through introductions to other artists.

Andre served in the U.S. Army in North Carolina from 1955 to 1956, and moved to New York City in 1956. While in New York, Frampton introduced Andre to Constantin Brâncuși, through whom Andre became re-acquainted with a former classmate from Phillips Academy, Frank Stella, in 1958. Andre shared studio space with Stella from 1958 through 1960.

== Work ==
=== Early work ===
Andre cited Brâncuși as an inspiration for his early wood sculptures, but his conversations with Stella about space and form led him in a different direction. While sharing a studio with Stella, Andre developed a series of wooden &quot;cut&quot; sculptures (such as &quot;Radial Arm Saw cut sculpture&quot;, 1959 and &quot;Maple Spindle Exercise&quot;, 1959). Stella is noted as having said to Andre (regarding hunks of wood removed from Andre&#x27;s sculpture), &quot;Carl, that&#x27;s sculpture, too.&quot;

From 1960 to 1964, Andre worked as a freight brakeman and conductor in New Jersey for the Pennsylvania Railroad. His experience with blue collar labor and the ordered nature of conducting freight trains would later influence Andre&#x27;s sculpture and artistic personality. For example, it was not uncommon for Andre to dress in overalls and a blue work shirt, even to the most formal occasions.&quot;

During this period, Andre focused mainly on writing, and there is little notable sculpture of his on record between 1960 and 1965. His poetry resurfaced later, most notably in a book published in 1980 by NYU Press called &quot;12 Dialogues&quot;, in which Andre and Hollis Frampton took turns responding to one another at a typewriter using mainly poetry and free-form essay-like texts. Andre&#x27;s concrete poetry has been exhibited in the United States and Europe, a comprehensive collection of which is in the collection of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.

=== Mature work ===

In 1965, Andre had his first public exhibition of his work in the &quot;Shape and Structure&quot; show curated by Henry Geldzahler at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery.

In the late 1960s, entrepreneur Karl Ströher from Darmstadt, Germany, acquired three major works from Andre to give them on loan to the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt. Peter Iden then acquired these works for the Museum für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt in 1981. The works have since been shown in various &quot;Change of Scene&quot; exhibitions (1992–2002) at the museum in Frankfurt and internationally.

In 1969, Andre helped organize the Art Workers Coalition.

In 1970, he had a solo exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.

=== &quot;Equivalent VIII&quot; ===

In 1972, Britain&#x27;s Tate Gallery acquired Andre&#x27;s &quot;Equivalent VIII&quot;, an arrangement of 120 firebricks.

The piece was exhibited several times without incident, but became the center of controversy in 1976 after being featured in an article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and later being defaced with blue food dye. The &quot;Bricks controversy&quot; became one of the most famous public debates in Britain about contemporary art.

=== &quot;Lever&quot; ===

Andre&#x27;s &quot;Lever&quot; consists of a single line of 137 firebricks. The work concisely divides a space as the bricks hug the floor. The exhibition of &quot;Lever&quot; at the 1966 exhibition Primary Structures at the Jewish Museum in New York brought considerable recognition to Carl Andre.

== Criticism ==
The gradual evolution of consensus about the meaning of Andre&#x27;s art was compiled in the book &quot;About Carl Andre: Critical Texts Since 1965&quot;, published by Ridinghouse in 2008. The most significant essays and exhibition reviews were collated into this volume, including texts written by some of the most influential art historians and critics: Clement Greenberg, Donald Kuspit, Lucy R. Lippard, Robert C. Morgan, Barbara Rose and Roberta Smith.

== Personal life ==
Andre&#x27;s first two marriages ended in divorce, and the third in the alleged murder of his wife, for which he was acquitted under controversial and contested circumstances. In 1999 he married artist Melissa Kretschmer.

Andre died in Manhattan on January 24, 2024, at the age of 88.

=== Death of Ana Mendieta ===

In 1979 he met his third wife, artist Ana Mendieta, through a mutual friendship with artists Leon Golub and Nancy Spero at AIR Gallery in New York City. Andre and Mendieta married in January 1985. Mendieta fell to her death from Andre&#x27;s 34th-story apartment window in September 1985, after an argument with Andre. Their neighbors, a couple next door, are reported to have heard Mendieta scream &quot;No&quot; the same night, and Andre was also seen with multiple scratches on his face after that night. Andre was quoted from a 9-1-1 call after her death to have said, &quot;What happened was we had … my wife is an artist and I am an artist and we had a quarrel about the fact that I was more, eh, exposed to the public than she was and she went to the bedroom and I went after her and she went out of the window&quot;. The same night Andre was charged with second-degree murder. He elected to be tried before a judge with no jury. In 1988, he was acquitted of all charges related to Mendieta&#x27;s death.

Museums that exhibit Andre&#x27;s work have been met with outrage from Mendieta&#x27;s supporters. The 2022 podcast &quot;Death of an Artist&quot; detailed a culture of secrecy around Mendieta&#x27;s death and Andre&#x27;s potential involvement.

<text>In mathematics, the terms continuity, continuous, and continuum are used in a variety of related ways.

== Continuity of functions and measures ==

* Continuous function
* Absolutely continuous function
* Absolute continuity of a measure with respect to another measure
* Continuous probability distribution: Sometimes this term is used to mean a probability distribution whose cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) is (simply) continuous. Sometimes it has a less inclusive meaning: a distribution whose c.d.f. is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. This less inclusive sense is equivalent to the condition that every set whose Lebesgue measure is 0 has probability 0.
* Geometric continuity
* Parametric continuity

== Continuum ==

* Continuum (set theory), the real line or the corresponding cardinal number
* Linear continuum, any ordered set that shares certain properties of the real line
* Continuum (topology), a nonempty compact connected metric space (sometimes a Hausdorff space)
* Continuum hypothesis, a conjecture of Georg Cantor that there is no cardinal number between that of countably infinite sets and the cardinality of the set of all real numbers. The latter cardinality is equal to the cardinality of the set of all subsets of a countably infinite set.
* Cardinality of the continuum, a cardinal number that represents the size of the set of real numbers

<doc id="169592" wikidata="Q233806" url="?curid=169592" title="Peggy Guggenheim">
<text>Marguerite &quot;Peggy&quot; Guggenheim ( ; August 26, 1898 – December 23, 1979) was an American art collector, bohemian, and socialite. Born to the wealthy New York City Guggenheim family, she was the daughter of Benjamin Guggenheim, who went down with the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912, and the niece of Solomon R. Guggenheim, who established the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Guggenheim collected art in Europe and America between 1938 and 1946. She exhibited this collection as she built it. In 1949, she settled in Venice, where she lived and exhibited her collection for the rest of her life. The Peggy Guggenheim Collection is a modern art museum on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy, and is one of the most visited attractions in the city.

== Early life ==
Guggenheim&#x27;s parents were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Her mother, Florette Seligman (1870–1937), was a member of the Seligman family. When she turned 21 in 1919, Guggenheim inherited US$2.5 million, equivalent to US$ million in . Guggenheim&#x27;s father, Benjamin Guggenheim, a member of the Guggenheim family, who died in the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, had not amassed a fortune comparable to his siblings; therefore her inheritance was far less than that of her cousins. She had a sister, Barbara Hazel Guggenheim, who became a painter and art collector.

She first worked as a clerk in an avant-garde bookstore, the Sunwise Turn, in Midtown Manhattan, where she became enamored of the members of the bohemian artistic community. In 1920, she went to live in Paris. Once there, she became friendly with avant-garde writers and artists, many of whom were living in poverty in the Montparnasse quarter of the city. Man Ray photographed her, and was, along with Constantin Brâncuși and Marcel Duchamp, a friend whose art she was eventually to promote.

She became close friends with writer Natalie Barney and artist Romaine Brooks and was a regular at Barney&#x27;s salon. She met Djuna Barnes during this time and in time, became her friend and patron. Barnes wrote her best-known novel, &quot;Nightwood&quot;, while staying at the Devon country house, Hayford Hall, that Guggenheim had rented for two summers.

Guggenheim urged Emma Goldman to write her autobiography and helped to secure funds for her to live in Saint-Tropez, France, while writing her two volume &quot;Living My Life&quot;. Guggenheim wrote her autobiography entitled &quot;Out of This Century&quot;, later revised and re-published as &quot;Confessions of an Art Addict&quot; that was released in 1946 and is now published by Harper Collins.

== Collecting, before World War II ==

In January 1938, Guggenheim opened a gallery for modern art in London featuring Jean Cocteau drawings in its first show, and she began to collect works of art. Guggenheim often purchased at least one object from each of her exhibitions at the gallery. After the outbreak of World War II, she purchased as much abstract and Surrealist art as possible.

Her first gallery was entitled &quot;Guggenheim Jeune&quot;, the name ingeniously chosen to associate her gallery with both the epitome of a gallery, the French Bernheim-Jeune, and bearing the name of her own well-known family. The gallery on 30 Cork Street, next to Roland Penrose&#x27;s and E. L. T. Mesens&#x27; show-case for the Surrealist movement, proved to be successful, thanks to many friends who gave advice and who helped to run the gallery. Marcel Duchamp, whom she had known since the early 1920s when she lived in Paris with her first husband Laurence Vail, had introduced Guggenheim to the art world; it was through him that she met many artists during her frequent visits to Paris. He taught her about contemporary art and styles and he conceived several of the exhibitions held at &quot;Guggenheim Jeune&quot;.

The Cocteau exhibition was followed by exhibitions of Wassily Kandinsky (his first solo exhibition in England), Yves Tanguy, Wolfgang Paalen, several other well-known artists, and some lesser-known artists. Peggy Guggenheim held group exhibitions of sculpture and collage, with the participation of the now-classic moderns Antoine Pevsner, Henry Moore, Henri Laurens, Alexander Calder, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Constantin Brâncuși, John Ferren, Jean Arp, Max Ernst, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Kurt Schwitters. She also greatly admired the work of John Tunnard (1900–1971) and is credited with his discovery in mainstream international modernism.

== Plans for a museum ==
When Guggenheim realized that her gallery, although well received, had suffered a loss of £600 in the first year, she decided to spend her money in a more practical way. A museum for contemporary arts was exactly the institution she could envision supporting. Most certainly influencing her were the adventures in Manhattan of her uncle, Solomon R. Guggenheim, who, with the help and encouragement of artist Baroness Hilla von Rebay, had created the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation two years earlier. The main aim of that foundation had been to collect and to further the production of abstract art, resulting in the opening of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting (known after 1952 as the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) during 1939. Guggenheim closed &quot;Guggenheim Jeune&quot; with a farewell party on 22 June 1939, at which colour portrait photographs by Gisèle Freund were projected onto the walls. Together with the English art historian and art critic Herbert Read, she started making plans for a Museum of Modern Art in London. She set aside $40,000 for its operating expenses, however, these funds were soon overstretched by the ambitions of the organizers.

In August 1939, Guggenheim left for Paris to negotiate loans of artworks for the first exhibition. In her luggage was a list drawn up by Herbert Read for this occasion. Shortly after her departure the Second World War broke out, and the events following 1 September 1939 made her abandon the scheme, willingly or not. She then &quot;decided now to buy paintings by all the painters who were on Herbert Read&#x27;s list. Having plenty of time and all the museum&#x27;s funds at my disposal, I put myself on a regime to buy one picture a day.&quot; When finished, she had acquired ten Picassos, forty Ernsts, eight Mirós, four Magrittes, four Ferrens, three Man Rays, three Dalís, one Klee, one Wolfgang Paalen, and one Chagall, among others. In the meantime, she had made new plans and, in April 1940, had rented a large space in the Place Vendôme as a new home for her museum.

Guggenheim had to abandon her plans for a Paris museum a few days before the Germans reached Paris and she fled to the south of France, from where, after months of safeguarding her collection and artist friends, she left Europe for Manhattan in the summer of 1941. There, in the following year, she opened a new gallery—which was partially a museum—at 30 West 57th Street. It was entitled The Art of This Century. Three of its four galleries were dedicated to Cubist and Abstract art, Surrealism, and Kinetic art, with only the fourth, the front room, being a commercial gallery. Guggenheim held other important shows — such as the Exhibition by 31 Women, the first documented all-women art exhibition in the United States of America — at the gallery. This 1943 month-long exhibition gathered together artists ranging from notable figures such as Frida Kahlo, Gypsy Rose Lee, Meret Oppenheim, Leonora Carrington, and Louise Nevelson, to others who were unknown artists in New York. In 2023, art collector Jenna Segal curated The 31 Women Collection, based on the 1943 exhibition. Taking place at Segal&#x27;s office, the same location as Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s Art of This Century Gallery, the exhibition lasted for 31 hours spread out during May 15 to May 21. Aiming to &quot;sharpie women into history&quot;, Segal set out to collect works by every artist shown in the original exhibition so that their art could be shared with the world. As of May 2023, 143 works by 30 of the 31 women have been acquired. At the 2023 exhibition, one work per artist was displayed to the public.

Guggenheim&#x27;s interest in contemporary art was instrumental in advancing the careers of several important modern artists, including the American painters Jackson Pollock and William Congdon, the Austrian surrealist Wolfgang Paalen, the sound poet Ada Verdun Howell, and the German painter Max Ernst, whom she married in December 1941. She had assembled her collection in only seven years.

== Collection, after World War II ==

Following World War II and her 1946 divorce from Max Ernst, she closed The Art of This Century Gallery in 1947 and returned to Europe, deciding to live in Venice, Italy. In 1948, she was invited to exhibit her collection in the disused Greek Pavilion of the Venice Biennale. In 1949, she established her collection in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni (&#x27;unfinished palazzo of the lions&#x27;) on the Grand Canal.

Her collection became one of the few European collections of modern art to promote a significant number of works by Americans. She became acquainted with painter and sculptor Edward Melcarth, a fellow American hailing from Louisville, Kentucky. Melcarth, known for his figurative paintings and eroticized depictions of the male body, designed Peggy a pair of hand-sculpted bat sunglasses, rising in ranks amongst Guggenheim’s Tanguy earrings and Calder jewelry as the late collector’s signature accessory. In the 1950s she promoted the art of two local painters, Edmondo Bacci and Tancredi Parmeggiani. By the early 1960s, Guggenheim had almost stopped collecting art and began to concentrate on presenting what she owned. She loaned out her collection to museums in Europe and in 1969 to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, which was named after her uncle. Eventually, she decided to donate her home and her collection to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, a gift that was concluded &quot;inter vivos&quot; in 1976, before her death in 1979.

The Peggy Guggenheim Collection is one of the most important museums in Italy for European and American art of the first half of the twentieth century. Works in her collection embrace Cubism, Surrealism, and abstract expressionism.

Guggenheim lived in Venice until her death in Camposampiero near Padua, Italy, following a stroke. Her ashes are interred next to her dogs in the garden of her home, the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni. Later it was renamed as the Nasher Sculpture Garden in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.

== Personal life ==
According to both Guggenheim and her biographer Anton Gill, while she was living in Europe, she &quot;slept with 1,000 men.&quot; She claimed to have had affairs with numerous artists and writers, and many artists and others have claimed to have had affairs with her. When asked by conductor Thomas Schippers how many husbands she had had, she replied, &quot;You mean my own, or other people&#x27;s?&quot; In her autobiography, Peggy provided the names of some of those lovers, including Yves Tanguy, Roland Penrose, and E. L. T. Mesens.

Her first marriage was to Laurence Vail, a Dada sculptor and writer, with whom she had two children, Michael Cedric Sindbad Vail (1923–1986) and Pegeen Vail Guggenheim (1925–1967). They divorced circa 1928, following his affair with writer Kay Boyle, whom he later married. Soon after her first marriage dissolved, she had an affair with John Ferrar Holms, a war hero and writer, who struggled with writer&#x27;s block . She then lived with the writer and Communist activist Douglas Garman for several years. Starting in December 1939, she and Samuel Beckett had a brief, but intense affair, and he encouraged her to turn exclusively to modern art. She married her second husband, artist Max Ernst, in 1941 and divorced him in 1946. Among her eight grandchildren is Karole Vail, who was appointed director of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in 2017.

== In popular culture ==
* Guggenheim was portrayed by Amy Madigan in the movie &quot;Pollock&quot; (2000), directed by and starring Ed Harris, based on the life of Jackson Pollock.
* A play by Lanie Robertson based on Guggenheim&#x27;s life, &quot;Woman Before a Glass&quot;, opened at the Promenade Theatre on Broadway, New York on March 10, 2005. This one-woman show focuses on Guggenheim&#x27;s later life. Mercedes Ruehl played Guggenheim and received an Obie Award for her performance. In May 2011, the Abingdon Theater Arts Complex in New York featured a revival of the play, starring veteran stage actress Judy Rosenblatt, directed by Austin Pendleton.
* In Bethan Roberts&#x27; first play for radio, &quot;My Own Private Gondolier&quot;, Guggenheim&#x27;s troubled daughter, Pegeen, leaves her three children behind when she travels to Venice to spend the summer with her mother. The play was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on October 19, 2010; Guggenheim was played by Fiona Shaw; Pegeen was played by Hattie Morahan.
* In April 2015, a new documentary film, &quot;Peggy Guggenheim: Art Addict&quot;, began premiering at film festivals, including the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival on July 26, 2015.
* Guggenheim was portrayed by Jodhi May in the 2023 Netflix television series&quot; Transatlantic. &quot;
* &quot;Peggy: A Novel&quot; by Rebecca Godfrey with Leslie Jamison was published in 2024.

<text>Body Count is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1990. The group is fronted by Ice-T, who first established himself as a rapper but co-founded the group with lead guitarist Ernie C out of their interest in heavy metal music. Ice-T took on the role of vocalist and writing the lyrics for most of Body Count&#x27;s songs, while Ernie C has been responsible for writing the group&#x27;s music.

Body Count&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released on Sire Records in 1992, and garnered much attention due to a controversy around the song &quot;Cop Killer&quot;. Their label, Sire Records, and their parent company, Warner Bros. Records, defended the song; however Ice-T chose to remove it from the album because he felt that the controversy had eclipsed the music itself. The group left Sire the following year, and they have since released seven more albums.

Three out of the band&#x27;s original seven members are deceased: D-Roc died from lymphoma, Beatmaster V from leukemia, and Mooseman in a drive-by shooting. Body Count&#x27;s current lineup includes vocalist Ice-T, guitarists Ernie C and Juan Garcia, bassist Vincent Price, drummer Will &quot;Ill Will&quot; Dorsey Jr., and backing vocalists Sean E Sean and Little Ice (Ice-T&#x27;s son).

The band received its second Grammy nomination and later won the award at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2021 for Best Metal Performance with their song &quot;Bum Rush&quot; from the album &quot;Carnivore&quot;.

==History==
===Pre-formation (1990–1991)===
Ice-T&#x27;s interest in heavy metal stemmed from sharing a room with his cousin Earl, who was a fan of rock music and only listened to the local rock stations. Ice-T particularly enjoyed heavy metal, citing Edgar Winter, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath as his favorite bands. Ice-T attended Crenshaw High School, where a few classmates shared his interest in the genre, including musicians Ernie C, D-Roc the Executioner, Beatmaster V, and Mooseman. Ice-T began a solo career as a rapper, and later decided to form Body Count with these friends.

The earliest formation of Body Count was in 1989 when Ice-T had Ernie C, Mooseman, and Beatmaster V participated in live instrumentation on Ice-T&#x27;s album The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say!. They did live instrumentation on the tracks The Girl Tried To Kill Me, Hit The Deck, and What Ya Wanna Do?

Ice-T co-wrote the band&#x27;s music and lyrics with lead guitarist Ernie C, and took on the duties of lead vocalist, even though he felt that he did not have a great singing voice. The original line-up consisted of D-Roc on rhythm guitar, Beatmaster V on drums and Mooseman on bass.

===Touring and debut album (1991–1992) ===
Ice-T introduced the band at Lollapalooza in 1991, devoting half of his set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative music fans and middle-class teenagers. Some considered the Body Count performances to be the highlight of the tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T&#x27;s 1991 solo album &quot;O.G. Original Gangster&quot;. The song, &quot;Body Count&quot;, was preceded by a spoken introduction in which Ice-T responds to allegations that he had &quot;sold out&quot; by incorporating rock elements into his rap albums by pointing out that rock music originated with African-American artists such as Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little Richard, in addition to stating that &quot;as far as I&#x27;m concerned, music is music. I don&#x27;t look at it as rock, R&amp;B, or all that kind of stuff. I just look at it as music. [...] I do what I like and I happen to like rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, and I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music&quot;.

Body Count&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released on Sire/Warner Bros. Records on March 31, 1992. On the strength of the album, Body Count toured internationally, developing a strong following. 

===Controversy over the song Cop Killer (1992)===
The song &quot;Cop Killer&quot;, intended to criticize corrupt police officers, encountered controversy, as it was seen as an attack against the entire police force. According to Ice-T, &quot;I thought I was safe. I thought within the world of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, you could be free to write what you want. Hell, I was listening to Talking Heads singin&#x27; &#x27;Psycho Killer&#x27;. Fuck it, I&#x27;ll make &#x27;Cop Killer&#x27;! But, that was the cross of metal with something that was real. Now we&#x27;re not just killing your family, we&#x27;re killing somebody so real that everybody just went, &#x27;oh shit&#x27;&quot;.

The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas launched a campaign to force Warner Bros. Records to withdraw the album. Within a week, they were joined by police organizations across the United States. Some critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence. Many defended the song on the basis of the group&#x27;s right to freedom of speech. In &quot;The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck&quot;, Ice-T wrote that &quot;The people who did have a platform were way off backing me on the First Amendment. That&#x27;s not where all the anger should have been directed. The anger should have been generated back at the police. [...] Because people jumped on the wrong issue they were able to drive this thing totally through Warner Brothers.&quot;

Over the next month, controversy against the band grew. Vice President Dan Quayle branded &quot;Cop Killer&quot; as being &quot;obscene&quot;, and President George H.W. Bush publicly denounced any record company that would release such a product. At a Time-Warner shareholders&#x27; meeting, actor Charlton Heston stood and read lyrics from the song &quot;KKK Bitch&quot; to an astonished audience and demanded that the company take action. The criticism escalated to the point where death threats were sent to Time-Warner executives, and shareholders threatened to pull out of the company. Finally, Ice-T decided to remove &quot;Cop Killer&quot; from the album of his own volition. In an interview, Ice-T stated that &quot;I didn&#x27;t want my band to get pigeon-holed as that&#x27;s the only reason that record sold. It just got outta hand and I was just tired of hearing it. I said, &#x27;fuck it,&#x27; I mean they&#x27;re saying we did it for money, and we didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d gave the record away, ya know, let&#x27;s move on, let&#x27;s get back to real issues, not a record but the cops that are out there killing people.&quot;

&quot;Cop Killer&quot; was replaced by a new version of &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot;, a song from Ice-T&#x27;s 1989 solo album &quot;The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say!&quot;. The song was re-edited and remixed to give it a more rock-oriented sound. Ice-T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over the Ice-T solo album &quot;Home Invasion&quot;, taking Body Count with him. Despite the controversy, the album received some praise, including A− reviews from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, who later ranked the album among their list of &quot;The 40 Best Albums of 1992&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that the album had sold 480,000 copies by January 29, 1993.

===Continued albums: &quot;Born Dead&quot;, &quot;Violent Demise&quot; and &quot;Murder 4 Hire&quot; (1993–2008)===

In 1993, Body Count recorded a cover of &quot;Hey Joe&quot; for the Jimi Hendrix tribute album &quot;Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix&quot;. The band released their second album, &quot;Born Dead&quot; in 1994 on Virgin Records. Prior to the recording of Body Count&#x27;s third album &quot;Violent Demise: The Last Days&quot; (1997), bassist Mooseman left the group and was replaced by Griz. Drummer Beatmaster V died of leukemia soon after the album was completed, and a new drummer named O.T. filled in the position. Bassist Griz left the band later on, and in the meanwhile, former bassist Mooseman was shot in a drive-by shooting in February 2001 after recording an album and preparing for another tour with Iggy Pop in his band the Trolls. In late 2004, rhythm guitarist D-Roc died due to complications from lymphoma, leaving only Ice-T and Ernie C from the original line-up.

Ice-T has stated that &quot;For me, honestly, after something like that, you can either come to a dead stop or you can go on. [...] It was so emotional. We were in the middle of making a new record together and he goes and dies? It was like, &#x27;damn!&#x27; Soon enough, though, everybody was like, &#x27;c&#x27;mon c&#x27;mon you gotta do it.&#x27; It was make-or-break. The key essence of Body Count is it&#x27;s a band made up of friends. It&#x27;s not about going out and hiring the best drummer or the best guitarist. If we don&#x27;t know you, you can&#x27;t be in the band.&quot;

In July 2006, Body Count released their fourth album, &quot;Murder 4 Hire&quot; on the indie record label Escapi Music. Its album cover, featuring Uncle Sam holding a cardboard sign reading &quot;Will Kill for Money&quot;, compares the United States military to contract killers. The then-line-up included drummer O.T., bassist Vincent Price and rhythm guitarist Bendrix. The band then took an extended hiatus for a couple of years; in regards to the future of Body Count, Ernie C stated, &quot;We will carry on the band. I don&#x27;t know if it will be Body Count, but in some form, Ice and I will always play together.&quot;

===Hiatus, &quot;Gears of War 3&quot; soundtrack (2009–2012)===
The band&#x27;s presence between after 2009 was sporadic: On September 6, 2009, Body Count made an appearance at the Vans Warped Tour 15th-anniversary party at Club Nokia in downtown Los Angeles. The group played a 20-minute set, covered Slayer, and closed with their controversial classic &quot;Cop Killer&quot;. Also on the bill were NOFX, Katy Perry, Pennywise, Bad Religion and Rise Against. Mike Sullivan of ExploreMusic caught up with Ernie C at the 2010 edition of the Vans Warped Tour. While briefly chatting, Ernie C divulged that the band was recording its fifth studio album. Body Count wrote an exclusive song, &quot;The Gears of War&quot;, for the video game &quot;Gears of War 3&quot;, and performed it at a party promoting the game.

===Resurgence: &quot;Manslaughter&quot;, &quot;Bloodlust&quot;, &quot;Carnivore&quot; and &quot;Merciless&quot; (2013–present)===

On December 9, 2012, Ice-T announced on Twitter that Body Count would begin production on a fifth studio album in January 2013. The following day, Ice-T revealed that Body Count has signed with Sumerian Records. Ice-T suggested that the album was going to be titled &quot;Rise!&quot; or &quot;Manslaughter&quot;. On May 10, 2013, Ice-T announced that work on the fifth studio album had begun and that it would be titled &quot;Manslaughter&quot;. The album was released on June 10, 2014. On May 13, 2014, Ice-T played the song &quot;Talk Shit, Get Shot&quot; as a teaser for the new album.

Their sixth album, titled &quot;Bloodlust&quot;, was released in March 2017 via Century Media Records. On December 28, 2016, Ice-T posted a preview of the first single &quot;No Lives Matter&quot; to Twitter. Guest musicians confirmed to appear on the album are Max Cavalera, Randy Blythe and Dave Mustaine. Upon the release of &quot;Bloodlust&quot;, it was confirmed that Ice T&#x27;s son Tracy Marrow Jr, aka Little Ice, is now a part of the band, performing backing vocals.

In May 2018, Ice-T revealed to &quot;Loudwire&quot; that Body Count would enter the studio around September to start recording tracks for their seventh studio album &quot;Carnivore&quot;. On the meaning of the album title, the rapper said, &quot;It&#x27;s basically: &#x27;Fuck vegans.&#x27; We figure, anything carnivorous pretty much kicks ass. We&#x27;re carnivorous! I&#x27;m not [really] saying &#x27;Fuck vegans.&#x27; Everyone&#x27;s so pussy right now, [so] we&#x27;re carnivores&quot;. The recording sessions began in April 2019. The title track was released as the first single on December 13. The album was released on March 6, 2020.

On June 22, 2021, Body Count announced on their Facebook page that they had started work on their eighth studio album &quot;Merciless&quot;. In 2022, it was ranked by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; as the 46th most anticipated metal release of that year. After several delays, &quot;Merciless&quot; was finally released on November 22, 2024.

==Artistry==
===Lyrics===
Ice-T&#x27;s lyrics focus on reality-based themes, including gang life, because he felt it would be scarier than the fantasy-based horror themes of most heavy metal bands. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Violent Demise: The Last Days&quot;, featured album cover art depicting the hand signs of these gangs. According to Ice-T, &quot;We named the group Body Count because every Sunday night in L.A., I&#x27;d watch the news, and the newscasters would tally up the youths killed in gang homicides that week and then just segue to sports. &#x27;Is that all I am,&#x27; I thought, &#x27;a body count?&#x27;&quot;

When the band&#x27;s debut album was released, Ice-T defined it as being &quot;a rock album with a rap mentality&quot;. Like Ice-T&#x27;s hip hop albums, the group&#x27;s material focused on various social and political issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. Ernie C has stated that &quot;We were just a band that played the songs that we knew how to write. Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like the Beach Boys sing about the beach, we sing about the way we grew up.&quot;

While a good portion of Body Count&#x27;s lyrics are current issues, Ice-T notes that he also considers Body Count &quot;grindhouse&quot;, and that some of the songs are humorous exaggerations of violence; he also expects fans to be able to tell the difference.

===Music===
Body Count&#x27;s musical style derives from the dark, ominous tones of traditional heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath and thrash metal bands such as Slayer, as well as hardcore punk&#x27;s aggressiveness. According to Ernie C, &quot;We wanted to be a big punk band [...] Our first record is almost a punk record.&quot; The presence of a rapper in a heavy metal band has been credited for paving the way for the rise of rap metal and nu metal, even though Ice-T does not rap in most Body Count songs and considers it to solely be a rock band. According to Ernie C, &quot;A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can&#x27;t just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] Ice and I, on the other hand, really loved the music we were doing, and it showed.&quot;

<doc id="169595" wikidata="Q232907" url="?curid=169595" title="Emilíana Torrini">
<text>Emilíana Torrini (born 16 May 1977) is an Icelandic singer and songwriter. Her works include the 2009 single &quot;Jungle Drum&quot; and the 1999 album &quot;Love in the Time of Science&quot;. She performed &quot;Gollum&#x27;s Song&quot; for the 2002 film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;.

==Early life==
Emilíana was born in Iceland, where she grew up in Kópavogur. Her father, Salvatore Torrini, is Italian (from Naples), while her mother, Anna Stella Snorradóttir, is Icelandic. 

Because of name regulations in Iceland when she was born, her father had to change his name to &quot;Davíð Eiríksson&quot;, and she had to use the corresponding patronymic in her full name, Emilíana Davíðsdóttir. A few years later, the name regulations were changed, and she took the surname Torrini. 

At the age of seven, she joined a choir as a soprano, until she went to opera school at the age of 15. After being discovered singing in a restaurant in Iceland by Derek Birkett, the owner of One Little Indian Records, Emilíana was asked to visit London to record a song. She decided to stay in London.

==Career==

Emilíana has been a member of Icelandic artist group GusGus, and contributed vocals to several songs on their debut &quot;Polydistortion&quot; (1997), most notably &quot;Why&quot;. She co-wrote Kylie Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Slow&quot; and &quot;Someday&quot; from her &quot;Body Language&quot; album in 2003. She also produced &quot;Slow&quot; along with Dan Carey; the two were nominated for a Best Dance Recording Grammy Award in 2005 for their work on the track. Prior to these, Emilíana contributed vocals to songs on Thievery Corporation&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; and was credited with composing the songs &quot;Resolution&quot;, &quot;Until The Morning&quot;, and &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gonna Burn Your Eyes&quot; from that album. Also in 2002, she sang vocals on Paul Oakenfold&#x27;s song &quot;Hold Your Hand&quot; taken from his &quot;Bunkka&quot; album.

Her version of Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s 1967 song &quot;White Rabbit&quot; was used in multiple action and fight scenes in the action film &quot;Sucker Punch&quot; directed by Zack Snyder.

On 3 June 2013, she revealed to fans that she would release her new album on 9 September 2013 in the UK. The album was released in Ireland, Iceland, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland on 6 September 2013. The new LP is titled &quot;Tookah&quot;. Emilíana played a number of music festivals in the lead up to the album&#x27;s release in Russia and Budapest.

On 29 July 2013, Emilíana revealed the radio edition of a new track &quot;Speed of Dark&quot;. Three additional tracks were also revealed allowing fans to stream, including &quot;Autumn Sun&quot;, &quot;Animal Games&quot;, and &quot;Tookah&quot;.

Emilíana was featured on Kid Koala&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Music to Draw To: Satellite&quot;, where she sang on seven tracks. In 2024, she said that she had not released any album under her name between 2013 and 2023 due to a disagreement and dissatisfaction with her then label Rough Trade.

<doc id="169596" wikidata="Q277479" url="?curid=169596" title="Leftfield">
<text>Leftfield are a British electronic music group formed in 1989, a duo of Neil Barnes and Paul Daley (the latter formerly of The Rivals and A Man Called Adam). The duo was influential in the evolution of electronic music in the 1990s, with &quot;Mixmag&quot; describing them as &quot;the single most influential production team working in British dance music&quot;. As with many of their contemporaries, such as The Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim, Leftfield are notable for their use of guest vocalists in their works. Among them are Toni Halliday on &quot;Original&quot;, Johnny Rotten on &quot;Open Up&quot;, Djum Djum on &quot;Afro-Left&quot;, Earl 16 and Cheshire Cat on &quot;Release the Pressure&quot;, and Grian Chatten of Fontaines D.C. on &quot;Full Way Round&quot;. The term progressive house was coined to define their style, a fusion of house with dub and reggae.

There was a hiatus in recording and live performances between 2002 and 2010. When Barnes revived Leftfield, Daley declined to be involved, to focus on his solo career. After touring for a few years, Barnes finished writing new material for a third Leftfield album, &quot;Alternative Light Source&quot;, which was released in 2015. In 2022, they released their fourth studio album, &quot;This Is What We Do&quot;.

==Formation==
Neil Barnes&#x27; music career started off as a DJ at The Wag Club while simultaneously playing percussion on a sessional basis. In 1986, he joined the London School of Samba and played the bateria in the 1986 Notting Hill Carnival. Around 1989, inspired by Afrika Bambaataa, Barnes decided to try his hand at electronic music production, the results of which were the tracks &quot;Not Forgotten&quot; and &quot;More Than I Know&quot;, released on Rhythm King Records offshoot label &quot;Outer Rhythm&quot;. For the remixes of these tracks, Barnes called upon Paul Daley, percussion player with A Man Called Adam and formerly a session musician for the Brand New Heavies and Primal Scream, appearing on their &quot;Dixie-Narco EP&quot;. Barnes and Daley had previously worked together as percussionists at The Sandals first club, Violets. Described by Barnes as &quot;[t]he sound of 15 years of frustration coming out in one record&quot;, the piece was termed &quot;Progressive House&quot; by &quot;Mixmag&quot; and held significant prominence in nightclubs from 1991 onwards. As their mutual interest in electronic music became clear the pair decided that they would work instead upon Leftfield, once Barnes had extricated himself from his now troublesome contract with Rhythm King&#x27;s Outer Rhythm subsidiary. The name Leftfield was originally used by Barnes for his first single, with editing/arranging and additional production undertaken by Daley. However, after this, Daley was subsequently involved in remixing &quot;Not Forgotten&quot; and thereafter in the creation of all of Leftfield&#x27;s work until the band split up in 2002.

During this period, in which the band could not release their own music owing to the legal dispute with Rhythm King, the pair undertook remix work for React 2 Rhythm, I.C.P. (Ice Cool Productions), Supereal, Inner City, Sunscreem, Ultra Naté and provided two remixes to David Bowie&#x27;s single &quot;Jump They Say&quot;. Finally, once the problems with their former label had been sorted out, Leftfield were able to unveil their single &quot;Release the Pressure&quot;.

==Albums==
===&quot;Leftism&quot;===
Leftfield&#x27;s first major career break came with the single &quot;Open Up&quot;, a collaboration with John Lydon (of Sex Pistols fame) that was soon followed by their debut album, &quot;Leftism&quot; in 1995, blending dub, breakbeat, and house. It was shortlisted for the 1995 Mercury Music Prize but lost out to Portishead&#x27;s &quot;Dummy&quot;. In a 1998 &quot;Q&quot; magazine poll, readers voted it the eightieth greatest album of all time, while in 2000 &quot;Q&quot; placed it at number 34 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. The album was re-released in 2000 with a bonus disc of remixes, and again in 2017 as a remastered version with eleven completely new remixes.

===&quot;Rhythm and Stealth&quot;===
Their second album, &quot;Rhythm and Stealth&quot; (1999) maintained a similar style, and featured Roots Manuva, Afrika Bambaataa and MC Cheshire Cat from Birmingham. The album was shortlisted for the Mercury Music Prize in 2000 but lost out to Badly Drawn Boy&#x27;s &quot;The Hour of Bewilderbeast&quot;. It reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart. The album featured the song &quot;Phat Planet&quot; which featured on Guinness&#x27; 1999 advert, &quot;Surfer&quot;, and &quot;6/8 War&quot; featured on the Volkswagen Lupo Advert &#x27;Demon Baby&#x27;. The track &quot;Double Flash&quot; featured in the PlayStation software game &quot;Music 2000&quot;. Leftfield split in 2002, with both Barnes and Daley planning to work on separate solo projects.

=== Reformation and &quot;Alternative Light Source&quot; ===
Leftfield headlined &quot;RockNess&quot; in Dores, Scotland in June 2010, &quot;Creamfields&quot; in Cheshire, England in August 2010, and played the final set on the main stage at Ireland&#x27;s three-day festival, Electric Picnic in September. Further headline festival shows were announced in the coming weeks. Leftfield is now represented by Neil Barnes on keyboards and drum programming, with a rotating group of vocalists, MC Cheshire Cat, Adam Wren on engineering and programming and Sebastian &#x27;Bid&#x27; Beresford on drums. Founding member Paul Daley declined to rejoin, focusing on his solo DJ career.

On 25 March 2015, the new single, &quot;Universal Everything&quot;, was premiered on Annie Mac&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show. Shortly afterwards the new album was announced via the Leftfield website and social networks, along with UK tour dates for June 2015.

&quot;Alternative Light Source&quot;, Leftfield&#x27;s first album in 16 years, was released on 8 June 2015 on Infectious Records. On 1 June 2015 the album premiere was streamed live on Twitter, coupled with conversation via hashtag #leftfieldstream.
&quot;Head and Shoulders&quot; features Sleaford Mods on vocals, and its stop-motion and animation hybrid video debuted on Pitchfork on 6 August 2015.

=== &quot;This Is What We Do&quot; ===
A fourth album was declared finished by Barnes via Twitter on 4 February 2022, later revealed to be titled &quot;This Is What We Do&quot;. It was released on 2 December 2022 on Virgin. It debuted at No. 18 on the UK Albums Chart, before dropping out of the Top 100.

==Commercial use of tracks==
The song &quot;Phat Planet&quot; was used in the &quot;Surfer&quot; TV advertisement for Guinness, ranked number one in Channel 4&#x27;s Top 100 Adverts list in 2000. &quot;Phat Planet&quot; was also used in the animated television series &quot;Beast Machines: Transformers&quot;, the simulation racing games &quot;F1 2000&quot; by EA Sports and &quot;Racedriver GRID&quot; by Codemasters. &quot;Swords&quot; was used in an advertisement for the Irish mobile phone service Eircell. In addition, their song &quot;Release the Pressure&quot; was used on advertisements for the O2 mobile phone network at its launch, and the Kerry Group&#x27;s Cheestrings snack in 2006. &quot;A Final Hit&quot; was featured on the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; soundtrack; the b-side &quot;Afro Ride&quot; was also featured on the soundtracks to both &quot;wipE&#x27;out&quot;&quot; and &quot;wipE&#x27;out&quot; 2097&quot; although it did not appear on the album of the first game.

A white label release called &quot;Snakeblood&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of &quot;The Beach&quot; (2000). The song was found to have sampled OMD&#x27;s &quot;Almost&quot; without permission.

The song &quot;Storm 3000&quot; has been used as the theme tune for the BBC television programme &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot;.

==Live performances==
 In June 1996, while the group was playing at Brixton Academy, the sound system caused dust and plaster to fall from the ceiling; subsequently, the group was banned from ever returning to the venue. The ban however was taken by the band as a ban on the sound system and not themselves, which was confirmed when Leftfield returned to Brixton again on Saturday 20 May 2000.

In November and December 2010, Leftfield did a series of dates around the UK and Ireland. Friday 3 December&#x27;s gig saw more plaster fall from Brixton Academy&#x27;s ceiling.

<text>Spooky are a British electronic music production and DJ duo consisting of Duncan Forbes and Charlie May. 

==History==
They debuted with &quot;Gargantuan&quot; in 1993 after signing to Guerilla Records. In 1995 and 1996, they released three EPs (&quot;Clank&quot;, &quot;Stereo&quot; and &quot;Shunt&quot;) on their own Generic Records label, followed quickly in mid-1996 by their second album, &quot;Found Sound&quot;. Two singles from this album were released: &quot;Fingerbobs&quot; and &quot;Bamboo&quot;.

Charlie May collaborated with Sasha on his 1999 &quot;Xpander&quot; EP and 2000&#x27;s &quot;Scorchio&quot;, and in 2002 he co-produced some tracks on Sasha&#x27;s &quot;Airdrawndagger&quot; album. The same year saw the release of &quot;Belong&quot;, the first Spooky single on Deviant Records, which Sasha later used on his mix album &quot;Involver&quot;. A white label single, &quot;Andromeda&quot;, was released in 2003

A single entitled &quot;Strange Addiction&quot; was given a limited release in 2005 on Spooky&#x27;s new self-owned label, spooky.uk.com. &quot;Strange Addiction&quot; featured in a trailer for &quot;The Great Global Warming Swindle&quot; which broadcast on British television channel Channel 4 in March. This was followed in September 2006 with the release of &quot;No Return&quot; as a download and promotional CD. Spooky later bought back the rights to their entire back catalogue from the five record companies that previously owned their music, which had all gone out of business.

<doc id="169599" wikidata="Q613059" url="?curid=169599" title="The Neville Brothers">
<text>The Neville Brothers were an American R&amp;B/soul/funk group, formed in 1976 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

==History==
The group notion started in 1976, when the four brothers of the Neville family, Art (1937–2019), Charles (1938–2018), Aaron (b. 1941), and Cyril (b. 1948) came together to take part in the recording session of the Wild Tchoupitoulas, a Mardi Gras Indian group led by the Nevilles&#x27; uncle, George Landry (&quot;Big Chief Jolly&quot;).

Their debut album &quot;The Neville Brothers&quot; was released in 1978 on Capitol Records.

In 1987, the group released &quot;Uptown&quot; on the EMI label, featuring guests including Branford Marsalis, Keith Richards, and Carlos Santana. The following year saw the release of &quot;Yellow Moon&quot; from A&amp;M Records produced by Daniel Lanois. The track &quot;Healing Chant&quot; from that album won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance at the 1990 Grammy ceremony.

In 1990, the Neville Brothers contributed &quot;In the Still of the Night&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. 

Also in 1990, they appeared on the bill at that year&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival. Due to Art Neville devoting more time to his other act, The Meters, the band kept a low profile in the late 1990s onto the early 2000s. They made a comeback in 2004, however, with the album, &quot;Walkin&#x27; in the Shadow of Life&quot;, on Back Porch Records, their first newly recorded effort in five years.

All brothers except Charles, a Massachusetts resident, had been living in New Orleans, but following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 Cyril and Aaron moved out of the city. Aaron moved to Austin briefly at the invitation on his friend, the late blues club impresario, Clifford Antone. They had not been performing in New Orleans since Katrina hit the city; however, they finally returned to perform there at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival in 2008, being given the closing spot which had been reserved for them for years.

Infrequently, Aaron&#x27;s son Ivan Neville (keyboards) and Art&#x27;s son Ian Neville (electric guitar), both of the band Dumpstaphunk, have played with the Neville Brothers. 

The Neville Brothers appear in performance footage in the 2005 documentary film &quot;Make It Funky!&quot;, which presents a history of New Orleans music and its influence on rhythm and blues, rock and roll, funk and jazz. In the film, they perform &quot;Fire on the Bayou&quot; with guests Ivan and Ian Neville.

The group formally disbanded in 2012 but reunited in 2015 for a farewell concert in New Orleans. Charles Neville died of pancreatic cancer on April 26, 2018, at the age of 79. Art Neville died on July 22, 2019, at the age of 81. A cause of death was not provided.

<doc id="169602" wikidata="Q231259" url="?curid=169602" title="Billy Ray Cyrus">
<text>William Ray Cyrus ( ; born August 25, 1961) is an American singer, songwriter and actor. Having released 16 studio albums and 53 singles since 1992, he is known for his hit single &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot;, which topped the U.S. Hot Country Songs chart and became the first single ever to achieve triple platinum status in Australia. It was also the best-selling single in the same country in 1992. Due to the song&#x27;s music video, the line dance rose in popularity.

A multi-platinum selling artist, Cyrus has scored a total of eight top-ten singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart. His most successful album to date is his debut &quot;Some Gave All&quot;, which has been certified 9× multi-platinum in the United States and is the longest time spent by a debut artist and by a country artist at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (17 consecutive weeks) and most consecutive chart-topping weeks in the SoundScan era.
&quot;Some Gave All&quot; was also the first debut album to enter at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. The album has also sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and is the best-selling debut album of all time for a solo male artist. &quot;Some Gave All&quot; was also the best-selling album of 1992 in the US with 4,832,000 copies. During his career he has released 36 charted singles, of which 17 charted in the top 40.

In 2019, Cyrus earned his first number-one single on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as a featured artist on a remix of Lil Nas X&#x27;s song &quot;Old Town Road&quot;, which spent a record-breaking nineteen consecutive weeks at the top spot (eighteen of them credited to Cyrus). It also spent a record-breaking twenty consecutive weeks (nineteen of them credited to Cyrus) at the top spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Songs. The R&amp;B/Hip-hop record has been broken in May 2023 by SZA&#x27;s &quot;Kill Bill&quot;.
Thanks to &quot;Old Town Road&quot;, Cyrus won his first two Grammy Awards, in the categories Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Music Video.

From 2001 to 2004, Cyrus starred in the television show &quot;Doc&quot;. The show was about a country doctor who moved from Montana to New York City. From 2006 to 2011, he starred as Robby Ray Stewart in the Disney Channel series &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; with his daughter Miley Cyrus playing the title character. From 2016 to 2017, he starred as Vernon Brownmule on the CMT sitcom &quot;Still the King&quot;.

==Early life==
Billy Ray Cyrus was born on August 25, 1961, in Flatwoods, Kentucky, to Ron Cyrus, a steelworker who became a politician, and his wife, the former Ruth Ann Casto. Cyrus started singing at the age of four. His parents divorced in 1966. His grandfather was a Pentecostal preacher. Growing up he was surrounded by bluegrass and gospel music as his family are musicians. His right-handed father played guitar, however left-handed Cyrus tried to play his father&#x27;s guitar, but could not. He attended Georgetown College on a baseball scholarship before changing to music. He dropped out of Georgetown during his junior year, realized he wanted to become a musician after attending a Neil Diamond concert, and set a 10-month goal to start a career. In the 1980s, he played in a band called Sly Dog, before signing a record contract with Mercury Nashville Records. Sly Dog was named after a one-eyed dog that Cyrus owned.

==Music career==
===The Mercury Records years===
While trying to get a recording contract in Los Angeles, Cyrus suffered many hardships including living in his neighbor&#x27;s car. However, in 1990, he was signed to PolyGram/Mercury. In the same year he opened for Reba McEntire. Cyrus began to record and write music for his debut album, released in 1992.

&quot;Some Gave All&quot; was released in 1992. The album became an instant chart and sales success. It debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums, &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Canadian Country Albums chart, Canadian Albums Chart, and on the charts of several other countries. The album featured four consecutive top 40 singles on the Hot Country Songs chart from 1992 to 1993, including an album cut, the title track. The most successful single released was &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot;. It reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart and was also a hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it reached No. 4. Uniquely for a country music song it also became an international success, reaching number 1 in Australia and number 3 on the UK Singles Chart. Thanks to the video of this hit, there was the explosion of the line dance into the mainstream, becoming a global craze. Additionally, the singles &quot;Could&#x27;ve Been Me&quot; reached No. 2, &quot;Wher&#x27;m I Gonna Live?&quot; reached No. 23, and &quot;She&#x27;s Not Cryin&#x27; Anymore&quot; reached No. 6. &quot;Some Gave All&quot; was certified 9× multi-platinum in the United States in 1996, and has sold over 20 million copies worldwide.

In 1993, Cyrus and Mercury Records quickly released Cyrus&#x27; second studio album, &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be the Last&quot;. The album featured four singles, three of which made the top 40. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Country charts, and No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. By the end of the year, &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be the Last&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA. The highest-charting single, the lead-off single, &quot;In the Heart of a Woman&quot;, charted to No. 3, with &quot;Somebody New&quot; charting to No. 9, &quot;Words By Heart&quot; at No. 12, and &quot;Talk Some&quot; at No. 63. Also in 1993, Cyrus appeared on Dolly Parton&#x27;s single &quot;Romeo&quot;; though the single only reached 27 on the country singles charts, the accompanying video was popular on CMT.

Cyrus&#x27; third studio album, &quot;Storm in the Heartland&quot;, was released in 1994. It was the final album he recorded for PolyGram, which closed its doors in 1995. The album was not as successful as its predecessors. It only reached No. 11 on the Country albums chart, and only the title track made the top 40 of the Country singles chart. &quot;Deja Blue&quot; was the second single released; however, it only managed to chart to No. 66, and the third and final single, &quot;One Last Thrill&quot;, failed to chart at all.

The album managed to be certified gold in the U.S. Before Cyrus started on his next album, he was transferred to Mercury Nashville.

Also in 1994, Cyrus contributed the song &quot;Pictures Don&#x27;t Lie&quot; to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Cyrus&#x27; most critically acclaimed album was 1996&#x27;s &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; for Mercury Records. The album debuted at No. 20 on the Country chart. Only two songs made the cut to radio, neither of which hit the top 40. The title track and &quot;Three Little Words&quot; reached No. 69 and No. 65 respectively. The album failed to reach any certification, and was off the charts after only four weeks.

In 1998, Cyrus released his last album for Mercury Records &quot;Shot Full of Love&quot;. The album became his lowest-peaking album, debuting at No. 32. The first single, &quot;Under the Hood&quot;, failed to chart, &quot;Time for Letting Go&quot; hit No. 70, &quot;Busy Man&quot; charted No. 3, and &quot;I Give My Heart to You&quot; reached No. 41. After the single fell from the charts, Cyrus left Mercury and signed with Monument Records in 1999.

His debut album for Monument, &quot;Southern Rain&quot;, was released in 2000. It debuted at No. 13 on the Country albums chart and No. 102 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Five singles were released and all five charted. The lead-off single, &quot;You Won&#x27;t Be Lonely Now&quot;, was the highest-peaking single from the album, charting to No. 17. Other singles include &quot;We the People&quot; (No. 60), &quot;Burn Down the Trailer Park&quot; (No. 43), &quot;Crazy &#x27;Bout You Baby&quot; (No. 58), and the title track (No. 45).

===Shift to Christian music===
After the singles from &quot;Southern Rain&quot; finished their chart runs, Cyrus recorded two Christian albums. Both albums, &quot;Time Flies&quot; and &quot;The Other Side&quot;, were released in 2003. The first album debuted and peaked at a low No. 56 on the Country album charts. Three singles were released; however, only the final single reached the charts. &quot;Bread Alone&quot;, &quot;What Else Is There&quot;, and &quot;Back to Memphis&quot; were released, and &quot;Back to Memphis&quot; charted to No. 60.

The second Christian album, &quot;The Other Side&quot;, was recorded while Cyrus filmed his PAX series, &quot;Doc&quot;. It debuted at No. 5 on the Top Christian Albums chart, No. 18 Top Country Albums, and No. 131 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Two of three singles charted – &quot;Face of God&quot; (No. 54) and &quot;The Other Side&quot; (No. 45) – while &quot;Always Sixteen&quot; did not chart.

===Disney Entertainment===
The album &quot;Wanna Be Your Joe&quot; was Billy Ray&#x27;s first country album since 2000&#x27;s &quot;Southern Rain&quot;. It was again recorded on a new record label: New Door/UMe Records. It was released while Cyrus was filming the show &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;. &quot;Wanna Be Your Joe&quot; made it to No. 24 on the Country charts and No. 113 on the all-genre charts. The album initially sold well, but no hit-single was released. The title track was released as the first single, and was followed by &quot;I Want My Mullet Back&quot;, both of which were ignored by country radio. Although not released as a single, a music video was made for the track &quot;Stand&quot;, a duet with daughter Miley Cyrus.

Also in 2006, Billy Ray appeared with metal-rock group Metal Skool (now Steel Panther), and performed several songs including &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; by Billy Idol, and the song &quot;I Want My Mullet Back&quot;, which appears on &quot;Wanna Be Your Joe&quot;.

He also sang &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; at Game 5 of the 2006 World Series in St. Louis, Missouri.

===Career re-launch===
In mid-2007, Cyrus was a celebrity contestant on the 4th season of the show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Cyrus was partnered with Karina Smirnoff. He quickly became a fan favorite. Cyrus and Smirnoff made it to the semi-finals, where they finished in 5th place.

From Cyrus&#x27;s exposure on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;, his record label pushed up the release date by a month for his new album. &quot;Home at Last&quot; was released in July 2007 on Walt Disney Records. It debuted at No. 3 on the country charts, making it Cyrus&#x27; first top 5 entry since 1993. Beginning sales for the album were very strong; however, the album failed to be certified. The single &quot;Ready, Set, Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, was initially released as a solo single. The solo version made it to No. 33 on the Hot Country Songs chart.

In October 2007, Cyrus and his daughter Miley performed a duet of the song on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. The duet debuted at No. 27 on the Country charts and eventually peaked at No. 4 in 2008, giving Billy Ray his first top 5 single since 1999, as well as Miley&#x27;s first top 5 on any &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

Cyrus was a part of the Disney collection &quot;Country Sings Disney&quot; in 2008. Two of his songs, &quot;Ready, Set, Don&#x27;t Go&quot; and the Sheryl Crow-penned song &quot;Real Gone&quot;, appeared on the album. Billy Ray&#x27;s version of &quot;Real Gone&quot; was also made into a music video that is in rotation on both CMT and GAC; the song also appears on &quot;Back to Tennessee&quot;.

=== New label and newfound chart success ===
In late 2008, his website announced that a new studio album would be released by the end of the year from Lyric Street Records, entitled &quot;Back to Tennessee&quot;. The album was originally planned to be released on October 21, 2008, but was pushed back to November 18. When the album was not released, it was announced for a January 13, 2009, release. The first single, &quot;Somebody Said a Prayer&quot;, debuted at No. 53 in August 2008 and reached No. 33 in November of that year. On March 14, 2009, the album&#x27;s title track debuted at No. 59 on the country singles chart and a month later on April 7, &quot;Back to Tennessee&quot; was released. The song only charted to No. 47 after 11 weeks. A third single, &quot;A Good Day&quot;, debuted at No. 60 on the country charts for the chart week of September 5, 2009.

It was less successful in its first week out as &quot;Home at Last&quot;. It only reached No. 13 on the charts and only sold approximately 14,000 copies in its opening week. The album&#x27;s release date coincided with the release of &quot;Hannah Montana: The Movie&quot;. The song &quot;Back to Tennessee&quot; was included on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack, as well as a duet with Miley Cyrus, entitled &quot;Butterfly Fly Away&quot;. The latter song would peak at No. 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and at No. 50 and Canadian Hot 100.

On November 12, 2008, Billy Ray and Miley presented the &quot;Song of the Year&quot; award at the 42nd Annual Country Music Association Awards. Prior to the award show, both Billy Ray and Miley performed on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. In December 2008, Cyrus made a cameo in Metro Station&#x27;s video, &quot;Seventeen Forever&quot;.

Shortly after the chart debut of &quot;Back to Tennessee&quot;&#x27;s third single, &quot;A Good Day&quot;, Cyrus and Lyric Street Records parted ways after only one album.

Cyrus, Phil Vassar, Jeffrey Steele, and John Waite formed a supergroup together in early 2009 called Brother Clyde. On Twitter Cyrus confirmed he was in a supergroup and said they had just cut the first single for their new album, &quot;Lately&quot;.

On June 30, 2010, Cyrus said about the new alternative rock group Brother Clyde that the old members would be substituted by Samantha Maloney, Jamie Miller, Dan Knight, and Dave Henning. Also, he said that their single, &quot;Lately&quot;, was available on iTunes and that their debut album would be out on August 10, 2010.

=== Post-Brother Clyde, &quot;Old Town Road&quot; remix and popular resurgence ===
In late 2010, Cyrus suspended his activities in the band Brother Clyde, and announced the release of his new solo patriotic album, entitled &quot;I&#x27;m American&quot;. Initially scheduled to be released in November 2010, it was pushed back to a May 24, 2011, release with a re-recording of &quot;Some Gave All&quot; that featured guest vocals from Darryl Worley, Jamey Johnson and Craig Morgan being released as the lead-off single. However, in April 2011, the single was changed to &quot;Runway Lights&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m American&quot; was released on June 28, 2011. A second single, &quot;Nineteen&quot;, was released in August 2011. The song entered the Hot Country Songs chart for the week of October 8, 2011, where it debuted at number 58, becoming Cyrus&#x27; first charted single since &quot;A Good Day&quot; in 2009.

Cyrus released the album &quot;Change My Mind&quot; on October 23, 2012. Its first single, the title track, was released on September 6.

In April 2017, Cyrus told &quot;Rolling Stone Country&quot; that on his birthday, August 25, he would be known as Cyrus, or &quot;the artist formerly known as Billy Ray&quot;, after legally changing his name. Fans did not like this, but on &quot;Live with Kelly and Ryan&quot; Cyrus said &quot;I&#x27;m here to set the record straight. That&#x27;s the name of the album–&#x27;Cyrus&#x27;. Then, subtitled, &#x27;Set the Record Straight.&#x27;&quot; He assured fans his name would still be Billy Ray.

After &quot;Billboard&quot; removed American rapper Lil Nas X&#x27;s country-rap song &quot;Old Town Road&quot; from their Country chart, Cyrus was featured in the remix. The remix rose to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, unseating the original mix of the song and giving Cyrus his first number one song on the Hot 100. &quot;Old Town Road&quot; spent 19 consecutive weeks (18 of those credited to Cyrus) on the Hot 100, breaking the record as the longest running number one song in history, surpassing the record that was previously set by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men song &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;. The song was nominated for various Grammy Awards, winning Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Music Video. In October 2019, the song received a diamond certification by the RIAA, selling over ten million total units in the United States. It became the fastest song to be awarded diamond certification.

==Acting career==
Cyrus starred in the 1999 independent film &quot;Radical Jack&quot;. He also had a small part in David Lynch&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; as Gene, a pool cleaner who had been having an affair with the wife of Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux). In 2001, Cyrus played the lead role on the PAX (now ION Television) comedy-drama &quot;Doc&quot;, which became the network&#x27;s highest-rated show. In 2005, Cyrus expanded his acting career in a stage production of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; in Toronto, appearing in the role of Frank Butler.

Cyrus&#x27; television credits include &quot;The Nanny&quot;, &quot;Diagnosis Murder&quot;, &quot;Love Boat, The Next Wave&quot;, and TNN&#x27;s &quot;18 Wheels Of Justice&quot;. In 2004, he guest-starred as a limo driver in the episode &quot;The Power of Love&quot; of the Canadian teen drama &quot;&quot;. Cyrus has also been the subject of many television specials that detail his rise to fame and his career. These include two ABC documentaries, &quot;Billy Ray Cyrus: Dreams Come True&quot; and &quot;Billy Ray Cyrus: A Year on the Road&quot;, a VH1 exclusive, as well as the TNN specials &quot;I Give My Heart To You&quot;, and &quot;The Life and Times of Billy Ray Cyrus&quot;. In late 2005, Cyrus and his daughter Miley Cyrus began co-starring in the Disney Channel original television series, &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;, which premiered on March 24, 2006.

In March 2007, Cyrus joined several other celebrities to take part in the fourth season of the US version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He and his partner Karina Smirnoff, were eliminated in the eighth week (May 8, 2007) after having also placed in the &quot;bottom two&quot; the week before.

Cyrus also starred in Jackie Chan&#x27;s movie &quot;The Spy Next Door&quot;. It was shot in Albuquerque, New Mexico and released in January 2010.

Cyrus sits on the advisory board of a conservative group called the Parents Television Council.

In 2010, it was announced that he and his son Trace Cyrus would take part in a new Syfy reality series called &quot;UFO: Unbelievably Freakin&#x27; Obvious&quot;.

Cyrus made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in &quot;Chicago&quot;. He was in the show for a temporary engagement from November 5 to December 23, 2012.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
Cyrus was married to Cindy Smith from 1986 until they divorced in 1991. Cyrus and Smith co-wrote the songs &quot;Wher&#x27;m I Gonna Live?&quot; and &quot;Some Gave All&quot;, both of which were featured on Cyrus&#x27; 1992 debut album &quot;Some Gave All&quot;.

In 1992, Cyrus became the father of two children with different women: a son, Christopher Cody Cyrus, born to waitress Kristin Luckey, and a daughter, Miley Ray Cyrus, born to Leticia &quot;Tish&quot; Finley. Cyrus pledged to Luckey to support her and their child; she raised their son in South Carolina.

On December 28, 1993, while Finley was pregnant with their second child, the couple were secretly married against the advice of Cyrus&#x27; record company. They have three children together, two daughters: Miley Ray Cyrus (born Destiny Hope Cyrus; in 1992) and Noah Lindsey Cyrus (born 2000); and a son, Braison Chance Cyrus (born 1994). He also adopted the two children Finley brought from her previous relationship: daughter Brandi Glenn Cyrus (born 1987), and son Trace Dempsey Cyrus (born Neil Timothy Helson; in 1989). In June 2021, Cyrus became a grandfather for the first time when his son Braison and daughter-in-law Stella (McBride) Cyrus welcomed their first child.

The family lived on a farm in Thompson&#x27;s Station, Tennessee, near Nashville. They moved to Los Angeles for the filming of the Disney Channel original series &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; in which daughter Miley starred. Brandi also had cameos in the series, in the episodes &quot;Yet Another Side of Me&quot; and &quot;Been Here All Along&quot;.

On October 26, 2010, Cyrus filed for divorce in Tennessee, citing irreconcilable differences but in March 2011, Cyrus said he had dropped the divorce proceedings.

On June 13, 2013, Tish filed for divorce after 19 years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences with Cyrus. In July 2013, the couple was reported to be in therapy and dropped the divorce. In 2017, the second divorce case was officially dismissed by the court since the couple failed to appear. In April 2022, Tish filed for divorce a second time, with the divorce papers revealing that they had been separated for more than two years.

In August 2022, Cyrus became engaged to Australian singer Firerose. The two met over a decade prior on the set of &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; and in 2021 released &quot;New Day&quot;, a collaboration featuring Firerose&#x27;s vocals and Cyrus on guitar. They were married on October 10, 2023.

On May 22, 2024, Cyrus filed for divorce from Firerose. The couple cited irreconcilable differences as well as inappropriate marital conduct as the reason for the divorce. Cyrus also asked the court to grant him an outright annulment, claiming the marriage was obtained by fraud. On August 5, 2024, the divorce was finalized.

===Political views===

Although Cyrus&#x27;s song &quot;We the People&quot; was used as a campaign song by Republican George W. Bush in his 2000 presidential campaign, Cyrus was reported as saying that he had been a lifelong Democrat.

On August 8, 2024, Cyrus shared a photo on Instagram showing him next to Republican former President Donald Trump, offering his endorsement to him in the 2024 US Presidential Election. On January 20, 2025, he performed at the presidential inaugural ball, which celebrated the commencement of Trump&#x27;s second term.

<text>The General Post Office (GPO; ) is the former headquarters of — the Irish Post Office. It remains its registered office and the principal post office of Dublin — the capital city of Ireland — and is situated in the centre of O&#x27;Connell Street, the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare. It is one of Ireland&#x27;s most famous buildings, not least because it served as the headquarters of the leaders of the Easter Rising against British rule in Ireland. It was the last great Georgian public building to be erected in the capital.

==Architecture==
The foundation stone of the building, which was designed by Francis Johnston, was laid by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Charles Whitworth, 1st Earl Whitworth, on 12 August 1814, attended by the Post-Masters-General, Charles O&#x27;Neill, 1st Earl O&#x27;Neill and Laurence Parsons, 2nd Earl of Rosse. The structure was completed in the short space of approximately three years at a cost (depending on sources) of between £50,000 and £80,000.

The front elevation is 67.1 metres (220 ft) long. It features a portico (24.4 metres (80 ft) wide) of six fluted Ionic columns, 137.16 centimetres (54 inches) in diameter. The frieze of the entablature is highly enriched. The tympanum of the pediment originally carried the royal arms; following restoration in the 1920s, they were removed. On the acroteria of the pediment are three statues by John Smyth: when facing the building Mercury on the left, with his Caduceus and purse; Fidelity on the right, with a hound at her feet and a key held in her right hand (due to these features it is argued that the statue is in fact of Hecate); and Hibernia in the centre, resting on her spear and holding a harp. The entablature, with the exception of the architrave, is continued along the rest of the front; the frieze, however, is not decorated over the portico. A balustrade surmounts the cornice of the building, which is 15.2 metres (50 ft) from the ground.

With the exception of the portico, which is of Portland stone, the main building is of mountain granite. The elevation has three stories, of which the lower or basement is rusticated. The portico occupies the entire height of the structure.

The GPO Arcade is an art deco style shopping arcade at the rear of the complex, with access from Henry Street and Princes Street North. It was built by the Office of Public Works following the Rising. Local radio station, Millennium 88FM was based here.

==History==
The General Post Office in Ireland was first located in High Street in Dublin moving to Fishamble Street in 1689, to Sycamore Alley in 1709 and then in 1755 to Peter Bardin&#x27;s Chocolate House at Fownes Court on the site where the Commercial Buildings used to be (later the Central Bank building). It was afterwards removed to a larger house opposite the Bank of Ireland building on College Green. On 6 January 1818, the new post office in Sackville Street (now O&#x27;Connell Street) was opened for business.

During the Easter Rising of 1916, the GPO served as the headquarters of the uprising&#x27;s leaders. It was from outside this building on 24 April 1916, that Patrick Pearse read out the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. The building was destroyed by fire in the course of the rebellion, save for the granite facade, and not rebuilt until 1929, by the Irish Free State government. An original copy of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic was displayed in the museum at the GPO. 

The museum was closed at the end of May 2015 and replaced by a new visitor centre to commemorate the 1916 Rising, &quot;GPO Witness History&quot;, in March 2016. The building has remained a symbol of Irish nationalism. In 1935, in commemoration of the Rising, a statue depicting the death of the mythical hero Cúchulainn sculpted by Oliver Sheppard in 1911 was installed at the command post in the centre of the GPO main hall and is now housed in the front of the building. The statue was featured on the Irish ten shilling coin of 1966, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Rising. Despite its significance in the history of Irish independence, ground rent for the GPO continued to be paid to English and American landlords until the 1980s.

The broadcasting studios of 2RN, which later became Radio Éireann, were located at the GPO from 1928 until 1974. Draws for Prize Bonds are held weekly, on Fridays, in the building.

Nelson&#x27;s Pillar was located in the centre of O&#x27;Connell Street adjacent to the GPO, until it was destroyed by Irish republicans in an explosion in 1966. The Spire of Dublin was erected on the site of the Pillar in 2003.

The Hibernia statue was depicted on the obverse of a commemorative 2 euro coin marking the Centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016.

The postal service moved its headquarters from the General Post Office building to new premises at North Wall Quay in Dublin, in June 2023.

<doc id="169609" wikidata="Q1053623" url="?curid=169609" title="Mother Love Bone">
<text>Mother Love Bone was an American rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington in 1988. The band was active from 1988 to 1990. Frontman Andrew Wood&#x27;s charisma and songwriting helped to catapult the group to the top of the burgeoning Seattle music scene at the time. Wood died shortly before the scheduled release of the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Apple,&quot; resulting in the breakup of the band. The album was released a few months later, though many recollections of demos, b-sides, and live performances were released and given to the general public as well.

As well as being influential to grunge, they are also considered early pioneers in the alternative metal genre.

==History==
Mother Love Bone was established in 1987 by ex-Green River members Jeff Ament, Bruce Fairweather and Stone Gossard, ex-Malfunkshun frontman Andrew Wood and ex-Ten Minute Warning and The Living drummer Greg Gilmore. The group was formed in 1987 out of the cover band Lords of the Wasteland which featured Wood, Gossard, Ament and Malfunkshun drummer Regan Hagar. By early 1988 the band had added Fairweather, replaced Hagar with drummer Greg Gilmore and changed its name to Mother Love Bone.

This new line-up quickly set about recording and playing shows and by late 1988 had become one of Seattle&#x27;s more promising bands. Wood&#x27;s exuberant on-stage personality, outlandish clothes and dreamy lyrics helped bring attention to the band. In the 1996 grunge documentary &quot;Hype!&quot; Seattle engineer Jack Endino called Wood &quot;the only stand-up comedian frontman in Seattle&quot;, a reference to Wood&#x27;s playful style of interacting with fans.

In November 1988, the band signed to PolyGram subsidiary Polydor/Stardog and recorded their debut EP. As part of their contract, PolyGram created the Stardog Records imprint exclusively for the band. In March 1989, the group issued its debut EP &quot;Shine&quot;, becoming one of the first of the new crop of Seattle bands to have a release on a major label. The record sold well and rapidly increased the profile of the band. John Book of AllMusic said the &quot;record contributed to the buzz about the Seattle music scene.&quot;

In late 1989 the band entered a studio in Sausalito, California to record its debut album &quot;Apple&quot;. Despite some initial difficulties, the record was on time for its projected March 1990 release. Only days before &quot;Apple&quot; was slated to be released, frontman Andrew Wood, who had a long history with drug problems, overdosed on heroin. Unresponsive and without signs of brain activity, he was in the hospital on life support for two days to allow friends and family to say goodbye. Wood&#x27;s death effectively brought the group to an end. The album would see release later that year on July 19, 1990. Kim Neely of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that the album &quot;succeeds where countless other hard rock albums have failed, capturing the essence of what made Zep immortal – dynamics, kids! – and giving it a unique Nineties spin.&quot;

==Post-Mother Love Bone==
In the months following Wood&#x27;s death, Gossard and Ament were approached by Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell (who had been Wood&#x27;s roommate), and asked if they would be interested in recording a single containing two songs he had written in tribute to Wood. The project turned into an entire album and the group took the name Temple of the Dog, a reference to a line in the Mother Love Bone song &quot;Man of Golden Words&quot;. Eddie Vedder later joined Mike McCready, Dave Krusen, Gossard, and Ament to form Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam subsequently became one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed rock bands of the 1990s.

Fairweather initially remained inactive but later joined Seattle based psychedelic rock band Love Battery, replacing Tommy Simpson on bass in 1992. He played on three of the band&#x27;s albums and numerous tours before leaving the band. In 2006 he resurfaced in The Press Corps, with Garrett Shavlik (The Fluid) and Dan Peters (Mudhoney).

Gilmore&#x27;s profile dropped significantly following Mother Love Bone&#x27;s demise. Between 1992 and 1994, he drummed with the band Chubby Children, reuniting with former bandmates from 1982–1985, Brian Fox and Garth Brandenburg. Out of the band came a handful of shows and unreleased recordings. He also participated in the reunion of his former band Ten Minute Warning in 1998, and was credited with providing &#x27;inspiration&#x27; for the song &quot;Never the Machine Forever&quot; (credited as being written by Kim Thayil) on Soundgarden&#x27;s studio album, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;. The song initially came out of a jam session Thayil had with Gilmore.

In April 2011, Kevin Wood (Andrew Wood&#x27;s brother) teamed up with hard rock band Lace Weeper to record Mother Love Bone&#x27;s &quot;Crown of Thorns&quot; in commemoration of 21 years since Andrew&#x27;s death. The single was released on Kevin&#x27;s Wammybox Records.

==Reunion concerts==
On April 14, 2010, the four surviving members of Mother Love Bone reunited for the first time in 20 years (with friend and fellow Seattle musician Shawn Smith serving as frontman) as part of a sold-out &quot;Brad and Friends&quot; evening at Seattle&#x27;s Showbox. The songs featured were part of the band&#x27;s core repertoire from their early days, including &quot;Stardog Champion&quot;, &quot;Holy Roller&quot;, &quot;Gentle Groove&quot; and a cover of the Argent song &quot;Hold Your Head Up&quot;, a favorite encore from the band&#x27;s early club days around Seattle.

On May 5, 2018, the band again got together and performed 14 songs (including &quot;Hold Your Head Up&quot;) during the event at Seattle’s Neptune Theatre. Local singers Shawn Smith (Pigeonhed) and Ohm Johari (Hell’s Belles) shared singing duties.

<text>Leonard Joseph &quot;Chico&quot; Marx ( ; March 22, 1887October 11, 1961) was an American comedian, actor and pianist. He was the oldest brother in the Marx Brothers comedy troupe, alongside his brothers Arthur (&quot;Harpo&quot;), Julius (&quot;Groucho&quot;), Milton (&quot;Gummo&quot;) and Herbert (&quot;Zeppo&quot;). His persona in the act was that of a charming, uneducated but crafty con artist, seemingly of rural Italian origin, who wore shabby clothes and sported a curly-haired wig and Tyrolean hat. On screen, Chico is often in alliance with Harpo, usually as partners in crime, and is also frequently seen trying to con or outfox Groucho. Leonard was the oldest of the Marx Brothers to live past early childhood, the first-born being Manfred Marx who had died in infancy. In addition to his work as a performer, he played an important role in the management and development of the act in its early years.

==Early years==
Marx was born in Manhattan, New York City, on March 22, 1887. His parents were Sam Marx (called &quot;Frenchie&quot; throughout his life), and his wife, Minnie Schoenberg Marx. Minnie&#x27;s brother was vaudeville comedian Al Shean, best known as one half of Gallagher and Shean. The Marx family was Franco-German Jewish. His father was a native of Alsace who worked as a tailor and his mother was from East Frisia in Germany.

==Stage persona==
Billing himself as Chico (pronounced as &quot;Chicko&quot;), he used an Italian persona for his onstage character. Stereotyped ethnic characters were common with vaudevillians. His questionable Italian ethnicity was specifically referred to twice on film: In their second feature, &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;, he recognizes someone he knows to be a fish peddler from Czechoslovakia impersonating a respected art collector:

In &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, which begins in Italy, his character, Fiorello, claims not to be Italian, eliciting a surprised look from Groucho:

A scene in the film &quot;Go West&quot;, in which Chico attempts to placate an Indian chief of whom Groucho has run afoul, has a line that plays a bit on Chico&#x27;s lack of Italian nationality, but is more or less proper Marxian wordplay:

There are moments, however, where his characters appear to be genuinely Italian; examples include the film &quot;The Big Store&quot;, in which his character Ravelli runs into an old friend he worked with in Naples (after a brief misunderstanding due to his accent), the film &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, in which Chico claims his grandfather sailed with Christopher Columbus, and their very first outing &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot;, where Mr. Hammer (Groucho) asks him if he knew what an auction was, in which he responds &quot;I come from Italy on the Atlantic Auction [Atlantic Ocean]!&quot; Chico&#x27;s character is often assumed to be dim-witted, as he frequently misunderstands words spoken by other characters (particularly Groucho). However, he often gets the better of the same characters by extorting money from them, either by con or blackmail; again, Groucho is his most frequent target.
Chico was a talented pianist. He originally started playing with only his right hand and fake playing with his left, as his teacher did so herself. Although he took lessons, Chico was a largely self-taught pianist. As a young boy, he gained jobs playing piano to earn money for the Marx family. Sometimes Chico even worked playing in two places at the same time. He would acquire the first job with his piano-playing skills, work for a few nights, and then substitute Harpo on one of the jobs. (During their boyhood, Chico and Harpo looked so much alike that they were often mistaken for each other.)
In the brothers&#x27; last film, &quot;Love Happy&quot;, Chico plays a piano and violin duet with &#x27;Mr. Lyons&#x27; (Leon Belasco). Lyons plays some ornate riffs on the violin; Chico comments, &quot;Look-a, Mister Lyons, I know you wanna make a good impression, but please don&#x27;t-a play better than me!&quot;
In a record album about the Marx Brothers, narrator Gary Owens stated that &quot;although Chico&#x27;s technique was limited, his repertoire was not.&quot; The opposite was true of Harpo, who reportedly could play only two tunes on the piano, which typically thwarted Chico&#x27;s scam and resulted in both brothers being fired.
Groucho Marx once said that Chico never practiced the pieces he played. Instead, before performances he soaked his fingers in hot water. He was known for &#x27;shooting&#x27; the keys of the piano. He played passages with his thumb up and index finger straight, like a gun, as part of the act. Other examples of his keyboard flamboyance are found in &quot;Go West&quot; (1940), where he plays the piano by rolling an apple over the keys and &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot; (1946), where he performs a rendition of &quot;The Beer Barrel Polka&quot;.

Chico became the unofficial manager of the Marx Brothers after their mother, Minnie, died in 1929. As manager, he negotiated with the studios to get the brothers a percentage of a film&#x27;s gross receipts—the first deal of its kind in Hollywood which has become common practice today. Furthermore, it was Chico&#x27;s connection with Irving Thalberg, head of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, that led to Thalberg&#x27;s signing the Brothers when they were in a career slump after &quot;Duck Soup&quot; (1933), the last of their films for Paramount.

For a while in the 1930s and 1940s, Chico led a big band. Crooner Mel Tormé began his professional career singing with the Chico Marx Orchestra. Through the 1950s, Chico occasionally appeared on a variety of television anthology shows and some television commercials, most notably with Harpo (and a cameo appearance by Groucho) in &quot;The Incredible Jewelry Robbery&quot;, a pantomime episode of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; in 1959; This was the final appearance of the three Marx Brothers.

===Pronunciation and origin of name===

His nickname (acquired during a card game in Galesburg, Illinois in 1914) was originally spelled &quot;Chicko&quot;. A typesetter accidentally omitted the &#x27;k&#x27;, so his name became &quot;Chico&quot; but the Marxes still pronounced it &quot;Chick-oh&quot;, although others sometimes mistakenly pronounced it &quot;Cheek-oh&quot;. Numerous radio recordings from the 1940s exist in which announcers and fellow actors mispronounce the nickname, but Chico does not correct them. As late as the 1950s, Groucho used the wrong pronunciation for comedic effect. A guest on &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; told the quizmaster she grew up around Chico (California) and Groucho responded, &quot;I grew up around Chico myself. You aren&#x27;t Gummo, are you?&quot; In most interviews, Groucho is heard correctly pronouncing it &quot;Chicko&quot;, as in a Dick Cavett episode with Groucho talking to Dan Rowan.

During Groucho&#x27;s live performance at Carnegie Hall in 1972, he states that his brother got the name Chico because he was a &quot;chicken-chaser&quot; (early 20th century slang for womanizer).

==Gambling==
As well as being a compulsive womanizer, Chico had a lifelong addiction to gambling. His favorite gambling pursuits were card games, horse racing, dog racing, and various sports betting. His addiction cost him millions of dollars by his own account. When an interviewer in the late 1930s asked him how much money he had lost from gambling, he answered, &quot;Find out how much money Harpo&#x27;s got. That&#x27;s how much I&#x27;ve lost.&quot; Chico always bet on longshots and quickly developed a reputation for being a sucker. When out of games, horses and tips, Chico would make bets with strangers on the street whether the number of the next passing car license plate would be odd or even. Gummo Marx, in an interview years after Chico&#x27;s death, said: &quot;Chico&#x27;s favorite people were actors who gambled, producers who gambled, and women who screwed.&quot; In reference to Chico&#x27;s well-known promiscuity, George Jessel quipped, &quot;Chico didn&#x27;t button his fly until he was seventy.&quot;

Chico&#x27;s chronic gambling addiction compelled him to continue working in show business long after his brothers had retired in comfort from their Hollywood income, and in the early 1940s, he found himself playing in the same small, cheap theater halls in which he had begun his career 30 years earlier. The Marx Brothers&#x27; penultimate film, &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot; (1946), was made largely for Chico&#x27;s financial benefit since he had filed for bankruptcy a few years prior. At around this time, the rest of the Marx brothers, finally aware of Chico&#x27;s out-of-control gambling, took full control over his finances; they took all money away from Chico as he earned it and put him on an allowance to curb his constant betting and gambling. Chico stayed on the allowance until his death.

Chico had a reputation as a world-class pinochle player, a game he and Harpo learned from their father. Groucho said Chico would throw away good cards (with the knowledge of spectators) to make the play &quot;more interesting&quot;. Chico&#x27;s last public appearance was in 1960, playing cards on the television show &quot;Championship Bridge&quot;. He and his partner lost the game.

==Personal life==
Chico was married twice. His first marriage was to Betty Karp in 1917. They had a daughter, Maxine (1918–2009). His first marriage was affected by his infidelity, ending in divorce in 1940. He was very close to his daughter Maxine and gave her acting lessons.

Chico&#x27;s second marriage was to Mary De Vithas. They married in 1958, three years before his death.

==Awards and honors==
In the 1974 Academy Awards telecast, Jack Lemmon presented Groucho with an honorary Academy Award to a standing ovation. The award was also for Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo, whom Lemmon mentioned by name. It was one of Groucho&#x27;s last public appearances. &quot;I wish that Harpo and Chico could be here to share with me this great honor,&quot; he said, naming the two deceased brothers (Zeppo was still alive at the time and in the audience). Groucho also praised the late Margaret Dumont as a great straight woman who never understood any of his jokes.

==Death==

Chico died of arteriosclerosis at the age of 74 on October 11, 1961, at his Hollywood home. He was the eldest brother and the first to die. He was survived by his second wife Mary and daughter Maxine (from his first marriage to Betty Karp).

Chico is entombed in the mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Chico&#x27;s brother Gummo is in a crypt across the hall from him.

==Portrayals==

Actor Michael Tucci portrayed Chico alongside Gabe Kaplan as Groucho in the play &quot;&quot; (later released on home video under the title &quot;Gabe Kaplan as Groucho&quot;) originally broadcast on HBO in 1982.

Actors who have portrayed Chico Marx in stage revivals of the Marx Brothers musical plays include Peter Slutsker, Les Marsden and Matt Roper. Frank Lazarus played Chico in a 1990 radio adaptation of &quot;Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel&quot;.

<doc id="169611" wikidata="Q15124" url="?curid=169611" title="South Tyrol">
<text>South Tyrol ( , ; ; ), officially the Autonomous Province of Bolzano – South Tyrol, is an autonomous province in northern Italy. Together with Trentino, South Tyrol forms the autonomous region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. The province is the northernmost of Italy, the second largest with an area of , and has a total population of about 534,000 inhabitants as of 2021. Its capital and largest city is Bolzano.
The province is granted a considerable level of self-government, consisting of a large range of exclusive legislative and executive powers and a fiscal regime that allows it to retain 90% of revenue, while remaining a net contributor to the national budget. As of 2023, South Tyrol is the wealthiest province in Italy and among the wealthiest in the European Union.

In the wider context of the European Union, the province is one of the three members of the Tyrol–South Tyrol–Trentino Euroregion, which corresponds almost exactly to the historical region of Tyrol. The other members are the Austrian federal state Tyrol to the north and east, and the Italian autonomous province of Trento to the south.

According to the 2024 census, 57.6% of the population used German as their first language (standard German in the written form and the South Tyrolean dialect of Austro-Bavarian in the spoken form); 22.6% of the population spoke Italian, mainly in and around the two largest cities (Bolzano and Merano); 3.7% spoke Ladin, a Rhaeto-Romance language; 16.1% of the population (mainly recent immigrants) spoke another native language in addition to Italian and German. Of 116 South Tyrolean municipalities, 102 have a German-speaking, eight a Ladin-speaking, and six an Italian-speaking majority.
The Italianization of South Tyrol and the settlement of Italians from the rest of Italy after 1918 significantly modified local demographics.

== Name ==
&quot;South Tyrol&quot; (occasionally &quot;South Tirol&quot;) is the term most commonly used in English for the province, and its usage reflects that it was created from a portion of the southern part of the historic County of Tyrol, a former state of the Holy Roman Empire and crown land of the Austrian Empire of the Habsburgs. German and Ladin speakers usually refer to the area as &quot;Südtirol&quot;; the Italian equivalent &quot;Sudtirolo&quot; (sometimes parsed &quot;Sud Tirolo&quot;) is becoming increasingly common.

&quot;Alto Adige&quot; (literally translated in English: &quot;Upper Adige&quot;), one of the Italian names for the province, is also used in English. The term had been the name of political subdivisions along the Adige River in the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, who created the Department of Alto Adige, part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. It was reused as the Italian name of the current province after its post-World War I creation, and was a symbol of the subsequent forced Italianization of South Tyrol.

The official name of the province today in German is &quot;Autonome Provinz Bozen — Südtirol&quot;. German speakers usually refer to it not as a &quot;Provinz&quot;, but as a &quot;Land&quot; (like the Länder of Germany and Austria). Provincial institutions are referred to using the prefix &quot;Landes-&quot;, such as &quot;Landesregierung&quot; (state government) and &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot; (governor).
The official name in Italian is &quot;Provincia autonoma Bolzano — Alto Adige&quot;, in Ladin &quot;Provinzia autonoma Bulsan — Südtirol&quot;.

== History ==
=== Annexation by Italy ===
South Tyrol as an administrative entity originated during the First World War. The Allies promised the area to Italy in the Treaty of London of 1915 as an incentive to enter the war on their side. Until 1918, it was part of the Austro-Hungarian princely County of Tyrol, but this almost completely German-speaking territory was occupied by Italy at the end of the war in November 1918 and was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1919. The province as it exists today was created in 1926 after an administrative reorganization of the Kingdom of Italy, and was incorporated together with the province of Trento into the newly created region of &quot;Venezia Tridentina&quot; (&quot;Trentine Venetia&quot;).

With the rise of Italian Fascism, the new regime made efforts to bring forward the Italianization of South Tyrol. The German language was banished from public service, German teaching was officially forbidden, and German newspapers were censored (with the exception of the fascistic &quot;Alpenzeitung&quot;). The regime also favoured immigration from other Italian regions.
The subsequent alliance between Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini declared that South Tyrol would not follow the destiny of Austria, which had been annexed by Nazi Germany. Instead the dictators agreed that the German-speaking population be transferred to German-ruled territory or dispersed around Italy, but the outbreak of the Second World War prevented them from fully carrying out their plans. Every citizen was given the choice to give up their German cultural identity and stay in fascist Italy, or to leave their homeland for Nazi Germany to retain their cultural identity. This resulted in the division of South Tyrolese families.

In this tense relationship for the population, Walter Caldonazzi from Mals was part of the resistance group around the priest Heinrich Maier, which passed plans and information about production facilities for V-1 rockets, V-2 rockets, Tiger tanks, Messerschmitt Bf 109, and Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet and other aircraft to the Allies. The group planned for an independent Austria with a monarchical form of government after the war, which would include Austria, Bavaria and South Tyrol.

In 1943, when the Italian government signed an armistice with the Allies, the region was occupied by Nazi Germany, which reorganised it as the Operation Zone of the Alpine Foothills and put it under the administration of Gauleiter Franz Hofer. The region was &quot;de facto&quot; annexed to the German Reich (with the addition of the province of Belluno) until the end of the war. Italian rule was restored in 1945 as the Nazi regime ended.

=== Gruber–De Gasperi Agreement ===

After the war, the Allies decided that the province would remain a part of Italy, under the condition that the German-speaking population be granted a significant level of self-government. Italy and Austria negotiated an agreement in 1946, recognizing the rights of the German minority. Alcide De Gasperi, Italy&#x27;s prime minister, a native of Trentino, wanted to extend the autonomy to his fellow citizens. This led to the creation of the region called &quot;Trentino-Alto Adige/Tiroler Etschland&quot;. The Gruber–De Gasperi Agreement of September 1946 was signed by the Italian and Austrian Foreign Ministers, creating the autonomous region of Trentino-South Tyrol, consisting of the autonomous provinces of Trentino and South Tyrol. German and Italian were both made official languages, and German-language education was permitted once more. Still Italians were the majority in the combined region.

This, together with the arrival of new Italian-speaking immigrants, led to strong dissatisfaction among South Tyrolese, which culminated in terrorist acts perpetrated by the &quot;Befreiungsausschuss Südtirol&quot; (BAS – Liberation Committee of South Tyrol). In the first phase, only public edifices and fascist monuments were targeted. The second phase was bloodier, costing 21 lives (15 members of Italian security forces, two civilians, and four terrorists).

=== &quot;Südtirolfrage&quot; ===
The South Tyrolean Question (&quot;Südtirolfrage&quot;) became an international issue. As the implementation of the post-war agreement was deemed unsatisfactory by the Austrian government, it became a cause of significant friction with Italy and was taken up by the United Nations in 1960. A fresh round of negotiations took place in 1961 but proved unsuccessful, partly because of the campaign of terrorism.

The issue was resolved in 1971, when a new Austro-Italian treaty was signed and ratified. It stipulated that disputes in South Tyrol would be submitted for settlement to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, that the province would receive greater autonomy within Italy, and that Austria would not interfere in South Tyrol&#x27;s internal affairs. The new agreement proved broadly satisfactory to the parties involved, and the separatist tensions soon eased.

The autonomous status granted in 1972 has resulted in a considerable level of self-government, and also allows the entity to retain almost 90% of all levied taxes.

=== Autonomy ===

In 1992, Italy and Austria officially ended their dispute over the autonomy issue on the basis of the agreement of 1972.

The extensive self-government provided by the current institutional framework has been advanced as a model for settling interethnic disputes and for the successful protection of linguistic minorities. This is among the reasons why the Ladin municipalities of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo/Anpezo, Livinallongo del Col di Lana/Fodom and Colle Santa Lucia/Col have asked in a referendum to be detached from Veneto and reannexed to the province, from which they were separated under the fascist government.

=== Euroregion ===

In 1996, the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino was formed between the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino. The boundaries of the association correspond to the old County of Tyrol. The aim is to promote regional peace, understanding and cooperation in many areas. The region&#x27;s assemblies meet together as one on various occasions, and have set up a common liaison office with the European Union in Brussels.

== Geography ==

South Tyrol is located at the northernmost point in Italy. The province is bordered by Austria to the east and north, specifically by the Austrian federal states Tyrol and Salzburg, and by the Swiss canton of Graubünden to the west. The Italian provinces of Belluno, Trentino, and Sondrio border to the southeast, south, and southwest, respectively.

The landscape itself is mostly cultivated with different types of shrubs and forests and is highly mountainous.

Entirely located in the Alps, the province&#x27;s landscape is dominated by mountains. The highest peak is the Ortler () in the far west, which is also the highest peak in the Eastern Alps outside the Bernina Range. Even more famous are the craggy peaks of the Dolomites in the eastern part of the region.

The following mountain groups are (partially) in South Tyrol. All but the Sarntal Alps are on the border with Austria, Switzerland, or other Italian provinces. The ranges are clockwise from the west and for each the highest peak is given that is within the province or on its border.

Located between the mountains are many valleys, where the majority of the population lives.

=== Administrative divisions ===

The province is divided into eight districts (German: &quot;Bezirksgemeinschaften&quot;, Italian: ), one of them being the chief city of Bolzano. Each district is headed by a president and two bodies called the district committee and the district council. The districts are responsible for resolving intermunicipal disputes and providing roads, schools, and social services such as retirement homes.

The province is further divided into 116 &quot;Gemeinden&quot; or &quot;comuni&quot;.

=== Climate ===
Climatically, South Tyrol may be divided into five distinct groups:

The Adige valley area, with cold winters (24-hour averages in January of about ) and warm summers (24-hour averages in July of about ), usually classified as humid subtropical climate — Cfa. It has the driest and sunniest climate of the province. The main city in this area is Bolzano.

The midlands, between , with cold winters (24-hour averages in January between ) and mild summers (24-hour averages in July between ). This is a typical oceanic climate, classified as Cfb. It is usually wetter than the subtropical climate, and very snowy during the winters. During the spring and autumn, there is an extended foggy season, but fog may occur even on summer mornings. Main towns in this area are Meran, Bruneck, Sterzing, and Brixen. Near the lakes in higher lands (between ) the humidity may make the climate in these regions milder during winter, but also cooler in summer, making it more similar to a subpolar oceanic climate, Cfc.
The alpine valleys between , with a typically humid continental climate — Dfb, covering the largest part of the province. The winters are usually very cold (24-hour averages in January between ), and the summers, mild with averages between . It is a very snowy climate; snow may occur from early October to April or even May. Main municipalities in this area are Urtijëi, Badia, Sexten, Toblach, Stilfs, Vöran, and Mühlwald.

The alpine valleys between , with a subarctic climate — Dfc, with harsh winters (24-hour averages in January between ) and cool, short, rainy and foggy summers (24-hour averages in July of about ). These areas usually have five months below the freezing point, and snow sometimes occurs even during the summer, in September. This climate is the wettest of the province, with large rainfalls during the summer, heavy snowfalls during spring and fall. The winter is usually a little drier, marked by freezing and dry weeks, although not sufficiently dry to be classified as a Dwc climate. Main municipalities in this area are Corvara, Sëlva, Santa Cristina Gherdëina.

The highlands above , with an alpine tundra climate, ET, which becomes an ice cap climate, EF, above . The winters are cold, but sometimes not as cold as the higher valleys&#x27; winters. In January, most of the areas at have an average temperature of about , while in the valleys at about , the mean temperature may be as low as . The higher lands, above are usually extremely cold, with averages of about during the coldest month, January.

=== Geology ===
The periadriatic seam, which separates the Southern Alps from the Central Alps, runs through South Tyrol in a southwest–northeast direction. In South Tyrol at least three of the four main structural elements of the Alps come to light: the Southern Alpine comes to light south of the periadriatic suture, the Eastern Alpine north of it, and in the northern part of the country, east of the Brenner Pass, the Tauern window, in which the Peninsular and, according to some authors, the Helvetic are visible.

In South Tyrol, the following structure can be roughly recognized: The lowest floor forms the crystalline basement. About 280 million years ago, in the Lower Permian, multiple magmatic events occurred. At that time the Brixen granite was formed at the northern boundary of the Southern Alps, and at about the same time, further south in the Bolzano area, there was strong volcanic activity that formed the Adige Valley volcanic complex. In the Upper Permian a period began in which sedimentary rocks were formed. At first, these were partly clastic sediments, among which the Gröden sandstone is found. In the Triassic, massive carbonate platforms of dolomitic rocks then formed; this process was interrupted in the Middle Triassic by a brief but violent phase of volcanic activity.

In South Tyrol, the Eastern Alps consist mainly of metamorphic rocks, such as gneisses or mica schists, with occasional intercalations of marble and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks with metamorphic overprint (e.g., in the Ortler or southwest of the Brenner). Various metamorphic rocks are found in the Tauern Window, such as Hochstegen marble (as in Wolfendorn), Grünschiefer (as in Hochfeiler), or rocks of the Zentralgneiss (predominantly in the area of the Zillertal Main Ridge).

The province of South Tyrol has placed numerous geological natural monuments under protection. Among the best known are the Bletterbach Gorge, a 12 km (7½ mile) long canyon in the municipality of Aldein, and the Ritten Earth Pyramids, which are the largest in Europe with a height of up to .

=== Mountains ===

According to the Alpine Association, South Tyrol is home to 13 mountain groups of the Eastern Alps, of which only the Sarntal Alps are entirely within national borders. The remaining twelve are (clockwise, starting from the west): Sesvenna Group, Ötztal Alps, Stubai Alps, Zillertal Alps, Venediger Group, Rieserferner Group, Villgratner Mountains, Carnic Alps, Dolomites, Fleimstal Alps, Nonsberg Group and Ortler Alps. Of particular note are the Dolomites, parts of which were recognized by UNESCO in 2009 as a &quot;Dolomite World Heritage Site&quot;.

Although some isolated massifs approach and show strong glaciation (especially in the Ortler Alps and on the main ridge of the Alps), South Tyrol is by far dominated by mountains with altitudes of between . Among the multitude of peaks, the Dolomites are the highest in the Alps. Among the large number of peaks, three stand out for their alpine or cultural importance: the Ortler () as the highest mountain in South Tyrol, the Schlern () as the country&#x27;s &quot;landmark&quot; and the Drei Zinnen () as the center of alpine climbing. Other well-known mountains are the Königspitze (), the Weißkugel (), the Similaun (), the Hochwilde (), the Sarner Weißhorn (), the Hochfeiler (), the Dreiherrnspitze (), the Hochgall (), the Peitlerkofel (), the Langkofel () and the Rosengartenspitze ().

The extensive mountain landscapes, about 34% of the total area of South Tyrol, are alpine pastures (including the of the great Alpe di Siusi). Along the main valleys, the mountain ranges descend in many places to valley bottoms over gently terraced landscapes, which are geological remains of former valley systems; situated between inhospitable high mountains and formerly boggy or deeply incised valley bottoms, these areas known as the &quot;Mittelgebirge&quot; (including, for example, the Schlern area) are of particular importance in terms of settlement history.

=== Valleys ===

The three main valleys of South Tyrol are the Adige Valley, the Eisack Valley and the Puster Valley, formed by the Ice Age Adige glacier and its tributaries. The highest part of the Adige valley in western South Tyrol, from Reschen () to Töll (approx. ) near Merano, is called Vinschgau; the southernmost section, from Bolzano to Salurner Klause (), is divided into Überetsch and Unterland. From there, the Adige Valley continues in a southerly direction until it merges with the Po plain at Verona.

At Bolzano, the Eisack Valley merges into the Adige Valley. The Eisack Valley runs from Bolzano northeastward to Franzensfeste, where it merges with the Wipp Valley, which runs first northwestward and then northward over the Brenner Pass to Innsbruck. In the town of Brixen, the Eisack Valley meets the Puster Valley, which passes through Bruneck and reaches Lienz via the Toblacher Sattel (). In addition to the three main valleys, South Tyrol has a large number of side valleys. The most important and populated side valleys are (from west to east) Sulden, Schnals, Ulten, Passeier, Ridnaun, the Sarntal, Pfitsch, Gröden, the Gadertal, the Tauferer Ahrntal and Antholz.

In mountainous South Tyrol, about 64.5% of the total land area is above above sea level and only 14% below . Therefore, a large part of the population is concentrated in relatively small areas in the valleys at an altitude of between , mainly in the area of the extensive alluvial cones and broad basins. The most densely populated areas are in the Adige valley, where three of the four largest cities, Bolzano, Merano and Laives, are located. The flat valley bottoms are mainly used for agriculture.

=== Hydrography ===

The most important river in South Tyrol is the Adige, which rises at the Reschen Pass, flows for a distance of about to the border at the Salurner Klause, and then flows into the Po Valley and the Adriatic Sea. The Adige, whose total length of in Italy is exceeded only by the Po, drains 97% of the territory&#x27;s surface area. Its river system also includes the Eisack, about long, and the Rienz, about long, the next two largest rivers in South Tyrol. They are fed by numerous rivers and streams in the tributary valleys. The most important tributaries are the Plima, the Passer, the Falschauer, the Talfer, the Ahr and the Gader. The remaining 3% of the area is drained by the Drava and Inn river systems to the Black Sea and by the Piave river system to the Adriatic Sea, respectively.

In South Tyrol there are 176 natural lakes with an area of more than half a hectare (1¼ acre), most of which are located above altitude. Only 13 natural lakes are larger than 5 ha, and only three of them are situated below altitude: the Kalterer See (), the Großer () and the Kleiner Montiggler See (). Fourteen South Tyrolean reservoirs used for energy production include the Reschensee (), which with an area of forms the largest standing body of water in South Tyrol, the Zufrittsee () and the Arzkarsee ().

The natural monuments designated by the province of South Tyrol include numerous hydrological objects, such as streams, waterfalls, moors, glaciers and mountain lakes like the Pragser Wildsee (), the Karersee () or the Spronser Seen ().

=== Vegetation ===

Approximately 50% of the area of South Tyrol is covered by forests, another 40% is above and thus largely beyond the forest demarcation line, which varies between . In each case, more than half of the total forest area is located on land with a slope steeper than 20° and at altitudes between . Approximately 24% of the forest area can be classified as protective forest preserving settlements, traffic routes and other human infrastructure. A 1997 study classified about 35% of South Tyrol&#x27;s forests as near-natural or natural, about 41% as moderately modified and about 24% as heavily modified or artificial. The forests are found in the valley bottoms.

The flat valley bottoms were originally completely covered with riparian forests, of which only very small remnants remain along the rivers. The remaining areas have given way to settlements and agricultural land. On the valley slopes, sub-Mediterranean mixed deciduous forests are found up to altitude, characterized mainly by manna ash, hop hornbeam, hackberry, sweet chestnut and downy oak. From about of altitude, red beech or pine forests can appear instead, colonizing difficult and arid sites (more rarely). At altitudes between , spruce forests are found; between , montane and subalpine spruce forests predominate. The latter are often mixed with tree species such as larch, rowan, white pine and stone pine. The larch and stone pine forests at the upper edge of the forest belt occupy relatively small areas. Beyond the forest edge, subalpine dwarf shrub communities, alpine grasslands and, lately, alpine tundra dominate the landscape as vegetation types.

== Politics ==

The local government system is based upon the provisions of the Italian Constitution and the Autonomy Statute of the Region Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. The 1972 second Statute of Autonomy for Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol devolved most legislative and executive competences from the regional level to the provincial level, creating &quot;de facto&quot; two separate regions.

The considerable legislative power of the province is vested in an assembly, the Landtag of South Tyrol (German: &quot;Südtiroler Landtag&quot;; Italian: &quot;Consiglio della Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano&quot;; Ladin: &quot;Cunsëi dla Provinzia Autonoma de Bulsan&quot;).
The legislative powers of the assembly are defined by the second Statute of Autonomy.

The executive powers are attributed to the government (German: &quot;Landesregierung&quot;; Italian: &quot;Giunta Provinciale&quot;) headed by the &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot; Arno Kompatscher. He belongs to the South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party, which has been governing with a parliamentary majority since 1948. South Tyrol is characterized by long sitting presidents, having only had two presidents between 1960 and 2014 (Silvius Magnago 1960–1989, Luis Durnwalder 1989–2014).

A fiscal regime allows the province to retain a large part of most levied taxes, in order to execute and administer its competences. Nevertheless, South Tyrol remains a net contributor to the Italian national budget.

=== Provincial Government ===

The provincial government (&quot;Landesregierung&quot;) of South Tyrol (formerly also called provincial committee, &quot;Giunta provinciale&quot; in Italian, &quot;Junta provinziala&quot; in Ladin) consists of a provincial governor and a variable number of provincial councilors. Currently (2021), the provincial government consists of eight provincial councilors and the provincial governor. The deputies of the provincial governor are appointed from among the provincial councilors. The current governor is Arno Kompatscher (SVP), his deputies are the provincial councilors Arnold Schuler (SVP), Giuliano Vettorato (LN) and Daniel Alfreider (SVP).

The Governor and the Provincial Councilors are elected by Parliament by secret ballot with an absolute majority of votes. The composition of the provincial government must in any case reflect the proportional distribution of the German and Italian language groups in the provincial parliament. In the past, this provision prevented the German-dominated South Tyrol People&#x27;s Party (SVP) from governing alone and allowed Italian parties to participate in the provincial government. Since the Ladin language group, with just under 4% of South Tyrol&#x27;s resident population, has little electoral potential, a separate provision in the autonomy statute allows Ladin representation in the provincial government regardless of their proportional representation in the provincial parliament.

=== Secessionist movement ===
Given the region&#x27;s historical and cultural association with neighboring Austria, calls for the secession of South Tyrol and its reunification with Austria do surface from time to time among some minor groups of German-speakers, although falling short of a majority in the province, the majority does not support a separation. Among the political parties that support South Tyrol&#x27;s reunification into Austria are South Tyrolean Freedom, Die Freiheitlichen and Citizens&#x27; Union for South Tyrol.

==Economy==
In 2016 South Tyrol had a GDP per capita of €42,600, making it the richest province in Italy and one of the richest in the European Union.

The unemployment level in 2007 was roughly 2.4% (2.0% for men and 3.0% for women). Residents are employed in a variety of sectors, from agriculture — the province is a large producer of apples, and its South Tyrol wine are also renowned — to industry to services, especially tourism. Spas located on the Italian Alps have become a favorite for tourists seeking wellness.

South Tyrol is home to numerous mechanical engineering companies, some of which are the global market leaders in their sectors: the Leitner Group that specializes in cable cars and wind energy, TechnoAlpin AG, which is the global market leader in snow-making technology and the snow groomer company Prinoth.
The unemployment rate stood at 3.8% in 2020.

===Transport===

The region is, together with northern and eastern Tyrol, an important transit point between southern Germany and Northern Italy. Freights by road and rail pass through here. One of the most important highways is the A22, also called the &quot;Autostrada del Brennero&quot;. It connects to the Brenner Autobahn in Austria.

The vehicle registration plate of South Tyrol is the two-letter provincial code Bz for the capital city, Bolzano. Along with the autonomous Trentino (Tn) and Aosta Valley (Ao), South Tyrol is allowed to surmount its license plates with its coat of arms.

Rail transport goes over the Brenner Pass. The Brenner Railway is a major line connecting the Austrian and Italian railways from Innsbruck and Verona climbing the Wipptal, passing over the Brenner Pass and descending down the Eisack Valley to Bolzano and then down the Adige Valley from Bolzano to Rovereto and to Verona. The line is part of the Line 1 of Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T).

Other railways are the Pustertalbahn, Ritten Railway and Vinschgaubahn. Due to the steep slopes of the mountains, a number of funiculars exist, such as the Gardena Ronda Express funicular and Mendel Funicular.

The Brenner Base Tunnel is under construction and scheduled to be completed by 2032. With a planned length of , this tunnel will increase freight train average speed to and reduce transit time by over an hour.

Larger cities used to have their own tramway system, such as the Meran Tramway and Bolzano Tramway. These were replaced after the Second World War with buses. Many other cities and municipalities have their own bus system or are connected with each other by it.

The Bolzano Airport is the only airport serving the region.

== Demographics ==

=== Languages ===
German and Italian are both official languages of South Tyrol. In some eastern municipalities Ladin is the third official language. 

A majority of the inhabitants of contemporary South Tyrol speak the native Southern Bavarian dialect of the German language. Standard German plays a dominant role in education and media. All citizens have the right to use their own mother tongue, even at court. Schools are separated for each language group. All traffic signs are officially bi- or trilingual. Most Italian place names were translated from German by Italian Ettore Tolomei, the author of the .

To reach a fair allocation of jobs in public service a system called ethnic proportion (, ) has been established. Every ten years, when the general census of population takes place, each Italian citizen has to declare the linguistic group to which they belong or want to be aggregated to. According to the results they decide how many people of which group are going to be employed in public service.

At the time of the annexation of the southern part of Tyrol by Italy in 1919, the overwhelming majority of the population spoke German and identified with the Austrian or German nationality: in 1910, according to the last population census before World War I, the German-speaking population numbered 224,000, the Ladin 9,000 and the Italian 7,000.

As a result of the Italianization of South Tyrol about 22.6% of the population are Italian-speakers (they were 33%, 138,000 of 414,000 inhabitants in the 1971 census) according to the census of 2024. 102 out of 116 comuni have a majority of German native speakers, eight have a Ladin-speaking majority, and six a majority of Italian speakers. The Italian-speaking population lives mainly around the provincial capital Bolzano, where they are the majority (74.7% of the inhabitants), and partially a result of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s policy of Italianisation after he took power in 1922, when he encouraged immigration from the rest of Italy. 

The other five comuni where the Italian-speaking population is the majority are Merano, Laives, Salorno, Bronzolo and Vadena. The eight comuni with Ladin majorities are: La Val, Badia, Corvara, Mareo, San Martin de Tor, Santa Cristina Gherdëina, Sëlva, Urtijëi. Most of the immigrants from South Tyrol to the United States identify themselves as being of German rather than Austrian identity. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2015, there were 365 individuals living in the U.S. born in Italy who identified themselves as being of Austrian ancestry. By contrast, in the same year, there were 1040 individuals living in the U.S. born in Italy who identified themselves as being of German ancestry. 

The linguistic breakdown according to the census of 2024:
=== Religion ===
The majority of the population is Christian, mostly in the Catholic tradition. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Bolzano-Brixen corresponds to the territory of the province of South Tyrol. Since 27 July 2011 the bishop of Bolzano-Brixen is Ivo Muser.

==== Catholic Church ====

The vast majority of the population of South Tyrol is baptized Catholic. There is archaeological evidence of early Christian sites in the area as early as Late Antiquity; Säben in the Eisack Valley became an important ecclesiastical center during this period, which was only replaced by Brixen as an episcopal see in the late Middle Ages. The territory of present-day South Tyrol was divided for centuries between the dioceses of Brixen, Chur (until 1808/1816) and Trent (until 1964). 

The most famous bishop of Brixen was the polymath Nicholas of Cusa. Important figures of the regional ecclesiastical life in the 19th century were the beatified bishop of Trent Johann Nepomuk von Tschiderer and the mystic Maria von Mörl. 

In 1964, with reference to modern political boundaries, the Bishopric of Brixen, which had lost its extensive territories of North and East Tyrol after World War I, was enlarged to form the Diocese of Bolzano-Brixen, whose extension is now identical to that of the province of South Tyrol. Since then, the faithful have been led by Bishops Joseph Gargitter (1964-1986), Wilhelm Egger (1986-2008), Karl Golser (2008-2011) and Ivo Muser (since 2011). The diocese comprises 28 deaneries and 281 parishes (in 2014), 23 its episcopal churches are the Cathedral of Brixen and the Cathedral of Bolzano. Cassian and Vigilius are venerated as diocesan patrons. Important references in the current discourses of the local Catholic Church are St. Joseph Freinademetz and Blessed Joseph Mayr-Nusser.

==== Other communities ====
There is a Lutheran community in Merano (founded 1861) and another one in Bolzano (founded 1889). Since the Middle Ages the Jewish presence has been documented in South Tyrol. In 1901 the Synagogue of Merano was built. As of 2015, South Tyrol was home to about 14,000 Muslims.

== Culture ==
=== Traditions ===
South Tyrol has long-standing traditions, mainly inherited from its membership in the historical Tyrol. The Schützen associations are particularly fond of Tyrolean traditions.

The Scheibenschlagen are the traditional &quot;throwing of burning discs&quot; on the first Sunday of Lent, the Herz-Jesu-Feuer are the &quot;fires of the Sacred Heart of Jesus&quot; that are lit on the third Sunday after Pentecost. The Krampus are disguised demons who accompany St Nicholas.

There are also several legends and sagas linked to the peoples of the Dolomites; among the best known are the legend of King Laurin and that of the Kingdom of Fanes, which belongs to the Ladin mythological heritage.

Alpine Transhumance (from German &quot;Almabtrieb&quot;), is a farm practice: every year, between September and October, the livestock that stayed on the high pastures is brought back to the valley, with traditional music and dances. Especially, the transhumance between the Ötztal (in Austria) and Schnals Valley and Passeier Valley was recognised by UNESCO as universal intangible heritage in 2019.

=== Education ===
=== Architecture ===
The region features a large number of castles and churches. Many of the castles and Ansitze were built by the local nobility and the Habsburg rulers. See List of castles in South Tyrol.

===Museums===
Among the major museums of South Tyrol are:
* the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology, which has the mummy of Ötzi the Iceman
* the Museion, Museum of modern and contemporary art of Bolzano
* the Messner Mountain Museum of Reinhold Messner
* the White Tower (Brixen) museum

=== Media ===
German-language TV channels in South Tyrol:
* RAS
* Rai Südtirol
* Südtirol Digital Fernsehen
* Südtirol Heute

=== Music ===
The Bozner Bergsteigerlied and the Andreas-Hofer-Lied are considered to be the unofficial anthems of South Tyrol.

The folk musical group Kastelruther Spatzen from Kastelruth and the rock band Frei.Wild from Brixen have received high recognition in the German-speaking part of the world.

Award-winning electronic music producer Giorgio Moroder was born and raised in South Tyrol in a mixed Italian, German and Ladin-speaking environment.

=== Sports ===
South Tyrolese have been successful at winter sports and they regularly form a large part of Italy&#x27;s contingent at the Winter Olympics: in the last edition (2022), South Tyroleans won 3 out of the 17 Italian medals, all three bronzes (of which two won by German-speaking South Tyroleans). Famed mountain climber Reinhold Messner, the first climber to climb Mount Everest without the use of oxygen tanks, was born and raised in the region. Other successful South Tyrolese include luger Armin Zöggeler, figure skater Carolina Kostner, skier Isolde Kostner, luge and bobsleigh medallist Gerda Weissensteiner, tennis players Andreas Seppi and Jannik Sinner, and former team principal of Haas F1 Team in the FIA Formula One World Championship Guenther Steiner.

HC Interspar Bolzano-Bozen Foxes are one of Italy&#x27;s most successful ice hockey teams, while the most important football club in South Tyrol is FC Südtirol, which won its first-ever promotion to Serie B in 2022.

The province is famous worldwide for its mountain climbing opportunities, while in winter it is home to a number of popular ski resorts including Val Gardena, Alta Badia and Seiser Alm.

<doc id="169615" wikidata="Q1768794" url="?curid=169615" title="Sweet Children (EP)">
<text>Sweet Children is the third EP by American rock band Green Day. It was released in August 1990 through Skene! Records. The name of the EP is a reference to a previous name of the band. One of the tracks is a cover of &quot;My Generation&quot; by the Who. All tracks were later included on the CD and cassette releases of the band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Kerplunk&quot;.

==History==
The EP is a collection of some of the band&#x27;s earliest songs that they were still playing live at the time. It was recorded in two hours on July 5, 1990, at Six Feet Under in Minneapolis while the band was on a brief break from their summer tour, and released on seven-inch vinyl. The EP was released on Minneapolis-based indie label Skene! Records. &quot;Best Thing in Town&quot; was one of the first songs the band had written together. These were the last recordings drummer John Kiffmeyer would contribute to the band. Shortly after the end of the tour, he left the band to attend college.

Also of note, &quot;My Generation&quot; features a line from the film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;: &quot;Heineken? Fuck that shit!&quot;, said by the primary antagonist Frank Booth, although it&#x27;s not the actual audio sample.

==Pressings==
There are five different pressings of the EP (some limited quantities included two different variations of red vinyl). The first four have been out of print since its inclusion on the CD and cassette issues of Green Day&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Kerplunk&quot;, in 1992. Because of this, it has since become a valuable and sought-after item among collectors and Green Day fans alike.

The first pressing&#x27;s cover is a picture of Mike Dirnt&#x27;s leg during a concert.

The second pressing&#x27;s cover is a black and white picture of a somewhat trashed Volkswagen Beetle with the caption &quot;What Do You Think Mike...&quot; This rare second pressing, limited to 600 copies as opposed to the first run&#x27;s 1,500, also featured a handwritten insert, reading &quot;Not a lyrics sheet, so don&#x27;t get your hopes up&quot;.

The third pressing is the same as the one above in every way except there is no insert, and the cover, instead of being black and white, is tinted red.

The fourth pressing is a reissue, possibly from 1991, for it has a lengthy summary on the back which explains that the songs are also on &quot;Kerplunk&quot;. The cover is mostly blank, featuring only a picture of a group of three children nearby a body of water with their backs to the camera, although at the bottom of the cover it says “(Note: No! This is not a new Green Day 7” but the same old SKENE! one that we keep having to repress and hence keep running out of covers for…the music is exactly the same, just in different packaging to keep the people who have to stuff these things into plastic sleeves from getting bored. So keep in mind, catering to collector-scum by paying big $$$ for something because it looks a wee bit different only makes you look like a sap…)”

On March 24, 2009, the EP was back in print as it was included with the vinyl reissue of &quot;Kerplunk&quot;. It is a reissue of the first pressing.

In 1990, on the first day of the EP&#x27;s release, it sold 493 copies.

<doc id="169618" wikidata="Q6071778" url="?curid=169618" title="Irish states since 1171">
<text>Irish states have existed under a number of different names for nearly a thousand years. A unified Irish proto-state had been coalescing from the multitude of small tribal kingdoms that existed circa AD 500, similar to the pattern elsewhere in Europe. The independent development of the several dynastic regional kingdoms into a nascent national kingdom, however, was extinguished by the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, although these regional Gaelic Ireland kingdoms continued to resist for centuries until the Tudor conquest of Ireland was completed in the 17th century.

This list deals with the various states that existed from 1171 onwards that owed their origin to Norman and later, English involvement on the island of Ireland. These were recognised by the Holy See before 1570 and after 1766. Until the whole island was subdued following the end of the Nine Years&#x27; War in 1603 these states shared the island of Ireland with a patchwork of indigenous states that existed outside of their authority.

The list below refers to all-Ireland (or nominally all-Ireland) states and to the 1922 post-partition states, not the individual Gaelic kingdoms which exercised the actual governance in their area when they existed, including during the 1350–1500 &quot;Gaelic resurgence&quot;.

* [[Lordship of Ireland]] (1171–1541)
* [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1541–1800)
:* Confederate Ireland (1642–1649) was an Irish government that controlled about two thirds of Ireland during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and is arguably the only large successful sustained period of Irish self-government between the time of Brian Boru the High King of Ireland and the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922.
:* Patriot Parliament (1689)
:* The revolutionary French backed [[Irish Republic (1798)|Irish Republic]] (late August and early September 1798) controlled only parts of Connacht and is often overlooked today
* Part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (1801–1922)
:* The revolutionary [[Irish Republic (1916)|Irish Republic]] (Easter Week, 1916) controlled only small parts of the capital, Dublin, for 6 days, but has had great symbolic significance ever since
* The revolutionary [[Irish Republic]] (1919–22)
* [[Northern Ireland]] (1921–present) and [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]] (1921–22), both created by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, though only the former existed in reality.
* [[Irish Free State|Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann)]] (1922–37)
* [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (1937–present), often known since 1949 by its official description, Republic of Ireland, and sometimes in English as [[Éire]], the word for Ireland in Irish.

For international purposes the British monarch was also King of Ireland until 1949, after which time the President of Ireland became the sole sovereign. The Monarch&#x27;s internal powers had already been removed by 1937. With the enactment of the Republic of Ireland Act in 1949, all powers of the British monarch were transferred to the president. The name of the state remained &quot;Ireland&quot;, even after the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act, see names of the Irish state.

<doc id="169619" wikidata="Q7808426" url="?curid=169619" title="Tino rangatiratanga">
<text>is a Māori language term that translates literally to &#x27;highest chieftainship&#x27; or &#x27;unqualified chieftainship&#x27;, but is also translated as &quot;absolute sovereignty&quot; or &quot;self-determination,&quot; is central to Māori political aspirations. Many Māori advocate for &quot;tino rangatiratanga&quot; as a way to restore Māori control over their lands, resources, and cultural institutions. The very translation of is important to New Zealand politics, as it is used in the Māori version of the Treaty of Waitangi to express &quot;full exclusive and undisturbed possession&quot; over Māori-owned lands and property, but different translations have drastically different implications for the relationship between the 1840 signatories: the British Crown and the Māori chiefs (&quot;rangatira&quot;). 

It has become one of the most contentious phrases in retrospective analyses of the treaty amid debate surrounding the obligations that were agreed to by each signatory. The phrase features in current historical and political discourse on race relations in New Zealand and is widely used by Māori advocacy groups. 

== Calls for tino rangatiratanga ==
One of the foundational examples of Māori assertions of sovereignty is &quot;He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni&quot; (The Declaration of Independence, 1835). Signed by northern Māori chiefs, this document affirmed Māori sovereignty over New Zealand and continues to be referenced, particularly by Ngāpuhi, as a basis for Māori independence. For example, groups like Ngāti Hine have expressed interest in pursuing greater autonomy or hapū-level independence. Activists such as Donna Awatere Huata have also advanced the cause of self-determination, envisioning full independence in works like &quot;Māori Sovereignty&quot;.

A &quot;tino rangatiratanga&quot; flag was designed in 1989 and has become accepted as a national flag for Māori groups across New Zealand. The Tino Rangatiratanga flag has become a prominent symbol of sovereignty, often seen during protests. In some instances, these protests include explicit calls for Māori independence and the rejection of New Zealand government authority. Small radical groups, such as Nga Iwi Morehu, have echoed these sentiments, drawing on findings like the Waitangi Tribunal’s Wai 1040 report, which asserts that Māori never ceded sovereignty under the Treaty of Waitangi.

== Origins and etymology ==

A is a chief, the nominalising suffix makes the word an abstract noun referring to the quality or attributes of chieftainship. The word is also translated as &#x27;chiefly autonomy&#x27;, or &#x27;kingdom&#x27;, referencing the &#x27;chiefly authority&#x27; and domain of the chief.

 is used as an intensifier, indicating that something is true, genuine or unrivalled. The addition in this context means the phrase can be translated as &#x27;highest chieftainship&#x27;.

The intention of the phrase was to &quot;emphasize to a chief the Queen&#x27;s intention to give the complete control according to &quot;their&quot; customs&quot;. One English translation is &#x27;absolute sovereignty&#x27;, although many also refer to it as self-determination, autonomy, or Māori independence.

== Treaty of Waitangi ==
The emphasis on &quot;&quot; draws from an inconsistency arising between Article 1 and Article 2 of the Treaty of Waitangi:

*In the English text of Article 1 of the treaty, the Māori signatories cede their sovereignty to the British Crown. For the Māori text, since there was no direct Māori translation for the idea, the missionary neologism (&#x27;governorship&#x27;) was used to represent the concept of sovereignty. That word was based on the transliteration of from &#x27;governor&#x27;, which had been invented by Bible translators to explain Pontius Pilate&#x27;s authority in Judaea. had also been used prior to 1840 to describe the Governor of New South Wales.
*In the English text of Article 2, signatories are assured that &quot;the full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties&quot; would remain for so long as they chose. In the Māori text, signatories are assured that their &quot;&quot; will remain undisturbed over their lands, and other : &quot;te tino rangatiratanga o ratou wenua o ratou kainga me o ratou taonga katoa&quot;, literally &quot;the absolute chieftainship of your lands, your homes, and all your treasures/taonga&quot;.

Based on the Māori text alone, in Article 1, the signatories appear to be granting &#x27;, and in Article 2, the signatories are promised that their &#x27; (&#x27;absolutely sovereignty&#x27; or &#x27;highest chieftainship&#x27;) would remain undisturbed. The apparent inconsistency led to much debate as to whether the Māori signatories intended to cede their sovereignty to the British Crown at all: a debate now definitively resolved by the Waitangi Tribunal finding that sovereignty was not ceded by the signing of the Treaty, but the Tribunal said nothing about how and when the Crown acquired the sovereignty that it exercises today.

=== Text of the Treaty ===

The original Māori text of article two with a literal translation by Professor I. H. Kawharu, as published in the Report of the Royal Commission on Social Policy in 1988 (bold added):

==Flag==

The &quot;tino rangatiratanga&quot; flag is often referred to as the national Māori flag and can be used to represent all Māori. Hiraina Marsden, Jan Smith and Linda Munn designed the flag in 1989. It uses black, white, and red as national colours of New Zealand. The design of the flag references the Māori creation story of Rangi and Papa, suggesting the sky, the earth, and the physical realm of light and being, which was created when they were separated.

<text>Taonga or taoka (in South Island Māori) is a Māori-language word that refers to a treasured possession in Māori culture. It lacks a direct translation into English, making its use in the Treaty of Waitangi significant. The current definition differs from the historical one, noted by Hongi Hika as &quot;property procured by the spear&quot; [one could understand this as war booty or defended property] and is now interpreted to mean a wide range of both tangible and intangible possessions, especially items of historical cultural significance. It has been changed to suit agendas. The 1820 Grammar and Vocabulary of the Language of New Zealand by Cambridge University professor Samuel Lee defined taonga as property procured by the spear. The second dictionary, was the Dictionary of the New Zealand Language by William Williams, published in 1844 four years after treaty was signed. This simply defined taonga as property.

Tangible examples are all sorts of heirlooms and artefacts, land, fisheries, natural resources such as geothermal springs and access to natural resources, such as riparian water rights and access to the riparian zone of rivers or streams. Intangible examples may include language and spiritual beliefs. The concept of &quot;taonga&quot; can also transcend into general New Zealand culture and non-Māori items; for example, the Ranfurly Shield is recognised as a &quot;taonga&quot; amongst the New Zealand rugby community.

Traditionally &quot;taonga&quot; represent the tangible and intangible links between Māori people and their ancestors and land. &quot;Taonga&quot; serve to reaffirm these genealogical connections to people and place known as whakapapa. &quot;Taonga&quot; serve as genealogical reference markers that help connect the living with their past. The intangible elements of &quot;taonga&quot;, such as the stories and genealogy that accompany them, are just as important as the object itself. Mina McKenzie described maintaining the connections between tangible objects, intangible properties, place and descendants as &#x27;keeping the taonga warm.&#x27;

What is deemed to be a &quot;taonga&quot; has major political, economic and social consequences in New Zealand and has been the subject of fierce debates as the varying definitions and interpretations have implications for policies regarding such things as intellectual property, genetic engineering and allocation of radio frequency spectrum.

== Relationships ==
Fundamental to taonga are the relationships they exist in, including the people that made or cared for them, the communities they came from, and the ways they are connected to specific aspects of Maori culture.

==Treaty of Waitangi and te Tiriti o Waitangi==
The definition of &quot;taonga&quot; has potential constitutional significance in New Zealand because of the use of the word in the second article of the Treaty of Waitangi (). The English-language version of the treaty guaranteed the Māori signatories &quot;full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and &quot;other properties&quot;&quot;. The Māori-language version of the treaty, which the vast majority of the signing parties endorsed (461 of 500 signatures), used the word &quot;taonga&quot; to translate the English phrase &quot;other properties&quot;.

Section 6(e) of the Resource Management Act 1991 mandates decision-makers to &quot;recognise and provide for the relationship of Māori and their culture and traditions with their ancestral lands, water, sites, wāhi tapu [sacred sites], and other taonga&quot; as a matter of national importance.

==Artifacts==
&quot;Te Uenuku&quot;, or simply &quot;Uenuku&quot; is an important early Māori carving housed at Te Awamutu Museum. &quot;Te Uenuku&quot; (literally &quot;The rainbow&quot;) represents the tribal god Uenuku.

&quot;Korotangi&quot; (&quot;bird of sorrow&quot;) is a carving of a bird made in serpentine stone. Some Māori of Tainui allegiance believe that it was brought to the country from Hawaiki in their ancestral waka.

==Waitangi Tribunal claims==
A number of claims have been made to the Waitangi Tribunal, relating to the protection of &quot;taonga&quot;.

===Māori language===

In June 1985 a claim was lodged asking that the Māori language receive official recognition. It was proposed that the language be official for all purposes enabling its use as of right in Parliament, the Courts, Government Departments, local authorities and public bodies.

===Radio frequencies===
In June 1986, the Waitangi Tribunal received the Wai 26 claim that the Treaty of Waitangi was breached by the Crown proceeding to introduce legislation related to Māori language before the delivery of the Tribunal&#x27;s &quot;Report on the Te Reo Maori Claim&quot;, and as a consequence, the Māori people would be denied their claims for radio frequencies and a television channel. In June 1990 claim Wai 150 was lodged by Sir Graham Latimer on behalf of the New Zealand Maori Council. The claim was in respect of their rangatiratanga over the allocation of radio frequencies; the claim being that in the absence of an agreement with the Māori, the sale of frequency management licences under the Radiocommunications Act 1989 would be in breach of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Waitangi Tribunal amalgamated the Wai 26 with the Wai 150 claim, with the final report of the Tribunal recommending that the Crown suspend the radio frequency tender process and proceed to negotiate with the iwi.

===Spiritual places and burial sites===
In November 1996, various members of Te Roroa filed a claim with the Waitangi Tribunal concerning the Maunganui block, the Waipoua Forest, Lake Taharoa and surroundings, and the Waimamaku Valley in Northland. A part of the Wai 38 claim related to &quot;taonga&quot;, in particular: wahi tapu &quot;spiritual places of special significance to tangata whenua&quot;, and wakatupapaku (burial chests deposited in ana (caves and crevices)).

The Tribunal report delivered on 3 April 1992 found that the Crown had allowed Te Roroa&#x27;s &quot;taonga&quot; to be violated.

===Māori knowledge of flora and fauna===
The Wai 262 claim in the Waitangi Tribunal is a claim of rights in respect of Mātauranga Māori or Māori knowledge in respect of indigenous flora and fauna. The claimants commissioned a report from Professor D. Williams on traditional ecological knowledge, ethnobotany and international and New Zealand law on intellectual property and conservation.

On 2 July 2011 the Tribunal released its report into the Wai 262 claim: &quot;Ko Aotearoa Tēnei&quot; (‘This is Aotearoa’ or ‘This is New Zealand’). &quot;Ko Aotearoa Tēnei&quot; considers more than 20 Government departments and agencies and makes recommendations as to reforms of &quot;laws, policies or practices relating to health, education, science, intellectual property, indigenous flora and fauna, resource management, conservation, the Māori language, arts and culture, heritage, and the involvement of Māori in the development of New Zealand’s positions on international instruments affecting indigenous rights.&quot; The First Chapter of volume 1 (of the full 2 volume report) considers the relationship between &quot;taonga&quot; works and intellectual property. The Tribunal provides a working definition of a ‘taonga work’ as being that:

:&quot;A taonga work is a work, whether or not it has been fixed, that is in its entirety an expression of mātauranga Māori; it will relate to or invoke ancestral connections, and contain or reflect traditional narratives or stories. A taonga work will possess mauri and have living kaitiaki in accordance with tikanga Māori.&quot; (Vol 1, 1.7.3 p. 96)

These working definitions involve concepts which are described by the Tribunal as being: Mauri is having a living essence or spirit. Kaitiaki can be spiritual guardians that exist in non-human form; kaitiaki obligations also exist in the human realm. The related concept is that &quot;Kaitiakitanga is the obligation, arising from the kin relationship, to nurture or care for a person or thing it has a spiritual aspect, encompassing not only an obligation to care for and nurture not only physical well-being but also mauri.&quot; Kaitiaki obligations are described by the Tribunal as being that, “those who have mana (or, to use treaty terminology, rangatiratanga) must exercise it in accordance with the values of kaitiakitanga – to act unselfishly, with right mind and heart, and with proper Mana and kaitiakitanga go together as right and responsibility, and that kaitiakitanga responsibility can be understood not only as a cultural principle but as a system of law”. The Tribunal also provide a working definition of a ‘taonga-derived work’ as being that:

:&quot;A taonga-derived work is a work that derives its inspiration from mātauranga Māori or a taonga work, but does not relate to or invoke ancestral connections, nor contain or reflect traditional narratives or stories, in any direct way. A taonga-derived work is identifiably Māori in nature or contains identifiably Māori elements, but has neither mauri nor living kaitiaki in accordance with tikanga Māori.&quot;(Vol 1, 1.7.3 p. 96)

The Tribunal considered which principles applied to whether consent to its use, rather than mere consultation, was necessary where the work was a taonga work, or where the knowledge or information was mātauranga Māori.

==Modern usage==
The word &quot;taonga&quot; is often used in the Māori names of institutions and organisations that manage historical collections. Many New Zealand museums contain the term &quot;Whare taonga&quot; (&quot;treasure house&quot;) in the name. Here are some examples:

<doc id="169622" wikidata="Q493511" url="?curid=169622" title="Māori language revival">
<text>The Māori language revival is a movement to promote, reinforce and strengthen the use of the Māori language (&quot;te reo Māori&quot;). Primarily in New Zealand, but also in places with large numbers of expatriate New Zealanders (such as London and Melbourne), the movement aims to increase the use of Māori in the home, in education, government, and business. The movement is part of a broader revival of tikanga Māori (Māori culture, cultural habits and practices) in what has been called the Māori renaissance.

Until World War II, most Māori people spoke Māori as their first language. But by the 1980s, fewer than 20 per cent of Māori spoke the language well enough to be classed as native speakers. The causes of the decline included the switch from using Māori to using English compulsorily in schools and increasing urbanisation, which disconnected younger generations from their extended families—in particular their grandparents, who traditionally played a large part in family life. As a result, many Māori children failed to learn their ancestral language, and generations of non-Māori-speaking Māori emerged.

In response, Māori leaders initiated Māori-language recovery programs such as the kōhanga reo (&quot;language nests&quot;) movement, which, beginning in 1982, immersed infants in Māori from infancy to school age. In 1989, official support was given for kura kaupapa Māori—primary and secondary Māori-language immersion schools.

==Te Wiki o te Reo Māori==

A government-sponsored initiative, , Māori Language Week, has been celebrated since 1975 and is intended to encourage New Zealanders to support the language.

==Māori Language Act 1987 and the Māori Language Commission==
The Māori Language Act 1987 was passed as a response to the Waitangi Tribunal finding that the Māori language was a &quot;taonga&quot;, a treasure or valued possession, under the Treaty of Waitangi.

The Act gave Māori official-language status, and gave speakers a right to use it in legal settings such as in court. It also established the Māori Language Commission (initially called &quot;Te Komihana Mo Te Reo Māori&quot; but later renamed &quot;Te Taura Whiri i Te Reo Māori&quot;) to promote the language and provide advice on it.

==Kōhanga reo==
 is a whānau (family) development and language-revitalisation initiative grounded in Māori cultural principles and ideals. It facilitates the growth and development of mokopuna (grandchildren) through the transmission of Māori language, knowledge and culture. The kōhanga reo movement operates from the Māori philosophical world view and is principally guided by kaumātua (respected elders).

Individual kōhanga reo are autonomously run by their respective whānau, which consists of a &quot;collective group of teachers, parents, local elders, and members of the Māori community&quot;. While funded by governmental quarterly grants from the Te Kōhanga Reo National Trust, kōhanga reo often also charge additional fees to cover operational costs. These fees, determined by each whānau, are generally comparable to or less expensive than traditional child-care. Conducted entirely in Māori, a kōhanga reo is an environment where 0–6-year-olds, kaumātua and whānau spend time together talking, playing, praying and learning. Daily activities may take place anywhere that is safe and warm including marae (traditional community meeting places), converted homes or purpose-built centres.

Emerging in the late 1970s at the direction of kaumātua, kōhanga reo was an immediate and urgent response to the decline of the Māori language and tikanga Māori. Jean Puketapu and Iritana Tawhiwhirangi were among the early leaders when the first kōhanga reo was founded in Wainuiomata in 1982. Three years later there were over 300 operating. The success of kōhanga reo is such that they have been followed by the establishment of primary schools and secondary schools (kura kaupapa Māori) where Māori is the primary language of instruction. The role of Māori language in education in New Zealand is enshrined in the Education Act 1989.

The kōhanga reo concept has led to other before-school initiatives in New Zealand that instruct in Pacific languages, e.g. Fijian, Rarotongan, Samoan, and Tongan and other countries adopting a similar concept. A notable example being &quot;Pūnana Leo&quot; established in Hawaii to revitalise the indigenous Hawaiian language.

==Kura kaupapa Māori==

Kura kaupapa Māori are Māori-language-immersion schools.

==Politics==
Election campaigns by the Māori Party often feature increased roles for the Māori language. In the 2011 election, the party wanted to require that all secondary schools offer the language as an option to every student.

<text>Rātana () is a Māori Christian church and movement, headquartered at Rātana Pā near Whanganui, New Zealand. The Rātana movement began in 1918, when Tahupōtiki Wiremu (T. W.) Ratana claimed to experience visions, and began a mission of faith healing. In 1925 the Ratana Church was formed, and on 25 January 1928—T. W.&#x27;s 55th birthday, and &quot;Rātana Day&quot;—the church&#x27;s iconic temple, (&#x27;the holy temple of Jehovah&#x27;) was opened. From its beginning and through to the 20th century, the church has pursued political goals, and still welcomes political leaders to the Rātana Pā annually on Ratana&#x27;s birthday. In the 2018 New Zealand census, 43,821 people identified with the religion.

Initially performing his healing from his family farm, Ratana did not regard his movement as a distinct church, and encouraged his followers to remain with their churches. He received mixed opinions from other Christian leaders, some of whom disliked that he was referred to as the , or the &#x27;mouthpiece&#x27; of God, while others were pleased at his renouncement of traditional Māori religion and . 

Ratana and his followers were interested in a political movement alongside a spiritual one, and Ratana was known to talk of the Bible in his right hand, and the Treaty of Waitangi in his left. This political attitude was made clear by 1924, when Ratana led a delegation to Europe to present a petition to King George V on the topic of Māori land confiscations and the treaty. From 1928, and the opening of the church&#x27;s temple, T. W. had suggested that his own attention would turn away from the church, and his focus would be more fully on politics. This coincided with controversy around Ratana himself, but he was largely unable to extricate himself from the matters of the church, and without a suitable replacement, he remained as the church&#x27;s leader. 

In a 1932 by-election, Rātana had its first candidate, Eruera Tirikatene, elected to parliament for the Southern Maori electorate, and by 1943 had captured all four of the Māori seats—a monopoly it would hold until 1963. By 1931, Rātana had established an alliance with the Labour Party, and Rātana members of parliament consistently backed Labour. In 1936 this alliance was formalised, and Rātana members joined Labour. In the early 2000s, members of other parties began attending Rātana Day, which is now seen as the beginning of New Zealand&#x27;s political year.

== History ==
T. W. Ratana&#x27;s grandfather Ngahina was a signatory of the Treaty of Waitangi for the tribes of Ngā Wairiki and Ngāti Apa. Ngahina was a sheep and cattle station owner, Anglican and pro-government loyalist. Rātana&#x27;s mother was Methodist. 

Impacts on Māori in 1918 included land loss, World War I and the Spanish flu epidemic. After the epidemic Rātana was the only male heir of his grandfather. On 8 November 1918 Rātana saw a vision, which he regarded as divinely inspired, asking him to preach the gospel to the Māori people and to cure the spirits and bodies of his people. 

Mere Rikiriki had an influence on Rātana and the Rātana movement. Rikiriki taught Rātana and he often consulted her. She had been at Parihaka with Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kākahi, had established her own church in Parewanui and was a faith healer and rongoā practitioner. Rikiriki foretold the coming of a new prophet in 1912 that she confirmed was Rātana.

Te Urumanao Ngāpaki Baker was a Māori chief and supported the Rātana movement and was Rātana&#x27;s wife.

=== &quot;Ture Wairua&quot; (spiritual mission) ===
The church&#x27;s spiritual laws are itemised as the Trinity (the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit) as well as adding , &#x27;the Holy and Faithful Angels&#x27; and (God&#x27;s Word and Wisdom) to prayers. As well as the Bible, the church relies on their &quot;Blue Book&quot; for church services, which includes hymns and prayers written by T. W. Ratana.

Until 1924 Ratana preached to increasingly large numbers of Māori and established a name for himself as the &quot;Māori Miracle Man&quot;. At first, the movement was seen as a Christian revival, but it soon moved away from mainstream churches. On 31 May 1925, &quot;Te Haahi Rātana&quot;, the Rātana Church, was established, and its founder was acknowledged in the Church&#x27;s doctrine as the bearer of &quot;Te Mangai&quot; or God&#x27;s Word and Wisdom. On 21 July 1925, the constitution of the Rātana Church was accepted by the Registrar-General and a list of &quot;apostles&quot; (ministers) who were authorised to conduct marriages was published in the &quot;New Zealand Gazette&quot;.

=== &quot;Ture Tangata&quot; (secular movement) ===

In 1924 a group of 38 people including Rātana and his wife Te Urumanao Ngāpaki Baker and spokesperson Pita Moko journeyed to Europe to unsuccessfully present a petition to George V and the League of Nations on land confiscations and the Treaty of Waitangi. Later trips were made to the United States and Canada. These trips were not without controversy. The New Zealand Government acted to prevent the petition being presented to the monarch, and the visit to Japan on the way back from Europe created allegations of disloyalty and of flying the Japanese flag over the church settlement of Rātana Pā.

When the Rātana temple (&#x27;the holy temple of Jehovah&#x27;) which Rātana saw as embodying in its architecture deep Biblical truths (especially the two magnificent bell towers) was opened on 25 January 1928 by Japanese Bishop Juji Nakada (with whom Ratana and party had stayed in 1924), Rātana declared his spiritual work was complete and church apostles and officers would take on the work. He now turned more to political work for Māori in New Zealand.

=== &quot;Koata&quot; (political movement) ===

As early as 1923, Rātana had declared an interest in party politics, and his eldest son Haami Tokouru Rātana had stood for the Western Maori electorate as an independent candidate. Now Rātana was determined to capture the Māori electorates to give a voice for his movement.

In January 1928, Rātana called himself and called on four followers to be the quarters of his body and rule the land. The &quot;first cut&quot; was Paraire Karaka Paikea in the north, Haami Tokouru Rātana in the west, Pita Moko in the east, and Eruera Tirikatene in the south. Moko was later replaced by Tiaki Omana, in the &quot;second cut&quot;. The covenant signed by the men promised they would not rest, and their wives separately agreed that they would go barefoot and in rags to represent the Rātana movement. All four went on to capture the Maori seats between 1932 and 1943.

Rātana candidates stood in the 1928 and 1931 general elections and in the 1930 by-election in Western Maori following the death of Maui Pomare, but they did not succeed. The first Rātana movement MP was Eruera Tirikatene, elected in a by-election for Southern Maori in June 1932. He was followed by Haami Tokouru Rātana (known as Toko) in Western Maori in the 1935 general election. In the 1938 election, the third Māori electorate of Northern Maori was captured by Paraire Karaka Paikea, and the last (Eastern Maori) was won by Tiaki Omana in the 1943 election.

The Rātana Independent Members of Parliament were the first to represent a political party in which most party members were Māori. Major aims of the movement were statutory recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi, righting the confiscation grievances of the Māori people, and equality in social welfare for Māori.

Politicians usually attend the Rātana marae to take part in celebrations marking T.W. Ratana&#x27;s birthday and in January 2023 it was the 150th anniversary. The political party leaders who attended on this occasion were Labour, National, Māori Party, New Zealand First and one co-leader of Greens. Commentator Merepeka Raukawa-Tait stated the message from Māori speakers to the politicians were: &quot;They want to have relationships that are more than transactional and they are not interested in politics and politicians that stir up fear.&quot;

==== Alliance with the Labour Party ====
Following the formation of the First Labour Government in 1935, the two Rātana MPs agreed to vote with Labour. This alliance was formalised with the Rātana movement joining the Labour Party in a meeting between Rātana and Prime Minister Michael Savage on 22 April 1936. The Prime Minister was given four symbolic gifts: a potato, a broken gold watch, a pounamu hei-tiki, and a huia feather. The potato represented loss of Māori land and means of sustenance, the broken watch represented the broken promises of the Treaty of Waitangi, and the pounamu represented the mana of the Māori people. If Savage could restore these three, he would earn the right to wear the huia feather to signify his chiefly status. The gifts were regarded as so precious they were buried with Savage at his state funeral in 1940.

The four Māori electorates were held by Rātana-affiliated members of Labour for decades: until 1963 for the Eastern Maori electorate, 1980 for Northern Maori, and 1996 for Western and Southern Maori electorates. Not all Labour Party Māori MPs have been members of the Rātana Church, but all Māori electorates were held by Labour MPs who had at least been endorsed by the church until Tau Henare won Northern Maori in the 1993 New Zealand general election. In both the parliaments of 1946–1948 and 1957–1960, the formation of a Labour Government depended on the votes of the Rātana Movement members. 

Rātana movement Members of Parliament have included Tapihana Paraire Paikea, Haami Tokouru Rātana, Matiu Rātana, Iriaka Rātana, Koro Wētere, Paraone Reweti, Matiu Rata, and Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan. Mita Ririnui, who held the Māori seat of Waiariki from 1999 to 2005 and was a List MP from 2005 to 2011, is a Rātana minister.

== Symbols ==
The main symbol (&quot;tohu&quot;) of the church is a five-pointed star and crescent moon, the &quot;whetū mārama&quot; (which means both &quot;star and moon&quot; and &quot;shining star&quot;), which is worn on the lapels of &quot;mōrehu&quot; (the scattered remnant, Rātana followers) and at pivotal points on church buildings. The golden or blue crescent moon (symbolising enlightenment) can face different parts of the coloured star: blue represents Te Matua (The Father), white is Te Tama (The Son), red is Te Wairua Tapu (The Holy Spirit), purple is Ngā Anahera Pono (The Faithful Angels) and gold/yellow is Te Māngai (The Mouthpiece (of Jehovah), Ture Wairua), although this colour is sometimes replaced with pink, representing PiriWiriTua (The Campaigner (of Political Matters), Ture Tangata). &quot;Te Whetū Mārama&quot; represents the kingdom of light or &quot;Māramatanga&quot;, standing firm against the forces of darkness (&quot;mākutu&quot;).

== Membership ==
Church adherents are known as , the &#x27;remnants&#x27;. In the 2001 census, 48,975 New Zealand residents were affiliated with the Rātana church. In the 2018 New Zealand census, 43,821 people identified with the religion.

<text>In class-based, object-oriented programming, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e., a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable has similarities with a class variable, but is non-static. An instance variable is a variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks. Instance variables are created when an object is instantiated, and are accessible to all the constructors, methods, or blocks in the class. Access modifiers can be given to the instance variable.

An instance variable is not a class variable, although there are similarities. Both are a type of class attribute (or class property, field, or data member). While an instance variable&#x27;s value may differ between instances of a class, a class variable can only have one value at any one time, shared between all instances. The same dichotomy between &quot;instance&quot; and &quot;class&quot; members applies to methods (&quot;member functions&quot;) as well.

Each instance variable lives in memory for the lifetime of the object it is owned by.

Instance variables are properties of that object. All instances of a class have their own copies of instance variables, even if the value is the same from one object to another. One class instance can change values of its instance variables without affecting all other instances. A class may have both instance variables and class variables.

Instance variables can be used by all instance methods of an object, but may not be used by class methods. An instance variable may also be changed directly, provided access restrictions are set.

==Examples==

=== C++ ===

struct Request {

 static int count1; // variable name is not important
 int number;

 Request() {
 number = count1; // modifies the instance variable &quot;this-&gt;number&quot;
 ++count1; // modifies the class variable &quot;Request::count1&quot;


int Request::count1 = 0;
In this C++ example, the instance variable codice_1 is a copy of the class variable codice_2 where each instance constructed is assigned a sequential value of codice_3 before it is incremented. Since codice_4 is an instance variable, each codice_5 object contains its own distinct value; in contrast, there is only one object codice_2 available to all class instances with the same value.

=== Java ===

//Example.java

class Example {
 public int x = 0;
 public void setX(int newValue) {
 this.x = newValue;
}

//Main.java

class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Example example1 = new Example();
 Example example2 = new Example();
 //We can set the value of x by itself, as the variable is public
 example1.x = 10;
 assert example1.x == 10;
 assert example2.x == 0;
 //As setX is an instance method, it can also access the variable
 example2.setX(-10);
 assert example1.x == 10;
 assert example2.x == -10;
}
In this Java example, we can see how instance variables can be modified in one instance without affecting another.

=== Python ===

class Dog:
 def __init__(self, breed):
 self.breed = breed # instance variable

# dog_1 is an object
# which is also an instance of the Dog class
dog_1 = Dog(&quot;Border Collie&quot;)
In the above Python code, the instance variable is created when an argument is parsed into the instance, with the specification of the breed positional argument.

<text>The Imperial British Conservative Party was a farcical political party founded by The Wizard of New Zealand in 1974. It &quot;stood for the traditions of British imperialism in the face of capitalism, globalisation and the distinct lack of culture in Christchurch, New Zealand.&quot; It was still operating in 1984, though news reports also referred to it as The Wizard Party.

The party contested the on a platform of conserving the monarchy, waging a fourth world war using votes and notices of motion to convert everyone to the British way of life, and the elimination of work to strengthen the family. It planned to stand a dozen candidates. The party stood a candidate in the 1976 Nelson by-election, where a tabulation error in their final results was attributed to a &quot;hex&quot; placed by the Wizard.

For the it changed its name to the Tory Party. It later ran a candidate in the 1980 Onehunga by-election.

At the it ran a candidate against Geoffrey Palmer. It also ran candidates at the .

== Activity in Australia ==

The Imperial British Conservative Party also had a presence in Australia, especially during the republican debate of the 1990s. The party ran three candidates at the 1983 Australian federal election.

One of its candidates, Cecil G. Murgatroyd, had run for parliament in several Australian federal elections, at each time standing against the Prime Minister (initially Bob Hawke), and in the 1992 Wills by-election after Hawke resigned from parliament. In official statements, Murgatroyd listed his occupation as &quot;dole bludger&quot;. At other times, Murgatroyd stood under the banner of another New Zealand joke party, the McGillicuddy Serious Party.

In one Australian election in the 1980s, the party promised to dye the Speaker&#x27;s wig a conservative blue.

Another candidate, James Ferrari (at one point contesting as Jim Ferrari) ran for the party in the seat of Melbourne at every election from 1980 until 2001.

<text>In ancient Rome, imperium was a form of authority held by a citizen to control a military or governmental entity. It is distinct from &quot;auctoritas&quot; and &quot;potestas&quot;, different and generally inferior types of power in the Roman Republic and Empire. One&#x27;s &quot;imperium&quot; could be over a specific military unit, or it could be over a province or territory. Individuals given such power were referred to as curule magistrates or promagistrates. These included the curule aedile, the praetor, the consul, the &quot;magister equitum&quot;, and the dictator. In a general sense, &quot;imperium&quot; was the scope of someone&#x27;s power, and could include anything, such as public office, commerce, political influence, or wealth.

== Ancient Rome ==
&quot;Imperium&quot; originally meant absolute or kingly power—the word being derived from the Latin verb &quot;imperare&quot; (to command)—which became somewhat limited under the Republic by the collegiality of the republican magistrates and the right of appeal, or &quot;provocatio&quot;, on the part of citizens. &quot;Imperium&quot; remained absolute in the army, and the power of the &quot;imperator&quot; (army commander) to punish remained uncurtailed. The title &quot;imperator&quot; later was exclusively held by the emperor, as the commander of the armed forces. In fact, the Latin word &quot;imperator&quot; is the root of the English word &quot;emperor&quot;.

In ancient Rome, &quot;imperium&quot; could be used as a term indicating a characteristic of people, their wealth in property, or the measure of formal power they had. This qualification could be used in a rather loose context (for example, poets used it, not necessarily writing about state officials). However, in Roman society, it was also a more formal concept of legal authority. A man with &quot;imperium&quot; (an &quot;imperator&quot;) had, in principle, absolute authority to apply the law within the scope of his magistracy or promagistracy. He could be vetoed or overruled either by a magistrate or promagistrate who was a colleague with equal power (e.g., a fellow consul), by one whose &quot;imperium&quot; outranked his – that is, one of &quot;imperium maius&quot; (greater &quot;imperium&quot;), or by a tribune of the plebs.

Some modern scholars such as A. H. M. Jones have defined &quot;imperium&quot; as &quot;the power vested by the state in a person to do what he considers to be in the best interests of the state&quot;.

&quot;Imperium&quot; was indicated in two prominent ways: a &quot;curule&quot; magistrate or promagistrate carried an ivory baton surmounted by an eagle as his personal symbol of office; any such magistrate was also escorted by &quot;lictors&quot; bearing the &quot;fasces&quot; (traditional symbols of &quot;imperium&quot; and authority), when outside the &quot;pomerium&quot;, axes being added to the &quot;fasces&quot; to indicate an imperial magistrate&#x27;s power to inflict capital punishment outside Rome (the axes being removed within the &quot;pomerium&quot;). The number of lictors in attendance upon a magistrate was an overt indication of the degree of &quot;imperium&quot;. When in the field, a &quot;curule&quot; magistrate possessing an &quot;imperium&quot; greater or equal to that of a praetor wore a sash ritually knotted on the front of his cuirass. Furthermore, any man executing &quot;imperium&quot; within his sphere of influence was entitled to the curule chair.

* Curule aedile (&quot;aedilis curulis&quot;) – 2 lictors
** Since a plebeian aedile (aedilis plebis) was not vested with imperium, he was not escorted by lictors.
* &quot;Magister equitum&quot; (the dictator&#x27;s deputy) – 6 lictors
* Praetor – 6 lictors (2 lictors within the pomerium)
* Consul – 12 lictors each
* Dictator – 24 lictors outside the pomerium and 12 inside; starting from the dictatorship of Lucius Sulla the latter rule was ignored.
** To symbolize that the dictator could enact capital punishment within Rome as well as without, his lictors did not remove the axes from their fasces within the pomerium.

As can be seen, dictatorial &quot;imperium&quot; was superior to consular, consular to praetorian, and praetorian to aedilician; there is some historical dispute as to whether or not praetorian &quot;imperium&quot; was superior to &quot;equine-magisterial&quot; &quot;imperium&quot;. A promagistrate, or a man executing a &quot;curule&quot; office without actually holding that office, also possessed &quot;imperium&quot; in the same degree as the actual incumbents (i.e., proconsular &quot;imperium&quot; being more or less equal to consular &quot;imperium&quot;, propraetorian &quot;imperium&quot; to praetorian) and was attended by an equal number of &quot;lictors&quot;.

Certain extraordinary commissions, such as Pompey&#x27;s famous command against the pirates, were invested with &quot;imperium maius&quot;, meaning they outranked all other holders of &quot;imperium&quot; of the same type or rank (in Pompey&#x27;s case, even the consuls) within their sphere of command (his being &quot;ultimate on the seas, and within 50 miles inland&quot;). &quot;Imperium maius&quot; later became a hallmark of the Roman emperor.

Another technical use of the term in Roman law was for the power to extend the law beyond its mere interpretation, extending &quot;imperium&quot; from formal legislators under the ever-republican constitution: popular assemblies, senate, magistrates, emperor and their delegates to the jurisprudence of jurisconsults.

== Later Roman Empire ==
While the Byzantine Eastern Roman Emperors retained full Roman &quot;imperium&quot; and made the episcopate subservient, in the feudal West a long rivalry would oppose the claims to supremacy within post-Roman Christianity between &quot;sacerdotium&quot; in the person of the Pope and the secular &quot;imperium&quot; of the Holy Roman Emperor, beginning with Charlemagne, whose title was claimed to have &quot;restored&quot; the office of Western Roman Emperor among the new kingdoms of Western Europe. Both would refer to the heritage of Roman law by their titular link with the very city of Rome: the Pope, Bishop &quot;of Rome&quot;, versus the Holy &quot;Roman&quot; Emperor (even though his seat of power was north of the Alps).

The &quot;Donatio Constantini&quot;, by which the Papacy had allegedly been granted the territorial Patrimonium Petri in Central Italy, became a weapon against the Emperor. The first pope who used it in an official act and relied upon it, Leo IX, cites the &quot;Donatio&quot; in a letter of 1054 to Michael Cærularius, Patriarch of Constantinople, to show that the Holy See possessed both an earthly and a heavenly &quot;imperium&quot;, the royal priesthood. Thenceforth, the &quot;Donatio&quot; acquires more importance and is more frequently used as evidence in the ecclesiastical and political conflicts between the papacy and the secular power: Anselm of Lucca and Cardinal Deusdedit inserted it in their collections of canons; Gratian excluded it from his &quot;Decretum&quot;, but it was soon added to it as &quot;Palea&quot;; the ecclesiastical writers in defence of the papacy during the conflicts of the early part of the 12th century quoted it as authoritative.

In one bitter episode, Pope Gregory IX, who had several times mediated between the Lombards and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, reasserted his right to arbitrate between the contending parties. In the numerous manifestos of the Pope and the Emperor the antagonism between Church and State became more evident: the Pope claimed for himself the &quot;imperium animarum&quot; (&quot;command of the souls&quot;, i.e. voicing God&#x27;s will to the faithful) and the &quot;principatus rerum et corporum in universo mundo&quot; (&quot;primacy over all things and bodies in the whole world&quot;), while the Emperor wished to restore the &quot;imperium mundi&quot;, &quot;imperium&quot; (as under Roman Law) over the (now Christian) world. Rome was again to be the capital of the world and Frederick was to become the real emperor of the Romans, so he energetically protested against the authority of the Pope. The emperor&#x27;s successes, especially his victory over the Lombards at the battle of Cortenuova (1237), only aggravated tensions between Church and State. The pope again excommunicated the &quot;self-confessed heretic&quot;, the &quot;blasphemous beast of the Apocalypse&quot; (20 March 1239) who now attempted to conquer the rest of Italy (i.e., the papal states, et cetera).

<text>The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful is an American folk-rock band formed in Greenwich Village, New York City, in 1964. The band were among the most popular groups in the United States for a short period in the mid-1960s and their music and image influenced many of the contemporary rock acts of their era. Beginning in July1965 with their debut single &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot;, the band had seven consecutive singles reach the Top Ten of the U.S. charts in the eighteen months that followed, including the number-two hits &quot;Daydream&quot; and &quot;Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?&quot; and the chart-topping &quot;Summer in the City&quot;.

Led by their primary songwriter John Sebastian, the Spoonful took their earliest influences from jug band and blues music, reworking them into a popular music format. In 1965, the band helped pioneer the development of the musical genre of folk rock. By 1966, the group were &quot;one of the most highly regarded American and they were the year&#x27;s third-best-selling singles act in the U.S., after the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. As psychedelia expanded in popularity in 1967, the Spoonful struggled to transition their approach and saw diminished sales before disbanding in 1968.

Before they founded the Spoonful, Sebastian (guitar, harmonica, autoharp, vocals) and Zal Yanovsky (guitar, vocals) were active in Greenwich Village&#x27;s folk-music scene. Aiming to create an &quot;electric jug band&quot;, they recruited the local rock musicians Steve Boone (bass guitar) and Joe Butler (drums, vocals). The four-piece lineup honed their sound at New York nightclubs before they began recording for Kama Sutra Records with the producer Erik Jacobsen. In May1966, at the height of the band&#x27;s success, Yanovsky and Boone were arrested for marijuana possession in San Francisco. The pair revealed their drug source to authorities to avoid Yanovsky being deported to his native Canada, an action which generated tensions within the group. Due to disagreements over their artistic direction, the band fired Yanovsky in May1967, replacing him with Jerry Yester, and Yanovsky commenced a brief and commercially unsuccessful solo career. The original iteration of the Spoonful last publicly performed in June1968, after which time Sebastian departed the group and pursued a briefly successful solo career. The band dissolved later that year.

In 2000, the Spoonful were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, an occasion that saw Sebastian, Yanovsky, Boone and Butler perform together for the last time. Yanovsky died of a heart attack two years later. Sebastian has remained active as a solo act, and Boone, Butler and Yester began touring under the name &quot;the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&quot; in 1991.

== History ==
=== 1964–1965: Formation ===
==== Greenwich Village and folk music ====

The co-founders of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful – John Sebastian and Zal Yanovsky – met on February 9, 1964, at the apartment of Cass Elliot, a mutual friend and fellow musician. Elliot was holding a party that night to watch the English rock band the Beatles make their American television debut on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Elliot, Sebastian and Yanovsky were all active in the folk-music scene in Greenwich Village, a neighborhood in New York City, and the three were greatly influenced by the Beatles&#x27; performance; Sebastian later reflected, &quot;It affected heavily... [meaning] my specific generation&quot;. Later that night, Elliot encouraged Sebastian and Yanovsky to play guitars, and Sebastian remembered discovering they had &quot;a tremendous affinity&quot; for one another.

Sebastian, the son of the classical harmonica player John Sebastian Sr., grew up in a Village apartment which neighbored Washington Square Park. The younger Sebastian often went to the park to play music, and he also played in rock bands as a teenager at his prep school in New Jersey. He became a multi-instrumentalist, being proficient on guitar, harmonica, piano and the autoharp. Beginning in the early 1960s, he worked as a studio musician.

Yanovsky grew up in Downsview, a suburb of Toronto, Canada, and he was enmeshed as a guitar player in the city&#x27;s folk-music scene, which centered on the Yorkville neighborhood. Denny Doherty, another musician active in Yorkville, invited Yanovsky to join his folk group, the Halifax Three, which later relocated to Greenwich Village. After the Halifax Three broke up in June1964, Elliot recruited Yanovsky and Doherty to join her own group, the Mugwumps. That same year, Sebastian briefly played with another New York folk group, the Even Dozen Jug Band, before he was also recruited into the Mugwumps to play harmonica.

Sebastian later remembered becoming enamoured with Yanovsky: &quot;[He] amused the hell out of me. He inhaled and exhaled people and conversation and jokes and theater. He was this kind of cultural weathervane – and people gathered around him.&quot; During live performances with the Mugwumps, rather than playing folk songs straight through, Yanovsky and Sebastian often improvised off of one another on guitar and harmonica, respectively. After the Mugwumps dissolved in late1964, Sebastian and Yanovsky began planning to form their own group, which they envisioned as an electric jug band. Sebastian recalled: &quot;Yanovsky and I were both aware of the fact that this commercial folk music model was about to change again, that the four-man band that actually played their own instruments and wrote their own songs was the thing.&quot; Yanovsky contacted Bob Cavallo, the former manager of the Halifax Three and the Mugwumps, who agreed to manage Sebastian and Yanovsky&#x27;s group even though they had not yet performed publicly, had no songs and did not yet have a band name.

In 1964, Sebastian lived in an apartment on Prince Street in Little Italy, a Manhattan neighborhood south of Greenwich Village. That year, Erik Jacobsen, the former banjo player of the bluegrass band Knob Lick Upper 10,000, moved into the apartment next door, and the two soon bonded over their shared interests of smoking marijuana and listening to eclectic music. Like Sebastian, Jacobsen had been affected by the new sound of the Beatles; he later recalled that while touring in early1964, he listened to the group for the first time on a jukebox: &quot;I decided, kind of then and there I think, that I was gonna quit the Knob Lick Upper 10,000, and go to New York City, and produced electric folk music.&quot; As part of his effort to switch focus towards production, Jacobsen recorded demos for musicians in the Village, including Sebastian&#x27;s compositions &quot;Warm Baby&quot; and 

==== Earliest lineup ====

From 1962 to 1964, Steve Boone played bass guitar in several Long Island rock bands with the drummer Joe Butler. They both played in the Kingsmen, a band led by Boone&#x27;s brother, Skip, before Boone quit in mid-1964 to spend time visiting Europe. Skip and Butler changed the band&#x27;s name to &quot;the Sellouts&quot; and moved to Greenwich Village, holding a residency at Trude Heller&#x27;s club as one of the neighborhood&#x27;s earliest rock groups.

In December1964, at the insistence of Butler, Boone went to the Village Music Hall, a small music club on West 3rd Street in Greenwich Village. There, he met Sebastian and Yanovsky, and though he had no background in folk music, Boone soon bonded with the two over their shared musical influences, including Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, Motown, the Beatles and other British Invasion acts. Sebastian played him his composition &quot;Good Time Music&quot; – the lyrics of which derided early 1960s rock and roll while extolling the Beatles and other new music – and the three musicians jammed different Chuck Berry and R&amp;B numbers. Sebastian invited Boone to Jacobsen&#x27;s apartment afterwards, where Boone met Jacobsen as well as Jerry Yester of the Modern Folk Quartet, a local folk music group. That week, Boone attended Sebastian&#x27;s performance at a Greenwich Village club. Sebastian&#x27;s show, made up of a quickly assembled group of Fred Neil, Tim Hardin, Buzzy Linhart and Felix Pappalardi, greatly impressed Boone, who later remembered it as &quot;one of the most significant nights in my musical life.&quot; He also recalled: &quot;I was stunned. I had never heard such power in a folk group before.&quot; The performance motivated Boone to enter the Greenwich Village folk scene and join Sebastian and Yanovsky&#x27;s group.

The band was still in need of a drummer, and Boone suggested Jan Buchner, a part-timer with the Kingsmen who came at the recommendation of both Skip and Butler. Buchner, who went by the stagename Jan Carl, was the manager of the Bull&#x27;s Head Inn, a small inn located in Bridgehampton on Long Island, and which he offered as a rehearsal space during the inn&#x27;s winter closure. The band rehearsed at the Bull&#x27;s Head for several weeks in December1964 and January1965, and they also played at local bars in Bridgehampton at night.

In late1964 and early1965, to keep earning money before his new band had earned a contract, Sebastian continued performing as a studio musician on other artists&#x27; recordings. In this period, he played harmonica on progressive folk records for several acts, including Fred Neil, Jesse Colin Young and Judy Collins. In January1965, the musician Bob Dylan asked Sebastian to play bass guitar on his newest album, &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;. The album&#x27;s first day of sessions, January13, featured only Dylan on an acoustic guitar and, for a few tracks, Sebastian playing bass guitar, but none of the recordings were used on the final album. Dylan returned the next day to re-record much of the material, rearranging the songs attempted the day before so they instead featured an electric backing. Dylan invited Sebastian to return for a separate session held that evening, in which they recorded a remake of the song &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;. Boone – one of the few people Sebastian knew with a car and driver&#x27;s license – offered to drive him to the session. Sebastian was not a trained bass player and, after struggling to play the part, he suggested that Boone play instead, but neither musician&#x27;s contributions ended up on the final album.

==== First live dates ====

In early1965, in preparation for their first public performances, Sebastian, Yanovsky, Boone and Carl continued rehearsing at the Bull&#x27;s Head, while Sebastian and Yanovsky searched for a group name. Fritz Richmond, the washtub bass player for the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, suggested to Sebastian the name &quot;the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&quot;, a reference to the lyrics of the song &quot;Coffee Blues&quot; by the country blues musician Mississippi John Hurt, with whom Sebastian had previously worked. Sebastian and Yanovsky were enthusiastic about the suggestion and adopted it as the band&#x27;s name.

Joe Marra, the owner of Greenwich Village&#x27;s Night Owl Cafe, knew Sebastian from his time backing other artists at the club, and Marra offered to book the Spoonful at the venue. The Night Owl was formerly an after-hours bowling alley at West 3rd and MacDougal Streets, which Marra had recently converted into a 125-person capacity coffeehouse and restaurant for folk music acts. The band made their first live performances in late January 1965 at the Night Owl, holding a two-week residency. One show, which Jacobsen recorded on a tape recorder, featured a mixture of Sebastian&#x27;s originals (&quot;Good Time Music&quot; and &quot;Didn&#x27;t Want to Have to Do It&quot;), folk songs (&quot;Wild About My Lovin and &quot;My Gal&quot;) and rock and roll (&quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Alley Oop&quot; and &quot;Almost Grown&quot;). The band received a mixed reception, due in part to their loud playing style in the small venue. Marra was unimpressed and returned to booking folk acts. Cavallo and Jacobsen recommended rehearsals and that the band replace Carl as drummer. Carl, who was six years older than his bandmates, clashed with them in terms of appearance and playing style, and he was subsequently fired by the band&#x27;s management.


Having fired Carl, the Spoonful could no longer play at the Bull&#x27;s Head and were in need of a new rehearsal space. The band had little money and had been living with Elliot in her Village apartment at the Hotel Albert. The Albert was frequented by many local folk musicians, and the building&#x27;s proprietors allowed musicians staying there to rehearse in its basement, a decaying space with standing pools of water, chipping walls and a bug infestation. While at the Albert, the band befriended one of the building&#x27;s permanent residents, Butchie Webber, who often fed them meals. Though the two were not romantic, Webber married Sebastian, so as to prevent him from being drafted into fighting in the Vietnam War. Butler, who still played drums for the Sellouts, auditioned for the Spoonful in the Albert&#x27;s basement. He impressed the others when he broke a drumstick but continued performing by hitting the cymbal with his hand, cutting it in the process. The band were inspired by Butler&#x27;s energy and hired him as their drummer.

While waiting to be signed to a record label, the Spoonful played at night clubs on MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village, including Cafe Wha? and Café Bizarre. The band held a brief residency at Café Bizarre, playing several sets a night for six days a week, leading Sebastian to later reflect, &quot;We learned more at that crappy little club than almost any other gig.&quot; Marra had been especially critical of the band&#x27;s earlier performances at the Night Owl, but he was impressed by the band&#x27;s newly professional approach, and in May of 1965, he offered for the band to return to performing at the Night Owl. The Spoonful shared their bill at the club with two other electric groups whom Marra booked, Danny Kalb&#x27;s band the Blues Project and the Modern Folk Quartet, the latter of which Sebastian sometimes filled in for on drums. The Night Owl&#x27;s triple-bill was immediately successful, and other established acts sometimes came to watch, including members of the American band the Byrds and Mary Travers of the folk-trio Peter, Paul and Mary. Around the time he began booking electric acts, Marra moved the venue&#x27;s stage towards the front street-facing window to draw in passers-by, and he printed a large color photo of the Spoonful and placed it in the club&#x27;s window, which helped elevate the band&#x27;s local popularity.

On June7 and 8, 1965, the Spoonful performed at Club 47, a folk music club in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Boone remembered feeling hesitant to perform at a club known strictly for folk music, but Sebastian recalled that he and Yanovsky were immediately enthusiastic at the prospect of challenging folk enthusiasts: &quot;Did we want to in that room!... We were going to be face to face with the folkies at last.&quot; The band played at the venue at the suggestion of Fritz Richmond, who encouraged the group by pointing to Bob Dylan&#x27;s recent transition to electrified rock, first heard three months earlier with the release of &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, and the newfound popularity of the Byrds, whose folk rock cover of Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; reached number one in North America that month. The term &quot;folk rock&quot; had been coined in the June12 issue of the American music magazine &quot;Billboard&quot; by the journalist Eliot Siegel, who used the term principally to describe the music of the Byrds. Siegel also counted &quot;the Living Spoonfull&quot; as an act working in the New York area with &quot;a folk-rock sound&quot;, even though the group had not yet released a record.

The Spoonful performed two sets at Club 47 and initially received a mixed reception; many folk fans walked out of the first set due to the band&#x27;s loud sound. During the second set, the band received a warm response from the remaining crowd. In retrospect, the author Richie Unterberger describes the Spoonful&#x27;s appearance as a &quot;watershed&quot; moment in the history of folk rock. The rock journalist Paul Williams attended the shows, and his review of the performances for the magazine &quot;Folkin&#x27; Around&quot; marked his earliest work as a music writer. Williams later reflected, &quot;For a band like that to come to Club 47 was revolutionary, in terms of Cambridge[&#x27;s] holier-than-thou purist attitude about folk music.&quot;

==== &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot;, Kama Sutra ====

Early in the Spoonful&#x27;s May residency at the Night Owl, Sebastian wrote a new song, &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot;, which explored the transformative power of music. His initial inspiration came during one of the band&#x27;s performances, in which he and Yanovsky noticed a sixteen-year-old girl dancing among the audience. The girl stood in contrast to the older beatnik crowd who typically attended folk performances, and Sebastian recalled that &quot;[she was] dancing like danced – and not like the last generation danced&quot;. He also remembered: &quot;Zal and I just elbowed each other the entire night, because to us, that young girl symbolized the fact that our audience was changing, that maybe they had finally found us.&quot; Sebastian composed the song the following night, and the band worked together at the Albert to finish its arrangement.

The Spoonful was enthusiastic about &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot; and hoped to record a demo of the song to flog to record companies. In June1965, Jacobsen fronted a session with his own money at Bell Sound Studios in New York, where the band recorded &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot; and several other songs. Jacobsen invited Yester to participate in the session, adding both piano and backing vocals, and the session musician Gary Chester played tambourine. Jacobsen and Cavallo brought an acetate disc of the demo to numerous record labels, all of which turned down an opportunity to sign the band. After attending one of the Spoonful&#x27;s performances at the Night Owl, Phil Spector, a well-known producer, listened to an acetate of &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot; and considered signing the band to his label, Philles Records. Recollections differ as to who turned whom down, but subsequent authors suggest that in writing their own music and possessing a defined sound, the Spoonful differed greatly from the acts with which Spector normally worked.

Elektra Records approached the Spoonful and offered to sign them. Elektra regularly produced acts from Greenwich Village, including the Even Dozen Jug Band and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. The label&#x27;s offer would have allowed the Spoonful to retain Jacobsen as their producer and Cavallo as their manager, but the band worried that Elektra had not been successful at issuing singles in the pop market, and that they would not be clearly identified as a rock act if they signed at a folk-oriented label. Cavallo approached Paul Rothchild and Jac Holzman of Elektra and said the band needed an advance of $10,000 before they could sign (). Holzman initially refused due to the large figure, but he soon changed his mind and offered the band a deal, by which point they had signed elsewhere. The band instead signed a side-deal with Elektra, which had them record four songs, including Sebastian&#x27;s song &quot;Good Time Music&quot;. Jacobsen later said that the band offered the songs to Elektra out of guilt, since &quot;We had kind of hung [Holzman] out to dry just a little bit... [so we] allowed him to have those sides. The label later included the four songs on the compilation album &quot;What&#x27;s Shakin&#x27;&quot;, released the following year.

The Spoonful signed with Koppelman-Rubin, an entertainment company, who signed the band to Kama Sutra Records in June1965. As part of the deal, MGM Records distributed the records, which Kama Sutra released for Koppelman-Rubin. The arrangement&#x27;s format of multiple middlemen left little in profits for the band. Sebastian later said that not signing with Elektra was &quot;the worst decision I ever made in my life&quot;.

Kama Sutra saw no need to re-record Jacobsen&#x27;s original demo of the Spoonful performing &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot;, and the label pressed copies to be the band&#x27;s debut single. The label issued it in the U.S. on July 20, 1965, and it debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 a month later, remaining on the chart for thirteen weeks and peaking in October at number nine.
=== 1965–1966: American popularity ===
==== Touring, debut album ====

The release of &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot; in July1965 propelled the Spoonful to nationwide fame in the U.S. within weeks. The band made their American television debut on the channel 10 show of the Miami disc jockey Rick Shaw, and they also taped appearances for the TV programs &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and &quot;The Lloyd Thaxton Show&quot;. In conjunction with the release of the single, the band&#x27;s management made plans for their first series of serious live dates outside of New York City. Beginning in August, the band toured the West Coast of the United States. In San Francisco, the band held a two-week residency at Mother&#x27;s Nightclub,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason 5/15/66&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which then advertised itself as the &quot;world&#x27;s first psychedelic nightclub&quot;, and on August7, they performed in-front of 35,000 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, as one of several support acts for the English pop group Herman&#x27;s Hermits, alongside the Turtles and the Bobby Fuller Four. In LosAngeles, the Spoonful played at several clubs on Sunset Strip, including Ciro&#x27;s, the Whisky a Go Go and The Crescendo (later renamed The Trip).

In October1965, the Spoonful returned to the West Coast, where their image and sound proved influential in the emerging San Francisco scene, particularly in the city&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury district, a center of the 1960s counterculture. The band appeared for a week at the hungry i, one of the most prominent clubs in America&#x27;s folk-music scene, where they were seen by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; jazz critic Ralph J. Gleason. In his review of their first show, Gleason described the band&#x27;s music and clothing as &quot;the expression of a new age&quot; and &quot;an expression of freedom&quot;. He concluded the band was &quot;vital and alive and, I believe, important&quot;. On October24,&lt;ref name=10/24/65&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the Spoonful headlined a dance party at the Longshoreman&#x27;s Union Hall in the city&#x27;s Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf neighborhood. Organized by the concert-production collective Family Dog Productions, the event combined rock music with light shows and psychedelic drugs, and it was among the earliest events of its kind in San Francisco; Jacobsen reflected, &quot;That whole idea of going and listening to music and getting high started there&quot;. In attendance at the Longshoreman&#x27;s show were members of the Grateful Dead, an acoustic-folk group, who were inspired by the Spoonful&#x27;s performance to similarly &quot;go electric&quot; in their style.

Amid their touring schedule, the Spoonful recorded tracks for their debut album, &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot;. The band recorded thirteen songs across several sessions between June and September1965, mostly at Bell Sound in New York, and they also recorded at RCA Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The band&#x27;s focus was on recording as quickly as possible, and a majority of the songs were jug band and blues covers taken from their typical live set list. The album&#x27;s five original compositions were all credited to Sebastian, including &quot;Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?&quot;, which he based on a experience as a child at summer camp when he fell in love with twin sisters. Pointing to the success of the Beatles and the Byrds, the Spoonful&#x27;s label encouraged the band to trade lead vocal responsibilities; on &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot;, Sebastian sings lead on most songs, but Butler also sings twice (&quot;You Baby&quot; and &quot;The Other Side of This Life&quot;) as does Yanovsky (&quot;Blues in the Bottle&quot;, &quot;On the Road Again&quot; and the unreleased &quot;Alley Oop&quot;). The album first went on sale on October23, 1965, when the band held an autograph session in Pleasant Hill, California, and Kama Sutra issued the album nationwide in November. It debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart on December 4, and it initially ran on the chart for 19 weeks, peaking in February1966 at number 71.

By late1965, the Spoonful had made appearances on the most popular American television variety shows, including &quot;Where the Action Is&quot;, &quot;Shindig!&quot; and &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;. Executives from NBC approached Cavallo and offered the band the opportunity to star in their own television series, &quot;The Monkees&quot;. The executives Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider met with the band in Manhattan and explained their idea for a comedy sitcom about a band seeking to make it big, styled similarly to the Beatles&#x27; 1964 film, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. Though excited at the prospect of being propelled quickly to a national audience, the band were unenthusiastic at the idea of having to change their name to &quot;The Monkees&quot; and were worried that their ability to create and play their own music would be limited by the venture. They declined the offer. Rafelson later said that the Spoonful was the only existing group considered for the show before they began auditioning individual actors and musicians in September1965.
==== &quot;Daydream&quot; ====

In November1965, the Spoonful embarked on a 19-day package-tour with the American girl group the Supremes. The acts performed at colleges across the southern U.S., beginning in Lafayette, Louisiana, on November10. Both acts traveled by bus and partied together, along with members of the Supremes&#x27; backing band, the Funk Brothers, billed as the Earl Van Dyke Orchestra. The Spoonful generally enjoyed the tour but found it physically exhausting. Sebastian additionally missed his girlfriend, Loretta &quot;Lorey&quot; Kaye. Near the tour&#x27;s end, in an effort to raise his own spirits, he composed &quot;Daydream&quot; while riding on the bus through North Carolina, drawing inspiration from the Supremes&#x27; 1964 singles &quot;Baby Love&quot; and &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot;. A stop in Savannah, Georgia inspired the beginnings of &quot;Jug Band Music&quot;, which Boone later said &quot;recalled pleasant visions of the tour&quot; for him and his bandmates.

At the conclusion of their tour with the Supremes, the Spoonful departed directly for Los Angeles, having been invited by Phil Spector to appear in the concert film &quot;The Big T.N.T. Show&quot;. After filming on 29–30November, the band remained in Los Angeles to do several weeks of a residency at the Trip, a short-lived nightclub on Sunset Boulevard, where Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys saw them perform. During their stay, the Spoonful befriended a local fashion designer, Jeannie Franklyn, who subsequently designed custom-clothing for Yanovsky. They also struck up a friendship with David Crosby, the rhythm guitarist of the Byrds. Crosby had spoken favorably of the Spoonful in interviews as early as August, often promising reporters that they would be the next big group. Both he and his bandmate Jim McGuinn had been familiar with Sebastian and Yanovsky since their earlier years playing folk with Cass Elliot, and the Spoonful, the Byrds and the Mamas &amp; the Papas remained on close terms in the mid-1960s.

Amid their busy TV and live-date schedule, the Spoonful recorded most of their second album &quot;Daydream&quot; in four days, from December13 to 16, at Bell Sound Studios in New York City. Some songs for the album were recorded in November, including &quot;You Didn&#x27;t Have to Be So Nice&quot;, and additional sessions took place at Columbia Studios in New York City and RCA Studios in Hollywood, California. Boone began &quot;You Didn&#x27;t Have to Be So Nice&quot; as a verse and a basic melodic figure, and Sebastian collaborated with him to complete the song. Kama Sutra issued the song as a non-album single on November13, and it peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in January1966. The sessions for &quot;Daydream&quot; came ten weeks after the band finished their first album, and the band had had little time to rehearse new material. Owing to the constraints, they recorded some Sebastian compositions which Jacobsen had rejected for inclusion on their debut album, including &quot;Didn&#x27;t Want to Have to Do It&quot; and &quot;Warm Baby&quot;. While &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot; contained just five original compositions, eleven out of twelve tracks on &quot;Daydream&quot; were original. Kama Sutra released the album in March1966 and it reached number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, making it the band&#x27;s best performing studio album.

Of the songs recorded for &quot;Daydream&quot;, Sebastian and Yanovsky hoped that their joint composition &quot;It&#x27;s Not Time Now&quot; would be issued as a single, but Kama Sutra denied the request out of fear that it was a protest song. The label instead issued &quot;Daydream&quot; in February1966. The song&#x27;s release fueled speculation from the press and public about a link between the band and drug use, as the press had often incorrectly speculated that &quot;the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&quot; alluded to the spoon used in injecting heroin. The increased speculation was partly driven by the lyrics&#x27; use of the term &quot;dream&quot;, which by 1966 was sometimes used to connote the experience of taking psychedelic drugs. Additionally, a trade ad in &quot;Billboard&quot; accompanying the single&#x27;s release made several drug allusions, drawing the ire of the band, who had regularly sought to distance themselves from drug associations.

&quot;Daydream&quot; remained on the Hot 100 for twelve weeks, peaking at number two for two weeks in mid-April. The single was kept from the top spot on &quot;Billboard&quot; chart by the Righteous Brothers&#x27; song &quot;(You&#x27;re My) Soul and Inspiration&quot;, but it reached number one on &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine&#x27;s chart and also reached the top spot in Canada. The song&#x27;s success expanded the Spoonful&#x27;s popularity such that they were often able to headline their concerts rather than perform as a support act. When the band toured the American South with the Beach Boys from April1 to 9, 1966, the two groups alternated top billing.

=== 1966: International popularity ===
==== &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Tiger Lily?&quot; soundtrack; European tour ====

Though the Spoonful had achieved quick success in North America, they remained generally unknown in the U.K. None of their singles had charted in the country. To expand the band&#x27;s popularity to an international audience, their management organized several live- and TV-dates in England and Sweden for April1966. Only days before the Spoonful was set to depart to Europe, they were approached to provide a soundtrack for &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Tiger Lily?&quot;, the directorial debut of the comedian Woody Allen, who knew the band from his work at clubs in Greenwich Village. The band recorded the soundtrack in two days, April 11 and 12, at National Recording Studios in New York City, and they made a brief appearance in the film. The film was a commercial disappointment and received mixed reviews. Issued in August1966, the soundtrack album reached number 126 on the Billboard LPs chart. Jacobsen later criticized the project as a &quot;goofball album&quot; which distracted the band and stalled their progress.

On April12, the Spoonful arrived at Heathrow Airport to begin their ten-day tour of England and Sweden. Problems which arose during negotiations with the British Musicians&#x27; Union forced the band to limit the number of appearances they made in Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Disc 5/14/66&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the tour&#x27;s first week, the band played concerts in Birmingham and Manchester, appeared on the television programs &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; and &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;, played on BBC Radio and attended a party at the London home of the Irish socialite Tara Browne. The band&#x27;s time in England allowed them to interact with many of Britain&#x27;s top musicians. On April18, they performed an invite-only show at the Marquee Club on Wardour Street, Soho, central London. Several of Britain&#x27;s top performers were in attendance, including John Lennon, George Harrison, Ray Davies, Brian Jones, Steve Winwood, Spencer Davis and Eric Clapton. The band were warmly received, and Lennon and Harrison joined them afterwards into the morning at The May Fair Hotel in Piccadilly. The next night, following their performance at the Blaises Club in Kensington, the band befriended Jones as well.

After flying to Stockholm to perform on Swedish television, the Spoonful proceeded to Ireland to attend the 21st-birthday celebration of Browne on April23. Browne, who then regarded the Spoonful as his favorite band, delayed his party by seven weeks in order to coincide with the band&#x27;s touring and recording schedule. Browne flew the band to Ireland at his own expense to perform a private show, paying them US$10,000 for the performance (). Held at the Luggala Estate, a Gothic Revival house in the Wicklow Mountains, the party was attended by many prominent Swinging London figures, including members of the Rolling Stones, Peter Bardens, Anita Pallenberg, Chrissie Shrimpton, John Paul Getty Jr., Rupert Lycett Green and Mike McCartney. Butler recalled that the band&#x27;s performance was likely substandard, since they were all drunk and high on marijuana. Several guests also partook in the drug LSD, including Butler, and the Spoonful stayed overnight.

The Spoonful flew back to the U.S. on April24,&lt;ref name=&quot;Disc 4/23/66&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and reports soon followed that they planned to return later in the year for more British shows. The band&#x27;s morale was high following the April tour, particularly after they had been treated as equals by contemporary performers whom they held in high regard. &quot;Daydream&quot; became a major international hit; by mid-May, it had reached number two on all of the major British singles charts and number one on the Swedish Kvällstoppen chart.
==== Marijuana bust ====

On May20, 1966, Boone and Yanovsky were arrested in San Francisco for possessing marijuana, then an illegal drug. Police discovered the marijuana after pulling the pair over and searching their vehicle. Boone and Yanovsky spent the night in jail before being bailed out the following morning by the Spoonful&#x27;s road manager, Rich Chiaro. Cavallo and Charley Koppelman flew out to meet the band to begin managing the situation, and they hired Melvin Belli to be their attorney. Sebastian and Butler were not immediately informed of the nature of the bust, and the band&#x27;s May 21 performance at the University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s Greek Theatre went forward as normal.

At a meeting with San Francisco police and the District Attorney, Yanovsky was threatened with deportation back to his native Canada. Belli expressed that Yanovsky and Boone were unlikely to win on the merits of their case and that their only way to avoid charges was to cooperate with authorities. The two initially balked at the idea, but they relented to avoid Yanovsky being deported, something they expected would lead to a breakup of the band. Yanovsky and Boone cooperated with authorities to name their drug source, directing an undercover operative to their source at local party. In exchange, all charges were dropped, their arrest records were expunged, the two did not need to appear in court and there was no publicity related to their arrest. Their drug source was in turn arrested and served a brief jail sentence.

After the drug case went to court in December1966, knowledge of Yanovsky and Boone&#x27;s bust became more widespread. The underground press was especially critical of the band. By early1967, the Spoonful&#x27;s shows on the West Coast were sometimes picketed by members of the &#x27;60s counterculture. Protesters carried signs which accused the band of being &quot;finks&quot; and traitors to the movement, and they encouraged fans to boycott the band and burn their records. The public revelations of the drug bust added to tensions between Sebastian and Butler on the one hand, and Yanovsky and Boone on the other. Boone later suggested that the boycott hurt the band&#x27;s commercial performance, but the author Richie Unterberger suggests that the effects have likely been overestimated by other authors, since &quot;most of the people who bought Spoonful records were average teenage Americans, not hippies&quot;. In an article recounting the June1967 Monterey International Pop Festival, the author Michael Lydon suggested that the Spoonful was unable to appear at the festival due to complications related to the drug bust.

==== &quot;Summer in the City&quot; ====

After having recorded two albums in the second-half of 1965, the Spoonful was stretched for new material in March1966 when they began sessions for a new single. While searching for inspiration, Sebastian recalled a song composed and informally recorded by his fourteen-year-old brother, Mark. Sebastian reworked the lyrics and melody of his younger brother&#x27;s composition into &quot;Summer in the City&quot;, and he also incorporated contributions from Boone and the session musician Artie Schroeck. Kama Sutra did not issue &quot;Summer in the City&quot; immediately but instead repurposed &quot;Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?&quot; for release as a single. Issued in April, &quot;Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?&quot; reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in June, making it the band&#x27;s fourth top ten single in America and their second top two record in a row. That same month, &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot; re-entered the Top LPs chart, peaking in August at number 32 after spending 16 more weeks on the chart.

In June1966, while in LosAngeles to play at the Golden Bear nightclub and support the Beach Boys at the Hollywood Bowl, the Spoonful held a party to debut their newest single.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 6/18/66&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Summer in the City&quot; was released on July4. One month later, it overtook the Troggs&#x27; &quot;Wild Thing&quot; and became the band&#x27;s first and only number one single in the U.S. It held the position for three weeks, becoming what the author Jon Savage terms the &quot;American song of the summer&quot;. The song also topped &quot;Cash Box&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot; charts, and it was number one in Canada. The musicologist Ian MacDonald characterizes the song as a &quot;cutting-edge pop [record]&quot; and one of many &quot;futuristic singles&quot; to appear in 1966, representative of a time period when recorded songs began to employ sounds and effects difficult or impossible to recreate during a live performance; when the Spoonful played the song in concert, Sebastian was unable to both sing and play the piano part simultaneously, and Butler instead performed lead vocal duties. After &quot;Daydream&quot; reached number two in the U.K., expectations were similarly high for &quot;Summer in the City&quot;, but it failed to enter the top five of the British charts; it instead peaked at number eight on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart. Coincident with the single&#x27;s release, the band reiterated their plans for a second tour of Britain and continental Europe, to be held over two weeks in September and October with the English singer Dusty Springfield. Only weeks before it began, the band withdrew from the tour. As they announced their withdrawal, the band announced plans to return to Britain in April1967 for a three-week tour.

In July1966, the Spoonful played to a crowd of 65,000 at that year&#x27;s Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island. Bob Dylan had generated controversy at the previous year&#x27;s festival when he performed a set of electric rock, but at the 1966 festival, the Spoonful and several other electric bands appeared, including Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Chuck Berry and the Blues Project. The Spoonful was well received and received no pushback over their appearance. In an article recounting the festival for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the critic Robert Shelton suggested that the band&#x27;s warm reception &quot;reflected the growing acceptance of folk-rock and other amalgamations of contemporary folk songs with electric instruments&quot;.

==== &quot;Hums of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&quot; ====

Sessions for the Spoonful&#x27;s third studio album, later released as &quot;Hums of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&quot;, were originally booked for Columbia Records&#x27; 7th Avenue studio in New York from August 16 to September 23, 1966. Recording was delayed after Columbia booked its own artists at the studio. When time allowed them a break from touring, the Spoonful recorded the album across several sessions in New York City at Bell Sound and the 7th Avenue studio, with work also done in Los Angeles. For the first time on one of the band&#x27;s albums, it consisted of only original material. Henry Diltz, a member of the Modern Folk Quartet, contributed clarinet to &quot;Bes&#x27; Friends&quot; and took the pictures which adorned the LP&#x27;s sleeve. The album was released in November1966, and it reached number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; LPs chart. Preorders for the album were diminished after a disappointing reaction accompanied the August release of the &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Tiger Lily?&quot; soundtrack album.

In addition to the already released &quot;Summer in the City&quot;, the sessions for &quot;Hums of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&quot; produced the song &quot;Rain on the Roof&quot;. The possibility of releasing the song as a single generated disagreement among the members of the Spoonful. &quot;Summer in the City&quot; featured a harder sound than their previous output, and it had attracted new fans to the group after it reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in August. Both Boone and Butler worried that returning to a softer sound with &quot;Rain on the Roof&quot; would potentially alienate the band&#x27;s new fans, but Sebastian countered that the band ought to avoid releasing consecutive singles which sounded too similar, also contending that &quot;Rain on the Roof&quot; would add another dimension to their sound. Issued as a single in October, &quot;Rain on the Roof&quot; remained on the Hot 100 for ten weeks and peaked at number ten, making it the Spoonful&#x27;s sixth consecutive single to reach the top ten. The song also continued the band&#x27;s success in Europe, charting in several European countries.

Another song from &quot;Hums of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&quot;, the country-tinged &quot;Nashville Cats&quot;, was issued as a single in December. It reached number eight on the Hot 100, but despite the band&#x27;s hopes, it failed to crossover into the country market. The single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;Full Measure&quot;, a Boone-Sebastian collaboration, received strong airplay in California and the Southwestern United States, helping it reach number 87 on the Hot 100 chart. In &quot;KRLA Beat&quot;, the local publication of the Southern Californian radio station KRLA, &quot;Full Measure&quot; reached as high as number seven on the station&#x27;s chart.

In 1966, the Spoonful had five Top Ten singles, making it the band&#x27;s most successful year to date. The end-of-year issue for &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked the Spoonful as the third best performing singles artist of the year, after the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In the magazine&#x27;s list of the top records of the year, it placed &quot;Summer in the City&quot;, &quot;Daydream&quot; and &quot;Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind&quot; at numbers 35, 38 and 48, respectively. Besides achieving commercial success, the Spoonful in 1966 were among the American bands regarded most highly by critics; a piece in &quot;TIME&quot; magazine that October placed the band alongside the Mamas and the Papas and Simon &amp; Garfunkel as one of the three best new groups in the country, and Ralph J. Gleason told &quot;Look&quot; magazine that the Spoonful were &quot;the best group in the U.S.&quot;, adding he was &quot;glad to be alive at a time when I can hear them&quot;.

=== 1967–1968: Diminished success ===
==== &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot; soundtrack; Yanovsky and Jacobsen fired ====

In mid-October1966, the Spoonful recorded a soundtrack album for the 1966 film &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot;. The film served as the master&#x27;s thesis of the director Francis Ford Coppola, who was then attending UCLA Film School. After meeting with Coppola in September to discuss the project, Sebastian wrote the songs on his own before presenting them to the musician Artie Schroeck, who arranged the compositions for an orchestra. After Butler struggled with the drum part, the session musician Bill LaVorgna played in his place. David &quot;Fathead&quot; Newman played saxophone during the sessions and Clark Terry played flügelhorn.

During the editing of &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot;, Coppola used the Mamas &amp; the Papas&#x27; 1966 single &quot;Monday, Monday&quot; as temp music for one sequence in the film, for which Sebastian wrote &quot;Darling Be Home Soon&quot;. Sebastian&#x27;s composition flips a genre convention by describing a male subject waiting for a female to return home. The Spoonful recorded the song in one night, but Sebastian&#x27;s original vocal track was subsequently wiped. Sebastian later attributed the loss to an accident on the part of an engineer, saying that what is heard on the final recording &quot;is me, a half hour after learning that my original vocal track had been erased&quot;. He added: &quot;You can even hear my voice quiver a little at the end. That was me thinking about the vocal we lost and wanting to kill someone.&quot; Boone instead suggests that Jacobsen deliberately erased Sebastian&#x27;s vocal after finding it substandard; Boone recalled that the event marked the angriest he had ever seen Sebastian. Jacobsen was soon fired from working with the band, and Boone suggests that the vocal-erasure &quot;probably played a major role&quot; in Jacobsen&#x27;s departure.

The lack of collaboration on &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot; led to consternation from Sebastian&#x27;s bandmates, especially Yanovsky, whose playing style often relied on improvisation. Yanovsky especially disliked the soundtrack album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Darling Be Home Soon&quot;, which was issued in early1967. When the Spoonful appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in January to promote the release, Yanovsky mugged for the camera, miming the lyrics and bouncing up-and-down with a rubber-toad figurine attached to his guitar. The appearance led to laughter from the audience and anger from Sebastian. &quot;Darling Be Home Soon&quot; peaked at number fifteen, a major disappointment compared to the band&#x27;s earlier releases and their first single which failed to reach the Top Ten. Also disappointing was the release of the &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot; soundtrack, which peaked at number 160 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart in May1967. The album&#x27;s sales were hampered by the release in March of the band&#x27;s first greatest hits compilation, &quot;The Best of The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&quot;, which reached number three and became the band&#x27;s best selling album.

From late1966 into early1967, Sebastian&#x27;s bandmates felt he was exerting excessive control over the band&#x27;s direction. Boone recalled that the relationship between Sebastian and Yanovsky became especially stilted, since Yanovsky often rebelled rather than articulate his concerns directly. Further agitating the situation, when Koppelman and Rubin renegotiated the band&#x27;s distribution deal between Kama Sutra and MGM in late1966, though the band received an increase in pay, the label added a &quot;key-man clause&quot; which specified that the band would only exist if Sebastian was a member.

In May1967, Sebastian convened a meeting with Butler and Boone to discuss the band&#x27;s future. Sebastian expressed frustration with Yanovsky&#x27;s increasingly erratic public behavior and his derogatory treatment of his bandmates. Sebastian concluded that either Yanovsky should be fired, or else he was prepared to leave the band. Butler, who had never gotten along with Yanovsky and was increasingly the target of Yanovsky&#x27;s insults, agreed with Sebastian. In a subsequent group meeting at Sebastian&#x27;s apartment, the band informed Yanovsky that he had been fired. He agreed to continue performing the rest of the group&#x27;s scheduled dates, but rumors circulated throughout June that the band was breaking up. He last performed with the Spoonful on , at the Forest Hills Music Festival in Queens, New York.

==== Yester hired, &quot;Everything Playing&quot; ====

The Spoonful hired Jerry Yester to replace Yanovsky on lead guitar duties. Following the May1967 meeting in which Yanovsky was fired, Sebastian suggested hiring Yester, and no other replacement was considered. Yester had been close to the band and Jacobsen for years, having contributed to the recording of &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot;. Since mid-1966, when Yester&#x27;s band the Modern Folk Quartet disbanded, he had been working as a session musician and producer in Los Angeles. In early June1967, he rehearsed with the Spoonful at Sebastian&#x27;s home in East Quogue, New York, and he debuted with the band on June30 at the Memorial Coliseum in Portland, Oregon.

The Spoonful reconvened in August1967 to begin sessions for their next album, &quot;Everything Playing&quot;. In need of a producer after Jacobsen&#x27;s firing, the band initially hoped to work with Roy Halee, who had worked as engineer on the band&#x27;s earlier recordings, but his continued employment with Columbia Records prevented the collaboration. Koppelman-Rubin instead suggested Joe Wissert, a Philadelphia-based producer who had recently worked with the Turtles on their 1967 singles, &quot;Happy Together&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;d Rather Be with Me&quot;. On Wissert&#x27;s recommendation, the band moved from Columbia&#x27;s recording studios to Mira Sound Studios, a new facility in New York City which made use of an AMPEX MM-1000, the industry&#x27;s first 16-track recorder. The band struggled to manage the more complicated recording equipment, a situation worsened when Wissert stopped attending sessions, forcing Yester to produce in his place.

Like other folk-rock acts, the Spoonful struggled to modify their musical approach as the new genre of psychedelia expanded in popularity in 1967. The sessions for &quot;Everything Today&quot; yielded three singles, all three of which continued the band&#x27;s downward commercial performance when they failed to place in the Top Ten. &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock&quot;, which had been recorded at Columbia before Jacobsen and Yanovsky were fired, was released in April1967 and peaked at number 18. For the album&#x27;s next single, &quot;She Is Still a Mystery&quot;, Yester arranged an orchestral accompaniment which included strings and woodwinds played by members of the New York Philharmonic, along with horns from Ray Charles&#x27; touring band. Released in October, the single reached number 27. &quot;Everything Playing&quot; was issued in December1967, but received negative reviews from critics and peaked at number 118 in the U.S. after spending seven weeks on the album chart. The album track &quot;Younger Generation&quot; was originally intended for release as a single – a trade ad in &quot;Billboard&quot; promised it would be &quot;the most talked-about track of 1968&quot; – but its release never followed. Instead, &quot;Money&quot; was issued as a single in January1968, and it peaked at number 48.

==== Sebastian departs, &quot;Revelation: Revolution &#x27;69&quot; ====

After the major commercial disappointments of &quot;Everything Playing&quot; and &quot;Money&quot; in early1968, Sebastian advised his bandmates that, following the Spoonful&#x27;s next three months of scheduled tour dates, he planned to leave the group. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; reported in April that he intended to leave by June. The band last publicly performed on June1, 1968, at Parker Field in Richmond, Virginia. The following day, Sebastian told reporters that the group had probably played their last show together, and some newspapers reported in July that the band had broken up. By September, Sebastian announced his intention to pursue a solo career. The Spoonful were one of several bands to have broken up in 1968. In an article that December, Penny Valentine of &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; counted the band&#x27;s breakup as reflecting a consolidation in the industry, &quot;[tying] up all the loose strings of musical talent in the pop world&quot;. Sebastian later summed up the band&#x27;s career as &quot;two glorious years and a tedious one&quot;.

Following Sebastian&#x27;s departure, the remaining members of the band had little contact with one another. Butler received permission from the label to record and produce an album under the Spoonful&#x27;s name. Released in late1968, &quot;&quot; featured neither Boone nor Yester, but is credited to &quot;The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful featuring Joe Butler&quot;. The album did not chart, and it is generally omitted from lists of the Spoonful&#x27;s discography. The album&#x27;s first single, the John Stewart-penned &quot;Never Going Back&quot;, was recorded in Los Angeles at Sunset Sound Recorders before Sebastian departed the group, but he did not play on the recording. It was issued in July1968 and reached number 73.

=== 1968–present: After the breakup ===
==== John Sebastian ====
Following the dissolution of the Spoonful, Sebastian was the only former member whose music career initially appeared promising. Splitting time between New York City and Los Angeles, his first major project after leaving the band was composing the lyrics and music for the Broadway show &quot;Jimmy Shine&quot;, which ran from December1968 to April1969. In late1968, he signed with Warner Records and he recorded a solo album, &quot;John B. Sebastian&quot;, which reached number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. Guest appearances on the album were made by future members of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, a folk-rock supergroup. Sebastian was offered a position in the band, but he declined, expressing his desire in a contemporary interview to focus on his solo career rather than joining a new group.

In the decade after he left the Spoonful, Sebastian was active in the concert and festival circuit, and he typically played around 100 shows a year. He made an impromptu appearance at the Woodstock festival in August1969, in which he played the Spoonful&#x27;s songs &quot;Darling Be Home Soon&quot; and &quot;Younger Generation&quot;. Despite his initial successes, Sebastian struggled as a songwriter for most of the 1970s. His 1974 album &quot;Tarzana Kid&quot; did not chart, but it was produced by Erik Jacobsen, marking the first time the two collaborated since their falling out years earlier. After his first five singles were commercial failures, Sebastian&#x27;s label planned to drop him; he achieved a number one hit in 1976 with &quot;Welcome Back&quot;, the theme song for the TV show &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;, but he was unable to translate it into continued success.

==== Zal Yanovsky ====

After leaving the Spoonful, Yanovsky signed as a solo act with Buddha Records, and he continued to be managed by Cavallo. In September1967, Buddha issued his debut single, &quot;As Long As You&#x27;re Here&quot;, which reached number 101 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart the following month. In late1967, he began recording his first solo album, &quot;Alive and Well in Argentina&quot;, which was released in April1968. The album received little critical or commercial attention, but it spawned a partnership between Yanovsky and his replacement in the Spoonful, Jerry Yester, who produced the album. The two formed &quot;Hair Shirt Productions&quot;, which produced recordings in Los Angeles for Pat Boone, Tim Buckley and the Fifth Avenue Band.

Yanovsky played in Kris Kristofferson&#x27;s band on a 1970 European tour, including a performance at that year&#x27;s Isle of Wight Festival. Sebastian was performing at the festival as a solo act, and Yanovsky joined him on stage during the former&#x27;s set for several songs. Yanovsky subsequently exited the music business and moved back to Canada, opening the restaurant Chez Piggy in 1979 with his wife in Kingston, Ontario.

==== Steve Boone, Joe Butler and reunions ====

In 1969, Boone attempted to record a solo album, but the project dissolved. That same year, he produced an album for the Virginia-based folk group the Oxpetals, after which he left the music business. Butler pivoted to Broadway acting, and he performed in the rock musical &quot;Hair&quot;. He also worked as a sound editor in Hollywood, but by later in the 1970s he was no longer active in music and instead drove a taxi cab.

Sebastian resisted subsequent efforts to reform the Spoonful, and the original members of the band only reunited twice. In late1979, at the invitation of the musician Paul Simon, the band appeared in his 1980 film &quot;One-Trick Pony&quot; in a concert sequence which featured several 1960s acts. The band did not see each other again until March2000, when the four original members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. Yanovsky died of a heart attack two years later.

Butler, Boone and Yester began touring under the name the Spoonful in 1991, a venture opposed by both Sebastian and Yanovsky. Augmented by a group of touring musicians, the group released a live album, &quot;Live at the Hotel Seville&quot;, in 1999. Sebastian has since reunited with Boone and Butler once, joining them onstage in 2020 during a benefit concert.

== Musical style and development ==
=== Songwriting ===

Led by their primary songwriter John Sebastian, the Spoonful took their earliest influences from blues and jug band music. He and Yanovsky formed the band with the intention of being an &quot;electric jug band&quot;, and Yanovsky summarized their style as &quot;jug band music without the jugs&quot;. The band&#x27;s music further blended influences from folk, blues, country and rock music, updating traditional American music into a modern popular music format. Sebastian later said that the music of the Jim Kweskin Jug Band was particularly influential on the band, and that the Spoonful &quot;redid several of their tunes with only a minimal electric difference&quot;. Sebastian&#x27;s songwriting drew from American pop, rock and folk, and he named Motown music and the Holland–Dozier–Holland songwriting team as among his biggest influences. He also named his friend and fellow folk musician Fred Neil as influential on him, particularly Neil&#x27;s &quot;effortless&quot; style, in which a lyric &quot;sound[s] like it just fell out of your mouth, like you hadn&#x27;t really labored over it&quot;. The Spoonful&#x27;s debut album featured covers of the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, Fred Neil, the folk group the Holy Modal Rounders, the 1920s blues musician Henry Thomas and the girl group the Ronettes.

The Spoonful&#x27;s sound was influential on contemporary musical acts, including bands like the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Kinks, Buffalo Springfield and the Grateful Dead. The Spoonful were one of the first acts to be described as folk rock, a term coined in June1965 to describe music which joined elements of rock-and-roll and folk-music. They were among the main instigators of the folk-rock movement in New York City and became the most successful folk-rock band from the U.S. East Coast. In contrast to the protest songs for which folk had been known, the Spoonful focused on optimistic, feel-good music. The band often termed their sound &quot;good-time music&quot;, a phrase which originally described jug band music. Sebastian hoped it could serve as an alternative to &quot;folk rock&quot; – a term he thought &quot;just didn&#x27;t say it all&quot; – and he used it in his early composition &quot;Good Time Music&quot;, which the author Richie Unterberger writes served as &quot;a sort of manifesto of the group&#x27;s optimism in its jaunty rhythm and celebration of the return of good time music to the radio&quot;. Among contemporary critics in 1966, Ralph J. Gleason wrote that the Spoonful seemed to be neither rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll nor folk rock, while Robert Shelton wrote they were &quot;folk-rock at its most appealing&quot;, with &quot;one foot in old-time blues, jug-band music and ragtime and the other in the modern whirl of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;.
=== Instrumentation ===

The Spoonful played on their own recordings and were against the use of studio musicians. The band sought to avoid being typecast and aimed to sound different with each single,&lt;ref name=&quot;KRLA 1/15/66&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; an approach they developed after seeing other groups fail when repeating the sound of an earlier hit. As part of their efforts, the group incorporated a variety of instruments on their recordings, including bass marimba, chimes, Irish harp and Hohner Tubon, as well as resonator, pedal steel and open-tuned twelve-string guitars. The band&#x27;s music prominently featured the autoharp, a stringed instrument with buttons which, when depressed, produce preset combinations of chords, leaving it typically used as a rhythm instrument. The instrument was mostly associated with folk music, but few folk-rock or rock acts had employed it. Sebastian amplified his autoharp by affixing a ukulele contact microphone onto the back of it and then plugging it into an amplifier, a technique he developed in the rehearsal room before the band&#x27;s first recording session. To generate more bottom end, the band added piano underneath, which Sebastian later said &quot;create[d] the effect of a huge autoharp&quot;.

Despite their origins in folk music, Sebastian and Yanovsky were early fans of rock and roll. The two each played electric before acoustic guitars, and they enjoyed listening to the guitarists Duane Eddy and Link Wray. Sebastian recalled that when the two first met, he was shocked by Yanovsky&#x27;s &quot;all over the place&quot; guitar playing, which he thought drew from the pianist Floyd Cramer and the blues guitarist Elmore James simultaneously. He recalled that Yanovsky, by contrast, later admitted to being intimidated by Sebastian&#x27;s clean playing, but that this became a guide to the pair&#x27;s work together, where he provided a foundation onto which Yanovsky could &quot;come in and throw flowers&quot;. Yanovsky&#x27;s playing relied heavily on improvisation, and he often drew from country music, leading the commentator Peter Doggett to describe him as &quot;the missing link between fifties rockabilly and sixties folk-rock&quot;.

Sebastian played a 1957 sunburst Gibson Les Paul electric guitar in live performances and on the band&#x27;s recordings, and he used a Heritage Gibson as his main acoustic guitar. Yanovsky&#x27;s main guitar was a Guild Thunderbird,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hit Parader 11/67&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which he bought from Manny&#x27;s Music in Midtown Manhattan around 1964. Soon after recording &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot; in June1965, he replaced the guitar&#x27;s original Guild pickups with humbuckers, which he thought &quot;weren&#x27;t quite as warm the originals, but they aged nicely&quot;. He also sometimes played a Fender Esquire. He favored a Fender Super Reverb as his standard amplifier, which he later said managed to add extra bottom end while also being loud, and which he thought sounded similar to a pedal-steel guitar.

The Spoonful&#x27;s image was influential on their contemporaries. The band&#x27;s stage act was both eccentric and extroverted, driven by Yanovsky, who Jacobsen later said &quot;invented the hole-y jeans, falling apart T-shirts, crazy rock guitar antics on stage, the whole subsequent thing of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll guitar[ists] being wild, crazy individualists&quot;. The author Bob Stanley later described the band&#x27;s look as a clash between that of the Beatniks and the Beatles, and the American men&#x27;s fashion magazine &quot;Esquire&quot; produced a fashion spread of the band in its June1966 issue, detailing how the group sported &quot;mod gear&quot;, but from New York&#x27;s Seventh Avenue rather than London&#x27;s Carnaby Street.

The group wore clothes with stripes and spots, stripes having been popularized by Brian Jones. Sebastian often wore denim and granny glasses, the latter of which he adopted from Fritz Richmond, and which John Lennon subsequently adopted in September1966. After the band met the fashion designer Jeannie Franklyn in December1965 on the Sunset Strip, Franklyn designed custom-clothing for Yanovsky. Yanovsky is generally recognized as the first rock musician to wear cowboy hats and fringed buckskin jackets, and his wardrobe also consisted of fur coats, mod ties, corduroy jackets, vests and boutonnières.

<doc id="169649" wikidata="Q6934194" url="?curid=169649" title="Muller v. Oregon">
<text>Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court. Women were permitted by state mandate fewer working hours than those allotted to men. The posed question was whether women&#x27;s liberty to negotiate a contract with an employer should be equal to a man&#x27;s. The law did not recognize sex-based discrimination in 1908; it was unrecognized until the case of &quot;Reed v. Reed&quot; in 1971; here, the test was not under the equal protections clause, but a test based on the general police powers of the state to protect the welfare of women when it infringed on her fundamental right to negotiate contracts; inequality was not a deciding factor because the sexes were inherently different in their particular conditions and had completely different functions; usage of labor laws that were made to nurture women&#x27;s welfare and for the &quot;benefit of all&quot; people was decided to be not a violation of the Constitution&#x27;s Contract Clause.

The case describes women as having dependency upon men in a manner such that women needed their rights to be preserved by the state; their &quot;rights&quot; were in effect, to have maternal gender roles, again however to the loss of some of their contractual liberties. The quotes for the decision follows:

&quot;in the struggle for subsistence she is not an equal competitor with her brother.&quot;

&quot;Though limitations upon personal and contractual rights may be removed by legislation, there is that in her disposition and habits of life which will operate against a full assertion of those rights.&quot;

&quot;her physical structure and a proper discharge of her maternal functions — having in view not merely her own health, but the well-being of the race — justify legislation to protect her from the greed as well as the passion of man.&quot;

&quot;The limitations which this statute places upon her contractual powers, upon her right to agree with her employer as to the time she shall labor, are not imposed solely for her benefit, but also largely for the benefit of all.&quot;

The ruling had important implications for protective labor legislation and was decided just three years after &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;, in which a New York law restricting the weekly working hours of bakers in the state was invalidated. The case was later overturned by &quot;Adkins v. Children&#x27;s Hospital&quot; in 1923.

==Background==
Curt Muller, the owner of a laundry business, was convicted of violating Oregon labor laws by making a female employee work more than ten hours in a single day. Muller was fined $10. Muller appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court and then to the U.S. Supreme Court, both of which upheld the constitutionality of the labor law and affirmed his conviction.

Louis Brandeis, the young attorney who used social science to argue that women workers needed special protection due to the inherent difference between women and men. Brandeis wrote a unique legal brief which later became known as the Brandeis brief, in which there were only two pages of legal arguments followed by over one hundred pages of statistics and expert opinions from social scientists who argued that women were physically, mentally, and emotionally unable to work for more than ten hours at a time. His legal strategy paid off.

==Judgment==
In Justice David Josiah Brewer&#x27;s unanimous opinion, the Court upheld the Oregon regulation. The Court did not overrule &quot;Lochner&quot;, but instead distinguished it on the basis of &quot;the difference between the sexes&quot;. The child-bearing physiology and social role of women provided a strong state interest in reducing their working hours.

That woman&#x27;s physical structure and the performance of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence is obvious. This is especially true when the burdens of motherhood are upon her. Even when they are not, by abundant testimony of the medical fraternity continuance for a long time on her feet at work, repeating this from day to day, tends to injurious effects upon the body, and as healthy mothers are essential to vigorous offspring, the physical well-being of woman becomes an object of public interest and care in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the race.&quot;208 U.S.&quot; at 412.

&quot;When the constitutionality of the Oregon ten-hour law for women was challenged, Florence Kelley committed the National Consumers League to defense. As Kathryn Kish Sklar has explained, NCL&#x27;s research director, Josephine Goldmark, prepared a pathbreaking brief, of which only 2 pages consisted of traditional abstract legal reasoning, and over 100 pages offered sociological evidence. Her brother-in-law, the future Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis, argued the case in the U.S. Supreme Court. Goldmark and Brandeis&#x27;s innovation would come to be known as a &quot;Brandeis Brief,&quot; and many others would later be modeled on it.&quot;

Goldmark and her team were able to assemble 98 out of the 118 pages of the brief, meaning much of the credit for the brief goes to her.

==Significance of the case ==
Groups like the National Consumer League (which included Florence Kelley and Josephine Goldmark as feminists) and the state won shorter hours for women. However, many equal-rights feminists opposed the ruling, since it allowed laws based on stereotyped gender roles that restricted women&#x27;s rights and financial independence. 
While it provided protection from long hours to white women, it did not extend to women of color, food processors, agricultural workers, and women who worked in white-collar jobs. 
The government interest in public welfare outweighed the freedom of contract that is displayed in the 14th Amendment and the effects of &quot;Muller v. Oregon&quot; did not change until the New Deal days in the 1930s. It was also a watershed in the development of Maternalist Reforms.

The ruling was criticized because it set a precedent to use sex differences, and in particular women&#x27;s child-bearing capacity, as a basis for separate legislation, supporting the idea that the family has priority over women&#x27;s rights as workers. Feminist Scholars such as Alice Kessler-Harris opposed the ruling as &quot;an attack on women as workers&quot; cloaked in altruistic labor laws. Kessler-Harris recognized the admirable motives of the period&#x27;s protective labor laws but also observed that the Muller case provided justification for not just regulating but possibly prohibiting women from working in certain capacities. Moreover, the case supported a definition of women in society that according to Joan Hoff was &quot;highly traditional and restrictive.&quot; While many of the criticisms of Muller came by scholars in later decades there were some critics at the time of its ruling. One such critic was suffragist and editor of the Rose City Woman&#x27;s&#x27; Tribune Clara Colby who commented two years before the case was decided: &quot;the whole subject is very difficult and it had better be left to woman&#x27;s own judgement as to what is necessary and desirable. The State has no right to lay any disability upon woman as an individual and if it does as a mother, it should give her a maternity pension which would tend to even up conditions and be better for the family.&quot;

&quot;Until the late 1930s, when the Fair Labor Standards Act created gender-neutral workplace protections, the Equal Rights Amendment championed by the NWP would have demolished the gains for women workers won in Muller. This dispute between feminists who valued protection and feminists who valued equality continued until the latter group gained the upper hand in the 1970s.&quot;

<doc id="169650" wikidata="Q223377" url="?curid=169650" title="Rod of Asclepius">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Rod of Asclepius (⚕; , , , sometimes also spelled Asklepios), also known as the Staff of Aesculapius and as the asklepian, is a serpent-entwined rod wielded by the Greek god Asclepius, a deity associated with healing and medicine. In modern times, it is the predominant symbol for medicine and health care, although it is sometimes confused with the similar caduceus, which has two snakes and a pair of wings.

==Greek mythology and Greek society==
The Rod of Asclepius takes its name from the Greek god Asclepius, a deity associated with healing and medicinal arts in ancient Greek religion and mythology. Asclepius&#x27; attributes, the snake and the staff, sometimes depicted separately in antiquity, are combined in this symbol.

The most famous temple of Asclepius was at Epidaurus in north-eastern Peloponnese. Another famous healing temple (or asclepeion) was located on the island of Kos, where Hippocrates, the legendary &quot;father of medicine&quot;, may have begun his career. Other asclepieia were situated in Trikala, Gortys (Arcadia), and Pergamum in Asia.

In honour of Asclepius, a particular type of non-venomous rat snake was often used in healing rituals, and these snakes – the Aesculapian snakes – crawled around freely on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. These snakes were introduced at the founding of each new temple of Asclepius throughout the classical world. From about 300 BCE onwards, the cult of Asclepius grew very popular and pilgrims flocked to his healing temples (Asclepieia) to be cured of their ills. Ritual purification would be followed by offerings or sacrifices to the god (according to means), and the supplicant would then spend the night in the holiest part of the sanctuary – the abaton (or adyton). Any dreams or visions would be reported to a priest who would prescribe the appropriate therapy by a process of interpretation. Some healing temples also used sacred dogs to lick the wounds of sick petitioners.

The original Hippocratic Oath began with the invocation &quot;I swear by Apollo the Healer and by Asclepius and by Hygieia and Panacea and by all the gods ...&quot;

The serpent and the staff appear to have been separate symbols that were combined at some point in the development of the Asclepian cult. The significance of the serpent has been interpreted in many ways; sometimes the shedding of skin and renewal is emphasized as symbolizing rejuvenation, while other assessments center on the serpent as a symbol that unites and expresses the dual nature of the work of the Apothecary Physician, who deals with life and death, sickness and health. The ambiguity of the serpent as a symbol, and the contradictions it is thought to represent, reflect the ambiguity of the use of drugs, which can help or harm, as reflected in the meaning of the term , which meant &quot;drug&quot;, &quot;medicine&quot;, and &quot;poison&quot; in ancient Greek. However the word may become less ambiguous when &quot;medicine&quot; is understood as something that heals the one taking it because it poisons that which afflicts it, meaning medicine is designed to kill or drive away something and any healing happens as a result of that thing being gone, not as a direct effect of medicine. Products deriving from the bodies of snakes were known to have medicinal properties in ancient times, and in ancient Greece, at least some were aware that snake venom that might be fatal if it entered the bloodstream could often be imbibed. Snake venom appears to have been prescribed in some cases as a form of therapy.

The staff has also been variously interpreted. One view is that it, like the serpent, &quot;conveyed notions of resurrection and healing&quot;, while another (not necessarily incompatible) is that the staff was a walking stick associated with itinerant physicians. Cornutus, a Greek philosopher probably active in the first century CE, in the &quot;Theologiae Graecae Compendium&quot; (Ch. 33) offers a view of the significance of both snake and staff:
In any case, the two symbols certainly merged in antiquity as representations of the snake coiled about the staff are common.

==Confusion with the caduceus==


==Similar Biblical story==
The rod of Asclepius has been likened to the Old Testament story of Moses&#x27;s brazen serpent (also known as Nehushtan), a brass sculpture of a snake on a rod which had the power of protecting the Israelites from the bites of venomous snakes.

==Unicode==

A symbol for the rod of Asclepius has a code point () in the &quot;Miscellaneous Symbols&quot; table of the Unicode Standard: the spelling is theirs.

<doc id="169658" wikidata="Q644479" url="?curid=169658" title="Kaboom! (video game)">
<text>Kaboom! is an action video game published in 1981 by Activision for the Atari 2600. The game involves a Mad Bomber dropping bombs at increasing speeds as the player controls a set of water buckets to catch them. The gameplay was based on the Atari arcade video game &quot;Avalanche&quot; (1978). &quot;Kaboom!&quot; was programmed by Larry Kaplan with David Crane coding the graphics for the buckets and Mad Bomber. It was the last game designed by Kaplan for Activision, who left the company shortly after it was released. The game was later ported by Paul Wilson for the Atari 5200 system.

General critical reception of the game commended its graphics, particularly the Mad Bomber whose expression changed depending on how well the player performed. Reception was mixed towards the simplicity of the game, with some critics praising it as a change of pace from games like &quot;Asteroids&quot; (1979) or &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978), while others found it lacking in variety and complexity. Retrospective reviews were more generally positive with it being praised for its simple and addictive action qualities and being among the best games released by Activision during its early era.

The game sold over one million cartridges and was one of the best-selling Atari 2600 games. Following the game&#x27;s release, cartridges with gameplay similar to &quot;Kaboom!&quot; were released for the Atari 2600 such as &quot;Lost Luggage&quot; (1982) and &quot;Eggomania&quot; (1983). A follow-up to &quot;Kaboom!&quot;, tentatively titled &quot;Kaboom!: The Return of the Mad Bomber&quot; was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, but was never officially released.

== Gameplay ==
In &quot;Kaboom!&quot;, a &quot;Mad Bomber&quot; is dropping bombs to watch them explode. The player starts with three water-filled buckets and must catch the bombs to defuse them and gain points.

The game uses the paddle controller, moving the buckets of water left and right by moving the dial clockwise and counter-clockwise. The bombs start dropping faster as more of them are collected. When the player misses a bomb, all other bombs on the screen explode and the player loses one of their buckets. If at least one bucket is missing, the player will receive a new bucket every 1,000 points.

Difficulty switches on the console make it so buckets are half as wide, making grabbing bombs more difficult. A two-player option is available where the players take turns controlling their buckets and have their own individual scores displayed. 
==Development==
Larry Kaplan designed &quot;Kaboom!&quot; for Activision. Kaplan, Alan Miller and David Crane had all previously worked at Atari, Inc. They believed Atari undervalued its programmers, leading Crane and Miller to leave Atari in August 1979 to make their own company called Activision. Kaplan followed soon after. Prior to the release of &quot;Kaboom!&quot;, Kaplan developed &quot;Bridge&quot; for the Atari 2600, a game based on contract bridge, which was released in December 1980.

&quot;Kaboom!&quot; was inspired by the 1978 Atari arcade game &quot;Avalanche&quot; designed by Dennis Koble. Kaplan was open about the influence in later interviews, saying &quot;I just ripped off &quot;Avalanche&quot;.&quot; Kaplan felt he was limited with the games graphics, and since he could not reuse the falling rocks from the arcade game, he changed it to being a single figure dropping bombs. Kaplan credited Crane for designing the mad bomber and buckets. Crane said that in 1979, he was working on creating a realistic animation of a man running. The character would eventually be used for &quot;Pitfall!&quot; (1982), but Crane originally tried to use the character in a &quot;Cops and Robbers&quot;-themed game which was never published. The character in this game had a black and white colored horizontal stripe shirt, which was later used in &quot;Kaboom!&quot; for the Mad Bomber.

Paul Wilson adapted &quot;Kaboom!&quot; to the Atari 5200 and Atari 8-bit computers. These two ports were identical to each other. Wilson&#x27;s version featured a &quot;Pitch and Catch&quot; mode, which allowed two players to take turns controlling both the buckets and the Mad Bomber.

==Release==
Along with &quot;Freeway&quot;, &quot;Kaboom!&quot; was shipped in July 1981. Wilson&#x27;s port of &quot;Kaboom!&quot; was released for Atari 8-bit computers in October 1983 and the Atari 5200 in November 1983.

The Atari 2600 version of &quot;Kaboom!&quot; is featured in several compilations, including &quot;Activision Classics&quot; (1998) for the PlayStation, &quot;Activision Anthology&quot; for the PlayStation 2 (2002), the Game Boy Advance in 2003, and iPad, iPhone and Android devices in 2012. Along with other Activision published titles, &quot;Kaboom!&quot; was included as a hidden feature in &quot;Call of Duty: World War 2&quot; (2017).

==Reception==
&quot;Kaboom!&quot; was one of the best-selling games for the Atari 2600. In 1981, Activision had achieved sales of $6.3 million and in 1982 their profits rose to $66 million. James Levy of Activision stated &quot;Kaboom!&quot; had sold over one-million copies by 1984. Perry Greenberg of &quot;Video Games&quot; reflected on the success of &quot;Kaboom!&quot; in 1982, writing that it was &quot;not much of a game&quot; and &quot;was a hit solely because of the dearth of TV-game competition when it came out. Back then [...] you didn&#x27;t expect much and you got even less.&quot; 

Discussing the game, Bill Kunkel and Frank Laney Jr. in &quot;Electronic Games&quot; complimented the unique gameplay, writing that once you are tired of blasting asteroids or invading aliens, &quot;Kaboom!&quot; felt &quot;refreshing&quot;. Richard A. Edwards also noted the unique gameplay in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot;, saying that it felt different than shooting games, but found it lacked variety and was a game of &quot;reflexes, not thought&quot; recommending players to try it before purchasing. Other reviewers complimented the graphics, with a review from &quot;TV Gamer&quot; calling it &quot;graphically exciting&quot; noting small touches like the flames exploding at the top of the bombs. Kunkel and Laney Jr. addressed the similarities to the game &quot;Avalanche&quot;, but found &quot;Kaboom!&quot; &quot;infinitely more enjoyable&quot; due to superior graphics. Other publications praised the game&#x27;s addictive gameplay, such as &quot;JoyStik How to Win at Video Games&quot;, &quot;Creative Computing&quot;, and &quot;Computer &amp; Video Games&quot;, with the latter publication declaring it &quot;an extremely compulsive reaction game&quot;. In the 1982 Arcade Awards, the game was awarded Best Audio-Visual Effects. The write-up of the game stated that Activision games were known for &quot;beautiful simplicity of its graphics&quot; and had &quot;hit the mark dead-center again with &quot;Kaboom!&quot;.

In his book &quot;Video Games&quot; (1982), Daniel Cohen said &quot;Kaboom!&quot; was among the best video games, specifically praising the engaging character of the Mad Bomber. Cohen compared the character to Pac-Man, noting the personality of the character changing, such as his smile when the player misses a bomb and his frown when the player scores over 10,000 points. Rick Vogt in &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; also enjoyed the graphical small touches on the Mad Bomber&#x27;s reactions, while ultimately finding that the game would only predominantly appeal to children who were &quot;easily frustrated with the space games saturating the market.&quot;

Reviewing the port for the Atari 8-bit computers, A review &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; found the game superior to the Atari 2600 adaptation, noting better graphics and the added &quot;Pitch and Catch&quot; variation. Other reviewers commented on the gameplay, such as David Duberman of &quot;Antic&quot; who found the game cute and the acknowledged the gameplay as simple &quot;but not by any means easy&quot;. A reviewer in &quot;Softline&quot; dismissed the gameplay, stating that there was &quot;no real game here, just a test of paddle controls.&quot; The reviewer suggested that Atari computer games had &quot;passed the stage of evolution of &quot;Kaboom!&quot; is in-they want more sophistication.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews===
William Cassidy of GameSpy commented on the simplicity of &quot;Kaboom!&quot; in 2003, stating that it involved twitch gameplay, a style which was popular in arcades and consoles around the time of the games release. The style involved acquiring quick reflexes and began to grow less popular when more complicated games were released that involved more intricate puzzle solving. Cassidy said &quot;Kaboom!&quot; was &quot;one of the most addictive and entrancing twitch games ever made&quot; which &quot;manages to walk the line, perfectly balanced between challenge and cheapness.&quot; &quot;Kaboom!&quot; received further praise from Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame noting the games simplicity and addictiveness while &quot;Flux&quot; magazine included the Atari 2600 version at 85th on their Top 100 Video Games list in 1995. Mat Allen of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; referred to &quot;Kaboom!&quot;, along with &quot;River Raid&quot; (1982), &quot;Pitfall II: Lost Caverns&quot; (1984), &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984), &quot;Little Computer People&quot; (1985) and &quot;Alter Ego&quot; (1986), as one of the best games from Activision&#x27;s classic period.

==Legacy==
Following the release of &quot;Kaboom!&quot;, other companies developed similar games, such as &quot;Lost Luggage&quot; (1982) by Apollo and &quot;Eggomania&quot; (1983) by U.S. Games. &quot;TV Gamer&quot; described these games as &quot;Catch &#x27;N Score&quot; where players must catch falling or moving objects coming towards you to score points. In 1983, Jim Clark reviewed &quot;Crackpots&quot; (1983) in &quot;Videogaming and Computer Gaming Illustrated&quot; lamenting that Activison has reached a point of saturation with the &quot;Kaboom!&quot;-themed games of catching or tossing objects with games like &quot;Spider Fighter&quot; (1982) and &quot;Oink!&quot; (1983). No sequels to &quot;Kaboom!&quot; were released. Three follow-ups to older Activison properties were shown at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in 1991 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, including one titled &quot;Kaboom!: The Return of the Mad Bomber&quot; that never received an official release.

Kaplan left Activision shortly after completing &quot;Kaboom!&quot;. He stated he wanted to work on hardware and that he was not enjoying his time at the company. Kaplan said that he felt Jim Levy of Activision was &quot;pushing the superstar approach, the media loves it [...] it&#x27;s taking things out of context and it&#x27;s lying.&quot; Kaplan briefly attempted to start his own hardware and software company funded by Jay Miner which fell through leading Kaplan to return to work at Atari. He would later work for companies such as Amiga and Silicon Graphics.

<doc id="169660" wikidata="Q186471" url="?curid=169660" title="Ultimate Fighting Championship">
<text>The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is an American mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion company based in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is owned and operated by TKO Group Holdings, a majority owned subsidiary of Endeavor Group Holdings. It is the largest MMA promotion in the world as of 2023. It produces events worldwide that showcase 11 weight divisions (eight men&#x27;s and three women&#x27;s) and abides by the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. , it had held over 700 events. Dana White has been its president since 2001 and CEO since 2023. Under White&#x27;s stewardship, it has grown into a global multi-billion-dollar enterprise.

The UFC was founded by businessman Art Davie and Brazilian martial artist Rorion Gracie, and the first event was held in 1993 at McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado. The purpose of the UFC&#x27;s early competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a contest with minimal rules and no weight classes between competitors of different fighting disciplines. In subsequent events, more rigorous rules were created and fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create a separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts.

The UFC was initially owned by the Semaphore Entertainment Group (SEG) until it had financial issues and it was sold to the brothers Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta in 2001, who formed the company Zuffa to operate the UFC, and placed Dana White as the president of the company. In 2016, UFC&#x27;s parent company, Zuffa, was sold to a group led by Endeavor, then known as William Morris Endeavor (WME–IMG), including Silver Lake Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and MSD Capital for US$4.025 billion. In 2021, Endeavor bought out Zuffa&#x27;s other owners at a valuation of $1.7 billion. The organization had 578 fighters contracted as of January 2023.

With a TV deal and expansion in Australia, Asia, Europe, and new markets within the United States, the UFC has achieved greater mainstream media coverage. It earned US$609 million in 2015, and its next domestic media rights agreement with ESPN was valued at $1.5 billion over a five-year term.

In April 2023, Endeavor Group Holdings announced that UFC would merge with the wrestling promotion WWE to form TKO Group Holdings, a new public company majority-owned by Endeavor, with Vince McMahon serving as an executive chairman of the new entity and White remaining as UFC president. The merger was completed on September 12, 2023.
==History==
===Early 1990s competition===
Art Davie proposed to John Milius and Rorion Gracie an eight-man single-elimination tournament called &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;. It was inspired by the &quot;Gracies in Action&quot; video-series produced by the Gracie family of Brazil which featured Gracie jiu-jitsu students defeating martial artists of various disciplines such as karate, kung fu, and kickboxing on Vale Tudo matches. The tournament would also feature martial artists from different disciplines facing each other in no-holds-barred combat to determine the best martial art, and would aim to replicate the excitement of the matches Davie saw on the videos. Gracie accepted, as he was interested in showcasing and promoting his family&#x27;s own jiu-jitsu for a wide audience. Milius, a film director/screenwriter and Gracie student, agreed to be the event&#x27;s creative director. Davie drafted the business plan, and 28 investors contributed the initial capital to start WOW Promotions to develop the tournament into a television franchise.

In 1993, WOW Promotions sought a television partner and approached pay-per-view producers TVKO (HBO) and SET (Showtime), and Campbell McLaren and David Isaacs at Semaphore Entertainment Group (SEG). Both TVKO and SET declined, but SEG—a pioneer in pay-per-view television that had produced such offbeat events as a tennis match between Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova—became WOW&#x27;s partner in May 1993. UFC promoters initially pitched the event as a real-life fighting video game tournament similar to &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. SEG contacted video and film art director Jason Cusson to design a fighting arena for the event. Rorion and Davie didn&#x27;t want a traditional roped ring, citing fears—by showing old Vale Tudo footage—that the fighters could escape through the ropes during grappling and use it as an advantage, or fall off and hurt themselves. SEG&#x27;s executives agreed, and also wanted a way to visually differentiate their event from professional boxing and professional wrestling. Some ideas included a traditional roped-ring surrounded by netting, a moat with alligators, a raised platform surrounded by razor-wire fence, electrified fencing, men in togas and netting that could be lowered from the ceiling by a pulley. Eventually Cusson designed an arena with eight sides surrounded by chain-link fence, the trademarked Octagon, which became the event&#x27;s signature setting. Cusson remained the group&#x27;s production designer through UFC 27. SEG devised the show&#x27;s name as &quot;The Ultimate Fighting Championship&quot;.

WOW Promotions and SEG produced the first event, later retroactively called UFC 1, at McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado on November 12, 1993. Art Davie was its booker and matchmaker. It proposed to find answers for sports fans&#x27; questions such as, &quot;Can a wrestler beat a boxer?&quot; As with most martial arts at the time, fighters typically had skills in just one discipline and little experience against opponents with differing skills. The television broadcast featured kickboxer Kevin Rosier, taekwondo practitioner Patrick Smith, savate fighter Gerard Gordeau, karate expert Zane Frazier, shootfighter Ken Shamrock, sumo wrestler Teila Tuli, boxer Art Jimmerson, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt Royce Gracie—younger brother of UFC co-founder Rorion, whom Rorion selected to represent his family. Royce&#x27;s submission skills proved the most effective in the inaugural tournament, earning him the first ever UFC tournament championship after submitting Jimmerson, Shamrock, and Gordeau in succession. The show was extremely successful, with 86,592 pay-per-view television subscribers.

It&#x27;s disputed whether the promoters intended the event to be a precursor to future events. &quot;That show was only supposed to be a one-off&quot;, eventual UFC president Dana White said. &quot;It did so well on pay-per-view they decided to do another, and another. Never in a million years did these guys think they were creating a sport.&quot; Davie, in his 2014 book &quot;Is This Legal?&quot;, an account of the creation of the first UFC event, disputes the perception that the UFC was seen by WOW Promotions and SEG as a one-off, since SEG offered a five-year joint development deal to WOW. He says, &quot;Clearly, both Campbell and Meyrowitz shared my unwavering belief that War of the Worlds would be a continuing series of fighting tournaments—a franchise, rather than a one-night stand.&quot;

With no weight classes, fighters often faced significantly larger or taller opponents. Keith &quot;The Giant Killer&quot; Hackney faced Emmanuel Yarbrough at UFC 3 with a 9-inch height and weight disadvantage.

During this early phase of the organization, the UFC showcased a bevy of styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned Royce Gracie, Ken Shamrock, and Patrick Smith, they also featured competitors such as Hall of Famer Dan Severn, Marco Ruas, Gary Goodridge, Don Frye, Kimo Leopoldo, Oleg Taktarov, and Tank Abbott.

In April 1995, following UFC 5 in Charlotte, North Carolina, Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions.

====Tightening up of the rules====
Although UFC used the tagline &quot;There are no rules&quot; in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. In a UFC 4 qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and Guy Mezger agreed not to pull hair—as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. The UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event.

UFC 5 also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called &quot;The Superfight&quot;. &quot;The Superfight&quot; began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face; it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The &quot;Superfight&quot; would eventually completely phase out tournament matches.

On the other hand, the first &quot;Superfight&quot; at UFC 5 was also considered a failure. In the first minute of the fight Shamrock knocked Royce to the ground and landed inside his guard. For the next 30 minutes Shamrock was inside Royce&#x27;s guard, with the two throwing punches and headbutts at each other but without any change or action, with the crowd booing the fighters. After 30 minutes the fight was stopped as it had exceeded the time limit allocated for the pay-per-view and was given another 5 minutes of extra time due to protests from the spectators. The fight was over after 36 minutes and a draw was declared. Because of this controversial fight, the UFC would later start to introduce time limits, judges to decide draws, and authorized referees to stand up fighters and restart the bout if they have too much inactivity.

In 1996, the UFC had its first event outside continental United States with UFC 8 in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, and in 1997, UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan was its first foreign event.

===Late 1990s controversy and reform===
The violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of U.S. authorities.

In 1996, U.S. Senator John McCain saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent. He led a campaign to ban the UFC, calling it &quot;human cockfighting&quot;, and sent letters to the governors of all 50 US states asking them to ban it.

Thirty-six states enacted laws that banned &quot;no-holds-barred&quot; fighting, including New York, which enacted the ban on the eve of UFC 12, forcing it to relocate to Dothan, Alabama. The UFC continued to air on DirecTV PPV, though its audience remained minuscule compared to the era&#x27;s larger cable pay-per-view platforms.

In response to the criticism, the UFC increased cooperation with state athletic commissions and modified its rules to remove the less palatable elements of fights while retaining the core elements of striking and grappling. UFC 12 saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of fish-hooking. For UFC 14, gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. UFC 15 saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes. With five-minute rounds introduced at UFC 21, the UFC gradually rebranded itself as a sport rather than a spectacle. The implementation of rules changed the game of many fighters, for example Mark Coleman made potent use of headbutts for his ground-and-pound tactics, could not use them effectively anymore.

Led by UFC commissioner Jeff Blatnick and referee John McCarthy, the UFC continued to work with state athletic commissions. Blatnick, McCarthy, and matchmaker Joe Silva created a manual of policies, procedures, codes of conduct, and rules to help in getting the UFC sanctioned by the athletic commissions, many of which exist to this day. Blatnick and McCarthy traveled around the country, educating regulators and changing perceptions about a sport that was thought to be bloodthirsty and inhumane. By April 2000, their movement had clearly made an impact. California was set to become the first state in the U.S. to sign off on a set of codified rules that governed MMA. Soon after, New Jersey adopted the language.

As the UFC continued to work with the athletic commissions, events took place in smaller U.S. markets, and venues, such as the Lake Charles Civic Center. The markets included states that are largely rural and less known for holding professional sporting events, such as Iowa, Mississippi, Louisiana, Wyoming, and Alabama. SEG could not secure home-video releases for UFC 23 through UFC 29. With other mixed martial arts promotions working towards U.S. sanctioning, the International Fighting Championships (IFC) secured the first U.S. sanctioned mixed martial arts event, which occurred in New Jersey on September 30, 2000. Just two months later, the UFC held its first sanctioned event, UFC 28, under the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board&#x27;s &quot;Unified Rules&quot;.

===2001 and the beginning of Zuffa era===
After the long battle to secure sanctioning, SEG stood on the brink of bankruptcy, when Station Casinos executives Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta and their business partner Dana White approached them in 2000, with an offer to purchase the UFC. A month later, in January 2001, the Fertittas bought the UFC for $2 million and created Zuffa, LLC as the parent entity controlling the UFC.

&quot;I had my attorneys tell me that I was crazy because I wasn&#x27;t buying anything. I was paying $2 million and they were saying &#x27;What are you getting? Lorenzo Fertitta revealed to &quot;Fighters Only&quot; magazine, recalling the lack of assets he acquired in the purchase. &quot;And I said &#x27;What you don&#x27;t understand is I&#x27;m getting the most valuable thing that I could possibly have, which is those three letters: UFC. That is what&#x27;s going to make this thing work. Everybody knows that brand, whether they like it or they don&#x27;t like it, they react to it. Along with the trademark, they acquired a wooden octagon and around a dozen fighter&#x27;s contracts. Later on, they negotiated a deal to buy UFC&#x27;s DVD rights from Lionsgate for an additional two million dollars.

With ties to the Nevada State Athletic Commission (Lorenzo Fertitta was a former member of the NSAC), Zuffa secured sanctioning in Nevada in 2001. Shortly thereafter, the UFC returned to pay-per-view cable television, with UFC 33 featuring three championship bouts.

====Struggle for survival and turnaround====
The UFC slowly rose in popularity after the Zuffa purchase, due partly to greater advertising, corporate sponsorship, the return to cable pay-per-view, and subsequent home video and DVD releases.

White later said that &quot;Nobody took us seriously, except Donald Trump. Donald was the first to recognize the potential that we saw in the UFC, and encouraged us to build our business&quot;. With larger live gates at casino venues like the Trump Taj Mahal and the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the UFC secured its first television deal with Fox Sports Net. &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; aired the first mixed martial arts match on American cable television in June 2002, as well as the main event showcasing Chuck Liddell vs. Vitor Belfort at UFC 37.5. Later, FSN would air highlight shows from the UFC.
UFC 40 proved to be the most critical event to date in the Zuffa era. The event was a near sellout of 13,022 at the MGM Grand Arena and sold 150,000 pay-per-view buys, a rate roughly double that of the previous Zuffa events. The event featured a card headlined by a championship match between then-current UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz and former UFC Superfight Champion Ken Shamrock, who had previously left to professionally wrestle in WWE before returning to MMA. It was the first time the UFC hit such a high mark since being forced &quot;underground&quot; in 1997. UFC 40 also garnered mainstream attention from media outlets such as ESPN and &quot;USA Today&quot;, something that was unfathomable for mixed martial arts at that point in time. Many have suggested that the success of UFC 40 and the anticipation for Ortiz vs. Shamrock saved the UFC from bankruptcy; the buyrates of the previous Zuffa shows averaged a mere 45,000 buys per event, and the company was suffering deep monetary losses. The success of UFC 40 provided a glimmer of hope for the UFC, and kept alive the hope that mixed martial arts could become big. Beyond the rivalry itself, the success of UFC 40 was due in part to the marketing and outreach power of crossover athletes – from Pro Wrestling to MMA and MMA to Pro Wrestling – a practice with roots in Japan&#x27;s Pride Fighting Championships. Long time UFC referee John McCarthy said that he felt UFC 40 was the turning point in whether or not the sport of MMA would survive in America.

Despite the success of UFC 40, the UFC was still experiencing financial deficits. By 2004, Zuffa had $34 million in losses since they purchased the UFC.

====&quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; and the rise in popularity====
Faced with the prospect of folding, the UFC stepped outside the bounds of pay-per-view and made a foray into television. After being featured in a reality television series, &quot;American Casino&quot;, and seeing how well the series worked as a promotion vehicle, the Fertitta brothers developed the idea of UFC creating its own reality series.

Their idea, &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; (&quot;TUF&quot;), was a reality television show featuring up-and-coming MMA fighters in competition for a six-figure UFC contract, with fighters eliminated from competition via exhibition mixed martial arts matches. It was pitched to several networks, each one rejecting the idea outright. Not until they approached Spike TV, with an offer to pay the $10 million production costs themselves, did they find an outlet.

In January 2005, Spike TV launched &quot;The Ultimate Fighter 1&quot; (&quot;TUF 1&quot;) in the timeslot following &quot;WWE Raw.&quot; The show became an instant success, culminating with a notable season finale brawl featuring light heavyweight finalists Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonnar going toe-to-toe for the right to earn the six-figure contract. The live broadcast of the season finale drew a very impressive 1.9 overall rating. Dana White credits &quot;TUF 1&quot; for saving the UFC, and claims that the contract for the second season was made outside of the venue on a napkin immediately after the finale.

On the heels of the Griffin/Bonnar finale, a second season of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; launched in August 2005, and two more seasons appeared in 2006. Spike and the UFC continued to create and air new seasons until the show moved to FX in 2012.

Following the success of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;, Spike also picked up &quot;UFC Unleashed&quot;, an hour-long weekly show featuring select fights from previous events. Spike also signed on to broadcast live UFC Fight Night, a series of fight events debuting in August 2005, and &quot;Countdown&quot; specials to promote upcoming UFC pay-per-view cards.

After a very successful run on Spike and with the upcoming announcement of the UFC&#x27;s new relationship with Fox, Spike officials made a statement regarding the end of their partnership with the UFC, &quot;&quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; season 14 in September will be our last... Our 6-year partnership with the UFC has been incredibly beneficial in building both our brands, and we wish them all the best in the future.&quot;

With the announcement of UFC&#x27;s partnership with Fox in August 2011, &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;, which entered its 14th season in that September, moved to the FX network to air on Friday nights starting with season 15 in the Spring of 2012. Along with the network change, episodes are now edited and broadcast within a week of recording instead of a several-month delay, and elimination fights are aired live.

===Mid-2000s expansion===

With increased visibility, the UFC&#x27;s pay-per-view buy numbers exploded. UFC 52, the first event after the first season of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; featuring eventual-UFC Hall of Famer: Chuck &quot;The Iceman&quot; Liddell, avenging his defeat to fellow eventual-Hall of Famer, Randy Couture, drew a pay-per-view audience of 300,000, doubling its previous benchmark of 150,000 set at UFC 40. Following the second season of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;, the UFC&#x27;s match between Liddell and Couture drew an estimated 410,000 pay-per-view buys at UFC 57.

For the rest of 2006, pay-per-view buy rates continued to skyrocket, with 620,000 buys for UFC 60: Hughes vs. Gracie —featuring Royce Gracie&#x27;s first UFC fight in 11 years—and 775,000 buys for UFC 61 featuring the highly anticipated rematch between Ken Shamrock and Tito Ortiz, the coaches of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter 3&quot;. The organization hit a milestone with UFC 66, pitting Ortiz in a rematch against Liddell with over 1 million buys.

The surge in popularity prompted the UFC to beef up its executive team. In March 2006, the UFC announced that it had hired Marc Ratner, former executive director of the Nevada Athletic Commission, as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. Ratner, once an ally of Senator McCain&#x27;s campaign against &quot;no holds barred&quot; fighting, lobbied numerous athletic commissions to help raise the UFC&#x27;s media profile in an attempt to legalize mixed martial arts in jurisdictions inside and outside the United States that had yet to sanction the sport.

In December 2006, Zuffa acquired the northern California-based promotion World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC) in order to stop the International Fight League (IFL) from making a deal with Versus (now NBC Sports Network). At the time, the UFC had an exclusive deal with Spike, so the purchase of the WEC allowed Zuffa to block the IFL from Versus without violating their contract. The WEC showcased lighter weight classes in MMA, whereas the UFC featured heavier weight classes.

In December 2006, Zuffa also acquired their cross-town, Las Vegas rival World Fighting Alliance (WFA). The WFA had signed major fighters at the time, most notably Quinton &quot;Rampage&quot; Jackson and Lyoto Machida, but their events turned out to be a financial disaster. Zuffa bought select assets from WFA, including select fighter contracts, as well as trademarks and other intellectual property.

The sport&#x27;s popularity was also noticed by the sports betting community as BodogLife.com, an online gambling site, stated in July 2007 that in 2007 UFC would surpass boxing for the first time in terms of betting revenues. In fact, the UFC had already broken the pay-per-view industry&#x27;s all-time records for a single year of business, generating over $222,766,000 in revenue in 2006, surpassing both WWE and boxing.

The UFC continued its rapid rise from near obscurity with Roger Huerta gracing the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and Chuck Liddell on the front of &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; in May 2007.

====Pride acquisition and integration====

In Japan, Mixed Martial Arts took a separate, yet convergent evolution, with origins in &quot;shoot wrestling&quot;, a form of professional wrestling which had more realistic-looking moves and matches while deemphasizing theatrical elements. Promotions like Shooto and Pancrase discarded the scripts and were already putting on hybrid fighting shows with real fights by the time the UFC was founded. This culminated in the creation of Pride Fighting Championships in 1997. At its height, Pride was the world&#x27;s most popular MMA promotion, and helped to popularize the sport in Japan and in the world. Having high attendances on large sports arenas and watched by millions of spectators through free-to-air and pay-per-view television. Meanwhile, the UFC was struggling with political persecution, low pay-per-view sales, and doing events in backwater casinos. Most of UFC&#x27;s best fighters would leave to fight in Japan instead due better pay and prestige.

However, on 2006, Pride started to have financial issues due the termination of lucrative contracts with Japanese TV due a scandal revealing the strong ties between Pride and the yakuza. On March 27, 2007, the UFC and Pride announced an agreement in which the majority owners of the UFC, Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, would purchase the Pride brand.

Initial intentions were for the organizations to be run separately but aligned together with plans to co-promote cards featuring the champions and top contenders from both organizations, making comparisons to the AFL–NFL merger and the creation of a &quot;Super Bowl&quot; of MMA. However, after purchasing Pride, Dana White felt that the Pride model was not sustainable and that the brand became &quot;toxic&quot; in Japan, being difficult to find a new television deal. The organization instead folded, with many former Pride fighters such as Antônio Rodrigo &quot;Minotauro&quot; Nogueira, Maurício &quot;Shogun&quot; Rua, Dan Henderson, Mirko &quot;Cro Cop&quot; Filipović, Wanderlei Silva, and others already being realigned under the UFC brand. On October 4, 2007, Pride Worldwide closed its Japanese office, laying off 20 people who were working there since the closing of its parent company Dream Stage Entertainment (DSE).

On June 18, 2008, Lorenzo Fertitta accommodated the UFC&#x27;s growth by announcing his resignation from Station Casinos in order to devote his energies to the international business development of Zuffa, particularly the UFC. The move proved to be pivotal, as Fertitta helped strike TV deals in China, France, Mexico, and Germany as well as open alternative revenue streams with a new UFC video game and UFC action figures, among other projects.

===Late 2000s–mid-2010s growth with UFC 100===
Popularity surged in 2009 with UFC 100 and the 10 events preceding it including UFC 90, 91, 92, 94, and 98. UFC 100 was a success, garnering 1.6 million buys under the drawing power of former NCAA wrestling and WWE Champion Brock Lesnar and his rematch with former UFC Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir, Canadian Georges St-Pierre going head-to-head with Brazilian Thiago Alves, and American Dan Henderson opposing British Michael Bisping at middleweight after the two were rival coaches on &quot;The Ultimate Fighter: United States vs. United Kingdom&quot;.

UFC 100 drew interest from ESPN, which provided coverage of the event in the days preceding and following it. ESPN would eventually devote additional coverage of the UFC and other MMA news with the television debut of &quot;MMA Live&quot; on ESPN2 in May 2010.

The buzz from UFC 100 was hampered significantly in the second half of 2009 after a rash of injuries and other health-related issues—including Brock Lesnar&#x27;s life-threatening bout with diverticulitis—forcing the organization to continuously scramble and reshuffle its lineup for several events.

However, the momentum gradually began to pick up in the first quarter of 2010 after victories from defending champions Georges St-Pierre and Anderson Silva, as well as Lyoto Machida&#x27;s first career defeat to &quot;Shogun&quot; Rua for the UFC Light Heavyweight title. These fights segued into a very popular clash between former UFC Champions and rivals Rashad Evans and Quinton Jackson—rival coaches on &quot;The Ultimate Fighter 10: Heavyweights&quot;—at UFC 114, featuring the UFC&#x27;s first main event headlined by black fighters. The event scored over 1 million pay per view buys as Evans secured a unanimous decision victory.
This momentum carried into the summer of 2010 at UFC 116, which featured the return of Brock Lesnar defending his UFC Heavyweight title against the undefeated interim-champion Shane Carwin before 1.25 million PPV viewers. Lesnar survived an early barrage of Carwin&#x27;s punches in a contest that was nearly stopped by referee Josh Rosenthal. However, Lesnar recovered in the second round to submit Carwin via arm-triangle choke to retain the undisputed UFC Heavyweight Championship. The event as a whole was critically acclaimed in the media for living up to the hype with a number of exciting fights.

After a fifth round, last-minute victory by UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva over Chael Sonnen at UFC 117, Lesnar finally surrendered his belt to the undefeated Cain Velasquez via 1st-round TKO at UFC 121. The fight produced Velasquez&#x27;s eighth knockout or technical knockout in his first nine MMA fights.

UFC 129 featured Georges St-Pierre vs. Jake Shields at the Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and is currently the largest UFC event in North American history, which coincided with a two-day UFC Fan Expo at the Direct Energy Centre. The event sold out 55,000 tickets for gate revenues exceeding $11 million, shattering previous MMA attendance and gate records in North America.

On November 5, 2016, the UFC had their first exhibition in New York City after years of being delayed by government officials and red tape with a dramatic first match, Conor McGregor vs. Eddie Alvarez.

====WEC merger====

Zuffa, the parent company of the UFC, purchased World Extreme Cagefighting in late 2006 and held the first WEC event under new ownership on January 20, 2007. Soon thereafter the WEC made its home on the Versus Network with its first event debuting on that network in June 2007.

On October 28, 2010, Zuffa announced that WEC would merge with the UFC. The WEC held its final card on December 16, 2010. As a result of the merger, the UFC absorbed WEC&#x27;s bantamweight, featherweight and lightweight weight divisions and their respective fighters. The UFC also made the last WEC Featherweight and Bantamweight Champions, José Aldo and Dominick Cruz respectively, the inaugural UFC Champions of their new weight divisions.

Reed Harris, who started World Extreme Cagefighting with Scott Adams, had mixed emotions on the merger. &quot;It&#x27;s kind of like when your kid goes off to college: at first you&#x27;re not happy, but after you think about it for a while, you&#x27;re really happy,&quot; Harris said following the announcement. &quot;At the end of the day, I never imagined this thing would be where we&#x27;re at today. I&#x27;m extremely proud and happy that I was involved with something that will now be part of what may be, some day, the largest sports organization in the world.&quot;

====Strikeforce purchase====

On March 12, 2011, Dana White announced that Zuffa had purchased Strikeforce. White said that Strikeforce will operate as an independent promotion, and that CEO Scott Coker will continue to run the promotion. Coker announced the return of Fedor Emelianenko on an unspecified July or August event and said that Zuffa-owned company would continue to co-promote with M-1 Global. After an extension was reached to continue Strikeforce through 2012, the promotion&#x27;s heavyweight division (sans Heavyweight Grand Prix finalists) was merged into the UFC, and the promotion&#x27;s Challengers series was ended.

The final Strikeforce show was on January 12, 2013, after which the promotion was dissolved and all fighter contracts were either ended or absorbed into the UFC.

====Fox partnership====

On August 18, 2011, The Ultimate Fighting Championship and Fox announced a seven-year broadcast deal through the Fox Sports subsidiary, effectively ending the UFC&#x27;s Spike TV and Versus (now NBC Sports Network) partnership. The deal includes four events on the main Fox network, 32 live Friday night fights per year on their cable network FX, 24 events following &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; reality show and six separate Fight Night events.

The promotion&#x27;s first broadcast television event – UFC on Fox: Velasquez vs. dos Santos – broke form by showcasing only one fight to television viewers. In the main event, Junior dos Santos abruptly dethroned then-undefeated UFC heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez by knock-out at 1:04 in the first round. The telecast peaked with 8.8 million viewers tuning into the fight with an average audience of 5.7 million, making it by far the most-watched MMA event of all-time and the most-watched combat sports event since 2003&#x27;s HBO bout between Lennox Lewis and Vitali Klitschko.

One of the other programming opportunities that emerged was a weekly UFC magazine-style show. When asked about potential for a weekly magazine-style series, UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta responded, &quot;Not only weekly, but potentially, multiple times per week you&#x27;ll have a UFC magazine (show).&quot; The UFC maintained production control of its product including use of its broadcast team, Mike Goldberg and Joe Rogan. Fox Sports produced pre- and post-shows.

====Women&#x27;s MMA====
On November 16, 2012, the eve of UFC 154: St. Pierre vs. Condit, Dana White confirmed the UFC would feature women&#x27;s MMA with the signing of its first female fighter, Strikeforce bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey. She subsequently became the first female UFC champion, the first Olympic medalist with a UFC title, and the first woman to defend a UFC title. She would successfully defend her title six times.

On December 11, 2013, the UFC purchased the contracts of 11 female fighters from Invicta Fighting Championships to launch their 115-pound Strawweight division. Eight of the Invicta fighters took part in the 20th season of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;, &quot;The Ultimate Fighter: Team Pettis vs. Team Melendez&quot;, along with eight additional fighters signed up for the tournament via open tryouts. Season winner, Invicta FC&#x27;s Strawweight Champion, Carla Esparza became the first UFC women&#x27;s strawweight champion, defeating Rose Namajunas in the finale. Other fighters on the show included Felice Herrig, Tecia Torres, Joanne Calderwood, Bec Hyatt, Randa Markos, Jessica Penne, and Joanna Jędrzejczyk.

====International expansion====
The first UFC event to be held outside the contiguous United States was UFC 8 in Puerto Rico, a US territory, in 1996.

Canada has hosted events 18 times, starting with UFC 83 in 2008 and most recently in 2024 with UFC Fight Night 246. UFC&#x27;s second biggest event to date was also in Canada, as UFC 129 held at Rogers Centre featured a record-breaking attendance of 55,724.

The United Kingdom has been home to 18 events. The first was UFC 38 held in London in 2002. UFC returned to the United Kingdom in 2007 with UFC 70, and visited Northern Ireland for UFC 72. The UK&#x27;s most recent event was in Manchester, England with UFC 304 in 2024. Ireland has held UFC 93 in 2009 and UFC Fight Night: McGregor vs. Brandao 5 years later. In continental Europe, Germany has hosted 6 times, the first being UFC 99 in 2009, UFC 122 in 2010, UFC Fight Night: Munoz vs. Mousasi in 2014, UFC Fight Night: Jędrzejczyk vs. Penne in 2015, UFC Fight Night: Arlovski vs. Barnett in 2016, and most recently, UFC Fight Night: Shogun vs. Smith in 2018. Sweden has hosted 3 times, starting with UFC on Fuel TV: Gustafsson vs. Silva in 2012, and recently with UFC on Fox: Gustafsson vs. Johnson in 2015. Poland had its first event with UFC Fight Night: Gonzaga vs. Cro Cop 2 in 2015.

The first Brazilian event was UFC Brazil: Ultimate Brazil, held in São Paulo in 1998. The promotion did not return to Brazil until 2011 for UFC 134, but since then, the country has hosted a further 20 events. Their most recent visit was UFC Fight Night: Condit vs. Alves. In 2014, Mexico became the second country in Latin America to host an event with UFC 180, followed by a second event, UFC 188, in 2015.

Seven UFC events have been held in Australia, beginning with UFC 110 in 2010 and most recently in December 2018 with UFC Fight Night 142. New Zealand held its first event in 2014, UFC Fight Night: Te Huna vs. Marquardt. Its most recent event was UFC Fight Night: Felder vs. Hooker in February 2020.

In Asia, the UFC has visited 5 countries. Japan had its first visit in 1997 for UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan. The UFC only returned to the country in 2012, with UFC 144. Their last visit was in 2014 for UFC Fight Night: Hunt vs. Nelson, the seventh event there. The promotion has also featured 3 visits to the United Arab Emirates. The first was in 2010 for UFC 112 the second in 2014 for UFC Fight Night: Nogueira vs. Nelson and the third in 2024 for UFC on ABC: Sandhagen vs. Nurmagomedov. The promotion has also visited Macau in 3 occasions: China&#x27;s special administrative region was first visited in 2012 with UFC on Fuel TV: Franklin vs. Le and last visited in 2014 for UFC Fight Night: Bisping vs. Le. The promotion has also visited Singapore with UFC Fight Night: Saffiedine vs. Lim in 2014. The Philippines was the most recent Asian country that the UFC has visited, with UFC Fight Night: Edgar vs. Faber in 2015.

The Ultimate Fighter has had international editions as well: Brazil (since 2012), Australia (vs. United Kingdom – 2012), China (2013), Canada (vs. Australia – 2014), and Latin America (2014).

====TRT ban====
On February 27, 2014, the Nevada State Athletic Commission banned the use of Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT). The UFC followed suit and banned the use of TRT for any of their events, including international markets where the UFC oversees regulatory efforts.

====Lawsuits over contractual treatment of fighters====
===== Class action: Le vs Zuffa (UFC) anti-trust lawsuit =====
In December 2014, an antitrust lawsuit was filed against Zuffa by several fighters, claiming the organization restricts control over fighters&#x27; careers and earning potential. The case moved to Nevada federal court, where Zuffa was denied its motion to stay discovery for 15 years of its financial records.

This caused an ongoing debate and struggle over how UFC sensitive information should be handled, and who may view it. Especially concerning MMAFA founder, Rob Maysey who has taken the lead in representing the former athletes and has stated he hopes to achieve reforms similar to the Ali Act (2000).

Later that year, a 12–16 month investigation began that was expected to last until sometime between September 2016 to January 2017. Thus far, both sides have provided over 100,000 documents.

It is estimated that the UFC shares between 16% and 22% of its revenue with fighters, which is vastly lower than sports leagues such as the NBA, MLB, and NHL, which share approximately half of the revenue with their athletes.

There have been several ongoing lawsuits over the contractual treatment of UFC fighters. One of the most recent cases was filed in 2020 by a group of fighters led by Cung Le and Nate Quarry. They alleged that the UFC violated antitrust laws by engaging in anti-competitive practices that kept fighter pay artificially low. The plaintiffs argued that the UFC&#x27;s practice of using long-term exclusive contracts and &quot;champion&#x27;s clauses&quot; (which extend a fighter&#x27;s contract automatically if they win a title) was intended to suppress fighter pay and prevent them from negotiating with other promotions. They also claimed that the UFC engaged in various other anti-competitive practices, such as blocking fighters from using their own image and likeness rights and taking a significant portion of revenue from merchandise sales. The case was initially dismissed by a judge in 2020, but the fighters appealed the decision and in 2021 the appeals court revived the lawsuit and sent it back to the lower court for further proceedings. On October 1, 2023, Zuffa&#x27;s appeal to the Ninth Circuit court in its antitrust lawsuit has been denied.

On August 9, 2023, U.S. District Judge Richard Boulware granted class action status to more than 1,200 former UFC fighters who competed between December 2010 and June 2017 and are suing for $800 million upward to $1.6 billion in wages, as the lawsuit claims Zuffa had abused its power to suppress UFC fighters&#x27; wages. The anti-trust law also permits private plaintiffs to be able to recover three times the damages suffered, meaning the UFC may ultimately pay several billions of dollars worth of damages. The case has a scheduled April 8, 2024 trial date. On March 20, 2024, TKO, UFC parent company reached an agreement to settle all claims in the class action lawsuits for $335 million where the settlement amount will be deductible for tax purposes. However, on July 31, 2024, Judge Richard Boulware ruled that the case would be heard by a jury and denied the preliminary approval for a settlement and reset a tentative date for trial of October 28.

====== Smith vs. UFC ======
Other lawsuits have also been filed against the UFC, including one by former fighter Leslie Smith, who claimed that the UFC violated federal labor laws by classifying fighters as independent contractors instead of employees. The case was dismissed in 2019, but Smith has appealed the decision.

===2016 sale to WME-IMG and a new era===
In May 2016, ESPN originally reported that the UFC&#x27;s parent company Zuffa, LLC was in talks to sell the company for $3.5 billion to $4 billion. In 2015, the UFC had a reported EBITDA of $200–250 million. No official comment was made from the UFC or Dana White regarding the sale. Companies initially interested in the sale were Dalian Wanda Group, China Media Capital, and WME–IMG (Endeavor).

On July 9, 2016, it was officially announced that the UFC would be sold to a group led by WME–IMG, its owner Silver Lake Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and MSD Capital, for $4.025 billion. At the time, it marked the largest-ever acquisition in sports. Flash Entertainment (owned by the government of Abu Dhabi) retained its 10% minority stake in the company. White, who owned 9% of the UFC, stayed, having been given a stake in the new business. White remained president. Fertitta stepped down as chairman and CEO. WME–IMG was renamed Endeavor in September 2017. Three years into the Endeavor era, White revealed that an undisclosed company bid $5 billion but Fertittas chose WME–IMG due to a connection they already made with its CEO Ari Emanuel.

In October 2016, &quot;MMAJunkie&quot; obtained a UFC financial report released by Endeavor, detailing that the promotion had reached a year-to-year high of $609 million in revenue during 2015. 76% of the total was credited to &quot;content&quot; revenue, covering media rights, PPV buys and UFC Fight Pass subscriptions; in turn, 42% of content revenue was credited to pay-per-view buys, followed by U.S. and international media rights.

====ESPN partnership====
In May 2018, UFC reached new U.S. media rights deals with Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International and ESPN Inc., succeeding those with 21st Century Fox, which began in January 2019. The five-year contracts are cumulatively valued at $300 million per-year for digital and linear rights, roughly doubling the amount paid by Fox in the final year of its previous contract, and include 42 events on ESPN platforms per-year. ESPN linear networks will televise preliminary cards for UFC PPV events, and 10 UFC on ESPN Fight Night events per-year. The subscription streaming service ESPN+ will broadcast 20 exclusive events per-year under the branding UFC on ESPN+ Fight Night; regardless of network, all Fight Night events will feature a full, 12-fight card, and their preliminaries will air exclusively on ESPN+. The ESPN+ service will also hold on-demand rights to UFC library and archive content, new seasons of &quot;Dana White&#x27;s Contender Series&quot;, and other new original content. UFC Fight Pass will be purchasable as an add-on for ESPN+ to stream pay-per-view events.

On March 18, 2019, it was announced that ESPN had reached a two-year extension of the contract. In addition, it was announced that in the United States, future UFC PPVs will only be sold through ESPN+ to its subscribers, and will no longer be sold via traditional television providers beginning with UFC 236. At the same time, the standard price for UFC PPVs was lowered to $59.99 (from $64.99), and new subscribers will be able to purchase a bundle of UFC PPV for a year of ESPN+ too.

====M-1 Global partnership====
On July 18, 2018, it was announced that UFC had entered into a partnership with Russian MMA promoter M-1 Global. M-1 Global will serve as a farm league to scout Russian fighters for UFC and will participate in organizing UFC events in Russia. The deal also gave M-1 champions the opportunity to sign with UFC.

====Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic====
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UFC went on with its March 13, 2020 event, UFC Fight Night: Lee vs. Oliveira in Brasília, Brazil, behind closed doors. On March 16, the organization announced that the next three events, UFC Fight Night: Woodley vs. Edwards, UFC on ESPN: Ngannou vs. Rozenstruik, and UFC Fight Night: Overeem vs. Harris, would be postponed to future dates.

In regards to its next pay-per-view, UFC 249 on April 18, UFC president Dana White stated that the event would likely go on, but at a new venue behind closed doors. It was originally to be held at Barclays Center, but a stay-at-home order was issued by the New York state government. On March 18, the New York State Athletic Commission also withdrew its sanctioning for the event. Due to international travel restrictions and other withdrawals, a revised card for UFC 249 was unveiled on April 6 with a location still TBD. The next day, White disclosed that he had booked an unspecified venue for two months, in order to host both UFC 249 and other future events involving U.S. fighters. He also disclosed plans to secure a private island, known as &quot;Fight Island&quot;, to host events with international fighters.

The new UFC 249 venue was subsequently revealed to be Tachi Palace—a tribal casino in Lemoore, California; as it is on tribal land, it also fell outside of the jurisdiction of the California State Athletic Commission, meaning that events held there could be self-sanctioned. On April 9, the UFC announced that UFC 249 had been cancelled, and all other UFC events would be suspended until further notice. White cited interventions from high-ranking staff of the UFC&#x27;s U.S. media rightsholders, ESPN Inc. and parent The Walt Disney Company, as well as Governor Newsom. The &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Governor of California Gavin Newsom had contacted Disney chairman and former CEO Bob Iger, urging ESPN and the UFC to not hold the event.

Following the decree that professional sports were deemed as &quot;essential services&quot; in Florida, UFC 249 took place on May 9, 2020, at VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Florida with no fans in attendance. Precautionary health and safety measures proposed by the UFC satisfied the Florida State Boxing Commission, which regulates MMA in the state. UFC Fight Night: Smith vs. Teixeira and UFC on ESPN: Overeem vs. Harris were scheduled to take place at the same venue on May 13 and 16, respectively. On Friday, May 8, the UFC announced middleweight fighter Ronaldo Souza was removed from his bout with Uriah Hall at UFC 249 and quarantined after he tested positive for COVID-19, along with his cornermen, despite following the protocols enforced by the UFC. No other athletes or staff tested positive for the disease.

In April 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the UFC held its UFC 261 event, again at the VyStar Arena in Jacksonville, but with a 100-% sold-out capacity, where attendees were not required to wear masks. Public health experts criticized the event, citing the risks to attendees, as well as to the wider community.

====Controversy over eye pokes====
In March 2021, there was strong pressure on the UFC to use new fighter gloves after a severe eye poke ended the final bout at UFC Fight Night: Edwards vs. Muhammad. The official UFC gloves are constructed in a way that leaves the fighters fingers extended forward, whereas there are alternative gloves, which the UFC has not used, which are curved at the knuckle and keep a fighter&#x27;s fingers tucked down. Fighters, trainers and commentators called for new gloves, citing the harms posed to fighters from the standard UFC gloves.

====Zuffa buyout by Endeavor ====
On April 29, 2021, Endeavor successfully launched an initial public offering (IPO) and became a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Endeavor subsequently used some of the proceeds from the IPO to buy out Zuffa&#x27;s other shareholders at a value of $1.7 billion, making Zuffa a wholly-owned subsidiary of Endeavor.

====Betting scandal====
On November 5, 2022, controversy arose when the call for a sports betting fraud investigation was made on a fight involving Darrick Minner a student of James Krause, who is a UFC coach and avid bettor, and Shayilan Nuerdanbieke at UFC Fight Night: Rodriguez vs. Lemos. The UFC was informed by sources that suspicious betting patterns had been observed on the fight. Minner became a large betting underdog just hours before the fight, and the cause of the suspicion came when Minner threw a kick with an apparently injured leg, then kicked with it again after showing signs of injury before being finished by technical knockout shortly thereafter.

On November 6, the UFC released a statement that its official betting partner would look into the matter, but that none of the fighters, coaches, or officials related to the fight were suspected of any wrongdoing. On November 18, the Nevada State Athletic Commission informed the UFC and Krause that Krause&#x27;s license was suspended and would remain so during the course of the investigation. The UFC then announced that any fighter who chose to continue to be coached by Krause or who continued to train in his gym, would not be permitted to participate in UFC events pending the outcome of the aforementioned government investigations.

Following the controversy, UFC introduced rules that banned athletes, coaches, and their close family from betting on UFC events.

=== TKO era ===
==== Endeavor and WWE merger to form TKO ====
On September 12, 2023, Endeavor merged with professional wrestling promotion WWE to form a new publicly traded company under the stock symbol &quot;TKO&quot;, which will be overseen by Endeavor&#x27;s CEO Ari Emanuel. WWE&#x27;s shareholders will hold a 49% stake in the new company, with Vince McMahon had served as an executive chairman who resigned on January 26, 2024, after Janel Grant, a former WWE employee, filed a lawsuit against McMahon for sex trafficking and sexual assault; the merger agreement valued UFC at $12.1 billion. White serves as the CEO for UFC, though his role remains the same as during the Endeavor period.

==== Acquired by Silver Lake private equity====
On April 2, 2024, it was announced by TKO that Endeavor was privately taken 100% by its largest investor, Silver Lake, three years after Endeavor three-year run as a public company where Endeavor purchased the UFC for just over $4 billion in 2016.

==== TKO Group Holdings acquire new assets from Endeavor ====
On October 23, 2024, TKO Group Holdings acquired the event planning and hospitality service On Location as well as IMG (a sports and media agency, producer and distributor previously housed at Endeavor) from Endeavor in $3.25 billion deal
Under the terms of the deal, Endeavor &quot;will receive approximately 26.14 million common&quot; shares of TKO stock and &quot;will subscribe for an equal number of shares of TKO&#x27;s Class B common stock.&quot;Once the deal closes, Endeavor will own 59-percent of TKO with remaining shareholders controlling the other 41-percent of TKO stock.

==Facilities==
===UFC Apex===
The UFC Apex is a live events and production facility. The facility was officially opened on June 18, 2019. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, several UFC events (including UFC 250) were held at Apex behind closed doors. The Octagon at the Apex is notable for being smaller than the Octagon used at all other UFC events, with 25-foot width rather than the usual 30-feet.

===UFC Performance Institute===
The UFC Performance Institute is the official mixed martial arts school for UFC. The building is located in Las Vegas, Nevada opposite the UFC Apex. The institute was opened in 2017, and is the world&#x27;s first mixed martial arts center for innovation, research and training. As many as 400 MMA athletes have visited the center, as well as NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB athletes.

In June 2019, a second facility was opened in Shanghai, China. In 2021, UFC was named the official &quot;high performance advisor&quot; of the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC), under which the Performance Institute in Shanghai would be designated as an official high performance training facility of the COC, and would offer access to its resources for Chinese athletes training to compete in the Olympic Games.

In February 2024, the third Performance Institute was opened in Mexico City, Mexico.

==Drug policy efforts==
During the early years of mixed martial arts, when Pride Fighting Championships along with the Ultimate Fighting Championship were early premierships of the sport, it has been documented that there was a noteworthy lack of rules and regulations regarding drug testing for performance-enhancing drugs. This led to a widespread debate and discussion regarding how prevalent the use of steroids were in the sport, as well as a long list of competitors in the UFC and other major organizations facing failed drug tests. This was further highlighted by continued problems with UFC champions, including Jon Jones and Anderson Silva, failing drug tests. So in February 2015, UFC announced a more aggressive year round, random-testing approach for its competitors to begin in July 2015.

===USADA anti-doping partnership (2015–2024)===
UFC announced a partnership with United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) on June 3, 2015, as the UFC&#x27;s official, independent anti-doping agency. The UFC USADA testing program became effective on July 1, 2015, and includes a minimum of 2,750 drug tests per year with an average of five tests per fighter, and punishments for fighters who fail the tests. Under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, fighters are subject to random tests at any time and place on all in- and out-of-competition blood and urine samples collected by USADA. Fighters must participate in the testing pool for at least six months prior to a fight in order to qualify for a UFC event. In February 2017, UFC made changes to the anti-doping policy, effective April 1, 2017, as follows: (1) Fighters who are new to the UFC with no previous contract would be subject to a one-month testing rule. The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC. Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2) Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract, are required to be in a six-month testing pool prior to competition. (3) No doping violation is handed down to newly signed UFC fighters who voluntarily disclose the use of a prohibited substance prior to testing. (4) &quot;In-competition&quot; testing begins at noon on the weigh-in day and ends one hour after a fighter clears a post-fight medical for non-selected post-fight testing. For fighters who are subjected to post-fight testing the in-competition testing ends after any post-fight testing is done.

In September 2018, it was indicated no announcements would be made on fighters who have been flagged for a potential doping violation until the entire adjudication processes are conducted with the results of the potential doping violation. This came after several cases of fighters, such as Anderson Silva, Junior dos Santos, Josh Barnett and Cris Cyborg, being flagged for potential doping violations, but cleared after they were proved of unintentional use of performance enhancing drugs (usually in the form of contaminated supplements). On November 25, 2019, news surfaced that the UFC and USADA had revised their policies, providing a list of certified supplements that will not lead to sanctions should contaminated samples occur. In January 2021, USADA announced that marijuana would no longer be included in the list of banned substances and they would not penalize any fighter for testing positive for it either before, during, or after a fight. The only exception would be if a fighter was visibly impaired on fight night. Fighters are subject to be suspended up to four years depending on the banned substance used. The common banned substances detected by USADA from suspended fighters are 7-keto-DHEA for weight loss, Anastrozole for estrogen blocker, Clenbuterol for thinning blood to increase oxygen, EPO for stimulating the production of red blood cells which would increase oxygen to muscles, Higenamine for increase heart contraction and speeding up heart rate, Tamoxifen for estrogen blocker, Furosemide, Hydrochlorothiazide for diuretic agent to mask potential doping evidence, Meldonium for stimulating the production of red blood cells which would increase oxygen to muscles, Cocaine, Fentanyl for substances of abuse, Boldenone, Turinabol- (steroid for horses), Drostanolone, hGH, Ibutamoren, Ipamorelin, LGD-4033, Metandienone, Ostarine, Stanozolol, Trenbolone for increased muscle mass and strength, Androstenedione, Androsta, Clomiphene, Dehydrochloromethyltestosterone, and Testosterone for increased testosterone.

In 2015, USADA conducted 353 tests and 2291 tests in 2016 on 586 UFC fighters with Anderson Silva tested the most of a total of 15 times. In 2017 and 2018 a total of 2818 and 2888 tests were conducted by USADA respectively.

As of May 16, 2019, a total of 76 UFC fighters had been sanctioned by USADA since the UFC USADA testing program started.

On October 11, 2023, USADA announced that its partnership with the UFC would end on January 1, 2024.

=== Drug Free Sport International anti-doping partnership (2024–present) ===
With the UFC&#x27;s partnership with USADA coming to an end in 2023, the UFC announced a new partnership with Drug Free Sport International, the same company that oversees the anti-doping programs of the NCAA, MLB, NFL, and NBA. The administration of the UFC Anti-Doping Program, including sanctioning decisions, will be handled exclusively and independently by Combat Sports Anti-Doping (CSAD), where the former FBI agent George Piro would serve as the independent administrator of the UFC&#x27;s anti-doping program. This partnership began in 2024, after their contract with USADA expired on December 31, 2023. The UFC announced that former FBI agent George Piro would serve as the independent administrator of the UFC&#x27;s anti-doping program.

==Anti-piracy efforts==
UFC has been one of the largest and most aggressive spenders among anti-piracy political lobbyists in the United States since the end of the 2000s. One thing in particular that sets them apart from other sports leagues is that, in addition to supporting efforts of stricter piracy laws, they have also on numerous occasions gone after selected individuals in addition to pirate hosting websites. Some of the most notable cases have included, a well publicized lawsuit with Justin.tv in 2011 and a $32 million settlement involving a New York man in 2014.

UFC has always maintained the stance that the large amounts of illegal streams of their events causes massive financial losses. In response to having such a stringent stance it has been extremely controversial and has caused a number of debates within the mixed martial arts community on its effectiveness. As a result, the UFC began experimenting on an online subscription model known as UFC Fight Pass in 2014. It is unclear how beneficial the service has been since its emphasis has been largely minimal next to UFC&#x27;s partnership with Fox and noticeable decline in average PPV buyrates, highlighted by the S&amp;P downgrading Zuffa&#x27;s credit rating in late 2014.

==Insurance policy==
On May 9, 2011, it was announced that UFC would be providing year-round customized insurance coverage for any injury suffered by their or Strikeforce athlete. The policy covers any injuries that occur during competition, training, and non-training related accidents. The policy was underwritten by Houston-based specialty insurance group HCC Insurance Holdings and went into effect on June 1, 2011.

The details of the policy include:
* Coverage for all athletes signed by the UFC or Strikeforce.
* Coverage for athletes residing both within and outside of the United States.
* Zuffa paying for all premiums for the policy, with athletes not required to pay anything.
* Allowing athletes to use up to $50,000 in annual coverage for any injuries that occur while under contract to Zuffa. This includes services such as, doctor services, laboratory tests, emergency medical evacuation, and physical therapy.
* Coverage for athletes regardless of if they are scheduled to compete.
* Life and dental insurance at no cost to the athletes.
* No coverage for minor illnesses, but training-related illnesses like staph infections are covered.

An insurance policy is not a first for mixed martial arts or combat sports as a whole. Former promotions such as the International Fight League, offered insurance to its athletes. However Zuffa&#x27;s policy is the first to cover a large group of combat sport athletes. According to UFC president Dana White, the policy was a goal of the company since Zuffa first purchased the UFC in 2001. In addition UFC chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Fertitta stated that the policy took three years to establish while trying to find possible insurers. Prior to the introduction of this policy, Zuffa provided up to $100,000 for an athlete on each event to cover injuries sustained during competition. However, if an athlete was injured outside of competition they would have to pay for their own medical expenses.

Notable incidents where UFC athletes were injured outside of competition include,
* Frank Mir, who was struck by a car while riding his motorcycle in 2004, and forced out of competition for over 20 months.
* Brock Lesnar, who was forced out of action for several months while struggling with diverticulitis.

==Impact on MMA regulations==
The current rules used in the UFC were first established by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board in 2000, in consultation with the UFC and other MMA promotions in the United States. The first UFC event under the new rules was UFC 28, held before Zuffa&#x27;s takeover. New Jersey&#x27;s &quot;Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts&quot; has since been established throughout the country by other state athletic commissions, including Nevada and California. The UFC has, however, kept close ties with state commissions, especially the Nevada State Athletic Commission, of which Lorenzo Fertitta is a former board member.

==Controversies==
==Legal disputes and monopoly accusations==
===Class action lawsuits===

==== 2014 ====
On December 16, 2014, a class action lawsuit was filed against UFC by fighters Cung Le, Jon Fitch and Nate Quarry. Within a few days, Javier Vazquez and Dennis Hallman filed a second class action. And on December 24, Brandon Vera and Pablo Garza filed a third lawsuit. Shortly after the initial news spreading, UFC quickly responded following the first class action with the statement that, &quot;The UFC will vigorously defend itself and its business practices.&quot; This soon led other promoters such as Scott Coker, President of Bellator MMA, expressing an interest in the outcome of the lawsuit, while rejecting his organization as being labeled a &quot;minor league&quot; as was done several times in the initial filing. By the end of December 2014, the UFC made a formal statement stating, &quot;We are proud of the company we have built, confident in our legal position, and intend to prevail in this lawsuit.&quot;

==== 2015 ====
On February 7, 2015, a fourth lawsuit was filed against the UFC, this one by Mac Danzig and Gabe Ruediger. It was around this time that UFC motioned to move the hearing date from May 7 to March 26, as well as to move the venue from Northern California to Las Vegas, where they are headquartered. A few weeks later, UFC motioned to have the lawsuits dismissed, in four separate documents they claim, &quot;The Complaints&#x27; vague and conclusory allegations fall far short of the Supreme Court&#x27;s requirements in &quot;Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly&quot;, for pleading specific facts showing a plausible antitrust claim.&quot;

Shortly thereafter, a fifth lawsuit was added by Kyle Kingsbury and Darren Uyenoyama on March 20, 2015. On April 12, the plaintiff athletes filed an opposition to February&#x27;s motion to dismiss and transfer. Following the May 7 hearing regarding the motion to change venue, a Californian federal judge granted UFC the motion to change venue to Las Vegas after citing contract agreements from the former employees. As a result of the change of venue to Nevada, UFC was denied its motion to remain a discovery for 15 years of its financial records. This would prompt a debate, especially by MMAFA founder Rob Maysey, on who should have access to the UFC&#x27;s sensitive information and how that information should be viewed.

Both sides have argued for different criteria, so as not to put them at a disadvantage. However, UFC has requested a two-tiered system of confidentiality: confidential and highly confidential. They have stated they feel that Maysey&#x27;s access to highly confidential information could have an influential impact on him and his role in the MMAFA. Meanwhile, Maysey has openly stated his goal is to represent the fighters and ultimately try to get a reform similar to the Ali Act of 2000.

Moving forward to September 25, 2015, due to the gradual nature and complications regarding the lawsuit; UFC requested another dismissal of the case and asked that it be thrown out of Las Vegas federal court. In a surprise bench ruling, this was ultimately denied, which promoted the UFC to release a formal response. The following week, magistrate judge Peggy Leen ruled that the UFC could not prevent plaintiffs attorney Rob Maysey from viewing its most highly confidential and sensitive business and financial information. This has officially caused an expert discovery that is estimated to last from 12 to 16 months (September 2016 to January 2017). In doing so, both parties will have to hand over various highly confidential and sensitive documents.

The goal of the expert discovery is to determine three key factors for antitrust liability to all hold true: (1) Does the UFC have monopoly power? (2) Did the UFC acquire or maintain such power through exclusionary conduct? (3) Did the UFC cause antitrust injury since having a monopoly is not always illegal in the United States? This is expected to involve a wide range of important figures (past and present) in both mixed martial arts and boxing, including most top ranked UFC staff, Scott Coker, Bjorn Rebney, Ray Sefo, Frank Shamrock, Fedor Emelianenko, Randy Couture, Ben Askren, Mark Cuban, Oscar De La Hoya, Bob Arum, Lou DiBella, Bob Meyrowitz, Ken Hershman and even various PRIDE FC executives. Following this ruling through the end of 2015, both sides have provided well over 100,000 documents.

==== 2016 ====
Starting in January, the UFC defense team filed its official answer, denying the fighters&#x27; antitrust claims. In an amended complaint, which contained nearly identical legal and economic substance to the original version from December 2014. The only major difference being the number of plaintiff fighters has declined from eleven to six. Pablo Garza, Gabe Ruediger, Darren Uyenoyama, Dennis Hallman, and Mac Danzig all dropped out of the lawsuit while the original three plaintiffs, Cung Le, Nate Quarry, and Jon Fitch, remain along with Brandon Vera, Javier Vazquez, and Kyle Kingsbury. In addition, UFC has stood by its point of protecting its brand. Additionally, the UFC inadvertently produced PRIDE FC acquisition materials.

Following this in October, UFC made a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, which was ultimately denied.

==== 2017 and 2018 ====
By this point of the lawsuit, there was considerably less notable coverage of the case. Aside from the occasional legal filings, the first of which being in February 2018 in which the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification which faced opposition from UFC. Furthered in September, when the plaintiffs filed their opposition to UFC&#x27;s motion for summary judgment.

Before finally on December 5, 2018, when the plaintiffs held an informational session to cover the status of the lawsuit in Las Vegas, Nevada.

All of which led to some major breaking news in regards to financial information about UFC being revealed once hearings started place in August and September. At this point the case included 12 plaintiffs attorneys, two from Bellator MMA, and two from Top Rank. As they intend to look into the business practices used by UFC throughout the years towards other MMA promotions throughout the 2000s. Who often have placed some level of blame of their demise on UFC.

Some of the most notable revelations included:
* The WME–IMG purchase for the UFC in 2016 was for $4 billion. As was speculated at the time of purchase.
* Athlete compensation ranged from 18.6% to 20.5% during 2011 to 2013. Compared to Strikeforce&#x27;s wage share being around 63% and Bellator&#x27;s around 44.7%. In addition, evidence was provided that showed that UFC made it part of their business strategy to keep athlete compensation below 25%.
* Yearly revenue, PPV, and other financial figures for most of the time UFC owned the company.
* Detailed accounts of negotiation tactics used on particular athletes.
* UFC paid former Pride Fighting Championships CEO Nobuyuki Sakakibara $10 million for a 7-year non-compete clause.

The Ultimate Fighting Championship has been accused of monopolistic business practices both in casual criticism and in formal lawsuits for a number of years. There are numerous fighters who have accused the company of various wrongdoing&#x27;s regarding issues including unequal pay, predatory actions toward rival promotions, lack of a pension or union safety net, and other perceived unethical business practices. These perceptions have been most highlighted by a Federal Trade Commission investigation that took place between 2011 and 2012. As well as in a series of class action lawsuits filed against the company in late 2014 and early 2015.

==== 2024 ====
In July 2024, the parties in the &quot;Le v Zuffa&quot; and &quot;Johnson vs. Zuffa&quot; lawsuits had a proposed $335 million settlement rejected by Judge Richard Franklin Boulware II of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. Subsequently, in September 2024, a new $375 million settlement was proposed.

On February 6, 2025, Judge Richard Boulware of Nevada granted final approval for a $375 million settlement in the &quot;Le vs. Zuffa&quot; antitrust lawsuit for monopolistic practices. As part of the settlement, around $240 million to $260 million will be distributed to eligible fighters, specifically those who competed in at least one UFC bout from December 2010 to June 2017. These payments are expected to be made over the next year. Additionally, $40 million from the settlement will be set aside for administrative and legal expenses. A second, related antitrust lawsuit, &quot;Johnson vs. Zuffa&quot;, which covers fighters who competed in the UFC from 2017 to the present, remains unresolved and continues to proceed separately.

===Federal Trade Commission investigation===
In the months following the March 2011 acquisition of rival promotion Strikeforce, rumours began to circulate that a possible investigation by the FTC would take place. These rumours later came to be true when it was officially announced around the end of January 2012 that the FTC had in fact conducted an investigation, and found no wrongdoings regarding the UFC being a monopoly.

==Relationships with combat sports organizations==

===International Fight League===
Throughout the existence of the International Fight League (IFL) between 2006 and 2008, both UFC and the IFL had competed in a hostile relationship. UFC accused the IFL and sued them for illegally using proprietary information obtained by hiring executives from their organization. The IFL responded with their own suit claiming that UFC was threatening potential partners not to work with the IFL, including Fox Sports Net (a deal with Fox Sports was later signed before resolution of the suit). The tension between the IFL and the UFC worsened with accusations that the IFL had attempted to buy out several top UFC fighters.

In July 2008, there were reports of the IFL&#x27;s possible purchase by the UFC. That same month, Joe Favorito, former IFL senior vice president, cited financial troubles for the closing of the company on July 31, 2008. Anonymous sources stated that UFC had bought the IFL. Other reports cited the UFC&#x27;s airing of IFL footage on its programming, and the signing of previous IFL fighters, as an indirect confirmation of the purchase.

===World Fighting Alliance===
On December 11, 2006, the UFC acquired the assets of the World Fighting Alliance, and formed WFA Enterprises, LLC. as a subsidiary to handle these assets, including select fighter contracts. On the same day, it was reported that UFC was formalizing plans to buy World Extreme Cagefighting, to be run as a separate promotion.

===World Extreme Cagefighting===
Following the purchase of the World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC), UFC made several changes to the promotion. This included modifying the WEC&#x27;s cage, transferring to a focus on lighter weight classes, giving it the ability to host events in Las Vegas, and having the championships of fighters who were contracted UFC fighters vacated. From 2007 to the end of 2010, the WEC was run as a separate promotion under the UFC banner, airing events 28 to 53 on Versus in the US and on The Score in Canada. On October 28, 2010, Dana White announced that the WEC would be absorbed into the UFC in early 2011.

===Pride Fighting Championships===
On March 27, 2007, it was announced that the UFC&#x27;s Frank Fertitta III and Lorenzo Fertitta were acquiring the assets of Pride Fighting Championships, the UFC&#x27;s largest rival, from Dream Stage Entertainment. To handle the take over, the Fertitta brothers created a new corporate entity to handle the assets, Pride FC Worldwide Holdings LLC. With common ownership in place, Zuffa and Pride Worldwide would be working closely together. Although goals of reviving Pride were not realized, many of Pride&#x27;s assets, including contracts with fighters and intellectual property, are now regularly utilized by the UFC.

===Strikeforce===
On March 12, 2011, it was announced that the UFC had purchased Strikeforce in a deal made with partial owner Silicon Valley Sports and Entertainment. The amount of money involved has not been officially disclosed, however, it has been reported that the deal was worth $40 million. The deal included licensing rights, fighter contracts, and the Strikeforce video library. Strikeforce continued to operate as a separate company, similar to that of the WEC, until January 12, 2013. After the final show was held in Oklahoma City, the promotion was dissolved and several fighter contracts were absorbed into the UFC.

===United Glory===
When United Glory was originally formed in 2006, it was known as Ultimate Glory before a lawsuit with UFC forced a name change.

===Invicta Fighting Championships===
In June 2014 the UFC announced that they had signed a multi-year, multi-event broadcast deal to show and archive all Invicta Fighting Championships events on UFC Fight Pass. This has allowed the UFC to further expand its women&#x27;s divisions by adding a strawweight division in July 2014, and signing Invicta fighters such as Carla Esparza and Felice Herrig.

===Shooto===
In June 2014 the UFC announced that they had signed a development deal with the recently revived, Vale Tudo Japan. A brand that was brought back in 2012 by the long running, Shooto promotion. The UFC plans on promoting and operating a new tournament series that will focus on 135 and 145 pound divisions. There were plans of a &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;-like TV show to help promote these tournaments but it is unclear on what the status remains on it.

==Rules and features==
The current rules for the Ultimate Fighting Championship were originally established by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board. The set of &quot;Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts&quot; that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard &quot;de facto&quot; set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.

===Rounds===
UFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a championship title, or is a fight card&#x27;s &quot;main event&quot; fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes. Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with UFC 138 on November 5, 2011, non-championship &quot;main event&quot; fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. UFC 263 marked the first time in UFC history that a non-title bout other than the main-event was scheduled for 5 rounds. UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann featured the organization&#x27;s first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth &quot;sudden victory&quot; round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.

=== Cage===

The UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named &quot;The Octagon&quot;. Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning. Today Zuffa reserves exclusive use of the name &quot;The Octagon&quot;.

The UFC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl. The standard octagon has a diameter of with a high fence. The cage sits atop a platform, raising it from the ground. It has foam padding around the top of the fence and between each of the eight sections. It also has two entry-exit gates opposite each other. The mat (also referred to as the canvas), painted with sponsorship logos and art, is replaced for each event.

For smaller venues and events, the UFC often uses a smaller cage, which is only across.

===Attire===
All competitors fight in approved shorts, without shoes. Tops are only approved for female competitors. Required safety equipment include padded gloves, mouthguard, and protective cups held in place with a jockstrap for males. The open-fingered gloves have at least 1&quot; of padding around the knuckles, (110 to 170 g / 4 to 6 ounces) that allow fingers to grab. To ensure compliance, fighters are checked by a state athletic committee official before being allowed to enter the cage/ring.

Originally the attire for UFC was very open. Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament champion Royce Gracie wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while Art Jimmerson appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove. As of UFC 133 there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after Dennis Hallman wore one in his fight against Brian Ebersole. UFC president Dana White was so furious about the fighter&#x27;s choice of attire that he awarded an honorary &quot;getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible&quot; bonus of $70,000 to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.

====Reebok uniform====
On December 2, 2014, the UFC and Reebok held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the &quot;vast majority of the revenue&quot; from the deal – taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program – will be paid directly to UFC fighters.

Payment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter&#x27;s spot in the official UFC rankings, with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate. The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes&#x27; bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card. In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the idea of the ranking and that payment will be based on the fighter&#x27;s number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1–5 fights, 6–10 fights, 11–15 fights, and 16–20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation. The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter&#x27;s name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to their nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.

The new deal meant that beginning with fight week for UFC 189 in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing – not only on fight night but also at all pre-fight media appearances – and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes&#x27; corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots – similar to those seen with European soccer clubs – that the UFC may eventually sell to &quot;a major, global brand&quot; down the road.

====Venum uniform====
On July 11, 2020, UFC announced Venum as the exclusive outfitting partner from April 2021: UFC on ABC: Vettori vs. Holland was the first event with Venum outfits.

UFC announced in October 2021, that Avex Brasil, local producer of Venum brand apparel, has been named the exclusive manufacturer and distributor of UFC Replica Fight Kits and Fight Week apparel sold through retailers in Brazil. Under the terms of the agreement, Avex Brasil will manufacture officially licensed UFC replica fight kits and fight week apparel for men and women and distribute the product through the country.

=== New glove ===

On April 12, 2024, UFC announced a new glove where changes were made to reduce hand injuries and eye pokes (every 14 fights with an average delay of 50 seconds), while maintaining dexterity and not affecting performance. The new gloves were already tested during the ten weeks of the Dana White&#x27;s Contender Series 2023 and gloves will be used starting June 2024. New features of the gloves include: (1) a wristband locking system to prevent grabbing of the gloves; (2) all seams are now on the palm side with a lack of seams on top of the hands to minimize abrasions and cuts; (3) removal of finger binding that allows the hand to close maturely to reduce eyes pokes, abrasions, and cuts; (4) padding to the sides of the index and pinky finger of the glove to protect bone; (5) ergonomic curved wristband for better fit around the wrist scooped or angled finger holes to eliminate bunching on the inside of the fisted hand lining; (6) and thicker foam padding for maximum flexibility and protection with an updated law profile hook and loop that minimizes snag and reduces weight; they have an authentication and data chip which allows the UFC to identify a pair of gloves to a fighter in a specific fight.

The gloves come in XXXS to XXXXL sizes with weight lighter by 1 to 1.5 ounces compared to the previous gloves; the new glove weighs between 3 and 4.9 oz. New gloves include five different glove colors: gun-metal gloves will be used for traditional UFC fights; gold gloves with an octagon trim for championship fights and main event bouts; black gloves for &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;; blue gloves for Dana White&#x27;s Contender Series; and red gloves for Road to the UFC tournaments.

On November 12, it was reported that the UFC had notified fighters competing in upcoming events, starting from UFC 309, that the organization will reintroduce its previous glove design, which had been replaced at UFC 302 in June. UFC President Dana White cited frequent complaints from fighters as being the reason for the change, even though the new design had only been in use for six months.

===Match outcomes===
Matches may end via:
*Submission: a fighter clearly taps the mat or their opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers a serious injury while in a hold.
*Knockout: a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.
*Technical Knockout (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:
**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend themselves)
**doctor stoppage (a ringside doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)
**corner stoppage (a fighter&#x27;s cornerman/cornerwoman signals defeat for their own fighter)
**forfeit (a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent&#x27;s victory)
*Judges&#x27; Decision: Depending on scoring, a match may end as:
**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)
**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)
**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)
**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)
**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)
**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)
**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)
**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges&#x27; scores resulting in a draw)
*Disqualification: a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent&#x27;s performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent&#x27;s victory.
*No Contest: a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no-contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter&#x27;s testing positive for banned substances.

In the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters&#x27; total &quot;points&quot; be equal (see, e.g., UFC 41 Penn vs. Uno, or UFC 43 Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of &quot;win judgments&quot; from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.

===Judging criteria===
The ten-point must system is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10–10 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.) Scores of 10–8 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10–7 rounds are very rare, with only five known instances in UFC history—if a round is lopsided enough that a 10–7 score would be justified, the referee will usually declare a technical knockout and stop the fight as a safety precaution.

===Fouls===
The Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:

#Head-butting
#Eye-gouging
#Biting
#Hair pulling
#Fish-hooking
#Groin attacks
#Putting a finger into any orifice or into any cut or laceration on an opponent (see Fish-hooking)
#Small joint manipulation
#Striking to the spine or the back of the head (see Rabbit punch)
#Throat strikes of any kind, including, without limitation, grabbing the trachea
#Clawing, pinching or twisting the flesh
#Grabbing the clavicle (collarbone)
#Kicking to the kidney with the heel
#Spiking an opponent to the canvas on the head or neck (see Piledriver)
#Throwing an opponent out of the ring or fenced area
#Holding the shorts or gloves of an opponent
#Spitting at an opponent or the referee
#Engaging in unsportsmanlike conduct that causes an injury to an opponent
#Holding or grabbing the ropes or the fence
#Using abusive language in the ring or fenced area

#Flagrantly disregarding the instructions of the referee
#Timidity, including, without limitation, avoiding contact with an opponent, intentionally or consistently dropping the mouthpiece or faking an injury
#Interference by the corner
#Throwing in the towel during competition
#Applying any foreign substance to the hair, body, clothing or gloves immediately prior to or during a contest or exhibition that could result in an unfair advantage
#If the referee has signaled that the opponent has been knocked out, striking an opponent who is helpless as a result of previous blows and so supported by the ring or fenced area that he or she does not fall
#Striking deliberately at the part of the body over the kidneys
#Intentionally spitting out the mouthpiece

====Fouls against a grounded opponent====
#Kicking the head of a grounded opponent (see soccer kick)
#Kneeing the head of a grounded opponent 
#Stomping a grounded opponent

When a foul is charged, the referee, in their discretion, may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.

===Match conduct===
*After a verbal warning, the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant position or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the &quot;stand-up rule&quot;.
*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.
*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.
*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring/&quot;trash-talking&quot; during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to the excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.

===Evolution of the rules===
*UFC 1 – Although the advertising said &quot;There Are No Rules&quot;, there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in UFC 1 was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.
*UFC 2 – Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).
*UFC 3 – The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to &#x27;no kicking with shoes while on the ground&#x27; and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.
*UFC 4 – After tournament alternate Steve Jennum won UFC 3 by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.
*UFC 5 – The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. UFC 5 also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned &#x27;Superfight champion&#x27; and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.
*UFC 6 – The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a &quot;lack of action&quot;, the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In UFC 6 they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in UFC 5.
*Ultimate Ultimate 1995 – This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.
*UFC 8 – Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.
*UFC 9 – To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee &quot;Big John&quot; McCarthy made repeated warnings to the fighters to &quot;open the hand&quot; when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.
*Ultimate Ultimate 1996 – This event was the first to introduce the &quot;no grabbing of the fence&quot; rule.
*UFC 12 – The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200 lb) and lightweight (200 lb and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as &quot;Superfights&quot;).
*UFC 14 – The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170 g (4 to 6 ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.
*UFC 15 – Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of neck and head, and small joint manipulation became illegal.
*UFC 21 – Five-minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The &quot;ten-point must system&quot; was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).
*UFC 28 – The New Jersey State Athletic Control Board sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed &quot;Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts&quot;. Major changes to the UFC&#x27;s rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced. This new set of rules is currently the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.
*UFC 31 – Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard. Bantamweight moves from 150 to 155 and becomes known as lightweight. Lightweight becomes known as welterweight, middleweight becomes light heavyweight, and a new middleweight class is introduced at 185 pounds. Stools and seconds are first permitted in the Octagon between rounds.
*UFC 43 – In the event of a stoppage, fights restart in the position the fight was stopped.
*UFC 94 – After an incident where Georges St-Pierre was accused of putting vaseline on his back, corner men were disallowed from bringing vaseline into the Octagon. Petroleum jelly may now only be applied by UFC employed cutmen.
*UFC 97 – Foot-stomps are banned (for this event only).
*UFC 133 – Speedo style trunks are banned.
*UFC 138 – First 5-round non-title main event.
*UFC 263 – First 5-round non-title, non-main event bout.
*UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Albazi - (1) Kneeing and/or Kicking the head of a grounded opponent: A fighter shall be considered grounded and may not be legally kneed or kicked to the head when any part of their body other than their hands or feet is in contact with the canvas (ground).(2) Removal of the downward pointing elbow strike (12 to 6) as a foul.

===&quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; rules===
Fights that occur on &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; are classified as exhibition matches under NSAC sanctioning, and thus do not count toward a fighter&#x27;s professional record. Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.

For two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (&quot;sudden victory&quot;) is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges&#x27; decision will be based on that final round.

These exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.

The UFC currently uses nine weight classes: Updated as of February 9, 2025, after UFC 312.

Non-title fights have a one-pound leniency. In title fights, the participants must weigh no more than that permitted for the relevant weight division. The Commission may also approve catch weight bouts, subject to their review and discretion. For example, the Commission may still decide to allow the contest the maximum weight allowed is 177 pounds if it feels that the contest would still be fair, safe, and competitive. In addition, there are five weight classes specified in the Unified Rules which the UFC does not currently use: Super Lightweight (165 pounds), Super Welterweight (175 pounds), Super Middleweight (195 pounds), Cruiserweight (225 pounds), and Super Heavyweight (&gt;265 pounds).

==Roster==

As of October 20, 2020, the UFC roster consisted of fighters from 71 countries.

===Fighter salaries and contracts===
UFC fighters are paid a substantially lower share of revenue than athletes in comparable sports, and other large MMA promotions. UFC fighters are paid per fight, with amounts depending on how well-known the fighters are and how well sponsored a fighter and an event is. Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, Justin Gaethje revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets an additional $25,000 per fighter. While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at UFC 202, Conor McGregor made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent Nate Diaz made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.

Cash bonuses are also awarded for &quot;Fight of the Night&quot; and &quot;Performance of the Night&quot; (formerly awarded separately as &quot;Knockout of the Night&quot;). The size of these bonuses can sometimes be US$80,000 (but are normally US$50,000). For less well-known fighters, they can be several times larger than the contracted amount for the fight. Contracted amounts generally have to be declared to the state athletic commission; however, the UFC also pays undisclosed locker-room bonuses to fighters. In early 2021, Dana White revealed that these bonuses vary from $4,000 to $25,000. In recent years, UFC fighters&#x27; contracts and merchandising rights have been the subject of dispute between fighters (represented by growing the Mixed Martial Arts Fighters Association) and UFC, which has attempted to defend existing regulations.

UFC is contractually bound to offer every fighter three fights per calendar year and if they don&#x27;t, the organization has to pay the fighter for the lacking fights. For example, if the UFC offers a fighter only one fight during the year, they have to pay the fighter for two additional fights. However, if a fight is offered but turned down by the fighter, it is still counted as an offered fight from the contractual viewpoint.

Starting at UFC 273, three &quot;Fan Bonus Of The Night&quot;, for every pay-per-view event, will be awarded by Crypto.com, as part of Crypto.com UFC sponsorship incentive fight kits deal, for every pay-per-view event starting UFC 273. Viewers could vote up to three times per pay-per-view on Crypto.com/FanBonus, starting from the opening of the PPV preliminary card and ending an hour after the conclusion of the main card. The bonuses will be paid in bitcoin in US dollars ranging from US$30,000 for first place, US$20,000 for second place, and US$10,000 for third place.

==Rankings==

As of January 27, 2020, it was announced through Twitter by Bruno Massami that the UFC has decided to separate its pound-for-pound ranking. Men and women will have their own pound-for-pound rankings.

=== Men&#x27;s pound-for-pound ===

Rankings updated on January 21, 2025, after UFC 311.
===Women&#x27;s pound-for-pound ranking===

==UFC events==

MMA journalists and fans have criticized the UFC for putting on too many shows and thus diluting the quality of their product.

===Production team===

Comedian, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Taekwondo black belt Joe Rogan teams up with play-by-play announcer Jon Anik, UFC Hall of Famer Daniel Cormier and Megan Olivi to provide commentary during broadcasts of most UFC events in the US. For 20 years Rogan and Mike Goldberg provided commentary at live events. The &quot;Veteran Voice of the Octagon&quot; is announcer Bruce Buffer. Arianny Celeste, Rachelle Leah, Brittney Palmer, Carly Baker, Vanessa Hanson, Chrissy Blair, Jhenny Andrade, Camila Oliveira, Luciana Andrade, Jamilette Gaxiola, and Red Dela Cruz are Octagon girls. Each fighter is assigned a cutman by the promotion who cares for the fighter before the fight and in between rounds. Jacob &quot;Stitch&quot; Duran was one of the best known cutmen working for the organization. Matches are made by matchmakers, and VP of Talent Relations, Joe Silva and Sean Shelby.

<doc id="169662" wikidata="Q459809" url="?curid=169662" title="Tito Ortiz">
<text>Jacob Christopher &quot;Tito&quot; Ortiz (; born January 23, 1975) is a retired American mixed martial artist and Submission Grappler and a former politician. Ortiz is best known for his career with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is a former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, having held the title from April 14, 2000, to September 26, 2003. Along with fighters like Randy Couture and Chuck Liddell, he was one of the sport&#x27;s early stars. Ortiz ultimately became the biggest pay-per-view draw of 2006 for his fights with Liddell, Forrest Griffin, and Ken Shamrock. On July 7, 2012, Ortiz became the ninth inductee into the UFC Hall of Fame.

Ortiz is the CEO of Punishment Athletics MMA equipment and clothing line, which is located in his hometown of Huntington Beach, California.

On November 5, 2020, Ortiz was announced as one of the winners of the Huntington Beach City Council election, becoming Mayor pro tempore. Sworn into office on December 7, 2020, he resigned from the city council less than six months later on June 1, 2021.

Ortiz made his professional boxing debut on September 11, 2021, in a round one loss to fellow former UFC champion Anderson Silva.

== Early life and education ==
Ortiz is of Mexican descent. At the age of nineteen, Ortiz met Paul Herrera, an assistant wrestling coach at Golden West College. Herrera encouraged Ortiz to attend Golden West, where he was a California junior college state champion and All-American for two consecutive years before transferring to California State University, Bakersfield, where he continued wrestling but was never a full-time starter. Ortiz also trained with UFC fighter and fellow collegiate wrestler, Tank Abbott.

== Mixed martial arts ==
=== Ultimate Fighting Championship ===
Ortiz&#x27;s mixed martial arts debut was at &quot;UFC 13&quot; in 1997. Still in college, Ortiz competed as an amateur for no prize money or contracts. He beat Wes Albritton in an alternate bout by referee stoppage at 0:31 of the first round. He was selected to face Guy Mezger in the Light Heavyweight final after Enson Inoue could not continue due to injury. Despite dominating Mezger at first, Ortiz lost the fight at 2:00 in the first round by a guillotine choke submission. After returning with a TKO victory over Jeremy Screeton at &quot;West Coast NHB Championships 1&quot;, Ortiz fought top ranked fighter and UFC 12 Light Heavyweight Tournament Champion Jerry Bohlander at &quot;UFC 18&quot;. Ortiz dominated the fight and won via TKO due to cut stoppage. Ortiz then avenged his loss to Mezger at UFC 19 by TKO. Ortiz&#x27;s post fight antics towards Mezger and the Lion&#x27;s Den led to his long-running rivalry with the team&#x27;s leader Ken Shamrock.

Ortiz has credited UFC Heavyweight Champion Bas Rutten for inspiration during his early days. Ortiz said; &quot;I looked up to Bas Rutten. Bas was my idol. People were just so scared of fighting him, he was like the man. I thought that was what I need to do now. If I train as hard as he does then one day I&#x27;ll be as good as him and two years later look where I am, I&#x27;m on top of the world. I&#x27;ve got to say thanks to him, (Bas) for helping me out by making me believe in dreams.&quot;

In 1999, Ortiz fought Frank Shamrock for what is now known as the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship at &quot;UFC 22&quot;. Despite controlling Shamrock for the majority of the fight, Ortiz ended up losing via submission due to strikes. Following the victory, Shamrock retired and vacated the championship. The Middleweight division was then officially renamed the Light Heavyweight (205 lb) division and Ortiz was chosen, along with Wanderlei Silva, as a top contender. Ortiz defeated Silva for the vacant Light Heavyweight Championship at &quot;UFC 25&quot; via unanimous decision. He went on to defend the Light Heavyweight Championship a then-record five times in the following three years, defeating Yuki Kondo, Evan Tanner, Elvis Sinosic, Vladimir Matyushenko and Lion&#x27;s Den head Ken Shamrock.

At &quot;UFC 44&quot;, after a near year-long layoff from the sport, Ortiz fought the new Interim Light Heavyweight Champion Randy Couture, who had defeated Chuck Liddell for the interim title at &quot;UFC 43&quot; in September 2003. Couture defeated Ortiz via unanimous decision. The loss ended Ortiz&#x27;s near three-and-a-half-year title reign, which was the longest Light Heavyweight Championship reign until Jon Jones successfully defended the Light Heavyweight Championship for the sixth time on September 21, 2013. Following his loss to Couture, Ortiz faced Chuck Liddell at &quot;UFC 47&quot;, losing by TKO in the second round. After six months off, Ortiz returned and took a unanimous decision victory over newcomer Patrick Côté at &quot;UFC 50&quot; and a split decision over Vitor Belfort at &quot;UFC 51&quot;.

In February 2005, Ortiz took time away from the UFC and was offered deals with several promotions, including PRIDE Fighting Championships and the Don King-backed World Fighting Alliance. Ortiz and fellow fighter Fabiano Iha even hired investment banker Stan Medley to take a new league, The Xtreme Fighting Championship, public. But none of these endeavors came to fruition. Ortiz opted to try his hand at professional wrestling, signing with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling as a guest referee.

In November 2005, UFC president Dana White announced Ortiz and Ken Shamrock would coach &quot;The Ultimate Fighter 3&quot; reality TV series on Spike TV, which premiered in April 2006. Ortiz&#x27;s first fight in his return occurred at &quot;UFC 59&quot; on April 15, 2006, against previous &quot;The Ultimate Fighter 1&quot; winner Forrest Griffin. Ortiz won via split decision (30–27, 28–29, and 29–27). This fight earned him his first &quot;Fight of the Night&quot; award.

His next fight was against UFC Hall of Famer Ken Shamrock at &quot;UFC 61&quot; on July 8, 2006, a match which was to conclude a main rivalry on &quot;The Ultimate Fighter 3&quot;. Shamrock lost in the first round by TKO due to strikes (elbows) by Ortiz.This fight earned him another &quot;Fight of the Night&quot; award.

On August 25, 2006, at the &quot;UFC 62&quot; weigh-ins, Dana White announced a rematch between Ortiz and Shamrock for October 10, 2006, on Spike TV, as the main event of Ortiz vs. Shamrock 3: The Final Chapter. Ortiz beat Shamrock for the third time in this fight, which was stopped in the first round due to strikes. On December 30, 2006, at &quot;UFC 66&quot;, Ortiz&#x27;s rematch with Chuck Liddell (for the UFC Light Heavyweight championship) ended in defeat via referee stoppage in the third round. This fight earned him a &quot;Knockout of the Night&quot; award.

He then fought against undefeated &quot;The Ultimate Fighter 2&quot; winner Rashad Evans on July 7, 2007, at &quot;UFC 73&quot;. Ortiz took charge of the fight from the outset, taking Evans down and controlling him. In the second round Ortiz once again took control and nearly submitted Evans before the culmination of the round. The fight ended in a draw after Ortiz was penalized for grabbing the fence. Ortiz&#x27;s last fight on his contract with the UFC was a unanimous decision loss to the then undefeated Lyoto Machida at UFC 84 on May 24, 2008. All three judges scored the fight 30–27 to Machida. Ortiz came close to submitting Machida in the third round with a triangle choke before transitioning to an armbar. However, Machida managed to escape and survived the round, winning a unanimous judges&#x27; decision. The fight concluded Ortiz&#x27;s stay with the promotion as he chose not to re-sign, citing his frustration with UFC president Dana White as a major factor in the decision.

=== Outside the UFC ===
After leaving the UFC, Ortiz was approached by multiple promotions, including the now defunct Elite Xtreme Combat, Affliction and the American Fight League. However, a clause in his old UFC contract forbade him from signing with or fighting for any other organization until approximately April–June 2009. Until his return to the UFC, Ortiz was considered the biggest free agent on the market.

On October 6, 2008, Ortiz underwent back surgery in Las Vegas, Nevada. According to his website, he had been experiencing back pain since his fight with Randy Couture.

On Wednesday, December 17, 2008, Affliction Entertainment announced that Ortiz would be part of the broadcast team for the . Ortiz had said he would fight again in August 2009, but this did not occur.

=== Return to the UFC ===
As part of his comeback to the UFC, Ortiz began training with his original Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Judo instructor Cleber Luciano (a student of Royler Gracie). Ortiz originally briefly trained with Luciano back in 1997, when he was still a student at Golden West College.

On July 17, 2009, both Ortiz and Dana White stated that the pair had made amends. One week later, White announced that he re-signed Tito. Ortiz stated he is returning for a six-fight deal he and White have worked out. White officially announced Ortiz&#x27;s return in a conference call on July 31, 2009. White mentioned that &quot;everyone wants to see Tito fight&quot; and &quot;Tito will retire in the UFC.&quot; Mark Coleman was named as Ortiz&#x27;s opponent for his return to the octagon at UFC 106.
However, Coleman pulled out of this bout due to a second-degree tear of his MCL, and was replaced by Forrest Griffin.

Due to an illness to UFC Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar, Ortiz&#x27;s fight with Griffin was promoted to the headliner of UFC 106. Griffin won the fight via split decision, showing superior striking ability. Whilst Ortiz was able to secure takedowns in the first and second rounds, Griffin showed considerable improvement since their first fight and kept the fight standing throughout the third, leading to the split decision victory.

On December 5, it was announced Ortiz would coach the 11th season of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;, with the opposing coach being Chuck Liddell. He was scheduled to fight Liddell again for the third time at the end of the season and later pulled out of the bout. On April 7, 2010, UFC president Dana White said Liddell vs. Ortiz 3 was scheduled to be the main event for UFC 115. However, on April 12, 2010, the UFC confirmed the main event for the card was Liddell vs. Rich Franklin.

Ortiz fought Matt Hamill on October 23, 2010, at UFC 121. Hamill was Ortiz&#x27;s first overall pick during Season 3 of the Ultimate Fighter. Ortiz lost the fight via unanimous decision.

UFC President Dana White hinted at Tito Ortiz&#x27;s possible release from the UFC in a post-fight interview after UFC 121 stating that &#x27;We all know what happens when guys lose four fights in the UFC&#x27;. There had been no official statement to confirm this, however. On November 7, in a response to a fan via his Twitter, Ortiz stated that he would again fight in the UFC.

Ortiz was expected to face Antônio Rogério Nogueira on March 26, 2011, at UFC Fight Night 24. UFC president Dana White said that he had expected to cut Ortiz loose from the UFC after his loss to Hamill, but decided to give him one last chance against Nogueira. Ortiz received a cut above his eye and a concussion while training for his fight with Nogueira and was forced to withdraw. He was replaced by Phil Davis.

Ortiz took on Ryan Bader on July 2, 2011, at UFC 132. Coming in as a heavy underdog, with his UFC career on the line (despite stating that in his previous 5 fights, he&#x27;d been plagued by injury), Ortiz dropped Bader with strikes and submitted him using a guillotine choke at 1:56 of the first round, thus securing his first victory since 2006 and saving his UFC career. The victory earned him a $75,000 &quot;Submission of the Night&quot; bonus award.

In a rematch against Rashad Evans on August 6, 2011, at UFC 133, in which he replaced an injured Phil Davis on two weeks&#x27; notice, Ortiz lost in the second round by TKO via strikes, despite nearly finishing Evans in round one with a guillotine. Despite the loss, this fight earned him a $70,000 &quot;Fight of the Night&quot; award.

Ortiz faced Antônio Rogério Nogueira on December 10, 2011, at UFC 140. He lost the fight via TKO in the first round. He would state after the fight that he had suffered a neck injury before the fight, but decided to fight anyway in the hope of bringing the fans a victory.

Ortiz then stated he would retire after his next fight, the last of his contract, against Forrest Griffin at UFC 148.

Ortiz faced Forrest Griffin for a third time on July 7, 2012, at UFC 148. Ortiz was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame prior to his final bout. He lost in a $75,000 &quot;Fight of the Night&quot; winning performance (despite landing 2 knockdowns and 2 takedowns to Griffin&#x27;s zero).

=== Brief retirement ===
Following his loss to Griffin, Ortiz retired from MMA and started up a management company, Primetime 360 Entertainment &amp; Sports Management Inc. The management team would pick up Cristiane &quot;Cyborg&quot; Justino as its first high-profile client. He came out of retirement to fight in Bellator MMA.

On February 14, 2014, Tito Ortiz stepped down as manager for Cristiane &quot;Cyborg&quot; Justino.

=== Bellator MMA ===
On July 31, 2013, it was announced that Ortiz would come out of retirement to face former training partner and fellow former UFC Light heavyweight Champion Quinton Jackson on November 2, 2013, at Bellator 106. However, on October 25, it was announced that Ortiz suffered a neck injury and had to pull out of his fight with Jackson. Despite having to deal with another injury, Ortiz said that he would still focus on a return to the cage and then Bellator President Bjorn Rebney said that they still wanted to see Ortiz compete in their organization.

Ortiz faced Bellator Middleweight champion Alexander Shlemenko, in a match up at Light Heavyweight, in his Bellator debut on May 17, 2014, at Bellator 120. He won via first round arm-triangle choke submission. In his victory speech, he was dismissive of the UFC for the company&#x27;s attempts to remove him from their history, calling it &quot;bullshit&quot; and stated that he will &quot;live in the MMA memory forever&quot;.

Ortiz faced fellow UFC Hall of Famer Stephan Bonnar on November 15, 2014, at Bellator 131. He won via split decision.

On June 19, 2015, it was announced that Ortiz would face Liam McGeary for the Bellator Light Heavyweight Championship. The match eventually took place on September 19, 2015, at Bellator 142: Dynamite 1. Ortiz lost the fight via inverted triangle choke in the first round.

In his fourth fight for the promotion, Ortiz faced fellow UFC veteran Chael Sonnen on January 21, 2017, in the main event at Bellator 170. Before the fight Ortiz announced this would be his last mixed martial arts fight. He won via rear-naked choke in first round.

=== Third bout against Chuck Liddell ===
In August 2018, it was announced by Golden Boy Promotions that Ortiz would be coming out of retirement to face his rival Chuck Liddell in a third fight. The fight took place on November 24, 2018, at The Forum in Inglewood, California. Ortiz won the fight by knockout in the first round.

=== Combate Americas ===
In April 2019, it was announced the Ortiz had signed a multi-fight agreement with the Combate Americas promotion. Later, Ortiz revealed that the contract covers three fights and two years. The time of his promotional debut was set for the fall of 2019. On July 9, 2019, it was announced that Ortiz&#x27;s debut opponent would be former WWE Champion and Combate Americas President Alberto El Patrón in a 210-pound Catchweight bout at Combate Americas event in Hidalgo, Texas on December 7, 2019. Ortiz won the fight via rear-naked choke submission in the first round. On February 26, 2020, it was announced that the result had been temporarily overturned to a no decision by the Texas State Athletic Commission for reasons that have not yet been disclosed. However, on February 28, it was announced that Ortiz consumed muscle relaxers, so the issue had been resolved and the result was turned back to a win for Ortiz.

== Professional wrestling ==

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ===

==== Sporadic appearances (2005) ====
In May 2005, Ortiz made an appearance for the professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). On May 15, 2005, at Hard Justice Ortiz served as special guest referee in the NWA World Heavyweight Championship title match between champion Jeff Jarrett and challenger A.J. Styles at the behest of Director of Authority Dusty Rhodes. The conclusion of the match saw Ortiz knock out Jarrett with a right hook after Jarrett shoved him, which allowed Styles to hit his &quot;Spiral Tap&quot; for the pinfall victory and claim the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Ortiz returned to TNA on the edition of October 1 of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; and the following week he was revealed as the special guest referee for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship match between Jeff Jarrett and Kevin Nash at the Bound for Glory pay-per-view, in a segment, where he grabbed the number one contender Nash in a rear naked choke in order to prevent him from brawling with Jarrett. On October 23 at Bound for Glory Ortiz refereed the match for the title between Jarrett and Rhino, a last minute replacement for Nash. The matched ended with Ortiz knocking out America&#x27;s Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), two of Jarrett&#x27;s associates who attempted to interfere in the match, and then counted the pinfall for Rhino to crown him the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion.

==== Return and Aces &amp; Eights (2013) ====
Ortiz returned to TNA on August 1, 2013, revealing himself as the man behind the cryptic #August1Warning tweets and YouTube videos and staring down the Aces &amp; Eights and The Main Event Mafia, which included his Bellator 106 opponent Quinton Jackson. The following week, Ortiz returned to explain his reason for being in TNA, but he was interrupted by Kurt Angle who declared his respect for Ortiz, and later Bully Ray who declared his disrespect for both men. On August 15 at &quot;Impact Wrestling: Hardcore Justice&quot;, Ortiz was picked by Jackson to sub for Angle in the Main Event Mafia to take on Aces &amp; Eights, which Ortiz left up in the air before he was again interrupted and insulted by Bully Ray. During the main event of the evening, Ortiz turned on Jackson by hitting him with a hammer and allowed Ray to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship from Chris Sabin. The following week, Ortiz officially joined Aces &amp; Eights. However, on &quot;Impact Wrestling: No Surrender&quot;, it was announced that Bellator MMA had pulled Ortiz from TNA programming due to his upcoming PPV fight with Rampage Jackson, thus removing him from Aces &amp; Eights.

<text>In software development, an object is an entity that has state, behavior, and identity. An object can model some part of reality or can be an invention of the design process whose collaborations with other such objects serve as the mechanisms that provide some higher-level behavior. Put another way, an object represents an individual, identifiable item, unit, or entity, either real or abstract, with a well-defined role in the problem domain.

A programming language can be classified based on its support for objects. A language that provides an encapsulation construct for state, behavior, and identity is classified as object-based. If the language also provides polymorphism and inheritance it is classified as object-oriented. A language that supports creating an object from a class is classified as class-based. A language that supports object creation via a template object is classified as prototype-based.

The concept of object is used in many different software contexts, including:

* Possibly the most common use is in-memory objects in a computer program written in an object-based language.

* Information systems can be modeled with objects representing their components and interfaces.
* In the relational model of database management, aspects such as table and column may act as objects.

* Objects of a distributed computing system tend to be larger grained, longer lasting, and more service-oriented than programming objects.
