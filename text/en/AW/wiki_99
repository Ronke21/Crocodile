<text>GHV2 (an abbreviation of Greatest Hits Volume 2) is the second greatest hits album by American recording artist Madonna. It was released by Maverick and Warner Bros. Records on November 13, 2001, coinciding with the video album, &quot;Drowned World Tour 2001&quot;. A follow-up to &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990), &quot;GHV2&quot; contains a collection of singles during the second decade of Madonna&#x27;s career. Madonna mentioned that she only included &quot;songs that I could listen to five times in a row&quot; on it. The album did not contain any new songs, but a promotional single titled &quot;GHV2 Megamix&quot; was released, which contained remixes by Thunderpuss, John Rocks &amp; Mac Quayle and Tracy Young. A promotional remix album was also issued, titled &quot;GHV2 Remixed: The Best of 1991–2001&quot;.

&quot;GHV2&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics, who deemed it an essential compilation, although some criticized the absence of new material. Commercially, the compilation was successful, peaking at number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elsewhere, &quot;GHV2&quot; also attained success, reaching the top five in Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom and several other European countries. It was the 14th best-selling album of the year and has sold more than seven million units worldwide.

== Background and development ==

In early September 2001, media reported that Madonna had recorded two songs, &quot;Sex Makes the World Go Round&quot; and &quot;Veronica Electronica&quot;, to be included on the forthcoming greatest hits album. The last title was from an unreleased remix album in collaboration with William Orbit. It was also reported that the album would be titled &quot;The Immaculate Collection 2&quot;. However, both the title and new songs rumors were proven false. After the final show of Madonna&#x27;s Drowned World Tour on September 15, 2001, MTV News confirmed that the singer had planned to release a greatest hits album in November 2001. On October 4, 2001, Maverick Records eventually announced the track list of &quot;GHV2&quot; as well as its official release date. The album coincided with the release of the DVD/VHS video album of the tour.

A sequel to her first greatest hits album, &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990), &quot;GHV2&quot; included fifteen singles released during Madonna&#x27;s second decade in the recording industry, starting from &quot;Erotica&quot; (1992) to &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot; (2001). Unlike the former release, &quot;GHV2&quot; did not feature any new material. In an interview with BBC&#x27;s Jo Whiley, Madonna spoke about the selection of the tracks stating, &quot;I like &#x27;Fever&#x27;, alright. But you know, the thing is they had to have listening power for me. I had to be able to listen to them five times in a row and think this is really good, this is a well written song, it&#x27;s really well produced.&quot; She also added that &quot;If you listen to the record, you can really see my evolution as a singer, songwriter, and, more important, a human being.&quot; Madonna felt that because it was a &quot;greatest hits&quot;, it should only contain previously released hit songs. Several of her popular singles of that period were excluded from the album. Despite being a worldwide number-one hit in 2000, &quot;American Pie&quot; was not included because Madonna had regretted putting it on her eighth studio album, &quot;Music&quot; (2000). &quot;It was something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing, but it didn&#x27;t belong on the album so now it&#x27;s being punished... My gut told me not to [put the song on &quot;Music&quot;], but I did it and then I regretted it so just for that reason it didn&#x27;t deserve a place on &quot;GHV2&quot;.&quot; she said. Other notable exclusions were &quot;This Used to Be My Playground&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ll See&quot;—all of which had been included on her ballads compilation &quot;Something to Remember&quot; (1995). &quot;Fever&quot; was included on early test pressings but did not make it onto the final release.

The album was originally titled &quot;Greatest Hits: The Second Coming&quot;, but Madonna decided to change the name to &quot;GHV2&quot; just before it was released as &quot;it&#x27;s a title you will remember&quot; and also because of &quot;laziness&quot;, due to the fact that she had just finished the Drowned World Tour and was about to begin filming &quot;Swept Away&quot; (2002). The cover picture is from a 2001 photo shoot for &quot;InStyle&quot; magazine, by Regan Cameron. It was revealed through Madonna&#x27;s official website, on October 18, 2001. Cameron recalled that they had been given the assignment of shooting Madonna for &quot;InStyle&quot; and he was nervous. It was shot at Smashbox Studios in Los Angeles and he tried out first with a polaroid. Two of the pictures from the session were used by Madonna, first one showing her with finger on her lips as a promotional photo for the HBO debut of her Drowned World Tour video, and another one showing her with hair in front of her right eye for &quot;GHV2&quot;. Cameron also contributed artwork for the inner sleeve, which features 600 photographs of Madonna through the years. &quot;GHV2&quot; can also be seen on the cover picture on Madonna&#x27;s eye. The sleeves also contains Japanese lettering (モヂジラミミヂ), which is the result of typing the letters &#x27;M-A-D-O-N-N-A&#x27; on an English keyboard but with the keys re-mapped to their positions on a Japanese kana keyboard. It is pronounced as &quot;Mo-Ji-Ji-Ra-Mi-Mi-Ji&quot;.

== Release and promotion ==
In order to promote the album, Madonna&#x27;s recording company Warner Bros. spent £1 million (£ million in pounds) on its promotion, to generate excitement in the album without the support of media interviews or TV performances, as Madonna was in Malta filming &quot;Swept Away&quot;. A company executive said, &quot;There will be no &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance or interview on Radio One or in &quot;Q&quot; magazine this time so we want the unusual name to get people thinking about the association between Madonna and &quot;GHV2&quot;&quot; and to generate extra media interest to compensate for the artist&#x27;s unavailability to promote the release at the time. However, in December, Madonna made an appearance at the 2001 Turner Prize award ceremony and mentioned that she &quot;had a new record in stores called &quot;GHV2&quot;&quot;.

Madonna&#x27;s company Maverick Records sent a promotional megamix titled &quot;GHV2 Megamix&quot; to radio stations on October 29, 2001. However, it was limited to airplay, and was never released commercially nor included on &quot;GHV2&quot;. The songs featured, in chronological order, were &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;, &quot;Erotica&quot;, &quot;Secret&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;, &quot;Take a Bow&quot;, &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;, &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. Remixes were produced by Thunderpuss, Johnny Rocks &amp; Mac Quayle and Tracy Young. Chris Cox from Thunderpuss explained, &quot;Basically, they were doing the greatest-hits album... and so they approached actually a couple of different remix entities to take a stab at doing a megamix, and it was kind of a cattle call, actually. They basically liked ours the best and so they put it out.&quot; The remix peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart. An accompanying music video for the remix, directed by Dago Gonzalez of Veneno Inc., was compiled of images of Madonna&#x27;s live performances and previous music videos and premiered on November 2, 2001, through &quot;Total Request Live&quot; (TRL) and MTV&#x27;s website. Chuck Taylor from &quot;Billboard&quot; complimented the remix, saying that &quot;its quite a trip down 80s memory lane from an artist whose continually evolving body of work stands strong—even when summarized in this novel context.&quot;

On December 20, 2001, Maverick Records also released a promotional album &quot;GHV2 Remixed: The Best of 1991–2001&quot;, featuring remixed versions of tracks from &quot;GHV2&quot;, except &quot;Take a Bow&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;, and &quot;The Power of Good-Bye&quot;. Remixes were done by Victor Calderone, Junior Vasquez, BT, Sasha, Timo Maas, and Hex Hector. MTV France listed the remixes on their website for streaming.

== Critical reception ==
The compilation received generally positive reviews from music critics. Music journalist Robert Christgau gave a positive review, stating that Madonna &quot;gleans goodies from the overrated &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, mixes in the glorious soundtrack-only &#x27;Beautiful Stranger&#x27; and the dismal soundtrack-only &#x27;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&#x27;, and hands it all over to Mirwais for sonic tweaking I&#x27;m not interested enough to pin down&quot;, while calling it as &quot;an essential package&quot;. A writer from the &quot;South Wales Echo&quot; gave a positive review, saying that &quot;GHV2&quot; is &quot;an essential pop album&quot; and &quot;truly immaculate&quot;. &quot;MusicOMH&quot;&#x27;s Michael Hubbard complimented the inclusion of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry For Me Argentina&quot; from &quot;Evita&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; from the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; sequel &quot;The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;, saying that they &quot;are worthy inclusions... compiling this collection didn&#x27;t require much imagination, the end result does the job—the CD is exactly what it says on the tin.&quot;

John Aizlewood from &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the compilation four out of five stars, stating: &quot;&quot;GHV2&quot; is sufficiently confident to avoid remixes or new tracks. Desperate times, however, call for desperate measures&quot;. Ian Wade from &quot;Dotmusic&quot; positively reviewed the compilation saying, &quot;Had &quot;GHV2&quot; been released before 1998, it would&#x27;ve been a not much fun bunch of ballads and arsery. Thankfully, for the sake of herself, her fans and mankind in general, Madge had a bit of re-think. [...] &quot;GHV2&quot; contains some of the best pop music made by anybody&quot;, although he criticized the omission of some singles like &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; or &quot;Rain&quot;. Cristine Leach from Raidió Teilifís Éireann gave the compilation 4 out of 5 stars, saying that &quot;[Madonna] is still the queen of pop and &quot;GHV2&quot; is essential listening. One for the multiple personality in you this Christmas.&quot; Dugald Baird from &quot;Music Week&quot; noted: &quot;the set is something of an anti-climax, although it is an essential purchase for her army of fans&quot;.

Giving the album 8 on 10, Alex Needham from &quot;NME&quot; criticized the compilation&#x27;s lack of new tracks, and said &quot;while far from immaculate, this is still quite a collection&quot;. About &quot;GHV2&quot;, &quot;New Straits Times&quot;″ Christie Leo commented that &quot;this second volume of greatest hits isn&#x27;t as immediately accessible as the first. But that&#x27;s not what this collection is all about. This 14-track set actually provides a more daring glimpse into the inner machinations of the music marketing juggernaut, Madonna&quot;. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review calling it &quot;slightly disappointing&quot;, justifying that it was because during the 1990s, Madonna was an album artist. He finished his review saying that &quot;the end result is less than the sum of its parts, even if this is a good way to get all of Madge&#x27;s 90s hits at once.&quot; Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; commented that &quot;&quot;GHV2&quot; certainly encapsulates the second decade of the performer&#x27;s boundary-bridging career&quot;, but criticized the lack of new material, and its &quot;choppy edits, random sequences and missing links&quot;, saying: &quot;the collection doesn&#x27;t seem to do justice to a career that has always been ahead of the game and focused on the future&quot;. Charlotte Robinson from &quot;PopMatters&quot; criticized its sequencing, stating, &quot;Chronological sequencing would have made it easier to follow the course of Madonna&#x27;s musical evolution. But would these changes have made &quot;GHV2&quot; a significantly better album? Probably not. As it stands, it&#x27;s the best summary of Madonna&#x27;s second decade as a performer we&#x27;re going to get.&quot;

== Commercial performance ==

In the United States, the compilation entered at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on the week dated December 1, 2001, with first week sales of 150,000 copies. It was an improvement from the 113,000 copies sold by her 1995 ballad compilation album, &quot;Something to Remember&quot;. However, &quot;GHV2&quot; also became her lowest debut on the chart since &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990), which debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 32. Every Madonna album had debuted in the top six until &quot;GHV2&quot;. It was present for a total of 18 weeks on the chart and ranked at number 58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 year end chart for 2002. As of October 2016, the album has sold 1,397,000 copies in the region according to Nielsen SoundScan, with an additional 90,000 sold at BMG Music Clubs.

The album was present for a total of 33 weeks inside the chart, and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). As of June 2019, the compilation has sold 868,500 copies according to the Official Charts Company. &quot;GHV2&quot; also debuted at number two, behind Westlife&#x27;s album in Ireland and Scotland. Across Europe, the compilation reached the top of the chart in Austria, and reaching the top-ten in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Spain and Switzerland. On the combined European Top 100 Albums, &quot;GHV2&quot; peaked at number three.

&quot;GHV2&quot; debuted at number three on the Australia ARIA Charts, and was present for a total of 13 weeks within the top 50. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified it double platinum for shipment of 140,000 copies. It had moderate performance in New Zealand where it debuted at number eight on the Recorded Music NZ&#x27;s album chart, and received a gold certification for shipment of 7,500 copies. The album was successful in Japan, where it received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for selling over 200,000 copies. &quot;GHV2&quot; was the 14th best-selling album of 2001, selling 4.9 million copies worldwide in that year according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). In total &quot;GHV2&quot; has sold over seven million copies as of October 2007.

<text>Sedan () is a commune in the Ardennes department and Grand Est region of north-eastern France. It is also the chef-lieu (administrative centre) of the arrondissement of the same name.

Sedan is notable as the site of two major battles between the armed forces of France and Germany, both of which were won by Germany. The First Battle of Sedan in 1870 sealed the fate of the Second French Empire and paved the way to the foundation of the German Empire, leading to the subsequent annual celebration of &quot;Sedan Day&quot; in Germany. The Second Battle of Sedan in 1940 achieved a decisive breakthrough by &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; forces in the Battle of France and ultimately led to the collapse of the French Third Republic.

==Location==
The town is situated about 200 km from Paris, 85 km north-east of Reims, and 10 km south of the border with Belgium. The historic centre occupies a peninsula formed by a bend in the river Meuse. Sedan station has rail connections to Charleville-Mézières, Reims and Longwy. The A34 autoroute links Sedan with Charleville-Mézières and Reims.

==History==
Sedan was founded in 1424. In the 16th century Sédan was an asylum for Protestant refugees from the Wars of Religion.

Until 1651, the Principality of Sedan belonged to the La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne family. It was at that time a sovereign principality. Their representative, Marshal Turenne, was born at Sedan on 11 September 1611. With help from the Holy Roman Empire, it defeated France at the Battle of La Marfée. Immediately after its victory, Sedan was besieged and its prince, Frédéric Maurice de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, duc de Bouillon, submitted to France. It was annexed to France in return for sparing the prince&#x27;s life after he became involved in a conspiracy against France.

Sedan was the birthplace of Jacques MacDonald, a general who served in the Napoleonic Wars.

In the 1840s, American composer-pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk got his start in Europe with a successful concert in Sedan, including the original piece &quot;Souvenir des Ardennes.&quot;

During the Franco-Prussian War, on 2 September 1870, French emperor Napoleon III was taken prisoner with 100,000 of his soldiers at the First Battle of Sedan. Due to this victory, which made the unification of Germany possible, 2 September was declared Sedan Day (&quot;Sedantag&quot;) and a national German holiday in 1871. It remained a holiday until 1919.

Sedan was occupied by the Germans for four years during World War I. On 13 November 1917, the German Crown Prince paraded the 13th Infantry Division over the course of &quot;d&#x27;Alsace-Lorraine&quot;.

From May 12 to 15, 1940, during World War II, German troops invaded neutral Belgium and crossed the river Meuse by winning the Second Battle of Sedan. The battle allowed them to win the Battle of France by bypassing the Maginot Line, which was the French fortification system, and entrapping the Allied Forces that were advancing east into Belgium, as part of the Allied Dyle Plan strategy.

<text>Fernelmont (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Namur, Belgium. 

On 1 October 2018, Fernelmont had a total population of 8,007. The total area is 65.61 km which gives a population density of 122 inhabitants per km.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Bierwart, Cortil-Wodon, Forville, Franc-Waret, Hemptinne, Hingeon, Marchovelette, Noville-les-Bois, Pontillas, and Tillier.

== History ==
The municipality of Fernelmont was officially created on 3 January 1977, during the fusion of the Belgian municipalities, through the fusion of ten former municipalities, which now exist as ten districts within Fernelmont. It was named Fernelmont (Ash Tree Mountain) after a 13th-century castle which was positioned more or less at the centre of the newly created municipality. None of the villages comprising the municipality has ever been called Fernelmont, and the &quot;Maison Communale&quot; (town hall) is in Noville-les-Bois.

== Economy ==
The municipality includes a &quot;Zone d&#x27;Activités Économiques&quot; (Z.A.E. / light industrial zone), south of the village of Noville-les-Bois, designed to accommodate small and medium-sized non-polluting businesses, covering an area of up to 120 hectares. At the end of 2010 the Z.A.E. already covered more than 50 hectares, having welcomed around 100 small and medium-sized enterprises, and slightly more than 800 people were employed in the zone.

<doc id="175693" wikidata="Q1077163" url="?curid=175693" title="A Certain Sacrifice">
<text>A Certain Sacrifice is a 1985 American drama film co-written and directed by Stephen Jon Lewicki and starring Madonna, Jeremy Pattnosh and Charles Kurtz. It was Madonna&#x27;s first movie, filmed from September 1979 through June 1981, but not released until 1985.

&quot;A Certain Sacrifice&quot; is an independent-underground art film, shot on-and-off over two years in New York City on a low-budget of just $20,000. Madonna finished her scenes in late 1980. The video release sold 50,000 copies in its first-week, and the film developed a certain cult status among some of Madonna&#x27;s fans and collectors by that time.

== Plot ==
Madonna plays the part of Bruna, a Lower East Side resident who lives with three &quot;love slaves&quot; (one woman, one man, and one trans woman). Bruna meets Dashiell (Pattnosh) in the water fountain in Washington Square Park and the two &quot;fall in love&quot;. Bruna later tells her lovers she does not need them anymore, resulting in them attacking her sexually. Later, Bruna is raped by Raymond Hall (Kurtz) in a bathroom at a coffee shop. To exact retribution, Bruna enlists her love slaves and Dashiell to abduct the rapist. They dress up as prostitutes and lure him into a limousine. They lead him to a theatre where a Satanic sacrifice is performed. Dashiell later wipes Raymond&#x27;s blood all over Bruna.

== Cast ==

* Madonna as Bruna
* Charles Kurtz as Raymond Hall
* Kate Magill as Susan Porter
* Timmy Leight as The Landlady
* Michael Dane as Transvestite Slave
* Russell O. Lome as Male slave
* Angi Smit as Female slave
* Joseph Pattnosh as Father
* Ann Pattnosh as Mother
* John Joseph Pattnosh as Young David
* Chuck Varesko as Narrator

== Production and development ==
&quot;A Certain Sacrifice&quot; is a Super 8 film. It was made on a low-budget between $12,000 to $20,000. The film marks the acting debut of Madonna and the directorial debut of Stephen Jon Lewicki, an aspiring filmmaker. Various authors have regarded the movie as an underground art film.

Despite Madonna&#x27;s second thoughts about having participated in this movie, Lewicki had nothing but compliments for her. One of his oft-repeated stories was how he &quot;discovered&quot; Madonna and was amazed that she hand-wrote a three-page letter for a part that did not even pay. She was only paid $100, only because she was short on her apartment rent and Lewicki paid to help out. In Christopher Andersen&#x27;s 1991 biography, &quot;Madonna Unauthorized&quot;, Lewicki stated: &quot;That woman has more sensuality in her ear than most women have anywhere on their bodies&quot;.

Actor Jeremy Pattnosh wrote and performed several songs in the film, including: &quot;Certain Sacrifice&quot; and &quot;Screamin&#x27; Demon Lover&quot;. Years later, in a 2000 Channel 4 documentary on Madonna&#x27;s early years (titled &quot;Madonna: Naked Ambition&quot;), her Breakfast Club bandmate Dan Gilroy recalled: &quot;I did not like that fellow who made &quot;A Certain Sacrifice&quot;, I felt he was using them big-time [...] it needed a laugh-track, something&quot;.

== Release and reception ==
Madonna tried to buy the rights from director Stephen Jon Lewicki, offering him $5,000 which later upped to $10,000. Unsuccessful, she then attempted to ban the film from being seen. Stephen Lewicki invited her to view it; Madonna was reportedly unhappy with the result. According to Lewicki, she had an expression of horror on her face and screamed &quot;Fuck you&quot; as she stormed out of his apartment.

The release caused some controversy in the press at the time, due to film&#x27;s sexually explicit and violent content, obtaining a R rating. Writing for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Julie Salamon expressed: [...] Kind of a long MTV video with thinly developed themes of sadomasochism and ritual violence&quot;. Dennis Hunt from &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; referred to the &quot;tawdry drama&quot;, but saw Madonna an &quot;adequate actress&quot; who has several semi-nude scenes, further saying &quot;she does her best acting in the scene following a rape&quot;. Editor Victor Lenore described the movie a &quot;psychosexual fantasy, arty and cheap, that mixed thriller suspense, neogothic terror and softcore porn&quot;. &quot;Spartanburg Herald-Journal&quot;″s Joe Saitzman said is a basic home movie quality, the sound unbelievably bad, and the script nonexistent. Despite most viewers labeling the film a failure, it also developed a certain cult status among Madonna&#x27;s audiences and collectors at that time. The film was released in Italy in 1985. In 1986, there were theatrical midnight screenings in the U.S.

===Home video===
An exploitation film, &quot;A Certain Sacrifice&quot; was released on video to capitalize Madonna&#x27;s fame in 1985. The retail price was $49.95. The video release sold more than 50,000 copies in its first-week. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1985, Virgin Video, a joint venture of two independent distributors, had plans to distribute over one million copies of the home video by the end of 1985. Critics said that Madonna&#x27;s appearance in the film was the only reason it sold well, while Mark Bego commented it was purchased by hard-core Madonna devotees only.

Shortly after the video release, Lewicki received significant criticisms of &quot;exploiting&quot; Madonna&#x27;s image, which he responded, &quot;If people say that, I don&#x27;t mind&quot;. He previously commented, &quot;hope the videocassette makes lots of money&quot;. Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli claims the film made Lewicki a &quot;millionaire&quot; in 1985. Lewicki subsequently claimed that he deserved the financial success that came afterward, because he had taken a risk by casting an unknown Madonna, and the money he put into the movie. Saitzman referred to the release: &quot;It must be one of the most amateur, technically atrocious student films ever to be marketed&quot;, and added Madonna shouldn&#x27;t have worried to have prevent the film&#x27;s release, while called an irony from her part.

The municipality consists of the following sub-municipalities: Beez, Belgrade, Boninne, Bouge, Champion, Cognelée, Daussoulx, Dave, Erpent, Flawinne, Gelbressée, Jambes, Lives-sur-Meuse, Loyers, Malonne, Marche-les-Dames, Namur proper, Naninne, Saint-Servais, Saint-Marc, Suarlée, Temploux, Vedrin, Wépion, and Wierde.

==History==
===Early history===
The town began as an important trading settlement in Celtic times, straddling east–west and north–south trade routes across the Ardennes. The Romans established a presence after Julius Caesar defeated the local Aduatuci tribe.

Namur came to prominence during the early Middle Ages when the Merovingians built a castle or citadel on the rocky spur overlooking the town at the confluence of the two rivers. In the 10th century, it became a county in its own right. The town developed somewhat unevenly, as the counts of Namur could only build on the north bank of the Meuse - the south bank was owned by the bishops of Liège and developed more slowly into the town of Jambes (now effectively a suburb of Namur). In 1262, Namur fell into the hands of the Count of Flanders, and was purchased by Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy in 1421.

===17th–19th centuries===
After Namur became part of the Spanish Netherlands in the 1640s, its citadel was considerably strengthened. Louis XIV of France invaded in 1692, capturing the town and annexing it to France. His renowned military engineer Vauban rebuilt the citadel. French control was short-lived, as William III of Orange-Nassau captured Namur only three years later in 1695 during the War of the Grand Alliance. Under the Barrier Treaty of 1709, the Dutch gained the right to garrison Namur, although the subsequent Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 gave control of the formerly Spanish Netherlands to the Austrian House of Habsburg. Thus, although the Austrians ruled the town, the citadel was controlled by the Dutch. It was rebuilt again under their tenure.

General Jean-Baptiste Cyrus de Valence&#x27;s column laid siege to the city on 19 November 1792 during the War of the First Coalition and, after 12 days, the city surrendered on 1 December and its whole garrison of 3,000 men was taken prisoner. France invaded the region again in 1794, annexing Namur and imposing a repressive regime. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the Congress of Vienna incorporated what is now Belgium into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Belgium broke away from the Netherlands in 1830 following the Belgian Revolution, and Namur continued to be a major garrison town under the new government. The citadel was rebuilt yet again in 1887.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In World War I, Namur was a major target of the German invasion of Belgium in 1914, which sought to use the Meuse valley as a route into France. On August 21, 1914, the Germans bombarded the town of Namur without warning. Several people were killed. Despite being billed as virtually impregnable, the citadel fell after only three days&#x27; fighting and the town was occupied by the Germans for the rest of the war. Namur fared little better in World War II; it was in the front lines of both the Battle of the Ardennes in 1940 and the Battle of the Bulge in 1944. The town suffered heavy damage in both wars.

Namur continued to host the Belgian Army&#x27;s paratroopers until their departure in 1977.

After the creation of the Walloon Region, Namur was chosen as the seat of its executive and parliament. In 1986, Namur was officially declared capital of Wallonia. Its position as regional capital was confirmed by the Parliament of Wallonia in 2010.

==Economy==

Namur is an important commercial and industrial centre, located on the Walloon industrial backbone, the Sambre and Meuse valley. It produces machinery, leather goods, metals and porcelain. Its railway station is also an important junction situated on the north–south line between Brussels and Luxembourg City, and the east–west line between Lille and Liège. River barge traffic passes through the middle of the city along the Meuse.

==Culture and sights==

Namur has taken on a new role as the capital of the federal region of Wallonia. Its location at the head of the Ardennes has also made it a popular tourist centre, with a casino located in its southern district on the left bank of the Meuse.

The town&#x27;s most prominent sight is the Citadel of Namur, now demilitarised and open to the public. Namur also has a distinctive 18th-century cathedral dedicated to Saint Aubain and a belfry classified by UNESCO as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France which are listed as a World Heritage Site.

The Couvent des Soeurs de Notre-Dame used to contain masterpieces of Mosan art by Hugo d&#x27;Oignies, currently presented in the Musée des Arts Anciens (Rue de Fer). Elsewhere there is an archeological museum and a museum dedicated to Félicien Rops.

An odd Namurois custom is the joust on stilts (dating back to 1411) practiced by the stiltwalkers of Namur. The annual Combat de l&#x27;Échasse d&#x27;Or (&quot;Fight for the Golden Stilt&quot;), held on the third Sunday in September, is the most important joust of the year. Two teams, the Mélans and the Avresses, dress in medieval clothes while standing on stilts and do battle in one of the town&#x27;s principal squares. Since 2021, Namur stilt jousts are registered on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

Namur possesses a distinguished university, the University of Namur (previously known as the Facultés universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix, FUNDP), founded in 1831. The University of Louvain (UCLouvain) also has several facilities in the city through its UCLouvain Namur University Hospital (CHU UCLouvain Namur), the provinces&#x27; largest employer.

Since 1986 Namur has been home to the Namur International Festival of French-Speaking Film. A jazz (Nam&#x27;in&#x27;Jazz) and a rock (Verdur Rock) festival both take place in Namur annually.

Sights near Namur include Maredsous Abbey, Floreffe Abbey, and Annevoie Castle with its surrounding &quot;Jardins d&#x27;Annevoie&quot;.

==Sports==
The local football team is named Union Royale Namur.

The local baseball team is named Namur Angels.

The annual Namur cyclo-cross race, part of the UCI Cyclo-cross World Cup, takes place on the hills around the citadel. From 1950 to 2007, the Belgian Motocross Grand Prix was held every first weekend in August on a challenging race circuit around the citadel. Between 20,000 and 50,000 spectators gathered to support the Belgian motocross stars such as; Joël Robert, Roger De Coster, Eric Geboers &amp; Stefan Everts. The Namur circuit achieved iconic status and was known as the Monaco of the Motocross World Championships in reference to the prestigious Formula One automobile race.

<text>Philippeville (; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Namur, Belgium. The Philippeville municipality includes the former municipalities of Fagnolle, Franchimont, Jamagne, Jamiolle, Merlemont, Neuville, Omezée, Roly, Romedenne, Samart, Sart-en-Fagne, Sautour, Surice, Villers-en-Fagne, Villers-le-Gambon, and Vodecée.

==History==

===The foundation of Philippeville===
At the beginning of the 16th century, the Philippeville region was on the boundary between Charles V’s Burgundian Netherlands and Francis I’s France. Fighting around Philippeville did not start, however, until 1554, after Henry II had succeeded his father on the throne. This area was ideal for an attack as it was covered with forests, sparsely populated and divided among the County of Hainaut, that of Namur, by now part of Burgundy, and the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. The medieval forts in the area were taken and pillaged one after the other. The fortress of Mariembourg, close to Couvin, and the town of Givet soon fell to the French. In 1555, Charles V&#x27;s new commander, William the Silent, established a new fort in the village of Echerennes, a village known since the 9th century. He garrisoned his troops there as soon as the fort was completed, barely four months after the start of construction.

In 1556, Charles V named his new fortress &quot;Philippeville&quot; in honour of his son, Philip II of Spain, who would succeed him in the Netherlands – and on the city – the following year.

===From 1557 to present===

In 1659, the Treaty of the Pyrenees stopped the Franco-Spanish War (1635–59) and most frontier cities became French, until Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo. Philippeville itself was one of the final French fortresses to surrender following Waterloo in 1815. There was then a brief Dutch interlude until the Belgian Revolution in 1830.

A treaty drafted in London on 15 November 1831, which the Netherlands refused to sign, was followed by the Treaty of London (1839), which created the Kingdom of Belgium. Part of the terms of the treaty required the Philippeville&#x27;s fortifications, along with those of Menin, Ath, Mons and Mariembourg, to be dismantled. Philippeville&#x27;s defensive walls were dismantled in 1856 under the reign of King Leopold I, in accordance with the terms of the treaty, having been declared superfluous on account of Belgium&#x27;s enforced neutrality, and have been replaced by the wide boulevards that circle the city today.

==Sights==

* Ten kilometres of underground passages dating from the foundation of the city can still be explored under Philippeville. Some sections are open to tourists.

==Born in Philippeville==

*Jérôme-Joseph de Momigny, a noted composer and musicologist of the classical/romantic period, was born here on 20 January 1762.

<doc id="175715" wikidata="Q250406" url="?curid=175715" title="Like a Virgin (album)">
<text>Like a Virgin is the second studio album by American singer Madonna, released on November 12, 1984, by Sire Records. Following the success of her 1983 eponymous debut album, Madonna was eager to start working on its follow-up. She selected Nile Rodgers to produce the album due to his work on &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983) by David Bowie, which she was a fan of. To ensure it be exactly as she envisaged it, Madonna chose all the songs for the album: she penned five of her own, four of which were co-written with former boyfriend and collaborator Stephen Bray, and four were written by other artists. Recording sessions took place at Power Station studio in New York City. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic bandmates Bernard Edwards and Tony Thompson.

Upon release &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics: Rodgers&#x27;s production received praise, but Madonna&#x27;s vocals were criticized. It became Madonna&#x27;s first number one album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, as well as the first female album to sell over five million copies in the United States. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) later certified it diamond for shipment of ten million units. Overseas, it reached number one in Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom. With sales of over 21 million copies worldwide, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; remains one of the best-selling albums of all time. In the United States, four singles were released from the album ―all reached the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with the title track becoming Madonna&#x27;s first number one, and &quot;Material Girl&quot; reaching number two.

The album was promoted on Madonna&#x27;s first concert tour, the Virgin Tour of 1985, which only visited cities in North America. &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; has been noted as the album that made Madonna a superstar, as well as the one that proved she was not a one-hit wonder. On top of that, the younger female population began emulating the singer&#x27;s fashion style. In 2023, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States&#x27; National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress due to it being considered &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Background ==

Following the release of her 1983 self-titled debut album, and hit singles like &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Lucky Star&quot; and &quot;Borderline&quot;, Madonna became, according to author Craig Rosen, &quot;one of the most exciting new artists of the 1980s&quot;. Despite this, the singer wasn&#x27;t entirely pleased with how her first album had turned out, and was eager to start working on its follow-up. Of her upcoming second album, she told British magazine &quot;NME&quot;: &quot;The production won&#x27;t be so slick, because where Reggie [Lucas] and Mtume come from is a whole different school. I want a sound that&#x27;s mine&quot;, and even hinted at working with a British producer. To ensure the album be exactly as she envisioned it, Madonna requested her label Sire Records that she be allowed to produce herself, a request that was immediately denied.

Angry with the label, the singer would publicly vent during interviews, and refer to her bosses as a &quot;hierarchy of old men [...] a chauvinistic environment to be working in because I&#x27;m treated like this sexy little girl&quot;. The executives at Sire decided to allow Madonna to work with any producer of her choice. She picked Nile Rodgers, co-founder of American disco band Chic, and main producer of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983), one of her favorite albums of the time. Rodgers had previously met Madonna after attending one of her gigs at a New York City nightclub, and was impressed with her stage presence; &quot;I kept thinking to myself, &#x27;Damn, is she a star&#x27;, but she wasn&#x27;t at that time. I always wanted to work with her and this seemed like the perfect opportunity&quot;. However, when the time came he initially hesitated, as he had been warned by several people that Madonna was a &quot;totally self-centered bitch&quot; and a &quot;pain in the ass to work with&quot;. When the two actually met, Rodgers quickly changed his mind and said the singer was great and a &quot;true professional&quot;. Madonna, by her part, &quot;couldn&#x27;t believe that the record company actually gave me the money so that I could work with [Rodgers]&quot;.

== Development ==

Madonna wanted &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; to be &quot;stronger&quot; than her debut, hence she chose all the songs herself. She had been penning songs and creating demos with former boyfriend and collaborator Stephen Bray since early 1984. When Madonna first met with Rodgers, she allegedly told him, &quot;if you don&#x27;t love these songs we can&#x27;t work together&quot;, to which the producer responded: &quot;I don&#x27;t love them now, but I will when I&#x27;ve finished working on them!&quot;. Around the time they began working on the album, Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly were pitching songs to artists. Steinberg had begun a new relationship and came up with the lyrics to &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. He brought the track to Kelly, who created the music and, together, recorded a demo tape. Kelly then met with Warner Bros. A&amp;R executive Michael Ostin and had him listen to the demo; Ostin, who was set to meet Madonna the next day, thought the song was &quot;perfect&quot; for her. Madonna &quot;loved&quot; the song right away, but Rodgers wasn&#x27;t convinced. He felt it was &quot;really queer&quot;, and that the line &quot;like a virgin&quot; wasn&#x27;t a &quot;terrific&quot; hook, nor an &quot;all-time catch phrase&quot;. Four days later, Rodgers realized that the song was still stuck in his head; &quot;[It] grew on me. I really started to like it. [...] [I] handed [my] apology [to Madonna] and said, &#x27;you know... if it&#x27;s so catchy, it must be something. So let&#x27;s do it&quot;. Written by Peter Brown and Robert Rans for another Warner Bros. singer, &quot;Material Girl&quot; was also presented to Madonna by Ostin.

Ostin also suggested that the singer covered Rose Royce&#x27;s &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (1978). He was driving into work and heard the song on the radio; &quot;I called [Nile and Madonna], they were in the studio. I said, &#x27;I have an idea. You know the old Rose Royce record, &#x27;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&#x27;? Why don&#x27;t you try and record a version of it?&quot;. Both Rodgers and Madonna were reluctant, but ultimately decided that a ballad could be a good move to bring &quot;diversity&quot; to the album. The final song to be created for &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was &quot;Dress You Up&quot;. Rodgers had previously asked songwriters Andrea LaRusso and Peggy Stanziale to write a song for Madonna in the style of Chic but, due to other projects, the composition took time. When the lyrics of the song were submitted, Rodgers turned them down as he felt there was no time to compose a melody and record it for the album; however, Madonna liked them and persuaded the producer to include the track.

&quot;Into the Groove&quot; was written and produced by Madonna and former Bray, and recorded at Sigma Sound Studios . Inspired by the dance floor and a Puerto Rican boy the singer was attracted to, it was used on the Susan Seidelman-directed film &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;, which Madonna starred. The song was originally written for Cheyne, the fifteen-year old protégée of Mark Kamins, the man who discovered Madonna&#x27;s debut single &quot;Everybody&quot; (1982) and took her to Sire Records. Madonna then decided to record the track herself and use it on &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;, much to Kamins&#x27; dismay.

== Recording ==

Recording sessions took place at New York&#x27;s Power Station studios in April 1984. Rodgers envisioned a &quot;simpler set-up&quot; and, after hearing Madonna&#x27;s demos, came to the conclusion they were too similar to what she had done on her debut: Heavily sequenced and synthesizer-led. He decided that the singer needed a &quot;more streetwise sound&quot;, and to record with a live band. Rodgers subsequently assembled a rhythm section consisting of himself on guitar, Chic colleagues Bernard Edwards and Tony Thompson on bass and drums, respectively. Sessions took place in the afternoon, as Rodgers would attend late-night parties and wasn&#x27;t used to work in the morning. It was Jason Corsaro, the album&#x27;s audio engineer, who persuaded the producer to use digital recording, a new technique he believed was going to be the &quot;future&quot; of recording. He brought in a Sony 3324 24-track digital tape recorder and a Sony F1 two-track, which were used for the mixing.

Madonna&#x27;s vocals were recorded at the studio&#x27;s small, wooden, high-ceilinged piano room at the back. Corsaro would place gobos around her while using the top capsule of a stereo AKG C24 tube microphone, with a Schoeps microphone preamplifier and a Pultec equalizer. &quot;That was part of the Power Station way&quot; ―recalled Corsaro― &quot;nothing was subtle and everything had a particular sound&quot;. Once the tracks met with everybody&#x27;s approval, Robert Sabino added the keyboard parts; he did this by playing a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, as well as some Rhodes and acoustic piano. Rodgers also played the Synclavier on this part. Corsaro remembered that the final songs &quot;adhered very closely&quot; to the Bray-produced demos, which were &quot;quite simple in structure. All we did was get better musicians&quot;. Madonna, although not required, was present every minute of the recording and mixing processes; Corsaro commented: &quot;Nile was there most of the time, but she was there all of the time. She never left&quot;. After hearing the album, Madonna&#x27;s then manager Freddy DeMann pressured her to &quot;put a little more bass on it&quot;, and make it sound like Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982). All the singer did was write the words &quot;Bass Up&quot; on the record&#x27;s box without altering a thing.

== Composition ==
Alexis Petridis from &quot;The Guardian&quot; described &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; as a &quot;cocktail of post-disco dance music, with a dash of hip-hop and a surprisingly large shot of choppy, angular new wave rock&quot;. Nicole Horning, author of &quot;Pop Music: Chart-Toppers Throughout History&quot;, categorized it as a dance-pop album in a style of new wave, which melded disco, rock, sixties pop, and synthesizer, or synth-based, electronic music. Noted as an &quot;80s teen-pop&quot; take on Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, opener &quot;Material Girl&quot; is a synth-pop song with disco and new wave elements. A tongue-in-cheek satire on the superficiality and materialism of the 1980s, Madonna sings in a shrill voice about how she won&#x27;t accept men who cannot provide her with wealth and luxuries, because &quot;we are living in a material world&quot;. Throughout the song, a robotic male voice repeats the hook &quot;living in a material world&quot;. The second track, &quot;Angel&quot;, begins with the sound of twinkling synths and giggles. It is an &quot;ode to heavenly love&quot; with a new wave overtone, built on an ascending hook consisting of a three chord sequence, which serves for the verse and refrain. One of the lyrics is taken from Public Image Ltd&#x27;s &quot;Death Disco&quot; (1979), while Rodgers provides pizzicato guitars.

The title track, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, is a &quot;mildly titillating&quot; dance-rock song, in which the singer talks about how true love can make a girl feel &quot;shiny and new&quot;. The bass-line on the introduction is a reworking of the Four Tops&#x27; &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)&quot; (1965). Madonna sings in a &quot;little girl lost&quot; voice the opening line &quot;I made it through the wilderness/Somehow, I made it through/Didn&#x27;t know how lost I was until I found you&quot;. The drums, played by Tony Thompson, give the track &quot;far more whallop than a drum machine ever could&quot;, according to Rikky Rooksby, author of &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna&quot;. The lyrics to the fourth track, &quot;Over and Over&quot;, talk about determination and picking oneself up from disappointments; &quot;I get up again, over and over&quot;, Madonna sings in the refrain. Instrumentation and production are sparse, featuring only a &quot;silky&quot; guitar.

&quot;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; is the only ballad on the album, as well as the most soulful. The song echoes back to Philadelphia soul, and features acoustic guitar and synth strings on the first half. Lyrically, it is about a woman being abandoned and &quot;emptied of love&quot;. Madonna sings in a &quot;tearful, angsty&quot; tone as the track &quot;builds and the strings undulate, belting that last &quot;anymore&quot; until she&#x27;s literally panting for breath&quot;. Included only on the 1985 international re-issue of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, Madonna&#x27;s voice in &quot;Into the Groove&quot; is doubletracked. The track has a &quot;bumping&quot; synth-bass line, while the lyrics celebrate &quot;dancefloor escapism&quot;, and juxtapose music, dance, sex and love. &quot;Dress You Up&quot; is a &quot;drum machine-driven&quot; dance song with a nu-disco beat, consisting of a two-chord verse. It features a guitar solo on its bridge, while Madonna sings about clothes she would like to drape over her lover, so that she can cover him with &quot;velvet kisses&quot;, and caress his body with her hands.

The seventh track, &quot;Shoo-Bee-Doo&quot;, begins as a stripped-down piano ballad, before turning into a &quot;deceptively bouncy ditty&quot;. The song reminiscences doo-wop and girl groups like the Shirelles and the Ronettes, while the lyrics deal with relationship problems, and Madonna trying to get through to her confused lover. Starting with the refrain followed by an opening verse, the eighth track &quot;Pretender&quot; is a synth-pop song about seduction and the insecurity felt by Madonna as she &quot;[lets] things happen too fast&quot; with a man who &quot;isn&#x27;t what he seems&quot;. &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; closes with &quot;Stay&quot;, a song that features a fast triple rhythm with synths. The hook consists of the phrase &quot;stay, darling&quot; being repeated over and over. Also present is the noise of someone slapping a microphone and a spoken sequence towards the end.

== Artwork and release ==

&quot;Like a Virgin&quot; takes its name after the eponymous song. Madonna herself found the phrase &quot;ironic and provocative [...] how can you be &quot;like&quot; a virgin? I liked the play on words&quot;. Author Graham Thompson felt that the title makes a &quot;provocative link&quot; between the singer&#x27;s own religious name—Madonna as the Catholic title for Jesus&#x27; mother Mary—and the Christian concept of the virgin birth. The artwork for &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was shot by Steven Meisel at a suite in the St. Regis New York. The sepia-tinted cover shows the singer lying on a satin bed, decked out in a wedding dress, with a tight-fitting bustier, full-length gloves, and a belt buckle that reads &quot;Boy Toy&quot;; she stares directly at the camera with heavy make-up and messy hair.

Stylist and designer Maripol described the singer&#x27;s look as that of a &quot;bride of Satan&quot;. Matthew Rettenmund, author of &quot;Encyclopedia Madonnica&quot;, wrote: &quot;[The cover] effectively communicates the conflicted views of what a wedding dress &quot;should&quot; represent (virginity), and what [...] it &quot;does&quot; represent (sexual knowingness). Thompson added that the artwork shows the singer, &quot;not just as an object of desire, but also as a desiring female subject&quot;. Colombian music journalist Manolo Bellon pointed out that in the cover, Madonna plays a character for the first time: She portrays a &quot;virgin who doesn&#x27;t want to be [one]&quot;. The singer herself referred to the photograph as a &quot;statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome. But if you wanna be a whore, it&#x27;s your fucking right to be so&quot;. From &quot;Billboard&quot;, Joe Lynch named it Madonna&#x27;s second best album cover.

Even though it was completed by the end of April, the release of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was held back, due to the success of &quot;Borderline&quot; and the continuing sales of Madonna&#x27;s first album, which at that point exceeded one million copies in the United States. Rodgers himself recalled: &quot;We finished [&quot;Like a Virgin&quot;], but &quot;Madonna&quot; (the album) was still the focus [...] then &#x27;Borderline&#x27; hit out of the clear blue sky. We didn&#x27;t expect that&quot;. On June 30, 1984, Brian Chin from &quot;Billboard&quot; announced that the album would be released the following month. On October 6, the release date was reported to be the 29th of that month. &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was officially released on November 12, 1984. In August 1985, it was re-issued outside of North America with additional track &quot;Into the Groove&quot;, which at the time had sold over a million copies and reached number one in the UK. On May 22, 2001, Warner Bros. released a remastered edition of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; with additional remixes of the title track and &quot;Material Girl&quot;, but without &quot;Into the Groove&quot;. It was reissued on clear vinyl on November 8, 2019.

== Promotion ==
=== Live performances and tour ===
On May 16, 1984, after recording was complete, Madonna sang &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;Dress You Up&quot; at a party offered by artist Keith Haring at New York&#x27;s Paradise Garage. Four months later, on September 14, Madonna opened the inaugural MTV Video Music Awards ceremony with a performance of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. She emerged from a 17-foot wedding cake donning the same wedding dress from the album cover. During the number, she slithered and writhed across the floor, with her dress going up and her underpants showing. The singer explained that this was not intentional, as one of her shoes had come off at the beginning and she simply had tried to reach for it; &quot;I thought, &#x27;Well, I&#x27;ll just pretend I meant to do this&#x27;, and I dove on the floor and I rolled around&quot;, she later recalled. MTV&#x27;s Jessie Peterson opined that the performance put Madonna &quot;on the map as Queen of Pop Music&quot;, and established the VMAs as &quot;the place where water-cooler moments happen&quot;. It was named one of the best performances in the show&#x27;s history by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot;. On December 13, Madonna sang &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; on British television program &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, decked out in a pink wig and golden metallic jacket. It was named the second best performance on the show&#x27;s history.

&quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was further promoted on the Virgin Tour, Madonna&#x27;s first concert tour, which visited cities in the US and Canada from April to June 1985. The tour received mixed critical reviews but was a commercial success, with &quot;Billboard&quot; reporting a gross of $3.3 million ($ million in dollars); all 17,672 tickets for the concert at New York City&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall sold out in a record-breaking 34 minutes. One of the Detroit concerts was filmed and release in VHS as &quot;Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour&quot;.

=== Singles ===

In the United States, title track &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was released as lead single on October 31, 1984. In most European countries, it was issued on November 11. Upon release, it received generally positive reviews from critics, who singled out Madonna&#x27;s vocals and deemed it her first signature song. Additionally, it became her first number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The accompanying music video was directed by Mary Lambert, and shows the singer sailing down the canals of Venice in a gondola, and roaming around a castle in a white wedding dress.

Second single &quot;Material Girl&quot; was first released in the US on November 30, whereas in Europe it was published on February 18, 1985. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it&#x27;s one of the songs that made Madonna an icon, along with &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. Commercially, it was successful, reaching the Hot 100&#x27;s second spot, and the third spot of the UK Singles Chart. The music video, also directed by Lambert, is a homage to Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s performance of &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; from the 1953 film &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;.

&quot;Angel&quot; was released as the third single on April 10, 1985. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, with some calling it a &quot;classic&quot; and others deeming it sub-par compared to the singer&#x27;s previous works. &quot;Angel&quot; became Madonna&#x27;s fifth consecutive top-five single on the Hot 100. &quot;Into the Groove&quot; was released in the UK on July 15. It wasn&#x27;t given a release in the US, instead it was issued as B-side to the 12-inch maxi-single of &quot;Angel&quot;, thus was ineligible to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Angel&quot;/&quot;Into the Groove&quot; reached the first spot of the Dance Club Songs chart. &quot;Billboard&quot; readers voted &quot;Into the Groove&quot; the best dance single from the 1980s decade.

Final single &quot;Dress You Up&quot; was released on July 24, 1985. Critics reacted positively towards the track, referring to it as irresistible. Despite positive feedback, &quot;Dress You Up&quot; was added to the Parents Music Resource Center&#x27;s &quot;Filthy Fifteen&quot; list due to perceived sexual innuendo in its lyrics. It fared well commercially, reaching the fifth spot on both the Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. A promotional two-sided 7-inch single of &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; and &quot;Over and Over&quot; was released in Japan in March 1986.

=== Video compilation ===
A VHS video compilation titled &quot;Madonna&quot; was made available in December 1984; it included the videos for &quot;Borderline&quot;, &quot;Burning Up&quot;, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, and an extended mix of &quot;Lucky Star&quot;. The release topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Music Videocassette chart from April 13 to November 9, 1985, and was the year&#x27;s best selling music videocassette. Additionally, &quot;Madonna&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 100,000 units, and was recognized as the &quot;Best Selling Video Cassette Merchandised as Music Video&quot; by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers. According to &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, the video has sold over one million copies. To promote the release, a party was held on Chicago&#x27;s Cabaret Metro on February 9, 1985. Dubbed &quot;The Virgin Party&quot;, it drew a crowd of around 1,200 people; attendees were encouraged to wear white, and for $5 admission fees, were able to view the &quot;Madonna&quot; videocassette and the &quot;Material Girl&quot; music video. The event was organized as a drive to promote music videos, which at that point did not have a large market.

== Critical reception ==

Reviews of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; were mixed upon release. From &quot;Billboard&quot;, Brian Chine called it a &quot;fine&quot; second album, even though Madonna &quot;does no searching whatsoever in her singing [...] [She] hits her notes straight on, and with a pretty enough melody&quot;. Also from &quot;Billboard&quot;, Michael Paoletta praised Rodgers&#x27; &quot;sleek but snewy rhythm arrangements&quot;. From &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden was pleased with the &quot;handsomely produced&quot; record and the singer&#x27;s voice, which he felt echoed the &quot;rock-and-roll girl-group tradition that preceded the Beatles&quot;, but while these &quot;worshipfully extolled their boyfriends&#x27; cars, haircuts and rebel poses, Madonna&#x27;s point of view is decidedly more self-interested&quot;. &quot;The words &#x27;shiny and new&#x27; describe not only the way the love-smitten singer feels in the title song but the sound of the album&quot;, concluded Holden. Debby Miller from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; opined that, &quot;[d]espite [Madonna&#x27;s] little-girl voice, there&#x27;s an undercurrent of ambition that makes her more than the latest Betty Boop [...] Her light voice bobs over the heavy rhythm and synth tracks like a kid on a carnival ride&quot;. Author J. Randy Taraborrelli applauded Madonna&#x27;s voice for being &quot;reflectively sharper&quot; than on her debut, and felt &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; reflected her as a &quot;more versatile and artistic performer&quot;. From streaming service Tidal, John Murph described the album as &quot;far warmer, fuller and more soulful than the often cold and tinny synth sounds that typified a lot of underground dance music&quot; of the time.

The album was described as &quot;smart, funny, sexy and irresistible&quot; by &quot;Q&quot; magazine, while for &quot;The National&quot;″s Saeed Saeed, it is a &quot;ruthlessly focused collection of pop songs [...] featuring at least three pop classics&quot;. Alexis Petridis referred to &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; as &quot;provocative, fun, [and] witty [...] [It&#x27;s also] the last album on which Madonna sounded like a product of the environment that birthed her&quot;. It was deemed a &quot;masterpiece&quot; by Joseph Earp from Australian website Junkee. WhatCulture&#x27;s Reece Shrewsbury felt the songs on &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; are stronger than those on &quot;Madonna&quot;. To Matthew Rettenmund, &quot;[&quot;Like a Virgin&quot;] is not Madonna&#x27;s strongest album, but its nine tracks feature [her] at her least self-conscious and most cleverly effervescent&quot;. Daryl Easlea praised Rodgers&#x27; production, but felt the album &quot;tapers off, veering towards filler&quot; on its second half. Despite being home to some of the &quot;catchiest, not to mention most iconic tracks in pop music&quot;, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; is made up of &quot;mostly fillers&quot;, according to the staff of &quot;Instinct&quot; magazine.

Pete Bishop from &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; wrote that in &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, Madonna &quot;sort of hum-de-dums her way through [...] a lot of simple love lyrics over a lot of lightweight, pop-style fun-rock [...] sometimes sounding like a one-woman Pointer Sisters and sometimes like Cyndi Lauper with her nose pinched shut&quot;. Despite naming it &quot;pleasant enough&quot;, Bishop concluded that its main &quot;weakness&quot; is that, &quot;you could put these [songs] behind &quot;any&quot; decent-voiced singer. &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; does not establish Madonna as anything special&quot;. Taraborrelli added that, when compared to Madonna&#x27;s subsequent records, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; &quot;does come across as a bit repetitious and immature&quot;. Both Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; and Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt it is not as &quot;innovative&quot; as Madonna&#x27;s first record, with the former adding: &quot;[On the first album], she stunned with style and a certain joy. Here, the calculation is apparent, and while that&#x27;s part of [her] essence - even something that makes her fun - it throws [&quot;Like a Virgin&quot;]&#x27;s balance off a little too much for it to be consistent&quot;. This sentiment was echoed by Sam Damshenas and Daniel Megarry from &quot;Gay Times&quot;, who wrote that, like &quot;Madonna&quot;, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; lacks the innovation of the singer&#x27;s posterior works. The staff of &quot;The Advocate&quot; concluded that, &quot;this could have been the best EP of the &#x27;80s, with generation-defining songs [...] Instead it was a nine-song album with five great singles and four tracks that unbelievably escaped the cutting room floor&quot;. In the same vein, Erlewine added that the singles &quot;overshadow&quot; the rest of the album, which &quot;vacillates wildly in terms of quality&quot;. To Michael Paoletta from &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; hasn&#x27;t aged as well as the singer&#x27;s other works from the 1980s decade. &quot;People&quot; magazine dismissed the record as a &quot;tolerable bit of fluff&quot; with &quot;primitive&quot; lyrics.

== Commercial performance ==
In the United States, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; debuted at number 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on December 1, 1984. The following week, it climbed to number ten. The album reached the chart&#x27;s first spot on February 9, 1985, where it spent three weeks. Madonna became the third female artist in the 1980s decade ―after Barbra Streisand and Kim Carnes― to score both a number one album and single, as the title track had reached the Hot 100&#x27;s top spot two weeks prior. Three weeks after its release, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; had sold over three million copies. By July 1985, it had become the first album by a female to sell over five million copies in the United States. The record came in at the third spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 year-end chart for 1985. It was eventually certified ten times platinum (diamond) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipment of ten million copies. After the advent of the Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991, the album sold a further 574,000 copies as of August 2010. Another 882,000 units were sold at the BMG Music Club, which are not counted by the Nielsen SoundScan. Along with &quot;True Blue&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990), &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; is one of Madonna&#x27;s best-selling albums in the United States.

In Canada, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; debuted on the 78th spot of the &quot;RPM&quot; Albums Chart on November 10, 1984; it climbed up the chart and eventually reached the third spot on February 16, 1985. The album was present for a total of 74 weeks on the chart, and was certified diamond by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), for shipment of one million copies. &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; reached the fifth position of &quot;RPM&quot;″s 1985 year-end chart. 750,000 copies were sold in Latin America as of June 1986.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; debuted at number 74 on the UK Albums Chart, on November 24, 1984. However, it fluctuated on the chart for the next eight months and it wasn&#x27;t until September that it finally reached the chart&#x27;s top. The album was certified three times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and has sold over a million copies there. In France, the album debuted and peaked at number five on the French Albums Chart on October 6, 1985, staying there for eight weeks. &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was certified two times platinum by the Syndicat National de l&#x27;Édition Phonographique (SNEP) for shipment of 600,000 copies. &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; reached number the first place on European countries like Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Italy. &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; became Madonna&#x27;s first number one album on the European Top 100 Albums, reaching the summit on November 18, 1985, and remaining there for two weeks. Over 2 million copies were sold across Europe by the end of 1985.

In Australia, the album debuted and peaked at the second position of the Kent Music Report albums chart, and was certified seven times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 490,000 copies. &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; remained at the top of the New Zealand Albums Chart for three consecutive weeks, and was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) for the shipping of 75,000 copies. With over 21 million copies sold worldwide, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; is one of the best-selling albums of all time.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Like a Virgin&quot; has been referred to as the album that made Madonna a superstar. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: &quot;Madonna had hits with her first album [...] but she didn&#x27;t become an icon, until &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;&quot;. Similarly, Sam Damshenas and Daniel Megarry referred to the album as the one that cemented the singer as a &quot;force to be reckoned with in the world of pop&quot;. This opinion was shared by John Murph, who added that &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; allowed Madonna to &quot;create an archetype of pop stardom that the likes of Gwen Stefani, P!nk and Lady Gaga have followed&quot;. To Daniel Garrán from Spanish radio station Los 40, &quot;[&quot;Like a Virgin&quot;] proved [Madonna] was not a one-hit wonder but a versatile artist capable of cementing her place in the music world [...] pop culture gave in to her charms&quot;.

Stephen Holden wrote: &quot;No phenomenon illustrates more pointedly how pop music history seems to run in cycles than the overnight success of Madonna. The month before Christmas [...] Teen-agers were lining up in stores to purchase [&quot;Like a Virgin&quot;] the way their parents had lined up to buy Beatles records in the late 60&#x27;s&quot;. With the album, the singer was able to take charge of her career, according to the staff of Rhino Entertainment. Chris Smith, author of &quot;101 Albums That Changed Popular Music&quot;, where &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was included, added that it helped Madonna &quot;steal the spotlight towards herself. [Asserting] her sexuality as only male rock stars had done before, moving well beyond the limited confines of being a pop artist, to becoming a focal point for nationwide discussions of power relationships in the areas of sex, race, gender, religion, and other divisive social topics&quot;. For &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Caroline Sullivan, Madonna became the &quot;biggest thing to hit pop&quot; since &quot;a woman in control of her sex life and career was such a new idea&quot;.

According to Santiago Fouz-Hernandez, one of the authors of &quot;Madonna&#x27;s Drowned Worlds&quot;, following the album&#x27;s release and Virgin tour, young girls everywhere started emulating Madonna&#x27;s style. The singer herself recalled that women would show up to the concerts with &quot;flap skirts on and tights cut off below their knees and lace gloves and rosaries and bows in their hair and big hoop earrings. I was like, &#x27;This is insane!&#x27;&quot;. Madonna look-alike contests were held in shopping malls across the United States, with artist Andy Warhol allegedly serving as judge in one of them. Nathan Smith from &quot;Out&quot; magazine wrote that young women idolized the &quot;transformative transgressions of Madonna, a star who wanted to be in control of sexual identity and dictate the terms of her own erotic encounters&quot;. Smith ultimately concluded that, &quot;[&quot;Like a Virgin&quot;] stands today as a polemic for the reborn woman of the 1980s: empowered, sexually demonstrative, financially independent, and drawing on old antiquated traditions to move ahead in the world&quot;. Sal Cinquemani placed the record among the &quot;most definitive pop artifacts from the indulgent Reagan Era&quot;.

&quot;Like a Virgin&quot; is considered one of the best albums of 1984 and of the 1980s decade. In 2017, NPR named &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; one of the greatest albums ever made by a woman, with Alison Fensterstock writing: &quot;All that came with [the album], made it clear that there would never be a pop music landscape without the impact and influence of Madonna again&quot;. &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; considered &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; the second best sophomore album of all time, with Michael Roffman saying it &quot;carved out the throne, the crown, and the title that would be Madonna&#x27;s forever: The Queen of Pop&quot;. Chuck Arnold, writing for &quot;Billboard&quot;, concluded that, &quot;Madonna has definitely made better albums than &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; — among them, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; [and] &quot;Ray of Light&quot; — but her second LP changed the course of pop history&quot;. According to Taraborrelli, &quot;every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist&#x27;s magic moment; for Madonna, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was just such a defining moment&quot;. Finally, in 2023, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States&#x27; National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress due to it being considered &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>In electrical engineering, electrical elements are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electrical components, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors, used in the analysis of electrical networks. All electrical networks can be analyzed as multiple electrical elements interconnected by wires. Where the elements roughly correspond to real components, the representation can be in the form of a schematic diagram or circuit diagram. This is called a lumped-element circuit model. In other cases, infinitesimal elements are used to model the network in a distributed-element model.

These ideal electrical elements represent actual, physical electrical or electronic components. Still, they do not exist physically and are assumed to have ideal properties. In contrast, actual electrical components have less than ideal properties, a degree of uncertainty in their values, and some degree of nonlinearity. To model the nonideal behavior of a real circuit component may require a combination of multiple ideal electrical elements to approximate its function. For example, an inductor circuit element is assumed to have inductance but no resistance or capacitance, while a real inductor, a coil of wire, has some resistance in addition to its inductance. This may be modeled by an ideal inductance element in series with a resistance.

Circuit analysis using electric elements is useful for understanding practical networks of electrical components. Analyzing how a network is affected by its individual elements makes it possible to estimate how a real network will behave.

==Types==
Circuit elements can be classified into different categories. One is how many terminals they have to connect them to other components:
* One-port elements represent the simplest components, with only two terminals to connect to. Examples are 
** resistances, 
** capacitances, 
** inductances, 
** and diodes.
* Two-port elements are the most common multiport elements with four terminals consisting of two ports.
* Multiport elementsthese have more than two terminals. They connect to the external circuit through multiple pairs of terminals called ports. For example, 
** a transformer with three separate windings has six terminals and could be idealized as a three-port element; the ends of each winding are connected to a pair of terminals representing a port.

Elements can also be divided into active and passive:

* Passive elementsThese elements do not have a source of energy; examples are 
** diodes, 
** resistances, 
** capacitances, 
** and inductances.

* Active elements or sourcesthese are elements which can source electrical power. They can be used to represent ideal batteries and power supplies; examples are 
** voltage sources 
** and current sources. 
*** Dependent sourcesThese are two-port elements with a voltage or current source proportional to the voltage or current at a second pair of terminals. These are used in the modelling of amplifying components such as
**** transistors, 
**** vacuum tubes, 
**** and op-amps.

Another distinction is between linear and nonlinear:
* Linear elementsthese are elements in which the constituent relation, the relation between voltage and current, is a linear function. They obey the superposition principle. Examples of linear elements are resistances, capacitances, inductances, and linear-dependent sources. Circuits with only linear elements, linear circuits, do not cause intermodulation distortion and can be easily analysed with powerful mathematical techniques such as the Laplace transform.
* Nonlinear elementsthese are elements in which the relation between voltage and current is a nonlinear function. An example is a diode, where the current is an exponential function of the voltage. Circuits with nonlinear elements are harder to analyse and design, often requiring circuit simulation computer programs such as SPICE.

==One-port elements==
Only nine types of element (memristor not included), five passive and four active, are required to model any electrical component or circuit. Each element is defined by a relation between the state variables of the network: current, formula_1; voltage, formula_2; charge, formula_3; and magnetic flux, formula_4.
* Two sources:
** Current source, measured in amperes – produces a current in a conductor. Affects charge according to the relation formula_5.
** Voltage source, measured in volts – produces a potential difference between two points. Affects magnetic flux according to the relation formula_6.
::formula_4 in this relationship does not necessarily represent anything physically meaningful. In the case of the current generator, formula_3, the time integral of current represents the quantity of electric charge physically delivered by the generator. Here formula_4 is the time integral of voltage, but whether or not that represents a physical quantity depends on the nature of the voltage source. For a voltage generated by magnetic induction, it is meaningful, but for an electrochemical source, or a voltage that is the output of another circuit, no physical meaning is attached to it.
::Both these elements are necessarily non-linear elements. See #Non-linear elements below.
* Three passive elements:
** Resistance formula_10, measured in ohms – produces a voltage proportional to the current flowing through the element. Relates voltage and current according to the relation formula_11.
** Capacitance formula_12, measured in farads – produces a current proportional to the rate of change of voltage across the element. Relates charge and voltage according to the relation formula_13.
** Inductance formula_14, measured in henries – produces the magnetic flux proportional to the rate of change of current through the element. Relates flux and current according to the relation formula_15.
* Four abstract active elements:
** Voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS) Generates a voltage based on another voltage with respect to a specified gain. (has infinite input impedance and zero output impedance).
** Voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) Generates a current based on a voltage elsewhere in the circuit, with respect to a specified gain, used to model field-effect transistors and vacuum tubes (has infinite input impedance and infinite output impedance). The gain is characterised by a transfer conductance which will have units of siemens.
** Current-controlled voltage source (CCVS) Generates a voltage based on an input current elsewhere in the circuit with respect to a specified gain. (has zero input impedance and zero output impedance). Used to model trancitors. The gain is characterised by a transfer impedance which will have units of ohms.
** Current-controlled current source (CCCS) Generates a current based on an input current and a specified gain. Used to model bipolar junction transistors. (Has zero input impedance and infinite output impedance).
::These four elements are examples of two-port elements.

===Non-linear elements===

In reality, all circuit components are non-linear and can only be approximated as linear over a certain range. To describe the passive elements more precisely, their constitutive relation is used instead of simple proportionality. Six constitutive relations can be formed from any two of the circuit variables. From this, there is supposed to be a theoretical fourth passive element since there are only five elements in total (not including the various dependent sources) found in linear network analysis. This additional element is called memristor. It only has any meaning as a time-dependent non-linear element; as a time-independent linear element, it reduces to a regular resistor. Hence, it is not included in linear time-invariant (LTI) circuit models. The constitutive relations of the passive elements are given by;
* Resistance: constitutive relation defined as formula_16.
* Capacitance: constitutive relation defined as formula_17.
* Inductance: constitutive relation defined as formula_18.
* Memristance: constitutive relation defined as formula_19.

:where formula_20 is an arbitrary function of two variables.

In some special cases, the constitutive relation simplifies to a function of one variable. This is the case for all linear elements, but also, for example, an ideal diode, which in circuit theory terms is a non-linear resistor, has a constitutive relation of the form formula_21. Both independent voltage and independent current sources can be considered non-linear resistors under this definition.

The fourth passive element, the memristor, was proposed by Leon Chua in a 1971 paper, but a physical component demonstrating memristance was not created until thirty-seven years later. It was reported on April 30, 2008, that a working memristor had been developed by a team at HP Labs led by scientist R. Stanley Williams. With the advent of the memristor, each pairing of the four variables can now be related.

Two special non-linear elements are sometimes used in analysis but are not the ideal counterpart of any real component:
* Nullator: defined as formula_22
* Norator: defined as an element that places no restrictions on voltage and current whatsoever.

These are sometimes used in models of components with more than two terminals: transistors, for instance.

==Two-port elements==
All the above are two-terminal, or one-port, elements except the dependent sources. Two lossless, passive, linear two-port elements are typically introduced into network analysis. Their constitutive relations in matrix notation are;

;Transformer:

: formula_23

;Gyrator:

: formula_24

The transformer maps a voltage at one port to a voltage at the other in a ratio of &quot;n&quot;. The current between the same two ports is mapped by 1/&quot;n&quot;. On the other hand, the gyrator maps a voltage at one port to a current at the other. Likewise, currents are mapped to voltages. The quantity &quot;r&quot; in the matrix is in units of resistance. The gyrator is a necessary element in analysis because it is not reciprocal. Networks built from just the basic linear elements are necessarily reciprocal, so they cannot be used by themselves to represent a non-reciprocal system. It is not essential, however, to have both the transformer and gyrator. Two gyrators in cascade are equivalent to a transformer, but the transformer is usually retained for convenience. The introduction of the gyrator also makes either capacitance or inductance non-essential since a gyrator terminated with one of these at port 2 will be equivalent to the other at port 1. However, transformer, capacitance, and inductance are normally retained in analysis because they are the ideal properties of the basic physical components transformer, inductor, and capacitor, whereas a practical gyrator must be constructed as an active circuit.

==Examples==
The following are examples of representations of components by way of electrical elements.
* On a first degree of approximation, a battery is represented by a voltage source. A more refined model also includes a resistance in series with the voltage source to represent the battery&#x27;s internal resistance (which results in the battery heating and the voltage dropping when in use). A current source in parallel may be added to represent its leakage (which discharges the battery over a long period).
* On a first degree of approximation, a resistor is represented by a resistance. A more refined model also includes a series inductance to represent the effects of its lead inductance (resistors constructed as a spiral have more significant inductance). A capacitance in parallel may be added to represent the capacitive effect of the proximity of the resistor leads to each other. A wire can be represented as a low-value resistor.
* Current sources are often used when representing semiconductors. For example, on a first degree of approximation, a bipolar transistor may be represented by a variable current source controlled by the input current.

<text>A fantasy world or fictional world is a world created for fictional media, such as literature, film or games. Typical fantasy worlds feature magical abilities. Some worlds may be a parallel world connected to Earth via magical portals or items (like Narnia); an imaginary society hidden within our earth (like the Wizarding World); a fictional Earth set in the remote past (like Middle-earth) or future (like Dying Earth); an alternative version of our History (like Lyra&#x27;s world); or an entirely independent world set in another part of the universe (like the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Galaxy).

Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, sociology, mythology, and folklore.

==Plot function==
The setting of a fantasy work is often of great importance to the plot and characters of the story. The setting itself can be imperiled by the evil of the story, suffer a calamity, and be restored by the transformation the story brings about. Stories that use the setting as merely a backdrop for the story have been criticized for their failure to use it fully.

Even when the land itself is not in danger, it is often used symbolically, for thematic purposes, and to underscore moods. For readers, fantasy worlds offer a &quot;place...[where] assumptions and desires [about the genre] are confirmed&quot; and emotional satisfaction that comes from various elements of the world fulfill readers&#x27; expectations for quality.

==History==
Early fantasy worlds appeared as fantasy &quot;lands&quot;, part of the same planet but separated by geographical barriers. For example, Oz, though a fantasy world in every way, is described as part of this world.

Although medieval peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that, for example, an ogre could live a day&#x27;s travel away, distant continents were necessary from the Renaissance onwards for such fantastic speculation to be plausible, until finally, further exploration rendered all such terrestrial fantasy lands implausible.

Even within the span of mere decades, Oz, which had been situated in a desert in the United States when first written about in 1900, was relocated to a spot in the Pacific Ocean.

An early example of the fantasy land/world concept can be seen in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (&quot;Arabian Nights&quot;), where places of which little was known, but where the occurrence of marvels was thus more credible, had to be set &quot;long ago&quot; or &quot;far away&quot;. This is a process that continues and finally culminates in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. A more recent example of a fantasy land with definite connections to the actual world is Austin Tappan Wright&#x27;s Islandia. Islandia&#x27;s remoteness and aura of mystery, as well as its preservation of an arcadian society, are explained by means of a law that allows only limited contact with foreigners.

Dream frames were also once common for encasing the fantasy world with an explanation of its marvels. Such a dream frame was added to the story of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; for the movie version; in the book, Oz is clearly defined as an actual place. H.P. Lovecraft made active use of the dream frame, creating elaborate geographies accessible to humans only when they were asleep and dreaming. These dream settings have been criticized, and are far less frequent today.

This change is part of a general trend toward more self-consistent and substantive fantasy worlds. This has also altered the nature of the plots; earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significance, and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures, and later works more often feature characters in a social web, where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril.

==Common elements==

The most common fantasy world is one based on medieval Europe, and has been since William Morris used it in his early fantasy works, such as &quot;The Well at the World&#x27;s End&quot;, and particularly since the 1954 publication of J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Such a world is often called &quot;pseudo-medieval&quot;—particularly when the writer has snatched up random elements from the era, which covered a thousand years and a continent, and thrown them together without consideration for their compatibility, or even introduced ideas not so much based on the medieval era as on romanticized views of it. When these worlds are copied not so much from history as from other fantasy works, there is a heavy tendency to uniformity and lack of realism. The full width and breadth of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be uncompromisingly feudal-based, or evil empires or oligarchies, usually corrupt, while there was far more variety of rule in the actual Middle Ages. Fantasy worlds also tend to be economically medieval, and disproportionately pastoral.

Careful world-building plus meticulous attention to detail is often cited as the reason why certain fantasy works are deeply convincing and contain a magical sense of place. Heavy and faithful use of real-world setting for inspiration, as in Barry Hughart&#x27;s &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;, clearly derived from China, or Lloyd Alexander&#x27;s use of real-world cultures such as Welsh for &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; or Indian for &quot;The Iron Ring&quot;, make the line between fantasy worlds and alternate histories fuzzy. The use of cultural elements, and still more history and geography, from actual settings, pushes a work toward alternative history.

Conversely, the creation by an author of an imaginary country—such as Ruritania or Graustark—does not automatically transform that imaginary country into a fantasy world, even if the location would be impossible in reality owing to a lack of land to contain it; but such Ruritanian romances may be pushed toward the category of fantasy worlds by the introduction of figures such as witches and wise women, where it is not clear if their magic is effectual.

According to Lin Carter in &quot;Imaginary Worlds: The Art of Fantasy&quot;, fantasy worlds, by their nature, contain some element of magic. This element may be the creatures in it (dragons, unicorns, genies and so on) or the magical abilities of the people inhabiting the world. These are often drawn from mythology and folklore, frequently that of the historical country also used for inspiration.

==Constructed worlds==

Fantasy worlds created through a process called world building are known as a constructed world. Constructed worlds elaborate and make self-consistent the setting of fantasy work. World building often relies on materials and concepts taken from the real world.

Despite the use of magic or other fantastic elements such as dragons, the world is normally presented as one that would function normally, one in which people could actually live, making economic, historical, and ecological sense. It is considered a flaw to have, for example, pirates living in lands far from trade routes, or to assign prices for a night&#x27;s stay in an inn that would equate to several years’ income.

Furthermore, the fantastic elements should ideally operate according to self-consistent rules of their own; for example, if wizards&#x27; spells sap their strength, a wizard who does not appear to suffer this must either be putting up a facade or have an alternative explanation. This distinguishes fantasy worlds from Surrealism and even from such dream worlds as are found in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;.

===Examples===
*L. Frank Baum created the Land of Oz for his novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; and its original sequels. He was one of the few authors before Tolkien to use consistent internal geographies and histories to enrich his world.
*C. S. Lewis, author of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, set that series&#x27; novels mostly in a magical land called Narnia. Lewis was a colleague of Tolkien, and their fictional worlds share several key elements.
*Terry Pratchett created Discworld, a large disc resting on the backs of four huge elephants, which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle, as it slowly swims through space.
*J. R. R. Tolkien created Middle-earth, a famous fantasy world. He introduced several revolutionary concepts to fantasy fiction and popularized the idea of intricately detailed fantasy worlds. He wrote at some length about the process, which he called &quot;sub-creation&quot;. Middle-earth is intended to be Earth&#x27;s Old World in a fictional ancient era.
*George R. R. Martin created a fictional world for his novel series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were deliberately not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were unilluminated about distant places. Most of the story is set in the western continent of Westeros, though some are set in the Eastern continent Essos. The Southern continent of Sothoryos is also shown on maps, with a possible fourth continent, Ulthos, to its East. A map of the world is shown in the title sequence of the HBO TV adaptation, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.
*Robert Jordan created unnamed fictional world for his opus magnum &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;.
Due to the fuzzy boundary between fantasy and science fiction, it is sometimes difficult to make a hard-and-fast distinction between &quot;fantasy worlds&quot; and planets in science fiction. For example, the worlds of Barsoom, Darkover, Gor, and the Witch World combine elements of both genres and fantasy worlds may have nonexistent, powerful technology.

==Fairytale and comic fantasy==
Fairytale fantasy may ignore the normal world-building in order to present a world operating by the same logic as the fairytales from which they are derived, though other works in this subgenre develop their worlds fully. Comic fantasy may ignore all possible logic in search of humor, particularly if it is parodying other fantasies&#x27; faulty world-building, as in Diana Wynne Jones&#x27;s &quot;Dark Lord of Derkholm&quot;, or the illogic of the setting is integral to the comedy, as in L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Stone&quot;, where the fantasy world is populated by the heroic and glamorous figures that people daydream about being, resulting in a severe shortage of workers in the more mundane, day-to-day industries. Most other subgenres of fantasy suffer if the world-building is neglected.

== Retreat of magic ==
Rather than creating their own fantasy world, many authors choose to set their novels in Earth&#x27;s past. In order to explain the absence of miraculous elements, authors may introduce &quot;a retreat of magic&quot; (sometimes called &quot;thinning&quot;) that explains why the magic and other fantastic elements no longer appear: For example, in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the destruction of the One Ring defeated Sauron, but also destroyed the power of the Three Rings of the elves, resulting in them sailing to the West at the end of the story. A contemporary fantasy necessarily takes place in what purports to be the real world, and not a fantasy world. It may, however, include references to such a retreat. J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; explains that wizards eventually decided to conceal all magical creatures and artifacts from non-magic users.

==Role-playing games==
&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, the first major role-playing game, has created several detailed and commercially successful fantasy worlds (called &quot;campaign settings&quot;), with established characters, locations, histories, and sociologies. The Forgotten Realms is perhaps the most extensively developed of these worlds.

<text>A fictional country is a country that is made up for fictional stories, and does not exist in real life, or one that people believe in without proof. 
Sailors have always mistaken low clouds for land masses, and in later times this was given the name Dutch capes.
Other fictional lands appear most commonly as settings or subjects of myth, literature, film, or video games. They may also be used for technical reasons in actual reality for use in the development of specifications, such as the fictional country of &quot;Bookland&quot;, which is used to allow European Article Number &quot;country&quot; codes 978 and 979 to be used for ISBNs assigned to books, and code 977 to be assigned for use for ISSN numbers on magazines and other periodicals. Also, the ISO 3166 country code &quot;ZZ&quot; is reserved as a fictional country code.

Fictional countries appear commonly in stories of early science fiction (or scientific romance). Such countries supposedly form part of the normal Earth landscape, although not located in a normal atlas. Later similar tales often took place on fictional planets.

In &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift, the protagonist, Lemuel Gulliver, visited various strange places. Edgar Rice Burroughs placed the adventures of Tarzan in areas in Africa that, at the time, remained mostly unknown to the West and to the East. Isolated islands with strange creatures and/or customs enjoyed great popularity in these authors&#x27; times. By the 19th century, when Western explorers had surveyed most of the Earth&#x27;s surface, this option was lost to Western culture. Thereafter, fictional utopian and dystopian societies tended to spring up on other planets or in space, whether in human colonies or in alien societies originating elsewhere. Fictional countries can also be used in stories set in a distant future, with other political borders than today.

Superhero and secret agent comics and some thrillers also use fictional countries on Earth as backdrops. Most of these countries exist only for a single story, a TV-series episode or an issue of a comic book. There are notable exceptions where fictional countries appear as recurring plot elements, such as: Qumar and Equatorial Kundu (&quot;The West Wing&quot;); Latveria (Marvel Comics); and Qurac and Bialya (DC Comics).

==Purposes==
Fictional countries often deliberately resemble or even represent some real-world country or present a utopia or dystopia for commentary. Variants of the country&#x27;s name sometimes make it clear what country they really have in mind. By using a fictional country instead of a real one, authors can exercise greater freedom in creating characters, events, and settings, while at the same time presenting a vaguely familiar locale that readers can recognize. A fictional country leaves the author unburdened by the restraints of a real nation&#x27;s actual history, politics, and culture, and can thus allow for greater scope in plot construction and be exempt from criticism for vilifying an actual nation, political party, or people. The fictional Tomania (a parody of Nazi Germany named after ptomaine) serves as a setting for Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; and skewers a régime infamous for religious bigotry, militarism, racism, diplomatic bullying, and violations of civil liberties.

Fictional countries are also invented for the purpose of military training scenarios, e.g. the group of islands around Hawaii were assigned the names Blueland and Orangeland in the international maritime exercise, RIMPAC 98.

==In survey research==
Fictional countries have been created for polling purposes. When polled in April 2004, 8% of British people believed that the [fictional] country of Luvania would soon join the European Union. In the 1989 General Social Survey, U.S. respondents were asked to rate the social status of people of &quot;Wisian&quot; background, a fictional national heritage. While a majority of respondents said they could not place the Wisians in the U.S. social hierarchy, those who did ranked their status as quite low, giving an average of 4.12 on a 9-point scale, where 9 was the highest social standing. &quot;Once you let the Wisians in, the neighborhood goes to pot&quot;, quipped &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

==Legendary countries==
Countries from stories, myths, legends, that some believe to exist, or to have existed at some point:
* Atlantis
* Aztlán
* El Dorado
* Lemuria (continent) 
* Lyonesse
* Mu (continent) 
* Shangri-La or Shambhala

<doc id="175719" wikidata="Q424378" url="?curid=175719" title="Suxamethonium chloride">
<text>Suxamethonium chloride (brand names Scoline and Sucostrin, among others), also known as suxamethonium or succinylcholine, or simply sux in medical abbreviation, is a medication used to cause short-term paralysis as part of general anesthesia. This is done to help with tracheal intubation or electroconvulsive therapy. It is administered by injection, either into a vein or into a muscle. When used in a vein, onset of action is generally within one minute and effects last for up to 10 minutes.
Common side effects include low blood pressure, increased saliva production, muscle pain, and rash. Serious side effects include malignant hyperthermia, hyperkalemia and allergic reactions. It is not recommended in people who are at risk of high blood potassium or a history of myopathy. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe for the baby.

Suxamethonium is in the neuromuscular blocker family of medications and is of the depolarizing type. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on skeletal muscles. 

Suxamethonium was described as early as 1906 and came into medical use in 1951. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Suxamethonium is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
Succinylcholine chloride injection is indicated, in addition to general anesthesia, to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation.

Its medical uses are limited to short-term muscle relaxation in anesthesia and intensive care, usually for facilitation of endotracheal intubation. It is popular in emergency medicine due to its rapid onset and brief duration of action. The former is a major point of consideration in the context of trauma care, where endotracheal intubation may need to be completed very quickly. The latter means that, should attempts at endotracheal intubation fail and the person cannot be ventilated, there is a prospect for neuromuscular recovery and the onset of spontaneous breathing before low blood oxygen levels occurs. It may be better than rocuronium in people without contraindications due to its faster onset of action and shorter duration of action.

Suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy, favoured for its short duration of action.

Suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes. When plasma levels of butyrylcholinesterase are greatly diminished or an atypical form is present (an otherwise harmless inherited disorder), paralysis may last much longer, as is the case in liver failure or in neonates.

The vials are usually stored at a temperature between 2–8 °C, but issues have been reported with lower storage temperatures. The multi-dose vials are stable for up to 14 days at room temperature without significant loss of potency. Unless otherwise indicated in the prescribing information, room temperature for storage of medications is .

==Side effects==
Side effects include malignant hyperthermia, muscle pains, acute rhabdomyolysis with high blood levels of potassium, transient ocular hypertension, constipation and changes in cardiac rhythm, including slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. In people with neuromuscular disease or burns, an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles, potentially resulting in cardiac arrest. Conditions having susceptibility to suxamethonium-induced high blood potassium are burns, closed head injury, acidosis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, cerebral stroke, drowning, severe intra-abdominal sepsis, massive trauma, myopathy, and tetanus.

Suxamethonium does not produce unconsciousness or anesthesia, and its effects may cause considerable psychological distress while simultaneously making it impossible for a patient to communicate. Therefore, administration of the drug to a conscious patient is contraindicated.

===Hyperkalemia===
The side effect of high blood potassium may occur because the acetylcholine receptor is propped open, allowing continued flow of potassium ions into the extracellular fluid. A typical increase of potassium ion serum concentration on administration of suxamethonium is 0.5 mmol per liter.The increase is transient in otherwise healthy patients. The normal range of potassium is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. High blood potassium does not generally result in adverse effects below a concentration of 6.5 to 7 mEq per liter. Therefore, the increase in serum potassium level is usually not catastrophic in otherwise healthy patients. Severely high blood levels of potassium can cause changes in cardiac electrophysiology, which, if severe, can result in arrhythmias and even cardiac arrest.

===Malignant hyperthermia===

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) from suxamethonium administration can result in a drastic and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism. This overwhelms the body&#x27;s capacity to supply oxygen, remove carbon dioxide, and regulate body temperature, eventually leading to circulatory collapse and death if not treated quickly.

Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia is often inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, for which there are at least six genetic loci of interest, the most prominent being the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1). MH susceptibility is phenotype and genetically related to central core disease (CCD), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized both by MH symptoms and by myopathy. MH is usually unmasked by anesthesia, or when a family member develops the symptoms. There is no simple, straightforward test to diagnose the condition. When MH develops during a procedure, treatment with dantrolene sodium is usually initiated; dantrolene and the avoidance of suxamethonium administration in susceptible people have markedly reduced the mortality from this condition.

===Apnea===
The normal short duration of action of suxamethonium is due to the rapid metabolism of the drug by non-specific plasma cholinesterases. However, plasma cholinesterase activity is reduced in some people due to either genetic variation or acquired conditions, which results in a prolonged duration of neuromuscular block. Genetically, ninety six percent of the population have a normal (Eu:Eu) genotype and block duration; however, some people have atypical genes (Ea, Es, Ef) which can be found in varying combinations with the Eu gene, or other atypical genes (see Pseudocholinesterase deficiency). Such genes will result in a longer duration of action of the drug, ranging from 20 minutes up to several hours. Acquired factors that affect plasma cholinesterase activity include pregnancy, liver disease, kidney failure, heart failure, thyrotoxicosis, and cancer, as well as a number of other drugs.

If unrecognized by a clinician it could lead to awareness if anesthesia is discontinued whilst still paralyzed or hypoxemia (and potentially fatal consequences) if artificial ventilation is not maintained. Normal treatment is to maintain sedation and ventilate the patient on an intensive care unit until muscle function has returned. Blood testing for cholinesterase function can be performed.

Mivacurium, a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug, is also metabolized via the same route with a similar clinical effect in patients deficient in plasma cholinesterase activity.

Deliberate induction of conscious apnea using this drug led to its use as a form of aversion therapy in the 1960s and 1970s in some prison and institutional settings. This use was discontinued after negative publicity concerning the terrifying effects on subjects of this treatment and ethical questions about the punitive use of painful aversion.

==Mechanism of action==
There are two phases to the blocking effect of suxamethonium.

===Phase 1 block===
Phase 1 blocking has the principal paralytic effect. Binding of suxamethonium to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor results in opening of the receptor&#x27;s ion channel; a depolarization of the motor end-plate occurs and calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum leading to initial muscle contration and fasciculations.

In normal skeletal muscle, acetylcholine dissociates from the receptor following depolarization and is rapidly hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase. The muscle cell is then ready for the next signal.

Suxamethonium is not hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase. By remaining bound to the acetylcholine receptor and maintaining the membrane potential above threshold, it does not allow the muscle cell to completely repolarize. This results in the inability for the voltage gated sodium channels to reset and instead are held in an inactive state leading to an inability to form further action potentials.

Voltage gated calcium channels likely close as the partially depolarised membrane potential remains between -30mV and -60mV, which is below the opening of the voltage gated calcium channel, approximately -10mV. Subsequently calcium is removed from the muscle cell cytoplasm . As the calcium is taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle relaxes resulting in muscle flaccidity.

The results are membrane depolarization and transient fasciculations, followed by flaccid paralysis.

===Phase 2 block===
While this phase is not abnormal and is a part of its mechanism of action, it is undesirable during surgery, due to the inability to depolarize the cell again. Often, patients must be on a ventilator for hours if Phase 2 block occurs. It generally occurs when suxamethonium is administered multiple times, or during an infusion occurring over too much time, but can also occur during an initial bolus if the plasma cholinesterase is abnormal Desensitization may occur at the nerve terminal causing the myocyte to become less sensitive to acetylcholine, resulting in the membrane repolarizing and being unable be depolarized again for a period of time.

==Chemistry==
Suxamethonium is an odorless, white crystalline substance. Aqueous solutions have a pH of about 4. The dihydrate melts at 160 °C, whereas the anhydrous melts at 190 °C. It is highly soluble in water (1 gram in about 1 mL), soluble in ethyl alcohol (1 gram in about 350 mL), slightly soluble in chloroform, and practically insoluble in ether. Suxamethonium is a hygroscopic compound. The compound consists of two acetylcholine molecules that are linked by their acetyl groups. It can also be viewed as a central moiety of succinic acid with two choline moieties, one on each end.

==History==
Suxamethonium was first discovered in 1906 by Reid Hunt and René de M. Taveau. When studying the drug, animals were given curare and thus they missed the neuromuscular blocking properties of suxamethonium. Instead in 1949 an Italian group led by Daniel Bovet was first to describe succinylcholine induced paralysis. The clinical introduction of suxamethonium was described in 1951 by several groups. Papers published by Stephen Thesleff and Otto von Dardel in Sweden are important but also to be mentioned is work by Bruck, Mayrhofer and Hassfurther in Austria, Scurr and Bourne in UK, and Foldes in America.

==Abuse==

Dubai authorities declared that the assassination of Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh, a Hamas operative, was carried out on their soil by Mossad agents with the use of suxamethonium chloride injection. Entering Dubai under false passports in 2010, the Mossad agents found al-Mabhouh at a hotel, immobilized him with the drug, electrocuted him, and suffocated him with a pillow. A high concentration of suxamethonium chloride was found in al-Mabhouh&#x27;s body post-mortem. The incident triggered significant diplomatic crises in the Middle East, Europe, and Australia.

==Brand names==
It is available in German-speaking countries under the trade name Lysthenon among others.

==Use in animals==
It is sometimes used in combination with pain medications and sedatives for euthanasia and immobilization of horses.

<text>A boiler is a closed vessel in which fluid (generally water) is heated. The fluid does not necessarily boil. The heated or vaporized fluid exits the boiler for use in various processes or heating applications, including water heating, central heating, boiler-based power generation, cooking, and sanitation.

==Heat sources==
In a fossil fuel power plant using a steam cycle for power generation, the primary heat source will be combustion of coal, oil, or natural gas. In some cases byproduct fuel such as the carbon monoxide rich offgasses of a coke battery can be burned to heat a boiler; biofuels such as bagasse, where economically available, can also be used. In a nuclear power plant, boilers called steam generators are heated by the heat produced by nuclear fission. Where a large volume of hot gas is available from some process, a heat recovery steam generator or recovery boiler can use the heat to produce steam, with little or no extra fuel consumed; such a configuration is common in a combined cycle power plant where a gas turbine and a steam boiler are used. In all cases the combustion product waste gases are separate from the working fluid of the steam cycle, making these systems examples of external combustion engines.

==Materials==
The pressure vessel of a boiler is usually made of steel (or alloy steel), or historically of wrought iron. Stainless steel, especially of the austenitic types, is not used in wetted parts of boilers due to corrosion and stress corrosion cracking. However, ferritic stainless steel is often used in superheater sections that will not be exposed to boiling water, and electrically-heated stainless steel shell boilers are allowed under the European &quot;Pressure Equipment Directive&quot; for production of steam for sterilizers and disinfectors.

In live steam models, copper or brass is often used because it is more easily fabricated in smaller size boilers. Historically, copper was often used for fireboxes (particularly for steam locomotives), because of its better formability and higher thermal conductivity; however, in more recent times, the high price of copper often makes this an uneconomic choice and cheaper substitutes (such as steel) are used instead.

For much of the Victorian &quot;age of steam&quot;, the only material used for boilermaking was the highest grade of wrought iron, with assembly by riveting. This iron was often obtained from specialist ironworks, such as those in the Cleator Moor (UK) area, noted for the high quality of their rolled plate, which was especially suitable for use in critical applications such as high-pressure boilers. In the 20th century, design practice moved towards the use of steel, with welded construction, which is stronger and cheaper, and can be fabricated more quickly and with less labour. Wrought iron boilers corrode far more slowly than their modern-day steel counterparts, and are less susceptible to localized pitting and stress-corrosion. That makes the longevity of older wrought-iron boilers far superior to that of welded steel boilers.

Cast iron may be used for the heating vessel of domestic water heaters. Although such heaters are usually termed &quot;boilers&quot; in some countries, their purpose is usually to produce hot water, not steam, and so they run at low pressure and try to avoid boiling. The brittleness of cast iron makes it impractical for high-pressure steam boilers.

==Energy==
The source of heat for a boiler is combustion of any of several fuels, such as wood, coal, oil, or natural gas. Electric steam boilers use resistance- or immersion-type heating elements. Nuclear fission is also used as a heat source for generating steam, either directly (BWR) or, in most cases, in specialised heat exchangers called &quot;steam generators&quot; (PWR). Heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) use the heat rejected from other processes such as gas turbine.

==Boiler efficiency==
There are two methods to measure the boiler efficiency in the ASME performance test code (PTC) for boilers ASME PTC 4 and for HRSG ASME PTC 4.4 and EN 12952-15 for water tube boilers:
# Input-output method (direct method)
# Heat-loss method (indirect method)

===Input-output method (or, direct method)===
Direct method of boiler efficiency test is more usable or more common.

: Boiler efficiency = power out / power in = Q × (Hg − Hf) / (q × GCV) × 100%

where
: Q, rate of steam flow in kg/h
: Hg, enthalpy of saturated steam in kcal/kg
: Hf, enthalpy of feed water in kcal/kg
: q, rate of fuel use in kg/h
: GCV, gross calorific value in kcal/kg (e.g., pet coke 8200kcal/kg)

===Heat-loss method (or, indirect method)===
To measure the boiler efficiency in indirect method, parameter like these are needed:
* Ultimate analysis of fuel (H2, S2, S, C, moisture constraint, ash constraint)
* Percentage of O2 or CO2 at flue gas
* Flue gas temperature at outlet
* Ambient temperature in °C and humidity of air in kg/kg
* GCV of fuel in kcal/kg
* Ash percentage in combustible fuel
* GCV of ash in kcal/kg

==Configurations==

Boilers can be classified into the following configurations:
; &quot;Pot boiler&quot; or &quot;Haycock boiler&quot;/Haystack boiler: A primitive &quot;kettle&quot; where a fire heats a partially filled water container from below. 18th century Haycock boilers generally produced and stored large volumes of very low-pressure steam, often hardly above that of the atmosphere. These could burn wood or most often, coal. Efficiency was very low.
; Flued boiler: With one or two large flues—an early type or forerunner of fire-tube boiler.
; Fire-tube boiler: Here, water partially fills a boiler barrel with a small volume left above to accommodate the steam (&quot;steam space&quot;). This is the type of boiler used in nearly all steam locomotives. The heat source is inside a furnace or &quot;firebox&quot; that has to be kept permanently surrounded by the water in order to maintain the temperature of the &quot;heating surface&quot; below the boiling point. The furnace can be situated at one end of a fire-tube which lengthens the path of the hot gases, thus augmenting the heating surface which can be further increased by making the gases reverse direction through a second parallel tube or a bundle of multiple tubes (two-pass or return flue boiler); alternatively, the gases may be taken along the sides and then beneath the boiler through flues (3-pass boiler). In case of a locomotive-type boiler, a boiler barrel extends from the firebox and the hot gases pass through a bundle of fire tubes inside the barrel which greatly increases the heating surface compared to a single tube and further improves heat transfer. Fire-tube boilers usually have a comparatively low rate of steam production, but high steam storage capacity. Fire-tube boilers mostly burn solid fuels, but are readily adaptable to those of the liquid or gas variety. Fire-tube boilers may also be referred to as &quot;scotch-marine&quot; or &quot;marine&quot; type boilers.
; Water-tube boiler: In this type, tubes filled with water are arranged inside a furnace in a number of possible configurations. Often the water tubes connect large drums, the lower ones containing water and the upper ones steam and water; in other cases, such as a mono-tube boiler, water is circulated by a pump through a succession of coils. This type generally gives high steam production rates, but less storage capacity than the above. Water tube boilers can be designed to exploit any heat source and are generally preferred in high-pressure applications since the high-pressure water/steam is contained within small diameter pipes which can withstand the pressure with a thinner wall. These boilers are commonly constructed in place, roughly square in shape, and can be multiple stories tall.
; Flash boiler: A flash boiler is a specialized type of water-tube boiler in which tubes are close together and water is pumped through them. A flash boiler differs from the type of mono-tube steam generator in which the tube is permanently filled with water. In a flash boiler, the tube is kept so hot that the water feed is quickly flashed into steam and superheated. Flash boilers had some use in automobiles in the 19th century and this use continued into the early 20th century.

; Fire-tube boiler with water-tube firebox: Sometimes the two above types have been combined in the following manner: the firebox contains an assembly of water tubes, called thermic siphons. The gases then pass through a conventional firetube boiler. Water-tube fireboxes were installed in many Hungarian locomotives, but have met with little success in other countries.
; Sectional boiler: In a cast iron sectional boiler, sometimes called a &quot;pork chop boiler&quot; the water is contained inside cast iron sections. These sections are assembled on site to create the finished boiler.

==Safety==

To define and secure boilers safely, some professional specialized organizations such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) develop standards and regulation codes. For instance, the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code is a standard providing a wide range of rules and directives to ensure compliance of the boilers and other pressure vessels with safety, security and design standards.

Historically, boilers were a source of many serious injuries and property destruction due to poorly understood engineering principles. Thin and brittle metal shells can rupture, while poorly welded or riveted seams could open up, leading to a violent eruption of the pressurized steam. When water is converted to steam it expands to over 1,000 times its original volume and travels down steam pipes at over . Because of this, steam is an efficient method of moving energy and heat around a site from a central boiler house to where it is needed, but without the right boiler feedwater treatment, a steam-raising plant will suffer from scale formation and corrosion. At best, this increases energy costs and can lead to poor quality steam, reduced efficiency, shorter plant life and unreliable operation. At worst, it can lead to catastrophic failure and loss of life. Collapsed or dislodged boiler tubes can also spray scalding-hot steam and smoke out of the air intake and firing chute, injuring the firemen who load the coal into the fire chamber. Extremely large boilers providing hundreds of horsepower to operate factories can potentially demolish entire buildings.

A boiler that has a loss of feed water and is permitted to boil dry can be extremely dangerous. If feed water is then sent into the empty boiler, the small cascade of incoming water instantly boils on contact with the superheated metal shell and leads to a violent explosion that cannot be controlled even by safety steam valves. Draining of the boiler can also happen if a leak occurs in the steam supply lines that is larger than the make-up water supply could replace. The &quot;Hartford Loop&quot; was invented in 1919 by the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company as a method to help prevent this condition from occurring, and thereby reduce their insurance claims.

==Superheated steam boiler==
When water is boiled the result is saturated steam, also referred to as &quot;wet steam.&quot; Saturated steam, while mostly consisting of water vapor, carries some unevaporated water in the form of droplets. Saturated steam is useful for many purposes, such as cooking, heating and sanitation, but is not desirable when steam is expected to convey energy to machinery, such as a ship&#x27;s propulsion system or the &quot;motion&quot; of a steam locomotive. This is because unavoidable temperature and/or pressure loss that occurs as steam travels from the boiler to the machinery will cause some condensation, resulting in liquid water being carried into the machinery. The water entrained in the steam may damage turbine blades or in the case of a reciprocating steam engine, may cause serious mechanical damage due to hydrostatic lock.

Superheated steam boilers evaporate the water and then further heat the steam in a &quot;superheater&quot;, causing the discharged steam temperature to be substantially above the boiling temperature at the boiler&#x27;s operating pressure. As the resulting &quot;dry steam&quot; is much hotter than needed to stay in the vaporous state it will not contain any significant unevaporated water. Also, higher steam pressure will be possible than with saturated steam, enabling the steam to carry more energy. Although superheating adds more energy to the steam in the form of heat there is no effect on pressure, which is determined by the rate at which steam is drawn from the boiler and the pressure settings of the safety valves. The fuel consumption required to generate superheated steam is greater than that required to generate an equivalent volume of saturated steam. However, the overall energy efficiency of the steam plant (the combination of boiler, superheater, piping and machinery) generally will be improved enough to more than offset the increased fuel consumption.

Superheater operation is similar to that of the coils on an air conditioning unit, although for a different purpose. The steam piping is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace, an area in which the temperature is typically between . Some superheaters are radiant type, which as the name suggests, they absorb heat by radiation. Others are convection type, absorbing heat from a fluid. Some are a combination of the two types. Through either method, the extreme heat in the flue gas path will also heat the superheater steam piping and the steam within.

The design of any superheated steam plant presents several engineering challenges due to the high working temperatures and pressures. One consideration is the introduction of feedwater to the boiler. The pump used to charge the boiler must be able to overcome the boiler&#x27;s operating pressure, else water will not flow. As a superheated boiler is usually operated at high pressure, the corresponding feedwater pressure must be even higher, demanding a more robust pump design.

Another consideration is safety. High pressure, superheated steam can be extremely dangerous if it unintentionally escapes. To give the reader some perspective, the steam plants used in many U.S. Navy destroyers built during World War II operated at pressure and superheat. In the event of a major rupture of the system, an ever-present hazard in a warship during combat, the enormous energy release of escaping superheated steam, expanding to more than 1600 times its confined volume, would be equivalent to a cataclysmic explosion, whose effects would be exacerbated by the steam release occurring in a confined space, such as a ship&#x27;s engine room. Also, small leaks that are not visible at the point of leakage could be lethal if an individual were to step into the escaping steam&#x27;s path. Hence designers endeavor to give the steam-handling components of the system as much strength as possible to maintain integrity. Special methods of coupling steam pipes together are used to prevent leaks, with very high pressure systems employing welded joints to avoided leakage problems with threaded or gasketed connections.

===Supercritical steam generator===
Supercritical steam generators are frequently used for the production of electric power. They operate at supercritical pressure. In contrast to a &quot;subcritical boiler&quot;, a supercritical steam generator operates at such a high pressure (over ) that the physical turbulence that characterizes boiling ceases to occur; the fluid is neither liquid nor gas but a super-critical fluid. There is no generation of steam bubbles within the water, because the pressure is above the critical pressure point at which steam bubbles can form. As the fluid expands through the turbine stages, its thermodynamic state drops below the critical point as it does work turning the turbine which turns the electrical generator from which power is ultimately extracted. The fluid at that point may be a mix of steam and liquid droplets as it passes into the condenser. This results in slightly less fuel use and therefore less greenhouse gas production. The term &quot;boiler&quot; should not be used for a supercritical pressure steam generator, as no &quot;boiling&quot; occurs in this device.

==Accessories==

===Boiler fittings and accessories===
* Pressuretrols to control the steam pressure in the boiler. Boilers generally have 2 or 3 pressuretrols: a manual-reset pressuretrol, which functions as a safety by setting the upper limit of steam pressure, the operating pressuretrol, which controls when the boiler fires to maintain pressure, and for boilers equipped with a modulating burner, a modulating pressuretrol which controls the amount of fire.
* Safety valve: It is used to relieve pressure and prevent possible explosion of a boiler.
* Water level indicators: They show the operator the level of fluid in the boiler, also known as a sight glass, water gauge or water column.
* Bottom blowdown valves: They provide a means for removing solid particulates that condense and lie on the bottom of a boiler. As the name implies, this valve is usually located directly on the bottom of the boiler, and is occasionally opened to use the pressure in the boiler to push these particulates out.
* Continuous blowdown valve: This allows a small quantity of water to escape continuously. Its purpose is to prevent the water in the boiler becoming saturated with dissolved salts. Saturation would lead to foaming and cause water droplets to be carried over with the steam – a condition known as priming. Blowdown is also often used to monitor the chemistry of the boiler water.
* Trycock: a type of valve that is often used to manually check a liquid level in a tank. Most commonly found on a water boiler.
* Flash tank: High-pressure blowdown enters this vessel where the steam can &#x27;flash&#x27; safely and be used in a low-pressure system or be vented to atmosphere while the ambient pressure blowdown flows to drain.
* Automatic blowdown/continuous heat recovery system: This system allows the boiler to blowdown only when makeup water is flowing to the boiler, thereby transferring the maximum amount of heat possible from the blowdown to the makeup water. No flash tank is generally needed as the blowdown discharged is close to the temperature of the makeup water.
* Hand holes: They are steel plates installed in openings in &quot;header&quot; to allow for inspections &amp; installation of tubes and inspection of internal surfaces.
* Steam drum internals, a series of screen, scrubber &amp; cans (cyclone separators).
* Low-water cutoff: It is a mechanical means (usually a float switch) or an electrode with a safety switch that is used to turn off the burner or shut off fuel to the boiler to prevent it from running once the water goes below a certain point. If a boiler is &quot;dry-fired&quot; (burned without water in it) it can cause rupture or catastrophic failure.
* Surface blowdown line: It provides a means for removing foam or other lightweight non-condensible substances that tend to float on top of the water inside the boiler.
* Circulating pump: It is designed to circulate water back to the boiler after it has expelled some of its heat.
* Feedwater check valve or clack valve: A non-return stop valve in the feedwater line. This may be fitted to the side of the boiler, just below the water level, or to the top of the boiler.
* Top feed: In this design for feedwater injection, the water is fed to the top of the boiler. This can reduce boiler fatigue caused by thermal stress. By spraying the feedwater over a series of trays the water is quickly heated and this can reduce limescale.
* Desuperheater tubes or bundles: A series of tubes or bundles of tubes in the water drum or the steam drum designed to cool superheated steam, in order to supply auxiliary equipment that does not need, or may be damaged by, dry steam.
* Chemical injection line: A connection to add chemicals for controlling feedwater pH.

===Steam accessories===
* Main steam stop valve:
* Steam traps:
* Main steam stop/check valve: It is used on multiple boiler installations.

===Combustion accessories===
* Fuel oil system:fuel oil heaters
* Gas system:
* Coal system:

===Other essential items===
* Pressure gauges:
* Feed pumps:
* Fusible plug:
* Insulation and lagging;
* Inspectors test pressure gauge attachment:
* Name plate:
* Registration plate:

== Draught ==
A fuel-heated boiler must provide air to oxidize its fuel. Early boilers provided this stream of air, or &quot;draught&quot;, through the natural action of convection in a chimney connected to the exhaust of the combustion chamber. Since the heated flue gas is less dense than the ambient air surrounding the boiler, the flue gas rises in the chimney, pulling denser, fresh air into the combustion chamber.

Most modern boilers depend on mechanical draught rather than natural draught. This is because natural draught is subject to outside air conditions and temperature of flue gases leaving the furnace, as well as the chimney height. All these factors make proper draught hard to attain and therefore make mechanical draught equipment much more reliable and economical.

Types of draught can also be divided into &quot;induced draught&quot;, where exhaust gases are pulled out of the boiler; &quot;forced draught&quot;, where fresh air is pushed into the boiler; and &quot;balanced draught&quot;, where both effects are employed. Natural draught through the use of a chimney is a type of induced draught; mechanical draught can be induced, forced or balanced.

There are two types of mechanical induced draught. The first is through use of a steam jet. The steam jet oriented in the direction of flue gas flow induces flue gases into the stack and allows for a greater flue gas velocity increasing the overall draught in the furnace. This method was common on steam driven locomotives which could not have tall chimneys. The second method is by simply using an induced draught fan (ID fan) which removes flue gases from the furnace and forces the exhaust gas up the stack. Almost all induced draught furnaces operate with a slightly negative pressure.

Mechanical forced draught is provided by means of a fan forcing air into the combustion chamber. Air is often passed through an air heater; which, as the name suggests, heats the air going into the furnace in order to increase the overall efficiency of the boiler. Dampers are used to control the quantity of air admitted to the furnace. Forced draught furnaces usually have a positive pressure.

Balanced draught is obtained through use of both induced and forced draught. This is more common with larger boilers where the flue gases have to travel a long distance through many boiler passes. The induced draught fan works in conjunction with the forced draught fan allowing the furnace pressure to be maintained slightly below atmospheric.

<text>Children&#x27;s fantasy is children&#x27;s literature with fantasy elements: fantasy intended for young readers. It may also mean fantasy read &quot;by&quot; children, regardless of the intended audience.

The genre has roots in folk tales such as &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; that were not originally intended for children: before the Victorian era, fairytales were perceived as immoral and ill-suited for children&#x27;s minds. A market for children&#x27;s fantasy was established in Britain in the 19th century, leading to works such as Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and Edith Nesbit&#x27;s &quot;Five Children&quot; series; the genre also developed in America, exemplified by L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. Of the authors of this period, Nesbit is commonly cited as the creator of modern children&#x27;s fantasy. 

The golden age of children&#x27;s fantasy, in scholars&#x27; view, occurred in the mid-20th century when the genre was influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. In the vein of &quot;Narnia&quot;, the post-war period saw rising stakes and manifestations of evil in the works of Susan Cooper and Alan Garner. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth led to mythopoeic fantasy in the 1970s, from authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Robin McKinley. Another influential writer of this period was Diana Wynne Jones, who wrote both medievalist and realist fantasies. 

In the late 1990s, J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; led to a commercial boom in the genre, reviving older authors&#x27; careers and spawning many imitators. A concurrent success is Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, a darker, realistic fantasy that led to a corresponding trend in a new young adult market. 

== Children&#x27;s fantasy books and series ==

The protagonists are usually children or teens who have unique abilities, gifts, possessions or even allies that allow them to face powerful adversaries. Harry Potter is a powerful young wizard, one of the children of &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; series is an immature Old One with magical abilities, and in the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; series the children have magical items and animal allies. The plot frequently incorporates a &quot;bildungsroman&quot;. 

In the earlier part of the 20th century, C. S. Lewis noted that fantasy was more accepted in juvenile literature, and therefore a writer interested in fantasy often wrote in it to find an audience.

<text>Paraplegia is an impairment in motor or sensory function of the lower extremities. The word comes from Ionic Greek ()
&quot;half-stricken&quot;. It is usually caused by spinal cord injury or a congenital condition that affects the neural (brain) elements of the spinal canal. The area of the spinal canal that is affected in paraplegia is either the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral regions. If four limbs are affected by paralysis, tetraplegia or quadriplegia is the correct term. If only one limb is affected, the correct term is monoplegia. Spastic paraplegia is a form of paraplegia defined by spasticity of the affected muscles, rather than flaccid paralysis.

<text>The United States abortion-rights movement (also known as the pro-choice movement) is a sociopolitical movement in the United States supporting the view that a woman should have the legal right to an elective abortion, meaning the right to terminate her pregnancy, and is part of a broader global abortion-rights movement. The movement consists of a variety of organizations, with no single centralized decision-making body.

A key point in abortion rights in the United States was the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1973 decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which struck down most state laws restricting abortion, thereby decriminalizing and legalizing elective abortion in a number of states. On June 24, 2022, &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was overruled in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization.&quot;

On the other side of the abortion debate in the United States is the anti-abortion movement (self-described as a “pro-life” movement), which holds the belief that human embryos and fetuses have a right to life, and abortion violates this right and should be outlawed or otherwise restricted. Within this group, many argue that human personhood begins at conception, a position rejected by many abortion rights groups.

== Overview ==
Abortion-rights advocates argue that whether or not a pregnant woman continues with a pregnancy should be her personal choice, as it involves her body, personal health, and future. They also argue that more availability of legal abortions reduces the exposure of women to the risks associated with illegal abortions. More broadly, abortion-rights advocates frame their arguments in terms of individual liberty, reproductive freedom, and reproductive rights. The first of these terms was widely used to describe many of the political movements of the 19th and 20th centuries (such as in the abolition of slavery in Europe and the United States, and in the spread of popular democracy) whereas the latter terms derive from changing perspectives on sexual freedoms and bodily integrity.

Abortion-rights supporters rarely consider themselves &quot;pro-abortion&quot; because they consider termination of a pregnancy as a bodily autonomy issue, and find forced abortion to be as legally and morally indefensible as the outlawing of abortion. Indeed, some who support abortion rights consider themselves opposed to some or all abortions on a moral basis, but believe that abortions would happen in any case such that legal abortion under medically controlled conditions is preferable to illegal back-alley abortion without proper medical supervision. Such people believe the death rate of women due to such procedures in areas where abortions are only available outside of the medical establishment is unacceptable.

Some who argue from a philosophical viewpoint believe that an embryo has no rights as it is only a potential, not actual, person and that it should not have rights that override those of the pregnant woman at least until it is viable.

Many abortion-rights campaigners also note that some anti-abortion activists also oppose practices that correlate with less demand for abortion, namely sex education and the ready availability of contraception. Proponents of this argument point to cases of areas with limited sex education and contraceptive access that have high abortion rates, either legal or illegal. Some women also travel to another jurisdiction or country where they may obtain an abortion. For example, a large number of Irish women would visit the United Kingdom for abortions. For instance, Belgian women who travelled to France before Belgium legalized abortion. Similarly, women would travel to the Netherlands when it became legal to have abortions there in the 1970s.

The majority of Americans, despite what side of politics they are on, believe that abortion should be legal circumstantially. Some people who support abortion rights see abortion as a last resort and focus on situations where they feel abortion is a necessary option. Among these situations are those where the woman was raped, her health or life (or that of the fetus) is at risk, contraception was used but failed, the fetus has acute congenital disorder and defects, incest, financial constraints, or she feels unable to raise a child. One common reason women give for terminating unintended pregnancies is that having a baby would prevent them from achieving goals, such as pursuing an education. Some abortion-rights moderates, who would otherwise be willing to accept certain restrictions on abortion, feel that political pragmatism compels them to oppose any such restrictions, as they could be used to form a slippery slope against all abortions. On the other hand, even some abortion rights advocates feel uncomfortable with the use of abortion for sex-selection, as is practiced in some countries, such as India.

==History==


Prior to 1973, abortion rights in the United States were not seen as a constitutional issue. Abortion was seen as a purely state matter, all of which had some type of restrictions. The first legal restrictions on abortion appeared in the 1820s, forbidding abortion after the fourth month of pregnancy. A number of early feminists expressed skepticism about outlawing abortion. They disliked abortion but thought anti-abortion laws did not apply &quot;the proper remedies&quot;, according to one nineteenth-century women&#x27;s rights pioneer. By 1900, legislators at the urgings of the American Medical Association (AMA) had enacted laws banning abortion in most U.S. states. The AMA played a vital role in stigmatizing abortions by using their status and power to create a moral stance against abortion. The AMA viewed abortion providers as unwanted healthcare competitors. Due to the high maternal morbidity and mortality rates caused by back alley abortions, physicians, nurses, and social workers pushed for legalization of abortion from a pro-public health perspective. Support for abortion rights went beyond feminists and medical professions. The broad support for legalizing abortion in the 1960s also derived from certain religious leaders. For example, there were 1,400 clergy operating on the East Coast for the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion—an underground network that connected women seeking abortions to doctors—during the 1960s. As the historian Christine Stansell explained, many religious leaders came to approach the abortion rights argument from a position of individual conscience instead of from dogma by witnessing the &quot;strains unwanted pregnancies put on members of their congregations&quot;.

In its landmark 1973 case &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, in which a woman challenged the Texas laws criminalizing abortion, the U.S. Supreme Court reached two important conclusions:

* That state abortion laws are subject to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and
* That the procurement of an abortion was a constitutional right during the first and second trimesters of a pregnancy based on the constitutional &quot;right to privacy&quot;, but that the state&#x27;s interest in protecting &quot;potential life&quot; prevailed in the third trimester unless the woman&#x27;s health was at risk. In subsequent rulings, the Court rejected the trimester framework altogether in favor of a cutoff at the point of fetal viability (cf. &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;).
The outcome of Roe V. Wade divided Americans over the issue of abortion and the laws surrounding it. The issue became highly politicized as the Democratic and Republican parties took more polarized positions on abortion policy. The Democratic party advocated for abortion rights, while the Republican party supported the anti-abortion side.

In the 2010s, the Abortion-rights movement faced setbacks as more anti-abortion policies were beginning to be passed across various state legislatures. In 2015, the successes of the anti-abortion movement generated more anti-abortion policies in various states. During the first quarter of 2015, 322 provisions were introduced in multiple state legislatures. These new provisions included implementing existing laws like Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers laws (TRAP) that require abortion providers to meet the standards of an ambulatory surgical, prohibit state fund use on abortions, mandate counseling before an abortion, require waiting periods, parental involvement for minors, and restriction of abortion coverage in private insurance. Since 2000, the number of states that enacted more restrictive abortion abortion has grown from 13 to 27 in 2013. The anti-abortion movement assisted in electing governors and policymakers that are more favorable towards their viewpoint. The election of these officials helped solidify party control of anti-abortion Republicans in both houses of state legislatures. In 2015, 31 of the 50 governors in the U.S. and two-thirds of the state legislatures they controlled held strong favorability towards anti-abortion policy. The majority of these anti-abortion states were concentrated in the southern and midwestern regions of the United States.

The outcome of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization case in 2022 led to trigger laws being enacted and the formation of new laws that involve anti-abortion policy. More than 470 abortion restriction policies were passed compared to 70 abortion protective policies that were passed across various state legislatures after the Dobbs case. Restrictive state abortion policy varied across the country, but a majority of laws heavily restricting or banning abortion were enacted in the southern and midwestern regions of the United States. Indiana was the first state in the country to ban abortion at zero weeks. States that have implemented new laws present new legal challenges for patients and clinicians.

Abortion-rights groups are active in all American states and at the federal level, campaigning for legal abortion and against the reimposition of anti-abortion laws, with varying degrees of success. Only a few states allow abortion without limitation or regulation, but most do allow various limited forms of abortion.

In the wake of extreme abortion restrictions in states like Georgia, Alabama, Missouri and Ohio, transgender, intersex and other gender-nonconforming people felt forgotten in this movement.

Abortion is one of the most common medical interventions undergone by women aged 15–44. In the US, childbirth carries a risk of death about 14 times higher than abortion.

The Democratic Party&#x27;s platform endorses the abortion-rights position, stating that abortion should be &quot;safe and legal&quot;. Not all Democrats agree with the platform, however, and there is a small anti-abortion faction within the party, expressed in such groups as Democrats for Life of America. Similarly, there is a small abortion-rights faction within the Republican Party. The Libertarian Party platform holds &quot;that government should be kept out of the matter&quot; of abortion.

== &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; ==
&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was an essential court case in the U.S. abortion rights movement. The case was first tried in June 1970 by a Texas district court. The court ruled that Texas&#x27; law for abortions was unconstitutional and was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. This particular law made it a crime to have an abortion unless the mother&#x27;s life would be in danger if she had the child. This issue was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court when a woman in Texas by the name of Norma McCorvey wanted to get an abortion. In the case, she was given the pseudonym &quot;Jane Roe&quot;, and Henry Wade was the district attorney of Dallas County who the case was against. A lawsuit was filed on behalf of McCorvey by her lawyers, Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington, claiming that particular articles for the Texas penal code, 1191-1194 and 1196, were unconstitutional. The lawyers&#x27; stance was that these articles took away a women&#x27;s right to choose which went against the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s Ninth Amendment.

On January 22, 1973, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of Jane Roe and banned the law in Texas that only allowed abortions if the mother&#x27;s life was at stake. This was a monumental decision impacting the entire country, legalizing abortions nationwide. The court&#x27;s decision was decided and based on the three different trimesters in pregnancy. The ruling allowed for women to have the choice to have an abortion in the first trimester, without any government regulation. Once a woman enters the second trimester, the government would be allowed to regulate any abortions. The government&#x27;s interference at this stage does not mean that abortions are banned, but that they have the power to decide if a woman should be able to get an abortion if her health is at stake. Once a woman enters the third trimester, the state has the authority to approve or deny a woman having an abortion. This decision by the state is based on whether the fetus can survive outside the womb. If it can, then the state will not approve of the abortion unless the mother&#x27;s life and/or health is at stake.

&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; has had a major impact on the United States abortion rights movement. Before this Supreme Court case, some women had to resort to having unsafe and illegal abortions that could cost them their health or lives. This case allowed women to have more of a choice in deciding to have an abortion or not. Since its ruling, states have been creating laws that make it difficult for women to have the choice to get an abortion.

==Organizations and individuals==

The abortion rights movement includes a variety of organizations, with no single centralized decision-making body. Many more individuals who are not members of these organizations also support their views and arguments.

Planned Parenthood, Reproductive Freedom for All, the National Abortion Federation, the National Organization for Women, and the American Civil Liberties Union are the leading abortion-rights advocacy and lobbying groups in the United States. Most major feminist organizations also support abortion-rights positions, as do the American Medical Association, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and pro-abortion rights physicians such as Eugene Gu and Warren Hern who have fought political opposition from anti-abortion Senator Marsha Blackburn.
Faith-based groups that advocate for abortion rights include notably the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice and Catholics for Choice.

=== Planned Parenthood===
Planned Parenthood was founded on October 16, 1916, in Brownsville, New York City, New York. This organization was created so that women could have access to healthcare services and information that could help them live strong and healthy lives. Planned Parenthood is important to the United States abortion rights movement because their members are advocates for abortion access, as they believe that it is a healthcare right. Some of the issues surrounding abortion that this organization are advocating against include bans on abortion at 20 weeks, bans on abortions at 6 weeks, and the Hyde Amendment.

On July 1, 1976, the &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Danforth&quot; case was taken to the United States Supreme Court. The Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri, Dr. David Hall, and Dr. Michael Freiman challenged a Missouri law for abortion, known as House Bill 1211. Bill 1211 regulated that women who were married had to receive consent from their husband for an abortion, or consent from the parents if they were a minor and not married. Attorney Frank Susman represented Planned Parenthood in the case. Hall, Freiman, Susman, and Planned Parenthood argued against House Bill 1211 and its definition of viability. They argued that it gave a vague definition of viability that allowed for any fetus to be considered viable, essentially making abortions illegal. It was also argued that the passage of House Bill 1211 was targeting specifically individuals who wanted an abortion by requiring consent from the husband or parents for abortions, but not for other medical procedures.  Frank Susman also challenged the ban on saline amniocentesis, a procedure to induce abortions, and the regulation of doctors who performed abortions. This regulation required that the doctor care for the fetus as if it were delivered normally to save its life. John Danforth, who was the general attorney for Missouri in the case, argued that the Missouri law, House Bill 1211, was constitutional. His views were that the consent allowed for the women to properly understand and make a cautious decision about the abortion.

The Court came to a decision and kept some parts of House Bill 1211, while omitting others. The definition of fetal viability and the recordkeeping requirements were upheld. The Court decided to omit the requirement of written consent for the procedure, the requirement of doctors to care for the fetus after the abortion as if it was a conventional delivery, and the ban of saline amniocentesis.

Other than Planned Parenthood&#x27;s advocacy efforts for the abortion rights movement, their members also provide information at their clinics and website for the public. Regarding abortions, they provide information for people who may be considering abortions, information on the abortion pill, where to find abortion clinics and what to expect when experiencing abortions.

=== NARAL Pro-Choice America ===
The NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation advocates for access to abortion, birth control, and paid parental leave, and against discrimination toward pregnant women. Their members provide education about the adverse effects of policies that go against a woman&#x27;s choice, advocate for the group&#x27;s policies, and advocate voting for government officials who support those policies. Another sector of this organization, NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC, focuses on endorsing political candidates who are pro-choice and willing to defend the right to abortion.

The NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation advocates against targeted regulation of abortion providers (TRAP) laws, legislative restriction on access to abortions, and abortion refusal laws. They also have been a part of successful campaigns that included support for the EACH Woman Act and &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot;. The EACH Woman Act is legislation that was created to eliminate the Hyde amendment. This amendment prohibits women on government health care programs, such as Medicaid, from receiving funds to pay for an abortion. In support of the EACH Woman act, the NARAL Pro-Choice Foundation gathered petition signatures. In the Supreme Court case &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot; the NARAL Pro-Choice Foundation advocated for this case. This particular case was taken to court because restrictions in Texas made it difficult for women to have access to abortions. The Court ruled that this was unconstitutional.

=== The National Abortion Federation ===
The National Abortion Federation supports providers who perform abortions with delivering patient care. Their members advocate for women to have a choice when it comes to having an abortion, ensuring quality abortion care, and providing a platform where providers and patients can share their personal experiences regarding abortions.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Abortion Federation advocated for abortion clinics to remain open, deeming it an essential service. The National Abortion Federation also provides a Hotline that helps patients have access to abortions and financial assistance. They provide a Patient Partnership program that allows people who have had abortions to share their personal experiences and stories to lawmakers.

=== Religious organizations in support of the abortion rights movement ===

==== Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice ====
The Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice (RCRC) is a national nonprofit organization that was founded in 1973 shortly following the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; ruling. Founders of the Coalition included clergy and lay leaders from many mainstream religions. Many of these leaders had previously helped women find abortion services before the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling.

The organization&#x27;s website provides several resources to people in need. Four specific issues of interest are listed and delved into: the moral case, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and reproductive justice. Beyond this, the organization offers religious resources and services to those who are considering or recovering from an abortion, as well as clinics and practitioners. Some services that are offered include clinic blessings, workshops, &quot;Compassion School&quot;, and advocacy. Several states have a state-level coalition with varying amounts of resources:
*Colorado has a website dedicated to RCRC called Colorado Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. Apart from having similar resources as the parent website, the Colorado RCRC website offers &quot;all options counseling&quot; with a promise to help all pregnant women who are seeking advice
*Kentucky has a website dedicated to RCRC called Kentucky Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. Here, the organization shares important updates on the EMW Clinic, the state&#x27;s only remaining abortion clinic. KRCRC is one of many organizations that continuously advocates to keep the clinic&#x27;s doors open. Volunteers from the organization also provide escorting to people who are utilizing the clinic&#x27;s services.
*Minnesota does not have an independent for RCRC, but there is a Facebook group dedicated to the cause. It is titled &quot;Minnesota Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice&quot; and focuses on many of the same issues that the parent RCRC organization highlights.
*New Mexico has a website specifically dedicated to its state RCRC. In addition to the resources offered by the parent website, New Mexico also offers letters of support from clergy members and an abortion fund to assist those who cannot afford the procedure. NMRCRC also lists volunteer opportunities such as being a legal observer or a patient host and/or driver. 
*Ohio&#x27;s independent RCRC website is called Ohio Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. The organization focuses on the same general goals as its parent organization as well as bringing local issues to light. Ohio RCRC highlights issues such as sidewalk harassment (people against abortion lobbying outside of abortion clinics) and provides resources such as abortion care packages and patient advocates.
*The Pennsylvania RCRC website includes a list of clergy members from all across the state who support the organization. It also provides a link to the parent website and several songs and prayers for reproductive justice. 
*Wisconsin&#x27;s RCRC does not have a website, but its supporters have organized a Facebook group titled &quot;Wisconsin Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice&quot;. Here, members share articles that highlight issues that are of interest to the organization.
*California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, and Oklahoma also have coalitions, but these states do not have websites or Facebook groups dedicated to their state coalitions.

==== Catholics for Choice ====
Catholics for Choice is a nonprofit that supports reproductive freedom, including abortion rights. The organization asserts that abortion is a matter that should be decided by the individual&#x27;s own conscience. Members of the organization push for abortion services to be available to everyone so people have the ability to make that choice. The organization also asserts that the majority of U.S. Catholics view abortion as a social justice value, not a religious value.

==== Reform Judaism ====

Reform Judaism openly advocates for the right to safe and accessible abortion and contraception.

==== Unitarian Universalism ====
The Unitarian Universalist Church strongly supports abortion rights. In 1978, the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution that declared, &quot;...[the] right to choice on contraception and abortion are important aspects of the right of privacy, respect for human life, and freedom of conscience of women and their families&quot;. The Association had released earlier statements in 1963 and 1968 favoring the reform of restrictive abortion laws.

<text>A local anesthetic (LA) is a medication that causes absence of all sensation (including pain) in a specific body part without loss of consciousness, providing local anesthesia, as opposed to a general anesthetic, which eliminates all sensation in the entire body and causes unconsciousness. Local anesthetics are most commonly used to eliminate pain during or after surgery. When it is used on specific nerve pathways (local anesthetic nerve block), paralysis (loss of muscle function) also can be induced.

==Classification==
LAs are of 2 types:
*Clinical LAs:
**amino amide LAs 
**amino ester LAs
*Synthetic LAs
**Cocaine derivatives

Synthetic cocaine-derived LAs differ from cocaine because they have a much lower abuse potential and do not cause hypertension vasoconstriction (with few exceptions).

The suffix &quot;-caine&quot; at the ends of these medication names is derived from the word &quot;cocaine&quot;, because cocaine was formerly used as a local anesthetic.

== Examples ==
Short Duration of Action and Low Potency

*Benzocaine
*Procaine
*Chloroprocaine
*Cocaine

Medium Duration of Action and Medium Potency

*Lidocaine
*Prilocaine

High Duration and High Potency

*Tetracaine
*Bupivacaine
*Cinchocaine
*Ropivacaine

== Medical uses ==
Local anesthetics may be used to prevent and/or treat acute pain, to treat chronic pain, and as a supplement to general anesthesia.

They are used in various techniques of local anesthesia such as:
* Topical anesthesia (surface anesthesia)
* Topical administration of cream, gel, ointment, liquid, or spray of anesthetic dissolved in DMSO or other solvents/carriers for deeper absorption
* Infiltration
* Brachial plexus block
* Epidural block (extradural)
* Spinal anesthesia (subarachnoid block)
* Iontophoresis
* Diagnostic purposes (e.g. dibucaine)
*Anti-arrhythmic agents (e.g. lidocaine).

===Acute pain===
Even though acute pain can be managed using analgesics, conduction anesthesia may be preferable because of superior pain control and fewer side effects. For purposes of pain therapy, LA drugs are often given by repeated injection or continuous infusion through a catheter. LA drugs are also often combined with other agents such as opioids for synergistic analgesic action. Low doses of LA drugs can be sufficient so that muscle weakness does not occur and patients may be mobilized.

Some typical uses of conduction anesthesia for acute pain are:
===Chronic pain===

Chronic pain is a complex and often serious condition that requires diagnosis and treatment by an expert in pain medicine. LAs can be applied repeatedly or continuously for prolonged periods to relieve chronic pain, usually in combination with medication such as opioids, NSAIDs, and anticonvulsants. Though it can be easily performed, repeated local anesthetic blocks in chronic pain conditions are not recommended as there is no evidence of long-term benefits.

=== Surgery ===
Virtually every part of the body can be anesthetized using conduction anesthesia. However, only a limited number of techniques are in common clinical use. Sometimes, conduction anesthesia is combined with general anesthesia or sedation for the patient&#x27;s comfort and ease of surgery. However, many anesthetists, surgeons, patients and nurses believe that it is safer to perform major surgeries under local anesthesia than general anesthesia. Typical operations performed under conduction anesthesia include:
=== Diagnostic tests ===
Diagnostic tests such as bone marrow aspiration, lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and aspiration of cysts or other structures are made to be less painful upon administration of local anesthetic before insertion of larger needles.

=== Other uses ===
Local anesthesia is also used during insertion of IV devices, such as pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, ports used for giving chemotherapy medications and hemodialysis access catheters.

Topical anesthesia, in the form of lidocaine/prilocaine (EMLA) is most commonly used to enable relatively painless venipuncture (blood collection) and placement of intravenous cannulae. It may also be suitable for other kinds of punctures such as ascites drainage and amniocentesis.

Surface anesthesia also facilitates some endoscopic procedures such as bronchoscopy (visualization of the lower airways) or cystoscopy (visualization of the inner surface of the bladder)

== Side effects ==

===Localized side effects===
Edema of tongue, pharynx and larynx may develop as a side effect of local anesthesia. This could be caused by a variety of reasons including trauma during injection, infection, an allergic reaction, haematoma or injection of irritating solutions such as cold-sterilization solutions. Usually there is tissue swelling at the point of injection. This is due to puncturing of the vein which allows the blood to flow into loose tissues in the surrounding area. Blanching of the tissues in the area where the local anesthetic is deposited is also common. This gives the area a white appearance as the blood flow is prevented due to vasoconstriction of arteries in the area. The vasoconstriction stimulus gradually wears off and subsequently the tissue returns to normal in less than two hours.

The side effects of inferior alveolar nerve block include feeling tense, clenching of the fists and moaning.

The duration of soft tissue anesthesia is longer than pulpal anesthesia and is often associated with difficulty eating, drinking and speaking.

====Risks====
The risk of temporary or permanent nerve damage varies between different locations and types of nerve blocks.

There is risk of accidental damage to local blood vessels during injection of the local anesthetic solution. This is referred to as haematoma and could result in pain, trismus, swelling and/or discolouration of the region. The density of tissues surrounding the injured vessels is an important factor for haematoma. There is greatest chance of this occurring in a posterior superior alveolar nerve block or in a pterygomandibular block.

Giving local anesthesia to patients with liver disease can have significant consequences. Thorough evaluation of the disease should be carried out to assess potential risk to the patient as in significant liver dysfunction, the half-life of amide local anesthetic agents may be drastically increased thus increasing the risk of overdose.

Local anesthetics and vasoconstrictors may be administered to pregnant patients however it is very important to be extra cautious when giving a pregnant patient any type of drug. Lidocaine can be safely used but bupivacaine and mepivacaine should be avoided.  Consultation with the obstetrician is vital before administering any type of local anesthetic to a pregnant patient.

====Recovery====
Permanent nerve damage after a peripheral nerve block is rare. Symptoms are likely to resolve within a few weeks. The vast majority of those affected (92–97%) recover within four to six weeks; 99% of these people have recovered within a year. An estimated one in 5,000 to 30,000 nerve blocks results in some degree of permanent persistent nerve damage.

Symptoms may continue to improve for up to 18 months following injury.

===Potential side effects===

General systemic adverse effects are due to the pharmacological effects of the anesthetic agents used. The conduction of electric impulses follows a similar mechanism in peripheral nerves, the central nervous system, and the heart. The effects of local anesthetics are, therefore, not specific for the signal conduction in peripheral nerves. Side effects on the central nervous system and the heart may be severe and potentially fatal. However, toxicity usually occurs only at plasma levels which are rarely reached if proper anesthetic techniques are adhered to. High plasma levels might arise, for example, when doses intended for epidural or intrasupport tissue administration are accidentally delivered as intravascular injection.

==== Emotional reactions ====
When patients are emotionally affected in the form of nervousness or fear, it can lead to vasovagal collapse. This is the anticipation of pain during administration that activates the parasympathetic nervous system while inhibiting the orthosympathetic nervous system. What results is a dilation of arteries in muscles which can lead to a reduction in circulating blood volume inducing a temporary shortness of blood flow to the brain. Notable symptoms include restlessness, visibly looking pale, perspiration and possible loss of consciousness. In severe cases, clonic cramps resembling an epileptic insult may occur.

On the other hand, fear of administration can also result in accelerated, shallow breathing, or hyperventilation. The patient may feel a tingling sensation in hands and feet or a sense of light-headedness and increased chest pressure.

Hence, it is crucial for the medical professional administrating the local anesthesia, especially in the form of an injection, to ensure that the patient is in a comfortable setting and has any potential fears alleviated in order to avoid these possible complications.

==== Central nervous system ====

Depending on local tissue concentrations of local anesthetics, excitatory or depressant effects on the central nervous system may occur.

Initial symptoms of systemic toxicity include ringing in the ears (tinnitus), a metallic taste in the mouth, tingling or numbness of the mouth, dizziness and/or disorientation.

At higher concentrations, a relatively selective depression of inhibitory neurons results in cerebral excitation, which may lead to more advanced symptoms include motor twitching in the periphery followed by grand mal seizures. It is reported that seizures are more likely to occur when bupivacaine is used, particularly in combination with chloroprocaine.

A profound depression of brain functions may occur at even higher concentrations which may lead to coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Such tissue concentrations may be due to very high plasma levels after intravenous injection of a large dose.

Another possibility is direct exposure of the central nervous system through the cerebrospinal fluid, i.e., overdose in spinal anesthesia or accidental injection into the subarachnoid space in epidural anesthesia.

==== Cardiovascular system ====

Cardiac toxicity can result from improper injection of agent into a vessel. Even with proper administration, it is inevitable for some diffusion of agent into the body from the site of application due to unforeseeable anatomical idiosyncrasies of the patient. This may affect the nervous system or cause the agent to enter into general circulation. However, infections are very seldom transmitted.

Cardiac toxicity associated with overdose of intravascular injection of local anesthetic is characterized by hypotension, atrioventricular conduction delay, idioventricular rhythms, and eventual cardiovascular collapse. Although all local anesthetics potentially shorten the myocardial refractory period, bupivacaine blocks the cardiac sodium channels, thereby making it most likely to precipitate malignant arrhythmias. Even levobupivacaine and ropivacaine (single-enantiomer derivatives), developed to ameliorate cardiovascular side effects, still harbor the potential to disrupt cardiac function. Toxicity from anesthetic combinations is additive.

==== Endocrine ====
Endocrine and metabolic systems only have slightly adverse effects with most cases being without clinical repercussions.

==== Immunologic allergy ====

Adverse reactions to local anesthetics (especially the esters) are not uncommon, but legitimate allergies are very rare. Allergic reactions to the esters is usually due to a sensitivity to their metabolite, para-aminobenzoic acid, and does not result in cross-allergy to amides. Therefore, amides can be used as alternatives in those patients. Nonallergic reactions may resemble allergy in their manifestations. In some cases, skin tests and provocative challenge may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of allergy. Also cases of allergy to paraben derivatives occur, which are often added as preservatives to local anesthetic solutions.

==== Methemoglobinemia ====

Methemoglobinemia is a process where iron in hemoglobin is altered, reducing its oxygen-carrying capability, which produces cyanosis and symptoms of hypoxia. Exposure to aniline group chemicals such as benzocaine, lidocaine, and prilocaine can produce this effect, especially benzocaine. The systemic toxicity of prilocaine is comparatively low, but its metabolite, o-toluidine, is known to cause methemoglobinemia.

==== Second-generation effects ====
Application of local anesthetics during oocyte removal during in vitro fertilization has been up to debate. Pharmacological concentrations of anesthetic agents have been found in follicular fluid. Clinical trials have not concluded any effects on pregnant women. However, there is some concern with the behavioral effects of lidocaine on offspring in rats.

During pregnancy, it is not common for local anesthetics to have any adverse effect on the fetus. Despite this, risks of toxicity may be higher in pregnancy due to an increase in unbound fraction of local anesthetic and physiological changes increase the transfer of local anesthetic into the central nervous system. Hence, it is recommended that pregnant women use a lower dose of local anesthetic to reduce any potential complications.

====Treatment of overdose: &quot;Lipid rescue&quot;====

Lipid emulsion therapy or lipid rescue is a method of toxicity treatment was invented by Dr. Guy Weinberg in 1998, and was not widely used until after the first published successful rescue in 2006. Evidence indicates Intralipid, a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion, can be effective in treating severe cardiotoxicity secondary to local anesthetic overdose, including human case reports. However, the evidence at this point is still limited.

Though most case reports to date have recorded most common use of Intralipid, other emulsions, such as Liposyn and Medialipid, have also been shown effective.

Ample supporting animal evidence and human case reports show successful use of lipid rescue in this way. In the UK, efforts have been made to publicize lipid rescue more widely. In 2010, lipid rescue had been officially promoted as a treatment of local anesthetic toxicity by the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland. One published case has been reported of successful treatment of refractory cardiac arrest in bupropion and lamotrigine overdose using lipid emulsion.

The design of a &#x27;homemade&#x27; lipid rescue kit has been described.

Although lipid rescue mechanism of action is not completely understood, the added lipid in the blood stream may act as a sink, allowing for the removal of lipophilic toxins from affected tissues. This theory is compatible with two studies on lipid rescue for clomipramine toxicity in rabbits and with a clinical report on the use of lipid rescue in veterinary medicine to treat a puppy with moxidectin toxicosis.

== Mechanism of action ==
All LAs are membrane-stabilizing drugs; they reversibly decrease the rate of depolarization and repolarization of excitable membranes (like nociceptors). Though many other drugs also have membrane-stabilizing properties, not all are used as LAs (propranolol, for example, though it has LA properties).
LA drugs act mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through sodium-specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane, in particular the so-called voltage-gated sodium channels. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is inhibited. The receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Local anesthetic drugs bind more readily to sodium channels in an activated state, thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster in rapidly firing neurons. This is referred to as state-dependent blockade.

LAs are weak bases and are usually formulated as the hydrochloride salt to render them water-soluble. At a pH equal to the protonated base&#x27;s pKa, the protonated (ionized) and unprotonated (unionized) forms of the molecule exist in equimolar amounts, but only the unprotonated base diffuses readily across cell membranes. Once inside the cell, the local anesthetic will be in equilibrium, with the formation of the protonated (ionized) form, which does not readily pass back out of the cell. This is referred to as &quot;ion-trapping&quot;. In the protonated form, the molecule binds to the LA binding site on the inside of the ion channel near the cytoplasmic end. Most LAs work on the internal surface of the membrane - the drug has to penetrate the cell membrane, which is achieved best in the nonionised form. This is exemplified by the permanently ionised LA RAC 421-II which cannot diffuse across the cell membrane but, if injected into the cytosol of a nerve fibre, can induce NaKATPase blockage and anesthetic effects.

Acidosis such as caused by inflammation at a wound partly reduces the action of LAs. This is partly because most of the anesthetic is ionized and therefore unable to cross the cell membrane to reach its cytoplasmic-facing site of action on the sodium channel.

===Sensitivity of nerve fibers to local anesthetics===
For most patients, administration of local anesthetics causes the sensation of pain to be lost first, followed by temperature, touch, deep pressure, and finally motor function. The sensitivity of nerve fibers to blockade depends on a combination of diameter and myelination. Their different sensitivities to LA blockade is termed differential blockade. Myelinated fibers are more sensitive to blockade as they are interrupted by nodes of Ranvier, thus interruption of only consecutive nodes of Ranvier will prevent action potential propagation. In turn, in unmyelinated nerves, an entire length needs to be blocked. Regarding diameter, the generally accepted principle is that susceptibility to local anesthesia depends inversely on fiber diameter.

In general, autonomic fibers Type B fibers, small unmyelinated type C (pain sensation), and small myelinated Aδ fibers(pain and temperature sensations) are blocked before the larger myelinated Aγ, Aβ, and Aα fibers (mediating postural, touch, pressure, and motor information).

== Techniques ==
Local anesthetics can block almost every nerve between the peripheral nerve endings and the central nervous system. The most peripheral technique is topical anesthesia to the skin or other body surface. Small and large peripheral nerves can be anesthetized individually (peripheral nerve block) or in anatomic nerve bundles (plexus anesthesia). Spinal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia merge into the central nervous system.

Injection of LAs is often painful. A number of methods can be used to decrease this pain, including buffering of the solution with bicarbonate and warming.

Clinical techniques include:
* Surface anesthesia is the application of an LA spray, solution, or cream to the skin or a mucous membrane; the effect is short lasting and is limited to the area of contact.
* Infiltration anesthesia is infiltration of LA into the tissue to be anesthetized; surface and infiltration anesthesia are collectively topical anesthesia
* Field block is subcutaneous injection of an LA in an area bordering on the field to be anesthetized.
* Peripheral nerve block is injection of LA in the vicinity of a peripheral nerve to anesthetize that nerve&#x27;s area of innervation.
* Plexus anesthesia is injection of LA in the vicinity of a nerve plexus, often inside a tissue compartment that limits the diffusion of the drug away from the intended site of action. The anesthetic effect extends to the innervation areas of several or all nerves stemming from the plexus.
* Epidural anesthesia is an LA injected into the epidural space, where it acts primarily on the spinal nerve roots; depending on the site of injection and the volume injected, the anesthetized area varies from limited areas of the abdomen or chest to large regions of the body.
* Spinal anesthesia is an LA injected into the cerebrospinal fluid, usually at the lumbar spine (in the lower back), where it acts on spinal nerve roots and part of the spinal cord; the resulting anesthesia usually extends from the legs to the abdomen or chest.
* Intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier&#x27;s block) is when blood circulation of a limb is interrupted using a tourniquet (a device similar to a blood-pressure cuff), then a large volume of LA is injected into a peripheral vein. The drug fills the limb&#x27;s venous system and diffuses into tissues, where peripheral nerves and nerve endings are anesthetized. The anesthetic effect is limited to the area that is excluded from blood circulation and resolves quickly once circulation is restored.
* Local anesthesia of body cavities includes intrapleural anesthesia and intra-articular anesthesia.

* Transincision (or transwound) catheter anesthesia uses a multilumen catheter inserted through an incision or wound and aligned across it on the inside as the incision or wound is closed, providing continuous administration of local anesthetic along the incision or wounds

Dental-specific techniques include:

=== Vazirani–Akinosi technique ===
The Vazirani–Akinosi technique is also known as the closed-mouth mandibular nerve block. It is mostly used in patients who have limited opening of the mandible or in those that have trismus; spasm of the muscles of mastication. The nerves which are anesthetised in this technique are the inferior alveolar, incisive, mental, lingual and mylohyoid nerves.

Dental needles are available in two lengths, short and long. As Vazirani–Akinosi is a local anesthetic technique which requires penetration of a significant thickness of soft tissues, a long needle is used. The needle is inserted into the soft tissue which covers the medial border of the mandibular ramus, in region of the inferior alveolar, lingual and mylohyoid nerves. The positioning of the bevel of the needle is very important as it must be positioned away from the bone of the mandibular ramus and instead towards the midline.

=== Intraligamentary Infiltration ===
Intraligamentary infiltration, also known as periodontal ligament injection or intraligamentary injection (ILI), is known as &quot;the most universal of the supplemental injections&quot;. ILIs are usually administered when inferior alveolar nerve block techniques are inadequate or ineffective. ILIs are purposed for:

# Single-tooth anesthesia
# Low anesthetic dose
# Contraindication for systemic anesthesia
# Presence of systemic health problems

ILI utilization is expected to increase because dental patients prefer fewer soft tissue anesthesia and dentists aim to reduce administration of traditional inferior alveolar nerve block (INAB) for routine restorative procedures.

Injection methodology: The periodontal ligament space provides an accessible route to the cancellous alveolar bone, and the anesthetic reaches the pulpal nerve via natural perforation of intraoral bone tissue.

Advantages of ILI over INAB: rapid onset (within 30 seconds), small dosage required (0.2–1.0 mL), limited area of numbness, lower intrinsic risks such as neuropathy, hematoma, trismus/jaw sprain and self-inflicted periodontal tissue injury, as well as decreased cardiovascular disturbances. Its usage as a secondary or supplementary anesthesia on the mandible has reported a high success rate of above 90%.

Disadvantages: Risk of temporary periodontal tissue damage, likelihood of bacteriemia and endocarditis for at-risk populations, appropriate pressure and correct needle placement are imperative for anesthetic success, short duration of pulpal anesthesia limits the use of ILIs for several restorative procedures that require longer duration, postoperative discomfort, and injury on unerupted teeth such as enamel hypoplasia and defects.

Technique description:
* All plaque and calculus to be eradicated, optimally before the operative visit to assist gingival tissue healing.
* Before injection, disinfect gingival sulcus with 0.2% chlorhexidine solution.
* Administration of soft tissue anesthesia is recommended prior to ILI administration. This helps to enhance patient comfort.
* Needle gauges of sizes 27-gauge short or 30-gauge ultra-short needle are usually utilized.
* The needle is inserted along the long axis, at a 30 degree angle, of the mesial or distal root for single rooted teeth and on the mesial and distal roots of multi-rooted teeth. Bevel orientation toward the root provides easier advancement of the needle apically.
* When the needle reaches between the root and crestal bone, significant resistance is experience.
* Anesthetic deposition is recommended at 0.2 mL, per root or site, over minimally 20 seconds.
* For its success, the anesthetic must be administered under pressure. It must not leak out of the sulcus into the mouth.
* Withdraw needle for minimally 10–15 seconds to permit complete deposition of solution. This can be slower than other injections as there is pressure build-up from the anesthetic administration.
* Blanching of the tissue is observed and may be more evident when vasoconstrictors are used. It is caused by a temporary obstruction of blood flow to the tissue.

Syringes:
* Standard syringes can be used.
* The intraligamentary syringe offers mechanical advantage by using a trigger-grasp or click apparatus to employ a gear or lever that improves control and results in increased force to push the anesthetic cartridge&#x27;s rubber stopper forward for medication deposition with greater ease.
* C-CLADs (computer controlled local anesthetic delivery devices) can be used. Its usage of computer microprocessors allows for control of fluid dynamics and anesthetic deposition. This minimizes subjective flow rates and variability in pressure. This thereby results in enhanced hydrodynamic diffusion of solution into bone or the target area of deposition, thus permitting larger amounts of anesthetic solution to be delivered during ILIs without increased tissue damage.

Things to note:
* ILIs are not recommended for patients with active periodontal inflammation.
* ILIs should not be administered at tooth sites with 5 mm or more of periodontal attachment loss.

=== Gow-Gates Technique ===
Gow-Gates technique is used to provide anesthetics to the mandible of the patient&#x27;s mouth. With the aid of extra and intraoral landmarks, the needle is injected into the intraoral latero-anterior surface of the condyle, steering clear below the insertion of the lateral pterygoid muscle. The extraoral landmarks used for this technique are the lower border of the ear tragus, corners of the mouth and the angulation of the tragus on the side of the face.

Biophysical forces (pulsation of the maxillary artery, muscular function of jaw movement) and gravity will aid with the diffusion of anesthetic to fill the whole pterygomandibular space. All three oral sensory parts of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve and other sensory nerves in the region will come in contact with the anesthetic and this reduces the need to anesthetise supplementary innervation.

In comparison to other regional block methods of anestheising the lower jaw, the Gow-Gates technique has a higher success rate in fully anesthetising the lower jaw. One study found that out of 1,200 patients receiving injections through the Gow-Gates technique, only 2 of them did not obtain complete anesthesia.

== Types ==

Local anesthetic solutions for injection typically consist of:
* The local anesthetic agent itself
* A vehicle, which is usually water-based or just sterile water
* Vasoconstrictor possibly (see below)
* Reducing agent (antioxidant), e.g. if epinephrine is used, then sodium metabisulfite is used as a reducing agent
* Preservative, e.g. methylparaben
* Buffer

Esters are prone to producing allergic reactions, which may necessitate the use of an amide. The names of each locally clinical anesthetic have the suffix &quot;-caine&quot;.
Most ester LAs are metabolized by pseudocholinesterase, while amide LAs are metabolized in the liver. This can be a factor in choosing an agent in patients with liver failure, although since cholinesterases are produced in the liver, physiologically (e.g. very young or very old individual) or pathologically (e.g. cirrhosis) impaired hepatic metabolism is also a consideration when using esters.

Sometimes, LAs are combined, e.g.:
* Lidocaine/prilocaine (EMLA, eutectic mixture of local anesthetic)
* Lidocaine/tetracaine (Rapydan)
* TAC

LA solutions for injection are sometimes mixed with vasoconstrictors (combination drug) to increase the duration of local anesthesia by constricting the blood vessels, thereby safely concentrating the anesthetic agent for an extended duration, as well as reducing hemorrhage. Because the vasoconstrictor temporarily reduces the rate at which the systemic circulation removes the local anesthetic from the area of the injection, the maximum doses of LAs when combined with a vasoconstrictor is higher compared to the same LA without any vasoconstrictor. Occasionally, cocaine is administered for this purpose. Examples include:
* Prilocaine hydrochloride and epinephrine (trade name Citanest Forte)
* Lidocaine, bupivacaine, and epinephrine (recommended final concentrations of 0.5, 0.25, and 0.5%, respectively)
* Iontocaine, consisting of lidocaine and epinephrine
* Septocaine (trade name Septodont), a combination of articaine and epinephrine
One combination product of this type is used topically for surface anaesthesia, TAC (5–12% tetracaine,1/2000 (0.05%, 500 ppm, per mille) adrenaline, 4 or 10% cocaine).

Using LA with vasoconstrictor is safe in regions supplied by end arteries.
The commonly held belief that LA with vasoconstrictor can cause necrosis in extremities such as the nose, ears, fingers, and toes (due to constriction of end arteries), is invalidated, since no case of necrosis has been reported since the introduction of commercial lidocaine with epinephrine in 1948.

===Ester group===

* Benzocaine
* Chloroprocaine
* Cocaine
* Cyclomethycaine
* Dimethocaine (Larocaine)
* Piperocaine
* Propoxycaine
* Procaine (Novocaine)
* Proparacaine
* Tetracaine (Amethocaine)

===Amide group===

* Articaine
* Bupivacaine
* Cinchocaine (Dibucaine)
* Etidocaine
* Levobupivacaine
* Lidocaine (Lignocaine)
* Mepivacaine
* Prilocaine
* Ropivacaine
* Trimecaine

===Naturally derived===

* Saxitoxin
* Neosaxitoxin
* Tetrodotoxin
* Menthol
* Eugenol
* Cocaine
* Spilanthol

Most naturally occurring local anesthetics with the exceptions of menthol, eugenol and cocaine are neurotoxins, and have the suffix -toxin in their names. Cocaine binds the intracellular side of the channels while saxitoxin, neosaxitoxin and tetrodotoxin bind to the extracellular side of sodium channels.

== History ==

In Peru, the ancient Incas are believed to have used the leaves of the coca plant as a local anesthetic in addition to its stimulant properties. It was also used for slave payment and is thought to play a role in the subsequent destruction of Incas culture when Spaniards realized the effects of chewing the coca leaves and took advantage of it. Cocaine was first used as a local anesthetic in 1884. The search for a less toxic and less addictive substitute led to the development of the aminoester local anesthetics stovaine in 1903 and procaine in 1904. Since then, several synthetic local anesthetic drugs have been developed and put into clinical use, notably lidocaine in 1943, bupivacaine in 1957, and prilocaine in 1959.

The invention of clinical use of local anaesthesia is credited to the Vienna School which included Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), Carl Koller (1857-1944) and Leopold Konigstein (1850–1942). They introduced local anaesthesia, using cocaine, through &#x27;self-experimation&#x27; on their oral mucosa before introducing it to animal or human experimentation. The Vienna school first started using cocaine as local anaesthesia in ophthalmology and it was later incorporated into ophthalmologic practice. Dr. Halsted and Dr. Hall, in the United States in 1885 described an intraoral anesthetic technique of blocking the inferior alveolar nerve and the antero-superior dental nerve using 4% cocaine.{

Shortly after the first use of cocaine for topical anesthesia, blocks on peripheral nerves were described. Brachial plexus anesthesia by percutaneous injection through axillary and supraclavicular approaches was developed in the early 20th century. The search for the most effective and least traumatic approach for plexus anesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks continues to this day. In recent decades, continuous regional anesthesia using catheters and automatic pumps has evolved as a method of pain therapy.

Intravenous regional anesthesia was first described by August Bier in 1908. This technique is still in use and is remarkably safe when drugs of low systemic toxicity such as prilocaine are used.

Spinal anesthesia was first used in 1885, but not introduced into clinical practice until 1899, when August Bier subjected himself to a clinical experiment in which he observed the anesthetic effect, but also the typical side effect of postpunctural headache. Within a few years, spinal anesthesia became widely used for surgical anesthesia and was accepted as a safe and effective technique. Although atraumatic (noncutting-tip) cannulae and modern drugs are used today, the technique has otherwise changed very little over many decades.

Epidural anesthesia by a caudal approach had been known in the early 20th century, but a well-defined technique using lumbar injection was not developed until 1921, when Fidel Pagés published his article &quot;Anestesia Metamérica&quot;. This technique was popularized in the 1930s and 1940s by Achile Mario Dogliotti. With the advent of thin, flexible catheters, continuous infusion and repeated injections have become possible, making epidural anesthesia still a highly successful technique. Besides its many uses for surgery, epidural anesthesia is particularly popular in obstetrics for the treatment of labor pain.

<text>Zero insertion force (ZIF) is a type of IC socket or electrical connector that requires very little (but not literally zero) force for insertion. With a ZIF socket, before the IC is inserted, a lever or slider on the side of the socket is moved, pushing all the sprung contacts apart so that the IC can be inserted with very little force - generally the weight of the IC itself is sufficient and no external downward force is required. The lever is then moved back, allowing the contacts to close and grip the pins of the IC. ZIF sockets are much more expensive than standard IC sockets and also tend to take up a larger board area due to the space taken up by the lever mechanism. Typically, they are only used when there is a good reason to do so.

== Design ==

A normal integrated circuit (IC) socket requires the IC to be pushed into sprung contacts which then grip by friction. For an IC with hundreds of pins, the total insertion force can be very large (hundreds of newtons), leading to a danger of damage to the device or the circuit board. Also, even with relatively small pin counts, each pin extraction is fairly awkward and carries a significant risk of bending pins, particularly if the person performing the extraction hasn&#x27;t had much practice or if the board is crowded. Low insertion force (LIF) sockets reduce the issues of insertion and extraction, but because of its lower insertion force than a conventional socket, are likely to produce less reliable connections.

Large ZIF sockets are only commonly found mounted on PC motherboards, being used from about the mid 1990s forward. These CPU sockets are designed to support a particular range of CPUs, allowing computer retailers and consumers to assemble motherboard/CPU combinations based on individual budgets and requirements. The rest of the electronics industry has largely abandoned sockets (of any kind) and instead moved to the use of surface mount components soldered directly to the board.

Smaller ZIF sockets are commonly used in chip-testing and programming equipment, e.g., programming and testing on EEPROMs, Microcontrollers, etc.

==Universal test sockets==

Standard DIP packages come in a number of widths (measured between pin centers), with 0.3 in (7.62 mm) and 0.6 in (15.24 mm) being the most common. To allow the design of programmers and similar devices that support a range of devices universal test sockets are produced. These have wide slots into which the pins drop allowing devices of differing widths to be inserted.

==Ball grid array sockets==
ZIF sockets can be used for ball grid array chips, particularly during development. These sockets tend to be unreliable, failing to grab all the solder balls. Another type of BGA socket, also free of insertion force but not a &quot;ZIF socket&quot; in the traditional sense, does a better job by using spring pins to push up underneath the balls.

==ZIF wire-to-board connectors==

ZIF wire-to-board connectors are used for attaching wires to printed circuit boards inside electronic equipment. An example would be the cable between the LCD screen and motherboard in laptops. The wires, often formed into a ribbon cable, are pre-stripped and the bare ends are placed inside the connector. The two sliding parts of the connector are then pushed together, causing it to grip the wires. The most important advantage of this system is that it does not require a mating half to be fitted to the wire ends, therefore saving space and cost inside miniaturised equipment. See flexible flat cable.

==Hard disk drives==
ZIF tape connections are used for connecting Parallel ATA and Serial ATA disk drives (mostly drives in the 1.8-inch form factor). PATA hard drives with ZIF-style connectors were used primarily in the design of ultra-portable notebooks. They have since been phased out, as SATA has a relatively small-form-factor connector by default. Mini-SATA (mSATA) can be used where even smaller form factors are required.

Internally, nearly all hard drives use ZIF tape to connect their circuit board to their platter motor. ZIF tape connections were also heavily used in the design of the iPod range of portable media players, not just for the hard drive but also for other connections from the main circuit board. Three types of ZIF connectors are known to exist on 1.8 inch PATA drives. ZIF-24, ZIF-40, and ZIF-50 have 24, 40, and 50 pins respectively.

<text>Engis (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Liège, Belgium. 

On 1 January 2006 Engis had a total population of 5,686. The total area is 27.74 km2 which gives a population density of 205 inhabitants per km2.

As of 2022, the population is estimated at approximately 6,269.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Clermont-sous-Huy, Engis and Hermalle-sous-Huy.

In 1829, in this village, Philippe-Charles Schmerling discovered the first Neanderthal ever, Engis 2, the damaged skull of a young child. This was before the 1856 discovery of the Neanderthal type specimen in the Neander Valley. Its importance was not recognised until 1936.

==Pollution fatalities==

In late 1930 and early 1931, several thousand cases of acute pulmonary attacks occurred in the Meuse valley, centered on Engis, and 60 people died. A commission of inquiry set up by the Belgian government concluded that the cause was poisonous waste gases, primarily sulfur dioxide, emitted by the many factories in the valley and the furnaces used by the population, in conjunction with unusual climatic conditions coupled with the unique topographic characteristics of the area. Others have claimed that the deaths were the result acute fluorine intoxication.

<text>Huy ( ; ; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Liège, Belgium. Huy lies along the river Meuse, at the mouth of the small river Hoyoux. It is in the &quot;sillon industriel&quot;, the former industrial backbone of Wallonia, home to the Walloon population. 

The municipality consists of the following districts: Ben-Ahin, Huy, Neuville-sous-Huy, and Tihange.

==History==
The first village originated around the Roman &quot;castrum&quot;, an early fortress located on the right bank of the river Meuse. The village was evangelized by Saint Domitian, bishop of Tongeren in the 6th century and the town is mentioned for the first time in a 7th-century testament (as &quot;Hoius vicus&quot;, taking its name from the river Hoyoux).

In the early Middle Ages, Huy was one of the most prosperous cities on the Meuse, with a flourishing economy based mostly on metallurgy, but also on tanning, sculpting, woodworking, and wine-making. In the 10th century, Huy was promoted to county status, but soon became part of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, with which it would share its history for more than eight centuries. Huy was the recipient of the first historically known charter north of the Alps, confirming it as a city in 1066. It is around that time that Peter the Hermit harangued the locals and persuaded them to participate in the First Crusade, having already participated himself in the People&#x27;s Crusade and the Rhineland massacres in 1096.

In the 13th and 14th centuries, the economy boomed thanks to the cloth industry. The castle on a hill right in the middle of town, was used in times of war and strengthened accordingly. By the 15th century, it had become the symbol of the city. The following two centuries, however, witnessed a gradual decline in the city&#x27;s fortunes, due in large part to the strategic value of its location on the Meuse. In the latter part of the 17th century, Louis XIV&#x27;s wars caused the city to be repeatedly attacked and put to the sword, to the point that the frustrated inhabitants dismantled their own castle, source of their miseries, in 1715.

A new fortress was built by the Dutch in 1818 at the same strategic location above the town, called Fort de Huy. The 19th century was a period of relative prosperity based on the paper and other industries. The decline of heavy industry in the 20th century was felt here, as in other parts of Wallonia. Today, the city has started to prosper again, thanks in part to its tin products and tourist activity.

In 1970, the Tihange Nuclear Power Station was built nearby.

===Folklore===
Every seven years, a religious procession takes place in the so-called &#x27;septennial festivities&#x27; in commemoration of the end of a drought in 1656. The last one took place on 15 August 2019.

==Main sights==

The four &#x27;wonders of Huy&#x27; are (in Huy dialect):
*&quot;Li Pontia&quot;, the bridge over the River Meuse
*&quot;Li Rondia&quot;, the rose window of the Gothic Notre-Dame collegiate church
*&quot;Li Bassinia&quot;, the 15th-century fountain that stands in the middle of the &quot;Grand Place&quot;
*&quot;Li Tchestia&quot; or the Citadel of Huy, the 1818 fortress that dominates the city

==Cycling==
Huy is home to the finish of &quot;La Flèche Wallonne&quot; (English: &quot;Walloon Arrow&quot;; Dutch: &quot;Waalse Pijl&quot;), an important 1-day cycling race held midweek in mid-April. The race traverses, and finishes, at the summit of the &quot;Mur de Huy&quot; (English: &quot;Wall of Huy&quot;), a climb of about 1 kilometer with an average gradient of 10%, with sections of 20%. Huy has also been used in the Tour de France four times: 1995, 2001, 2006 and 2015.

==In popular culture==
Huy was used as a location for the first series of the 2014 BBC television drama series &quot;The Missing&quot;.

<doc id="175750" wikidata="Q732345" url="?curid=175750" title="Socket 7">
<text>Socket 7 is a physical and electrical specification for an x86-style CPU socket on a personal computer motherboard. It was released in June 1995. The socket supersedes the earlier Socket 5, and accepts P5 Pentium microprocessors manufactured by Intel, as well as compatibles made by Cyrix/IBM, AMD, IDT and others. Socket 7 was the only socket that supported a wide range of CPUs from different manufacturers and a wide range of speeds.

Differences between Socket 5 and Socket 7 are that Socket 7 has an extra pin and is designed to provide dual split rail voltage, as opposed to Socket 5&#x27;s single voltage. However, not all motherboard manufacturers supported the dual voltage on their boards initially. Socket 7 is backwards compatible; a Socket 5 CPU can be inserted and used on a Socket 7 motherboard.

Processors that used Socket 7 are the AMD K5 and K6, the Cyrix 6x86 and 6x86MX, the IDT WinChip, the Intel P5 Pentium (2.5–3.5 V, 75–200 MHz), the Pentium MMX (166–233 MHz), and the Rise Technology mP6.

Socket 7 typically uses a 321-pin (arranged as 19 by 19 pins) SPGA ZIF socket or the very rare 296-pin (arranged as 37 by 37 pins) SPGA LIF socket. The size is 1.95&quot; x 1.95&quot; (4.95 cm x 4.95 cm).

An extension of Socket 7, Super Socket 7, was developed by AMD for their K6-2 and K6-III processors to operate at a higher clock rate and use AGP.

Socket 7 and Socket 8 were replaced by Slot 1 and Slot 2 in 1999.

<doc id="175754" wikidata="Q13215" url="?curid=175754" title="Beta Arietis">
<text>Beta Arietis (β Arietis, abbreviated Beta Ari, β Ari), officially named Sheratan , is a star system and the second-brightest star in the constellation of Aries, marking the ram&#x27;s second horn.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;Beta Arietis&quot; is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. It also bears the Flamsteed designation &quot;6 Arietis&quot;.

The traditional name, &quot;Sheratan&quot; (or &quot;Sharatan, Sheratim),&quot; in full &quot;Al Sharatan,&quot; is from the Arabic الشرطان &quot;aš-šaraţān&quot; &quot;the two signs&quot;, a reference to the star having marked the northern vernal equinox together with Gamma Arietis several thousand years ago. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Sheratan&quot; for this star on 21 August 2016 and it is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Bond (asterism)&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of β Arietis, γ Arietis and α Arietis. Consequently, the Chinese name for β Arietis itself is (, ).

==Properties==
Beta Arietis has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.65. Based on dynamical parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of from Earth. This is a spectroscopic binary star system consisting of a pair of stars orbiting around each other with a separation that can not currently be resolved with a conventional telescope. However, the pair have been resolved using the Mark III Stellar Interferometer at the Mount Wilson Observatory. This allows the orbital elements to be computed, as well as the individual masses of the two stars. The stars complete their highly elliptical orbit every 107 days.

The primary star has a stellar classification of A3 V, which means it is an A-type main-sequence star that is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in its core region. The NStars project gives the star a spectral type of kA4 hA5 mA5 Va under the revised MK spectral classification system. The secondary star is a G-type main-sequence star, with a stellar classification of G2V. It is about four magnitudes fainter than the primary; hence the energy output from the system is dominated by the primary star. In a few million years, as the primary evolves toward a red giant, significant amounts of mass transfer to the secondary component is expected.

The primary has been classified as a rapid rotator, with a projected rotational velocity of 73 km/s providing a lower bound on the azimuthal rotational velocity along the equator. It may also be a mildly Am star, which is a class of stars that show a peculiar spectrum with strong absorption lines from various elements and deficiencies in others. In β Arietis, these absorption lines are broadened because of the Doppler effect from the rotation, making analysis of the abundance patterns difficult.

This system has been examined with the Spitzer Space Telescope for the presence of an excess emission of infrared, which would indicate a disk of dust. However, no significant excess was detected.

<text>The Exakta (sometimes Exacta) was a camera produced by the &quot;Ihagee Kamerawerk&quot; in Dresden, Germany, founded as the Industrie und Handels-Gesellschaft mbH, in 1912. The inspiration and design of both the VP Exakta and the Kine Exakta are the work of the Ihagee engineer Karl Nüchterlein (see Richard Hummel&#x27;s Spiegelreflexkameras aus Dresden), who did not survive the Second World War.

An Exakta VX was used by James Stewart&#x27;s character, a professional photographer, to spy on his possibly murderous neighbor in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rear Window&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Highlights of Exakta cameras include:

* First single-lens reflex camera (SLR) for 127 roll film (VP Exakta) came in 1933
* First wind-on lever in 1934
* First built-in flash socket, activated by the shutter, in 1935
* First popular SLR for 35mm film came in 1936, the Kine Exakta

Early Kine Exaktas had a fixed waist-level viewfinder, but later models, starting with the Exakta Varex, had an interchangeable waist- or eye-level finder. Examat and Travemat through-the-lens metering prisms were introduced in the mid 1960s. Most controls, including the shutter release and the film wind lever, are on the left-hand side, unlike many other cameras. The film is transported in the opposite direction to other 35mm SLRs. In classic Exaktas made between 1936 and 1969, two film canisters can be used, one containing unexposed film and a second into which is wound the exposed film. A sliding knife built into the bottom of the camera can be used to slice the film so that the canister containing the exposed film can be removed while preserving the unexposed film in the main canister. The knife was omitted in the Exakta VX500, one of the last &quot;official&quot; Exakta cameras.

The shutter release on classic Exaktas is on the front of the camera, rather than the top. It is pressed with the left forefinger. Amongst others, Topcon would use this bajonet mount for a time. This is quite similar to the Praktica design (that adapted it from Ihagee&#x27;s product), the shutter-release of which was located on the right-hand side of the camera-body front. Most later lenses produced for Exaktas (Ihagee did not make their own lenses), known either as &quot;automatic&quot; or &quot;semi-automatic&quot; lenses, included a button in an extension that would align over the camera body&#x27;s shutter release when the lens was mounted. The diaphragm of these lenses remained fully open, providing a bright viewfinder image, until the button was depressed halfway, when the iris would be stopped down to the shooting aperture; pressed further, the lens button engaged the camera&#x27;s shutter release button, tripping the shutter.

There was a full line of specialized equipment available for these system cameras that included microscope adaptor, extension bellows, stereo attachments, medical attachments and various specialized finder screens. Equipment is fully compatible between all models manufactured between 1936 and 1969. The spelling found on cameras has traditionally been &quot;Exakta&quot;, but some early Kine-Exaktas were marked &quot;Exacta&quot; specifically for marketing in France, Portugal and the U.S., perhaps for copyright reasons; and certainly a great number of American collectors refer to the whole range as the &quot;Exacta.&quot; A related line of smaller, simpler cameras was the &quot;Exa&quot; line; these, too, existed in several variations. The Beseler Topcon line of 35mm cameras used the same lens mount as the Exakta. In the early 1970s, the Exakta &quot;RTL 1000&quot; was introduced; it accepted the older models&#x27; lenses, but had its own range of viewfinders, which included a model with through-the-lens light metering. M42 lens mount variants of the RTL line of cameras also appeared under the Praktica name.

After an economic collapse following Germany&#x27;s reunification, the successor of the firm (Pentacon, which subsumed Ihagee) is now back in business. This company is not related to the Dutchman Johan Steenbergen, the founder of Ihagee, or with the Exakta, which was discontinued in the 1970s.

<text>Major Sir Malcolm Campbell (11 March 1885 – 31 December 1948) was a British racing motorist and motoring journalist. He gained the world speed record on land and on water at various times, using vehicles called &quot;Blue Bird&quot;, including a 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeam. His son, Donald Campbell, carried on the family tradition by holding both land speed and water speed records.

==Early life and family==
Campbell was born on 11 March 1885 in Chislehurst, Kent, the only son of William Campbell, a Hatton Garden diamond seller. He attended the independent Uppingham School. In Germany, learning the diamond trade, he gained an interest in motorbikes and races. Returning to Britain, he worked for two years at Lloyd&#x27;s of London for no pay, then for another year at £1 a week.

Between 1906 and 1908, he won all three London to Land&#x27;s End Trials motorcycle races. In 1910, he began racing cars at Brooklands. He christened his car &quot;Blue Bird&quot;, painting it blue, after seeing the play &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; by Maurice Maeterlinck at the Haymarket Theatre.

Campbell married Marjorie Dagmar Knott in 1913, but they divorced two years later.

Campbell then married Dorothy Evelyn Whittall in 1920; their son Donald was born in 1921, and their daughter, Jean, in 1923. Dorothy, who became Lady Campbell when he was knighted in 1931, later described him as &quot;quite unfitted for the role of husband and family man&quot;. They divorced in 1940.

Campbell married Betty Nicory in 1945 in Chelsea.

Campbell wrote a number of &quot;motoring mystery&quot; novels including &quot;Salute to the Gods&quot; which was the source material for the 1939 motion picture &quot;Burn &#x27;Em Up O&#x27;Connor&quot;.

==Military service==
At the outbreak of the First World War, Campbell initially enlisted as a motorcycle dispatch rider and fought at the Battle of Mons in August 1914. Shortly afterwards he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 5th Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment, a Territorial Force unit, on 2 September 1914. He was soon drafted into the Royal Flying Corps, where he was a ferry pilot, for his instructors believed he was too clumsy to make the grade as a fighter pilot.

During the late 1930s, he commanded the provost company of the 56th (London) Division of the Territorial Army. From 1940 to 1942, he commanded the military police contingent of the Coats Mission tasked with evacuating King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and their immediate family from London in the event of German invasion. On 23 January 1943 he was transferred from the Corps of Military Police to the General List. On 16 December 1945, having attained the age limit of 60, Campbell relinquished his commission and was granted the honorary rank of major.

==Grand Prix career==
Campbell competed in Grand Prix motor racing, winning the 1927 and 1928 Grand Prix de Boulogne in France driving a Bugatti T37A.

==Land speed record==
Campbell broke the land speed record for the first time in 1924 at at Pendine Sands near Carmarthen Bay in a 350HP V12 Sunbeam, now on display at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu. He broke nine land speed records between 1924 and 1935, with three at Pendine Sands and five at Daytona Beach. His first two records were accomplished whilst driving a racing car built by Sunbeam.

In 1925 Campbell set a new lap record of at Brooklands in a streamlined Chrysler Six.

On 4 February 1927, Campbell set the land speed record at Pendine Sands, covering the Flying Kilometre (in an average of two runs) at and the Flying Mile in , in the Napier-Campbell &quot;Blue Bird&quot;.

He set his final land speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah on 3 September 1935, and was the first person to drive an automobile over 300 mph, averaging in two passes.

==Water speed records==
Campbell developed and flotation-tested &quot;Blue Bird&quot; on Tilgate Lake, in Tilgate Park, Crawley. He set the water speed record four times, his highest speed being in the &quot;Blue Bird K4&quot;. He set the record on 19 August 1939 on Coniston Water, Lancashire (now in Cumbria).

==Politics==
Campbell stood for Parliament without success at the 1935 general election in Deptford for the Conservative Party, despite his links to the British Union of Fascists. Reportedly, he once adorned his car with a Fascist pennant of the London Volunteer Transport Service, though there has been no photographic evidence to support this claim.

==Death==

Campbell died after a series of strokes in 1948 in Reigate, Surrey, aged 63. He was one of the few land speed record holders of his era to die of natural causes, for so many had died in crashes.

==Honours and awards==
*In recognition of his service during the First World War, Campbell was appointed a Member of the Military Division of the Order of the British Empire on 3 June 1919.
*In 1931, on his return from Daytona Beach where he set a land speed record of , he was given a civic welcome and a Mansion House banquet in London, and was knighted at Buckingham Palace by King George V on 21 February 1931.
*He was awarded the Segrave Trophy in 1933 and 1939.
*He was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990.
*He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1994.
*In 2010, an English Heritage blue plaque commemorating Campbell and his son was installed at Canbury School, Kingston Hill, Kingston upon Thames, where Donald was born in March 1921 and the Campbell family lived until late 1922.

<text>Arthington is a linear village in Wharfedale, in the City of Leeds metropolitan borough in West Yorkshire, England. It is a civil parish which, according to the 2011 census, had a population of 532. It is in the Otley ward of the City of Leeds, and the Leeds North West parliamentary constituency.

==Geography==
The village is a small collection of dwellings and farms along the A659 road (Arthington Lane) running from Pool-in-Wharfedale in the West to Harewood in the East, and south of a section of the River Wharfe. Up Black Hill Road to the south is a working stone quarry.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Arthington&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book as &quot;Hardinctone&quot;, &quot;Ardintona&quot; and &quot;Ardinton&quot;. The first element of the name comes from the Old English personal name &quot;Eard&quot;, a nickname form of longer names like &quot;Eardwulf&quot;; the connecting element &quot;-ing-&quot;, used to indicate Eard&#x27;s association with the place; and the word &quot;tūn&quot; (&#x27;farmstead, estate&#x27;). Thus the name meant &#x27;Eard&#x27;s estate&#x27;. Spellings with &quot;th&quot; for &quot;d&quot; appear from the twelfth century onwards and are thought to show the influence of Old Norse pronunciation on the name.

==History==
Arthington was part of the estate of Aluuard of Northumbria, along with Adel, Burdon, Cookridge and Eccup, up until the Norman conquest of England. It was then given to the Count of Mortain (half brother of William the Conqueror). However, it had greatly reduced in value during the Conquest, falling from 30 shillings to 5, and much of the area was described as waste.

It was in the 12th century that Arthington (or Ardington) as a family name was established, as vassals to the tenant in chief, the Paynel and later the Luterel family. Peter de Arthington donated lands at Arthington to Kirkstall Abbey which led to the establishment of a nunnery known as Arthington Priory. The site is now believed to be occupied by Nunnery Farm, with the main house dated 1585 built from the ruins. By this time the region had improved with more land under agriculture and more inhabitants.

==Buildings==
The village mainly extends from the Wharfedale pub at the western end to the former parish church of St Peter on the eastern end. This dates from 1864 and is a Grade II Listed building like many others in the village. It became redundant because of the small congregation, and in 2007 it was renamed St Mary and St Abanoub as a Coptic Orthodox church. It serves a congregation living in West, North and East Yorkshire.

Arthington Hall was the home of the Arthington family from Norman times till the 18th century when it was taken over by the Sheepshank family who rebuilt in Italianate style and also paid for the church. It has been used for filming the UK TV series &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. To the West of the village is Creskeld Hall, a former Manor house, which has been used for filming the external shots of Home Farm in the TV serial Emmerdale.

The village was the site of Arthington Priory, one of only two Cluniac nunneries in England - the other being at Delapré Abbey in Northampton. The site is now believed to be occupied by Nunnery Farm, with the main house dated 1585 built from the ruins.

==Railway==
There used to be a railway junction (see Arthington railway station), where the (now-closed) line to Pool-in-Wharfedale station, Otley station, Ilkley station, and on to Skipton station joined the still open Harrogate Line from Leeds to Harrogate station. Arthington station closed completely in 1965 but there is a campaign to re-open the station and the former Otley line.

The village is at the northern end of the Bramhope Tunnel. The railway then crosses the dramatic stone Arthington Viaduct over the River Wharfe to Castley on the north side of the valley. The Arthington Show is actually held on grounds in Castley.

<doc id="175765" wikidata="Q37617" url="?curid=175765" title="Airedale Terrier">
<text>The Airedale Terrier (often shortened to &quot;Airedale&quot;), also called Bingley Terrier and Waterside Terrier, is a dog breed of the terrier type that originated in the valley (&quot;dale&quot;) of the River Aire, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is traditionally called the &quot;King of Terriers&quot; because it is the largest of the terrier breeds. The Airedale was bred from the Old English Black and Tan Terrier and the Otterhound and probably some other Terrier breeds, and has contributed to other dog breeds, such as the Yorkshire Terrier.

Originally bred to serve as a versatile hunting and all around working farm dog, this breed has also been used as a war dog, guide dog, and police dog in Britain. In the United States, the breed has been used to hunt big game, upland birds, and water fowl, and serve in many other working capacities.

==Description==
===Appearance===

The Airedale is the largest of the British terriers. They weigh in fit condition and have a height at the withers of for males, with females slightly smaller. The American Kennel Club standard specifies a very slightly smaller dog. Larger Airedales, up to can sometimes be found in North America. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;Oorangs&quot; as this was the name of a kennel in Ohio in the early 1900s that produced this much larger variation, or Roosevelt Terriers.

The Airedale has a medium-length black and tan coat with a harsh topcoat and a soft undercoat. They are an alert and energetic breed, &quot;not aggressive but fearless.&quot; It has been claimed that the larger &quot;Oorang&quot; type Airedales are more eager than the smaller, breed standard Airedales, but this is not necessarily so. The large type have been used for big game hunting and as family guardians or as pets, but usually do poorly in AKC (American Kennel Club) conformation shows. This larger type is also significantly more prone to hip dysplasia than the standard Airedales.

====Coat====
Like many terriers, this breed has a &#x27;broken&#x27; coat, which is hard and wiry. It is meant to be kept not so long as to appear ragged, and lies straight and close, covering body and legs. The outer coat is hard, wiry and stiff, the undercoat softer. The hardest coats are crinkly or just slightly waved. Curly soft coats are highly undesirable.

The coat is commonly called hypoallergenic, but studies have not found significant differences in the levels of allergens between Airedales and other dogs.

Airedales bearing undercoats are generally groomed by &quot;hand stripping&quot; where a small serrated edged knife is used to pull out loose hair from the dog&#x27;s coat. Most Airedales require frequent (6 to 8 weeks) clipping or stripping as they do not shed.

The AKC breed standard states that the correct coat color is either a black saddle, with a tan head, ears and legs; or a dark grizzle saddle (black mixed with gray and white). Grizzle that is a mix of red hair in the black, often on the area of back before the tail are often the best and harshest coats. There are, however, examples of non-standard black-coated and &quot;red&quot; (tan) coated Airedales. There are also short coated &quot;Redline&quot; type Airedales, similar in looks to the Airedale&#x27;s early days when the breed&#x27;s coats were shorter. Even with their shorter coat they still have the same hard wiry outer coat with a soft under coat and fall well within the criteria of the breed standard.

====Tail====
Traditionally the fluffy tail is long and erect. In most European countries and Australia it is illegal to dock dogs&#x27; tails unless it is for the dog&#x27;s benefit (e.g., if the tail is broken). This has resulted in the emergence of a spitz tail in some dogs. Selective breeding should see this change over time and the required slightly curled tail set high on the back again become common.

In other parts of the world the Airedale&#x27;s tail is commonly docked within five days of birth, but this is not considered a breed standard custom. To show an Airedale in the United States, the official AKC standard states &quot;The root of the tail should be set well up on the back. It should be carried gaily but not curled over the back. It should be of good strength and substance and of fair length.&quot;

====Size====
Airedales weigh approximately 50-80 pounds, being active and agile enough to perform well, while not too small to function as a physical deterrent, retriever or hunter. Some breeders have produced larger Airedale Terriers, such as the &#x27;Oorang Airedale&#x27;, developed in the 1920s.

Ex-Army captain and Airdale breeder Walter Lingo&#x27;s monthly magazine &quot;Oorang Comments&quot; (#25, page 81), stated that &quot;When full grown your Airedale dog will weigh from forty to fifty-five pounds and if a female will weigh slightly less. This is the standard weight, but when required, we can furnish oversized Airedales whose weight will be from sixty to one hundred pounds.&quot; Because Lingo tried to fill orders for everyone, the Oorang strain size was never standardized. Airedales weighing from 40 to 100 pounds were produced, but for the most part they were approximately 50 pounds and 22 to 24 inches at the shoulder. In the United States, the male Airedales measure 40 to 70 pounds, with the Oorang strain typically in the 80 to 120 pound range.

===Temperament===

The Airedale can be used as a working dog and also as a hunting dog. Airedales exhibit some herding characteristics as well and have a propensity to chase animals. They have no problem working with cattle and livestock. However, an Airedale that is not well trained will agitate and annoy the animals.

The Airedale Terrier, like most terriers, has been bred to hunt independently. As a result, the dog is very intelligent, independent, strong-minded, stoic, and sometimes stubborn. Airedales are also very loyal to their owners. If children and Airedales are both trained correctly, Airedales can be an excellent choice for a family dog. With training, Airedales &quot;can&quot; do well with cats and other small animals, especially when they are raised with them. However, they are bred to hunt small animals and their instinct with small animals is to attack.

Albert Payson Terhune wrote of the Airedale:&quot;Among the mine-pits of the Aire, the various groups of miners each sought to develop a dog which could outfight and outhunt and outthink the other miner&#x27;s dogs. Tests of the first-named virtues were made in inter-mine dog fights. Bit by bit, thus, an active, strong, heroic, compactly graceful and clever dog was evolved – the earliest true form of the Airedale.
He is swift, formidable, graceful, big of brain, an ideal chum and guard. ...To his master he is an adoring pal. To marauders he is a destructive lightning bolt.&quot;The Airedale Terrier ranks 37th in Stanley Coren&#x27;s The Intelligence of Dogs, being of above average working dog.

==Health==
A UK study found a life expectancy of 12 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (39.5%), old age (14%), urologic (9%), and cardiac (7%). In a 2000–2001 USA/Canada Health Survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (38%), urologic (17%), old age (12%), and cardiac (6%)

A study of North American teaching hospitals found 6.22% of Airedale Terriers to have hip dysplasia compared with 3.52% overall.

==History==

Airedale, a valley (dale) in the West Riding of Yorkshire, named for the River Aire that runs through it, was the birthplace of the breed. In the mid-19th century, working-class people created the Airedale Terrier by crossing the old English rough-coated Black and Tan Terrier with the Otterhound and an assortment of other breeds. In 1886, the Kennel Club of England formally recognized the Airedale Terrier breed.

In 1864 they were exhibited for the first time at a championship dog show sponsored by the Airedale Agricultural Society. They were classified under different names, including Rough Coated, Bingley and Waterside Terrier. In 1879 breed fanciers decided to call the breed the Airedale Terrier, a name accepted by the Kennel Club (England) in 1886.

The first imports of Airedale Terriers to North America were in the 1880s. The first Airedale to come to American shores was named Bruce. After his 1881 arrival, Bruce won the terrier class in a New York dog show.

The patriarch of the breed is considered to be CH Master Briar (1897–1906). Two of his sons, Crompton Marvel and Monarch, also made important contributions to the breed.

The first Canadian registrations are recorded in the Stud book of 1888–1889.

In 1910, the ATCA (Airedale Terrier Club of America) offered the Airedale Bowl as a perpetual trophy, which continues to this day. It is now mounted on a hardwood pedestal base, holding engraved plates with the names of the hundreds of dogs that have been awarded Best of Breed at the National Specialties.

The Airedale was extensively used in World War I to carry messages to soldiers behind enemy lines and transport mail. They were also used by the Red Cross to find wounded soldiers on the battlefield. There are numerous tales of Airedales delivering their messages despite terrible injury. An Airedale named &quot;Jack&quot; ran through half a mile of enemy fire, with a message attached within his collar. He arrived at headquarters with his jaw broken and one leg badly splintered, and right after he delivered the message, he dropped dead in front of its recipient.
Lieutenant Colonel Edwin Hautenville Richardson was responsible for the development of messenger and guard dogs in the British Army. He, along with his wife, established the British War Dog School at Shoeburyness in Essex, England. In 1916, they provided two Airedales (Wolf &amp; Prince) for use as message carriers. After both dogs proved themselves in battle, Airedales were given more duties, such as locating injured soldiers on the battlefield, an idea taken from the Red Cross.

Before the adoption of the German Shepherd as the dog of choice for law enforcement and search and rescue work, the Airedale terrier often filled this role.

In 1906, Richardson tried to interest the British Police in using dogs to accompany officers, for protection on patrol at night. Mr. Geddes, Chief Goods Manager for Hull Docks in Yorkshire, was convinced after he went and saw the impressive work of police dogs in Belgium. Geddes convinced Superintendent Dobie of the North Eastern Railway Police, to arrange a plan for policing the docks. Airedale Terriers were selected for duty as police dogs because of their intelligence, good scenting abilities and their hard, wiry coats that were easy to maintain and clean. They were trained in Hull to attack people not in uniform which could cause problems for their handlers when off duty. The first four dogs began patrols in Hull Docks in 1908, and the scheme was later extended to other docks policed by the North Eastern Railway Police.

At the beginning of the Russo-Japanese war in 1904, the Russian embassy in London contacted Lt. Colonel Richardson for help acquiring dogs for the Russian Army, trained to take the wounded away from the battlefields. He sent terriers, mostly Airedale Terriers, for communication and sanitary services. Although these original imports perished, Airedale Terriers were reintroduced to Russia in the early 1920s for use by the Red Army. Special service dog units were created in 1923, and Airedale Terriers were used as demolition dogs, guard dogs, police tracking dogs and casualty dogs. 

During the 1930s, when airedales were farmed like livestock, Capt. Walter Lingo, of LaRue, Ohio, developed the Oorang Airedale strain. The name came from a line of bench champions, headed by King Oorang 11, a dog which was said to have been the finest utility dog. King could retrieve waterfowl and upland game, tree raccoons, drive cattle and sheep, and bay mountain lions, bears, and wolves. King even fought one of the best fighting bull terriers, and killed his opponent. He also trained in Red Cross work, and served the American Expeditionary Force at the front in France.

Lingo simply was not satisfied with the average strain of Airedale, and after an incredible series of breedings, for which he brought in great Airedales from all over the world, he created the &quot;King Oorang&quot;. At the time, Field and Stream magazine called it, &quot;the greatest utility dog in the history of the world.&quot; The Oorang Kennel Company continued until Walter Lingo&#x27;s death in 1969. To help promote the King Oorang, as well as his kennels, Lingo created the Oorang Indians football team headed up by Jim Thorpe. The team played in National Football League from 1922 to 1923. Jerry Siebert, an Airedale breeder in Buckeye Lake, Ohio, followed in Lingo&#x27;s footsteps, and bred &quot;Jerang Airedales&quot;. There is a kennel in Tennessee that claims to have original Oorang Airedales.

After the First World War, the Airedales&#x27; popularity rapidly increased thanks to stories of their bravery on the battlefield and also because Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, and Warren Harding owned Airedales. President Harding&#x27;s Airedale, Laddie Boy, was the &quot;first celebrity White House pet&quot;. President Harding had a special chair hand carved for him to sit on at very important Cabinet meetings. In the 1920s, the Airedale became the most popular breed in the USA.

President Roosevelt claimed that &quot;An Airedale can do anything any other dog can do and then lick the other dog, if he has to.&quot;

1949 marked the peak of the Airedales&#x27; popularity in the US, ranked 20th out of 110 breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club.

The Airedale Terrier was recognized by United Kennel Club in 1914 and the American Kennel Club in 1888. The Airedale Terrier Club of America (ATCA), founded in 1900 is the parent club of the breed in the United States and the official-spokes organization for the breed with the American Kennel Club (AKC). The Airedale Terrier Club of America periodically holds performance and conformation events. The Airedale judged to be Best of Breed at these national specialty shows is awarded the Airedale Bowl.

<text>The or the lies in the southern-central region of Japan&#x27;s main island Honshū. The region includes the prefectures of Nara, Wakayama, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyōgo and Shiga, often also Mie, sometimes Fukui, Tokushima and Tottori. The metropolitan region of Osaka, Kobe and Kyoto (Keihanshin region) is the second-most populated in Japan after the Greater Tokyo Area.

== Name ==
The terms , , and have their roots during the Asuka period. When the old provinces of Japan were established, several provinces in the area around the then-capital Yamato Province were collectively named Kinai and Kinki, both roughly meaning &quot;the neighbourhood of the capital&quot;.

Kansai (literally &quot;west of the tollgate&quot;) in its original usage refers to the land west of the Osaka Tollgate (), the border between Yamashiro Province and Ōmi Province (present-day Kyoto and Shiga prefectures). During the Kamakura period, this border was redefined to include Ōmi and Iga Provinces. It is not until the Edo period that Kansai came to acquire its current form. (&quot;see Kamigata&quot;)

While the use of the terms &quot;Kansai&quot; and &quot;Kinki&quot; have changed over history, in most modern contexts the use of the two terms is interchangeable. The term &quot;Kinai&quot;, once synonymous with Kinki, now refers to the Kyoto–Osaka–Kobe (Keihanshin) area at the center of the Kansai region. Like all regions of Japan, the Kansai region is not an administrative unit, but rather a cultural and historical one, which emerged much later during the Heian period after the expansion of Japan saw the development of the Kantō region to the east and the need to differentiate what was previously the center of Japan in Kansai emerged.

=== &quot;Kinki&quot; from an international perspective ===
The name &quot;Kinki&quot; is pronounced similarly to the English word &quot;kinky&quot;, which means &quot;twisted&quot; or &quot;perverted&quot;. This has become a problem due to internationalization, and some organizations have changed their name as a result.

In April 2016, changed its English name to Kindai University. uses &quot;Kansai&quot; in English notation, and also uses &quot;Kansai&quot; in English notation since 2015. In addition, the changed its name to &quot;Kansai Chamber of Commerce and Industry Association&quot; on July 22, 2015. In the fall of 2014, asked the government to unify the name of the local agency to &quot;Kansai&quot;. On June 28, 2003, the English name of the major private railway company Kintetsu Railway was changed from &quot;Kinki Nippon Railway Co., Ltd.&quot; to the official abbreviation Kintetsu Corporation. It was subsequently changed again to &quot;Kintetsu Railway Co., Ltd.&quot; on April 1, 2015.

==Overview==

The Kansai region is a cultural center and the historical heart of Japan, with 11% of the nation&#x27;s land area and 22,757,897 residents as of 2010. The Osaka Plain with the cities of Osaka and Kyoto forms the core of the region. From there the Kansai area stretches west along the Seto Inland Sea towards Kobe and Himeji, and east encompassing Lake Biwa, Japan&#x27;s largest freshwater lake. In the north, the region is bordered by the Sea of Japan, to the south by the Kii Peninsula and the Pacific Ocean, and to the east by the Ibuki Mountains and Ise Bay. Four of Japan&#x27;s national parks lie within its borders, in whole or in part. The area also contains six of the seven top prefectures in terms of national treasures. Other geographical features include Amanohashidate in Kyoto Prefecture and Awaji Island in Hyōgo.

The Kansai region is often compared with the Kantō region, which lies to its east and consists primarily of Tokyo and the surrounding area. Whereas the Kantō region is symbolic of standardization throughout Japan, the Kansai region displays many more idiosyncrasies – the culture in Kyoto, the mercantilism of Osaka, the history of Nara, or the cosmopolitanism of Kobe – and represents the focus of counterculture in Japan. This East-West rivalry has deep historical roots, particularly from the Edo period. With a samurai population of less than 1% the culture of the merchant city of Osaka stood in sharp contrast to that of Edo, the seat of power for the Tokugawa shogunate.

Many characteristic traits of Kansai people descend from Osaka merchant culture. Catherine Maxwell, an editor for the newsletter &quot;Omusubi&quot;, writes: &quot;Kansai residents are seen as being pragmatic, entrepreneurial, down-to-earth and possessing a strong sense of humor. Kantō people, on the other hand, are perceived as more sophisticated, reserved and formal, in keeping with Tokyo&#x27;s history and modern status as the nation&#x27;s capital and largest metropolis.&quot;

Kansai is known for its food, especially Osaka, as supported by the saying . Popular Osakan dishes include takoyaki, okonomiyaki, kitsune udon and kushikatsu. Kyoto is considered a mecca of traditional Japanese cuisine like kaiseki. Kansai has many wagyu brands such as Kobe beef and Tajima cattle from Hyōgo, Matsusaka beef from Mie and Ōmi beef from Shiga. Sake is another specialty of the region, the areas of Nada-Gogō and Fushimi produce 45% of all sake in Japan. As opposed to food from Eastern Japan, food in the Kansai area tends to be sweeter, and foods such as nattō tend to be less popular.

The dialects of the people from the Kansai region, commonly called &quot;Kansai-ben&quot;, have their own variations of pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. Kansai-ben is the group of dialects spoken in the Kansai area, but is often treated as a dialect in its own right.

Kansai is one of the most prosperous areas for baseball in Japan. Two Nippon Professional Baseball teams, Hanshin Tigers and Orix Buffaloes, are based in Kansai. Koshien Stadium, the home stadium of the Hanshin Tigers, is also famous for the nationwide high school baseball tournaments. In association football, the Kansai Soccer League was founded in 1966 and currently has 16 teams in two divisions. Cerezo Osaka, Gamba Osaka, and Vissel Kobe belong to J. League Division 1 and Kyoto Sanga F.C. belongs to J. League Division 2, the top professional leagues in Japan.

==History==
As a part of the reforms of the seventh and eighth centuries, the provinces of Yamato, Yamashiro, Kawachi, Settsu, and Izumi, were established by the Gokishichidō. These provinces were collectively referred to as Kinai or Kinki.

The Kansai region lays claim to the earliest beginnings of Japanese civilization. It was Nara, the most eastern point on the Silk Road, that became the site of Japan&#x27;s first permanent capital. This period (AD 710–784) saw the spread of Buddhism to Japan and the construction of Tōdai-ji in 745. The Kansai region also boasts the Shinto religion&#x27;s holiest shrine at Ise Shrine (built in 690 AD) in Mie prefecture.

The Heian period saw the capital moved to Heian-kyō (, present-day Kyoto), where it would remain for over a thousand years until the Meiji Restoration. During this golden age, the Kansai region would give birth to traditional Japanese culture. In 788, Saicho, the founder of the Tendai sect of Buddhism established his monastery at Mount Hiei in Shiga prefecture. Japan&#x27;s most famous tale, and some say the world&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; was penned by Murasaki Shikibu while performing as a lady-in-waiting in Heian-kyo. Noh and Kabuki, Japan&#x27;s traditional dramatic forms both saw their birth and evolution in Kyoto, while Bunraku, Japanese puppet theater, is native to Osaka.

Kansai&#x27;s unique position in Japanese history, plus the lack of damage from wars or natural disasters, has resulted in Kansai region having more UNESCO World Heritage Listings than any other region of Japan. The five World Heritage Listings include: Buddhist Monuments in the Hōryū-ji Area, Himeji Castle, Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities), Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara, and Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range.

== Economy ==
The economy of Kansai region is largely based on that of Keihanshin (Greater Osaka) metropolitan area. Keihanshin metropolitan area contains the Hanshin Industrial Region and is centered mainly around chemical, metal, and other heavy industries. Keihanshin region also contains strong medical and electronics industries within its economy.

== Demographics ==
Per Japanese census data, Kansai region much like Keihanshin has experienced a small population increase beginning around 2010.

==Education==

===International schools===
International schools have served expatriates in the Kansai region since 1909. Outside of Tokyo and Yokohama, Kansai has the largest number of international schools.

In 1909, Deutsche Schule Kobe was founded to serve German, Austrian and German-speaking Swiss expatriates, traders and missionaries living in the Kobe area. After a long history of teaching a German curriculum, the school changed to The Primary Years Programme (PYP) in 2002. Today, Deutsche Schule Kobe/European School provides curriculum in three languages: German, English, and Japanese.

In 1913, Canadian Methodist Academy opened its doors to sixteen children. The school, renamed Canadian Academy in 1917, served children of missionary parents from grade one through high school and offered boarding facilities for students from throughout Asia. Today, the day and boarding school offers a PreK to Grade 12 education on the campus on Rokkō Island, a human-made island. The school, which is no longer affiliated with Canada or the church, is the largest school for expatriates in Kansai. The school is approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education and accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the Council of International Schools. The school awards both the International Baccalaureate (IB) and U.S. high school diplomas.

The number of international schools burgeoned after World War II.

In 1946, St. Michael&#x27;s International School was established by Anglican Bishop Michael Yashiro and Miss Leonora Lee, a British missionary. Today, the school offers a distinctive British-style primary education based on the National Curriculum of England and Wales. The school has joint accreditation from the Council of International Schools and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.

Brother Charles Fojoucyk and Brother Stephen Weber founded Marist Brothers International School in 1951 after communist authorities pressured them to leave Tientsin, China. Today, the international Montessori - Grade 12 school enrolls approximately 300 students. The school is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.

In 1957, a missionary homeschooled her son, his best friend and another student in their home. The next year, the home turned into Kyoto Christian Day School and a full-time teacher was hired. The school was renamed Kyoto International School in 1966. Today, the school serves students from two to fourteen years old. The school has been accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) since 1992 and authorized by the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) since 2006.

Kansai is also served by Osaka International School, Lycée français international de Kyoto as well as Chinese and Korean schools.

<doc id="175769" wikidata="Q1722436" url="?curid=175769" title="Relational calculus">
<text>The relational calculus consists of two calculi, the tuple relational calculus and the domain relational calculus, that is part of the relational model for databases and provide a declarative way to specify database queries. The raison d&#x27;être of relational calculus is the formalization of query optimization, which is finding more efficient manners to execute the same query in a database.

The relational calculus is similar to the relational algebra, which is also part of the relational model: While the relational calculus is meant as a declarative language that prescribes no execution order on the subexpressions of a relational calculus expression, the relational algebra is meant as an imperative language: the sub-expressions of a relational algebraic expression are meant to be executed from left-to-right and inside-out following their nesting.

Per Codd&#x27;s theorem, the relational algebra and the domain-independent relational calculus are logically equivalent.

== Example ==
A relational algebra expression might prescribe the following steps to retrieve the phone numbers and names of book stores that supply &quot;Some Sample Book&quot;:

# Join book stores and titles over the BookstoreID.
# Restrict the result of that join to tuples for the book &quot;Some Sample Book&quot;.
# Project the result of that restriction over StoreName and StorePhone.

A relational calculus expression would formulate this query in the following descriptive or declarative manner:

:Get StoreName and StorePhone for book stores such that there exists a title BK with the same BookstoreID value and with a BookTitle value of &quot;Some Sample Book&quot;.

== Mathematical properties ==

The relational algebra and the domain-independent relational calculus are logically equivalent: for any algebraic expression, there is an equivalent expression in the calculus, and vice versa. This result is known as Codd&#x27;s theorem.

== Purpose ==
The raison d&#x27;être of the relational calculus is the formalization of query optimization. Query optimization consists in determining from a query the most efficient manner (or manners) to execute it. Query optimization can be formalized as translating a relational calculus expression delivering an answer A into efficient relational algebraic expressions delivering the same answer A.

<text>Anshan () is an inland prefecture-level city in central-southeast Liaoning province, People&#x27;s Republic of China, about south of the provincial capital Shenyang. As of the 2020 census, it was Liaoning&#x27;s third most populous city with a population of 3,325,372 people, over an area of about spanning from east to the west. Its built-up area encompassing the 4 Anshan urban districts (1,543,696 inhabitants), the 4 out of 5 urban Liaoyang districts (796,962 inhabitants, Gongchangling not being conurbated yet) and Liaoyang county largely being conurbated, was home to 2,712,789 million inhabitants in 2020.

The city&#x27;s name came from the horse saddle-like shape of a nearby mountain south of the city, which can be seen on the left (west) about five minutes before the northbound train arrives at Anshan railway station. Anshan is home to the Anshan Iron and Steel Group, one of the largest steel producers in China. Anshan is sister city with Sheffield, United Kingdom.

Anshan holds one-third of the world&#x27;s supply of talcum and a quarter of the world&#x27;s reserves of magnesite. Anshan also produced the largest ever jade stone, now a local tourist attraction carved as a Buddha statue.

==History==

The area of Anshan has been inhabited since prehistoric times. It has been a site of iron mining and metallurgy for over 2,000 years. The area remained of little significance, a small city in Liaodong province, overshadowed by neighbouring Liaoyang city, until the mid-20th Century.

In 1587 Anshan was fortified by the Ming Dynasty to combat the growing power of the Manchu. The city was burnt down during the Boxer Rebellion, and was destroyed again in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905). As a result of this war, Japan had gained influence in Liaoning and was engaged in industrialising the region. Anshan lay beside the new South Manchuria Railway line that ran from the port of Dalian to the major city of Shenyang.

As part of the economic privileges that Japan forced China to cede in 1915, Japan obtained concessions in Anshan.

From 1918 to 1945, Anshan was under Japanese colonial control and was a centre for modern iron and steel production. After the Mukden Incident in 1931, Japan occupied the northeast of China. The mills were turned into a Japanese-owned monopoly. In 1933, the site was expanded to include steel production and the company was renamed Showa Steel Works. Anshan became part of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. In 1937, Puyi officially designated Anshan as a city. During Japanese colonial control, Anshan was ethnically separated, with Japanese living east of its railway line and Chinese living west of it. Schools in the city were also segregated.

Additional industries developed around the iron and steel mills. Anshan grew significantly in size around this new industrial site, becoming one of, if not the largest producers of iron and steel in Asia. It was therefore of strategic importance in the Pacific War, and was subject to several attacks by B-29 Superfortress strategic bombers of the USAAF. The Japanese Army detached the 1st &quot;Chutai&quot; (unit) of the 104th &quot;Sentai&quot; (squadron) of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force, to Anshan, with other air squadrons for industrial defence purposes. Although this unit was equipped with modern Nakajima Ki-84 Ia (Manshu Type) Hayate &quot;Frank&quot; fighters, manufactured by Manshūkoku Hikōki Seizo KK, the plant suffered heavy damage from the air raids, losing up to 30% of its capacity.

After the war in Europe ended, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, as the Red Army simultaneously launched Operation August Storm. Soviet forces advanced rapidly and soon captured much of Manchuria from the Japanese. In late 1945, the Soviet Red Army occupied a large amount of Liaoning and took major portions of the area&#x27;s manufacturing and mining equipment to the Soviet Union.

With the defeat of Japan in 1945, Anshan was returned to China along with the rest of the Chinese Manchuria. Civil war continued between the Nationalists and the Communists. The Nationalist Government attempted to revive manufacturing in the area during their period of control from 1946 to 1948. The Nationalists withdrew from Anshan in February 1948. 

The Communists entered the city on 28 February. Upon beginning governing in Anshan, Communist authorities sought to implement New Democracy by nationalizing some private enterprises with compensation and providing financial support to other private business. A significant amount of Japanese remained in Anshan, and they were governed indirectly by the CPC through an intermediary group of Japanese Communist cadre, which included members of the Japanese Communist Party who had been in the region before 1945, former Japanese soldiers who had been reeducated in Yan&#x27;an, and Japanese Communists recruited and trained by the CPC after 1945. 

The northeast of China was marked out to become a major industrial centre for the new People&#x27;s Republic of China. Anshan became a key part of China&#x27;s approach to &quot;socialist industrialization&quot; which, modeled after the Soviet approach, focused on the development of heavy industry state-owned enterprises. Its mining and manufacturing industries had to be rebuilt almost from scratch, however. During this period, Anshan was given the same status as provinces, although it was reversed after the period ended. In December 1948, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company—also known as &quot;Angang&quot;—was founded. It was a centre of industrialization as part of China&#x27;s First Five-Year Plan. Production in the newly repaired steel plant resumed on July 9, 1949. The plant was the largest steel producer in China. Anshan developed the nickname, &quot;Steel Metropolis&quot;. Other industries set up alongside the steel plant including mining for coal, iron and other minerals. 

Anshan became a formal administrative region under the Northeastern People&#x27;s Government (later renamed as the Northeastern Administration Commission) in November 1949.

Anshan is reported to have served as a base for Soviet MIG fighter aircraft and pilots during the Korean War (1950–1953) in air combat operations against US/UN forces.

In 1954, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited Anshan.

On March 12, 1953, the city became a municipality under the Central Government&#x27;s direct administration. Haicheng County and Xiuyan County were subordinated to Liaodong Province. Tai&#x27;an County was subordinated to Liaoxi Province. On August 22, 1954, the central government decided that Anshan should be administered by Liaoning Province. 

During the Cultural Revolution, on 17 August 1967, the Communist Party of China&#x27;s central authorities issued the &quot;Resolution on the Anshan Question&quot; which criticized the CPC Angang Committee and the CPC Anshan City Committee members as capitalist roaders. Three days later, the Anshan City Military Control Committee was established by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army with Zhang Feng and Chen Shaokun as the Committee directors. The Committee implemented military control over both Angang and Anshan. On 20 March 1968, the city&#x27;s Revolutionary Committee was created.

The State Council confirmed that Anshan should be in charge of Xiuyan County and Haicheng City in 1985.

The furnaces of the steel plant were changed in the 1980s to designs which blow oxygen in from the front. This increased the production and also reduced pollution. In the 1990s, they were additionally altered to blow oxygen in from the top as well. This further increases production and reduces pollution. In December 2000, all three production lines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company switched from mould-casting to continuous casting. This new technology has significantly reduced the dust and other pollution in the city. The new plant equipment is also much less labour-intensive. This has meant a reduction in the workforce has caused an unemployment problem in the city. A new drive to market Anshan as a tourist destination is hoped to help bolster the city&#x27;s economy.

==Geography==
Sited north of the Liao River plains, Anshan has wide flat lands in the west and central regions that develop into hilly and mountainous terrain on the southeastern fringes, which is bounded by the Qian Mountains and contains the famous Qianshan National Park. The region is rich in minerals including iron ore, coal, magnesite, talcum and jade. The plains of western Anshan have large flat fertile fields ideal for agriculture, with of arable land accounting for 26.4% of its total land area. One such agricultural product that Anshan has become renowned for is the Nanguo pears (, &quot;Pyrus ussuriensis c.v. Nanguo&quot;), nicknamed the &quot;king of pears&quot;. Anshan was used as a travel post with motels during the Ming Dynasty () for travellers who passed by on work duty.

===Climate===
Anshan has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;) characterised by hot, humid summers, due to the monsoon, and rather long, cold, and arid winters, due to the Siberian anticyclone. The four seasons here are distinctive. Nearly half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August. The monthly 24-hour average temperatures ranges from in January to in July, while the annual mean is . Sunshine is generous and amounts to 2,595.4 hours annually, while relative humidity averages 55%, ranging from 44% in April to 71% in July and August. Extreme temperatures have ranged from up to .

== Administrative divisions ==
Anshan is divided into four districts, one town, one county and one autonomous county.

==Economy==

The north east of China is a major industrial zone and Anshan is one of the key sites of the north east. Anshan is in the midst of a at least a quarter of China&#x27;s iron and coal resources. The city is renowned as &quot;China&#x27;s capital of iron and steel&quot;. Prior to the development of the Iron and Steel industries, Anshan was a relatively small city of little importance. As the steel mills expanded, so to did the city. Spin off industries developed alongside the steel plant making the area a centre of heavy industry.

As a joint Sino-Japanese venture, Anshan Zhenzing Iron Ore Company Unlimited was started in Anshan in 1918. When Japan occupied Northeast China in 1931, these mills were turned into a Japanese owned monopoly. Anshan subsequently became part of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and additional industries developed around the iron and steel mills. Due to its mills, the city became a significant strategic industrial hub during World War II and as such, was subject to constant Allied bombing during the war.

Total production of processed iron in Manchuria reached 1,000,000 tonnes in 1931–32, of which almost half was made by Shōwa Steel in Anshan. Iron production grew to 7,000,000 tonnes in 1938 and by 1941, Shōwa Steel Works had a total capacity production of 1,750,000 tonnes of iron bars and 1,000,000 tonnes of processed steel. By 1942, Anshan&#x27;s Shōwa Steel Works total production capacity reached 3,600,000 tonnes, making it one of the major iron and steel centers in the world.

In 1945 the steel plant was looted by Soviet forces. The Republic of China government partially repaired the site, but it was destroyed again during the Chinese civil war that saw the Communist forces victorious. The mills were once again repaired and Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) was founded in 1948. From then to 2001, the company produced 290 million tons of steel, 284 million tons of pig iron and 192 million tons of rolled steel. Until the opening of a new steel plant in Shanghai, Angang was the largest steel producer in China. Today, Angang consists of three steelworks with 13 rolling mills plus supporting plants which produce coke, refractory materials and machinery for the steel plants. The company has an annual production capacity of 10 million tons of pig iron, 10 million tons of steel and 9.5 million tons of rolled steel. A quarter of China&#x27;s total iron ore reserves, about 10 billion tons, are located in Anshan, ensuring that the city will remain an important steel producer well into the future.

Anshan is rich in other mineral wealth too. The southern and south eastern areas of Anshan are rich in magnesite, with reserves equivalent to a quarter of all worldwide reserves. Anshan also has the world&#x27;s largest reserve of talcum, accounting for fully one third of the entire world supply. The Xiuyan area of Anshan is known for the production of jade. The largest single jade stone ever found came from Xiuyan, now carved into the form of a Buddha, it is a major tourist attraction in the area.

Anshan is serviced by Shenyang airport, about to the north, and by two major highways linking it with Shenyang and Dalian.

The government of Anshan established a five-year plan in 2000 with the aim of turning the city into a strong modern industrial city with plenty of tourism. It also aimed to make the city GDP reach 100 billion RMB by 2005 and to build a modern industrial city by using advances in technology to transform the traditional industries. Attracting foreign investment is also another main idea in the plan. The Anshan government anticipates the foreign investment assets would be around 80 billion RMB by 2005.

Anshan has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Maanshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China. The opportunities for engaging Anshan&#x27;s consumers have been documented by the ethnographer and cultural sociologist Michael B. Griffiths.

==Demographics==
Out of the 3,584,000 people living in Anshan prefecture, 519,400 are ethnic Manchu, a holdover from northeast China&#x27;s historical rule by the ethnic group. They are mainly in or around the Xiuyan Man regional ethnic autonomy area which is within Anshan&#x27;s borders. During the last years of the Qing dynasty, large numbers of Han people migrated to the north east in search of work. This pattern continued into the 20th century. The development of Anshan as a large industrial center during and after World War II caused the city&#x27;s population to increase rapidly, and the new arrivals began to significantly outnumber the local Man people. As of the last census data, Anshan was home to 48 Chinese ethnic groups. The Han people make up the lion&#x27;s share at 3,020,500 people. Next, after the Han and Man people, come the Hui and the Chaoxian with 23,400 and 10,000 people respectively. The Hui population is widely dispersed but the Chaoxian population is mostly concentrated in Teixi (West district) and Qianshan district.

Anshan has a population of 3.65 million at the 2010 census. As the city has expanded, the area between Anshan and the neighbouring city of Liaoyang has become urbanised, with little or no farmland visible on route between them. According to the 2010 census, the conurbation of urban Anshan and urban Liaoyang districts contains 2.17 million inhabitants.

The city of Anshan can be divided into districts. The East district, Tiedong has a population of 452,900. The western district, Tiexi has 311,600 people. These two districts are demarcated by the railway lines that run north to south through the city. The north western portion of the city is dominated by the large steel works of Angang. The district of Lishan houses 425,600 people and the suburbs of Qianshan district have 366,200 soles. Within Anshan prefecture lies the subordinate city of Haicheng which accounts for 1,181,100 people. The neighbouring subordinate town of Tai&#x27;an has 354,700 people.

==Transportation==

Anshan has no river or sea port. The nearby military airport, Anshan Teng&#x27;ao Airport (AOG), also accepts commercial domestic flights. Currently there are five routes in operation, Anshan–Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Nanjing, with one flight each per day throughout the year. Anshan Teng&#x27;ao Airport is southwest of the city centre. In addition to the small terminal building at the airport, there is also a city terminal situated just off Qianshan Road in Tiexi district. Passengers may buy tickets and check-in at the city terminal, from which they are taken by coach to the main airport terminal. The nearest other major commercial airports are Shenyang Taoxian International Airport (SHE), about to the north and Dalian Zhoushuizi International Airport about to the south.

The city is beside the Shenyang–Dalian Expressway (part of the G15 Shenyang–Haikou Expressway), a privately funded eight-lane tolled highway, and was the first road of its kind in mainland China. The Liaozhong Ring Expressway (G91) passes just a few kilometers north of Anshan city. It connects east to Benxi and west onto the Jingshen Expressway (G1). The Panhai and Danxi Expressways (together forming the G16) pass through Anshan&#x27;s counties of Haicheng and Xiuyan, connecting them to Yingkou and Panjin in the west and Dandong to the east.

Anshan is connected to the Chinese rail network with rail routes to Beijing, Dalian, and to the northeastern provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang as well as to eastern Inner Mongolia, and even a direct, albeit slow, train to Hong Kong. As of December 2012, the new Harbin–Dalian High-Speed Railway serves Anshan West Railway Station and Haicheng West Railway Station. It connects south to Dalian and north east to Shenyang, Changchun and Harbin. This line was hailed as the world&#x27;s first alpine high-speed rail line. In summer it runs at its full speed of 300 km/h but in winter speeds are restricted to 200 km/h. High-speed services also run via Anshan to Beijing. Tai&#x27;an county of Anshan is served by another high-speed rail line linking Shenyang to Beijing.

Long-distance coaches run to all the main cities of the province as well as to Beijing.

Local transportation is primarily by bus or taxi. Anshan used to have a single tram line—along Zhonghua Avenue, through the city centre and past Angang main gate—but this has been closed and the tracks removed. Due to the flat topography of the city centre, bicycles are popular. Almost all roads have a wide cycle lane on each side. Often this lane is further protected by a traffic island that separates the bikes from larger motor vehicles.

==Tourist attractions==
In recent years, Anshan has been trying to throw off its image as a heavy industrial town along with the dirt and pollution that goes with such industry. It has remodeled itself as a tourist destination.

Foremost among the attractions in Anshan is Qianshan National Park which is about , by road, to the southeast of the city. Qianshan, literally &#x27;Thousand Mountains&#x27;, is an abbreviation of &#x27;Thousand lotus flower mountains&#x27;. The peaks were said to resemble the petals of the lotus flower which had been dropped to earth by a goddess. The park area of , is filled with both Buddhist and Taoist temples, monasteries and nunneries. It is one of few locations where both religions are found sharing the same site. Cars are not allowed within the park.

One of the mountains in the park is believed to resemble Maitreya Buddha. It is claimed to be the largest naturally occurring image of Maitreya in the world. Several temples have been built on the peaks of the overlooking hills. Near the Buddha is a bird park.

Another major tourist location is &quot;219 Park&quot;. The name of the park commemorates the liberation of Anshan by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army on February 19, 1948. The park contains the Dongshan (East Mountain) scenic area as well as numerous lakes.

Of particular note is the Jade Buddha Palace. This large Buddhist temple complex of 22,104 square metres, houses the world&#x27;s largest statue of Buddha made of Jade (It is called jade in Chinese, but in English it is Serpentine). It is a single piece of jade stone measuring 6.88 metres in width, 4.10 metres front to back and 7.95 metres high. The jade stone weighs 260.76 tons. The front of the stone has been carved with an image of Sakyamuni (aka. Gautama) Buddha. On the back of the stone Guanyin (aka. Avalokitesvara) Buddha has been carved. The jade stone was found in 1960 in Xiuyan County. It was declared a treasure of the State and listed as a protected property by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. Anshan city government commissioned the carving which took a team of 120 sculptures 18 months to complete. The temple complex was opened on September 3, 1996. The building that houses the Jade Buddha statue is 33 metres tall, representing the 33 layers of heaven in Buddhism. It claims to be one of the tallest two-story buildings of traditional Chinese architectural style in China.

Anshan contains naturally hot spring water spas. There are four spas/hotels in Anshan. Visitors may shower and bathe in the spring water. At Tanggangzi Spa, once frequented by the Qing Emperors of China, visitors may have mud treatment where they are buried in hot volcanic sand, which has been infused with the spring water. The geothermal energy is also used to provide hot steam and water for winter heating throughout the area.

<text>Guided by Voices is an American indie rock band formed in 1983 in Dayton, Ohio. It has made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter Robert Pollard. The most well-known lineup of the band consisted of Pollard (lead vocals), his brother Jim (guitar, bass), Mitch Mitchell (lead guitars), Tobin Sprout (vocals, rhythm guitars), Kevin Fennell (drums), and bassist Greg Demos. Noted at first for its lo-fi aesthetic and Portastudio four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices&#x27; music was influenced by early post–British Invasion garage rock, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, punk rock and post-punk. The band has had a prolific output, releasing 41 full-length albums along with many other releases, and has garnered a dedicated cult following. Their songs are known for their frequent brevity and for ending abruptly or intertwining with homemade sound effects.

Guided by Voices initially disbanded in 2004. In 2010 the &quot;classic&quot; lineup reunited to perform at Matador Records&#x27; 21st anniversary party, subsequently touring and releasing six new albums. GBV broke up a second time in 2014, but Pollard again rebooted the band with a new album and a new lineup in 2016.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years (1983–1991) ===
Formed in Dayton, Ohio, in the early 1980s, Guided by Voices began their career as a bar band working the local scene. As lineups and day-jobs shifted, however, Pollard moved the band towards a studio-only orientation. Guided by Voices&#x27; recording career began with a stream of self-financed, independent releases beginning with the R.E.M.-inspired E.P. &quot;Forever Since Breakfast&quot; and followed by the albums &quot;Devil Between My Toes&quot;, &quot;Sandbox&quot;, &quot;Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia&quot;, and &quot;Same Place The Fly Got Smashed&quot;. With only a few hundred copies of each album being pressed, these tended to circulate only among the band members&#x27; family and friends.

=== Lo-fi era (1992–1996) ===
With the release of the ultra-limited album &quot;Propeller&quot; in 1992 (of which only 500 copies were pressed, each with a unique, handmade cover), Guided by Voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown. This was due in part to gaining fans in the college rock circuit and bands such as Sonic Youth, R.E.M. and The Breeders. New York City and Philadelphia were host to Guided by Voices&#x27; return to the live stage (and first shows outside of Ohio) in 1993. At this time, the always-fluid Guided by Voices lineup coalesced around the core of Pollard, guitarists Tobin Sprout and Mitch Mitchell (not to be confused with Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s drummer), bassist Greg Demos, and drummer Kevin Fennell. Sprout, who was briefly featured in an early-&#x27;80s version of the band, had re-joined circa &quot;Propeller&quot; and soon became Pollard&#x27;s primary musical foil, in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band&#x27;s catalog. 1993 also saw the release of &quot;Vampire on Titus&quot;, as well as the &quot;Fast Japanese Spin Cycle&quot; and &quot;Static Airplane Jive&quot; EPs. Over the next year, the band began to receive national media exposure from sources such as &quot;Spin&quot; magazine.

In 1994, after culling both new songs and reams of archival recordings from GBV&#x27;s history, Pollard delivered the indie landmark &quot;Bee Thousand&quot; via Scat Records, with a distribution deal through indie label Matador Records. Soon, the band officially signed with Matador, concurrent with Pollard and his bandmates finally retiring from their day jobs to work in music full-time. The band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling, lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show, featuring Pollard&#x27;s homegrown rock theatrics (consisting of karate-kicks, leaps, Roger Daltrey-inspired mic-twirling, later beer can throwing at rival bands), Mitch Mitchell&#x27;s windmilling and chain smoking, sometime bassist Greg Demos&#x27; striped pants, a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds, and prodigious alcohol consumption all around.

Their true Matador debut came in 1995 with &quot;Alien Lanes&quot;, which, despite a five-figure recording allowance, was constructed out of home-recorded snippets on the cheap. The band&#x27;s underground following continued to grow, with notices coming from mainstream sources such as MTV and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. After sessions for a concept album entitled &quot;The Power of Suck&quot; were aborted, the band assembled &quot;Under the Bushes Under the Stars&quot; out of their first 24-track studio sessions, recorded with Kim Deal and Steve Albini among others, in 1996. However, the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the &quot;classic lineup&quot;, with Sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child, his painting, and his solo musical career. Sprout and Pollard marked the occasion by releasing simultaneous solo albums on the same day in 1996: Sprout&#x27;s &quot;Carnival Boy&quot; and Pollard&#x27;s &quot;Not in My Airforce&quot;, with each making a guest appearance on the other&#x27;s album. Pollard maintained an active, parallel solo and side project career alongside GBV releases for the remainder of that band&#x27;s existence.

=== Major label records (1997–2001) ===
Pollard formed a new incarnation of Guided by Voices with members of Cleveland group Cobra Verde in 1997. The following album &quot;Mag Earwhig!&quot;, combined a new hard-rocking swagger with classic lo-fi fragments and one track, &quot;Jane of the Waking Universe&quot;, that featured the classic lineup for one last time. However, after another year of rigorous touring, the &quot;Guided by Verde&quot; lineup split in late 1997 following Pollard&#x27;s announcement in an interview that he intended to work with other musicians on the next Guided by Voices project.

Cobra Verde&#x27;s Doug Gillard was tapped for yet another new Guided by Voices lineup in 1998, which also included &quot;classic&quot;-era bassist Greg Demos, former Breeders drummer Jim Macpherson, and eventually, former Amps/Breeders guitarist Nate Farley. Departing from Matador, this lineup (without Farley) worked with producer Ric Ocasek to create what was intended to be Guided by Voices&#x27; major label debut. Initially produced for Capitol Records, &quot;Do the Collapse&quot; was repeatedly delayed and finally released in mid-1999 on pseudo-indie label TVT. (In the UK it was released on Creation Records). Featuring a slick, heavily processed sound previously foreign to GBV albums, &quot;Do the Collapse&quot; failed to garner radio airplay, and was for the most part greeted with mixed reviews.

Through touring heavily throughout 1999 and 2000, Guided by Voices&#x27; live act became legendary, with shows often stretching past the three-hour mark, and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs, Pollard solo tracks, impromptu covers of The Who, David Bowie and The Rolling Stones, all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption. In addition to multiple swings through the United States and Europe, 2000 saw the band&#x27;s first and only visits to Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. 2000 was capped with the release of the massive &quot;&quot;, a four-disc, 100-song trawl through three decades worth of Pollard&#x27;s enormous reserve of unreleased material. (Three more box sets of unreleased songs, &quot;Suitcase 2&quot;, &quot;Suitcase 3&quot; and &quot;Suitcase 4&quot; released in October 2005, November 2009 and November 2015 respectively.)

2001&#x27;s &quot;Isolation Drills&quot; was recorded with Rob Schnapf, who aimed to capture the band&#x27;s live sound more closely than did Ocasek. Though the album debuted in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s top 200 and received higher critical notices than its predecessor, it did not achieve the sought-after radio breakthrough.

=== Later years (2002–2004) ===

After departing from TVT in 2002, Guided by Voices returned to Matador and released &quot;Universal Truths and Cycles&quot;, a departure from the previous two radio-aspiring albums, and a return to the band&#x27;s mid-90s, mid-fi aesthetic. &quot;Universal Truths&quot; producer Todd Tobias would also record the band&#x27;s final two albums for Matador. 2003 saw the release of the prog-styled &quot;Earthquake Glue&quot;, followed by the anthology box set &quot;Hardcore UFOs: Revelations, Epiphanies and Fast Food in the Western Hemisphere&quot; and the greatest hits compilation &quot;Best of Guided by Voices: Human Amusements at Hourly Rates&quot;.

In 2004, Pollard announced he was disbanding Guided by Voices following the release of the &quot;Half Smiles of the Decomposed&quot; LP, and a final farewell tour. Pollard stated:

:&quot;This feels like the last album for Guided by Voices. I&#x27;ve always said that when I make a record that I&#x27;m totally satisfied with as befitting a final album, then that will be it. And this is it.&quot;

On November 9, 2004, Guided by Voices performed on the stage of Austin City Limits, broadcast by PBS on January 22, 2005. Their last television appearance was on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on December 2, 2004. They played the single, &quot;Everybody Thinks I&#x27;m a Raincloud (When I&#x27;m Not Looking)&quot;. After a select round of final US shows, Guided by Voices played their final show at The Metro in Chicago on December 31, 2004. The four-hour, 63-song marathon finale is documented on the DVD &quot;The Electrifying Conclusion&quot;.

=== Post-GBV (2005–2009) ===

Pollard released his first post-GBV album in 2006 on Merge Records. The album, titled &quot;From a Compound Eye&quot; was a double LP produced by Todd Tobias. Later Pollard albums have been released on Merge and Pollard&#x27;s own label, Guided by Voices Inc. The GBV song &quot;Everyone Thinks I&#x27;m a Raincloud (When I&#x27;m Not Looking)&quot; was featured in the soundtrack for &quot;MLB 2K6&quot;.

Following GBV&#x27;s demise, Pollard was frequently asked about band reunions. In 2007 he told &quot;MAGNET&quot;: &quot;To me, it&#x27;s just cashing in. If you&#x27;re gonna get the band back together, it should be to support a new record, not just to play the hits. That&#x27;s like doing the county-fair circuit. I don&#x27;t see Guided By Voices reforming. For one thing, there were 50 or 60 people in Guided By Voices over time.&quot;

Pollard also commented on the fact that GBV and his solo output are basically the same, when he told &quot;Harp&quot; magazine, in 2005, &quot;You know, a lot of people try to distinguish things between what is Robert Pollard and what is Guided By Voices. I tell them basically that there is no difference; I am Robert Pollard and I am Guided By Voices.&quot;

In 2008, Pollard admitted to almost bringing GBV back for his album &quot;Robert Pollard Is Off to Business&quot; but decided against it, instead forming a new label titled Guided by Voices Inc.

The 1998–1999 lineup of the band reunited for a few songs, for Pollard&#x27;s 50th birthday in 2007.

In October 2008, it was announced that Guided by Voices&#x27; music would be used for a 3-D film musical based on the life of Cleopatra to be directed by Steven Soderbergh with script by James Greer.
Soderbergh and Greer would rewrite the lyrics of the songs to fit the story.
Soderbergh had previously used a Guided by Voices song in his film &quot;Full Frontal&quot;, and wrote an introduction to a book on the band.
Pollard wrote the soundtrack to Soderbergh&#x27;s film &quot;Bubble&quot;, and that music was released as &quot;Music for &#x27;Bubble&#x27;&quot;. Guided by Voices and Pollard posters, t-shirts, and songs appeared frequently on British sit-com &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;.

=== Reunion (2010–2014) ===
In June 2010, Matador Records announced that the &quot;Classic &#x27;93–&#x27;96 Lineup&quot; would reunite to perform at the label&#x27;s 21st Anniversary celebration in Las Vegas, in October of that year. A full reunion tour was subsequently announced, with the band selling out nearly every date. The tour included stops at Hoboken&#x27;s Maxwell&#x27;s and the Southgate House in Newport, Kentucky, two venues that the band had built a history with due to legendary shows there in the past. When asked by &quot;Spinner&quot; if there might ever be another proper GBV record Pollard said &quot;I&#x27;ve thought about it sometimes but it&#x27;s a very long shot,&quot; he says. &quot;We all kind of do our own thing. I&#x27;m not completely eliminating the possibility.&quot;

On September 21, 2011, it was announced that a new GBV album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Eat the Factory&quot;, had been recorded for release in January 2012.

On January 4, 2012, the band performed their single &quot;The Unsinkable Fats Domino&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; to promote &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Eat the Factory&quot;. During their performance, bassist Greg Demos fell while attempting a dance move. However, Demos was not seriously injured and the band continued to perform their song.

The band canceled what was to have been their first post-reunion show in the UK at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties &#x27;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&#x27; festival at Alexandra Palace, London, in May 2012 as well as a planned appearance at the Primavera Sound festival in Barcelona. The band&#x27;s management denied reports that the cancellations were due to them splitting up again and confirmed they were still working on new material.

The band released a second post-reformation LP, &quot;Class Clown Spots a UFO&quot;, on June 12, 2012. Generally regarded by fans as the best of the latter-years&#x27; albums, it marked a return in tenor and quality to this line-up&#x27;s mid-90s heyday. A third, &quot;The Bears for Lunch&quot;, followed in November. GBV began touring again in September 2012 with a 13 show &quot;Tour of the South&quot;, starting in Dayton, Ohio, on September 8, 2012, which included gigs in Cleveland and Pittsburgh, and stops in North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, New Orleans, Texas (Houston and Austin), Missouri and Kansas, with the final show on September 29, 2012, in St. Louis. Another album, &quot;English Little League&quot;, was released in 2013.

In a July 2013 interview with &quot;Magnet&quot; magazine, Pollard stated that &quot;English Little League&quot; could be the final GBV album. However, in September, a fifth reunion record, &quot;Motivational Jumpsuit&quot;, was confirmed for release on Guided by Voices Inc. and Fire Records in February 2014. Drummer Kevin Fennell was replaced by Kevin March for the sixth reunion album, &quot;Cool Planet&quot;, which was released on May 13, 2014.

On September 18, 2014, GBV abruptly released a statement on Facebook that they had once again disbanded. Remaining tour dates were canceled.

=== Second reunion (2016–present) ===
In February 2016, the official Guided by Voices Facebook page announced that GBV has been announced to headline the Sled Island Festival on June 25 and that a &quot;strikingly fresh Guided By Voices album in the works&quot;, on which Pollard plays all the instruments. Pollard subsequently confirmed the new lineup for the band which would include returning drummer Kevin March along with newcomers guitarist Bobby Bare Jr., guitarist Nick Mitchell and bassist Mark Shue.

After the band&#x27;s set on July 14, 2016 at the Grog Shop in Cleveland, when the band was expected to return to the stage for an encore, Nick Mitchell was fired in the dressing room next to the stage. Mitchell was replaced by former member Doug Gillard, who subsequently rejoined Guided by Voices permanently later that month.

On January 25, 2017, the band announced their first double album &quot;August by Cake&quot; for release on April 7, 2017, and released a new song, &quot;Hiking Skin.&quot; The album was also Robert Pollard&#x27;s 100th album. On March 10, the band premiered another new song from the upcoming album, &quot;Dr. Feelgood Falls Off the Ocean&quot;.

On June 22, 2017, Guided by Voices announced another new album for 2017, titled &quot;How Do You Spell Heaven&quot;, which was released on August 11. The band also released a new single from the upcoming album &quot;Just to Show You&quot;.

On December 8 of the same year, the band announced another album to be released the following March entitled &quot;Space Gun&quot;, and released the title track as a single.

In 2018, Guided by Voices announced the future release of the double album &quot;Zeppelin Over China&quot; and &quot;Warp and Woof&quot; for 2019. They also made their 7&quot; single, &quot;You Own the Night&quot; available for pre-order containing singles from both albums.

In 2019, the band released &quot;Zeppelin Over China&quot;, &quot;Warp and Woof&quot; and &quot;Sweating the Plague&quot; and in 2020 went on to release three more albums, &quot;Surrender Your Poppy Field&quot;, &quot;Mirrored Aztec&quot; and &quot;Styles We Paid For&quot;.

In 2021, the band released &quot;Earth Man Blues&quot; in April 2021, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Them. It Couldn&#x27;t Be Them. It Is Them!&quot; in October 2021, and &quot;Crystal Nuns Cathedral&quot;, which was released on March 4, 2022.

&quot;Tremblers and Goggles by Rank&quot; and the compilation &quot;Scalping the Guru&quot; rounded out 2022, followed by &quot;La La Land&quot;, &quot;Welshpool Frillies&quot;, and &quot;Nowhere to Go but Up&quot; in 2023. &quot;Strut of Kings&quot; was announced in April 2024 and released in June.

==Musical style==
Guided by Voices have been categorized as indie rock, alternative rock and lofi, with compositions that Mark Deming of AllMusic said were &quot;infectiously brief pop songs&quot;. The band&#x27;s early releases were described as &quot;amateur recordings that included audible mistakes, eclectic instrumentation, and haphazard songwriting&quot;. The band is influenced by the stylings of the British Invasion and progressive rock.

<text>Paul Jordan-Smith (April 19, 1885 – June 17, 1971) was an American Universalist minister who also worked as a writer, lecturer and editor. Academically, he is regarded as one of the foremost authorities on the 17th-century British author and scholar Robert Burton. However, he is most well known for originating the hoax art movement Disumbrationism.

==Life and ministry==

Paul Jordan Smith (his name was not hyphenated until later in life; see below) was born in Wytheville, Virginia. His father, John Wesley Smith, was a Southern Methodist minister who dreamed of starting a college and invested in land in Dade County, Georgia, outside Chattanooga, Tennessee. His wife (the former Lucy Jordan) and son joined him there in 1891, but the venture failed and the family returned to Virginia.

While a student at Emory and Henry College, Paul Jordan Smith secretly married Ethel Sloan Park in September 1904. Their daughter Lucille Isabella (Isabel Jordan) Smith was born in August 1905. He graduated from U.S. Grant University in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1906. A local Unitarian minister recommended that he study for the ministry, and although admitted to Harvard Divinity School he enrolled in the more affordable Ryder Divinity School of the Universalist Lombard College in Galesburg, where he received a bachelor of divinity degree in 1908. 

He served briefly as a minister at Universalist churches in Unionville, Missouri, and Kansas City and developed a reputation as an outstanding lecturer on science and religion. He moved to Chicago in 1910, where he worked at the Independent Religious Society and later got a job as a minister and ran a settlement house. He also enrolled part-time in graduate classes at the University of Chicago and developed a broad acquaintance among both literary and social activist circles, including lawyer Clarence Darrow, activist Emma Goldman, novelist John Cowper Powys, editor and publisher Margaret Anderson, writer Floyd Dell, Chicago Little Theatre founder Maurice Browne, and bookseller George Millard. In the process, he became a passionate book collector and decided on a career in literature. Jordan Smith also developed an interest in art through visits to the Art Institute of Chicago.

In 1913 his wife Ethel divorced him and his mother died. After a few months in the South, he traveled to Berkeley, California with letters of introduction, filled in for a minister in Eureka in the summer of 1914, and enrolled as a doctoral student and teaching fellow in the English Department at the University of California, Berkeley. He was hired as a substitute minister of the First Unitarian Church of Berkeley after Arthur Maxson Smith resigned when his wife, the heiress Sarah Bixby Smith, caught him having an affair and sued for divorce. Paul Jordan-Smith became romantically involved with Sarah, a writer, and their involvement became public, to their dismay, before the divorce was final. It was around this time that Paul assumed the hyphenated Jordan-Smith as his last name, in part to disguise his liaison with Sarah, which he feared might damage his academic career. Despite this precaution, the English Department—then headed by Charles Mills Gayley—voted not to renew his fellowship, putting an end to his plans for an academic career.

Jordan-Smith married Sarah on March 30, 1916, immediately after her divorce came through. The couple then moved with Sarah&#x27;s children to her former home in Claremont, California, which had been rented to a school for boys. In 1917, the school&#x27;s lease ended and they began renovating the house back into a private residence, which they named Erewhon after the Samuel Butler novel. Around this time, they met and subsequently became friends with one of Sarah&#x27;s cousins, the photographer Edward Weston, who made several photographic portraits of Jordan-Smith. Eventually, the couple moved to a mansion on Los Feliz Boulevard in Los Angeles, where Jordan-Smith had a detached library and writing studio on the property.

Though Jordan-Smith did not have to work (thanks to Sarah&#x27;s inherited wealth), he lectured around southern California, at women&#x27;s clubs such as the Friday Morning Club (of which Sarah was later president), at the Ebell Club, and elsewhere. He also taught courses on English and American literature at the new University of California Extension program in Los Angeles. Encouraged by some of the philanthropists who attended his talks, he took on leadership of the recently formed People&#x27;s Council of America for Peace and Democracy, an antiwar organization. The group did well until its leaders came under attack when the U.S. government began to crack down on antiwar opposition through the Espionage Act of 1917. To avoid prosecution, Jordan-Smith was obliged to give up making antiwar speeches and to swear that he did not have any German affiliations or friends.

Jordan-Smith served for a time as the educational director of the Walt Whitman School, a progressive secondary school founded in East Los Angeles in 1919.

Jordan-Smith eventually left Sarah for his cousin Dorothy and the couple divorced. He died on June 17, 1971.

Jordan-Smith had three children. His son Wilbur Jordan Smith was head of UCLA Library&#x27;s Department of Special Collections from 1951 to 1971, and Wilbur&#x27;s son Paul Jordan-Smith helped D.M. Dooling found &quot;Parabola&quot; magazine and served as its Epicycle editor.

==Literary career==

Jordan-Smith was a great admirer of the 17th-century British author and scholar Robert Burton. He co-edited the first all-English translation (having himself translated all of the Latin quotes) of Burton&#x27;s magnum opus, &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;, following it up with &quot;Bibliographica Burtoniana&quot;, which included both a study of Burton and a scholarly key to the sources Burton used in &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;. He collected books relating to Burton, and after Sarah died, he gave the core of his collection to the Claremont Colleges Library in her memory. The Robert Burton Collection, as it is called, includes copies of the first six editions of Burton&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;, a copy of the 1927 edition edited by Smith and Floyd Dell, and editions of various Renaissance Latin authors and others cited by Burton.

Jordan-Smith also wrote one of the first books on James Joyce, &quot;A Key to the Ulysses of James Joyce&quot;. He dedicated this book to Powys, who had persuaded him in 1922 to buy a then-rare and expensive first edition of &quot;Ulysses&quot; during one of Powys&#x27;s stays at Erewhon, which they then read together.

Inspired by Sarah&#x27;s ideas, Jordan-Smith collaborated with her on a feminist manifesto entitled &quot;The Soul of Woman: An Interpretation of the Philosophy of Feminism.&quot; It was published under his name in 1916.

He also served for a time in the 1940s and 1950s as the literary critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. and as such was seen on the cinema screen in 1949 introducing the trailer for the new MGM motion picture &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, under the headline &quot;Great Books Make Great Pictures.&quot;

His autobiography, &quot;The Road I Came&quot;, was published in 1960. His papers are housed in the UCLA Library Special Collections.

==Disumbrationism==

Jordan-Smith may be best known today for a hoax that he initiated in 1924, in part out of a dislike of modern art that was evident as far back as 1913, when he saw (and largely rejected) the traveling version of the notorious Armory Show at the Art Institute of Chicago. Giving himself the Russian-sounding pseudonym Pavel Jerdanowitch, Jordan-Smith painted a small group of crudely Postimpressionist canvases that he then entered in art exhibitions around the country as exemplars of a new art movement known as Disumbrationism (i.e. painting without shadows). His canvases were well received on the whole until he got tired of sustaining the role and outed himself to a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter in 1927.

<text>Annibale Carracci (; November 3, 1560 – July 15, 1609) was an Italian painter and instructor, active in Bologna and later in Rome. Along with his brother and cousin, Annibale was one of the progenitors, if not founders of a leading strand of the Baroque style, borrowing from styles from both north and south of their native city, and aspiring for a return to classical monumentality, but adding a more vital dynamism. Painters working under Annibale at the gallery of the Palazzo Farnese would be highly influential in Roman painting for decades.

==Early career==

Annibale Carracci was born in Bologna, and in all likelihood was first apprenticed within his family. In 1582, Annibale, his brother Agostino and his cousin Ludovico Carracci opened a painters&#x27; studio, initially called by some the &quot;Academy of the Desiderosi&quot; (desirous of fame and learning) and subsequently the &quot;Incamminati&quot; (progressives; literally &quot;of those opening a new way&quot;). Considered &quot;the first major art school based on life drawing&quot;, the &quot;Accademia degli Incamminati&quot; was the model for later art schools throughout Europe. While the Carraccis laid emphasis on the typically Florentine linear draftsmanship, as exemplified by Raphael and Andrea del Sarto, their interest in the glimmering colours and mistier edges of objects derived from the Venetian painters, notably the works of Venetian oil painter Titian, which Annibale and Agostino studied during their travels around Italy in 1580–81 at the behest of the elder Caracci Lodovico. This eclecticism was to become the defining trait of the artists of the Baroque Emilian or Bolognese School.

In many early Bolognese works by the Carraccis, it is difficult to distinguish the individual contributions made by each. For example, the frescoes on the story of &quot;Jason&quot; for Palazzo Fava in Bologna (c. 1583–84) are signed &quot;Carracci&quot;, which suggests that they all contributed. In 1585, Annibale completed an altarpiece of the &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot; for the church of Santi Gregorio e Siro in Bologna. In 1587, he painted the &quot;Assumption&quot; for the church of San Rocco in Reggio Emilia.

In 1587–88, Annibale is known to have had travelled to Parma and then Venice, where he joined his brother Agostino. From 1589 to 1592, the three Carracci brothers completed the frescoes on the &quot;Founding of Rome&quot; for Palazzo Magnani in Bologna. By 1593, Annibale had completed an altarpiece, &quot;Virgin on the throne with St John and St Catherine&quot;, in collaboration with Lucio Massari. His &quot;Resurrection of Christ&quot; also dates from 1593. In 1592, he painted an &quot;Assumption&quot; for the Bonasoni chapel in San Francesco. During 1593–94, all three Carraccis were working on frescoes in Palazzo Sampieri in Bologna.

==Frescoes in Palazzo Farnese==

Based on the prolific and masterful frescoes by the Carracci in Bologna, Annibale was recommended by the Duke of Parma, Ranuccio I Farnese, to his brother, the Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, who wished to decorate the piano nobile of the cavernous Roman Palazzo Farnese. In November–December 1595, Annibale and Agostino traveled to Rome to begin decorating the &quot;Camerino&quot; with stories of Hercules, appropriate since the room housed the famous Greco-Roman antique sculpture of the hypermuscular Farnese Hercules.

Annibale meanwhile developed hundreds of preparatory sketches for the major work, wherein he led a team painting frescoes on the ceiling of the grand salon with the secular &quot;quadri riportati&quot; of &quot;The Loves of the Gods&quot;, or as the biographer Giovanni Bellori described it, &quot;Human Love governed by Celestial Love&quot;. Although the ceiling is riotously rich in illusionistic elements, the narratives are framed in the restrained classicism of High Renaissance decoration, drawing inspiration from, yet more immediate and intimate, than Michelangelo&#x27;s Sistine Ceiling as well as Raphael&#x27;s Vatican Logge and Villa Farnesina frescoes. His work would later inspire the untrammelled stream of Baroque illusionism and energy that would emerge in the grand frescoes of Cortona, Lanfranco, and in later decades Andrea Pozzo and Gaulli.

Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Farnese Ceiling was considered the unrivaled masterpiece of fresco painting for its age. They were not only seen as a pattern book of heroic figure design, but also as a model of technical procedure; Annibale&#x27;s hundreds of preparatory drawings for the ceiling became a fundamental step in composing any ambitious history painting.

==Contrast with Caravaggio==
The 17th-century critic Giovanni Bellori, in his survey entitled &quot;Idea&quot;, praised Carracci as the paragon of Italian painters, who had fostered a &quot;renaissance&quot; of the great tradition of Raphael and Michelangelo. On the other hand, while admitting Caravaggio&#x27;s talents as a painter, Bellori deplored his over-naturalistic style, if not his turbulent morals and persona. He thus viewed the &quot;Caravaggisti&quot; styles with the same gloomy dismay. Painters were urged to depict the Platonic ideal of beauty, not Roman street-walkers. Yet Carracci and Caravaggio patrons and pupils did not all fall into irreconcilable camps. Contemporary patrons, such as Marquess Vincenzo Giustiniani, found both applied showed excellence in &quot;maniera&quot; and &quot;modeling&quot;.

By the 21st century, observers had warmed to the rebel myth of Caravaggio, and often ignored the profound influence on art that Carracci had. Caravaggio almost never worked in fresco, regarded as the test of a great painter&#x27;s mettle. On the other hand, Carracci&#x27;s best works are in fresco. Thus the somber canvases of Caravaggio, with benighted backgrounds, are suited to the contemplative altars, and not to well-lit walls or ceilings such as this one in the Farnese. Wittkower was surprised that a Farnese cardinal surrounded himself with frescoes of libidinous themes, indicative of a &quot;considerable relaxation of counter-reformatory morality&quot;. This thematic choice suggests Carracci may have been more rebellious relative to the often-solemn religious passion of Caravaggio&#x27;s canvases. Wittkower states Carracci&#x27;s &quot;frescoes convey the impression of a tremendous joie de vivre, a new blossoming of vitality and of an energy long repressed&quot;.

In the 21st century, most connoisseurs making the pilgrimage to the Cerasi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo would ignore Carracci&#x27;s &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot; altarpiece (1600–1601) and focus on the flanking Caravaggio works. It is instructive to compare Carracci&#x27;s &quot;Assumption&quot; with Caravaggio&#x27;s &quot;Death of the Virgin&quot;. Among early contemporaries, Carracci was an innovator. He re-enlivened Michelangelo&#x27;s visual fresco vocabulary, and posited a muscular and vivaciously brilliant pictorial landscape, which had been becoming progressively crippled into a Mannerist tangle. While Michelangelo could bend and contort the body into all the possible perspectives, Carracci in the Farnese frescoes had shown how it could dance. The &quot;ceiling&quot;-frontiers, the wide expanses of walls to be frescoed would, for the next decades, be thronged by the monumental brilliance of the Carracci followers, and not Caravaggio&#x27;s followers.

In the century following his death, to a lesser extent than Bernini and Cortona, Carracci and baroque art in general came under criticism from neoclassic critics such as Winckelmann and even later from the prudish John Ruskin, as well as admirers of Caravaggio. Carracci in part was spared opprobrium because he was seen as an emulator of the highly admired Raphael, and in the Farnese frescoes, attentive to the proper themes such as those of antique mythology.

==Landscapes, genre art and drawings==
On July 8, 1595, Annibale completed the painting of &quot;Saint Roch Giving Alms&quot;, now in Dresden Gemäldegalerie. Other significant late works painted by Carracci in Rome include &quot;Domine quo vadis?&quot; (c. 1602), which reveals a striking economy in figure composition and a force and precision of gesture that influenced on Poussin and through him, the language of gesture in painting.

Carracci was remarkably eclectic in thematic, painting landscapes, genre scenes, and portraits, including a series of autoportraits across the ages. He was one of the first Italian painters to paint a canvas wherein landscape took priority over figures, such as his masterful &quot;The Flight into Egypt&quot;; this is a genre in which he was followed by Domenichino (his favorite pupil) and Claude Lorrain.

Carracci&#x27;s art also had a less formal side that comes out in his caricatures (he is generally credited with inventing the form) and in his early genre paintings, which are remarkable for their lively observation and free handling and his painting of &quot;The Beaneater&quot;. He is described by biographers as inattentive to dress, obsessed with work: his self-portraits (such as that in Parma) vary in his depiction.

==Under a melancholic humor==

It is not clear how much work Annibale completed after finishing the major gallery in the Palazzo Farnese. In 1606, Annibale signed a &quot;Madonna of the bowl&quot;. However, in a letter from April 1606, Cardinal Odoardo Farnese bemoaned that a &quot;heavy melancholic humor&quot; prevented Annibale from painting for him. Throughout 1607, Annibale was unable to complete a commission for the Duke of Modena of a &quot;Nativity&quot;. There is a note from 1608, where in Annibale stipulates to a pupil that he will spend at least two hours a day in his studio. There is little documentation from the man or time to explain why his brush was stilled.

In 1609, Annibale died and was buried, according to his wish, near Raphael in the Pantheon of Rome. It is a measure of his achievement that artists as diverse as Bernini, Poussin, and Rubens praised his work. Many of his assistants or pupils in projects at the Palazzo Farnese and Herrera Chapel would become among the pre-eminent artists of the next decades, including Domenichino, Francesco Albani, Giovanni Lanfranco, Domenico Viola, Guido Reni, Sisto Badalocchio, and others.

==Paintings==

The tradition of Italian Renaissance painting and the mature Renaissance artists like Raphael, Michelangelo, Correggio, Titian and Veronese are all painters who had a considerable influence on the work of the Carracci, in his use of colours. Carraci laid the foundations for the birth of Baroque painting. The preceding sterile Mannerist style had its recovery now in the Baroque painting in the early sixteenth century, succeeding in an original synthesis of the many schools. The paintings of Annibale are inspired by the Venetian pictorial taste and especially the paintings of Paolo Veronese. The work that show traces of it are the &quot;Madonna Enthroned with Saint Matthew&quot;, a work made for Reggio Emilia and now in the Gemäldegalerie, Dresden, and the &quot;Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine of Alexandria&quot; (ca. 1575), now preserved at the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia in Venice.

<doc id="175803" wikidata="Q233677" url="?curid=175803" title="Xanthippe">
<text>Xanthippe (; ; fl. 5th–4th century BCE) was an ancient Athenian, the wife of Socrates and mother of their three sons: Lamprocles, Sophroniscus, and Menexenus. She was likely much younger than Socrates, perhaps by as much as 40 years. In Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, she is described by Antisthenes as &quot;the most difficult, harshest, painful, ill-tempered&quot; wife; this characterisation of Xanthippe has influenced all subsequent portrayals of her.

==Life==
Little is known about the life of Xanthippe. The ancient sources that mention her do so primarily to illustrate something about the character of Socrates, rather than provide any biographical information about Xanthippe. She was probably born around 440 BCE, making her around 30 years younger than Socrates, who was born . Xanthippe&#x27;s father may have been called Lamprocles, and Socrates and Xanthippe&#x27;s eldest son been named after him; this may have been the Lamprocles mentioned by Aristophanes in the &quot;Clouds&quot;, who was a well-known musician in fifth-century Athens.

Xanthippe and Socrates apparently married after 423 BCE, as in Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Clouds&quot;, first produced in that year, Socrates seems to be unmarried. She bore Lamprocles around 415 or 414 BCE. She may have been the mother of Socrates&#x27; other two children, Sophroniscus and Menexenus. Athenaeus and Diogenes Laertius both report versions of a story that Socrates married twice, once to Xanthippe and once to Myrto, the daughter or granddaughter of Aristides the Just. This story has generally not been believed by modern scholars, though some have accepted it – for instance J. W. Fitton, who argues that Myrto was Socrates&#x27; wife whereas Xanthippe was a citizen (&quot;concubine&quot;).

On the basis of her name (a compound of , &quot;horse&quot;, which often indicated a noble background) and the fact that her eldest son was, contrary to the usual Athenian practice, not named after Socrates&#x27; father, some scholars have suggested that she was from an aristocratic family. Fitton however notes that non-aristocratic Athenians with &quot;hippos&quot; names are known, and argues that though Xanthippe was an Athenian citizen she was not from an especially aristocratic family.

==Character==
Xanthippe is mentioned only once by Plato, in the &quot;Phaedo&quot;, depicted sitting by Socrates on the night before his execution. There is no evidence in Plato&#x27;s portrayal of the shrewish Xanthippe of later tradition. The characterisation of Xanthippe as a difficult wife derives from Xenophon&#x27;s depiction of her: in the &quot;Memorabilia&quot;, though she is not named her son Lamprocles complains of her harshness, and in Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, Antisthenes describes her as &quot;the most difficult, harshest, painful, ill-tempered&quot; wife. Socrates says that he chose her precisely because of her argumentative spirit:

It is the example of the rider who wishes to become an expert horseman: &quot;None of your soft-mouthed, docile animals for me,&quot; he says; &quot;the horse for me to own must show some spirit&quot; in the belief, no doubt, if he can manage such an animal, it will be easy enough to deal with every other horse besides. And that is just my case. I wish to deal with human beings, to associate with man in general; hence my choice of wife. I know full well, that if I can tolerate her spirit, I can with ease attach myself to every human being else.

Later ancient authors, such as Diogenes Laertius, largely follow Xenophon&#x27;s characterisation of her as a difficult wife. Several of the anecdotes reported by Diogenes serve to show Socrates&#x27; wit, and to contrast his temperament with that of his wife. In one story told by several ancient sources, Xanthippe pours a jug of water over Socrates&#x27; head; according to Diogenes he responded with the quip &quot;Did I not say that thundering Xanthippe also makes water?&quot;

==Legacy==
Medieval authors who mention Xanthippe largely repeat the ancient anecdotes about her, and follow the example of Xenophon and Diogenes Laertius in portraying her as a difficult wife. In the Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale, for example, Geoffrey Chaucer retells Diogenes&#x27; story of Xanthippe pouring a water-jug over Socrates&#x27; head, though in his version the jug is filled with urine. This story has also historically been popular with visual artists. The first positive portrayal of Xanthippe comes from the 1405 Book of the City of Ladies by Christine de Pizan: her version of Xanthippe attempts to save Socrates from death by taking the poison from him.

This portrayal of Xanthippe continued into the early-modern period. William Shakespeare, for instance, cites her as a proverbially bad wife in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. During the Enlightenment, some followed in the tradition of a shrewish Xanthippe – such as Pieter Langendijk in his &quot;Xantippe, of het booze wyf des filozoofs Sokrates beteugeld&quot;. Others, however, began to treat her more sympathetically: the German scholar Christoph August Heumann was the first to question the historicity of the negative ancient anecdotes about her.

From the 19th century, feminist authors have also portrayed Xanthippe sympathetically: for instance in the Victorian poet Amy Levy&#x27;s poem &quot;Xanthippe: A Fragment&quot;. Some feminist portrayals of Xanthippe present her traditional assertiveness as a positive characteristic: in Cynthia Ozick&#x27;s &quot;Puttermesser and Xanthippe&quot; the golem Xanthippe chooses that name in recognition of her own independence from her creator, as &quot;Xanthippe alone had the courage to gainsay Socrates&quot;. In modern feminist thought, Xanthippe has been taken as emblematic of the history of women&#x27;s subjugation.

In his essay &quot;The Case for Xanthippe&quot; (1960), Robert Graves suggested that the stereotype of Xanthippe as a misguided shrew is emblematic of an ancient struggle between masculinity (rationality, philosophy) and femininity (intuition, poetry), and that the rise of philosophy in Socrates&#x27; time has led to rationality and scientific pursuit coming to exercise an unreasonable dominance over human life and culture.

==In popular culture==
*Xanthippe has a fairly important role in Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s 1951 play &quot;Barefoot in Athens&quot;. In the 1966 Hallmark Hall of Fame television production, she was played by Geraldine Page opposite Peter Ustinov as Socrates.
*A fictional account of Xanthippe&#x27;s relationship with her husband is presented in the play &quot;Xanthippe&quot; by the British author and playwright Deborah Freeman. &quot;Xanthippe&quot; was first produced at the Brockley Jack Theatre, London, in 1999.
*Xanthippe plays a minor role in the 2018 videogame &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Odyssey&quot;, in which Socrates states that her argumentative nature is what attracted him to her, rather than her looks.

==Honours==
Asteroid 156 Xanthippe is named in her honour.

In 1995, P. Naskrecki and R.K. Colwell gave the patronym &quot;Xanthippe&quot; to a genus of flower mite that inhabits flowers of palms of the genus &quot;Socratea&quot; and is probably phoretic on the beetles that pollinate the palm.

A species of African white-toothed shrew was described by Wilfred Hudson Osgood in 1910 as &quot;Crocidura xantippe,&quot; common name &quot;Xanthippe&#x27;s shrew.&quot;

<doc id="175804" wikidata="Q310400" url="?curid=175804" title="Gerald Durrell">
<text>Gerald Malcolm Durrell OBE (7 January 1925 – 30 January 1995) was a British naturalist, writer, zookeeper, conservationist, and television presenter. He was born in Jamshedpur in British India, and moved to England when his father died in 1928. In 1935 the family moved to Corfu, and stayed there for four years, before the outbreak of World War II forced them to return to the UK. In 1946 he received an inheritance from his father&#x27;s will that he used to fund animal-collecting trips to the British Cameroons and British Guiana. He married Jacquie Rasen in 1951; they had very little money, and she persuaded him to write an account of his first trip to the Cameroons. The result, titled &quot;The Overloaded Ark&quot;, sold well, and he began writing accounts of his other trips. An expedition to Argentina and Paraguay followed in 1953, and three years later he published &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot;, which became a bestseller.

In the late 1950s Durrell decided to found his own zoo. He finally found a suitable site on the island of Jersey, and leased the property in late 1959. He envisaged the Jersey Zoo as an institution for the study of animals and for captive breeding, rather than a showcase for the public. In 1963 control of the zoo was turned over to the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust. The zoo repeatedly came close to bankruptcy over the next few years, and Durrell raised money for it by his writing and by fundraising appeals. To guarantee the zoo&#x27;s future, Durrell launched a successful appeal in 1970 for funds to purchase the property.

Durrell was an alcoholic. In 1976 he separated from his wife; they were divorced in 1979, and Durrell remarried, to Lee McGeorge, an American zoologist. He and Lee made several television documentaries in the 1980s, including &quot;Durrell in Russia&quot; and &quot;Ark on the Move&quot;. They co-authored &quot;The Amateur Naturalist&quot;, which was intended for amateurs who wanted to know more about the natural history of the world around them, though it also had sections about each of the world&#x27;s major ecosystems. This book became his most successful, selling well over a million copies; a television series was made from it.

Durrell became an OBE in 1982. In 1984 he founded the Durrell Conservation Academy, to train conservationists in captive breeding. The institution has been very influential: its thousands of graduates included a director of London Zoo, an organisation which was once opposed to Durrell&#x27;s work. He was diagnosed with liver cancer and cirrhosis in 1994, and received a liver transplant, but died the following January. He was cremated, and his ashes were buried at Jersey Zoo.
== Early life and education ==

Durrell was born in Jamshedpur, British India, on 7 January 1925. His father, Lawrence Samuel Durrell, was a civil engineer; his mother was Louisa Florence Durrell (). He had two older brothers, Lawrence and Leslie, and an older sister, Margaret. Another sister, Margery, had died in infancy. His parents were both born in India: his mother&#x27;s family were Irish Protestants from Cork, and his father&#x27;s father, who was from Suffolk, had come to India and married an Anglo-Irish woman. Durrell&#x27;s father insisted that Louisa leave household chores and parenting duties to the Indian servants, as was expected of Anglo-Indian women of the day, but she was more independent than he wished. She spent much time with her cook, learning to make curries, and had trained as a nurse. It was usual for Anglo-Indian parents to see little of their children, and the household included an &quot;ayah&quot; (an Indian nursemaid) who helped raise the children, and a Catholic governess.

When Durrell was fourteen months old, the family left Jamshedpur and sailed to Britain, where his father bought a house in Dulwich, in south London, near where both the older boys were at school. They returned to India in late 1926 or early 1927, settling in Lahore, where Lawrence had contract work. It was in Lahore that Gerald&#x27;s fascination with animals began, first when he saw two large slugs entwined in a ditch, and later when he visited the zoo in Lahore. He was entranced by the zoo, later recalling &quot;The zoo was in fact very tiny and the cages minuscule and probably never cleaned out, and certainly if I saw the zoo today I would be the first to have it closed down, but as a child it was a magic place. Having been there once, nothing could keep me away.&quot; The Durrells also briefly owned a pair of Himalayan bear cubs, given to them by Louisa&#x27;s brother John, a hunter. Louisa soon decided they were too dangerous, and gave them to the zoo.

Durrell&#x27;s father fell ill in early 1928, and died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 16 April. Louisa was devastated by his death, but Gerald was scarcely affected, having been much closer to his mother and his &quot;ayah&quot; than his father, who had often been absent as his work had taken him all over British India. Louisa considered keeping the family in India, but finally decided to move back to the UK, and they sailed back from Bombay. The house in Dulwich that Lawrence had bought in 1926 was large and expensive to run, and in 1930 Louisa moved the family to a flat attached to the Queen&#x27;s Hotel in Upper Norwood, also in south London. Early the following year they moved to Parkstone, near Bournemouth. Louisa was lonely with just Gerald for company; the other three children were at school or studying elsewhere. Durrell later recalled that she began &quot;resorting to the bottle more and more frequently&quot; and eventually had &quot;what in those days was called a &#x27;nervous breakdown. He was left alone in the house except for a governess, brought in until Louisa returned, at which point he was sent to a kindergarten nearby instead. He enjoyed his time there, particularly because one of the teachers encouraged his interest in natural history, bringing in an aquarium with goldfish and pond snails.

In 1932 Louisa moved them again, to a smaller house in Bournemouth, and the following year she enrolled him at Wychwood School. Gerald loathed the school; the only lessons he enjoyed were in natural history. He would scream and struggle to avoid going. When he was nine he was spanked by his headmaster, and his mother took him away from the school. She bought him a dog, which he named Roger, as compensation for his traumatic time there. He never received any further formal education, though he intermittently had tutors.

=== Corfu ===
Gerald&#x27;s brother Lawrence and his partner, Nancy, were living with friends of theirs, George and Pam Wilkinson, in 1934. At the end of the year, the Wilkinsons emigrated to the Greek island of Corfu, and Lawrence and Nancy moved in with Louisa and Gerald. George wrote to Lawrence about Corfu in glowing terms, and first Lawrence and then the rest of the family took up the idea of moving there. Gerald and Lawrence later gave varying accounts of how the decision was reached: the poor English climate, Louisa&#x27;s growing dependence on alcohol, and financial problems may all have played a part. Michael Haag, in his account of the Durrells&#x27; time in Corfu, suggests that Louisa&#x27;s drinking was the reason Lawrence felt he could not move to Corfu unless Louisa did also. Lawrence and Nancy left England on 2 March 1935, and the rest of the family followed five days later, reaching Corfu later that month.

Lawrence and Nancy moved into a house in , near the Wilkinsons, and the rest of the family stayed in the Pension Suisse in Corfu town for a few days, house-hunting. They met Spiro Chalikiopoulos, who found them a villa near Lawrence and Nancy, and became a close family friend. Gerald fell in love with Corfu as soon as they moved out of the town, and spent his days exploring, with a butterfly net and empty matchboxes in which to bring home his finds. Louisa soon decided he needed to continue his education, and hired George to tutor him in the mornings, but Gerald was a poor student.

George was friends with Theodore Stephanides, a polymathic Greek–British doctor and scientist, whom he introduced to Gerald. Stephanides spent a half-day every week with Gerald, walking in the countryside and talking to him about natural history, among many other topics. He was enormously influential on Gerald, and helped to encourage and systematise Gerald&#x27;s love of the natural world. Gerald collected animals of all kinds, keeping them in the villa in whatever containers he could find, sometimes causing an uproar in the family when they discovered water snakes in the bath or scorpions in matchboxes. Stephanides&#x27;s daughter, Alexia, who was a little younger than Gerald, became his closest friend, and the families of each hoped that the two would one day marry.

In late 1935 the family moved to a villa near Kontokali, not far north of Corfu town. Gerald&#x27;s education continued to be haphazard, with tutors who were unable to interest him. Lawrence encouraged Gerald to read widely, giving him an eclectic selection of books, from the unexpurgated version of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; to Darwin. Among the books were Jean-Henri Fabre&#x27;s &quot;Insect Life&quot; and &quot;The Life and Love of the Insects&quot;, which Gerald found entrancing; naturalists such as Fabre, Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace and Gilbert White became his heroes. Equally influential was a copy of &quot;Wide World&quot;, an adventure magazine, which Leslie lent him: it contained an account of an animal-collecting expedition to the Cameroons, in west Africa, led by Percy Sladen, and gave Gerald the ambition of someday doing the same. Leslie and Lawrence each owned boats, and Gerald was given a small rowing boat as a birthday present. It was christened the &quot;Bootle-Bumtrinket&quot;, and Gerald added trips along the coast to his excursions through the countryside.

Late in 1937 the family moved again, this time to a villa overlooking Halikiopoulou Lagoon that had been built as a residence for the British governor of the Ionian Islands. Stephanides left the island for a job in Cyprus in early 1938, though his wife and daughter stayed in Corfu, and Margaret returned to England the following year. In mid-1939, with war looking increasingly likely, Louisa was warned by her London bank that if she did not return to England she would have no access to her funds if hostilities broke out. Louisa, Leslie, Gerald, and Maria Condos, the family&#x27;s maid, left Corfu for England in June. Margaret briefly returned; Lawrence and Nancy waited to leave until after war was declared, and Margaret finally left after Christmas.

== War years and Whipsnade ==
Louisa established the family in a Kensington flat, and began looking for a house for them. While they were in London, Gerald took his first job, as an assistant at a pet shop near the flat, and impressed the owner with his knowledge of animals. Louisa moved the family back to Bournemouth by early 1940, and there she made one more attempt to get Gerald an education. A visit to a local public school was not a success, so another tutor was hired: Harold Binns, a veteran of World War I. Binns taught Gerald to appreciate poetry and gave him a love of the English language and good writing, and also showed him how to make use of his local public library. Gerald spent the next two years exploring the countryside around Bournemouth and reading books from the library, supplementing these with purchases when he could afford to do so.

Durrell&#x27;s call-up for the war came in late 1942, but he was exempted from military duty on medical grounds. His exemption letter told him that his options were to work in a munitions factory or find work on a farm; he chose the latter, but instead worked at a riding school at Longham, near Bournemouth, having persuaded the owner to tell the authorities he was doing farmwork if asked. He spent the rest of the war mucking out and grooming the horses, giving riding lessons, and occasionally having brief affairs with women he was teaching to ride.

After the war in Europe ended in May 1945, Durrell decided that if he were ever to achieve his dream of owning a zoo, he had to gain more experience working with animals. He applied to the Zoological Society of London, and was invited to the zoo to meet the superintendent, Geoffrey Vevers. At the interview, Durrell &quot;prattled on interminably about animals, animal collecting and my own zoo&quot;, as Durrell later put it, and Vevers wrote to him a few weeks later offering him a position as a student keeper at Whipsnade Zoo. He began work there on 30 July. He was transferred periodically between areas of the zoo, and spent much of his time cleaning the animals&#x27; cages, but occasionally had more interesting tasks, such as helping to hand-rear four newborn Père David&#x27;s deer. The work could be dangerous: he was asked at one point to separate an African buffalo calf from its mother, and on another occasion to cage an aggressive brindled gnu, and broke some bones in his hand during one of these tasks. Durrell continued his reading while at Whipsnade, now concentrating on learning more about zoos. The extinctions of animals such as the dodo, the passenger pigeon and the quagga appalled him, and he realised that most zoos considered their role to be as exhibitors of animals, and did not think of themselves as scientific institutions which might help address the problems of endangered species. He was also disappointed by the weak scientific knowledge of Whipsnade&#x27;s staff. Some of the keepers knew less than they claimed about their animals, and were often unwilling to pass on what they did know. An exception was another newly hired keeper, Ken Smith, who was responsible for the Père David&#x27;s deer. Smith and Durrell established a friendship that lasted long after Durrell left Whipsnade. Durrell had good friends among the female keepers, and some romances, including one woman whom he took to Bournemouth to meet his family a couple of times.

On Durrell&#x27;s twenty-first birthday, in January 1946, he inherited £3,000 (equivalent to £ in ) that had been set aside for him in his father&#x27;s will. His long-term goal was to collect animals and start a zoo, and he wrote letters to animal collectors, offering to pay his own expenses if he could join their expeditions. All turned him down because of his lack of experience. Eventually he decided to use his inheritance to fund an expedition of his own, which would give him the experience he needed to be hired by the established collectors. He left Whipsnade in May and returned to Bournemouth to plan his first expedition.

== Early expeditions ==

=== Cameroons 1947–1948: Bakebe, Mamfe and Eshobi ===

Durrell planned to visit the British Cameroons in West Africa. He teamed up with John Yealland, an ornithologist with some collecting experience, and several British zoos expressed interest in seeing whatever they were able to bring back. The planning took over a year, and during that time Durrell met and fell in love with a woman in London that he refers to in his writings only as &quot;Juliet&quot;. Durrell considered marrying her, but she ended the affair after a couple of years.
Durrell and Yealland left from Liverpool on 14 December 1947. The ship broke down three times, but eventually reached the coast of the Cameroons at about the turn of the year. The two men stayed in Victoria, on the coast, buying supplies, planning trips to the interior, and learning Cameroonian pidgin. In early January they stopped in Bakebe for three days, acquiring a hairy frog and a baby drill, among other creatures, and then went on to Mamfe, where they spent a week. In mid-January Yealland returned to Bakebe to establish a base, and Durrell went on to Eshobi, with people carrying his equipment as there was nothing resembling a road. He spent months there, collecting hundreds of animals, and the return to Mamfe required him to hire sixty people to carry them all, with Durrell suffering from sandfly fever during the trip. He rested at Bakebe for a few days to recover, and while he was there a hunter brought in an angwantibo, one of the animals Durrell was keenest to obtain, as he knew London Zoo were looking to acquire them. Cecil Webb, a well-established animal collector, arrived in the Cameroons intending to catch angwantibos shortly afterwards; he considered Durrell and Yealland to be inexperienced and amateurish, and Durrell was delighted to be able to tell him when they met that the angwantibo was prospering. Durrell gave Webb a chimpanzee, named Cholmondely, to take back to London Zoo.

In July, as they began making arrangements to return, Durrell realised they did not have enough money. He wired home for a loan; Leslie&#x27;s girlfriend, Doris Hall, sent £250 (equivalent to £ in ) immediately. Durrell came down with malaria just before the return home. He was told by a doctor that he would die if he insisted on travelling to the coast and boarding the ship, rather than resting. Durrell ignored the advice, and sailed from Tiko with the animals on 25 July, recovering on the voyage. They arrived in Liverpool on 10 August, with nearly two hundred animals, which were dispersed to various English zoos.

=== Cameroons 1949: Mamfe, Eshobi and Bafut ===
The expedition had been successful but not profitable; it had absorbed half of Durrell&#x27;s inheritance of £3,000. British zoos would pay £1000 (equivalent to £ in ) for a gorilla, a hippo, or an elephant, and Durrell planned a second trip which would target these larger animals. Herbert Whitley, the owner of a private zoo, promised to buy at least half of whatever animals Durrell brought back. Yealland was not available for another expedition, but Ken Smith agreed to join Durrell, and the two made plans to return to the Cameroons, this time intending to go further north, into the grasslands of the central Cameroons. They left from Liverpool in early January 1949, arriving in mid-February, and reached Mamfe on 20 February. There they set up a base camp, and Durrell went to Eshobi again, where he was greeted warmly by the villagers, who had profited handsomely by selling him the animals they captured during his first expedition. The villagers quickly acquired first one and eventually dozens of flying squirrels for Durrell, one of the species he was keenest to obtain. These proved to be difficult to keep in captivity as they were fussy eaters, and only four remained alive by the time Durrell returned to the coast in August.In mid-March they went north to Bafut, where the Fon (the local ruler) had agreed to rent them a house in his compound. On arrival Durrell met with the Fon, explaining what animals he was seeking, and drawing sketches of them. On advice from the district officer (the local British colonial administrator) Durrell had brought a bottle of Irish whiskey, and the two men drank it over the course of the evening. Durrell and the Fon became firm friends, and often drank together in the evenings. The Fon&#x27;s influence meant that there was a constant stream of hunters coming to the house with animals for Durrell, augmenting what Durrell was obtaining from the hunts he himself went on. Acquisitions included a great cane rat, pygmy dormice, hyraxes, pouched rats, an Allen&#x27;s galago, skinks, a Nile monitor, sunbirds, and a golden cat. Hunters frequently brought snakes, and Durrell was bitten by a burrowing viper, requiring an emergency trip to Bemenda, forty miles away, for antiserum.

They again ran out of money, and had to wire home for a loan (again arranged via Leslie), though they hoped that selling the collection in England on their return would at least recoup their expenditures. They knew that obtaining one of the high-value animals would resolve their financial problems, so Durrell canoed downriver to Asagem, where there was a hippo herd. It was considered impossible to capture a hippo calf without killing the parents, as hippos are very dangerous animals, so Durrell shot both the bull and cow. A crocodile killed the hippo calf almost immediately, before it could be captured. Durrell did not have a permit to kill any further hippos, and was deeply distressed by having had to kill two animals at all, let alone in a failed attempt to obtain their calf. A promise of a young gorilla persuaded Durrell and Smith to stay in Mamfe past their intended departure date, but it never appeared. Durrell was forced to sell equipment, including guns, to raise money, and eventually they left Tiko in early August. Most of the animals survived the journey, but the last flying squirrel died just one day from docking at Liverpool on 25 August.

Despite the failure to obtain the more valuable animals, the expedition had brought back several species never previously seen in Britain, including a hairy frog, and had turned a small profit. Reporters from most of the British papers came on board the ship to interview them when they docked at Liverpool, and Durrell told them that he and Smith had already begun planning another trip, this time to South America.

=== British Guiana 1950 ===
In January 1950 Smith and Durrell arrived in British Guiana. Smith stayed in Georgetown, the capital, while Durrell made collecting trips—to Adventure, a town near the mouth of the Essequibo river; along the seashore to catch freshwater wildlife in the creeks; and to a ranch on the Rupununi savannah. The collection grew to include paradoxical frogs, margays, fer-de-lance, armadillos, macaws, tree porcupines, and anacondas. Again money ran short, and Durrell returned to Britain in April to sell some of the animals so he could wire the profits to Smith.

== Early 1950s expeditions and books ==
In 1949 Durrell had met Jacquie Wolfenden, the nineteen-year-old daughter of the proprietors of a hotel in Manchester where he stayed while doing business with Belle Vue Zoo. He returned to the hotel in May 1950, since the animals from the trip to British Guiana were housed nearby. Jacquie was initially unenthusiastic about his presence, despite an enjoyable dinner date they had shared the previous year. A visit to the animal collection changed her mind, as she recalled in her 1967 book, &quot;Beasts in My Bed&quot;: &quot;Suddenly this seemingly shallow young man became a different person... He really cared about them, and they, in a funny way, returned this love and interest with obvious trust... I just sat on a box and watched him... He had certainly forgotten that I was there, and concentrated his entire attention on the animals. The whole thing fascinated me.&quot;

Once the animals had all been sold, Durrell went back to Bournemouth, but wrote frequent letters and telegrams to her. Jacquie&#x27;s father objected to the relationship, since Durrell appeared to have no money and no prospects. In addition, Durrell was fond of whisky: alcohol had killed Jacquie&#x27;s paternal grandfather. Durrell visited Manchester again to talk to Jacquie&#x27;s father, and to her surprise the meeting was amicable, with Durrell receiving permission to see more of Jacquie. Jacquie continued to spend time with Durrell, partly, she later said, to annoy her father, but she soon found herself deeply emotionally involved with Durrell.

The expedition to British Guiana had left Durrell with only about £200 (equivalent to £ in ). He had to get a job, but the only jobs he was suited for were in zoos, and his chances of obtaining one were damaged by George Cansdale, the superintendent of London Zoo. Cansdale deeply disliked Durrell: Jacquie later said it was because Cansdale regarded himself as the main expert on West African animals and was offended at Gerald intruding on what he regarded as his territory. Durrell had also criticised London Zoo for its policy of showcasing as many animals as possible, rather than prioritising scientific research. Cansdale sent a letter to British zoos criticising Durrell&#x27;s animal care and competence. After multiple unsuccessful job applications, Durrell finally took a short-term post at Belle Vue Zoo in late 1950, staying at Jacquie&#x27;s parents&#x27; hotel. When Jacquie reached 21, in 1950, she was free to marry without her parents&#x27; permission. After months of indecision, she agreed to the marriage, and the two eloped in February 1951, marrying on 26 February in Bournemouth. Her family never forgave her, and she never saw any of them again.

=== Radio talks and first books ===
The Durrells began their marriage in a tiny flat in the house owned by Durrell&#x27;s sister Margaret, in Bournemouth. They had almost no money; Durrell applied for jobs but found nothing in the UK, except a short-term position at a seaside menagerie in Margate. Jacquie joined him there and began &quot;learning about animal keeping the hard way&quot;, as she later described it in her reminiscences, helping to feed and care for the animals. Jacquie considered Gerald a marvellous storyteller, and tried to persuade him to write down some of his stories to make money, but he resisted. Lawrence visited in May 1951, and agreed with Jacquie, offering to introduce Gerald to his own publisher, Faber &amp; Faber. Gerald still demurred, and then came down with a recurrence of malaria: Jacquie later recalled that when the doctor advised a light, high-fluid diet, she had to ask if bread and tea would suffice as that was all they could afford. Jacquie continued to pressure him after he recovered. Finally, after complaining about a radio talk on West Africa, she pointed out that he could do better and should try. Within a few days Gerald borrowed a typewriter and produced a script for a short talk about his hunt for the hairy frog in the Cameroons.

Late that year they heard from the BBC that the script had been accepted, and on 9 December 1951 Durrell read the talk live on the Home Service. The fee was fifteen guineas (equivalent to £ in ), and Durrell produced more fifteen-minute talks but had also now decided that it might be worth writing a book. Louisa gave him an allowance of £3 per week (equivalent to £ in ) to sustain him and Jacquie while he worked. Durrell decided to write an account of his first trip to the Cameroons, and quickly realised that he did not want to simply relate the events of the trip chronologically; he wanted to make the animals central characters, and to make the book entertaining and humorous rather than simply factual. The completed typescript, titled &quot;The Overloaded Ark&quot;, was posted to Faber &amp; Faber with a covering letter mentioning that Gerald was Lawrence&#x27;s brother. Durrell continued to apply for jobs while waiting for a response, but without success. Faber &amp; Faber responded after six weeks, asking Durrell to visit them in London to discuss the book. He let them know that he could not afford the train fare, and they wrote again offering £25 (equivalent to £ in ), and another £25 on publication. Durrell accepted.

Lawrence had advised Gerald not to bother with an agent, but Gerald felt an agent would have obtained a higher payment from Faber &amp; Faber, and contacted Spencer Curtis Brown, Lawrence&#x27;s own agent, in late 1952. Curtis Brown read a galley proof of &quot;The Overloaded Ark&quot; and asked Durrell to come to London to meet with them, and again he had to phone them to explain that he could not afford the fare. They immediately offered to pay his expenses, and sent £120 (equivalent to £ in ). Jacquie later commented that &quot;[this] was the first time that anyone had given us concrete evidence of their faith in Gerry&#x27;s abilities&quot;. Gerald and Jacquie both visited Curtis Brown, who offered to try to sell the American rights. Shortly after the Durrells returned to Bournemouth they received a telegram saying the rights had been sold for £500 (equivalent to £ in ).

Durrell soon began work on a book about the expedition to British Guiana, titled &quot;Three Singles to Adventure&quot;. It was completed in only six weeks, and sold to Rupert Hart-Davis, a London publisher. After a short break Durrell began on a third book, &quot;The Bafut Beagles&quot;, about his second trip to the Cameroons. &quot;The Overloaded Ark&quot; was published on 31 July 1953, to favourable reviews in both Britain and the US. The only exceptions were a couple of reviewers from the animal business in the UK, who considered the book lightweight, and no competition for Cecil Webb&#x27;s autobiography. The book&#x27;s dialogue used pidgin and one or two reviews suggested that this could be seen as offensive. Some reviews questioned whether zoos, and animal collecting, were ethical. Durrell himself was strongly critical of how zoos were run at the time, but kept his views out of his early books.

=== South America ===
The money Durrell was earning from writing enabled him to plan another expedition. Jacquie chose the destination as she had never left Europe: she picked Argentina, and in subsequent planning this was expanded to included a visit to Paraguay. A secretary, Sophie Cook, was hired to help with preparations, all made from the tiny flat in Margaret&#x27;s house in Bournemouth. The Durrells left Tilbury by ship in November 1953: they had been promised a pleasant trip out by their travel agents, which they were looking forward to as a substitute for the honeymoon they had not had, but in the event the accommodations were cramped and unpleasant, the boat filthy, and the food appalled them.

They arrived in Buenos Aires on 19 December 1953, and met with Bebita Ferreyra, a friend of Lawrence&#x27;s whom he had given them an introduction to; they came to rely on Ferreyra&#x27;s assistance with the innumerable miscellaneous problems they had to resolve in Buenos Aires. They soon discovered there were no flights available to Tierra del Fuego, which they had planned to visit, and went instead to the Pampas, beginning their collecting with burrowing owls, Guira cuckoos, and a baby southern screamer. From the Pampas they headed to Puerto Casado in Paraguay, on the Paraguay River, and from there went on to the Chaco. They acquired a baby giant anteater, a dourocouli, a crab-eating raccoon, and a grey pampas fox, among many other animals, but in May, as they were making plans for the thousand-mile journey back to Buenos Aires, they discovered there had been a coup d&#x27;état in Asunción, the Paraguayan capital. They were advised to leave immediately, and had to arrange a light plane to take them back to Buenos Aires, which meant most of the animals had to be left behind.

The Durrells arrived in London in July, and the few animals they had been able to bring with them were quickly placed with zoos, but the money from &quot;The Overloaded Ark&quot; had been spent on the expedition with little return. &quot;Three Singles to Adventure&quot; had been published while they were in South America: the reviews were mostly positive, but Cansdale, who had been annoyed by criticism of London Zoo in &quot;The Overloaded Ark&quot;, wrote a scornful review in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, describing the book as superficial, hastily written, and uninformative, and Durrell as an incompetent who was lucky to have survived the expedition.

=== &quot;The Drunken Forest&quot; and &quot;The New Noah&quot; ===
To bring in more money, Durrell wrote an account of the South American trip, titled &quot;The Drunken Forest&quot;, and as soon as that was turned in to the publisher he began a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The New Noah&quot;. This was a compilation of anecdotes from the various expeditions of the previous ten years. Durrell disliked writing: Jacquie and Sophie &quot;cajoled and bullied&quot; him, in the words of his biographer, during the writing of &quot;The Drunken Forest&quot;, and when it looked as though he would never finish &quot;The New Noah&quot; they began writing a final chapter for it, prompting Durrell to return to the book and complete it.

&quot;The Bafut Beagles&quot; was released on 15 October 1954, and it was made Book of the Month by World Books, a book club; this guaranteed substantial sales, and Hart-Davis celebrated with a dinner in Durrell&#x27;s honour at the Savoy hotel. In November Durrell gave a sold-out lecture at the Royal Festival Hall, illustrating the talk with &quot;ex tempore&quot; cartoon drawings, and showing film of the capture of an anaconda from the Guiana trip. Reviews for &quot;The Bafut Beagles&quot; were ecstatic, and it became a best-seller and the first printing rapidly sold out. It was widely considered Durrell&#x27;s best book to date. Some reviewers commented that the book was not suitable for all audiences; there were plenty of references to the animal&#x27;s lavatory and sexual habits, and to drinking alcohol. The review in &quot;The Spectator&quot; commented that there were no moral judgements about animal collecting, or about colonialism: &quot;He attempts no explanations ...he passes no moral judgements; he is absorbed wholly in particulars... [he has] no recipes for the future of the dark continent&quot;.

In 1955 Gerald and Jacquie visited Lawrence in Cyprus for two months, planning to make two films for television; Gerald had considered Cyprus as a possible location for the zoo he wanted to establish one day. While they were in Nicosia a terrorist campaign against the British by Greek separatists began, with bombs exploding all over the city. The plans for a zoo and the films were abandoned, though the Durrells did make a film about a Cypriot village while they were there. In June, Gerald and Jacquie returned to the UK and rented a flat in Woodside Park, in north London. Durrell developed jaundice, and while ill he decided to write a book about his childhood in Corfu.

=== &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; ===
Durrell had given a talk in 1952 called &quot;My Island Tutors&quot;, in which he had described four of the tutors he had had on Corfu, but had made no other use of his pre-war memories. He planned the book meticulously: there would be three parts, one for each of the villas, and he decided to constantly switch between the three main themes of the book—the landscape, the inhabitants and animals, and his family&#x27;s eccentricities—to prevent a reader from becoming bored with any one of the topics. He planned the order in which every character (human and animal) would be introduced. When he began to recover from the jaundice, he returned to Bournemouth, and began to write, producing 120,000 words in just six weeks. Curtis Brown and Rupert Hart-Davis were delighted with the manuscript, and assured him it would be a bestseller.

Durrell was exhausted by the time the book was completed, and went with Jacquie to the Scilly Isles for two weeks to relax and recover. His family read the manuscript, and were &quot;more bemused than amused&quot;, in the words of Durrell&#x27;s biographer. Durrell had taken liberties with chronology, but claimed that every incident in the book was completely true, though Margaret and Louisa thought otherwise. Louisa commented that &quot;The awful thing about Gerald&#x27;s book is that I&#x27;m beginning to believe it is all true, when it isn&#x27;t.&quot; Lawrence disagreed, saying that it was a &quot;rather truthful book—the best argument I know for keeping thirteen-year-olds at boarding-schools and not letting them hang about the house listening in to conversations of their elders and betters&quot;. There were, however, some obvious changes that Gerald had made: for example, he had portrayed Lawrence as staying with the rest of the family, instead of living elsewhere with Nancy, who was not even mentioned in the book. &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; was published in October 1956—the title had been suggested by Curtis Brown&#x27;s son-in-law—and drew enthusiastic reviews describing it as &quot;bewitching&quot;, &quot;joyous&quot;, and &quot;uproarious&quot;. It immediately became a bestseller, going into a third printing before it had even been published.

== Late 1950s and Jersey Zoo ==
Late in 1955 Durrell began planning another collecting expedition. He had accepted that the expeditions could never be profitable in themselves, but he knew they would provide material for the books which were his source of income. He also hoped to make a film of the expedition. He settled on returning to the Cameroons, and to Bafut in particular, since he could be sure of cooperation from the Fon and the local hunters. Durrell also began lobbying Bournemouth town council to establish a zoo there, which he would manage, but received little encouragement.

In late December 1956 the Durrells boarded the SS &quot;Tortugeiro&quot; in Southampton, accompanied by Sophie Cook and Robert Golding, a young naturalist. The British government officials in the Cameroons were hostile and uncooperative: they considered Durrell had portrayed the Fon in &quot;The Bafut Beagles&quot; as &quot;a carousing black clown who spoke comic pidgin English&quot;, in Jacquie&#x27;s words, and the Durrells had trouble getting their equipment through customs. Eventually they reached Mamfe, and discovered that it would be impossible to collect any gorillas—aside from the difficulty of getting a licence, there were so few gorillas left in the area that Durrell decided it would be wrong to capture one. They did obtain permission to film them, but Durrell became ill, both physically and mentally. He had to be hospitalised because of injuries to his feet, and he became depressed and started drinking heavily.

Jacquie suggested to Gerald that instead of selling the animals they were collecting, they should keep the collection and &quot;use it to blackmail the Bournemouth Council into giving us a suitable zoo site in the town&quot;, and Durrell agreed. He remained depressed at the changes in the Cameroons since he had first visited, even when they finally reached Bafut and met the Fon again. Durrell continued to drink heavily. He came down with malaria; and then he and Jacquie both caught a blood disease. By May they had hundreds of animals collected, including sunbirds, cobras, eagles, Gaboon vipers, a chevrotain, and a baby chimpanzee. They left Bafut in June 1957.

The animals were established in the garden and garage of Margaret&#x27;s house in Bournemouth, with some housed at Paignton Zoo, where Ken Smith was the superintendent. Bournemouth town council was initially interested in the idea of a zoo, but eventually decided against it. The town council of Poole, near Bournemouth, offered Upton House, near Poole Harbour, as a possible site. That Christmas some of the animals were housed in a local department store, J. J. Allen, as &quot;Durrell&#x27;s Menagerie&quot;. Eventually Poole council provided a draft contract, which proved unacceptable: it would have required Durrell to commit £10,000 (equivalent to £ in ), most of which would have been spent on repairs to the property, rather than on building the zoo enclosures and services.

The film they had shot in the Cameroons was used as the basis for a three-part television series, &quot;To Bafut for Beef&quot;, in early 1958. Durrell was visibly nervous in the studio sequences, and the reviews were mixed. While Durrell had been in the Cameroons in early 1957, the BBC had broadcast a six-part series of talks by Durrell, called &quot;Encounters with Animals&quot;. It had been very popular, and the BBC commissioned another six talks, titled &quot;Animal Attitudes&quot;, which were broadcast in 1958. Durrell had not yet written a book about the most recent Cameroons trip, but was under contract to deliver a book by the end of the year. Jacquie suggested compiling the talks into a book, a much easier task than writing a new book, and the result, also titled &quot;Encounters with Animals&quot;, was turned in to Rupert Hart-Davis where it was copyedited by David Hughes, who became a family friend.

=== Argentina 1958 ===
Durrell began planning a trip to Argentina once the negotiations with Poole council collapsed. As with the Cameroons trip he planned to film the expedition. While planning it, Jacquie suggested that they try the Channel Islands as a possible location for the zoo; Durrell liked the idea, but they had no contacts there and did not follow the suggestion up. A few weeks later Rupert Hart-Davis gave them an introduction to Hugh Fraser, who owned a manor, Les Augrès, on Jersey, and the Durrells flew out to meet him. Durrell happened to mention to Fraser that Les Augrès would be a wonderful site for the zoo; he had not realised that Fraser was considering selling. By the time the Durrells left Jersey an agreement had been reached, and Durrell began negotiating with the island authorities, who proved far more cooperative than Bournemouth and Poole town councils had been. Arrangements had to be made quickly as there was less than a month to go before they left for Argentina. The lease for Les Augrès was signed on 17 October 1958, and the following day the expedition sailed from Plymouth on the &quot;English Star&quot;. Durrell hired Ken Smith as superintendent, with the intention of having Smith open the zoo while the Durrells were still in South America.

It took a month to get the expedition&#x27;s equipment through customs, but eventually they were able to drive to Patagonia, where they filmed fur seals, elephant seals, and penguins. Jacquie had been injured in a traffic accident, and had apparently recovered, but it seemed possible she had fractured her skull, and when they returned to Buenos Aires in February 1959 she took ship for England. After she had gone Durrell went to Calilegua, in Jujuy province, and brought the animals collected there back to Buenos Aires by train. These included a Geoffroy&#x27;s cat, coatis, peccaries, a puma, seriemas, and yellow-necked macaws. After another short excursion to Mendoza, in search of fairy armadillos, Durrell returned to Buenos Aires, where he met David Attenborough, who at that time was a producer for the BBC, and had been filming and collecting in Paraguay. Durrell described his plans for the zoo to Attenborough, who thought it could not succeed; Durrell assured him that he would be able to support it with the royalties from his books.

=== Jersey Zoo and the Wildlife Trust ===
The zoo in Jersey opened on 26 March 1959, and Jacquie packed up the Durrells&#x27; belongings in Bournemouth and moved them to Jersey while Gerald was still in Argentina. She met him at Tilbury Docks when his ship docked, and he travelled with the animals as they were re-embarked for Jersey. The animals arrived on 16 June. Both Durrells were surprised to find that Smith had not followed the detailed blueprint for the zoo&#x27;s layout that he had been given before the South America trip, though Smith had had to make decisions based on the resources he had available. The Durrells, along with Louisa who moved in with them, settled into Les Augrès, many of whose accommodations soon became devoted to caring for sick animals.

Durrell had still not completed the book about the third Cameroons expedition, and again Jacquie found it very difficult to get him to finish writing it. It was published in 1960 as &quot;A Zoo in My Luggage&quot; to good reviews and became one of his most popular books. The zoo of the title was operational, but in constant financial trouble: equipment was makeshift, staff were underpaid, and after a year the staff were called to a meeting and told that bankruptcy was possible. They responded with cost-saving ideas, and the zoo survived, but the financial problems persisted for years. Durrell drew no salary, and obtained a loan for £20,000 (equivalent to £ in ) as capital for the zoo, and in 1960 and 1961 took on several more writing projects to bring in money. An account of the trip to Argentina, &quot;The Whispering Land&quot;, was accompanied by two children&#x27;s books, &quot;Island Zoo&quot; and &quot;Look at Zoos&quot;, along with articles and broadcast appearances. In May 1960, in the midst of these projects, the Durrells took a six-week break on Corfu, revisiting the scenes of Gerald&#x27;s childhood, with Louisa accompanying them on the trip. Durrell was relieved to find the island much less changed than he had feared. The limited footage shot in Argentina could not support the programme series that Durrell had hoped for, but one programme was made from it in 1961, and the BBC commissioned another series, called &quot;Zoo Packet&quot;, the same summer.

In 1962 Durrell and the BBC collaborated on an expedition with the goal of a television series that focused on conservation issues. The itinerary took them to New Zealand, Australia, and finally Malaya; a planned trip to East Africa was cancelled at the last minute. On their return, they found the zoo on the verge of financial collapse. A financial manager was hired and given complete control of the budget, but more was needed. An appeal was launched, in conjunction with a plan to give control of the zoo to a trust. Donations came in, and Durrell continued writing: &quot;Menagerie Manor&quot; was an account of the first four years of the zoo&#x27;s existence, and he also worked on the scripts for &quot;Two in the Bush&quot;, the BBC series based on the 1962 trip. In July 1963, the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust was created and given ownership of the zoo; Durrell remained in control, as director of the trust.

== Late 1960s ==

=== Sierra Leone 1965 ===
In January 1964, Louisa died. Durrell was devastated. He began to drink more: he had been advised to drink Guinness to combat anaemia, and began drinking a crate a day, and gaining weight. Constant worries about the zoo&#x27;s and Trust&#x27;s finances and the pressures of the zoo&#x27;s daily management began to cause problems for the Durrells&#x27; marriage; Jacquie &quot;began to loathe the zoo&quot;, as she later recalled, and withdrew from many of the activities related to the zoo and the Trust. In 1964, after a holiday in Corfu, Durrell and the BBC arranged a trip to Sierra Leone with the BBC to film a documentary about animal collecting. Jacquie, who had not enjoyed her time in the Cameroons, refused to go, and instead went to Argentina to research a possible third collecting trip there. Durrell set sail in January 1965, and from Freetown the expedition travelled to Kenema in the interior where they set up their base. The animal collecting and filming went well, though it turned out to be particularly troublesome to catch colobus monkeys—one of the expedition&#x27;s main goals. Durrell injured his spine and broke two ribs in an incident with one of the Land Rovers, and was in pain for the rest of the trip. Jacquie came to Freetown to help him manage the trip back. The resulting series of six programmes was broadcast in early 1966 and was well reviewed: the &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot; described it as &quot;one more television classic in natural history&quot;.

Both Gerald and Jacquie now began writing: Gerald turned the television series &quot;Two in the Bush&quot; into a book of the same name, and Jacquie wrote a humorous account of her life with Gerald, titled &quot;Beasts in My Bed&quot;. Gerald followed this with his first fiction book, a story for children called &quot;The Donkey Rustlers&quot;. The Durrells spent mid-1966 in Corfu. While they were there, &quot;Two in the Bush&quot; was published in the UK, once again to positive reviews. They returned to Jersey in September, and then took a two-year lease on the Mazet, a house Lawrence owned near Nîmes in the south of France. That winter, the zoo was again in desperate financial trouble: Durrell was able to persuade the bank not to foreclose on the property, and Lord Jersey, a local aristocrat, covered the staff&#x27;s wages for a few months to tide them over to the spring. In early 1967 Durrell was featured in an episode of the BBC&#x27;s series &quot;Animal People&quot;. He turned the manuscript of &quot;Rosy is My Relative&quot;, his first novel, in to his publishers, and went to Corfu again for the summer. The BBC filmed &quot;The Garden of the Gods&quot;, a documentary about Durrell&#x27;s childhood, while they were there.

=== Mexico 1968 and Australia 1969–1970 ===

In late 1967 Durrell became interested in the volcano rabbit, which was found only near Mexico City. The rabbit was endangered, and Durrell felt this was a good example of what the Trust might be able to do: captive breeding of a species endangered in the wild, to save it from extinction. He and Jacquie sailed from Antwerp in January 1968, and after a short trip to the Guatemalan border, looking for the endangered thick-billed parrot, they returned to Mexico City. The hunt brought in five rabbits, but all were female. The expedition returned to Jersey in May, and eventually more rabbits, were found, including two males, but one died in transit to London, and the other died later at the zoo.

During the trip Durrell dictated a sequel to &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot;, titled &quot;Birds, Beasts, and Relatives&quot;, and it was published in 1969; once again the reviews were glowing. In late 1968 he and Jacquie visited Corfu again. Durrell worked on a script for a film of &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot;, the film rights to which had been acquired by Albert Finney and Michael Medwin, but the film was never made. While there, he drank even more than usual, and the stress on his marriage increased. Jacquie later told a friend, &quot;He becomes quite intolerable from the moment he sets foot on the quay, and realises it will never be what it was... That&#x27;s why I loathe Corfu—for what it does to him now.&quot; He was by turns depressed and angry. They returned to Jersey, and in early 1969, on medical advice he was admitted to The Priory, a clinic in Roehampton, for three weeks. There he was diagnosed as an alcoholic and put on a course of tranquillisers, but kept drinking, as his visitors often brought him alcohol, which the clinic did not forbid. He was still on the tranquillisers when released, and returned to Corfu in April to rest further, finally coming back to Jersey in July. Financially the news was better: film rights to Durrell&#x27;s novel &quot;Rosy is My Relative&quot; sold for £25,000 (equivalent to £ in ), which wiped out all of Durrell&#x27;s debts.

In August the Durrells left for Australia. They arranged a trip to the Great Barrier Reef, with no animal collecting planned. Although ostensibly the trip was to learn about conservation activities on the reef and in Australia, it was also intended to give Durrell a long recovery period—they travelled by sea in both directions, and were away for nine months with few obligations and no contact with the day-to-day running of the Trust and the zoo. Time spent snorkelling on the reef was followed by a trip across northern Australia, and they eventually returned home in early 1970, reaching Jersey in May. Durrell&#x27;s mental health improved over the trip and the following year: he gave up whisky and cigarettes and began practising yoga. A grand mal seizure while in France led to advice from a French doctor to limit his alcohol intake to no more than half a bottle of red wine a day; this was a dramatic reduction, but Durrell followed the advice, lost some weight, and in October Jacquie told Lawrence that &quot;all the tensions and general woes have gone and he is now like his old self&quot;.

== 1970s: divorce and remarriage ==
The lease on Les Augrès Manor, the zoo&#x27;s home, was scheduled to run out in 1984, at which point the Trust might have been forced to close down. The manor&#x27;s owner, Hugh Fraser, set the purchase price at £120,000 (equivalent to £ in ). Giles Guthrie, the Trust&#x27;s financial adviser, organised an appeal which raised £25,000, and Durrell donated another £20,000. Jersey&#x27;s parliament provided a low-interest loan for £60,000, and in April 1971 the Manor became the property of the Trust. The Durrells returned to France for the summer; they were unable to afford to buy the Mazet from Lawrence, as they had hoped, but took a five-year lease instead. Guthrie proposed a two-part fundraising plan: Saranne Calthorpe, one of the Trust&#x27;s main fundraisers, was to focus on raising £20,000 for the Trust&#x27;s ongoing operating expenses, while Durrell was to travel to the US in 1972 to ask for donations. These plans came to nothing: Durrell made it a condition of Calthorpe&#x27;s employment that she stay single, and when she married again he dismissed her; and his doctors told him he was not well enough to travel to the US.

Durrell&#x27;s &quot;Fillets of Plaice&quot;, a collection of autobiographical anecdotes, was published in late 1971 to good reviews; it was followed in early 1972 by &quot;Catch Me a Colobus&quot;, which covered the trips to Sierra Leone and Mexico, and some material about the Jersey Zoo. Reviews were mixed, but it sold well. In the spring Durrell was at the Mazet again, working on an account of his time at Whipsnade, to be titled &quot;Beasts in My Belfry&quot;.

On 30 April 1972 a new gorilla breeding complex was opened in Jersey, and the next day the first World Conference on Breeding Endangered Species in Captivity was held there. The conference was successful and generated publicity both for the Trust and the cause of captive breeding. Princess Anne, who was a fan of Durrell&#x27;s books, visited the zoo that summer, and by August had agreed to be the Trust&#x27;s patron. At the end of the year the trustees made an attempt to replace Durrell as the administrator of the zoo, since he was rarely there: they argued that the zoo and Trust needed a full-time manager who was onsite. Durrell was furious, and eventually outmanoeuvred the trustees, all (or almost all) of whom resigned. In 1973 Durrell visited the US on a three-month fundraising tour, and while there arranged the creation of the Wildlife Preservation Trust International (WPTI), an organisation intended to funnel American donations to the Trust. The following year the Durrells visited Princess Grace in Monaco, and persuaded her to act as the patron of the WPTI.

Durrell spent part of 1975 writing a treatment for a screenplay of &quot;Tarka the Otter&quot;; the film was made in 1979, with Durrell sharing screenplay credits. He had also been working on a book about the zoo, to be titled &quot;The Stationary Ark&quot;, and in May 1975 filming began in Jersey for a Canadian TV series based on the book. At the end of the year, Jacquie decided on a separation; she left Gerald, who fell into a depression and was taken to a private nursing home by a friend. After three months, Jacquie returned to Jersey to clear out her possessions and make the separation permanent. During the separation she had suggested that Gerald visit Mauritius, on a fact-finding trip, and despite the breakdown of his marriage, he left as planned in March, visiting Mauritius, Round Island, and Rodrigues, and returning to Jersey in May 1976. The divorce proceedings were protracted and bitter. Durrell continued writing: &quot;The Stationary Ark&quot; had not sold well, but his next two books, &quot;Golden Bats and Pink Pigeons&quot;, about Mauritius, and &quot;The Garden of the Gods&quot;, the third and final book about his childhood in Corfu, did better.

On another fundraising trip to the US, in 1977, he met Lee McGeorge, a zoology student working on a Ph.D. on the animals of Madagascar. He was immediately attracted to her, and courted her, mostly by letter, over the next year, before she finally agreed to marry him. The wedding was held in May 1979, shortly after Durrell&#x27;s divorce was finalised.

== 1980s and 1990s ==
In 1981 Durrell filmed &quot;Ark on the Move&quot; for Canadian television. It was a sequel to &quot;The Stationary Ark&quot;, which had been very successful. Durrell&#x27;s next project was &quot;The Amateur Naturalist&quot;, co-authored with Lee; it was a handbook for people who wanted to know how to observe nature in their own neighbourhoods and gardens, but it also covered many of the world&#x27;s ecosystem types, such as tundra, tropical forests, and wetlands. The associated television series began shooting in late 1982 and took a year to complete, and the book eventually became Durrell&#x27;s most successful, selling well over a million copies. In 1984 Durrell established the Durrell Conservation Academy at the zoo headquarters in Jersey, with the goal of providing training in captive breeding methods to help re-establish breeding populations of animals in their home environments. In October the Durrells left for the USSR, where they spent most of the next year filming &quot;Durrell in Russia&quot;. In 1986 he provided commentary for another television series, &quot;Ourselves and Other Animals&quot;, and was also the subject of a documentary, &quot;Durrell&#x27;s Ark&quot;, which aired in 1988. By the mid-1980s Durrell&#x27;s income from his writing and television work had grown to the point where he no longer had any money worries.

In 1986 Durrell had hip-replacement surgery in a bid to counter arthritis, and the following year the other hip was also replaced. In January 1994 he was diagnosed with liver cancer and cirrhosis, and given only a few months to live. In March he received a liver transplant; he drank whisky on the way to the hospital, and arrived inebriated, but the operation went ahead. He died of septicaemia on 30 January 1995. His ashes are buried in Jersey Zoo, under a memorial plaque bearing a quote by William Beebe, an early advocate for conservation:

The beauty and genius of a work of art may be reconceived, though its first material expression be destroyed; a vanishing harmony may yet again inspire the composer; but &quot;when the last individual of a race of living beings breathes no more, another heaven and another earth must pass before such a one can be again&quot;.

== Legacy and honours ==
Princess Anne, the Trust&#x27;s patron, argued after Durrell&#x27;s death that his influence on public awareness of conservation issues was his most important talent: &quot;I think his ability to write, and to transfer his enthusiasm for wild life onto the printed page for people who had never stopped to think about it before, was quite an astonishing talent in awakening people&#x27;s interest in a way that had never been done before&quot;.

Much of Durrell&#x27;s influence on the world of conservation has come through the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Jersey Zoo. The zoo was one of the earliest to make conservation a central part of its mission, and the Durrell Conservation Academy has trained thousands of people in conservation biology, captive breeding, and the role of zoos in conservation. In Durrell&#x27;s early career, London Zoo was opposed to his work; years later one of the Academy&#x27;s graduates became director of London Zoo, in &quot;a moment of triumph and vindication&quot;, in the words of the science writer Richard Conniff. The expertise in captive breeding acquired by the Trust and zoo were praised by David Attenborough in a 2009 speech: &quot;Nobody else, &quot;nobody else&quot;, has accumulated the sort of expertise in how to breed endangered species and... how to export that expertise to the countries where the endangered animal is indigenous&quot;. For Attenborough, the institution Durrell created became &quot;far more important perhaps than even Gerry realized it would be. The worldwide importance of this institution... is tremendous&quot;. The Trust, sometimes in collaboration with other organisations, has been responsible for the restoration of Round Island&#x27;s ecosystem, for breeding many species in captivity for the first time, and for projects to reintroduce animals bred in captivity to the wild.

Durrell became an OBE in 1982. Several species have been named for him, including &quot;Clarkeia durrelli&quot;, a fossil brachiopod from the Upper Silurian age, named by Gérard Laubacher and others &quot;in admiration of Gerald Durrell whose appreciation of natural history has made this a better world&quot;. Living animals named after Durrell include Durrell&#x27;s night gecko, a species of gecko native to the Mauritius archipelago and now surviving only on Round Island, named after Gerald and Lee Durrell by Edwin Nicholas Arnold and Clive G. Jones. In 2010 Durrell&#x27;s vontsira, a carnivoran species related to the brown-tailed mongoose, from Lake Alaotra, Madagascar, was named after Gerald Durrell, &quot;inspirational writer and conservationist&quot;, by Joanna Durbin and others. &quot;Espadarana durrellorum&quot;, a glassfrog of the family Centrolenidae from the eastern Andean foothills of Ecuador, was named by Diego Cisneros-Heredia in honour of Gerald and Lee Durrell &quot;for their contributions to the conservation of global biodiversity&quot;.

<text>Easter Road is a football stadium located in the Leith area of Edinburgh, Scotland, which is the home ground of Scottish Premiership club Hibernian (Hibs). The stadium currently has an all-seated capacity of , which makes it the fifth-largest football stadium in Scotland. Easter Road is also known by Hibs fans as &quot;The Holy Ground&quot; or &quot;The Leith San Siro&quot;. The venue has also been used to stage international matches, Scottish League Cup semi-finals and was briefly the home ground of the Edinburgh professional rugby union team.

Hibs first played at the present site of Easter Road in 1893. The ground holds the record attendance for a Scottish match outside Glasgow, when 65,860 attended an Edinburgh derby on 2 January 1950. The size of the terracing was greatly reduced in the 1980s. After the publication of the Taylor Report, Hibs considered leaving Easter Road and moving to a different site (Straiton, near Loanhead was mooted), but these plans were abandoned in 1994. Redevelopment of the stadium began in 1995 and was completed in 2010. The Easter Road pitch had a pronounced slope until it was removed in 2000.

==History==
===Early history (1893–1945)===
Hibernian played its first match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club first moved to the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This location had the advantage of being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.
Easter Road staged its first Scottish League match when Hibs joined the league in 1893. Hibs were only renting Easter Road, which Edinburgh city planners had designated for future development. This meant the club were unwilling to develop the ground and looked for alternatives. Hibs considered relocating to Aberdeen in 1902, a year before Aberdeen FC was formed by a merger of three local clubs. In 1909, work began on a potential new ground in the Piershill area of Edinburgh, but the North British Railway company won a court order allowing them to build a railway line over the ground. No line was ever built, but Hibs&#x27; interest in moving to the site was thwarted. The long-term future of Easter Road was only secured in 1922, when the club agreed a 25-year lease on the ground. Two years later, three banks of terraces were raised, while a main stand seating 4,480 people was built on the west side of the ground. The redeveloped stadium had a capacity of 45,000. The pitch was also moved 40 yards to the east, providing space for the main stand. The slope was reduced to approximately 6 feet as part of this work.

===Post-war (1945–1991)===
Hibs enjoyed great success in the period immediately after the end of the Second World War, winning three league championships between 1948 and 1952. The club&#x27;s participation in the (inaugural) 1955–56 European Cup meant that Easter Road became the first British ground to host European Cup football. A record attendance of 65,860 was set by an Edinburgh derby against Hearts played on 2 January 1950. This is also a record for any football match played in Edinburgh. As the fans had been tightly packed on the terraces to achieve this record attendance, the size of the East Terrace was increased further. The club even drew up plans to expand the overall capacity to nearly 100,000. This would have been done by raising each end terrace to the same height as the east side, but these plans were never realised.

Hibs were one of the first clubs to install corner floodlight pylons, rather than the roof-mounted lights used at Ibrox. The Easter Road floodlights were installed by a local company, Miller &amp; Stables, who would construct similar leaning gantries in many other Scottish grounds. They were first used for an Edinburgh derby played on 18 October 1954. A roof was put over the North Terrace in the early 1960s, but the ground was largely unchanged through the 1960s and 1970s. The capacity was reduced in 1975 to 30,000, due to the regulations of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act. Hibs became the first club in Scotland to install undersoil heating, in 1980. Benches were installed in the North Terrace in 1982, but this was only because they were cheaper than replacing the terrace crush barriers. Soon afterwards, Hibs chairman Kenny Waugh admitted that the stadium was a &quot;mess&quot;.
The height of the East Terrace was greatly reduced and a roof was erected in the mid-1980s. This work reduced the capacity to 27,000. Hibs was taken over by a consortium led by David Duff in 1987. The new regime spent approximately £1 million on executive boxes and refurbishments, but their policy of diversifying the business into property and public houses crippled the club financially when there was an economic downturn in the late 1980s. Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer attempted a takeover of Hibs in June 1990, with the intention of merging the two major Edinburgh football clubs. The Hibs fans protested against this and Mercer was prevented from gaining the 75% shareholding that was needed to close Hibs.

===Redevelopment (1991–2010)===
Sir Tom Farmer took control of Hibs in 1991, but the club was still faced with the need to develop a stadium that would meet the requirements of the Taylor Report. Hibs entered talks with Edinburgh District Council about sharing a new stadium with Hearts, but the proposed site of Ingliston was in the wrong part of the city for Hibs. The club was more interested in the possibility of playing at Meadowbank Stadium, only a few hundred yards from Easter Road, but there were planning difficulties with adapting Meadowbank into a large football stadium. The reorganisation of the club after Farmer took control meant that there was no real pressure to move, as he also owned Easter Road. The Hibs board made an assessment, however, that the ground could not be renovated in a cost-effective fashion before the August 1994 deadline set by the Taylor Report. Hibs proposed in January 1992 to sell Easter Road and move to a site owned by Farmer in Straiton. Hibs also invited Hearts to share this stadium, as their proposal for a site in Millerhill had been rejected by planners. Those plans were scaled down in 1993 when Lothian Regional Council refused to allow the rest of the Straiton site to be used for commercial development. The Hibs board continued to back the Straiton proposal and they insisted the installation of bucket seats in the uncovered South Terrace was merely to comply with the Taylor Report deadline. This measure also reduced the capacity of Easter Road to 13,500.
Later in 1994, however, the Straiton proposals were abandoned and Easter Road underwent major redevelopment in 1995. Stands behind each goal were built at a cost of £8 million, increasing the capacity to 16,531. The ground was made all seated by the installation of bucket seats in the East Terrace during 1995. Views of the pitch from this stand were somewhat restricted by supporting pillars. The Easter Road slope, which meant that the north end of the pitch was 6 feet lower than the south, was removed at the end of the 1999–00 season. The West Stand was built in 2001 to replace the ageing main stand, increasing capacity to 17,500.

Despite this development work, a move to a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site would allow them to clear their debts and reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club&#x27;s survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work.

The club first obtained planning permission to replace the East Stand in 1999, and this was renewed in 2005. Hibs started a consultation with supporters on its redevelopment in 2007. The development was put on hold until sufficient cash resources were obtained to finance the project. The consultation process found that a single tier stand would be most popular with the fans. Petrie announced at the 2009 annual general meeting that the club would enter negotiations with contractors to establish the cost of rebuilding the stand. After these negotiations were concluded, Hibs announced in February 2010 that work would immediately begin on a new East Stand, increasing capacity to . Demolition of the old stand began in early March, and the stand was opened a month ahead of schedule in August 2010.

===Recent developments (since 2020)===
Large video screens were installed into the corners between the East Stand and the two end stands in 2021. Hibs announced in January 2024 that rail seats would be put into the lower tier of the Famous Five stand, with a view to introducing safe standing from the 2024–25 season.

==Structure and facilities==
Easter Road is an all-seated stadium, split into four geographic sections, known as the Famous Five (formerly North), East, South and West stands. The Famous Five and South stands are the oldest part of the present stadium, built in 1995. Each stand has two tiers, a cantilevered roof and a capacity of nearly 4,000. To keep within the boundaries of the site, the upper deck of each stand angles toward the centre. When the stands were built, the Famous Five Stand was above pitch level and the South Stand was below, but this was corrected when the natural slope was removed. Each stand also stretched beyond the east touchline, which was corrected by widening the pitch when the East Stand was rebuilt. Between the two tiers of the Famous Five Stand there are function suites and lounges. Before the stands were rebuilt in the 1990s, the north and south ends of Easter Road were known as the Cowshed and Dunbar End respectively. The southern end was called the Dunbar End because there was a lemonade factory named Dunbar&#x27;s located behind it.

The West Stand, which initially had a capacity of 6,500, was built in 2001. A reception area, club offices, media centre, banqueting suites, hospitality area and changing rooms are located in the West Stand. The capacity of the West Stand was reduced slightly when the new East Stand was constructed in 2010, as the pitch was widened during this development. The East Stand, which is the newest part of the stadium, was built in 2010. It is the only stand that is not split into two tiers and has a capacity of 6,400. The decision to build the East Stand as a single tier was taken to maintain the character of the old terrace, which had been a simple viewing area without many facilities.

==Other uses==
===Other football matches===

Kirkcaldy club Raith Rovers used Easter Road as a home venue once, for the home leg of a UEFA Cup tie against Bayern Munich in 1995. The match was moved from Rovers&#x27; normal home ground of Stark&#x27;s Park due to Easter Road&#x27;s greater capacity. Easter Road has sometimes played host to Scottish League Cup semi-final matches, such as in the 1996, 1998, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013 and 2014 competitions. Team managers Terry Butcher and Gus MacPherson objected to playing semi-finals at Easter Road, on the grounds that their players should have the chance to play at Hampden Park, or that playing against Hearts in Edinburgh gives them a form of home advantage. The 2014 Scottish Challenge Cup Final between Raith Rovers and Rangers was hosted at Easter Road.

Scotland have played seven full international matches at Easter Road. These have been friendly matches against less attractive opposition where a relatively small crowd was expected, and it has therefore been unnecessary to play the match at Hampden Park. The Scotland under-21 team has also sometimes played matches at Easter Road, such as when Scotland played Iceland in the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs. The most recent full international played at the stadium was a friendly match between Scotland and Canada in March 2017. One full international was played at Easter Road that did not involve Scotland, a friendly match between South Korea and Ghana that was played in advance of the 2006 World Cup.

Scotland women played their first match at Easter Road in August 2019, a Euro 2021 qualifying match against Cyprus.

====Full internationals====

=====Men&#x27;s=====
Between 1988 and 2017, eight full men&#x27;s international football matches have been played at Easter Road.

=====Women&#x27;s=====
Easter Road hosted its first of two women&#x27;s international matches in August 2019.

===Other sports===

Easter Road was briefly the home ground for Edinburgh Rugby, a professional rugby union team, in the late 1990s. Heineken Cup matches against Ebbw Vale and Toulouse were played at the ground during the 1998–99 season, with attendances of a few thousand. Edinburgh again expressed interest in using Easter Road in both 2004 and 2006, but this was opposed by Hibs manager Tony Mowbray, who was concerned that playing rugby would damage the pitch. The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) included Easter Road in a bid for Edinburgh to host the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup finals in 2014. In June 2015, the SRU chief executive indicated that trial matches could be played at Easter Road with a view to Edinburgh Rugby moving there for a longer term. It has since been announced that the team will move to Myreside from January 2017.

One of the hospitality suites within the stadium staged an amateur boxing show on 15 November 2009.

===Uses other than sport===

Elton John performed Easter Road&#x27;s first rock concert on 25 June 2005. The international headquarters of the Homeless World Cup is based in the South Stand of the stadium.

==Transport==

Edinburgh Waverley, the main railway station in Edinburgh, is approximately from the stadium; the walk between the two sites takes approximately 20 minutes. An extension to the Edinburgh Trams system, which serves the stadium via the McDonald Road tram stop on Leith Walk, began operating on 7 June 2023. There was a railway halt immediately beside the ground, part of the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway, which was opened in 1950 and closed in 1967. 

Easter Road is served by several Lothian Buses routes. Services 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 22, 25 and 49 run down Leith Walk; services 1 and 35 run down Easter Road itself; services 4, 5, 15, 19, 26, 34 and 44 run along London Road and routes 34 and 49 serve Lochend Road. Several of these routes were affected by the tram construction works. East Coast Buses routes X5, X7, X24/124, 104 and 113 also serve the area. Visitors to the ground travelling by car can park in the surrounding streets.

<doc id="175811" wikidata="Q617717" url="?curid=175811" title="Soka Gakkai">
<text>is a Japanese new religion led by Minoru Harada since December 2023 based on the teachings of the 13th-century buddhist priest Nichiren. It claims the largest membership among Nichiren Buddhist groups.

It was founded by educators Makiguchi and Toda on 18 November 1930, and held its inaugural meeting in 1937. It was disbanded during the Second World War when much of the leadership was imprisoned for violations of the 1925 Peace Preservation Law and charges of lèse-majesté. After the war, its expansion was led by its former third president Daisaku Ikeda.

The organization bases its teachings on Nichiren&#x27;s interpretation of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; and places chanting Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō at the center of devotional practice. The organization promotes its goals as supporting &quot;peace, culture, and education&quot;.

In Japan, Soka Gakkai is the head of Komeito, a conservative party allied with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and founded by Daisaku Ikeda in 1964.

It heads a financial, educational and media empire, including newspapers, publishing houses, financial holdings and a network of schools.

According to its own account, Soka Gakkai has 11million members in 192 countries and territories around the world. However, this figure is not supported by any independent count. According to the work of American academic Levi McLaughlin, membership in Japan is closer to 2–3% of the country&#x27;s population, or between 2.4 and 4million people.

Moving the group toward mainstream acceptance, the organization is still viewed with suspicion in Japan and has found itself embroiled in public controversies.
Komeito, a political party closely aligned with Soka Gakkai and founded by elements of its lay membership, entered a coalition agreement with the Liberal Democratic Party in 1999 and is currently a junior partner in government. Soka Gakkai has been described as a cult.

==Beliefs==

The beliefs of Soka Gakkai center on recognizing that all life has dignity with infinite inherent potential; this immanent Buddhahood exists in every person and can be awakened through the Buddhist practice prescribed by Nichiren. Further, a person&#x27;s social actions at every moment can lead to , or the creation of value (the theory of the interdependence of life). Societal change is facilitated through &quot;human revolution&quot;, a way of living in the world that creates value.

The doctrine of Soka Gakkai derives from Nichiren, who promulgated the Lotus Sutra as he perceived its application to the epoch in which he and people today live. Soka Gakkai gives significance to Nichiren&#x27;s writings, referred to as , and refers especially to the collection of Nichiren&#x27;s writings that Nichiko Hori compiled and Jōsei Toda, published as in 1952.

T&#x27;ien-t&#x27;ai (538–597), a Chinese Buddhist scholar who upheld the Lotus Sutra, developed a theoretical system to describe the infinite interconnectedness of life translated as &quot;the principle of the mutually inclusive relationship of a single moment of life and all phenomena&quot; or &quot;three thousand realms in a single moment of life&quot; (Japanese: ). This theory demonstrates that the phenomenal world exists in a single moment. Soka Gakkai members believe that because Nichiren made actualizing this possible by inscribing and teaching the invocation, their prayers and actions can, in a single moment, pierce through limitations.

=== &quot;Life force&quot; and &quot;Human Revolution&quot; ===

Soka Gakkai teaches that this &quot;self-induced change in each individual&quot; – which Josei Toda began referring to as &quot;human revolution&quot; – is what leads to happiness and peace.

Josei Toda studied a passage from the Immeasurable Meanings Sutra (considered the introduction to the Lotus Sutra) that describes Buddhahood by means of 34 negations – for example, that it is &quot;neither being nor non-being, this nor that, square nor round&quot;. From this, he concluded that &quot;Buddha&quot; is life or life force.

Toda considered the concept of &quot;Buddha as life (force)&quot; means that Buddhism entails transforming society. Ikeda has been quoted as saying, &quot;Faith is firm belief in the universe and the life force. Only a person of firm faith can lead a good and vigorous life[...] Buddhist doctrine is a philosophy that has human life as its ultimate object, and our Human Revolution movement is an act of reform aimed at opening up the inner universe, the creative life force within each individual, and leading to human freedom.&quot;

The concept of life force is central to the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s conception of the role of religion and the application of Nichiren&#x27;s teachings. Ikeda states that &quot;[o]ur health, courage, wisdom, joy, desire to improve, self-discipline, and so on, could all be said to depend on our life force&quot;.

=== Oneness of mentor and disciple ===

The Soka Gakkai liturgy refers to all of its first three presidents – Tsunesabura Makiguchi, Josei Toda, and Daisaku Ikeda – as &quot;the eternal mentors of &quot;. The organization&#x27;s current leader, Ikeda, is revered by members. The relationship between members and their mentors is referred to as &quot;the oneness of mentor and disciple&quot;. The mentor is to lead and thereby improve the lives of his disciples. The mentor&#x27;s actions are seen as giving disciples confidence in their own unrealized potential. The role of disciples is seen as supporting their mentor and realizing his vision using their unique abilities and circumstances.

Since the mid-1990s, the issue of the oneness of mentor and disciple has received more prominence in Soka Gakkai. There is a strong emphasis on &quot;cultivating all members[...] in discipleship&quot; through forging &quot;affective one-to-one relationships with Ikeda&quot;.

===&quot;On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land&quot;===

Nichiren wrote a treatise, &quot;On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land,&quot; in 1260 and submitted it to the regent. Soka Gakkai members believe it is one of his most important writings. In it, he claimed that the source of the natural disasters Japan faced at that time was due to the weakened spirit of its people, caused by attachments to religions that disavow the primacy of the people themselves. He called for the leaders and people to base their spiritual life on the Lotus Sutra, &quot;the correct teaching&quot;, which would, in turn, lead to &quot;the peace of the land&quot;.

=== Five &quot;Eternal Guidelines of Faith&quot; ===
In 1957, Josei Toda proclaimed three &quot;Eternal Guidelines of Faith&quot;. In 2003, Daisaku Ikeda added two more guidelines. The Five Guidelines of Faith are:

# Faith for a harmonious family;
# Faith for each person to become happy;
# Faith for surmounting obstacles;
# Faith for health and long life;
# Faith for absolute victory.

===Relation to the Lotus Sutra===
Soka Gakkai members pray to Nichiren&#x27;s (see section on Gohonzon), which &quot;embodies Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the essence of the Lotus Sutra&quot;. The includes the Sutra&#x27;s teaching that all life inherently possesses dignity when &quot;illuminated by the light of the Mystic Law&quot;., and depicts the ceremony in which bodhissatvas embrace &quot;their mission to teach and preach to suffering people the path to happiness and freedom&quot;.

Soka Gakkai&#x27;s history is closely intertwined with the study of the Lotus Sutra. Josei Toda began the postwar reconstruction by lecturing on the sutra, the study of which led to what Soka Gakkai considers his enlightenment (see &quot;Life Force and Human Revolution&quot;). After Soka Gakkai&#x27;s ex-communication by Nichiren Shōshū, Daisaku Ikeda conducted dialogue sessions on the Lotus Sutra, which resulted in the publication of a six-volume work called &quot;The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra&quot;.

=== Karma (as &quot;changing karma into mission&quot;) ===
The concept of karma is based on the law of causality. It refers to consequences created through actions, words, or thoughts.
Both early Buddhists and Hindus believed that to redress karma accumulated throughout many eons, one must be reincarnated numerous times. The concept of karma then often became a source of despair as well as a tool for Buddhist clergy to instill fear and guilt in the minds of believers. Soka Gakkai Nichiren Buddhism, however, believes that the fundamental cause for revealing the ultimate potential of life, or Buddha nature, can diminish the influence of negative karma in the present lifetime.

Ikeda explains that negative karma is subsumed in the world of Buddhahood and is purified by its power. Importantly, Soka Gakkai members believe effects are determined simultaneously with causes, though they remain latent until the right external influences bring them to fruition. Soka Gakkai Buddhism teaches that even the most stubborn karma can be overcome as one reveals one&#x27;s Buddha nature in this lifetime.

==Practices==
The practice of Soka Gakkai members is directed to &quot;oneself and others&quot;.

===Chanting===
The words Nam-myoho-renge-kyo (also called &quot;Daimoku&quot;) is the main practice of the organization, which is claimed to express the true nature of life through cause and effect. Soka Gakkai members believe that chanting releases the power of the universal life force inherent in life. For some members, chanting for material benefits is a first step toward realizing the ultimate goal of Buddhahood.

The believers of the organization chant these words reputed to change their lives, including the natural environments in which they live. Accordingly, the intended goal is to produce an internal change that serves as the motivator for external social change. Furthermore, the organization teaches that chanting cannot be divorced from action.

===Gohonzon===

The &quot;Gohonzon&quot; Soka Gakkai members enshrine in their homes and centers is a transcription by the 26th High Priest Nichikan Shonin. The central main syllabary of characters reads &quot;Namu-Myoho-Renge-Kyo&quot; (Kanji: 南 無 妙 法 蓮 華 經). The lower portion reads &quot;Nichi-Ren&quot; (Kanji: 日 蓮). On the corners are the names of the Four Heavenly Kings from Buddhist cosmology, and the remaining characters are names of Buddhist deities reputed to represent the various conditions of life.

The organization teaches that in contrast to worshipping the Buddha or Dharma as anthropomorphized personifications, Nichiren deliberately made a calligraphic mandala, rather than Buddhist statues as the central object of devotion. American author, Richard Seager explains the following:

The Soka Gakkai often uses Nichiren&#x27;s metaphor of a mirror to explain its faith in the Gohonzon. The Gohonzon &quot;reflects life&#x27;s innate enlightened nature and cause it to permeate every aspect of member&#x27;s lives&quot;. Members chant to the Gohonzon &quot;to reveal the power of their own enlightened wisdom and vow to put it to use for the good of themselves and others&quot;. The organization teaches that a member is considered to be practicing the Lotus Sutra when chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo to the Gohonzon.

===Faith, practice, and study===
The primary practice of the Soka Gakkai, like that of most Nichiren sects, is chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, which is the title of the Lotus Sutra, and simultaneously considered the Buddha nature inherent in life and the ultimate reality of existence. The supplemental practice is the daily recitation of parts of the 2nd and 16th chapters of the Lotus Sutra. Unlike other Nichiren sects, the Soka Gakkai stresses that practice for enlightenment entails actual &quot;engagement in the realities of daily life&quot;, while including the happiness of others in one&#x27;s own practice.

Believers claim that the Lotus Sutra contains principles or teachings that are not readily apparent. Furthermore, the Soka Gakkai claims that Nichiren revealed these teachings as The &quot;Three Great Secret Laws&quot; namely the following:.
# The &quot;Object of Devotion&quot; (Gohonzon mandala) used and designated by the Soka Gakkai
# The incantation (of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) by united Soka Gakkai believers
# The sanctuary or place where Buddhism is practiced.

Soka Gakkai practices Nichiren Buddhism as it has been expounded by its three founding presidents, and so also studies their speeches and writings, especially those of third President Daisaku Ikeda. His novelized histories of the movement, &quot;The Human Revolution&quot; (and its sequel &quot;The New Human Revolution&quot;) have been said to have &quot;canonical status&quot; as it &quot;functions as a source of inspiration and guidance for members&quot;. Study meetings are held monthly. &quot;The tenor of the meetings is one of open discussion rather than didactic teaching...&quot; Discussions on Nichiren&#x27;s teachings are welcomed, &quot;dictatorial edicts on moral behavior are not.&quot;

The Soka Gakkai practice also includes activities beyond the ritualistic, such as meetings, social engagement, and improving one&#x27;s circumstances; these also have significance as religious activities in the Soka Gakkai.

===Discussion meetings===
Gakkai meetings have been called &quot;formal liturgies&quot; in that their format – &quot;chanting, relatos (experiences), teachings, inspiring entertainment&quot; – is identical from place to place. Discussion meetings are among the most important activities of the Soka Gakkai.

At discussion meetings, participants are encouraged to take responsibility &quot;for their own lives and for wider social and global concerns&quot;. The format is an example of how the Soka Gakkai is able to &quot;dispense with much of the apparatus of conventional church organization&quot;.

===Proselytizing===
The Soka Gakkai&#x27;s expansion methods have been seen as controversial, as it employed a Buddhist method called &quot;shakubuku&quot;, a term employed by Nichiren, translated as &quot;break and subdue (attachments to inferior teachings).&quot;

The reason for propagation, as explained by Josei Toda, is &quot;not to make the Soka Gakkai larger but for you to become happier ... There are many people in the world who are suffering from poverty and disease. The only way to make them really happy is to shakubuku them.&quot;

In 1970 Ikeda prescribed a more moderate approach, &quot;urging its members to adopt an attitude of openness to others&quot;; the method Soka Gakkai prefers since then is called &quot;shoju&quot;– &quot;dialogue or conversation designed to persuade people rather than convert them&quot;, though this is often referred to still as &quot;shakubuku spirit&quot;.

==History==
===Foundation===
In 1928, educators Tsunesaburō Makiguchi and Jōsei Toda both converted to Nichiren Buddhism. The Soka Gakkai officially traces its foundation to November 1930, when Makiguchi and Toda published the first volume of Makiguchi&#x27;s magnum opus on educational reform, &quot;Sōka Kyōikugaku Taikei&quot; (創価教育学体系, &quot;The System of Value-Creating Pedagogy&quot;). The first general meeting of the organization, then under the name &quot;Sōka Kyōiku Gakkai&quot; (, &quot;Value Creating Educational Society&quot;), took place in 1937.
The membership eventually came to change from teachers interested in educational reform to people from all walks of life, drawn by the religious elements of Makiguchi&#x27;s beliefs in Nichiren Buddhism. The group had a focus on proselytization growing from an attendance of 60 people at its first meeting to about 300 at its next meeting in 1940.

===Repression during the war===

In 1942, a monthly magazine published by Makiguchi called &quot;Kachi Sōzō&quot; (, &quot;Creating values&quot;) was shut down by the government, after only nine issues. Makiguchi, Toda, and 19 other leaders of the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai were arrested on July 6, 1943, on charges of breaking the Peace Preservation Law and lèse-majesté: for &quot;denying the Emperor&#x27;s divinity&quot; and &quot;slandering&quot; the Ise Grand Shrine. The details of Makiguchi&#x27;s indictment and subsequent interrogation were covered in July, August, and October 1943 classified monthly bulletins of the Special Higher Police.

With its leadership decimated, the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai disbanded. During interrogation, Makiguchi had insisted that &quot;The emperor is an ordinary man ... the emperor makes mistakes like anyone else&quot;. The treatment in prison was harsh, and within a year, all but Makiguchi, Toda, and one other director had recanted and been released. On November 18, 1944, Makiguchi died of malnutrition in prison, at the age of 73.

Jōsei Toda was released from prison on July 3, 1945, after serving two years of imprisonment on the charges of lèse majesté. He immediately set out to rebuild the organization that had been repressed and dismantled by the government during the war.

===The reconstruction of the organization===
Toda officially re-established the organization, now under the shortened moniker &quot;Sōka Gakkai&quot; (&quot;Value-creation society&quot;), integrated his prison awakenings into the doctrine of the Soka Gakkai, began locating members who had dispersed during the war, started a series of lectures on the Lotus Sutra and Nichiren&#x27;s letters, undertook business ventures (largely unsuccessful) to provide a stream of revenue for the organization, provided personal encouragement to many members, launched a monthly study magazine , and the newspaper &quot;Seikyo Shimbun&quot;, launched propagation efforts, and involved the active participation of youth including Daisaku Ikeda who was to become his right-hand man and successor.

Noah Brannen, a Christian missionary writing in 1969, describes the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s study program at this point as &quot;the most amazing program of indoctrination Japan has ever seen&quot;. New members attended local study lectures, subscribed to weekly and monthly periodicals, studied Toda&#x27;s commentaries on the Lotus Sutra, took annual study examinations, and were awarded titles for their achievements such as Associate Lecturer, Lecturer, Associate Teacher, or Teacher.

====&quot;The Great Propagation Drive&quot;====

The drive began with the 1951 inauguration speech of Josei Toda when he assumed the presidency of the organization. Before 1,500 assembled members, Toda resolved to convert 750,000 families before his death. The accuracy of this figure was never confirmed by outside sources. The primary vehicle of the propagation efforts were small group discussion meetings.

There are several competing narratives that attempt to explain how the Soka Gakkai was able to achieve this rapid growth. One narrative portrays a drive powered by the &quot;seemingly unlimited enthusiasm&quot; of its members that was masterminded by Toda and channeled by his younger followers. The organization&#x27;s own publications articulate this narrative.

A second narrative examines the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s expansion through a sociological lens. White, in the first English-language sociological work on the Soka Gakkai, attributes the growth, cohesion, and sustainability of the organization to the organizational skills of its leaders, its system of values and norms that match the individual needs of members, and its ability to adapt to changing times. According to Dator, the organizational structure of the Soka Gakkai, which values individual participation within small heterogeneous groups and parallel peer associations by age, gender, and interests, fulfills members&#x27; socio-psychological needs.

A third narrative tracks criticisms of the Soka Gakkai in the popular press and by other Buddhist sects. This narrative implies that the propagation efforts succeeded through intimidating and coercive actions committed by Soka Gakkai members such as the practice then of destroying the household Shinto altars of new members. There were reports of isolated incidents of violence conducted by Soka Gakkai members but also incidents directed toward them.

Jōsei Toda was succeeded as president in 1960 by the 32-year-old Daisaku Ikeda. Ikeda urged, from 1964, a gentler approach to proselytizing. Under Ikeda&#x27;s leadership, the organization expanded rapidly, both inside and outside Japan during the 1960s.

Soka Gakkai&#x27;s own narratives argue that within the first 16 months of Ikeda&#x27;s presidency the organization grew from 1.3 million to 2.1 million members. By 1967 it grew to 6.2 million families according to its own reporting. By 1968, the daily &quot;Seikyo Shimbun&quot; newspaper is supposed to have attained a circulation of 3,580,000. Today, the Soka Gakkai claims it has a circulation of 5.5 million copies, but the number is controversial and impossible to verify since Seikyo Shinbun does not belong the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association nor the 日本ABC協会 who are officially in charge of the circulation numbers of Japanese newspapers.

===International growth===
In October 1960, five months after his inauguration, Ikeda and a small group of staff members visited the United States, Canada (Toronto), and Brazil. In the United States he visited Honolulu, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Washington, DC, and Los Angeles, meeting with members, the vast majority Japanese war brides, at discussion and guidance meetings, setting up local organizations, and appointing leaders to take responsibility.

Ikeda also expanded the scope and pattern of the Gakkai&#x27;s activities. In 1961 he created an arm of the organization, the Culture Bureau, to accommodate nonreligious activities. It had departments for the study and discussion of Economics, Politics, Education, Speech, and, later in the year, the Arts.

Ikeda and his team visited countries in Europe and Southeast Asia in 1961 and the Near and Middle East in 1962. By 1967 Ikeda had completed 13 trips abroad to strengthen the overseas organizations.

The Gakkai&#x27;s first overseas mission, called Nichiren Shoshu of America (NSA), grew rapidly and claimed some 200,000 American adherents by 1970. Ikeda founded Soka Junior and Senior High Schools in 1968 and Soka University in 1971. Soka Gakkai International (SGI) was formally founded in 1975, on Guam.

===Founding of the Komeito===
In 1961 Soka Gakkai formed the Komei Political League. Seven of its candidates were elected to the House of Councillors. In 1964 the Komeito (Clean Government Party) was formed by Ikeda. Over the course of several elections it became the third largest political party, typically amassing 10–15% of the popular vote. The New Komeito Party was founded in 1998 and has been allied with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) since 1999.

In 2014 the New Komeito was renamed Komeito again. Komeito generally supports the policy agenda of the LDP, including the reinterpretation of the pacifist Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan, proposed in 2014 by LDP Prime Minister Shinzō Abe to allow &quot;collective defense&quot; and to fight in foreign conflicts.

===1969: Crisis and transformation===
In response to criticism, Ikeda made major shifts to the Gakkai&#x27;s message. He committed the organization to the rights of free speech and freedom of religion, admitting it had been intolerant and overly sensitive in the past.

In the 1970s Ikeda helped transition the Soka Gakkai from an internally focused organization centered on its own membership growth to one adopting a focus on a motto of &quot;Peace, Culture, and Education&quot;. On October 12, 1972, at the official opening of the Shohondo at Taiseki-ji Ikeda announced the start of the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s &quot;Phase Two&quot; which would shift direction from aggressive expansion to a movement for international peace through friendship and exchange.

===Scandals in the 1990s===
Nichiren Shōshū excommunicated the Soka Gakkai and the Soka Gakkai International (SGI) on 28 November 1991 due to doctrinal conflicts and the reputation of the Soka Gakkai, at that time entangled in political and financial scandals.

In 1991, the Soka Gakkai had to pay $4.5 million in back taxes on 2.4 billion yen (US$1.7 million) of undeclared income.

==Former relations with the Nichiren Shoshu sect==
Generally speaking, Soka Gakkai and Nichiren Shōshū worked in harmony before 1990, although there have been moments of tension. An early example of strained relations came during World War II, in 1943, when the Nichiren sect&#x27;s headquarters at Taiseki-ji was willing to comply with Japanese government demands to enshrine a Shinto talisman of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu inside the temple. Makiguchi and Toda, on the other hand, angrily rebuked Taiseki-ji for doing so, and the two were jailed for refusing to do the same (Makiguchi would also die while in prison).

Nikken Abe excommunicated Soka Gakkai and its senior leaders in November 1991, citing doctrinal deviations, the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s usurpation of rites such as the Higan-e equinox ceremonies and funerals without Nichiren Shoshu priests officiating, its defiant staging of Ode to Joy concerts that, for their Christian themes, were incongruent with Nichiren Shoshu doctrine, and a speech (which became public when a recording was leaked) by then Soka Gakkai President Daisaku Ikeda. It also condemned Ikeda for abandoning the aggressive propagation style (shakubuku) that led to some social criticism of the lay group, though not the priesthood. In response, the Soka Gakkai countered by outlining Nichiren Shoshu&#x27;s deviation from their own interpretation of Nichiren&#x27;s doctrines, along with accusations of simony and hedonism among its ranking priests.

The priesthood further accused the organization of impiety and sacrilegious behavior, citing the song &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; along with the promotion of its musical performance, Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, as evidence for non-Buddhist teachings.

In 2014, the Soka Gakkai rewrote its bylaws to reflect that it no longer had any relationship with Nichiren Shoshu or its doctrine.

==Outreach==
In the 1970s, the Soka Gakkai began to re-conceptualize itself as an organization promoting the theme of &quot;Peace, culture, and education.&quot; &quot;Since its beginning – and especially under Ikeda’s leadership - Soka Gakkai has struggled to relate its image to the ideal of an international organization committed to social causes&quot;, analyses scholar Suzana Ramos Coutinho Bornholdt in &quot;Japanese Buddhism and Social Action: the case of Soka Gakkai&quot;.

Ikeda also founded the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum in 1983. It houses collections of western and oriental art, and has participated in exchanges with museums around the world.

The Soka Gakkai has participated in many activities and exhibitions in conjunction with the UN. The Soka Gakkai has established multiple institutions and research facilities.

This social and cultural projects also appear to be part of a strategy, according to some scholars and critics of Soka Gakkai, which &quot;&quot;uses the image and practice of an NGO (to respond) to its own necessity: the recruitment and maintenance of membership&quot; and &quot;tries to create the image of an institution engaged in activities to promote peace, culture and education based on Buddhism, clearly following the tendencies of national politics&quot;.&quot;.

==Organization==
Formally, the Soka Gakkai International is the umbrella organization for all national organizations, while Soka Gakkai by itself refers to the Japanese arm.

The basic functional organizational unit is the Block – a group of members in a neighborhood who meet regularly for discussion, study and encouragement. A number of Blocks form a District, and Districts are grouped into Chapters. From there the Soka Gakkai is organized into Areas, Regions, Prefectures and, finally, Territories – all under the umbrella of the national organization. Discussion and study meetings, the basic organizational activities, are conducted mainly at the Block level, though there are occasional meetings held at every level.

===Membership===
Soka Gakkai International claims a total of over 12 million adherents. The majority of these belong to the Japanese organization, whose official membership count is 8.27 million households. However, this is the figure put forward by the organization itself, and is not supported by any independent count. According to the work of American academic Levi McLaughlin, membership in Japan is closer to 2-3% of the country&#x27;s population, or between 2.4 and 4 million people.

In a 1996 NHK survey, it was found that Soka Gakkai adherent made up somewhere around 3.2% of the Japanese population, or somewhere around 4 million individuals. According to statistics from the Agency for Cultural Affairs (a body of the Japanese Ministry of Education), the Japanese organization had 5.42 million individual members in 2000.

In a 2002–2003 survey of 602 Soka Gakkai adherents living in Sapporo, Hokkaido who had at least one child over the age of 18, it was found that 65.9% of those members&#x27; adult children were also themselves active members. Additionally, it was found that among the siblings of 418 second-generation members, collectively speaking, 69.5% of all those siblings were also active members. A further analysis found that &quot;higher degrees of parental religiosity, better family relationships, and higher levels of participation in youth groups&quot; contributed to higher degrees of religiosity among Soka Gakkai children during middle school years, although this effect was more pronounced in women than in men.

A study in Europe found that most of new members joined because of the personalities of the people they met within the organization; but the biggest reason for continuing is the positive changes they see in their own lives.

===List of Soka Gakkai presidents===
The following are the list of the presidents of the Soka Gakkai:

# Tsunesaburō Makiguchi – (18 November 1930 – 18 November 1944)
# Jōsei Toda – (3 May 1951 – 2 April 1958)
# Daisaku Ikeda – (3 May 1960 – 24 April 1979)
# Hiroshi Hōjō – (24 April 1979 – 18 July 1981)
# Einosuke Akiya – (18 July 1981 – 9 November 2006)
# Minoru Harada – (9 November 2006 – incumbent)

==Economic and social influence==
The Soka Gakkai is the head of a media, political and financial empire. Levi McLaughlin writes that &quot;exerts considerable influence in the fields of education, media, finance, and culture throughout Japan&quot;.

===Tax situation===
Legally declared in Japan as a religious juridical person since 1952, Soka Gakkai is not subject to taxation as an organization.

Though, it has been sued by Japanese tax authorities in 1991 for evading taxes on profits of 2.3 billion yen, which were obtained through tombstone transactions.

===Assets===
Estimates about Soka Gakkai’s financial assets are imperfect since &quot;they cannot accurately assess the full value of the Gakkai’s thousands of facilities, its stocks and other investments, its holdings overseas, or Ikeda Daisaku’s personal wealth&quot;.

According to the magazine Shûkan Daiyamondo (June 2016), the assets of the organization include fourteen corporations, investments in 331 other companies for 18 billion yens, holding overseas, and real estate holdings. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated (2004) that the organization has an income of at least $1.5 billion per year. In 2008, religion scholar Hiroshi Shimada has estimated the wealth of the Soka Gakkai at ¥500 billion.

===Press and publishing companies===
Daisaku Ikeda&#x27;s writings are the roots of a massive publishing and media enterprise. The Gakkai&#x27;s newspaper, Seikyō shinbun, has an important readership base. But it is only sold in Soka Gakkai&#x27;s venues, and mainly bought and read by Soka Gakkai&#x27;s members, though its print run is impossible to verify.

The Soka Gakkai owns publishing companies, in Japan but also abroad. They are in charge of the translation and publishing of &quot;The Human Revolution&quot;, Daisaku&#x27;s Ikeda novel (World Tribune Press in the USA ; Eternal Ganges in India ; Soka Gakkai International Publishers Group in Germany...)

==Perception==

===In Japan===
Today, Soka Gakkai is rarely criticized in mainstream news media. Since the Komeito Party joined the ruling government coalition in 1999, widespread criticism by the media of the Soka Gakkai has abated and the Soka Gakkai is gaining acceptance as part of the Japanese mainstream. There has been a &quot;fractured view&quot; of the Soka Gakkai in Japan. On the one hand, it is seen as a politically and socially engaged movement; on the other, it is still viewed with suspicion by Japanese people.

====International perception====
Soka Gakkai is considered as a cult in several countries, including France and Belgium.

In 2015, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi signed an agreement that recognizes the Soka Gakkai as a &quot;Concordat&quot; that grants the religions status in &quot;a special &#x27;club&#x27; of denominations consulted by the government in certain occasions, and, perhaps more importantly, to be partially financed by taxpayers&#x27; money.&quot; Eleven other religious denominations share this status.

==Controversies==

In 1969, prominent university professor Fujiwara Hirotatsu authored the book &quot;I Denounce Soka Gakkai (Soka Gakkai o kiru)&quot; in which he severely criticized the Gakkai. The Gakkai and Kōmeitō attempted to use their political power to suppress its publication. When Fujiwara went public with the attempted suppression, the Soka Gakkai was harshly criticized in the Japanese media.

=== Cult status ===
Soka Gakkai has been described as a cult. Particular controversies have arisen around its entry into politics with the New Komeito and an alleged cult of personality surrounding former leader Daisaku Ikeda. Seizaburo Sato, deputy director of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, described Soka Gakkai as &quot;a dictatorship built around the person of one man.&quot; Soka Gakkai members have made arson attacks and bomb threat against rival groups, as well as wiretapping the house of the Communist Party of Japan leader. Soka Gakkai have distanced themselves from these members and attributed their actions to mental illness. Rick Alan Ross, cult specialist and founder of the nonprofit Cult Education Institute, considers them a &quot;destructive cult&quot; and claims to have &quot;received serious complaints from former members and from family members.&quot;

=== Sexual assault allegation ===
In June 1996, Nobuko Nobuhira, a long-time Sokka Gakkai member, filed a 75 million yen civil suit against Ikeda, alleging that he raped her on three occasions, including at the sect&#x27;s facilities and on a street in Hokkaido. Sokka Gakkai lawyers denied these claims, calling them &quot;groundless fabrications motivated by personal resentment&quot; and alleging that Nobuhira had extorted money from Soka Gakkai members. The lawsuit was dismissed in 1996, and an appeal was denied in 2006.

* Strand, Clark: &quot;Waking the Buddha – how the most dynamic and empowering buddhist movement in history is changing our concept of religion&quot;. Strand examines how the Soka Gakkai, based on the insight that &quot;Buddha is life&quot;, has evolved a model in which religion serves the needs of its practitioners, rather than the practitioners adhering to dogma and traditions for their own sake. Middleway Press, 2014.

Argues that the Sōka Gakkai is not (or is no longer) as powerful as many of its opponents fear, and that it is losing ground internally as all but the most dedicated are turned off by the leadership and fewer members need the organization for social bonding. Also notes that it is becoming more like a civic rather than a religious organization, and that inactive members do not resign because they want to avoid the ostracism and harassment that can result.

Describes the relationship between Kōmeitō and Sōka Gakkai and the development of their history. Touches on the Sōka Gakkai–Nichiren Shōshū split, describing it as the result of a power struggle and financial constraints, as well as on the organized harassment of opponents by Sōka Gakkai members, the organization&#x27;s use of its media vehicles to vilify opponents, and Ikeda&#x27;s demand for unquestioning loyalty.

This book is an attempt to review scholarly studies of Sōka Gakkai from the 1950s to the 1970s and shifts in perceptions of the organization as journalists took over from scholars. Tamano takes the perspective of a social scientist and describes Sōka Gakkai as a socio-political phenomenon. He is also somewhat critical of some views Shimada expressed in the latter&#x27;s recent publications.

<doc id="175812" wikidata="Q938475" url="?curid=175812" title="David Brooks (commentator)">
<text>David Brooks (born August 11, 1961) is a Canadian-born American book author and political and cultural commentator. Though he describes himself as an ideologic moderate, others have characterised him as centrist, moderate conservative, or conservative, based on his record as contributor to the PBS NewsHour, and as opinion columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In addition to his shorter form writing, Brooks has authored six non-fiction books since 2000, two appearing from Simon and Schuster, and four from Random House, the latter including &quot;The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement&quot; (2011), and &quot;The Road to Character&quot; (2015). Beginning as a police reporter in Chicago and as an intern at William F. Buckley&#x27;s &quot;National Review&quot;, Brooks rose to his positions at &quot;The Times&quot;, NPR, and PBS after a long series of other journalistic positions (film critic for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, reporter and op-ed editor at &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, senior editor at &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, and contributing editor at &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;).
==Early life and education==
Brooks was born in Toronto, Ontario, where his father was working on a PhD at the University of Toronto. Along with his brother, Daniel, David spent his early years living in Stuyvesant Town housing, in New York City. Their father taught English literature at New York University, while their mother studied 19th-century British history at Columbia University. Brooks was raised Jewish, but rarely attended synagogue in adulthood. As a young child, he was enrolled in the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in the East Village. When he was 12, his family moved to the well-to-do suburbs of Philadelphia&#x27;s Main Line area, where he graduated from Radnor High School in 1979. In 1983, Brooks earned his Bachelor&#x27;s Degree, with a history major, from the University of Chicago. His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey.

As an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative William F. Buckley Jr., who was scheduled to speak at the university: &quot;In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping.&quot; To his piece, Brooks appended the note: &quot;Some would say I&#x27;m envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?&quot; When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job.

==Early career==
Upon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago, a wire service owned jointly by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot;. He says that his experience on Chicago&#x27;s crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him. In 1984, mindful of the offer he had received from Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern at Buckley&#x27;s &quot;National Review&quot;. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent lifestyle that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions, Bach concerts, dinners at Buckley&#x27;s Park Avenue apartment and villa in Stamford, Connecticut, and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.

Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. &quot;National Review&quot; was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. Sam Tanenhaus later reported in &quot;The New Republic&quot; that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn&#x27;t been for his being Jewish. &quot;If true, it would be upsetting,&quot; Brooks says.

After his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and wrote movie reviews for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;.

==Career==

In 1986, Brooks was hired by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, where he worked first as an editor of the book review section. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990 to 1994, the newspaper posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to Brussels, where he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; when it was launched in 1994. Two years later, he edited an anthology, &quot;Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.&quot;

In 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled &quot;Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There&quot; to considerable acclaim. The book, a paean to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or &quot;new upper class&quot; represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.

According to a 2010 article in &quot;New York Magazine&quot; written by Christopher Beam, &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial-page editor Gail Collins called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch.

Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist William Safire, but one who understood how liberals think. &quot;I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn&#x27;t make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window,&quot; says Collins. &quot;He was perfect.&quot; Brooks started writing in September 2003. &quot;The first six months were miserable,&quot; Brooks says. &quot;I&#x27;d never been hated on a mass scale before.&quot;One column written by Brooks in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which dismissed the conviction of Scooter Libby as being &quot;a farce&quot; and having &quot;no significance&quot;, was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.

In 2004, Brooks&#x27; book &quot;On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense&quot; was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, &quot;Bobos in Paradise&quot;, but it was not as well received as its predecessor. Brooks is also the volume editor of &quot;The Best American Essays&quot; (publication date October 2, 2012), and authored &quot;The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement&quot;. The book was excerpted in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in January 2011 and received mixed reviews upon its full publication in March of that year. It sold well and reached #3 on the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.

Brooks was a visiting professor of public policy at Duke University&#x27;s Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006. In 2013, he taught a course at Yale University on philosophical humility.

In 2012, Brooks was elected to the University of Chicago Board of Trustees. He also serves on the board of advisors for the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.

In 2019, Brooks gave a TED talk in Vancouver entitled &#x27;The Lies Our Culture Tells Us About What Matters – And a Better Way to Live&#x27;. TED curator Chris Anderson selected it as one of his favourite talks of 2019.

==Political ideology==

Ideologically, Brooks has been described as a moderate, a centrist, a conservative, and a moderate conservative. Brooks has described himself as &quot;a Burkean... [which] is to be a moderate&quot;, saying that such was &quot;what I think I’ve become. and said in a 2017 interview that &quot;[one] of [his] callings is to represent a certain moderate Republican Whig political philosophy.&quot; In December 2021, he wrote that he placed himself &quot;on the rightward edge of the leftward tendency—in the more promising soil of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party.&quot; &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; conservative commentator David Warren has identified Brooks as a &quot;sophisticated pundit&quot;; one of &quot;those Republicans who want to &#x27;engage with&#x27; the liberal agenda&quot;. When asked what he thinks of charges that he&#x27;s &quot;not a real conservative&quot; or &quot;squishy&quot;, Brooks has said that &quot;if you define conservative by support for the Republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems, I guess I don&#x27;t fit that agenda. But I do think that I&#x27;m part of a long-standing conservative tradition that has to do with Edmund Burke ... and Alexander Hamilton.&quot; In fact, Brooks read Burke&#x27;s work while he was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago and &quot;completely despised it&quot;, but &quot;gradually over the next five to seven years ... came to agree with him&quot;. Brooks claims that &quot;my visceral hatred was because he touched something I didn&#x27;t like or know about myself.&quot; In September 2012, Brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side, saying, &quot;If it&#x27;s from a loon, I don&#x27;t mind it. I get a kick out of it. If it&#x27;s Michelle Malkin attacking, I don&#x27;t mind it.&quot; With respect to whether he was &quot;the liberals&#x27; favorite conservative&quot; Brooks said he &quot;didn&#x27;t care&quot;, stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t mind liberals praising me, but when it&#x27;s the really partisan liberals, you get an avalanche of love, it&#x27;s like uhhh, I gotta rethink this.&quot;

Brooks describes himself as beginning as a liberal before, as he put it, &quot;coming to my senses.&quot; He recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate when he was selected to present the socialist point of view during a televised debate with Nobel laureate free-market economist Milton Friedman. As Brooks describes it, &quot;[It] was essentially me making a point, and he making a two-sentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point. ... That didn&#x27;t immediately turn me into a conservative, but...&quot; On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for &quot;The New York Times&quot; titled &quot;Party No. 3&quot;. The column imagined a moderate McCain-Lieberman Party in opposition to both major parties, which he perceived as both polarized and beholden to special interests.

In a March 2007 article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; titled &quot;No U-Turns&quot;, Brooks explained that the Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win elections. Alex Pareene commented that Brooks &quot;has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he can&#x27;t still think it&#x27;s going to happen soon.&quot;

=== Iraq war ===
Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued for American military intervention, echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that American and British forces would be welcomed as liberators. In 2005, Brooks wrote what columnist Jonathan Chait described as &quot;a witheringly condescending&quot; column portraying Senator Harry Reid as an &quot;unhinged conspiracy theorist because he accused the [George W. Bush] administration of falsifying its Iraq intelligence.&quot; By 2008, five years into the war, Brooks maintained that the decision to go to war was correct, but that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had botched U.S. war efforts.

In 2015, Brooks wrote that &quot;[f]rom the current vantage point, the decision to go to war was a clear misjudgment&quot; made in 2003 by President George W. Bush and the majority of Americans who supported the war, including Brooks himself. Brooks wrote &quot;many of us thought that, by taking down Saddam Hussein, we could end another evil empire, and gradually open up human development in Iraq and the Arab world. Has that happened? In 2004, I would have said yes. In 2006, I would have said no. In 2015, I say yes and no, but mostly no.&quot; Citing the Robb-Silberman report, Brooks rejected as a &quot;fable&quot; the idea that &quot;intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure, that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war.&quot; Instead, Brooks viewed the war as a product of faulty intelligence, writing that &quot;[t]he Iraq war error reminds us of the need for epistemological modesty.&quot;

=== Presidents elections and candidates ===
Brooks was long a supporter of John McCain; however, he disliked McCain&#x27;s 2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a &quot;cancer&quot; on the Republican Party, and citing her as the reason he voted for Obama in the 2008 presidential election. He has referred to Palin as a &quot;joke,&quot; unlikely ever to win the Republican nomination. But he later admitted during a C-SPAN interview that he had gone too far in his previous &quot;cancer&quot; comments about Palin, which he regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.

Brooks has frequently expressed admiration for President Barack Obama. In an August 2009 profile of Brooks, &quot;The New Republic&quot; describes his first encounter with Obama in the spring of 2005: &quot;Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don&#x27;t know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew &quot;both&quot; better than me...I remember distinctly an image of – we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I&#x27;m thinking, (a) he&#x27;s going to be president and (b) he&#x27;ll be a very good president.&quot; Brooks appreciates that Obama thinks &quot;like a writer,&quot; explaining, &quot;He&#x27;s a very writerly personality, a little aloof, exasperated. He&#x27;s calm. He&#x27;s not addicted to people.&quot; Two days after Obama&#x27;s second autobiography, &quot;The Audacity of Hope&quot;, hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, titled &quot;Run, Barack, Run,&quot; urging the Chicago politician to run for president. However, in December 2011, during a C-SPAN interview, Brooks expressed a more tempered opinion of Obama&#x27;s presidency, giving Obama only a &quot;B−&quot; and saying that Obama&#x27;s chances of re-election would be less than 50–50 if elections were held at that time. He stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s integrated himself with people in Washington as much as he should have.&quot; However, in a February 2016 &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, Brooks admitted that he missed Obama during the 2016 primary season, admiring the president&#x27;s &quot;integrity&quot; and &quot;humanity,&quot; among other characteristics.

Regarding the 2016 election, Brooks spoke in support of Hillary Clinton, applauding her ability to be &quot;competent&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; in comparison to her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump. In addition, Brooks noted that he believed Clinton would eventually be victorious in the election, as he foresaw that the general American public would become &quot;sick of&quot; Trump.

When discussing the political emergence of Trump, Brooks strongly critiqued the candidate, most notably by authoring a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed he titled &quot;No, Not Trump, Not Ever.&quot; In this piece, Brooks attacked Trump by arguing he is &quot;epically unprepared to be president&quot; and pointing out Trump&#x27;s &quot;steady obliviousness to accuracy.&quot;

On the August 9, 2019, episode of the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;, Brooks suggested Trump may be a sociopath.

=== Israel ===
Brooks has expressed admiration for Israel and has visited almost every year since 1991. He supported Israel during the 2014 Gaza War.

In writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in January 2010, Brooks described Israel as &quot;an astonishing success story&quot;. He wrote that &quot;Jews are a famously accomplished group,&quot; who, because they were &quot;forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages ... have been living off their wits ever since&quot;. In Brooks&#x27; view, &quot;Israel&#x27;s technological success is the fruition of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world.&quot;

==Social views==
Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce. His view is that &quot;sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex-saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious&quot; by &quot;waiting longer to have sex ... [and] having fewer partners&quot;. In 2007, Brooks stated that he sees the culture war as nearly over, because &quot;today&#x27;s young people ... seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right.&quot; As a result, he was optimistic about the United States&#x27; social stability, which he considered to be &quot;in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair&quot;.

As early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of same-sex marriage, pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: &quot;We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity ... It&#x27;s going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage.&quot;

In 2015, Brooks issued his commentary on poverty reform in the United States. His op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; titled &quot;The Nature of Poverty&quot; specifically followed the social uproar caused by the death of Freddie Gray, and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms, but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are &quot;matters of social psychology&quot;. When discussing Gray in particular, Brooks claimed that Gray as a young man was &quot;not on the path to upward mobility&quot;.

In 2020, Brooks wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, under the headline &quot;The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake&quot;, that &quot;recent signs suggest at least the possibility that a new family paradigm is emerging,&quot; suggesting that in the place of the &quot;collapsed&quot; nuclear one the &quot;extended&quot; family emerges, with &quot;multigenerational living arrangements&quot; that stretch even &quot;across kinship lines.&quot; Brooks had already started in 2017 a project called &quot;Weave&quot;, in order, as he described it, to &quot;support and draw attention to people and organizations around the country who are building community&quot; and to &quot;repair [America]&#x27;s social fabric, which is badly frayed by distrust, division and exclusion.&quot;

Brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion, which he thinks should be legal, but with parental consent for minors, during the first four or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely rare circumstances.

He has expressed opposition to the legalization of marijuana, stating that use of the drug causes immoral behavior. Brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident: Brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech.

==Critical reviews==

===Books===
In reviewing &quot;On Paradise Drive&quot; (2004), Michael Kinsley described Brooks&#x27; &quot;sociological method&quot; as having &quot;four components: fearless generalizing, clever coinage, jokes and shopping lists.&quot; Taking umbrage with the first of these, Kinsley states, &quot;Brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick, and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke&quot;. This followed the 2004 &quot;Philadelphia&quot; magazine fact-checking of &quot;Bobos in Paradise&quot; by Sasha Issenberg that concluded many of its comments about middle America were misleading or untrue. Kinsley reported that &quot;Brooks defend[ed] his generalizations as poetic hyperbole&quot;. Issenberg likewise noted that Brooks insisted that the book was not intended to be factual but rather to report impressions of what he believed an area to be like: &quot;He laughed&quot; that the book was &quot;&#x27;partially tongue-in-cheek&#x27;&quot;. Issenberg continues, &quot;I went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being &#x27;too pedantic,&#x27; of &#x27;taking all of this too literally,&#x27; of &#x27;taking a joke and distorting it.&#x27; &#x27;That&#x27;s totally unethical&#x27;, he said.&quot; 

In 2015, David Zweig expressed the opinion in a &quot;Salon&quot; piece that Brooks had gotten &quot;nearly every detail&quot; wrong about a poll of high school students in his recent, &quot;The Road to Character&quot;.

===Articles===
In March of 2012, Dan Abrams of ABC News, and then Brooks, were criticized by Lyle Denniston with regard to the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 2010 decision in &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;, where alongside the claim that Brooks had &quot;scrambled the actual significance of what the Supreme Court has done&quot;, he goes on to state that &quot;[t]here &quot;is&quot; a link, but it is only indirect, between the Court’s 2010 decision... and the rise of Super PACs&quot; [emphasis added]. 

Writing in response to Brooks 2015 opinion in &quot;The New York Times,&quot; &quot;The New Old Liberalism&quot;, Tom Scoca of the now-defunct &quot;Gawker&quot;, after leveling the ad hominem attack that Brooks was &quot;a dumb partisan hack&quot;, went on to argue that Brooks possibly &quot;perceived facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief&quot;, and so did not use them to support his policy positions. Annie Lowrey, responding to Brooks&#x27; opinion, &quot;The Nature of Poverty&quot;, on May 1, 2015, in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, criticized Brooks&#x27; basis for his argument for political reform, claiming he used &quot;some very tricksy, misleading math&quot;. Sean Illing of &quot;Slate&quot; criticized the same article, claiming Brooks took arguments out of context and routinely made bold &quot;half-right&quot; assumptions regarding the controversial issue of poverty reform.

In 2016, Brooks&#x27; analyzed the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Dretke v. Haley&quot;, leading James Taranto to the critique that &quot;Brooks&#x27;s treatment of this case is either deliberately deceptive or recklessly ignorant&quot;. In a self-published blog, law professor Ann Althouse argued that in the piece, Brooks &quot;distorts rather grotesquely&quot; by exaggerating the character of then-Texas solicitor general Ted Cruz (who brought the case to the high court). 

====&quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; reference====
In 2018, Brooks wrote an opinion for &quot;The New York Times&quot; on the generation gap between older and younger Democrats, attributing young Democrats&#x27; radicalism to &quot;cultural Marxism... now the lingua franca in the elite academy&quot;, for which he was criticized by Ben Alpers of the University of Oklahoma, for mainstreaming a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;—the history of which he traces in his critique—that dated to the Nazis, and had antisemitic roots. Ari Paul of FAIR likewise was critical in a review of the expression&#x27;s connotations, and its separate use by others. In a self-published blog post providing quotes of quotes of quoted material that make the exact origin of ideas problematic, Brad DeLong argues that Brooks and other&#x27;s names &quot;are attached to a pejorative which they’d prefer to be uncoupled from the anti-Semitism to which it has been usually attached&quot;, but that the offending expression is a toxic one that, as one &quot;enter[ing] national discourse as an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory... ought to be avoided on that basis alone...&quot;.

===Other media===
In 2023, Brooks was criticised online following a tweet presented as misleading that claimed an airport hamburger meal had cost $78, and that the exorbitant cost of hamburgers was the reason Americans were dissatisfied with the economy; his critics pointed out that Brooks&#x27; high restaurant bill was the result of his ordering multiple scotches along with his meal.

==Legacy==

===Sidney Awards===
In 2004, Brooks created an award to honor the year&#x27;s best political and cultural journalism. Named for philosopher Sidney Hook and originally called &quot;The Hookies&quot;, the honor was renamed &quot;The Sidney Awards&quot; in 2005. The awards are presented each December.

==Personal life==
Brooks met Jane Hughes, his first wife, while both attended the University of Chicago. She converted to Judaism and changed her given name to Sarah; they divorced in November 2013. Their eldest son volunteeered at age 23 to serve in the Israeli army in 2014, as Brooks shared in a September 2014 interview for Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot;.

Brooks converted to Christianity over a period between 2013 and 2014.

Brooks married Anne Snyder in 2017; they met while he wrote &quot;The Road to Character&quot; and she was his research assistant.

<doc id="175813" wikidata="Q7768283" url="?curid=175813" title="The Telegraph (Nashua, New Hampshire)">
<text>The Telegraph, for most of its existence known as the Nashua Telegraph, is a daily newspaper in Nashua, New Hampshire. It was founded as the &quot;Nashua Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1869, although a weekly version dates back to 1832. Through the 2000s it was the second-largest newspaper in the state in terms of daily print circulation, behind the &quot;New Hampshire Union Leader&quot; of Manchester.

In 2020 &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reduced its print run to Saturday only, when it produces a weekend edition under the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; banner. In the announcement, the paper said it will continue to report news for its website every day.

After being family-owned for a century, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; was bought in the 1980s by Independent Publications of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, which owned several smaller daily and weekly newspapers around the United States as well as some other businesses. In 2005, the paper&#x27;s owner bought the Cabinet Press, publisher of weekly newspapers based in nearby Milford, New Hampshire. In April 2013, it was bought by Ogden Newspapers of Wheeling, West Virginia.

== 1980 presidential primary debate ==
On February 23, 1980, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; received national attention during the New Hampshire presidential primary, when it hosted a Republican debate paid for by the campaign of former California Governor Ronald Reagan. During a discussion over which candidates should be allowed to participate, &quot;Telegraph&quot; editor Jon Breen (1935–2017), acting as moderator, ordered sound man Bob Molloy to shut off Reagan&#x27;s microphone, which was met with shouts of protest from the audience; Molloy refused to comply. Mispronouncing his name, Reagan rebuked Breen saying, &quot;I am paying for this microphone, Mr. Green!&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;], which was cheered by the audience and applauded by most of his fellow opponents. The phrase entered the political lexicon and the publicity helped to boost Reagan&#x27;s successful run for the presidency.

Reagan later recounted the incident as a &quot;brief and seemingly small event, one lasting only a few seconds&quot;, that he said he thought, &quot;helped take me to the White House&quot;. He continues:

Arriving at the debate, Reagan found two seats prepared, one each for himself and for Bush on either side of Breen. The other candidates were confused, as was the audience.

<text>William Cobbett (9 March 1763 – 18 June 1835) was an English pamphleteer, journalist, politician, and farmer born in Farnham, Surrey. He was one of an agrarian faction seeking to reform Parliament, abolish &quot;rotten boroughs&quot;, restrain foreign activity, and raise wages, with the goal of easing poverty among farm labourers and small land holders. Cobbett backed lower taxes, saving, reversing commons enclosures and returning to the gold standard. He opposed borough-mongers, sinecurists, bureaucratic &quot;tax-eaters&quot; and stockbrokers. His radicalism furthered the Reform Act 1832 and gained him one of two newly created seats in Parliament for the borough of Oldham. His polemics range from political reform to religion, including Catholic emancipation. His best known book is &quot;Rural Rides&quot; (1830, in print). He argued against Malthusianism, saying economic betterment could support global population growth.

==Early life (1763–1791)==

William Cobbett was born in Farnham, Surrey, on 9 March 1763, the third son of George Cobbett, a farmer and publican, and Anne Vincent. He was taught to read and write by his father and he started working from an early age. He later said: &quot;I do not remember a time when I did not earn my living. My first occupation was driving small birds from the turnip seed, and the rooks from the peas.&quot; He worked as a farm labourer at Farnham Castle, and also worked briefly as a gardener in the King&#x27;s garden at Kew. His rural upbringing gave him a lifelong love of gardening and hunting.
On 6 May 1783, he took a stage coach to London and spent eight or nine months as a clerk in the employ of a Mr. Holland at Gray&#x27;s Inn. He joined the 54th (West Norfolk) Regiment of Foot in 1783. In his spare time, he improved his knowledge of English grammar. Between 1785 and 1791, Cobbett was stationed with his regiment in New Brunswick and sailed from Gravesend in Kent to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Cobbett was in Saint John, Fredericton and elsewhere in New Brunswick until September 1791, as he was promoted through the ranks to sergeant major, the most senior rank of non-commissioned officer.

Cobbett returned to Britain with his regiment, landing at Portsmouth on 3 November 1791. He obtained his discharge from the army on 19 December 1791. In Woolwich during February 1792, he married an American-born woman, Anne Reid (1774–1848), whom he had met while stationed at Fort Howe in Saint John. Their children were Anne (1795–1877), William (1798–1878), John (1800–1877), James Paul (1803–1881), Eleanor (1805–1900), and Susan (1807–1889). Their daughter Anne Cobbett was the author of several domestic books including &quot;The English Housekeeper: The Manual of Domestic Management.&quot;

Cobbett had developed an animosity towards some officers, suspecting them of corruption, and gathered evidence on the matter while in New Brunswick. His charges against them were ignored. He wrote &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Friend&quot; in 1792, in protest against the low pay and harsh treatment of enlisted men in the British army. Sensing that he was about to be indicted in retribution, he fled from Britain to France in March 1792 to avoid imprisonment. Cobbett had intended to stay a year to learn the French language, but due to the French Revolution and French Revolutionary Wars in progress, he sailed for the United States in September 1792.

In the spring of 1793, he settled in Philadelphia, then the provisional capital of the United States. Cobbett initially prospered by teaching English to Frenchmen and translating texts from French to English. He later claimed that he had become a political writer by accident: during an English lesson one of his French students read aloud from a New York newspaper the addresses of welcome that the Democrats had sent to Joseph Priestley upon his arrival in America, along with Priestley&#x27;s replies. His student applauded the anti-British sentiments that were expressed, and he quarrelled with Cobbett, who then resolved to &quot;write and publish a pamphlet in defence of my country.&quot; His &quot;Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Priestley&quot;, which was published anonymously in 1794, was a violent attack on Priestley.

In 1795, Cobbett wrote &quot;A Bone to Gnaw for the Democrats&quot;, which attacked the pro-French Democratic Party. He replied to his critics with &quot;A Kick for a Bite&quot;, which was his first work to be published under the pseudonym &quot;Peter Porcupine&quot;; a reviewer had compared him to a porcupine, which pleased him. He took the side of the Federalists, who were led by Alexander Hamilton, because they were friendlier to Britain than were the pro-French Democrats led by Thomas Jefferson.

In January 1796, he began writing a monthly tract, &quot;The Censor&quot;. It was discontinued after eight releases, and replaced by &quot;Porcupine&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, a daily newspaper which ran from March 1797 until the end of 1799. Talleyrand, at the time a French spy in America, tried but failed to bribe Cobbett to join the French cause.

Cobbett opened a bookstore in Philadelphia in July 1796. Its shop-window displayed a large portrait of George III and its interior featured a huge painting of &quot;Lord Howe&#x27;s Decisive Victory over the French&quot;. This provocative display attracted considerable attention. He reprinted and published much of the extreme loyalist literature then current, including George Chalmers&#x27;s hostile biography of Thomas Paine, as well as his own version, reproducing Chalmer&#x27;s work interspersed with contemptuous comments.

After Spain entered into an alliance with France against Britain, Cobbett expressed his anger through further pamphleteering that was highly critical of Spanish King Charles IV, in &quot;Porcupine&#x27;s Gazette&quot;. The Spanish foreign minister in Philadelphia asked the United States government to prosecute Cobbett for libel of the Spanish king. Cobbett was arrested on 18 November 1797. He was tried in the State Court of Pennsylvania by Chief Justice Thomas McKean (who was also the Spanish minister&#x27;s father-in-law). Despite McKean&#x27;s criticism of Cobbett in his summing up, the grand jury threw out case against him by a one-vote majority.

In the &quot;Gazette&quot;, he serially denounced Benjamin Franklin Bache, publisher of the Jeffersonian paper, the &quot;Aurora.&quot; Cobbett suggested that the &quot;stubborn sans culotte&quot; should be treated &quot;as we would a TURK, a JEW, a JACOBIN or a DOG&quot;. He directed the same invective against Bache&#x27;s successor, William Duane and his growing circle of United Irish émigrés, describing them as men &quot;animated by the same infamous principles, and actuated by that same thirst for blood and plunder, which had reduced France to a vast human slaughter-house&quot;. In May 1798, he began publishing accounts of a &quot;Conspiracy, Formed by the United Irishmen, With the Evident Intention of Aiding the Tyrants of France In Subverting the Government of the United States.&quot; Convening in Philadelphia&#x27;s African Free School, and admitting, together with &quot;all those who have suffered in the cause of freedom&quot;, free blacks, the Irish republicans had formed a society dedicated to the proposition (to which each member attested) that &quot;a free form of government, and uncontrouled [sic] opinion on all subjects, [are] the common rights of all the human species&quot;. Against the backdrop of America&#x27;s Quasi War with French and of the Haitian Revolution (then still under the flag of the French Republic), for Cobbett, this was sufficient proof of an intention to organise slave revolts and &quot;thus involve the whole country in rebellion and bloodshed&quot;.

Cobbett also campaigned against physician and abolitionist Benjamin Rush, whose advocacy of bleeding during the yellow fever epidemic may have caused many deaths. Rush won a libel suit against Cobbett. Cobbett never fully paid the $8,000 judgement, but instead fled to New York and during 1800 via Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Falmouth, Cornwall.

The British government was grateful to Cobbett for supporting Britain&#x27;s interests in America: the Duke of Kent hailed him as &quot;this great British patriot&quot;; the British representative in America, Robert Liston, offered him a &quot;great pecuniary reward&quot; (which he turned down), and the Secretary at War, William Windham, said that Cobbett deserved a statue of gold for the services he had rendered to Britain in America.

==Return to England and &quot;The Political Register&quot; (1800–1810)==
Cobbett&#x27;s American writings were reprinted in Britain, with John Wright acting as his agent. In August 1800, Windham invited Cobbett to dinner with the Prime Minister, William Pitt, and contributors to the &quot;Anti-Jacobin&quot;, including George Canning. Pitt&#x27;s government offered Cobbett the editorship of a government newspaper, but he chose to remain independent. His own paper, &quot;The Porcupine&quot;, bearing the motto &quot;Fear God, Honour the King&quot;, started on 30 October 1800, but without success, and he sold his interest in it in 1801. Less than a month later, he started the &quot;Political Register&quot;, a newspaper that appeared almost every week from January 1802 until 1835, the year of Cobbett&#x27;s death. Windham and French Laurence had suggested the idea of a weekly newspaper to Cobbett and Windham raised the money to fund it by private subscription.

When the British government signed a preliminary peace agreement with France in October 1801, Cobbett emerged as one of its foremost opponents, and in the pages of &quot;The Porcupine&quot; and in his &quot;Letters to Lord Hawkesbury&quot;, he denounced the agreement as humiliating to Britain and advantageous to France. When news of the ratification arrived on 10 October, Cobbett refused to illuminate the windows of his house in celebration and it was attacked by a mob, which smashed all the windows. When the Peace of Amiens was signed in March 1802, Cobbett again refused to illuminate his windows and the Royal Horse Guards had to protect his house from the mob.

War broke out again between Britain and France in May 1803 and Napoleon planned to invade England, assembling the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; at Boulogne. In June, &quot;The Morning Post&quot; appealed to all newspapers to print articles for &quot;the purpose of arousing the people to the defence of the country&quot;. Cobbett immediately began a pamphlet, &quot;Important Considerations for the People of the Kingdom&quot;, warning the country of the consequences of a French invasion. Cobbett declined an offer of payment from the government and his pamphlet was published anonymously in July. The Prime Minister, Henry Addington, ordered copies to be sent to every parish in England and it had an immediate effect on public opinion.

Cobbett formed a close friendship with Windham, who became his patron and shared his anti-Jacobinism and his love of rural and athletic sports. The Evangelical movement was campaigning to reform the sports and recreations of the common people, intending to replace bull-baiting, boxing, singlestick, wrestling and racing with Sunday Schools and psalm singing. Cobbett in the &quot;Register&quot; criticised the Evangelicals&#x27; hostility to rural and athletic sports, &quot;which string the nerves and strengthen the frame, which excite an emulation in deeds of hardihood and valour, and which imperceptibly instill honour, generosity, and a love of glory. Men thus formed are pupils unfit for the puritanical school; therefore it was, that the sect were incessantly labouring to eradicate, fibre by fibre, the last poor remains of English manners.&quot; Cobbett supported Windham in opposing attempts in the House of Commons to introduce bills against boxing and bull-baiting; he wrote to Windham that the bill &quot;goes to the rearing of puritanism into a system.&quot;

Although initially staunchly anti-Jacobin, by 1804 Cobbett was questioning the policies of the Pitt government, especially the immense national debt and profligate use of sinecures, which Cobbett believed were ruining the country and increasing class antagonism.

Cobbett lived in Botley, Hampshire from 1805, farming and raising his family, initially at Botley House near Botley Mills, and then, from 1812, in a smaller house at Botley Hill.

By 1807, he was endorsing reformers such as Francis Burdett and John Cartwright.

Cobbett published the &quot;Complete Collection of State Trials&quot; between 1804 and 1812 and amassed accounts of parliamentary debates from 1066 onwards, but financial difficulties obliged him to sell his shares in it to T. C. Hansard in 1812. This unofficial record of parliamentary proceedings later became known officially as Hansard.

Cobbett intended to campaign for Parliament in Honiton in 1806, but was persuaded by Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald to let him campaign in his stead. Both men campaigned together but failed, having refused to bribe voters by &quot;buying&quot; votes. This situation encouraged his opposition to rotten boroughs and belief in parliamentary reform.

==Prison (1810–1812)==

Cobbett was found guilty of treasonous libel on 15 June 1810, after objecting in &quot;The Register&quot; to the flogging at Ely, Cambridgeshire of local militiamen by Hanoverians. During his two years&#x27; incarceration at Newgate Prison, he wrote the pamphlet &quot;Paper Against Gold&quot;, warning of the dangers of paper money, and many essays and letters. His daughter Anne lived with him in prison. On his release, a dinner in his honour in London was attended by 600 people and directed by Sir Francis Burdett, who like Cobbett was a strong advocate of parliamentary reform. 

==&quot;Two-Penny Trash&quot; (1812–1817)==
By 1815 the tax on newspapers had reached four pence a copy. As few people could afford to pay six or seven pence for a daily newspaper, the tax restricted the circulation of most journals to those with fairly high incomes. Cobbett could sell only about a thousand copies a week. Nonetheless, he began criticising William Wilberforce for endorsing the Corn Laws, for his personal wealth and opposition to bull and bear-baiting, and particularly for his approval of &quot;the fat and lazy and laughing and singing negroes&quot;.

In 1816 Cobbett began publishing the &quot;Political Register&quot; as a pamphlet. It now sold for only two pence and soon had a circulation of 40,000. Critics termed it &quot;two-penny trash&quot;, a phrase Cobbett adopted. It became the main newspaper read by the working class. 
Radical campaigner Samuel Bamford later wrote:

At this time the writings of William Cobbett suddenly became of great authority; they were read on nearly every cottage hearth in the manufacturing districts of South Lancashire, in those of Leicester, Derby, and Nottingham; also in many of the Scottish manufacturing towns. Their influence was speedily visible. He directed his readers to the true cause of their sufferings—misgovernment; and to its proper corrective—parliamentary reform.

This made Cobbett a dangerous man. In 1817, he became aware that the government was planning to arrest him for sedition. With the government intending to suspend &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, and fearing arrest for his arguably seditious writings, Cobbett again fled to the United States. On Wednesday 27 March 1817, he embarked at Liverpool for New York on the ship &quot;Importer&quot;, with D. Ogden as master, accompanied by his two eldest sons, William and John.

==Refuge in the United States (1817–1819)==

Cobbett lived for two years on a farm on Long Island, where he wrote &quot;Grammar of the English Language&quot;. With help from William Benbow, a friend in London, he continued to issue the &quot;Political Register&quot;. He also wrote &quot;The American Gardener&quot; (1821), one of the earliest horticultural books published in the United States.

Cobbett observed alcohol-drinking habits in the United States. He stated in 1819, &quot;Americans preserve their gravity and quietness and good-humour even in their drink.&quot; He believed it would be &quot;far better for them to be as noisy and quarrelsome as the English drunkards; for then the odiousness of the vice would be more visible, and the vice itself might become less frequent.&quot;

A plan to return to England with the remains of the British-American radical pamphleteer and revolutionary Thomas Paine (who had died in 1809) resulted in the ultimate loss of the remains. The plan was to disinter Paine&#x27;s remains from his New Rochelle, New York farm for a heroic reburial on his native soil, but the bones were still among Cobbett&#x27;s effects when he died 16 years later. There is no confirmed story of what happened to them after that, although claims to parts of the body have been made down the years, including his skull and right hand.

Cobbett arrived back in Britain at Liverpool by ship in November 1819.

==Later life (1819–1835)==
Cobbett&#x27;s arrival came soon after the Peterloo Massacre. He joined with other radicals in attacks on the government and was charged with libel three times in the next couple of years.

Cobbett published on behalf of Caroline of Brunswick in her fight against the Pains and Penalties Bill 1820. His daughter Anne believed that he would have had fewer legal difficulties if he had stopped supporting Queen Caroline, but noted that they gained much needed source of income from supporting her. The family all expected notable rewards following the outcome of the trial being seen to be in Caroline&#x27;s favour, however her death soon after meant that this did not happen to the expected degree.
In 1820, he campaigned for Parliament in Coventry, but finished last in the poll. That year he also founded a plant nursery at Kensington, where he grew many North American trees, such as the black locust &quot;(Robinia pseudoacacia)&quot;, and with his son, a variety of maize he called &quot;Cobbett&#x27;s corn&quot;. This was a dwarf strain found in a French cottage garden, which turned out to grow well in England&#x27;s shorter summer. To help sell the strain, he issued a book entitled &quot;A Treatise on Cobbett&#x27;s Corn&quot; (1828). Meanwhile, he also wrote his popular &quot;Cottage Economy&quot; (1822), which taught cottagers some skills necessary for self-sufficiency, such as bread-making, beer-brewing and livestock farming.

===Advocacy for the English poor and working-class===
Not content to let information be brought to him for his newspaper, Cobbett did his own journalistic work – especially on his repeated theme of the plight of rural Englishmen. He began riding about the country observing events in towns and villages. &quot;Rural Rides&quot;, a work for which Cobbett is still known, appeared first in serial form in the &quot;Political Register&quot; from 1822 to 1826, and then in book form in 1830. While writing it, Cobbett also produced &quot;The Woodlands&quot; (1825), a book on silviculture.

In the first supplement to the &quot;Political Register&quot;, Cobbett had defended the slave trade as necessary to British commerce. After the Slave Trade Act 1807 prohibited slave trade, Cobbett wrote in the &quot;Register&quot; that &quot;there is not a reflecting man in the kingdom that cares one straw about it.&quot; In the &quot;Register&quot; for 30 August 1823, Cobbett published his &quot;Letter to William Wilberforce&quot;, an answer to Wilberforce&#x27;s &quot;Appeal to the Religion, Justice and Humanity of the Inhabitants of the British Empire in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies&quot;. Here, he attacked Wilberforce&#x27;s support for the Combination Act, which prohibited trade unions among British workers, and said: &quot;Never have you done one single act, in favour of those labourers, but many and many an act you have done against them.&quot; The &quot;Letter to Wilberforce&quot; was widely distributed in working class areas and gave an impetus to the Combination Act&#x27;s repeal in 1824.

Cobbett contrasted the Evangelical reformers&#x27; campaign for the abolition of black slavery with their support for the &quot;factory slavery&quot; of British workers. He argued that black slaves were better fed, clothed and housed than British workers, and were better treated by their masters. He wrote: &quot;Will not the care, will not the anxiety of a really humane Englishman be directed towards the Whites, instead of towards the Blacks, until, at any rate, the situation of the former be made to be &quot;as good&quot; as that of the latter?&quot; In 1833, Cobbett voted for the abolition of slavery but in the &quot;Register&quot; he was still contrasting Parliament&#x27;s concern for black slaves with their indifference to the sufferings of British &quot;factory slaves&quot;.

===Catholic emancipation===
Although not a Catholic, Cobbett at this time also advocated the cause of Catholic Emancipation. Between 1824 and 1826, he published his &quot;History of the Protestant Reformation&quot;, a broadside against the traditional Protestant historical narrative of the reformation, stressing the lengthy and often bloody persecutions of Catholics in Britain and Ireland. Catholics were still forbidden at that time to enter certain professions or become members of Parliament. Although the law was no longer enforced, it was officially still a crime to attend Mass or build a Catholic church. Although Wilberforce also worked and spoke against discrimination against Catholics, Cobbett resumed his strident opposition to the noted reformer, particularly after Wilberforce in 1823 published his &quot;Appeal in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies.&quot; Wilberforce, long suffering from ill health, retired the next year.
In 1829, Cobbett published &quot;Advice To Young Men&quot;, in which he criticised &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population&quot; by the Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus. That year he also published &quot;The English Gardener&quot;, which he later updated and expanded. This book has been compared favourably with other contemporary garden tomes, such as John Claudius Loudon&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopædia of Gardening&quot;.

Cobbett continued to publish controversial content in his &quot;Weekly Political Register&quot; and was charged in July 1831 with seditious libel for a pamphlet entitled &quot;Rural War&quot;, endorsing the Captain Swing Riots, in which rioters were smashing farm machinery and burning haystacks. Cobbett successfully conducted his own defence.

===Member of Parliament===
Cobbett still sought to be elected to the House of Commons. He was defeated in Preston in 1826 and in Manchester in 1832, but after the passage of the Reform Act 1832, Cobbett won the seat of Oldham.

In Parliament, Cobbett concentrated his energies on attacking corruption in government and the 1834 Poor Law. He believed that the poor had a right to a share in the community&#x27;s wealth and that the Old Poor Law was the last remaining right that English workers possessed, and which set them apart from other countries which had no such provision. Because the New Poor Law deprived the people of this right to relief, Cobbett believed that the social contract was broken and that therefore the duty of allegiance was dissolved. A week before his death, he wrote to a friend: &quot;[B]efore the passing of the Poor-Law Bill, I wished to avoid [a] convulsive termination. I now do not wish it to be avoided.&quot;

During later life, Thomas Macaulay, a fellow MP, remarked that Cobbett&#x27;s faculties were impaired by age. From 1831 until his death, Cobbett managed a farm named Ash in the village of Normandy, Surrey, a few miles from his birthplace at Farnham. Cobbett died there after a brief illness in June 1835 and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Farnham.

==Parliamentary career==
During his lifetime Cobbett campaigned for parliament five times, of which four attempts were unsuccessful:
*1806 Honiton
*1820 Coventry
*1826 Preston
*1832 Manchester

In 1832 he was elected as a member for Oldham.

==Legacy==

Cobbett is considered to have begun as an inherently conservative journalist. He was angered by the corrupt British political establishment, and became increasingly radical and sympathetic to antigovernment and democratic ideals. He provided a panegyric extolling rural England during the Industrial Revolution, which he was not in sympathy with. Cobbett wished England would return to the rural England of the 1760s, in which he had been born.

Unlike fellow radical Thomas Paine, Cobbett was not an internationalist cosmopolitan and did not endorse a republican Britain. He boasted that he was not a &quot;citizen of world... It is quite enough for me to think about what is best for England, Scotland and Ireland.&quot; Possessing a national identity, he often criticised rival countries and warned them that they should not &quot;swagger about and be saucy to England.&quot; He said his identification with the Church of England was due in part because it &quot;bears the name of my country.&quot; Among historical biographers, Ian Dyck claimed that Cobbett endorsed &quot;the eighteenth-century Country Party platform&quot;; Edward Tangye Lean described him as &quot;an archaic English Tory&quot;.

His writing style was parodied by Horace and James Smith in their collection, Rejected Addresses (1812).

Cobbett has been praised by thinkers of various political persuasions, such as Matthew Arnold, Karl Marx, G. K. Chesterton, A. J. P. Taylor, Raymond Williams, E. P. Thompson and Michael Foot.

A story by Cobbett issued in 1807 popularized the term &quot;red herring&quot;, to mean a distraction from an important issue.

Cobbett&#x27;s sons were trained as barristers and founded a partnership in Manchester named Cobbetts in his honour. The firm dissolved in 2013. His second son John Morgan Cobbett (1800–1877) followed him into politics and like his father became MP for Oldham.

Cobbett&#x27;s birthplace, a public house in Farnham once named &quot;The Jolly Farmer&quot;, has been renamed &quot;The William Cobbett&quot;. The Brooklyn-based history band Piñataland performed a song about William Cobbett&#x27;s quest to rebury Thomas Paine entitled &quot;An American Man&quot;. An equestrian statue of Cobbett was being planned for a site in Farnham in 2009, which already has the William Cobbett Primary School named in his honour.

After Cobbett&#x27;s death, Benjamin Tilly, who had served Cobbett as companion, secretary and factotum, initiated the Cobbett Club. Members sent petitions to Parliament demanding radical reform and produced radical pamphlets and leaflets to keep Cobbett&#x27;s politics alive. Some of these are still available in libraries. The William Cobbett Society, based in Farnham, produces a yearly edition of &#x27;Cobbett&#x27;s New Register&#x27;, and celebrates Cobbett&#x27;s life, works and spirit in various activities, including an annual Rural Ride and lecture.

<doc id="175822" wikidata="Q225896" url="?curid=175822" title="Silbury Hill">
<text>Silbury Hill is a prehistoric artificial chalk mound near Avebury in the English county of Wiltshire. It is part of the Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites UNESCO World Heritage Site. At high, the hill is the tallest prehistoric man-made mound in Europe and one of the largest in the world; it is similar in volume to contemporary Egyptian pyramids. The site is in the care of English Heritage.

Silbury Hill is part of the complex of Neolithic monuments around Avebury, which includes the Avebury Ring and West Kennet Long Barrow. Its original purpose is still debated. Several other important Neolithic monuments in Wiltshire, including the large henges at Marden and Salisbury Plain (Stonehenge), may be culturally or functionally related to Avebury and Silbury.

==Structure==
Composed mainly of chalk and clay excavated from the surrounding area, the mound stands high and covers about . The hill was constructed in several stages between and displays immense technical skill and prolonged control over labour and resources. Archaeologists calculate that it took 18 million man-hours, equivalent to 500 men working for 15 years to deposit and shape of earth and fill. Euan MacKie asserts that no simple late Neolithic tribal structure as usually imagined could have sustained this and similar projects, and envisages an authoritarian theocratic power elite with broad-ranging control across southern Britain.

The base of the hill is circular and in diameter. The summit is flat-topped and in diameter. A smaller mound was constructed first, and in a later phase much enlarged. The initial structures at the base of the hill were perfectly circular: surveying reveals that the centre of the flat top and the centre of the cone that describes the hill lie within a metre of one another. There are indications that the top originally had a rounded profile, but this was flattened in the medieval period to provide a base for a building, perhaps with a defensive purpose.

The first clear evidence of construction, dated to around consisted of a gravel core with a revetting kerb of stakes and sarsen boulders. Alternate layers of chalk rubble and earth were placed on top of this: the second phase involved heaping further chalk on top of the core, using material excavated from a series of surrounding ditches which were progressively refilled then recut several metres further out. The step surrounding the summit dates from this phase of construction, either as a precaution against slippage, or as the remnants of a spiral path ascending from the base, used to raise materials during construction, and later as a processional route.

Silbury Hill was originally entirely white since it had a chalk (limestone) exterior, and the surrounding ditch may have been regularly filled with water from underground springs.

==Investigations==


===17th, 18th, and 19th centuries===
The site was first illustrated by Aubrey, the 17th-century antiquarian, whose notes, in the form of his &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot;, were published between 1680–1682. Later, Stukeley wrote that a skeleton and bridle had been discovered during tree planting on the summit in 1723. In October 1776, a team of Cornish miners overseen by the Duke of Northumberland and Colonel Edward Drax sank a vertical shaft from the top. Brian Edwards argues that Drax and his friends—all members of Mrs. Millers&#x27; poetry set in Batheaston—were interested in Silbury Hill, because they thought it paralleled the Greek legends of Apollo killing Python, the monstrous snake that lived in the Caves of Parnassus. In 1849, a tunnel was dug horizontally from the edge into the centre. In 1867, the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society excavated the east side of the hill to see if traces of the Roman road were underneath it. No traces were found, and later excavations south of the hill located the road in fields to the south, making a pronounced swerve to avoid the base of the hill. This was conclusive proof that the hill was there before the road—but the hill provided an alignment sight-line for the road.

===20th century===
Flinders Petrie investigated the hill after the First World War. From 1968 to 1970 professor Richard J. C. Atkinson undertook work at Silbury which was broadcast on BBC Television. This excavation revealed most of the environmental evidence about the site, including the remains of winged ants which indicate that Silbury was begun in an August. Atkinson dug numerous trenches at the site and reopened the 1849 tunnel, where he found material suggesting a Neolithic date, although none of his radiocarbon dates are considered reliable by modern standards. He argued that the hill was constructed in steps, each tier being filled in with packed chalk and then smoothed off or weathered into a slope. Atkinson reported the C-14 date for the base layer of turf and decayed material indicated a corrected date for the commencement of Silbury was close to 

===21st century===
After heavy rains in May 2002, a collapse of the 1776 excavation shaft caused a hole to form in the top of the hill. English Heritage undertook a seismic survey of the hill to identify the damage caused by earlier excavations and determine the hill&#x27;s stability. Repairs were undertaken, but the site remained closed to the public. As part of this remedial work, English Heritage, with help from AC Archaeology, excavated two further small trenches at the summit. Neil Adam from AC Archaeology made the important discovery of an antler fragment, the first from a secure archaeological context at the site. A radiocarbon date of dates the second phase of the mound convincingly to the Late Neolithic.

In March 2007, English Heritage announced that a Roman village had been found at the foot of Silbury Hill. It contained regularly laid out streets and houses.

In May 2007, contractors Skanska, under the overall direction of English Heritage, began a major programme of stabilisation, filling the tunnels and shafts from previous investigations with hundreds of tonnes of chalk. At the same time a new archaeological survey was conducted using modern equipment and techniques. The work finished in early 2008; a &quot;significant&quot; new understanding of the monument&#x27;s construction and history had been obtained.

In 2010, letters written by Edward Drax concerning the 1776 excavation were found in the British Library. He describes a &quot;perpendicular cavity&quot; deep and wide. As wood fragments—thought to be oak—have been found, it has been suggested that this may have held an oak tree or a &quot;totem pole&quot;.

===Comparable sites===

Following the 2007–2008 works, archaeologists investigated whether Silbury Hill was the only such mound built by the people of the time, or if there might be other comparable mounds that have not been recognised as prehistoric. A strong candidate was felt to be the Marlborough Mound, in the grounds of Marlborough College, east of Silbury Hill, further down the River Kennet. The mound is high, less than half the height of Silbury. There are archaeological and documentary indications that the Marlborough Mound had been used for medieval fortifications known as Marlborough Castle, and it had been identified as a Norman motte. A team of archaeologists, led by Jim Leary, analysed core samples from two 10 cm diameter boreholes. Charcoal from immediately below the mound was from around making it a close contemporary of Silbury.

Another contender, but which had been all but levelled in the 19th century, was at Marden Henge, south of Silbury. Known as Hatfield Barrow, a surviving fragment of what may have been a 15 m high mound also gave construction dates to the 

The Round Mound Project to investigate other likely mounds began in 2015, and from 154 potential sites across England, 20 were selected for core sampling and detailed surveying. By late 2017, 14 had produced results confirming that they were built immediately after the Norman invasion of 1066. Three were shown to be later medieval mounds and one was from Saxon times, so may be a burial mound. Only one, Skipsea Castle mound in East Yorkshire, was found to be prehistoric, but dating to during the British Iron Age. On the basis of this survey, it would appear that Neolithic mound-building was restricted to the upper Kennet and Avon valleys, and that nothing extant elsewhere in Britain comes close as a comparison to Silbury Hill.

===Artifacts===
Few prehistoric artifacts have been found on Silbury Hill: at its core there is only clay, flints, turf, moss, topsoil, gravel, freshwater shells, mistletoe, oak, hazel, sarsen stones, ox bones, and antler tines. Roman and medieval items have been found on and around the site since the nineteenth century.

==Purpose==
The purpose of the hill is unknown, though various suggestions have been put forward.

===Folklore===
According to legend, Silbury is the last resting place of a King Sil, represented in a life-size gold statue and sitting on a golden horse. A local legend noted in 1913 states that the Devil was carrying a bag of soil to drop on the citizens of Marlborough, but he was stopped by the priests of nearby Avebury. In 1861 it was reported that hundreds of people from Kennet, Avebury, Overton, and the neighbouring villages thronged Silbury Hill every Palm Sunday.

John C. Barret asserts that any ritual at Silbury Hill would have involved physically raising a few individuals far above the level of everyone else, where they would have been visible for miles around and from several other monuments in the area. This would possibly indicate an elite group, perhaps a priesthood, powerfully displaying their authority.

Michael Dames has put forward a composite theory of seasonal rituals, in an attempt to explain the purpose of Silbury Hill and its associated sites (West Kennet Long Barrow, the Avebury henge, The Sanctuary and Windmill Hill), from which the summit of Silbury Hill is visible.

Paul Devereux observes that Silbury and its surrounding monuments appear to have been designed with a system of inter-related sightlines, focusing on the step several metres below the summit. From various surrounding barrows and from Avebury, the step aligns with hills on the horizon behind Silbury, or with the hills in front of Silbury, leaving only the topmost part visible. In the latter case, Devereux hypothesises that ripe cereal crops grown on the intervening hill would perfectly cover the upper portion of Silbury, with the top of the corn and the top of Silbury coinciding.

Jim Leary and David Field (2010) conclude that the mound&#x27;s purpose cannot be known, and the multiple and overlapping construction phases – almost continuous remodelling – suggest there was no blueprint and that the process of building was probably the most important thing of all: perhaps the process was more important than the hill.

== Site of Special Scientific Interest ==
The hill&#x27;s vegetation is species-rich chalk grassland, dominated by upright brome and false oat-grass, but with many species characteristic of this habitat, including a strong population of the rare knapweed broomrape. In 1965 and 1986 the entire hill – in all – was notified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.
