<text>&quot;Britannic (originally to be theRMS &quot;Britannic) () was the third and final vessel of the White Star Line&#x27;s of steamships and the second White Star ship to bear the name &quot;Britannic&quot;. She was the youngest sister of the and the and was intended to enter service as a transatlantic passenger liner. She was operated as a hospital ship from 1915 until her sinking near the Greek island of Kea, in the Aegean Sea, in November 1916. At the time she was the largest hospital ship in the world.

&quot;Britannic&quot; was launched just before the start of the First World War. She was designed to be the safest of the three ships with design changes made during construction due to lessons learned from the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. She was laid up at her builders, Harland and Wolff, in Belfast for many months before being requisitioned as a hospital ship. In 1915 and 1916 she served between the United Kingdom and the Dardanelles. 

On the morning of 21 November 1916 she hit a naval mine of the Imperial German Navy near the Greek island of Kea and sank 55 minutes later, killing 30 of 1,066 people on board; the 1,036 survivors were rescued from the water and from lifeboats. &quot;Britannic&quot; was the largest ship lost in the First World War. After the War, the White Star Line was compensated for the loss of &quot;Britannic&quot; by the award of SS &quot;Bismarck&quot; as part of postwar reparations; she entered service as . The wreck of the &quot;Britannic&quot; was located and explored by Jacques Cousteau in 1975. The vessel is the largest intact passenger ship on the seabed in the world. It was bought in 1996 and is currently owned by Simon Mills, a maritime historian.

== Characteristics ==
The original dimensions of &quot;Britannic&quot; were similar to those of her older sisters, but her dimensions were altered whilst still on the building stocks after the loss of &quot;Titanic&quot;. With a gross tonnage of 48,158, she surpassed her older sisters in terms of internal volume, but this did not make her the largest passenger ship in service at that time; the German held this title with a significantly higher tonnage.

The &quot;Olympic&quot;-class ships were propelled by a combined system of two triple-expansion steam engines which powered the three-bladed outboard wing propellers whilst a low-pressure steam turbine used steam exhausted from the two reciprocating engines to power the central four-bladed propeller giving a maximum speed of 23 knots.

=== Post-&quot;Titanic&quot; design changes ===

&quot;Britannic&quot; had a similar layout to her sister ships. Following the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster and the subsequent inquiries, several design changes were made to the remaining &quot;Olympic&quot;-class liners. With &quot;Britannic&quot;, these changes made before launch included increasing the ship&#x27;s beam to to allow for a double hull along the engine and boiler rooms and raising six out of the 15 watertight bulkheads up to B Deck. Additionally, a larger turbine was added instead of the units installed on the earlier vessels to make up for the increase in hull width. The central watertight compartments were enhanced, allowing the ship to stay afloat with six compartments flooded.

Externally the largest visual change was the fitting of large crane-like gantry davits, each powered by an electric motor and capable of launching six lifeboats which were stored on gantries; the ship was designed to have eight sets of gantry davits but only five were installed before &quot;Britannic&quot; entered war service, with the difference being made up with boats launched by manually operated Welin-type davits as on &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Olympic&quot;.

Additional lifeboats could be stored within reach of the davits on the deckhouse roof, and the gantry davits could reach lifeboats on the other side of the ship, providing that none of the funnels was obstructing the way. This design enabled all the lifeboats to be launched, even if the ship developed a list that would normally prevent lifeboats from being launched on the side opposite to the list. Several of these davits were placed abreast of funnels, defeating that purpose. The elevators, which previously stopped at A deck, could now reach the boat deck. The ship carried 48 lifeboats, capable of carrying at least 75 people each. Thus, at least 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats, which was well above the ship&#x27;s maximum capacity of 3,309.

== History ==
=== Conception ===
In 1907, J. Bruce Ismay, director general of the White Star Line, and Lord Pirrie, chairman of the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard in Belfast had decided to build a trio of ocean liners of unmatched size to compete with the Cunard Line&#x27;s and not in terms of speed but in terms of luxury and safety. The names of the three vessels were decided at a later date and they showed the intention of the designers regarding their size: &quot;Olympic&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Britannic&quot;.

Construction of the &quot;Olympic&quot; and the &quot;Titanic&quot; began in 1908 and 1909 respectively. Their sizes were so large that it was necessary to build the Arrol Gantry to shelter them, wide enough to span the two new building slips and allow two ships to be built at a time. The three ships were designed to be 270 metres long and to have a gross tonnage of over 45,000. Their designed speed was approximately 22 knots, well below that of the &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot;, but still allowing for a transatlantic crossing of less than one week.

=== Rumoured name-change ===

Although the White Star Line and the Harland and Wolff shipyard always denied it, some sources claim that &quot;Britannic&quot; was to be named &quot;Gigantic&quot;, but her name was changed so as not to compete with &quot;Titanic&quot; or create comparisons. One source is a poster of the ship with the name &quot;Gigantic&quot; at the top. Other sources are November 1911 American newspapers stating the White Star order for &quot;Gigantic&quot; being placed, as well as other newspapers from around the world both during construction and immediately after the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

Tom McCluskie stated that in his capacity as archive manager and historian at Harland and Wolff, he &quot;never saw any official reference to the name &quot;Gigantic&quot; being used or proposed for the third of the &quot;Olympic&quot;-class vessels&quot;. Some hand-written changes were added to the order book and dated January 1912. These only dealt with the ship&#x27;s moulded width, not her name.

=== Construction ===
&quot;Britannic&quot;″s keel was laid on 30 November 1911 at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, on the gantry slip previously occupied by , 13 months after the launch of that ship, and , launched seven days before. The acquisition of the ship was planned to be at the beginning of 1914. Due to improvements introduced as a consequence of the &quot;Titanic&quot;″s disaster, &quot;Britannic&quot; was not launched until 26 February 1914, which was filmed along with the fitting of a funnel. Several speeches were given in front of the press, and a dinner was organised in honour of the launching. Fitting out began subsequently. The ship entered dry dock in September and her propellers were installed.

Reusing &quot;Olympic&quot;″s space saved the shipyard time and money by not clearing out a third slip similar in size to those used for the two previous vessels. In August 1914, before &quot;Britannic&quot; could commence transatlantic service between New York and Southampton, the First World War began. Immediately, all shipyards with Admiralty contracts were given priority to use available raw materials. All civil contracts including &quot;Britannic&quot; were slowed.

The naval authorities requisitioned a large number of ships as armed merchant cruisers or for troop transport. The Admiralty paid the companies for the use of their ships but the risk of losing a ship in naval operations was high. The larger ocean liners were not initially taken for naval use, because smaller ships were easier to operate. &quot;Olympic&quot; returned to Belfast on 3 November 1914, while work on &quot;Britannic&quot; continued slowly.

=== Requisition ===

The need for increased tonnage grew critical as naval operations extended to the Eastern Mediterranean. In May 1915, &quot;Britannic&quot; completed mooring trials of her engines, and was prepared for emergency entrance into service with as little as four weeks&#x27; notice. The same month also saw the first major loss of a civilian ocean liner when Cunard&#x27;s was torpedoed near the Irish coast by .

The following month, the Admiralty decided to use recently requisitioned passenger liners as troop transports in the Gallipoli Campaign (also called the Dardanelles service). The first to sail were Cunard&#x27;s and . As the Gallipoli landings proved to be disastrous and the casualties mounted, the need for large hospital ships for treatment and evacuation of wounded became evident. &quot;Aquitania&quot; was diverted to hospital ship duties in August (her place as a troop transport would be taken by &quot;Olympic&quot; in September). Then on 13 November 1915, &quot;Britannic&quot; was requisitioned as a hospital ship from her storage location at Belfast.

Repainted white with large red crosses and a horizontal green stripe, she was renamed HMHS (His Majesty&#x27;s Hospital Ship) &quot;Britannic&quot; and placed under the command of Captain Charles Alfred Bartlett. In the interior, 3,309 beds and several operating rooms were installed. The common areas of the upper decks were transformed into rooms for the wounded. The cabins of B Deck were used to house doctors. The first-class dining room and the first-class reception room on D Deck were transformed into operating rooms. The lower bridge was used to accommodate the lightly wounded. The medical equipment was installed on 12 December 1915.

=== First service ===

When declared fit for service on 12 December 1915 at Liverpool, &quot;Britannic&quot; was assigned a medical team consisting of 101 nurses, 336 non-commissioned officers and 52 commissioned officers as well as a crew of 675 people. On 23 December, she left Liverpool to join the port of Mudros on the island of Lemnos on the Aegean Sea to bring back sick and wounded soldiers. She joined with several ships on the same route, including &quot;Mauretania&quot;, &quot;Aquitania&quot;, and her sister ship &quot;Olympic&quot;. The four ships were joined a little later by . She made a stopover at Naples before continuing to Mudros, in order for her stock of coal to be replenished. After she returned, she spent four weeks as a floating hospital off the Isle of Wight.

The third voyage was from 20 March 1916 to 4 April. The Dardanelles was evacuated in January. At the end of her military service on 6 June 1916, &quot;Britannic&quot; returned to Belfast to undergo the necessary modifications for transforming her into a transatlantic passenger liner. The British government paid the White Star Line £75,000 to compensate for the conversion. The transformation took place for several months before being interrupted by a recall of the ship back into military service.

=== Recalled ===
The Admiralty recalled &quot;Britannic&quot; back into service as a hospital ship on 26 August 1916, and the ship returned to the Mediterranean Sea for a fourth voyage on 24 September of that year. On 29 September on her way to Naples, she encountered a violent storm from which she emerged unscathed. She left on 9 October for Southampton. Then, she made a fifth trip, which was marked by a quarantining of the crew when the ship arrived at Mudros (now Moudros) because of food-borne illness.

Life aboard the ship followed a routine. At six o&#x27;clock, the patients were awakened and the premises were cleaned up. Breakfast was served at 6:30 AM, then the captain toured the ship for an inspection. Lunch was served at 12:30 PM and tea at 4:30 PM. Patients were treated between meals and those who wished to go for a walk could do so. At 8:30 PM, the patients went to bed and the captain made another inspection tour. There were medical classes available for training the nurses.

=== Last voyage and Sinking ===

After completing five successful voyages to the Middle Eastern theatre and back to the United Kingdom transporting the sick and wounded, &quot;Britannic&quot; departed Southampton for Lemnos at 14:23 on 12 November 1916, her sixth voyage to the Mediterranean Sea. The ship passed Gibraltar around midnight on 15 November and arrived at Naples on the morning of 17 November, for her usual coaling and water-refuelling stop, completing the first stage of her mission.

A storm kept the ship at Naples until Sunday afternoon when Captain Bartlett decided to take advantage of a brief break in the weather and continue. The seas rose once again as &quot;Britannic&quot; left the port. By the next morning, the storms died and the ship passed the Strait of Messina without problems. Cape Matapan was rounded in the first hours of 21 November. By morning, &quot;Britannic&quot; was steaming at full speed into the Kea Channel, between Cape Sounion (the southernmost point of Attica, the prefecture that includes Athens) and the island of Kea.

There were 1,066 people on board: 673 crew, 315 Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), 77 nurses, and the captain.

==== Explosion ====

At 08:12 am European Eastern Time &quot;Britannic&quot; was rocked by an explosion after hitting a mine. The mines had been planted in the Kea Channel on 21 October 1916 by under the command of .

The reaction in the dining room was immediate; doctors and nurses left instantly for their posts but not everybody reacted the same way, as further aft, the power of the explosion was less felt, and many thought the ship had hit a smaller boat. Captain Bartlett and Chief Officer Hume were on the bridge at the time and the gravity of the situation was soon evident. The explosion was on the starboard side, between holds two and three. The force of the explosion damaged the watertight bulkhead between hold one and the forepeak. The first four watertight compartments were filling rapidly with water, the boiler-man&#x27;s tunnel connecting the firemen&#x27;s quarters in the bow with boiler room six was seriously damaged, and water was flowing into that boiler room.

Bartlett ordered the watertight doors closed, sent a distress signal, and ordered the crew to prepare the lifeboats. An SOS signal was immediately sent out and was received by several other ships in the area, among them and , but &quot;Britannic&quot; heard nothing in reply. Unknown to either Bartlett or the ship&#x27;s wireless operator, the force of the first explosion had caused the antenna wires slung between the ship&#x27;s masts to snap. This meant that although the ship could still send out transmissions by radio, she could no longer receive them.

Along with the damaged watertight door of the firemen&#x27;s tunnel, the watertight door between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly. Water was flowing further aft into boiler room five. &quot;Britannic&quot; had reached her flooding limit. She could stay afloat (motionless) with her first six watertight compartments flooded. There were five watertight bulkheads rising all the way up to B Deck. Those measures had been taken after the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster (&quot;Titanic&quot; could float with only her first four compartments flooded).

The next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship&#x27;s survival. However, there were open portholes along the front lower decks, which tilted underwater within minutes of the explosion. The nurses had opened most of those portholes to ventilate the wards, against standing orders. As the ship&#x27;s angle of list increased, water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four. With more than six compartments flooded, &quot;Britannic&quot; could not stay afloat.

==== Evacuation ====
On the bridge, Captain Bartlett was already considering efforts to save the ship. Only two minutes after the blast, boiler rooms five and six had to be evacuated. In about ten minutes, &quot;Britannic&quot; was roughly in the same condition &quot;Titanic&quot; had been in one hour after the collision with the iceberg. Fifteen minutes after the ship was struck, the open portholes on E Deck were underwater. With water also entering her aft section from the bulkhead between boiler rooms four and five, &quot;Britannic&quot; quickly developed a serious list to starboard.

Bartlett gave the order to turn starboard towards the island of Kea in an attempt to beach her. The effect of &quot;Britannic&#x27;s&quot; starboard list and the weight of the rudder made attempts to navigate the ship under her own power difficult, and the steering gear had been knocked out by the explosion, which eliminated steering by the rudder. The captain ordered the port shaft driven at a higher speed than the starboard side, which helped the ship move towards Kea.

At the same time, the hospital staff prepared to evacuate. Bartlett had given the order to prepare the lifeboats, but he did not allow them to be lowered into the water. Everyone took their most valuable belongings with them before they evacuated. The chaplain of the ship recovered his Bible. The few patients and nurses on board were assembled. Major Harold Priestley gathered his detachments from the Royal Army Medical Corps to the back of the A deck and inspected the cabins to ensure no one was left behind.

While Bartlett continued his desperate manoeuvre, &quot;Britannic&#x27;s&quot; list steadily increased. Fearing that the list would become too large to launch, some crew decided to launch lifeboats without waiting for the order to do so. Two lifeboats were put onto the water on the port side without permission by Third Officer Francis Laws. These boats were drawn towards the still-turning, partly surfaced propellers. Bartlett ordered the engines to stop but before this could take effect, the two boats were drawn into the propellers, completely destroying both and killing 30 people. Bartlett was able to stop the engines before any more boats were lost.

==== Final moments ====
By 08:50, most of those on board had escaped in the 35 successfully launched lifeboats. At this point, Bartlett concluded that the rate at which &quot;Britannic&quot; was sinking had slowed so he called a halt to the evacuation and ordered the engines restarted in the hope that he might still be able to beach the ship. At 09:00 Bartlett was informed that the rate of flooding had increased due to the ship&#x27;s forward motion and that the flooding had reached D-deck. Realising that there was now no hope of reaching land in time, Bartlett gave the final order to stop the engines and sounded two final long blasts of the whistle, the signal to abandon ship. As water reached the bridge, he and Assistant Commander Dyke walked off onto the deck and entered the water, swimming to a collapsible boat from which they continued to coordinate the rescue operations.

&quot;Britannic&quot; gradually capsized to starboard, and the funnels collapsed one after the other as the ship rapidly sank. By the time the stern was out of the water, the bow had already slammed into the seabed. As &quot;Britannic&quot;&#x27;s length was greater than the depth of the water, the impact caused major structural damage to the bow before she slipped completely beneath the waves at 09:07, 55 minutes after the explosion. Violet Jessop (who was one of the survivors of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, and had also been on board when the &quot;Olympic&quot; collided with ) described the last seconds:

She dipped her head a little, then a little lower and still lower. All the deck machinery fell into the sea like a child&#x27;s toys. Then she took a fearful plunge, her stern rearing hundreds of feet into the air until with a final roar, she disappeared into the depths, the noise of her going resounding through the water with undreamt-of violence...

When the &quot;Britannic&quot; came to rest, she became the largest ship lost in the First World War and the world&#x27;s largest sunken passenger ship.

==== Rescue ====
Compared to &quot;Titanic&quot;, the rescue of &quot;Britannic&quot; was facilitated by three factors: The water temperature was higher ( compared to for &quot;Titanic&quot;), more lifeboats were available (35 were successfully launched and stayed afloat compared to &quot;Titanic&quot;″s 20), and help was closer (it arrived less than two hours after first distress call compared to three and a half hours for &quot;Titanic&quot;).

The first to arrive on the scene were fishermen from Kea on their caïque, who picked many survivors from the water. At 10:00, sighted the first lifeboats and 10 minutes later stopped and picked up 339 survivors. Armed boarding steamer HMS &quot;Heroic&quot; had arrived some minutes earlier and picked up 494. Some 150 had made it to Korissia, Kea, where surviving doctors and nurses from &quot;Britannic&quot; were trying to save the injured, using aprons and pieces of lifebelts to make dressings. A little barren quayside served as their operating room.

&quot;Scourge&quot; and &quot;Heroic&quot; had no deck space for more survivors, and they left for Piraeus signalling the presence of those remaining at Korissia. arrived at 11:45 and, after sweeping the area, anchored in the small port at 13:00 to offer medical assistance and take on board the remaining survivors. At 14:00 the light cruiser arrived. &quot;Foxhound&quot; departed for Piraeus at 14:15 while &quot;Foresight&quot; remained to arrange the burial on Kea of RAMC Sergeant William Sharpe, who had died of his injuries. Another two survivors died on the &quot;Heroic&quot; and one on the French tug &quot;Goliath&quot;. The three were buried with military honours in the Piraeus Naval and Consular Cemetery. The last fatality was G. Honeycott, who died at the Russian Hospital at Piraeus shortly after the funerals.

In total, out of the 1,066 people on board, 1,036 people survived the sinking. Thirty people lost their lives in the disaster but only five were buried; others were not recovered and are honoured on memorials in Thessaloniki (the Mikra Memorial) and London. Another 38 were injured (18 crew, 20 RAMC). Survivors were accommodated in the warships that were anchored at the port of Piraeus while nurses and officers were hosted in separate hotels at Phaleron. Many Greek citizens and officials attended the funerals. Survivors were sent home and few arrived in the United Kingdom before Christmas.

In November 2006, &quot;Britannic&quot; researcher Michail Michailakis discovered that one of the 45 unidentified graves in the New British Cemetery in the town of Hermoupolis on the island of Syros contained the remains of a soldier collected from the church of Ag. Trias at Livadi (the former name of Korissia). Maritime historian Simon Mills contacted the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Further research established that this soldier was a &quot;Britannic&quot; casualty and his remains had been registered in October 1919 as belonging to a certain &quot;Corporal Stevens&quot;.

When the remains were moved to the new cemetery at Syros in June 1921, it was found that there was no record relating this name with the loss of the ship, and the grave was registered as unidentified. Mills provided evidence that this man could be Sergeant Sharpe and the case was considered by the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency. A new headstone for Sharpe was erected and the CWGC has updated its database.

== Visualised as an ocean liner ==
The plan of &quot;Britannic&quot; showed that she was intended to be more luxurious than her sister ships in order to compete with , and . Enough cabins were provided for passengers divided into three classes. The White Star Line anticipated a considerable change in its customer base. Thus, the quality of the Third Class (intended for migrants) was lowered when compared to that of her sisters, while the quality of the Second Class increased. In addition, the number of crew planned was increased from about 860 – 880 onboard &quot;Olympic&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; to 950 aboard &quot;Britannic&quot;.

The quality of the First Class was also improved. Children began to appear as part of the clientele that needed to be satisfied, and thus a playroom for them was built on the boat deck. Similar to her two sister ships, the first class amenities included the Grand Staircase, but &quot;Britannic&quot;″s amenities were more sumptuous, with worked balustrades, decorative panels and a pipe organ. The A Deck of the ship was devoted in its entirety to the First Class, being fitted with a salon, two veranda cafes, a smoking room and a reading room. The B Deck included a hair salon, post office, and redesigned deluxe Parlour Suites, dubbed Saloons in the Builder&#x27;s Plans. The most important addition was that of individual bathrooms in almost every First Class cabin, which would have been a first on an ocean liner. Aboard the &quot;Olympic&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;, most passengers had to use public bathrooms.

These facilities were installed but were soon removed because the ship was converted to a hospital ship and were never re-installed because the ship sank before she could enter transatlantic service, so the planned facilities were either cancelled, destroyed, reused on other vessels, like the &quot;Olympic&quot; or &quot;Majestic&quot;, or just never used. Of these accessories, only a large staircase and a children&#x27;s playroom remained installed. Under the glass dome was a white wall above the first-class staircase instead of a clock and a large painting.
=== Pipe organ ===
A Welte philharmonic organ was planned to be installed on board &quot;Britannic&quot; but because of the outbreak of war, the instrument never made its way to Belfast from Germany. After the war, it was not claimed by Harland and Wolff since &quot;Britannic&quot; sank before she could have ever entered transatlantic service. It also was not installed on &quot;Olympic&quot; or &quot;Majestic&quot; since White Star Line did not want it. For a long time, it was thought that the organ was lost or destroyed.

In April 2007, the restorers of a Welte organ, now in the &quot; in Seewen, Switzerland, detected that the main parts of the instrument were signed by the German organ builders with &quot;Britanik&quot;&quot;. A photograph of a drawing in a company prospectus, found in the Welte-legacy in the Augustiner Museum in Freiburg, proved that this was the organ intended for &quot;Britannic&quot;. It was found that Welte had first sold the organ to a private owner in Stuttgart instead. Later, in 1937 it had been transferred to a company&#x27;s concert hall in Wipperfürth, where it was eventually acquired by the founder of the Swiss Museum of Music Automatons in 1969. At the time, the museum was still unaware of the organ&#x27;s original history. The museum maintains the organ in working condition and it is still used for fully automated and manual performances.

== Wreck ==
The wreck of HMHS &quot;Britannic&quot; is at in about of water. It was discovered on 3 December 1975 by Jacques Cousteau, who explored it. In filming the expedition, Cousteau also held conference on camera with several surviving personnel from the ship including Sheila MacBeth Mitchell, a survivor of the sinking. In 1976, Cousteau entered the wreck with his divers for the first time. He expressed the opinion that the ship had been sunk by a single torpedo, basing this opinion on the damage to her plates.

The giant liner lies on her starboard side relatively intact, hiding the large hole that was torn open by the mine. There is a huge hole just beneath the forward well deck. The bow is heavily deformed and attached to the rest of the hull only by some pieces of C-Deck. The crew&#x27;s quarters in the forecastle were found to be in good shape with many details still visible. The holds were found empty.

The forecastle machinery and the two cargo cranes in the forward well deck are well preserved. The foremast is bent and lies on the seabed near the wreck with the crow&#x27;s nest still attached. The bell, thought to be lost, was found in a dive in 2019, having fallen from the mast and is now lying directly below the crow&#x27;s nest on the seabed. Funnel number 1 was found a few metres from the Boat Deck. Funnel numbers two, three, and four were found in the debris field (located off the stern). Pieces of coal lie beside the wreck.

In mid-1995, in an expedition filmed by &quot;NOVA&quot;, Dr Robert Ballard, best known for having discovered the wrecks of in 1985, and the in 1989, visited the wreck, using advanced side-scan sonar. Images were obtained from remotely controlled vehicles, but the wreck was not penetrated. Ballard found all the ship&#x27;s funnels in surprisingly good condition. Attempts to find mine anchors failed.

In August 1996, the wreck was bought by Simon Mills, who has written two books about the ship: &quot;Britannic – The Last Titan&quot; and &quot;Hostage To Fortune&quot;.

In November 1997, an international team of divers led by Kevin Gurr used open-circuit trimix diving techniques to visit and film the wreck in the newly available DV digital video format.

In September 1998, another team of divers made an expedition to the wreck. Using diver propulsion vehicles, the team made more man-dives to the wreck and produced more images than ever before, including video of four telegraphs, a helm and a telemotor on the captain&#x27;s bridge.

In 1999 GUE divers acclimated to cave diving and ocean discovery led the first dive expedition to include extensive penetration into &quot;Britannic&quot;. Video of the expedition was broadcast by National Geographic, BBC, the History Channel and the Discovery Channel.

In September 2003, an expedition led by Carl Spencer dived into the wreck. This was the first expedition to dive &quot;Britannic&quot; where all the bottom divers were using closed circuit rebreathers (CCR). Diver Leigh Bishop brought back some of the first photographs from inside the wreck and his diver partner Rich Stevenson found that several watertight doors were open. It has been suggested that this was because the mine strike coincided with the change of watches. Alternatively, the explosion may have distorted the doorframes. A number of mine anchors were located off the wreck by sonar expert Bill Smith, confirming the German records of that &quot;Britannic&quot; was sunk by a single mine and the damage was compounded by open portholes and watertight doors. Spencer&#x27;s expedition was broadcast extensively across the world for many years by National Geographic and the UK&#x27;s Channel 5.

In 2006, an expedition, funded and filmed by the History Channel, brought together fourteen skilled divers to help determine what caused the quick sinking of &quot;Britannic&quot;. After preparation the crew dived on the wreck site on 17 September. Time was cut short when silt was kicked up, causing zero visibility conditions, and the two divers narrowly escaped with their lives. One last dive was to be attempted on &quot;Britannic&quot;″s boiler room, but it was discovered that photographing this far inside the wreck would lead to violating a permit issued by the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, a department within the Greek Ministry of Culture.

Partly because of a barrier in languages, a last-minute plea was turned down by the department. The expedition was unable to determine the cause of the rapid sinking, but hours of footage were filmed and important data was documented. The Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities later recognised the importance of this mission and extended an invitation to revisit the wreck under less stringent rules.

On 24 May 2009, Carl Spencer, drawn back to his third underwater filming mission of &quot;Britannic&quot;, died in Greece due to equipment difficulties while filming the wreck for National Geographic.

In 2012, on an expedition organised by Alexander Sotiriou and Paul Lijnen, divers using rebreathers installed and recovered scientific equipment used for environmental purposes, to determine how fast bacteria are eating &quot;Britannic&quot;″s iron compared to &quot;Titanic&quot;.

On 29 September 2019, a British technical diver, Tim Saville, died during a 120 m / 393 ft dive on &quot;Britannic&quot;″s wreck.

== Legacy ==
Having her career cut short in wartime, never having entered commercial service, and having had few victims, &quot;Britannic&quot; did not experience the same notoriety as her sister ship &quot;Titanic&quot;. After being largely forgotten by the public, she finally gained fame when her wreck was discovered. Her name was reused by the White Star Line when it put into service in 1930. That ship was the last to fly the flag of the company when it retired in 1960.

After Germany capitulated at the end of the First World War followed by the Treaty of Versailles, it handed over some of its ocean liners as war reparations, two of which were given to the company. The first, the &quot;Bismarck&quot;, renamed , replaced the &quot;Britannic&quot;. The second, the &quot;Columbus&quot;, renamed the , compensated for other ships lost in the conflict.

The last survivor, George Perman, died on 24 May 2000, just short of his 100th birthday. At the time of the sinking, he was a 15-year-old Scout working on &quot;Britannic&quot;, and the youngest person onboard the ship.

=== In popular culture ===
A fictionalised version of the sinking of the ship was dramatised in a 2000 television film, &quot;Britannic&quot;, that featured Edward Atterton, Amanda Ryan, Jacqueline Bisset and John Rhys-Davies, depicting a German agent sabotaging the ship, due to it secretly carrying munitions.

A BBC2 documentary, &quot;Titanic&#x27;s Tragic Twin – the Britannic Disaster&quot;, was broadcast on 5 December 2016; presented by Kate Humble and Andy Torbet, it used up-to-date underwater film of the wreck and spoke to relatives of survivors.

The historical docudrama &quot;The Mystery Of The Britannic&quot; was released in 2017, in which the maritime explorer Richard Kohler investigates the ship&#x27;s last voyage.

Alma Katsu&#x27;s 2020 novel &quot;The Deep&quot; was set partly on the &quot;Britannic&quot;, and on its sister ship the &quot;Titanic&quot;, and centred around the sinking of both ships.

The &quot;Gigantic&quot;, the apparent setting of the 2009 escape-room game &quot;Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors&quot;, references the &quot;Britannic&quot; as a sister ship of the &quot;Titanic&quot; retrofitted as a hospital ship.

<text>Below is a list of [[airport]]s in [[France]], grouped by department and sorted by commune.

France is a country with its main territory in Western Europe, with several overseas territories and islands. The area known as metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, as well as from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

As of 2023, France is divided into eighteen administrative regions, of which thirteen are in metropolitan France (twelve on the continent, plus Corsica) and five are overseas. The regions are divided into 101 numbered departments which are in turn subdivided into 333 arrondissements (districts), 2,054 cantons (subdivisions) and 34,945 communes (municipalities).


== Airports in metropolitan France ==

Locations shown in bold are as per the airport&#x27;s AIP page. Most airports give two locations: the first is the city served, second is the city where the airport is located.

ICAO location identifiers are linked to each airport&#x27;s Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), where available, from &quot;Service d&#x27;information aéronautique&quot; (SIA), the French Aeronautical Information Service.

Airport names shown in bold indicate the airport has scheduled service on commercial airlines.

Links shown after airport name are intended to be moved as each airport&#x27;s Wikipedia article is created: WEB indicates a link to the airport&#x27;s website, UAF indicates a link to airport&#x27;s page at &quot;L&#x27;Union des Aéroports Français&quot;.

<text>Stephen P. H. Butler Leacock (30 December 1869 – 28 March 1944) was a Canadian teacher, political scientist, writer, and humourist. Between the years 1915 and 1925, he was the best-known English-speaking humourist in the world. He is known for his light humour along with criticisms of people&#x27;s follies.

== Early life ==
Stephen Leacock was born on 30 December 1869 in Swanmore, a village near Southampton in southern England. He was the third of the eleven children born to (Walter) Peter Leacock (b.1834), who was born and grew up at Oak Hill on the Isle of Wight, an estate that his grandfather had purchased after returning from Madeira where his family had made a fortune out of plantations and Leacock&#x27;s Madeira wine, founded in 1760. Stephen&#x27;s mother, Agnes, was born at Soberton, the youngest daughter by his second wife (Caroline Linton Palmer) of the Rev. Stephen Butler, of Bury Lodge, the Butler estate that overlooked the village of Hambledon, Hampshire. Stephen Butler (for whom Leacock was named), was the maternal grandson of Admiral James Richard Dacres and a brother of Sir Thomas Dacres Butler, Usher of the Black Rod. Leacock&#x27;s mother was the half-sister of Major Thomas Adair Butler, who won the Victoria Cross at the siege and capture of Lucknow in India.

Peter&#x27;s father, Thomas Murdock Leacock J.P., had already conceived plans eventually to send his son out to the colonies, but when he discovered that at age eighteen Peter had married Agnes Butler without his permission, almost immediately he shipped them out to South Africa where he had bought them a farm. The farm in South Africa failed and Stephen&#x27;s parents returned to Hampshire, where he was born. When Stephen was six, the family moved to Canada, where they settled on a farm near the village of Sutton, Ontario, and the shores of Lake Simcoe. Their farm in the township of Georgina was also unsuccessful, and the family was kept afloat by money sent from Leacock&#x27;s paternal grandfather. Stephen&#x27;s father, Peter, became an alcoholic; in the fall of 1878, Peter travelled west to Manitoba with his brother E.P. Leacock (the subject of Stephen&#x27;s book &quot;My Remarkable Uncle,&quot; published in 1942), leaving behind Agnes and the children.

Stephen Leacock, always of obvious intelligence, was sent by his grandfather to the elite private school of Upper Canada College in Toronto, also attended by his older brothers, where he was top of the class and was chosen as head boy. Leacock graduated in 1887, and returned home to find that his father had returned from Manitoba. Soon after, his father left the family again and never returned. There is some disagreement about what happened to Peter Leacock. One scenario is that he went to live in Argentina, while other sources indicate that he moved to Nova Scotia and changed his name to Lewis.

In 1887, seventeen-year-old Leacock started at University College at the University of Toronto, where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity. His first year was bankrolled by a small scholarship, but Leacock found he could not return to his studies the following year because of financial difficulties. He left university to work as a teacher—an occupation he disliked immensely—at Strathroy, Uxbridge and finally in Toronto. As a teacher at Upper Canada College, his &quot;alma mater&quot;, he was able simultaneously to attend classes at the University of Toronto and, in 1891, earn his degree through part-time studies. It was during this period that his first writing was published in &quot;The Varsity&quot;, a campus newspaper.

== Academic and political life ==

Disillusioned with teaching, in 1899 he began graduate studies at the University of Chicago under Thorstein Veblen, where he received a doctorate in political science and political economy. He moved from Chicago, Illinois, to Montreal, Quebec, where he eventually became the William Dow Professor of Political Economy and long-time chair of the Department of Economics and Political Science at McGill University.

He was closely associated with Sir Arthur Currie, former commander of the Canadian Corps in the Great War and principal of McGill from 1919 until his death in 1933. In fact, Currie had been a student observing Leacock&#x27;s practice teaching in Strathroy in 1888. In 1936, Leacock was forcibly retired by the McGill Board of Governors—an unlikely prospect had Currie lived.

Leacock was both a social conservative and a partisan Conservative. He opposed giving women the right to vote, and had a mixed record on non-English immigration, having written both in support of expanding immigration beyond Anglo-Saxons before World War II and in opposition to expanding Canadian immigration beyond Anglo-Saxons near the close of World War II. He was a staunch champion of the British Empire and the Imperial Federation Movement and went on lecture tours to further the cause. Despite his conservatism, he was a staunch advocate of social welfare legislation and wealth redistribution. He is considered today by some a complicated and controversial historical figure for his views and writings. He was a longtime believer in the superiority of the English and could be racist towards blacks and Indigenous peoples.

Although Prime Minister R. B. Bennett asked him to be a candidate for the 1935 Dominion election, Leacock declined the invitation. He did stump for local Conservative candidates at his summer home.

Leacock is mostly forgotten as an economist; &quot;What was for many years a virtually final judgement of Leacock&#x27;s scholarly work was pronounced by Harold Innis in a 1938 lecture at the University of Toronto. That lecture, which was intended to pay tribute to Leacock as one of the founders of Canadian social studies, was eventually published as his obituary in 1944 in the &quot;Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science&quot;. Innis glossed over Leacock&#x27;s economics in the article and largely dismissed his humorous writings. For a number of years, Leacock used John Stuart Mill&#x27;s text, &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot;, in his course at McGill entitled &quot;Elements of Political Economy&quot;. According to one source, Leacock&#x27;s light-hearted and increasingly superficial approach with his political science writings ensured that they are largely forgotten by the public and in academic circles.

== Literary life ==
Early in his career, Leacock turned to fiction, humour, and short reports to supplement (and ultimately exceed) his regular income. His stories, first published in magazines in Canada and the United States and later in novel form, became extremely popular around the world. It was said in 1911 that more people had heard of Stephen Leacock than had heard of Canada. Between the years 1915 and 1925, Leacock was the most popular humourist in the English-speaking world.

A humourist particularly admired by Leacock was Robert Benchley from New York. Leacock opened correspondence with Benchley, encouraging him in his work and importuning him to compile his work into a book. Benchley did so in 1922, and acknowledged the nagging from north of the border.

Near the end of his life, the US comedian Jack Benny recounted how he had been introduced to Leacock&#x27;s writing by Groucho Marx when they were both young vaudeville comedians. Benny acknowledged Leacock&#x27;s influence and, fifty years after first reading him, still considered Leacock one of his favourite comic writers. He was puzzled as to why Leacock&#x27;s work was no longer well known in the United States. His works can be described as a balancing act between cutting satire and sheer absurdity. He also wrote extensively on his chosen fields of study, political science and political economy. Leacock was professor, but in his works he reflected with wit and ingenuity on everyday situations.

During the summer months, Leacock lived at Old Brewery Bay, his summer estate in Orillia, across Lake Simcoe from where he was raised and also bordering Lake Couchiching. A working farm, Old Brewery Bay is now a museum and National Historic Site of Canada. Gossip provided by the local barber, Jefferson Short, provided Leacock with the material which would become &quot;Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town&quot; (1912), set in the thinly-disguised Mariposa.

Although he wrote learned articles and books related to his field of study, his political theory is now all but forgotten. Leacock was awarded the Royal Society of Canada&#x27;s Lorne Pierce Medal in 1937, nominally for his academic work.

&quot;The proper punishment for the Hohenzollerns, and the Habsburgs, and the Mecklenburgs, and the Muckendorfs, and all such puppets and princelings, is that they should be made to work; and not made to work in the glittering and glorious sense, as generals and chiefs of staff, and legislators, and land-barons, but in the plain and humble part of labourers looking for a job. (Leacock 1919: 9)&quot;

=== Memorial Medal for Humour ===
The Stephen Leacock Associates is a foundation chartered to preserve the literary legacy of Stephen Leacock, and oversee the annual award of the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour. It is a prestigious honour, given to encourage Canadian humour writing and awarded for the best at Canadian humour writing. The foundation was instituted in 1946 and awarded the first Leacock Medal in 1947. The presentation occurs in June each year at the Stephen Leacock Award Dinner, at the Geneva Park Conference Centre in Orillia, Ontario.

== Personal life ==
Leacock was born in England in 1869. His father, Peter Leacock, and his mother, Agnes Emma Butler Leacock, were both from well-to-do families. The family, eventually consisting of eleven children, immigrated to Canada in 1876, settling on a one hundred-acre farm in Sutton, Ontario. There Stephen was home-schooled until he was enrolled in Upper Canada College, Toronto. He became the head boy in 1887, and then entered the University of Toronto to study languages and literature. Despite completing two years of study in one year, he was forced to leave the university because his father had abandoned the family. Instead, Leacock enrolled in a three-month course at Strathroy Collegiate Institute to become a qualified high-school teacher.

His first appointment was at the then Uxbridge High School in Uxbridge, Ontario, but he was soon offered a post at Upper Canada College, where he remained from 1889 through 1899. At this time, he also resumed part-time studies at the University of Toronto, graduating with a B.A. in 1891. However, Leacock&#x27;s real interests were turning towards economics and political theory, and in 1899 he was accepted for postgraduate studies at the University of Chicago, where he earned his PhD in 1903.

In 1900 Leacock married Beatrix Hamilton, niece of Sir Henry Pellatt, who had built Casa Loma, the largest castle in North America. In 1915, after 15 years of marriage, the couple had their only child, Stephen Lushington Leacock. While Leacock doted on the boy, it soon became apparent that &quot;Stevie&quot; suffered from a lack of growth hormone. Growing to be only four feet tall, he had a love-hate relationship with Leacock, who tended to treat him like a child. Beatrix died in 1925 due to breast cancer. His son remained a bachelor and died in Sutton in 1974.

Leacock was offered a post at McGill University, where he remained until he retired in 1936. In 1906, he wrote Elements of Political Science, which remained a standard college textbook for the next twenty years and became his most profitable book. He also began public speaking and lecturing, and he took a year&#x27;s leave of absence in 1907 to speak throughout Canada on the subject of national unity. He typically spoke on national unity or the British Empire for the rest of his life.

Leacock began submitting articles to the Toronto humour magazine &quot;Grip&quot; in 1894, and soon was publishing many humorous articles in Canadian and US magazines. In 1910, he privately published the best of these as &quot;Literary Lapses&quot;. The book was spotted by a British publisher, John Lane, who brought out editions in London and New York, assuring Leacock&#x27;s future as a writer. This was confirmed by &quot;Literary Lapses&quot; (1910), &quot;Nonsense Novels&quot; (1911) – probably his best books of humorous sketches—and by the more sentimental favourite, &quot;Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town&quot; (1912). John Lane introduced the young cartoonist Annie Fish to illustrate his 1913 book &quot;Behind the Beyond&quot;. Leacock&#x27;s humorous style was reminiscent of Mark Twain and Charles Dickens at their sunniest – for example, in his book &quot;My Discovery of England&quot; (1922). However, his &quot;Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich&quot; (1914) is a darker collection that satirizes city life. Collections of sketches continued to follow almost annually at times, with a mixture of whimsy, parody, nonsense, and satire that was never bitter.

Leacock was enormously popular not only in Canada but in the United States and Britain. In later life, Leacock wrote on the art of humour writing and also published biographies of Twain and Dickens. After retirement, a lecture tour to western Canada led to his book My Discovery of the West: A Discussion of East and West in Canada (1937), for which he won the Governor General&#x27;s Award. He also won the Mark Twain medal and received a number of honorary doctorates. Other nonfiction books on Canadian topics followed and he began work on an autobiography. Leacock died of throat cancer in Toronto in 1944. A prize for the best humour writing in Canada was named after him, and his house at Orillia on the banks of Lake Couchiching became the Stephen Leacock Museum.

== Death and tributes ==

Predeceased by Trix (who had died of breast cancer in 1925), Leacock was survived by son Stevie (Stephen Lushington Leacock (1915–1974). In accordance with his wishes, after his death from throat cancer, Leacock was buried in the St George the Martyr Churchyard (St. George&#x27;s Church, Sibbald Point), Sutton, Ontario.

Shortly after his death, Barbara Nimmo, his niece, literary executor and benefactor, published two major posthumous works: &quot;Last Leaves&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Boy I Left Behind Me&quot; (1946). His summer cottage became derelict, and was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1958. It currently operates as a museum called the Stephen Leacock Museum National Historic Site.

In 1947, the Stephen Leacock Award was created to meet the best in Canadian literary humour. In 1969, the centennial of his birth, Canada Post issued a six-cent stamp with his image on it. The following year, the Stephen Leacock Centennial Committee had a plaque erected at his English birthplace and a mountain in Yukon was named after him.

A number of buildings in Canada are named after Leacock, including the Stephen Leacock Building at McGill University, Stephen Leacock Public School in Ottawa, a theatre in Keswick, Ontario, and a school Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute in Toronto.

== Adaptations ==
Two Leacock short stories have been adapted as National Film Board of Canada animated shorts by Gerald Potterton: &quot;My Financial Career&quot; and &quot;The Awful Fate of Melpomenus Jones&quot;. &quot;Sunshine Sketches&quot;, based on &quot;Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town&quot;, aired on CBC Television in 1952–1953; it was the first Canadian broadcast of an English-language dramatic series, as it debuted on the first night that television was broadcast in Toronto. In 2012, a screen adaptation based on &quot;Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town&quot; was aired on CBC Television to celebrate both the 75th anniversary of the CBC and the 100th anniversary of Leacock&#x27;s original collection of short stories. The recent screen adaptation featured Gordon Pinsent as a mature Leacock. In the summer of 2018, a live musical theatre adaptation by Craig Cassils and Robin Richardson based on &quot;Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town&quot; premiered at the Saskatchewan Festival of Words and the RuBarb TheatreFest in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

Canadian stage actor John Stark was most noted for &quot;An Evening with Stephen Leacock&quot;, a long-running one-man show. An album of his show, released on Tapestry Records in 1982, received a Juno Award nomination for Comedy Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1982. Stark also later produced a television film adaptation of &quot;Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town&quot;, as well as a stage musical based on Leacock&#x27;s short story &quot;The Great Election&quot;.

<doc id="167961" wikidata="Q204685" url="?curid=167961" title="John Gielgud">
<text>Sir Arthur John Gielgud ( ; 14 April 1904 – 21 May 2000) was an English actor and theatre director whose career spanned eight decades. With Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier, he was one of the trinity of actors who dominated the British stage for much of the 20th century. A member of the Terry family theatrical dynasty, he gained his first paid acting work as a junior member of his cousin Phyllis Neilson-Terry&#x27;s company in 1922. After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), he worked in repertory theatre and in the West End before establishing himself at the Old Vic as an exponent of Shakespeare in 1929–31.

During the 1930s Gielgud was a stage star in the West End and on Broadway, appearing in new works and classics. He began a parallel career as a director, and set up his own company at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, London. He was regarded by many as the finest Hamlet of his era, and was also known for high comedy roles such as John Worthing in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. In the 1950s Gielgud feared that his career was threatened when he was convicted and fined for a homosexual offence, but his colleagues and the public supported him loyally. When &quot;&quot; plays began to supersede traditional West End productions in the later 1950s he found no new suitable stage roles, and for several years he was best known in the theatre for his one-man Shakespeare show &quot;The Ages of Man&quot;. From the late 1960s he found new plays that suited him, by authors including Alan Bennett, David Storey and Harold Pinter.

During the first half of his career Gielgud did not take the cinema seriously. Though he made his first film in 1924, and had successes with &quot;The Good Companions&quot; (1933) and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953), he did not begin a regular film career until his sixties. He appeared in more than sixty films between &quot;Becket&quot; (1964), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination for playing Louis VII of France, and &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998). As the acid-tongued Hobson in &quot;Arthur&quot; (1981) he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His film work further earned him a Golden Globe Award and two BAFTAs.

Although largely indifferent to awards, Gielgud had the rare distinction of winning an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony. He was famous from the start of his career for his voice and his mastery of Shakespearean verse. He broadcast more than a hundred radio and television dramas between 1929 and 1994, and made commercial recordings of many plays, including ten of Shakespeare&#x27;s and three recordings from his own &quot;Ages of Man&quot;. Among his honours, he was knighted in 1953 and the Gielgud Theatre was named after him in 1994. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

==Life and career==
===Background and early years===
Gielgud was born on 14 April 1904, in South Kensington, London, the third of the four children of Frank Henry Gielgud and his second wife, Kate Terry-Gielgud, &quot;née&quot; Terry-Lewis. Gielgud&#x27;s elder brothers were Lewis, who became a senior official of the Red Cross and UNESCO, and Val, later head of BBC radio drama; his younger sister Eleanor became John&#x27;s secretary for many years. On his father&#x27;s side, Gielgud was of Lithuanian and Polish descent. The surname derives from Gelgaudiškis, a village in Lithuania. The Counts Gielgud had owned the Gelgaudiškis Manor on the Nemunas river, but their estates were confiscated after they took part in a failed uprising against Russian rule in 1830–31. Jan Gielgud took refuge in England with his family; one of his grandchildren was Frank Gielgud, whose maternal grandmother was the Polish actress, Aniela Aszpergerowa.

Frank married into a family with wide theatrical connections. His wife, who was on the stage until she married, was the daughter of the actress Kate Terry, and a member of the stage dynasty that included Ellen, Fred and Marion Terry, Mabel Terry-Lewis and Edith and Edward Gordon Craig. Frank had no theatrical ambitions and worked all his life as a stockbroker in the City of London.

In 1912, aged eight, Gielgud went to Hillside preparatory school in Surrey as his elder brothers had done. For a child with no interest in sport he acquitted himself reasonably well in cricket and rugby for the school. In class, he hated mathematics, was fair at classics, and excelled at English and divinity. Hillside encouraged his interest in drama, and he played several leading roles in school productions, including Mark Antony in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;.

After Hillside, Lewis and Val had won scholarships to Eton and Rugby, respectively; lacking their academic achievement, John failed to secure such a scholarship. He was sent as a day boy to Westminster School where, as he later said, he had access to the West End &quot;in time to touch the fringe of the great century of the theatre&quot;. He saw Sarah Bernhardt act, Adeline Genée dance and Albert Chevalier, Vesta Tilley and Marie Lloyd perform in the music halls. The school choir sang in services at Westminster Abbey, which appealed to his fondness for ritual. He showed talent at sketching, and for a while thought of scenic design as a possible career.

The young Gielgud&#x27;s father took him to concerts, which he liked, and galleries and museums, &quot;which bored me rigid&quot;. Both parents were keen theatregoers, but did not encourage their children to follow an acting career. Val Gielgud recalled, &quot;Our parents looked distinctly sideways at the Stage as a means of livelihood, and when John showed some talent for drawing his father spoke crisply of the advantages of an architect&#x27;s office.&quot; On leaving Westminster in 1921, Gielgud persuaded his reluctant parents to let him take drama lessons on the understanding that if he was not self-supporting by the age of twenty-five he would seek an office post.

===First acting experience===

Gielgud, aged seventeen, joined a private drama school run by Constance Benson, wife of the actor-manager Sir Frank Benson. On the new boy&#x27;s first day Lady Benson remarked on his physical awkwardness: &quot;she said I walked like a cat with rickets. It dealt a severe blow to my conceit, which was a good thing.&quot; Before and after joining the school he played in several amateur productions, and in November 1921 made his debut with a professional company, though he himself was not paid. He played the Herald in &quot;Henry V&quot; at the Old Vic; he had one line to speak and, he recalled, spoke it badly. He was kept on for the rest of the season in walk-on parts in &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Wat Tyler&quot; and &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, with no lines.

Gielgud&#x27;s first substantial engagement came through his family. In 1922 his cousin Phyllis Neilson-Terry invited him to tour in J. B. Fagan&#x27;s &quot;The Wheel&quot; as understudy, bit-part player and assistant stage manager, an invitation he accepted. A colleague, recognising that the young man had talent but lacked technique, recommended him to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Gielgud was awarded a scholarship to the academy and trained there throughout 1923 under Kenneth Barnes, Helen Haye and Claude Rains.

The actor-manager Nigel Playfair, a friend of Gielgud&#x27;s family, saw him in a student presentation of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot;. Playfair was impressed and cast him as Felix, the poet-butterfly, in the British premiere of the Čapek brothers&#x27; &quot;The Insect Play&quot;. Gielgud later said that he made a poor impression in the part: &quot;I am surprised that the audience did not throw things at me.&quot; The critics were cautious but not hostile to the play; it did not attract the public and closed after a month. While still continuing his studies at RADA, Gielgud appeared again for Playfair in &quot;RobertE Lee&quot; by John Drinkwater. After leaving the academy at the end of 1923 Gielgud played a Christmas season as Charley in &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; in the West End, and then joined Fagan&#x27;s repertory company at the Oxford Playhouse.

Gielgud was in the Oxford company in January and February 1924, from October 1924 to the end of January 1925, and in August 1925. He played a wide range of parts in classics and modern plays, greatly increasing his technical abilities in the process. The role he most enjoyed was Trofimov in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, his first experience of Chekhov: &quot;It was the first time I ever went out on stage feeling that perhaps, after all, I could really be an actor.&quot;

===Early West End roles===

Between Gielgud&#x27;s first two Oxford seasons, the producer Barry Jackson cast him as Romeo to the Juliet of Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies at the Regent&#x27;s Theatre, London, in May 1924. The production was not a great success, but the two performers became close friends and frequently worked together throughout their careers. Gielgud made his screen debut during 1924 as Daniel Arnault in Walter Summers&#x27;s silent film &quot;Who Is the Man?&quot; (1924).

In May 1925 the Oxford production of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; was brought to the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. Gielgud again played Trofimov. His distinctive speaking voice attracted attention and led to work for BBC Radio, which his biographer Sheridan Morley calls &quot;a medium he made his own for seventy years&quot;. In the same year Noël Coward chose Gielgud as his understudy in his play &quot;The Vortex&quot;. For the last month of the West End run Gielgud took over Coward&#x27;s role of Nicky Lancaster, the drug-addicted son of a nymphomaniac mother. It was in Gielgud&#x27;s words &quot;a highly-strung, nervous, hysterical part which depended a lot upon emotion&quot;. He found it tiring to play because he had not yet learned how to pace himself, but he thought it &quot;a thrilling engagement because it led to so many great things afterwards&quot;.

The success of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; led to what one critic called a &quot;Chekhov boom&quot; in British theatres, and Gielgud was among its leading players. As Konstantin in &quot;The Seagull&quot; in October 1925 he impressed the Russian director Theodore Komisarjevsky, who cast him as Tusenbach in the British premiere of &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. The production received enthusiastic reviews, and Gielgud&#x27;s highly praised performance enhanced his reputation as a potential star. There followed three years of mixed fortunes for him, with successes in fringe productions, but West End stardom was elusive.

In 1926 the producer Basil Dean offered Gielgud the lead role, Lewis Dodd, in a dramatisation of Margaret Kennedy&#x27;s best-selling novel, &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot;. Before rehearsals began Dean found that a bigger star than Gielgud was available, namely Coward, to whom he gave the part. Gielgud had an enforceable contractual claim to the role, but Dean, a notorious bully, was a powerful force in British theatre. Intimidated, Gielgud accepted the position of understudy, with a guarantee that he would take over the lead from Coward when the latter, who disliked playing in long runs, left. In the event Coward, who had been overworking, suffered a nervous collapse three weeks after the opening night, and Gielgud played the lead for the rest of the run. The play ran for nearly a year in London and then went on tour.

By this time Gielgud was earning enough to leave the family home and take a small flat in the West End. He had his first serious romantic relationship, living with John Perry, an unsuccessful actor, later a writer, who remained a lifelong friend after their affair ended. Morley makes the point that, like Coward, Gielgud&#x27;s principal passion was the stage; both men had casual dalliances, but were more comfortable with &quot;low-maintenance&quot; long-term partners who did not impede their theatrical work and ambitions.

In 1928 Gielgud made his Broadway debut as the Grand Duke Alexander in Alfred Neumann&#x27;s &quot;The Patriot&quot;. The play was a failure, closing after a week, but Gielgud liked New York and received favourable reviews from critics including Alexander Woollcott and Brooks Atkinson. After returning to London he starred in a succession of short runs, including Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot; with Mrs Patrick Campbell (1928), and Reginald Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;The Lady with a Lamp&quot; (1929) with Edith Evans and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies. In 1928 he made his second film, &quot;The Clue of the New Pin&quot;. This, billed as &quot;the first British full-length talkie&quot;, was an adaptation of an Edgar Wallace mystery story; Gielgud played a young scoundrel who commits two murders and very nearly a third before he himself is killed.

===Old Vic===

In 1929 Harcourt Williams, newly appointed as director of productions at the Old Vic, invited Gielgud to join the company for the forthcoming season. The Old Vic, in an unfashionable area of London south of the Thames, was run by Lilian Baylis to offer plays and operas to a mostly working-class audience at low ticket prices. She paid her performers very modest wages, but the theatre was known for its unrivalled repertory of classics, mostly Shakespeare, and Gielgud was not the first West End star to take a large pay cut to work there. It was, in Morley&#x27;s words, the place to learn Shakespearean technique and try new ideas.

During his first season at the Old Vic, Gielgud played Romeo to the Juliet of Adele Dixon, Antonio in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, Cleante in &quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot;, the title role in &quot;Richard II&quot;, and Oberon in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. His Romeo was not well reviewed, but as Richard II Gielgud was recognised by critics as a Shakespearean actor of undoubted authority. The reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; commented on his sensitiveness, strength and firmness, and called his performance &quot;work of genuine distinction, not only in its grasp of character, but in its control of language&quot;. Later in the season he was cast as Mark Antony in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, Orlando in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, the Emperor in &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; and the title role in Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;The Man with the Flower in His Mouth&quot;.

In April 1930 Gielgud finished the season playing Hamlet. Williams&#x27;s production used the complete text of the play. This was regarded as a radical innovation; extensive cuts had been customary for earlier productions. A running time of nearly five hours did not dampen the enthusiasm of the public, the critics or the acting profession. Sybil Thorndike said, &quot;I never hoped to see Hamlet played as in one&#x27;s dreams ... I&#x27;ve had an evening of being swept right off my feet into another life – far more real than the life I live in, and moved, moved beyond words.&quot; The production gained such a reputation that the Old Vic began to attract large numbers of West End theatregoers. Demand was so great that the cast moved to the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, in Shaftesbury Avenue, where Williams staged the piece with the text discreetly shortened. The effect of the cuts was to give the title role even more prominence. Gielgud&#x27;s Hamlet was richly praised by the critics. Ivor Brown called it &quot;a tremendous performance ... the best Hamlet of [my] experience&quot;. James Agate wrote, &quot;I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that it is the high water-mark of English Shakespearean acting of our time.&quot;
Hamlet was a role with which Gielgud was associated over the next decade and more. After the run at the Queen&#x27;s finished he turned to another part for which he became well known, John Worthing in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. Gielgud&#x27;s biographer Jonathan Croall comments that the two roles illustrated two sides of the actor&#x27;s personality: on the one hand the romantic and soulful Hamlet, and on the other the witty and superficial Worthing. The formidable Lady Bracknell was played by his aunt, Mabel Terry-Lewis. &quot;The Times&quot; observed, &quot;Mr Gielgud and Miss Terry-Lewis together are brilliant ... they have the supreme grace of always allowing Wilde to speak in his own voice.&quot;

Returning to the Old Vic for the 1930–31 season, Gielgud found several changes to the company. Donald Wolfit, who loathed him and was himself disliked by his colleagues, was dropped, as was Adele Dixon. Gielgud was uncertain of the suitability of the most prominent new recruit, Ralph Richardson, but Williams was sure that after this season Gielgud would move on; he saw Richardson as a potential replacement. The two actors had little in common. Richardson recalled, &quot;He was a kind of brilliant butterfly, while I was a very gloomy sort of boy&quot;, and &quot;I found his clothes extravagant, I found his conversation flippant. He was the New Young Man of his time and I didn&#x27;t like him.&quot; The first production of the season was &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, in which Gielgud as Hotspur had the best of the reviews. Richardson&#x27;s notices, and the relationship of the two leading men, improved markedly when Gielgud, who was playing Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, helped Richardson with his performance as Caliban:

The friendship and professional association lasted for more than fifty years, until the end of Richardson&#x27;s life. Gielgud&#x27;s other roles in this season were Lord Trinket in &quot;The Jealous Wife&quot;, Richard II again, Antony in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, Malvolio in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Sergius in &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, Benedick in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; – another role for which he became celebrated – and he concluded the season as King Lear. His performance divided opinion. &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;It is a mountain of a part, and at the end of the evening the peak remains unscaled&quot;; in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, however, Brown wrote that Gielgud &quot;is a match for the thunder, and at length takes the Dover road with a broken tranquillity that allowed every word of the King&#x27;s agony to be clear as well as poignant&quot;.

===West End star===

Returning to the West End, Gielgud starred in J. B.Priestley&#x27;s &quot;The Good Companions&quot;, adapted for the stage by the author and Edward Knoblock. The production ran from May 1931 for 331 performances, and Gielgud described it as his first real taste of commercial success. He played Inigo Jollifant, a young schoolmaster who abandons teaching to join a travelling theatre troupe. This crowd-pleaser drew disapproval from the more austere reviewers, who felt Gielgud should be doing something more demanding, but he found playing a conventional juvenile lead had challenges of its own and helped him improve his technique. During the run of the play he made another film, &quot;Insult&quot; (1932), a melodrama about the French Foreign Legion, and he starred in a cinema version of &quot;The Good Companions&quot; in 1933, with Jessie Matthews. A letter to a friend reveals Gielgud&#x27;s view of film acting: &quot;There is talk of my doing Inigo in the film of &quot;The Good Companions&quot;, which appals my soul but appeals to my pocket.&quot; In his first volume of memoirs, published in 1939, Gielgud devoted two pages to describing the things about filming that he detested. Unlike his contemporaries Richardson and Laurence Olivier, he made few films until after the Second World War, and did not establish himself as a prominent film actor until many years after that. As he put it in 1994, &quot;I was stupid enough to toss my head and stick to the stage while watching Larry and Ralph sign lucrative Korda contracts.&quot;

In 1932 Gielgud turned to directing. At the invitation of George Devine, the president of the Oxford University Dramatic Society, Gielgud took charge of a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; by the society, featuring two guest stars: Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet and Edith Evans as the Nurse. The rest of the cast were students, led by Christopher Hassall as Romeo, and included Devine, William Devlin and Terence Rattigan. The experience was satisfactory to Gielgud: he enjoyed the attentions of the undergraduates, had a brief affair with one of them, James Lees-Milne, and was widely praised for his inspiring direction and his protégés&#x27; success with the play. Already notorious for his innocent slips of the tongue (he called them &quot;Gielgoofs&quot;), in a speech after the final performance he referred to Ashcroft and Evans as &quot;Two leading ladies, the like of whom I hope I shall never meet again&quot;.

During the rest of 1932 Gielgud played in a new piece, &quot;Musical Chairs&quot; by Ronald Mackenzie, and directed one new and one classic play, &quot;Strange Orchestra&quot; by Rodney Ackland in the West End, and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; at the Old Vic, with Malcolm Keen as Shylock and Ashcroft as Portia. In 1932 he starred in &quot;Richard of Bordeaux&quot; by Elizabeth MacKintosh. This, a retelling in modern language of the events of &quot;Richard II&quot;, was greeted as the most successful historical play since Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot; nine years earlier, more faithful to the events than Shakespeare had been. After an uncertain start in the West End it rapidly became a sell-out hit and played in London and on tour over the next three years.

Between seasons of &quot;Richard&quot;, in 1934 Gielgud returned to &quot;Hamlet&quot; in London and on tour, directing and playing the title role. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Charles Morgan wrote, &quot;I have never before heard the rhythm and verse and the naturalness of speech so gently combined. ... If I see a better performance of this play than this before I die, it will be a miracle.&quot; Morley writes that junior members of the cast such as Alec Guinness and Frith Banbury would gather in the wings every night &quot;to watch what they seemed intuitively already to know was to be the Hamlet of their time&quot;.

The following year Gielgud staged perhaps his most famous Shakespeare production, a &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in which he co-starred with Ashcroft and Olivier. Gielgud had spotted Olivier&#x27;s potential and gave him a major step up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they exchanged roles. As at Oxford, Ashcroft and Evans were Juliet and the nurse. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running at the New Theatre for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare&#x27;s verse, comparing it with his co-star&#x27;s mastery of the poetry. The friendship between the two men was prickly, on Olivier&#x27;s side, for the rest of his life.
In May 1936 Gielgud played Trigorin in &quot;The Seagull&quot;, with Evans as Arkadina and Ashcroft as Nina. Komisarjevsky directed, which made rehearsals difficult as Ashcroft, with whom he had been living, had just left him. Nonetheless, Morley writes, the critical reception was ecstatic. In the same year Gielgud made his last pre-war film, co-starring with Madeleine Carroll in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Secret Agent&quot;. The director&#x27;s insensitivity to actors made Gielgud nervous and further increased his dislike of filming. The two stars were praised for their performances, but Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;preoccupation with incident&quot; was felt by critics to make the leading roles one-dimensional, and the laurels went to Peter Lorre as Gielgud&#x27;s deranged assistant.

From September 1936 to February 1937 Gielgud played Hamlet in North America, opening in Toronto before moving to New York and Boston. He was nervous about starring on Broadway for the first time, particularly as it became known that the popular actor Leslie Howard was to appear there in a rival production of the play. When Gielgud opened at the Empire Theatre in October the reviews were mixed, but, as the actor wrote to his mother, the audience response was extraordinary. &quot;They stay at the end and shout every night and the stage door is beset by fans.&quot; Howard&#x27;s production opened in November; it was, in Gielgud&#x27;s words, a débâcle, and the &quot;battle of the Hamlets&quot; heralded in the New York press was over almost as soon as it had begun. Howard&#x27;s version closed within a month; the run of Gielgud&#x27;s production beat Broadway records for the play.

===Queen&#x27;s Theatre company===
After his return from America in February 1937 Gielgud starred in &quot;He Was Born Gay&quot; by Emlyn Williams. This romantic tragedy about French royalty after the Revolution was quite well received during its pre-London tour, but was savaged by the critics in the West End. &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;This is one of those occasions on which criticism does not stand about talking, but rubs its eyes and withdraws hastily with an embarrassed, incredulous, and uncomprehending blush. What made Mr Emlyn Williams write this play or Mr Gielgud and Miss Ffrangcon-Davies appear in it is not to be understood.&quot; The play closed after twelve performances. Its failure, so soon after his Shakespearean triumphs, prompted Gielgud to examine his career and his life. His domestic relationship with Perry was comfortable but unexciting, he saw no future in a film career, and the Old Vic could not afford to stage the classics on the large scale to which he aspired. He decided that he must form his own company to play Shakespeare and other classic plays in the West End.

Gielgud invested £5,000, most of his earnings from the American &quot;Hamlet&quot;; Perry, who had family money, put in the same sum. From September 1937 to April 1938 Gielgud was the tenant of the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, where he presented a season consisting of &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. His company included Harry Andrews, Peggy Ashcroft, Glen Byam Shaw, George Devine, Michael Redgrave and Harcourt Williams, with Angela Baddeley and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies as guests. His own roles were King Richard, Joseph Surface, Vershinin and Shylock. Gielgud&#x27;s performances drew superlatives from reviewers and colleagues. Agate considered his Richard II, &quot;probably the best piece of Shakespearean acting on the English stage today&quot;. Olivier said that Gielgud&#x27;s Joseph Surface was &quot;the best light comedy performance I&#x27;ve ever seen, or ever shall see&quot;.

The venture did not make much money, and in July 1938 Gielgud turned to more conventional West End enterprises, in unconventional circumstances. He directed &quot;Spring Meeting&quot;, a farce by Perry and Molly Keane, presented by Binkie Beaumont, for whom Perry had just left Gielgud. Somehow the three men remained on excellent terms. In September of the same year Gielgud appeared in Dodie Smith&#x27;s sentimental comedy &quot;Dear Octopus&quot;. The following year he directed and appeared in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; at the Globe, with Evans playing Lady Bracknell for the first time. They were gratified when Allan Aynesworth, who had played Algernon in the 1895 premiere, said that the new production &quot;caught the gaiety and exactly the right atmosphere. It&#x27;s all delightful!&quot;

===War and post-war===

At the start of the Second World War Gielgud volunteered for active service, but was told that men of his age, thirty-five, would not be wanted for at least six months. The government quickly came to the view that most actors would do more good performing to entertain the troops and the general public than serving, whether suitable or not, in the armed forces.

Gielgud directed Michael Redgrave in a 1940 London production of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; for the Glyndebourne Festival. This was a chaotic affair: Gielgud&#x27;s direction confused his star, and when Redgrave lost his voice Gielgud had to step in and sing the role as best he could. Gielgud felt that something serious or even solemn was necessary for wartime London, where most entertainment was light-hearted. Together with Harley Granville-Barker and Guthrie he reopened the Old Vic with Shakespeare. His King Lear once again divided the critics, but his Prospero was a considerable success. He played the role quite differently from his attempt on the same stage in 1930: in place of the &quot;manic conjurer&quot; his Prospero was &quot;very far from the usual mixture of Father Christmas, a Colonial Bishop, and the President of the Magicians&#x27; Union ... a clear, arresting picture of a virile Renaissance notable&quot;, according to Brown. The critics singled out, among the other players, Jack Hawkins as Caliban, Marius Goring as Ariel, Jessica Tandy as Miranda and Alec Guinness as Ferdinand.

Following the example of several of his stage colleagues, Gielgud joined tours of military camps. He gave recitals of prose and poetry, and acted in a triple bill of short plays, including two from Coward&#x27;s &quot;Tonight at 8.30&quot;, but he found at first that less highbrow performers like Beatrice Lillie were better than he at entertaining the troops. He returned to filming in 1940, as Disraeli in Thorold Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;The Prime Minister&quot;. In this morale-boosting film he portrayed the politician from ages thirty to seventy; this was, in Morley&#x27;s view, the first time he seemed at home before the camera. Gielgud made no more films for the next ten years; he turned down the role of Julius Caesar in the 1945 film of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; with Vivien Leigh. He and Leigh were close friends, and Shaw tried hard to persuade him to play the part, but Gielgud had taken a strong dislike to the director, Gabriel Pascal. Caesar was eventually played by Gielgud&#x27;s former teacher, Claude Rains.

Throughout 1941 and 1942 Gielgud worked continually, in Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Dear Brutus&quot;, another &quot;Importance of Being Earnest&quot; in the West End, and &quot;Macbeth&quot; on tour. Returning, with more assurance than before, to entertaining the troops, he so far departed from his classical style as to join Lillie and Michael Wilding singing a comic trio. His 1943 revival of William Congreve&#x27;s &quot;Love for Love&quot; on tour and then in London received high praise from reviewers. In 1944 he was approached by Ralph Richardson, who had been asked by the governors of the Old Vic to form a new company. Unwilling to take sole charge, Richardson proposed a managing triumvirate of Gielgud, Olivier and himself. Gielgud declined: &quot;It would be a disaster, you would have to spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me.&quot;

A 1944–45 season at the Haymarket for Beaumont included a Hamlet that many considered his finest. Agate wrote, &quot;Mr Gielgud is now completely and authoritatively master of this tremendous part... I hold that this is, and is likely to remain, the best Hamlet of our time.&quot; Also in the season were &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; and the first major revival of &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; (1945). These productions attracted much praise, but at this point in his career Gielgud was somewhat overshadowed by his old colleagues. Olivier was celebrated for his recent film of &quot;Henry V&quot;, and with Richardson (and John Burrell in Gielgud&#x27;s stead) was making the Old Vic &quot;the most famous theatre in the Anglo-Saxon world&quot; according to the critic Harold Hobson.

In May 1945 Gielgud bought No.16, Cowley Street, a Georgian townhouse in Westminster, central London, which remained his home for the next 31 years. In late 1945 and early 1946 he toured for ENSA in the Middle and Far East with &quot;Hamlet&quot; and Coward&#x27;s &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;. During this tour he played Hamlet on stage for the last time. He was Raskolnikoff in a stage version of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, in the West End in 1946 and on Broadway the following year. Agate thought it the best thing Gielgud had done so far, other than Hamlet. Between these two engagements Gielgud toured North America in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and &quot;Love for Love&quot;. Edith Evans was tired of the role of Lady Bracknell, and refused to join him; Margaret Rutherford played the part to great acclaim. Gielgud was in demand as a director, with six productions in 1948–49. They included &quot;The Heiress&quot; in 1949, when he was brought in at the last moment to direct Richardson and Ashcroft, saving what seemed a doomed production; it ran for 644 performances. His last big hit of the 1940s was as Thomas Mendip in &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Not for Burning&quot;, which he also directed. The London cast included the young Claire Bloom and Richard Burton, who went with Gielgud when he took the piece to the US the following year.

===1950s – Film success and personal crisis===
At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, Gielgud did much to reclaim his position as a leading Shakespearean. His cold, unsympathetic Angelo in Peter Brook&#x27;s production of &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; (1950) showed the public a new, naturalistic manner in his playing. He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; in 1952, was much less successful, with poor notices for the star and worse ones for the director.

In 1953 Gielgud made his first Hollywood film, the sole classical actor in Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, playing Cassius. Marlon Brando (Mark Antony) was in awe of him, and James Mason (Brutus) was disheartened at Gielgud&#x27;s seemingly effortless skill. Gielgud, for his part, felt he learned much about film technique from Mason. Gielgud enjoyed his four-month stay in California, not least, as Morley comments, for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality.

Returning to London later in 1953 Gielgud took over management of the Lyric, Hammersmith, for a classical season of &quot;Richard II&quot;, Congreve&#x27;s &quot;The Way of the World&quot;, and Thomas Otway&#x27;s &quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot;, directing the first, acting in the last, and doing both in the second. Feeling he was too old for Richard, he cast the young Paul Scofield; both the actor and the production were a critical and commercial success. During the season Gielgud was knighted in the 1953 Coronation Honours.

On the evening of 20 October 1953, Gielgud, usually highly discreet about casual sex, was arrested in Chelsea for cottaging (i.e. cruising for sex in a public lavatory). Until the 1960s sexual activity of any kind between men was illegal in Britain. The Home Secretary of the day, David Maxwell Fyfe, was fervently homophobic, urging the police to arrest anyone who contravened the Victorian laws against homosexuality. Gielgud was fined; when the press reported the story, he thought his disgrace would end his career. When the news broke he was in Liverpool on the pre-London tour of a new play, &quot;A Day by the Sea&quot;. According to the biographer Richard Huggett, Gielgud was so paralysed by nerves that the prospect of going onstage as usual seemed impossible, but his fellow players, led by Sybil Thorndike, encouraged him:

His career was safe, but the episode briefly affected Gielgud&#x27;s health; he suffered a nervous breakdown some months afterwards. He never spoke publicly about the incident, and it was quickly sidelined by the press and politely ignored by writers during his lifetime. Privately he made donations to gay campaign groups, but did not endorse them in public. In his later years he said to the actor Simon Callow, &quot;I do admire people like you and Ian McKellen for coming out, but I can&#x27;t be doing with that myself.&quot;

Between December 1953 and June 1955 Gielgud concentrated on directing and did not appear on stage. His productions ranged from a revival of &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; with John Mills to &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; with Ffrangcon-Davies, and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; with Olivier. His return to the stage was in a production of &quot;King Lear&quot;, which was badly hampered by costumes and scenery by Isamu Noguchi that the critics found ludicrous. A revival of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; with Ashcroft in 1955 was much better received; in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Philip Hope-Wallace called it &quot;Shakespearean comedy for once perfectly realised&quot;. In 1955 Gielgud made his second appearance in a film of Shakespeare, portraying Clarence in Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;.

In the second half of the 1950s Gielgud&#x27;s career was in the doldrums as far as new plays were concerned. British theatre was moving away from the West End glamour of Beaumont&#x27;s productions to more &quot;&quot; works. Olivier had a great success in John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot; in 1957, but Gielgud was not in tune with the new wave of writers. He remained in demand as a Shakespearean, but there were few new plays suitable for him. He directed and played the lead in Coward&#x27;s &quot;Nude with Violin&quot; in 1956, which was dismissed by the critics as old-fashioned, though it ran for more than a year. He made two film appearances, playing a cameo comedy scene with Coward as a prospective manservant in Michael Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956), and as the father of Elizabeth Barrett Browning in Sidney Franklin&#x27;s 1957 remake of &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;. He did not consider his performance as the tyrannical father convincing, and confessed that he undertook it only for the large fee (&quot;it will set me up for a couple of years&quot;) and to keep him before the public in America, where he had not performed for over four years.
During 1957 Gielgud directed Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;The Trojans&quot; at Covent Garden and played Prospero at Drury Lane, but the production central to his career over the late 1950s and into the 1960s was his one-man show &quot;The Ages of Man&quot;. He first appeared in this in 1956 and revived it every year until 1967. It was an anthology of Shakespearean speeches and sonnets, compiled by George Rylands, in which, wearing modern evening clothes on a plain stage, Gielgud recited the verses, with his own linking commentary. He performed it all over Britain, mainland Europe, Australasia and the US, including a performance at the White House in 1965. He found there were advantages to performing solo: &quot;You&#x27;ve no idea how much easier it is without a Juliet. When there&#x27;s a beautiful girl above you on a balcony, or lying on a tomb with candles round her, naturally the audience look at her the whole time, and Romeo has to pull out all the stops to get any attention.&quot; His performance on Broadway won him a Special Tony Award in 1959, and an audio recording in 1979 received a Grammy Award. He made many other recordings, both before and after this, including ten Shakespeare plays.

Gielgud continued to try, without much success, to find new plays that suited him as an actor, but his direction of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s first play, &quot;Five Finger Exercise&quot; (1958), received acclaim. While in the US for the Shaffer play, Gielgud revived &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, this time with Margaret Leighton as his Beatrice. Most of the New York critics praised the production, and they all praised the co-stars. He gave his first performances on television during 1959, in Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Browning Version&quot; for CBS and N. C. Hunter&#x27;s &quot;A Day by the Sea&quot; for ITV. He appeared in more than fifty more plays on television over the next four decades.

===1960s===
During the early 1960s Gielgud had more successes as a director than as an actor. He directed the first London performance of Britten&#x27;s opera &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1961) at Covent Garden and Hugh Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;Big Fish, Little Fish&quot; on Broadway, the latter winning him a Tony for Best Direction of a Play in 1961. His performance as Othello at Stratford in the same year was less successful; Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s production was thought ponderous and Gielgud &quot;singularly unvehement&quot;. As Gaev in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; to the Ranevskaya of Ashcroft he had the best of the notices; his co-star and the production received mixed reviews. The following year Gielgud directed Richardson in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, first at the Haymarket and then on a North American tour, which he joined as, in his words, &quot;the oldest Joseph Surface in the business&quot;.

In 1962 Gielgud met Martin Hensler (1932–99), an interior designer exiled from Hungary. He was temperamental, and Gielgud&#x27;s friends often found him difficult, but the two became a long-term couple and lived together until Hensler&#x27;s death. Under his influence Gielgud moved his main residence from central London to the South Pavilion of Wotton House at Wotton Underwood in Buckinghamshire.

Gielgud received an Oscar nomination for his performance as King Louis VII of France in &quot;Becket&quot; (1964), with Richard Burton in the title role. Morley comments, &quot;A minor but flashy role, this had considerable and long-lasting importance; his unrivalled theatrical dignity could greatly enhance a film.&quot; In 1964 Gielgud directed Burton in &quot;Hamlet&quot; on Broadway. Burton&#x27;s performance received reviews ranging from polite to hostile, but the production was a box-office success, and a film was made of it. Gielgud finally began to take the cinema seriously, for financial and sometimes artistic reasons. He told his agent to accept any reasonable film offers. His films of the mid-1960s were Tony Richardson&#x27;s &quot;The Loved One&quot; (1965), which Croall termed a disaster despite later acclaim, and Orson Welles&#x27;s Falstaff film &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; (1966), which was unsuccessful at the time but has since been recognised as &quot;one of the best, albeit most eccentric, of all Shakespearean movies&quot;, according to Morley.

Much of Gielgud&#x27;s theatre work in the later 1960s was as a director: Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Ivanov&quot; at the Phoenix in London and the Shubert in New York, Peter Ustinov&#x27;s &quot;Half Way Up the Tree&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at the Coliseum. One potentially outstanding acting role, Ibsen&#x27;s Bishop Nicholas, fell through in 1967 when Olivier, with whom he was to co-star at the National Theatre in &quot;The Pretenders&quot;, was ill. Gielgud played Orgon in &quot;Tartuffe&quot; and the title role in Seneca&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus&quot; during the National&#x27;s 1967–68 season, but according to Croall neither production was satisfactory. After this, Gielgud at last found a modern role that suited him and which he played to acclaim: the Headmaster in Alan Bennett&#x27;s first play, &quot;Forty Years On&quot; (1968). The notices for both play and star were excellent. John Barber wrote in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that &quot;Gielgud dominates all with an unexpected caricature of a mincing pedant, his noble features blurred so as to mimic a fussed and fatuous egghead. From the great mandarin of the theatre, a delicious comic creation.&quot;

Having finally embraced film-making, Gielgud appeared in six films in 1967–69. His most substantial role was Lord Raglan in Tony Richardson&#x27;s &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;. His other roles, in films including Michael Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; (1968) as a fictional pope and Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969) as Count Leopold Berchtold, were cameo appearances in character roles.

===1970s – Career revival===

In 1970 Gielgud played another modern role in which he had great success; he joined Ralph Richardson at the Royal Court in Chelsea in David Storey&#x27;s &quot;Home&quot;. The play is set in the gardens of a nursing home for mental patients, though this is not clear at first. The two elderly men converse in a desultory way, are joined and briefly enlivened by two more extrovert female patients, are slightly scared by another male patient, and are then left together, conversing even more emptily. The &quot;Punch&quot; critic Jeremy Kingston wrote:

The play transferred to the West End and then to Broadway. In &quot;The New York Times&quot; Clive Barnes wrote, &quot;The two men, bleakly examining the little nothingness of their lives, are John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson giving two of the greatest performances of two careers that have been among the glories of the English-speaking theater.&quot; The original cast recorded the play for television in 1972.

In the first half of the decade Gielgud made seven films and six television dramas. Morley describes his choice as indiscriminate, but singles out for praise his performances in 1974 as the Old Cardinal in Joseph Losey&#x27;s &quot;Galileo&quot; and the manservant Beddoes in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;. In a 1971 BBC presentation of James Elroy Flecker&#x27;s &quot;Hassan&quot;, Gielgud played the Caliph to Richardson&#x27;s Hassan. The critic of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; said that viewers would &quot;shiver at a towering performance by Gielgud, as a Caliph with all the purring beauty and ruthlessness of a great golden leopard&quot;. In the theatre Gielgud directed Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot; and Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Constant Wife&quot; (both 1973, London and 1974, New York). His final production as a director was Pinero&#x27;s &quot;The Gay Lord Quex&quot; (1975).

Gielgud continued his long stage association with Richardson in Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (1975), directed by Hall at the National. Richardson played Hirst, a prosperous but isolated and vulnerable author, and Gielgud was Spooner, a down-at-heel sponger and opportunist. Hall found the play &quot;extremely funny and also extremely bleak&quot;. The production was a critical and box-office success and, over a period of three years, played at the Old Vic, in the West End, at the Lyttelton Theatre in the new National Theatre complex, on Broadway and on television. In Julian Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1977) at the National, Gielgud was warmly praised by reviewers; he reprised the role at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in the West End in 1978 and on tour the following year.

In the latter part of the decade Gielgud worked more for cinema and television than on stage. His film work included what Morley calls &quot;his most embarrassing professional appearance&quot;, in &quot;Caligula&quot; (1979), Gore Vidal&#x27;s story of Ancient Rome, spiced with pornographic scenes. In Gielgud&#x27;s ten other films from this period, his most substantial role was Clive Langham in Alain Resnais&#x27; &quot;Providence&quot; (1977). Gielgud thought it &quot;by far the most exciting film I have ever made&quot;. He won a New York Film Critics Circle award for his performance as a dying author, &quot;drunk half the time ... throwing bottles about, and roaring a lot of very coarse dialogue&quot;. His other film parts included the Head Master of Eton in Jack Gold&#x27;s &quot;Aces High&quot; (1976) and Tomlinson in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;The Human Factor&quot; (1979). For television his roles included Lord Henry Wotton in &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1976), John of Gaunt in &quot;Richard II&quot; (1978) and Chorus in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1978).

===Later years===

In the 1980s Gielgud appeared in more than twenty films. Morley singles out as noteworthy &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980), as the chairman of the Royal London Hospital, &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981), as the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), as Lord Irwin (the latter two winning Academy Awards as Best Picture), &quot;The Shooting Party&quot; (1984) and &quot;Plenty&quot; (1985), directed by David Lynch, Hugh Hudson, Richard Attenborough, Alan Bridges and Fred Schepisi respectively. Tony Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Wagner&quot; (1983) was the only film in which Gielgud, Richardson, and Olivier played scenes together. Gielgud made cameo appearances in films of little merit, lending distinction while not damaging his own reputation. He told an interviewer, &quot;They pay me very well for two or three days&#x27; work a month, so why not? It&#x27;s nice at my age to be able to travel all over the world at other people&#x27;s expense.&quot;

Gielgud&#x27;s most successful film performance of the decade was Steve Gordon&#x27;s comedy &quot;Arthur&quot; (1981), which starred Dudley Moore as a self-indulgent playboy. Gielgud played Hobson, Moore&#x27;s butler. He turned the part down twice before finally accepting it, nervous, after the &quot;Caligula&quot; débâcle, of the strong language used by the acerbic Hobson. He won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor and other awards for the performance. He placed little value on awards, and avoided presentation ceremonies whenever he could: &quot;I really detest all the mutual congratulation baloney and the invidious comparisons which they evoke.&quot;

For television Gielgud played nineteen roles during the 1980s; they included Edward Ryder in an eleven-part adaptation of Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1982). &quot;The Times&quot; said that he gave the role &quot;a desolate and calculated malice which carries almost singlehandedly [the] first two episodes&quot;. Near the end of the decade, Gielgud was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for his role as Aaron Jastrow, a Jewish professor murdered in the Holocaust, in the mini-series &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;. At the decade&#x27;s end he played a rakish journalist, Haverford Downs, in John Mortimer&#x27;s &quot;Summer&#x27;s Lease&quot;, for which he won an Emmy Award after its 1991 American broadcast.

Gielgud&#x27;s final West End play was Hugh Whitemore&#x27;s &quot;The Best of Friends&quot; (1988). He played Sir Sydney Cockerell, director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, in a representation of a friendship between Cockerell, Bernard Shaw and Laurentia McLachlan, a Benedictine nun. Gielgud had some trouble learning his lines; at one performance he almost forgot them, momentarily distracted by seeing in a 1938 copy of &quot;The Times&quot;, read by his character, a review of his own portrayal of Vershinin in &quot;Three Sisters&quot; fifty years earlier.

In 1990 Gielgud made his last film appearance in a leading role, playing Prospero in &quot;Prospero&#x27;s Books&quot;, Peter Greenaway&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Reviews for the film were mixed, but Gielgud&#x27;s performance in one of his signature roles was much praised. He continued to work on radio, as he had done throughout his career; Croall lists more than fifty BBC radio productions of plays starring Gielgud between 1929 and 1994. To mark his ninetieth birthday he played Lear for the last time; for the BBC Kenneth Branagh gathered a cast that included Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins and Emma Thompson as Lear&#x27;s daughters, with actors such as Bob Hoskins, Derek Jacobi and Simon Russell Beale in supporting roles. He continued to appear on television until 1998; his last major role in the medium was in a BBC production in 1994 of J. B. Priestley&#x27;s rarely-revived &quot;Summer Day&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Subsequently, he made further cameo appearances in films including Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (as King Priam, 1996), &quot;Dragonheart&quot; (as the voice of King Arthur, 1996), and &quot;Shine&quot; (as Cecil Parkes, 1996). His last feature film appearance was as Pope Pius V in Shekhar Kapur&#x27;s &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998). In 2000 he had a non-speaking role alongside Pinter in a film of Beckett&#x27;s short play &quot;Catastrophe&quot; directed by David Mamet.

Gielgud&#x27;s partner, Martin Hensler, died in 1999. After this, Gielgud went into a physical and psychological decline; he died at home on 21 May 2000, at the age of 96. At his request there was no memorial service, and his funeral at All Saints&#x27; Church, Wotton Underwood, was private, for family and close friends.

==Honours, character and reputation==

Gielgud&#x27;s state honours were Knight Bachelor (1953), Legion of Honour (France, 1960), Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (1977), and Member of the Order of Merit (UK, 1996). He was awarded honorary degrees by St Andrews, Oxford and Brandeis universities.

From 1977 to 1989 Gielgud was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art – a symbolic position – and was the academy&#x27;s first honorary fellow (1989). In 1994 the Globe Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue was renamed the Gielgud Theatre. He had not acted on stage for six years, and felt out of touch with the West End: he commented on the renaming of the theatre, &quot;At last there is a name in lights on the Avenue which I actually recognise, even if it is my own.&quot;

Gielgud was uninterested in religion or politics. As a boy he had been fascinated by the rituals at Westminster Abbey, but his brief attraction to religion quickly faded, and as an adult he was a non-believer. His indifference to politics was illustrated at a formal dinner not long after the Second World War when he asked a fellow guest, &quot;Whereabouts are you living now?&quot;, unaware that, as he was talking to Clement Attlee, the answer was &quot;10 Downing Street&quot;.

In his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry Gielgud listed his hobbies as music and painting, but his concentration on his work, which Emlyn Williams called fanatical, left little scope for leisure activities. His dedication to his art was not solemn. The critic Nicholas de Jongh wrote that Gielgud&#x27;s personality was &quot;such infinite, mischievous fun&quot;, and Coward&#x27;s biographer Cole Lesley recalled the pleasure of Gielgud&#x27;s company, &quot;the words tumbling out of his mouth in an avalanche, frequently having to wipe away his own tears of laughter at the funniness of the disasters he recounted, disasters always against himself&quot;.

Together with Richardson and Olivier, Gielgud was internationally recognised as one of the &quot;great trinity of theatrical knights&quot; who dominated the British stage for more than fifty years during the middle and later decades of the 20th century.

The critic Michael Coveney wrote, for Gielgud&#x27;s ninety-fifth birthday:

In an obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot; Alan Strachan, having discussed Gielgud&#x27;s work for cinema, radio and television, concluded that &quot;any consideration of Gielgud&#x27;s rich and often astonishing career must return to the stage; as he wrote at the close of &quot;An Actor and His Time&quot; (1979), he saw the theatre as &#x27;more than an occupation or a profession; for me it has been a life&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Treasure Island (originally titled The Sea Cook: A Story for Boys) is an adventure and historical novel by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson. It was published in 1883, and tells a story of &quot;buccaneers and buried gold&quot; set in the 1700s. It is considered a coming-of-age story and is noted for its atmosphere, characters, and action.

The novel was originally serialised from 1881 to 1882 in the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Young Folks&quot; under the title Treasure Island or the Mutiny of the Hispaniola, credited to the pseudonym &quot;Captain George North&quot;. It was first published as a book on 14 November 1883 by Cassell &amp; Co. It has since become one of the most-often dramatised and adapted novels.

Since its publication &quot;Treasure Island&quot; has significantly influenced depictions of pirates in popular culture, including elements such as deserted tropical islands, treasure maps marked with an &quot;X&quot;, and one-legged seamen with parrots perched on their shoulders.

==Plot Summary==
In the mid-18th century, an old sailor who identifies himself as &quot;The Captain&quot; starts to lodge at the rural Admiral Benbow Inn near Bristol. He tells the innkeeper&#x27;s son, Jim Hawkins, to keep a lookout for &quot;a one-legged seafaring man&quot;. Black Dog, a pirate with missing fingers, recognises the captain as his former shipmate Billy Bones, and confronts him. They get into a cutlass fight; Black Dog flees, and Bones suffers a stroke. That night, Jim&#x27;s father dies. Days later, Pew, a blind beggar, visits the inn, delivering a summons to Bones called &quot;the black spot&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Bones suffers another stroke and dies. Pew and his accomplices attack the inn but are attacked and routed by mounted excise officers, and Pew is trampled to death by one of their horses. Jim and his mother escape with a packet from The Captain&#x27;s sea chest, which is found to contain a map of the island on which the infamous pirate Captain Flint hid his treasure. Jim shows the map to the local physician Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney, and they decide to make an expedition to the island, with Jim serving as a cabin boy.

They set sail from Bristol on a schooner chartered by Trelawney, the &quot;Hispaniola&quot;, under Captain Alexander Smollett. Jim forms a strong bond with the ship&#x27;s one-legged cook, Long John Silver. The crew suffers a tragedy when first mate Mr. Arrow, a drunkard, is washed overboard during a storm. While hidden in an apple barrel, Jim overhears a conversation among the &quot;Hispaniola&quot;″s crew which reveals that many of them are pirates who had served on Captain Flint&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Walrus&quot;, with Silver leading them. They plan to mutiny after the salvage of the treasure, and to murder the captain and the few remaining loyal crew. Jim secretly informs Captain Smollett, Trelawney, and Livesey.

Arriving at the island and going ashore, Jim flees into the jungle after witnessing Silver murder a sailor for objections. He meets a marooned pirate named Ben Gunn, who is also a former member of Flint&#x27;s crew. The mutineers arm themselves and take the ship, while Jim and Smollett&#x27;s loyal band take refuge in an abandoned stockade on the island. After a brief truce, the mutineers attack the stockade, with casualties on both sides of the battle. Jim makes his way to the &quot;Hispaniola&quot; and cuts the ship from its anchor, drifting it along the ebb tide. He boards the ship and encounters the pirate Israel Hands, who had been injured in a drunken dispute with one of his companions. Hands helps Jim beach the schooner in the northern bay, then attempts to kill Jim with a dagger, but Jim shoots him dead with two pistols.

Jim goes ashore and returns to the stockade, where he is horrified to find only Silver and the pirates. Silver tells Jim that when everyone found the ship was gone, Captain Smollett&#x27;s party had agreed to a truce whereby the pirates take the map and allow the besieged party to leave. In the morning, Livesey arrives to treat the wounded and sick pirates, and tells Silver to look out for trouble once he&#x27;s found the site of the treasure. After a dispute over leadership, Silver and the others set out with the map, taking Jim along as a hostage. They find a skeleton with its arms oriented toward the treasure, unnerving the party. Ben Gunn shouts Captain Flint&#x27;s last words from the forest, making the superstitious pirates believe that Flint&#x27;s ghost is haunting the island. They eventually find a treasure cache, but it is empty. The pirates prepare to kill Silver and Jim, but they are driven off by the doctor&#x27;s party, including Gunn. Livesey explains that Gunn had already found the bulk of the treasure and taken it to his cave, long ago. The expedition members load this portion of the treasure onto the &quot;Hispaniola&quot; and depart the island, with Silver as their only prisoner. At their first port, in Spanish America, Silver steals a bag of money and escapes. The remaining crew sail back to Bristol and divide up the treasure. Some treasure was never found, but Jim refuses to return to the &quot;accursed&quot; island to look for it.

==Inspiration==
&quot;Treasure Island&quot; was written by Stevenson after returning from his first trip to America where he was married. Still a relatively unknown author, inspiration came in summer of 1881 in Braemar, Scotland when bad weather kept the family inside. To amuse his 12-year old stepson, Lloyd Osbourne, he used the idea of a secret map as the basis of a story about hidden treasure.

He had clearly started work by 25 August, writing to a friend, &quot;If this don&#x27;t fetch the kids, why, they have gone rotten since my day. Will you be surprised to learn that it is about Buccaneers, that it begins in the Admiral Benbow public house on the Devon coast, that it&#x27;s all about a map and a treasure and a mutiny and a derelict ship... It&#x27;s quite silly and horrid fun – and what I want is the &quot;best&quot; book about Buccaneers that can be had.&quot;

Stevenson originally gave the book the title &quot;The Sea Cook&quot;. One month after conceiving of the book, chapters began to appear in the pages of the &quot;Young Folks&quot; magazine. After completing several chapters rapidly, Stevenson was interrupted by illness. He left Scotland and continued working on the first draft near London, where he and his father discussed points of the tale, and his father suggested elements that he included. The novel eventually ran in seventeen weekly instalments from 1 October 1881 to 28 January 1882. The book was later republished as the novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and proved to be Stevenson&#x27;s first financial and critical success.

The growth of the desert island genre can be traced back to 1719 when Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was published. A century later, novels such as S. H. Burney&#x27;s &quot;The Shipwreck&quot; (1816), and Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Pirate&quot; (1822) continued to expand upon Defoe&#x27;s classic. Other authors in the mid-19th century continued this trend, with works including James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Pilot&quot; (1823). During the same period, Edgar Allan Poe wrote &quot;MS Found in a Bottle&quot; (1833) and &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; (1843). All of these works influenced Stevenson&#x27;s end product.

Stevenson also consciously borrowed material from previous authors. In a letter from July 1884 to Sidney Colvin, he wrote that, &quot;&quot;Treasure Island&quot; came out of Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;At Last&quot;, where I got the Dead Man&#x27;s Chest — and that was the seed — and out of the great Captain Johnson&#x27;s &quot;History of the Notorious Pirates&quot;.&quot; Stevenson also admits that he took the idea of Captain Flint&#x27;s pointing skeleton from Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; and he constructed Billy Bones&#x27;s history from the &quot;Money-Diggers&quot; section (&quot;Golden Dreams&quot; in particular) of &quot;Tales of a Traveller&quot; by Washington Irving, one of his favourite writers.

==Characters==
===Main===
* Jim Hawkins: The narrator of most of the novel. Jim is the son of an innkeeper on the north Devon coast of England and appears to be in his mid-teens. He is eager to go to sea and hunt for treasure. Jim consistently displays courage and heroism, but is also sometimes impulsive and impetuous. He exhibits increasing sensitivity and wisdom as the journey progresses.
* Long John Silver: The one-legged cook aboard the &quot;Hispaniola&quot;. Silver is the secret leader of the pirates. He is deceitful, mean, and greedy, but also charismatic, and his physical and mental strength are impressive. He is kind toward Jim and appears genuinely fond of him. Silver was based in part on Stevenson&#x27;s friend and mentor William Ernest Henley.
* Dr. David Livesey: A doctor and magistrate; he narrates a few chapters of the novel. He exhibits common sense and rationality, and is fair-minded, treating wounded pirates just as he does his own comrades. But he does not hesitate to express his opinions and dislikes openly towards the pirates. Some years prior to the events of the novel, he had participated in the Battle of Fontenoy, during which he was wounded in action.
* Captain Alexander Smollett: The captain of the &quot;Hispaniola&quot;. He is savvy and is rightly suspicious of the crew that Trelawney hires. Smollett is a real professional, taking his job seriously and displaying skill as a negotiator. Smollett believes in rules and does not like Jim&#x27;s disobedience, but later in the novel states that he and Jim shouldn&#x27;t go to sea together again as Jim was too much of the born favourite for him.
* Squire John Trelawney: A wealthy landowner who arranges the voyage to the island. He is too trusting and is duped by Silver into hiring pirates as the ship&#x27;s crew.
* Billy Bones: An old seaman who resides at the Admiral Benbow Inn. He used to be Flint&#x27;s first mate, and is surly and rude. He exhorts Jim to be on the lookout for a one-legged man. A treasure map in his possession set the events of the novel in motion.
* Ben Gunn: A former member of Captain Flint&#x27;s crew who was found on Treasure Island, having been marooned there by another ship&#x27;s crew three years earlier when they couldn&#x27;t find Flint&#x27;s treasure. He is described as being &quot;insane&quot;, at least partially, and has a craving for cheese. He helps Silver escape and in England receives £1,000 which he spends/loses in 20 days. He becomes a Lodge gamekeeper and also sings in a church choir.

Howden Smith, Ben Gunn was the servant of captain Andrew &quot;Rip-Rap&quot; Murray, Flint&#x27;s associate and the mastermind behind the capture of the treasure ship &quot;Santissima Trinidad&quot;, whence the buried treasure was taken. Murray described Ben Gunn as a &quot;half-wit&quot; whom he kept as servant specifically because he considered him intellectually incapable of treachery. After Flint&#x27;s crew killed Murray and overpowered his crew, Ben Gunn went to serve Flint and fled the &quot;Walrus&quot; in Savannah after Flint&#x27;s death.
** According to &quot;The Adventures of Ben Gunn&quot;, he was Nic Allardyce&#x27;s servant and friend from back home.

===Minor===

* Alan: An honest sailor who is killed by the mutineers during the landing on the island and whose death scream is heard across the isle. The incident occurs just before Long John murders Tom.
* Allardyce: One of the six members of Flint&#x27;s Crew who, after burying the treasure and silver and building the blockhouse on Treasure Island, are all killed by Flint, who returns to his ship alone. Allardyce&#x27;s body is lined up by Flint as a compass marker to the cache.
** In &quot;Porto Bello Gold&quot;, one sailor on Flint&#x27;s ship is named &quot;Tom Allardyce&quot;. A lanky fellow with rather long, yellow hair, he is an antagonistic ringleader of sailors opposing Flint in at least two &quot;fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle councils&quot;. Flint thinks they may present him with the Black Spot; he eventually challenges Allardyce to bring six friends and bury the treasure together.
** According to &quot;The Adventures of Ben Gunn&quot;, his first name was &quot;Nic&quot;, he was surgeon on Flint&#x27;s crew, and Ben Gunn was his servant and friend from back home.
* Job Anderson: The ship&#x27;s boatswain and one of the leaders of the mutiny. He participates in the storming of the blockhouse and is killed by Gray while attacking Jim. He is probably one of Flint&#x27;s old pirate hands, though this is never stated. Along with Hands and Merry, he tipped a Black Spot on Silver and forced Silver to start the mutiny before the treasure was found.
* Mr. Arrow: The first mate of the &quot;Hispaniola&quot;. He is an alcoholic and is useless as a first mate. He disappears before they get to the island and his position is filled by Job Anderson. Silver had secretly given Mr. Arrow alcohol and he fell drunkenly overboard on a stormy night. In his BBC adaptation of 1977, John Lucarotti gives him the first name &quot;Joshua&quot;. His first name was not stated in the novel.
* Black Dog: Formerly a member of Flint&#x27;s pirate crew, later one of Pew&#x27;s companions who visits the Admiral Benbow to confront Billy Bones. He is spotted by Jim in Silver&#x27;s tavern and slips out to be chased by two of Silver&#x27;s men (in order to maintain the ruse that Silver and his men are not associated with him). Two fingers are missing from his left hand, and from his first appearance at the Admiral Benbow Inn, it appears Billy Bones may have previously attacked and caused the injury.
* Pew: A vicious, deadly, and sinister blind beggar who served as a member of Flint&#x27;s crew. Despite his blindness, he proves to be a dangerous adversary and can even be considered a ringleader amongst his fellow crewmen. He is the second messenger to approach Billy Bones and the one to deliver the Black Spot. He is trampled to death by the horses of revenue officers riding to assist Jim and his mother after the raid on their inn. Silver claims Pew spent his share of Flint&#x27;s treasure at a rate of £1,200 per year, and that for two years until his accident at the &quot;Admiral Benbow&quot;, he begged, stole, and murdered. Stevenson avoided predictability by making the two most fearsome characters a blind man and an amputee. In the play &quot;Admiral Guinea&quot; (1892), Stevenson gives him the full name &quot;David Pew&quot;. Stevenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1886) also features a dangerous blind man.
** In &quot;Porto Bello Gold&quot;, it is Pew who fatally stabs captain Murray, working in concert with Long John Silver. From the context, it seems that Silver means Pew when he addresses one man as &quot;Ezra&quot; just prior.
* Mr. Dance: Chief revenue officer (titled Supervisor) who ascends with his men upon the Admiral Benbow, driving out the pirates, and saving Jim Hawkins and his mother. He then takes Hawkins to see the squire and the doctor.
* Dogger: One of Mr. Dance&#x27;s associates, who doubles Hawkins on his horse to the squire&#x27;s house.
* Captain J. Flint: A pirate who was captain of a ship called the &quot;Walrus&quot;, and who is dead before the events of the novel begin. In life he was the leader of the pirates and they refer to him often. He was the original possessor of the treasure, and buried it on the island. Long John Silver&#x27;s parrot is named after him.
* Abraham Gray: A ship&#x27;s carpenter&#x27;s mate on the &quot;Hispaniola&quot;. He is almost incited to mutiny but remains loyal to the Squire&#x27;s side when asked to do so by Captain Smollett. He saves Hawkins&#x27; life by killing Job Anderson during an attack on the stockade, and he helps shoot the mutineers at the rifled treasure cache. He later escapes the island together with Jim Hawkins, Dr. Livesey, Squire Trelawney, Captain Smollett, Long John Silver, and Ben Gunn. He spends his part of the treasure on his education, marries, and becomes part owner of a full-rigged ship.
* Israel Hands: The ship&#x27;s coxswain and Flint&#x27;s old gunner. He tries to murder Jim Hawkins, who shoots him in self-defence.
* Harry: He is probably one of Flint&#x27;s old pirate hands; one of those who &quot;ran after Black Dog&quot; at the Spyglass Inn.
* Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins: The parents of Jim Hawkins. Mr. Hawkins dies early in the story.
* John Hunter: A manservant of Squire Trelawney. Dr. Livesey considers him to be the most steady and capable of Livesey&#x27;s servants to have in a fight. He accompanies Trelawney to the island but is later knocked unconscious in an attack on the stockade. He dies of his injuries while unconscious.
* John: A mutineer who is injured while trying to storm the blockhouse. Throughout the latter narrative he is primarily referred to by Hawkins as &#x27;the man with the bandaged head&#x27; and ends up being killed at the rifled treasure cache. He is probably one of Flint&#x27;s old pirate hands, as his name is called by Blind Pew before Pew was killed at the Inn.
* Dick Johnson: The youngest of the mutineers, who has a Bible. The pirates use one of its pages to make a Black Spot for Silver, only to have him predict bad luck on Dick for sacrilege. Soon becoming mortally ill with malaria, Dick ends up being marooned on the island after the deaths of George Merry and John.
* Dirk: One of Flint&#x27;s old pirate hands, he was a lookout for the ex-pirates in Pew&#x27;s attack on the Inn
* Richard Joyce: One of the manservants of Squire Trelawney who accompany the squire to the island, a mild-mannered valet inexperienced in firearms. He is shot through the head and killed by a mutineer during an attack on the stockade.
* George Merry: A mutinous and hostile member of Silver&#x27;s crew, who disobeys orders and occasionally challenges Silver&#x27;s authority. With Anderson and Hands he launches the mutiny prematurely; he forces Silver to attack the blockhouse instead of waiting for the treasure to be found. He almost overthrew Silver rule&#x27;s and forced Long John to take Jim as a hostage. Later killed at the empty cache just as he is about to kill both Silver and Hawkins.
* Tom Morgan: An ex-pirate from Flint&#x27;s old crew. He ends up marooned on the island with Dick and one other mutineer.
* O&#x27;Brien: A mutineer who survives the attack on the blockhouse and escapes. He is later killed by Israel Hands in a drunken fight on the &quot;Hispaniola&quot;. He is referred to by Hawkins as the pirate &#x27;with the red nightcap&#x27; throughout most of the narrative, until Hands reveals to Hawkins that the fellow was an Irishman named O&#x27;Brien.
* Tom Redruth: The gamekeeper of Squire Trelawney. He accompanies the Squire to the island but is shot and mortally wounded by the mutineers as the captain&#x27;s party are relocating from the ship to the stockade.
* Tom: An honest sailor who is killed by Silver for refusing to join the mutiny.

Among other minor characters whose names are not revealed are the four pirates who were killed in an attack on the stockade along with Job Anderson; the pirate killed by the honest men minus Jim Hawkins the day before the attack on the stockade; the pirate killed by Ben Gunn the night before the attack; the pirate shot by Squire Trelawney when aiming at Israel Hands, who later died of his injuries; and the pirate marooned on the island along with Tom Morgan and Dick Johnson.

==Historical allusions==

===Real pirates and piracy===
The historian Luis Junco suggests that &quot;Treasure Island&quot; is a combination of the story of the murder of Captain George Glas aboard the &quot;Earl of Sandwich&quot; in 1765 and the taking of the ship &quot;Walrus&quot; off the island of La Graciosa near Tenerife. The pirates of La Graciosa buried their treasure there, and were subsequently all killed in a bloody battle with the Royal Navy; the treasure was never recovered.

In his book &quot;Pirates of the Carraigin&quot;, David Kelly deals with the piracy and murder of Captain Glas and others by the Ship&#x27;s cook and his gang aboard a ship travelling from Tenerife to London. The perpetrators of this crime also buried the considerable treasure they had stolen but most of it was later recovered. They were all executed in Dublin in 1766. In his research, Kelly showed that Stevenson was a neighbour of the named victim in Edinburgh, and so was aware from an early age of these events, which had been a scandal at the time. Stevenson and his family were members of a church congregation set up by the victim&#x27;s father. Although he never visited Ireland, Stevenson based at least two other books, &quot;Kidnapped&quot; and &quot;Catriona&quot; on real crimes that were perpetrated in Dublin; these crimes were all reported in detail in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, published in Dublin and Edinburgh.

Other allusions to real piracy include:
* Five real-life pirates mentioned are William Kidd (active 1696–1699), Blackbeard (1716–1718), Edward England (1717–1720), Howell Davis (1718–1719), and Bartholomew Roberts (1719–1722). Kidd buried treasure on Gardiners Island, though the booty was recovered by authorities soon afterwards.
* The name &quot;Israel Hands&quot; was taken from that of a real pirate in Blackbeard&#x27;s crew, whom Blackbeard maimed (by shooting him in the knee) simply to ensure that his crew remained in terror of him. Allegedly, Hands was taken ashore to be treated for his injury and was not at Blackbeard&#x27;s last fight (the incident is depicted in Tim Powers&#x27; novel &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot;), and this alone saved him from the gallows. Supposedly, he later became a beggar in England.
* Silver refers to &quot;three hundred and fifty thousand&quot; pieces of eight at the &quot;fishing up of the wrecked plate ships&quot;. This remark conflates two related events: first, the salvage of treasure from the 1715 Treasure Fleet which was wrecked off the coast of Florida in a hurricane; second, the seizure of 350,000 salvaged pieces of eight the following year (out of several million) by privateer Henry Jennings. This event is mentioned in the introduction to Johnson&#x27;s &quot;General History of the Pyrates&quot;.
* Silver refers to a ship&#x27;s surgeon from Roberts&#x27; crew who amputated his leg and was later hanged at Cape Coast Castle, a British fortification on the Gold Coast of Africa. The records of the trial of Roberts&#x27; men list Peter Scudamore as the chief surgeon of Roberts&#x27; ship &quot;Royal Fortune&quot;. Scudamore was found guilty of willingly serving with Roberts&#x27; pirates and various related criminal acts, as well as attempting to lead a rebellion to escape once he had been apprehended. He was, as Silver relates, hanged, in 1722.
* Stevenson refers to the &quot;Viceroy of the Indies&quot;, a ship sailing from Goa, India (then a Portuguese colony), which was taken by Edward England off Malabar while John Silver was serving aboard England&#x27;s ship the &quot;Cassandra&quot;. No such exploit of England&#x27;s is known, nor any ship by the name of the &quot;Viceroy of the Indies&quot;. However, in April 1721, the captain of the &quot;Cassandra&quot;, John Taylor (originally England&#x27;s second in command who had marooned him for being insufficiently ruthless), together with his pirate partner, Olivier Levasseur, captured the vessel &quot;Nostra Senhora do Cabo&quot; near Réunion island in the Indian Ocean. The Portuguese galleon was returning from Goa to Lisbon with the Conde da Ericeira, the recently retired Viceroy of Portuguese India, aboard. The viceroy had much of his treasure with him, making this capture one of the richest pirate hauls ever. This is possibly the event that Stevenson referred to, though his (or Silver&#x27;s) memory of the event seems to be slightly confused. The &quot;Cassandra&quot; was last heard of in 1723 at Portobelo, Panama, a place that also briefly figures in &quot;Treasure Island&quot; as &quot;Portobello&quot;.
* The preceding two references are inconsistent, as the &quot;Cassandra&quot; (and presumably Silver) was in the Indian Ocean during the time that Scudamore was surgeon aboard the &quot;Royal Fortune&quot;, in the Gulf of Guinea.
* A real life 1800s smuggling gang, the &quot;Benbow Brandy Men&quot;, operated out of the Benbow pub in Penzance, smuggling gin, brandy, and tobacco to avoid paying the massive import taxes imposed by the Crown to fund its foreign wars.

===Other allusions===

* 1689: A pirate whistles &quot;Lillibullero&quot;.
* 1702: The Admiral Benbow Inn on the Devon coast, where Jim and his mother live, is named after the real life Admiral John Benbow (1653–1702).
* 1733: Foundation of Savannah, Georgia, where Captain Flint died in 1754.
* 1745: Doctor Livesey was at the Battle of Fontenoy (1745).
* 1747: Squire Trelawney and Long John Silver both mention &quot;Admiral Hawke&quot;, i.e. Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke (1705–81), promoted to rear admiral in 1747.
* 1749: The novel refers to the Bow Street Runners (1749).
* &quot;Treasure Island&quot; was in part inspired by R. M. Ballantyne&#x27;s &quot;The Coral Island&quot;, which Stevenson admired for its &quot;better qualities.&quot; Stevenson alludes to Ballantyne in the epigraph at the beginning of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;To the Hesitating Purchaser&quot;, &quot;... If studious youth no longer crave, His ancient appetites forgot, Kingston, or Ballantyne the brave, Or Cooper of the wood and wave ...&quot;

===Possible allusions===

====Characters====
* Squire Trelawney may have been named for Edward Trelawney, Governor of Jamaica 1738–52.
* Dr. Livesey may have been named for Joseph Livesey (1794–1884), a famous 19th-century temperance advocate, founder of the tee-total &quot;Preston Pledge&quot;. In the novel, Dr. Livesey warns the drunkard Billy Bones that &quot;the name of rum for you is death.&quot;

====Treasure Island====

Various claims have been made that one island or another inspired Treasure Island:
* Isla de Pinos near Cuba, which served as a supply base for pirates for about 300 years, is believed to have inspired Treasure Island.
* Norman Island in the British Virgin Islands was supposedly mentioned to Stevenson by a sailor uncle, and also possesses a &quot;Spyglass Hill&quot; like the fictional Treasure Island.
* Cocos Island off Costa Rica has many similarities with the fictional treasure island. British trader Captain William Thompson buried the stolen treasury of Peru there in 1820; an original inventory showed 113 gold religious statues (one a life-sized Virgin Mary), 200 chests of jewels, 273 swords with jewelled hilts, 1,000 diamonds, solid-gold crowns, 150 chalices, and hundreds of gold and silver bars. The real treasure has never been found, despite more than 300 expeditions to the island. Stevenson mentions the buried treasure and Captain Thompson in an 1881 letter to W. E. Henley, where he also provides the earliest known title for the book: &quot;The Sea Cook, or Treasure Island: a Story for Boys&quot;.
* Dead Chest Island, a barren rock in the British Virgin Islands, which Stevenson found mentioned in Charles Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;At Last: A Christmas in the West Indies&quot;, and which he said &quot;was the seed&quot; for the phrase &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;.
* Small pond in Queen Street Gardens in Edinburgh, said to have been visible from Stevenson&#x27;s bedroom window in Heriot Row.
* The Napa Valley, California, where Stevenson spent his honeymoon in 1880, as narrated in his &quot;The Silverado Squatters&quot; (1883).
* Osborn Island (now Nienstedt Island) in the Manasquan River in Brielle, New Jersey. Stevenson supposedly visited there in May 1888 (five years after writing &quot;Treasure Island&quot;) and christened it &quot;Treasure Island&quot;
* Fidra in the Firth of Forth, visible from North Berwick where Stevenson had spent many childhood holidays.
* Unst, one of the Shetland Islands, to which the map of Treasure Island bears a very vague resemblance.
* R. F. Delderfield, in &quot;The Adventures of Ben Gunn&quot;, suggests that its real name is Kidd&#x27;s Island, and identifies it as an outlying island of the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands, south-south-west of Tobago (pp. 119–120).

==Suggested links to the towns of Birkenhead and Wallasey near Liverpool==
In August 2022 Mick Whitley, then the member of Parliament for Birkenhead, supported the findings of a local historian named John Lamb that Stevenson had set his classic novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot; in the towns of Birkenhead and Wallasey on the Wirral Peninsula lying opposite Liverpool. This followed a previous announcement by Alan Evans of Wirral Borough Council that the French science fiction writer Jules Verne had also set his 1874 novel &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; in Birkenhead. Their letters of support for Mr Lamb&#x27;s claims were posted on the &quot;Jules Verne and the Heroes of Birkenhead&quot; website in August 2022.

=== Other places ===

* Both the Llandoger Trow in Bristol, and the Admiral Benbow in Penzance, have claimed to be an inspiration for the Admiral Benbow Inn. Stevenson visited Cornwall and Penzance in August 1877, and as the inn is described in the book as being in a rural area and it was necessary to travel to Bristol, Penzance&#x27;s &quot;Benbow Brandy Men&quot; may have inspired him to feature the Penzance Benbow in Treasure Island.
* The Hole in the Wall, in Bristol, is claimed to be the Spyglass Tavern.
* &quot;The Pirate&#x27;s House&quot; in Savannah, Georgia, is where Captain Flint is claimed to have spent his last days, and his ghost is claimed to haunt the property.

===Worldbuilding===
In worldbuilding, there are:
* &quot;Admiral Guinea&quot; (publ. 1892), a play written by Stevenson and W. E. Henley. It features the blind ex-pirate Pew as a character under the name of &quot;David Pew&quot;.
* In his collection &quot;Fables&quot; (1896), Stevenson wrote a vignette called &quot;The Persons of the Tale&quot;, in which puppets Captain Smollett and Long John Silver discuss authorship.
* In the novel &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot; (1911) by J. M. Barrie, it is said that Captain Hook is the only man ever feared by the Old Sea Cook (i.e., Long John Silver); Captain Flint and the &quot;Walrus&quot; are also referenced, among others.
* In the film &quot;The Pagemaster&quot; (1994), the hero is confronted by Long John Silver, who surrenders and leaves after he is threatened with a sword
* In the animated series &quot;Fox&#x27;s Peter Pan and the Pirates&quot; (based, in part, on the original Peter Pan stories), Captain Flint is referenced in the episode &quot;Peter on Trial&quot;, as Captain Hook is stated as being the only man that a pirate named Barbecue is stated to fear, with the following statement being that, &quot;even Flint feared Barbecue,&quot; referring to Captain Flint from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. Barbecue is the crew&#x27;s nickname for Long John Silver in the novel. In the same episode, Flint is referenced as being the pirate who supposedly conceived of the idea of pirates putting members of their crew or their prisoners as the case might be, on trial in an event called &#x27;Captain&#x27;s Mast&#x27;.
* &quot;Treasure Island&quot; made an appearance in &quot;Doraemon the Movie: Nobita&#x27;s Treasure Island&quot;, the 2018 entry of the popular &quot;Doraemon&quot; movie series which is also a loose adaptation of the book.

===&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;===
Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; franchise references &quot;Treasure Island&quot; many times. In the 2006 revamp of the original attraction, the island port was officially named Isla Tesoro, with the Spanish translation of Treasure Island is &quot;La isla del tesoro&quot;. In making &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, &quot;Treasure Island&quot; was one of many inspirations behind making the film, noted by the filmmakers like producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who regarded the 1950 Walt Disney Studio feature. It was also noted that history has a strange way of turning full circle as 53 years later, it took the very same studio&#x27;s first &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; movie to reinvent and reinvigorate a moribund genre which delighted millions. One thing screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio took from their experience on &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;, was the simple premise of, &quot;Is Long John Silver a delightful Falstaffian character or a contemptible villain?&quot; That idea was something they carried into Captain Jack Sparrow. Hector Barbossa&#x27;s pet monkey, named &quot;Jack&quot; after Jack Sparrow, is a reference to Long John Silver&#x27;s pet parrot Captain Flint. Both animals are named after their owner&#x27;s former captain. &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; features the most references, beginning with Joshamee Gibbs singing Dead Man&#x27;s Chest, a song from the novel, which served as the original opening of until it changed into the second scene of the film. Jack Sparrow is given the Black Spot by Bootstrap Bill Turner as a marker that the Kraken can track. Governor Weatherby Swann witnesses Mercer kill the captain, who was intended to be called &quot;Captain Hawkins&quot;, as revealed by screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio on the film&#x27;s DVD commentary. Hawkins&#x27; backstory was intended to relate to that of Jim Hawkins&#x27; father in &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, explaining the circumstances of his father&#x27;s disappearance at sea and why he never returned to the Admiral Benbow Inn. The merchant ship the &quot;Edinburgh Trader&quot; was played by the &quot;Bounty&quot;, a ship replica which played the &quot;Hispaniola&quot; in the 1990 movie adaptation of the novel. &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot; has Hector Barbossa begin wearing a wooden peg leg where a real one used to be, revealed to have been lost in an off-screen encounter with Blackbeard. Barbossa is feared as an omen of death and referred to as &quot;the one legged man&quot; by Blackbeard and his daughter Angelica, which is a parallel to Billy Bones having feared John Silver and ominously referred to him by the same moniker. Regarding this change in Barbossa, actor Geoffrey Rush noted Robert Newton playing Long John Silver in &quot;Treasure Island&quot; Terry Rossio references &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; in the annotations for his screenplay draft for &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;, which features a character named Captain (later Admiral) John Benbow as a reference to the Admiral Benbow Inn. One of Chris Schweizer&#x27;s early ideas for the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; comic book series was to have Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann&#x27;s 12-or-13-year-old son be involved in Jack Sparrow&#x27;s search for Anamaria who had disappeared while searching for a mystical treasure, with the boy eventually growing up and becoming Billy Bones, a character from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. A phantom pirate named Black Dog Briar appears in the video game expansion.

<doc id="167964" wikidata="Q1535240" url="?curid=167964" title="South Pacific (musical)">
<text>South Pacific is a musical composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and book by Hammerstein and Joshua Logan. The work premiered in 1949 on Broadway and was an immediate hit, running for 1,925 performances. The plot is based on James A. Michener&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning 1947 book &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot; and combines elements of several of those stories. Rodgers and Hammerstein believed they could write a musical based on Michener&#x27;s work that would be financially successful and, at the same time, send a strong progressive message on racism.

The plot centers on an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island during World War II, who falls in love with a middle-aged expatriate French plantation owner but struggles to accept his mixed-race children. A secondary romance, between a U.S. Marine lieutenant and a young Tonkinese woman, explores his fears of the social consequences should he marry his Asian sweetheart. The issue of racial prejudice is candidly explored throughout the musical, most controversially in the lieutenant&#x27;s song, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Carefully Taught&quot;. Supporting characters, including a comic petty officer and the Tonkinese girl&#x27;s mother, help to tie the stories together. Because he lacked military knowledge, Hammerstein had difficulty writing that part of the script. The director of the original production, Logan, assisted him and received credit as co-writer of the book.

The original Broadway production enjoyed immense critical and box-office success, became the second-longest running Broadway musical to that point (behind Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s earlier &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1943)), and has remained popular ever since. After they signed Ezio Pinza and Mary Martin as the leads, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote several of the songs with the particular talents of their stars in mind. The piece won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1950. Especially in the Southern U.S., its racial theme provoked controversy, for which its authors were unapologetic. Several of its songs, including &quot;Bali Ha&#x27;i&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair&quot;, &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, &quot;There Is Nothing Like a Dame&quot;, &quot;Happy Talk&quot;, &quot;Younger Than Springtime&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a Wonderful Guy&quot;, have become popular standards.

The production won ten Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Score, and Best Libretto, and it is the only musical production to win Tony Awards in all four acting categories. Its original cast album was the bestselling record of the 1940s, and other recordings of the show have also been popular. The show has enjoyed many successful revivals and tours, spawning a 1958 film and television adaptations. The 2008 Broadway revival, a critical success, ran for 996 performances and won seven Tonys, including Best Musical Revival.

== Background ==

Although book editor and university instructor James Michener could have avoided military service in World War II as a birthright Quaker, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 1942. He was not sent to the South Pacific theater until April 1944, when he was assigned to write a history of the Navy in the Pacific and was allowed to travel widely. He survived a plane crash in New Caledonia; the near-death experience motivated him to write fiction, and he began listening to the stories told by soldiers. One journey took him to the Treasury Islands, where he discovered an unpleasant village, called Bali-ha&#x27;i, populated by &quot;scrawny residents and only one pig&quot;. Struck by the name, Michener wrote it down and soon began to record, on a battered typewriter, his version of the tales. On a plantation on the island of Espiritu Santo, he met a woman named Bloody Mary; she was small, almost toothless, her face stained with red betel juice. Punctuated with profanity learned from GIs, she complained endlessly to Michener about the French colonial government, which refused to allow her and other Tonkinese to return to their native Vietnam, lest the plantations be depopulated. She told him also of her plans to oppose colonialism in French Indochina. These stories, collected into &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot;, won Michener the 1948 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.

&quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot; comprises nineteen stories. Each stands independently but revolves around the preparation for an American military operation to dislodge the Japanese from a nearby island. This operation, dubbed &quot;Alligator&quot;, occurs in the penultimate story, &quot;The Landing at Kuralei&quot;. Many of the characters die in that battle, and the last story is titled &quot;A Cemetery at Huga Point&quot;. The stories are thematically linked in pairs: the first and final stories are reflective, the second and eighteenth involve battle, the third and seventeenth involve preparation for battle, and so on. The tenth story, at the center, is not paired with any other. This story, &quot;Fo&#x27; Dolla&#x27; &quot;, was one of only four of his many works that Michener later admitted to holding in high regard. It was the one that attracted Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s attention for its potential to be converted into a stage work.

&quot;Fo&#x27; Dolla&#x27; &quot;, set in part on the island of Bali-ha&#x27;i, focuses on the romance between a young Tonkinese woman, Liat, and one of the Americans, Marine Lieutenant Joe Cable, a Princeton graduate and scion of a wealthy Philadelphia Main Line family. Pressed to marry Liat by her mother, Bloody Mary, Cable reluctantly declines, realizing that the Asian girl would never be accepted by his family or Philadelphia society. He leaves for battle (where he will die) as Bloody Mary proceeds with her backup plan, to affiance Liat to a wealthy French planter on the islands. Cable struggles, during the story, with his own racism: he is able to overcome it sufficiently to love Liat, but not enough to take her home.

Another source of the musical is the eighth story, &quot;Our Heroine&quot;, which is thematically paired with the 12th, &quot;A Boar&#x27;s Tooth&quot;, as both involve American encounters with local cultures. &quot;Our Heroine&quot; tells of the romance between Navy nurse Nellie Forbush, from rural Arkansas, and a wealthy, sophisticated planter, Frenchman Emile De Becque. After falling in love with Emile, Nellie (who is introduced briefly in story No. 4, &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;) learns that Emile has eight daughters, out of wedlock, with several local women. Michener tells us that &quot;any person ... who was not white or yellow was a nigger&quot; to Nellie, and while she is willing to accept two of the children (of French-Asian descent) who remain in Emile&#x27;s household, she is taken aback by the other two girls who live there, evidence that the planter had cohabited with a darker Polynesian woman. To her great relief, she learns that this woman is dead, but Nellie endangers her relationship with Emile when she is initially unable to accept Emile&#x27;s &quot;nigger children&quot;. Nellie overcomes her feelings and returns to spend her life with her plantation owner.

Additional elements of &quot;South Pacific&quot; had their genesis in others of Michener&#x27;s 19 tales. One introduces the character of Bloody Mary; another tells of a British spy hidden on the Japanese-controlled island who relays information about Japanese movements to Allied forces by radio. Michener based the spy, dubbed &quot;the Remittance Man&quot;, on Captain Martin Clemens, a Scot, who unlike his fictional counterpart, survived the war. The stories also tell of the seemingly endless waiting that precedes battle, and the efforts of the Americans to repel boredom, which would inspire the song &quot;There Is Nothing Like a Dame&quot;. Several of the stories involve the Seabee, Luther Billis, who in the musical would be used both for comic relief and to tie together episodes involving otherwise unconnected characters. A 2001 article in &quot;Islands Magazine&quot; states that Michener renamed Aoba Island Bali-ha&#x27;i. The author interviewed the proprietor of a resort on Espiritu Santo, who claimed that Emile was modeled on his father and that the &quot;real Bloody Mary&quot; lived on Espiritu Santo for many years after the war and lived to the age of 102.

== Creation ==

=== Inception ===
In the early 1940s, composer Richard Rodgers and lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II, each a longtime Broadway veteran, joined forces and began their collaboration by writing two musicals that became massive hits, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1943) and &quot;Carousel&quot; (1945). An innovation for its time in integrating song, dialogue and dance, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; would serve as &quot;the model for Broadway shows for decades&quot;. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;Carousel&quot; the best musical of the century, writing that Rodgers and Hammerstein &quot;set the standards for the 20th-century musical&quot;. Their next effort, &quot;Allegro&quot; (1947), was a comparative disappointment, running for less than a year, although it turned a small profit. After this, the two were determined to achieve another hit.

According to director Joshua Logan, a friend of both theatre men, he and Leland Hayward mentioned Michener&#x27;s best-selling book to Rodgers as a possible basis for the duo&#x27;s next play, but the composer took no action. Logan recalled that he then pointed it out to Hammerstein, who read Michener&#x27;s book and spoke to Rodgers; the two agreed to do the project so long as they had majority control, to which Hayward grudgingly agreed. Michener, in his 1992 memoirs, however, wrote that the stories were first pitched as a movie concept to MGM by Kenneth MacKenna, head of the studio&#x27;s literary department. MacKenna&#x27;s half brother was Jo Mielziner, who had designed the sets for &quot;Carousel&quot; and &quot;Allegro&quot;. Michener states that Mielziner learned of the work from MacKenna and brought it to the attention of Hammerstein and Rodgers, pledging to create the sets if they took on the project.

Hayward attempted to buy the rights from Michener outright, offering $500; Michener declined. Although playwright Lynn Riggs had received 1.5% of the box office grosses for the right to adapt &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot; into &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, Michener never regretted accepting one percent of the gross receipts from &quot;South Pacific&quot;. As Rodgers and Hammerstein began their work on the adaptation, Michener worked mostly with the lyricist, but Rodgers was concerned about the implications of the setting, fearing that he would have to include ukuleles and guitars, which he disliked. Michener assured him that the only instrument he had ever heard the natives play was an emptied barrel of gasoline, drummed upon with clubs.

=== Composition ===

Soon after their purchase of the rights, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided not to include a ballet, as in their earlier works, feeling that the realism of the setting would not support one. Concerned that an adaptation too focused on &quot;Fo&#x27; Dolla&#x27; &quot;, the story of the encounter between Cable and Liat, would be too similar to &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, Hammerstein spent months studying the other stories and focused his attention on &quot;Our Heroine&quot;, the tale of the romance between Nellie and Emile. The team decided to include both romances in the musical play. It was conventional at the time that if one love story in a musical was serious, the other would be more comedic, but in this case both were serious and focused on racial prejudice. They decided to increase the role played by Luther Billis in the stories, merging experiences and elements of several other characters into him. Billis&#x27;s wheeling and dealing would provide comic relief. They also shortened the title to &quot;South Pacific&quot; – Rodgers related that the producers tired of people making risqué puns on the word &quot;tales&quot;.

In early drafts of the musical, Hammerstein gave significant parts to two characters who eventually came to have only minor roles, Bill Harbison and Dinah Culbert. Harbison is one of the major characters in &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot;; a model officer at the start, he gradually degenerates to the point where, with battle imminent, he requests his influential father-in-law to procure for him a transfer to a post in the United States. Hammerstein conceived of him as a rival to Emile for Nellie&#x27;s affections, and gave him a song, &quot;The Bright Young Executive of Today&quot;. As redrafts focused the play on the two couples, Harbison became less essential, and he was relegated to a small role as the executive officer to the commander of the island, Captain Brackett. Dinah, a nurse and friend of Nellie, is also a major character in Michener&#x27;s work, and was seen as a possible love interest for Billis, though any actual romance was limited by Navy regulations forbidding fraternization between officers (all American nurses in World War II were commissioned officers) and enlisted men. &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair&quot; originated as a duet for Dinah and Nellie, with Dinah beginning the song and developing its theme. According to Lovensheimer, Nellie&#x27;s and Dinah&#x27;s &quot;friendship became increasingly incidental to the plot as the writing continued. Hammerstein eventually realized that the decision to wash Emile out of her hair had to be Nellie&#x27;s. Only then did the scene have the dramatic potential for Nellie&#x27;s emotional transition&quot; as she realizes her love for Emile. In the final version, Dinah retains one solo line in the song.

Joshua Logan, in his memoirs, stated that after months of effort in the first half of 1948, Hammerstein had written only the first scene, an outline, and some lyrics. Hammerstein was having trouble due to lack of knowledge of the military, a matter with which Logan, a veteran of the armed forces, was able to help. The dialogue was written in consultation between the two of them, and eventually Logan asked to be credited for his work. Rodgers and Hammerstein decided that while Logan would receive co-writing credit on the book, he would receive no author&#x27;s royalties. Logan stated that a contract putting these changes into force was sent over to his lawyer with instructions that unless it was signed within two hours, Logan need not show up for rehearsals as director. Logan signed, although his lawyer did not then tell him about the ultimatum. Through the decades that followed, Logan brought the matter up from time to time, demanding compensation, but when he included his version of the events in his 1976 memoirs, it was disputed by Rodgers (Hammerstein had died in 1960). Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that Logan was compensated when &quot;South Pacific&quot; was filmed in 1958, as Logan received a substantial share of the profits as director. According to Michener biographer Stephen J. May, &quot;it is difficult to assess just how much of the final book Josh Logan was responsible for. Some estimates say 30 to 40 percent. But that percentage is not as critical perhaps as his knowledge of military lore and directing for the theatre, without which the creation of &quot;South Pacific&quot; would have collapsed during that summer of 1948.&quot;

Rodgers composed the music once he received the lyrics from Hammerstein. A number of stories are told of the speed with which he wrote the music for &quot;South Pacific&quot; &#x27;s numbers. &quot;Happy Talk&quot; was said to have been composed in about twenty minutes; when Hammerstein, who had sent the lyrics by messenger, called to check whether Rodgers had received them, his partner informed him that he had both lyrics and music. Legend has it he composed &quot;Bali Ha&#x27;i&quot; in ten minutes over coffee in Logan&#x27;s apartment; what he did create in that time frame was the three-note motif which begins both song and musical. Hammerstein&#x27;s lyrics for &quot;Bali Ha&#x27;i&quot; were inspired by the stage backdrop which designer Jo Mielziner had painted. Feeling that the island of Bali Ha&#x27;i did not appear mysterious enough, Mielziner painted some mist near the summit of its volcano. When Hammerstein saw this he immediately thought of the lyric, &quot;my head sticking up from a low-flying cloud&quot; and the rest of the song followed easily from that.

=== Casting and out-of-town previews ===

In May 1948, Rodgers received a telephone call from Edwin Lester of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera. Lester had signed former Metropolitan Opera star Ezio Pinza for $25,000 to star in a new show, &quot;Mr. Ambassador&quot;. The show had not been written, and it never would be. Lester hoped that Rodgers would take over Pinza&#x27;s contract. Pinza had become bored as the Met&#x27;s leading lyric bass, and having played the great opera houses, sought other worlds to conquer. Rodgers immediately saw Pinza as perfect for the role of Emile. Lester carefully broached the subject to Pinza and his wife/business manager and provided them with a copy of &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot;. When Pinza read the book, he told Lester, &quot;Sell me right away!&quot; Pinza&#x27;s contract for &quot;South Pacific&quot; included a clause limiting his singing to 15 minutes per performance. With Pinza&#x27;s signing, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided to make his the lead male role, subordinating the story of the pair of young lovers. It was unusual on Broadway for the romantic lead to be an older male.
For the role of Nellie, Rodgers sought Mary Martin, who had nearly been cast to originate the role of Laurey in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; Martin was playing the title role in the touring company of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;. After Hammerstein and Rodgers saw her play in Los Angeles in mid-1948, they asked her to consider the part. Martin was reluctant to sing opposite Pinza&#x27;s powerful voice; Rodgers assured her he would see to it the two never sang at the same time, a promise he mostly kept. Rodgers and Martin lived near each other in Connecticut, and after her tour Rodgers invited Martin and her husband, Richard Halliday, to his home to hear the three songs for the musical that he had completed, none of them for Nellie. &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; especially struck Martin, and although disappointed the song was not for her, she agreed to do the part. Although Nellie and Emile were already fully developed characters in Michener&#x27;s stories, during the creation of &quot;South Pacific&quot;, Rodgers, Hammerstein and Logan began to adapt the roles specifically to the talents of Martin and Pinza and to tailor the music for their voices.

Martin influenced several of her songs. While showering one day during rehearsals, she came up with the idea for a scene in which she would shampoo her hair onstage. This gave rise to &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair&quot;. Built around a primitive shower that Logan remembered from his time in the military, the song became one of the most talked-about in &quot;South Pacific&quot;. To introduce another of Martin&#x27;s numbers to her, Rodgers called her over to his apartment, where he and Hammerstein played &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a Wonderful Guy&quot; for her. When Martin essayed it for herself, she sang the final 26 words, as intended, with a single breath, and fell off her piano bench. Rodgers gazed down at her, &quot;That&#x27;s exactly what I want. Never do it differently. We must feel you couldn&#x27;t squeeze out another sound.&quot;

The producers held extensive auditions to fill the other roles. Myron McCormick was cast as Billis; according to Logan, no one else was seriously considered. The two roles which gave the most trouble were those of Cable and Bloody Mary. They tried to get Harold Keel for the role of Cable (he had played Curly in the West End production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;) only to find that he had signed a contract with MGM under the name Howard Keel. William Tabbert was eventually cast as Cable, though Logan instructed him to lose . African-American singer Juanita Hall was cast as Bloody Mary; Logan recalled that at her audition, she took a squatting pose which proclaimed, &quot;I am Bloody Mary and don&#x27;t you dare cast anyone else!&quot; Betta St. John, who under the name Betty Striegler had replaced Bambi Linn as Louise in &quot;Carousel&quot;, took the role of Liat. Logan directed (he and Hayward co-produced with Rodgers and Hammerstein), Mielziner did the stage design, Trude Rittmann and Robert Russell Bennett prepared the orchestration, and Elizabeth Montgomery of Motley Theatre Design Group designed the costumes. Salvatore Dell&#x27;Isola served as music director.

===Original production===

Rehearsals began at Broadway&#x27;s Belasco Theatre on February 2, 1949. There was no formal chorus; each of the nurses and Seabees was given a name, and, in the case of the men, $50 to equip themselves with what clothing they felt their characters would wear from the military surplus shops which lined West 42nd Street. Don Fellows, the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to purchase a non-regulation baseball cap and black ankle boots. Martin and Pinza had not known each other, but they soon formed a strong friendship. Of the mood backstage, &quot;everyone agreed: throughout the rehearsals Logan was fiery, demanding, and brilliantly inventive.&quot; He implemented lap changes (pioneered by Rodgers and Hammerstein in &quot;Allegro&quot;), whereby the actors coming on next would already be on a darkened part of the stage as one scene concluded. This allowed the musical to continue without interruption by scene changes, making the action almost seamless. He soon had the Seabees pacing back and forth like caged animals during &quot;There Is Nothing Like a Dame&quot;, a staging so effective it was never changed during the run of the show. One Logan innovation that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly accepted was to have Cable remove his shirt during the blackout after he and Liat passionately embrace on first meeting, his partial nakedness symbolizing their lovemaking. As originally planned, Martin was supposed to conclude &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a Wonderful Guy&quot; with an exuberant cartwheel across the stage. This was eliminated after she vaulted into the orchestra pit, knocking out Rittman.

There were no major difficulties during the four weeks of rehearsal in New York; Martin later remembered that the &quot;gypsy run-through&quot; for friends and professional associates on a bare stage was met with some of the most enthusiastic applause she could remember. One of the few people having trouble was Pinza, who had difficulty adjusting to the constant alterations in the show – he was used to the operatic world, where a role rarely changed once learned. Pinza&#x27;s mispronunciations of English exasperated Logan, and driving to New Haven, Connecticut for the first week of previews, Pinza discussed with his wife the possibility of a return to the Met, where he knew audiences would welcome him. She told him to let &quot;South Pacific&quot;&#x27;s attendees decide for themselves. When the tryouts began in New Haven on March 7, the play was an immediate hit; the &quot;New Haven Register&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;South Pacific&quot; should make history&quot;.

Nevertheless, a number of changes were made in New Haven and in the subsequent two weeks of previews in Boston. The show was running long; Logan persuaded his friend, playwright Emlyn Williams, to go over the script and cut extraneous dialogue. There were wide expectations of a hit; producer Mike Todd came backstage and advised that the show not be taken to New York &quot;because it&#x27;s too damned good for them&quot;. The show moved to Boston, where it was so successful that playwright George S. Kaufman joked that people lining up there at the Shubert Theatre &quot;don&#x27;t actually want anything ... They just want to push money under the doors.&quot;
&quot;South Pacific&quot; opened on Broadway on April 7, 1949, at the Majestic Theatre. The advance sale was $400,000, and an additional $700,000 in sales was made soon after the opening. The first night audience was packed with important Broadway, business, and arts leaders. The audience repeatedly stopped the show with extended applause, which was sustained at length at the final curtain. Rodgers and Hammerstein had preferred, in the past, not to sponsor an afterparty, but they rented the St. Regis Hotel&#x27;s roof and ordered 200 copies of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the anticipation of a hit. &quot;Times&quot; critic Brooks Atkinson gave the show a rave review.

Three days after the opening, Pinza signed a contract with MGM to star in films once his obligation to appear in the show expired. He left the show June 1, 1950, replaced by Ray Middleton, though Pinza missed a number of shows due to illness before that. Martin recalled that, unused to performing eight shows a week, the former opera star would sing full out early in the week, leaving himself little voice towards the end, and would have his understudy go on. Nevertheless, during the year he was in the show, and although aged 58, he was acclaimed as a sex symbol; George Jean Nathan wrote that &quot;Pinza has taken the place of Hot Springs, Saratoga, and hormone injections for all the other old boys&quot;.

A national tour began in Cleveland, Ohio, in April 1950; it ran for five years and starred Richard Eastham as Emile, Janet Blair as Nellie and Ray Walston as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film. For the 48,000 tickets available in Cleveland, 250,000 requests were submitted, causing the box office to close for three weeks to process them. Jeanne Bal and Iva Withers were later Nellies on this tour. A scaled-down version toured military bases in Korea in 1951; by the request of Hammerstein and Rodgers, officers and enlisted soldiers sat together to view it.

Martin left the Broadway production in 1951 to appear in the original London West End production; Martha Wright replaced her. Despite the departure of both original stars, the show remained a huge attraction in New York. Cloris Leachman also played Nellie during the New York run; George Britton was among the later Emiles. The London production ran from November 1, 1951, for 802 performances at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Logan directed; Martin and Wilbur Evans starred, with Walston as Billis, Muriel Smith as Bloody Mary and Ivor Emmanuel in the small role of Sgt. Johnson. Sean Connery and Martin&#x27;s son Larry Hagman, both at the start of their careers, played Seabees in the London production; Julie Wilson eventually replaced Martin. On January 30, 1952, King George VI attended the production with his daughter Princess Elizabeth and other members of the Royal Family. He died less than a week later.

The Broadway production transferred to the Broadway Theatre in June 1953 to accommodate Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s new show, &quot;Me and Juliet&quot;, although &quot;South Pacific&quot; had to be moved to Boston for five weeks because of schedule conflicts. When it closed on January 16, 1954, after 1,925 performances, it was the second-longest-running musical in Broadway history, after &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. At the final performance, Myron McCormick, the only cast member remaining from the opening, led the performers and audience in &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;; the curtain did not fall but remained raised as the audience left the theatre.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===

On a South Pacific island during World War II, two half-Polynesian children, Ngana and Jerome, happily sing as they play together (&quot;Dites-Moi&quot;). Ensign Nellie Forbush, a naïve U.S. Navy nurse from Little Rock, Arkansas, has fallen in love with Emile de Becque, a middle-aged French plantation owner, though she has known him only briefly. Even though everyone else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is sure everything will turn out all right (&quot;A Cockeyed Optimist&quot;). Emile also loves Nellie, and each wonders if the other reciprocates those feelings (&quot;Twin Soliloquies&quot;). Emile expresses his love for Nellie, recalling how they met at the officers&#x27; club dance and instantly were attracted to each other (&quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;). Nellie, promising to think about their relationship, returns to the hospital. Emile calls Ngana and Jerome to him, revealing to the audience that they are his children, unbeknownst to Nellie.

Meanwhile, the restless American Seabees, led by crafty Luther Billis, lament the absence of available women – Navy nurses are commissioned officers and off-limits to enlisted men. There is one civilian woman on the island, nicknamed &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;, a sassy middle-aged Tonkinese vendor of grass skirts, who engages the sailors in sarcastic, flirtatious banter as she tries to sell them her wares (&quot;Bloody Mary&quot;). Billis yearns to visit the nearby island of Bali Ha&#x27;i – which is off-limits to all but officers – supposedly to witness a Boar&#x27;s Tooth Ceremony (at which he can get an unusual native artifact); the other sailors josh him, saying that his real motivation is to see the young French women there. Billis and the sailors further lament their lack of female companionship (&quot;There Is Nothing Like a Dame&quot;).
U.S. Marine Lieutenant Cable arrives on the island from Guadalcanal, having been sent to take part in a dangerous spy mission whose success could turn the tide of the war against Japan. Bloody Mary tries to persuade Cable to visit &quot;Bali Ha&#x27;i&quot;, mysteriously telling him that it is &quot;his&quot; special island. Billis, seeing an opportunity, urges Cable to go. Cable meets with his commanding officers, Captain George Brackett and Commander William Harbison, who plan to ask Emile to help with the mission because he used to live on the island where the mission will take place. They ask Nellie to help them find out more about Emile&#x27;s background, for example, his politics and why he left France. They have heard, for instance, that Emile committed a murder, and this might make him less than desirable for such a mission.

After thinking a bit more about Emile and deciding she has become attracted on the basis of little knowledge of him, Nellie tells the other nurses that she intends to end her relationship with him (&quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair&quot;). But when he arrives unexpectedly and invites Nellie to a party where he will introduce her to his friends, she accepts. Emile declares his love for Nellie and asks her to marry him. When she mentions politics, he speaks of universal freedom, and describes fleeing France after standing up against a bully, who died accidentally as the two fought. After hearing this, Nellie agrees to marry Emile. After he exits, Nellie joyously gives voice to her feelings (&quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a Wonderful Guy&quot;).
Cable&#x27;s mission is to land on a Japanese-held island and report on Japanese ship movements. The Navy officers ask Emile to be Cable&#x27;s guide, but he refuses their request because of his hopes for a new life with Nellie. Commander Harbison, the executive officer, tells Cable to go on leave until the mission can take place, and Billis obtains a boat and takes Cable to Bali Ha&#x27;i. There, Billis participates in the native ceremony, while Bloody Mary introduces Cable to her beautiful daughter, Liat, with whom he must communicate haltingly in French. Believing that Liat&#x27;s only chance at a better life is to marry an American officer, Mary leaves Liat alone with Cable. The two are instantly attracted to each other and make love (&quot;Younger Than Springtime&quot;). Billis and the rest of the crew are ready to leave the island, yet must wait for Cable who, unbeknownst to them, is with Liat (&quot;Bali Ha&#x27;i&quot; (reprise)). Bloody Mary proudly tells Billis that Cable is going to be her son-in-law.

Meanwhile, after Emile&#x27;s party, he and Nellie reflect on how happy they are to be in love (Reprises of &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a Wonderful Guy&quot;, &quot;Twin Soliloquies&quot;, &quot;Cockeyed Optimist&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair&quot;). Emile introduces Nellie to Jerome and Ngana. Though she finds them charming, she is shocked when Emile reveals that they are his children by his first wife, a dark-skinned Polynesian woman, now deceased. Nellie is unable to overcome her deep-seated racial prejudices and tearfully leaves Emile, after which he reflects sadly on what might have been (&quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; (reprise)).

===Act II ===

It is Thanksgiving Day. The GIs and nurses dance in a holiday revue titled &quot;Thanksgiving Follies&quot;. In the past week, an epidemic of malaria has hit the island of Bali Ha&#x27;i. Having visited Bali Ha&#x27;i often to be with Liat, Cable is also ill, but escapes from the hospital to be with Liat. As Liat and Cable spend more time together, Bloody Mary is delighted. She encourages them to continue their carefree life on the island (&quot;Happy Talk&quot;) and urges them to marry. Cable, aware of his family&#x27;s prejudices, says he cannot marry a Tonkinese girl. Bloody Mary furiously drags her distraught daughter away, telling Cable that Liat must now marry a much older French plantation owner instead. Cable laments his loss (&quot;Younger Than Springtime&quot; (reprise)).

For the final number of the Thanksgiving Follies, Nellie performs a comedy burlesque dressed as a sailor singing the praises of &quot;his&quot; sweetheart (&quot;Honey Bun&quot;). Billis plays Honey Bun, dressed in a blond wig, grass skirt and coconut-shell bra. After the show, Emile asks Nellie to reconsider. She insists that she cannot feel the same way about him since she knows about his children&#x27;s Polynesian mother. Frustrated and uncomprehending, Emile asks Cable why he and Nellie have such prejudices. Cable, filled with self-loathing, replies that &quot;it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re born with&quot;, yet it is an ingrained part of their upbringing (&quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Carefully Taught&quot;). He also vows that if he gets out of the war alive, he won&#x27;t go home to the United States; everything he wants is on these islands. Emile imagines what might have been (&quot;This Nearly Was Mine&quot;). Dejected and feeling that he has nothing to lose, he agrees to join Cable on his dangerous mission.
The mission begins with plenty of air support. Offstage, Billis stows away on the plane, falls out when the plane is hit by anti-aircraft fire, and ends up in the ocean waiting to be rescued; the massive rescue operation inadvertently becomes a diversion that allows Emile and Cable to land on the other side of the island undetected. The two send back reports on Japanese ships&#x27; movements in the &quot;Slot&quot;, a strategic strait; American aircraft intercept and destroy the Japanese ships. When the Japanese Zeros strafe the Americans&#x27; position, Emile narrowly escapes, but Cable is killed.

Nellie learns of Cable&#x27;s death and that Emile is missing. She realizes that she was foolish to reject Emile. Bloody Mary and Liat come to Nellie asking where Cable is; Mary explains that Liat refuses to marry anyone but him. Nellie comforts Liat. Cable and Emile&#x27;s espionage work has made it possible for a major offensive, Operation &quot;Alligator&quot;, to begin. The previously idle fighting men, including Billis, go off to battle.

Nellie spends time with Jerome and Ngana and soon comes to love them. While the children are teaching her to sing &quot;Dites-Moi&quot;, suddenly Emile&#x27;s voice joins them. Emile has returned to discover that Nellie has overcome her prejudices and has fallen in love with his children. Emile, Nellie and the children rejoice (&quot;Dites-Moi&quot; (reprise)).

=== Additional songs ===

A number of songs were extensively modified or omitted in the weeks leading up to the initial Broadway opening. They are listed in the order of their one-time placement within the show:
* &quot;Bright Canary Yellow&quot;, a short song for Nellie and Emile, was placed just before &quot;A Cockeyed Optimist&quot;, of which the opening line, &quot;When the sky is a bright canary yellow&quot; was intended to play off of the earlier song.
* &quot;Now Is the Time&quot; (Emile) was placed in the beach scene (Act I, Scene 7) just after Emile tells Nellie why he killed the man in France. It was to be reprised after &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Carefully Taught&quot;, but it was felt that for Emile to remain on stage while singing of immediate action was self-contradictory. It was replaced in Act I by a reprise of &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;; in Act II it was initially replaced by &quot;Will You Marry Me?&quot; (later repurposed for &quot;Pipe Dream&quot;) on March 24, 1949, and then by &quot;This Nearly Was Mine&quot; on March 29, just over a week before the Broadway opening on April 7.
* &quot;Loneliness of Evening&quot; (Emile) was cut before the Broadway opening. It was to occur in the first backstage scene (Act II, Scene 2) prior to &quot;Happy Talk&quot; and was sung to the same melody as &quot;Bright Canary Yellow&quot;. Its melody can be heard in the 1958 film as Emile reads aloud the card with the flowers he has brought backstage for Nellie to the Thanksgiving show; the second stanza was repurposed and sung by the Prince in the 1965 TV production of &quot;Cinderella&quot;.
* A reprise of &quot;Younger Than Springtime&quot; that follows Cable&#x27;s rejection of Liat, was added after January 1949. It followed two separate attempts at songs for Cable. One song, designated as &quot;My Friend&quot; was a duet for Cable and Liat, included such lyrics as &quot;My friend, my friend, is coming around the bend&quot; and was rejected by Logan as one of the worst he&#x27;d ever heard. Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s second attempt to place a song there, &quot;Suddenly Lucky&quot;, was considered by Logan too lightweight and was later repurposed for &quot;The King and I&quot; as &quot;Getting to Know You&quot;. The melody for &quot;Younger than Springtime&quot; was from a song, &quot;My Wife&quot;, intended for &quot;Allegro&quot; but not used.
* &quot;Honey Bun&quot; was not included in the January 1949 libretto (a note marks that the lyrics will be supplied later).
* &quot;My Girl Back Home&quot; (Cable) preceded &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to be Carefully Taught&quot; in the original score but was cut before the first Broadway production. It appears in the movie version as a duet for Nellie and Cable. It was reinstated for the 2002 London revival, for Cable.
* &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to be Carefully Taught&quot; originally had several singing lines for Emile following the conclusion of the lyrics for Cable.

==Subsequent productions==

===20th century===

The first Australian production opened in September 1952 at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Melbourne, playing for 10 months and 333 performances. It then played seasons in Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide until late 1954, before returning to Melbourne for a further season.

A limited run of &quot;South Pacific&quot; by the New York City Center Light Opera Company opened at New York City Center on May 4, 1955, closing on May 15, 1955. It was directed by Charles Atkin, and had costumes by Motley and sets by Mielziner. The cast included Richard Collett as Emile, Sandra Deel as Nellie, Carol Lawrence as Liat, Sylvia Syms as Bloody Mary and Gene Saks as the Professor. A second limited run of the same production with a different cast opened at City Center on April 24, 1957, closing on May 12, 1957. It was directed by Jean Dalrymple, and the cast included Robert Wright as Emile, Mindy Carson as Nellie and Hall reprising the role of Bloody Mary. That production was given again in 1961, this time with Ann McLerie and William Chapman in the lead roles.

There have been many stock or summer revivals of &quot;South Pacific&quot;. One, in 1957 at Long Island&#x27;s Westbury Music Fair, occurred at the same time that Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus was resisting the integration of Central High School by the Little Rock Nine. Nellie&#x27;s pronouncement that she was from Little Rock was initially met with boos. Logan refused to allow Nellie&#x27;s hometown to be changed, so a speech was made before each performance asking for the audience&#x27;s forbearance, which was forthcoming.
There were two revivals at Lincoln Center. Richard Rodgers produced the 1967 revival, which starred Florence Henderson and Giorgio Tozzi, who had been Rossano Brazzi&#x27;s singing voice in the 1958 film. Joe Layton was the director; Eleanor Calbes&#x27;s casting as Liat led to the addition of a reprise of &quot;Bali Ha&#x27;i&quot; for her. The cast album was issued on LP and later on CD. The musical toured North America from 1986 to 1988, headlined by Robert Goulet and Barbara Eden, with David Carroll as Cable, Armelia McQueen as Bloody Mary and Lia Chang as Liat, first directed by Geraldine Fitzgerald and then Ron Field. A New York City Opera production in 1987 featured alternating performers Justino Díaz and Stanley Wexler as Emile, and Susan Bigelow and Marcia Mitzman as Nellie.

A 1988 West End revival starred Gemma Craven and Emile Belcourt, supported by Bertice Reading, among others, and was directed by Roger Redfern. It ran at the Prince of Wales Theatre from January 20, 1988, to January 14, 1989.

=== 21st century ===
A new production with slight revisions to the book and score was produced by the Royal National Theatre at the company&#x27;s Olivier Theatre in London for a limited run from December 2001 through April 2002, timed to celebrate the centenary of Richard Rodgers&#x27; birth. Trevor Nunn directed, with musical staging by Matthew Bourne and designs by John Napier. Lauren Kennedy was Nellie, and Australian actor Philip Quast played Emile. Borrowing from the 1958 film, this production placed the first Emile-Nellie scene after the introduction of Cable, Billis and Bloody Mary.

A British touring production of &quot;South Pacific&quot; opened at the Blackpool Grand Theatre on August 28, 2007. The tour ended at the Cardiff New Theatre on July 19, 2008. It starred Helena Blackman as Nellie and Dave Willetts as Emile. Julian Woolford directed, with choreography by Chris Hocking. This production was most noted for its staging of the overture, which charted Nellie&#x27;s journey from Little Rock, Arkansas, to the South Pacific. On entering the theatre, the audience first saw a map of the U.S., not the theater of war.

A Broadway revival of &quot;South Pacific&quot; opened on April 3, 2008, at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Vivian Beaumont Theater. Bartlett Sher directed, with musical staging by Christopher Gattelli and associate choreographer Joe Langworth. The opening cast starred Kelli O&#x27;Hara as Nellie, Paulo Szot as Emile and Matthew Morrison as Lt. Cable, with Danny Burstein as Billis and Loretta Ables Sayre as Bloody Mary. Laura Osnes replaced O&#x27;Hara during her seven-month maternity leave, beginning in March 2009, and also between January and August 2010. Szot alternated with David Pittsinger as Emile. The production closed on August 22, 2010, after 37 previews and 996 regular performances. The production, with most of the original principals, was taped and broadcast live in HD on August 18, 2010, on the PBS television show &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot;. With a few exceptions, the production received rave reviews. Ben Brantley wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
A U.S. national tour based on the 2008 revival began in San Francisco at the Golden Gate Theatre on September 18, 2009. Sher directed, and the cast starred Rod Gilfry (Emile) and Carmen Cusack (Nellie). A Sher production opened at the Barbican Theatre in London on August 15, 2011, and closed on October 1, 2011, with the same creative team from the Broadway revival. Szot and Welsh National Opera singer Jason Howard alternated in the role of Emile, with Samantha Womack as Nellie, Ables Sayre as Bloody Mary and Alex Ferns as Billis. The production received mostly positive reviews. A U.K tour followed, with Womack, Ables Sayre and Ferns. The Sher production was also produced by Opera Australia at the Sydney Opera House from August to September 2012 and then at Princess Theatre, Melbourne through October 2012. It starred Teddy Tahu Rhodes as Emile, Lisa McCune as Nellie, Kate Ceberano as Bloody Mary and Eddie Perfect as Billis. It then played in Brisbane for the 2012 holiday season, with Christine Anu as Bloody Mary, and resumed touring in Australia in September 2013.

A Chichester Festival Theatre revival from July to September 2021 was directed by Daniel Evans and starred Gina Beck and Alex Young sharing the role of Nellie, Julian Ovenden as Emile and Joanna Ampil as Bloody Mary. Beck left the cast in August 2021 on maternity leave. The production began a UK and Ireland tour at the Manchester Opera House in July 2022 and Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in July and August 2022 with the same cast (minus Young) and received positive reviews. The tour continued until November 2022. A U.S. national tour opened on February 7, 2022, at the RP Funding Center theater in Lakeland, Florida, starring Jared Bybee as Emile and Maris McCulley as Nellie. It closed on May 22, 2022 in New Bedford, Massachusetts.

==Reception and success==

===Critical reception===
Reviewers gave the original production uniformly glowing reviews; one critic called it &quot;South Terrific&quot;. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; wrote:
The &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; critic wrote, &quot;Programmed as a musical play, &quot;South Pacific&quot; is just that. It boasts no ballets and no hot hoofing. It has no chorus in the conventional sense. Every one in it plays a part. It is likely to establish a new trend in musicals.&quot; The review continued: &quot;Every number is so outstanding that it is difficult to decide which will be the most popular.&quot; The review in &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; found the show to be &quot;the ultimate modern blending of music and popular theatre to date, with the finest kind of balance between story and song, and hilarity and heartbreak.&quot; Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; especially praised Pinza&#x27;s performance: &quot;Mr. Pinza&#x27;s bass voice is the most beautiful that has been heard on a Broadway stage for an eon or two. He sings ... with infinite delicacy of feeling and loveliness of tone.&quot; He declared that &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, sung by Pinza, &quot;ought to become reasonably immortal.&quot; Richard Watts, Jr. of the &quot;New York Post&quot; focused on Mary Martin&#x27;s performance, writing, &quot;nothing I have ever seen her do prepared me for the loveliness, humor, gift for joyous characterization, and sheer lovableness of her portrayal of Nellie Forbush ... who is so shocked to find her early racial prejudices cropping up. Hers is a completely irresistible performance.&quot;

When &quot;South Pacific&quot; opened in London in November 1951, the reviews were mixed. London&#x27;s &quot;Daily Express&quot; praised the music but disliked other elements of that show, writing, &quot;We got a 42nd Street &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, the weakest of all the Hammerstein-Rodgers musicals. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; suggested, &quot;The play moved so slowly between its songs that it seemed more like &quot;South Soporific&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; applauded the songs but indicated that &quot;before the end the singing and the dancing have dwindled to almost nothing, while the rather sad little tale is slowly and conventionally wound up.&quot; &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, however, noted the anticipation in advance of the opening and concluded that &quot;there was no disappointment ... the show bounces the audience and well deserves the cheers.&quot; Drama critic Kenneth Tynan of &quot;The Spectator&quot; wrote that &quot;South Pacific&quot; was &quot;the first musical romance which was seriously involved in an adult subject ... I have nothing to do but thank Logan, Rodgers and Hammerstein and climb up from my knees, a little cramped from the effort of typing in such an unusual position.&quot;

A 2006 review asserted: &quot;Many are the knowledgeable and discriminating people for whom Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;South Pacific&quot;, brilliantly co-written and staged by Joshua Logan, was the greatest musical of all.&quot; In 1987, John Rockwell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the City Opera production, commenting that while &quot;South Pacific&quot; had been innovative for 1949, &quot;Sondheim has long since transcended its formal innovations, and the constant reprises of the big tunes sound mechanical. In 1949, &quot;South Pacific&quot; epitomized the concerns of the day – America&#x27;s responsibilities in the world and the dangers of racism. ... At its 1967 State Theater revival, the show struck many as dated. It still seems that way, with &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; having contemporized this same setting&quot;. A 2008 &quot;Huffington Post&quot; review criticized the play as having an Orientalist and Western-centric storyline in which stereotypical natives take on &quot;exotic background roles&quot; in relation to Americans, and it characterized the relationship between Cable and Liat as underage prostitution, charging that she &quot;speaks not a word in the whole musical, only smiles and takes the Yankee to bed.&quot; &quot;South Pacific&quot; is the only major American musical set in World War II, but former Marine Robert Leckie wrote his memoir of that conflict, &quot;Helmet for My Pillow&quot;, after he walked out of a performance: &quot;I have to tell the story of how it really was. I have to let people know the war wasn&#x27;t a musical.&quot;

===Box office and awards===

&quot;South Pacific&quot; opened on Broadway with $400,000 in advance sales. People were so eager to obtain tickets that the press wrote about the lengths people had gone to in getting them. Because &quot;house seats&quot; were being sold by scalpers for $200 or more, the attorney general&#x27;s office threatened to close the show. The parties who provided the scalpers with the tickets were never identified, and the show ran without interference. The production had a $50,600 weekly gross, and ran for 1,925 performances. The national tour began in 1950 and grossed $3,000,000 in the first year, making $1,500,000 in profit. The original cast album, priced at $4.85, sold more than a million copies.

The original production of &quot;South Pacific&quot; won ten Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Male Performer (Pinza), Best Female Performer (Martin), Best Supporting Male Performer (McCormick), Best Supporting Female Performer (Hall), Best Director (Logan), Best Book and Best Score. As of 2016, it is the only show to win Tonys in all four acting categories. In 1950, the musical won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the second musical to do so after &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot;, which won in 1932. Rodgers became the first composer of musical comedy to win the Pulitzer, as composer George Gershwin had not been recognized for &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot;. The Pulitzer Prize was initially given only to Rodgers and Hammerstein; Logan was later recognized in an amended announcement, much to his annoyance.

The 2001 London revival garnered a Laurence Olivier Award for Philip Quast (Emile). The 2008 revival won seven Tony Awards, including Best Revival (Sher and Szot also won, and the show won in all four design categories), and five Drama Desk Awards, including Outstanding Musical Revival. The late Robert Russell Bennett was also honored that season for &quot;his historic contribution to American musical theatre in the field of orchestrations, as represented on Broadway this season by Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;South Pacific&quot;.&quot; As of 2016, this was the musical revival with the most Tony Awards. The 2011 London production received three Olivier Award nominations, including Best Musical Revival, but won none.

== Themes and cultural effect ==

=== Race ===
Part of the reason why &quot;South Pacific&quot; is considered a classic is its confrontation of racism. According to professor Philip Beidler, &quot;Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s attempt to use the Broadway theater to make a courageous statement against racial bigotry in general and institutional racism in the postwar United States in particular&quot; forms part of &quot;South Pacific&quot;&#x27;s legend. Although &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot; treats the question of racism, it does not give it the central place that it takes in the musical. Andrea Most, writing on the &quot;politics of race&quot; in &quot;South Pacific&quot;, suggests that in the late 1940s, American liberals, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, turned to the fight for racial equality as a practical means of advancing their progressive views without risking being deemed communists. Trevor Nunn, director of the 2001 West End production, notes the importance of the fact that Nellie, a southerner, ends the play about to be the mother in an interracial family: &quot;It&#x27;s being performed in America in 1949. That&#x27;s the resonance.&quot;

From the early drafts, Hammerstein and Logan made the issue of racial prejudice central to the story. Hammerstein repeatedly rewrote the Act II backstage scene where Emile, Nellie and Cable confront the question of the Americans&#x27; racism. As critic Robert Butler pointed out in his educational companion to the 2001 London production, &quot;if one young person has a prejudice, it might be a character flaw; if two young people share a prejudice, it tells us something about the society in which they grew up&quot;. In one draft, Emile advises that the Americans are no better than the Axis Powers, in their prejudice, and suggests they go home to sing songs about how all are created free and equal. Lovensheimer states that a postwar American audience would have found such onstage sentiments to be offensive. In the staged version, Emile&#x27;s expressions are limited to two lines arguing that prejudice is not inborn.
At the heart of this scene is Cable&#x27;s song &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Carefully Taught&quot;, in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most controversial element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song&#x27;s removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, &quot;That&#x27;s what the show is about!&quot; Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less &quot;briskly&quot;, as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that this was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of &quot;something called &#x27;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Taught&#x27;, a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing&quot; while John Mason Brown opined that he was &quot;somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as &#x27;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Taught&#x27;&quot;. After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Carefully Taught&quot;. Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote &quot;What can I say to a man who writes, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got to be taught to hate and fear?&#x27; ... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn&#x27;t praise you enough.&quot; Nevertheless, another wrote, &quot;I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding&quot;.

When the tour of the show reached a racially segregated theatre in Wilmington, Delaware, Rodgers and Hammerstein threatened to cancel the performances there unless seating was integrated, which it was. In 1953, with the tour in Atlanta, there was controversy over &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Carefully Taught&quot;. Two Georgia state legislators, Senator John D. Shepard and Representative David C. Jones, objected to the song, stating that though &quot;South Pacific&quot; was a fine piece of entertainment, that song &quot;contained an underlying philosophy inspired by Moscow&quot;, and explained, &quot;Intermarriage produces half-breeds. And half-breeds are not conducive to the higher type of society. ... In the South, we have pure blood lines and we intend to keep it that way.&quot; They stated that they planned to introduce legislation to outlaw such communist-inspired works. The Northern press had a field day; Hammerstein, when asked for comment, responded that he did not think the legislators were representing their constituents very well, and that he was surprised at the suggestion that anything kind and decent must necessarily originate in Moscow. In part because of the song, touring companies of &quot;South Pacific&quot; had difficulty getting bookings in the Deep South.
In the final scene of Act I, Nellie rejects Emile because of his part-Polynesian children. In so doing, Nellie fails to live up to the American ideal that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;, which Emile had earlier affirmed. This scene was also toned down by Hammerstein; in early drafts, Nellie, initially unable to force out a word to describe Emile&#x27;s first wife, after he supplies the word &quot;Polynesian&quot;, responds with &quot;colored&quot;. This pronouncement, which makes Nellie less sympathetic as a character, was restored for the 2008 Lincoln Center production. As Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;it&#x27;s upsetting because Nellie isn&#x27;t some cracker stereotype – she&#x27;s lovable ... But how can we love a racist?&quot; Most argues that even Emile is tainted by racism, as his lifestyle is dependent on the maintenance of a system whereby he benefits from underpaid native labor – Bloody Mary is able to attract workers to make grass skirts for sale to GIs because, as she puts it, &quot;French planters stingy bastards!&quot;

=== Sex and gender roles ===
Nellie Forbush, in her journey from Little Rock, Arkansas, to serving as a Navy nurse and on to the domesticity of the final scene of &quot;South Pacific&quot;, parallels the experience of many American women of the period. They entered the workforce during the war, only to find afterwards a societal expectation that they give up their jobs to men, with their best route to financial security being marriage and becoming a housewife. One means of securing audience acceptance of Nellie&#x27;s choices was the sanitization of her sexual past from her counterpart in the Michener work – that character had a 4-F boyfriend back in Arkansas and a liaison with Bill Harbison while on the island.
The male characters in &quot;South Pacific&quot; are intended to appear conventionally masculine. In the aftermath of World War II, the masculinity of the American soldier was beyond public question. Cable&#x27;s virility with Liat is made evident to the audience. Although Billis operates a laundry – Nellie particularly praises his pleats – and appears in a grass skirt in the &quot;Thanksgiving Follies&quot;, these acts are consistent with his desire for money and are clearly intended to be comic. His interest in the young women on Bali H&#x27;ai establishes his masculinity. Lovensheimer writes that Billis is more defined by class than by sexuality, evidenced by the Seabee&#x27;s assumption, on learning that Cable went to college in New Jersey, that it was Rutgers (the state&#x27;s flagship public university), rather than Ivy League Princeton, and by his delight on learning that the rescue operation for him had cost $600,000 when his uncle had told him he would never be worth a dime.

Meryle Secrest, in her biography of Rodgers, theorizes that &quot;South Pacific&quot; marks a transition for the pair &quot;between heroes and heroines who are more or less evenly matched in age and stories about powerful older men and the younger women who are attracted to them&quot;. Lovensheimer points out that this pattern only holds for two of their five subsequent musicals, &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and in the former, the love between Anna and the King is not expressed in words. He believes a different transition took place: that their plots, beginning with &quot;South Pacific&quot;, involve a woman needing to enter and accept her love interest&#x27;s world to be successful and accepted herself. He notes that both &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;Carousel&quot; involve a man entering his wife&#x27;s world, Curly in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; about to become a farmer with expectations of success, whereas Billy Bigelow in &quot;Carousel&quot; fails to find work after leaving his place as a barker. Lovensheimer deems &quot;Allegro&quot; to be a transition, where the attempts of the lead female character to alter her husband Joe&#x27;s world to suit her ambition lead to the breakup of their marriage. He argues that the nurse Emily, who goes with Joe in his return to the small town where he was happy, is a forerunner of Nellie, uprooting her life in Chicago for Joe.

Secrest notes that much is overlooked in the rush to have love conquer all in &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;questions of the long-term survival of a marriage between a sophisticate who read Proust at bedtime and a girl who liked Dinah Shore and did not read anything were raised by Nellie Forbush only to be brushed aside. As for the interracial complexities of raising two Polynesian children, all such issues were subsumed in the general euphoria of true love.&quot; Lovensheimer too wonders how Nellie will fare as the second Madame de Becque: &quot;little Nellie Forbush from Arkansas ends up in a tropical paradise, far from her previous world, with a husband, a servant, and two children who speak a language she does not understand&quot;.

=== Cultural effect ===

A mammoth hit, &quot;South Pacific&quot; sparked huge media and public attention. &quot;South Pacific&quot; was one of the first shows for which a variety of souvenirs were available: fans could buy &quot;South Pacific&quot; neckties, or for women, lipstick and scarves. Fake ticket stubs could be purchased for use as status symbols. There were &quot;South Pacific&quot; music boxes, dolls, fashion accessories, and even hairbrushes for use after washing men from hair. Martin&#x27;s on-stage shower prompted an immediate fashion craze for short hair that could be managed through once-a-day washing at home, rather than in a beauty salon, and for the products which would allow for such care. The songs of &quot;South Pacific&quot; could be heard on the radio, and they were popular among dance bands and in piano lounges. Mordden comments that &quot;South Pacific&quot; contained nothing but hit songs; Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s other successful works always included at least one song which did not become popular.

The cast album, recorded ten days after the show&#x27;s opening, was an immediate hit. Released by Columbia Records, it spent 69 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard and a total of 400 weeks on the charts, becoming the best-selling record of the 1940s. It was one of the early LP records, with a turntable speed of 33 rpm, and helped to popularize that technology – previously, show albums and operas had been issued on sets of 78 rpm records, with high prices and much less music on a single disc. In the years to come, the LP would become the medium of choice for the &quot;longhair&quot; music niche of show, opera and classical performances.

An indirect effect of the success of the show was the career of James Michener. His one percent of the show as author of the source material, plus the income from a share which the duo allowed him to buy on credit, made him financially independent and allowed him to quit his job as an editor at Macmillan and to become a full-time writer. Over the next five decades, his lengthy, detailed novels centering on different places would dominate the bestseller lists.

== Music and recordings ==

=== Musical treatment ===
The role of Nellie Forbush was the first time with Hammerstein that Rodgers made the leading female role a belter, rather than a lyric soprano like Laurey in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and Julie in &quot;Carousel&quot;. According to Mordden, &quot;Nellie was something new in R&amp;H, carrying a goodly share of the score on a &#x27;Broadway&#x27; voice&quot;.

Nellie does not sing together with Emile, because Rodgers promised Martin that she would not have to compete vocally with Pinza, but the composer sought to unite them in the underlying music. A tetrachord, heard before we see either lead, is played during the instrumental introduction to &quot;Dites-Moi&quot;, the show&#x27;s first song. Considered as pitch classes, that is, as pitches without characterization by octave or register, the motif is C-B-A-G. It will be heard repeatedly in Nellie&#x27;s music, or in the music (such as &quot;Twin Soliloquies&quot;) that she shares with Emile, and even in the bridge of &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;. Lovensheimer argues that this symbolizes what Nellie is trying to say with her Act II line &quot;We&#x27;re the same sort of people fundamentally – you and me&quot;.

Originally, &quot;Twin Soliloquies&quot; came to an end shortly after the vocal part finishes. Logan found this unsatisfying and worked with Trude Rittmann to find a better ending to the song. This piece of music, dubbed &quot;Unspoken Thoughts&quot;, continues the music as Nellie and Emile sip brandy together, and is called by Lovensheimer &quot;the one truly operatic moment of the score&quot;. &quot;This Nearly Was Mine&quot; is a big bass solo for Emile in waltz time, deemed by Rodgers biographer William G. Hyland as &quot;one of his finest efforts&quot;. Only five notes are used in the first four bars, a phrase which is then repeated with a slight variation in the following four bars. The song ends an octave higher than where it began, making it perfect for Pinza&#x27;s voice.

Two songs, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair&quot; and &quot;Honey Bun&quot; are intended to imitate American popular songs of the 1940s. In the former, the triple recitation of the song title at intervals suggests a big band arrangement of the wartime era, while in the bridge, the final eight bars (repeating the lyrics from the bridge&#x27;s first eight bars) gives a suggestion of swing. The sections beginning &quot;If the man don&#x27;t understand you&quot; and &quot;If you laugh at different comics&quot; have a blues style. Lovensheimer deems the song &quot;Nellie&#x27;s spontaneous and improvisatory expression of her feelings through the vocabulary of popular song&quot;. Mordden suggests that &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a Wonderful Guy&quot; with its &quot;take no prisoners bounce&quot;, might well be the center of the score, with the typical American girl defending her love by spouting clichés, many of which, such as &quot;corny as Kansas in August&quot; Hammerstein made up, and &quot;sure enough, over the years they have become clichés&quot;.

=== Recordings ===

Columbia Records recorded the overture and most of the songs from the original production in 1949, using members of the cast including Ezio Pinza and Mary Martin. Drawing from the original lacquer disc masters, Columbia released the album both on 78-rpm discs and the new LP record format in 1949. According to critic John Kenrick, the original cast recording &quot;is the rare stuff that lasting legends are made of&quot;, an essential classic. The album was number one from mid-1949 and throughout most of 1950 for a record 63 weeks, selling more than one million copies. A CD was released by Sony in 1988 from the previously unused magnetic tape recording from the same 1949 sessions in New York City. The CD includes the bonus tracks &quot;Loneliness of Evening&quot; (recorded in 1949 by Mary Martin), &quot;My Girl Back Home&quot; (Martin), &quot;Bali Ha&#x27;i&quot; (Pinza) and Symphonic Scenario for Concert Orchestra (original orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett). The original cast album was added to the National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress on March 21, 2013, for long-term preservation. The film soundtrack was released on the RCA Victor label in March 1958. Kenrick calls the recording &quot;mixed up&quot; and does not recommend it.

Masterworks Broadway released a recording of the 1967 Lincoln Center production starring Florence Henderson as Nellie, Giorgio Tozzi as Emile, Justin McDonough as Cable and Irene Byatt as Bloody Mary. The recording includes a version of &quot;Bali Ha&#x27;i&quot;, sung in French by Eleanor Calbes, the Liat. According to Kenrick, &quot;Every track of this 1967 Lincoln Center cast recording is such a winner that you can&#x27;t help wondering why it took so long for this winner to make its way to CD.&quot; Kenrick notes that the album is a more complete alternative to the original cast album.

In 1986 José Carreras and Kiri Te Kanawa made a studio recording of &quot;South Pacific&quot;, the sessions of which were filmed as a documentary, similar in style to Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s successful &quot;West Side Story&quot; documentary a year earlier that featured the same stars. Emile&#x27;s music was transposed to fit Carreras&#x27;s tenor voice. The recording also featured Sarah Vaughan as Bloody Mary and Mandy Patinkin as Cable. Stephen Holden reviewed the album in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;the star of this &quot;South Pacific&quot; isn&#x27;t any individual, but rather the score itself&quot;. Kenrick calls the recording badly miscast &quot;pretentious trash&quot;. Kenrick gives mixed praise to the 1988 London revival cast album.

The 2001 Royal National Theatre&#x27;s revival cast album was recorded in 2002 on First Night Records with Philip Quast as Emile, Lauren Kennedy as Nellie, Edward Baker-Duly as Cable, Sheila Francisco as Bloody Mary and Nick Holder as Billis. The album includes the cut song, &quot;Now Is the Time&quot;. While Kenrick allows that most critics like the recording, he finds it a waste of money. The 2005 Carnegie Hall concert version was released on April 18, 2006, by Decca Broadway with Reba McEntire as Nellie, Brian Stokes Mitchell as Emile, Lillias White as Bloody Mary, Jason Danieley as Cable and Alec Baldwin as Billis. Kenrick describes this recording as &quot;one of the most ravishing that this glorious Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein classic has ever received&quot; and &quot;a show tune lover&#x27;s dream come true.&quot; The 2008 Broadway revival cast album was released on May 27, 2008, by Masterworks Broadway. Kenrick finds it &quot;very satisfying&quot;.

==Film and television versions==

&quot;South Pacific&quot; was made into a film of the same name in 1958, and it topped the box office that year. Joshua Logan directed the film, which starred Rossano Brazzi, Mitzi Gaynor, John Kerr, Ray Walston, Juanita Hall and France Nuyen; all of their singing voices except Gaynor&#x27;s and Walston&#x27;s were dubbed. Thurl Ravenscroft, later television&#x27;s Tony the Tiger, sang the basso profundo notes in &quot;There Is Nothing Like a Dame&quot;. The film opened with Cable&#x27;s flight to the island in a PBY, followed by the Seabees&#x27; beach scene, and added Billis&#x27; rescue and scenes from the mission to spy on the Japanese. The film won the Academy Award for Best Sound. It was also nominated for the Oscar for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture (Alfred Newman and Ken Darby), and the 65 mm Todd-AO cinematography by Leon Shamroy was also nominated. The film was widely criticized for its use of color to indicate mood, with actors changing color as they began to sing. The film includes the song &quot;My Girl Back Home&quot;, sung by Cable, which was cut from the stage musical. The movie was the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. of the 1950s; its UK revenues were the highest ever, a record it kept until &quot;Goldfinger&quot; in 1963. Although reviewers have criticized the film – &quot;Time&quot; magazine stated that it was &quot;almost impossible to make a bad movie out of it – but the moviemakers appear to have tried&quot; – it has added success on television, videotape and DVD to its box office laurels.

A made-for-television film, directed by Richard Pearce, was produced and televised in 2001, starring Glenn Close as Nellie, Harry Connick, Jr. as Cable and Rade Sherbedgia as Emile. This version changed the order of the musical&#x27;s songs (the film opens with &quot;There Is Nothing Like a Dame&quot;) and omits &quot;Happy Talk&quot;. &quot;My Girl Back Home&quot; was filmed but not included in the broadcast due to time constraints; it was restored for the DVD, issued in 2001. The last half-hour of the film features scenes of war, including shots of segregated troops. Lovensheimer states that the film returned to the Michener original in one respect: &quot;Harry Connick Jr.&#x27;s Joe Cable is a fascinating combination of sensitive leading man and believable Leatherneck&quot;.
The movie and Close were praised by &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Ms. Close, lean and more mature, hints that a touch of desperation lies in Nellie&#x27;s cockeyed optimism.&quot; The review also commented that the movie &quot;is beautifully produced, better than the stagy 1958 film&quot; and praised the singing. Kenrick, however, dislikes the adaptation: &quot;You certainly won&#x27;t ever want to put this disaster in your player, unless you want to hear the sound of Rodgers and Hammerstein whirling in their graves. Glenn Close is up to the material, but her supporting cast is uniformly disastrous. A pointless and offensive waste of money, time and talent.&quot;

A 2005 concert version of the musical, edited down to two hours, but including all of the songs and the full musical score, was presented at Carnegie Hall. It starred Reba McEntire as Nellie, Brian Stokes Mitchell as Emile, Alec Baldwin as Billis and Lillias White as Bloody Mary. The production used Robert Russell Bennett&#x27;s original orchestrations and the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s directed by Paul Gemignani. It was taped and telecast by PBS in 2006 and released the same year on DVD. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Ben Brantley wrote, &quot;Open-voiced and open-faced, Reba McEntire was born to play Nellie&quot;; the production was received &quot;in a state of nearly unconditional rapture. It was one of those nights when cynicism didn&#x27;t stand a chance.&quot; Kenrick especially likes Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;This Nearly Was Mine&quot;, and praises the concert generally: &quot;this excellent performance helped restore the reputation of this classic&quot;.

<text>Sir Alexander Korda (; born Sándor László Kellner; ; 16 September 1893 – 23 January 1956) was a Hungarian–born British film director, producer, and screenwriter, who founded his own film production studios and film distribution company.

Born in Hungary, where he began his career, he worked briefly in the Austrian and German film industries during the era of silent films, before being based in Hollywood from 1926 to 1930 for the first of his two brief periods there (the other was during World War II). The change led to a divorce from his first wife, the Hungarian film actress María Corda, who was unable to make the transition from silent films to &quot;talkies&quot; because of her Hungarian accent.

From 1930, Korda was active in the British film industry, and soon became one of its leading figures. He was the founder of London Films and, post-war, the owner of British Lion Films, a film distribution company. Korda produced many outstanding classics of the British film industry, including &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot;, &quot;Rembrandt&quot;, &quot;Things To Come&quot;, &quot;The Thief of Baghdad&quot; and &quot;The Third Man&quot;. In 1942, Korda became the first filmmaker to receive a knighthood.

==Personal background==
Korda was born Sándor László Kellner into a Jewish family in Pusztatúrpásztó, Austria-Hungary. His parents were Henrik Kellner and Ernesztina Weisz. He had two younger brothers, Zoltan and Vincent, who also had careers in the film industry, often working with Alexander.

After the death of his father, Korda began writing film reviews to support his family. He also changed the family name, deriving the new name Korda from the Latin phrase &quot;sursum corda&quot; (&quot;lift up your hearts&quot;).

Having been excused from military service in the Austro-Hungarian Army in the First World War, because he was short-sighted, Korda became an important figure in the Hungarian film industry, initially through his magazines &quot;Pesti Mozi&quot;, &quot;Mozihét&quot; and &quot;Világ&quot;. This led to invitations to write screenplays. His first script was for &quot;Watchhouse in the Carpathians&quot; (1914), which he also helped to direct. He also made a film with Gyula Zilahy, &quot;The Duped Journalist&quot; (1914), and directed &quot;Tutyu and Totyo&quot; (1915), &quot;The Officer&#x27;s Swordknot&quot; (1915) and &quot;Lyon Lea&quot; (1915).

In 1916, Korda established his own production company, Corvin Film. Its first film was &quot;White Nights&quot; (1916), which was a big success. Korda went on to build Corvin into one of the largest film companies in Hungary with such productions as &quot;The Grandmother&quot; (1916), &quot;Tales of the Typewriter&quot; (1916), &quot;The Man with Two Hearts&quot; (1916), &quot;The One Million Pound Note&quot; (1916), &quot;Cyclamen&quot; (1916), &quot;Struggling Hearts&quot; (1916), &quot;The Laughing Saskia&quot; (1916), &quot;Miska the Magnate&quot; (1916), &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s Umbrella&quot; (1917), &quot;The Stork Caliph&quot; (1917) (from the novel by Mihály Babits), and &quot;Magic&quot; (1917). Korda later regarded &quot;Harrison and Barrison&quot; (1917) as his best film. He also made &quot;Faun&quot; (1918), &quot;Man of Gold&quot; (1918), and &quot;Mary Ann&quot; (1918).

Under the shortlived Hungarian Soviet Republic Korda made &quot;Ave Caesar!&quot; (1919), &quot;White Rose&quot; (1919), &quot;Yamata&quot; (1919) and &quot;Neither at Home or Abroad&quot; (1919). His final Hungarian film was &quot;Number 111&quot; (1919).

In October 1919 Korda was arrested during the White Terror that followed the overthrow of the Communist government, but was soon released. He then left Hungary for Austria. He never returned to his country of birth.

===Films in Vienna===

After leaving Hungary, Korda accepted an invitation from Count Alexander Kolowrat to work for his company Sascha-Film in the Austrian capital Vienna. Korda worked alongside Kolowrat, who had attracted several leading Hungarian and German directors into his employment, on the historical epic &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1920). The film was a major international success and inspired Korda with the idea of making &quot;international films&quot; with global box office appeal.

Korda&#x27;s next two films, &quot;Masters of the Sea&quot; (1922) and &quot;A Vanished World&quot; (1922), were both nautical-set adventures based on Hungarian novels.

By that stage, Korda had grown irritated with Kolowrat&#x27;s interference with his work and left Sascha to make an independent film, &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1922), set in the world of opera. The film was made on a lavish scale, with large crowd scenes. The lengthy shooting schedule lasted 160 working days. The film was unsuccessful.

===Films in Berlin===
Korda left Vienna and travelled to Germany. He had frequent problems with money, and often had to receive support from friends and business associates, but in Berlin he raised funding for the melodrama &quot;The Unknown Tomorrow&quot; (1923). With backing from Germany&#x27;s biggest film company, UFA, Korda returned to Vienna to make &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1924). While he was there he began work on his next film, the historical &quot;Tragedy in the House of Habsburg&quot; (1924), which portrayed the Mayerling Incident. It earned back around half of its production costs. He followed this with &quot;Dancing Mad&quot; (1925), another melodrama.

Korda cast his wife Maria Corda [&quot;sic&quot;] as the female lead in all his German-language films. To a large degree the success of his productions depended on her star power. Korda cast her again in &quot;A Modern Dubarry&quot; (1927), an update of the life of Madame Du Barry based on an original screenplay by Lajos Bíró. The film may have been intended to showcase Maria Corda&#x27;s star potential to producers in Hollywood.

Korda made his final German film, &quot;Madame Wants No Children&quot; (1926), for the Berlin-based subsidiary of the American studio Fox. Although made later, it was released before &quot;A Modern Dubarry&quot;.

==In Hollywood and France==
In December 1926 Korda and his wife sailed for the United States on board the steamer &quot;Olympic&quot;, with a view to Korda taking up a contract with the American studio First National. In Hollywood both struggled to adapt to the studio system. Korda had to wait some time before gaining his first directorial assignment, &quot;The Stolen Bride&quot; (1927), a Hungarian-themed romance about a peasant&#x27;s love for a countess. The film starred the American actress Billie Dove rather than Korda&#x27;s wife.

Following the moderate success of &quot;The Stolen Bride&quot; Korda worked on the comedy &quot;The Private Life of Helen of Troy&quot; (1927), replacing the previous director, George Fitzmaurice. The film retells the story of Helen of Troy, parodying the historical epics of the era by transforming the classical characters into everyday people with modern problems. The film was a significant success for Korda, with his wife playing the role of Helen. The film was his most satisfying work in the United States and provided the template for his later success in Britain.

After this film, however, Korda became pigeonholed as a director of female stars and exotic foreign locations. He was generally given similar assignments for the remainder of his first period in Hollywood. His next few films were disappointments as his career lost its momentum: &quot;Yellow Lily&quot; (1928), &quot;Night Watch&quot; (1928) both with Dove, and &quot;Love and the Devil&quot; (1929) with Maria Korda (who now spelled her name with a K). The latter two, though still Silent films, had sound effects and music added to their soundtracks during Hollywood&#x27;s transition to fully synchronized Sound films.

Korda&#x27;s next film &quot;The Squall&quot; (1929), with a young Myrna Loy, was his first talkie and featured a Hungarian setting. Although, like many other directors, Korda had misgivings about the new technology, he quickly adapted to making sound films.

Korda&#x27;s marriage was strained in Hollywood. The arrival of sound films wrecked his wife&#x27;s career, as her heavy accent made her unemployable for most American films. &quot;Love and the Devil&quot; was the last of Korda&#x27;s films she appeared in, and she made only two more films. She became increasingly resentful of the switch in their relationship, as her career was now over while Korda, who had once relied on her for the success of his films, was relatively flourishing. Their marriage collapsed, and they divorced in 1930.

Korda made two more sound films at First National: &quot;Her Private Life&quot; (1929) and &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; (1930), both of which were remakes of earlier silent films.

Korda grew more frustrated in Hollywood as he came to strongly dislike the studio system. He hoped to save up enough money to return to Europe and begin producing on a large scale there, but his lavish personal spending and the large amounts he lost in the Wall Street crash prevented this. When his producer, Ned Marin, moved from First National to the Fox Film Corporation Korda followed him. Korda&#x27;s new contract gave him $100,000 a year.

===Fox===

His first film for Fox, &quot;Women Everywhere&quot; (1930), cost slightly more than some of the programmers he had previously directed in the United States. He collaborated with several figures who would contribute to his future success in Britain. Korda was offered a series of scripts, all of which he disliked, before he finally agreed to make &quot;The Princess and the Plumber&quot; (1930). Korda&#x27;s reluctance to make the film led to his conflict with studio bosses, which brought to an end his first period in Hollywood.

===Films in France===
Korda went to France where he made &quot;The Men Around Lucy&quot; (1931) for Paramount. He also made &quot;Rive gauche&quot; (1931).

Korda had a success with &quot;Marius&quot; (1931) starring Raimu from the play by Marcel Pagnol. He followed it with the Swedish and German versions of Marius, respectively &quot;Longing for the Sea&quot; (1931), and &quot;The Golden Anchor&quot; (1932).

==In Britain==

Korda relocated to London where he made &quot;Service for Ladies&quot; (1932) for Paramount. He produced &quot;Women Who Play&quot; (1932) for them.

===London Films===
Korda then decided to form his own company. In 1932 he founded London Films. Its first production was &quot;Wedding Rehearsal&quot; (1932). He then produced &quot;Men of Tomorrow&quot; (1932), co-directed by his brother Zoltan Korda, &quot;That Night in London&quot; (1932) starring Robert Donat, &quot;Strange Evidence&quot; (1933), &quot;Counsel&#x27;s Opinion&quot; (1933), and &quot;Cash&quot; (1933).

====&quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot;====
Korda had a huge hit with &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (1933), which he directed. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, established Korda internationally and made a star of Charles Laughton.

====After &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot;====
Korda followed it with &quot;The Girl from Maxim&#x27;s&quot; (1933), which he shot in English and French. He tried to repeat the success of &quot;Henry&quot; with &quot;The Private Life of Don Juan&quot; (1934) starring Douglas Fairbanks, which he directed, and &quot;The Rise of Catherine the Great&quot; (1934) which he did not. Neither did as well as &quot;Henry&quot;.

Korda produced a well-respected short, &quot;The Private Life of the Gannets&quot; (1934), and enjoyed a big success as producer of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1934). Also popular was &quot;Sanders of the River&quot; (1935) starring Paul Robeson and directed by his brother, and &quot;The Ghost Goes West&quot; (1936) starring Donat. His other credits as producer include &quot;Moscow Nights&quot; (1936) with Laurence Olivier, &quot;Men Are Not Gods&quot; (1936), and &quot;Forget Me Not&quot; (1936).

Korda directed &quot;Rembrandt&quot; (1936) with Laughton, which was a critical rather than a commercial success. &quot;Things to Come&quot; (1936), directed by William Cameron Menzies, has come to be regarded as a classic. It was written by H. G. Wells and Korda&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Could Work Miracles&quot; (1936) is based on a Wells short story. Korda also commissioned and financed the documentary &quot;Conquest of the Air&quot; (1936).

===Denham===
Korda bought property in Denham, Buckinghamshire, including Hills House, and built film studios on the property. London Film&#x27;s Denham Film Studios was financed by the Prudential and opened in 1936. On 21 June 1936, Thurston Macauley, London correspondent to The New York Times, filed a story headlined &quot;The Korda Workshop at Denham&quot; describing the facility, located on 165 acres of woodland, field and river scenery suitable for filming, with 28 acres of buildings and a planned total of fifteen 250-foot by 130-foot sound stages (state of the art at the time). It was &quot;not only the most up-to-date of all the world&#x27;s studios&quot; but a &quot;complete community in itself&quot; from foundry and blacksmith&#x27;s shops to projection theatres, with &quot;unusually good dressing and bathroom accommodations&quot; and able to easily manage crowds of 500. Macauley pointed to the special construction designed to ensure that even dense fog would not penetrate the buildings and interfere with filming, a serious problem in Britain in the winter months. He concluded: &quot;Hollywood, as well as the rest of the world, will be watching with interest what Korda does at Denham&quot;.

Korda was naturalised as a British subject on 28 October 1936. That same year Korda was an important contributor to the Moyne Commission, formed to protect British film production from competition, mainly from the United States. Korda said: &quot;If American interests obtained control of British production companies, they may make British pictures here, but the pictures made would be just as American as those made in Hollywood. We are now on the verge of forming a British school of film-making in this country.&quot;

Korda produced &quot;Fire Over England&quot; (1937) with Olivier and Vivien Leigh. He also attempted a version of &quot;I, Claudius&quot; with Laughton and Merle Oberon, but it was abandoned with only a few scenes shot.

Korda made &quot;Dark Journey&quot; (1937) with Conrad Veidt and Leigh, and had a big hit with &quot;Elephant Boy&quot; (1937) directed by his brother from a Rudyard Kipling story; it made a star of Sabu.

Korda also made some cheaper films: &quot;Farewell Again&quot; (1938), &quot;Storm in a Teacup&quot; (1938) with Leigh and Rex Harrison, &quot;The Squeaker&quot; (1937), &quot;Action for Slander&quot; (1937), &quot;Return of the Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1937) and &quot;Paradise for Two&quot; (1937).

&quot;Knight Without Armour&quot; (1937) with Donat and Marlene Dietrich was an expensive epic that failed to recoup its money. &quot;The Divorce of Lady X&quot; (1938) was a comedy with Olivier and Merle Oberon.

Korda had a big success with &quot;The Drum&quot; (1938), directed by Zoltan and starring Sabu. He produced &quot;South Riding&quot; (1938), &quot;The Challenge&quot; (1938), &quot;The Rebel Son&quot; (1939) and &quot;Prison Without Bars&quot; (1938).

During the Second World War Korda made more propaganda films, including &quot;Q Planes&quot; (1939), with Olivier, and &quot;The Lion Has Wings&quot; (1939). Korda had a massive hit with another adventure film directed by Zoltan, &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (1939).

By 1939 Michael Powell had been hired as a contract director by Korda on the strength of &quot;The Edge of the World&quot; (1937). Korda set him to work on some projects such as &quot;Burmese Silver&quot; that were subsequently cancelled. Nonetheless, Powell was brought in to save a film that was being made as a vehicle for two of Korda&#x27;s star players, Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson. The film was &quot;The Spy in Black&quot; (1939), where Powell first met Emeric Pressburger. Korda also produced the comedy &quot;Over the Moon&quot; (1939) and the drama &quot;21 Days&quot; (1939).

Korda soon ran into financial difficulties, and management of the Denham complex was merged with Pinewood in 1939, becoming part of the Rank Organisation.

==Sojourn in Hollywood==
The outbreak of the Second World War in Europe meant that &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; had to be completed in Hollywood, where Korda was based again for a few years. While he was in the United States he produced and directed &quot;That Hamilton Woman&quot; (UK title: Lady Hamilton) (1941) with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, and produced &quot;Lydia&quot; (1941) with Oberon. He also supervised &quot;Jungle Book&quot; (1942), a live-action version of Kipling&#x27;s stories, directed by Zoltán Korda. He also had minor involvement in &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (1942).

==Return to Britain==
Korda was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for his contribution to the war effort, in the 1942 Birthday Honours. On 22 September 1942 he was knighted at an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace by George VI. He was the first film director to receive the honour.

He returned to Britain in 1943 as production chief of MGM-London films, with a £35 million ten-year programme. The scheme ended after one year, one film and a £1 million loss to MGM. The only film to come out of the deal was &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; (1945), directed by Korda, and starring Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr.

===British Lion Films===
Via London Films Korda bought a controlling interest in British Lion Films. He produced &quot;A Man About the House&quot; (1947).

In 1948 London Films received an advance payment of £375,000, the largest single payment received by a British film company, for three films, &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1947) (which Korda directed), &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1948) and &quot;Mine Own Executioner&quot; (1948). The company released three other films, &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; (1948), &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot; (1948). &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; and &quot;Fallen Idol&quot; were hits. &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; had some acclaim, but lost money at the box office. &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; was a fiasco. Korda was also badly hurt by the trade war between the British and American film industries in the late 1940s. Korda did recover, in part due to a £3 million loan British Lion received from the National Film Finance Corporation.

In 1948 Korda signed a co-production deal with David O. Selznick. This resulted in &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949) which was a success both critically and financially.

London Films made several films with smaller budgets: &quot;The Cure for Love&quot; (1949), &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot; (1950), &quot;The Angel with the Trumpet&quot; (1950), &quot;My Daughter Joy&quot; (1950),&quot; State Secret&quot; (1950), &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot; (1950), &quot;Seven Days to Noon&quot; (1951), &quot;Lady Godiva Rides Again&quot; (1951), &quot;The Wonder Kid&quot; (1951), and &quot;Mr. Denning Drives North&quot; (1951). Korda also helped to finance &quot;Outcast of the Islands&quot; (1952), &quot;Home at Seven&quot; (1952), &quot;Who Goes There!&quot; (1952), &quot;The Holly and the Ivy&quot; (1952), &quot;The Ringer&quot; (1952), &quot;Folly to Be Wise&quot; (1953), &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot; (1953), &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Paradise&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan&quot; (1953). &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; (1951), directed by Zoltan, was acclaimed. &quot;The Sound Barrier&quot; (1952) from David Lean was a hit. &quot;The Man Between&quot; (1953) was an attempt to repeat the success of &quot;The Third Man&quot;.

Korda then helped to make &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (1954), &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1954), &quot;The Belles of St. Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Teckman Mystery&quot; (1954).

A draft screenplay of what became &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; was written by Emeric Pressburger in the 1930s for Korda and intended as a vehicle for Merle Oberon, whom Korda later married. The screenplay was bought by Michael Powell and Pressburger, who made it for J. Arthur Rank. During the 1950s Korda reportedly expressed interest in producing a James Bond film based upon Ian Fleming&#x27;s novel &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, but no agreement was ever reached.

===Final Films===
In 1954 Korda received £5 million from the City Investing Corporation of New York, enabling him to continue producing films until his death.
His final films included &quot;The Man Who Loved Redheads&quot; (1955), &quot;Three Cases of Murder&quot; (1955), &quot;A Kid for Two Farthings&quot; (1955), &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; (1955), &quot;Summertime&quot; (1955), and &quot;Storm Over the Nile&quot; (1955) a remake of &quot;The Four Feathers&quot;. His last films were Laurence Olivier&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Richard III&quot; (1955) and &quot;Smiley&quot; (1956).

==Personal life==
Korda was married three times, first to the Hungarian actress María Corda in 1919. They had one son, Peter Vincent Korda, and divorced in 1930. In 1939 he married the film star Merle Oberon. They divorced six years later. He married, lastly, on 8 June 1953, Alexandra Boycun (1928–1966).

===Death===
Korda died of a heart attack at the age of 62 at his home in London in 1956. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in London, his ashes finally being interred in February 1959 at Stoke Poges Memorial Gardens in Buckinghamshire.

==Legacy==
Michael Korda, son of Vincent and thus nephew of Alexander, wrote a &quot;roman à clef&quot; about Merle Oberon, published after her death. It was entitled &quot;Queenie.&quot; He also wrote a memoir, &quot;Charmed Lives&quot; (1979), about his father, his two uncles and the rest of their large extended family.

The Alexander Korda Award for &quot;Outstanding British Film of the Year&quot; is given by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

<text>Dame Jane Elizabeth Ailwên Phillips (born 14 May 1933), known professionally as Siân Phillips ( ), is a British actress from Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen, Wales. Her early career consisted primarily of stage roles, including the title roles in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; and George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan.&quot; In the 1960s, she started taking on more roles in television and film. She is particularly known for her performance as Livia in the 1976 BBC television series &quot;I, Claudius,&quot; for which she was awarded a BAFTA and a Royal Television Society award. She was nominated for a Tony Award and Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance as Marlene Dietrich in &quot;Marlene&quot;.

==Early life==
Phillips was born on 14 May 1933 in Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen, the daughter of Sally (&quot;née&quot; Thomas), a teacher, and David Phillips, a steelworker who became a policeman. She is a Welsh-speaker: in the first volume of her autobiography &quot;Private Faces&quot; (1999) she notes that she spoke only Welsh for much of her childhood, learning English by listening to the radio.

Phillips attended Pontardawe Grammar School and originally was known there as Jane, but her Welsh teacher called her Siân, the Welsh form of Jane. Later she read English and Philosophy at University College Cardiff.

Phillips graduated from the University of Wales in 1955. She entered RADA with a scholarship in September 1955, the same year as Diana Rigg and Glenda Jackson. She won the Bancroft Gold Medal for &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; and was offered work in Hollywood when she left RADA. While still a student, she was offered three film contracts to work for an extended period of time in the United States, but she declined, preferring to work on stage.

==Career==
===Early career===
Phillips began acting professionally at the age of 11 with the Home Service of BBC Radio in Wales. At the same age she won her first speech-and-drama award for her performance at the National Eisteddfod held at Llandybïe in 1944, where she and a school friend played the parts of two elderly men in a dramatic duologue.

She made her first British television appearance at 17 and won a Welsh acting award at 18. In 1953, while still a student at University College, Cardiff she worked as a newsreader and announcer for the BBC in Wales and toured Wales in Welsh-language productions of the Welsh Arts Council.

From 1953 to 1955, Phillips was a member of the BBC Repertory Company and the National Theatre Company and toured Wales performing Welsh and English plays for the Welsh Arts Council. For the Nottingham Playhouse in 1958, she was Masha in &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. She performed as Princess Siwan in Saunders Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The King&#x27;s Daughter&quot; at the Hampstead Theatre Club in 1959 and as Katherine in &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; for the Oxford Playhouse in 1960. She was Princess Siwan again in the BBC&#x27;s production of &quot;Siwan: The King&#x27;s Daughter&quot; alongside Peter O&#x27;Toole with Emyr Humphrys as producer. It was broadcast on BBC One (Wales only) on 1 March 1960. From October 1958 to April 1959, she was compere of the &quot;Land of Song&quot; (&quot;Gwlad y Gân&quot;) monthly programme at TWW (Television Wales and the West) Channel 10 with baritone Ivor Emmanuel.

She made her first appearance on the London stage in 1957 when she appeared in Hermann Sudermann&#x27;s &quot;Magda&quot; for RADA. &quot;Magda&quot;, about an opera diva, was her first real success in London. The play did well and benefited her career greatly; although she was only a student at the time, she was the first since Sarah Bernhardt to play the role.

In 1957, Phillips performed the title role in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;. West End opening at The Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre, December 3, 1957, with Fredrik Ohlsson as &quot;Tesman.&quot; They also performed at Det Nye Teatret in Oslo and at The Vanbrugh, RADA .
Many sources consider this her London stage debut but she actually did &quot;Magda&quot; before &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;. In September 1958, she was performing as Margaret Muir in John Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Holiday&quot; at Oxford New Theatre.

In May 1958, Phillips performed as Joan in a production of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot; by Bryan Bailey, at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, which had opened just six weeks before. An observer described her performance: &quot;Sian Phillips&#x27; portrayal of Joan defies the law of averages, since, after seeing Siobhan McKenna in the 1955 Arts Theatre production, I reckoned it impossible to equal within half a century. Like the Irish girl, the Welsh girl is perfect... &#x27;This girl doesn&#x27;t act Joan – she is Joan.&#x27; In short, perfection.&quot;

She was Julia in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s 1960–1961 version of &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;. Her Royal Shakespeare Company performances are:
*Julia in &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;: at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre (Stratford, 30 November 1960, opening night).
*Julia in &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;: at the Aldwych Theatre (London, 15 December 1960, opening night)
*Bertha in &quot;Ondine&quot;: at the Aldwych Theatre (London, 12 January 1961, opening night)
*Miss Havisham in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;: at Royal Shakespeare Company (Stratford, 6 December 2005).

===Later film and television===

Her long career has included many films and television programmes, but she is perhaps best known for starring as Livia in the popular BBC adaptation of Robert Graves&#x27;s novel &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (BBC2, 1976), for which she won the 1977 BAFTA Television Award for Best Actress, and for many appearances on the original run of &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;. She also appeared opposite her then-husband Peter O&#x27;Toole and Richard Burton in &quot;Becket&quot; (1964); as Ursula Mossbank in the musical film &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1969), again starring O&#x27;Toole; once more opposite O&#x27;Toole in &quot;Murphy&#x27;s War&quot; (1971); as Emmeline Pankhurst in the TV mini-series &quot;Shoulder to Shoulder&quot; (1974); as Clementine Churchill in Southern Television&#x27;s &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years&quot; (1981) starring Robert Hardy; as Lady Ann, the unfaithful wife of Alec Guinness&#x27;s character George Smiley, in the BBC1 espionage dramas &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot; (1979) and &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; (1982), adapted from John le Carré&#x27;s eponymous novels; in &quot;Nijinsky&quot; (1980); and as the queen Cassiopeia in &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (1981).

Another popular role was that of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) and Charal from &quot;&quot; (1985). She also appeared in seasons 2 and 4 (1998 and 2000) of the Canadian TV series &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; as Adrian, the renegade founder of the powerful Section One anti-terrorist organisation. In 2001, she appeared as herself in &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;. and in &quot;Ballykissangel&quot; as faith healer Consuela Dunphy in Episode 7 (&#x27;One Born Every Minute&#x27; or &#x27;Getting Better All the Time&#x27;). Her most recent film is &quot;The Gigolos&quot; (2006) by Richard Bracewell, in which she played Lady James. In 2010, she appeared in &quot;New Tricks&quot; in the episode &quot;Coming out Ball&quot; and in 2011 she appeared in the episode &quot;Wild Justice&quot; in the fifth season of the television series &quot;Lewis&quot;. In 2017, she played Lady Yvette Bristow in the TV series &quot;Strike&quot;. In 2022, she appeared in the series &quot;McDonald &amp; Dodds&quot;. In 2024, Phillips portrayed Enid Meadows in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;73 Yards&quot;.

===Other work===
Phillips&#x27;s West End credits include &quot;Marlene&quot; (in which she portrayed Marlene Dietrich), &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, &quot;Gigi&quot; and &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;. She has also appeared on the American stage in &quot;Marlene&quot;.

Her National Theatre performances have included playing the roles of Lady Britomart in &quot;Major Barbara&quot; at the Lyttelton Theatre (18 October 1982, opening night); Madam Armfeldt in &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; at the Olivier Theatre (18 September 1995, opening night); Hope in &quot;In Bed With Magritte&quot; (1 December 1995, opening night); and Madame Neilsen in &quot;Les Blancs&quot; at the Olivier Theatre in 2016.

She provided spoken-word backing to a track on Rufus Wainwright&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Release the Stars&quot; and appeared live with him at the Old Vic Theatre in London on 31 May/1 June 2007. In 2009 Phillips starred in London&#x27;s West End production of &quot;Calendar Girls&quot;. Phillips played Juliet opposite Michael Byrne&#x27;s Romeo in &quot;Juliet and her Romeo&quot; at the Bristol Old Vic from 10 March to 24 April 2010.

In January 2011, she appeared in a new cabaret show, &quot;Crossing Borders&quot;, at Wilton&#x27;s Music Hall in London. One review said: &quot;Her cabaret shows are always of the more traditional type. She&#x27;s had a long and very impressive career, and her show followed its progression, with backstage anecdotes about the people she&#x27;s met and worked with along the way. It may not be edgy, but it&#x27;s a truly delightful evening, by a truly delightful performer, in a truly delightful venue.&quot;

In 2015, she played the lead character Fania Fénelon in the Arthur Miller stage version of &quot;Playing for Time&quot; at Sheffield Theatres.

In 2024, Phillips reflected on her life and career, for the first time, in &quot;Siân Phillips at 90&quot;, broadcast on BBC One on 1 March. The documentary includes Philips recounting, with candour, the difficulties in the later part of her marriage to O&#x27;Toole, which culminated in the ultimatum that she should leave the family home, without their two children, within the space of four hours.

==Awards and nominations==
In January 2018, Phillips was recognised for her career spanning more than 70 years at the BBC Audio Drama Awards, and was given a Radio Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Honours==
Phillips was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2000 Birthday Honours and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to drama.

Since 2005, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Cymru (BAFTA in Wales) has presented the Tlws Sian Phillips Award to a Welshman or woman who has made a significant contribution in either a major feature film or network television programme.

In 2024, she and Judi Dench became the first female members of the Garrick Club.

==Personal life==
Phillips&#x27;s first husband was Donald Roy, a post-graduate student at the University of Wales, who later established the Drama Department at the University of Hull and after whom the University Theatre is named. They were married in 1956 and divorced in 1959.

Already pregnant with their first child, Phillips married Peter O&#x27;Toole in December 1959. They had two daughters, including Kate O&#x27;Toole. The couple divorced in 1979, and Phillips wrote about this tempestuous period of her life in &quot;Public Places&quot;, the second volume of her autobiography.

Her third husband was actor Robin Sachs, who was 17 years her junior. Their relationship began in 1975. They were married on Christmas Eve 1979, shortly after her divorce from O&#x27;Toole. Phillips and Sachs divorced in 1991.

Her great aunt was the Welsh evangelist Rosina Davies.

She is a patron of the Bird College of Dance, Music &amp; Theatre Performance, based in Sidcup, Greater London.

Her two volumes of autobiography – &quot;Private Faces&quot; and &quot;Public Places&quot; – were published in 1999 and 2001, respectively.

<text>Terrytoons, Inc. was an American animation studio headquartered in New Rochelle, New York, which was active from 1929 until its closure in December 1972 (and briefly returned between 1987 and 1996 for television in-name only). Founded by Paul Terry, Frank Moser, and Joseph Coffman, it operated out of the &quot;K&quot; Building in downtown New Rochelle. The studio created many cartoon characters including Fanny Zilch, Mighty Mouse, Heckle and Jeckle, Gandy Goose, Sourpuss, Dinky Duck, Little Roquefort, the Terry Bears, Dimwit, and Luno; Terry&#x27;s pre-existing character Farmer Al Falfa was also featured often in the series.

The &quot;New Terrytoons&quot; period of the late 1950s through the mid-1960s produced such characters as Clint Clobber, Tom Terrific, Deputy Dawg, Hector Heathcote, Hashimoto-san, Sidney the Elephant, Possible Possum, James Hound, Astronut, Sad Cat, The Mighty Heroes, and Sally Sargent. Also during that time, Ralph Bakshi got his start as an animator, and eventually as a director, at Terrytoons.

Terrytoons shorts were originally released to theaters by 20th Century Fox from 1935 until 1973. After Terry had retired, Terrytoons was sold to CBS, which would later purchase the entire library. Paramount Pictures would eventually take theatrical rights ownership of the Terrytoons library in 1994 (which was then already purchased by Viacom), and would purchase CBS in 2000. As of 2019, Paramount Pictures has owned the rights to the studio and its library after the re-merger of Viacom and CBS.

== History ==
=== Pre-Terrytoons era ===

Terry first worked for Bray Studios in 1916, where he created the Farmer Al Falfa series. He would then make a Farmer Al Falfa short for Edison Pictures, called &quot;Farmer Al Falfa&#x27;s Wayward Pup&quot; (1917), and some later cartoons were made for Paramount Pictures.

Around 1921, Terry founded the Fables animation studio, named for its &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Film Fables&quot; series, in conjunction with the studio of Amedee J. Van Beuren. Fables churned out a Fable cartoon every week for eight years in the 1920s.

In 1928, Van Beuren, anxious to compete with the new phenomenon of talking pictures, released Terry&#x27;s &quot;Dinner Time&quot; (released October 1928). Van Beuren then urged Terry to start producing actual sound films, instead of post-synchronizing the cartoons. Terry refused, and Van Beuren fired him in 1929. Almost immediately, Terry and much of his staff started up the Terrytoons studio near his former studio. One staff member during that time was Art Babbitt, who went on to become a well-known Disney animator.

=== Peak era ===

Through much of its history, the studio was considered one of the lowest-quality houses in the field, to the point where Paul Terry noted, &quot;Let Walt Disney be the Tiffany&#x27;s of the business. I want to be the Woolworth&#x27;s!&quot; Terry&#x27;s studio had the lowest budgets and was among the slowest to adapt to new technologies such as sound (in about 1930) and Technicolor (in 1938). While its graphic style remained remarkably static for decades, it actually followed the sound cartoon trend of the late 1920s and early 1930s very quickly. Background music was entrusted to one man, Philip Scheib, and Terry&#x27;s refusal to pay royalties for popular songs forced Scheib to compose his own scores.

Paul Terry took pride in producing a new cartoon every other week, regardless of the quality of the films. Until 1957, screen credits were very sparse, listing only the writer (until 1950, solely John Foster; then Tom Morrison thereafter), director (Terry&#x27;s three main directors were Connie Rasinski, Eddie Donnelly, and Mannie Davis), and musician (musical director Philip A. Scheib).

Terrytoons&#x27; first distributor was Educational Pictures, specialists in short-subject comedies and novelties. Audio-Cinema in the early 1930s backed the production of Terrytoons, and distributed the Educational library internationally, except in the United Kingdom and Ireland where the library was distributed by Educational and Gaumont-British in partnership with the Ideal Film Company.

The Fox Film company then released Educational shorts to theaters in the 1930s, giving the Terry cartoons wide exposure. Following the merger between Fox Film and 20th Century, the newly formed 20th Century Fox withdrew its support from Educational Pictures, and the company both backed and distributed Terrytoons. Farmer Al Falfa was Terry&#x27;s most familiar character in the 1930s; Kiko the Kangaroo was spun off the Farmer Al Falfa series. Most of the other cartoons featured stock generic animal characters and designs, one of which was a scruffy dog with a black patch around one eye; Terry ultimately built a series around this character, now known as Puddy the Pup.

Paul Terry may have realized that Educational was in financial trouble because he found another lucrative outlet for his product. In 1938, he arranged to release his older cartoons through home-movie distributor Castle Films. Educational went out of business within the year, but 20th Century Fox continued to release Terrytoons to theaters for the next two decades. With a new emphasis on &quot;star&quot; characters, Terrytoons featured the adventures of Super Mouse (later renamed Mighty Mouse), the talking magpies Heckle and Jeckle, silly Gandy Goose, Dinky Duck, mischievous mouse Little Roquefort, and The Terry Bears.

Despite the artistic drawbacks imposed by Terry&#x27;s inflexible business policies, Terrytoons was nominated four times for the Academy Award for Animated Short Film: &quot;All Out for V&quot; in 1942, &quot;My Boy, Johnny&quot; in 1944, &quot;Mighty Mouse in Gypsy Life&quot; in 1945, and &quot;Sidney&#x27;s Family Tree&quot; in 1958.

=== Changing hands ===
The studio was sold outright by the retiring Paul Terry to CBS in 1955, but 20th Century Fox (TCF) continued distribution. The deal closed the following year in 1956, and it became a division of the CBS Films subsidiary. Later, in 1957 CBS put it under the management of UPA alumni Gene Deitch, who had to work with even lower budgets.

Deitch&#x27;s most notable works at the studio were the &quot;Tom Terrific&quot; cartoon segments for the &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; television show. He also introduced a number of new characters, such as Sidney the Elephant, Gaston Le Crayon, John Doormat, and Clint Clobber.

Before Deitch was fired in 1959, Bill Weiss took complete control of the studio. Under his supervision, &quot;Heckle and Jeckle&quot; and &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; went back into production. Besides the three core directors of the Terry era who were still involved as animators and directors, two Famous Studios stalwarts joined the crew, Dave Tendlar and Martin Taras. Other new theatrical cartoon series included &quot;Hector Heathcote&quot;, &quot;Luno&quot; and &quot;Hashimoto San&quot;. The studio also began producing the &quot;Deputy Dawg&quot; series for television in 1959. Another television production for the &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; show was &quot;The Adventures of Lariat Sam&quot;, which was written in part by Gene Wood, who would later become the announcer for several TV gameshows including &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

Phil Scheib continued as the studio&#x27;s musical director through the mid-1960s when he was replaced by Jim Timmens and Elliott Lawrence.

The best-known talent at Terrytoons in the 1960s was animator/director/producer Ralph Bakshi, who started with Terrytoons in the 1950s as an opaquer, and eventually helmed the &quot;Mighty Heroes&quot; series. Bakshi left Terrytoons in 1967 for Paramount&#x27;s own cartoon studio, which closed its cartoon unit later that year. He would later go on to produce &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; for television in 1987, which was also produced by future &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; creator John Kricfalusi.

=== Closure ===
After the departure of Ralph Bakshi, the studio petered out, and finally closed in 1973. As a result of the FCC banning TV networks from owning cable television and syndication of television programs, CBS created Viacom Enterprises to handle all network programs beyond TV production and network broadcasting.

On July 4, 1971, Viacom Enterprises spun off from CBS; neither Viacom Enterprises nor CBS had any interest in Terrytoons. The Terrytoons film library was still regularly re-released to theaters by Fox. The studio&#x27;s one of the last short was an unsold TV pilot called &quot;Sally Sargent&quot;, about a 16-year-old girl who is a secret agent. Soon after &quot;Sally Sargent&quot; was completed, Viacom International ended their relationship with Fox and re-releases ceased. Terrytoons’ existence soon came to an end.

Art Bartsch, who kept the studio running after Bakshi left, would soon die along with Connie Rasinski, and Bob Kuwahara, reducing the studio to a ghost studio with executive producer Bill Weiss and story supervisor Tom Morrison; Viacom kept the studio open until 1972. By October 1972, Viacom International announced that Terrytoons would leave New Rochelle and relocate to Viacom International&#x27;s office in New York City. By December 29, Viacom sold the now abandoned New Rochelle studio, and the company&#x27;s fate was forever sealed.

=== Post-history ===
Weiss continued Terrytoons production from his New York City office with the 1970s Terrytoons cartoons (especially &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; and &quot;Deputy Dawg&quot;) being syndicated to many local TV markets, and they were a staple of after-school and Saturday-morning cartoon shows for over three decades, from the 1950s through the 1980s, until the television rights to the library were acquired by USA Network in 1989. However, any new cartoons of the studio&#x27;s stars came from other studios.

In the late 1970s, Filmation Associates licensed the rights to make the new &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; and &quot;Heckle &amp; Jeckle&quot; series from Viacom International. The series was &quot;The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle &amp; Jeckle&quot; and aired from 1979 to 1980 on CBS.

Bakshi would later produce &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; in 1987, which lasted for two seasons. Bakshi and his friend John Kricfalusi inspired the staff to try to get as much Jim Tyer-style drawing in the show as possible. Tyer, a stand-out Terry animator of the original cartoons with a unique style, became a strong influence on the artists of the Bakshi series, such as now recognizable writers, artists and animators—Bruce Timm, Doug Moench, Andrew Stanton, Rich Moore, Lynne Naylor, Jim Reardon, Tom Minton, and Bob Jaques.

Many of the characters (such as Mighty Mouse, Heckle and Jeckle, Dinky Duck, Deputy Dawg, and others) were slated to make cameos in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, but only Oscar the Timid Pig, Looey Lion, and a character resembling Gandy Goose appeared. They can all be seen during the film&#x27;s finale. They were also planned to appear in the deleted scene of Marvin Acme&#x27;s funeral.

In 1994, Fox would sell its Terrytoons theatrical distribution to Paramount, which was then purchased by Viacom that same year, and would go on to purchase CBS six years later in 2000.

However, through the years that have followed since the last Terrytoons TV series material in 1988, the rights have been scattered as a result of prior rights issues and the corporate changes involving Viacom and CBS, especially in 2005. Since CBS Corporation re-merged with Viacom to form ViacomCBS (Paramount Global as of February 2022), reuniting CBS with Paramount, on December 4, 2019, and CBS Films was folded into CBS Entertainment Group after releasing &quot;Jexi&quot; on the same day, Paramount Pictures now owns the theatrical distribution on behalf of Paramount Animation and CBS Entertainment Group, while CBS Media Ventures (formed in 2006) owns the television distribution on behalf of CBS Eye Animation Productions to the Terrytoons film library. However, some Terrytoons shorts are believed to be in the public domain and have either been issued on low-budget VHS tapes and DVDs or have been uploaded on sites such as Internet Archive. On January 5, 2010, the first official release of any Terrytoons material by CBS DVD was issued in the form of the complete series of &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot;.

In 1999, Nickelodeon attempted to revive the Terrytoons characters as part of a TV series called &quot;Curbside&quot;. &quot;Curbside&quot; would have been a parody of late-night talk shows with Heckle and Jeckle serving as hosts of the show, along with their assistant Dinky Duck, and would have featured new cartoons featuring Terrytoon characters like Deputy Dawg, Sidney the Elephant, and Mighty Mouse. &quot;Curbside&quot; features talented voices of Toby Huss and Bobcat Goldthwait as Heckle &amp; Jeckle, Dee Bradley Baker as Dinky Duck, Mighty Mouse and Sidney the Elephant, Billy West as Deputy Dawg, Haley Joel Osment as Tom Terrific, and additional voices of Baker, West, Charlie Adler, and Rob Paulsen. However, it was never picked up, making it the only Terrytoons show that was never officially released.

Between 2001 and 2002, the Terrytoons characters returned to television in original commercials for Brazilian blue cheese (for what is now America&#x27;s Dairy Farmers) and fine wine. One such infamous commercial was the Mighty Mouse ad (entitled &quot;Dining With Cheese&quot;) dining calmly on cheese in a restaurant, utterly unconcerned with a scene of chaos and terror visibly unfolding in the street outside. That said commercial was then pulled from airing following the September 11th attacks.

In 2004, a supposed live-action/animated hybrid Mighty Mouse film adaptation was announced for Nickelodeon Movies and Paramount Pictures with Steve Oedekerk of Omation Animation Studio to produce and direct, but was cancelled and has been in development hell since then. However, development later revived in April 2019 for Paramount Animation with Jon and Erich Hoeber to write the screenplay and both Karen Rosenfelt and Robert W. Cort to produce. It was later announced that in November 2024, Paramount Animation was associated with Maximum Effort, with its founder Ryan Reynolds as a producer and Matt Lieberman as a writer.

== Comic books ==

Among the many licensed Terrytoons products are comic books, mainly published throughout the 1940s and 1950s. The company&#x27;s characters — including Mighty Mouse, Heckle and Jeckle, Dinky Duck, Gandy Goose, and Little Roquefort — were initially licensed to Timely, a predecessor of Marvel Comics, in 1942. St. John Publications took over the license from 1947 to 1956, Pines Comics published Terrytoons comics from 1956 to 1959, Dell Comics made an attempt from 1959 to 1962 (and again later from 1966 to 1967), and finally Western Publishing published Mighty Mouse comics from 1962 all the way up to 1980.

The lead title, &quot;Terry-Toons Comics&quot;, was published by Timely from Oct. 1942–Aug. 1947. With issue #60 (Sept. 1947), publication of the title was taken over by St. John Publications, which published another 27 issues until issue #86 (May 1951). The series continued in 1951 (with duplicate issues #85–86) as &quot;Paul Terry&#x27;s Comics&quot;, publishing another 41 issues until May 1955, when it was canceled with issue #125.

Timely launched the Mighty Mouse series in 1946. The first St. John Terrytoons comic was &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; #5 (Aug. 1947), its numbering also taken over from the Timely run. That series eventually ran 71 issues with St. John, moving to Pines for 16 issues from Apr. 1956 to Aug. 1959, to Dell for 12 issues from Oct./Dec. 1959–July/Sept. 1962, and Western for 17 issues from Oct. 1962 to Jan. 1980 (with a hiatus from Sept. 1965 to Mar. 1979), finally ending with issue #172.

St. John&#x27;s Terrytoons comics include the field&#x27;s first 3-D comic book, &quot;Three Dimension Comics&quot; #1 (Sept. 1953 oversize format, Oct. 1953 standard-size reprint), featuring Mighty Mouse. According to Joe Kubert, co-creator with the brothers Norman Maurer and Leonard Maurer, it sold an exceptional 1.2 million copies at 25 cents apiece at a time when comics cost a dime.

Dell Comics published eight issues of a &quot;New Terrytoons&quot; title from June/Aug. 1960 to March/May 1962.

<text>Sir Peter Alexander Ustinov ( ; born Peter Alexander Freiherr von Ustinov; 16 April 192128 March 2004) was a British actor, director and writer. An internationally known raconteur, he was a fixture on television talk shows and lecture circuits for much of his career. Ustinov received numerous accolades including two Academy Awards, three BAFTA Awards, three Emmy Awards, an Olivier Award and a Grammy Award.

Ustinov received two Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor for his roles in &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), and &quot;Topkapi&quot; (1964). He also starred in notable films such as &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951), &quot;The Sundowners&quot; (1960), &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (1962), and &quot;Hot Millions&quot; (1968). He voiced Prince John and King Richard in the Walt Disney Animated film &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1973), and portrayed Agatha Christie&#x27;s fictional detective Hercule Poirot six times for both film and television.

He also displayed a unique cultural versatility which frequently earned him the accolade of a Renaissance man. Miklós Rózsa, composer of the music for &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; and of numerous concert works, dedicated his String Quartet No. 1, Op. 22 (1950) to Ustinov.

An intellectual and diplomat, he held various academic posts, and served as a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF and president of the World Federalist Movement (WFM). In 2003, Durham University changed the name of its Graduate Society to Ustinov College, in honour of the significant contributions Ustinov had made as chancellor of the university from 1992 until his death.

==Early life and education==
Peter Alexander Freiherr von Ustinov was born on 16 April 1921 at 45 Belsize Park, London. His father, Jona Freiherr von Ustinov, was of Russian, German, Polish, Ethiopian, and Jewish descent. Ustinov&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Baron Plato von Ustinov, a Russian noble, and his grandmother was Magdalena Hall, of mixed German-Ethiopian-Jewish origin. Ustinov&#x27;s great-grandfather Moritz Hall, a Jewish refugee from Kraków and later a Christian convert and colleague of Swiss and German missionaries in Ethiopia, married into a German-Ethiopian family.
Ustinov&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandparents (through Magdalena&#x27;s mother) were the German painter Eduard Zander and the Ethiopian aristocrat Court-Lady Isette-Werq of Gondar.

Ustinov&#x27;s mother, Nadezhda Leontievna Benois, known as Nadia, was a painter and ballet designer of French, German, Italian, and Russian descent. Her father, Leon Benois, was an Imperial Russian architect and owner of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s painting &quot;Benois Madonna&quot;. Leon&#x27;s brother Alexandre Benois was a stage designer who worked with Stravinsky and Diaghilev. Their paternal ancestor Jules-César Benois was a chef who had left France for St. Petersburg during the French Revolution and became a chef to Emperor Paul I of Russia.

Jona (or Iona) worked as a press officer at the German embassy in London in the 1930s and was a reporter for a German news agency. In 1935, two years after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Jona von Ustinov began working for the British intelligence service MI5 and became a British subject, thus avoiding internment during the war. The statutory notice of his application for citizenship was published in a Welsh newspaper so as not to alert the Germans. He was the controller of Wolfgang Gans zu Putlitz, an MI5 spy in the German embassy in London, who furnished information on Hitler&#x27;s intentions before the Second World War. (Peter Wright mentions in his book &quot;Spycatcher&quot; that Jona was possibly the spy known as U35; Ustinov says in his autobiography that his father hosted secret meetings of senior British and German officials at their London home.)

Ustinov was educated at Westminster School and had a difficult childhood because of his parents&#x27; constant fighting. While at school, Ustinov considered anglicising his name to Peter Austin, but was counselled against it by a fellow pupil who said that he should &quot;Drop the &#x27;von&#x27; but keep the &#x27;Ustinov. In his late teens he trained as an actor at the London Theatre Studio. While there, on 18 July 1938 he made his first appearance on the stage at the Barn Theatre, Shere, playing Waffles in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Wood Demon&quot;, and his London stage début later that year at the Players&#x27; Theatre, becoming quickly established. He later wrote, &quot;I was not irresistibly drawn to the drama. It was an escape road from the dismal rat race of school&quot;.

==Career==
Ustinov appeared in &quot;White Cargo&quot; at the Aylesbury Rep in 1939, where he performed in a different accent every night. He served as a private in the British Army during the Second World War, including time spent as batman to David Niven while writing the Niven film &quot;The Way Ahead&quot;. The difference in their ranksNiven was a lieutenant-colonel and Ustinov a privatemade their regular association militarily impossible; to solve the problem, Ustinov was appointed as Niven&#x27;s batman. He also appeared in propaganda films, debuting in &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; (1942), in which he was required to deliver lines in English, Latin and Dutch. In 1944, under the auspices of Entertainments National Service Association, he presented and performed the role of Sir Anthony Absolute, in Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Rivals&quot;, with Dame Edith Evans, at the theatre in Larkhill Camp, Wiltshire, England.

After the war, he began writing; his first major success was with the play &quot;The Love of Four Colonels&quot; (1951). He starred with Humphrey Bogart and Aldo Ray in &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot; (1955). His career as a dramatist continued, his best-known play being &quot;Romanoff and Juliet&quot; (1956). His film roles include Roman emperor Nero in &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951), Lentulus Batiatus in &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), Captain Blackbeard in the Disney film &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1968), and an old man surviving a totalitarian future in &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; (1976). Ustinov voiced the anthropomorphic lions Prince John and King Richard in the 1973 Disney animated film &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. He also worked on several films as writer and occasionally director, including &quot;The Way Ahead&quot; (1944), &quot;School for Secrets&quot; (1946), &quot;Hot Millions&quot; (1968), and &quot;Memed, My Hawk&quot; (1984).
In half a dozen films, he played Agatha Christie&#x27;s detective Hercule Poirot, first in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978) and then in 1982&#x27;s &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot;, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Thirteen at Dinner&quot; (TV movie), 1986&#x27;s &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot; (TV movie), 1986&#x27;s &quot;Murder in Three Acts&quot; (TV movie), and 1988&#x27;s &quot;Appointment with Death&quot;.

Ustinov won Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor for his roles in &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960) and &quot;Topkapi&quot; (1964). He also won a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor for the film &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (he set the Oscar and Globe statuettes up on his desk as if playing doubles tennis; the game was a love of his life, as was ocean yachting). Ustinov was also the winner of three Emmys and one Grammy and was nominated for two Tony Awards.

During the 1960s, with the encouragement of Sir Georg Solti, Ustinov directed several operas, including Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot;, Ravel&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot;, Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Erwartung&quot;, and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. Further demonstrating his great talent and versatility in the theatre, Ustinov later undertook set and costume design for &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. In 1962 he adapted Louis O. Coxe and Robert H. Chapman&#x27;s critically successful Broadway play &quot;Billy Budd&quot; into a film; penning the screenplay, producing, directing, and starring as Captain Vere. In 1968, he was elected the first rector of the University of Dundee and served two consecutive three-year terms.

His autobiography, &quot;Dear Me&quot; (1977), was well received and had him describe his life (ostensibly his childhood) while being interrogated by his own ego, with forays into philosophy, theatre, fame, and self-realisation. From 1969 until his death, his acting and writing took second place to his work on behalf of UNICEF, for which he was a goodwill ambassador and fundraiser. In this role, he visited some of the neediest children and made use of his ability to make people laugh, including many of the world&#x27;s most disadvantaged children. &quot;Sir Peter could make anyone laugh&quot;, UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy is quoted as saying. On 31 October 1984, Ustinov was due to interview Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi for Irish television. She was assassinated on her way to the meeting.

Ustinov served as president of the World Federalist Movement (WFM) from 1991 until his death. He once said, &quot;World government is not only possible, it is inevitable, and when it comes, it will appeal to patriotism in its truest, in its only sense, the patriotism of men who love their national heritages so deeply that they wish to preserve them in safety for the common good&quot;.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions, in November 1977 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at Pinewood Studios on the set of &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;. He was surprised again in December 1994, when Michael Aspel approached him at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva. A car enthusiast since the age of four, he owned a succession of interesting machines ranging from a Fiat Topolino, several Lancias, a Hispano-Suiza, a preselector gearbox Delage, and a special-bodied Jowett Jupiter. He made records like Phoney Folklore that included the song of the Russian peasant &quot;whose tractor had betrayed him&quot; and his &quot;Grand Prix of Gibraltar&quot; was a vehicle for his creative wit and ability at car-engine sound effects and voices.

He spoke English, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Russian fluently, as well as some Turkish and modern Greek. He was proficient in accents and dialects in all his languages. Ustinov provided his own German and French dubbing for some of his roles, both of them for &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot;. As Hercule Poirot, he provided his own voice for the French versions of &quot;Thirteen at Dinner&quot;, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot;, &quot;Murder in Three Acts&quot;, &quot;Appointment with Death&quot;, and &quot;Evil under the Sun&quot;, but unlike Jane Birkin, who had dubbed herself in French for this film and &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;, Ustinov did not provide his voice for the latter (his French voice being provided by Roger Carel, who had already dubbed him in &quot;Spartacus&quot; and other films). He dubbed himself in German as Poirot only in &quot;Evil under the Sun&quot; (his other Poirot roles being undertaken by three actors). However, he provided only his English and German voices for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

In the 1960s, he became a Swiss resident. He was knighted in 1990 and was appointed chancellor of Durham University in 1992, having previously been elected as the first rector of the University of Dundee in 1968 (a role in which he moved from being merely a figurehead to taking on a political role, negotiating with student protesters). Ustinov was re-elected to the post for a second three-year term in 1971, narrowly beating Michael Parkinson after a disputed recount. He received an honorary doctorate from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.

Ustinov was a frequent defender of the Chinese government, stating in an address to Durham University in 2000, &quot;People are annoyed with the Chinese for not respecting more human rights. But with a population that size it&#x27;s very difficult to have the same attitude to human rights.&quot; In 2003, Durham&#x27;s postgraduate college (previously known as the Graduate Society) was renamed Ustinov College. Ustinov went to Berlin on a UNICEF mission in 2002 to visit the circle of United Buddy Bears that promote a more peaceful world between nations, cultures, and religions for the first time. He was determined to ensure that Iraq would also be represented in this circle of about 140 countries. Ustinov also presented and narrated the official video review of the 1987 Formula One season and narrated the documentary series &quot;Wings of the Red Star&quot;. In 1988, he hosted a live television broadcast entitled &quot;The Secret Identity of Jack the Ripper&quot;. Ustinov gave his name to the Foundation of the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for their Sir Peter Ustinov Television Scriptwriting Award, given annually to a young television screenwriter.

==Personal life==
Ustinov was married three times—first to Isolde Denham (1920–1987), daughter of Reginald Denham and Moyna Macgill. The marriage lasted from 1940 to their divorce in 1950, and they had one child, daughter Tamara Ustinov. Isolde was the half-sister of Angela Lansbury, who appeared with Ustinov in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;. 

His second marriage was to Suzanne Cloutier, which lasted from 1954 to their divorce in 1971. They had three children: two daughters, Pavla Ustinov and Andrea Ustinov, and a son, Igor Ustinov. 

His third marriage was to Helene du Lau d&#x27;Allemans, which lasted from 1972 to his death in 2004.

Ustinov was a secular humanist. He was listed as a distinguished supporter of the British Humanist Association, and had once served on its advisory council.

Ustinov suffered from diabetes and a weakened heart in his last years.

In 1999, Sir Peter and his son Igor Ustinov founded the Sir Peter Ustinov Stiftung (&quot;Sir Peter Ustinov Foundation&quot;) in the city of Munich in Germany. The foundation is now based in Frankfurt am Main.

==Death==

Ustinov died on 28 March 2004 of heart failure in a clinic in Genolier, near his home in Bursins, Switzerland, aged 82. He had suffered from diabetes and heart disease. 

Ustinov found his final resting place at the cemetery. His ledger stone bears a cross, despite his self-description as a secular humanist, and the inscription:SIR PETER USTINOV

1921-2004

Musicien-Membre de l&#x27;Institut

==Globalism==
Ustinov was the president of the World Federalist Movement (WFM) from 1991 to 2004, the time of his death. 

Until his death, Ustinov was a member of English PEN, part of the PEN International network that campaigns for freedom of expression.

<text>The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) is an American orchestra based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The orchestra is resident at Heinz Hall, located in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Cultural District. Since 2008, the orchestra&#x27;s music director is Manfred Honeck. The orchestra&#x27;s current president and CEO is Melia Tourangeau.

==History==
===1895–1910: Founding and early history===
The orchestra was founded by the Pittsburgh Arts Society with conductor Frederic Archer in 1895, who brought with him a number of musicians from the Boston Symphony Orchestra and led the PSO in its first concert the following year.

In 1898, Victor Herbert was chosen to lead the orchestra. The orchestra traveled at a more frequent rate under Herbert&#x27;s tenure, performing in Boston, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Canada. Its personnel included such musicians as Luigi von Kunits (later the first conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra) as concertmaster, first violinist Frederick William Stahlberg, second violinist John Stepan Zamecnik, assistant principal cello Gaston Borch, Paul Henneberg as first flute, and Leon Medaer as first clarinet.

Herbert composed two orchestral works that the Pittsburgh Orchestra premiered: his &quot;Suite romantique&quot; op. 31 (which he also dedicated to the orchestra) and the tone poem &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; op. 33. Under Herbert&#x27;s direction, the Pittsburgh Orchestra played as part of the Pan-American Exposition at the 1901 World&#x27;s Fair in Buffalo, New York, for which Herbert had also composed an original work for the exhibition titled &quot;Panamericana: Morceau Characteristique&quot; for the Orchestra to perform. His tenure with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra ended in 1904 because of increasingly strident disagreements with the orchestra&#x27;s manager, George H. Wilson, who disliked Herbert&#x27;s populist manner and personally despised him. 

When Herbert left the orchestra in 1904, the Symphony Society chose as his successor Austrian conductor Emil Paur. Paur took an intellectual approach to his work and avoided theatrics. Trained as a violinist, he had served as conductor of both the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, as well as guest conductor throughout Europe, and held the Pittsburgh Orchestra to the same exacting standards. Paur&#x27;s programs emphasized the classical repertoire and increased the presence of works by Johannes Brahms, whose music was considered too challenging for most audiences at that time. Additionally, Paur clashed with many of the orchestra&#x27;s musicians when he prohibited them from accepting outside performing engagements and continued to hire mainly European musicians. Orchestra manager George H. Wilson resigned on December 24, 1906, shortly after the beginning of Paur&#x27;s third season, saying that his tenure, pride, and pleasure with the orchestra:

: &quot;...have all constrained me during the past two years to bear with the personal idiosyncracies, the superficiality of his musical faith, the narrowness of his musical horizon, his indifference to the success of the out-of-town concerts, the hazard (to the orchestra business) of an uncontrolled temper, the frequent distrust of my motives, and the peculiar and ever-shifting focus of the stupidity of the present conductor...these things are characteristic of the man, not passing symptoms.&quot; 

Paur remained at the head of the orchestra until it disbanded in 1910.

===1910–1938: The New Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra===
In the interim, concert promoter May Beegle founded the Pittsburgh Orchestra Association to bring other musical performers to the city.

Antonio Modarelli, an American conductor and composer, became conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphonic Orchestra in 1930. A German newspaper described his conducting as &quot;forceful, authentic, modern music&quot;, and he was invited to conduct in Moscow. He had taught at Duquesne University and been a band leader in the Navy prior to his work in Europe and with the Symphony.

This program of frequent guest conductors was made in an effort to restore the symphony to its &quot;golden years,&quot; but in effect demoted Modarelli, who was finally asked by the Board to resign in 1936.

Otto Klemperer was responsible for bringing in much new talent while working with the Musicians&#x27; Union to hire both local and imported performers. Since then, the orchestra has experienced ongoing growth and development, including building a substantial endowment fund.

===1938–1948: The Reiner years===
Fritz Reiner was music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1938 to 1948. Reiner studied with Hungarian composer Béla Bartók and programmed many of Bartók&#x27;s works in Pittsburgh Symphony performances.

Women joined the orchestra for the first time during World War II. Eighteen women joined in 1942, and 24 more women joined in 1944. The PSO had more female performers than any other major American symphony during the war.

Victor De Sabata came to Pittsburgh in 1948, in part because of the urgings of his colleague Vladimir Bakaleinikoff, whom he had conducted in Cincinnati in 1927. Ticket sales increased with de Sabata at the helm. He was so popular with local audiences that around 1,200 people attended a concert he conducted at the Syria Mosque during one of Pittsburgh&#x27;s worst snowstorms. He returned to conduct the orchestra in 1949, 1950, and 1951. The orchestra established a Guest Conductor Chair in his name in 2010.

===1952–1976: The Steinberg years===
William Steinberg became the orchestra&#x27;s music director in 1952. During the early part of the 1950s, the Symphony played a number of &quot;industry concerts&quot;, conducted by Steinberg and sponsored by area industries, specifically the United Steelworkers of America. The sponsorship offset costs for industry workers, and the Symphony performed in more convenient locations throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. The Symphony continued to bring music to smaller communities in partnership with Manufacturers Heat and Light Company and Columbia Gas during the Steinberg era.

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performed for audiences in Warsaw, Madrid, Berlin, Zagreb, Reykjavik, and 15 other locations throughout Europe and the Middle East during the State Department tour.

Many of the orchestra&#x27;s earlier recordings were made in the Syrian Mosque with labels such as Capitol Records and Columbia Records. The Pittsburgh Symphony performed at the Syria Mosque from 1926 until 1971. The building was torn down in 1992.

Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony made several recordings for the Command label starting in 1962. These recordings were made at the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh. The technical superiority of the Command recordings was aided by the company&#x27;s use of 35mm film as the recording medium.

Steinberg conducted his final Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concerts as music director in 1976, after which he returned for guest-conducting appearances as music director emeritus.

===1976–1984: The Previn years===
André Previn succeeded Steinberg as music director in 1976. Previn had a collegial working style with symphony musicians and even formed a chamber music trio with Herbert Greenberg, associate concertmaster, and principal cellist Anne Martindale Williams around 1979. In 1981, Previn renewed his contract with the symphony orchestra.

During this time, Victoria Bond served as an affiliate conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra from 1978 to 1980. Bond was the first woman to earn a doctoral degree in orchestral conducting from the Juilliard School and is a prolific composer. While at the Pittsburgh Symphony, she also served as the music director of the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony and the New Amsterdam Symphony in New York City.

Previn often brought jazz to the concert hall. In February 1977, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Previn made their national debut on PBS with eight specials, &quot;Previn and the Pittsburgh&quot;. The Alcoa Foundation sponsored the Emmy-nominated program, which ran for three years. Guests on the program included John Williams, Ella Fitzgerald, and Oscar Peterson.

Previn left the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 1984, credited with &quot;renewing the stature of the orchestra, expanding its position in the community, and giving the city a positive image internationally…&quot;

===1984–1996: The Maazel years===
Lorin Maazel became music consultant to the orchestra in 1984. In 1985, the orchestra elevated Maazel&#x27;s title to music adviser and principal guest conductor. In 1988, Maazel became music director of the orchestra. Maazel announced in 1995 his intention to stand down music director of the orchestra in 1996, to focus on composition. After Maazel&#x27;s death in July 2014, the Pittsburgh Symphony performed memorial pieces for Maazel as well as created a multimedia exhibit featuring Symphony archival materials related to the late director.

Marvin Hamlisch served as principal pops conductor beginning in 1995 until his death in 2012.

===1995–2004: The second century===
A capital campaign was launched in 1993 to increase the Pittsburgh Symphony&#x27;s endowment by $70 million. On April 10, 1995, the orchestra announced the appointment of Mariss Jansons to succeed Maazel in 1996 as its eighth music director. Latvian–born Jansons was well received by critics and audiences in Pittsburgh, who applauded the &quot;warmth and humanity&quot; that he brought to the ensemble. With Jansons, the Pittsburgh Symphony toured worldwide and recorded extensively. During this time, the Symphony was &quot;innovative in drawing new elements of the Pittsburgh region’s population to concerts in Heinz Hall and elsewhere.&quot; Jansons conducted his tenure at the close of the 2003–2004 season.

===2005–2007: Interregnum===
With the 2005–2006 season, the PSO introduced a different model for artistic leadership. During this time, a new collective bargaining agreement was in effect, which gave the musicians increased authority over matters of running the orchestra, such as the hiring of musicians and choice of repertoire. Starting in 2005, Sir Andrew Davis served as the PSO artistic advisor, with Yan Pascal Tortelier as principal guest conductor and Marek Janowski holding the &quot;endowed guest conductor chair.&quot;

Sir Andrew Davis, while providing overall programming input regarding the entire season and leading the orchestra in a variety of styles, paid special attention to the music of British and American composers. Under his direction, the Symphony performed many symphonic, operatic, and choral works ranging from baroque to contemporary. Davis had previously led the Pittsburgh Symphony several times as a guest conductor between 1977 and 1990.

Davis was originally scheduled to step down after the 2007–2008 season, but in October 2007, Davis and the Pittsburgh Symphony mutually agreed to terminate his contract early and for him not to conduct his scheduled concerts in the 2007–2008 season because of increased demands on Davis&#x27; schedule. The contracts of Tortelier and Janowski also expired in 2008. Janowski now holds the Otto Klemperer Guest Conductor Chair with the PSO.

===2008–present: Manfred Honeck===
In May 2006, Manfred Honeck first guest-conducted the PSO. He returned for another guest appearance in November 2006. In January 2007, the PSO announced the appointment of Manfred Honeck as its ninth music director, effective with the 2008–2009 season, in a reversion of conductor leadership format to the traditional music director hierarchy. His initial contract was for three years. In September 2009, the PSO announced the extension of Honeck&#x27;s contract to the 2015–2016 season. In February 2012, the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck&#x27;s contract through the 2019–2020 season. In June 2007, the orchestra announced the appointment of American conductor Leonard Slatkin as the orchestra&#x27;s principal guest conductor for the 2008–2009 season.

In November 2006, the PSO announced a pledge of $29.5 million from the Richard P. Simmons family as the start of a capital challenge for the orchestra to address long-standing financial concerns. In December 2006, the PSO announced the launch of an $80 million capital fund-raising drive after the initial $29.5 million boost from the Simmons family. In March 2009, the PSO announced the discontinuation of its chamber orchestra series after the 2008–2009 season, along with staff reductions of 9 positions.

In September 2009, the Pittsburgh Symphony and Honeck agreed to extend his contract through the 2015–2016 season. In February 2012, the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck&#x27;s contract through the 2019–2020 season. In September 2018, the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck&#x27;s contract through the 2021–2022 season. In September 2021, the PSO announced the newest extension of Honeck&#x27;s contract as music director through the 2027–2028 season.

The first program explored Mozart, with Previn and the Pittsburgh Symphony&#x27;s Patricia Prattis Jennings playing four-handed piano sonatas. Others featured guest artists John Williams, conducting his music from &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;E.T.,&quot; Ella Fitzgerald, Yo-Yo Ma, Pittsburgh Symphony principal cello Nathaniel Rosen (the first American cellist to win the gold medal at the Tchaikovsky International Competition), composer Stephen Sondheim and violinist Itzhak Perlman. Composer Miklos Rosza appeared as a guest to hear the Pittsburgh Symphony play his Oscar-winning score for the movie &quot;Ben-Hur.&quot; Previn displayed his considerable talent as a jazz pianist in a duet with his friend Oscar Peterson, the man Duke Ellington dubbed &quot;the maharajah of the keyboard.&quot; When cameras came into Heinz Hall to film the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra rehearsing in their shirtsleeves, audiences saw a relaxed maestro in bellbottoms who obviously liked and respected the musicians. The first show aired on February 27, 1977, and within two days the Pittsburgh Symphony sold more than 2,500 additional seats.

===&quot;Pittsburgh Symphony Radio&quot;===
Launched in 1982, the Pittsburgh Symphony Radio program is hosted by Jim Cunningham of WQED-FM. It is a complete two-hour concert with Music Director Manfred Honeck and guest artists heard on over 100 PRI and NPR stations across the country. The Pittsburgh Symphony was first broadcast in 1936 when NBC Blue Network began a series of 26 half-hour radio broadcasts over the NBC Blue Network of more than 90 stations. The broadcasts were sponsored by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company.

===Other television relays===
The Pittsburgh Symphony under Gilbert Levine was joined by the London Philharmonic Choir, Kraków Philharmonic Choir, Ankara Polyphonic Choir, and members of the Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh in a program that included the world premiere of &quot;Abraham,&quot; a sacred motet by John Harbison, and Mahler Symphony No. 2 &quot;Resurrection. The event, which was attended by the Pontiff, Rav Elio Toaff, Imam Abdulawahab Hussein Gomaa, and 7,000 invited guests, was telecast on RAI, on PBS, and throughout the world, and released on DVD by WQED Multimedia, Pittsburgh. Subsequent to this concert, at Levine&#x27;s impetus, the Pittsburgh Symphony founded a series of concerts entitled &quot;Music for the Spirit.&quot; He led the first two of these performances of the Haydn &quot;Creation and Mahler Symphony No. 3 in Pittsburgh in 2006.

==Heinz Hall history==
A $10-million reconstruction of the theater took place between 1967 and 1971. Although much of the structure and décor remained the same, a new five-story wing was added to the back of the building. This wing expanded the stage and rehearsal space along with the music library and dressing rooms.

Several concerts took place before the remodel and reopening of the Hall in 1971, including a performance of works by Berlioz, Beethoven and Brahms by the Leonard Rose, Isaac Stern and Eugene Istomin Trio for the 1969 pension fund concert. Questionnaires filled out by symphony followers were collected after the concert and reflected an overwhelming support of the new venue.

Heinz Hall was dedicated in September 1971. The inaugural concerts took place on September 10 and 11 with William Steinberg conducting Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Consecration of the House&quot; overture and Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 (&quot;Resurrection&quot;) with a combined chorus of Pennsylvania State University choirs. The New York Times published an outstanding review of the performances, citing the improvement of the acoustics over previous Symphony venues saying, &quot;Pittsburghers at last have the opportunity to hear (the orchestra) as it ought to sound.&quot;

The Garden Plaza and a four-story addition to the Hall were completed in 1982 by the firm of MacLachlan, Cornelius &amp; Filoni. The plaza included a waterfall and sculpture by London-based artist Angela Connor. The addition to the Hall included two bar/lounge spaces as well as a dining and meeting room. In addition, some public areas were refurbished into reception facilities in 1988.

A $6.5-million renovation began in 1995 with funding provided by the Howard Heinz Endowment and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Strategy 21 program funds. The renovation improved the acoustical, technical and aesthetic qualities of the Hall and was carried out by Architect Albert Filoni, of MacLachlan, Cornelius &amp; Filoni, along with acoustician R. Lawrence Kirkegaard. The Hall reopened with a ribbon cutting ceremony by Governor Tom Ridge and Teresa Heinz.

<doc id="167984" wikidata="Q4334" url="?curid=167984" title="Grace note">
<text>A grace note is a kind of music notation denoting several kinds of musical ornaments. It is usually printed smaller to indicate that it is melodically and harmonically nonessential. When occurring by itself, a single grace note indicates either an acciaccatura when notated with an oblique stroke through the stem, or an appoggiatura when notated without. When they occur in groups, grace notes can be interpreted to indicate any of several different classes of ornamentation, depending on interpretation. For percussion, such as drums, a related concept are ghost notes — supportive snare-hits at a lower volume.

==Notation==
In notation, a grace note is distinguished from a standard note by print size. A grace note is indicated by printing a note much smaller than an ordinary note, sometimes with a slash through the note stem (if two or more grace notes, there might be a slash through the note stem of the first note but not the subsequent grace notes). The presence or absence of a slash through a note stem is often interpreted to indicate the intention of an acciaccatura or an appoggiatura, respectively.

The works of some composers, especially Frédéric Chopin, may contain long series of notes printed in the small type reserved for grace notes simply to show that the amount of time to be taken up by those notes as a whole unit is a subjective matter to be decided by the performer. Such a group of small printed notes may or may not have an accompanying principal note, and so may or may not be considered as grace notes in analysis.

==Function==
A grace note represents an ornament, and distinguishing whether a given singular grace note is to be played as an appoggiatura or acciaccatura in the performance practice of a given historical period (or in the practice of a given composer) is usually the subject of lively debate. This is because we must rely on literary, interpretative accounts of performance practice in those days before such time as audio recording was implemented, and even then, only a composer&#x27;s personal or sanctioned recording could directly document usage.

As either an appoggiatura or an acciaccatura, grace notes occur as notes of short duration before the sounding of the relatively longer-lasting note which immediately follows them. This longer note, to which any grace notes can be considered harmonically and melodically subservient (except in the cases of certain appoggiaturas, in which the ornament may be held for a longer duration than the note it ornaments), is called the &quot;principal&quot; in relation to the grace notes.

A grace note or notes may sometimes be noted in terms of exactly half of the principal note. Where they are multiple, an uncommon view is that their notation must always equal exactly half of the principal note. (i.e. If the principal note is a quarter-note the grace note must be notated as an eighth- note, two sixteenth notes, four thirty-second notes, or eight sixty-fourth notes, etc.)

Grace notes, unlike what are referred to as cue-notes, never affect the rhythmic subdivision, or musical &quot;count&quot; of the bar in which they are contained - and therefore, do not require other notes to be dropped from the bar to keep the time signature intact.

==Use in music==
In bagpipe music there is extensive use of grace notes. Indeed, because the chanter is not tongued but supplied by a continuous air source from the bag, grace notes are sometimes the only way to differentiate between notes. For example, inserting a grace note between two crotchets (quarter notes) played at the same pitch is the only way to indicate them as opposed to them sounding like a single minim (half note). Various multiple grace note ornaments are formalised into distinct types, such as &quot;doublings&quot;, &quot;throws&quot;, and &quot;birls&quot;. A single grace note is played on the beat as is the first grace note of a complex ornament such as a doubling. Some complex ornaments, such as &quot;taorluath&quot; can be played starting or ending on the beat. Grace notes are typically played as short as possible by lifting the fingers quickly and a short distance off the chanter.

In modern editions of Western classical works, editors often seek to eliminate the potential for different interpretations of ornamental symbology, of which grace notes are a prime example, by converting a composer&#x27;s original ornamental notation into literal notation, the interpretation of which is far less subject to variation. Most modern composers, although by no means all of them, have followed this trend in the &quot;prima facie&quot; notation of their works.

In the context of Indian classical music (Hindustani (North Indian), Carnatic (South Indian)) some specific forms of notes (swara-s) fulfill the technique of playing a note (swara). Such ornaments in Indian Classical Music are important for the proper rendition and essential to create the beauty of a raga. Some notes are linked with its preceding and succeeding note; these linked notes are called &quot;Kan-swars&quot; (grace notes). Kan-swars deal with so called &#x27;touch notes&#x27; (&#x27;sparsh&#x27; means &quot;touch&quot; in Hindi (Devanagari). These grace notes (acciaccatura) are often referred to as &quot;sparsh-swars&quot;. &quot;Kan-swars&quot; or &quot;sparsh-swars&quot; can be executed vocally and on instruments in three ways: 
# using a swift short glide (meend or ghaseet),
# as a &quot;Sparsh&quot; (technique of playing a note on a plucked stringed instrument, the movement of notes is ascending) and
# as a &quot;Krintan&quot; (the opposite of a Sparsh, movement of notes is descending).
In a book on sitar compositions, Kaṇ has been defined as &#x27;fast deflection which can be approached while descending or ascending&#x27;. The act of Kaṇ being repeated twice, thrice or four times in a single stroke of mizrāb is called Krintan.

<doc id="167990" wikidata="Q1292442" url="?curid=167990" title="Suomenlinna">
<text>Suomenlinna (; until 1918 Viapori, ), or Sveaborg (), is a sea fortress composed of eight islands, of which six have been fortified; it is about 4 km southeast of the city center of Helsinki, the capital of Finland. Suomenlinna is popular with tourists and locals, who enjoy it as a picturesque picnic site. Originally named &quot;Sveaborg&quot; (Castle of the Swedes), or &quot;Viapori&quot; as referred to by Finnish-speaking Finns, it was renamed in Finnish to &quot;Suomenlinna&quot; (Castle of Finland) in 1918 for patriotic and nationalistic reasons, though it is still known by its original name in Sweden and by Swedish-speaking Finns. Due to its strategic geographical location, it sometimes used to be known as Gibraltar of the North.

The Swedish crown commenced the construction of the fortress in 1748 as protection against Russian expansionism. The general responsibility for the fortification work was given to Augustin Ehrensvärd. The original plan of the bastion fortress was strongly influenced by the ideas of Vauban, a Frenchman and the foremost military engineer of the time, and the principles of the star fort style of fortification, albeit adapted to a group of rocky islands. Famous for these bastion fortifications, Suomenlinna became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991.

During the Finnish War, Sweden surrendered the fortress to Russia on 3 May 1808, paving the way for the occupation of Finland by Russian forces in 1809, and then the establishment of the Grand Duchy of Finland at the conclusion of the war. The islands were then used as a base for the Russian Baltic Fleet in World War I, with Russia beginning the construction of the Krepost Sveaborg in 1915. Russian forces left after Finland declared its independence in 1917. Finland then managed Suomenlinna through the Defense Department until turning most of it over to civilian control in 1973.

== Geography ==

The Suomenlinna district of Helsinki lies southeast of downtown Helsinki and consists of eight islands. Five of the islands are connected by either bridges or a sandbar landbridge. &quot;Länsi-Mustasaari&quot; (sv: &quot;Västersvartö&quot;) is bridged to &quot;Pikku Mustasaari&quot; (sv: &quot;Lilla Östersvartö&quot;), which is bridged to &quot;Iso Mustasaari&quot; (sv: &quot;Stora Östersvartö&quot;), which is bridged to &quot;Susisaari&quot; (sv: &quot;Vargö&quot;), which was connected to &quot;Susiluoto&quot; (sv: &quot;Vargskär&quot;) by filling in the separating waterway during the Russian period. This island, which has the greatest concentration of fortifications was renamed &quot;Gustavssvärd&quot; (King Gustav&#x27;s sword) (fi: &quot;Kustaanmiekka&quot;) during the construction by Sweden. The three unconnected islands are &quot;Särkkä&quot; (sv: &quot;Långören&quot;), &quot;Lonna&quot; (sv: &quot;Lonnan&quot;), and &quot;Pormestarinluodot&quot; (sv: &quot;Borgmästargrundet&quot;). The total land area is . Instead of using the normal Finnish postal addressing scheme (consisting of a street name and a house number), the addresses at Suomenlinna consist of a letter code for the island and then a house number. For example, &quot;C 83&quot; is house #83 on Iso-Mustasaari (code C). The postal code for the Suomenlinna district is 00190.

== History ==
=== The Swedish era ===
==== Background ====

Early on in the Great Northern War, Russia took advantage of Swedish weakness in Ingria (sv: &quot;Ingermanland&quot;) and captured the area near the Neva River as well as the Swedish forts, Nyen and Nöteborg, built to protect it. In 1703, Peter the Great founded his new capital, Saint Petersburg, in that easternmost corner of the Gulf of Finland. In the approach to it he built the fortified naval base of Kronstadt. Russia soon became a maritime power and a force to be reckoned with in the Baltic Sea. The situation posed a threat to Sweden, which until that time had been the dominant power in the Baltic. This was visibly demonstrated by the use of naval forces in the Russian capture of Viborg in 1710. The main Swedish naval base at Karlskrona was too far to the south to meet Sweden&#x27;s new needs for its navy in the 18th century, which often resulted in Swedish ships reaching the coast of Finland only after Russian ships and troops had either started or completed their spring campaigns.

The lack of coastal defenses was keenly felt with Russian landings in Helsingfors in the spring of 1713 and the Swedish failure to blockade the Hanko Peninsula in 1714. A Russian naval campaign against the Swedish coast towards the end of the Great Northern War further outlined the need to develop Finnish coastal defenses. Immediately after the war ended the first plans were set in motion in Sweden to construct an archipelago fleet and a base of operations for it in Finland. However, nothing with regard to Sveaborg took place until the end of Russo-Swedish War of 1741–1743. Fortifications were left unfinished at Hamina and Lappeenranta while Hämeenlinna was being built into a supply base. Lack of funds, unwillingness to devote funds for defending Finland, and the belief (arising just before the war) that Russia would be pushed away from the Baltic Sea were the main causes for the lack of progress.

The following Russo-Swedish War of 1741–1743, which quickly turned from a Swedish attack into a Russian occupation of Finland, again underlined the importance of developing fortifications in Finland. Lack of base of operations for naval forces made it difficult for the Swedish navy to operate in the area. Other European states were also concerned about developments regarding Russia, especially France, with whom Sweden had concluded a military alliance. After lengthy debate, the Swedish parliament decided in 1747 to both fortify the Russian frontier and establish a naval base at Helsingfors as a counter to Kronstadt. Augustin Ehrensvärd (1710–1772), a young lieutenant colonel, was given the responsibility of designing the fortresses and directing construction operations. 

==== Construction ====
Sweden started building the fortresses in January 1748. Ehrensvärd&#x27;s plan contained two fortifications: a sea fortress at Svartholm near the small town of Lovisa, and a larger sea fortress and naval base (Sveaborg) at Helsingfors. There were two main aspects to Ehrensvärd&#x27;s design for Sveaborg: a series of independent fortifications across several linked islands and, at the very heart of the complex, a navy dockyard. In addition to the island fortress itself, seafacing fortifications on the mainland would ensure that an enemy could not acquire a beach-head from which to stage attacks on the sea fort. The plan was also to stock munitions for the whole Finnish contingent of the Swedish Army and Royal Swedish Navy there. Additional plans were made for fortifying the Hanko Peninsula, but these were postponed.

Construction started in early 1748 kept expanding, and by September there were around 2,500 men building the fortresses. 
Initially the soldiers were housed in the vaults of the fortifications, while the officers had specially built quarters integrated into the baroque cityscape composition of the overall plan. The most ambitious plan was left only half completed: a baroque square on Iso Mustasaari partly based on the model of Place Vendôme in Paris. As the construction work progressed, more residential buildings were built, many following the shape of the fortification lines. Ehrensvärd and some of the other officers were keen artists who made oil paintings presenting a view of life in the fortress during its construction, and giving the impression of a lively &quot;fortress town&quot; community.
Due to repeated Russian threats in 1749 and 1750, more effort was placed on the island fortifications at the expense of those on the mainland, so that a safe base of operations could be secured for the Swedish naval units along the Finnish coast. Using the military garrisoned in Finland as the workforce, construction continued with over 6,000 workers in 1750. Fortifications at Gustavssvärd were completed in 1751 and the main fortifications on Vargö were ready in 1754. The fortress was fully operational though unfinished. These accomplishments did not reduce the pace of construction and in 1755 there were 7,000 workers constructing the fortifications outside of Helsingfors which at the time had around 2,000 residents. The substantial fortification work on the islands south of the town brought it a new and unexpected importance. Swedish participation to the Seven Years&#x27; War halted the construction efforts in 1757, which also marked the end of the rapid construction phase of Sveaborg.

This period in Swedish history was known as the Age of Liberty, during which the kingdom was under increased parliamentary control, divided into two political parties, the Hats and the Caps. Ehrensvärd had been supported by the Hats, so when the Caps rose to power in 1766 he was relieved of his post and replaced with ardent Caps supporter Christopher Falkengréen. However, after 1769 when the Hats regained power, Ehrensvärd was again placed in command of the Swedish archipelago fleet in Finland, officially the &quot;arméens flotta&quot; (&quot;fleet of the army&quot;), and returned to Sveaborg. But additional progress had not been made on the fortifications when Ehrensvärd died in 1772. Efforts to improve the fortress continued under Jacob Magnus Sprengtporten, but his tenure was cut short by disagreements with King Gustav III. Once again efforts slowed down as garrisons were reduced, and in 1776 Sveaborg&#x27;s commander reported that he could not even man one-tenth of the artillery placed in the fort. Even at the start of the Russo-Swedish War in 1788 Sveaborg remained in an incomplete state.

Facilities for constructing ships for the Swedish archipelago fleet were built at Sveaborg in the 1760s. In 1764 the first three archipelago frigates were launched from there. In addition to the construction of the fortifications and ships, naval officer training was started by Ehrensvärd at his own expense at Sveaborg in 1770. It took until 1779 before a naval military school was formally founded there.

==== Service ====

Sveaborg was formed and stocked according to the needs of the Swedish archipelago fleet and thus was unable to repair and refit the Swedish battlefleet after the battle of Hogland. Facilities were also found lacking at Sveaborg, especially in the areas intended for taking care of the sick and wounded. Russian control of the waters outside of Sveaborg practically blockaded the Swedish battlefleet to Sveaborg. By cutting the coastal sea route past Hangö, Russians prevented supplies from being shipped from Sweden to Sveaborg. The Swedish fleet finally managed to set sail for its base at Karlskrona on 20 November when the Baltic Sea had already frozen severely enough that ice had to be sawed open before some ships could move. The fleet could not overwinter at Sveaborg since it lacked the facilities and supplies for fitting the ships.

While the route to Sweden was open again in late 1788 and in early 1789, Russian ships cut the connection from Sveaborg to Sweden by forming a blockade at Porkkala cape. Sveaborg was the most important location for archipelago fleet&#x27;s ship construction and fitting during the war. Even so, and despite efforts, several ships remained unfinished at Sveaborg until the end of the war. The importance of Sveaborg did not escape the Russians whose broad operational plan for 1790 included a siege of Sveaborg both from sea and land.

Following a pact between Alexander I and Napoleon, Russia launched a campaign against Sweden and occupied Finland in 1808. The Russians easily took Helsingfors in early 1808 and began bombarding the fortress.
Its commander, Carl Olof Cronstedt, negotiated a cease-fire. When no Swedish reinforcements had arrived by May, Sveaborg, with almost 7,000 men, surrendered. The reasons for Cronstedt&#x27;s actions remain somewhat unclear; but the hopeless situation, psychological warfare by the Russians, some (possibly) bribed advisors, fear for the lives of a large civilian population, lack of gunpowder, and their physical isolation are some likely causes for the surrender. By the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Sweden ceded its eastern territory of Finland and the Grand Duchy of Finland was established within the Russian Empire. The Swedish period in Finnish history, which had lasted some seven centuries, came to an end.
=== Under Russian rule ===
After taking over the fortress, the Russians started an extensive building program, mostly extra barracks, and extended the dockyard and reinforced the fortification lines. The long period of peace following the transfer of power was shattered by the Crimean War of 1853–56. The French–British–Ottoman alliance decided to engage Russia on two fronts and sent an Anglo-French fleet to the Baltic Sea. For two summers during the Åland War the fleet shelled the towns and fortifications along the Finnish coast. The bombardment of Sveaborg (also known then as &quot;Viapori&quot;) by the forces of Richard Saunders Dundas and Charles Pénaud on 9–10 August 1855 lasted 47 hours and the fortress was badly damaged, but they were unable to knock out the Russian guns. After the bombardment, the Anglo-French fleet sent no troops ashore and instead set sail for Kronstadt.

After the Crimean War extensive restoration work was begun at Sveaborg. A new ring of earthworks with artillery emplacements was built at the western and southern edges of the islands.

The next stage in the arming of Sveaborg and the Gulf of Finland came in the build-up to World War I. The fortress and its surrounding islands became part of &quot;Peter the Great&#x27;s naval fortification&quot; designed to safeguard the capital, Saint Petersburg.
=== Finnish ownership ===
Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the fortress became a possession of a fully independent Finland. After the Finnish Civil War, a prison camp existed on the island. The fortress was officially renamed &quot;Suomenlinna&quot; (castle of Finland) as part of the wave of nationalism.

No longer very practical as a military base, Suomenlinna was turned over to civilian administration in 1973. An independent government department, the Governing Body of Suomenlinna, was formed to administer the unique complex. At the time there was some debate over its Finnish name, with some suggesting that the old name &quot;Viapori&quot; be restored, but the newer name was retained. The presence of the military on the islands has been drastically scaled down in recent decades. The Suomenlinna garrison houses the Naval Academy () of the Finnish Navy on &quot;Pikku Mustasaari&quot;. Suomenlinna still flies the war flag, or the swallow-tailed state flag of Finland.

== Present day ==
Suomenlinna is now one of the most popular tourist attractions in Helsinki as well as a popular picnicking spot for the city&#x27;s inhabitants. In 2009, a record 713,000 people visited Suomenlinna, most between May and September. A number of museums exist on the island, as well as the last surviving Finnish submarine, &quot;Vesikko&quot;.
There are about 900 permanent inhabitants on the islands, and 350 people work there year-round.

There is a minimum-security penal labor colony () in Suomenlinna, whose inmates work on the maintenance and reconstruction of the fortifications. Only volunteer inmates who pledge non-use of controlled substances are accepted to the labour colony.

For the general public, Suomenlinna is served by ferries all year, and a service tunnel supplying heating, water and electricity was built in 1982. In the beginning of the 1990s, the tunnel was modified so that it can also be used for emergency transport. 

Transport to and from the island is generally ceased between the hours of 0300 and 0600 daily, but is otherwise regular and frequent. 

Suomenlinna has been known as a location for avant-garde culture. In the mid-1980s, the Nordic Arts Centre was established on the island. Several buildings have been converted into artists&#x27; studios, which are let by the administration at reasonable rates. During the summer there is an art school for children. The performances of the Suomenlinna summer theater regularly draw full houses.

Between 2 and 6 September 2015, the Finnish postal service ran a test of the use of drones to deliver parcels between Helsinki and Suomenlinna. The parcels were limited to or less, and flights were under the control of a pilot.

The island houses a backpackers&#x27; hostel operating in a converted school building, built in 1908 and having served as a Russian school (1909-1917), military office (1918-1919), Finnish school (1920-1959), and a canteen and entertainment venue for soldiers (1959-1972). 

Suomenlinna Church, built in 1854, was adapted in 1929 to include a lighthouse beacon. Both the church and beacon are still active today. The lighthouse beacon was modernised to use LED lighting in 2019.

== In literature ==
The Finnish-Swedish poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg wrote a poem called &quot;Sveaborg&quot;, one of the 35 short poems that together constitute his epic &quot;The Tales of Ensign Stål&quot;. It includes the following two verses about the fortress, which allude specifically to the &quot;Gustav&#x27;s Sword&quot; (&quot;Gustavssvärd&quot;) bastion and its guns:

Sveaborg is also mentioned in the lyrics of Gunnar Wennerberg&#x27;s 1849 hymn &quot;O Gud, som styrer folkens öden&quot; (&quot;Oh God, who steers the people&#x27;s fate&quot;), in which Sweden&#x27;s &quot;age-old freedom&quot; is described as being &quot;...our protection in gloomy dangers, our consolation in every bleached sorrow, our defence against the hegemon&#x27;s forces, and stronger than Sveaborg&quot;. As these words were written forty years after the Swedish cession of Finland to Russia, the use of Sveaborg as a simile has deliberately historic overtones.

George R. R. Martin wrote a short story about the surrender of Viapori, &quot;The Fortress&quot;, when he was a college student. It was published in his 2007 volume of short stories, &quot;Dreamsongs&quot;.

<doc id="167991" wikidata="Q1208177" url="?curid=167991" title="Pentium OverDrive">
<text>The Pentium OverDrive was a microprocessor marketing brand name used by Intel, to cover a variety of consumer upgrade products sold in the mid-1990s. It was originally released for 486 motherboards, and later some Pentium sockets. Intel dropped the brand, as it failed to appeal to corporate buyers, and discouraged new system sales.

==486 sockets==
The Pentium OverDrive is a heavily modified, 3.3 volt Pentium P54 core manufactured on 0.6 micrometer technology. It is fitted with a 486-compatible bus unit (though with an increased pin-count), an integrated heatsink and fan, and 32 kB of level 1 cache, double the 16 kB offered on regular P54C chips. As the data bus was effectively reduced to 32-bit width, per-clock performance was much lower than that of a &#x27;regular&#x27; Pentium, though still substantially faster compared to a similarly clocked 486 owing to the Pentium&#x27;s architectural improvements, such as the much improved FPU. It was also equipped with an integrated 3.3 volt power regulator as many 486 motherboards only provided 5 volt power.

The 63 MHz model was launched in February 1995, and supported 25 MHz bus systems. The much faster 83 MHz version, which supported both 25 (63 MHz effective) and 33 MHz bus systems, launched much later the same year on September, and was very expensive at $299 compared to other upgrade alternatives, such as those based on AMD&#x27;s 5x86 and Cyrix&#x27;s Cx5x86 chips.

The processor&#x27;s heatsink is permanently attached, and the removable fan module is powered via spring-like metal prongs that connect to a trio of conductors on the surface of the chip. The clip that releases the fan is visible in the first photo, at the top left corner of the CPU. The central plastic &quot;column&quot; that leads from the center of the fan houses the fan wiring and leads down the side of the heatsink at this corner. The small plastic points at each top left of this column are the locking mechanism for the fan and are released by squeezing them. The opposite corner of the CPU has a latch that locks the fan around underneath the heatsink, by swinging into place upon assembly. The processor monitors the fan and will throttle back on clock speed to prevent overheating and damage if the fan is not operating. This is a predecessor to the internal temperature detection and protection in Intel&#x27;s modern processors.

===Compatibility and performance===
During development, Intel had changed the design specification, causing various compatibility and performance problems with some boards that were previously fully compatible. For instance, the Packard Bell 450 motherboard required a specially-designed interposer to be installed between the processor and the motherboard to cope with the changed specification, with the unfortunate consequence of precluding access to the motherboard&#x27;s level 2 cache, resulting in sub-par performance. In addition, some older chipsets do not support the write-back functionality of the chip&#x27;s level 1 cache, which could also reduce performance. However, the majority of Socket 3 motherboards, particularly later (post-1994) VLB and most PCI boards, provide proper support for the Pentium OverDrive including fully operational access to the level 2 cache, and many earlier boards also support the processor with varying levels of compatibility and performance.

Performance-wise, many popular synthetic benchmarks of the time showed the Pentium OverDrive under-performing its much cheaper and higher-clocked rivals, though its real-world performance (given the motherboard cache was being optimally used) could be much different: programs that were floating-point dependent or optimized for the Pentium architecture (as were both becoming increasingly common in the mid to late nineties) derived a more substantial benefit from the Pentium OverDrive, particularly the 83 MHz version. In addition, it fully supported programs and operating systems specifically coded for the Pentium architecture, such as many emulators, multimedia utilities and even later Windows operating systems and games; however, the benefit of running such programs on a clock- and motherboard bus-constrained system may be questionable.

===Models===
PODP5V63
* Introduced February 3, 1995
* 234 pins, P24T pinout
* 5 or 3.3 volts
* L1 Cache 32 kB (16 kB + 16 kB)
* 63 MHz on 25 MHz front side bus (25 × 2.5)

PODP5V83
* Introduced September 1995
* 234 pins, P24T pinout
* 5 or 3.3 volts
* L1 Cache 32 kB (16 kB + 16 kB)
* 83 MHz on 33 MHz front side bus (33 × 2.5)

Some 63 CPU models (part number 109X4405H6J05) have 234 pins instead of 235. Some CPUs came with the pin chopped off (Pin A4) and others had the pin completely missing and covered with the encapsulation.

==Pentium sockets==
The original Socket 4 Pentium chips ran at higher voltages (5V) than later models. Although little known, Intel did in fact release an OverDrive chip for these sockets, that used an internal clock multiplier of 2, to change them to a &quot;120/133&quot; machine.

*PODP5V120: 120 MHz on 60 MHz bus
*PODP5V133: 133 MHz on 66 MHz bus or 120 MHz on 60 MHz bus

The OverDrive Processors for the Pentium 75, 90 and 100 were also released (Socket 5, 3.3 V), running at 125, 150 and 166 MHz (clock multiplier of 2.5). The 125 is an oddity, because Intel never made a Pentium 125 as a stand-alone processor.

*PODP3V125: 125 MHz on 50 MHz bus
*PODP3V150: 150 MHz on 60 MHz bus
*PODP3V166: 166 MHz on 66 MHz bus

These were replaced by Pentium OverDrive MMX, which also upgraded the Pentium 120 - 200 MHz to the faster version with MMX technology.

*PODPMT60X150: up to 150 MHz on 60 MHz bus (clock multiplier of 2.5)
*PODPMT66X166: up to 166 MHz on 66 MHz bus (clock multiplier of 2.5)
*PODPMT60X180: up to 180 MHz on 60 MHz bus (clock multiplier of 3.0)
*PODPMT66X200: up to 200 MHz on 66 MHz bus (clock multiplier of 3.0)
==Socket 8==
In 1998, the Pentium II OverDrive, part number PODP66X333, was released as an upgrade path for Pentium Pro owners. This upgrade could be used in single and dual processor Socket 8 systems, or in two sockets of quad processor Socket 8 systems with CPU 3 and 4 removed. It could also be run in quad and hexa processor Socket 8 systems unofficially after some users upgraded their ALR 6x6 systems with them.

Combining the Pentium II Deschutes core in a flip-chip package with a 512 kB full speed L2 cache chip from the Pentium II Xeon into a Socket 8-compatible module resulted in a 300 or 333 MHz processor that could run on a 60 or 66 MHz front side bus. This combination brought together some of the more attractive aspects of the Pentium II and the Pentium II Xeon: MMX support/improved 16-bit performance and full-speed L2 cache, respectively. This combination would be replicated by the later &quot;Dixon&quot; mobile Pentium II core with 256 kB of full-speed cache embedded on-die.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, the Pentium II OverDrive CPU is family 6, model 3. Though it was based on the Deschutes core, when queried by the CPUID command, it identified itself as a Klamath Pentium II. As noted in the Pentium II Processor update documentation from Intel, &quot;although this processor has a CPUID of 163xh, it uses a Pentium II processor CPUID 065xh processor core.&quot;

The major customer for these chips was Intel&#x27;s ASCI Red supercomputer, stationed at Sandia National Laboratories. It was the first computer to break the teraFLOPS performance mark in late 1996, which up until the upgrade was running dual Pentium Pro CPUs in its nodes since its inception. ASCI Red had all 4,510 CPUs upgraded from dual Pentium Pros to dual Pentium II Overdrives in 1999, making it the first computer to break over two teraFLOPS after the upgrade while maintaining its position as the world&#x27;s fastest on the TOP500 list at the time as it continues to hold that position from its first full operations in 1997 up until late 2000. ASCI Red continued to use dual Pentium II OverDrive CPUs for the remainder of its usage until it was finally decommissioned in 2006.

<doc id="167999" wikidata="Q1202514" url="?curid=167999" title="RISC OS">
<text>RISC OS () is an operating system designed to run on ARM computers. Originally designed in 1987 by Acorn Computers of England, it was made for use in its new line of ARM-based Archimedes personal computers and was then shipped with other computers produced by the company. Despite the demise of Acorn, RISC OS continues to be developed today by the RISC OS Open community on version 5.0 of the system that was open sourced in 2018.

RISC OS is a modular operating system and takes its name from the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture it supports. It incorporates a graphical user interface and a windowing system. Between 1987 and 1998, RISC OS shipped with every ARM-based Acorn computer including the Archimedes line, Acorn&#x27;s R line (with RISC iX as a dual-boot option), RiscPC, A7000, and prototype models such as the Acorn NewsPad and Phoebe computer. A version of the OS, named NCOS, was used in Oracle&#x27;s Network Computer and compatible systems. 

After the break-up of Acorn, development of the OS was forked and continued separately by several companies, including , Pace Micro Technology, Castle Technology, and RISC OS Developments. Since then, it has been bundled with several ARM-based desktop computers such as the Iyonix PC and A9home. Most recent stable versions run on the ARMv3/ARMv4 RiscPC, the ARMv5 Iyonix, ARMv7 Cortex-A8 processors and Cortex-A9 processors and the low-cost educational Raspberry Pi series of computers, with the exception of the Raspberry Pi 5.

== History ==
The first version of RISC OS was originally released in 1987 as &quot;Arthur 1.20&quot;. The next version, , became and was released in April 1989. RISC OS 3.00 was released with the A5000 in 1991, and contained many new features. By 1996, RISC OS had been shipped on over 500,000 systems.

Acorn officially halted work on the OS in January 1999, renaming themselves Element 14. In March 1999 a new company, RISCOS Ltd, licensed the rights to develop a desktop version of RISC OS from Element 14, and continued the development of RISC OS 3.8, releasing it as &quot;RISC OS 4&quot; in July 1999. Meanwhile, Element 14 had also kept a copy of RISC OS 3.8 in house, which they developed into NCOS for use in set-top boxes. In 2000, as part of the acquisition of Acorn Group plc by MSDW Investment, RISC OS was sold to Pace Micro Technology, who later sold it to Castle Technology Ltd.

In May 2001, RISCOS Ltd launched &quot;RISC OS Select&quot;, a subscription scheme allowing users access to the latest RISC OS 4 updates. These upgrades are released as soft-loadable ROM images, separate to the ROM where the boot OS is stored, and are loaded at boot time. Select 1 was shipped in May 2002, with Select 2 following in November 2002 and the final release of Select 3 in June 2004. In the same month, RISC OS 4.39, dubbed &quot;RISC OS Adjust&quot;, was released. RISC OS Adjust was a culmination of all the Select Scheme updates to date, released as a physical set of replaceable ROMs for the RiscPC and A7000 series of machines.

Meanwhile, in October 2002, Castle Technology released the &quot;Acorn clone&quot; Iyonix PC. This ran a 32-bit (in contrast to 26-bit) variant of RISC OS, named &quot;RISC OS 5&quot;. RISC OS 5 is a separate evolution of RISC OS based upon the NCOS work done by Pace. The following year, Castle Technology bought RISC OS from Pace for an undisclosed sum. In October 2006, Castle announced a shared source license plan, managed by RISC OS Open Limited, for elements of &quot;RISC OS 5&quot;.

In October 2018, RISC OS 5 was re-licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

In 2018 RISC OS Developments acquired Castle Technology Ltd including its intellectual property.

In December 2020, the source code of RISC OS 3.71 was leaked to The Pirate Bay.
== Features ==
=== OS core ===
The OS is single-user and employs cooperative multitasking (CMT). While most current desktop OSes use preemptive multitasking (PMT) and multithreading, remains with a CMT system. By 2003, many users had called for the OS to migrate to PMT. The OS memory protection is not comprehensive.

The core of the OS is stored in ROM, giving a fast bootup time and safety from operating system corruption. RISC OS 4 and 5 are stored in of flash memory, or as a ROM image on SD card on single board computers such as the Beagleboard or Raspberry Pi, allowing the operating system to be updated without having to replace the ROM chip. The OS is made up of several modules. These can be added to and replaced, including soft-loading of modules not present in ROM at run time and on-the-fly replacement. This design has led to OS developers releasing rolling updates to their versions of the OS, while third parties are able to write OS replacement modules to add new features. OS modules are accessed via software interrupts (SWIs), similar to system calls in other operating systems.

Most of the OS has defined application binary interfaces (ABIs) to handle filters and vectors. The OS provides many ways in which a program can intercept and modify its operation. This simplifies the task of modifying its behaviour, either in the GUI, or deeper. As a result, there are several third-party programs which allow customising the OS look and feel.

=== File system ===

The file system is volume-oriented: the top level of the file hierarchy is a volume (disc, network share) prefixed by the file system type. To determine file type, the OS uses metadata instead of file extensions. Colons are used to separate the file system from the rest of the path; the root is represented by a dollar (codice_1) sign and directories are separated by a full stop (codice_2). Extensions from foreign file systems are shown using a slash (codice_3 becomes codice_4). For example, codice_5 is the root of the disc named &quot;HardDisc4&quot; using the Advanced Disc Filing System (ADFS) file system. filetypes can be preserved on other systems by appending the hexadecimal type as &#x27;codice_6&#x27; to filenames. When using cross-platform software, filetypes can be invoked on other systems by naming appending &#x27;codice_7&#x27; to the filename under .

A file system can present a file of a given type as a volume of its own, similar to a loop device. The OS refers to this function as an image filing system. This allows transparent handling of archives and similar files, which appear as directories with some special properties. Files inside the image file appear in the hierarchy underneath the parent archive. It is not necessary for the archive to contain the data it refers to: some symbolic link and network share file systems put a reference inside the image file and go elsewhere for the data.

The file system abstraction layer API uses 32-bit file offsets, making the largest single file 4 GiB (minus 1 byte) long. However, prior to RISC OS 5.20 the file system abstraction layer and many RISC OS-native file systems limited support to 31 bits (just under 2 GiB) to avoid dealing with apparently negative file extents when expressed in two&#x27;s complement notation.

=== File formats ===

The OS uses metadata to distinguish file formats. Some common file formats from other systems are mapped to filetypes by the MimeMap module.

=== Kernel ===
The RISC OS kernel is single-tasking and controls handling of interrupts, DMA services, memory allocation and the video display; the cooperative multi-tasking is provided by the WindowManager module.

=== Desktop ===

The WIMP interface is based on a stacking window manager and incorporates three mouse buttons (named &quot;Select&quot;, &quot;Menu&quot; and &quot;Adjust&quot;), context-sensitive menus, window order control (i.e. send to back) and dynamic window focus (a window can have input focus at any position on the stack). The icon bar (Dock) holds icons which represent mounted disc drives, RAM discs, running applications, system utilities and docked: files, directories or inactive applications. These icons have context-sensitive menus and support drag-and-drop operation. They represent the running application as a whole, irrespective of whether it has open windows.

The GUI functions on the concept of files. The Filer, a spatial file manager, displays the contents of a disc. Applications are run from the Filer view and files can be dragged to the Filer view from applications to perform saves, rather than opening a separate &#x27;Save&#x27; dialog box where the user must navigate to a location already visible in the Finder. In addition, files can be directly transferred between applications by dragging a save icon into another application&#x27;s window.

Application directories are used to store applications. The OS differentiates them from normal directories through the use of an exclamation mark (also called a &quot;pling&quot; or &quot;shriek&quot;) prefix. Double-clicking on such a directory launches the application rather than opening the directory. The application&#x27;s executable files and resources are contained within the directory, but normally they remain hidden from the user. Because applications are self-contained, this allows drag-and-drop installing and removing.

The &quot;Style Guide&quot; encourages a consistent look and feel across applications. This was introduced in and specifies application appearance and behaviour. Acorn&#x27;s own main bundled applications were not updated to comply with the guide until &#x27;s &quot;Select&quot; release in 2001.

=== Font manager ===
RISC OS was the first operating system to provide scalable anti-aliased fonts. Anti-aliased fonts were already familiar from Arthur, and their presence in RISC OS was confirmed in an early 1989 preview, featuring in the final RISC OS 2 product, launched in April 1989.

A new version of the font manager employing &quot;new-style outline fonts&quot; was made available after the release of RISC OS, offering full support for the printing of scalable fonts, and was provided with Acorn Desktop Publisher. It was also made available separately and bundled with other applications. This outline font manager provides support for the rendering of font outlines to bitmaps for screen and printer use, employing anti-aliasing for on-screen fonts, utilising sub-pixel anti-aliasing and caching for small font sizes. At the time of the introduction of Acorn&#x27;s outline font manager, the developers of rival desktop systems were either contemplating or promising outline font support for still-unreleased products such as Macintosh System 7 and OS/2 version 2.

From 1993, starting with the German RISC OS 3.12, and in 1994 for RISC OS 3.5, it has been possible to use an outline anti-aliased font in the WindowManager for UI elements, rather than the bitmap system font from previous versions. RISC OS 4 does not support Unicode but &quot;RISC OS 5 provides a Unicode Font Manager which is able to display Unicode characters and accept text in UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32. Other parts of the RISC OS kernel and core modules support text described in UTF-8.&quot;

Support for the characters of RISC OS (and some other historic computers) was added to Unicode 13.0 (in 2020).

=== Bundled applications ===

 is available in several distributions, all of which include a small standard set of desktop applications, but some of which also include a much wider set of useful programs. Some of those richer distributions are freely available, some are paid for.

== Backward compatibility ==
Limited software portability exists with subsequent versions of the OS and hardware. Single-tasking BBC BASIC applications often require only trivial changes, if any. Successive OS upgrades have raised more serious issues of backward compatibility for desktop applications and games. Applications still being maintained by their author(s) or others have sometimes historically been amended to provide compatibility.

The introduction of the RiscPC in 1994 and its later StrongARM upgrade raised issues of incompatible code sequences and proprietary squeezing (data compression). Patching of applications for the StrongARM was facilitated and Acorn&#x27;s &quot;UnsqueezeAIF&quot; software unsqueezed images according to their AIF header. The incompatibilities prompted release by &quot;The ARM Club&quot; of its &quot;Game On!&quot; and &quot;StrongGuard&quot; software. They allowed some formerly incompatible software to run on new and upgraded systems. The version of the OS for the A9home prevented the running of software without an AIF header (in accord with Application Note 295) to stop &quot;trashing the desktop&quot;.

The Iyonix PC () and A9home (custom ) saw further software incompatibility because of the deprecated addressing modes. Most applications under active development have since been rewritten. Static code analysis to detect -only sequences can be undertaken using &quot;ARMalyser&quot;. Its output can be helpful in making 32-bit versions of older applications for which the source code is unavailable. Some older 26-bit software can be run without modification using the Aemulor emulator.

Additional incompatibilities were introduced with newer ARM cores, such as ARMv7 in the BeagleBoard and ARMv8 in the . This includes changes to unaligned memory access in ARMv6/v7 and removal of the SWP instructions in ARMv8.

== Supported hardware ==
RISC OS has also been used by both Acorn and Pace Micro Technology in various TV connected set-top boxes, sometimes referred to instead as NCOS. A special cut down RISC OS Pico (for 16MiB cards and larger) styled to start up like a BBC Micro was released for BASIC&#x27;s 50th anniversary. SD card images have been released for downloading free of charge to Raspberry Pi 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4 users with a full graphical user interface (GUI) version and a command-line interface only version (RISC OS Pico, at 3.8 MB).

Versions of RISC OS run or have run on the following hardware: (RISC OS Open Limited adopted the &#x27;even numbers are stable&#x27; version numbering scheme post version 5.14, hence some table entries above include two latest releases – the last stable one and the more recent development one.)
RISC OS can also run on a range of computer system emulators that emulate the earlier Acorn machines listed above:

<doc id="168006" wikidata="Q19825" url="?curid=168006" title="Cecil Rhodes">
<text>Cecil John Rhodes ( ; 5 July 185326 March 1902) was an English mining magnate and politician in southern Africa who served as Prime Minister of the Cape Colony from 1890 to 1896. He and his British South Africa Company founded the southern African territory of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe and Zambia), which the company named after him in 1895. He also devoted much effort to realising his vision of a Cape to Cairo Railway through British territory. Rhodes set up the Rhodes Scholarship, which is funded by his estate. 

The son of a vicar, Rhodes was born at Netteswell House, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Hertfordshire. A sickly child, he was sent to South Africa by his family when he was 17 years old in the hope that the climate might improve his health. He entered the diamond trade at Kimberley in 1871, when he was 18, and with funding from Rothschild &amp; Co, began to systematically buy out and consolidate diamond mines. Over the next two decades he gained a near-complete monopoly of the world diamond market. His diamond company De Beers, formed in 1888, retains its prominence into the 21st century.

Rhodes entered the Cape Parliament at the age of 27 in 1881, and in 1890, he became prime minister. During his time as prime minister, Rhodes used his political power to expropriate land from black Africans through the Glen Grey Act, while also tripling the wealth requirement for voting under the Franchise and Ballot Act, effectively barring black people from taking part in elections. After overseeing the formation of Rhodesia during the early 1890s, he was forced to resign in 1896 after the disastrous Jameson Raid, an unauthorised attack on Paul Kruger&#x27;s South African Republic (or Transvaal). Rhodes&#x27;s career never recovered; his heart was weak, and after years of ill health he died in 1902. At his request he was buried at Malindidzimu in what is now Zimbabwe; his grave has been a controversial site.

In his last will, he provided for the establishment of the international Rhodes Scholarship at University of Oxford, the oldest graduate scholarship in the world. Every year it grants 102 full postgraduate scholarships. It has benefited prime ministers of Malta, Australia, and Canada, United States President Bill Clinton, and many others.

With the strengthening of international movements against racism, such as Rhodes Must Fall, Rhodes&#x27; legacy is a matter of debate to this day. Critics cite his confiscation of land from the black indigenous population of the Cape Colony, and false claims that southern African archeological sites such as Great Zimbabwe were built by European civilisations. 

==Origins==
Rhodes was born in 1853 in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Hertfordshire, England, the fifth son of the Reverend Francis William Rhodes (1807–1878) and his wife, Louisa Peacock. Francis was a Church of England clergyman who served as perpetual curate of Brentwood, Essex (1834–1843), and then as vicar of nearby Bishop&#x27;s Stortford (1849–1876), where he was well known for never having preached a sermon longer than ten minutes.

Francis was the eldest son of William Rhodes (1774–1855), a brick manufacturer from Hackney, Middlesex. The family owned significant estates in London&#x27;s Hackney and Dalston which Cecil would later inherit.

The earliest traceable direct ancestor of Cecil Rhodes is James Rhodes (fl. 1660) of Snape Green, Whitmore, Staffordshire. Cecil&#x27;s siblings included Frank Rhodes, a British Army officer.

== Childhood ==
=== England and Jersey ===
Rhodes attended the Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Grammar School from the age of nine, but, as a sickly, asthmatic adolescent, he was taken out of grammar school in 1869 and, according to Basil Williams, &quot;continued his studies under his father&#x27;s eye ...&quot;

At age seven, he was recorded in the 1861 census as boarding with his aunt, Sophia Peacock, at a boarding house in Jersey, where the climate was perceived to provide a respite for those with conditions such as asthma. His health was weak and there were fears that he might be consumptive (have tuberculosis), a disease of which several of the family showed symptoms. His father decided to send him abroad for what were believed the good effects of a sea voyage and a better climate in South Africa.

=== South Africa ===

When he arrived in Africa, Rhodes lived on money lent by his aunt Sophia. After a brief stay with the Surveyor-General of Natal, P.C. Sutherland, in Pietermaritzburg, Rhodes took an interest in agriculture. He joined his brother Herbert on his cotton farm in the Umkomazi valley in Natal. The land was unsuitable for cotton, and the venture failed.

In October 1871, 18-year-old Rhodes and his 26-year-old brother Herbert left the colony for the diamond fields of Kimberley in Northern Cape Province. Financed by N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, Rhodes succeeded over the next 17 years in buying up all the smaller diamond mining operations in the Kimberley area.

His monopoly of the world&#x27;s diamond supply was sealed in 1890 through a strategic partnership with the London-based Diamond Syndicate. They agreed to control world supply to maintain high prices. Rhodes supervised the working of his brother&#x27;s claim and speculated on his behalf. Among his associates in the early days were John X. Merriman and Charles Rudd. Rudd later became his partner in the De Beers Mining Company and the Niger Oil Company.

During the 1880s, Cape vineyards had been devastated by a phylloxera epidemic. The diseased vineyards were dug up and replanted, and farmers were looking for alternatives to wine. In 1892, Rhodes financed The Pioneer Fruit Growing Company at Nooitgedacht, a venture created by Harry Pickstone, an Englishman who had experience with fruit-growing in California. The shipping magnate Percy Molteno had just undertaken the first successful refrigerated export to Europe. In 1896, after consulting with Molteno, Rhodes began to pay more attention to export fruit farming and bought farms in Groot Drakenstein, Wellington and Stellenbosch. A year later, he bought Rhone and Boschendal and commissioned Sir Herbert Baker to build him a cottage there. The successful operation soon expanded into Rhodes Fruit Farms, and formed a cornerstone of the modern-day Cape fruit industry.

=== Education ===

In 1873, Rhodes left his farm field in the care of his business partner, Rudd, and sailed for England to study at university. He was admitted to Oriel College, Oxford, but stayed for only one term in 1874. He returned to South Africa and did not return for his second term at Oxford until 1876. He was greatly influenced by John Ruskin&#x27;s inaugural lecture at Oxford, which reinforced his own attachment to the cause of British imperialism.

Among his Oxford associates were James Rochfort Maguire, later a fellow of All Souls College and a director of the British South Africa Company, and Charles Metcalfe. Due to his university career, Rhodes admired the Oxford tutorial system. Eventually, he was inspired to develop his scholarship scheme: &quot;Wherever you turn your eye—except in science—an Oxford man is at the top of the tree&quot;.

While attending Oriel College, Rhodes became a Freemason in the Apollo University Lodge. Although initially he did not approve of the organisation, he continued to be a South African Freemason until his death in 1902. The shortcomings of the Freemasons, in his opinion, later caused him to envisage his own secret society with the goal of bringing the entire world under British rule.

== Diamonds and the establishment of De Beers ==

During his years at Oxford, Rhodes continued to prosper in Kimberley. Before his departure for Oxford, he and C.D. Rudd had moved from the Kimberley Mine to invest in the more costly claims of what was known as old De Beers (&quot;Vooruitzicht&quot;). It was named after Johannes Nicolaas de Beer and his brother, Diederik Arnoldus, who occupied the farm.

After purchasing the land in 1839 from David Danser, a Koranna chief in the area, David Stephanus Fourie, forebear of Claudine Fourie-Grosvenor, had allowed the de Beers and various other Afrikaner families to cultivate the land. The region extended from the Modder River via the Vet River up to the Vaal River.

In 1874 and 1875, the diamond fields were in the grip of depression, but Rhodes and Rudd were among those who stayed to consolidate their interests. They believed that diamonds would be numerous in the hard blue ground that had been exposed after the softer, yellow layer near the surface had been worked out. During this time, the technical problem of clearing out the water that was flooding the mines became serious. Rhodes and Rudd obtained the contract for pumping water out of the three main mines. After Rhodes returned from his first term at Oxford, he lived with Robert Dundas Graham, who later became a mining partner with Rudd and Rhodes.

On 13 March 1888, Rhodes and Rudd launched De Beers Consolidated Mines after the amalgamation of a number of individual claims. With £200,000 of capital, the company, of which Rhodes was secretary, owned the largest interest in the mine (£200,000 in 1880 = £22.5m in 2020 = $28.5m USD). Rhodes was named the chairman of De Beers at the company&#x27;s founding in 1888. De Beers was established with funding from N.M. Rothschild &amp; Sons in 1887.

== Politics in South Africa ==
In 1880, Rhodes prepared to enter public life at the Cape. With the earlier incorporation of Griqualand West into the Cape Colony under the Molteno Ministry in 1877, the area had obtained six seats in the Cape House of Assembly. Rhodes chose the rural and predominately Boer constituency of Barkly West, which would remain loyal to Rhodes until his death.

When Rhodes became a member of the Cape Parliament, the chief goal of the assembly was to help decide the future of Basutoland. The ministry of Sir Gordon Sprigg was trying to restore order after the 1880 rebellion known as the Gun War. The Sprigg ministry had precipitated the revolt by applying its policy of disarming all native Africans to those of the Basotho nation, who resisted.

In 1890, Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony. He introduced various Acts of Parliament to push black people from their lands and make way for industrial development. Rhodes&#x27;s view was that black people needed to be driven off their land to &quot;stimulate them to labour&quot; and to change their habits. &quot;It must be brought home to them&quot;, Rhodes said, &quot;that in future nine-tenths of them will have to spend their lives in manual labour, and the sooner that is brought home to them the better.&quot;

In 1892, Rhodes&#x27;s Franchise and Ballot Act raised the property requirements from a relatively low £25 to a significantly higher £75 which had a disproportionate effect on the previously growing number of enfranchised black people in the Cape under the Cape Qualified Franchise that had been in force since 1853. By limiting the amount of land which black Africans were legally allowed to hold in the Glen Grey Act of 1894, Rhodes further disenfranchised the black population. To quote Richard Dowden, most would now &quot;find it almost impossible to get back on the list because of the legal limit on the amount of land they could hold&quot;. In addition, Rhodes was an early architect of the Natives Land Act, 1913, which would limit the areas of the country where black Africans were allowed to settle to less than 10%. At the time, Rhodes would argue that &quot;the native is to be treated as a child and denied the franchise. We must adopt a system of despotism, such as works in India, in our relations with the barbarism of South Africa.&quot;

Rhodes also introduced educational reform to the area. His policies were instrumental in the development of British imperial policies in South Africa, such as the Hut tax.Rhodes did not, however, have direct political power over the independent Boer Republic of the Transvaal. He often disagreed with the Transvaal government&#x27;s policies, which he considered unsupportive of mine-owners&#x27; interests. In 1895, believing he could use his influence to overthrow the Boer government, Rhodes supported the Jameson Raid, an unsuccessful attempt to create an uprising in the Transvaal that had the tacit approval of Secretary of State for the Colonies Joseph Chamberlain. The raid was a catastrophic failure. It forced Cecil Rhodes to resign as Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, sent his oldest brother Col. Frank Rhodes to jail in Transvaal convicted of high treason and nearly sentenced to death, and contributed to the outbreak of the Second Boer War.

In 1899, Rhodes was sued by a man named Burrows for falsely representing the purpose of the raid and thereby convincing him to participate in the raid. Burrows was severely wounded and had to have his leg amputated. His suit for £3,000 in damages was successful.

== Expanding the British Empire ==

=== Rhodes and the Imperial Factor ===
Rhodes used his wealth and that of his business partner Alfred Beit and other investors to pursue his dream of creating a British Empire in new territories to the north by obtaining mineral concessions from the most powerful indigenous chiefs. Rhodes&#x27; competitive advantage over other mineral prospecting companies was his combination of wealth and astute political instincts, also called the &quot;imperial factor,&quot; as he often collaborated with the British Government. He befriended its local representatives, the British Commissioners, and through them organized British protectorates over the mineral concession areas via separate but related treaties. In this way he obtained both legality and security for mining operations. He could then attract more investors. Imperial expansion and capital investment went hand in hand.

The imperial factor was a double-edged sword: Rhodes did not want the bureaucrats of the Colonial Office in London to interfere in the Empire in Africa. He wanted British settlers and local politicians and governors to run it. This put him on a collision course with many in Britain, as well as with British missionaries, who favoured what they saw as the more ethical direct rule from London. Rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of South Africa against his future mining profits. The Colonial Office did not have enough funding for this. Rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of Britain: preventing the Portuguese, the Germans or the Boers from moving into south-central Africa. Rhodes&#x27;s companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions, as exemplified by the Rudd and Lochner Concessions.

=== Treaties, concessions and charters ===

Rhodes had already tried and failed to get a mining concession from Lobengula, King of the Ndebele of Matabeleland. In 1888 he tried again. He sent John Smith Moffat, son of the missionary Robert Moffat, who was trusted by Lobengula, to persuade the latter to sign a treaty of friendship with Britain, and to look favourably on Rhodes&#x27;s proposals. His associate Charles Rudd, together with Francis Thompson and Rochfort Maguire, assured Lobengula that no more than ten white men would mine in Matabeleland. This limitation was left out of the document, known as the Rudd Concession, which Lobengula signed. Furthermore, it stated that the mining companies could do anything necessary to their operations. When Lobengula discovered later the true effects of the concession, he tried to renounce it, but the British Government ignored him.

During the company&#x27;s early days, Rhodes and his associates set themselves up to make millions (hundreds of millions in current pounds) over the coming years through what has been described as a &quot;&quot;suppressio veri&quot; ... which must be regarded as one of Rhodes&#x27;s least creditable actions&quot;. Contrary to what the British government and the public had been allowed to think, the Rudd Concession was not vested in the British South Africa Company, but in a short-lived ancillary concern of Rhodes, Rudd and a few others called the &quot;Central Search Association&quot;, which was quietly formed in London in 1889. This entity renamed itself the &quot;United Concessions Company&quot; in 1890, and soon after sold the Rudd Concession to the Chartered Company for 1,000,000 shares. When Colonial Office functionaries discovered this chicanery in 1891, they advised Secretary of State for the Colonies Viscount Knutsford to consider revoking the concession, but no action was taken.

Armed with the Rudd Concession, in 1889 Rhodes obtained a charter from the British Government for his British South Africa Company (BSAC) to rule, police, and make new treaties and concessions from the Limpopo River to the great lakes of Central Africa. He obtained further concessions and treaties north of the Zambezi, such as those in Barotseland (the Lochner Concession with King Lewanika in 1890, which was similar to the Rudd Concession); and in the Lake Mweru area (Alfred Sharpe&#x27;s 1890 Kazembe concession). Rhodes also sent Sharpe to get a concession over mineral-rich Katanga, but met his match in ruthlessness: when Sharpe was rebuffed by its ruler Msiri, King Leopold II of Belgium obtained a concession over Msiri&#x27;s dead body for his Congo Free State.

Rhodes also wanted Bechuanaland Protectorate incorporated in the BSAC charter. But three Tswana kings, including Khama III, travelled to Britain and won over British public opinion for it to remain governed by the British Colonial Office in London. Rhodes commented: &quot;It is humiliating to be utterly beaten by these niggers.&quot;

The British Colonial Office also decided to administer British Central Africa owing to the activism of David Livingstone trying to end the East African Arab-Swahili slave trade. Rhodes paid much of the cost so that the British Central Africa Commissioner Sir Harry Johnston, and his successor Alfred Sharpe, would assist with security for Rhodes in the BSAC&#x27;s north-eastern territories. Johnston shared Rhodes&#x27;s expansionist views, but he and his successors were not as pro-settler as Rhodes, and disagreed on dealings with Africans.

=== Rhodesia ===
The BSAC had its own police force, the British South Africa Police, which was used to control Matabeleland and Mashonaland, in present-day Zimbabwe. The company had hoped to start a &quot;new Rand&quot; from the ancient gold mines of the Shona. Because gold deposits weren&#x27;t as plentiful as they had hoped, many of the white settlers who accompanied the BSAC to Mashonaland became farmers rather than miners. White settlers and their locally-employed Native Police engaged in widespread indiscriminate rape of Ndebele women in the early 1890s.

The Ndebele and the Shona—the two main, but rival, peoples—took advantage of the absence of most of the BSAP for the Jameson Raid in January 1896; they separately rebelled against the coming of the European settlers, and the BSAC defeated them in the Second Matabele War. Rhodes went to Matabeleland after his resignation as Cape Colony Premier, and appointed himself Colonel in his own column of irregular troops moving from Salisbury to Bulawayo to relieve the siege of whites there. He remained Managing Director of the BSAC (with power of attorney to take decisions without reference back to the Board in London) until June 1896, defying Chamberlain&#x27;s calls to resign, and he gave instructions that no mercy be shown in putting down the rebellion, telling officers that &quot;Your instructions are&quot; he told a major, to &quot;do the most harm you can to the natives around you.&quot; He ordered a police officer to &quot;kill all you can&quot;, even those Ndebele who begged for mercy and threw down their arms. Shortly after learning of the assassination of the Ndebele spiritual leader, Mlimo, by the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, and after participating in the cavalry charge at one of the last pitched battles of this phase of the war, Rhodes&#x27; associate Johan Colenbrander arranged for a meeting with the remaining Ndebele chiefs. Rhodes and a few colleagues walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills. In a series of meetings between August and October, he persuaded the Impi to lay down their arms, thus ending the Second Matabele War.

In the aftermath of the war in Matabeleland, but whilst the uprising in Mashonaland was being suppressed, Rhodes returned to London to give evidence to the UK House of Commons Select Committee of Enquiry into the Jameson Raid. As Rhodes had incriminating telegrams demonstrating the complicity and foreknowledge of the Raid by Joseph Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary, he and his solicitor were able to blackmail Chamberlain into retaining the BSAC Charter, leaving the Company in charge of administering the territory north of the Limpopo even as it became a Crown colony. Rhodes returned to Mashonaland, further overseeing the suppression of the uprising there into 1897. The scandal attached to his name did not prevent him rejoining the board of the BSAC in 1898. He remained an MP in the Cape Parliament and a Privy Councillor.

By the end of 1894, the territories over which the BSAC had concessions or treaties, collectively called &quot;Zambesia&quot; after the Zambezi River flowing through the middle, comprised an area of 1,143,000 km2 between the Limpopo River and Lake Tanganyika. In May 1895, its name was officially changed to &quot;Rhodesia&quot;, reflecting Rhodes&#x27;s popularity among settlers who had been using the name informally since 1891. The designation Southern Rhodesia was officially adopted in 1898 for the part south of the Zambezi, which later became Zimbabwe; and the designations North-Western and North-Eastern Rhodesia were used from 1895 for the territory which later became Northern Rhodesia, then Zambia. He built a house for himself in 1897 in Bulawayo.
Rhodes decreed in his will that he was to be buried in Matopos Hills (now Matobo Hills). After his death in the Cape in 1902, his body was transported by train to Bulawayo. His burial was attended by Ndebele chiefs, now paid agents of the BSAC administration, who asked that the firing party should not discharge their rifles as this would disturb the spirits. Then, for the first time, they gave a white man the Matabele royal salute, Bayete. Rhodes is buried alongside Leander Starr Jameson and 34 British soldiers killed in the Shangani Patrol. Despite occasional efforts to return his body to the United Kingdom, his grave remains there still, &quot;part and parcel of the history of Zimbabwe&quot; and attracts thousands of visitors each year.

=== &quot;Cape to Cairo Red Line&quot; ===

One of Rhodes&#x27;s dreams was for a &quot;red line&quot; on the map from the Cape to Cairo (on geo-political maps, British dominions were always denoted in red or pink). Rhodes had been instrumental in securing southern African states for the Empire. He and others felt the best way to &quot;unify the possessions, facilitate governance, enable the military to move quickly to hot spots or conduct war, help settlement, and foster trade&quot; would be to build the &quot;Cape to Cairo Railway&quot;.

This enterprise was not without its problems. France had a conflicting strategy in the late 1890s to link its colonies from west to east across the continent and the Portuguese produced the &quot;Pink Map&quot;, representing their claims to sovereignty in Africa. Ultimately, Belgium and Germany proved to be the main obstacles to the British objective until the United Kingdom conquered and seized Tanganyika from the Germans as a League of Nations mandate in World War I.

== Political views ==
Rhodes wanted to expand the British Empire because he believed that the Anglo-Saxon race was destined to greatness. In what he described as &quot;a draft of some of my ideas&quot; written in 1877 while a student at Oxford, Rhodes said of the English, &quot;I contend that we are the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race. I contend that every acre added to our territory means the birth of more of the English race who otherwise would not be brought into existence.&quot; Rhodes bemoaned that there was little land left to conquer and said &quot;to think of these stars that you see overhead at night, these vast worlds which we can never reach. I would annex the planets if I could; I often think of that. It makes me sad to see them so clear and yet so far&quot;.

Furthermore Rhodes saw imperialism as a way to alleviate domestic social problems - &quot;In order to save the 40,000,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom from a bloody civil war, we colonial statesmen must acquire new lands to settle the surplus population, to provide new markets for the goods produced in the factories and mines. The Empire, as I have always said, is a bread and butter question. If you want to avoid civil war, you must become imperialists&quot;.

Rhodes wanted to develop a Commonwealth in which all of the British-dominated countries in the empire would be represented in the British Parliament. Rhodes explicitly stipulated in his will that all races should be eligible for the scholarships. It is said that he wanted to develop an American elite of philosopher-kings who would have the United States rejoin the British Empire. As Rhodes also respected and admired the Germans and their Kaiser, he allowed German students to be included in the Rhodes scholarships. He believed that eventually the United Kingdom (including Ireland), the US, and Germany together would dominate the world and ensure perpetual peace.

Rhodes&#x27;s views on race have been debated; he supported the rights of indigenous Africans to vote, but critics have labelled him as an &quot;architect of apartheid&quot; and a &quot;white supremacist&quot;, particularly since 2015. According to Magubane, Rhodes was &quot;unhappy that in many Cape Constituencies, Africans could be decisive if more of them exercised this right to vote under current law [referring to the Cape Qualified Franchise],&quot; with Rhodes arguing that &quot;the native is to be treated as a child and denied the franchise. We must adopt a system of despotism, such as works in India, in our relations with the barbarism of South Africa&quot;. Rhodes advocated the governance of indigenous Africans living in the Cape Colony &quot;in a state of barbarism and communal tenure&quot; as &quot;a subject race. I do not go so far as the member for Victoria West, who would not give the black man a vote. ... If the whites maintain their position as the supreme race, the day may come when we shall be thankful that we have the natives with us in their proper position.&quot; 

He once stated &quot;I prefer land to niggers&quot; and referred to the &#x27;Anglo-Saxon race&#x27; as &quot;the best, most human, most honourable race the world possesses&quot;. He thought that those lands which were occupied by the &quot;most despicable specimens of human beings&quot; should be inhabited by Anglo-Saxons.
However others have disputed these views. For example, historian Raymond C. Mensing notes that Rhodes has the reputation as the most flamboyant exemplar of the British imperial spirit, and always believed that British institutions were the best. Mensing argues that Rhodes quietly developed a more nuanced concept of imperial federation in Africa, and that his mature views were more balanced and realistic. According to Mensing, &quot;Rhodes was not a biological or maximal racist. Despite his support for what became the basis for the apartheid system, he is best seen as a cultural or minimal racist&quot;. In a 2016 opinion piece for &quot;The Times&quot;, Oxford University professor Nigel Biggar argued that although Rhodes was a committed imperialist, the charges of racism against him are unfounded. In a 2021 article, Biggar further argued that:

On domestic politics within Britain, Rhodes was a supporter of the Liberal Party. Rhodes&#x27; only major impact was his large-scale support of the Irish nationalist party, led by Charles Stewart Parnell (1846–1891).

Rhodes worked well with the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony; he supported teaching Dutch as well as English in public schools. While Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, he helped to remove most of their legal disabilities. He was a friend of Jan Hofmeyr, leader of the Afrikaner Bond, and it was largely because of Afrikaner support that he became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony. Rhodes advocated greater self-government for the Cape Colony, in line with his preference for the empire to be controlled by local settlers and politicians rather than by London.

Scholar and Zimbabwean author Peter Godwin, whilst critical of Rhodes, writes that he needs to be viewed via the prisms and cultural and social perspective of his epoch, positing that Rhodes &quot;was no 19th-century Hitler. He wasn&#x27;t so much a freak as a man of his time...Rhodes and the white pioneers in southern Africa did behave despicably by today&#x27;s standards, but no worse than the white settlers in North America, South America, and Australia; and in some senses better, considering that the genocide of natives in Africa was less complete. For all the former African colonies are now ruled by indigenous peoples, unlike the Americas and the Antipodes, most of whose aboriginal natives were all but exterminated.&quot;

Godwin goes on to say &quot;Rhodes and his cronies fit in perfectly with their surroundings and conformed to the morality (or lack of it) of the day. As is so often the case, history simply followed the gravitational pull of superior firepower.&quot;

== Personal relationships ==

=== Personal life ===
Rhodes never married, pleading, &quot;I have too much work on my hands&quot; and saying that he would not be a dutiful husband. According to his personal banker, Lewis Mitchell, Rhodes &quot;took, on occasions, a singularly human interest in the welfare of young men, and read their characters with discernment... Once, when twitted [teased] with his preference for young men, he retorted, &#x27;Of course, of course, they must soon take up our work; we must teach them what to do and what to avoid.&#x27;&quot; According to his secretary, Philip Jourdan, he &quot;seemed to have a liking for young men&quot; and was &quot;particularly partial to people with blue eyes.&quot; Graham Bower, the deputy to Sir Hercules Robinson, described the relationship between Rhodes and his private secretary Neville Pickering as &quot;an absolutely lover-like friendship.&quot;

Rhodes&#x27; biographers have been divided on the question of his sexuality. John Gilbert Lockhart and C.M. Woodhouse denied that Rhodes was homosexual, while Stuart Cloete and Antony Thomas took the view that he was asexual. Robert I. Rotberg and Brian Roberts have asserted that he was homosexual. According to Rotberg, that Rhodes was homosexual is &quot;indisputable on the basis of the available evidence.&quot; The BBC&#x27;s biographical drama series &quot;Rhodes&quot; (1996), written by Antony Thomas, treated him as gay. Robin Brown has claimed in &quot;The Secret Society: Cecil John Rhodes’s Plan for a New World Order&quot; that Rhodes was homosexual who was in love with Neville Pickering, and that he established &quot;… a homosexual hegemony—which was already operative in the Secret Society—[and] went on to influence, if not control, British politics at the beginning of the twentieth century&quot;. Paul Maylam of Rhodes University criticised Brown&#x27;s book in a review for &quot;The Conversation&quot; as &quot;based heavily on surmise and assertion&quot; and lacking &quot;referenced source material to substantiate its claims&quot;, as well as being riddled with basic factual errors.

=== Princess Radziwiłł ===
In the last years of his life, Rhodes was stalked by Polish princess Catherine Radziwiłł, born Rzewuska, who had married into the noble Polish family Radziwiłł. The princess falsely claimed that she was engaged to Rhodes, and that they were having an affair. She asked him to marry her, but Rhodes refused. In reaction, she accused him of loan fraud. He had to go to trial and testify against her accusation. She wrote a biography of Rhodes called &quot;Cecil Rhodes: Man and Empire Maker&quot;. Her accusations were eventually proven to be false.

== Second Boer War ==
During the Second Boer War Rhodes went to Kimberley at the onset of the siege, in a calculated move to raise the political stakes on the government to dedicate resources to the defence of the city. The military felt he was more of a liability than an asset and found him intolerable. The officer commanding the garrison of Kimberley, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Kekewich, experienced serious personal difficulties with Rhodes because of the latter&#x27;s inability to co-operate.

Despite these differences, Rhodes&#x27; company was instrumental in the defence of the city, providing water and refrigeration facilities, constructing fortifications, and manufacturing an armoured train, shells and a one-off gun named Long Cecil.

Rhodes used his position and influence to lobby the British government to relieve the siege of Kimberley, claiming in the press that the situation in the city was desperate. The military wanted to assemble a large force to take the Boer cities of Bloemfontein and Pretoria, but they were compelled to change their plans and send three separate smaller forces to relieve the sieges of Kimberley, Mafeking and Ladysmith.

== Death ==

Although Rhodes remained a leading figure in the politics of southern Africa, especially during the Second Boer War, he was dogged by ill health throughout his relatively short life.

He was sent to Natal aged 16 because it was believed the climate might help problems with his heart. On returning to England in 1872, his health again deteriorated with heart and lung problems, to the extent that his doctor, Sir Morell Mackenzie, believed he would survive only six months. He returned to Kimberley where his health improved. From age 40 his heart condition returned with increasing severity until his death from heart failure in 1902, aged 48, at his seaside cottage in Muizenberg.

The government arranged an epic journey by train from the Cape to Rhodesia, with the funeral train stopping at every station to allow mourners to pay their respects. It was reported that at Kimberley, &quot;practically the entire population marched in procession past the funeral car&quot;. He was finally laid to rest at his request at Malindidzimu, a hilltop located approximately south of Bulawayo, in what was then Rhodesia. The site was of supreme importance to Shona traditional religion as the shrine of Mwari, with this action interpreted as a gesture of colonial triumph and conquest over indigenous Africans. Today, his gravesite is part of Matobo National Park, Zimbabwe.

==Legacy==

Rhodes has been the target of much recent criticism, with some historians attacking him as a ruthless imperialist and white supremacist. The continued presence of his grave in the Matopos (now Matobo) hills has not been without controversy in contemporary Zimbabwe. In December 2010, Cain Mathema, the governor of Bulawayo, branded the grave outside the country&#x27;s second city an &quot;insult to the African ancestors&quot; and said he believed its presence had brought bad luck and poor weather to the region.

In February 2012, Mugabe loyalists and ZANU-PF activists visited the grave site demanding permission from the local chief to exhume Rhodes&#x27;s remains and return them to Britain. Many considered this a nationalist political stunt in the run up to an election, and Local Chief Masuku and Godfrey Mahachi, one of the country&#x27;s foremost archaeologists, strongly expressed their opposition to the grave being removed due to its historical significance to Zimbabwe. Then-president Robert Mugabe also opposed the move. 
In 2004, Rhodes was voted 56th in the SABC 3 television series &quot;Great South Africans&quot;. A preparatory school in the Midlands town of Gweru in Zimbabwe is named after him. In the early 2000s during the height of the land reform and racial tensions, ZANU-PF politicians called for a change in all the country&#x27;s school names with colonial ties, however, efforts were mostly fruitless as most people felt that it was unnecessary and names of places they live in reflect the diverse identity and cultural heritage of the country but called for the government to embrace the history of the country and allow room for new names for new places in the ever-growing towns and cities.

In his second will, written in 1877 before he had accumulated his wealth, Rhodes wanted to create a secret society that would bring the whole world under British rule. His biographer calls it an &quot;extensive fantasy.&quot; Rhodes envisioned a secret society to extend British rule worldwide, including China, Japan, all of Africa and South America, and indeed the United States as well:

Rhodes&#x27;s final will—when he actually did have money—was much more realistic and focused on scholarships. He also left a large area of land on the slopes of Table Mountain to the South African nation. Part of this estate became the upper campus of the University of Cape Town, another part became the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, while much was spared from development and is now an important conservation area. 

South Africa&#x27;s Rhodes University is named after him. 

=== Rhodes Scholarship ===
In his last will, he provided for the establishment of the Rhodes Scholarship. Over the course of the previous half-century, governments, universities and individuals in the settler colonies had been establishing travelling scholarships for this purpose. The Rhodes awards fit the established pattern. The scholarship enabled male students from territories under British rule or formerly under British rule and from Germany to study at Rhodes&#x27;s alma mater, the University of Oxford. Rhodes&#x27; aims were to promote leadership marked by public spirit and good character, and to &quot;render war impossible&quot; by promoting friendship between the great powers.

=== Memorials ===
Rhodes Memorial stands on Rhodes&#x27;s favourite spot on the slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak, Cape Town, with a view looking north and east towards the Cape to Cairo route. From 1910 to 1984 Rhodes&#x27;s house in Cape Town, Groote Schuur, was the official Cape residence of the prime ministers of South Africa and continued as a presidential residence.

His birthplace was established in 1938 as the Rhodes Memorial Museum, now known as Bishops Stortford Museum. The cottage in Muizenberg where he died is a provincial heritage site in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The cottage today is operated as a museum by the Muizenberg Historical Conservation Society, and is open to the public. A broad display of Rhodes material can be seen, including the original De Beers board room table around which diamonds worth billions of dollars were traded.

Rhodes University College, now Rhodes University, in Grahamstown, was established in his name by his trustees and founded by Act of Parliament on 31 May 1904.

The residents of Kimberley, Northern Cape elected to build a memorial in Rhodes&#x27;s honour in their city, which was unveiled in 1907. The 72-ton bronze statue depicts Rhodes on his horse, looking north with map in hand, and dressed as he was when he met the Ndebele after their rebellion.

The founder of the original country of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Cecil John Rhodes first visited Nyanga in the Eastern Highlands of the country in 1897. Captivated by the unspoilt and breathtaking beauty of the area, he immediately purchased a parcel of farms totalling 40,000 ha and then proceeded to import cattle from Mozambique and develop extensive plantations of apple and fruit trees. When he died in 1902, Rhodes bequeathed most of the estate to the nation, and this now forms the Nyanga National Park. Rhodes&#x27;s original farmhouse has been meticulously preserved and is now the Rhodes Nyanga Hotel. 

====Opposition====
Memorials to Rhodes have been opposed since at least the 1950s, when some Afrikaner students demanded the removal of a Rhodes statue at the University of Cape Town. A 2015 movement, known as &quot;Rhodes Must Fall&quot; (or #RhodesMustFall on social media), began with student protests at the University of Cape Town that were successful in getting university authorities to remove the Rhodes statue from the campus. The protest also had the broader goal of highlighting what the activists considered the lack of systemic post-apartheid racial transformation in South African institutions.

Following a series of protests and vandalism at the University of Cape Town, various movements both in South Africa and other countries have been launched in opposition to Cecil Rhodes memorials. These include a campaign to change the name of Rhodes University and to remove a statue of Rhodes from Oriel College, Oxford. The campaign was covered in a documentary by Channel 4, which was called &quot;The Battle for Britain&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. The documentary was commissioned after Afua Hirsch wrote an article on the topic. Moreover, an article by Amit Chaudhuri, in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, suggested the criticism was &quot;unsurprising and overdue&quot;. Other academics including Kehinde Andrews, prominent British academic and author specialising in Black studies, have vocally spoken in favour of #RhodesMustFall. However, Oriel College opted to keep the Rhodes statue, despite the protests. Oriel College claimed in 2016 they would lose about £100 million worth of gifts if they removed the statue. Nevertheless, in June 2020, the college voted in favour of setting up an independent commission of inquiry, amid widespread support for removing the statue.
A statue of Rhodes was erected in the city of Bulawayo in 1904 in the city centre. In 1981 after the country&#x27;s independence the statue was removed to the centenary park at the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe.

&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, discussing his legacy, wrote of Rhodes that he &quot;once defined his policy as &#x27;equal rights for every white man south of the Zambezi&#x27; and later, under liberal pressure, amended &#x27;white&#x27; to &#x27;civilized&#x27;. But he probably regarded the possibility of native Africans becoming &#x27;civilized&#x27; as so remote that the two expressions, in his mind, came to the same thing.&quot;

As part of his legacy, on his death Rhodes left a significant amount of money to be used to finance talented young scholars (&quot;race&quot; was not a criterion) at Oxford. Currently, in Oxford a number of those South African and Zimbabwean recipients of funds from his legacy are campaigning for his statue to be removed from display in Oxford. When asked if there was any double standard or hypocrisy in being funded by the Rhodes Scholarship fund and benefiting from the opportunity, whilst at the same time campaigning against the legacy of Rhodes, one of the South African campaigners, Ntokozo Qwabe, replied that &quot;this scholarship does not buy our silence...There is no hypocrisy in being a recipient of a Rhodes scholarship and being publicly critical of Cecil Rhodes and his legacy... There is no clause that binds us to find &#x27;the good&#x27; in Rhodes’ character, nor to sanitise the imperialist, colonial agenda he propagated&quot;.

In June 2020, amid the wider context of Black Lives Matter protests, the governing body of Oxford&#x27;s Oriel College voted to remove the statue of Rhodes located on the college&#x27;s façade facing Oxford&#x27;s High Street. The actual removal was not to take place until at least early spring 2021, when a commission set up by the college delivered its report on the future of the statue. In May 2021, the commission reported that, while the majority of members supported the statue&#x27;s removal, the costs to do so were prohibitively high, and the college would therefore not be taking action.

* Mark Twain&#x27;s sarcastic summation of Rhodes (&quot;I admire him, I frankly confess it; and when his time comes I shall buy a piece of the rope for a keepsake&quot;), from Chapter LXIX of &quot;Following the Equator&quot;, still often appears in collections of famous insults.
* He is depicted, along with other Cape notables, in the 1899 artwork Holiday Time in Cape Town by James Ford&quot;.&quot;
* The will of Cecil Rhodes is the central theme in the science fiction book &quot;Great Work of Time&quot; by John Crowley, an alternative history in which the Secret Society stipulated in the will was indeed established. Its members eventually achieve the secret of time travel and use it to restrain World War I and prevent World War II, and to perpetuate the world ascendancy of the British Empire up to the end of the twentieth century. The book contains a vivid description of Cecil Rhodes himself, seen through the eyes of a traveller from the future British Empire.
* In the British film &quot;Rhodes of Africa&quot; (1936, directed by Austrian filmmaker Berthold Viertel), Rhodes was portrayed by Canadian actor Walter Huston.
*Rhodes is the unofficial mascot of Uncomfortable Oxford, an Oxford-based tour guide and history organisation which focuses on British imperial history. Much of their promotional material, tours and speeches all focus on Rhodes&#x27;s statue outside of Oriel College, Oxford, and they were central to organising the 2020 Oxford Black Lives Matter protests following the murder of George Floyd.
* Rhodes was played by Ferdinand Marian in the Nazi film &quot;Ohm Krüger&quot; (1941), where he—like all other British characters in the film—was presented as an outright villain.
* In 1901, Rhodes bought Dalham Hall, Suffolk. In 1902, Colonel Frank Rhodes erected the village hall in the village of Dalham, near Bury St Edmunds, to commemorate the life of his brother, who had died before taking possession of the estate.
* Rhodes was a peripheral but influential character in the historical novel &quot;The Covenant&quot; by James Michener.
* His memorial at Devil&#x27;s Peak also served as a temple in &quot;The Adventures of Sinbad&quot; episode &quot;The Return of the Ronin&quot;.
* The 1976 Hugh Masekela album &quot;Colonial Man&quot; has a song titled &quot;Cecil Rhodes&quot;.
* Cecil Rhodes was the subject of a South African television mini-series, &quot;Barney Barnato&quot;, made in 1989 and first aired on SABC in early 1990.
* In 1996, BBC-TV made an eight-part television drama about Rhodes called &quot;Rhodes: The Life and Legend of Cecil Rhodes&quot;. It was produced by David Drury and written by Antony Thomas. It tells the story of Rhodes&#x27; life through a series of flashbacks of conversations between him and Princess Catherine Radziwiłł and also between her and people who knew him. It also shows the story of how she stalked and eventually ruined him. In the serial, Cecil Rhodes is played by Martin Shaw, the younger Cecil Rhodes is played by his son Joe Shaw, and Princess Radziwiłł is played by Frances Barber. In the serial Rhodes is portrayed as ruthless and greedy. The serial also suggests that he was homosexual. Countering the implication of Rhodes&#x27; homosexuality, historian and journalist Paul Johnson wrote that Rhodes had been falsely smeared by the programme, commenting: &quot;In nine tendentious hours, Rhodes is to be presented as a corrupt and greedy money-grabber, a racist and paedophile, whose disgusting passion was to get his hands on young boys ... the BBC has spent £10m of our money putting together a farrago of exaggerations and smears about this great man.&quot; Peter Godwin said of the film that &quot;it feels like a work overwhelmingly informed by malice, consistently seizing on the very worst interpretation of the man without really attempting to get under his skin. Rhodes was no 19th-century Hitler. He wasn&#x27;t so much a freak as a man of his time.&quot;
*Rhodes features prominently in Wilbur Smith&#x27;s &quot;Ballantyne&quot; series of novels, fictional stories based amongst real events in Rhodes&#x27; lifetime.
* Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard (&quot;b.&quot; 1911) believed himself to be the literal reincarnation of Cecil Rhodes.
* Season 4, Episode 1 of the Bad Gays Podcast covers Rhodes&#x27; life.

<text>Reading Football Club ( ) is a professional football club based in Reading, Berkshire, England. They compete in EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system. They play their home matches at the Select Car Leasing Stadium.

Reading are nicknamed &quot;The Royals&quot;, due to Reading&#x27;s location in the Royal County of Berkshire, though they were previously known as &quot;The Biscuitmen&quot;, due to the town&#x27;s association with biscuit maker Huntley &amp; Palmers. Established in 1871, the club is one of the oldest teams in England, but did not join The Football League until 1920, and first played in the top tier of English football league system in the 2006–07 season. The club competed in the 2012–13 Premier League season, having gained promotion at the end of the 2011–12 season after winning the Championship, but were relegated after just one season back in the top flight.

Reading won the 1987–88 Full Members&#x27; Cup and were one of only two Second Division clubs to lift the trophy, beating Luton Town 4–1 in the final at Wembley. The club&#x27;s best performance in the FA Cup was reaching the semi-finals which they achieved twice: in 1926–27 and 2014–15.

The club played at Elm Park for 102 years, from 1896 to 1998. In 1998, the club moved to the new Madejski Stadium, which was named after the club&#x27;s former chairman Sir John Madejski. In 2021, the club announced that the ground would be known as the Select Car Leasing Stadium for the subsequent decade for sponsorship reasons.

The club holds the record for the number of successive league wins at the start of a season, with a total of 13 wins at the start of the 1985–86 Third Division campaign and also the record for the highest number of points gained in a professional league season: 106 points in the 2005–06 Football League Championship campaign. Reading then achieved their highest finish of eighth in the 2006–07 Premier League, their first season as a top flight club.

==History==


===Formation and gradual rise (1871–1991)===
Reading were formed on 25 December 1871, following a public meeting at the Bridge Street Rooms organised by Joseph Edward Sydenham, who would go on to be club secretary. The early matches were played at Reading Recreation Ground, and later the club held fixtures at Reading Cricket Ground, Coley Park and Caversham Cricket Ground. The switch to professionalism in 1895 resulted in the need for a bigger ground and, to this end, the club moved again, to the purpose-built Elm Park on 5 September 1896. In 1913, Reading had a successful tour of Italy, prompting the leading sports newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; to write, &quot;Without doubt, Reading FC are the finest foreign team seen in Italy&quot;. Attilio Fresia moved to Reading as a result of the tour, becoming the first Italian to play in English football.
Reading were elected to the Football League Third Division South of the Football League in 1920. The club were promoted to the Second Division, following a Third Division South title win in 1926. Reading&#x27;s best performance in the FA Cup came in 1926–27 when they lost to eventual winners Cardiff City at Wolverhampton in the semi-final, a placement the club would not match again until 2015, when they lost to holders Arsenal in the semi-final. The attendance at the 1–0 victory over Brentford in the fifth round set a new attendance record for Elm Park, at 33,042 people. This remains the highest attendance at a Reading home match. Reading lost their place in Division Two in May 1931, and remained in Third Division South until the outbreak of World War II. The club won the Southern Section Cup, beating Bristol City in the two-legged final in 1938, and when taking part in the regional London War League and Cup competitions, gained another honour by beating Brentford in the London War Cup Final of 1941 by 3–2 at Stamford Bridge.

When League football resumed after the war, Reading quickly came to prominence once again. The club&#x27;s record victory, 10–2 versus Crystal Palace, was recorded in September 1946, and Reading twice finished runners-up in the Third (South), in 1948–49 and 1951–52, but they were denied a return to Division Two as only the champions were promoted. Reading were relegated to the fourth tier of English football for the first time in the 1971–72 season. A return to the Third Division was achieved, following a third-placed finish in 1975–76, but the club suffered immediate relegation. The 1978–79 season saw Reading win the Fourth Division to win promotion back to the Third Division.

Relegation was suffered in 1982–83. Towards the end of that season, Oxford United chairman Robert Maxwell announced that he had completed a deal to merge Oxford and Reading into a single club – Thames Valley Royals. Maxwell claimed that both clubs were on the verge of bankruptcy and having a united team was required for the Thames Valley region to retain a Football League club. The proposed amalgamation was prevented by the actions of Roy Tranter, a Reading director, and Roger Smee, a former Reading player. Smee disputed the legitimacy of the controlling interest in Reading held by the three board members that supported the merger plan. Tranter launched a legal challenge to the sale of certain shares on 22 April 1983. The supporters of the plan allies resigned under pressure from the rest of the Reading board in May 1983. At an extraordinary shareholders&#x27; meeting in July, Smee took over the club to end the amalgamation plans.

The side&#x27;s moment of cup glory came in 1988 when they won the Simod Cup, beating a number of top-flight sides en route to their Wembley win over Luton Town. Reading were promoted to the Second Division as champions in 1986 under the management of Ian Branfoot, but were relegated back to the Third Division in 1988.

===Onwards and upwards (1991–2005)=== 
The appointment of Mark McGhee as player-manager, shortly after the takeover by John Madejski, in 1991 saw Reading move forward. They were crowned champions of the new Division Two in 1994. Thirty-five-year-old striker Jimmy Quinn was put in charge of the first team alongside midfielder Mick Gooding and guided Reading to runners-up in the final Division One table – only to be denied automatic promotion because of the streamlining of the Premier League, from 22 teams to 20. In 1995, Reading had eased past Tranmere Rovers in the play-off semi-finals and looked to have booked their place in the Premier League only to lose 4–3 against Bolton Wanderers in the final having been 2–0 up and missed a penalty at half-time. Quinn and Gooding&#x27;s contracts were not renewed two years later after Reading had slid into the bottom half of Division One. Their successor, Terry Bullivant, lasted less than a season before being sacked in March 1998. Reading were relegated back to Division Two at the end of the 1997–98 season.
The year 1998 also saw Reading move into the new 24,200 all-seater Madejski Stadium, named after chairman John Madejski. Tommy Burns had taken over from Terry Bullivant but lasted just 18 months before being replaced by Alan Pardew, who had previously been reserve team manager before being released. The club finished third in 2000–01 qualifying for the play-offs, losing 2–3 in the final against Walsall at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Reading returned to Division One for 2002–03 after finishing runners-up in Division Two. The following season, they finished fourth in Division One and qualified for the play-offs, where they lost in the semi-final to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Pardew moved to West Ham United the following October and was replaced by Steve Coppell.

===Rise to the Premier League and yo-yo years (2005–2013)===
Reading won the 2005–06 Championship with a league record 106 points, scoring 99 goals and losing only twice. They were promoted to English football&#x27;s top division for the first time in their history. The 2006–07 season saw Reading make their first appearance in the top flight of English football. Reading defied pre-season predictions of relegation to finish the season in eighth place with 55 points. Reading turned down the chance to play in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. In the run up to their second season in the Premier League, Reading took part in the 2007 Peace Cup in South Korea. This second season was less successful, however, and Reading were relegated back to the Championship.

Reading started the 2008–09 season with a 15 match unbeaten home run. They finished fourth and qualify for the play-offs, where they lost to Burnley in the semi-final. Manager Steve Coppell resigned just hours after the game, replaced by Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009 and Brian McDermott made caretaker manager the same day. In the 2010–11 FA Cup, Reading reached the quarter-final, where they lost 1–0 to Manchester City at Etihad Stadium, Reading eventually finished fifth in the Championship to qualify for the division&#x27;s play-offs. After beating Cardiff City in the semi-finals, they lost 4–2 to Swansea City in the final at Wembley. In the 2011–12 season, a streak of good form in the second half of the season, ensured promotion back to the Premier League on 17 April 2012 with 1–0 home win against Nottingham Forest.

On 21 January 2012 it was reported that Madejski planned to relinquish control of the club by selling a 51% stake for £40 million to Thames Sports Investments, a Russian consortium headed by Anton Zingarevich. As part of the deal, Madejski would continue as chairman before becoming honorary life president. Madejski&#x27;s ownership of the club ended on 29 May 2012.

McDermott led Reading to their first Premier League win of the 2012–13 season on 17 November 2012 at their 11th attempt, defeating Everton 2–1 at home. On 11 March 2013, however, he left his position at Reading. Nigel Adkins was then appointed as manager, though he was unable to save them from relegation after drawing Queens Park Rangers 0–0 on 28 April 2013 at Loftus Road.

===Return to the Championship (2013–2023)===
The following season back in the Championship saw Reading make two high-profile signings in Wayne Bridge and Royston Drenthe in hope of an immediate return to the Premier League. Reading, however, missed out on the playoffs because of a last minute winner from Brighton &amp; Hove Albion&#x27;s Leonardo Ulloa, which meant the Seagulls made the playoffs at Reading&#x27;s expense.

The 2014–15 pre-season saw further arrivals of Jamie Mackie on loan, Oliver Norwood and the return of Simon Cox. The club was under a high threat of administration, causing departures of Sean Morrison and Adam Le Fondre and a Thai consortium taking over the club. A good start to Nigel Adkins&#x27; second season in charge was followed by a poor run of results that ended with his sacking after a 6–1 away defeat to Birmingham City with Steve Clarke taking over the next day in the hope of a promotion push. However, a lack of goals and some poor form in the league meant the club faced some fears of relegation to League One, but safety was secured with few games to spare. Nonetheless, during that time, the club embarked on a successful FA Cup journey, reaching the semi-final where they lost 2–1 to Arsenal at Wembley. The following season saw the club bring in many players in the hopes of gaining promotion, but the club finished 17th.

In the summer leading up to the 2016–17 season the club announced the departure of Brian McDermott and eventually he was to be replaced by former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam. Under Stam, Reading achieved their highest finish since relegation back to the Championship by finishing third and reaching the play-offs, where they beat Fulham on aggregate before facing Huddersfield Town in the final at Wembley where they lost on penalties following 0–0 draw after extra time. In 2017, Chinese investors Dai Yongge and Dai Xiu Li acquired the club.

The team languished towards the bottom of the table for most of the 2017–18 season. On 21 March 2018, Stam resigned as manager after a nine-game winless run. Two days later, on 23 March 2018, Paul Clement was appointed as Reading&#x27;s new manager; the club finished the season in 20th place, avoiding relegation by three points.

Clement was sacked on 6 December 2018 after poor results left the club outside of the relegation zone only on goal difference. He was replaced by José Gomes on 22 December, who steered the club away from relegation to finish 20th again. However, after a slow start to the 2019–20 season, Gomes was dismissed after less than a year in charge with the team in the relegation zone in October 2019. Sporting director Mark Bowen was promoted to the role as his replacement a week later and led the team to finish 14th before departing the club in August 2020.

Former Chicago Fire boss Veljko Paunović was appointed manager on 29 August 2020. The team got off to an excellent start to the 2020–21 season, winning seven of their first eight league games. However, the team&#x27;s form faded after injuries to several key players and they eventually narrowly missed out of the play-offs, finishing seventh.

On 17 November 2021 it was confirmed Reading would be deducted six points due to breaching the EFL&#x27;s profitability and sustainability rules. Over five years, the club reported pre-tax losses of £146m, way beyond the EFL&#x27;s limit of a £13m annual pre-tax loss. In 2021, the club spent 234% of its revenue on player wages.

Following a 3–2 away victory over Preston North End in February 2022, manager Veljko Paunović left by mutual consent, with Paul Ince being placed in interim charge of the team alongside academy manager Michael Gilkes. On 16 May, Ince became the team&#x27;s permanent manager, with Mark Bowen returning as head of football operations.

On 1 March 2023, the team was reported to be facing another six-point deduction for breaching profitability and sustainability rules. The club accepted the penalty on 4 April 2023, enforced with immediate effect. A week later, on 11 April, Ince left after a run of eight games without a win, leaving the club in 22nd place, one point from safety. Under-21 manager Noel Hunt was placed in interim charge until the end of the season. The club was relegated from the Championship on 4 May 2023 after 10 years in the second tier. Without the six point deduction, Reading would have finished on 50 points, escaping relegation.

=== League One struggles and club for sale (2023–present) ===
In June 2023, Reading were charged by the EFL with failing to pay their players on time and in full, in October and November 2022, and April 2023, and with non-payment of taxes - charges that meant Reading started their 2023–24 League One season with a points deduction. Following the EFL&#x27;s action, Reading fans groups united to launch a campaign, Sell Before We Dai, urging owner Dai Yongge to sell the club, calling his stewardship &quot;an unmitigated disaster&quot; and citing the club&#x27;s &quot;excruciating financial losses&quot;. On 28 July, the club was placed under another transfer embargo because of the unpaid taxes. On 2 August, Dai Yongge was reported to be seeking new investors to bring financial stability to the club.

Meanwhile, on 26 June 2023, Reading announced the provisional appointment of Rubén Sellés as their new manager, confirmed on 14 July, after his visa application was successful.

On 16 August 2023, after one win and two defeats in their opening three league fixtures, Reading had a point deducted (their third deduction in three consecutive seasons), and a further three-point deduction suspended, for its failures to pay players fully and on time during the 2022–23 season. Dai Yongge was ordered to pay 125% of the club&#x27;s forecast monthly wages into a designated account. Failure to comply, or not paying wages on time up to 30 June 2024, would activate the suspended penalty; the three-point deduction was applied on 13 September, and Dai Yongge faced a misconduct charge.

On 13 January 2024, Reading&#x27;s match against Port Vale was abandoned after home fans invaded the pitch to protest about Yongge&#x27;s ownership of the club.

On 27 February 2024, Reading received their second points deduction of the season, being docked two more points by the EFL after failing to make HMRC payments within an 80-day limit. The deduction left the club three points above the relegation places. At the end of April 2024, the club finished the League One season in 17th position. The ongoing financial difficulties caused the women&#x27;s team to withdraw from the Women&#x27;s Championship on 30 June. An attempted takeover by former Wycombe Wanderers owner Rob Couhig collapsed in September 2024, a bid by former Reading chairman Roger Smee ended in December 2024, and negotiations over another (unnamed) takeover bid expired in February 2025. In late February 2025, local MP Yuan Yang backed a supporters&#x27; group petition calling for an inquiry into the club&#x27;s governance since May 2012, while the club entered into exclusive talks with another potential buyer. 

==Crest and colours==


The first crest to appear on a Reading kit was in 1953, it featured just the letter &quot;R&quot;. There was no crest seen again until 1981 when there was a crest featuring three elm trees and the rivers Thames and Kennet; this only lasted two seasons. From 1987 to 1996 the crest used the new kit colours of yellow, sky blue, royal blue and white. A brief return to a design based on the 1981 crest was reintroduced for the 1996–97 and 1997–98 seasons. Commenting on the need for a new crest to coincide with the move to the Madejski Stadium, as well as moving into the new millennium, Sir John Madejski said: &quot;I know some traditionalists will say we should keep the old badge but they should bear in mind the need to move forward.&quot; The current crest was first seen on the kits for the 1998–99 season. It is based on the club colours—blue and white—and includes a crown to represent the Royal County of Berkshire and the Maiwand Lion to represent Reading.

The club&#x27;s home kit for the 2022–23 season saw University of Reading&#x27;s Ed Hawkins&#x27; stripe design included on the sleeves with the stripes representing the average temperature for a single year since Reading&#x27;s foundation to raise awareness for climate change, the shirt itself being made of recycled plastic bottles.

==Stadium==

The club played at Reading Recreation Ground until 1878, before moving on to Reading Cricket Ground (1878–1882), Coley Park (1882–1889) and Caversham Cricket Ground (1889–1896).
In 1889, Reading were unable to continue playing at Coley Park as W B Monck (the local squire) no longer allowed football due to &quot;rowdyism [by] the rougher elements&quot;. With club membership exceeding 300 by the time the club went professional in 1895, Reading required a proper ground. A meeting the following year determined that funding would be difficult. £20 was donated by J C Fidler, on the proviso that &quot;no liquors were to be sold&quot; on site. The rest of the cost was financed through donations by wealthy supporters, as well as one large individual donation. A former gravel pit in West Reading was identified as the site. The first game at Elm Park was held on 5 September 1896 between Reading and A Roston Bourke&#x27;s XI. The visitors were a scratch team from Holloway College. £44 was taken on the gate, with an attendance of approximately 2,500.

In 1908, the club&#x27;s annual general meeting proposed moving to a new ground near Reading railway station. A board meeting the following year decided that the move would not be possible, as &quot;there was no chance of a move to the ground near to the GWR railway stations due to the actions of the Great Western Railway&quot;.
In 1994, the Taylor Report made an all-seater stadium compulsory in the top two divisions (the Premier League and the first division). Reading were champions of the second division in 1994, and were promoted to the first division. Reading became subject to the Taylor requirements, though converting Elm Park to an all-seater stadium would have been impractical. Instead, a location in Smallmead (to the south of the town) was identified as the site for a new stadium. The former council landfill site was bought for £1, with further conditions that the development of the stadium would include part-funding of the A33 relief road. Expansion of the club&#x27;s home would also allow alternative commercial ventures (particularly leisure facilities) and shared use with other teams (such as rugby union clubs Richmond and London Irish). The last competitive match at Elm Park took place on 3 May 1998 against Norwich City, with Reading losing 1–0. Reading began the 1998–99 season at the Madejski Stadium. It was opened on 22 August 1998 when Luton Town were beaten 3–0. The stadium cost more than £50 million to build. For the first time in its history, Reading Football Club participated in the Premier League in the 2006–07 season. As a result of the sell-out crowds for their first few fixtures of the season, the club announced their intention, in October 2006, to make a planning application to extend the ground to between 37,000 and 38,000 seats. The application was made on 24 January 2007, proposing initially the extension of the East Stand with a further 6,000 seats (raising capacity to around 30,000) and subsequently extension of the North and South Stands to reach the full proposed capacity. On 24 May 2007, it was announced that planning permission had been granted to extend the stadium to a capacity of 36,900.

On 5 July 2016, at the end of Eamonn Dolan&#x27;s funeral, Reading announced that the North Stand would be renamed the Eamonn Dolan Stand.

During the 2019–20 season Reading moved to a new training ground at Bearwood Golf Club to replace Hogwood Park, their previous training facility. In March 2024, owner Dai Yongge agreed to sell the Bearwood Park training ground to Wycombe Wanderers, claiming it was necessary to fund the club&#x27;s short-term future while trying to sell the club.

In July 2021, at the beginning of the club&#x27;s 150th anniversary season, it was announced that the Madejski Stadium had been rebranded as the Select Car Leasing Stadium for the next ten years. In honour of Sir John Madejski, the East Stand was renamed as &quot;The Sir John Madejski Stand&quot;.

Since 2023, Graham Griffin has been acting as the Stadium Manager.

==Support==
In 1930, the Reading Football Supporters’ Club (RFSC) was formed to represent the interests of supporters of the club and to assist in raising funds for the football club. On 18 March 2002, the Supporters&#x27; Trust at Reading become the official successor to the RFSC.

In 2001, Reading became the first football club to register their fans as an official member of their squad, giving the &quot;player&quot; registered with squad number 13 as &#x27;Reading Fans&#x27;.

For the 2015–16 season, Reading had 12,983 season ticket holders – ranked 10th in the Championship and almost identical to former league champions Leeds United. The figure for that season was greater than the 12,552 recorded in the previous season, but down from the 2013–14 Championship peak of 14,547. The average attendance for the 2015–16 season was 17,570 – the 10th highest in the Championship.

===Rivalries===
Before going out of business in 1992, Aldershot were Reading&#x27;s biggest rivals. Aldershot were, geographically, the closest Football League club to Reading. There was a strong rift between the two sets of fans, with fighting between fans occurring on several occasions. Strong feelings remain between fans of Reading and fans of Aldershot Town, the refounded club in Aldershot. Aldershot Town were promoted into the Football League in 2008, but the clubs haven&#x27;t met in a competitive match since the demise of the original club. Aldershot were relegated out of the league in 2013, having entered administration, reducing the chances of a competitive meeting between the two sides in the near future.

Since Aldershot&#x27;s exile, Reading&#x27;s main local rivalries have been with Oxford United and Swindon Town. When the three teams had shared a division, their rivalry was referred to as the &quot;Didcot Triangle&quot;. 
However, the rivalry between Oxford and Swindon is stronger than between either of the two and Reading, largely due to them both spending their recent history in lower divisions than Reading, and spending their previous history in higher divisions than Reading. In 2012, a small survey showed that Reading&#x27;s main rivals were Aldershot Town, followed by Swindon Town and Oxford United.

==Sponsorship==
===Additional kit sponsors===
During the 2013–14 season and 2014–15 season the Marussia F1 logo was on the back of the shirts as part of a sponsorship deal between former Russian owner Anton Zingarevich and Russian owned Marussia F1. This deal continued until the team entered administration in October 2014. The sponsorship deal ended despite the team surviving and racing in the 2015 Formula One season. During the 2015–16 season, Waitrose was on the back of the home shirt whilst Euro Cake was on the back of the away shirt, meanwhile Legend Alliance sponsored the shorts for the season. Waitrose and Euro Cake sponsored the home and away kits respectively again for the 2016–17 season. Cherwell Software took sponsorship of the back of the home shirt for the 2017–18 season while Euro Cake sponsored the back of the away shirt again for the third consecutive season. Reading confirmed Singaporean international financial technology firm and digital wallet specialist Rapidz as its ‘Back of Shirt’ sponsor for 2020–23.

==Women&#x27;s team==

In May 2006, Reading launched the Reading FC Women&#x27;s team. They used to play in the FA Premier League Southern Division. From 2014, Reading FC Women played in the FA Women&#x27;s Super League 2 until they won promotion to the FA Women&#x27;s Super League 1 in 2015 after winning the league. In the 2017–18 season, they finished fourth in the Women&#x27;s Super League – their highest league position to date. The team currently plays at the Select Car Leasing Stadium. It was announced Reading FC Women would switch to operating on a part-time basis ahead of the 2023–24 season. On 30 June 2024, Reading FC Women withdrew from the Women&#x27;s Championship due to financial difficulties, dropping to Tier 5 of the women&#x27;s football pyramid.

<text>An orchard is an intentional plantation of trees or shrubs that is maintained for food production. Orchards comprise fruit- or nut-producing trees that are generally grown for commercial production. Orchards are also sometimes a feature of large gardens, where they serve an aesthetic as well as a productive purpose. A fruit garden is generally synonymous with an orchard, although it is set on a smaller, non-commercial scale and may emphasize berry shrubs in preference to fruit trees. Most temperate-zone orchards are laid out in a regular grid, with a grazed or mown grass or bare soil base that makes maintenance and fruit gathering easy.

Most modern commercial orchards are planted for a single variety of fruit. While the importance of introducing biodiversity is recognized in forest plantations, introducing genetic diversity in orchard plantations by interspersing other trees might offer benefits. Genetic diversity in an orchard would provide resilience to pests and diseases, just as in forests.

Orchards are sometimes concentrated near bodies of water where climatic extremes are moderated and blossom time is retarded until frost danger is past.

==Layout==
An orchard&#x27;s layout is the technique of planting the crops in a proper system.
There are different methods of planting and thus different layouts. Some of these layout types are:
* Square method
* Rectangular method
* Quincunx method
* Triangular method
* Hexagonal method
* Contour or terrace method

For different varieties, these systems may vary to some extent.

==Orchards by region==
The most extensive orchards in the United States are apple and orange orchards, although citrus orchards are more commonly called groves. The most extensive apple orchard area is in eastern Washington state, with a lesser but significant apple orchard area in most of Upstate New York. Extensive orange orchards are found in Florida and southern California. In eastern North America, many orchards are along the shores of Lake Michigan (such as the Fruit Ridge Region), Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario.

In Canada, apple and other fruit orchards are widespread on the Niagara Peninsula, south of Lake Ontario. This region is known as &quot;Canada Fruitbelt&quot; and, in addition to large-scale commercial fruit marketing, it encourages &quot;pick-your-own&quot; activities in the harvest season.

In Spain, Murcia is a major orchard area (or la huerta) in Europe, with citrus crops. New Zealand, China, Argentina, and Chile also have extensive apple orchards.

Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire has been called &quot;The Town in the Orchard&quot;, since the 19th century, because it was surrounded by extensive orchards. Today, this heritage is celebrated through an annual Applefest.

===Central Europe===
&quot;Streuobstwiese&quot; (pl. ) is a German word that means a meadow with scattered fruit trees or fruit trees that are planted in a field. , or a meadow orchard, is a traditional landscape in the temperate, maritime climate of continental Western Europe. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, were a kind of a rural community orchard that were intended for the productive cultivation of stone fruit. In recent years, ecologists have successfully lobbied for state subsidies to valuable habitats, biodiversity and natural landscapes, which are also used to preserve old meadow orchards. Both conventional and meadow orchards provide a suitable habitat for many animal species that live in a cultured landscape. A notable example is the hoopoe that nests in tree hollows of old fruit trees and, in the absence of alternative nesting sites, is threatened in many parts of Europe because of the destruction of old orchards.

==Historical orchards==
* Orchard House in Concord, Massachusetts, was the residence of American celebrated writer Louisa May Alcott.
* Fruita, Utah, part of Capitol Reef National Park has Mormon pioneer orchards maintained by the United States National Park Service.

==Modern orchards==
Historical orchards have large, mature trees spaced for heavy equipment. Modern commercial apple orchards, by contrast and as one example, are often &quot;high-density&quot; (tree density above ), and in extreme cases have up to . These plants are no longer trees in the traditional sense, but instead resemble vines on dwarf stock and require trellises to support them.
Now new &quot;Smart Orchards&quot; are being set up throughout the world. The first examples of such orchards are the Smart Orchard at Washington , United States of America by Innov8 and Washington State University and Samriti Bagh orchard created in Maraog, India by Tejasvi Dogra that incorporates the use of various sensors for orchard management.

==Orchard conservation in the UK==
* Natural England, through its Countryside Stewardship Scheme, Environmental Stewardship and Environmentally Sensitive Areas Scheme, gives grant aid and advice for the maintenance, enhancement or re-creation of historical orchards.
* The Orchard Link organisation provides advice on how to manage and restore the county of Devon&#x27;s orchards, as well as enabling the local community to use the local orchard produce. An organisation called Orchards Live carries out similar work in North Devon.
* People&#x27;s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES) has mapped every traditional orchard within England and Wales and manages the national inventory for this habitat.
* The UK Biodiversity Partnership lists traditional orchards and a priority UK Biodiversity Action Plan habitat.
* The Wiltshire Traditional Orchards Project maps, conserves and restores traditional orchards within Wiltshire, England.
* An interim report from the National Trust showed that orchards had reduced in scale from approximately 95,000 hectares in the period 1892–1914, to 41,000 hectares overall in 2022. The campaign #BlossomWatch is part of a wider programme of work by the Trust to plant 68 new orchards by 2025, and four million trees with blossom by 2030.

==Notable people==
* Belle van Dorn Harbert (born 1860), fruit farmer, founder of International Congress of Farm Women

<text>Morus, a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae, consists of 19 species of deciduous trees commonly known as mulberries, growing wild and under cultivation in many temperate world regions. Generally, the genus has 64 subordinate taxa, though the three most common are referred to as white, red, and black, originating from the color of their dormant buds and not necessarily the fruit color (&quot;Morus alba&quot;, &quot;M. rubra&quot;, and &quot;M. nigra&quot;, respectively), with numerous cultivars and some taxa currently unchecked and awaiting taxonomic scrutiny. &quot;M. alba&quot; is native to South Asia, but is widely distributed across Europe, Southern Africa, South America, and North America. &quot;M. alba&quot; is also the species most preferred by the silkworm, and is regarded as an invasive species in Brazil and the United States.

The closely related genus &quot;Broussonetia&quot; is also commonly known as mulberry, notably the paper mulberry (&quot;Broussonetia papyrifera&quot;).

Despite their similar appearance, mulberries are not closely related to raspberries or blackberries. All three species belong to the Rosales order. But while the mulberry is a tree belonging to the Moraceae family (also including the fig, jackfruit, and other fruits), raspberries and blackberries are brambles and belong to the Rosaceae family.

==Description==
Mulberries are fast-growing when young, and can grow to tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, and often lobed and serrated on the margin. Lobes are more common on juvenile shoots than on mature trees. The trees can be monoecious or dioecious.

The mulberry fruit is a multiple, about long. Immature fruits are white, green, or pale yellow. The fruit turns from pink to red while ripening, then dark purple or black, and has a sweet flavor when fully ripe.

==Taxonomy==

The taxonomy of &quot;Morus&quot; is complex and disputed. Fossils of &quot;Morus&quot; appear in the Pliocene record of the Netherlands. Over 150 species names have been published, and although differing sources may cite different selections of accepted names, less than 20 are accepted by the vast majority of botanical authorities. &quot;Morus&quot; classification is even further complicated by widespread hybridisation, wherein the hybrids are fertile.

The following species are accepted:

*&quot;Morus alba&quot; – white mulberry (China, Korea, Japan)
*&quot;Morus australis&quot; – East and South-East Asia
*&quot;Morus boninensis&quot; 
*&quot;Morus cathayana&quot; – China, Japan, Korea
*&quot;Morus celtidifolia&quot; – Texas mulberry (southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, South America) 
*&quot;Morus indica&quot; – India, Southeast Asia
*&quot;Morus koordersiana&quot; 
*&quot;Morus liboensis&quot; – Guizhou Province in China
*&quot;Morus macroura&quot; – long mulberry (Tibet, Himalayas, Indochina)
*&quot;Morus microphylla&quot; 
*&quot;Morus miyabeana&quot; 
*&quot;Morus mongolica&quot; 
*&quot;Morus nigra&quot; - black mulberry (Iran, Caucasus, Levant)
*&quot;Morus notabilis&quot; – Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces in China
*&quot;Morus rubra&quot; – red mulberry (eastern North America)
*&quot;Morus serrata&quot; – Tibet, Nepal, northwestern India
*&quot;Morus trilobata&quot; – Guizhou Province in China
*&quot;Morus wittiorum&quot; – southern China
==Distribution==

Black, red, and white mulberries are widespread in Southern Europe, the Middle East, Northern Africa, and the Indian subcontinent, where the tree and the fruit have names under regional dialects.

Black mulberry was imported to Britain in the 17th century in the hopes that it would be useful in the cultivation of silkworms. It was much used in folk medicine, especially in the treatment of tapeworms.

The United States has native red mulberries, as well as imported black and white mulberries. 

Mulberries are also widespread in Greece, particularly in the Peloponnese, which in the Middle Ages was known as Morea, deriving from the Greek word for the tree (, &quot;&quot;).

Australia has two types of native mulberries: Hedycarya angustifolia, and Pipturus argenteus, which are both from different families to Moraceae. However, imported black, red and white Morus mulberries are also commonly grown in Australian backyards.

== Cultivation ==
Mulberries can be grown from seed, and this is often advised, as seedling-grown trees are generally of better shape and health. Mulberry trees grown from seed can take up to ten years to bear fruit. Mulberries are most often planted from large cuttings, which root readily. The mulberry plants allowed to grow tall have a crown height of from ground level and a stem girth of . They are specially raised with the help of well-grown saplings 8–10 months old of any of the varieties recommended for rainfed areas like S-13 (for red loamy soil) or S-34 (black cotton soil), which are tolerant to drought or soil-moisture stress conditions. Usually, the plantation is raised and in block formation with a spacing of , or , as plant-to-plant and row-to-row distances. The plants are usually pruned once a year during the monsoon season to a height of and allowed to grow with a maximum of 8–10 shoots at the crown. The leaves are harvested three or four times a year by a leaf-picking method under rain-fed or semi-arid conditions, depending on the monsoon. The tree branches pruned during the fall season (after the leaves have fallen) are cut and are used to make durable baskets supporting agriculture and animal husbandry.

Some North American cities have banned the planting of mulberries because of the large amounts of pollen they produce, posing a potential health hazard for some pollen allergy sufferers. Actually, only the male mulberry trees produce pollen; this lightweight pollen can be inhaled deeply into the lungs, sometimes triggering asthma. Conversely, female mulberry trees produce all-female flowers, which draw pollen and dust from the air. Because of this pollen-absorbing feature, all-female mulberry trees have an OPALS allergy scale rating of just 1 (lowest level of allergy potential), and some consider it &quot;allergy-free&quot;.

Mulberry tree scion wood can easily be grafted onto other mulberry trees during the winter, when the tree is dormant. One common scenario is converting a problematic male mulberry tree to an allergy-free female tree, by grafting all-female mulberry tree scions to a male mulberry that has been pruned back to the trunk. However, any new growth from below the graft(s) must be removed, as they would be from the original male mulberry tree.

==Toxicity==
All parts of the plant besides the ripe fruit contain a toxic milky sap. Eating too many berries may have a laxative effect. Additionally, unripe green fruit may cause nausea, cramps, and a hallucinogenic effect.

== Uses ==

=== Nutrition ===
Raw mulberries are 88% water, 10% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and less than 1% fat. In a reference amount, raw mulberries provide 43 calories, 44% of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin C, and 14% of the DV for iron; other micronutrients are insignificant in quantity.

=== Culinary ===
As the fruit matures, mulberries change in texture and color, becoming succulent, plump, and juicy, resembling a blackberry. The color of the fruit does not distinguish the mulberry species, as mulberries may be white, lavender or black in color. White mulberry fruits are typically sweet, but not tart, while red mulberries are usually deep red, sweet, and juicy. Black mulberries are large and juicy, with balanced sweetness and tartness.

The fruit of the East Asian white mulberry – a species extensively naturalized in urban regions of eastern North America – has a different flavor, sometimes characterized as refreshing and a little tart, with a bit of gumminess to it and a hint of vanilla. In North America, the white mulberry is considered an invasive exotic and has taken over extensive tracts from native plant species, including the red mulberry.

Mulberries are used in pies, tarts, wines, cordials, and herbal teas. The fruit of the black mulberry (native to southwest Asia) and the red mulberry (native to eastern North America) have distinct flavors likened to &#x27;fireworks in the mouth&#x27;. Jams and sherbets are often made from the fruit in the Old World.

The tender twigs are semisweet and can be eaten raw or cooked.

=== Supplement ===
The fruit and leaves are sold in various forms as dietary supplements.

=== Silk industry ===
Mulberry leaves, particularly those of the white mulberry, are ecologically important as the sole food source of the silkworm (&quot;Bombyx mori&quot;, named after the mulberry genus &quot;Morus&quot;), the cocoon of which is used to make silk. The wild silk moth also eats mulberry. Other Lepidoptera larvae—which include the common emerald, lime hawk-moth, sycamore moth, and fall webworm—also eat the plant.

The Ancient Greeks and Romans cultivated the mulberry for silkworms; at least as early as 220 AD, Emperor Elagabalus wore a silk robe. English clergy wore silk vestments from about 1500 onwards. Mulberry and the silk industry played a role in colonial Virginia.

=== Pigment ===
Mulberry fruit color derives from anthocyanins, which have unknown effects in humans. Anthocyanins are responsible for the attractive colors of fresh plant foods, including orange, red, purple, black, and blue. These colors are water-soluble and easily extractable, yielding natural food colorants. Due to a growing demand for natural food colorants, they have numerous applications in the food industry.

A cheap and industrially feasible method has been developed to extract anthocyanins from mulberry fruit that could be used as a fabric dye or food colorant of high color value. Scientists found that, of 31 Chinese mulberry cultivars tested, the total anthocyanin yield varied from 148 to 2725 mg/L of fruit juice. Sugars, acids, and vitamins of the fruit remained intact in the residual juice after removal of the anthocyanins, indicating that the juice may be used for other food products.

Mulberry germplasm resources may be used for:
* exploration and collection of fruit yielding mulberry species
* their characterization, cataloging, and evaluation for anthocyanin content by using traditional, as well as modern, means and biotechnology tools
* developing an information system about these cultivars and varieties
* training and global coordination of genetic stocks
* evolving suitable breeding strategies to improve the anthocyanin content in potential breeds by collaboration with various research stations in the field of sericulture, plant genetics, and breeding, biotechnology and pharmacology

=== Paper ===
During the Angkorian age of the Khmer Empire of Southeast Asia, monks at Buddhist temples made paper from the bark of mulberry trees. The paper was used to make books, known as &quot;kraing&quot;.

Tengujo is the thinnest paper in the world. It is produced in Japan and made with kozo (stems of mulberry trees). Traditional Japanese washi paper is often created from parts of the mulberry tree.

=== Wood ===
The wood of mulberry trees is used for barrel aging of Țuică, a traditional Romanian plum brandy.

=== Other ===
According to 1 Maccabees, the Seleucids used the &quot;blood of grapes and mulberries&quot; to provoke their war elephants in preparation for battle against Jewish rebels.

==Culture==
A Babylonian etiological myth, which Ovid incorporated in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, attributes the reddish-purple color of the mulberry fruits to the tragic deaths of the lovers Pyramus and Thisbe. Meeting under a mulberry tree (probably the native &quot;Morus nigra&quot;), Thisbe commits suicide by sword after Pyramus does the same, he having believed, on finding her bloodstained cloak, that she was killed by a lion. Their splashed blood stained the previously white fruit, and the gods forever changed the mulberry&#x27;s colour to honour their forbidden love.

The nursery rhyme &quot;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush&quot; uses the tree in the refrain, as do some contemporary American versions of the nursery rhyme &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;.

Vincent van Gogh featured the mulberry tree in some of his paintings, notably &quot;Mulberry Tree&quot; (, 1889, now in Pasadena&#x27;s Norton Simon Museum). He painted it after a stay at an asylum, and he considered it a technical success.

<text>Urticales is an order of flowering plants. Before molecular phylogenetics became an important part of plant taxonomy, Urticales was recognized in many, perhaps even most, systems of plant classification, with some variations in circumscription. Among these is the Cronquist system (1981), which placed the order in the subclass Hamamelidae , as comprising:
* Barbeyaceae
* Cannabaceae
* Cecropiaceae
* Moraceae
* Ulmaceae
* Urticaceae

In the APG III system (2009), the plants belonging to this order, along with four other families, constitute the order Rosales. Cecropiaceae is no longer recognized as separate from Urticaceae. The families Ulmaceae, Cannabaceae, Moraceae, and Urticaceae form a clade that has strong statistical support in phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. This clade has been informally called the urticalean rosids.

Urticalean rosids refers to the relationships amongst several families of angiosperms, and now includes more than 2,500 species.

The families are:
* Cannabaceae
* Moraceae
* Ulmaceae
* Urticaceae

The relationships within the &quot;urticalean lineage&quot; are now considered to be within the Rosales. The Moraceae and Urticaceae account for approximately 90% of the diversity within the clade.

Analysis of DNA samples in &quot;rbcL&quot;, &quot;trnL-F&quot;, and &quot;ndhF&quot; plastid regions suggests that Urticalean rosids are derived out of a lineage including Barbeyaceae, Dirachmaceae, Elaeagnaceae, and Rhamnaceae, with Rosaceae less closely related. The morphological and molecular characters which define &quot;urticalean rosids&quot; are:
* A dense gray tomentum comprising curly unicellular trichomes on abaxial leaf surfaces 
* A reduced stamen count to one whorl or less
* Presence of inconspicuous flowers with up to five stamens
* Presence of two carpels
* A unilocular ovary with single apical ovule
* Urticoid teeth upon leaves 
* Developed prophyllar buds between paired inflorescences

Urticalean families span a wide range of morphological features—deciduous or evergreen trees, vines, shrubs, annuals and some succulents. Leaves also vary though they tend to share brochidodromous or palmately pinnate venation, often associated with lobing or compounding in the leaf blade. Among Moraceae, Urticacae and Cecropiaceae, mucilage cells and latex production is common. However, Cannabaceae and Ulmaceae do not produce this material despite the presence of laticifers.

<text>Sir Derek George Jacobi (; born 22 October 1938) is an English actor. He is known for his work at the Royal National Theatre and for his film and television roles. He has received numerous accolades including a BAFTA Award, two Olivier Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and a Tony Award. He was given a knighthood for his services to theatre by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994.

Jacobi started his professional acting career with Laurence Olivier as one of the founding members of the National Theatre. He has appeared in numerous Shakespearean stage productions including &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot;, and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Jacobi received the Laurence Olivier Award, for the title role in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; in 1983 and Malvolio in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in 2009. He also won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his role as Benedick in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; in 1985.

On television, he portrayed Claudius in the BBC series &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1976), for which he won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor. He received two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie for &quot;The Tenth Man&quot; (1988), and Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for &quot;Frasier&quot; (2001). He also took roles in ITV drama series &quot;Cadfael&quot; (1994–1998), the HBO film &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; (2002), the sitcom &quot;Vicious&quot; (2013-2016), in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Last Tango in Halifax&quot; (2012–2020), and the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot; in 2019.

Jacobi has acted in numerous films including &quot;Othello&quot; (1965), &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973), &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989), &quot;Dead Again&quot; (1991), &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996), &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot; (2005), &quot;The Riddle&quot; (2007), &quot;My Week with Marilyn&quot; (2011), &quot;Anonymous&quot; (2011), &quot;Cinderella&quot; (2015), and &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (2017). Jacobi portrayed Senator Gracchus in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000) and &quot;Gladiator II&quot; (2024). Jacobi has also earned two Screen Actors Guild Awards along with the ensemble cast for Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Gosford Park&quot; (2001), and Tom Hooper&#x27;s &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010).

== Early life and education ==
Derek George Jacobi was born on 22 October 1938 in Leytonstone, Essex, England, the only child of Daisy Gertrude (née Masters; 1910–1980), a secretary who worked in a drapery store in Leyton High Road, and Alfred George Jacobi (1910–1993), who ran a sweet shop and was a tobacconist in Chingford. His patrilineal great-grandfather had emigrated from Germany to England during the 19th century. He also has a distant Huguenot ancestor. His family was working-class, and Jacobi describes his childhood as happy. In his teens he went to Leyton County High School for Boys, now known as the Leyton Sixth Form College, and became an integral part of the drama club, The Players of Leyton.

While in the sixth form, he starred in a production of &quot;Hamlet,&quot; which was taken to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and very well regarded. At 18 he won a scholarship to the University of Cambridge, where he read history at St John&#x27;s College and earned his degree. Younger members of the university at the time included Ian McKellen (who had a crush on him—&quot;a passion that was undeclared and unrequited&quot;, as McKellen relates it) and Trevor Nunn. During his studies at Cambridge, Jacobi played many parts including &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which was taken on a tour to Switzerland, where he met Richard Burton. As a result of his performance of &quot;Edward II&quot; at Cambridge, Jacobi was invited to become a member of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre immediately upon his graduation in 1960.

==Career==
=== 1959–1979: Stage debut and breakthrough ===

Jacobi&#x27;s talent was recognised by Laurence Olivier, who invited the young actor back to London to become one of the founding members of the new National Theatre, even though at the time Jacobi was relatively unknown. He played Laertes in the National Theatre&#x27;s inaugural production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole in 1963. Olivier cast him as Cassio in the successful National Theatre stage production of &quot;Othello&quot;, a role that Jacobi repeated in the 1965 film version. He played Andrei in the NT production and film of &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (1970), both featuring Olivier. On 27 July 1965, Jacobi played Brindsley Miller in the first production of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Black Comedy&quot;. It was presented by the National Theatre at Chichester and subsequently in London.

After eight years at the National Theatre, Jacobi left in 1971 to pursue different roles. In 1972, he starred in the BBC serial &quot;Man of Straw&quot;, an adaptation of Heinrich Mann&#x27;s book &quot;Der Untertan&quot;, directed by Herbert Wise. Jacobi appeared in a somewhat comical role, as Lord Fawn, in eight episodes of the 26-episode mini-series &quot;The Pallisers&quot; for BBC Two in 1974. Most of his theatrical work in the 1970s was with the touring classical Prospect Theatre Company, with which he undertook many roles, including &quot;Ivanov&quot;, &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; and &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; opposite Dorothy Tutin (1976).

Jacobi was increasingly busy with stage and screen acting, but his big breakthrough came in 1976 when he played the title role in the BBC&#x27;s series &quot;I, Claudius&quot;. He cemented his reputation with his performance as the stammering, twitching Emperor Claudius, winning much praise. In 1979, thanks to his international popularity, he took &quot;Hamlet&quot; on a theatrical world tour through England, Egypt, Greece, Sweden, Australia, Japan and China, playing Prince Hamlet. He was invited to perform the role at Kronborg Castle, Denmark, known as Elsinore Castle, the setting of the play. In 1978, he appeared in the BBC Television Shakespeare production of &quot;Richard II&quot;, with Sir John Gielgud and Dame Wendy Hiller.

=== 1980–1999: Established career ===

In 1980, Jacobi took the leading role in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, made his Broadway debut in &quot;The Suicide&quot; (a run shortened by Jacobi&#x27;s return home to England due to the death of his mother), and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). From 1982 to 1985, he played four demanding roles simultaneously: Benedick in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, for which he won a Tony for its Broadway run (1984–1985); Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot;; &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;; and &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; which he brought to the US and played in repertory with &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; on Broadway and in Washington DC (1984–1985). In 1986, he made his West End debut in &quot;Breaking the Code&quot; by Hugh Whitemore, starring in the role of Alan Turing, which was written with Jacobi specifically in mind. The play was taken to Broadway. In 1988, Jacobi alternated in West End the title roles of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot; in repertoire.

He appeared in the television dramas &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot; (1982), where he played Hitler; &quot;Mr Pye&quot; (1985); &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1987), based on Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel; and &quot;The Tenth Man&quot; (1988) with Anthony Hopkins and Kristin Scott Thomas. In 1982, he voiced Nicodemus in the animated film, &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;. In 1990, he starred as Daedalus in episode 4 of &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s The Storyteller: Greek Myths&quot;. Jacobi continued to play Shakespeare roles, notably in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s 1989 film of &quot;Henry V&quot; (as the Chorus), and made his directing debut as Branagh&#x27;s director for the 1988 Renaissance Theatre Company&#x27;s touring production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which also played at Elsinore and as part of a Renaissance repertory season at the Phoenix Theatre in London. The 1990s saw Jacobi keeping on with repertoire stage work in &quot;Kean&quot; at The Old Vic, &quot;Becket&quot; in the West End (the Haymarket Theatre) and &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the RSC in both London and Stratford. In 1993 Jacobi voiced Mr Jeremy Fisher in &quot;The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends&quot;.

He was appointed the joint artistic director of the Chichester Festival Theatre, with the West End impresario Duncan Weldon in 1995 for a three-year tenure. As an actor at Chichester he also starred in four plays, including his first &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; in 1996 (he played it again in 2000, bringing the Chekhov play to Broadway for a limited run). Jacobi&#x27;s work during the 1990s included the 13-episode series TV adaptation of the novels by Ellis Peters, &quot;Cadfael&quot; (1994–1998) and a televised version of &quot;Breaking the Code&quot; (1996). Film appearances of the era included performances in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Dead Again&quot; (1991), Branagh&#x27;s full-text rendition of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996) as King Claudius, John Maybury&#x27;s &quot;Love is the Devil&quot; (1998), a portrait of painter Francis Bacon, as Senator Gracchus in &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000) with Russell Crowe, and as &quot;The Duke&quot; opposite Christopher Eccleston and Eddie Izzard in a post-apocalyptic version of Thomas Middleton&#x27;s &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (2002).

===2000–present===

Jacobi has narrated audio book versions of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; by C. S. Lewis, &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien, and two abridged versions of &quot;I, Claudius&quot; by Robert Graves. In 2001, he provided the voice of &quot;Duke Theseus&quot; in &quot;The Children&#x27;s Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; film. At the 53rd Primetime Emmy Awards, Jacobi won an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series by mocking his Shakespearean background in the television sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;The Show Must Go Off&quot;, in which he played the hammy, loud, untalented Jackson Hedley, a television star with a misguided belief that he deserves a revival of his stage career. In 2002, Jacobi toured Australia in &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; with Sir Donald Sinden, Ian Richardson and Dame Diana Rigg. Jacobi also played the role of Senator Gracchus in &quot;Gladiator&quot; and starred in the 2002 miniseries &quot;The Jury&quot;. He is also the narrator for the BBC children&#x27;s series &quot;In the Night Garden...&quot;.

In 2003, Jacobi was involved with &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot;, a webcast based on the science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He played the voice of the Doctor&#x27;s nemesis the Master alongside Richard E. Grant as the Doctor. In the same year, he also appeared in &quot;Deadline&quot;, an audio drama also based on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Therein he played Martin Bannister, an ageing writer who makes up stories about &quot;the Doctor&quot;, a character who travels in time and space, the premise being that the series had never made it on to television. Jacobi later followed this up with an appearance in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Utopia&quot; (June 2007); he appears as the kindly Professor Yana, who by the end of the episode is revealed to be the Master. Jacobi admitted to &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot; he had always wanted to be on the show: &quot;One of my ambitions since the &#x27;60s has been to take part in a &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The other one is &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. So I&#x27;ve cracked &quot;Doctor Who&quot; now. I&#x27;m still waiting for &quot;Corrie&quot;.&quot;

In 2004, Jacobi starred in Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot; at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, in an acclaimed production, which transferred to the Gielgud Theatre in London in January 2005. The London production of &quot;Don Carlos&quot; gathered rave reviews. Also in 2004, he starred as Lord Teddy Thursby in the first of the four-part BBC series &quot;The Long Firm&quot;, based on Jake Arnott&#x27;s novel of the same name. In &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot; (2005), he played the role of the colourful Mr. Wheen, an undertaker. He played the role of Alexander Corvinus in the 2006 action-horror film &quot;&quot;.

In March 2006, BBC Two broadcast &quot;Pinochet in Suburbia&quot;, a docudrama about former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and the attempts to extradite him from Great Britain; Jacobi played the leading role. In September 2007, it was released in the U.S., retitled &quot;Pinochet&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;. In 2006, he appeared in the children&#x27;s movie &quot;Mist&quot;, the tale of a sheepdog puppy, he also narrated this movie. In July–August 2006, he played the eponymous role in &quot;A Voyage Round My Father&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse, a production which then transferred to the West End.

In February 2007, &quot;The Riddle&quot;, directed by Brendan Foley and starring Jacobi, Vinnie Jones, and Vanessa Redgrave, was screened at Berlin EFM. Jacobi plays twin roles: first a present-day London tramp and then the ghost of Charles Dickens. In March 2007, the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s programme &quot;In the Night Garden...&quot; started its run of one hundred episodes, with Jacobi as the narrator. He played Nell&#x27;s grandfather in ITV&#x27;s Christmas 2007 adaptation of &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;, and returned to the stage to play Malvolio in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (2009) for the Donmar Warehouse at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in London. The role won him the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor. He appears in five 2009 films: &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hippie Hippie Shake&quot;, &quot;Endgame&quot;, &quot;Adam Resurrected&quot; and Charles Dickens&#x27;s England. In 2010, he returned to &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, as Augustus in a radio adaptation. In 2011, he was part of a medieval epic, &quot;Ironclad&quot;, which also starred James Purefoy and Paul Giamatti, as the ineffectual Reginald de Cornhill, castellan of Rochester castle.

Jacobi starred in Michael Grandage&#x27;s production of &quot;King Lear&quot; (London, 2010), giving what &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called &quot;one of the finest performances of his distinguished career&quot;. In May 2011, he reprised this role at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

In 2012, he appeared in &quot;&quot; and in November 2012, he starred in the BBC series &quot;Last Tango in Halifax&quot;. In 2013, he starred in the second series of &quot;Last Tango&quot;, and in 2014, the third series. In 2013, Jacobi starred alongside Ian McKellen in the ITV sitcom &quot;Vicious&quot; as Stuart Bixby, the partner to Freddie Thornhill, played by McKellen. On 23 August 2013, the show was renewed for a six-episode second series which began airing in June 2015. The show ended in December 2016, with a Christmas special.

Since 2017, Jacobi has again portrayed The Master in several box set series for Big Finish Productions, collectively entitled The War Master. In 2018, he played the Bishop of Digne in the BBC miniseries &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. In 2018, Jacobi received the World United Creator – Platinum Demiurge Award for his tremendous contribution to uniting and promoting world literature based on his efforts to introduce William Shakespeare into modern cinema. In 2019, he reprised the role of the emperor Claudius in &quot;Horrible Histories: The Movie – Rotten Romans&quot;. In 2022, Jacobi appeared in &quot;Allelujah&quot;, a film adaptation of Alan Bennett&#x27;s play of the same name directed by Richard Eyre, which also starred Jennifer Saunders, Bally Gill, Russell Tovey, David Bradley, and Judi Dench.

==Personal life==
Jacobi is an agnostic.

=== Sexuality ===
In March 2006, four months after civil partnerships were introduced in the United Kingdom, Jacobi registered his partnership with Richard Clifford, a theatre director, with whom he has been in a relationship since the late 1970s. They live in West Hampstead, northwest London.

Along with his &quot;Vicious&quot; co-star Ian McKellen, he was a Grand Marshal of the 46th New York City Gay Pride March in 2015.

=== Interests ===

Jacobi has been publicly involved in the Shakespeare authorship question. He supports the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, according to which Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford wrote the works of Shakespeare. Jacobi has given an address to the Shakespeare Authorship Research Centre promoting de Vere as the Shakespeare author and wrote forewords to two books on the subject in 2004 and 2005.

In 2007, Jacobi and fellow Shakespearean actor and director Mark Rylance initiated a &quot;Declaration of Reasonable Doubt&quot; on the authorship of Shakespeare&#x27;s work, to encourage new research into the question. In 2011, Jacobi accepted a role in the film &quot;Anonymous&quot;, about the Oxfordian theory, starring Rhys Ifans and Vanessa Redgrave. In the film Jacobi narrates the Prologue and Epilogue, set in modern-day New York, while the film proper is set in Elizabethan England. Jacobi said that making the film was &quot;a very risky thing to do&quot;, stating &quot;the orthodox Stratfordians are going to be apoplectic with rage&quot;.

== Acting credits and accolades ==
Jacobi has received various awards including two Olivier Awards, a Tony, a BAFTA, two Primetime Emmy Awards and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.

<text>Artturi Ilmari Virtanen (; 15 January 1895 – 11 November 1973) was a Finnish chemist and recipient of the 1945 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his research and inventions in agricultural and nutrition chemistry, especially for his fodder preservation method&quot;.

He invented AIV silage which improved milk production and a method of preserving butter, the AIV salt, which led to increased Finnish butter exports.

==Personal life==
Artturi Ilmari Virtanen was born on 15 January 1895, in Helsinki, Finland . He is the son of Kaarlo Virtanen, a railway engine driver and Serafina Isotalo. 

He completed his school education at the Classical Lyceum in Viipuri, Finland. He married the botanist Lilja Moisio (1894-1972) in 1920 and had two sons with her.

In 1933, he bought a farm near Helsinki where he tested some of his scientific results in practice. He saw in the overproduction of food only a temporary phenomenon. He lived a simple life, he never had a car of his own, never smoked and never consumed alcohol. He died of pneumonia in November 1973, following a broken femur from a fall few weeks prior. He was buried at the Hietaniemi Cemetery.

==Academics==
Virtanen began his studies at the University of Helsinki in chemistry 1913 earning his Master and in 1918 his PhD in organic chemistry. In 1919 he started to work in the laboratories of Valio, a large producer of dairy products and became director of the laboratory in 1920. Feeling not fully qualified and following his interest in botany and zoology led him to further scientific education and so he left Valio and studied at the ETH, the University of Münster and the University of Stockholm he studied physical chemistry, soil chemistry and microbiology. In 1923 in Sweden he worked with Hans von Euler-Chelpin, who was awarded with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1929. Back in Finland he became lecturer at the University of Helsinki in 1924, known for his lectures on chemistry of life. He worked in the laboratory of the Butter Export Association, which became a laboratory of the university. In 1930 the Institute for Biochemistry was founded and Virtanen stayed there until his death in 1973. He became professor of biochemistry at the Helsinki University of Technology in 1931 and at the University of Helsinki in 1939.

==Career==
His research started with work on the phosphorylation of hexoses in 1924. He was able to show that phosphorylation is the first step in many fermentation reactions, which was the foundation of the Embden–Meyerhof pathway.

In 1925 his interests shifted to the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the root nodules of leguminous plants. The improved methods of butter preservation, by adding disodium phosphate to prevent acidic hydrolysis. This method was in use for several decades in Finland. His research from 1925 till 1932 included the invention of a fodder preservation method (AIV fodder). The method, patented in 1932, was basically a kind of silage that improved the storage of green fodder, which is important during long winters. The process includes adding dilute hydrochloric or sulfuric acid to newly stored grain. Increased acidity stops harmful fermentation and has no adverse effect on the nutritive value of the fodder or the animals it is fed to. In 1945, Virtanen received the Nobel Prize in chemistry &quot;for his research and inventions in agricultural and nutrition chemistry&quot;.

His later years studies included the development of partially synthetic cattle feeds. The nitrogen for the synthesis of amino acids normally comes from proteins in the fodder. A special bacterial environment in the rumen of cattle allows them to use urea and ammonium salts as source for the nitrogen instead of plant proteins like soybean or meat and bone meal. He also headed the Valio Laboratory from 1921 to 1969.

==Awards and honours==
The prestige conferred by the Nobel Prize brought Virtanen invitations, honorary doctorates and membership in foreign academies of science. He was a member of the Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Flemish, Bavarian, and Pontifical Academies of Science, and of the Swedish and Danish Academies of Engineering Sciences. He was an honorary member of learned societies in Finland, Sweden, Austria, Edinburgh, and the US, and received honorary degrees of the Universities of Lund, Paris, Giessen, and Helsinki, the Royal Technical College at Stockholm, and the Finland Institute of Technology.

The asteroid 1449 Virtanen, discovered by the renowned Finnish astronomer and physicist Yrjö Väisälä, was named after him. The lunar crater Virtanen is also named after him.

<text>Laestadianism (; ; ; ), also known as Laestadian Lutheranism and Apostolic Lutheranism, is a pietistic Lutheran revival movement started in Sápmi in the middle of the 19th century. Named after Swedish Lutheran state church administrator and temperance movement leader Lars Levi Laestadius, it is the biggest pietistic revivalist movement in the Nordic countries. It has members mainly in Finland, Northern America, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. There are also smaller congregations in Africa, South America, and Central Europe. In addition Laestadian Lutherans have missionaries in 23 countries. The number of Laestadians worldwide is estimated to be between 144,000 and 219,000.

== Organization in Finland and North America ==

Most Laestadians in Finland are part of the national Lutheran Church of Finland (cf. &quot;Communion of Nordic Lutheran Dioceses&quot;); but in America, where there is no official Lutheran church, they founded their own denomination, which split into three sub-groups in the mid-20th century. Subsequent splits in the American church later resulted in 19 branches, of which about 15 are active today.

The three large main branches, comprising about 90 percent of Laestadians, are:

* Conservative Laestadianism are known to other Laestadians as the &quot;Heidemans&quot;, after 20th-century leader Paul A. Heideman. They are represented in North America by the Laestadian Lutheran Church.
* The Firstborn are known to other Laestadians as the &quot;Esikoinens&quot;. They are represented in North America by the Old Apostolic Lutheran Church.
* (&quot;Word of Peace&quot;) are known to other Laestadians as the &quot;Mickelsens&quot;, after 20th-century leader Andrew Mickelsen. They are represented in North America by the Apostolic Lutheran Church of America. 

The other branches are small and some of them inactive.

In Finland, the (&quot;the Word of life&quot;) group, as the most &quot;mainline&quot; of the different branches of Laestadianism, has been prominent within the hierarchy of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland: two members have been elected bishops of Oulu, and one has served as Chaplain General (head chaplain of the Finnish Defence Forces, the equivalent of a Major General).

== Distinguishing doctrines and practices ==

=== Emphasis on justification ===
All branches share many essential teachings including a central emphasis on the Lutheran doctrine of justification (forgiveness and grace).

=== &quot;The true Christians&quot; doctrine ===
Another core teaching concerns essential differences in lifestyle and beliefs between true believers on one hand, and false Christians and unbelievers (sometimes distinguished as of living faith versus dead faith), on the other.

====Exclusion and inclusion among Laestadian sub-groups====
The leaders of the two largest Laestadian sub-groups, the Conservative Laestadians and Firstborn Laestadians, have for decades excluded each other and all other Laestadian sub-groups from the kingdom of Heaven even though the denominations&#x27; core doctrines are nearly indistinguishable. The leadership of the smaller third main sub-group, the Federation, has continued to regard the other sub-groups as of living faith, after having unsuccessfully sought to preserve unity within Laestadianism when its larger counterparts&#x27; leaders in the 1930s called for, and later required, dissociation from the Federation and other Laestadian denominations.

=== Declaration of forgiveness ===
The church teaches that every believer has the authority to testify that others&#x27; sins are forgiven, sometimes referred to as the audible declaration of the forgiveness of sins. Laestadians usually proclaim the forgiveness of sins &quot;in Jesus&#x27; name and blood&quot;.

==== In practice ====
Laestadianism holds that when a Christian has committed a sin, whether in thought or deed, she or he should confess the sin to another believer. Thus it is a common practice among Laestadians in or out of church at any time, but especially during the church service prior to the rite of holy communion, to be confessing their sins to one another or, occasionally, to one of the church ministers performing the sacrament. A common declaration is, &quot;Believe your sin(s) forgiven in Jesus&#x27; name and (shed) blood.&quot; This procedure, ingrained in Laestadianism, differs from absolution in mainstream Lutheran churches in several aspects, including that the request for forgiveness need not be, and most often is not, to the minister; the confession is often made openly; confession is not by appointment but rather readily available to any believer from any other believer at any time; and the specific wording of the declaration states that the means of atonement is Christ&#x27;s shed blood.

==== A most solemn rite ====
Because a Laestadian takes very seriously the proposition that grace exists only for one whose sins have been specifically forgiven, there is scarcely another rite in this movement that would rival the importance of the declaration of forgiveness. This doctrine is a unique extension of the priesthood of the believer doctrine.

=== Identifying greeting and farewell ===
Both in greeting one another and on parting, English-speaking Laestadians say &quot;God&#x27;s peace&quot;, while Finnish-speaking Laestadians greet one another with , meaning , and take leave of one another with , meaning .

=== Emphasis on avoiding sin and &quot;worldliness&quot; ===
&quot;Worldliness&quot; is discouraged, and Laestadians frown on pre-marital sex, and on alcohol consumption except in the sacrament of holy communion. Conservative Laestadians frown upon worldly vices such as dancing, television, birth control, rhythmic music, make-up, earrings, movies, tattoos, and cursing. Some conservative elements within the church go even further in rejecting the ways of the world by, for example, refusing to buy insurance, prohibiting their children&#x27;s participation in organized school sports, and removing their car radios. Simplicity in the home, including the prohibition of curtains and flowers, is also a common claim especially among Firstborn Laestadians, but is not a church doctrine.

=== Birth control ===
Especially large numbers of Firstborn Apostolic Lutherans and many members of the most conservative congregations within the Word of Peace group do not use birth control because they believe that a child is a gift from God; therefore, many Laestadian families are large.

=== Social gatherings ===
The central activities of Laestadians are annual or more frequent church conventions, including the Summer Services of Conservative Laestadians, attended by members from congregations far and wide; and for the youth, &quot;haps&quot; (gatherings of teenagers and young adults to sing from &quot;Songs and Hymns of Zion&quot; and visit), song services, bonfires, youth discussions, caretaking meetings and revival meetings.

Within Firstborn Laestadianism in Scandinavia, the most important yearly events are the Christmas services in Gällivare and the Midsummer services in Lahti, where thousands of Firstborn Laestadians from different countries gather each year.

=== Publications ===
Different branches publish their newspapers and magazines.

=== Chosen Scripture ===
In Finland, the Bible version primarily used by Laestadians is the Finnish Bible of 1776 which, unlike newer translations, is based on the Textus Receptus. The Central Association of the Finnish Associations of Peace (SRK) publishes a triple Finnish translation (1776, 1933/1938, and 1992) that is used as both a study and a service Bible by Conservative Laestadian preachers. American and Canadian Laestadianism uses the King James Version, based as well on the Textus Receptus.

== History ==
=== Roots of the movement ===

The name of the movement stems from Lars Levi Laestadius (1800–1861), a Swedish Sámi preacher and administrator for the Swedish state Lutheran church in Sápmi who was also a noted botanist. Laestadius started the movement when working as a pastor for the Church of Sweden in northern Sweden in the 1840s. Laestadius met a Sami woman named Milla Clementsdotter from Föllinge in the municipality of Krokom in Jämtland during an 1844 inspection tour of Åsele. She belonged to a revival movement within the Church of Sweden led by pastor Pehr Brandell of the parish of Nora in the municipality of Kramfors in Ångermanland and characterized by pietistic and Moravian influences. She told Laestadius about her spiritual experiences on her journey to a truly living Christianity, and after the meeting Laestadius felt he had come to understand the secret of living faith. He had had a deep experience of having entered a state of grace, of having received God&#x27;s forgiveness for his sins and of at last truly seeing the path that leads to eternal life. His sermons acquired, in his own words, &quot;a new kind of colour&quot; to which people began to respond. The movement began to spread from Sweden to Finland and Norway, particularly among the Sámi and the Kvens. He preferred his followers to be known simply as &quot;Christians&quot;, but others started to call them &quot;Laestadians.&quot;

=== Initial effect on Laestadius&#x27;s Sámi parishioners ===
Two great challenges Laestadius had faced since his early days as a church minister were the indifference of his Sámi parishioners, who had been forced by the Swedish government to convert from their shamanistic religion to Lutheranism, and the misery caused them by alcoholism. The spiritual understanding Laestadius acquired and shared in his new sermons &quot;filled with vivid metaphors from the lives of the Sami that they could understand, ... about a God who cared about the lives of the people&quot; had a profound positive effect on both problems. An account from the Sámi cultural perspective recalls a new desire among the Sámi to learn to read and a bustle and energy in the church, with people confessing their sins, crying and praying for forgiveness—within Laestadianism this was known as &quot;liikutukset&quot;, a kind of ecstasy. Drunkenness and cattle theft diminished, which had a positive influence on the Samis&#x27; relationships, finances and family life.

=== Rise of Laestadianism among the Sámi ===
The rapid rise of Laestadianism among the Sámi was due to several factors. Laestadius proudly self-identified as Sámi through his Southern Sámi mother. He spoke and preached in two Sámi dialects. Further he chose uneducated lay preachers from the Sámi reindeer herders to travel year around with them and preach to the unrepented among them. Additionally, in the early days of the movement, Laestadius, in order to find common ground with his parishioners, borrowed the Sámis&#x27; own familiar pagan deities and concepts and adapted them to Christianity. Another factor in the rise of Laestadianism among the Sámi was that the state-mandated boarding schools soon came to be populated by Laestadian personnel. Next, the strict moral code including strict temperance of Laestadianism appealed to the Sámi. Whole communities that had been wrecked by alcoholism went sober virtually overnight. This had the added positive effect of improving the Sámis&#x27; social standing with the outside world. Finally, Laestadianism was a faith that the Sámi could identify as originating from within inasmuch as Laestadius himself professed to have come to know the true living faith only upon his encounter with the poor abused Sámi woman, Milla Clementsdotter.

=== &quot;Unbroken line of living Christianity&quot; ===
A faction within Laestadianism has believed that the movement is a contemporary descendant of an unbroken line of living Christianity via Luther, the Bohemian Brethren, the Lollards, and the Waldensians all the way back to the primitive Church. Martin Luther, Jan Hus, John Wycliffe, and Peter Waldo are seen as spiritual ancestors of Laestadianism.

=== Fertility ===
Members tend to have large families by Western standards. In Finland, their demographic advantage has grown as the national fertility rate has fallen: in the 1940s their fertility rate was twice the national average, while in the 1980s it was four times the average. &quot;By 1985–7, the Laestadian and Finnish TFRs stood at 5.47 and 1.45 respectively. Even within the Laestadian TFR of 5.47, there is diversity, with a &#x27;moderate&#x27; group preferring to stop at four [children] and practise birth control while a conservative cluster engages in unrestrained reproduction. 

No research has been done on Laestadians&#x27; level of endogamy and membership retention [as of 2010]. However, they are residentially and occupationally integrated, so lose more members to assimilation. For example, in the small town of Larsmo, despite some losses to outmarriage and emigration, their share of the population doubled over just thirty years to about 40% in 1991 and was predicted to be &quot;a two-thirds majority of the town in a generation.&quot;

<text>Aleksis Kivi (; born Alexis Stenvall; 10 October 1834 – 31 December 1872) was a Finnish writer who wrote the first significant novel in the Finnish language, &quot;Seitsemän veljestä&quot; (&quot;Seven Brothers&quot;), published in 1870. He is also known for his 1864 play, &quot;Nummisuutarit&quot; (&quot;Heath Cobblers&quot;). Although Kivi was among the very earliest writers of prose and lyrics in Finnish, he is still considered one of the greatest.

Kivi is regarded as the national writer of Finland and his birthday, 10 October, is celebrated as Finnish Literature Day.

==Life==
Aleksis Stenvall was born in Palojoki village, Nurmijärvi, Grand Duchy of Finland. His parents were the village tailor Erik Johan Stenvall (1798–1866) and Anna-Kristiina Hamberg (1793–1863). Aleksis had three older brothers – Johannes, Emanuel, and Albert – and a younger sister, Agnes, who died in 1851 at the age of 13.

In 1846, Kivi left for school in Helsinki. In 1859, he was accepted into the University of Helsinki, where he studied literature and developed an interest in the theatre. His first play was &quot;Kullervo&quot; (1860), based on a tragic tale from the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, Finland&#x27;s national epic. He also met the famous journalist and statesman Johan Vilhelm Snellman who became his supporter.

During his time at school Kivi read world literature from the library of his landlord, and during his university studies, he saw plays by Molière and Schiller at the Swedish Theatre in Helsinki. Kivi also became friends with Fredrik Cygnaeus and Elias Lönnrot.
From 1863 onwards, Kivi devoted his time to writing. He wrote twelve plays and a collection of poetry. The novel &quot;Seitsemän veljestä&quot; (&quot;Seven Brothers&quot;) took him ten years to write. Literary critics, especially the prominent August Ahlqvist, disapproved of the book, at least nominally because of its &quot;rudeness&quot; (Romanticism was at its height at the time). Ahlqvist also wrote &quot;It is a ridiculous work and a blot on the name of Finnish literature&quot;. In a review published in &quot;Finlands Allmänna Tidning&quot;, Ahlqvist wrote that &quot;the brothers&#x27; characters were nothing like calm, serious and laborious folk who toiled the Finnish lands.&quot; It is known that no other critic hated Kivi&#x27;s writings as much as Ahlqvist, in which case the situation could almost be called &quot;persecution&quot;, but the Fennomans also disapproved of Kivi&#x27;s not-so-virtuous depictions of rural life, which were far from their idealized point of view, and Kivi&#x27;s excessive drinking may have alienated some.

In 1865, Kivi won the State Prize for his still often performed comedy &quot;Nummisuutarit&quot; (&quot;Heath Cobblers&quot;). However, the less-than-enthusiastic reception of his books was taking its toll and he was already drinking heavily. His main benefactor Charlotta Lönnqvist, with whom Kivi lived in Siuntio at the time of his creative writing, could not help him after the 1860s.

By 1870, while he was living at Franzén&#x27;s cottage in Tapanila, Helsinki, Kivi&#x27;s health collapsed. Assailed by typhoid and attacks of delirium, he was hospitalised. His doctor diagnosed melancholia due to his &quot;injured dignity as a writer&quot;. The psychiatrist Kalle Achté concludes, based on a documentary survey, that Kivi was suffering from of schizophrenia, although advanced borreliosis has also been suggested.

Kivi died in poverty in 1872 (aged 38) in Tuusula, at the home of his brother Albert. According to legend, his last words were, &quot;I live&quot; ().

==Tribute==
In the early 20th century, young writers Volter Kilpi and Eino Leino raised Kivi to the status of national icon. Eino Leino – and later Väinö Linna and Veijo Meri – also identified with Kivi&#x27;s fate as an author.

In 1936, the Aleksis Kivi Prize, awarded for contributions to Finnish literature, was established.

In 1939, the Aleksis Kivi Memorial, a bronze statue of Kivi by Wäinö Aaltonen, was erected in front of the Finnish National Theatre. Many streets in Finnish cities and towns have also been named after Kivi, such as Aleksis Kiven katu in Tampere.

In 1941 the was founded.

In 1995 to 1996, Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara wrote an opera about Kivi&#x27;s life and works. Two films have also been made: &quot;&quot; (Finnish title: &quot;Minä elän&quot;) from 1946, directed by Ilmari Unho; and &quot;The Life of Aleksis Kivi&quot; (Finnish title: &quot;Aleksis Kiven elämä&quot;) from 2002, written and directed by Jari Halonen.

<text>Seitsemän veljestä (; literally translated The Seven Brothers, or &quot;The Brothers Seven&quot; in Douglas Robinson&#x27;s 2017 translation) is the first and only novel by Aleksis Kivi, the national author of Finland. It is widely regarded as the first significant novel written in Finnish and by a Finnish-speaking author, and is considered a real pioneer of Finnish realistic folklore. Some people still regard it as the greatest Finnish novel ever written, and in time it has even gained the status of a &quot;national novel of Finland&quot;. The deep significance of the work for Finnish culture has even been quoted internationally, and in a &quot;BBC&quot; article by Lizzie Enfield, for example, which describes Kivi&#x27;s &quot;Seitsemän veljestä&quot; as &quot;the book that shaped a Nordic identity.&quot;

Kivi began writing the work in the early 1860s and wrote it at least three times, but no manuscript has survived. The work was largely created while Kivi lived in Siuntio&#x27;s Fanjurkars with Charlotta Lönnqvist. It was first published in 1870 in four volumes, but the publication of a one-volume novel did not happen until 1873, a year after the author&#x27;s death.

==Reception history==
Published in 1870, &quot;Seitsemän veljestä&quot; ended an era dominated by Swedish-speaking authors, most notable of whom was J. L. Runeberg, and created a solid basis for new Finnish authors like Minna Canth and Juhani Aho, who were, following Aleksis Kivi, the first authors to depict ordinary Finns in a realistic way.

The novel was particularly reviled by the literary circles of Kivi&#x27;s time, who disliked the unflattering image of Finns it presented. The title characters were seen as crude caricatures of the nationalistic ideals of the time. Foremost in this hostile backlash was the influential critic August Ahlqvist, who called the book a &quot;ridiculous work and a blot on the name of Finnish literature&quot; and wrote in a review published in &quot;Finlands Allmänna Tidning&quot; that &quot;the brothers&#x27; characters were nothing like calm, serious and laborious folk who toiled the Finnish lands.&quot; Another critic worth mentioning was the Fennoman politician Agathon Meurman, who, among other things, said the book was &quot;a hellish lie about Finnish peasants&quot; and stated that &quot;Mr. Kivi regards the printing press as his poetic rectum.&quot;

Literary scholar Markku Eskelinen considers &quot;Seitsemän veljestä&quot; to be very exceptional compared to his time of birth and the state of Finnish prose literature at that time. According to Eskelinen, the work is more tense and aesthetically complex than the realistic novels of the significant generation of writers who followed Kivi. Eskelinen also highlights Kivi&#x27;s linguistic play with genres: although the work uses a lot of biblical and otherwise religious language for understandable reasons due to the dominance of religious literature at the time, its attitude to religious authority is not submissive, unlike other prose literature of the time. In Eskelinen&#x27;s opinion, Finnish-language prose works comparable to the richness and multilevelness of Kivi&#x27;s work began to appear only in the next century.

The novel is referred to in the coat of arms of the Nurmijärvi municipality, the birthplace of Kivi. The explanation of the coat of arms is “in the blue field, the heads of seven young golden-haired young men set 2+3+2.” The coat of arms was designed by Olof Eriksson in accordance with the idea proposed by B. Harald Hellström, and was approved by the Nurmijärvi Municipal Council at its meeting on December 18, 1953. The coat of arms was approved for use by the Ministry of the Interior on April 14, 1954.

==Characters==
===Jukola brothers===
*Juhani – at 25 years old the oldest brother. The leader of the group and also the most stubborn.
*Tuomas – scrupulous, strong as a bull, although Juhani claims to be the strongest brother.
*Aapo – twin-brother of Tuomas. Logical and peaceful.
*Simeoni – alcoholic and the most religious brother.
*Lauri – the most solemn brother, friend of nature and a loner.
*Timo – twin-brother of Lauri; simple and earnest.
*Eero – at 18 years old he is the youngest brother. Intelligent, clever, quarrelsome when confronted by Juhani.

===Other===
*Venla, a neighbor girl wooed by five of the seven brothers

==Plot summary==
At first, the brothers are not a particularly peaceful lot and end up quarreling with the local constable, juryman, vicar, churchwarden, and teachers—not to mention their neighbours in the village of Toukola. No wonder young girls&#x27; mothers do not regard them as good suitors. When the brothers are required to learn to read before they can accept church confirmation and therefore official adulthood—and the right to marry—they decide to run away.


Eventually they end up moving to distant Impivaara in the middle of relative wilderness, but their first efforts are shoddy—one Christmas Eve they end up burning down their sauna. The next spring they try again, but are forced to kill a nearby lord&#x27;s herd of bulls and pay them back with wheat. Ten years of hard work clearing the forest for fields, hard drinking—and Simeoni&#x27;s apocalyptic visions from delirium tremens—eventually lead them to mend their ways. They learn to read on their own and eventually return to Jukola.

In the end, most of them become pillars of the community and family men. Still, the tone of the tale is not particularly moralistic. Symbolically, the brothers represent the Finnish-speaking people and culture in the midst of external forces that force them to change.

==Translations==
&quot;Seitsemän veljestä&quot; has been translated three times into English and 56 more times into 33 other languages. Many significant Finnish artists have been responsible for illustrating the book, including Akseli Gallén-Kallela (1908), Marcus Collin (1948), Matti Visanti (1950), and Erkki Tanttu (1961).

The first English edition was translated by Alexander Matson and published in 1929 by Coward-McCann. Revised editions of Matson&#x27;s translation were published in 1952 and 1973 by Tammi Publishers, with Irma Rantavaara conducting the third edition&#x27;s revisions.

A translation by Richard Impola was published in 1991 by the Finnish American Translators Association. Douglas Robinson translated the book in 2017 under the title &quot;The Brothers Seven&quot; for Zeta Books in Bucharest.

==Adaptations==
The Finnish National Theatre produced the first stage version of the novel in 1898 and Armas Launis composed the first Finnish comic opera based on the novel in 1913. The first film adaptation was made by in 1939.

In 1989, a television series called directed by Jouko Turkka caused wide controversy because of its portrayal of the brothers.

The novel was adapted into a children&#x27;s picture book in 2002 with all the characters changed into dogs or birds, which was titled &quot;The Seven Dog Brothers: Being a Doggerel Version of The Seven Brothers, Aleksis Kivi&#x27;s Classic Novel from 1870&quot;. The book was credited to Mauri Kunnas, a Finnish children&#x27;s author, and Tarja Kunnas. Mr. Clutterbuck from &quot;Goodnight, Mr. Clutterbuck&quot;, also by Mauri Kunnas, makes an appearance in the story.

<text>Arvo Henrik Ylppö (27 October 1887 – 28 January 1992) was a Finnish physician and professor of pediatrics who significantly decreased Finnish infant mortality during the 20th century. He is credited as the father of Finland&#x27;s public maternity and child health clinic system established in 1922 (), which focuses on monitoring the health and development of newborn and pre-school children and their families, providing parents with childcare guidance and supporting child-parent interaction. For forty years, Ylppö held the title of archiater (&quot;arkkiatri&quot;), the highest honorary title awarded to a physician. Internationally, he was known for his research on premature infants.

Ylppö was born in 1887 in Akaa, Finland into a farming family. He was apparently born premature and remained small in stature through his life. He entered the University of Helsinki in 1906 and decided to specialize in pediatric medicine. In 1912, he moved to the Imperial Children&#x27;s Hospital in Berlin, Germany, where he wrote his thesis about infants&#x27; bilirubin metabolism in 1913. It was printed in Germany. He graduated as a medical doctor in March 1914 in Helsinki.

While in Germany, Ylppö concentrated on research about children&#x27;s pathological anatomy and attracted international recognition. In his research, he observed that deaths of prematurely born infants are usually due to treatable conditions rather than simple underdevelopment, which motivated advancement of treatment of and science related to prematurely born infants.

After returning to Finland in 1920, he became a teacher at Helsinki University Hospital. In 1922, he established an advice centre for the care of young children in the Children&#x27;s Castle (&quot;Lastenlinna&quot;) hospital, which is considered to be the beginning of child health clinics in Finland. In 1925, he became professor of pediatrics.

Ylppö continued his research, wrote extensively to medical journals about child care. He supported efforts to expand Finnish nurse training, Finnish pharmacy industry, and public awareness about medical matters. He retired as a professor in 1957 but still sponsored many childcare initiatives. From 1920 to 1963, he was chief physician at the Children&#x27;s Castle hospital. He also had a private practice in Helsinki.

Arvo Ylppö died in January 1992 at the age of 104. He is buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.

<doc id="168032" wikidata="Q1345480" url="?curid=168032" title="Codpiece">
<text>A codpiece () is a triangular piece that attached to the front of men&#x27;s hose, covering the fly. It may be held in place by ties or buttons. It was an important fashion item of European clothing during the 15th–16th centuries, in the 16th century becoming a firm upwards-pointing projection based on a stiff material such as boiled leather, or in plate armour, steel. 

In the modern era, similar clothing pieces are worn in the leather subculture, and in performance costumes, such as for rock and metal musicians. A similar device with rigid construction, an athletic cup, is used as protective gear for male athletes.

==In European fashion==

From the ancient world there are extant depictions of articles of clothing designed to cover just the male genitalia; for example, archaeological recovery at Minoan Knossos on Crete has yielded figurines, some of whom wear only a garment covering the male genitalia. However, the codpiece, &quot;per se&quot;, appeared in everyday European fashion for men only many centuries later, associated with hose and trousers.

In 14th century European fashions, men&#x27;s hose were two separate legs worn over linen drawers, leaving a man&#x27;s genitals covered only by a layer of the linen drawers. As the century wore on and men&#x27;s hemline fashion rose, the hose became longer and joined at the centre back, there rising to the waist, but remaining open at the centre front. Further shortening of the cote or doublet fashion resulted in more prominence of the genitals; this area would then be covered with a triangular material called a codpiece. Most of what is known about the cut, fit, and materials used for Renaissance codpieces is through portraits, clothing inventories, receipts for payments and tailor cutting guides.

As time passed, codpieces became shaped and padded to emphasize rather than to conceal the penis.

Such excessive codpieces became an object of derision showered on outlandish fashions. The Renaissance author, François Rabelais, refers satirically to a book entitled &quot;On the Dignity of Codpieces&quot;, in the foreword to his 1532 book, &quot;The Histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;.

This fashion reached its peak of size and decoration in the 1540s before falling out of use by the 1590s.Suits of armor of the 16th century followed civilian fashion, and for a time, codpieces were a prominent addition to the full suits of armor.

A few examples of full suits of armor with codpieces are on display in museums today. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has one. The Higgins Armory in Worcester, Massachusetts, also had an example on display until its close. The armor of Henry VIII displayed in the Tower of London has a codpiece as well.

Examples of metal parts of such armor are depicted by Wendelin Boeheim in his 1890 publication on the history of weapons, , which was published in Leipzig, Germany.
